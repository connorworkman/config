<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">FHS -
Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Filesystem
Hierarchy Standard &mdash; Version 2.2 final</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This standard
consists of a set of requirements and guidelines for file
and directory placement under -like operating systems. The
guidelines are intended to support interoperability of
applications, system administration tools, development
tools, and scripts as well as greater uniformity of
documentation for these systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This standard enables Software to predict the location of
installed files and directories, and Users to predict the
location of installed files and directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We do this by
Specifying guiding principles for each area of the
filesystem, Specifying the minimum files and directories
required, Enumerating exceptions to the principles, and
Enumerating specific cases where there has been historical
conflict.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The FHS
document is used by Independent software suppliers to create
applications which are FHS compliant, and work with
distributions which are FHS complaint, OS creators to
provide systems which are FHS compliant, and Users to
understand and maintain the FHS compliance of a system.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Conventions</b>
<br>
We recommend that you read a typeset version of this
document rather than the plain text version. In the typeset
version, the names of files and directories are displayed in
a constant-width font.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Components of
filenames that vary are represented by a description of the
contents enclosed in &quot;<tt>&lt;</tt>&quot; and
&quot;<tt>&gt;</tt>&quot; characters, <tt>&lt;thus&gt;</tt>.
Electronic mail addresses are also enclosed in
&quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; but are shown in the
usual typeface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Optional
components of filenames are enclosed in
&quot;<tt>[</tt>&quot; and &quot;<tt>]</tt>&quot; characters
and may be combined with the &quot;<tt>&lt;</tt>&quot; and
&quot;<tt>&gt;</tt>&quot; convention. For example, if a
filename is allowed to occur either with or without an
extension, it might be represented by
<tt>&lt;filename&gt;[.&lt;extension&gt;]</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Variable
substrings of directory names and filenames are indicated by
&quot;<tt>*</tt>&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
Filesystem</b> <br>
This standard assumes that the operating system underlying
an -compliant file system supports the same basic security
features found in most filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
to define two independent categories of files: shareable vs.
unshareable and variable vs. static. There should be a
simple and easily understandable mapping from directories to
the type of data they contain: directories may be mount
points for other filesystems with different characteristics
from the filesystem on which they are mounted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Shareable data
is that which can be shared between several different hosts;
unshareable is that which must be specific to a particular
host. For example, user home directories are shareable data,
but device lock files are not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Static data
includes binaries, libraries, documentation, and anything
that does not change without system administrator
intervention; variable data is anything else that does
change without system administrator intervention. The
distinction between shareable and unshareable data is needed
for several reasons: In a networked environment (i.e., more
than one host at a site), there is a good deal of data that
can be shared between different hosts to save space and ease
the task of maintenance. In a networked environment, certain
files contain information specific to a single host.
Therefore these filesystems cannot be shared (without taking
special measures). Historical implementations of -like
filesystems interspersed shareable and unshareable data in
the same hierarchy, making it difficult to share large
portions of the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;shareable&quot; distinction can be used to support,
for example: A <tt>/usr</tt> partition (or components of
<tt>/usr</tt>) mounted (read-only) through the network
(using NFS). A <tt>/usr</tt> partition (or components of
<tt>/usr</tt>) mounted from read-only media. A CD-ROM is one
copy of many identical ones distributed to other users by
the postal mail system and other methods. It can thus be
regarded as a read-only filesystem shared with other
-compliant systems by some kind of &quot;network&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;static&quot; versus &quot;variable&quot; distinction
affects the filesystem in two major ways: Since <tt>/</tt>
contains both variable and static data, it needs to be
mounted read-write. Since the traditional <tt>/usr</tt>
contains both variable and static data, and since we may
want to mount it read-only (see above), it is necessary to
provide a method to have <tt>/usr</tt> mounted read-only.
This is done through the creation of a <tt>/var</tt>
hierarchy that is mounted read-write (or is a part of
another read-write partition, such as <tt>/)</tt>, taking
over much of the <tt>/usr</tt> partition&rsquo;s traditional
functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is a
summarizing chart. This chart is only an example for a
common -compliant system, other chart layouts are possible
within -compliance.</p>

<h2>The Root Filesystem
<a name="The Root Filesystem"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
The contents of the root filesystem must be adequate to
boot, restore, recover, and/or repair the system. To boot a
system, enough must be present on the root partition to
mount other filesystems. This includes utilities,
configuration, boot loader information, and other essential
start-up data. <tt>/usr</tt>, <tt>/opt</tt>, and
<tt>/var</tt> are designed such that they may be located on
other partitions or filesystems. To enable recovery and/or
repair of a system, those utilities needed by an experienced
maintainer to diagnose and reconstruct a damaged system must
be present on the root filesystem. To restore a system,
those utilities needed to restore from system backups (on
floppy, tape, etc.) must be present on the root
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The primary
concern used to balance these considerations, which favor
placing many things on the root filesystem, is the goal of
keeping root as small as reasonably possible. For several
reasons, it is desirable to keep the root filesystem small:
It is occasionally mounted from very small media. The root
filesystem contains many system-specific configuration
files. Possible examples include a kernel that is specific
to the system, a specific hostname, etc. This means that the
root filesystem isn&rsquo;t always shareable between
networked systems. Keeping it small on servers in networked
systems minimizes the amount of lost space for areas of
unshareable files. It also allows workstations with smaller
local hard drives. While you may have the root filesystem on
a large partition, and may be able to fill it to your
heart&rsquo;s content, there will be people with smaller
partitions. If you have more files installed, you may find
incompatibilities with other systems using root filesystems
on smaller partitions. If you are a developer then you may
be turning your assumption into a problem for a large number
of users. Disk errors that corrupt data on the root
filesystem are a greater problem than errors on any other
partition. A small root filesystem is less prone to
corruption as the result of a system crash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Software must
never create or require special files or subdirectories in
the root directory. Other locations in the hierarchy provide
more than enough flexibility for any package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are
several reasons why introducing a new subdirectory of the
root filesystem is prohibited: It demands space on a root
partition which the system administrator may want kept small
and simple for either performance or security reasons. It
evades whatever discipline the system administrator may have
set up for distributing standard file hierarchies across
mountable volumes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Requirements</b>
<br>
The following directories, or symbolic links to directories,
are required in <tt>/</tt>. copy &quot;dirgraph.pic&quot;

sub(&quot;etc&quot;,&quot;Host-specific system
configuration&quot;) sub(&quot;lib&quot;,&quot;Essential
shared libraries and kernel modules&quot;)

<h2>/bin : Essential user command binaries (for use by all users)
<a name="/bin : Essential user command binaries (for use by all users)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<tt><br>
/bin</tt> contains commands that may be used by both the
system administrator and by users, but which are required
when no other filesystems are mounted (e.g. in single user
mode). It may also contain commands which are used
indirectly by scripts. Command binaries that are not
essential enough to place into <tt>/bin</tt> must be placed
in <tt>/usr/bin</tt>, instead. Items that are required only
by non-root users (the X Window System, <tt>chsh</tt>, etc.)
are generally not essential enough to be placed into the
root partition.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Requirements</b>
<br>
There must be no subdirectories in <tt>/bin</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
commands, or symbolic links to commands, are required in
<tt>/bin</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<tt>/bin/sh</tt> is not a true Bourne shell, it must be a
hard or symbolic link to the real shell command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <tt>[</tt>
and <tt>test</tt> commands must be placed together in either
<tt>/bin</tt> or <tt>/usr/bin</tt>. For example bash behaves
differently when called as <tt>sh</tt> or <tt>bash</tt>. The
use of a symbolic link also allows users to easily see that
<tt>/bin/sh</tt> is not a true Bourne shell.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The requirement
for the <tt>[</tt> and <tt>test</tt> commands to be included
as binaries (even if implemented internally by the shell) is
shared with the POSIX.2 standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Specific

The following programs, or symbolic links to programs, must
be in <tt>/bin</tt> if the corresponding subsystem is

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Conversely, if
no restoration from the root partition is ever expected,
then these binaries might be omitted (e.g., a ROM chip root,

<h2>/boot : Static files of the boot loader
<a name="/boot : Static files of the boot loader"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This directory contains everything required for the boot
process except configuration files and the map installer.
Thus <tt>/boot</tt> stores data that is used before the
kernel begins executing user-mode programs. This may include
saved master boot sectors, sector map files, and other data
that is not directly edited by hand. Programs necessary to
arrange for the boot loader to be able to boot a file must
be placed in <tt>/sbin</tt>. Configuration files for boot
loaders must be placed in <tt>/etc</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Specific
Options</b> <br>
The operating system kernel must be located in either
<tt>/</tt> or <tt>/boot</tt>. On some i386 machines, it may
be necessary for <tt>/boot</tt> to be located on a separate
partition located completely below cylinder 1024 of the boot
device due to hardware constraints.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Certain MIPS
systems require a <tt>/boot</tt> partition that is a mounted
MS-DOS filesystem or whatever other filesystem type is
accessible for the firmware. This may result in restrictions
with respect to usable filenames within <tt>/boot</tt> (only
for affected systems).</p>

<h2>/dev : Device files
<a name="/dev : Device files"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
The <tt>/dev</tt> directory is the location of special or
device files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Specific
Options</b> <br>
If it is possible that devices in <tt>/dev</tt> will need to
be manually created, <tt>/dev</tt> must contain a command
named <tt>MAKEDEV</tt>, which can create devices as needed.
It may also contain a <tt>MAKEDEV.local</tt> for any local
devices.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If required,
<tt>MAKEDEV</tt> must have provisions for creating any
device that may be found on the system, not just those that
a particular implementation installs.</p>

<h2>/etc : Host-specific system configuration
<a name="/etc : Host-specific system configuration"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<tt><br>
/etc</tt> contains configuration files and directories that

other models. Further specification in this area may be
added to a future version of this standard.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Requirements</b>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
Host-specific configuration files for add-on application

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<tt><br>
/etc/X11</tt> is the location for all X11 host-specific
configuration. This directory is necessary to allow local

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Specific

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Subdirectories
of <tt>/etc/X11</tt> may include those for <tt>xdm</tt> and
for any other programs (some window managers, for example)
that need them. <tt>/etc/X11/xdm</tt> holds the
configuration files for <tt>xdm</tt>. These are most of the
files previously found in <tt>/usr/lib/X11/xdm</tt>. Some
local variable data for <tt>xdm</tt> is stored in
<tt>/var/lib/xdm</tt>. We recommend that window managers
with only one configuration file which is a default
<tt>.*wmrc</tt> file must name it <tt>system.*wmrc</tt>
(unless there is a widely-accepted alternative name) and not
use a subdirectory. Any window manager subdirectories must
be identically named to the actual window manager
binary.</p>

<h2>/etc/sgml : Configuration files for SGML and XML (optional)
<a name="/etc/sgml : Configuration files for SGML and XML (optional)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
Generic configuration files defining high-level parameters
of the SGML or XML systems are installed here. Files with
names <tt>*.conf</tt> indicate generic configuration files.
File with names <tt>*.cat</tt> are the DTD-specific
centralized catalogs, containing references to all other

<h2>/home : User home directories (optional)
<a name="/home : User home directories (optional)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<tt><br>
/home</tt> is a fairly standard concept, but it is clearly a
site-specific filesystem. Different people prefer to place
user accounts in a variety of places. This section describes
only a suggested placement for user home directories;
nevertheless we recommend that all -compliant distributions
use this as the default location for home directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On small
systems, each user&rsquo;s directory is typically one of the
many subdirectories of <tt>/home</tt> such as
<tt>/home/smith</tt>, <tt>/home/torvalds</tt>,
<tt>/home/operator</tt>, etc. On large systems (especially
when the <tt>/home</tt> directories are shared amongst many
hosts using NFS) it is useful to subdivide user home
directories. Subdivision may be accomplished by using
subdirectories such as <tt>/home/staff</tt>,
<tt>/home/guests</tt>, <tt>/home/students</tt>, etc. The
setup will differ from host to host. Therefore, no program
should rely on this location. If you want to find out a
user&rsquo;s home directory, you should use the
<tt>getpwent(3)</tt> library function rather than relying on
<tt>/etc/passwd</tt> because user information may be stored
remotely using systems such as NIS.</p>

<h2>/lib : Essential shared libraries and kernel modules
<a name="/lib : Essential shared libraries and kernel modules"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
The <tt>/lib</tt> directory contains those shared library
images needed to boot the system and run the commands in the
root filesystem, ie. by binaries in <tt>/bin</tt> and
<tt>/sbin</tt>. Shared libraries that are only necessary for
binaries in <tt>/usr</tt> (such as any X Window binaries)
must not be in <tt>/lib</tt>. Only the shared libraries
required to run binaries in <tt>/bin</tt> and <tt>/sbin</tt>
may be here. In particular, the library <tt>libm.so.*</tt>
may also be placed in <tt>/usr/lib</tt> if it is not
required by anything in <tt>/bin</tt> or <tt>/sbin</tt>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Requirements</b>
<br>
At least one of each of the following filename patterns are
required (they may be files, or symbolic links):</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-319466.png" alt="Image grohtml-319466.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a C
preprocessor is installed, <tt>/lib/cpp</tt> must be a
reference to it, for historical reasons. The usual placement
of this binary is
<tt>/usr/lib/gcc-lib/&lt;target&gt;/&lt;version&gt;/cpp</tt>.
<tt>/lib/cpp</tt> can either point at this binary, or at any
other reference to this binary which exists in the
filesystem. (For example, <tt>/usr/bin/cpp</tt> is also
often used.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Specific
Options</b> <br>
The following directories, or symbolic links to directories,
must be in <tt>/lib</tt>, if the corresponding subsystem is
installed: copy &quot;dirgraph.pic&quot;
dir(&quot;/lib&quot;,&quot;essential shared libraries and
kernel modules&quot;) sub(&quot;modules&quot;,&quot;Loadable

<h2>/lib&lt;qual&gt; : Alternate format essential shared libraries (optional)
<a name="/lib&lt;qual&gt; : Alternate format essential shared libraries (optional)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
There may be one or more variants of the <tt>/lib</tt>
directory on systems which support more than one binary
format requiring separate libraries. This is commonly used
for 64-bit or 32-bit support on systems which support
multiple binary formats, but require libraries of the same
name. In this case, <tt>/lib32</tt> and <tt>/lib64</tt>
might be the library directories, and <tt>/lib</tt> a
symlink to one of them.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Requirements</b>
<br>
If one or more of these directories exist, the requirements
for their contents are the same as the normal <tt>/lib</tt>
directory, except that <tt>/lib&lt;qual&gt;/cpp</tt> is not
required. <tt>/lib&lt;qual&gt;/cpp</tt> is still permitted:
this allows the case where <tt>/lib</tt> and
<tt>/lib&lt;qual&gt;</tt> are the same (one is a symbolic
link to the other).</p>

<h2>/mnt : Mount point for a temporarily mounted filesystem
<a name="/mnt : Mount point for a temporarily mounted filesystem"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This directory is provided so that the system administrator
may temporarily mount a filesystem as needed. The content of
this directory is a local issue and should not affect the
manner in which any program is run.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This directory

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<tt><br>
/opt</tt> is reserved for the installation of add-on
application software packages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A package to be
installed in <tt>/opt</tt> must locate its static files in a
separate <tt>/opt/&lt;package&gt;</tt> directory tree, where
<tt>&lt;package&gt;</tt> is a name that describes the
software package.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Requirements</b>
<br>
copy &quot;dirgraph.pic&quot;
dir(&quot;/opt&quot;,&quot;Add-on application software
packages&quot;) sub(&quot;&lt;package&gt;&quot;,&quot;Static

<tt>/opt/doc</tt>, <tt>/opt/include</tt>,
<tt>/opt/info</tt>, <tt>/opt/lib</tt>, and <tt>/opt/man</tt>
are reserved for local system administrator use. Packages
may provide &quot;front-end&quot; files intended to be
placed in (by linking or copying) these reserved directories
by the local system administrator, but must function
normally in the absence of these reserved directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Programs to be
invoked by users must be located in the directory
<tt>/opt/&lt;package&gt;/bin</tt>. If the package includes
manual pages, they must be located in
<tt>/opt/&lt;package&gt;/man</tt> and the same substructure
as <tt>/usr/share/man</tt> must be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Package files
that are variable (change in normal operation) must be
installed in <tt>/var/opt</tt>. See the section on
<tt>/var/opt</tt> for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Host-specific
configuration files must be installed in <tt>/etc/opt</tt>.
See the section on <tt>/etc</tt> for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">No other
package files may exist outside the <tt>/opt</tt>,
<tt>/var/opt</tt>, and <tt>/etc/opt</tt> hierarchies except
for those package files that must reside in specific
locations within the filesystem tree in order to function
properly. For example, device lock files must be placed in
<tt>/var/lock</tt> and devices must be located in
<tt>/dev</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Distributions
may install software in <tt>/opt</tt>, but must not modify
or delete software installed by the local system
administrator without the assent of the local system
administrator. The use of <tt>/opt</tt> for add-on software
is a well-established practice in the community. The System
V Application Binary Interface [AT&amp;T 1990], based on the
System V Interface Definition (Third Edition), provides for
an <tt>/opt</tt> structure very similar to the one defined
here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Intel
Binary Compatibility Standard v. 2 (iBCS2) also provides a
similar structure for <tt>/opt</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Generally, all
data required to support a package on a system must be
present within <tt>/opt/&lt;package&gt;</tt>, including
files intended to be copied into
<tt>/etc/opt/&lt;package&gt;</tt> and
<tt>/var/opt/&lt;package&gt;</tt> as well as reserved
directories in <tt>/opt</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The minor
restrictions on distributions using <tt>/opt</tt> are
necessary because conflicts are possible between
distribution-installed and locally-installed software,
especially in the case of fixed pathnames found in some
binary software.</p>

<h2>/root : Home directory for the root user (optional)
<a name="/root : Home directory for the root user (optional)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
The root account&rsquo;s home directory may be determined by
developer or local preference, but this is the recommended
default location. If the home directory of the root account
is not stored on the root partition it will be necessary to
make certain it will default to <tt>/</tt> if it can not be
located.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We recommend
against using the root account for tasks that can be
performed as an unprivileged user, and that it be used
solely for system administration. For this reason, we
recommend that subdirectories for mail and other
applications not appear in the root account&rsquo;s home
directory, and that mail for administration roles such as
root, postmaster, and webmaster be forwarded to an
appropriate user.</p>

<h2>/sbin : System binaries
<a name="/sbin : System binaries"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
Utilities used for system administration (and other
root-only commands) are stored in <tt>/sbin</tt>,
<tt>/usr/sbin</tt>, and <tt>/usr/local/sbin</tt>.
<tt>/sbin</tt> contains binaries essential for booting,
restoring, recovering, and/or repairing the system in
addition to the binaries in <tt>/bin</tt>. Originally,
<tt>/sbin</tt> binaries were kept in <tt>/etc</tt>. Programs
executed after <tt>/usr</tt> is known to be mounted (when
there are no problems) are generally placed into
<tt>/usr/sbin</tt>. Locally-installed system administration
programs should be placed into <tt>/usr/local/sbin</tt>.
Deciding what things go into <tt>&quot;sbin&quot;</tt>
directories is simple: if a normal (not a system
administrator) user will ever run it directly, then it must
be placed in one of the <tt>&quot;bin&quot;</tt>
directories. Ordinary users should not have to place any of
the <tt>sbin</tt> directories in their path.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
files such as <tt>chfn</tt> which users only occasionally
use must still be placed in <tt>/usr/bin</tt>.
<tt>ping</tt>, although it is absolutely necessary for root
(network recovery and diagnosis) is often used by users and
must live in <tt>/bin</tt> for that reason.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We recommend
that users have read and execute permission for everything
in <tt>/sbin</tt> except, perhaps, certain setuid and setgid
programs. The division between <tt>/bin</tt> and
<tt>/sbin</tt> was not created for security reasons or to
prevent users from seeing the operating system, but to
provide a good partition between binaries that everyone uses
and ones that are primarily used for administration tasks.
There is no inherent security advantage in making
<tt>/sbin</tt> off-limits for users.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Requirements</b>

<h2>/tmp : Temporary files
<a name="/tmp : Temporary files"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
The <tt>/tmp</tt> directory must be made available for
programs that require temporary files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Programs must
not assume that any files or directories in <tt>/tmp</tt>
are preserved between invocations of the program. IEEE
standard P1003.2 (POSIX, part 2) makes requirements that are
similar to the above section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although data
stored in <tt>/tmp</tt> may be deleted in a site-specific
manner, it is recommended that files and directories located
in <tt>/tmp</tt> be deleted whenever the system is
booted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">added this

<h2>/usr/lib : Libraries for programming and packages
<a name="/usr/lib : Libraries for programming and packages"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<tt><br>
/usr/lib</tt> includes object files, libraries, and internal
binaries that are not intended to be executed directly by
users or shell scripts. Miscellaneous
architecture-independent application-specific static files
and subdirectories must be placed in
<tt>/usr/share</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Applications
may use a single subdirectory under <tt>/usr/lib</tt>. If an
application uses a subdirectory, all architecture-dependent
data exclusively used by the application must be placed
within that subdirectory. For example, the <tt>perl5</tt>
subdirectory for Perl 5 modules and libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Specific
Options</b> <br>
For historical reasons, <tt>/usr/lib/sendmail</tt> must be a
symbolic link to <tt>/usr/sbin/sendmail</tt> if the latter
exists. Some executable commands such as <tt>makewhatis</tt>
and <tt>sendmail</tt> have also been traditionally placed in
<tt>/usr/lib</tt>. <tt>makewhatis</tt> is an internal binary
and must be placed in a binary directory; users access only
<tt>catman</tt>. Newer <tt>sendmail</tt> binaries are now
placed by default in <tt>/usr/sbin</tt>. Additionally,
systems using a <tt>sendmail</tt>-compatible mail transfer
agent must provide <tt>/usr/sbin/sendmail</tt> as a symbolic
link to the appropriate executable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<tt>/lib/X11</tt> exists, <tt>/usr/lib/X11</tt> must be a
symbolic link to <tt>/lib/X11</tt>, or to whatever
<tt>/lib/X11</tt> is a symbolic link to. Host-specific data
for the X Window System must not be stored in
<tt>/usr/lib/X11</tt>. Host-specific configuration files
such as <tt>Xconfig</tt> or <tt>XF86Config</tt> must be
stored in <tt>/etc/X11</tt>. This includes configuration
data such as <tt>system.twmrc</tt> even if it is only made a
symbolic link to a more global configuration file (probably

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<tt><br>
/usr/lib&lt;qual&gt;</tt> performs the same role as
<tt>/usr/lib</tt> for an alternate binary format, except
that the symbolic links
<tt>/usr/lib&lt;qual&gt;/sendmail</tt> and
<tt>/usr/lib&lt;qual&gt;/X11</tt> are not required. The case
where <tt>/usr/lib</tt> and <tt>/usr/lib&lt;qual&gt;</tt>
are the same (one is a symbolic link to the other) these
files and the per-application subdirectories will exist.</p>

<h2>/usr/local : Local hierarchy
<a name="/usr/local : Local hierarchy"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
The <tt>/usr/local</tt> hierarchy is for use by the system
administrator when installing software locally. It needs to
be safe from being overwritten when the system software is
updated. It may be used for programs and data that are
shareable amongst a group of hosts, but not found in
<tt>/usr</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Locally
installed software must be placed within <tt>/usr/local</tt>
rather than <tt>/usr</tt> unless it is being installed to
replace or upgrade software in <tt>/usr</tt>. Software
placed in <tt>/</tt> or <tt>/usr</tt> may be overwritten by
system upgrades (though we recommend that distributions do
not overwrite data in <tt>/etc</tt> under these
circumstances). For this reason, local software must not be
placed outside of <tt>/usr/local</tt> without good
reason.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Requirements</b>
<br>
The following directories, or symbolic links to directories,

<h2>/usr/sbin : Non-essential standard system binaries
<a name="/usr/sbin : Non-essential standard system binaries"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This directory contains any non-essential binaries used
exclusively by the system administrator. System
administration programs that are required for system repair,
system recovery, mounting <tt>/usr</tt>, or other essential
functions must be placed in <tt>/sbin</tt> instead. Locally
installed system administration programs should be placed in
<tt>/usr/local/sbin</tt>.</p>

<h2>/usr/share : Architecture-independent data
<a name="/usr/share : Architecture-independent data"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
The <tt>/usr/share</tt> hierarchy is for all read-only

originally lived in <tt>/usr</tt> (<tt>man</tt>,
<tt>doc</tt>) or <tt>/usr/lib</tt> (<tt>dict</tt>,
<tt>terminfo</tt>, <tt>zoneinfo</tt>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This hierarchy
is intended to be shareable among all architecture platforms
of a given OS; thus, for example, a site with i386, Alpha,
and PPC platforms might maintain a single
<tt>/usr/share</tt> directory that is centrally-mounted.
Note, however, that <tt>/usr/share</tt> is generally not
intended to be shared by different OSes or by different
releases of the same OS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any program or
package which contains or requires data that doesn&rsquo;t
need to be modified should store that data in
<tt>/usr/share</tt> (or <tt>/usr/local/share</tt>, if

used in <tt>/usr/share</tt> for this purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Game data
stored in <tt>/usr/share/games</tt> must be purely static
data. Any modifiable files, such as score files, game play
logs, and so forth, should be placed in

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This directory is the home for word lists on the system;
Traditionally this directory contains only the English
<tt>words</tt> file, which is used by <tt>look(1)</tt> and
various spelling programs. <tt>words</tt> may use either
American or British spelling. The reason that only word

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Word lists for
other languages may be added using the English name for that
language, e.g., <tt>/usr/share/dict/french</tt>,
<tt>/usr/share/dict/danish</tt>, etc. These should, if
possible, use an ISO 8859 character set which is appropriate
for the language in question; if possible the Latin1 (ISO
8859-1) character set should be used (this is often not
possible).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other word

<h2>/usr/share/man : Manual pages
<a name="/usr/share/man : Manual pages"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This section details the organization for manual pages
throughout the system, including <tt>/usr/share/man</tt>.
Also refer to the section on <tt>/var/cache/man</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The primary
<tt>&lt;mandir&gt;</tt> of the system is
<tt>/usr/share/man</tt>. <tt>/usr/share/man</tt> contains
manual information for commands and data under the
<tt>/</tt> and <tt>/usr</tt> filesystems. Obviously, there
are no manual pages in <tt>/</tt> because they are not
required at boot time nor are they required in emergencies.
Really.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Manual pages
are stored in
<tt>&lt;mandir&gt;/&lt;locale&gt;/man&lt;section&gt;/&lt;arch&gt;</tt>.
An explanation of <tt>&lt;mandir&gt;</tt>,
<tt>&lt;locale&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;section&gt;</tt>, and
<tt>&lt;arch&gt;</tt> is given below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A description
of each section follows: <tt>man1</tt>: User programs <br>
Manual pages that describe publicly accessible commands are
contained in this chapter. Most program documentation that a
user will need to use is located here. <tt>man2</tt>: System
calls <br>
This section describes all of the system calls (requests for
the kernel to perform operations). <tt>man3</tt>: Library
functions and subroutines <br>
Section 3 describes program library routines that are not
direct calls to kernel services. This and chapter 2 are only
really of interest to programmers. <tt>man4</tt>: Special
files <br>
Section 4 describes the special files, related driver
functions, and networking support available in the system.
Typically, this includes the device files found in
<tt>/dev</tt> and the kernel interface to networking
protocol support. <tt>man5</tt>: File formats <br>
The formats for many data files are documented in the
section 5. This includes various include files, program
output files, and system files. <tt>man6</tt>: Games <br>
This chapter documents games, demos, and generally trivial
programs. Different people have various notions about how
essential this is. <tt>man7</tt>: Miscellaneous <br>
Manual pages that are difficult to classify are designated
as being section 7. The troff and other text processing
macro packages are found here. <tt>man8</tt>: System
administration <br>
Programs used by system administrators for system operation
and maintenance are documented here. Some of these programs
are also occasionally useful for normal users.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Specific
Options</b> <br>
The following directories, or symbolic links to directories,
must be in
<tt>/usr/share/&lt;mandir&gt;/&lt;locale&gt;</tt>, unless
they are empty: For example, if <tt>/usr/local/man</tt> has
no manual pages in section 4 (Devices), then
<tt>/usr/local/man/man4</tt> may be omitted. copy

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The component
<tt>&lt;section&gt;</tt> describes the manual section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Provisions must
be made in the structure of <tt>/usr/share/man</tt> to
support manual pages which are written in different (or
multiple) languages. These provisions must take into account
the storage and reference of these manual pages. Relevant
factors include language (including geographical-based
differences), and character code set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This naming of
language subdirectories of <tt>/usr/share/man</tt> is based
on Appendix E of the POSIX 1003.1 standard which describes
the locale identification string &mdash; the most
well-accepted method to describe a cultural environment. The
<tt>&lt;locale&gt;</tt> string is:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&lt;language&gt;[_&lt;territory&gt;][.&lt;character-set&gt;][,&lt;version&gt;]</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&lt;language&gt;</tt> field must be taken from ISO 639
(a code for the representation of names of languages). It
must be two characters wide and specified with lowercase
letters only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&lt;territory&gt;</tt> field must be the two-letter code
of ISO 3166 (a specification of representations of
countries), if possible. (Most people are familiar with the
two-letter codes used for the country codes in email
addresses.) It must be two characters wide and specified
with uppercase letters only. A major exception to this rule
is the United Kingdom, which is &lsquo;GB&rsquo; in the ISO
3166, but &lsquo;UK&rsquo; for most email addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&lt;character-set&gt;</tt> field must represent the
standard describing the character set. If the
<tt>&lt;character-set&gt;</tt> field is just a numeric
specification, the number represents the number of the
international standard describing the character set. It is
recommended that this be a numeric representation if
possible (ISO standards, especially), not include additional
punctuation symbols, and that any letters be in
lowercase.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A parameter
specifying a <tt>&lt;version&gt;</tt> of the profile may be
placed after the <tt>&lt;character-set&gt;</tt> field,
delimited by a comma. This may be used to discriminate
between different cultural needs; for instance, dictionary
order versus a more systems-oriented collating order. This
standard recommends not using the <tt>&lt;version&gt;</tt>
field, unless it is necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Systems which
use a unique language and code set for all manual pages may
omit the <tt>&lt;locale&gt;</tt> substring and store all
manual pages in <tt>&lt;mandir&gt;</tt>. For example,
systems which only have English manual pages coded with
ASCII, may store manual pages (the
<tt>man&lt;section&gt;</tt> directories) directly in
<tt>/usr/share/man</tt>. (That is the traditional
circumstance and arrangement, in fact.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Countries for
which there is a well-accepted standard character code set
may omit the <tt>&lt;character-set&gt;</tt> field, but it is
strongly recommended that it be included, especially for
countries with several competing standards.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Various
examples:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-3194611.png" alt="Image grohtml-3194611.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly,
provision must be made for manual pages which are
architecture-dependent, such as documentation on
device-drivers or low-level system administration commands.
These must be placed under an <tt>&lt;arch&gt;</tt>
directory in the appropriate <tt>man&lt;section&gt;</tt>
directory; for example, a man page for the i386
ctrlaltdel(8) command might be placed in
<tt>/usr/share/man/&lt;locale&gt;/man8/i386/ctrlaltdel.8</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Manual pages
for commands and data under <tt>/usr/local</tt> are stored
in <tt>/usr/local/man</tt>. Manual pages for X11R6 are
stored in <tt>/usr/X11R6/man</tt>. It follows that all
manual page hierarchies in the system must have the same
structure as <tt>/usr/share/man</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The cat page
sections (<tt>cat&lt;section&gt;</tt>) containing formatted
manual page entries are also found within subdirectories of
<tt>&lt;mandir&gt;/&lt;locale&gt;</tt>, but are not required
nor may they be distributed in lieu of nroff source manual
pages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The numbered
sections &quot;1&quot; through &quot;8&quot; are
traditionally defined. In general, the file name for manual
pages located within a particular section end with
<tt>.&lt;section&gt;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
some large sets of application-specific manual pages have an
additional suffix appended to the manual page filename. For
example, the MH mail handling system manual pages must have
<tt>mh</tt> appended to all MH manuals. All X Window System
manual pages must have an <tt>x</tt> appended to the
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The practice of
placing various language manual pages in appropriate
subdirectories of <tt>/usr/share/man</tt> also applies to
the other manual page hierarchies, such as
<tt>/usr/local/man</tt> and <tt>/usr/X11R6/man</tt>. (This
portion of the standard also applies later in the section on
the optional <tt>/var/cache/man</tt> structure.)</p>

Hierarchy <br>
Purpose</b> <tt><br>
/var</tt> contains variable data files. This includes spool
directories and files, administrative and logging data, and
transient and temporary files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some portions
of <tt>/var</tt> are not shareable between different
systems. For instance, <tt>/var/log</tt>,
<tt>/var/lock</tt>, and <tt>/var/run</tt>. Other portions
may be shared, notably <tt>/var/mail</tt>,
<tt>/var/cache/man</tt>, <tt>/var/cache/fonts</tt>, and
<tt>/var/spool/news</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>/var</tt>
is specified here in order to make it possible to mount
<tt>/usr</tt> read-only. Everything that once went into
<tt>/usr</tt> that is written to during system operation (as
opposed to installation and software maintenance) must be in
<tt>/var</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<tt>/var</tt> cannot be made a separate partition, it is
often preferable to move <tt>/var</tt> out of the root
partition and into the <tt>/usr</tt> partition. (This is
sometimes done to reduce the size of the root partition or
when space runs low in the root partition.) However,
<tt>/var</tt> must not be linked to <tt>/usr</tt> because
this makes separation of <tt>/usr</tt> and <tt>/var</tt>
more difficult and is likely to create a naming conflict.
Instead, link <tt>/var</tt> to <tt>/usr/var</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Applications
must generally not add directories to the top level of
<tt>/var</tt>. Such directories should only be added if they
have some system-wide implication, and in consultation with

<h2>/var/cache : Application cache data
<a name="/var/cache : Application cache data"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<tt><br>
/var/cache</tt> is intended for cached data from
applications. Such data is locally generated as a result of
time-consuming I/O or calculation. The application must be
able to regenerate or restore the data. Unlike
<tt>/var/spool</tt>, the cached files can be deleted without
data loss. The data must remain valid between invocations of
the application and rebooting the system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Files located
under <tt>/var/cache</tt> may be expired in an application
specific manner, by the system administrator, or both. The
application must always be able to recover from manual
deletion of these files (generally because of a disk space
shortage). No other requirements are made on the data format
of the cache directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The existence
of a separate directory for cached data allows system
administrators to set different disk and backup policies
from other directories in <tt>/var</tt>.</p>

<h2>/var/cache/fonts : Locally-generated fonts (optional)
<a name="/var/cache/fonts : Locally-generated fonts (optional)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
The directory <tt>/var/cache/fonts</tt> should be used to
store any dynamically-created fonts. In particular, all of
the fonts which are automatically generated by
<tt>mktexpk</tt> must be located in appropriately-named
subdirectories of <tt>/var/cache/fonts</tt>. This standard
does not currently incorporate the Directory Structure (a
document that describes the layout files and directories),
but it may be useful reading. It is located at
<tt>ftp://ctan.tug.org/tex/</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Specific
Options</b> <br>
Other dynamically created fonts may also be placed in this
tree, under appropriately-named subdirectories of
<tt>/var/cache/fonts</tt>.</p>

<h2>/var/cache/man : Locally-formatted manual pages (optional)
<a name="/var/cache/man : Locally-formatted manual pages (optional)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This directory provides a standard location for sites that
provide a read-only <tt>/usr</tt> partition, but wish to
allow caching of locally-formatted man pages. Sites that
mount <tt>/usr</tt> as writable (e.g., single-user
installations) may choose not to use <tt>/var/cache/man</tt>
and may write formatted man pages into the
<tt>cat&lt;section&gt;</tt> directories in
<tt>/usr/share/man</tt> directly. We recommend that most
sites use one of the following options instead: Preformat
all manual pages alongside the unformatted versions. Allow
no caching of formatted man pages, and require formatting to
be done each time a man page is brought up. Allow local
caching of formatted man pages in
<tt>/var/cache/man</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The structure
of <tt>/var/cache/man</tt> needs to reflect both the fact of
multiple man page hierarchies and the possibility of
multiple language support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Given an
unformatted manual page that normally appears in
<tt>&lt;path&gt;/man/&lt;locale&gt;/man&lt;section&gt;</tt>,
the directory to place formatted man pages in is
<tt>/var/cache/man/&lt;catpath&gt;/&lt;locale&gt;/cat&lt;section&gt;</tt>,
where <tt>&lt;catpath&gt;</tt> is derived from
<tt>&lt;path&gt;</tt> by removing any leading <tt>usr</tt>
and/or trailing <tt>share</tt> pathname components. (Note
that the <tt>&lt;locale&gt;</tt> component may be missing.)
For example, <tt>/usr/share/man/man1/ls.1</tt> is formatted
into <tt>/var/cache/man/cat1/ls.1</tt>, and
<tt>/usr/X11R6/man/&lt;locale&gt;/man3/XtClass.3x</tt> into
<tt>/var/cache/man/X11R6/&lt;locale&gt;/cat3/XtClass.3x</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Man pages
written to <tt>/var/cache/man</tt> may eventually be
transferred to the appropriate preformatted directories in
the source <tt>man</tt> hierarchy or expired; likewise
formatted man pages in the source <tt>man</tt> hierarchy may
be expired if they are not accessed for a period of
time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If preformatted
manual pages come with a system on read-only media (a
CD-ROM, for instance), they must be installed in the source
<tt>man</tt> hierarchy (e.g.
<tt>/usr/share/man/cat&lt;section&gt;</tt>).
<tt>/var/cache/man</tt> is reserved as a writable cache for
formatted manual pages. Release 1.2 of the standard
specified <tt>/var/catman</tt> for this hierarchy. The path
has been moved under <tt>/var/cache</tt> to better reflect
the dynamic nature of the formatted man pages. The directory
name has been changed to <tt>man</tt> to allow for enhancing
the hierarchy to include post-processed formats other than
&quot;cat&quot;, such as PostScript, HTML, or DVI.</p>

<h2>/var/crash : System crash dumps (optional)
<a name="/var/crash : System crash dumps (optional)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This directory holds system crash dumps. As of the date of
this release of the standard, system crash dumps were not
supported under Linux.</p>

<h2>/var/games : Variable game data (optional)
<a name="/var/games : Variable game data (optional)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
Any variable data relating to games in <tt>/usr</tt> should
be placed here. <tt>/var/games</tt> should hold the variable
data previously found in <tt>/usr</tt>; static data, such as
help text, level descriptions, and so on, must remain
elsewhere, such as <tt>/usr/share/games</tt>.
<tt>/var/games</tt> has been given a hierarchy of its own,
rather than leaving it merged in with the old
<tt>/var/lib</tt> as in release 1.2. The separation allows
local control of backup strategies, permissions, and disk
usage, as well as allowing inter-host sharing and reducing
clutter in <tt>/var/lib</tt>. Additionally,
<tt>/var/games</tt> is the path traditionally used by
BSD.</p>

<h2>/var/lib : Variable state information
<a name="/var/lib : Variable state information"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This hierarchy holds state information pertaining to an
application or the system. State information is data that
programs modify while they run, and that pertains to one
specific host. Users must never need to modify files in
<tt>/var/lib</tt> to configure a package&rsquo;s
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">State
information is generally used to preserve the condition of
an application (or a group of inter-related applications)
between invocations and between different instances of the
same application. State information should generally remain
valid after a reboot, should not be logging output, and
should not be spooled data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An application
(or a group of inter-related applications) must use a
subdirectory of <tt>/var/lib</tt> for its data. There is one
required subdirectory, <tt>/var/lib/misc</tt>, which is
intended for state files that don&rsquo;t need a
subdirectory; the other subdirectories should only be
present if the application in question is included in the
distribution. An important difference between this version
of this standard and previous ones is that applications are
now required to use a subdirectory of <tt>/var/lib</tt>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>/var/lib/&lt;name&gt;</tt>
is the location that must be used for all distribution
packaging support. Different distributions may use different
names, of course.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Requirements</b>
<br>
The following directories, or symbolic links to directories,
are required in <tt>/var/lib</tt>: copy

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Specific
Options</b> <br>
The following directories, or symbolic links to directories,
must be in <tt>/var/lib</tt>, if the corresponding subsystem
is installed: copy &quot;dirgraph.pic&quot;
dir(&quot;/var/lib&quot;,&quot;Variable state

sub(&quot;hwclock&quot;,&quot;State directory for hwclock

<h2>/var/lib/&lt;editor&gt; : Editor backup files and state (optional)
<a name="/var/lib/&lt;editor&gt; : Editor backup files and state (optional)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
These directories contain saved files generated by any
unexpected termination of an editor (e.g., elvis, jove,
nvi).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other editors
may not require a directory for crash-recovery files, but
may require a well-defined place to store other information
while the editor is running. This information should be
stored in a subdirectory under <tt>/var/lib</tt> (for
example, GNU Emacs would place lock files in
<tt>/var/lib/emacs/lock</tt>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Future editors
may require additional state information beyond
crash-recovery files and lock files &mdash; this information
should also be placed under
<tt>/var/lib/&lt;editor&gt;</tt>. Previous Linux releases,
as well as all commercial vendors, use
<tt>/var/preserve</tt> for vi or its clones. However, each
editor uses its own format for these crash-recovery files,
so a separate directory is needed for each editor.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Editor-specific
lock files are usually quite different from the device or
resource lock files that are stored in <tt>/var/lock</tt>
and, hence, are stored under <tt>/var/lib</tt>.</p>

<h2>/var/lib/hwclock : State directory for hwclock (optional)
<a name="/var/lib/hwclock : State directory for hwclock (optional)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This directory contains the file
<tt>/var/lib/hwclock/adjtime</tt>. In 2.1, this file was
<tt>/etc/adjtime</tt>, but as <tt>hwclock</tt> updates it,
that was obviously incorrect.</p>

<h2>/var/lib/misc : Miscellaneous variable data
<a name="/var/lib/misc : Miscellaneous variable data"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This directory contains variable data not placed in a
subdirectory in <tt>/var/lib</tt>. An attempt should be made
to use relatively unique names in this directory to avoid
namespace conflicts. This hierarchy should contain files
stored in <tt>/var/db</tt> in current BSD releases. These
include <tt>locate.database</tt> and <tt>mountdtab</tt>, and
the kernel symbol database(s).</p>

<h2>/var/lock : Lock files
<a name="/var/lock : Lock files"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
Lock files should be stored within the <tt>/var/lock</tt>
directory structure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Lock files for
devices and other resources shared by multiple applications,
such as the serial device lock files that were originally
found in either <tt>/usr/spool/locks</tt> or
<tt>/usr/spool/uucp</tt>, must now be stored in
<tt>/var/lock</tt>. The naming convention which must be used
is &quot;LCK..&quot; followed by the base name of the
device. For example, to lock /dev/ttyS0 the file
&quot;LCK..ttyS0&quot; would be created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then, anything
wishing to use <tt>/dev/ttyS0</tt> can read the lock file
and act accordingly (all locks in <tt>/var/lock</tt> should
be world-readable).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format used
for the contents of such lock files must be the HDB UUCP
lock file format. The HDB format is to store the process
identifier (PID) as a ten byte ASCII decimal number, with a
trailing newline. For example, if process 1230 holds a lock
file, it would contain the eleven characters: space, space,
space, space, space, space, one, two, three, zero, and
newline.</p>

<h2>/var/log : Log files and directories
<a name="/var/log : Log files and directories"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This directory contains miscellaneous log files. Most logs
must be written to this directory or an appropriate
subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Specific
Options</b> <br>
The following files, or symbolic links to files, must be in
<tt>/var/log</tt>, if the corresponding subsystem is
installed:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-3194613.png" alt="Image grohtml-3194613.png"></p>

<h2>/var/mail : User mailbox files (optional)
<a name="/var/mail : User mailbox files (optional)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
The mail spool must be accessible through <tt>/var/mail</tt>
and the mail spool files must take the form
<tt>&lt;username&gt;</tt>. Note that <tt>/var/mail</tt> may
be a symbolic link to another directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">User mailbox
files in this location must be stored in the standard <br>
mailbox format. The logical location for this directory was
changed from <tt>/var/spool/mail</tt> in order to bring
in-line with nearly every implementation. This change is
important for inter-operability since a single
<tt>/var/mail</tt> is often shared between multiple hosts
and multiple implementations (despite NFS locking
issues).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is important
to note that there is no requirement to physically move the
mail spool to this location. However, programs and header
files must be changed to use <tt>/var/mail</tt>.</p>

<h2>/var/opt : Variable data for /opt
<a name="/var/opt : Variable data for /opt"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
Variable data of the packages in <tt>/opt</tt> must be
installed in <tt>/var/opt/&lt;package&gt;</tt>, where
<tt>&lt;package&gt;</tt> is the name of the subtree in
<tt>/opt</tt> where the static data from an add-on software
package is stored, except where superseded by another file
in <tt>/etc</tt>. No structure is imposed on the internal
arrangement of <tt>/var/opt/&lt;package&gt;</tt>. Refer to
the rationale for <tt>/opt</tt>.</p>

<h2>/var/run : Run-time variable data
<a name="/var/run : Run-time variable data"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This directory contains system information data describing
the system since it was booted. Files under this directory
must be cleared (removed or truncated as appropriate) at the
beginning of the boot process. Programs may have a
subdirectory of <tt>/var/run</tt>; this is encouraged for
programs that use more than one run-time file.
<tt>/var/run</tt> should be unwritable for unprivileged
users (root or users running daemons); it is a major
security problem if any user can write in this directory.
Process identifier (PID) files, which were originally placed
in <tt>/etc</tt>, must be placed in <tt>/var/run</tt>. The
naming convention for PID files is
<tt>&lt;program-name&gt;.pid</tt>. For example, the
<tt>crond</tt> PID file is named
<tt>/var/run/crond.pid</tt>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Requirements</b>
<br>
The internal format of PID files remains unchanged. The file
must consist of the process identifier in ASCII-encoded
decimal, followed by a newline character. For example, if
<tt>crond</tt> was process number 25,
<tt>/var/run/crond.pid</tt> would contain three characters:
two, five, and newline.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Programs that
read PID files should be somewhat flexible in what they
accept; i.e., they should ignore extra whitespace, leading
zeroes, absence of the trailing newline, or additional lines
in the PID file. Programs that create PID files should use
the simple specification located in the above paragraph.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>utmp</tt> file, which stores information about who is
currently using the system, is located in this
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Programs that
maintain transient -domain sockets must place them in this
directory.</p>

<h2>/var/spool : Application spool data
<a name="/var/spool : Application spool data"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<tt><br>
/var/spool</tt> contains data which is awaiting some kind of
later processing. Data in <tt>/var/spool</tt> represents
work to be done in the future (by a program, user, or
administrator); often data is deleted after it has been
processed. UUCP lock files must be placed in
<tt>/var/lock</tt>. See the above section on
<tt>/var/lock</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Specific

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This directory holds the <tt>rwhod</tt> information for
other systems on the local net. Some BSD releases use
<tt>/var/rwho</tt> for this data; given its historical
location in <tt>/var/spool</tt> on other systems and its
approximate fit to the definition of &lsquo;spooled&rsquo;

<h2>/var/tmp : Temporary files preserved between system reboots
<a name="/var/tmp : Temporary files preserved between system reboots"></a>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
The <tt>/var/tmp</tt> directory is made available for
programs that require temporary files or directories that
are preserved between system reboots. Therefore, data stored
in <tt>/var/tmp</tt> is more persistent than data in
<tt>/tmp</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Files and
directories located in <tt>/var/tmp</tt> must not be deleted
when the system is booted. Although data stored in
<tt>/var/tmp</tt> is typically deleted in a site-specific
manner, it is recommended that deletions occur at a less
frequent interval than <tt>/tmp</tt>.</p>

<br>
Variable data for the Network Information Service (NIS),
formerly known as the Sun Yellow Pages (YP), must be placed
in this directory. <tt>/var/yp</tt> is the standard

not get updated if local changes are made in hardware. When

can act as a guiding hand in upgrading the dynamic

may be.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>ldconfig</tt> binary is optional for <tt>/sbin</tt>
since a site may choose to run <tt>ldconfig</tt> at boot

(It&rsquo;s not clear whether or not it is advantageous to
run <tt>ldconfig</tt> on each boot.) Even so, some people
like <tt>ldconfig</tt> around for the following (all too
common) situation: I&rsquo;ve just removed
<tt>/lib/&lt;file&gt;</tt>. I can&rsquo;t find out the name
of the library because <tt>ls</tt> is dynamically linked,
I&rsquo;m using a shell that doesn&rsquo;t have <tt>ls</tt>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since the

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Background
of the</b> <br>
The process of developing a standard filesystem hierarchy
began in August 1993 with an effort to restructure the file
and directory structure of Linux. The FSSTND, a filesystem
hierarchy standard specific to the Linux operating system,
was released on February 14, 1994. Subsequent revisions were
released on October 9, 1994 and March 28, 1995.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In early 1995,
the goal of developing a more comprehensive version of
FSSTND to address not only Linux, but other -like systems
was adopted with the help of members of the BSD development
community. As a result, a concerted effort was made to focus
on issues that were general to -like systems. In recognition
of this widening of scope, the name of the standard was
changed to Filesystem Hierarchy Standard or for short.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Volunteers who
have contributed extensively to this standard are listed at
the end of this document. This standard represents a
consensus view of those and other contributors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>General
Guidelines</b> <br>
Here are some of the guidelines that have been used in the
development of this standard: Solve technical problems while
limiting transitional difficulties. Make the specification
reasonably stable. Gain the approval of distributors,
developers, and other decision-makers in relevant
development groups and encourage their participation.
Provide a standard that is attractive to the implementors of
different -like systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Scope</b>
<br>
This document specifies a standard filesystem hierarchy for
filesystems by specifying the location of files and
directories, and the contents of some system files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This standard
has been designed to be used by system integrators, package
developers, and system administrators in the construction
and maintenance of compliant filesystems. It is primarily
intended to be a reference and is not a tutorial on how to
manage a conforming filesystem hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The grew out of
earlier work on FSSTND, a filesystem organization standard
for the Linux operating system. It builds on FSSTND to
address interoperability issues not just in the Linux
community but in a wider arena including 4.4BSD-based
operating systems. It incorporates lessons learned in the
BSD world and elsewhere about multi-architecture support and
the demands of heterogeneous networking.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although this
standard is more comprehensive than previous attempts at
filesystem hierarchy standardization, periodic updates may
become necessary as requirements change in relation to
emerging technology. It is also possible that better
solutions to the problems addressed here will be discovered
so that our solutions will no longer be the best possible
solutions. Supplementary drafts may be released in addition
to periodic updates to this document. However, a specific
goal is backwards compatibility from one release of this
document to the next.</p>

<br>
Purpose</b> <br>
This standard enables Software to predict the location of
installed files and directories, and Users to predict the
location of installed files and directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We do this by
Specifying guiding principles for each area of the
filesystem, Specifying the minimum files and directories
required, Enumerating exceptions to the principles, and
Enumerating specific cases where there has been historical
conflict.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The FHS
document is used by Independent software suppliers to create
applications which are FHS compliant, and work with
distributions which are FHS complaint, OS creators to
provide systems which are FHS compliant, and Users to
understand and maintain the FHS compliance of a system.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Conventions</b>
<br>
We recommend that you read a typeset version of this
document rather than the plain text version. In the typeset
version, the names of files and directories are displayed in
a constant-width font.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Components of
filenames that vary are represented by a description of the
contents enclosed in &quot;<tt>&lt;</tt>&quot; and
&quot;<tt>&gt;</tt>&quot; characters, <tt>&lt;thus&gt;</tt>.
Electronic mail addresses are also enclosed in
&quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; but are shown in the
usual typeface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Optional
components of filenames are enclosed in
&quot;<tt>[</tt>&quot; and &quot;<tt>]</tt>&quot; characters
and may be combined with the &quot;<tt>&lt;</tt>&quot; and
&quot;<tt>&gt;</tt>&quot; convention. For example, if a
filename is allowed to occur either with or without an
extension, it might be represented by
<tt>&lt;filename&gt;[.&lt;extension&gt;]</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Variable
substrings of directory names and filenames are indicated by
&quot;<tt>*</tt>&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
Filesystem</b> <br>
This standard assumes that the operating system underlying
an FHS-compliant file system supports the same basic
security features found in most UNIX filesystems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
to define two independent categories of files: shareable vs.
unshareable and variable vs. static. There should be a
simple and easily understandable mapping from directories to
the type of data they contain: directories may be mount
points for other filesystems with different characteristics
from the filesystem on which they are mounted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Shareable data
is that which can be shared between several different hosts;
unshareable is that which must be specific to a particular
host. For example, user home directories are shareable data,
but device lock files are not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Static data
includes binaries, libraries, documentation, and anything
that does not change without system administrator
intervention; variable data is anything else that does
change without system administrator intervention.</p>

<h2>BEGIN RATIONALE
<a name="BEGIN RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The distinction
between shareable and unshareable data is needed for several
reasons: In a networked environment (i.e., more than one
host at a site), there is a good deal of data that can be
shared between different hosts to save space and ease the
task of maintenance. In a networked environment, certain
files contain information specific to a single host.
Therefore these filesystems cannot be shared (without taking
special measures). Historical implementations of UNIX-like
filesystems interspersed shareable and unshareable data in
the same hierarchy, making it difficult to share large
portions of the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;shareable&quot; distinction can be used to support,
for example: A <tt>/usr</tt> partition (or components of
<tt>/usr</tt>) mounted (read-only) through the network
(using NFS). A <tt>/usr</tt> partition (or components of
<tt>/usr</tt>) mounted from read-only media. A CD-ROM is one
copy of many identical ones distributed to other users by
the postal mail system and other methods. It can thus be
regarded as a read-only filesystem shared with other
FHS-compliant systems by some kind of
&quot;network&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;static&quot; versus &quot;variable&quot; distinction
affects the filesystem in two major ways: Since <tt>/</tt>
contains both variable and static data, it needs to be
mounted read-write. Since the traditional <tt>/usr</tt>
contains both variable and static data, and since we may
want to mount it read-only (see above), it is necessary to
provide a method to have <tt>/usr</tt> mounted read-only.
This is done through the creation of a <tt>/var</tt>
hierarchy that is mounted read-write (or is a part of
another read-write partition, such as <tt>/)</tt>, taking
over much of the <tt>/usr</tt> partition&rsquo;s traditional
functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is a
summarizing chart. This chart is only an example for a
common FHS-compliant system, other chart layouts are
possible within FHS-compliance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The Root
Filesystem <br>
Purpose</b> <br>
The contents of the root filesystem must be adequate to
boot, restore, recover, and/or repair the system. To boot a
system, enough must be present on the root partition to
mount other filesystems. This includes utilities,
configuration, boot loader information, and other essential
start-up data. <tt>/usr</tt>, <tt>/opt</tt>, and
<tt>/var</tt> are designed such that they may be located on
other partitions or filesystems. To enable recovery and/or
repair of a system, those utilities needed by an experienced
maintainer to diagnose and reconstruct a damaged system must
be present on the root filesystem. To restore a system,
those utilities needed to restore from system backups (on
floppy, tape, etc.) must be present on the root
filesystem.</p>

<h2>BEGIN RATIONALE
<a name="BEGIN RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The primary
concern used to balance these considerations, which favor
placing many things on the root filesystem, is the goal of
keeping root as small as reasonably possible. For several
reasons, it is desirable to keep the root filesystem small:
It is occasionally mounted from very small media. The root
filesystem contains many system-specific configuration
files. Possible examples include a kernel that is specific
to the system, a specific hostname, etc. This means that the
root filesystem isn&rsquo;t always shareable between
networked systems. Keeping it small on servers in networked
systems minimizes the amount of lost space for areas of
unshareable files. It also allows workstations with smaller
local hard drives. While you may have the root filesystem on
a large partition, and may be able to fill it to your
heart&rsquo;s content, there will be people with smaller
partitions. If you have more files installed, you may find
incompatibilities with other systems using root filesystems
on smaller partitions. If you are a developer then you may
be turning your assumption into a problem for a large number
of users. Disk errors that corrupt data on the root
filesystem are a greater problem than errors on any other
partition. A small root filesystem is less prone to
corruption as the result of a system crash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Software must
never create or require special files or subdirectories in
the root directory. Other locations in the FHS hierarchy
provide more than enough flexibility for any package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are
several reasons why introducing a new subdirectory of the
root filesystem is prohibited: It demands space on a root
partition which the system administrator may want kept small
and simple for either performance or security reasons. It
evades whatever discipline the system administrator may have
set up for distributing standard file hierarchies across
mountable volumes.</p>

<br>
This directory contains everything required for the boot
process except configuration files and the map installer.
Thus <tt>/boot</tt> stores data that is used before the
kernel begins executing user-mode programs. This may include
saved master boot sectors, sector map files, and other data
that is not directly edited by hand. Programs necessary to

be placed in <tt>/sbin</tt>. Configuration files for boot
loaders must be placed in <tt>/etc</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Specific

<h2>/home : User home directories (optional)
<a name="/home : User home directories (optional)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<tt><br>
/home</tt> is a fairly standard concept, but it is clearly a
site-specific filesystem. Different people prefer to place
user accounts in a variety of places. This section describes
only a suggested placement for user home directories;
nevertheless we recommend that all FHS-compliant
distributions use this as the default location for home
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On small
systems, each user&rsquo;s directory is typically one of the
many subdirectories of <tt>/home</tt> such as
<tt>/home/smith</tt>, <tt>/home/torvalds</tt>,
<tt>/home/operator</tt>, etc. On large systems (especially
when the <tt>/home</tt> directories are shared amongst many
hosts using NFS) it is useful to subdivide user home
directories. Subdivision may be accomplished by using
subdirectories such as <tt>/home/staff</tt>,
<tt>/home/guests</tt>, <tt>/home/students</tt>, etc. The
setup will differ from host to host. Therefore, no program
should rely on this location. If you want to find out a
user&rsquo;s home directory, you should use the
<tt>getpwent(3)</tt> library function rather than relying on
<tt>/etc/passwd</tt> because user information may be stored
remotely using systems such as NIS.</p>

<h2>/lib : Essential shared libraries and kernel modules
<a name="/lib : Essential shared libraries and kernel modules"></a>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
The <tt>/lib</tt> directory contains those shared library
images needed to boot the system and run the commands in the
root filesystem, ie. by binaries in <tt>/bin</tt> and
<tt>/sbin</tt>. Shared libraries that are only necessary for
binaries in <tt>/usr</tt> (such as any X Window binaries)
must not be in <tt>/lib</tt>. Only the shared libraries
required to run binaries in <tt>/bin</tt> and <tt>/sbin</tt>
may be here. In particular, the library <tt>libm.so.*</tt>

required by anything in <tt>/bin</tt> or <tt>/sbin</tt>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Requirements</b>
<br>
At least one of each of the following filename patterns are
required (they may be files, or symbolic links):</p>

<tt>/lib/cpp</tt> can either point at this binary, or at any
other reference to this binary which exists in the

<a name="/lib&lt;qual&gt; : Alternate format essential shared libraries (optional)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
There may be one or more variants of the <tt>/lib</tt>
directory on systems which support more than one binary
format requiring separate libraries. This is commonly used
for 64-bit or 32-bit support on systems which support
multiple binary formats, but require libraries of the same
name. In this case, <tt>/lib32</tt> and <tt>/lib64</tt>
might be the library directories, and <tt>/lib</tt> a
symlink to one of them.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Requirements</b>
<br>
If one or more of these directories exist, the requirements
for their contents are the same as the normal <tt>/lib</tt>
directory, except that <tt>/lib&lt;qual&gt;/cpp</tt> is not
required. <tt>/lib&lt;qual&gt;/cpp</tt> is still permitted:
this allows the case where <tt>/lib</tt> and

by the local system administrator, but must function
normally in the absence of these reserved directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Programs to be

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The use of

practice in the UNIX community. The System V Application
Binary Interface [AT&amp;T 1990], based on the System V

<tt>/opt</tt> structure very similar to the one defined
here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Intel

<h2>/root : Home directory for the root user (optional)
<a name="/root : Home directory for the root user (optional)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
The root account&rsquo;s home directory may be determined by
developer or local preference, but this is the recommended
default location. If the home directory of the root account
is not stored on the root partition it will be necessary to
make certain it will default to <tt>/</tt> if it can not be
located.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We recommend
against using the root account for tasks that can be
performed as an unprivileged user, and that it be used
solely for system administration. For this reason, we
recommend that subdirectories for mail and other
applications not appear in the root account&rsquo;s home
directory, and that mail for administration roles such as
root, postmaster, and webmaster be forwarded to an
appropriate user.</p>

<h2>/sbin : System binaries
<a name="/sbin : System binaries"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
Utilities used for system administration (and other
root-only commands) are stored in <tt>/sbin</tt>,
<tt>/usr/sbin</tt>, and <tt>/usr/local/sbin</tt>.
<tt>/sbin</tt> contains binaries essential for booting,
restoring, recovering, and/or repairing the system in
addition to the binaries in <tt>/bin</tt>. Originally,
<tt>/sbin</tt> binaries were kept in <tt>/etc</tt>. Programs
executed after <tt>/usr</tt> is known to be mounted (when
there are no problems) are generally placed into
<tt>/usr/sbin</tt>. Locally-installed system administration
programs should be placed into <tt>/usr/local/sbin</tt>.
Deciding what things go into <tt>&quot;sbin&quot;</tt>
directories is simple: if a normal (not a system
administrator) user will ever run it directly, then it must
be placed in one of the <tt>&quot;bin&quot;</tt>
directories. Ordinary users should not have to place any of
the <tt>sbin</tt> directories in their path.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
files such as <tt>chfn</tt> which users only occasionally
use must still be placed in <tt>/usr/bin</tt>.
<tt>ping</tt>, although it is absolutely necessary for root
(network recovery and diagnosis) is often used by users and
must live in <tt>/bin</tt> for that reason.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We recommend
that users have read and execute permission for everything
in <tt>/sbin</tt> except, perhaps, certain setuid and setgid
programs. The division between <tt>/bin</tt> and
<tt>/sbin</tt> was not created for security reasons or to
prevent users from seeing the operating system, but to
provide a good partition between binaries that everyone uses
and ones that are primarily used for administration tasks.
There is no inherent security advantage in making
<tt>/sbin</tt> off-limits for users.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<tt><br>
/usr/lib</tt> includes object files, libraries, and internal
binaries that are not intended to be executed directly by
users or shell scripts. Miscellaneous
architecture-independent application-specific static files
and subdirectories must be placed in
<tt>/usr/share</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Applications
may use a single subdirectory under <tt>/usr/lib</tt>. If an
application uses a subdirectory, all architecture-dependent
data exclusively used by the application must be placed
within that subdirectory. For example, the <tt>perl5</tt>
subdirectory for Perl 5 modules and libraries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Specific
Options</b> <br>
For historical reasons, <tt>/usr/lib/sendmail</tt> must be a
symbolic link to <tt>/usr/sbin/sendmail</tt> if the latter
exists. Some executable commands such as <tt>makewhatis</tt>
and <tt>sendmail</tt> have also been traditionally placed in
<tt>/usr/lib</tt>. <tt>makewhatis</tt> is an internal binary
and must be placed in a binary directory; users access only
<tt>catman</tt>. Newer <tt>sendmail</tt> binaries are now
placed by default in <tt>/usr/sbin</tt>. Additionally,
systems using a <tt>sendmail</tt>-compatible mail transfer
agent must provide <tt>/usr/sbin/sendmail</tt> as a symbolic
link to the appropriate executable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<tt>/lib/X11</tt> exists, <tt>/usr/lib/X11</tt> must be a
symbolic link to <tt>/lib/X11</tt>, or to whatever
<tt>/lib/X11</tt> is a symbolic link to. Host-specific data
for the X Window System must not be stored in
<tt>/usr/lib/X11</tt>. Host-specific configuration files
such as <tt>Xconfig</tt> or <tt>XF86Config</tt> must be
stored in <tt>/etc/X11</tt>. This includes configuration

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<tt><br>
/usr/lib&lt;qual&gt;</tt> performs the same role as

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
The <tt>/usr/local</tt> hierarchy is for use by the system
administrator when installing software locally. It needs to
be safe from being overwritten when the system software is
updated. It may be used for programs and data that are
shareable amongst a group of hosts, but not found in
<tt>/usr</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Locally
installed software must be placed within <tt>/usr/local</tt>
rather than <tt>/usr</tt> unless it is being installed to
replace or upgrade software in <tt>/usr</tt>. Software
placed in <tt>/</tt> or <tt>/usr</tt> may be overwritten by
system upgrades (though we recommend that distributions do
not overwrite data in <tt>/etc</tt> under these
circumstances). For this reason, local software must not be
placed outside of <tt>/usr/local</tt> without good
reason.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Requirements</b>

<h2>/usr/sbin : Non-essential standard system binaries
<a name="/usr/sbin : Non-essential standard system binaries"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This directory contains any non-essential binaries used
exclusively by the system administrator. System
administration programs that are required for system repair,
system recovery, mounting <tt>/usr</tt>, or other essential
functions must be placed in <tt>/sbin</tt> instead. Locally
installed system administration programs should be placed in
<tt>/usr/local/sbin</tt>.</p>

<h2>/usr/share : Architecture-independent data
<a name="/usr/share : Architecture-independent data"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
The <tt>/usr/share</tt> hierarchy is for all read-only
architecture independent data files. Much of this data
originally lived in <tt>/usr</tt> (<tt>man</tt>,
<tt>doc</tt>) or <tt>/usr/lib</tt> (<tt>dict</tt>,
<tt>terminfo</tt>, <tt>zoneinfo</tt>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This hierarchy
is intended to be shareable among all architecture platforms
of a given OS; thus, for example, a site with i386, Alpha,
and PPC platforms might maintain a single
<tt>/usr/share</tt> directory that is centrally-mounted.
Note, however, that <tt>/usr/share</tt> is generally not
intended to be shared by different OSes or by different
releases of the same OS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any program or
package which contains or requires data that doesn&rsquo;t
need to be modified should store that data in
<tt>/usr/share</tt> (or <tt>/usr/local/share</tt>, if
installed locally). It is recommended that a subdirectory be
used in <tt>/usr/share</tt> for this purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Game data
stored in <tt>/usr/share/games</tt> must be purely static
data. Any modifiable files, such as score files, game play
logs, and so forth, should be placed in
<tt>/var/games</tt>.</p>

<h2>/usr/share/man : Manual pages

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This section details the organization for manual pages
throughout the system, including <tt>/usr/share/man</tt>.
Also refer to the section on <tt>/var/cache/man</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The primary
<tt>&lt;mandir&gt;</tt> of the system is
<tt>/usr/share/man</tt>. <tt>/usr/share/man</tt> contains
manual information for commands and data under the
<tt>/</tt> and <tt>/usr</tt> filesystems. Obviously, there
are no manual pages in <tt>/</tt> because they are not
required at boot time nor are they required in emergencies.
Really.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Manual pages
are stored in
<tt>&lt;mandir&gt;/&lt;locale&gt;/man&lt;section&gt;/&lt;arch&gt;</tt>.
An explanation of <tt>&lt;mandir&gt;</tt>,
<tt>&lt;locale&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;section&gt;</tt>, and
<tt>&lt;arch&gt;</tt> is given below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A description
of each section follows: <tt>man1</tt>: User programs <br>
Manual pages that describe publicly accessible commands are
contained in this chapter. Most program documentation that a
user will need to use is located here. <tt>man2</tt>: System
calls <br>
This section describes all of the system calls (requests for
the kernel to perform operations). <tt>man3</tt>: Library
functions and subroutines <br>
Section 3 describes program library routines that are not
direct calls to kernel services. This and chapter 2 are only
really of interest to programmers. <tt>man4</tt>: Special
files <br>
Section 4 describes the special files, related driver
functions, and networking support available in the system.
Typically, this includes the device files found in
<tt>/dev</tt> and the kernel interface to networking
protocol support. <tt>man5</tt>: File formats <br>
The formats for many data files are documented in the
section 5. This includes various include files, program
output files, and system files. <tt>man6</tt>: Games <br>
This chapter documents games, demos, and generally trivial
programs. Different people have various notions about how
essential this is. <tt>man7</tt>: Miscellaneous <br>
Manual pages that are difficult to classify are designated
as being section 7. The troff and other text processing
macro packages are found here. <tt>man8</tt>: System
administration <br>
Programs used by system administrators for system operation
and maintenance are documented here. Some of these programs
are also occasionally useful for normal users.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Specific
Options</b> <br>
The following directories, or symbolic links to directories,
must be in
<tt>/usr/share/&lt;mandir&gt;/&lt;locale&gt;</tt>, unless
they are empty: For example, if <tt>/usr/local/man</tt> has
no manual pages in section 4 (Devices), then
<tt>/usr/local/man/man4</tt> may be omitted. copy

administration (optional)&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The component
<tt>&lt;section&gt;</tt> describes the manual section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Provisions must
be made in the structure of <tt>/usr/share/man</tt> to
support manual pages which are written in different (or
multiple) languages. These provisions must take into account
the storage and reference of these manual pages. Relevant
factors include language (including geographical-based
differences), and character code set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This naming of
language subdirectories of <tt>/usr/share/man</tt> is based
on Appendix E of the POSIX 1003.1 standard which describes
the locale identification string &mdash; the most
well-accepted method to describe a cultural environment. The
<tt>&lt;locale&gt;</tt> string is:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>&lt;language&gt;[_&lt;territory&gt;][.&lt;character-set&gt;][,&lt;version&gt;]</tt></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&lt;language&gt;</tt> field must be taken from ISO 639
(a code for the representation of names of languages). It
must be two characters wide and specified with lowercase
letters only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&lt;territory&gt;</tt> field must be the two-letter code
of ISO 3166 (a specification of representations of
countries), if possible. (Most people are familiar with the
two-letter codes used for the country codes in email
addresses.) It must be two characters wide and specified
with uppercase letters only. A major exception to this rule
is the United Kingdom, which is &lsquo;GB&rsquo; in the ISO
3166, but &lsquo;UK&rsquo; for most email addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>&lt;character-set&gt;</tt> field must represent the
standard describing the character set. If the
<tt>&lt;character-set&gt;</tt> field is just a numeric
specification, the number represents the number of the
international standard describing the character set. It is
recommended that this be a numeric representation if
possible (ISO standards, especially), not include additional
punctuation symbols, and that any letters be in
lowercase.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A parameter
specifying a <tt>&lt;version&gt;</tt> of the profile may be
placed after the <tt>&lt;character-set&gt;</tt> field,
delimited by a comma. This may be used to discriminate
between different cultural needs; for instance, dictionary
order versus a more systems-oriented collating order. This
standard recommends not using the <tt>&lt;version&gt;</tt>
field, unless it is necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Systems which
use a unique language and code set for all manual pages may
omit the <tt>&lt;locale&gt;</tt> substring and store all
manual pages in <tt>&lt;mandir&gt;</tt>. For example,
systems which only have English manual pages coded with
ASCII, may store manual pages (the
<tt>man&lt;section&gt;</tt> directories) directly in
<tt>/usr/share/man</tt>. (That is the traditional
circumstance and arrangement, in fact.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Countries for
which there is a well-accepted standard character code set
may omit the <tt>&lt;character-set&gt;</tt> field, but it is
strongly recommended that it be included, especially for
countries with several competing standards.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Various
examples:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-3194624.png" alt="Image grohtml-3194624.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly,
provision must be made for manual pages which are
architecture-dependent, such as documentation on
device-drivers or low-level system administration commands.
These must be placed under an <tt>&lt;arch&gt;</tt>
directory in the appropriate <tt>man&lt;section&gt;</tt>
directory; for example, a man page for the i386
ctrlaltdel(8) command might be placed in
<tt>/usr/share/man/&lt;locale&gt;/man8/i386/ctrlaltdel.8</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Manual pages
for commands and data under <tt>/usr/local</tt> are stored
in <tt>/usr/local/man</tt>. Manual pages for X11R6 are
stored in <tt>/usr/X11R6/man</tt>. It follows that all
manual page hierarchies in the system must have the same
structure as <tt>/usr/share/man</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The cat page
sections (<tt>cat&lt;section&gt;</tt>) containing formatted
manual page entries are also found within subdirectories of
<tt>&lt;mandir&gt;/&lt;locale&gt;</tt>, but are not required
nor may they be distributed in lieu of nroff source manual
pages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The numbered
sections &quot;1&quot; through &quot;8&quot; are
traditionally defined. In general, the file name for manual
pages located within a particular section end with
<tt>.&lt;section&gt;</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
some large sets of application-specific manual pages have an
additional suffix appended to the manual page filename. For
example, the MH mail handling system manual pages must have
<tt>mh</tt> appended to all MH manuals. All X Window System
manual pages must have an <tt>x</tt> appended to the
filename.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The practice of
placing various language manual pages in appropriate
subdirectories of <tt>/usr/share/man</tt> also applies to
the other manual page hierarchies, such as
<tt>/usr/local/man</tt> and <tt>/usr/X11R6/man</tt>. (This
portion of the standard also applies later in the section on
the optional <tt>/var/cache/man</tt> structure.)</p>

Purpose</b> <tt><br>
/var</tt> contains variable data files. This includes spool
directories and files, administrative and logging data, and
transient and temporary files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some portions
of <tt>/var</tt> are not shareable between different
systems. For instance, <tt>/var/log</tt>,
<tt>/var/lock</tt>, and <tt>/var/run</tt>. Other portions
may be shared, notably <tt>/var/mail</tt>,
<tt>/var/cache/man</tt>, <tt>/var/cache/fonts</tt>, and
<tt>/var/spool/news</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>/var</tt>
is specified here in order to make it possible to mount
<tt>/usr</tt> read-only. Everything that once went into
<tt>/usr</tt> that is written to during system operation (as
opposed to installation and software maintenance) must be in
<tt>/var</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<tt>/var</tt> cannot be made a separate partition, it is
often preferable to move <tt>/var</tt> out of the root
partition and into the <tt>/usr</tt> partition. (This is
sometimes done to reduce the size of the root partition or
when space runs low in the root partition.) However,
<tt>/var</tt> must not be linked to <tt>/usr</tt> because
this makes separation of <tt>/usr</tt> and <tt>/var</tt>
more difficult and is likely to create a naming conflict.
Instead, link <tt>/var</tt> to <tt>/usr/var</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Applications
must generally not add directories to the top level of
<tt>/var</tt>. Such directories should only be added if they
have some system-wide implication, and in consultation with

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<tt><br>
/var/cache</tt> is intended for cached data from
applications. Such data is locally generated as a result of
time-consuming I/O or calculation. The application must be
able to regenerate or restore the data. Unlike
<tt>/var/spool</tt>, the cached files can be deleted without
data loss. The data must remain valid between invocations of
the application and rebooting the system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Files located
under <tt>/var/cache</tt> may be expired in an application
specific manner, by the system administrator, or both. The
application must always be able to recover from manual
deletion of these files (generally because of a disk space
shortage). No other requirements are made on the data format
of the cache directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
The directory <tt>/var/cache/fonts</tt> should be used to
store any dynamically-created fonts. In particular, all of
the fonts which are automatically generated by
<tt>mktexpk</tt> must be located in appropriately-named
subdirectories of <tt>/var/cache/fonts</tt>. This standard
does not currently incorporate the TeX Directory Structure
(a document that describes the layout TeX files and

<h2>/var/cache/man : Locally-formatted manual pages (optional)
<a name="/var/cache/man : Locally-formatted manual pages (optional)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This directory provides a standard location for sites that
provide a read-only <tt>/usr</tt> partition, but wish to
allow caching of locally-formatted man pages. Sites that
mount <tt>/usr</tt> as writable (e.g., single-user
installations) may choose not to use <tt>/var/cache/man</tt>
and may write formatted man pages into the
<tt>cat&lt;section&gt;</tt> directories in
<tt>/usr/share/man</tt> directly. We recommend that most
sites use one of the following options instead: Preformat
all manual pages alongside the unformatted versions. Allow
no caching of formatted man pages, and require formatting to
be done each time a man page is brought up. Allow local
caching of formatted man pages in
<tt>/var/cache/man</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The structure
of <tt>/var/cache/man</tt> needs to reflect both the fact of
multiple man page hierarchies and the possibility of
multiple language support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Given an
unformatted manual page that normally appears in
<tt>&lt;path&gt;/man/&lt;locale&gt;/man&lt;section&gt;</tt>,
the directory to place formatted man pages in is
<tt>/var/cache/man/&lt;catpath&gt;/&lt;locale&gt;/cat&lt;section&gt;</tt>,
where <tt>&lt;catpath&gt;</tt> is derived from
<tt>&lt;path&gt;</tt> by removing any leading <tt>usr</tt>
and/or trailing <tt>share</tt> pathname components. (Note
that the <tt>&lt;locale&gt;</tt> component may be missing.)
For example, <tt>/usr/share/man/man1/ls.1</tt> is formatted
into <tt>/var/cache/man/cat1/ls.1</tt>, and
<tt>/usr/X11R6/man/&lt;locale&gt;/man3/XtClass.3x</tt> into
<tt>/var/cache/man/X11R6/&lt;locale&gt;/cat3/XtClass.3x</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Man pages
written to <tt>/var/cache/man</tt> may eventually be
transferred to the appropriate preformatted directories in
the source <tt>man</tt> hierarchy or expired; likewise
formatted man pages in the source <tt>man</tt> hierarchy may
be expired if they are not accessed for a period of
time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If preformatted
manual pages come with a system on read-only media (a
CD-ROM, for instance), they must be installed in the source
<tt>man</tt> hierarchy (e.g.
<tt>/usr/share/man/cat&lt;section&gt;</tt>).
<tt>/var/cache/man</tt> is reserved as a writable cache for
formatted manual pages.</p>

<h2>/var/games : Variable game data (optional)
<a name="/var/games : Variable game data (optional)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
Any variable data relating to games in <tt>/usr</tt> should

data previously found in <tt>/usr</tt>; static data, such as
help text, level descriptions, and so on, must remain
elsewhere, such as <tt>/usr/share/games</tt>.</p>

<h2>BEGIN RATIONALE

has been given a hierarchy of its own, rather than leaving
it merged in with the old <tt>/var/lib</tt> as in release
1.2. The separation allows local control of backup
strategies, permissions, and disk usage, as well as allowing
inter-host sharing and reducing clutter in
<tt>/var/lib</tt>. Additionally, <tt>/var/games</tt> is the
path traditionally used by BSD.</p>

<h2>/var/lib : Variable state information
<a name="/var/lib : Variable state information"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This hierarchy holds state information pertaining to an
application or the system. State information is data that
programs modify while they run, and that pertains to one
specific host. Users must never need to modify files in
<tt>/var/lib</tt> to configure a package&rsquo;s
operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">State
information is generally used to preserve the condition of
an application (or a group of inter-related applications)
between invocations and between different instances of the
same application. State information should generally remain
valid after a reboot, should not be logging output, and
should not be spooled data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An application
(or a group of inter-related applications) must use a
subdirectory of <tt>/var/lib</tt> for its data. There is one
required subdirectory, <tt>/var/lib/misc</tt>, which is
intended for state files that don&rsquo;t need a
subdirectory; the other subdirectories should only be
present if the application in question is included in the
distribution. An important difference between this version
of this standard and previous ones is that applications are
now required to use a subdirectory of <tt>/var/lib</tt>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>/var/lib/&lt;name&gt;</tt>
is the location that must be used for all distribution
packaging support. Different distributions may use different
names, of course.</p>

<a name="/var/lib/&lt;editor&gt; : Editor backup files and state (optional)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
These directories contain saved files generated by any
unexpected termination of an editor (e.g., elvis, jove,
nvi).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other editors
may not require a directory for crash-recovery files, but
may require a well-defined place to store other information
while the editor is running. This information should be
stored in a subdirectory under <tt>/var/lib</tt> (for
example, GNU Emacs would place lock files in
<tt>/var/lib/emacs/lock</tt>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Future editors
may require additional state information beyond
crash-recovery files and lock files &mdash; this information
should also be placed under
<tt>/var/lib/&lt;editor&gt;</tt>.</p>

<h2>BEGIN RATIONALE

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Previous Linux
releases, as well as all commercial vendors, use
<tt>/var/preserve</tt> for vi or its clones. However, each
editor uses its own format for these crash-recovery files,
so a separate directory is needed for each editor.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Editor-specific
lock files are usually quite different from the device or
resource lock files that are stored in <tt>/var/lock</tt>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This directory contains variable data not placed in a
subdirectory in <tt>/var/lib</tt>. An attempt should be made

<h2>/var/lock : Lock files
<a name="/var/lock : Lock files"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
Lock files should be stored within the <tt>/var/lock</tt>
directory structure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Lock files for
devices and other resources shared by multiple applications,
such as the serial device lock files that were originally
found in either <tt>/usr/spool/locks</tt> or
<tt>/usr/spool/uucp</tt>, must now be stored in
<tt>/var/lock</tt>. The naming convention which must be used
is &quot;LCK..&quot; followed by the base name of the
device. For example, to lock /dev/ttyS0 the file
&quot;LCK..ttyS0&quot; would be created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then, anything
wishing to use <tt>/dev/ttyS0</tt> can read the lock file
and act accordingly (all locks in <tt>/var/lock</tt> should
be world-readable).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format used
for the contents of such lock files must be the HDB UUCP
lock file format. The HDB format is to store the process
identifier (PID) as a ten byte ASCII decimal number, with a
trailing newline. For example, if process 1230 holds a lock
file, it would contain the eleven characters: space, space,
space, space, space, space, one, two, three, zero, and
newline.</p>

<h2>/var/run : Run-time variable data

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This directory contains system information data describing
the system since it was booted. Files under this directory
must be cleared (removed or truncated as appropriate) at the
beginning of the boot process. Programs may have a
subdirectory of <tt>/var/run</tt>; this is encouraged for
programs that use more than one run-time file.
<tt>/var/run</tt> should be unwritable for unprivileged
users (root or users running daemons); it is a major
security problem if any user can write in this directory.
Process identifier (PID) files, which were originally placed
in <tt>/etc</tt>, must be placed in <tt>/var/run</tt>. The
naming convention for PID files is
<tt>&lt;program-name&gt;.pid</tt>. For example, the
<tt>crond</tt> PID file is named
<tt>/var/run/crond.pid</tt>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Requirements</b>
<br>
The internal format of PID files remains unchanged. The file
must consist of the process identifier in ASCII-encoded
decimal, followed by a newline character. For example, if
<tt>crond</tt> was process number 25,
<tt>/var/run/crond.pid</tt> would contain three characters:
two, five, and newline.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Programs that
read PID files should be somewhat flexible in what they
accept; i.e., they should ignore extra whitespace, leading
zeroes, absence of the trailing newline, or additional lines
in the PID file. Programs that create PID files should use
the simple specification located in the above paragraph.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>utmp</tt> file, which stores information about who is
currently using the system, is located in this

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose</b>
<br>
The <tt>/var/tmp</tt> directory is made available for
programs that require temporary files or directories that
are preserved between system reboots. Therefore, data stored
in <tt>/var/tmp</tt> is more persistent than data in
<tt>/tmp</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Files and
directories located in <tt>/var/tmp</tt> must not be deleted
when the system is booted. Although data stored in
<tt>/var/tmp</tt> is typically deleted in a site-specific
manner, it is recommended that deletions occur at a less
frequent interval than <tt>/tmp</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The requirement
not to make symlinks promiscuously is made because local
setups will often differ from that on the
distributor&rsquo;s development machine. Also, if a
distribution install script configures the symbolic links at
install time, these symlinks will often not get updated if
local changes are made in hardware. When used responsibly at
a local level, however, they can be put to good use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Static
<tt>ln</tt> (<tt>sln</tt>) and static <tt>sync</tt>
(<tt>ssync</tt>) are useful when things go wrong. The
primary use of <tt>sln</tt> (to repair incorrect symlinks in
<tt>/lib</tt> after a poorly orchestrated upgrade) is no
longer a major concern now that the <tt>ldconfig</tt>
program (usually located in <tt>/usr/sbin</tt>) exists and
can act as a guiding hand in upgrading the dynamic
libraries. Static <tt>sync</tt> is useful in some emergency
situations. Note that these need not be statically linked
versions of the standard <tt>ln</tt> and <tt>sync</tt>, but
may be.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<tt>ldconfig</tt> binary is optional for <tt>/sbin</tt>
since a site may choose to run <tt>ldconfig</tt> at boot
time, rather than only when upgrading the shared libraries.
(It&rsquo;s not clear whether or not it is advantageous to
run <tt>ldconfig</tt> on each boot.) Even so, some people
like <tt>ldconfig</tt> around for the following (all too
common) situation: I&rsquo;ve just removed
<tt>/lib/&lt;file&gt;</tt>. I can&rsquo;t find out the name
of the library because <tt>ls</tt> is dynamically linked,
I&rsquo;m using a shell that doesn&rsquo;t have <tt>ls</tt>
built-in, and I don&rsquo;t know about using &quot;<tt>echo
*</tt>&quot; as a replacement. I have a static <tt>sln</tt>,
but I don&rsquo;t know what to call the link. Miscellaneous:
ctrlaltdel, kbdrate }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So as to cope
with the fact that some keyboards come up with such a high
repeat rate as to be unusable, <tt>kbdrate</tt> may be
installed in <tt>/sbin</tt> on some systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since the
default action in the kernel for the Ctrl-Alt-Del key
combination is an instant hard reboot, it is generally
advisable to disable the behavior before mounting the root
filesystem in read-write mode. Some <tt>init</tt> suites are
able to disable Ctrl-Alt-Del, but others may require the
<tt>ctrlaltdel</tt> program, which may be installed in
<tt>/sbin</tt> on those systems.</p>

without first contacting the FHS editor or a listed
contributor.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Background
of the FHS</b> <br>
The process of developing a standard filesystem hierarchy
began in August 1993 with an effort to restructure the file
and directory structure of Linux. The FSSTND, a filesystem
hierarchy standard specific to the Linux operating system,
was released on February 14, 1994. Subsequent revisions were
released on October 9, 1994 and March 28, 1995.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In early 1995,
the goal of developing a more comprehensive version of
FSSTND to address not only Linux, but other UNIX-like
systems was adopted with the help of members of the BSD
development community. As a result, a concerted effort was
made to focus on issues that were general to UNIX-like
systems. In recognition of this widening of scope, the name
of the standard was changed to Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
or FHS for short.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Volunteers who
have contributed extensively to this standard are listed at
the end of this document. This standard represents a
consensus view of those and other contributors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>General
Guidelines</b> <br>
Here are some of the guidelines that have been used in the
development of this standard: Solve technical problems while
limiting transitional difficulties. Make the specification
reasonably stable. Gain the approval of distributors,
developers, and other decision-makers in relevant
development groups and encourage their participation.
Provide a standard that is attractive to the implementors of
different UNIX-like systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Scope</b>
<br>
This document specifies a standard filesystem hierarchy for
FHS filesystems by specifying the location of files and
directories, and the contents of some system files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This standard
has been designed to be used by system integrators, package
developers, and system administrators in the construction
and maintenance of FHS compliant filesystems. It is
primarily intended to be a reference and is not a tutorial
on how to manage a conforming filesystem hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The FHS grew
out of earlier work on FSSTND, a filesystem organization
standard for the Linux operating system. It builds on FSSTND
to address interoperability issues not just in the Linux
community but in a wider arena including 4.4BSD-based
operating systems. It incorporates lessons learned in the
BSD world and elsewhere about multi-architecture support and
the demands of heterogeneous networking.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although this
standard is more comprehensive than previous attempts at
filesystem hierarchy standardization, periodic updates may
become necessary as requirements change in relation to
emerging technology. It is also possible that better
solutions to the problems addressed here will be discovered
so that our solutions will no longer be the best possible
solutions. Supplementary drafts may be released in addition
to periodic updates to this document. However, a specific
goal is backwards compatibility from one release of this
document to the next.</p>
