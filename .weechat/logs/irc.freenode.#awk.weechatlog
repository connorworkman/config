2016-09-13 02:52:31	jeffreylevesque	i'd like to replace `sed -n '/-u some:some/d;/^KEY=.*/p' /path/to/file.txt` with an implementation of `awk` primarily because i need to have an exit code returned (0 if match(es) found, 1 if none found)
2016-09-13 02:53:43	Riviera	Which of the matches, KEY or -u or both?
2016-09-13 02:53:49	jeffreylevesque	the expression is used to check if a line starting with `KEY=` contains the string `-u some:some`
2016-09-13 02:54:08	Riviera	Okay, so
2016-09-13 02:54:22	Riviera	You want to print all lines that begin with "KEY=" but do not contain -u some:some,
2016-09-13 02:54:31	jeffreylevesque	yeah
2016-09-13 02:54:35	Riviera	and if any of such line was found, exit with an exit code of 0, otherwise of 1?
2016-09-13 02:54:41	jeffreylevesque	but, i need an exit code too
2016-09-13 02:54:44	jeffreylevesque	yeah
2016-09-13 02:55:18	Riviera	Bonus question:  Can it be mulitple such lines or do you want the script to end after the first found line?
2016-09-13 02:55:42	Riviera	multiple:)
2016-09-13 02:56:28	geirha	Do you need the output at all?
2016-09-13 02:56:46	jeffreylevesque	i guess not, but i could remove it later
2016-09-13 02:56:51	jeffreylevesque	just exit code

2016-09-13 03:01:23		[03:01]
2016-09-13 03:06:11	jeffreylevesque	i'm trying to think of the logic - https://bpaste.net/show/3737d89c4827
2016-09-13 03:06:24	jeffreylevesque	maybe i should rework the command with the onlyif condition
2016-09-13 03:06:42	jeffreylevesque	because my command only runs if the `onlyif` returns 0
2016-09-13 03:07:54	jeffreylevesque	the onlyif returns 0 when there exists at least one line with `-u some:some` prefixed with `KEY=`
2016-09-13 03:08:05	Riviera	Maybe #puppet can help.
2016-09-13 03:08:21	jeffreylevesque	maybe one larger awk

2016-09-13 03:09:18	jeffreylevesque	bc the onlyif is a condition on the whole file, but i probably want to iterative do the condition check per line?
2016-09-13 03:09:23	linedash	if ! awk '/pattern/ { exit 1 }'

2016-09-13 03:21:42	linedash	firstly with /POST/ && /php/ && /wp-content\/uploads/ - That part should only match when all 3 terms show up, but I think I'm doing something wrong w/ the syntax as get results that don't include php
2016-09-13 03:22:04	linedash	secondly with var !~ (/403/ || /500/) - which is checking the output of HEAD <domain>
2016-09-13 03:22:13	linedash	don't match when status is 403 or 500
2016-09-13 03:22:33	linedash	but again, I suspect I'm doing something slightly wrong here as it's not matching as I expect

2016-09-13 03:25:21	jeffreylevesque	should i combine `awk '/^KEY=/ {$0=$0" -u some:some"} 1' inputfile` with `awk 'BEGIN { e = 1 } /^KEY=/ && !/-u some:some/ { print; e = 0 } END { exit e }' `?

2016-09-13 03:25:37	linedash	without needing the 2nd
2016-09-13 03:25:53	jeffreylevesque	because `awk '/^KEY=/ {$0=$0" -u some:some"} 1' appends `-u some:some` everytime to a line that contains `KEY=`

2016-09-13 04:29:56	jeffreylevesque	anyone know how i can adjust `awk '/^KEY=/ && !/-u some:some/ {$0=$0" -u some:some"} 1' inputfile`, so `-u some:some` is appended within quotes?
2016-09-13 04:30:23	jeffreylevesque	i got an equivalent version working with `awk -f`
2016-09-13 04:30:29	jeffreylevesque	but that involves print statements
2016-09-13 04:30:32	linedash	sorry; not 100% sure I understand
2016-09-13 04:30:39	linedash	you want to insert single quotes around -u some:some ?
2016-09-13 04:30:42	linedash	or backticks?
2016-09-13 04:31:09		[alyptik away: sleeping]
2016-09-13 04:31:14	linedash	jeffreylevesque: ?
2016-09-13 04:31:24	jeffreylevesque	if i have: KEYS="-g JEFF LEVESQUE"
2016-09-13 04:31:38	jeffreylevesque	it gets added: KEYS="-g JEFF LEVESQUE" -u some:some
2016-09-13 04:31:51	linedash	yes; that is what I gave you before
2016-09-13 04:31:53	jeffreylevesque	i want to get it: KEYS="-g JEFF LEVESQUE -u some:some"
2016-09-13 04:31:59	linedash	ah, okay
2016-09-13 04:32:01	linedash	that is a lot harder
2016-09-13 04:32:10	linedash	I'd be looking at using sed
2016-09-13 04:32:40	jeffreylevesque	i have: awk -F\" '/^KEYS="./ && !/-u some:some/ {print $1"\""$2 " -u some:some\""}' /path/to/file.txt
2016-09-13 04:32:42	jeffreylevesque	that  works
2016-09-13 04:33:01	jeffreylevesque	but, i'm not sure if your way was cleaner, if it could be tweaked
2016-09-13 04:33:16	linedash	hrm
2016-09-13 04:33:31	linedash	easiest way I can think is checking if the line matches the required criteria, then if so - checking if it ends with a "
2016-09-13 04:33:35	linedash	if it does, to strip the trailing "
2016-09-13 04:33:39	linedash	then append -u some:some"
2016-09-13 04:33:49	linedash	with the trailing "

2016-09-13 04:39:58	linedash	try that
2016-09-13 04:40:37	linedash	hrm, actually that won't work either :D  You'll need a multi-part awk statement

2016-09-13 04:46:37	linedash	Think of it like cut's -d
2016-09-13 04:46:51	linedash	just sets what the delimiter is

2016-09-13 08:37:46	guardian	in fact the real context is for some bizarre reason uptime on Linux emits a leading whitespace

2016-09-13 08:38:13	larryv	actually i guess it elides consecutive whitespace
2016-09-13 08:38:18	larryv	point stands, though
2016-09-13 08:39:36	Riviera	If it's Linux only anyway you might use /proc/uptime instead.
2016-09-13 08:42:25	guardian	nope not linux only
2016-09-13 08:42:42	guardian	well I'll thought I could just use awk and get an elegant oneliner :)
2016-09-13 08:43:08	Riviera	If parsing the output of uptime needs special cases for each operating system anyway, then you might want to use /proc/uptime for Linux. :)

2016-09-14 16:42:10	izalove	awk is awful and i'll tell you why
2016-09-14 16:42:19	izalove	mainly because print
2016-09-14 16:42:30	izalove	print is a *statement*
2016-09-14 16:42:37	izalove	wth is a statement?
2016-09-14 16:42:46	izalove	how is it different from an expression or an action?
2016-09-14 16:43:06	izalove	a statement is just a function that can be called without ()
2016-09-14 16:43:21	izalove	which means the parser will have to recognize it specially
2016-09-14 16:43:36	izalove	it could be a builtin function or whatever you want to call it, but no
2016-09-14 16:44:10	izalove	expressions and actions are actually the same thing
2016-09-14 16:44:25	nal	just use printf if you want a function
2016-09-14 16:44:51	izalove	no because printf is a statement as well
2016-09-14 16:45:21	izalove	i'm annoyed because i'm trying to write a parser for this thing and this statement thing makes everything 100x harder to parse
2016-09-14 16:46:21	izalove	also statements don't return anything, unlike functions
2016-09-14 16:46:31	izalove	functions have an implicit return 0 at the end
2016-09-14 16:46:33	nal	so get rid of getline as well?
2016-09-14 16:46:37	izalove	statements suck
2016-09-14 16:46:40	izalove	right getline too
2016-09-14 16:47:13	nal	well, what are you writing it in? awk itself?
2016-09-14 16:47:16	izalove	c
2016-09-14 16:47:29	nal	you can look at a2p
2016-09-14 16:47:35	izalove	what's that?
2016-09-14 16:47:42	nal	awk2perl
2016-09-14 16:47:52	nal	but thats written in perl
2016-09-14 16:47:58	izalove	ah the devil's language
2016-09-14 16:48:04	nal	:)
2016-09-14 16:51:03	izalove	so far my idea is to take the script
2016-09-14 16:51:08	izalove	sorta parse it but not fully
2016-09-14 16:51:15	izalove	find every print statement
2016-09-14 16:51:18	izalove	convert it to a function
2016-09-14 16:51:30	izalove	then parse it for real
2016-09-14 16:51:53	izalove	i.e. just add ( ) around print and printf and getline
2016-09-14 16:53:24	nal	did you look at awka ?
2016-09-14 16:53:24		[16:53]
2016-09-14 16:53:37	izalove	what's that?
2016-09-14 16:53:46	nal	http://awka.sourceforge.net/index.html
2016-09-14 16:53:56	izalove	nice
2016-09-14 16:54:58	nal	also if you think awk is awful for having statements, oh boy...
2016-09-14 16:55:27	izalove	it's just stupid
2016-09-14 16:55:31	izalove	they serve no purpose
2016-09-14 16:55:42	izalove	other than not having to type ()
2016-09-14 16:56:09	nal	python had statements too, its easier for novices
2016-09-14 16:56:19	izalove	that's ok but i'm not trying to write a python parser
2016-09-14 16:56:47	izalove	and why can't i write this     if (print(1)) print 2     ?
2016-09-14 16:56:57	izalove	that's a syntax error for no reason
2016-09-14 16:57:31	izalove	it may not be a useful thing to do, but a parser has to special case it
2016-09-14 16:57:39	izalove	and it would be harmless to support
2016-09-14 16:58:01	izalove	ok i'll write a awk and it'll be smarter
2016-09-14 16:58:28	nal	what does print return?
2016-09-14 16:58:46	izalove	nothing because it's a statement
2016-09-14 16:58:58	izalove	but it could return 0 or 1 or the length of the string it printed
2016-09-14 16:59:05	izalove	i don't even know but this is just dumb
2016-09-14 17:05:00		[16:59]
2016-09-14 17:11:23	nal	length already does that, that would be redundant
2016-09-14 17:11:31	nal	anyway, at this rate you cant change the language
2016-09-14 17:17:00		[17:11]
2016-09-14 17:49:45	ttmrichter	OK, so you don't even know what print would return, but you're utterly convinced that it needs to return SOMETHING for reasons.

2016-09-14 18:01:08	nal	i was going to say something like that but i've never written a parser...
2016-09-14 18:06:00	ttmrichter	Writing a parser is a non-issue these days.
2016-09-14 18:06:58	ttmrichter	It is essentially a solved problem in CS for any non-natural language.
2016-09-14 18:07:16	ttmrichter	(Natural language parsing is still a nightmare.)
2016-09-14 18:08:03	izalove	so you're saying that it's possible to write a parser for this language that has been implemented several times?
2016-09-14 18:08:14	izalove	thanks i would never have guessed it
2016-09-14 18:08:41	ttmrichter	I'm saying it's TRIVIAL to write a parser for this language.
2016-09-14 18:08:51	izalove	then write one, what are you waiting for
2016-09-14 18:09:03	ttmrichter	That insisting print needs to return something Just Because for reasons of parser design is idiotic.
2016-09-14 18:09:30	izalove	i'm saying it's bad language design
2016-09-14 18:09:40	ttmrichter	So make one that's better.
2016-09-14 18:09:52	izalove	it's even worse than the stupid way awk uses for local variables in functions
2016-09-14 18:09:54	ttmrichter	Make it so obviously better people will flock to it in droves.
2016-09-14 18:10:25	ttmrichter	But you should LOVE the way it makes local variables!  No special cases in the parser for them!
2016-09-14 18:10:32	izalove	wat
2016-09-14 18:10:49	izalove	you're kidding
2016-09-14 18:11:03	ttmrichter	No.  I'm mocking you.  There's a difference.
2016-09-14 18:11:09	izalove	a variable can either be local or non local in two different invocations of a function
2016-09-14 18:11:12	izalove	that's stupid
2016-09-14 18:13:22	ttmrichter	function stupid(foo, bar) ...  OK, I'll bite.  How can "bar" be local or non-local?
2016-09-14 18:13:25	izalove	actually what i just said is wrong
2016-09-14 18:13:28	izalove	sorry
2016-09-14 18:13:30	izalove	ignore that last line
2016-09-14 18:13:52	ttmrichter	Nah, I think "that's stupid" is definitely accurate.  Just not for reasons you think.
2016-09-14 18:14:12	izalove	do tell your reasons
2016-09-14 18:14:45	izalove	because you have to define all your variables in the top of the function instead of the current block?  which makes software unmaintainable?
2016-09-14 18:16:57	ttmrichter	I'm just recycling your argument against print statements.

2016-09-14 18:17:15	ttmrichter	You just use parameters.  Keeps the parser simpler.
2016-09-14 18:17:20	ttmrichter	Like I said, I'm mocking you.

2016-09-15 05:30:22	jamesllondonlapt	how do i select 'hamburg' from 'usa:chile:venezuela london:hamburg:seweto kursk:dehli:beijing'
2016-09-15 05:31:06	waldner	is that always group of three?
2016-09-15 05:31:19	jamesllondonlapt	or london: i need to select column (2) and then change FS to select subcolumn(1)
2016-09-15 05:31:43	waldner	to select column 2 you can use $2, then split() to extract subfields
2016-09-15 05:32:08	waldner	or if you're brave, you might try FS='[ :]' but that may also be a disaster
2016-09-15 05:32:37	jamesllondonlapt	no, I want to change FS: something like [awk '{o=$2; $0=o; FS="\:" ; print $1}' ]
2016-09-15 05:32:46	waldner	no, that can't work
2016-09-15 05:32:59	waldner	you can't change FS while processing a line
2016-09-15 05:33:10	waldner	well, you can, but it d0esn't do what you think
2016-09-15 05:34:24	jamesllondonlapt	couldn've sworn I've seen 'o=$2; $0=o; FS' pattern before
2016-09-15 05:34:44	waldner	sure, but were you sure it worked?
2016-09-15 05:35:21	jamesllondonlapt	mustve

2016-09-15 05:38:44	jamesllondonlapt	hmm - i see
2016-09-15 05:39:09	waldner	what's wrong with split()?
2016-09-15 05:39:17	waldner	it's done just for that
2016-09-15 05:39:53	jamesllondonlapt	subprocess spawn?
2016-09-15 05:40:10	jamesllondonlapt	no idea
2016-09-15 05:40:50	waldner	man awk, look for split()
2016-09-15 05:41:02	jamesllondonlapt	you sure it's not badly using IFS / OFS?
2016-09-15 05:41:06	waldner	it's a builtin function which, well, split strings
2016-09-15 05:41:19	waldner	IFS doesn't exist
2016-09-15 05:42:10	waldner	and OFS is never used to split anything

2016-10-01 17:11:52	veek	how do i awk -e 'BEGIN { FS="[^a-z]+"; } { print $2 " " $3 " " $4 }' print the matched text and $2-whatever
2016-10-01 17:12:27	yitz	"matched"?

2016-10-01 17:13:10	yitz	There's no shortcut for that

2016-10-01 17:18:50	yitz	That's not kept. It's dropped. You can print $0 but each field got it's unique sep
2016-10-01 17:19:23	veek	darn, okay how do i split on 魚   鱼 yu fish, where the unicode stuff varies
2016-10-01 17:19:35	veek	i'm trying to sort on the pinyin
2016-10-01 17:21:27	yitz	You can either split on it ... or select it. Now really both.
2016-10-01 17:21:38	yitz	How about sample input plus desired output instead?
2016-10-01 17:23:21	veek	basically i want to sort on pinyin, 'yu' but the chinese chars are variable length so i was splitting on FS="[^a-z]+"
2016-10-01 17:25:30	yitz	Don't really know what that means ... but given a sample input/output I may be able to suggest an approach

2016-10-02 08:41:13	cousin_luigi	How do I match a pattern by regex, get a field, apply a regex rule to it and then print it?
2016-10-02 08:41:24	cousin_luigi	I'm missing the third thing

2016-10-02 08:42:39	go|dfish	cousin_luigi: what exactly are you missing? you know about sub() / gsub() - right?
2016-10-02 08:42:48	cousin_luigi	go|dfish: not really
2016-10-02 08:42:53	go|dfish	ok
2016-10-02 08:43:04	cousin_luigi	reading that guide thanks, I think it's about time:)

2016-10-02 08:56:31	cousin_luigi	There's something wrong I'm doing. Is there a particular syntax to use symbols in sub() ?
2016-10-02 08:57:20	cousin_luigi	sub(".", ",", var) is matching the first character and not the period...
2016-10-02 08:58:54	cousin_luigi	And gsub matches every character.
2016-10-02 09:01:41	cousin_luigi	oh, it's the wildcard
2016-10-02 09:02:00	_val_	cousin_luigi: if you need metachars to be treated literal what do you do?
2016-10-02 09:02:35	cousin_luigi	found it, \\.
2016-10-02 09:02:43	_val_	# awk -vvar="foo.bar" 'BEGIN{sub(/\./,",",var); print var}'
2016-10-02 09:02:44	shbot	_val_: foo,bar
2016-10-02 09:03:01	cousin_luigi	maieutics seems to work!
