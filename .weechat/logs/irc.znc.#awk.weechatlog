2016-09-16 05:29:21	fcolista	This is a CSV (is longer, but the format is like this):
2016-09-16 05:29:21	fcolista	SNOM Model 820,<%CHANGEME%>,FreeLine,00AABBCCDDEE,,,,,,,,1234,"Name, Surname Number",,false,,false,,false,,,Description

2016-09-16 05:30:07	fcolista	http://pastebin.com/KKDbLNRH
2016-09-16 05:30:18	fcolista	What i need to do is adding, after "Name, Surname Number" or Name, Surname Room Number a country code, let's say USA.
2016-09-16 05:30:26	fcolista	So, that field should become:
2016-09-16 05:30:33	fcolista	"Name, Surname Number USA" and Name, Surname Room Number USA. Maybe with double quotes, but it is not important.
2016-09-16 05:30:40	fcolista	As far as i understand, i need to figure out first a patter that matches the field, and then add USA.
2016-09-16 05:30:40	fcolista	Can someone help me with that? Thanks.

2016-09-16 05:39:18	fcolista	Name, Surname and Room are different
2016-09-16 05:39:26	fcolista	It's the actual name, surname and room
2016-09-16 05:39:34	fcolista	thx for the reply go|dfish
2016-09-16 05:39:46	go|dfish	oh right
2016-09-16 05:39:50	fcolista	sorry if i'm not explained correctly
2016-09-16 05:39:51	go|dfish	heh
2016-09-16 05:39:59	fcolista	i need to iterate that
2016-09-16 05:40:34	go|dfish	hmmm, so, some lines are "broken" and some are not
2016-09-16 05:40:37	fcolista	i'm looking for a way to do that, but i've not figuret iet
2016-09-16 05:40:44	fcolista	go|dfish, correct.
2016-09-16 05:41:22	fcolista	what is consistent, though, are the 4 digits before what i need to change
2016-09-16 05:41:24	fcolista	so
2016-09-16 05:41:25	fcolista	1234
2016-09-16 05:41:28	fcolista	and 5678
2016-09-16 05:41:53	fcolista	those are unique and they are in all the lines
2016-09-16 05:42:02	fcolista	this is what i'd like to exploit
2016-09-16 05:47:18	go|dfish	fcolista: well, in those 2 examples you can count on the name being $13 and the surname room number being $14
2016-09-16 05:47:32	go|dfish	so you could do something horrible like: awk -F, -v OFS=, '$13 !~ /^"/ { $13 = "\"" $13 } { sub (/"$/, "", $14); $14 = $14" USA\""; print }'
2016-09-16 05:49:11	fcolista	:)
2016-09-16 05:49:29	go|dfish	could put it all into the sub() i suppose: { sub (/"?$/, " USA\"", $14); print
2016-09-16 05:49:41	fcolista	i cannot count on Field Number
2016-09-16 05:50:03	go|dfish	{{terz}}
2016-09-16 05:50:07	fcolista	:)
2016-09-16 05:50:15	fcolista	i told you that was not that easy :)
2016-09-16 05:50:41	go|dfish	so what can you count on? it being the field after "the first field that is just all digits"?
2016-09-16 05:50:53	fcolista	correct.
2016-09-16 05:51:31	fcolista	and consider that the next field (the one i want to modify)
2016-09-16 05:51:31		[05:51]
2016-09-16 05:51:47	go|dfish	well, you can loop through to find it, for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) if ($i ~ /^[0-9]+$/) i-found-u

2016-09-16 06:02:17	fcolista	this put a double quote in all the fields
2016-09-16 06:02:57	fcolista	but this breaks the count of the field
2016-09-16 06:03:32	fcolista	anyway
2016-09-16 06:03:51	fcolista	it's interesting for learning
2016-09-16 06:04:12	fcolista	care to explain me how does it work? If you can and/or have time
2016-09-16 06:04:23	fcolista	OFS= set the field separator
2016-09-16 06:04:31	fcolista	than you have a counter
2016-09-16 06:05:07	fcolista	NF is number of field
2016-09-16 06:05:19	fcolista	so in the variable i
2016-09-16 06:05:35	go|dfish	fcolista: yes, so for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) is a way to loop through all the field numbers
2016-09-16 06:05:44	fcolista	each time it matches the pattern /^[0-9]+$/
2016-09-16 06:05:46	go|dfish	so when i = 1, $i is $1 i.e. field 1

2016-09-16 06:10:35	fcolista	very interesting
2016-09-16 06:11:01	fcolista	I suppose thie can be optimized by a better pattern matching regexp
2016-09-16 06:11:06	fcolista	*this
2016-09-16 06:11:33	go|dfish	well, i thought you wanted to "fix" the "broken" lines by adding the double quotes back in

2016-09-16 06:12:00	fcolista	you're right go|dfish, but this alters the number of fields in the CSB

2016-09-16 06:12:16	go|dfish	oh right, yes, that's true

2016-09-16 17:31:59	nal	specifically this part is a little upsetting "The implementation of user-defined functions was a compromise. The chief difficulties arose from the initial design of awk. We did not have, or want, declarations in the language. One result is the peculiar way of declaring local variables as extra formal parameters. Besides looking strange, this is error prone in large programs."

2016-09-16 17:38:50	ttmrichter	Well I solve that issue by not using Awk for large programs.

2016-09-17 13:27:33	drgeb	rods-tab3 that prints the current line

2016-09-17 13:27:48	yitz	What's "next"?
2016-09-17 13:27:50	drgeb	which did  not work
2016-09-17 13:28:21	yitz	"The next statement forces awk to immediately stop processing the current record and go on to the next record. This means that no further rules are executed for the current record, and the rest of the current rule’s action isn’t executed.
2016-09-17 13:28:33	drgeb	here is the input file http://termbin.com/6ujc

2016-09-17 13:28:52	drgeb	so I need to search for oracle.retail.stores.foundation.tour.engine.PseudoSite.arrive\(PseudoSite.java:19
2016-09-17 13:28:54	yitz	Are you sure you want to do "next"?
2016-09-17 13:29:11	drgeb	when I see this I want the next line which can be either
2016-09-17 13:29:34	yitz	Did you read what "next" does?
2016-09-17 13:31:30	drgeb	i think next is for loops
2016-09-17 13:32:19	drgeb	Thanks yitz!!!
2016-09-17 13:32:41	yitz	Do you see a loop anywhere?
2016-09-17 13:33:06	drgeb	Thanks rods-tab3 I was all over the place and not simply calmly reading I guess I want to get this done to quickly and it takes time to learn and understand
2016-09-17 13:33:32	rods-tab3	yes
2016-09-17 13:36:56	drgeb	i now need to store a variable, is there a good site I should ue overall for learning this
2016-09-17 13:37:09	yitz	var = "foo"
2016-09-17 13:37:13	yitz	See the topic
2016-09-17 13:37:22	drgeb	problem is I don’t have lots of time on Monday I am flying to the csutomer
2016-09-17 13:37:49	yitz	You could show a sample input and sample desired output and someone may feel like writing awk for you
2016-09-17 13:38:55	drgeb	Thanks yitz go to play with this construct and see if I can store the result in my first search pattern and display this when it hits my next search pattern

2016-09-17 13:52:34	drgeb	the output looks funky    Letter:"Failure"OldSite: AuthorizationStation. NewSite: TenderingInfoUI
2016-09-17 13:53:03	yitz	You need spaces around variable names
2016-09-17 13:53:17	yitz	Or, rather, around strings you want to join
2016-09-17 13:56:01	drgeb	in the doc it says Strings are concatenated by being adjacent: hw = "hello" "world"  x to "helloworld".  Watch out; this often has surprising properties.
2016-09-17 13:56:01		[13:56]
2016-09-17 13:56:34	drgeb	but I am concatenating while performing a print
2016-09-17 13:57:33	yitz	Strings are concatenated with a " " (space)
2016-09-17 13:57:50	yitz	You can try doing the same thing over and hoping for change or you can believe what you're being told
2016-09-17 14:03:00		[13:57]
2016-09-17 14:04:56	drgeb	:)
2016-09-17 14:06:02	drgeb	I think my newsite variable is funky it contains maybe the newline and this is causing the issue
2016-09-17 14:12:00		[14:06]
2016-09-17 14:20:55	yitz	You mean a carriage return (\r)?
2016-09-17 14:22:55	drgeb	yes
2016-09-17 14:25:17	drgeb	i decided to print each assignment separately and seems ok except Letter: "Failure" contains double quotes so my regexp is not correct where I have
2016-09-17 14:25:42	drgeb	 /BusDriver\ for\ service\ .*\ is\ processing\ \".*\"/ { letter=$7; print "****" letter }
2016-09-17 14:26:28	drgeb	and I have the \” .* \” so i thought it would not make letter be assigned with the double quotes
2016-09-17 14:27:10	drgeb	my output looks like ****"FinalLetter"
2016-09-17 14:27:10		[14:27]
2016-09-17 14:27:20	drgeb	and not ***FinalLetter

2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:28:52] so I need to search for oracle.retail.stores.foundation.tour.engine.PseudoSite.arrive\(PseudoSite.java:19 [23:28:52]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:28:54] Are you sure you want to do "next"? [23:28:54]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:29:11] when I see this I want the next line which can be either [23:29:11]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:29:34] Did you read what "next" does? [23:29:34]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:31:30] i think next is for loops [23:31:30]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:32:19] Thanks yitz!!! [23:32:19]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:32:41] Do you see a loop anywhere? [23:32:41]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:33:06] Thanks rods-tab3 I was all over the place and not simply calmly reading I guess I want to get this done to quickly and it takes time to learn and understand [23:33:06]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	rods-tab3	[23:33:32] yes [23:33:32]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:36:56] i now need to store a variable, is there a good site I should ue overall for learning this [23:36:56]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:37:09] var = "foo" [23:37:09]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:37:13] See the topic [23:37:13]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:37:22] problem is I don’t have lots of time on Monday I am flying to the csutomer [23:37:22]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:37:49] You could show a sample input and sample desired output and someone may feel like writing awk for you [23:37:49]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:38:55] Thanks yitz go to play with this construct and see if I can store the result in my first search pattern and display this when it hits my next search pattern [23:38:55]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	rods-tab3	[23:43:48] !concise [23:43:48]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	hawkbot	[23:43:49]  concise:  http://cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr15/cos333/awk.help [23:43:49]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:44:10] Nice [23:44:10]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:49:23] :) [23:49:23]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:50:05] eek [23:50:05]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:50:14] i updated the code to http://termbin.com/3gej [23:50:14]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:50:56] defined my variables in BEGIN [23:50:56]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:51:28] but then when i say to:            print " Service: "service" OldSite: "oldsite" NewSite: "newsite" Letter:"letter [23:51:28]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	*buffextras	[23:52:20] oliverio!~oliverio@unaffiliated/oliverio joined [23:52:20]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:52:34] the output looks funky    Letter:"Failure"OldSite: AuthorizationStation. NewSite: TenderingInfoUI [23:52:34]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:53:03] You need spaces around variable names [23:53:03]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:53:17] Or, rather, around strings you want to join [23:53:17]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:56:01] in the doc it says Strings are concatenated by being adjacent: hw = "hello" "world"  x to "helloworld".  Watch out; this often has surprising properties. [23:56:01]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:56:34] but I am concatenating while performing a print [23:56:34]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:57:33] Strings are concatenated with a " " (space) [23:57:33]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:57:49] You can try doing the same thing over and hoping for change or you can believe what you're being told [23:57:49]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:04:56] :) [00:04:56]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:06:02] I think my newsite variable is funky it contains maybe the newline and this is causing the issue [00:06:02]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[00:20:55] You mean a carriage return (\r)? [00:20:55]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:22:55] yes [00:22:55]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:25:17] i decided to print each assignment separately and seems ok except Letter: "Failure" contains double quotes so my regexp is not correct where I have [00:25:17]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:25:42]  /BusDriver\ for\ service\ .*\ is\ processing\ \".*\"/ { letter=$7; print "****" letter } [00:25:42]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:26:27] and I have the \” .* \” so i thought it would not make letter be assigned with the double quotes [00:26:27]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:27:09] my output looks like ****"FinalLetter" [00:27:09]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:27:19] and not ***FinalLetter [00:27:19]

2016-09-17 14:53:48	yitz	Yes. The " is treated like any other character in the string
2016-09-17 14:53:56	yitz	You can use gsub() to remove them

2016-09-17 17:35:24	yitz	drgeb: the regex just says if the line matches or not. It doesn't modify the line or the value of $7
2016-09-17 17:36:27	drgeb	I finally got it to work using reverse psychology or reverse expression
2016-09-17 17:36:41	drgeb	so instead of \”(.*)\”
2016-09-17 17:37:00	drgeb	i used v

2016-09-17 17:38:48	drgeb	:) Okie Dokie!!!
2016-09-17 17:38:55	drgeb	Thanks yitz!!!
2016-09-17 17:39:11	yitz	There's good approaches and bad approaches which are learned with experience
2016-09-17 17:39:26	yitz	(Which is what I said 4 hours ago)

2016-09-17 17:50:38	drgeb	with awk are there expressions for parsing words

2016-09-17 18:00:30	drgeb	Can’t figure it out again
2016-09-17 18:00:38	drgeb	I have to parse the string
2016-09-17 18:00:38	drgeb	      BusDriver changes site within InitializeSale service. Old site was CheckAccountability. New site is OperatorIdStation
2016-09-17 18:00:42	drgeb	I have
2016-09-17 18:01:06	drgeb	 /BusDriver changes site within .* service. Old site was ([^\.]*)\. New site is .*/
2016-09-17 18:01:57	drgeb	its greedy and grabbing the period for the string I am interested in at $10
2016-09-17 18:05:55	yitz	awk splits on whitespace
2016-09-17 18:06:24	yitz	You can change the field separator but it defaults to whitespace. So the 10th entry is CheckAccountability.
2016-09-17 18:06:50	yitz	You can use gsub again to strip any '.' from $10
2016-09-17 18:07:13	yitz	val = sub(/\.$/, "", $10)

2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[03:35:24] drgeb: the regex just says if the line matches or not. It doesn't modify the line or the value of $7 [03:35:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:36:27] I finally got it to work using reverse psychology or reverse expression [03:36:27]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:36:41] so instead of \”(.*)\” [03:36:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:37:00] i used v [03:37:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:37:02] \"([^\"]*)\"/ [03:37:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:37:45] oopsy control v paste  messed me up :) but 45 minutes lost for just something this simple and crazy in writting expressions [03:37:45]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[03:38:25] drgeb: Next time try sharing your input line and sample output and ask someone to show how to best achieve it :P [03:38:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:38:48] :) Okie Dokie!!! [03:38:48]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:38:55] Thanks yitz!!! [03:38:55]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[03:39:11] There's good approaches and bad approaches which are learned with experience [03:39:11]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[03:39:26] (Which is what I said 4 hours ago) [03:39:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:50:15] :) [03:50:15]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:50:38] with awk are there expressions for parsing words [03:50:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:00:29] Can’t figure it out again [04:00:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:00:38] I have to parse the string [04:00:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:00:38]       BusDriver changes site within InitializeSale service. Old site was CheckAccountability. New site is OperatorIdStation [04:00:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:00:42] I have [04:00:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:01:06]  /BusDriver changes site within .* service. Old site was ([^\.]*)\. New site is .*/ [04:01:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:01:57] its greedy and grabbing the period for the string I am interested in at $10 [04:01:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[04:05:55] awk splits on whitespace [04:05:55]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[04:06:24] You can change the field separator but it defaults to whitespace. So the 10th entry is CheckAccountability. [04:06:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[04:06:50] You can use gsub again to strip any '.' from $10 [04:06:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[04:07:13] val = sub(/\.$/, "", $10) [04:07:13]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:24:57] nope getting a 1 [04:24:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:24:59] http://termbin.com/cqny [04:24:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:25:18] so it keeps printing OldSite: 1 [04:25:18]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	nal1	[04:27:02] the hell is var? [04:27:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:27:23] ? [04:27:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	nal1	[04:28:35] drgeb: ? [04:28:35]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	nal1	[04:29:18] drgeb: thats not how you set variables [04:29:18]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[04:31:07] My bad. var = $10; sub(/\.$/, "", var) [04:31:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[05:56:10] well i got my inital picture [05:56:10]

2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[03:35:24] drgeb: the regex just says if the line matches or not. It doesn't modify the line or the value of $7 [03:35:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:36:27] I finally got it to work using reverse psychology or reverse expression [03:36:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:36:41] so instead of \”(.*)\” [03:36:41]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:37:00] i used v [03:37:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:37:02] \"([^\"]*)\"/ [03:37:02]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:37:45] oopsy control v paste  messed me up :) but 45 minutes lost for just something this simple and crazy in writting expressions [03:37:45]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[03:38:25] drgeb: Next time try sharing your input line and sample output and ask someone to show how to best achieve it :P [03:38:25]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:38:48] :) Okie Dokie!!! [03:38:48]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:38:55] Thanks yitz!!! [03:38:55]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[03:39:11] There's good approaches and bad approaches which are learned with experience [03:39:11]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[03:39:26] (Which is what I said 4 hours ago) [03:39:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:50:15] :) [03:50:15]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:50:38] with awk are there expressions for parsing words [03:50:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:00:29] Can’t figure it out again [04:00:29]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:00:38] I have to parse the string [04:00:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:00:38]       BusDriver changes site within InitializeSale service. Old site was CheckAccountability. New site is OperatorIdStation [04:00:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:00:42] I have [04:00:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:01:06]  /BusDriver changes site within .* service. Old site was ([^\.]*)\. New site is .*/ [04:01:06]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:01:57] its greedy and grabbing the period for the string I am interested in at $10 [04:01:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[04:05:55] awk splits on whitespace [04:05:55]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[04:06:24] You can change the field separator but it defaults to whitespace. So the 10th entry is CheckAccountability. [04:06:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[04:06:50] You can use gsub again to strip any '.' from $10 [04:06:50]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[04:07:13] val = sub(/\.$/, "", $10) [04:07:13]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:24:57] nope getting a 1 [04:24:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:24:59] http://termbin.com/cqny [04:24:59]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:25:18] so it keeps printing OldSite: 1 [04:25:18]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	nal1	[04:27:02] the hell is var? [04:27:02]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:27:23] ? [04:27:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	nal1	[04:28:35] drgeb: ? [04:28:35]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	nal1	[04:29:18] drgeb: thats not how you set variables [04:29:18]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[04:31:07] My bad. var = $10; sub(/\.$/, "", var) [04:31:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[05:56:10] well i got my inital picture [05:56:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[05:56:24] not sure how I can post this so you can see it [05:56:24]

2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[10:00:28] I should change my nick since this val thing is higlighting my name. [10:00:28]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[10:00:31] where can I complain? [10:00:31]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[10:00:46] ^^ [10:00:46]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	Riviera	[10:08:14] the IRC committee [10:08:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:08:45] lol Riviera [11:08:45]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:09:15] It's werid because my nich still has those underscores but anyways I don't think anyone cres. [11:09:15]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:09:20] cares even. [11:09:20]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	Riviera	[11:16:08] Since you are anyway mostly not active in IRC, at least as far as I can tell, I think you yourself don't care too much. :) [11:16:08]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:20:35] Riviera: I am quite often on irc. Just observing and learning from ccleintelligent people. [11:20:35]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:21:01] jesus. This lag is annoying [11:21:01]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	Riviera	[11:21:32] Did you try mosh? [11:21:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:23:28] Riviera: you mean the "Mobile Shell" ? [11:23:28]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	Riviera	[11:24:33] yup! [11:24:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:26:11] I am using irssi in a screen session(which runs at work). I think the connection from home to work is wanky. [11:26:11]

2016-09-19 02:43:55	drgeb	[04:00:38] I have to parse the string [04:00:38]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	drgeb	[04:00:38]       BusDriver changes site within InitializeSale service. Old site was CheckAccountability. New site is OperatorIdStation [04:00:38]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	drgeb	[04:00:42] I have [04:00:42]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	drgeb	[04:01:06]  /BusDriver changes site within .* service. Old site was ([^\.]*)\. New site is .*/ [04:01:06]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	drgeb	[04:01:57] its greedy and grabbing the period for the string I am interested in at $10 [04:01:57]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	yitz	[04:05:55] awk splits on whitespace [04:05:55]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	yitz	[04:06:24] You can change the field separator but it defaults to whitespace. So the 10th entry is CheckAccountability. [04:06:24]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	yitz	[04:06:50] You can use gsub again to strip any '.' from $10 [04:06:50]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	yitz	[04:07:13] val = sub(/\.$/, "", $10) [04:07:13]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	drgeb	[04:24:57] nope getting a 1 [04:24:57]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	drgeb	[04:24:59] http://termbin.com/cqny [04:24:59]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	drgeb	[04:25:18] so it keeps printing OldSite: 1 [04:25:18]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	nal1	[04:27:02] the hell is var? [04:27:02]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	drgeb	[04:27:23] ? [04:27:23]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	nal1	[04:28:35] drgeb: ? [04:28:35]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	nal1	[04:29:18] drgeb: thats not how you set variables [04:29:18]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	yitz	[04:31:07] My bad. var = $10; sub(/\.$/, "", var) [04:31:07]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	drgeb	[05:56:10] well i got my inital picture [05:56:10]

2016-09-19 02:43:55	_val_	[10:00:28] I should change my nick since this val thing is higlighting my name. [10:00:28]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	_val_	[10:00:31] where can I complain? [10:00:31]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	_val_	[10:00:46] ^^ [10:00:46]

2016-09-19 02:43:55	_val_	[11:08:45] lol Riviera [11:08:45]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	_val_	[11:09:15] It's werid because my nich still has those underscores but anyways I don't think anyone cres. [11:09:15]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	_val_	[11:09:20] cares even. [11:09:20]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	Riviera	[11:16:08] Since you are anyway mostly not active in IRC, at least as far as I can tell, I think you yourself don't care too much. :) [11:16:08]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	_val_	[11:20:35] Riviera: I am quite often on irc. Just observing and learning from ccleintelligent people. [11:20:35]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	_val_	[11:21:01] jesus. This lag is annoying [11:21:01]

2016-09-19 02:43:55	_val_	[11:23:28] Riviera: you mean the "Mobile Shell" ? [11:23:28]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	Riviera	[11:24:33] yup! [11:24:33]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	_val_	[11:26:11] I am using irssi in a screen session(which runs at work). I think the connection from home to work is wanky. [11:26:11]

2016-09-19 02:43:55	rods-tab3	[02:10:46] 2nd not a bug - something(value) is a function call [02:10:46]

2016-09-19 02:43:55	geirha	[07:19:00] print OFS "" ("OK")   might be a workaround [07:19:00]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	izalove	[07:25:07] why ("OK") ? [07:25:07]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	geirha	[07:33:07] to provoke an error, why else? [07:33:07]

2016-09-19 05:16:05	ash_workz	I'm formatting columns
2016-09-19 05:17:11	linedash	just as an aside, which isn't awk - but might make your life easier
2016-09-19 05:17:21	linedash	have you tried parsing your output through the 'column' command ?
2016-09-19 05:17:37	linedash	as it's designed to auto-column things
2016-09-19 05:17:49	ash_workz	linedash: no... but can you format flush left-right with column?
2016-09-19 05:18:07	linedash	honestly; no idea
2016-09-19 05:18:09	linedash	man column :)

2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[14:21:26] can' [14:21:26]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[14:21:42] can't get it to work :\ [14:21:42]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[14:22:00] but yeah the $1=$1 doesn't do the trick; I need to strip \w from ALL fields [14:22:00]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[14:22:22] so '    some      ,    thing     ,    one       ' => 'some,thing,one' [14:22:22]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	bwe	[15:04:55] xpt: I was just searching for some means to highlight the EOS. [15:04:55]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:05:00] gsub(" +", "") worked [15:05:00]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:05:16] without identifying a target [15:05:16]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:05:53] is it possible to perform a variable check on each field [15:05:53]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	bwe	[15:06:05] ash_workz: sub is wrong as it stops after one substitution. gsub is what you want. My fault. [15:06:05]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:07:52] for example, if NF is the current field number being checked, then `length($NF) > var[NF] { var[NF] = length($NF)} END { print var[NF] }` [15:07:52]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:09:03] NF isn't what I want though [15:09:03]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:09:07] because NF = Number of FIelds [15:09:07]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:09:16] which is obviously the last field [15:09:16]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:09:31] I'm looking for something iterative [15:09:31]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:10:03] so I can do something like if $1 = ..., if $2 = ..., if $3 = ..., etc. [15:10:03]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:12:56] maybe I can't do it outside '{}' [15:12:56]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	waldner	[15:14:39] for (i = 1; i<= NF; i++) { ... do something with $i ... } [15:14:39]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:14:53] yeah, that goes in an action thought [15:14:53]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:15:07] I was hoping to run length() on each field outside the action [15:15:07]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	waldner	[15:15:45] said that way it doesn't make much sense [15:15:45]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	waldner	[15:15:52] what's your real goal? [15:15:52]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:16:05] I'm formatting columns [15:16:05]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	linedash	[15:17:11] just as an aside, which isn't awk - but might make your life easier [15:17:11]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	linedash	[15:17:21] have you tried parsing your output through the 'column' command ? [15:17:21]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	linedash	[15:17:37] as it's designed to auto-column things [15:17:37]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:17:49] linedash: no... but can you format flush left-right with column? [15:17:49]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	linedash	[15:18:07] honestly; no idea [15:18:07]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	linedash	[15:18:09] man column :) [15:18:09]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:18:51] I don't see it [15:18:51]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:18:53] in there [15:18:53]

2016-09-20 00:39:06	Camusensei	[08:21:06] Hello guys. Yesterday, I wanted to create an array, but didn't know how to do that, so I did something like this: awk '{g["A"]=1; g["B"]=1; g["C"]=1; g["D"]=1; g["E"]=1; g["F"]=1; ...'  What could I have used instead? [08:21:06]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	geirha	[08:21:58] an extra input file [08:21:58]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	Camusensei	[08:28:26] sounds even more complicated :D [08:28:26]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	geirha	[08:39:35] awk 'FNR==NR{g[$1]=1;next} ...' <(printf '%s\n' {A..F}) ... [08:39:35]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	linedash	[08:41:47] geirha: sometimes I think I know a good bit of awk, then you paste something casually and I'm like 'nope, I know nothing' [08:41:47]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	linedash	[08:41:54] :D [08:41:54]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	Camusensei	[09:06:53] haha linedash [09:06:53]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	Riviera	[09:55:48] Camusensei: When already relying on a particular awk variant (like gawk) you could use   split("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", g, "")   # not POSIX [09:55:48]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	Riviera	[09:55:56] ah, damn. [09:55:56]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	Riviera	[09:55:59] misread the task. :D [09:55:59]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	Riviera	[09:57:06] Camusensei: well, I think I'd just write it out like you did, or use a loop and sprintf() if it were more than A..F [09:57:06]

2016-09-20 12:46:45	Riviera	epequeno: Do you have any idea, any guess?
2016-09-20 12:49:26	epequeno	when the regex matches, we set a var to 1, at the end, we use that 1, somehow that tells awk to keep printing to the EOF
2016-09-20 12:49:26		[12:49]
2016-09-20 12:50:15	epequeno	which behaves the same way as '/^t/,0' somehow
2016-09-20 12:50:18	Riviera	epequeno: Do you know you can not only use regexes as conditions?  Also things like
2016-09-20 12:50:27	Riviera	epequeno: awk 'NR > 3 { print }'
2016-09-20 12:50:39	Riviera	epequeno: ?
2016-09-20 12:50:43	epequeno	sure
2016-09-20 12:50:49	Riviera	epequeno: now let's do the following
2016-09-20 12:50:54	Riviera	epequeno: awk 'q { print }'
2016-09-20 12:51:09	Riviera	epequeno: That's quite similar to the NR > 3 thing before, isn't it?
2016-09-20 12:51:15	epequeno	yes
2016-09-20 12:51:31	Camusensei	_Raiz: awkshift (){ [[ $1 != *[!0-9]* && $1 != '' ]] || return 1;awk -v n=$1 '{for (i=n+1;i<=NF;i+=1) $(i-n)=$i; newNF=NF-n; if (newNF > 0) NF=newNF; else NF=0}1';}
2016-09-20 12:51:37	Riviera	epequeno: "print the current record when q is true", right?
2016-09-20 12:51:52	epequeno	yes that makes sense
2016-09-20 12:52:09	Riviera	epequeno: we can omit { print }, because that's the default action when no action is given,
2016-09-20 12:52:27	Riviera	epequeno: so "awk q" would print its input if q were true
2016-09-20 12:52:36	epequeno	right...
2016-09-20 12:52:42	Riviera	epequeno: of course "q" is not true, because it's initialised as 0, but we could test that with
2016-09-20 12:52:45	Riviera	epequeno: awk 1
2016-09-20 12:52:49	Riviera	# seq 2 | awk 1
2016-09-20 12:52:51	shbot	Riviera: one
2016-09-20 12:52:51	shbot	Riviera: two
2016-09-20 12:52:59	Riviera	epequeno: so, well, I believe your question is answered? :)
2016-09-20 12:53:43	epequeno	yes I think so, but negative values are truthy in awk?
2016-09-20 12:53:53	epequeno	setting it to -1 instead does the same thing
2016-09-20 12:53:58	epequeno	but 0 doesn't work
2016-09-20 12:54:41	Riviera	epequeno: 0 counts as false, and the empty string does
2016-09-20 12:54:59	epequeno	ok, so when we match the first regex, we set some value to true then evaluate it the next record doesn't have to match the regex as x is still set to 1 and we'll continue to print to EOF
2016-09-20 12:55:46	Riviera	epequeno: correct
2016-09-20 12:56:19	epequeno	ok thank you, while that makes the first example make sense now `/^t/,0` makes less sense

2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:44:38] I don't understand how {q=1}q is working here: https://gist.github.com/epequeno/f08a8779e52609a6584a8aac9449bc45 [22:44:38]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:46:45] epequeno: Do you have any idea, any guess? [22:46:45]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:49:26] when the regex matches, we set a var to 1, at the end, we use that 1, somehow that tells awk to keep printing to the EOF [22:49:26]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:50:15] which behaves the same way as '/^t/,0' somehow [22:50:15]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:50:18] epequeno: Do you know you can not only use regexes as conditions?  Also things like [22:50:18]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:50:27] epequeno: awk 'NR > 3 { print }' [22:50:27]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:50:39] epequeno: ? [22:50:39]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:50:43] sure [22:50:43]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:50:49] epequeno: now let's do the following [22:50:49]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:50:54] epequeno: awk 'q { print }' [22:50:54]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:51:09] epequeno: That's quite similar to the NR > 3 thing before, isn't it? [22:51:09]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:51:15] yes [22:51:15]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Camusensei	[22:51:31] _Raiz: awkshift (){ [[ $1 != *[!0-9]* && $1 != '' ]] || return 1;awk -v n=$1 '{for (i=n+1;i<=NF;i+=1) $(i-n)=$i; newNF=NF-n; if (newNF > 0) NF=newNF; else NF=0}1';} [22:51:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:51:37] epequeno: "print the current record when q is true", right? [22:51:37]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:51:52] yes that makes sense [22:51:52]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:52:09] epequeno: we can omit { print }, because that's the default action when no action is given, [22:52:09]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:52:27] epequeno: so "awk q" would print its input if q were true [22:52:27]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:52:36] right... [22:52:36]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:52:42] epequeno: of course "q" is not true, because it's initialised as 0, but we could test that with [22:52:42]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:52:45] epequeno: awk 1 [22:52:45]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:52:49] # seq 2 | awk 1 [22:52:49]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	shbot	[22:52:51] Riviera: one [22:52:51]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	shbot	[22:52:51] Riviera: two [22:52:51]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:52:59] epequeno: so, well, I believe your question is answered? :) [22:52:59]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:53:43] yes I think so, but negative values are truthy in awk? [22:53:43]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:53:53] setting it to -1 instead does the same thing [22:53:53]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:53:58] but 0 doesn't work [22:53:58]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:54:41] epequeno: 0 counts as false, and the empty string does [22:54:41]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:54:59] ok, so when we match the first regex, we set some value to true then evaluate it the next record doesn't have to match the regex as x is still set to 1 and we'll continue to print to EOF [22:54:59]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:55:46] epequeno: correct [22:55:46]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:56:19] ok thank you, while that makes the first example make sense now `/^t/,0` makes less sense [22:56:19]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:57:02] agreed :) [22:57:02]

2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:50:27] epequeno: awk 'NR > 3 { print }' [22:50:27]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:50:39] epequeno: ? [22:50:39]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	epequeno	[22:50:43] sure [22:50:43]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:50:49] epequeno: now let's do the following [22:50:49]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:50:54] epequeno: awk 'q { print }' [22:50:54]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:51:09] epequeno: That's quite similar to the NR > 3 thing before, isn't it? [22:51:09]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	epequeno	[22:51:15] yes [22:51:15]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Camusensei	[22:51:31] _Raiz: awkshift (){ [[ $1 != *[!0-9]* && $1 != '' ]] || return 1;awk -v n=$1 '{for (i=n+1;i<=NF;i+=1) $(i-n)=$i; newNF=NF-n; if (newNF > 0) NF=newNF; else NF=0}1';} [22:51:31]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:51:37] epequeno: "print the current record when q is true", right? [22:51:37]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	epequeno	[22:51:52] yes that makes sense [22:51:52]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:52:09] epequeno: we can omit { print }, because that's the default action when no action is given, [22:52:09]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:52:27] epequeno: so "awk q" would print its input if q were true [22:52:27]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	epequeno	[22:52:36] right... [22:52:36]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:52:42] epequeno: of course "q" is not true, because it's initialised as 0, but we could test that with [22:52:42]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:52:45] epequeno: awk 1 [22:52:45]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:52:49] # seq 2 | awk 1 [22:52:49]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	shbot	[22:52:51] Riviera: one [22:52:51]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	shbot	[22:52:51] Riviera: two [22:52:51]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:52:59] epequeno: so, well, I believe your question is answered? :) [22:52:59]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	epequeno	[22:53:43] yes I think so, but negative values are truthy in awk? [22:53:43]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	epequeno	[22:53:53] setting it to -1 instead does the same thing [22:53:53]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	epequeno	[22:53:58] but 0 doesn't work [22:53:58]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:54:41] epequeno: 0 counts as false, and the empty string does [22:54:41]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	epequeno	[22:54:59] ok, so when we match the first regex, we set some value to true then evaluate it the next record doesn't have to match the regex as x is still set to 1 and we'll continue to print to EOF [22:54:59]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:55:46] epequeno: correct [22:55:46]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	epequeno	[22:56:19] ok thank you, while that makes the first example make sense now `/^t/,0` makes less sense [22:56:19]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:57:02] agreed :) [22:57:02]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	medi	[11:31:18] i want to match a character to the last character in a field. can i use indexing to access the last character of a field? [11:31:18]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	medi	[11:36:48] decided on substr method [11:36:48]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	xpt	[11:49:36] printf %s\\n  an and | awk '$1 ~ /n$/' [11:49:36]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	xpt	[11:49:39] # printf %s\\n  an and | awk '$1 ~ /n$/' [11:49:39]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	shbot	[11:49:41] xpt: an [11:49:41]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	xpt	[11:49:51] medi: ^ I'd use regexp for that [11:49:51]

2016-09-21 19:07:00	epequeno	[22:49:26] when the regex matches, we set a var to 1, at the end, we use that 1, somehow that tells awk to keep printing to the EOF [22:49:26]

2016-09-21 19:07:00	epequeno	[22:53:53] setting it to -1 instead does the same thing [22:53:53]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	epequeno	[22:53:58] but 0 doesn't work [22:53:58]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	Riviera	[22:54:41] epequeno: 0 counts as false, and the empty string does [22:54:41]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	epequeno	[22:54:59] ok, so when we match the first regex, we set some value to true then evaluate it the next record doesn't have to match the regex as x is still set to 1 and we'll continue to print to EOF [22:54:59]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	Riviera	[22:55:46] epequeno: correct [22:55:46]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	epequeno	[22:56:19] ok thank you, while that makes the first example make sense now `/^t/,0` makes less sense [22:56:19]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	Riviera	[22:57:02] agreed :) [22:57:02]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	medi	[11:31:18] i want to match a character to the last character in a field. can i use indexing to access the last character of a field? [11:31:18]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	medi	[11:36:48] decided on substr method [11:36:48]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	xpt	[11:49:36] printf %s\\n  an and | awk '$1 ~ /n$/' [11:49:36]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	xpt	[11:49:39] # printf %s\\n  an and | awk '$1 ~ /n$/' [11:49:39]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	shbot	[11:49:41] xpt: an [11:49:41]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	xpt	[11:49:51] medi: ^ I'd use regexp for that [11:49:51]

2016-09-22 00:23:53	izalove	[15:42:12] nope [15:42:12]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	_Raiz	[15:43:11] dammit [15:43:11]

2016-09-22 00:23:53	_Raiz	[15:58:54] xpt, good idea [15:58:54]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	epequeno	[22:44:38] I don't understand how {q=1}q is working here: https://gist.github.com/epequeno/f08a8779e52609a6584a8aac9449bc45 [22:44:38]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:46:45] epequeno: Do you have any idea, any guess? [22:46:45]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	epequeno	[22:49:26] when the regex matches, we set a var to 1, at the end, we use that 1, somehow that tells awk to keep printing to the EOF [22:49:26]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	epequeno	[22:50:15] which behaves the same way as '/^t/,0' somehow [22:50:15]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:50:18] epequeno: Do you know you can not only use regexes as conditions?  Also things like [22:50:18]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:50:27] epequeno: awk 'NR > 3 { print }' [22:50:27]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:50:39] epequeno: ? [22:50:39]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	epequeno	[22:50:43] sure [22:50:43]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:50:49] epequeno: now let's do the following [22:50:49]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:50:54] epequeno: awk 'q { print }' [22:50:54]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:51:09] epequeno: That's quite similar to the NR > 3 thing before, isn't it? [22:51:09]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	epequeno	[22:51:15] yes [22:51:15]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Camusensei	[22:51:31] _Raiz: awkshift (){ [[ $1 != *[!0-9]* && $1 != '' ]] || return 1;awk -v n=$1 '{for (i=n+1;i<=NF;i+=1) $(i-n)=$i; newNF=NF-n; if (newNF > 0) NF=newNF; else NF=0}1';} [22:51:31]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:51:37] epequeno: "print the current record when q is true", right? [22:51:37]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	epequeno	[22:51:52] yes that makes sense [22:51:52]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:52:09] epequeno: we can omit { print }, because that's the default action when no action is given, [22:52:09]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:52:27] epequeno: so "awk q" would print its input if q were true [22:52:27]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	epequeno	[22:52:36] right... [22:52:36]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:52:42] epequeno: of course "q" is not true, because it's initialised as 0, but we could test that with [22:52:42]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:52:45] epequeno: awk 1 [22:52:45]

2016-09-23 03:23:58	eoli3n	hi
2016-09-23 03:24:56	eoli3n	i have a continuus flux on stdin comming to awk, i want to tail -f file | awk -F "." '{ system("dialog --gauge test 100 100 "$1) }'
2016-09-23 03:25:17	eoli3n	problem is that dialog system call is executed just when i ctrl+c
2016-09-23 03:25:46	eoli3n	or the tail "finish" (it's not really a tail, cause i'm using other thing, but that's for the exemple)
2016-09-23 03:26:05	eoli3n	how to tell to awk to execute systemcall at each new line on stdin ?
2016-09-23 03:26:23	linedash	check you don't have a blank line at the end of your input
2016-09-23 03:26:27	eoli3n	i tried mawk with -W interactive which did not made work
2016-09-23 03:26:50	izalove	try   stdbuf -oL tail -f file
2016-09-23 03:26:59	eoli3n	i already use it izalove
2016-09-23 03:27:04	eoli3n	but at the top of my line

2016-09-23 03:27:17	geirha	tail -f does not buffer
2016-09-23 03:27:17	eoli3n	linedash: i dont think cause if i juste print $1, it works
2016-09-23 03:27:26	eoli3n	15:20:26     eoli3n | or the tail "finish" (it's not really a tail, cause i'm using other thing, but that's for the exemple)

2016-09-23 03:28:48	eoli3n	tha'ts a python script which output line like these one
2016-09-23 03:29:04	eoli3n	i dont get what you mean so ?
2016-09-23 03:29:40	geirha	ah, I guess gauge probably reads stdin to move the bar somehow
2016-09-23 03:29:51	eoli3n	it does and  ?
2016-09-23 03:30:01	eoli3n	if i do :
2016-09-23 03:30:18	geirha	so question is what awk does with system()'s stdin
2016-09-23 03:30:25	eoli3n	for i in {1..100};do dialog --gauge 100 100 $i; sleep 1; done, it works
2016-09-23 03:30:38	geirha	really? you run 100 dialog instances?
2016-09-23 03:30:43	eoli3n	nop
2016-09-23 03:30:45	eoli3n	i pgreped it
2016-09-23 03:30:49	eoli3n	ah
2016-09-23 03:30:53	eoli3n	no sorry bad example
2016-09-23 03:30:55	eoli3n	you're right
2016-09-23 03:31:12	eoli3n	for i in {1..100};do echo $i; sleep 1; done | dialog --gauge test 100 100 0
2016-09-23 03:31:31	geirha	so ... you don't really want awk at all probably
2016-09-23 03:31:39	eoli3n	i need cause
2016-09-23 03:31:56	eoli3n	dialog $2 --gauge test 100 100 $1
2016-09-23 03:32:12	geirha	$2?

2016-09-23 03:32:22	eoli3n	where $1 = 15
2016-09-23 03:32:33	eoli3n	$2 rest of the line
2016-09-23 03:32:40	eoli3n	in dialog comment
2016-09-23 03:32:50	eoli3n	not really $2 but the rest of the line
2016-09-23 03:33:08	eoli3n	i dont know how to tell that to awk, everything exept $1
2016-09-23 03:33:10	geirha	so you want to read the first line, then pass the rest to dialog
2016-09-23 03:33:18	eoli3n	nop
2016-09-23 03:33:55	geirha	surely 15.5 is the percentage, else your awk makes no sense
2016-09-23 03:33:56	eoli3n	for each new line, parse the line to send $1 which is in percent progress bar, to dialog numeric value, and the reste of the line to dialog's comment
2016-09-23 03:34:12	eoli3n	geirha: dialog dont has . values
2016-09-23 03:34:17	eoli3n	just 15 works
2016-09-23 03:35:28	eoli3n	so for now, just want to understand why system just execute my dialog line if i cancel the process
2016-09-23 03:35:41	eoli3n	s/system/awk system call
2016-09-23 03:36:40	eoli3n	is there any hack with fflush() ?
2016-09-23 03:37:10	geirha	... | gawk -F '{pct=int($1); sub(/[^ ]*/,""); printf("XXX\n%d\n%s\n",pct, $0); fflush()}' | dialog --gauge test 100 100
2016-09-23 03:37:20	eoli3n	wow !!
2016-09-23 03:37:46	eoli3n	nop
2016-09-23 03:37:49	eoli3n	dont work
2016-09-23 03:37:59	geirha	oops, left the -F in there
2016-09-23 03:38:04	geirha	... | gawk '{pct=int($1); sub(/[^ ]*/,""); printf("XXX\n%d\n%s\n",pct, $0); fflush()}' | dialog --gauge test 100 100
2016-09-23 03:38:30	geirha	maybe there should be a closing XXX too
2016-09-23 03:38:33	eoli3n	near but, percent keeps stay at 0
2016-09-23 03:38:39	geirha	the manual is a bit vague on that part
2016-09-23 03:38:53	eoli3n	comment part is working
2016-09-23 03:38:59	eoli3n	but % gauge not
2016-09-23 03:38:59		[03:38]
2016-09-23 03:39:15	eoli3n	it works
2016-09-23 03:39:18	geirha	are you sure the first whitespace separated word of the line is the percentage?
2016-09-23 03:39:29	eoli3n	but it refresh each second to print 30% then 0% etc
2016-09-23 03:39:41	eoli3n	it is not
2016-09-23 03:39:48	eoli3n	i need to cut .5 from 15.5
2016-09-23 03:39:57	eoli3n	cause dialog just use entire num

2016-09-23 03:40:42	geirha	yeah, needs the closing XXX

2016-09-23 03:41:19	eoli3n	your line is hard to understand for me ^^ i cannot modify it

2016-09-23 12:21:00	eoli3n	[14:16:56] i dont know how to printf with this ? [14:16:56]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	geirha	[14:17:04] multiple lines, like the awk did ... [14:17:04]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	geirha	[14:17:20] haven't you read about --gauge in man dialog yet? [14:17:20]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	geirha	[14:17:31] It explains how it treats stdin [14:17:31]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eoli3n	[14:17:49] hm [14:17:49]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eoli3n	[14:17:51] stdbuf -o0 python2.7 murder_client_dsed.py peer /net/dspackages/xenial-3/deploy.torrent /tmp/torrent.out 10.5.99.42 | gawk '{pct=int($1); sub(/[^ ]*/,""); printf(pct, $0); fflush()}' | dialog --gauge deploy 100 100 [14:17:51]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eoli3n	[14:17:56] this is not working, but i check the man [14:17:56]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eoli3n	[14:18:21] sprunge.us/fUgg [14:18:21]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eoli3n	[14:18:26] http://sprunge.us/fUgg [14:18:26]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	geirha	[14:18:46] drop the awk... [14:18:46]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	geirha	[14:19:14] also, you can use python's -u switch instead of stdbuf [14:19:14]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	geirha	[14:23:42] and next up, you can probably find some python module that can output a progress bar similar to dialog via pip [14:23:42]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	geirha	[14:24:14] anyway, I'm off. *poof* [14:24:14]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eoli3n	[14:24:20] python -u is working [14:24:20]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eoli3n	[14:24:22] thx a lot [14:24:22]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	go|dfish	[14:50:01] tqdm is the module used for the progress bar [14:50:01]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	crucialrhyme	[15:02:50] how weird/complicated would it be to implement awk (or a useful subset)? like as a side project for someone who has half-remembered knowledge of undergrad compilers but not much actual PL implementation experience [15:02:50]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	izalove	[15:03:35] i wrote an awk that can interpret like 80-90% of the scripts [15:03:35]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	izalove	[15:04:16] https://gist.github.com/izabera/05d34f3179c7c9bcffdb3dbfa9f9c940 [15:04:16]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	crucialrhyme	[15:04:52] ok that definitely convinces me to give it a shot [15:04:52]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	izalove	[15:05:01] no that was a joke [15:05:01]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	crucialrhyme	[15:05:08] oh i see [15:05:08]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	crucialrhyme	[15:05:20] i should probably read this code more carefully [15:05:20]

2016-09-23 12:21:00	hawkbot	[15:07:51] CS Classic and essential reference: "The Awk Programming Language" (Aho, Kernighan and Weinberger, 1988) is highly recommended | http://awk.freeshell.org/FIXES [15:07:51]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	crucialrhyme	[15:08:05] ok at the line or character level this probably does support 90% of all awk scripts ever written lol [15:08:05]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	izalove	[15:08:10] crucialrhyme: ^ there's a parser example in that book [15:08:10]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	crucialrhyme	[15:08:24] but like could i hit 90% of all unique awk scripts, i wonder, in a reasonable amount of effort [15:08:24]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	crucialrhyme	[15:08:31] thanks i will take a look [15:08:31]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	Jinxed-win	[16:28:21] Is there a quick way to subtract arrays in bash using awk? [16:28:21]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	izalove	[16:28:39] what does subtracting array mean? [16:28:39]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	Jinxed-win	[16:31:44] I have a sorted list of values, and I am trying to find the closest two values... so bash is too slow to itterate through the values, I have a fast sorting method... so I figured there may be a quick way to take two arrays subtract them and then find the min of the result [16:31:44]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	@mute	[16:40:47] i think there's a bash faq about that [16:40:47]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	izalove	[16:45:12] Jinxed-win: how would you do it in c++? [16:45:12]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	Jinxed-win	[16:47:46] I figured out a solution... it just is really weird... more of bash related will post in bash [16:47:46]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eolien	[18:02:06] hi, i didn't thank the guy which help me today, with this dialog menu pb [18:02:06]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eolien	[18:02:24] it was on another computer so i cant get his name [18:02:24]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eolien	[18:03:13] but biggest thx dude, it wasn't a awk pb and you spent some time for me, i got it finally, it works now, exactly as i want, without awk :) [18:03:13]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	Riviera	[18:06:05] eolien: I believe that was geirha? [18:06:05]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eolien	[18:06:15] it was him [18:06:15]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eolien	[18:06:19] high five geirha !! [18:06:19]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	jeffreylevesque	[20:19:47] i'd like to check use awk to check if a redirected string contains a substring [20:19:47]

2016-09-25 03:59:01	geirha	if it doesn't have grep, it likely doesn't have awk
2016-09-25 03:59:24	geirha	as for windows shell, I don't know it well enough, but I'm fairly certain you can't use '' quotes
2016-09-25 04:00:19	geirha	can't you just run NET USE alone, capture its output in ruby, and do the matching in ruby? sounds easier and faster to me ...

2016-09-25 09:07:25	eolien	didnt get what you mean izalove
2016-09-25 09:07:37	eolien	i want to format pv output
2016-09-25 09:07:52	izalove	what part isn't clear?
2016-09-25 09:08:00	eolien	that awk command is just cat
2016-09-25 09:08:19	izalove	awk -F " " '{printf "%s\n", $0}'    <- what does this do?
2016-09-25 09:08:26	eolien	maybe i misundestand printf part
2016-09-25 09:08:38	izalove	it reads each line, then prints it
2016-09-25 09:08:47	eolien	this normally print pv output, but each refresh as new line
2016-09-25 09:08:57	eolien	not as pv display by flushing output each second
2016-09-25 09:09:04	eolien	that's what i expected
2016-09-25 09:09:12	izalove	there are several problems
2016-09-25 09:09:35	eolien	it reads each line, then prints it + \n
2016-09-25 09:09:35	izalove	first, pv prints that diagnostic to stderr and not stdout
2016-09-25 09:09:43	eolien	ah !
2016-09-25 09:09:59	izalove	you want    2>&1 > /tmp/file.out | ...
2016-09-25 09:10:19	izalove	but then pv will see that it's not printing to a terminal
2016-09-25 09:10:31	izalove	so it may or may not print at all
2016-09-25 09:10:39	eolien	not print
2016-09-25 09:10:40	eolien	i just tried
2016-09-25 09:10:53	izalove	there's not much you can do about it
2016-09-25 09:11:19	eolien	i cant format pv output with awk and printf ?
2016-09-25 09:11:59	eolien	the fact is that i want to dialog this. there's a pv with dialog exemple in man pv, but it only pass percentage
2016-09-25 09:12:00	izalove	if pv doesn't print it, it's unlikely that you can format it
2016-09-25 09:12:02	eolien	i want ETA too
2016-09-25 09:12:47	izalove	read the whole man page
2016-09-25 09:12:51	izalove	not just the examples
2016-09-25 09:12:57	izalove	especially the FORMATTING section
2016-09-25 09:13:14	eolien	that's what i'm doing
2016-09-25 09:13:21	eolien	but dialog dont get it
2016-09-25 09:13:32	izalove	what?
2016-09-25 09:13:50	eolien	-F "%p", or any other format
2016-09-25 09:13:56	eolien	dialog dont get this
2016-09-25 09:14:12	izalove	"dialog dont get this"   <- what does this mean?
2016-09-25 09:14:39	izalove	do you mean you're sending this output in a window created by the dialog utility?
2016-09-25 09:16:08	eolien	yep
2016-09-25 09:17:33	izalove	i don't know but i don't think you can use dialog for this
2016-09-25 09:17:43	eolien	(tar cf - . \
2016-09-25 09:17:45	eolien	               | pv -n -s $(du -sb . | awk '{print $1}') \

2016-09-25 09:17:49	eolien	              | dialog --gauge 'Progress' 7 70
2016-09-25 09:18:03	eolien	this example : it print "Progress" as comment
2016-09-25 09:18:09	eolien	but i want to pass ETA to this
2016-09-25 09:18:19	izalove	cool, it has an option for this
2016-09-25 09:18:28	eolien	nop, just for percentage
2016-09-25 09:18:36	eolien	i want ETA too
2016-09-25 09:19:02	izalove	eolien: i think you should read what the --gauge option does
2016-09-25 09:19:05	izalove	in man dialog
2016-09-25 09:19:14	izalove	and how you should format the input for it
2016-09-25 09:19:19	eolien	i know
2016-09-25 09:19:22	eolien	that's what i'm asking
2016-09-25 09:19:29	eolien	to format pv output to  match dialog input
2016-09-25 09:19:45	eolien	XXX\n$percentage\n$ETA\nXXX\n
2016-09-25 09:20:38	eolien	the problem is that pv formatting cant get only percentage to pass it ass i said
2016-09-25 09:20:57	eolien	-F "%p" : gives progress bar AND percentage
2016-09-25 09:20:57	izalove	you said that pv didn't print anything when redirected to a pipe

2016-09-25 09:57:13	eolien	it translate it to "set up"
2016-09-25 09:57:30	eolien	it works without eval
2016-09-25 09:57:34	geirha	yes, "set up"
2016-09-25 09:57:54	eolien	or setup ^^
2016-09-25 09:58:27	geirha	it "works" until you need to have something sligtly more complex than what you currently have
2016-09-25 09:58:35	eolien	ok
2016-09-25 09:58:45	eolien	just i dont understand a part
2016-09-25 09:59:05	eolien	$'%e\t%p\n'
2016-09-25 09:59:14	eolien	ETA first, then %p
2016-09-25 09:59:30	eolien	ah no ok i think i get
2016-09-25 09:59:35	eolien	in awk you pass $2
2016-09-25 09:59:44	eolien	which is parsed by -F " " by default
2016-09-25 09:59:57	eolien	i will search what is $NF
2016-09-25 10:00:27	geirha	I initially used -F '\t' with awk, hence the \t in the format, but then I realized I could use the default field separator
2016-09-25 10:00:37	geirha	so $'%e %p\n' will work the same
2016-09-25 10:00:49	eolien	i dont know what is \t
2016-09-25 10:00:53	eolien	i'm searching it

2016-09-25 10:03:18	geirha	anyway, having multiple arguments mashed into a single string, and then using an unquoted variable expansion, like $excludes, is brittle and will eventually bite you
2016-09-25 10:03:39	eolien	ok, i quote it
2016-09-25 10:03:46	geirha	quoting it won't help
2016-09-25 10:04:25	eolien	why is this a pb ?
2016-09-25 10:05:02	geirha	Bash can handle this case just fine, but since your config-file only provides it as a string, the data is already broken
2016-09-25 10:05:22	geirha	eolien: because it treats data as code

2016-09-25 10:06:25	geirha	right now, the data happens to not contain anything that triggers the shell to do something unwanted, but any change in the config file or filesystem may
2016-09-25 10:06:57	geirha	80% of the time it works all the time
2016-09-25 10:07:29	eolien	yep but this is a personnal tool, which is accessible by nobody
2016-09-25 10:07:44	geirha	Read http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/050 when you have the time. It should shed some light on the problem.
2016-09-25 10:07:45	eolien	it helps me to pass every excludes by conf file
2016-09-25 10:07:57	eolien	ok, cause i think i dont get it well thx
2016-09-25 10:08:12	eolien	i'm trying to add other var than ETA
2016-09-25 10:08:15	geirha	eolien: there are ways to pass those excludes in a way that will treat them as data all the way
2016-09-25 10:08:17	rods-tab3	from gawk doc:  Brian Kernighan added fflush() to his awk in April 1992. For two decades, it was
2016-09-25 10:08:18	rods-tab3	a common extension. In December 2012, it was accepted for inclusion into the
2016-09-25 10:08:18	rods-tab3	POSIX standard. See the Austin Group website
2016-09-25 10:08:36	geirha	but that requires changing the config format, or the config parser
2016-09-25 10:08:46	eolien	i can, without pb
2016-09-25 10:08:57	geirha	rods-tab3: Ah, so next POSIX will have it?
2016-09-25 10:09:22	eolien	pv -f -F $'%t %e %r %p\n' -s $(du $excludes -xsb / | awk '{print $1}') | $comp_tool > "$image_dir/$sda3_file") 2>&1 | gawk '{printf("XXX\n%d\nTime: %s Left: %s Rate: %s\nXXX\n", $NF, $4);fflush()}'
2016-09-25 10:09:28	geirha	Or did it already make it into the 2013 one?
2016-09-25 10:09:32	eolien	not working, i think the problem is from $NF
2016-09-25 10:10:30	geirha	the format string has four format specifiers, but you only provide 2 arguments
2016-09-25 10:10:30		[10:10]
2016-09-25 10:10:44	geirha	each format specifier (%d, %s, ...) should have a corresponding argument
2016-09-25 10:10:54	eolien	yep, but i dont understand how to add it in , $NF, $4
2016-09-25 10:11:20	geirha	you have to look at the pv output and figure out how to access each value
2016-09-25 10:11:25	eolien	i dont get how $NF work, it says in doc in fr, that it contains all current "data" (i dont know hwo to translate it)
2016-09-25 10:12:15	geirha	NF is the number of fields
2016-09-25 10:12:24	geirha	if the line has 5 fields, NF is 5
2016-09-25 10:12:28	geirha	so $NF == $5
2016-09-25 10:12:46	eolien	ah ok !
2016-09-25 10:12:48	eolien	thx
2016-09-25 10:13:03	geirha	and $(NF-1) would be $4 (second-last field)
2016-09-25 10:13:23	geirha	sometimes it is useful to count from the end

2016-09-25 10:15:05	eolien	but you're right

2016-09-25 10:17:24	geirha	mh, because there's a carriage return in $1, probably
2016-09-25 10:18:00	geirha	try with   gawk -F '[][ \r\t]+' '{printf...}'
2016-09-25 10:18:30	eolien	as fflush() is in awk
2016-09-25 10:18:37	eolien	i can awk instead of gawk ?
2016-09-25 10:18:39	geirha	though that will cause all fields to be shifted to the right, since the \r at the start of the line now become a field separator
2016-09-25 10:18:48	geirha	yes
2016-09-25 10:19:51	eolien	what is \r

2016-09-26 10:43:02	gnomon	I've written splice() so many times that it's kind of a reflex for me at this point.  Usually it also accepts a fourth optional parameter, which is the amount of the string to overwrite; I was going to demonstrate that generalization but tvw had already found a working solution so there was no need.
2016-09-26 10:43:55	gnomon	(Some of my reimplementations of splice() also include a fifth optional parameter to control what happens when the amount-of-string-to-overwrite ends up being shorter than the amount of space in the string, but that's almost never useful.)
2016-09-26 10:48:51	Riviera	I think it would be great if you were to publish a compilation of your awk library functions.

2016-09-26 21:42:10	izalove	[21:02:18] i was about to start learning a+ and make it my favourite language but then i saw those screenshots [21:02:18]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	gnomon	[21:02:36] heh [21:02:36]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	gnomon	[21:03:09] Yes, don't do that.  It is a lovely curiousity and an excellent tool _in some very limited problem domains_, and only in very specific organizational circumstances. [21:03:09]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	_val_	[21:06:47] Thank god I didn't have to see those print screens. [21:06:47]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	gnomon	[21:07:14] There is no print screen. [21:07:14]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	gnomon	[21:07:17] Er, uh, I meant [21:07:17]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	gnomon	[21:07:20] Print screen is dead. [21:07:20]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	_val_	[21:07:34] screenshot? [21:07:34]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	_val_	[21:07:57] Well My keyboard says "Print\nScreen\nSysRq [21:07:57]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	gnomon	[21:09:02] _val_, I was making a Nietzsche joke, sorry. [21:09:02]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	_val_	[21:09:49] gnomon: you are making it even harder. What the heck is a Nietzsche joke? Sounds German. But Germans and Humor? Come on :-p [21:09:49]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	 *	_val_ [21:09:52] hides [21:09:52]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	 *	gnomon [21:10:23] chuckles, in German [21:10:23]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	_val_	[21:12:03] Probably the one I know is already sleeping so I'm safe for now. [21:12:03]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	jcadduono	[23:12:26] oh great awk overlords, i have made an awkward looking awk script using my limited knowledge of awking, while it is fully functional and works as intended, i was wondering if you could bestow upon me your methods of improvement so that i may pass the knowledge down: [23:12:26]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	jcadduono	[23:12:28] https://paste.omnirom.org/view/raw/e8b610ac [23:12:28]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	jcadduono	[23:14:32] it pretty much just tries to insert the line "    disabled" immediately after a service entry and ignore any other disabled line until the next service or "on x" begins [23:14:32]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:16:08] rc is usually used for "return code" [23:16:08]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:16:55] Instead of one {action} with conds inside, you can do  'cond {action}   cond {action}   cond{action}' [23:16:55]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:17:42] Instead of trying to embed $1, use awk -vname="$1" and use  $2 == name [23:17:42]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:19:20] awk -vname="$1"    '!found && $1 == "service" && $2 == name {found=1; ...} [23:19:20]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:19:53] By cleverly arranging the order of those bits, you can usually avoid using 'next' anywhere and avoid duplicating the 'print $0' line [23:19:53]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	jcadduono	[23:25:41] err, this seems to work: https://paste.omnirom.org/view/raw/9350d32b -- not sure how to avoid using next though [23:25:41]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:26:14] Got a sample input file I can use? [23:26:14]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	jcadduono	[23:28:00] https://adduono.com/biohazardous-material/init.samsungexynos8890.rc [23:28:00]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	jcadduono	[23:30:07] heres the shell script im using just to test it: https://adduono.com/biohazardous-material/disable_service [23:30:07]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	jcadduono	[23:30:31] the entire function is meant to be implemented elsewhere [23:30:31]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:31:53] Holy cow. That's a large rc file [23:31:53]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:34:28] Your in_sc=0 line is ... outside of a {} [23:34:28]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:35:29] Can a service be nested? I'm not sure why you need to track in_sc [23:35:29]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:36:14] Oh. To avoid double-printing disabled [23:36:14]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	jcadduono	[23:36:35] current: https://paste.omnirom.org/view/raw/bd56ca3d [23:36:35]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:40:09] Try this: [23:40:09]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:40:09] $1 == "service" {in_sc = 0}         in_sc && $1 == "disabled" {next;}        1 {print}       $1 == "service" && $2 == sc_name { print "    disabled"; in_sc = 1 } [23:40:09]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	jcadduono	[23:44:33] err what's the 1 for in front of { print } [23:44:33]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:45:19] 1 == true [23:45:19]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:45:21] Always ran [23:45:21]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	jcadduono	[23:46:39] is it not always run without the 1 there [23:46:39]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	jcadduono	[23:46:59] seems to for me anyways [23:46:59]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:47:21] Yeah. "1" is the "default" cond when none specified [23:47:21]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	jcadduono	[23:49:17] this seems to be working :) https://paste.omnirom.org/view/raw/ecd3631a [23:49:17]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:50:01] There's some tweaks/optimizations you can do outside of awk [23:50:01]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:50:35] Like    grep -q || continue ; awk ... [23:50:35]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:51:13] Or iterating over the output of           grep -l "..." init.*.rc  (breaks on newlines in filenames) [23:51:13]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:52:07] Less optimizations, more tweaks [23:52:07]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	jcadduono	[23:52:20] saved me some indentation :p thanks [23:52:20]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:54:19] You could also use two spaces for indents inside of .... 8. Or even 4 [23:54:19]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	jcadduono	[23:55:16] it's actually tabs, i'm an anti-spacer [23:55:16]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:55:42] >.> [23:55:42]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	yitz	[23:55:52] You could pass it through `expand` before pasting it? [23:55:52]

2016-09-27 22:59:34	izalove	[21:02:18] i was about to start learning a+ and make it my favourite language but then i saw those screenshots [21:02:18]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	gnomon	[21:02:36] heh [21:02:36]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	gnomon	[21:03:09] Yes, don't do that.  It is a lovely curiousity and an excellent tool _in some very limited problem domains_, and only in very specific organizational circumstances. [21:03:09]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	_val_	[21:06:47] Thank god I didn't have to see those print screens. [21:06:47]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	gnomon	[21:07:14] There is no print screen. [21:07:14]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	gnomon	[21:07:17] Er, uh, I meant [21:07:17]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	gnomon	[21:07:20] Print screen is dead. [21:07:20]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	_val_	[21:07:34] screenshot? [21:07:34]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	_val_	[21:07:57] Well My keyboard says "Print\nScreen\nSysRq [21:07:57]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	gnomon	[21:09:02] _val_, I was making a Nietzsche joke, sorry. [21:09:02]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	_val_	[21:09:49] gnomon: you are making it even harder. What the heck is a Nietzsche joke? Sounds German. But Germans and Humor? Come on :-p [21:09:49]

2016-09-27 22:59:34	_val_	[21:12:03] Probably the one I know is already sleeping so I'm safe for now. [21:12:03]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	jcadduono	[23:12:26] oh great awk overlords, i have made an awkward looking awk script using my limited knowledge of awking, while it is fully functional and works as intended, i was wondering if you could bestow upon me your methods of improvement so that i may pass the knowledge down: [23:12:26]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	jcadduono	[23:12:28] https://paste.omnirom.org/view/raw/e8b610ac [23:12:28]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	jcadduono	[23:14:32] it pretty much just tries to insert the line "    disabled" immediately after a service entry and ignore any other disabled line until the next service or "on x" begins [23:14:32]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:16:08] rc is usually used for "return code" [23:16:08]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:16:55] Instead of one {action} with conds inside, you can do  'cond {action}   cond {action}   cond{action}' [23:16:55]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:17:42] Instead of trying to embed $1, use awk -vname="$1" and use  $2 == name [23:17:42]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:19:20] awk -vname="$1"    '!found && $1 == "service" && $2 == name {found=1; ...} [23:19:20]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:19:53] By cleverly arranging the order of those bits, you can usually avoid using 'next' anywhere and avoid duplicating the 'print $0' line [23:19:53]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	jcadduono	[23:25:41] err, this seems to work: https://paste.omnirom.org/view/raw/9350d32b -- not sure how to avoid using next though [23:25:41]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:26:14] Got a sample input file I can use? [23:26:14]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	jcadduono	[23:28:00] https://adduono.com/biohazardous-material/init.samsungexynos8890.rc [23:28:00]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	jcadduono	[23:30:07] heres the shell script im using just to test it: https://adduono.com/biohazardous-material/disable_service [23:30:07]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	jcadduono	[23:30:31] the entire function is meant to be implemented elsewhere [23:30:31]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:31:53] Holy cow. That's a large rc file [23:31:53]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:34:28] Your in_sc=0 line is ... outside of a {} [23:34:28]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:35:29] Can a service be nested? I'm not sure why you need to track in_sc [23:35:29]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:36:14] Oh. To avoid double-printing disabled [23:36:14]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	jcadduono	[23:36:35] current: https://paste.omnirom.org/view/raw/bd56ca3d [23:36:35]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:40:09] Try this: [23:40:09]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:40:09] $1 == "service" {in_sc = 0}         in_sc && $1 == "disabled" {next;}        1 {print}       $1 == "service" && $2 == sc_name { print "    disabled"; in_sc = 1 } [23:40:09]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	jcadduono	[23:44:33] err what's the 1 for in front of { print } [23:44:33]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:45:19] 1 == true [23:45:19]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:45:21] Always ran [23:45:21]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	jcadduono	[23:46:39] is it not always run without the 1 there [23:46:39]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	jcadduono	[23:46:59] seems to for me anyways [23:46:59]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:47:21] Yeah. "1" is the "default" cond when none specified [23:47:21]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	jcadduono	[23:49:17] this seems to be working :) https://paste.omnirom.org/view/raw/ecd3631a [23:49:17]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:50:01] There's some tweaks/optimizations you can do outside of awk [23:50:01]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:50:35] Like    grep -q || continue ; awk ... [23:50:35]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:51:13] Or iterating over the output of           grep -l "..." init.*.rc  (breaks on newlines in filenames) [23:51:13]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:52:07] Less optimizations, more tweaks [23:52:07]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	jcadduono	[23:52:20] saved me some indentation :p thanks [23:52:20]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:54:19] You could also use two spaces for indents inside of .... 8. Or even 4 [23:54:19]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	jcadduono	[23:55:16] it's actually tabs, i'm an anti-spacer [23:55:16]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:55:42] >.> [23:55:42]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	yitz	[23:55:52] You could pass it through `expand` before pasting it? [23:55:52]

2016-09-28 03:19:47	ghone_	Hi all,
2016-09-28 03:20:10	ghone_	I am trying to use awk's split function
2016-09-28 03:20:15	ghone_	in the following way:
2016-09-28 03:22:47	ghone_	awk '{split("var = [ value ]",arr,"[]"); print arr[2]}'
2016-09-28 03:23:05	ghone_	so basically to get and print the value between brackets
2016-09-28 03:23:10	ghone_	the above doesn't work
2016-09-28 03:23:28	ghone_	what should I use as regexp for '[' and ']'
2016-09-28 03:23:29	ghone_	?
2016-09-28 03:23:47	waldner	[][]
2016-09-28 03:24:18	c00kiemon5ter	[ and ] define character classes, they are special in regex context
2016-09-28 03:25:15	waldner	(you'll still get " value " though, with the spaces)
2016-09-28 03:25:48	ghone_	but when I try to run it as this:
2016-09-28 03:25:49	ghone_	awk '{split("var = [ value ]",arr,"[][]"); print arr[2]}'
2016-09-28 03:25:53	ghone_	it just hangs

2016-09-28 03:41:45	kappa1	hi
2016-09-28 03:43:10	kappa1	I want to create a csv file with columns a,b,c,d,e where columns c,d are contained in another csv file and column e is contained in another csv file (this file has less rows than the c,d csv file). How can I merge the csvs into one?
2016-09-28 03:44:52	xpt	kappa1: a and b columns are in both files ?
2016-09-28 03:45:14	kappa1	a and b are given in a variable
2016-09-28 03:45:36	kappa1	this works fine: awk -v OFS=, -v a="a,b,c" -v e_file=records-per-second-1475020740516.csv/7 '{getline e < e_file; print a,$0,e}' stats-memory-1475020738670.csv
2016-09-28 03:46:02	kappa1	however it repeats the last element of e column csv until the end of c,d column csv
2016-09-28 03:46:08	kappa1	and I want to replace with -1
2016-09-28 03:46:10	kappa1	is it possible?
2016-09-28 03:47:01	kappa1	I mean, the e_file is shorter than the other, and instead of repeating the last element, I want to write -1
2016-09-28 03:49:42	kappa1	xpt^
2016-09-28 03:49:51	xpt	 awk -v OFS=, -v a="a,b,c" -v e_file=records-per-second-1475020740516.csv/7 '{if(getline e < e_file) print a,$0,e; else print a,$0,"-1"}' stats-memory-1475020738670.csv
2016-09-28 03:49:54	xpt	not tested
2016-09-28 03:50:03	kappa1	thanks
2016-09-28 03:50:34	kappa1	wow it worked nicely
2016-09-28 03:50:36	kappa1	thanks a lot
2016-09-28 03:51:01	xpt	getline returns "0" (false) if it reaches end of file
2016-09-28 03:51:13	kappa1	oh cool
2016-09-28 03:52:08	kappa1	xpt, do you require that I give you credit in my work? I can put your name in the acknowledgments

2016-09-28 07:56:11	tag	gnomon, Except find is slow, I want to use locate :-D
2016-09-28 07:56:13	gnomon	tag, but yes, find(1) would definitely be slower than locate(1)
2016-09-28 07:56:15	gnomon	JINX

2016-09-28 07:58:05	tag	This is what happens when I spend way too much time thinking about a super trivial problem. I come up with an answer in awk.
2016-09-28 07:59:31	tag	of course, if I think about it long enough, I'll realize that there's some kind of escaping problem and then I'll find myself writing some quote function and then I'll fret about the purity of it and then I'll return to my original idea and write a program in C that let's me do what I was talking about — basically a combination of xargs and grep
2016-09-28 08:00:01	tag	but that program will never be part of the POSIX specification, so I'll never use it because I'm a sucker for antiquated portability standards.
2016-09-28 08:00:36	tag	stupid f'ing perfection.
2016-09-28 08:01:20	tag	doh, just use sprintf. — that solves for spaces.
2016-09-28 08:02:04	tag	locate -b '\.git' | xargs dirname | awk 'system(sprintf("git -C '$0' diff-index --quiet HEAD", $0))' ... but what happens if my directory has a ' in it?
2016-09-28 08:02:51	yitz	tag: Or a space or a newline?
2016-09-28 08:03:00	tag	space is covered

2016-09-28 08:03:02	tag	newline...uh
2016-09-28 08:03:05	tag	might not be
2016-09-28 08:03:29	yitz	xargs and awk both will handle those line by line -- newline delineated
2016-09-28 08:03:37	tag	Right
2016-09-28 08:03:44	tag	but what does locate do if there's a newline in the filename?
2016-09-28 08:03:46	tag	*that* is the question
2016-09-28 08:04:17	larryv	no, the question is can you get locate to not use newline as a delimiter
2016-09-28 08:04:31	yitz	Or just use 'find'
2016-09-28 08:04:49	larryv	maybe i'm giving locate too much credit though. maybe it prints newlines as "?" or something, i dunno
2016-09-28 08:05:00	larryv	i don't use it

2016-09-28 09:40:43	geirha	an index function is common in general purpose languages

2016-09-28 09:41:57	tsak	basically my question was about match function and RLENGTH variable
2016-09-28 09:42:56	geirha	right, match does regex matching rather than substring matching, and sets the variables RSTART and RLENGTH   to indicate which part of the string was matched by the regex

2016-09-29 00:46:12	gnomon	[18:38:56] tag, POSIX guarantees that filenames may not have newlines in them.  (It basically only says that about two characters, newline and path separator; in every other respect filenames are just byte bags.) [18:38:56]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	gnomon	[18:39:20] Yes, yes, [citation needed], gimme a sec. [18:39:20]

2016-09-29 00:46:12	gnomon	[18:44:06] Path separators and <NUL>, not newline.  Derp. [18:44:06]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	larryv	[19:02:56] NUL, NL, close enough? :P [19:02:56]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	tsak	[19:33:15] Hello everyone, I know what substring match is (from bash) but I can't understand how it works in awk [19:33:15]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	yitz	[19:35:16] substr(/pattern/, replace, var) [19:35:16]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	geirha	[19:35:49] yitz: heh, way to add confusion [19:35:49]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	geirha	[19:36:40] index(haystack, needle) [19:36:40]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	geirha	[19:37:12] that returns the first index where needle appears in haystack, or -1 if it is not a substring [19:37:12]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	geirha	[19:38:10] # awk '{ print index($0, "bar"); }' <<< foobar [19:38:10]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	shbot	[19:38:12] geirha: 4 [19:38:12]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	geirha	[19:38:27] err, s/-1/0/ [19:38:27]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	tsak	[19:39:42] I don't even know what index function does, started learning awk today xD [19:39:42]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	_val_	[19:40:02] hahaha [19:40:02]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	geirha	[19:40:05] index(s, t)    the position in s where the string t occurs, or  0  if  it  does not. [19:40:05]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	geirha	[19:40:13] ^ from the nawk manual [19:40:13]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	_val_	[19:40:15] uhm wrong window :) [19:40:15]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	geirha	[19:40:42] an index function is common in general purpose languages [19:40:42]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	tsak	[19:40:52] ok, I got it [19:40:52]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	tsak	[19:41:56] basically my question was about match function and RLENGTH variable [19:41:56]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	geirha	[19:42:56] right, match does regex matching rather than substring matching, and sets the variables RSTART and RLENGTH   to indicate which part of the string was matched by the regex [19:42:56]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	tsak	[19:42:56] this is what I'm looking into right now [19:42:56]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	tsak	[19:43:10] aha [19:43:10]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	tsak	[19:43:25] I've read about RLENGTH from a not-so-good tutorial [19:43:25]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	tsak	[19:43:42] no idea about RSTART lol [19:43:42]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	geirha	[19:44:27] # awk 'BEGIN{match("abcdefgh", /b.*f/); print RSTART, RLENGTH}' [19:44:27]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	shbot	[19:44:27] geirha: 2 5 [19:44:27]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	geirha	[19:45:12] it found a match starting at index 2, and the match is 5 characters long [19:45:12]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	_val_	[19:46:16] that is misleading [19:46:16]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	_val_	[19:46:28] i'd read b as index 1 :/ [19:46:28]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	tsak	[19:47:06] nice geirha, thanks [19:47:06]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	geirha	[19:47:27] yeah, awk starts counting at 1 instead of 0 [19:47:27]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	tsak	[19:47:45] I tried something like this [19:47:45]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	tsak	[19:48:15] # awk 'BEGIN { match("one", "o"); print "RLENGTH}' [19:48:15]

2016-09-29 00:46:12	shbot	[19:48:18] tsak: etc... ( http://ix.io/1riJ ) [19:48:18]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	tsak	[19:48:28] # awk 'BEGIN { match("one", "o"); print RLENGTH}' [19:48:28]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	shbot	[19:48:29] tsak: 1 [19:48:29]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	tsak	[19:49:06] well, I've changed the second string and I couldn't understand what was going on [19:49:06]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	tsak	[19:49:27] now I can understand it, thanks :0 [19:49:27]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	geirha	[19:50:53] # awk 'BEGIN{s = "abcdefgh"; match(s, /b.*f/); print substr(s, RSTART, RLENGTH)}' [19:50:53]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	shbot	[19:50:55] geirha: bcdef [19:50:55]

2016-09-29 11:50:43	Riviera	Not easily, you would have to write a CSV parser, for which awk does not bring many benefits.
2016-09-29 11:50:59	Riviera	Use a more appropriate language or tool; for example Python with its csv module.

2016-09-30 00:48:23	Riviera	[21:50:43] Not easily, you would have to write a CSV parser, for which awk does not bring many benefits. [21:50:43]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	Riviera	[21:50:58] Use a more appropriate language or tool; for example Python with its csv module. [21:50:58]

2016-09-30 05:28:07	gnomon	tsakos, NR and FNR differ if you are passing in multiple input files to awk.
2016-09-30 05:28:44	tsakos	yeah, but NR works with multiple files too, no?
2016-09-30 05:28:52	gnomon	tsakos, compare awk '{print NR, FNR}' <(printf '%s\n' {1..5}) vs awk '{print NR, FNR}' <(printf '%s\n' {1..5}) <(printf '%s\n' {5..10})
2016-09-30 05:29:31	gnomon	tsakos, sure, but NR will only ever increase, whereas FNR resets to 1 at each new file.
2016-09-30 05:29:44	tsakos	ah, yeah
2016-09-30 05:29:49	tsakos	that is a problem

2016-09-30 08:32:06	Camusensei	that's why I am asking

2016-09-30 08:32:39	Camusensei	mute: and how do I tell awk to treat it as the input?
2016-09-30 08:34:29	emg	Camusensei: argc++; argv[argc] = argv[argc-1];
2016-09-30 08:34:33	mute	i just mean to use it as a variable.

2016-09-30 08:35:21	mute	:)

2016-09-30 08:37:36	Camusensei	mute, the variable is containig thousands of lines. the variable is my input

2016-09-30 08:39:23	emg	so yeah, like C I guess it's UB
2016-09-30 08:40:04	Camusensei	what is !* ?
2016-09-30 08:40:34	Camusensei	must be "all but first" I guess

2016-09-30 08:41:00	emg	all arguments
2016-09-30 08:41:16	mute	whats the reason for passing twice? to get size?
2016-09-30 08:42:10	Camusensei	no, I'm building an index on the data inside and then reparsing it, wait, let me find out exactly what it was...
2016-09-30 08:42:10		[08:42]
2016-09-30 08:45:25	Camusensei	yep, input is iptables rules dump, containing both logging rules and non-logging rules and I am extracting all logging rules first into an array to then do some checks on the non-logging rules (namely is there a logging rule for every non-logging rule? is the logging rule correctly placed before the rule it matches?)
2016-09-30 08:47:21	mute	if you're putting them all in array anyway, sounds like you can just iterate that
2016-09-30 08:48:05	Camusensei	I'm only putting the logging rules in an arry. Here is the code in case you're curious about this: http://sprunge.us/UEJR
2016-09-30 08:49:32	mute	you could do: sudo iptables -S | awk '/LOG/ { ... logs[$0]++; next; } { not_logs[$0]++; } END { check logs to not_logs }'
2016-09-30 08:49:40	Camusensei	but yeah it's true that I could also use another array for the other rules instead of re-reading the files

2016-09-30 20:58:20	tsakos	hey, can someone give me a link or something that explains the awk syntax structure
2016-09-30 20:58:20		[20:58]
2016-09-30 20:58:50	tsakos	I'm a bit confused, with the commas, semicolons and all that
2016-09-30 20:59:01	izalove	it's just    condition { action }
2016-09-30 20:59:22	izalove	i don't think semicolons appear anywhere as syntax in awk...?
2016-09-30 20:59:42	tsakos	after variable declarations appear
2016-09-30 20:59:48	izalove	what
2016-09-30 21:00:02	tsakos	awk 'BEGIN { a = 10; b =11; if (a == b) print "a equal to b" }'
2016-09-30 21:00:06	tsakos	that one works
2016-09-30 21:00:09	izalove	oh sorry my bad
2016-09-30 21:00:11	izalove	semicolon
2016-09-30 21:00:14	izalove	not colon
2016-09-30 21:00:15	tsakos	yeah
2016-09-30 21:00:32	izalove	what do you find confusing in that line?
2016-09-30 21:00:49	tsakos	I don't know, sometimes I see semicolons, sometimes not
2016-09-30 21:00:57	tsakos	where it is needed and where not
2016-09-30 21:01:06	izalove	they're not needed at the end of a line
2016-09-30 21:01:15	tsakos	I've run some commands without any errors, but without output either lol
2016-09-30 21:01:33	tsakos	quoting also is a bit confusing
2016-09-30 21:02:33	tsakos	I've tried some commands with semicolon on the first statements
2016-09-30 21:02:39	tsakos	and it showed error
2016-09-30 21:02:42	nal	is it a statement? it needs a ; to separate statements
2016-09-30 21:02:54	nal	oh dear, i was looking at the backlog
2016-09-30 21:02:57	nal	woops
2016-09-30 21:03:54	tsakos	hm, trying to find a doc/tutorial something to understand it better
2016-09-30 21:04:21	tsakos	also the only way as I see to run something in awk without any file being processed is including the statements in BEGIN block
2016-09-30 21:04:24	tsakos	right?
2016-09-30 21:04:36	izalove	right
2016-09-30 21:04:46	tsakos	good :)
2016-09-30 21:05:05	nal	i was making an interactive tutorial but i forgot about it

2016-09-30 21:05:49	tsakos	interactive tutorial? video or website?
2016-09-30 21:05:49	nal	yeah, yeah, maybe some other day
2016-09-30 21:06:53	nal	all in the shell, write awk to get desired output
2016-09-30 21:07:35	tsakos	heh, that would be cool
2016-09-30 21:08:23	izalove	awk 'BEGIN { system("perl ...") }'
2016-09-30 21:08:28	tsakos	I can help you with it if you do it in bash
2016-09-30 21:08:41	tsakos	lol izalove
2016-09-30 21:09:05	tsakos	system function eh? amazing stuff :D
2016-09-30 21:11:05	tsakos	yeah, interactive tutorial would be really nice, you can test the results of commands given by the user easily with awk

2016-10-01 02:01:56	tsakos_	basically I don't know when quotes are needed
2016-10-01 02:02:28	ttmrichter	print by itself prints $0, terminating with whatever ORS is (defaults to LF or CR+LF).
2016-10-01 02:02:41	tsakos_	aha
2016-10-01 02:03:10	ttmrichter	print with a list of expressions prints out each expression sequentially, putting OFS (defaults to space) between each one and terminating with ORS (defaults, again, to LF or CR+LF).
2016-10-01 02:04:18	tsakos_	cool, this is a nice explanation
2016-10-01 02:04:22	tsakos_	thank you
2016-10-01 02:04:33	ttmrichter	Try this in your shell: awk 'BEGIN { print 1,2,3,4,5 }'
2016-10-01 02:04:47	tsakos_	it will print the numbers
2016-10-01 02:05:15	tsakos_	cool stuff
2016-10-01 02:05:58	tsakos_	Well, at the beginning, 2 days ago, I was trying something with print and it printed everything without spaces
2016-10-01 02:06:31	tsakos_	maybe the comma was missing or something, I don't know

2016-10-01 02:09:06	tsakos_	also tested with comma
2016-10-01 02:09:16	ttmrichter	The comma makes it a list of expressions.
2016-10-01 02:09:22	ttmrichter	Without the comma it's a single expression, so no OFS.
2016-10-01 02:09:33	tsakos_	hm, I don't remember what I've done, but everything is clear now

2016-10-01 03:18:30	apus	hi, can awk somehow compare dates like 2016-09-17-1508-02 < 2016-10-01-1508-00 ? what is the most efficient way to do something like that with awk or would another program/language be better?
2016-10-01 03:21:15	izalove	apus: sure it can, what's the problem?
2016-10-01 03:24:24	apus	i'm not that familiar with awk so i don't know atm how to solve that. any keywords i could search for that would lead me to the "best" solution?
2016-10-01 03:24:33	apus	does it expect a certain pattern for simple < comparison?
2016-10-01 03:26:43	izalove	literally just use a < b and awk will do compare your dates correctly
2016-10-01 03:26:43		[03:26]
2016-10-01 03:27:13	apus	so YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-SS is correctly recognized?
2016-10-01 03:27:27	izalove	it's recognized as a string
2016-10-01 03:27:53	izalove	and that format is meant to be sorted as strings

2016-10-03 05:19:35	xpt	[21:39:55] I am using my phone now, it would be too hard to use nonASCII characters. [21:39:55]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	xpt	[21:40:32] I can change that when I'm at commutes [21:40:32]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	rods-tab3	[21:41:34] or better, add a " fact [21:41:34]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	tsakos	[22:40:49] is it possible to open a pipeline inside BEGIN, END or the main code block of awk? [22:40:49]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	tsakos	[22:41:05] I see this [22:41:05]

2016-10-03 05:19:35	izalove	[22:47:18] i have an important question [22:47:18]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	izalove	[22:47:26] why is it called hawkbot and not awkbot? [22:47:26]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	tsakos	[22:48:36] it was part of the question Riviera [22:48:36]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	tsakos	[22:49:11] If this line I read is possible, then | must be a special character [22:49:11]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	tsakos	[22:50:14] well, one bracket is missing, but I didn't paste all the code, just that part [22:50:14]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	tsakos	[22:52:19] hmm, it works xD [22:52:19]

2016-10-03 17:13:45	nal1	there is one, but it doesnt seem complete
2016-10-03 17:14:04	ryouma	let's just go awk to c, c to rust, rust to java, java to perl, perl to c++, then c++ to python

2016-10-04 07:35:39	izalove	are you writing an awk script or is this in your shell?

2016-10-04 07:37:06	tsk	hmmm, what's wrong with it.. :/
2016-10-04 07:37:12	tsk	awk is quoted

2016-10-04 07:37:46	tsk	        for (i=1; i <= length($0); i++) {

2016-10-04 07:38:38	tsk	funny that the script checks for the same problem xd
2016-10-04 07:38:55	izalove	so you're not writing an awk script
2016-10-04 07:39:05	izalove	you're writing a shell script that calls awk
2016-10-04 07:39:11	tsk	ah, yeah, that
2016-10-04 07:39:14	izalove	ok
2016-10-04 07:39:22	izalove	then this is the easiest way

2016-10-05 13:08:40	lgc	Perhaps it is because the space is a visible character, after all.

2016-10-06 00:03:15	Vonor|Work	I need one part out of an html file. the line in question does a meta-refresh -> <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL=https://newurl" />  I only need the URL. so far I got "awk '/refresh/ {print $3}'". I wonder if it's possible to get the final result in one awk or whether i need to pipe it to another awk or sed or something.

2016-10-06 02:46:02	wrksx	I'm completly lost here, trying to use sub and not getting any success. my input contains lines like this:
2016-10-06 02:46:03	wrksx	5ff49d223902793a7badc892441f1a8ba2eab7cf        refs/tags/v0.0.1

2016-10-06 02:46:34	wrksx	refs/tags/v0.0.1
2016-10-06 02:46:52	wrksx	now I would like to get rid of that prefix 'refs/tags/'
2016-10-06 02:47:15	wrksx	I tried {print sub("refs/tags/","",$2)}
2016-10-06 02:47:56	go|dfish	wrksx: sub(/refs\/tags\//, "", $2)
2016-10-06 02:48:07	go|dfish	or /.*\// if you wish
2016-10-06 02:48:27	geirha	or just have git format it the way you want in the first place
2016-10-06 02:49:12	wrksx	geira, lol was my original goal but I couldn't find how to do that
2016-10-06 02:50:45	wrksx	go|dfish, tried sub(/refs\/tags\//, "", $2) but it return 1 on each line
2016-10-06 02:51:13	wrksx	awk '{print sub(/refs\/tags\//, "", $2)}'
2016-10-06 02:51:45	go|dfish	you'd need to print after sub, not print the return value of sub as sub doesn't return the string
2016-10-06 02:52:04	go|dfish	but it sounds as if changing the git format is the way to go
2016-10-06 02:52:55	wrksx	go|dfish, right asking right now in #git because could figure it out. Thx for the explanation though

2016-10-07 14:26:31	nal	the why this was a design decision idk. i can theorize that awk being a data reporting language, it should act more like an accumulator of data, so once you get what you want, you goto END and well... report.
2016-10-07 14:31:00	lgc	It's easier than C, nal, and it does reasonably well. The files I'm reading so far are not awfully big.
2016-10-07 14:32:28	nal	everything is easier than C though
2016-10-07 14:32:39	lgc	Indeed.
2016-10-07 14:32:51	nal	except, maybe, esoteric languages
2016-10-07 14:33:40	lgc	Oh, well... except from file I/O and such things, AWK is very much like C.
2016-10-07 14:33:59	lgc	And, of course, no declaration of variables.
2016-10-07 14:34:05	JacobsLadd3r	Anyone happen to know any tricks to speed up awk on a large file? I already use (LC_ALL=C) to set the locale to ASCII instead of UTF-8 and that improves performance greatly, but wandering if there was anything else I should look at.

2016-10-07 14:35:44	lgc	You mean in AWK?

2016-10-07 14:36:12	nal	and global always messes things up

2016-10-07 14:36:45	lgc	Oh, yes, that is something I don't like much about AWK's global-by-default values.
2016-10-07 14:36:57	nal	JacobsLadd3r: use perl
2016-10-07 14:36:58	lgc	It's kind of sloppy.
2016-10-07 14:37:23	nal	JacobsLadd3r: or use sed, if its still too slow use C

2016-10-07 15:26:38	JacobsLadd3r	[00:52:27] So this is what I'm trying to speed up, looking across all logs files on a web-server at once, and in many cases this totals over GBs and GBs of data. I have awk looking just for today's date, so if there would be a faster way to not read from the start of files until getting to today's date that is the next place I can think of for speed improvements, but not sure if that's doable in any way.

2016-10-07 21:33:45	lgc	[00:33:59] And, of course, no declaration of variables. [00:33:59]
2016-10-07 21:33:45	JacobsLadd3r	[00:34:05] Anyone happen to know any tricks to speed up awk on a large file? I already use (LC_ALL=C) to set the locale to ASCII instead of UTF-8 and that improves performance greatly, but wandering if there was anything else I should look at. [00:34:05]
2016-10-07 21:33:45	nal	[00:35:17] lgc: well, local variables must be declared if you want them [00:35:17]
2016-10-07 21:33:45	lgc	[00:35:44] You mean in AWK? [00:35:44]
2016-10-07 21:33:45	nal	[00:35:49] yeah [00:35:49]
2016-10-07 21:33:45	nal	[00:35:58] or else its global [00:35:58]
2016-10-07 21:33:45	nal	[00:36:11] and global always messes things up [00:36:11]

2016-10-07 21:33:45	lgc	[00:36:45] Oh, yes, that is something I don't like much about AWK's global-by-default values. [00:36:45]
2016-10-07 21:33:45	nal	[00:36:57] JacobsLadd3r: use perl [00:36:57]
2016-10-07 21:33:45	lgc	[00:36:58] It's kind of sloppy. [00:36:58]
2016-10-07 21:33:45	nal	[00:37:23] JacobsLadd3r: or use sed, if its still too slow use C [00:37:23]
2016-10-07 21:33:45	nal	[00:37:32] or use mawk [00:37:32]
2016-10-07 21:33:45	nal	[00:38:21] lgc: its good for one liners but not good for... anything else [00:38:21]
2016-10-07 21:33:45	nal	[00:39:48] JacobsLadd3r: this is of course, if you cant make the code any faster, then switch interpreter/languages [00:39:48]
2016-10-07 21:33:45	nal	[00:40:09] hopefully someone else will answer [00:40:09]
2016-10-07 21:33:45	lgc	[00:40:22] Not in my experience, nal. :) . It can do much more than that. [00:40:22]

2016-10-07 21:33:45	rods-tab3	[00:41:47] try mawk - its sometimes much fasster [00:41:47]
2016-10-07 21:33:45	JacobsLadd3r	[00:41:53] If you attempt to awk search over a 5GB file it's going to take quite a while. Forcing ASCII instead of UTF-8 can give you an over 1000% performance increase. So I was just curious if there were any other Linux tricks that might help in general just speed up awk. [00:41:53]
2016-10-07 21:33:45	JacobsLadd3r	[00:42:04] Ahh that's true I forgot about mawk, thanks! [00:42:04]

2016-10-07 21:33:45	JacobsLadd3r	[00:52:27] So this is what I'm trying to speed up, looking across all logs files on a web-server at once, and in many cases this totals over GBs and GBs of data. I have awk looking just for today's date, so if there would be a faster way to not read from the start of files until getting to today's date that is the next place I can think of for speed improvements, but not sure if that's doable in any way.

2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:09:24] so an if (vecinos) exit should do [00:09:24]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:10:05] (that inside the END) [00:10:05]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:10:46] its a good idea, handy for some code, tedious for other types [00:10:46]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	lgc	[00:11:17] Oh, I finally got, it, nal. Thanks. :) . [00:11:17]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:19:54] this is great though, more sloc than i've ever written for awk, good luck :) [00:19:54]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:22:39] (actually you even put the exit on ayuda(), so you kinda knew [00:22:39]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:26:31] the why this was a design decision idk. i can theorize that awk being a data reporting language, it should act more like an accumulator of data, so once you get what you want, you goto END and well... report. [00:26:31]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	lgc	[00:31:00] It's easier than C, nal, and it does reasonably well. The files I'm reading so far are not awfully big. [00:31:00]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:32:28] everything is easier than C though [00:32:28]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	lgc	[00:32:39] Indeed. [00:32:39]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:32:51] except, maybe, esoteric languages [00:32:51]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	lgc	[00:33:40] Oh, well... except from file I/O and such things, AWK is very much like C. [00:33:40]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	lgc	[00:33:59] And, of course, no declaration of variables. [00:33:59]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	JacobsLadd3r	[00:34:05] Anyone happen to know any tricks to speed up awk on a large file? I already use (LC_ALL=C) to set the locale to ASCII instead of UTF-8 and that improves performance greatly, but wandering if there was anything else I should look at. [00:34:05]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:35:17] lgc: well, local variables must be declared if you want them [00:35:17]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	lgc	[00:35:44] You mean in AWK? [00:35:44]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:35:49] yeah [00:35:49]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:35:58] or else its global [00:35:58]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:36:11] and global always messes things up [00:36:11]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:36:31] try doing a for loop within a for loop [00:36:31]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	lgc	[00:36:45] Oh, yes, that is something I don't like much about AWK's global-by-default values. [00:36:45]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:36:57] JacobsLadd3r: use perl [00:36:57]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	lgc	[00:36:58] It's kind of sloppy. [00:36:58]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:37:23] JacobsLadd3r: or use sed, if its still too slow use C [00:37:23]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:37:32] or use mawk [00:37:32]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:38:21] lgc: its good for one liners but not good for... anything else [00:38:21]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:39:48] JacobsLadd3r: this is of course, if you cant make the code any faster, then switch interpreter/languages [00:39:48]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:40:09] hopefully someone else will answer [00:40:09]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	lgc	[00:40:22] Not in my experience, nal. :) . It can do much more than that. [00:40:22]

2016-10-08 11:37:43	jamesd	[00:40:37] get a faster computer..   i haven't found awk slow at anything in the last decade... not even this century awk was slow back in the 90's when i didn't own a floating point processor... [00:40:37]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	rods-tab3	[00:41:47] try mawk - its sometimes much fasster [00:41:47]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	JacobsLadd3r	[00:41:53] If you attempt to awk search over a 5GB file it's going to take quite a while. Forcing ASCII instead of UTF-8 can give you an over 1000% performance increase. So I was just curious if there were any other Linux tricks that might help in general just speed up awk. [00:41:53]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	JacobsLadd3r	[00:42:04] Ahh that's true I forgot about mawk, thanks! [00:42:04]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:42:15] oh gosh, why are you even... [00:42:15]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	rods-tab3	[00:44:59] xpt: hawkbot down ? [00:44:59]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:47:28] i always see that question asked in stack overflow, by that point, isnt it better to convert the file into sql or something like that? [00:47:28]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	JacobsLadd3r	[00:52:27] So this is what I'm trying to speed up, looking across all logs files on a web-server at once, and in many cases this totals over GBs and GBs of data. I have awk looking just for today's date, so if there would be a faster way to not read from the start of files until getting to today's date that is the next place I can think of for speed improvements, but not sure if that's doable in any way.

2016-10-08 11:37:43	nal	[00:56:37] gnu grep is faster for searching [00:56:37]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	JacobsLadd3r	[00:58:05] Yeah, if you Google "Speed up grep" I wrote an article about that, that's where I got the LC_ALL=C trick to use with awk. I was just curious if I was missing out on any other speed boosts I could use directly with awk instead of having to grep first. [00:58:05]

2016-10-09 00:27:18	nal	[00:09:24] so an if (vecinos) exit should do [00:09:24]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	nal	[00:10:05] (that inside the END) [00:10:05]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	nal	[00:10:46] its a good idea, handy for some code, tedious for other types [00:10:46]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	lgc	[00:11:17] Oh, I finally got, it, nal. Thanks. :) . [00:11:17]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	nal	[00:19:54] this is great though, more sloc than i've ever written for awk, good luck :) [00:19:54]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	nal	[00:22:39] (actually you even put the exit on ayuda(), so you kinda knew [00:22:39]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	nal	[00:26:31] the why this was a design decision idk. i can theorize that awk being a data reporting language, it should act more like an accumulator of data, so once you get what you want, you goto END and well... report. [00:26:31]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	lgc	[00:31:00] It's easier than C, nal, and it does reasonably well. The files I'm reading so far are not awfully big. [00:31:00]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	nal	[00:32:28] everything is easier than C though [00:32:28]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	lgc	[00:32:39] Indeed. [00:32:39]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	nal	[00:32:51] except, maybe, esoteric languages [00:32:51]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	lgc	[00:33:40] Oh, well... except from file I/O and such things, AWK is very much like C. [00:33:40]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	lgc	[00:33:59] And, of course, no declaration of variables. [00:33:59]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	JacobsLadd3r	[00:34:05] Anyone happen to know any tricks to speed up awk on a large file? I already use (LC_ALL=C) to set the locale to ASCII instead of UTF-8 and that improves performance greatly, but wandering if there was anything else I should look at. [00:34:05]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	nal	[00:35:17] lgc: well, local variables must be declared if you want them [00:35:17]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	lgc	[00:35:44] You mean in AWK? [00:35:44]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	nal	[00:35:49] yeah [00:35:49]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	nal	[00:35:58] or else its global [00:35:58]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	nal	[00:36:11] and global always messes things up [00:36:11]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	nal	[00:36:31] try doing a for loop within a for loop [00:36:31]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	lgc	[00:36:45] Oh, yes, that is something I don't like much about AWK's global-by-default values. [00:36:45]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	nal	[00:36:57] JacobsLadd3r: use perl [00:36:57]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	lgc	[00:36:58] It's kind of sloppy. [00:36:58]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	nal	[00:37:23] JacobsLadd3r: or use sed, if its still too slow use C [00:37:23]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	nal	[00:37:32] or use mawk [00:37:32]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	nal	[00:38:21] lgc: its good for one liners but not good for... anything else [00:38:21]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	nal	[00:39:48] JacobsLadd3r: this is of course, if you cant make the code any faster, then switch interpreter/languages [00:39:48]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	nal	[00:40:09] hopefully someone else will answer [00:40:09]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	lgc	[00:40:22] Not in my experience, nal. :) . It can do much more than that. [00:40:22]

2016-10-09 00:27:18	jamesd	[00:40:37] get a faster computer..   i haven't found awk slow at anything in the last decade... not even this century awk was slow back in the 90's when i didn't own a floating point processor... [00:40:37]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	rods-tab3	[00:41:47] try mawk - its sometimes much fasster [00:41:47]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	JacobsLadd3r	[00:41:53] If you attempt to awk search over a 5GB file it's going to take quite a while. Forcing ASCII instead of UTF-8 can give you an over 1000% performance increase. So I was just curious if there were any other Linux tricks that might help in general just speed up awk. [00:41:53]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	JacobsLadd3r	[00:42:04] Ahh that's true I forgot about mawk, thanks! [00:42:04]

2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:09:24] so an if (vecinos) exit should do [00:09:24]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:10:05] (that inside the END) [00:10:05]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:10:46] its a good idea, handy for some code, tedious for other types [00:10:46]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	lgc	[00:11:17] Oh, I finally got, it, nal. Thanks. :) . [00:11:17]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:19:54] this is great though, more sloc than i've ever written for awk, good luck :) [00:19:54]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:22:39] (actually you even put the exit on ayuda(), so you kinda knew [00:22:39]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:26:31] the why this was a design decision idk. i can theorize that awk being a data reporting language, it should act more like an accumulator of data, so once you get what you want, you goto END and well... report. [00:26:31]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	lgc	[00:31:00] It's easier than C, nal, and it does reasonably well. The files I'm reading so far are not awfully big. [00:31:00]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:32:28] everything is easier than C though [00:32:28]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	lgc	[00:32:39] Indeed. [00:32:39]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:32:51] except, maybe, esoteric languages [00:32:51]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	lgc	[00:33:40] Oh, well... except from file I/O and such things, AWK is very much like C. [00:33:40]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	lgc	[00:33:59] And, of course, no declaration of variables. [00:33:59]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	JacobsLadd3r	[00:34:05] Anyone happen to know any tricks to speed up awk on a large file? I already use (LC_ALL=C) to set the locale to ASCII instead of UTF-8 and that improves performance greatly, but wandering if there was anything else I should look at. [00:34:05]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:35:17] lgc: well, local variables must be declared if you want them [00:35:17]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	lgc	[00:35:44] You mean in AWK? [00:35:44]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:35:49] yeah [00:35:49]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:35:58] or else its global [00:35:58]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:36:11] and global always messes things up [00:36:11]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:36:31] try doing a for loop within a for loop [00:36:31]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	lgc	[00:36:45] Oh, yes, that is something I don't like much about AWK's global-by-default values. [00:36:45]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:36:57] JacobsLadd3r: use perl [00:36:57]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	lgc	[00:36:58] It's kind of sloppy. [00:36:58]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:37:23] JacobsLadd3r: or use sed, if its still too slow use C [00:37:23]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:37:32] or use mawk [00:37:32]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:38:21] lgc: its good for one liners but not good for... anything else [00:38:21]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:39:48] JacobsLadd3r: this is of course, if you cant make the code any faster, then switch interpreter/languages [00:39:48]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:40:09] hopefully someone else will answer [00:40:09]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	lgc	[00:40:22] Not in my experience, nal. :) . It can do much more than that. [00:40:22]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	rods-tab3	[00:40:25] !paddlin [00:40:25]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	jamesd	[00:40:37] get a faster computer..   i haven't found awk slow at anything in the last decade... not even this century awk was slow back in the 90's when i didn't own a floating point processor... [00:40:37]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	rods-tab3	[00:41:47] try mawk - its sometimes much fasster [00:41:47]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	JacobsLadd3r	[00:41:53] If you attempt to awk search over a 5GB file it's going to take quite a while. Forcing ASCII instead of UTF-8 can give you an over 1000% performance increase. So I was just curious if there were any other Linux tricks that might help in general just speed up awk. [00:41:53]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	JacobsLadd3r	[00:42:04] Ahh that's true I forgot about mawk, thanks! [00:42:04]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:42:15] oh gosh, why are you even... [00:42:15]

2016-10-09 02:08:36	nal	[00:47:28] i always see that question asked in stack overflow, by that point, isnt it better to convert the file into sql or something like that? [00:47:28]
2016-10-09 02:08:36	JacobsLadd3r	[00:52:27] So this is what I'm trying to speed up, looking across all logs files on a web-server at once, and in many cases this totals over GBs and GBs of data. I have awk looking just for today's date, so if there would be a faster way to not read from the start of files until getting to today's date that is the next place I can think of for speed improvements, but not sure if that's doable in any way.

2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:09:24] so an if (vecinos) exit should do [00:09:24]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:10:05] (that inside the END) [00:10:05]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:10:46] its a good idea, handy for some code, tedious for other types [00:10:46]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	lgc	[00:11:17] Oh, I finally got, it, nal. Thanks. :) . [00:11:17]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:19:54] this is great though, more sloc than i've ever written for awk, good luck :) [00:19:54]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:22:39] (actually you even put the exit on ayuda(), so you kinda knew [00:22:39]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:26:31] the why this was a design decision idk. i can theorize that awk being a data reporting language, it should act more like an accumulator of data, so once you get what you want, you goto END and well... report. [00:26:31]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	lgc	[00:31:00] It's easier than C, nal, and it does reasonably well. The files I'm reading so far are not awfully big. [00:31:00]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:32:28] everything is easier than C though [00:32:28]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	lgc	[00:32:39] Indeed. [00:32:39]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:32:51] except, maybe, esoteric languages [00:32:51]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	lgc	[00:33:40] Oh, well... except from file I/O and such things, AWK is very much like C. [00:33:40]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	lgc	[00:33:59] And, of course, no declaration of variables. [00:33:59]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	JacobsLadd3r	[00:34:05] Anyone happen to know any tricks to speed up awk on a large file? I already use (LC_ALL=C) to set the locale to ASCII instead of UTF-8 and that improves performance greatly, but wandering if there was anything else I should look at. [00:34:05]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:35:17] lgc: well, local variables must be declared if you want them [00:35:17]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	lgc	[00:35:44] You mean in AWK? [00:35:44]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:35:49] yeah [00:35:49]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:35:58] or else its global [00:35:58]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:36:11] and global always messes things up [00:36:11]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:36:31] try doing a for loop within a for loop [00:36:31]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	lgc	[00:36:45] Oh, yes, that is something I don't like much about AWK's global-by-default values. [00:36:45]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:36:57] JacobsLadd3r: use perl [00:36:57]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	lgc	[00:36:58] It's kind of sloppy. [00:36:58]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:37:23] JacobsLadd3r: or use sed, if its still too slow use C [00:37:23]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:37:32] or use mawk [00:37:32]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:38:21] lgc: its good for one liners but not good for... anything else [00:38:21]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:39:48] JacobsLadd3r: this is of course, if you cant make the code any faster, then switch interpreter/languages [00:39:48]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:40:09] hopefully someone else will answer [00:40:09]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	lgc	[00:40:22] Not in my experience, nal. :) . It can do much more than that. [00:40:22]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	rods-tab3	[00:40:25] !paddlin [00:40:25]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	jamesd	[00:40:37] get a faster computer..   i haven't found awk slow at anything in the last decade... not even this century awk was slow back in the 90's when i didn't own a floating point processor... [00:40:37]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	rods-tab3	[00:41:47] try mawk - its sometimes much fasster [00:41:47]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	JacobsLadd3r	[00:41:53] If you attempt to awk search over a 5GB file it's going to take quite a while. Forcing ASCII instead of UTF-8 can give you an over 1000% performance increase. So I was just curious if there were any other Linux tricks that might help in general just speed up awk. [00:41:53]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	JacobsLadd3r	[00:42:04] Ahh that's true I forgot about mawk, thanks! [00:42:04]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:42:15] oh gosh, why are you even... [00:42:15]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	rods-tab3	[00:44:59] xpt: hawkbot down ? [00:44:59]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:47:28] i always see that question asked in stack overflow, by that point, isnt it better to convert the file into sql or something like that? [00:47:28]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	JacobsLadd3r	[00:52:27] So this is what I'm trying to speed up, looking across all logs files on a web-server at once, and in many cases this totals over GBs and GBs of data. I have awk looking just for today's date, so if there would be a faster way to not read from the start of files until getting to today's date that is the next place I can think of for speed improvements, but not sure if that's doable in any way. [00:52:27]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	JacobsLadd3r	[00:52:27] http://pastebin.com/2AHCSFVK [00:52:27]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	nal	[00:56:37] gnu grep is faster for searching [00:56:37]
2016-10-09 17:39:18	JacobsLadd3r	[00:58:05] Yeah, if you Google "Speed up grep" I wrote an article about that, that's where I got the LC_ALL=C trick to use with awk. I was just curious if I was missing out on any other speed boosts I could use directly with awk instead of having to grep first. [00:58:05]
