2016-09-16 05:29:21	fcolista	This is a CSV (is longer, but the format is like this):
2016-09-16 05:29:21	fcolista	SNOM Model 820,<%CHANGEME%>,FreeLine,00AABBCCDDEE,,,,,,,,1234,"Name, Surname Number",,false,,false,,false,,,Description

2016-09-16 05:30:07	fcolista	http://pastebin.com/KKDbLNRH
2016-09-16 05:30:18	fcolista	What i need to do is adding, after "Name, Surname Number" or Name, Surname Room Number a country code, let's say USA.
2016-09-16 05:30:26	fcolista	So, that field should become:
2016-09-16 05:30:33	fcolista	"Name, Surname Number USA" and Name, Surname Room Number USA. Maybe with double quotes, but it is not important.
2016-09-16 05:30:40	fcolista	As far as i understand, i need to figure out first a patter that matches the field, and then add USA.
2016-09-16 05:30:40	fcolista	Can someone help me with that? Thanks.

2016-09-16 05:39:18	fcolista	Name, Surname and Room are different
2016-09-16 05:39:26	fcolista	It's the actual name, surname and room
2016-09-16 05:39:34	fcolista	thx for the reply go|dfish
2016-09-16 05:39:46	go|dfish	oh right
2016-09-16 05:39:50	fcolista	sorry if i'm not explained correctly
2016-09-16 05:39:51	go|dfish	heh
2016-09-16 05:39:59	fcolista	i need to iterate that
2016-09-16 05:40:34	go|dfish	hmmm, so, some lines are "broken" and some are not
2016-09-16 05:40:37	fcolista	i'm looking for a way to do that, but i've not figuret iet
2016-09-16 05:40:44	fcolista	go|dfish, correct.
2016-09-16 05:41:22	fcolista	what is consistent, though, are the 4 digits before what i need to change
2016-09-16 05:41:24	fcolista	so
2016-09-16 05:41:25	fcolista	1234
2016-09-16 05:41:28	fcolista	and 5678
2016-09-16 05:41:53	fcolista	those are unique and they are in all the lines
2016-09-16 05:42:02	fcolista	this is what i'd like to exploit
2016-09-16 05:47:18	go|dfish	fcolista: well, in those 2 examples you can count on the name being $13 and the surname room number being $14
2016-09-16 05:47:32	go|dfish	so you could do something horrible like: awk -F, -v OFS=, '$13 !~ /^"/ { $13 = "\"" $13 } { sub (/"$/, "", $14); $14 = $14" USA\""; print }'
2016-09-16 05:49:11	fcolista	:)
2016-09-16 05:49:29	go|dfish	could put it all into the sub() i suppose: { sub (/"?$/, " USA\"", $14); print
2016-09-16 05:49:41	fcolista	i cannot count on Field Number
2016-09-16 05:50:03	go|dfish	{{terz}}
2016-09-16 05:50:07	fcolista	:)
2016-09-16 05:50:15	fcolista	i told you that was not that easy :)
2016-09-16 05:50:41	go|dfish	so what can you count on? it being the field after "the first field that is just all digits"?
2016-09-16 05:50:53	fcolista	correct.
2016-09-16 05:51:31	fcolista	and consider that the next field (the one i want to modify)
2016-09-16 05:51:31		[05:51]
2016-09-16 05:51:47	go|dfish	well, you can loop through to find it, for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) if ($i ~ /^[0-9]+$/) i-found-u

2016-09-16 06:02:17	fcolista	this put a double quote in all the fields
2016-09-16 06:02:57	fcolista	but this breaks the count of the field
2016-09-16 06:03:32	fcolista	anyway
2016-09-16 06:03:51	fcolista	it's interesting for learning
2016-09-16 06:04:12	fcolista	care to explain me how does it work? If you can and/or have time
2016-09-16 06:04:23	fcolista	OFS= set the field separator
2016-09-16 06:04:31	fcolista	than you have a counter
2016-09-16 06:05:07	fcolista	NF is number of field
2016-09-16 06:05:19	fcolista	so in the variable i
2016-09-16 06:05:35	go|dfish	fcolista: yes, so for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) is a way to loop through all the field numbers
2016-09-16 06:05:44	fcolista	each time it matches the pattern /^[0-9]+$/
2016-09-16 06:05:46	go|dfish	so when i = 1, $i is $1 i.e. field 1

2016-09-16 06:06:11	fcolista	the next part of the script is not clear to me

2016-09-16 06:10:35	fcolista	very interesting
2016-09-16 06:11:01	fcolista	I suppose thie can be optimized by a better pattern matching regexp
2016-09-16 06:11:06	fcolista	*this
2016-09-16 06:11:33	go|dfish	well, i thought you wanted to "fix" the "broken" lines by adding the double quotes back in

2016-09-16 06:12:00	fcolista	you're right go|dfish, but this alters the number of fields in the CSB

2016-09-16 06:12:16	go|dfish	oh right, yes, that's true

2016-09-16 17:23:41	izalove	i posted a link

2016-09-16 17:25:02	ttmrichter	I guess some would find the ads upsetting.

2016-09-16 17:25:42	ttmrichter	More the ISP.

2016-09-16 17:29:45	ttmrichter	Yep. Checked positive.
2016-09-16 17:31:59	nal	specifically this part is a little upsetting "The implementation of user-defined functions was a compromise. The chief difficulties arose from the initial design of awk. We did not have, or want, declarations in the language. One result is the peculiar way of declaring local variables as extra formal parameters. Besides looking strange, this is error prone in large programs."
2016-09-16 17:32:03	nal	thats all really
2016-09-16 17:32:24	ttmrichter	Any more from your grade 8 playground interaction handbook you want to try out?
2016-09-16 17:33:10	izalove	so glad that weechat has an ignore list
2016-09-16 17:33:21	nal	*sigh*
2016-09-16 17:34:25	izalove	the lack of declarations isn't too bad
2016-09-16 17:34:47	izalove	several other languages get away with something similar
2016-09-16 17:35:19	ttmrichter	nal: I don't appear to upset as easily as the newer generation of programmer. Largely, I suspect, because of some of the true horrors of tooling I've had to use.
2016-09-16 17:36:02	ttmrichter	Awk isn't even CLOSE to being a horror by comparison.
2016-09-16 17:36:39	nal	what i meant by upset was annoyed, not happy about it, etc
