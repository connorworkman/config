2016-09-16 05:29:21	fcolista	This is a CSV (is longer, but the format is like this):
2016-09-16 05:29:21	fcolista	SNOM Model 820,<%CHANGEME%>,FreeLine,00AABBCCDDEE,,,,,,,,1234,"Name, Surname Number",,false,,false,,false,,,Description

2016-09-16 05:30:07	fcolista	http://pastebin.com/KKDbLNRH
2016-09-16 05:30:18	fcolista	What i need to do is adding, after "Name, Surname Number" or Name, Surname Room Number a country code, let's say USA.
2016-09-16 05:30:26	fcolista	So, that field should become:
2016-09-16 05:30:33	fcolista	"Name, Surname Number USA" and Name, Surname Room Number USA. Maybe with double quotes, but it is not important.
2016-09-16 05:30:40	fcolista	As far as i understand, i need to figure out first a patter that matches the field, and then add USA.
2016-09-16 05:30:40	fcolista	Can someone help me with that? Thanks.

2016-09-16 05:39:18	fcolista	Name, Surname and Room are different
2016-09-16 05:39:26	fcolista	It's the actual name, surname and room
2016-09-16 05:39:34	fcolista	thx for the reply go|dfish
2016-09-16 05:39:46	go|dfish	oh right
2016-09-16 05:39:50	fcolista	sorry if i'm not explained correctly
2016-09-16 05:39:51	go|dfish	heh
2016-09-16 05:39:59	fcolista	i need to iterate that
2016-09-16 05:40:34	go|dfish	hmmm, so, some lines are "broken" and some are not
2016-09-16 05:40:37	fcolista	i'm looking for a way to do that, but i've not figuret iet
2016-09-16 05:40:44	fcolista	go|dfish, correct.
2016-09-16 05:41:22	fcolista	what is consistent, though, are the 4 digits before what i need to change
2016-09-16 05:41:24	fcolista	so
2016-09-16 05:41:25	fcolista	1234
2016-09-16 05:41:28	fcolista	and 5678
2016-09-16 05:41:53	fcolista	those are unique and they are in all the lines
2016-09-16 05:42:02	fcolista	this is what i'd like to exploit
2016-09-16 05:47:18	go|dfish	fcolista: well, in those 2 examples you can count on the name being $13 and the surname room number being $14
2016-09-16 05:47:32	go|dfish	so you could do something horrible like: awk -F, -v OFS=, '$13 !~ /^"/ { $13 = "\"" $13 } { sub (/"$/, "", $14); $14 = $14" USA\""; print }'
2016-09-16 05:49:11	fcolista	:)
2016-09-16 05:49:29	go|dfish	could put it all into the sub() i suppose: { sub (/"?$/, " USA\"", $14); print
2016-09-16 05:49:41	fcolista	i cannot count on Field Number
2016-09-16 05:50:03	go|dfish	{{terz}}
2016-09-16 05:50:07	fcolista	:)
2016-09-16 05:50:15	fcolista	i told you that was not that easy :)
2016-09-16 05:50:41	go|dfish	so what can you count on? it being the field after "the first field that is just all digits"?
2016-09-16 05:50:53	fcolista	correct.
2016-09-16 05:51:31	fcolista	and consider that the next field (the one i want to modify)
2016-09-16 05:51:31		[05:51]
2016-09-16 05:51:47	go|dfish	well, you can loop through to find it, for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) if ($i ~ /^[0-9]+$/) i-found-u

2016-09-16 06:02:17	fcolista	this put a double quote in all the fields
2016-09-16 06:02:57	fcolista	but this breaks the count of the field
2016-09-16 06:03:32	fcolista	anyway
2016-09-16 06:03:51	fcolista	it's interesting for learning
2016-09-16 06:04:12	fcolista	care to explain me how does it work? If you can and/or have time
2016-09-16 06:04:23	fcolista	OFS= set the field separator
2016-09-16 06:04:31	fcolista	than you have a counter
2016-09-16 06:05:07	fcolista	NF is number of field
2016-09-16 06:05:19	fcolista	so in the variable i
2016-09-16 06:05:35	go|dfish	fcolista: yes, so for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) is a way to loop through all the field numbers
2016-09-16 06:05:44	fcolista	each time it matches the pattern /^[0-9]+$/
2016-09-16 06:05:46	go|dfish	so when i = 1, $i is $1 i.e. field 1

2016-09-16 06:10:35	fcolista	very interesting
2016-09-16 06:11:01	fcolista	I suppose thie can be optimized by a better pattern matching regexp
2016-09-16 06:11:06	fcolista	*this
2016-09-16 06:11:33	go|dfish	well, i thought you wanted to "fix" the "broken" lines by adding the double quotes back in

2016-09-16 06:12:00	fcolista	you're right go|dfish, but this alters the number of fields in the CSB

2016-09-16 06:12:16	go|dfish	oh right, yes, that's true

2016-09-16 17:31:59	nal	specifically this part is a little upsetting "The implementation of user-defined functions was a compromise. The chief difficulties arose from the initial design of awk. We did not have, or want, declarations in the language. One result is the peculiar way of declaring local variables as extra formal parameters. Besides looking strange, this is error prone in large programs."

2016-09-16 17:38:50	ttmrichter	Well I solve that issue by not using Awk for large programs.

2016-09-17 13:27:33	drgeb	rods-tab3 that prints the current line

2016-09-17 13:27:48	yitz	What's "next"?
2016-09-17 13:27:50	drgeb	which did  not work
2016-09-17 13:28:21	yitz	"The next statement forces awk to immediately stop processing the current record and go on to the next record. This means that no further rules are executed for the current record, and the rest of the current rule’s action isn’t executed.
2016-09-17 13:28:33	drgeb	here is the input file http://termbin.com/6ujc

2016-09-17 13:28:52	drgeb	so I need to search for oracle.retail.stores.foundation.tour.engine.PseudoSite.arrive\(PseudoSite.java:19
2016-09-17 13:28:54	yitz	Are you sure you want to do "next"?
2016-09-17 13:29:11	drgeb	when I see this I want the next line which can be either
2016-09-17 13:29:34	yitz	Did you read what "next" does?
2016-09-17 13:31:30	drgeb	i think next is for loops
2016-09-17 13:32:19	drgeb	Thanks yitz!!!
2016-09-17 13:32:41	yitz	Do you see a loop anywhere?
2016-09-17 13:33:06	drgeb	Thanks rods-tab3 I was all over the place and not simply calmly reading I guess I want to get this done to quickly and it takes time to learn and understand
2016-09-17 13:33:32	rods-tab3	yes
2016-09-17 13:36:56	drgeb	i now need to store a variable, is there a good site I should ue overall for learning this
2016-09-17 13:37:09	yitz	var = "foo"
2016-09-17 13:37:13	yitz	See the topic
2016-09-17 13:37:22	drgeb	problem is I don’t have lots of time on Monday I am flying to the csutomer
2016-09-17 13:37:49	yitz	You could show a sample input and sample desired output and someone may feel like writing awk for you
2016-09-17 13:38:55	drgeb	Thanks yitz go to play with this construct and see if I can store the result in my first search pattern and display this when it hits my next search pattern

2016-09-17 13:52:34	drgeb	the output looks funky    Letter:"Failure"OldSite: AuthorizationStation. NewSite: TenderingInfoUI
2016-09-17 13:53:03	yitz	You need spaces around variable names
2016-09-17 13:53:17	yitz	Or, rather, around strings you want to join
2016-09-17 13:56:01	drgeb	in the doc it says Strings are concatenated by being adjacent: hw = "hello" "world"  x to "helloworld".  Watch out; this often has surprising properties.
2016-09-17 13:56:01		[13:56]
2016-09-17 13:56:34	drgeb	but I am concatenating while performing a print
2016-09-17 13:57:33	yitz	Strings are concatenated with a " " (space)
2016-09-17 13:57:50	yitz	You can try doing the same thing over and hoping for change or you can believe what you're being told
2016-09-17 14:03:00		[13:57]
2016-09-17 14:04:56	drgeb	:)
2016-09-17 14:06:02	drgeb	I think my newsite variable is funky it contains maybe the newline and this is causing the issue
2016-09-17 14:12:00		[14:06]
2016-09-17 14:20:55	yitz	You mean a carriage return (\r)?
2016-09-17 14:22:55	drgeb	yes
2016-09-17 14:25:17	drgeb	i decided to print each assignment separately and seems ok except Letter: "Failure" contains double quotes so my regexp is not correct where I have
2016-09-17 14:25:42	drgeb	 /BusDriver\ for\ service\ .*\ is\ processing\ \".*\"/ { letter=$7; print "****" letter }
2016-09-17 14:26:28	drgeb	and I have the \” .* \” so i thought it would not make letter be assigned with the double quotes
2016-09-17 14:27:10	drgeb	my output looks like ****"FinalLetter"
2016-09-17 14:27:10		[14:27]
2016-09-17 14:27:20	drgeb	and not ***FinalLetter

2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:28:52] so I need to search for oracle.retail.stores.foundation.tour.engine.PseudoSite.arrive\(PseudoSite.java:19 [23:28:52]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:28:54] Are you sure you want to do "next"? [23:28:54]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:29:11] when I see this I want the next line which can be either [23:29:11]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:29:34] Did you read what "next" does? [23:29:34]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:31:30] i think next is for loops [23:31:30]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:32:19] Thanks yitz!!! [23:32:19]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:32:41] Do you see a loop anywhere? [23:32:41]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:33:06] Thanks rods-tab3 I was all over the place and not simply calmly reading I guess I want to get this done to quickly and it takes time to learn and understand [23:33:06]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	rods-tab3	[23:33:32] yes [23:33:32]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:36:56] i now need to store a variable, is there a good site I should ue overall for learning this [23:36:56]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:37:09] var = "foo" [23:37:09]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:37:13] See the topic [23:37:13]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:37:22] problem is I don’t have lots of time on Monday I am flying to the csutomer [23:37:22]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:37:49] You could show a sample input and sample desired output and someone may feel like writing awk for you [23:37:49]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:38:55] Thanks yitz go to play with this construct and see if I can store the result in my first search pattern and display this when it hits my next search pattern [23:38:55]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	rods-tab3	[23:43:48] !concise [23:43:48]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	hawkbot	[23:43:49]  concise:  http://cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr15/cos333/awk.help [23:43:49]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:44:10] Nice [23:44:10]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:49:23] :) [23:49:23]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:50:05] eek [23:50:05]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:50:14] i updated the code to http://termbin.com/3gej [23:50:14]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:50:56] defined my variables in BEGIN [23:50:56]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:51:28] but then when i say to:            print " Service: "service" OldSite: "oldsite" NewSite: "newsite" Letter:"letter [23:51:28]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	*buffextras	[23:52:20] oliverio!~oliverio@unaffiliated/oliverio joined [23:52:20]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:52:34] the output looks funky    Letter:"Failure"OldSite: AuthorizationStation. NewSite: TenderingInfoUI [23:52:34]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:53:03] You need spaces around variable names [23:53:03]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:53:17] Or, rather, around strings you want to join [23:53:17]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:56:01] in the doc it says Strings are concatenated by being adjacent: hw = "hello" "world"  x to "helloworld".  Watch out; this often has surprising properties. [23:56:01]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:56:34] but I am concatenating while performing a print [23:56:34]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:57:33] Strings are concatenated with a " " (space) [23:57:33]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:57:49] You can try doing the same thing over and hoping for change or you can believe what you're being told [23:57:49]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:04:56] :) [00:04:56]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:06:02] I think my newsite variable is funky it contains maybe the newline and this is causing the issue [00:06:02]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[00:20:55] You mean a carriage return (\r)? [00:20:55]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:22:55] yes [00:22:55]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:25:17] i decided to print each assignment separately and seems ok except Letter: "Failure" contains double quotes so my regexp is not correct where I have [00:25:17]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:25:42]  /BusDriver\ for\ service\ .*\ is\ processing\ \".*\"/ { letter=$7; print "****" letter } [00:25:42]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:26:27] and I have the \” .* \” so i thought it would not make letter be assigned with the double quotes [00:26:27]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:27:09] my output looks like ****"FinalLetter" [00:27:09]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:27:19] and not ***FinalLetter [00:27:19]

2016-09-17 14:53:48	yitz	Yes. The " is treated like any other character in the string
2016-09-17 14:53:56	yitz	You can use gsub() to remove them

2016-09-17 17:35:24	yitz	drgeb: the regex just says if the line matches or not. It doesn't modify the line or the value of $7
2016-09-17 17:36:27	drgeb	I finally got it to work using reverse psychology or reverse expression
2016-09-17 17:36:41	drgeb	so instead of \”(.*)\”
2016-09-17 17:37:00	drgeb	i used v

2016-09-17 17:38:48	drgeb	:) Okie Dokie!!!
2016-09-17 17:38:55	drgeb	Thanks yitz!!!
2016-09-17 17:39:11	yitz	There's good approaches and bad approaches which are learned with experience
2016-09-17 17:39:26	yitz	(Which is what I said 4 hours ago)

2016-09-17 17:50:38	drgeb	with awk are there expressions for parsing words

2016-09-17 18:00:30	drgeb	Can’t figure it out again
2016-09-17 18:00:38	drgeb	I have to parse the string
2016-09-17 18:00:38	drgeb	      BusDriver changes site within InitializeSale service. Old site was CheckAccountability. New site is OperatorIdStation
2016-09-17 18:00:42	drgeb	I have
2016-09-17 18:01:06	drgeb	 /BusDriver changes site within .* service. Old site was ([^\.]*)\. New site is .*/
2016-09-17 18:01:57	drgeb	its greedy and grabbing the period for the string I am interested in at $10
2016-09-17 18:05:55	yitz	awk splits on whitespace
2016-09-17 18:06:24	yitz	You can change the field separator but it defaults to whitespace. So the 10th entry is CheckAccountability.
2016-09-17 18:06:50	yitz	You can use gsub again to strip any '.' from $10
2016-09-17 18:07:13	yitz	val = sub(/\.$/, "", $10)

2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[03:35:24] drgeb: the regex just says if the line matches or not. It doesn't modify the line or the value of $7 [03:35:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:36:27] I finally got it to work using reverse psychology or reverse expression [03:36:27]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:36:41] so instead of \”(.*)\” [03:36:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:37:00] i used v [03:37:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:37:02] \"([^\"]*)\"/ [03:37:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:37:45] oopsy control v paste  messed me up :) but 45 minutes lost for just something this simple and crazy in writting expressions [03:37:45]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[03:38:25] drgeb: Next time try sharing your input line and sample output and ask someone to show how to best achieve it :P [03:38:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:38:48] :) Okie Dokie!!! [03:38:48]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:38:55] Thanks yitz!!! [03:38:55]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[03:39:11] There's good approaches and bad approaches which are learned with experience [03:39:11]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[03:39:26] (Which is what I said 4 hours ago) [03:39:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:50:15] :) [03:50:15]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:50:38] with awk are there expressions for parsing words [03:50:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:00:29] Can’t figure it out again [04:00:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:00:38] I have to parse the string [04:00:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:00:38]       BusDriver changes site within InitializeSale service. Old site was CheckAccountability. New site is OperatorIdStation [04:00:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:00:42] I have [04:00:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:01:06]  /BusDriver changes site within .* service. Old site was ([^\.]*)\. New site is .*/ [04:01:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:01:57] its greedy and grabbing the period for the string I am interested in at $10 [04:01:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[04:05:55] awk splits on whitespace [04:05:55]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[04:06:24] You can change the field separator but it defaults to whitespace. So the 10th entry is CheckAccountability. [04:06:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[04:06:50] You can use gsub again to strip any '.' from $10 [04:06:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[04:07:13] val = sub(/\.$/, "", $10) [04:07:13]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:24:57] nope getting a 1 [04:24:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:24:59] http://termbin.com/cqny [04:24:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:25:18] so it keeps printing OldSite: 1 [04:25:18]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	nal1	[04:27:02] the hell is var? [04:27:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:27:23] ? [04:27:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	nal1	[04:28:35] drgeb: ? [04:28:35]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	nal1	[04:29:18] drgeb: thats not how you set variables [04:29:18]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[04:31:07] My bad. var = $10; sub(/\.$/, "", var) [04:31:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[05:56:10] well i got my inital picture [05:56:10]

2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[03:35:24] drgeb: the regex just says if the line matches or not. It doesn't modify the line or the value of $7 [03:35:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:36:27] I finally got it to work using reverse psychology or reverse expression [03:36:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:36:41] so instead of \”(.*)\” [03:36:41]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:37:00] i used v [03:37:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:37:02] \"([^\"]*)\"/ [03:37:02]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:37:45] oopsy control v paste  messed me up :) but 45 minutes lost for just something this simple and crazy in writting expressions [03:37:45]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[03:38:25] drgeb: Next time try sharing your input line and sample output and ask someone to show how to best achieve it :P [03:38:25]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:38:48] :) Okie Dokie!!! [03:38:48]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:38:55] Thanks yitz!!! [03:38:55]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[03:39:11] There's good approaches and bad approaches which are learned with experience [03:39:11]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[03:39:26] (Which is what I said 4 hours ago) [03:39:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:50:15] :) [03:50:15]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:50:38] with awk are there expressions for parsing words [03:50:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:00:29] Can’t figure it out again [04:00:29]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:00:38] I have to parse the string [04:00:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:00:38]       BusDriver changes site within InitializeSale service. Old site was CheckAccountability. New site is OperatorIdStation [04:00:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:00:42] I have [04:00:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:01:06]  /BusDriver changes site within .* service. Old site was ([^\.]*)\. New site is .*/ [04:01:06]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:01:57] its greedy and grabbing the period for the string I am interested in at $10 [04:01:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[04:05:55] awk splits on whitespace [04:05:55]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[04:06:24] You can change the field separator but it defaults to whitespace. So the 10th entry is CheckAccountability. [04:06:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[04:06:50] You can use gsub again to strip any '.' from $10 [04:06:50]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[04:07:13] val = sub(/\.$/, "", $10) [04:07:13]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:24:57] nope getting a 1 [04:24:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:24:59] http://termbin.com/cqny [04:24:59]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:25:18] so it keeps printing OldSite: 1 [04:25:18]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	nal1	[04:27:02] the hell is var? [04:27:02]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:27:23] ? [04:27:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	nal1	[04:28:35] drgeb: ? [04:28:35]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	nal1	[04:29:18] drgeb: thats not how you set variables [04:29:18]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[04:31:07] My bad. var = $10; sub(/\.$/, "", var) [04:31:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[05:56:10] well i got my inital picture [05:56:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[05:56:24] not sure how I can post this so you can see it [05:56:24]

2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[10:00:28] I should change my nick since this val thing is higlighting my name. [10:00:28]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[10:00:31] where can I complain? [10:00:31]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[10:00:46] ^^ [10:00:46]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	Riviera	[10:08:14] the IRC committee [10:08:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:08:45] lol Riviera [11:08:45]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:09:15] It's werid because my nich still has those underscores but anyways I don't think anyone cres. [11:09:15]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:09:20] cares even. [11:09:20]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	Riviera	[11:16:08] Since you are anyway mostly not active in IRC, at least as far as I can tell, I think you yourself don't care too much. :) [11:16:08]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:20:35] Riviera: I am quite often on irc. Just observing and learning from ccleintelligent people. [11:20:35]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:21:01] jesus. This lag is annoying [11:21:01]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	Riviera	[11:21:32] Did you try mosh? [11:21:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:23:28] Riviera: you mean the "Mobile Shell" ? [11:23:28]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	Riviera	[11:24:33] yup! [11:24:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:26:11] I am using irssi in a screen session(which runs at work). I think the connection from home to work is wanky. [11:26:11]

2016-09-19 02:43:55	drgeb	[04:00:38] I have to parse the string [04:00:38]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	drgeb	[04:00:38]       BusDriver changes site within InitializeSale service. Old site was CheckAccountability. New site is OperatorIdStation [04:00:38]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	drgeb	[04:00:42] I have [04:00:42]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	drgeb	[04:01:06]  /BusDriver changes site within .* service. Old site was ([^\.]*)\. New site is .*/ [04:01:06]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	drgeb	[04:01:57] its greedy and grabbing the period for the string I am interested in at $10 [04:01:57]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	yitz	[04:05:55] awk splits on whitespace [04:05:55]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	yitz	[04:06:24] You can change the field separator but it defaults to whitespace. So the 10th entry is CheckAccountability. [04:06:24]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	yitz	[04:06:50] You can use gsub again to strip any '.' from $10 [04:06:50]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	yitz	[04:07:13] val = sub(/\.$/, "", $10) [04:07:13]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	drgeb	[04:24:57] nope getting a 1 [04:24:57]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	drgeb	[04:24:59] http://termbin.com/cqny [04:24:59]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	drgeb	[04:25:18] so it keeps printing OldSite: 1 [04:25:18]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	nal1	[04:27:02] the hell is var? [04:27:02]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	drgeb	[04:27:23] ? [04:27:23]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	nal1	[04:28:35] drgeb: ? [04:28:35]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	nal1	[04:29:18] drgeb: thats not how you set variables [04:29:18]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	yitz	[04:31:07] My bad. var = $10; sub(/\.$/, "", var) [04:31:07]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	drgeb	[05:56:10] well i got my inital picture [05:56:10]

2016-09-19 02:43:55	_val_	[10:00:28] I should change my nick since this val thing is higlighting my name. [10:00:28]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	_val_	[10:00:31] where can I complain? [10:00:31]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	_val_	[10:00:46] ^^ [10:00:46]

2016-09-19 02:43:55	_val_	[11:08:45] lol Riviera [11:08:45]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	_val_	[11:09:15] It's werid because my nich still has those underscores but anyways I don't think anyone cres. [11:09:15]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	_val_	[11:09:20] cares even. [11:09:20]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	Riviera	[11:16:08] Since you are anyway mostly not active in IRC, at least as far as I can tell, I think you yourself don't care too much. :) [11:16:08]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	_val_	[11:20:35] Riviera: I am quite often on irc. Just observing and learning from ccleintelligent people. [11:20:35]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	_val_	[11:21:01] jesus. This lag is annoying [11:21:01]

2016-09-19 02:43:55	_val_	[11:23:28] Riviera: you mean the "Mobile Shell" ? [11:23:28]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	Riviera	[11:24:33] yup! [11:24:33]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	_val_	[11:26:11] I am using irssi in a screen session(which runs at work). I think the connection from home to work is wanky. [11:26:11]

2016-09-19 02:43:55	rods-tab3	[02:10:46] 2nd not a bug - something(value) is a function call [02:10:46]

2016-09-19 02:43:55	geirha	[07:19:00] print OFS "" ("OK")   might be a workaround [07:19:00]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	izalove	[07:25:07] why ("OK") ? [07:25:07]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	geirha	[07:33:07] to provoke an error, why else? [07:33:07]

2016-09-19 05:16:05	ash_workz	I'm formatting columns
2016-09-19 05:17:11	linedash	just as an aside, which isn't awk - but might make your life easier
2016-09-19 05:17:21	linedash	have you tried parsing your output through the 'column' command ?
2016-09-19 05:17:37	linedash	as it's designed to auto-column things
2016-09-19 05:17:49	ash_workz	linedash: no... but can you format flush left-right with column?
2016-09-19 05:18:07	linedash	honestly; no idea
2016-09-19 05:18:09	linedash	man column :)

2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[14:21:26] can' [14:21:26]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[14:21:42] can't get it to work :\ [14:21:42]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[14:22:00] but yeah the $1=$1 doesn't do the trick; I need to strip \w from ALL fields [14:22:00]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[14:22:22] so '    some      ,    thing     ,    one       ' => 'some,thing,one' [14:22:22]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	bwe	[15:04:55] xpt: I was just searching for some means to highlight the EOS. [15:04:55]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:05:00] gsub(" +", "") worked [15:05:00]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:05:16] without identifying a target [15:05:16]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:05:53] is it possible to perform a variable check on each field [15:05:53]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	bwe	[15:06:05] ash_workz: sub is wrong as it stops after one substitution. gsub is what you want. My fault. [15:06:05]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:07:52] for example, if NF is the current field number being checked, then `length($NF) > var[NF] { var[NF] = length($NF)} END { print var[NF] }` [15:07:52]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:09:03] NF isn't what I want though [15:09:03]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:09:07] because NF = Number of FIelds [15:09:07]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:09:16] which is obviously the last field [15:09:16]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:09:31] I'm looking for something iterative [15:09:31]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:10:03] so I can do something like if $1 = ..., if $2 = ..., if $3 = ..., etc. [15:10:03]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:12:56] maybe I can't do it outside '{}' [15:12:56]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	waldner	[15:14:39] for (i = 1; i<= NF; i++) { ... do something with $i ... } [15:14:39]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:14:53] yeah, that goes in an action thought [15:14:53]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:15:07] I was hoping to run length() on each field outside the action [15:15:07]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	waldner	[15:15:45] said that way it doesn't make much sense [15:15:45]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	waldner	[15:15:52] what's your real goal? [15:15:52]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:16:05] I'm formatting columns [15:16:05]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	linedash	[15:17:11] just as an aside, which isn't awk - but might make your life easier [15:17:11]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	linedash	[15:17:21] have you tried parsing your output through the 'column' command ? [15:17:21]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	linedash	[15:17:37] as it's designed to auto-column things [15:17:37]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:17:49] linedash: no... but can you format flush left-right with column? [15:17:49]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	linedash	[15:18:07] honestly; no idea [15:18:07]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	linedash	[15:18:09] man column :) [15:18:09]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:18:51] I don't see it [15:18:51]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ash_workz	[15:18:53] in there [15:18:53]

2016-09-20 00:39:06	Camusensei	[08:21:06] Hello guys. Yesterday, I wanted to create an array, but didn't know how to do that, so I did something like this: awk '{g["A"]=1; g["B"]=1; g["C"]=1; g["D"]=1; g["E"]=1; g["F"]=1; ...'  What could I have used instead? [08:21:06]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	geirha	[08:21:58] an extra input file [08:21:58]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	Camusensei	[08:28:26] sounds even more complicated :D [08:28:26]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	geirha	[08:39:35] awk 'FNR==NR{g[$1]=1;next} ...' <(printf '%s\n' {A..F}) ... [08:39:35]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	linedash	[08:41:47] geirha: sometimes I think I know a good bit of awk, then you paste something casually and I'm like 'nope, I know nothing' [08:41:47]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	linedash	[08:41:54] :D [08:41:54]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	Camusensei	[09:06:53] haha linedash [09:06:53]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	Riviera	[09:55:48] Camusensei: When already relying on a particular awk variant (like gawk) you could use   split("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", g, "")   # not POSIX [09:55:48]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	Riviera	[09:55:56] ah, damn. [09:55:56]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	Riviera	[09:55:59] misread the task. :D [09:55:59]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	Riviera	[09:57:06] Camusensei: well, I think I'd just write it out like you did, or use a loop and sprintf() if it were more than A..F [09:57:06]

2016-09-20 12:46:45	Riviera	epequeno: Do you have any idea, any guess?
2016-09-20 12:49:26	epequeno	when the regex matches, we set a var to 1, at the end, we use that 1, somehow that tells awk to keep printing to the EOF
2016-09-20 12:49:26		[12:49]
2016-09-20 12:50:15	epequeno	which behaves the same way as '/^t/,0' somehow
2016-09-20 12:50:18	Riviera	epequeno: Do you know you can not only use regexes as conditions?  Also things like
2016-09-20 12:50:27	Riviera	epequeno: awk 'NR > 3 { print }'
2016-09-20 12:50:39	Riviera	epequeno: ?
2016-09-20 12:50:43	epequeno	sure
2016-09-20 12:50:49	Riviera	epequeno: now let's do the following
2016-09-20 12:50:54	Riviera	epequeno: awk 'q { print }'
2016-09-20 12:51:09	Riviera	epequeno: That's quite similar to the NR > 3 thing before, isn't it?
2016-09-20 12:51:15	epequeno	yes
2016-09-20 12:51:31	Camusensei	_Raiz: awkshift (){ [[ $1 != *[!0-9]* && $1 != '' ]] || return 1;awk -v n=$1 '{for (i=n+1;i<=NF;i+=1) $(i-n)=$i; newNF=NF-n; if (newNF > 0) NF=newNF; else NF=0}1';}
2016-09-20 12:51:37	Riviera	epequeno: "print the current record when q is true", right?
2016-09-20 12:51:52	epequeno	yes that makes sense
2016-09-20 12:52:09	Riviera	epequeno: we can omit { print }, because that's the default action when no action is given,
2016-09-20 12:52:27	Riviera	epequeno: so "awk q" would print its input if q were true
2016-09-20 12:52:36	epequeno	right...
2016-09-20 12:52:42	Riviera	epequeno: of course "q" is not true, because it's initialised as 0, but we could test that with
2016-09-20 12:52:45	Riviera	epequeno: awk 1
2016-09-20 12:52:49	Riviera	# seq 2 | awk 1
2016-09-20 12:52:51	shbot	Riviera: one
2016-09-20 12:52:51	shbot	Riviera: two
2016-09-20 12:52:59	Riviera	epequeno: so, well, I believe your question is answered? :)
2016-09-20 12:53:43	epequeno	yes I think so, but negative values are truthy in awk?
2016-09-20 12:53:53	epequeno	setting it to -1 instead does the same thing
2016-09-20 12:53:58	epequeno	but 0 doesn't work
2016-09-20 12:54:41	Riviera	epequeno: 0 counts as false, and the empty string does
2016-09-20 12:54:59	epequeno	ok, so when we match the first regex, we set some value to true then evaluate it the next record doesn't have to match the regex as x is still set to 1 and we'll continue to print to EOF
2016-09-20 12:55:46	Riviera	epequeno: correct
2016-09-20 12:56:19	epequeno	ok thank you, while that makes the first example make sense now `/^t/,0` makes less sense

2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:44:38] I don't understand how {q=1}q is working here: https://gist.github.com/epequeno/f08a8779e52609a6584a8aac9449bc45 [22:44:38]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:46:45] epequeno: Do you have any idea, any guess? [22:46:45]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:49:26] when the regex matches, we set a var to 1, at the end, we use that 1, somehow that tells awk to keep printing to the EOF [22:49:26]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:50:15] which behaves the same way as '/^t/,0' somehow [22:50:15]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:50:18] epequeno: Do you know you can not only use regexes as conditions?  Also things like [22:50:18]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:50:27] epequeno: awk 'NR > 3 { print }' [22:50:27]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:50:39] epequeno: ? [22:50:39]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:50:43] sure [22:50:43]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:50:49] epequeno: now let's do the following [22:50:49]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:50:54] epequeno: awk 'q { print }' [22:50:54]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:51:09] epequeno: That's quite similar to the NR > 3 thing before, isn't it? [22:51:09]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:51:15] yes [22:51:15]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Camusensei	[22:51:31] _Raiz: awkshift (){ [[ $1 != *[!0-9]* && $1 != '' ]] || return 1;awk -v n=$1 '{for (i=n+1;i<=NF;i+=1) $(i-n)=$i; newNF=NF-n; if (newNF > 0) NF=newNF; else NF=0}1';} [22:51:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:51:37] epequeno: "print the current record when q is true", right? [22:51:37]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:51:52] yes that makes sense [22:51:52]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:52:09] epequeno: we can omit { print }, because that's the default action when no action is given, [22:52:09]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:52:27] epequeno: so "awk q" would print its input if q were true [22:52:27]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:52:36] right... [22:52:36]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:52:42] epequeno: of course "q" is not true, because it's initialised as 0, but we could test that with [22:52:42]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:52:45] epequeno: awk 1 [22:52:45]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:52:49] # seq 2 | awk 1 [22:52:49]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	shbot	[22:52:51] Riviera: one [22:52:51]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	shbot	[22:52:51] Riviera: two [22:52:51]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:52:59] epequeno: so, well, I believe your question is answered? :) [22:52:59]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:53:43] yes I think so, but negative values are truthy in awk? [22:53:43]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:53:53] setting it to -1 instead does the same thing [22:53:53]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:53:58] but 0 doesn't work [22:53:58]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:54:41] epequeno: 0 counts as false, and the empty string does [22:54:41]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:54:59] ok, so when we match the first regex, we set some value to true then evaluate it the next record doesn't have to match the regex as x is still set to 1 and we'll continue to print to EOF [22:54:59]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:55:46] epequeno: correct [22:55:46]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	epequeno	[22:56:19] ok thank you, while that makes the first example make sense now `/^t/,0` makes less sense [22:56:19]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Riviera	[22:57:02] agreed :) [22:57:02]

2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:50:27] epequeno: awk 'NR > 3 { print }' [22:50:27]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:50:39] epequeno: ? [22:50:39]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	epequeno	[22:50:43] sure [22:50:43]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:50:49] epequeno: now let's do the following [22:50:49]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:50:54] epequeno: awk 'q { print }' [22:50:54]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:51:09] epequeno: That's quite similar to the NR > 3 thing before, isn't it? [22:51:09]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	epequeno	[22:51:15] yes [22:51:15]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Camusensei	[22:51:31] _Raiz: awkshift (){ [[ $1 != *[!0-9]* && $1 != '' ]] || return 1;awk -v n=$1 '{for (i=n+1;i<=NF;i+=1) $(i-n)=$i; newNF=NF-n; if (newNF > 0) NF=newNF; else NF=0}1';} [22:51:31]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:51:37] epequeno: "print the current record when q is true", right? [22:51:37]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	epequeno	[22:51:52] yes that makes sense [22:51:52]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:52:09] epequeno: we can omit { print }, because that's the default action when no action is given, [22:52:09]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:52:27] epequeno: so "awk q" would print its input if q were true [22:52:27]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	epequeno	[22:52:36] right... [22:52:36]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:52:42] epequeno: of course "q" is not true, because it's initialised as 0, but we could test that with [22:52:42]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:52:45] epequeno: awk 1 [22:52:45]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:52:49] # seq 2 | awk 1 [22:52:49]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	shbot	[22:52:51] Riviera: one [22:52:51]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	shbot	[22:52:51] Riviera: two [22:52:51]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:52:59] epequeno: so, well, I believe your question is answered? :) [22:52:59]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	epequeno	[22:53:43] yes I think so, but negative values are truthy in awk? [22:53:43]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	epequeno	[22:53:53] setting it to -1 instead does the same thing [22:53:53]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	epequeno	[22:53:58] but 0 doesn't work [22:53:58]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:54:41] epequeno: 0 counts as false, and the empty string does [22:54:41]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	epequeno	[22:54:59] ok, so when we match the first regex, we set some value to true then evaluate it the next record doesn't have to match the regex as x is still set to 1 and we'll continue to print to EOF [22:54:59]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:55:46] epequeno: correct [22:55:46]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	epequeno	[22:56:19] ok thank you, while that makes the first example make sense now `/^t/,0` makes less sense [22:56:19]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:57:02] agreed :) [22:57:02]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	medi	[11:31:18] i want to match a character to the last character in a field. can i use indexing to access the last character of a field? [11:31:18]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	medi	[11:36:48] decided on substr method [11:36:48]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	xpt	[11:49:36] printf %s\\n  an and | awk '$1 ~ /n$/' [11:49:36]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	xpt	[11:49:39] # printf %s\\n  an and | awk '$1 ~ /n$/' [11:49:39]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	shbot	[11:49:41] xpt: an [11:49:41]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	xpt	[11:49:51] medi: ^ I'd use regexp for that [11:49:51]

2016-09-21 19:07:00	epequeno	[22:49:26] when the regex matches, we set a var to 1, at the end, we use that 1, somehow that tells awk to keep printing to the EOF [22:49:26]

2016-09-21 19:07:00	epequeno	[22:53:53] setting it to -1 instead does the same thing [22:53:53]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	epequeno	[22:53:58] but 0 doesn't work [22:53:58]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	Riviera	[22:54:41] epequeno: 0 counts as false, and the empty string does [22:54:41]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	epequeno	[22:54:59] ok, so when we match the first regex, we set some value to true then evaluate it the next record doesn't have to match the regex as x is still set to 1 and we'll continue to print to EOF [22:54:59]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	Riviera	[22:55:46] epequeno: correct [22:55:46]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	epequeno	[22:56:19] ok thank you, while that makes the first example make sense now `/^t/,0` makes less sense [22:56:19]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	Riviera	[22:57:02] agreed :) [22:57:02]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	medi	[11:31:18] i want to match a character to the last character in a field. can i use indexing to access the last character of a field? [11:31:18]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	medi	[11:36:48] decided on substr method [11:36:48]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	xpt	[11:49:36] printf %s\\n  an and | awk '$1 ~ /n$/' [11:49:36]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	xpt	[11:49:39] # printf %s\\n  an and | awk '$1 ~ /n$/' [11:49:39]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	shbot	[11:49:41] xpt: an [11:49:41]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	xpt	[11:49:51] medi: ^ I'd use regexp for that [11:49:51]

2016-09-22 00:23:53	izalove	[15:42:12] nope [15:42:12]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	_Raiz	[15:43:11] dammit [15:43:11]

2016-09-22 00:23:53	_Raiz	[15:58:54] xpt, good idea [15:58:54]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	epequeno	[22:44:38] I don't understand how {q=1}q is working here: https://gist.github.com/epequeno/f08a8779e52609a6584a8aac9449bc45 [22:44:38]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:46:45] epequeno: Do you have any idea, any guess? [22:46:45]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	epequeno	[22:49:26] when the regex matches, we set a var to 1, at the end, we use that 1, somehow that tells awk to keep printing to the EOF [22:49:26]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	epequeno	[22:50:15] which behaves the same way as '/^t/,0' somehow [22:50:15]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:50:18] epequeno: Do you know you can not only use regexes as conditions?  Also things like [22:50:18]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:50:27] epequeno: awk 'NR > 3 { print }' [22:50:27]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:50:39] epequeno: ? [22:50:39]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	epequeno	[22:50:43] sure [22:50:43]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:50:49] epequeno: now let's do the following [22:50:49]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:50:54] epequeno: awk 'q { print }' [22:50:54]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:51:09] epequeno: That's quite similar to the NR > 3 thing before, isn't it? [22:51:09]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	epequeno	[22:51:15] yes [22:51:15]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Camusensei	[22:51:31] _Raiz: awkshift (){ [[ $1 != *[!0-9]* && $1 != '' ]] || return 1;awk -v n=$1 '{for (i=n+1;i<=NF;i+=1) $(i-n)=$i; newNF=NF-n; if (newNF > 0) NF=newNF; else NF=0}1';} [22:51:31]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:51:37] epequeno: "print the current record when q is true", right? [22:51:37]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	epequeno	[22:51:52] yes that makes sense [22:51:52]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:52:09] epequeno: we can omit { print }, because that's the default action when no action is given, [22:52:09]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:52:27] epequeno: so "awk q" would print its input if q were true [22:52:27]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	epequeno	[22:52:36] right... [22:52:36]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:52:42] epequeno: of course "q" is not true, because it's initialised as 0, but we could test that with [22:52:42]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[22:52:45] epequeno: awk 1 [22:52:45]

2016-09-23 03:23:58	eoli3n	hi
2016-09-23 03:24:56	eoli3n	i have a continuus flux on stdin comming to awk, i want to tail -f file | awk -F "." '{ system("dialog --gauge test 100 100 "$1) }'
2016-09-23 03:25:17	eoli3n	problem is that dialog system call is executed just when i ctrl+c
2016-09-23 03:25:46	eoli3n	or the tail "finish" (it's not really a tail, cause i'm using other thing, but that's for the exemple)
2016-09-23 03:26:05	eoli3n	how to tell to awk to execute systemcall at each new line on stdin ?
2016-09-23 03:26:23	linedash	check you don't have a blank line at the end of your input
2016-09-23 03:26:27	eoli3n	i tried mawk with -W interactive which did not made work
2016-09-23 03:26:50	izalove	try   stdbuf -oL tail -f file
2016-09-23 03:26:59	eoli3n	i already use it izalove
2016-09-23 03:27:04	eoli3n	but at the top of my line

2016-09-23 03:27:17	geirha	tail -f does not buffer
2016-09-23 03:27:17	eoli3n	linedash: i dont think cause if i juste print $1, it works
2016-09-23 03:27:26	eoli3n	15:20:26     eoli3n | or the tail "finish" (it's not really a tail, cause i'm using other thing, but that's for the exemple)

2016-09-23 03:28:48	eoli3n	tha'ts a python script which output line like these one
2016-09-23 03:29:04	eoli3n	i dont get what you mean so ?
2016-09-23 03:29:40	geirha	ah, I guess gauge probably reads stdin to move the bar somehow
2016-09-23 03:29:51	eoli3n	it does and  ?
2016-09-23 03:30:01	eoli3n	if i do :
2016-09-23 03:30:18	geirha	so question is what awk does with system()'s stdin
2016-09-23 03:30:25	eoli3n	for i in {1..100};do dialog --gauge 100 100 $i; sleep 1; done, it works
2016-09-23 03:30:38	geirha	really? you run 100 dialog instances?
2016-09-23 03:30:43	eoli3n	nop
2016-09-23 03:30:45	eoli3n	i pgreped it
2016-09-23 03:30:49	eoli3n	ah
2016-09-23 03:30:53	eoli3n	no sorry bad example
2016-09-23 03:30:55	eoli3n	you're right
2016-09-23 03:31:12	eoli3n	for i in {1..100};do echo $i; sleep 1; done | dialog --gauge test 100 100 0
2016-09-23 03:31:31	geirha	so ... you don't really want awk at all probably
2016-09-23 03:31:39	eoli3n	i need cause
2016-09-23 03:31:56	eoli3n	dialog $2 --gauge test 100 100 $1
2016-09-23 03:32:12	geirha	$2?

2016-09-23 03:32:22	eoli3n	where $1 = 15
2016-09-23 03:32:33	eoli3n	$2 rest of the line
2016-09-23 03:32:40	eoli3n	in dialog comment
2016-09-23 03:32:50	eoli3n	not really $2 but the rest of the line
2016-09-23 03:33:08	eoli3n	i dont know how to tell that to awk, everything exept $1
2016-09-23 03:33:10	geirha	so you want to read the first line, then pass the rest to dialog
2016-09-23 03:33:18	eoli3n	nop
2016-09-23 03:33:55	geirha	surely 15.5 is the percentage, else your awk makes no sense
2016-09-23 03:33:56	eoli3n	for each new line, parse the line to send $1 which is in percent progress bar, to dialog numeric value, and the reste of the line to dialog's comment
2016-09-23 03:34:12	eoli3n	geirha: dialog dont has . values
2016-09-23 03:34:17	eoli3n	just 15 works
2016-09-23 03:35:28	eoli3n	so for now, just want to understand why system just execute my dialog line if i cancel the process
2016-09-23 03:35:41	eoli3n	s/system/awk system call
2016-09-23 03:36:40	eoli3n	is there any hack with fflush() ?
2016-09-23 03:37:10	geirha	... | gawk -F '{pct=int($1); sub(/[^ ]*/,""); printf("XXX\n%d\n%s\n",pct, $0); fflush()}' | dialog --gauge test 100 100
2016-09-23 03:37:20	eoli3n	wow !!
2016-09-23 03:37:46	eoli3n	nop
2016-09-23 03:37:49	eoli3n	dont work
2016-09-23 03:37:59	geirha	oops, left the -F in there
2016-09-23 03:38:04	geirha	... | gawk '{pct=int($1); sub(/[^ ]*/,""); printf("XXX\n%d\n%s\n",pct, $0); fflush()}' | dialog --gauge test 100 100
2016-09-23 03:38:30	geirha	maybe there should be a closing XXX too
2016-09-23 03:38:33	eoli3n	near but, percent keeps stay at 0
2016-09-23 03:38:39	geirha	the manual is a bit vague on that part
2016-09-23 03:38:53	eoli3n	comment part is working
2016-09-23 03:38:59	eoli3n	but % gauge not
2016-09-23 03:38:59		[03:38]
2016-09-23 03:39:15	eoli3n	it works
2016-09-23 03:39:18	geirha	are you sure the first whitespace separated word of the line is the percentage?
2016-09-23 03:39:29	eoli3n	but it refresh each second to print 30% then 0% etc
2016-09-23 03:39:41	eoli3n	it is not
2016-09-23 03:39:48	eoli3n	i need to cut .5 from 15.5
2016-09-23 03:39:57	eoli3n	cause dialog just use entire num

2016-09-23 03:40:42	geirha	yeah, needs the closing XXX

2016-09-23 03:41:19	eoli3n	your line is hard to understand for me ^^ i cannot modify it

2016-09-23 12:21:00	eoli3n	[14:16:56] i dont know how to printf with this ? [14:16:56]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	geirha	[14:17:04] multiple lines, like the awk did ... [14:17:04]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	geirha	[14:17:20] haven't you read about --gauge in man dialog yet? [14:17:20]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	geirha	[14:17:31] It explains how it treats stdin [14:17:31]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eoli3n	[14:17:49] hm [14:17:49]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eoli3n	[14:17:51] stdbuf -o0 python2.7 murder_client_dsed.py peer /net/dspackages/xenial-3/deploy.torrent /tmp/torrent.out 10.5.99.42 | gawk '{pct=int($1); sub(/[^ ]*/,""); printf(pct, $0); fflush()}' | dialog --gauge deploy 100 100 [14:17:51]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eoli3n	[14:17:56] this is not working, but i check the man [14:17:56]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eoli3n	[14:18:21] sprunge.us/fUgg [14:18:21]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eoli3n	[14:18:26] http://sprunge.us/fUgg [14:18:26]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	geirha	[14:18:46] drop the awk... [14:18:46]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	geirha	[14:19:14] also, you can use python's -u switch instead of stdbuf [14:19:14]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	geirha	[14:23:42] and next up, you can probably find some python module that can output a progress bar similar to dialog via pip [14:23:42]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	geirha	[14:24:14] anyway, I'm off. *poof* [14:24:14]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eoli3n	[14:24:20] python -u is working [14:24:20]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eoli3n	[14:24:22] thx a lot [14:24:22]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	go|dfish	[14:50:01] tqdm is the module used for the progress bar [14:50:01]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	crucialrhyme	[15:02:50] how weird/complicated would it be to implement awk (or a useful subset)? like as a side project for someone who has half-remembered knowledge of undergrad compilers but not much actual PL implementation experience [15:02:50]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	izalove	[15:03:35] i wrote an awk that can interpret like 80-90% of the scripts [15:03:35]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	izalove	[15:04:16] https://gist.github.com/izabera/05d34f3179c7c9bcffdb3dbfa9f9c940 [15:04:16]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	crucialrhyme	[15:04:52] ok that definitely convinces me to give it a shot [15:04:52]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	izalove	[15:05:01] no that was a joke [15:05:01]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	crucialrhyme	[15:05:08] oh i see [15:05:08]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	crucialrhyme	[15:05:20] i should probably read this code more carefully [15:05:20]

2016-09-23 12:21:00	hawkbot	[15:07:51] CS Classic and essential reference: "The Awk Programming Language" (Aho, Kernighan and Weinberger, 1988) is highly recommended | http://awk.freeshell.org/FIXES [15:07:51]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	crucialrhyme	[15:08:05] ok at the line or character level this probably does support 90% of all awk scripts ever written lol [15:08:05]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	izalove	[15:08:10] crucialrhyme: ^ there's a parser example in that book [15:08:10]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	crucialrhyme	[15:08:24] but like could i hit 90% of all unique awk scripts, i wonder, in a reasonable amount of effort [15:08:24]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	crucialrhyme	[15:08:31] thanks i will take a look [15:08:31]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	Jinxed-win	[16:28:21] Is there a quick way to subtract arrays in bash using awk? [16:28:21]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	izalove	[16:28:39] what does subtracting array mean? [16:28:39]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	Jinxed-win	[16:31:44] I have a sorted list of values, and I am trying to find the closest two values... so bash is too slow to itterate through the values, I have a fast sorting method... so I figured there may be a quick way to take two arrays subtract them and then find the min of the result [16:31:44]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	@mute	[16:40:47] i think there's a bash faq about that [16:40:47]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	izalove	[16:45:12] Jinxed-win: how would you do it in c++? [16:45:12]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	Jinxed-win	[16:47:46] I figured out a solution... it just is really weird... more of bash related will post in bash [16:47:46]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eolien	[18:02:06] hi, i didn't thank the guy which help me today, with this dialog menu pb [18:02:06]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eolien	[18:02:24] it was on another computer so i cant get his name [18:02:24]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eolien	[18:03:13] but biggest thx dude, it wasn't a awk pb and you spent some time for me, i got it finally, it works now, exactly as i want, without awk :) [18:03:13]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	Riviera	[18:06:05] eolien: I believe that was geirha? [18:06:05]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eolien	[18:06:15] it was him [18:06:15]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	eolien	[18:06:19] high five geirha !! [18:06:19]
2016-09-23 12:21:00	jeffreylevesque	[20:19:47] i'd like to check use awk to check if a redirected string contains a substring [20:19:47]
