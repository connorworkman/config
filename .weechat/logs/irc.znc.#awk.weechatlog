2016-09-16 05:29:21	fcolista	This is a CSV (is longer, but the format is like this):
2016-09-16 05:29:21	fcolista	SNOM Model 820,<%CHANGEME%>,FreeLine,00AABBCCDDEE,,,,,,,,1234,"Name, Surname Number",,false,,false,,false,,,Description

2016-09-16 05:30:07	fcolista	http://pastebin.com/KKDbLNRH
2016-09-16 05:30:18	fcolista	What i need to do is adding, after "Name, Surname Number" or Name, Surname Room Number a country code, let's say USA.
2016-09-16 05:30:26	fcolista	So, that field should become:
2016-09-16 05:30:33	fcolista	"Name, Surname Number USA" and Name, Surname Room Number USA. Maybe with double quotes, but it is not important.
2016-09-16 05:30:40	fcolista	As far as i understand, i need to figure out first a patter that matches the field, and then add USA.
2016-09-16 05:30:40	fcolista	Can someone help me with that? Thanks.

2016-09-16 05:39:18	fcolista	Name, Surname and Room are different
2016-09-16 05:39:26	fcolista	It's the actual name, surname and room
2016-09-16 05:39:34	fcolista	thx for the reply go|dfish
2016-09-16 05:39:46	go|dfish	oh right
2016-09-16 05:39:50	fcolista	sorry if i'm not explained correctly
2016-09-16 05:39:51	go|dfish	heh
2016-09-16 05:39:59	fcolista	i need to iterate that
2016-09-16 05:40:34	go|dfish	hmmm, so, some lines are "broken" and some are not
2016-09-16 05:40:37	fcolista	i'm looking for a way to do that, but i've not figuret iet
2016-09-16 05:40:44	fcolista	go|dfish, correct.
2016-09-16 05:41:22	fcolista	what is consistent, though, are the 4 digits before what i need to change
2016-09-16 05:41:24	fcolista	so
2016-09-16 05:41:25	fcolista	1234
2016-09-16 05:41:28	fcolista	and 5678
2016-09-16 05:41:53	fcolista	those are unique and they are in all the lines
2016-09-16 05:42:02	fcolista	this is what i'd like to exploit
2016-09-16 05:47:18	go|dfish	fcolista: well, in those 2 examples you can count on the name being $13 and the surname room number being $14
2016-09-16 05:47:32	go|dfish	so you could do something horrible like: awk -F, -v OFS=, '$13 !~ /^"/ { $13 = "\"" $13 } { sub (/"$/, "", $14); $14 = $14" USA\""; print }'
2016-09-16 05:49:11	fcolista	:)
2016-09-16 05:49:29	go|dfish	could put it all into the sub() i suppose: { sub (/"?$/, " USA\"", $14); print
2016-09-16 05:49:41	fcolista	i cannot count on Field Number
2016-09-16 05:50:03	go|dfish	{{terz}}
2016-09-16 05:50:07	fcolista	:)
2016-09-16 05:50:15	fcolista	i told you that was not that easy :)
2016-09-16 05:50:41	go|dfish	so what can you count on? it being the field after "the first field that is just all digits"?
2016-09-16 05:50:53	fcolista	correct.
2016-09-16 05:51:31	fcolista	and consider that the next field (the one i want to modify)
2016-09-16 05:51:31		[05:51]
2016-09-16 05:51:47	go|dfish	well, you can loop through to find it, for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) if ($i ~ /^[0-9]+$/) i-found-u

2016-09-16 06:02:17	fcolista	this put a double quote in all the fields
2016-09-16 06:02:57	fcolista	but this breaks the count of the field
2016-09-16 06:03:32	fcolista	anyway
2016-09-16 06:03:51	fcolista	it's interesting for learning
2016-09-16 06:04:12	fcolista	care to explain me how does it work? If you can and/or have time
2016-09-16 06:04:23	fcolista	OFS= set the field separator
2016-09-16 06:04:31	fcolista	than you have a counter
2016-09-16 06:05:07	fcolista	NF is number of field
2016-09-16 06:05:19	fcolista	so in the variable i
2016-09-16 06:05:35	go|dfish	fcolista: yes, so for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) is a way to loop through all the field numbers
2016-09-16 06:05:44	fcolista	each time it matches the pattern /^[0-9]+$/
2016-09-16 06:05:46	go|dfish	so when i = 1, $i is $1 i.e. field 1

2016-09-16 06:10:35	fcolista	very interesting
2016-09-16 06:11:01	fcolista	I suppose thie can be optimized by a better pattern matching regexp
2016-09-16 06:11:06	fcolista	*this
2016-09-16 06:11:33	go|dfish	well, i thought you wanted to "fix" the "broken" lines by adding the double quotes back in

2016-09-16 06:12:00	fcolista	you're right go|dfish, but this alters the number of fields in the CSB

2016-09-16 06:12:16	go|dfish	oh right, yes, that's true

2016-09-16 17:31:59	nal	specifically this part is a little upsetting "The implementation of user-defined functions was a compromise. The chief difficulties arose from the initial design of awk. We did not have, or want, declarations in the language. One result is the peculiar way of declaring local variables as extra formal parameters. Besides looking strange, this is error prone in large programs."

2016-09-16 17:38:50	ttmrichter	Well I solve that issue by not using Awk for large programs.

2016-09-17 13:27:33	drgeb	rods-tab3 that prints the current line

2016-09-17 13:27:48	yitz	What's "next"?
2016-09-17 13:27:50	drgeb	which did  not work
2016-09-17 13:28:21	yitz	"The next statement forces awk to immediately stop processing the current record and go on to the next record. This means that no further rules are executed for the current record, and the rest of the current rule’s action isn’t executed.
2016-09-17 13:28:33	drgeb	here is the input file http://termbin.com/6ujc

2016-09-17 13:28:52	drgeb	so I need to search for oracle.retail.stores.foundation.tour.engine.PseudoSite.arrive\(PseudoSite.java:19
2016-09-17 13:28:54	yitz	Are you sure you want to do "next"?
2016-09-17 13:29:11	drgeb	when I see this I want the next line which can be either
2016-09-17 13:29:34	yitz	Did you read what "next" does?
2016-09-17 13:31:30	drgeb	i think next is for loops
2016-09-17 13:32:19	drgeb	Thanks yitz!!!
2016-09-17 13:32:41	yitz	Do you see a loop anywhere?
2016-09-17 13:33:06	drgeb	Thanks rods-tab3 I was all over the place and not simply calmly reading I guess I want to get this done to quickly and it takes time to learn and understand
2016-09-17 13:33:32	rods-tab3	yes
2016-09-17 13:36:56	drgeb	i now need to store a variable, is there a good site I should ue overall for learning this
2016-09-17 13:37:09	yitz	var = "foo"
2016-09-17 13:37:13	yitz	See the topic
2016-09-17 13:37:22	drgeb	problem is I don’t have lots of time on Monday I am flying to the csutomer
2016-09-17 13:37:49	yitz	You could show a sample input and sample desired output and someone may feel like writing awk for you
2016-09-17 13:38:55	drgeb	Thanks yitz go to play with this construct and see if I can store the result in my first search pattern and display this when it hits my next search pattern

2016-09-17 13:52:34	drgeb	the output looks funky    Letter:"Failure"OldSite: AuthorizationStation. NewSite: TenderingInfoUI
2016-09-17 13:53:03	yitz	You need spaces around variable names
2016-09-17 13:53:17	yitz	Or, rather, around strings you want to join
2016-09-17 13:56:01	drgeb	in the doc it says Strings are concatenated by being adjacent: hw = "hello" "world"  x to "helloworld".  Watch out; this often has surprising properties.
2016-09-17 13:56:01		[13:56]
2016-09-17 13:56:34	drgeb	but I am concatenating while performing a print
2016-09-17 13:57:33	yitz	Strings are concatenated with a " " (space)
2016-09-17 13:57:50	yitz	You can try doing the same thing over and hoping for change or you can believe what you're being told
2016-09-17 14:03:00		[13:57]
2016-09-17 14:04:56	drgeb	:)
2016-09-17 14:06:02	drgeb	I think my newsite variable is funky it contains maybe the newline and this is causing the issue
2016-09-17 14:12:00		[14:06]
2016-09-17 14:20:55	yitz	You mean a carriage return (\r)?
2016-09-17 14:22:55	drgeb	yes
2016-09-17 14:25:17	drgeb	i decided to print each assignment separately and seems ok except Letter: "Failure" contains double quotes so my regexp is not correct where I have
2016-09-17 14:25:42	drgeb	 /BusDriver\ for\ service\ .*\ is\ processing\ \".*\"/ { letter=$7; print "****" letter }
2016-09-17 14:26:28	drgeb	and I have the \” .* \” so i thought it would not make letter be assigned with the double quotes
2016-09-17 14:27:10	drgeb	my output looks like ****"FinalLetter"
2016-09-17 14:27:10		[14:27]
2016-09-17 14:27:20	drgeb	and not ***FinalLetter

2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:28:52] so I need to search for oracle.retail.stores.foundation.tour.engine.PseudoSite.arrive\(PseudoSite.java:19 [23:28:52]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:28:54] Are you sure you want to do "next"? [23:28:54]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:29:11] when I see this I want the next line which can be either [23:29:11]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:29:34] Did you read what "next" does? [23:29:34]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:31:30] i think next is for loops [23:31:30]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:32:19] Thanks yitz!!! [23:32:19]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:32:41] Do you see a loop anywhere? [23:32:41]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:33:06] Thanks rods-tab3 I was all over the place and not simply calmly reading I guess I want to get this done to quickly and it takes time to learn and understand [23:33:06]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	rods-tab3	[23:33:32] yes [23:33:32]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:36:56] i now need to store a variable, is there a good site I should ue overall for learning this [23:36:56]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:37:09] var = "foo" [23:37:09]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:37:13] See the topic [23:37:13]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:37:22] problem is I don’t have lots of time on Monday I am flying to the csutomer [23:37:22]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:37:49] You could show a sample input and sample desired output and someone may feel like writing awk for you [23:37:49]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:38:55] Thanks yitz go to play with this construct and see if I can store the result in my first search pattern and display this when it hits my next search pattern [23:38:55]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	rods-tab3	[23:43:48] !concise [23:43:48]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	hawkbot	[23:43:49]  concise:  http://cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr15/cos333/awk.help [23:43:49]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:44:10] Nice [23:44:10]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:49:23] :) [23:49:23]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:50:05] eek [23:50:05]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:50:14] i updated the code to http://termbin.com/3gej [23:50:14]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:50:56] defined my variables in BEGIN [23:50:56]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:51:28] but then when i say to:            print " Service: "service" OldSite: "oldsite" NewSite: "newsite" Letter:"letter [23:51:28]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	*buffextras	[23:52:20] oliverio!~oliverio@unaffiliated/oliverio joined [23:52:20]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:52:34] the output looks funky    Letter:"Failure"OldSite: AuthorizationStation. NewSite: TenderingInfoUI [23:52:34]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:53:03] You need spaces around variable names [23:53:03]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:53:17] Or, rather, around strings you want to join [23:53:17]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:56:01] in the doc it says Strings are concatenated by being adjacent: hw = "hello" "world"  x to "helloworld".  Watch out; this often has surprising properties. [23:56:01]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[23:56:34] but I am concatenating while performing a print [23:56:34]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:57:33] Strings are concatenated with a " " (space) [23:57:33]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[23:57:49] You can try doing the same thing over and hoping for change or you can believe what you're being told [23:57:49]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:04:56] :) [00:04:56]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:06:02] I think my newsite variable is funky it contains maybe the newline and this is causing the issue [00:06:02]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	yitz	[00:20:55] You mean a carriage return (\r)? [00:20:55]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:22:55] yes [00:22:55]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:25:17] i decided to print each assignment separately and seems ok except Letter: "Failure" contains double quotes so my regexp is not correct where I have [00:25:17]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:25:42]  /BusDriver\ for\ service\ .*\ is\ processing\ \".*\"/ { letter=$7; print "****" letter } [00:25:42]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:26:27] and I have the \” .* \” so i thought it would not make letter be assigned with the double quotes [00:26:27]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:27:09] my output looks like ****"FinalLetter" [00:27:09]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	drgeb	[00:27:19] and not ***FinalLetter [00:27:19]

2016-09-17 14:53:48	yitz	Yes. The " is treated like any other character in the string
2016-09-17 14:53:56	yitz	You can use gsub() to remove them

2016-09-17 17:35:24	yitz	drgeb: the regex just says if the line matches or not. It doesn't modify the line or the value of $7
2016-09-17 17:36:27	drgeb	I finally got it to work using reverse psychology or reverse expression
2016-09-17 17:36:41	drgeb	so instead of \”(.*)\”
2016-09-17 17:37:00	drgeb	i used v

2016-09-17 17:38:48	drgeb	:) Okie Dokie!!!
2016-09-17 17:38:55	drgeb	Thanks yitz!!!
2016-09-17 17:39:11	yitz	There's good approaches and bad approaches which are learned with experience
2016-09-17 17:39:26	yitz	(Which is what I said 4 hours ago)

2016-09-17 17:50:38	drgeb	with awk are there expressions for parsing words

2016-09-17 18:00:30	drgeb	Can’t figure it out again
2016-09-17 18:00:38	drgeb	I have to parse the string
2016-09-17 18:00:38	drgeb	      BusDriver changes site within InitializeSale service. Old site was CheckAccountability. New site is OperatorIdStation
2016-09-17 18:00:42	drgeb	I have
2016-09-17 18:01:06	drgeb	 /BusDriver changes site within .* service. Old site was ([^\.]*)\. New site is .*/
2016-09-17 18:01:57	drgeb	its greedy and grabbing the period for the string I am interested in at $10
2016-09-17 18:05:55	yitz	awk splits on whitespace
2016-09-17 18:06:24	yitz	You can change the field separator but it defaults to whitespace. So the 10th entry is CheckAccountability.
2016-09-17 18:06:50	yitz	You can use gsub again to strip any '.' from $10
2016-09-17 18:07:13	yitz	val = sub(/\.$/, "", $10)

2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[03:35:24] drgeb: the regex just says if the line matches or not. It doesn't modify the line or the value of $7 [03:35:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:36:27] I finally got it to work using reverse psychology or reverse expression [03:36:27]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:36:41] so instead of \”(.*)\” [03:36:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:37:00] i used v [03:37:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:37:02] \"([^\"]*)\"/ [03:37:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:37:45] oopsy control v paste  messed me up :) but 45 minutes lost for just something this simple and crazy in writting expressions [03:37:45]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[03:38:25] drgeb: Next time try sharing your input line and sample output and ask someone to show how to best achieve it :P [03:38:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:38:48] :) Okie Dokie!!! [03:38:48]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:38:55] Thanks yitz!!! [03:38:55]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[03:39:11] There's good approaches and bad approaches which are learned with experience [03:39:11]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[03:39:26] (Which is what I said 4 hours ago) [03:39:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:50:15] :) [03:50:15]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[03:50:38] with awk are there expressions for parsing words [03:50:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:00:29] Can’t figure it out again [04:00:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:00:38] I have to parse the string [04:00:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:00:38]       BusDriver changes site within InitializeSale service. Old site was CheckAccountability. New site is OperatorIdStation [04:00:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:00:42] I have [04:00:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:01:06]  /BusDriver changes site within .* service. Old site was ([^\.]*)\. New site is .*/ [04:01:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:01:57] its greedy and grabbing the period for the string I am interested in at $10 [04:01:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[04:05:55] awk splits on whitespace [04:05:55]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[04:06:24] You can change the field separator but it defaults to whitespace. So the 10th entry is CheckAccountability. [04:06:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[04:06:50] You can use gsub again to strip any '.' from $10 [04:06:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[04:07:13] val = sub(/\.$/, "", $10) [04:07:13]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:24:57] nope getting a 1 [04:24:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:24:59] http://termbin.com/cqny [04:24:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:25:18] so it keeps printing OldSite: 1 [04:25:18]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	nal1	[04:27:02] the hell is var? [04:27:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[04:27:23] ? [04:27:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	nal1	[04:28:35] drgeb: ? [04:28:35]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	nal1	[04:29:18] drgeb: thats not how you set variables [04:29:18]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	yitz	[04:31:07] My bad. var = $10; sub(/\.$/, "", var) [04:31:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	drgeb	[05:56:10] well i got my inital picture [05:56:10]

2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[03:35:24] drgeb: the regex just says if the line matches or not. It doesn't modify the line or the value of $7 [03:35:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:36:27] I finally got it to work using reverse psychology or reverse expression [03:36:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:36:41] so instead of \”(.*)\” [03:36:41]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:37:00] i used v [03:37:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:37:02] \"([^\"]*)\"/ [03:37:02]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:37:45] oopsy control v paste  messed me up :) but 45 minutes lost for just something this simple and crazy in writting expressions [03:37:45]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[03:38:25] drgeb: Next time try sharing your input line and sample output and ask someone to show how to best achieve it :P [03:38:25]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:38:48] :) Okie Dokie!!! [03:38:48]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:38:55] Thanks yitz!!! [03:38:55]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[03:39:11] There's good approaches and bad approaches which are learned with experience [03:39:11]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[03:39:26] (Which is what I said 4 hours ago) [03:39:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:50:15] :) [03:50:15]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[03:50:38] with awk are there expressions for parsing words [03:50:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:00:29] Can’t figure it out again [04:00:29]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:00:38] I have to parse the string [04:00:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:00:38]       BusDriver changes site within InitializeSale service. Old site was CheckAccountability. New site is OperatorIdStation [04:00:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:00:42] I have [04:00:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:01:06]  /BusDriver changes site within .* service. Old site was ([^\.]*)\. New site is .*/ [04:01:06]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:01:57] its greedy and grabbing the period for the string I am interested in at $10 [04:01:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[04:05:55] awk splits on whitespace [04:05:55]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[04:06:24] You can change the field separator but it defaults to whitespace. So the 10th entry is CheckAccountability. [04:06:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[04:06:50] You can use gsub again to strip any '.' from $10 [04:06:50]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[04:07:13] val = sub(/\.$/, "", $10) [04:07:13]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:24:57] nope getting a 1 [04:24:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:24:59] http://termbin.com/cqny [04:24:59]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:25:18] so it keeps printing OldSite: 1 [04:25:18]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	nal1	[04:27:02] the hell is var? [04:27:02]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[04:27:23] ? [04:27:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	nal1	[04:28:35] drgeb: ? [04:28:35]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	nal1	[04:29:18] drgeb: thats not how you set variables [04:29:18]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[04:31:07] My bad. var = $10; sub(/\.$/, "", var) [04:31:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[05:56:10] well i got my inital picture [05:56:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	drgeb	[05:56:24] not sure how I can post this so you can see it [05:56:24]

2016-09-18 13:24:36	yitz	[06:55:27] Followed by a cross posted question... [06:55:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[10:00:28] I should change my nick since this val thing is higlighting my name. [10:00:28]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[10:00:31] where can I complain? [10:00:31]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[10:00:46] ^^ [10:00:46]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	Riviera	[10:08:14] the IRC committee [10:08:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:08:45] lol Riviera [11:08:45]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:09:15] It's werid because my nich still has those underscores but anyways I don't think anyone cres. [11:09:15]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:09:20] cares even. [11:09:20]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	Riviera	[11:16:08] Since you are anyway mostly not active in IRC, at least as far as I can tell, I think you yourself don't care too much. :) [11:16:08]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:20:35] Riviera: I am quite often on irc. Just observing and learning from ccleintelligent people. [11:20:35]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:21:01] jesus. This lag is annoying [11:21:01]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	Riviera	[11:21:32] Did you try mosh? [11:21:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:23:28] Riviera: you mean the "Mobile Shell" ? [11:23:28]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	Riviera	[11:24:33] yup! [11:24:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	_val_	[11:26:11] I am using irssi in a screen session(which runs at work). I think the connection from home to work is wanky. [11:26:11]
