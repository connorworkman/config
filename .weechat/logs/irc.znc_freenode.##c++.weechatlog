2016-10-17 12:44:05	blueyed	I am trying to hack rxvt-unicode's code, and would like to extend "char **env = environ" to append/overwrite an existing entry for execle.
2016-10-17 12:44:40	blueyed	Can I append something to an array of pointers?  Should I take care to remove an existing entry for the same env var?
2016-10-17 12:45:37	Eelis	you sound like you're in way over your head. are you actually interested in learning C++, or just in getting a quick fix?

2016-10-17 12:53:12	klys	then you have a few more problems and will have to obscure how you do it (which is just as complex) internally.
