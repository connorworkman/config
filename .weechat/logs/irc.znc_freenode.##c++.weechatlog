2016-10-17 13:15:44	w3z	well it depends on the type of the object, if its pod, and has no padding, you can simply use it as an effective type in the buffer via a cast (the legallity of doing so in std c++ is eh), alternatively you can placement new it in to the buffer, assuming proper alignment .... otherwise, you have to copy the data from the buffer in to your new object instance
2016-10-17 13:16:43	w3z	there is no difference between a class and struct type in c++ other than default public access to members and public inheritance

2016-10-17 14:55:53	davidstone	And `f` has an overload that is specialized on nullptr to be deleted
2016-10-17 14:55:58	davidstone	Or provide some other sort of error mechanism

2016-10-17 14:57:00	davidstone	I guess that's actually a slightly separate issue

2016-10-17 14:58:29	davidstone	If you overloaded its constructor to static_assert or be deleted for nullptr_t, that catches some bugs

2016-10-17 14:58:59	Eelis	so that logic leads to atrocities
2016-10-17 14:59:16	davidstone	The 'real' solution is to use a better type for string literals

2016-10-17 15:03:42	Eelis	and those analyses can be all the wonderful flow analysis stuff and whatnot, and actually catch some meaningful cases

2016-10-17 15:51:40	JazzBot	Hey everyone, my professor tasked us to find the maximum spanning tree from a matrix. I think I got it figured out but failing to compile the code. I'm trying to pass in a vector of a class by reference to moddify. What I have fails to compile on line 39 because "use '&' to create a pointer to member. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. http://pastebin.com/bjEa1CsQ
