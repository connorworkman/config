2016-10-17 13:15:44	w3z	well it depends on the type of the object, if its pod, and has no padding, you can simply use it as an effective type in the buffer via a cast (the legallity of doing so in std c++ is eh), alternatively you can placement new it in to the buffer, assuming proper alignment .... otherwise, you have to copy the data from the buffer in to your new object instance
2016-10-17 13:16:43	w3z	there is no difference between a class and struct type in c++ other than default public access to members and public inheritance

2016-10-17 14:55:53	davidstone	And `f` has an overload that is specialized on nullptr to be deleted
2016-10-17 14:55:58	davidstone	Or provide some other sort of error mechanism

2016-10-17 14:58:59	Eelis	so that logic leads to atrocities
2016-10-17 14:59:16	davidstone	The 'real' solution is to use a better type for string literals

2016-10-17 15:03:42	Eelis	and those analyses can be all the wonderful flow analysis stuff and whatnot, and actually catch some meaningful cases

2016-10-17 18:08:26	w33	what function like memcpy was there that allowed the two buffers to overlap?

2016-10-17 18:10:50	w33	thanks
2016-10-17 18:11:36	w33	ptr_1 and ptr_1 overlaps in memcpy(ptr_1,ptr_1, num);. Is that okay? It's basically a NOP?
2016-10-17 18:11:44	ubsan	it's fine

2016-10-17 18:11:49	ubsan	although it won't be a NOP

2016-10-17 18:12:33	w33	ubsan: it won't?
2016-10-17 18:12:34	medgno	isn't memcpy with overlapping memory undefined?
2016-10-17 18:12:49	ubsan	w33: I mean like, it'll still do the copy
2016-10-17 18:12:56	ubsan	even though it's equivalent to a NOP
2016-10-17 18:13:00	ubsan	so sloooowness
2016-10-17 18:13:47	Moto-chan	If you pass in equal pointers, they do overlap, therefore the behaviour is unsigned.
2016-10-17 18:13:53	Moto-chan	For memcpy anyway
2016-10-17 18:14:13	chrisf	undefined, perhaps.
2016-10-17 18:14:34	Moto-chan	Lol, yes
2016-10-17 18:14:35	Moto-chan	Typo

2016-10-17 18:15:36	w33	right

2016-10-17 21:03:33	nolyc	[06:21:21] Did you know that member functions of a local class shall be defined inline in their class definition, if they are defined at all? [06:21:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	Moto-chan	[06:21:49] w3z: Careful! Someone may think that guy is you at a glance! [06:21:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	xaxxon	[06:24:06] a "did you know" "yes/no" interview question.   I want to interview there [06:24:06]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	xaxxon	[06:24:23] though I guess it could be a trick questino [06:24:23]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	w3z	[06:24:39] can you explain why if you prefer ..... because local function definitions are not allowed [06:24:39]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	w3z	[06:25:31] even retards want to be like mike [06:25:31]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	Moto-chan	[06:25:34] They're inline inside the class definition because it'd be pretty silly if they weren't :3 [06:25:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	w3z	[06:26:47] (though jordan references are sort of dated now, dunno if retards want to be like lebron though) [06:26:47]

2016-10-17 21:03:33	nolyc	[06:27:17] When does it matter that the member functions whose names end in _until take an argument that specifies a time point? [06:27:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	w3z	[06:27:56] when you want to specify a timeout ... [06:27:56]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	w3z	[06:28:51] !interview [06:28:51]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	nolyc	[06:28:53] Do you often dream about the fact that a class that declares or inherits a virtual function is called a polymorphic class? [06:28:53]

2016-10-17 21:03:33	fiveflowerzz	[07:02:27] How to know when (in which cases)   mytype x;    automatically assigns it to a zero value? [07:02:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	fiveflowerzz	[07:02:52] i.e. for which types are we sure, in C++03, that it is automatically zero when defining it ? [07:02:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	velco	[07:02:52] mytype x{}; [07:02:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	fiveflowerzz	[07:03:21] velco: can you explain? [07:03:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	velco	[07:03:23] "mytype x;" is default initialized; if there is no ctor it won;t be initialized [07:03:23]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	***	Playback Complete.
2016-10-17 21:03:54	velco	in contrast, "mytype x{};" will be zeroed if there is no ctor

2016-10-18 00:14:20	V-ille	[09:06:50] casting the vectors won't [09:06:50]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	xaxxon	[09:06:53] Waynes, the vectors aren't compatible [09:06:53]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	xaxxon	[09:07:08] the data inside them may be, but you cannot pass it to something that wants a vector of the other type [09:07:08]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	V-ille	[09:07:28] you need to get a span type from the future [09:07:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	xaxxon	[09:07:28] you can't even change the constness of the element type [09:07:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	Waynes	[09:08:22] ok, but thanks anyway [09:08:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	AbleBacon	[09:08:52] the irony is that 'char' and 'unsigned char' could actually be stored identically on your system [09:08:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	xaxxon	[09:09:38] AbleBacon, but can they be stored ironically? [09:09:38]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	ville	[09:09:50] so what's the deal with ranges, spans and views? lot of it seems to be just naming the same thing differently? [09:09:50]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	ville	[09:12:11] what's the relation between the three? some sort of hierarchy or more like a venn diagramm with some overlap? [09:12:11]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	w3z	[09:21:00] <<i,S::v; struct S{static int v; int f(int x=S::v){return x;}}; int i=S{}.f(); int g(){return 42;}  int S::v=g(); //contrived dynamic init brokenness [09:21:00]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	geordi	[09:21:01] 0, 42 [09:21:01]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	AbleBacon	[09:21:58] why would you ever want to 'union' an 'int' and a 'float'? [09:21:58]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:22:31] because some people think they are allowed to read the bit representation of a float that way [09:22:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:22:42] but that doesn't make sense with plain int, so i dunno [09:22:42]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	bumbar	[09:22:43] i'm getting undefined reference to template member function inside a nested class. function is specialized and defined in the header file, http://ideone.com/TJz3bP [09:22:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:23:33] !give bumbar testcase [09:23:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	nolyc	[09:23:34] bumbar: A testcase is the _least_ amount of code that replicates your problem, paste it to http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com and give us the link. Do _not_ paste code to the channel. See the testcase checklist at http://eel.is/iso-c++/testcase/ [09:23:34]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:23:47] bumbar: that doesn't reproduce whatever error you are seeing [09:23:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	AbleBacon	[09:24:00] yeah... in fact, it seems to be running fine... [09:24:00]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	bumbar	[09:24:47] urdh, it's split across multiple files [09:24:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	dminuoso_	[09:25:02] AbleBacon: There could be plenty reasons. One obvious could be that you're implementing a variant type, then a union is a great place to start. [09:25:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:25:10] bumbar, use wandbox then [09:25:10]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:25:18] http://melpon.org/wandbox/ [09:25:18]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	w3z	[09:25:50] hah someone broke clangs stdlib on wandbox, tsk tsk [09:25:50]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:26:22] lol wtf [09:26:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:27:03] only Clang HEAD though [09:27:03]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	dminuoso_	[09:27:28] Will a union always align the data according to the type with the largest alignment requirement? [09:27:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	w3z	[09:27:31] including string or iostream, seems to lead to conflicting definitions of swap errors, though they look the same in the error text [09:27:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:27:51] that's what you get when you don't have gated commits with good regression tests [09:27:51]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	w3z	[09:28:18] it was probably EricWF's fault :) [09:28:18]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:29:33] dminuoso_, http://eel.is/c++draft/class.union#2 [09:29:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:29:39] so, uh, "maybe"? [09:29:39]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:30:48] i can't read standardese, but it sounds like it has to since all members share address [09:30:48]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	dminuoso_	[09:32:04] Are such notes normative? [09:32:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	dminuoso_	[09:32:19] (I thought that notes without exceptions are non-normative in ISO) [09:32:19]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:32:42] well, they are I suppose [09:32:42]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:32:59] but check what the note refers to as well [09:32:59]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	bumbar	[09:33:36] urdh, i can't reproduce it, but the structure is the same, http://melpon.org/wandbox/permlink/xe0IOV0ufAsedldw [09:33:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	dminuoso_	[09:34:21] urdh: I wonder if two union members are considered to be layout compatible then. [09:34:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	dminuoso_	[09:34:59] That according to [basic.compound] would mean that a pointer to each would hvae the same alignment. [09:34:59]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	dminuoso_	[09:35:40] urdh: Ohhh [expr.static.cast] is the key. [09:35:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	dminuoso_	[09:35:59] urdh: [...] If the original pointer value represents the address A of a byte in memory and A does not satisfy the alignment requirement of T, then the resulting pointer value is unspecified. Otherwise, if the original pointer value points to an object a, and there is an object b of type T (ignoring cv-qualification) that is pointer-interconvertible ([basic.compound]) with a, the result is a pointer to b. [09:35:59]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	dminuoso_	[09:36:05] [...] [09:36:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	dminuoso_	[09:36:44] urdh: And according to iso http://www.iso.org/schema/isosts/v1.1/doc/n-6ew0.html notes are indeed without exception non-normative. [09:36:44]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	elsewho	[09:45:59] hi, how can i deduce the type of a lambda expression C++11, or is it depending on the compiler implementation? [09:45:59]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	velco	[09:47:54] just like you deduce othre types: pass the lambda to a function template [09:47:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	w3z	[09:48:16] how old fashioned :) [09:48:16]

2016-10-18 00:19:49	AStorm	compiler says something cryptic like: error: use of 'decltype(auto) makeEventHandler(const char*, const string&)' before deduction of 'auto'

2016-10-18 00:20:33	AStorm	because the use is as parameter to a function with clearly defined type
2016-10-18 00:20:44	klys	if you're using auto you should replace it with the type you mean

2016-10-18 00:22:04	AStorm	yes, but the lambda type is special

2016-10-18 05:55:23	S4nD3r	I have an image (gray). Then, I need to mark, using a line, the part of image that I want the algorithm segment (the segmentation is based on the similarity of pixels. The segmentation is working properly.  What I need to do, is store the mark (that line that I did) and use it again to repeat the same simulation sometimes

2016-10-18 06:45:44	micros	does anyone know how to post a linux user input key event for KEY_VOLDOWN/UP where the input type is EV_REL?  when i do this, no event is processed under android.  If i use EV_KEY, it works OK, but this is not suitable for a rotary knob which provides only a relative offset when its turned.

2016-10-18 23:55:20	destiny	[08:30:51] it's the target of boost right ? [08:30:51]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	urdh	[08:30:52] pulling in boost for just a tribool is horrible [08:30:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	destiny	[08:31:03] oh ? [08:31:03]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	TinoDidriksen	[08:31:20] No it isn't, just use Boost. [08:31:20]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	destiny	[08:31:24] ok :) [08:31:24]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	urdh	[08:31:47] if you're just using the tribool, pulling in boost which is freakin' huge is probably not the best solution [08:31:47]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	urdh	[08:31:58] unless you're using boost for other stuff as well [08:31:58]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	urdh	[08:32:11] (for some definition of "best") [08:32:11]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	destiny	[08:32:13] yes for vector stuff like that [08:32:13]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	destiny	[08:32:28] anyway still better than our "local type" provided by some ugly middleware in our app [08:32:28]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	guest100	[09:00:16] Can we use enum class enumerators as cases in switch statement?? [09:00:16]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	Eelis	[09:00:33] sure [09:00:33]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	urdh	[09:01:20] that's the whole point [09:01:20]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	AStorm	[09:05:25] here's a fun question: what's the recommended way to default initialize struct fields? just adding braces involves removing aggregate initialization, how can I get that behavior back easily? [09:05:25]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	AStorm	[09:06:20] is there some sort of syntax for default list initialization constructor? [09:06:20]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	AStorm	[09:08:42] I see this part about "no default member initializers" has been changed in C++14 [09:08:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	AStorm	[09:08:52] hmm, it seems that piece of code was C++11 [09:08:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	AStorm	[09:08:57] time to change some flags. [09:08:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	AStorm	[09:10:22] hmm, it seems I've hit a bug in gcc 4.9? [09:10:22]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	AStorm	[09:14:02] hmm, might be enum class members interfering [09:14:02]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	Drzacek	[09:15:24] Hi [09:15:24]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	Drzacek	[09:15:34] I can't define structs as volatile? [09:15:34]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	va	[09:15:56] what good would that do [09:15:56]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	va	[09:16:26] geordi: { struct z { int f; }; volatile struct z x; } [09:16:26]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	geordi	[09:16:26] <no output> [09:16:26]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	AStorm	[09:17:25] http://melpon.org/wandbox/permlink/5uaVh0pFDVooRxQR <- GCC 4.9 bug, yes? (GCC 5.1 and clang 3.8 accept it in C++14 mode, GCC 4.9 rejects in C++1y) [09:17:25]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	Drzacek	[09:17:52] geordi: { typedef volatile struct { int f; }mystruct; } [09:17:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	geordi	[09:17:53] <no output> [09:17:53]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	urdh	[09:18:18] I would presume that c++14 support is incomplete if you use c++1y [09:18:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	AStorm	[09:18:34] urdh: allegedly GCC 4.9 supports this part of C++14 [09:18:34]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	AStorm	[09:18:42] probably the status page is lying [09:18:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	urdh	[09:18:45] so calling it a "bug" would be arguably incorrect [09:18:45]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	urdh	[09:18:51] probably that, then [09:18:51]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	AStorm	[09:18:54] no, never mind [09:18:54]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	AStorm	[09:19:09] it explicitly says 5 in Member initializers and aggregates [09:19:09]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	urdh	[09:19:18] there you go :) [09:19:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	AStorm	[09:19:21] ok, so how can I emulate this behavior with the ancient C++11 compiler? [09:19:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	AStorm	[09:19:35] need what constructors? [09:19:35]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	AStorm	[09:21:02] probably default move, copy and plain constructor; and an initializer_list constructor [09:21:02]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	AStorm	[09:21:40] or is it a constructor with all the fields I need? (yuck but ok) [09:21:40]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	AStorm	[09:29:50] hmm, the latter. it is not fun, pity I get to live with this old compiler. [09:29:50]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	AStorm	[09:31:17] this involves making a simple struct implement all rule of 7 [09:31:17]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	AStorm	[09:31:24] (fortunately default) [09:31:24]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lloda	[09:31:42] the lack of int/complex ops in std::complex is a major pain in the ass :-/ [09:31:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	bumbar	[09:36:09] why do i have to type template when calling a template member function in a function to which i pass the parameter? eg: void f(const Objec& o) { o.template call<int>(); } [09:36:09]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	systemfault	[09:39:43] bumbar: Is Object a tmplate parameter? [09:39:43]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	bumbar	[09:39:56] yes [09:39:56]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	systemfault	[09:43:14] Then it's normal, Object::call is a dependent name and you need template to disambiguate that <> are not the < or > operators [09:43:14]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	systemfault	[09:43:18] bumbar: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/dependent_name#The_template_disambiguator_for_dependent_names [09:43:18]

2016-10-19 01:45:16	dminuoso_	Eelis: Fair enough. I mean it seems like I can get the same effect by just placing the function as a static member function of an otherwise empty class and make that class a template classi nstead.

If I could rule out any exceptions being thrown from the timer (which only consists of a ref init, copy init of a timepoint, timepoint-timepoint, copy assignemnt of the resulting duration and two calls to clock_type::now(), which actually is noexcept for standard clocks),
2016-10-19 03:13:55	SlashLife	I could give the same noexcept guarantee as the original function. Which is just a minor detail, but would be a nice touch.

2016-10-19 03:53:40	SlashLife	And yes, returning the string would be the sensible thing to do. If you want to overwrite your encoded thing with the decoded one, message = decode(message); is much more natural than decode(message, message).
2016-10-19 03:54:04	urdh	interop_madness: to be clear, my objection to the API is that in != out unneccesarily narrows the contract and means the caller has to do a bunch of extra work (copying, since in == out seems to be a common case) that you could just as well do inside decode()

2016-10-19 03:54:42	interop_madness	SlashLife, but on a higher level, would you, given decode(string input, string& output), change the API to decode(const string& input, string& output) and ensure that the old usage with both parameters passed as the same variable still works, or would you, given cases of said usage, not touch it at all?

2016-10-19 03:56:20	SlashLife	interop_madness: I'd actually go and refactor the places that use the two parameter thing. I'd take input as a const&, not as a value. And if you really really can't get to all the places that use this two parameter style, then you can still write a wrapper: inline void decode(const string &in, string &out) { out = decode(in); }
2016-10-19 03:56:29	urdh	it's not just "the old use", it's the fact that the precondition in != out has to be documented and followed even though it is a completely unnececsary precondition

2016-10-19 09:48:34	M-ou-se	Lenore: it's not quite the same. you have a constructor that takes any number of any type, and then checks if it was int. it'll fail if you pass things like char or float, even though those would implicitly convert for a real (int, int, int, int, int) constructor.

2016-10-19 14:34:37	Moto-chan	[20:57:31] There's quite a bit of non-conformance, and most of them don't even come with C compilers, just C++. [20:57:31]

2016-10-19 14:34:37	disgrntld	[21:38:19] Hey guys, so if back_inserter works to create iterator-like objects where assignments have been overloaded to instead result in push_backs, it seems like if the inequality operator was also overloaded to always report true, I could use them to simulate arbitrarily long ranges (http://melpon.org/wandbox/permlink/usGjADEOuzfhVy3W). Is this the best way to emulate a `generate_until`? [21:38:19]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	disgrntld	[21:39:13] I guess it would be cleaner to just write the generate_until algorithm as opposed to trying to make some new iterator abstraction-thingie [21:39:13]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	disgrntld	[21:40:02] I just had a gut feeling it might be useful in other range manipulation algorithms [21:40:02]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	SlashLife	[21:48:13] disgrntld: I'd rather wrap that insert_iterator to be able to count - or make a pair of fibonacci generating iterators and use std::copy to an insert_iterator. [21:48:13]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	SlashLife	[21:49:09] Oh, you could actually use std::copy_n instead of an iterator pair. [21:49:09]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	disgrntld	[21:53:01] ok, lemme compare and contrast [21:53:01]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	disgrntld	[21:53:25] this is just me relearning C++ and knocking off cruft in my knowledge [21:53:25]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	disgrntld	[21:53:33] cool feedback Slashlife, thanks [21:53:33]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Smirnov	[22:28:07] after you return from std::call_once is it guaranteed that that Callable has already finished executing (e.g. if another thread was *actually* executing it) ? [22:28:07]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Smirnov	[22:28:38] I think that's what "No invocation in the group returns before the abovementioned execution of the selected function is completed successfully, that is, doesn't exit via an exception." is saying but just wanted to double check [22:28:38]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	skirmisha	[22:36:41] hi [22:36:41]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	skirmisha	[22:38:29] i have simple question, what is break doing in the code? it is going to next code or? [22:38:29]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	SlashLife	[22:48:11] Smirnov: That's how I'd understand it as well: http://www.eelis.net/c++draft/thread.once.callonce#3 [22:48:11]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	SlashLife	[22:50:12] If you return (not throw), then that will be the last (and likely first) active execution; all others will be passive executions - which synchronize with the last active execution. [22:50:12]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	tertu	[00:11:07] generally, if i have a const int, the compiler will just put that in as a literal wherever it's used, right? [00:11:07]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	TinoDidriksen	[00:12:43] If you have a constexpr int, yes. [00:12:43]

2016-10-19 20:40:01	KrzaQ	[05:48:40] sure, in this case it is pointless, but let's make it a set<T*, less<>> [05:48:40]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	KrzaQ	[05:48:49] or a map with pointer being a key [05:48:49]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	ERROH	[05:49:03] So, maybe have a set<T*, my_less> ? [05:49:03]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	KrzaQ	[05:49:43] the point is, set<T*, less<>> is perfectly fine [05:49:43]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	KrzaQ	[05:50:03] set<pair<T, U*>, less<>> silently breaks because pair uses < for comparisons [05:50:03]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	ERROH	[05:50:23] Yeah, that's were I meant to replace std::less with your less. [05:50:23]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	KrzaQ	[05:50:24] and hence my original question: can I make it use less<>? [05:50:24]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	KrzaQ	[05:50:52] I'd rather not implement it on my own, but if I must... [05:50:52]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	ERROH	[05:51:06] As I said, you doing it the other way around. [05:51:06]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	KrzaQ	[05:52:11] hm, since less<T> is the default comparator for maps/sets [05:52:11]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	KrzaQ	[05:52:36] it means set<T*> is ok, but set<pair<T,U*>> is not (minus same object/array case) [05:52:36]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	urdh	[05:54:36] comparing pointers from different objects is not UB, it's just unspecified [05:54:36]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	urdh	[05:55:06] and std::less has a specialization for void* that guarantees a total ordering even if operator< doesn't [05:55:06]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	urdh	[05:55:20] so you could store a void*, but that's a bit ugly [05:55:20]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	KrzaQ	[05:55:42] is that you're supposed to interpret this? I didn't know [05:55:42]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	KrzaQ	[05:55:43] http://eel.is/c++draft/expr.rel#3 [05:55:43]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	KrzaQ	[05:56:07] it states where it is defined, so it was pretty clear to me that any other situations are not defined [05:56:07]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	urdh	[05:56:47] check the very next paragraph [05:56:47]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	KrzaQ	[05:57:14] the next paragraph relies on the comparison being defined [05:57:14]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	urdh	[05:57:48] well, kind of not [05:57:48]

2016-10-20 06:21:11	chris64	Oxyd: I have a type Type<T1, T2> with T1 being specialized and T2 having a default. For T1 there are two specializations defined. If someone uses this type without T2 it should be this default. T2 is used to specialize members.
2016-10-20 06:21:28	thinlizzy	jj96, also that is C code. this is a C++ channel, so you will be better server in ##C

2016-10-20 11:04:32	vaskozl	It is not in C++ but rather assembly.
2016-10-20 11:04:46	vaskozl	I have to multiply all odd numbers up to given n aka 1*3*5...*n
2016-10-20 11:04:49	vaskozl	With only addition.
2016-10-20 11:04:59	vaskozl	I'm not a computer science student, just an engineer.
2016-10-20 11:05:03	vaskozl	So I've done this.
2016-10-20 11:05:28	vaskozl	But as an extra challenge we can compute one who can get the best times for values of n from 1000 to 1999
2016-10-20 11:05:50	vaskozl	From what I understand the complexity of doing this with two loops (one adding, one incrementing) is n^2
2016-10-20 11:05:57	vaskozl	Is there any way to optimise it?

2016-10-20 11:40:29	patson	hi, I find myself in a bit of an architectural pickle: I'm trying to create a base template that declares a function 'iterator()' that should return an iterator object. Unfortunately, while the iterator API doesn't change, the implementation details (like member data) does change between objects using the base class.

2016-10-21 00:54:02	M-ou-se	Earthnail: the memory layout of std::vector<char[5]> is just like char[][5]. the chars are all directly after each other. no extra indirection.
2016-10-21 00:54:10	Eelis	w3z: basically constexpr just isn't what it sounds like for pointers
2016-10-21 00:54:18	Earthnail	M-ou-se: fancy. Never used std::array before (I'm more at home in Python land, with the occasional C or C++).

2016-10-21 00:54:56	M-ou-se	Earthnail: std::array<T, N> is just a simple wrapper for T[N]. it makes it slightly easier to use it, since it has members like .begin() and .end() and .size(), and you can threat it like a normal object.
2016-10-21 00:55:01	Bigcheese	Umm, now I worry about if we can implement the small string optimization with this.
2016-10-21 00:55:03	Bigcheese	Maybe not...
2016-10-21 00:55:10	Earthnail	M-ou-se: do I get performance penalties by not being aligned on 8-byte boundaries, potentially leading to cache misses, when using char[5] instead of a uint64_t/char[8] and then simply only reading 5 of the 8 bytes?
2016-10-21 00:55:10	va	Bigcheese: which is intentional, because asking for a cast is wrong
2016-10-21 00:55:31	Bigcheese	Indeed. The point is that you can't do things with pointers that observe their address.
2016-10-21 00:55:35	Bigcheese	Across objects.
2016-10-21 00:55:55	va	Earthnail: implementation defined

2016-10-21 00:56:17	M-ou-se	Earthnail: well, if you want to access the Nth string, it's going to multiply N by 5 to get the right offset in memory. multiplying by eight is often faster, depending on your platform. x86 even supports multiplying by eight in the same instruction that does the indexing/access.
2016-10-21 00:56:33	M-ou-se	Earthnail: you should try it out, and benchmark it.
2016-10-21 00:56:37	va	x86's LDA can also multiply by 5
2016-10-21 00:57:41	M-ou-se	Earthnail: very old diagram for x86: http://www.c-jump.com/CIS77/asm_images/generating_32_bit_address.png
2016-10-21 00:57:57	Eelis	Bigcheese: it would still be worthwhile for std::vector and such
2016-10-21 00:58:11	Eelis	even if std::string's SSO hackery keeps it non-constexpr
2016-10-21 00:58:24	M-ou-se	multiply by five can be done as [eax * 4 + eax], though.
2016-10-21 00:58:25	va	hm, 5 is not included. Well I'll be damned

2016-10-21 00:59:13	Bigcheese	well, it depends on how it's implemented I guess. if you reuse the size and capacity pointers as data.
2016-10-21 00:59:15	Earthnail	M-ou-se: when benchmarking, anything I need to be aware of, i.e. prevent the compiler from optimising to heavily? Do I have to check the generated assembly, or are there common pitfalls I should avoid when doing a microbenchmark like this?

2016-10-21 00:59:46	Bigcheese	from 2015
2016-10-21 01:00:08	M-ou-se	Earthnail: depends what you exactly want to benchmark. in the end, you only care about the overall performance of you application, right? just compile two versions, one with char[8] and one with char[5], and check which one runs better.

2016-10-21 01:53:36	TheSchaf	esp. when 0 is a valid addr.
2016-10-21 01:53:51	TheSchaf	because then you never notice things returning NULL (and having no check)

2016-10-21 01:55:16	Eelis	you're already responsible for avoiding invalid use of pointers without expecting the benefit of segfaults
2016-10-21 01:55:25	Eelis	since you don't get those for other invalid pointers that happen to point to mapped addresses
2016-10-21 01:55:58	klys	#ifndef __NULL_H /*;*/ #define __NULL_H /*;*/ #define NULL ( ( void* )0 ) /*;*/ #endif
2016-10-21 01:56:02	Eelis	so "i really really want segfaults specifically for NULL" just sounds like you're not using the right tools to avoid/detect invalid use of pointers in the first place
2016-10-21 01:56:30	Eelis	consider using valgrind and addrsanitizer and such
2016-10-21 01:56:39	TheSchaf	i was not in that position at that time
2016-10-21 01:56:54	TheSchaf	i debugged software written years ago because i moved it to another platform (without having source access)
2016-10-21 01:57:06	TheSchaf	and it turned out the platform i moved it from had 0 mapped and the devs forgot checks in several places
2016-10-21 01:57:31	Eelis	again, sounds like there were much deeper problems there than something to do with NULL
2016-10-21 01:57:47	TheSchaf	well, there was calls like strtok(NULL, ...)
2016-10-21 01:57:58	TheSchaf	which worked "fine" on the first platform by accident

2016-10-21 01:58:13	Eelis	the deeper problem being that you're trying to debug C++ programs without source code
2016-10-21 01:58:55	TheSchaf	well but if the devs back then had nullptr instead of NULL, none of this would have happened

2016-10-22 02:20:53	KrzaQ	if your class has an inline destructor
2016-10-22 02:21:02	KrzaQ	it need unique_ptr pointer's complete type
2016-10-22 02:21:12	KrzaQ	so define your destructor in a .cpp file
2016-10-22 02:21:17	noizex	and if it hasn't?
2016-10-22 02:21:27	noizex	I have classes that don't have it defined and they cause the same error

2016-10-22 02:21:46	KrzaQ	then only the destructor (and assignment operators) need it
2016-10-22 02:21:46	noizex	I should just do ~Foo() in .h then Foo::~Foo() = default; ?
2016-10-22 02:22:03	KrzaQ	yes, implicitly created destructor is inline
2016-10-22 02:22:03	KrzaQ	yes
2016-10-22 02:22:38	noizex	so, whenever I have class Foo that uses unique_ptr of class, say, A & B and I forward declare them
2016-10-22 02:22:40	M-ou-se	noizex: T needs a definition, not just a declaration, for unique_ptr<T>. that's all.

2016-10-22 02:23:19	noizex	ok think I got it
2016-10-22 02:23:40	noizex	it provides default constructor in a unit that actually uses that class, right?

2016-10-22 02:23:42	M-ou-se	the class/struct definition is required, not the destructor definition or a definition of any other member
2016-10-22 02:23:47	noizex	and if there is no #include of that class there, it borks
2016-10-22 02:23:58	noizex	so I need to force it to define dtor in that unit where I actually have the complete type?
2016-10-22 02:24:01	noizex	does it make sense?
2016-10-22 02:24:10	KrzaQ	yes
2016-10-22 02:24:12	M-ou-se	no
2016-10-22 02:24:43	noizex	I'd make a case but no idea how to simulate several files in ideone or something
2016-10-22 02:25:07	M-ou-se	it doesn't matter where the destructor is defined. the class needs to be defined, the member functions don't need to be defined at tha tpoint.
2016-10-22 02:25:21	KrzaQ	M-ou-se, I think you misunderstand
2016-10-22 02:25:22	noizex	yeah but this is not about the class that becomes unique_ptr
2016-10-22 02:25:27	M-ou-se	noizex: try http://melpon.org/wandbox
2016-10-22 02:25:29	noizex	but the one that has member
2016-10-22 02:25:35	noizex	thats unique_ptr with forward decl
2016-10-22 02:25:44	KrzaQ	if Bar aggregates unique_ptr<Foo>

2016-10-22 02:26:32	noizex	need to make some note about it, I have some deja vu I once went through this thing
2016-10-22 02:26:37	M-ou-se	so declare the destructor it in the header file, and define it in a source file that does have the full class definition of T

2016-10-22 07:46:42	catern	ville: ...obviously you'd need to do the same thing as std::vector i.e. use .size() to get the size and .data() to get the data pointer
2016-10-22 07:46:49	catern	oh, I guess nevermind about being POD
2016-10-22 07:47:31	catern	I can't just have some of my fields be std::vectors because then I won't be contiguous in memory anymore
2016-10-22 07:47:32	SlashLife	catern: Well, you could basically do the thing you do in C for lists.
2016-10-22 07:47:37	ville	catern: oh i thought you wanted it in one contiguous block

2016-10-22 07:48:15	SlashLife	struct node_head { node_head *next; };, then instead of malloc()ing sizeof(node_head), you'd malloc() sizeof(node_head) + sizeof(payload)
2016-10-22 07:48:28	ville	catern: well the two things are at odds. one contiguous block and variable size.
2016-10-22 07:48:46	catern	ville: no they aren't, std::vector has both just fine
2016-10-22 07:48:58	ville	catern: to satisfy the latter you need one layer of indirection
2016-10-22 07:49:26	w3z	or a max size and a size indicator
2016-10-22 07:49:38	ville	catern: vector is not one contiguous block. its data is contiguous sure but it's sort of in two blocks. the object it self and the data block.

2016-10-22 07:49:57	w3z	you dont seem to be aware of it

2016-10-22 14:02:26	litb	(i copied this code from my archive...)
2016-10-22 14:03:06	litb	iirc, because the c++03 rules simply says that the two using declarations conflict. but if you remove them, the lookup rule only sees one "f"

2016-10-22 16:43:33	ejay	Hi all. Is 'Thinking in C++" by Bruce Eckel is still a good book for someone who wants to learn some cpp? I remember reading this couple years ago (like 10yo actually) and really liked it. Desktop programming is more of a hobby for me, jumped into PHP and working in web dev but I want to refresh some of my cpp. Maybe there is a new, better book I can read. Cheers.

2016-10-22 16:45:47	SlashLife	ejay: I don't know it, but I'd expect that while it will still be valid and solid, it wouldn't be recommended anymore. C++11 has changed a lot, also for beginners. C arrays and raw pointers (should) have become much less common and not part of a C++ beginners teaching anymore (imo).

2016-10-22 22:21:33	MyPrecious	anyway, my real question is, my program needs to ask for input(1-2) but user can give me inputs as string, in that case it shouldnt crash and ask for input again. how do I check it. I tried int temp; if(cin >> temp) and it worked for 2 letter strings but when I go try 3 or more like n times, the code flows without asking for input (n-1) times.

2016-10-23 04:45:12	Erlkoenig	and the C# one neither
2016-10-23 04:45:34	Erlkoenig	if you wanted to interface with a mysql DB, it would be clear that the mysql datatype would be sufficient to represent all your numbers
2016-10-23 04:45:38	ThorinTheDwarf	I have checked the mysql doc, it is what I need..
2016-10-23 04:45:56	Erlkoenig	but since your appliation is some else unknown thing, nobody knows whether the mysql one is sufficient
2016-10-23 04:45:59	ThorinTheDwarf	sure

2016-10-23 09:10:09	nolyc	Code should not have access to things it does not need access to. This way, it cannot mess those things up or come to depend upon them by accident. Member functions have access to class internals. Hence, if a function does not need access to class internals, and does not need to be a member for other reasons, it should not be a member.
2016-10-23 09:10:14	Eelis	that's pretty general
2016-10-23 09:10:24	Tachyon_	I see
2016-10-23 09:10:29	Moto-chan	Well, the way I do it is... Implement assignment operators inside the class.
2016-10-23 09:10:39	M-ou-se	the standard library violates that principle quite often, though
2016-10-23 09:10:41	Moto-chan	Then make operator+ and other binary ops as free functions

2016-10-23 10:10:53	Oxyd	Perhaps it is for when you're implementing a custom allocator or something, and have size_t allocated_so_far;. You'll then want to round allocated_so_far up to the nearest multiple of alignof(T) when allocating storage for a T. Having them both be the same type sure sounds nice. Not sure if this is the rationale behind choosing size_t, though.

2016-10-23 13:52:47	medgno	In your constructor (and setNext) you probably want to be taking a pointer, not a reference.
2016-10-23 13:53:03	medgno	Ideally, you'd use smart pointers, but this looks like data structures homework, so you probably have to use raw pointers

2016-10-23 13:56:14	medgno	I believe what your professor was saying is a combination of a few points:
2016-10-23 13:56:27	medgno	1. When you are taking a reference but don't plan on modifying it, you should make it const
2016-10-23 13:56:48	medgno	2. If you want to have virtual functions work when working with an object, it needs to be stored in a pointer or a reference
2016-10-23 13:57:09	medgno	3. When you are taking parameters to functions that don't need to make a copy, it should be by (const) reference

2016-10-23 13:57:48	medgno	Based on just the function names and the way that this code is meant for a linked list, I can't imagine these functions taking const references instead of pointers
2016-10-23 13:58:12	noizex	and the actual error, he's probably doing setNext(nullptr)
2016-10-23 13:58:33	medgno	right, which if setNext took a pointer, would be a completely valid way to indicate the end of the list
2016-10-23 13:59:18	medgno	but since your functions take a reference, there is no way for these functions to take a parameter that indicates the absence of an object

2016-10-23 17:05:45	w3z	Because facets are used by iostreams, potentially while static constructors are running, their initialization cannot depend on programmed static initialization. One initialization strategy is for locale to initialize each facet’s id member the first time an instance of the facet is installed into a locale. This depends only on static storage being zero before constructors run (3.6.2). — end note ]

2016-10-23 17:10:40	medgno	so then it would be something like template<class T> Base: Parent<T> {Base(): Parent<T>(10, 20) { } }
2016-10-23 17:11:08	medgno	I'd love to see that since I must admit I haven't an idea how this plays in with inheritance
2016-10-23 17:11:25	w3z	we're talking about the injected name
2016-10-23 17:11:41	w3z	the base itself is not injected
2016-10-23 17:12:15	medgno	oh, so then something like class Base<T>: public enable_shared<Base<T>> { }, right?

2016-10-23 19:10:45	Immune	I kinda know what you're saying when findnumber is counting and if it is 0 than it should cout no matches
2016-10-23 19:10:46	crazy_pete	make sure that find number has the proper number of arge
2016-10-23 19:11:00	crazy_pete	yes findNumber returns the number of finds
2016-10-23 19:11:09	crazy_pete	if 0== findNumber(wahtever correct args)
2016-10-23 19:11:13	crazy_pete	then no matches

2016-10-23 19:11:43	Immune	do I need to add &count inside the functions?

2016-10-23 19:12:30	crazy_pete	no it returns it , immune

2016-10-23 19:12:54	crazy_pete	but per the comments (which i guess are yer teachers)  you need to store  the found locations in the FindNumber function
2016-10-23 19:13:05	crazy_pete	but your problem now is that it doesnt output the match failure
2016-10-23 19:13:08	crazy_pete	try this

2016-10-24 02:06:10	dminuoso_	Whenever it can schedule two threads of the same process consecutively, it can avoid the really costly TLB flush penalty.
2016-10-24 02:06:27	dminuoso_	And improve cache behavior
2016-10-24 02:06:46	dminuoso_	(Assuming there's any shared data/code)
2016-10-24 02:06:53	va	well if you have multiple cores, and pin threads to cores, there should not be a TLB flush either, since you never switch tasks
2016-10-24 02:06:58	Eelis	localuser-: yes, having multiple threads update the same data is bad for the cache.
2016-10-24 02:07:37	dminuoso_	va: I dont think "pinning a thread to a core" will give it exclusive access to that core, will it?
2016-10-24 02:07:54	va	dminuoso_: there has been a lot of talk in the Linux area to force exactly that exclusivity

MSVC complains about explicitly specializion and if I see msdn page it says that I somehow specialized it two times. http://pastebin.com/3TXTaEGd on line 102. may you please have a look at it ?

2016-10-24 22:59:37	Olipro	[06:36:07] you want the returned string to be read only? [06:36:07]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	AmR|EiSa	[06:36:14] yes [06:36:14]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	Olipro	[06:36:19] static const string name(); [06:36:19]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	Olipro	[06:37:01] adding "const" after the function's param declaration is only valid for instance methods (functions) [06:37:01]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	Olipro	[06:38:38] your method is static, so it is not an instance method [06:38:38]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	AmR|EiSa	[06:38:42] I got one difference about " static const string name(); " But I need to know more about " static string name() const; "  I don't get it? [06:38:42]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	nf7	[06:38:46] Can someone recommend to me a C++ textbook that is as up to date as possible? [06:38:46]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	Olipro	[06:39:05] it is ill-formed [06:39:05]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	Olipro	[06:39:16] it is not valid and will not compile [06:39:16]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	doppel	[06:39:36] the const modifies this to be const T*. [06:39:36]

2016-10-24 22:59:37	Olipro	[06:40:19] placing const *after* the function parameters is used to declare an instance method that can be used from a const instance of the object [06:40:19]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	nf7	[06:40:43] TommyC: Nothing happened. [06:40:43]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	AmR|EiSa	[06:41:11] Olipro: Got it. [06:41:11]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	Olipro	[06:41:57] as an additional note, it's considered good practice that const instance methods should be thread-safe [06:41:57]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	AmR|EiSa	[06:51:13] Can I have " string name(); " And " name() const; " ? [06:51:13]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	AmR|EiSa	[06:51:32] Can I have " string name(); " And " string name() const; " ? [06:51:32]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	TommyC	[06:54:54] AmR|EiSa: As member functions of a class? Yes. [06:54:54]

2016-10-24 22:59:37	TommyC	[06:55:44] AmR|EiSa: Then yes. Their signatures are different. [06:55:44]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	AmR|EiSa	[06:57:31] And if I def Const object from class what I can from them ? [06:57:31]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	AmR|EiSa	[06:57:47] And if I def Const object from class what I can call from them ?* [06:57:47]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	TommyC	[06:58:25] If I understood you correctly, you can call other const member functions from them. [06:58:25]

2016-10-24 22:59:37	dminuoso_	[07:01:32] Well, or "less trivial C++ questions" ;-) [07:01:32]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	dminuoso_	[07:01:44] Because technically his question was fairly standard related.. [07:01:44]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	TommyC	[07:02:02] Did you just assume that person's gender? :3 [07:02:02]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	dminuoso_	[07:03:39] Yes, and since I usually always use "they" I'm allowed to do it every now and then. [07:03:39]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	varuntv	[07:22:17] Getting these errors on compiling "ignoring attributes on template argument uint64_t" [07:22:17]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	varuntv	[07:22:55] why does it say ignoring attributes? [07:22:55]

2016-10-24 22:59:37	geordi	[07:25:52] warning: ignoring attributes on template argument 'foo {aka int}' [07:25:52]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	dminuoso_	[07:26:24] It should not be anything to worry about, unless you assume that attributes would somehow have an effect on types. [07:26:24]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	varuntv	[07:28:20] but uint64_t is define in cstdint? did you mean to say its not simple typedef from int but have attribute also associated with it? [07:28:20]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	dminuoso_	[07:29:06] varuntv: It appears so. [07:29:06]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	dminuoso_	[07:30:03] varuntv: Perhaps its an alignment attribute? [07:30:03]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	dminuoso_	[07:30:22] Either way, its a GCC extension and thus outside the scope of this channel. [07:30:22]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	varuntv	[07:33:30] dminuoso, okay thanks [07:33:30]

2016-10-24 23:19:13	Olipro	[06:36:07] you want the returned string to be read only? [06:36:07]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	AmR|EiSa	[06:36:14] yes [06:36:14]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	Olipro	[06:36:19] static const string name(); [06:36:19]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	Olipro	[06:37:01] adding "const" after the function's param declaration is only valid for instance methods (functions) [06:37:01]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	Olipro	[06:38:38] your method is static, so it is not an instance method [06:38:38]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	AmR|EiSa	[06:38:42] I got one difference about " static const string name(); " But I need to know more about " static string name() const; "  I don't get it? [06:38:42]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	nf7	[06:38:46] Can someone recommend to me a C++ textbook that is as up to date as possible? [06:38:46]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	Olipro	[06:39:05] it is ill-formed [06:39:05]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	Olipro	[06:39:16] it is not valid and will not compile [06:39:16]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	doppel	[06:39:36] the const modifies this to be const T*. [06:39:36]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	TommyC	[06:39:53] nf7: !books [06:39:53]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	Olipro	[06:40:19] placing const *after* the function parameters is used to declare an instance method that can be used from a const instance of the object [06:40:19]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	nf7	[06:40:43] TommyC: Nothing happened. [06:40:43]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	AmR|EiSa	[06:41:11] Olipro: Got it. [06:41:11]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	Olipro	[06:41:57] as an additional note, it's considered good practice that const instance methods should be thread-safe [06:41:57]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	AmR|EiSa	[06:51:13] Can I have " string name(); " And " name() const; " ? [06:51:13]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	AmR|EiSa	[06:51:32] Can I have " string name(); " And " string name() const; " ? [06:51:32]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	TommyC	[06:54:54] AmR|EiSa: As member functions of a class? Yes. [06:54:54]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	urdh	[06:55:19] { foo f; } struct foo { string name() const { return ""; } \\ string name() { return ""; } }; [06:55:19]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	geordi	[06:55:19] error: expected '}' at end of input [06:55:19]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	AmR|EiSa	[06:55:20] yes [06:55:20]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	urdh	[06:55:21] bah [06:55:21]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	TommyC	[06:55:44] AmR|EiSa: Then yes. Their signatures are different. [06:55:44]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	AmR|EiSa	[06:57:31] And if I def Const object from class what I can from them ? [06:57:31]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	AmR|EiSa	[06:57:47] And if I def Const object from class what I can call from them ?* [06:57:47]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	TommyC	[06:58:25] If I understood you correctly, you can call other const member functions from them. [06:58:25]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	dminuoso_	[06:59:21] !give AmR|EiSa basic [06:59:21]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	dminuoso_	[06:59:36] !give "AmR|EiSa" basic [06:59:36]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	nolyc	[06:59:38] AmR|EiSa: Please ask your question in ##C++-basic, as it involves the fundamental basics of the language. [06:59:38]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	AmR|EiSa	[07:00:03] Thanks for all coder for help :) [07:00:03]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	TommyC	[07:00:30] AmR|EiSa: Remember to ask any further similar questions in ##C++-basic. This channel is mostly for discussing the standard and stuff. [07:00:30]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	dminuoso_	[07:01:32] Well, or "less trivial C++ questions" ;-) [07:01:32]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	dminuoso_	[07:01:44] Because technically his question was fairly standard related.. [07:01:44]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	TommyC	[07:02:02] Did you just assume that person's gender? :3 [07:02:02]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	dminuoso_	[07:03:39] Yes, and since I usually always use "they" I'm allowed to do it every now and then. [07:03:39]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	varuntv	[07:22:17] Getting these errors on compiling "ignoring attributes on template argument uint64_t" [07:22:17]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	varuntv	[07:22:55] why does it say ignoring attributes? [07:22:55]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	dminuoso_	[07:24:04] varuntv: can you gist the related code? [07:24:04]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	dminuoso_	[07:24:58] varuntv: Those are warnings though, not errors. [07:24:58]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	varuntv	[07:25:24] dminuoso, yeah i am trying to cleanup the code [07:25:24]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	varuntv	[07:25:35] removing errors [07:25:35]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	varuntv	[07:25:39] warnings [07:25:39]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	dminuoso_	[07:25:52] geordi: typedef int foo __attribute__((__may_alias__)); template<typename T>struct S; template<>struct S<foo>; // varuntv [07:25:52]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	geordi	[07:25:52] warning: ignoring attributes on template argument 'foo {aka int}' [07:25:52]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	dminuoso_	[07:26:24] It should not be anything to worry about, unless you assume that attributes would somehow have an effect on types. [07:26:24]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	varuntv	[07:28:20] but uint64_t is define in cstdint? did you mean to say its not simple typedef from int but have attribute also associated with it? [07:28:20]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	dminuoso_	[07:29:06] varuntv: It appears so. [07:29:06]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	dminuoso_	[07:30:03] varuntv: Perhaps its an alignment attribute? [07:30:03]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	dminuoso_	[07:30:22] Either way, its a GCC extension and thus outside the scope of this channel. [07:30:22]
2016-10-24 23:19:13	varuntv	[07:33:30] dminuoso, okay thanks [07:33:30]

2016-10-25 11:42:04	Lenore	[20:35:05] in those years i learned a lot more math and came to truly appreciate operator overloading. [20:35:05]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	Lenore	[20:35:47] but once i saw C++0x coming up... [20:35:47]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	Lenore	[20:35:56] i gave C++ another chance. [20:35:56]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	Lenore	[20:35:58] glad i did. :) [20:35:58]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	thinlizzy	[20:36:22] :) [20:36:22]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	thinlizzy	[20:36:31] I have to agree that C++11 saved C++ from total doom [20:36:31]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	Lenore	[20:36:57] oh right... also, variadic templates.  how could i forget that one? [20:36:57]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	jasondockers	[20:36:58] I was in elementary school in 03. [20:36:58]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	Lenore	[20:37:02] C++11 made so much TMP useful. [20:37:02]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	thinlizzy	[20:37:43] only move semantics and lambdas were enough for me already. my code got 10000000000000 times better :) [20:37:43]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	Lenore	[20:37:49] i still see templates as the major difference between C and C++.  sure, we have some others (especially RAII), but templates are a different order of language.  :) [20:37:49]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	 *	Lenore [20:37:51] nods. [20:37:51]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	Lenore	[20:38:59] lacking variadic templates pre-11 was painful... especially if you wanted to do anything with function argument lists. [20:38:59]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	jasondockers	[20:39:19] stdarg? [20:39:19]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	Lenore	[20:39:40] like that, but useful. [20:39:40]

2016-10-25 11:47:15	Lenore	[20:46:16] and that's a fair while ago. [20:46:16]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	nejni-marji	[21:08:22] I'm trying to compile this (https://github.com/tiehuis/HeborisC7EX ) but it's giving multiple similar warnings [21:08:22]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	nejni-marji	[21:08:42] src/game/gamestart.cpp:15663:46: warning: ISO C++ forbids converting a string constant to ‘char*’ [-Wwrite-strings] [21:08:42]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	chardan	[21:11:02] nejni-marji: Ok, and? [21:11:02]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	nejni-marji	[21:11:11] I'm not sure how to fix it [21:11:11]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	nejni-marji	[21:11:34] The code isn't mine, I don't know c++, and it hasn't been touched in over a year [21:11:34]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	chardan	[21:11:58] nejni-marji: So, have a look at the line of code it's complaining about... look closely at the types. OK-- short answer: 1) you can ignore the warnings or 2) disable them with -Wno-write-strings [21:11:58]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	thinlizzy	[21:12:19] !give nejni-marji general [21:12:19]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	nolyc	[21:12:20] nejni-marji: ##c++-general for algorithms, libraries, practices, projects, tools etc. yes two #s. [21:12:20]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	halc	[21:25:28] if I have a function returning a structure, should I do "return std::move(retval)"? or will RVO always kick in [21:25:28]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	halc	[21:25:39] I definitely want to avoid copying the structure on return [21:25:39]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	thinlizzy	[21:25:50] avoid returning std::move [21:25:50]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	thinlizzy	[21:25:55] just return by value [21:25:55]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	halc	[21:26:06] it will not copy? [21:26:06]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	thinlizzy	[21:26:18] I don't know. how is your structure defined? [21:26:18]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	halc	[21:26:40] it's a complicated structure that has wstrings and vectors [21:26:40]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	thinlizzy	[21:26:46] passing / returning by value will kick move semantics if you have your class configured to be moved [21:26:46]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	halc	[21:27:03] a vector of more wstrings and vectors [21:27:03]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	halc	[21:27:19] I don't use any custom object types inside of it, just c-style data structs [21:27:19]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	thinlizzy	[21:27:38] hard to tell w/o looking at it. you can try to make a testcase [21:27:38]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	thinlizzy	[21:27:49] also you should read more about move semantics [21:27:49]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	thinlizzy	[21:27:52] there is no magic on that [21:27:52]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	halc	[21:27:59] yeah, I'm definitely hazy on it [21:27:59]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	halc	[21:28:21] an output parameter will guarantee that I don't move; should I use that instead? [21:28:21]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	thinlizzy	[21:28:24] for example: struct rgb { char r,g,b; };    rgb objects will never be moved [21:28:24]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	halc	[21:29:03] well sure, but struct rgb { std::string r, g, b; } will, right? [21:29:03]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	thinlizzy	[21:29:13] only the string part [21:29:13]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	thinlizzy	[21:29:37] halc, rule of thumb - prefer returning by value. do other crazy stuff after profiling/analyzing the results if you aren't satisfied [21:29:37]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	halc	[21:30:09] fair enough [21:30:09]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	KrzaQ	[21:43:11] !interview [21:43:11]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	nolyc	[21:43:14] Were you surprised when you first learned that access control is applied uniformly to all names, whether the names are referred to from declarations or expressions? [21:43:14]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	ru03ydak	[21:43:21] hello [21:43:21]
2016-10-25 11:47:15	KrzaQ	[21:43:43] not really, why would I be? [21:43:43]

2016-10-25 11:47:15	ru03ydak	[21:45:49] In general, C++ implementations obey the zero-overhead principle: What you don't use, you don't pay for [Stroustrup, 1994]. And further: What you do use, you couldn't hand code any better.  作者：很好 链接：http://www.zhihu.com/question/31645634/answer/58749873 来源：知乎 著作权归作者所有，转载请联系作者获得授权。 [21:45:49]

2016-10-25 13:49:43	jancoow_	[22:48:54] sorry, i ofcourse mean ->getFrame() haha [22:48:54]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	noizex	[22:48:57] yeah, gonna make some tea [22:48:57]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	noizex	[22:48:58] ;) [22:48:58]

2016-10-25 13:49:43	noizex	[22:49:57] not skipping virtual, what were you thinking? [22:49:57]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	noizex	[22:50:03] s/:/:: [22:50:03]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	 *	chardan [22:51:24] just learned that this is legal C and C++: int typedef foo; [22:51:24]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	KrzaQ	[22:52:26] I think just `typedef;` was legal C89 [22:52:26]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	chardan	[22:55:41] KrzaQ: This is also legal: int typedef (*bax)(int); [22:55:41]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	KrzaQ	[22:55:59] mhm [22:55:59]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	chardan	[22:56:03] KrzaQ: Well, I (and most people) always have written: typedef int foo; [22:56:03]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	chardan	[22:56:11] KrzaQ: ...but it turns out that's not where it binds! [22:56:11]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	 *	chardan [22:56:16] appreciates "using" even more, now. [22:56:16]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	jancoow_	[22:56:37] noizex: yeah. I'm going to make getFrame virtual, and then create a new function in the base class getMessageFrame() [22:56:37]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	KrzaQ	[22:56:56] well, the whole onion type syntax is ridiculous [22:56:56]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	jancoow_	[22:56:59] so my derived class first calls getMessageFrame() and then builds his extended message [22:56:59]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	noizex	[22:57:11] they can still call the base getFrame()... [22:57:11]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	KrzaQ	[22:57:14] "because left-to-right is too straightforward" [22:57:14]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	jancoow_	[22:57:15] that should work right? [22:57:15]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	jancoow_	[22:57:27] noizex: what do you mean? [22:57:27]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	noizex	[22:58:00] what I said, you can call base method from derived classes if you want to reuse some common functionality [22:58:00]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	thinlizzy	[22:58:18] !fact [22:58:18]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	nolyc	[22:58:20] Layout-compatible enumerations are described in [dcl.enum]. [22:58:20]

2016-10-25 13:49:43	jancoow_	[22:58:38] noizex: yeah but that didn't work in the example i send you first, when it's saved in a message pointer [22:58:38]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	thinlizzy	[22:58:46] "message pointer" :D [22:58:46]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	noizex	[23:02:37] jancoow_: http://ideone.com/0gka4O [23:02:37]
2016-10-25 13:49:44	noizex	[23:02:48] but honestly, get some good book on C++ [23:02:48]
2016-10-25 13:49:44	noizex	[23:05:34] why does unique_ptr not warn about lack of virtual dtor? [23:05:34]
2016-10-25 13:49:44	noizex	[23:05:56] could probably do that with some magic? or it's just one case of unique_ptr use and it wouldn't be that easy to check? [23:05:56]
2016-10-25 13:49:44	KrzaQ	[23:08:17] I think it should be able to do that [23:08:17]
2016-10-25 13:49:44	noizex	[23:10:04] only reason why it doesn't happen I can think of is that not every use of unique_ptr applies to this case [23:10:04]
2016-10-25 13:49:44	noizex	[23:10:29] probably could make some wrapper that would check for it with std::has_virtual_destructor ? [23:10:29]
2016-10-25 13:49:44	noizex	[23:11:09] oh well ;) [23:11:09]

2016-10-25 15:33:46	xaxxon	[00:29:50] calls the virtual for the type the constructor it's currently in is for [00:29:50]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	xaxxon	[00:30:07] not sure who I'm talking to... [00:30:07]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	KrzaQ	[00:30:18] but it's not a pure virtual at this point [00:30:18]

2016-10-25 15:33:46	KrzaQ	[00:31:41] in Bigcheese's example there's a definition of the pure virtual function in base. [00:31:41]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	KrzaQ	[00:31:49] anyhow [00:31:49]

2016-10-25 15:33:46	xaxxon	[00:34:25] why is line 17 UB?  I thought the object was of type B while in B's constructor body [00:34:25]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	KrzaQ	[00:34:45] go is pure virtual at this point [00:34:45]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	xaxxon	[00:34:54] right.. missed that that was still commented out [00:34:54]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	Eelis	[00:36:24] read some SO threads, seems to be a recurring topic and there's no satisfying answer. so looks like a case of bogus ub to me [00:36:24]

2016-10-25 15:33:46	KrzaQ	[00:37:02] maybe it's for ease of implementation in the "early days"? [00:37:02]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	KrzaQ	[00:40:45] I wonder what a compiler writer's perspective is on that [00:40:45]

2016-10-25 15:33:46	coebalt	[01:21:59]  Hi, so i came across a copy of "Learn c the hardway", and it tells me that to get started i need to install the Build-essentials package. I did that, but then it starts jumping into the exercises without even telling you what you're actually putting the code into. Any hep herE? [01:21:59]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	kalven	[01:23:46] coebalt: check with zed [01:23:46]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	coebalt	[01:23:58] What/who is that [01:23:58]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	coebalt	[01:24:18] oh [01:24:18]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	coebalt	[01:24:25] that was a really dumb question me thinks [01:24:25]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	coebalt	[01:24:44] Do you mean the author of the book lol [01:24:44]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	halvors	[01:25:01] Hi, may someone please help me figure out what about my code that is causing the segfault i'm getting? My code is available at: https://github.com/OpenRcon/ClientTestCase The error i'm getting is: http://pastebin.com/Xst3mKbw [01:25:01]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	coebalt	[01:25:12] I guess it didn't occur to me at first because i wouldnt think to talk to the author directly [01:25:12]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	kalven	[01:26:36] halvors: you put the github link in your pastebin paste. ##c++-general is probably a better place for this [01:26:36]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	baudejogos	[01:27:15] yeah! he was already told that, but he decided to "forget it", instead [01:27:15]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	baudejogos	[01:27:49] but well, here is the bot punishment for him [01:27:49]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	baudejogos	[01:27:54] !give halvors not a testcase [01:27:54]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	nolyc	[01:27:55] halvors: Stop! A testcase must 0) be short (<=50 lines) 1) be self-contained and 2) reproduce the problem. Don't paste another link here until: I) you've pasted your testcase to http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com II) there are no irrelevant compile errors and III) it reproduces the problem. See the testcase checklist at http://eel.is/c++/testcase/ [01:27:55]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	xaxxon	[01:31:31] halvors did the same thing a few hours ago [01:31:31]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	xaxxon	[01:32:04] and lizzy did the same thing as baude [01:32:04]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	halvors	[01:32:25] baudejogos: I did write a testcase, but since the Qt libraries is needed in order to reproduce the error, i had to create a repository instead. [01:32:25]
2016-10-25 15:33:46	kalven	[01:33:05] xaxxon: cause it's the same guy. [01:33:05]

2016-10-25 15:35:13	xaxxon	halvors, the issue here is that you're in way over your head...
2016-10-25 15:35:37	xaxxon	you're not understanding fundamental parts of how to develop in c++ yet trying to use them all ... so when something fails you have no idea how to isolate what is breaking

2016-10-25 15:35:50	xaxxon	so you come to us and post us this huge mess of code and can't point to where you're having a problem
2016-10-25 15:36:07	xaxxon	so then we have to either ignore you or spend a ton of time trying to figure out what your code does... people tend to select the quicker option
2016-10-25 15:36:40	xaxxon	no one is going to install a bunch of libraries to reproduce your error.   You need to learn how to use a debugger
2016-10-25 15:36:59	xaxxon	you should ask "how do i use a debugger" in ##c++-basic
2016-10-25 15:37:22	halvors	xaxxon: Here is the textcase i wrote. But that is working just fine... http://cpp.sh/2crye
2016-10-25 15:38:05	xaxxon	halvors, you need to learn how to use a debugger so you can figure out exactly why your code is crashing.

2016-10-25 15:39:03	xaxxon	that's not a debugger.
2016-10-25 15:39:16	halvors	Well, it's producing the same result as GDB.
2016-10-25 15:39:17	xaxxon	gdb is a debugger
2016-10-25 15:39:25	xaxxon	[18:36]  <xaxxon> you should ask "how do i use a debugger" in ##c++-basic

2016-10-25 17:57:00	coebalt	[01:24:25] that was a really dumb question me thinks [01:24:25]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	coebalt	[01:24:44] Do you mean the author of the book lol [01:24:44]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	halvors	[01:25:01] Hi, may someone please help me figure out what about my code that is causing the segfault i'm getting? My code is available at: https://github.com/OpenRcon/ClientTestCase The error i'm getting is: http://pastebin.com/Xst3mKbw [01:25:01]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	coebalt	[01:25:12] I guess it didn't occur to me at first because i wouldnt think to talk to the author directly [01:25:12]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	kalven	[01:26:36] halvors: you put the github link in your pastebin paste. ##c++-general is probably a better place for this [01:26:36]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	baudejogos	[01:27:15] yeah! he was already told that, but he decided to "forget it", instead [01:27:15]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	baudejogos	[01:27:49] but well, here is the bot punishment for him [01:27:49]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	baudejogos	[01:27:54] !give halvors not a testcase [01:27:54]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	nolyc	[01:27:55] halvors: Stop! A testcase must 0) be short (<=50 lines) 1) be self-contained and 2) reproduce the problem. Don't paste another link here until: I) you've pasted your testcase to http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com II) there are no irrelevant compile errors and III) it reproduces the problem. See the testcase checklist at http://eel.is/c++/testcase/ [01:27:55]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	xaxxon	[01:31:31] halvors did the same thing a few hours ago [01:31:31]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	xaxxon	[01:32:04] and lizzy did the same thing as baude [01:32:04]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	halvors	[01:32:25] baudejogos: I did write a testcase, but since the Qt libraries is needed in order to reproduce the error, i had to create a repository instead. [01:32:25]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	kalven	[01:33:05] xaxxon: cause it's the same guy. [01:33:05]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	halvors	[01:34:20] Let me know how i can use custom libraries using http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com [01:34:20]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	xaxxon	[01:35:13] halvors, the issue here is that you're in way over your head... [01:35:13]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	xaxxon	[01:35:37] you're not understanding fundamental parts of how to develop in c++ yet trying to use them all ... so when something fails you have no idea how to isolate what is breaking [01:35:37]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	xaxxon	[01:35:50] so you come to us and post us this huge mess of code and can't point to where you're having a problem [01:35:50]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	xaxxon	[01:36:07] so then we have to either ignore you or spend a ton of time trying to figure out what your code does... people tend to select the quicker option [01:36:07]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	xaxxon	[01:36:40] no one is going to install a bunch of libraries to reproduce your error.   You need to learn how to use a debugger [01:36:40]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	xaxxon	[01:36:59] you should ask "how do i use a debugger" in ##c++-basic [01:36:59]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	halvors	[01:37:22] xaxxon: Here is the textcase i wrote. But that is working just fine... http://cpp.sh/2crye [01:37:22]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	xaxxon	[01:38:05] halvors, you need to learn how to use a debugger so you can figure out exactly why your code is crashing. [01:38:05]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	xaxxon	[01:38:17] and that's th elast thing I'll say about this in this channel [01:38:17]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	halvors	[01:38:29] xaxxon: Well, i can use a debugger, the problem is how to isolate the issue. http://pastebin.com/Hz6NLudN [01:38:29]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	halvors	[01:38:44] I see i failed to paste the log from the debugger. [01:38:44]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	xaxxon	[01:39:03] that's not a debugger. [01:39:03]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	halvors	[01:39:16] Well, it's producing the same result as GDB. [01:39:16]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	xaxxon	[01:39:16] gdb is a debugger [01:39:16]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	xaxxon	[01:39:25] [18:36]  <xaxxon> you should ask "how do i use a debugger" in ##c++-basic [01:39:25]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	halvors	[01:39:30] I can paste exactly the same trace from that if you want :) [01:39:30]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	xaxxon	[01:40:01] it's still inappropriate for this channel.   pick: [01:40:01]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	xaxxon	[01:40:05] !give halvors general [01:40:05]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	nolyc	[01:40:06] halvors: ##c++-general for algorithms, libraries, practices, projects, tools etc. yes two #s. [01:40:06]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	xaxxon	[01:40:08] !give halvors basic [01:40:08]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	nolyc	[01:40:09] halvors: Please ask your question in ##C++-basic, as it involves the fundamental basics of the language. [01:40:09]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	halvors	[01:40:44] Ok, will do. So you guys doesn't see a obvious problem from the debugger trace? [01:40:44]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	baudejogos	[01:48:38] halvors: if you don't learn how to break down your code (aka, if you can't make a testcase), you will have these problems forever [01:48:38]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	halvors	[01:49:05] baudejogos: I get that, but i actually did that. [01:49:05]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	baudejogos	[01:49:23] I am afraid you did not [01:49:23]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	baudejogos	[01:50:22] "plz fix my c0de" or "plz debug my shit" don't work here :( [01:50:22]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	coebalt	[01:52:20] So, what do you guys generally recommend to start learning C? LCTHW or K&r2? [01:52:20]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	coebalt	[01:52:35] Or neither? [01:52:35]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	coebalt	[01:52:36] Both? [01:52:36]

I was saying, operator< doesn't compare based on which pointer points to the higher/lower memory. just like std::less<T> doesn't compare pointers based on the address value, for pointers, it only gives a specifed order, but the draft doesn't mention what's the order, it's just impl. defined.

2016-10-26 09:43:37	meowzus	[15:04:24] i have to write this hash function mysel [15:04:24]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	meowzus	[15:04:26] myself [15:04:26]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	urdh	[15:04:29] why [15:04:29]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	urdh	[15:04:33] you will get it wrong :( [15:04:33]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	meowzus	[15:04:46] lol... well no one else has written this [15:04:46]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	urdh	[15:05:08] and there will be a horrible design flaw and everyone will be sad when there's a bunch of collisions in your home-grown hash function [15:05:08]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	meowzus	[15:05:26] lol okay [15:05:26]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	urdh	[15:05:59] (unless you're a researcher in the cryptography field, in which case do w/e) [15:05:59]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	urdh	[15:08:52] meowzus: out of interest, why are you implementing your own hash? [15:08:52]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	meowzus	[15:09:09] different type of hash [15:09:09]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	meowzus	[15:09:20] not common [15:09:20]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	urdh	[15:09:21] but why [15:09:21]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	urdh	[15:09:38] what's wrong with all hashes that already exist? [15:09:38]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	strtok	[15:09:57] meowzus works for the NSA [15:09:57]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	meowzus	[15:10:37] this is called a chameleon hash [15:10:37]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	urdh	[15:17:33] meowzus, ok [15:17:33]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	urdh	[15:17:34] meowzus, to maybe answer your original question; the bignums could we wrapped with the pointers held in unique_ptrs (using BN_new and BN_free) because you're the owner of the pointer BN_new gives you [15:17:34]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	urdh	[15:18:17] (not stated explicitly in the docs but kind of implicit with these OOP-in-C APIs) [15:18:17]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	meowzus	[15:18:43] okay cool thanks [15:18:43]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	meowzus	[15:18:49] are you familiar with golang by any chance [15:18:49]

2016-10-26 09:43:37	HeTo	[18:00:17] you could also place the definition of bar in a separate translation unit [18:00:17]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	HeTo	[18:00:47] snyp: there are no variables of function type, so no [18:00:47]

2016-10-26 09:43:37	BanHammor	[18:01:19] i can't really imagine what a variable of a function type would be. [18:01:19]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	snyp	[18:01:45] BanHammor: me neither. so i asked. should've directly asked that. [18:01:45]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	HeTo	[18:01:51] a refrrence to a function would be like int(&)(int,int) [18:01:51]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	snyp	[18:02:31] HeTo: yeah, googled that. (after writing my message here) [18:02:31]

2016-10-26 09:43:37	et	[18:04:11] std::function is. function types not. [18:04:11]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	snyp	[18:04:23] i see [18:04:23]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	snyp	[18:04:56] always wondered what the 'signature' type was in std::function, thought i'd investigate today. [18:04:56]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	snyp	[18:05:38] it's not a pointer, that requires a *. maybe a reference. no. it's a function type, something i had no idea about. [18:05:38]

2016-10-26 10:19:36	SlashLife	Kinda like the Weeping Angels. They're absolutely benign ... unless you don't look.
2016-10-26 10:19:41	thinlizzy	oh sure. it is not aiming for SCALE, obviously
2016-10-26 10:19:51	thinlizzy	if you need scale and robustness, just use apache :)
2016-10-26 10:20:29	thinlizzy	but these nifty little bells?.... I just ignore them. I support a very simple HTTP protocol
2016-10-26 10:20:37	thinlizzy	no bs
2016-10-26 10:20:39	SlashLife	I like Apache, but I think if I wanted to scale, I'd look into nginx. Having a server written in C++ is not a problem, either ... but I don't want external clients to be able to talk to it directly.

2016-10-26 12:54:15	nolyc	[22:12:35] DustinGraham: ##c++-general for algorithms, libraries, practices, projects, tools etc. yes two #s. [22:12:35]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	DustinGraham	[22:13:49] kalven I'll look into that, thanks [22:13:49]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	thinlizzy	[22:13:51] the "etc" part includes homework help, so you will be well there, DustinGraham [22:13:51]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	kalven	[22:14:58] DustinGraham: if you read 0b04 in little endian format, it's 1035, same with your other examples. [22:14:58]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	DustinGraham	[22:15:02] thinlizzy I'm building a new system for our shipping dept, parsing a /dev/usb/hidraw0 input from our digital scale, so we can push the numbers into ups/fedex, and I've gotten it down to those pairs of bytes, trying to figure out how to convert them to decimals so I can feed them to the ups/fedex api ;) [22:15:02]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	DustinGraham	[22:15:31] Thanks kalven, I'll look into that, appreciate it. [22:15:31]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	louiz	[22:22:29] hum, http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/chrono/gmtime this function is not thread-safe, and std::gmtime is just the same function, in a namespace, right? So std::gmtime isn’t thread-safe either, right? [22:22:29]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	thinlizzy	[22:24:03] yup. avoid that crap [22:24:03]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	thinlizzy	[22:24:50] http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono <-- this is the header you are looking for :) [22:24:50]

2016-10-26 12:54:15	thinlizzy	[22:26:54] who needs them? :) [22:26:54]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	thinlizzy	[22:27:56] Sierra was good [22:27:56]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	kalven	[22:28:12] a lot of people, which is why hinnant is working on a new date/time library. [22:28:12]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	rain1	[22:36:46] hi [22:36:46]

2016-10-26 12:54:15	et	[22:45:45] rain1: a new version, not a new program [22:45:45]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	rain1	[22:46:36] has anyone here tried running it? [22:46:36]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	louiz	[22:46:51] thinlizzy, I can’t parse a timestamp with just std::chrono, so… [22:46:51]

2016-10-26 23:39:03	va2	since neither of the two has a restrict qualifier, you have to assume they are the same
2016-10-26 23:39:27	EricWF	Actually I think C++ assumes the opposite.

2016-10-27 14:55:33	xaxxon	Jinxit, and it's not going to do multiple levels of conversion for you... it won't make a const proxy in order to make a non-const proxy (from my understanding)

2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:09:47] also, you probably shouldn't be using shared_ptr.  most people don't understand how to use unique_ptr and use shared_ptr because they're doing it wrong [02:09:47]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	Jinxit	[02:10:07] http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/9b9b901884ac8959 so this is where i'm at now. the result is obvious if you think about it, but is there any non-copypaste way around it? [02:10:07]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:10:28] 80-90% unique_ptr is correct [02:10:28]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	Jinxit	[02:10:35] (see comments in the Selector class) [02:10:35]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	funfunctor	[02:10:55] I am not sure unique_ptr is right here? would shared_ptr not be more appropriate as we are passing the whole object to the constructor? [02:10:55]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	funfunctor	[02:11:59] you could be right though, unique_ptr maybe best in one of my cases [02:11:59]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	funfunctor	[02:12:31] just going back to shared_pointer.get() what about the reference counter though? [02:12:31]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:12:35] if you are calling a copy/move constructor with something in a smart pointer, that doesn't impact whether it should be a unique or shared [02:12:35]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:13:12] it's about what is responsible for determining when to call delete on the object [02:13:12]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	funfunctor	[02:15:43] xaxxon: well the situtation is this:  std::shared_ptr<CaptureDelegate> mCaptureDelegate(new CaptureDelegate(p, dlInput)); [02:15:43]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	funfunctor	[02:15:43] ret = dlInput->SetCallback(mCaptureDelegate);  // configures a callback which will be called for each captured frame. [02:15:43]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	funfunctor	[02:16:10] so I guess 'no one' actually calls delete manually at least [02:16:10]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:16:35] yeah, with callbacks things get hairy [02:16:35]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	funfunctor	[02:16:59] first I need unique_ptr here right? [02:16:59]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	funfunctor	[02:17:49] second SetCallback()'s type signature is beyond my control (from SDK) so I would have to use .get() to obtain the raw pointer value [02:17:49]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	funfunctor	[02:18:02] but then what happens? [02:18:02]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:22:05] funfunctor, you just need to figure out a list of objects that when they go away, the object you're storing in a smart pointer also needs to go away [02:22:05]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:22:16] if the list has 1 thing, use unique_ptr [02:22:16]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:22:25] if the list has more than 1 thing, use shared_ptr [02:22:25]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:22:43] when X goes away, my other object goes away with it -- unique_ptr [02:22:43]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:23:03] when the last of X, Y, and Z go away, only then does my object go away -- shared_ptr [02:23:03]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	funfunctor	[02:23:37] xaxxon: yes I read the wikipage on it [02:23:37]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:23:41] ok [02:23:41]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	funfunctor	[02:23:47] *wikipedia [02:23:47]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:24:09] if the callback lifetime is known to be a subset of another object's lifetime, your object can be a unique_ptr on the longer lifetime object [02:24:09]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	funfunctor	[02:24:29] I am just trying to work out the implication of .get() on a unique_ptr regarding scope and leakage [02:24:29]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:24:32] but if there is an indeterminate relationship between them, it may be needed to parameterize the callback with the shared_ptr [02:24:32]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:24:37] there is none [02:24:37]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	funfunctor	[02:24:59] ok yes that is a good way to frame it indeed [02:24:59]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:25:06] get doesn't change that the ownership is still on the unique_ptr [02:25:06]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:25:25] get() means "let me look at it" [02:25:25]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	funfunctor	[02:25:26] shared_ptr seemed 'safer' to me just in case the origin's lifetime somehow was shorter [02:25:26]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:25:45] never freeing up any memory ever is even safer [02:25:45]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:25:49] but it doesnt' mean it's correct [02:25:49]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	funfunctor	[02:25:49] right that is my understanding of .get() also [02:25:49]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	funfunctor	[02:26:00] sure [02:26:00]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	funfunctor	[02:26:34] how does the unique_ptr template class 'known' when to call delete? [02:26:34]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	funfunctor	[02:26:39] what is the rule(s) here? [02:26:39]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:27:07] the smart pointer's destructor does it [02:27:07]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:27:33] for shared_ptr, it checks a reference count in the destructor and if it's 0, then it deletes it [02:27:33]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	funfunctor	[02:28:13] right [02:28:13]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	funfunctor	[02:28:50] but my question is, what rule is the decrimentor governed by for the counter? [02:28:50]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:34:05] funfunctor, I don't know what that means [02:34:05]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:34:14] every time you make a copy of a shared pointer the counter goes up one [02:34:14]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:34:26] every time you destroy a shared pointer, the counter goes down one [02:34:26]
2016-10-27 17:07:21	xaxxon	[02:34:37] when the counter hits 0, the data it points to is destroyed [02:34:37]

2016-10-27 17:17:50	dbb	hi all - I am making a small change to an old lib.. doing minimal changes I hope, and it has been a long time since I worked in C++... so .. there is a Class utility to return a singleton pointer, which returns a const .. I need to make a reference of that.. but it is non-const .. it is used in a lot of places
2016-10-27 17:19:03	dbb	BigFactory& bf = *bf_p;   // const on the right, no const on the left.. possible ?

2016-10-27 17:20:40	ac_slater_	dbb: what would be the point of having non-const access to a const-pointer?
2016-10-27 17:21:36	ac_slater_	dbb: I think I see what's happening
2016-10-27 17:21:43	ac_slater_	you eventually want to modify the const thing, right?
2016-10-27 17:22:12	dbb	there are ten or more of these occurring, in one long dense file.. that is heavily used in production now.. I want to make the smallest change I can.. so I dont want to change function declarations
2016-10-27 17:22:35	ac_slater_	dbb: well what do you ACTUALLY want to do with the non-const thing
2016-10-27 17:22:35		[17:22]
2016-10-27 17:22:40	dbb	I wont modify the const thing, no.. it is passed around to make objects, in gnarly code I dont want to touch

2016-10-27 17:23:01	ac_slater_	dbb: so the code you want to pass it to just happens to accept it as non-const?
2016-10-27 17:23:32	ac_slater_	the thing about const, is the compiler will tell you if you mess it up. Meaning no runtime risks
2016-10-27 17:23:35	dbb	yes

2016-10-27 17:31:02	xaxxon	funfunctor, a pointer going out of scope won't call a destructor on something it points to
2016-10-27 17:31:06	ac_slater_	dbb: exactly, const_cast causes undefined behaviour. Which is as bad as it gets

2016-10-27 17:35:50	dbb	ok - the good news is.. that the many functions that take the Factory ref, are not declared in the dot-hpp
2016-10-27 17:36:13	dbb	so perhaps it is all contained in this one dot-cpp .. even though it is messy

2016-10-27 20:55:47	Andlon	I'm in a situation where it could make sense to use the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern. However, I'm worried it will make the API much harder to understand. Does anyone have any opinions on when it's worthwhile to add this complexity?
2016-10-27 20:56:07	Andlon	Hmm, actually, let me try to describe my situation, to see if anyone has any ideas for patterns that might fit my situation better

2016-10-27 20:58:11	Andlon	I have a template class IndexedMesh<Scalar, Index>, which represents a 2D geometrical mesh. This is all good, but it would be convenient to be able to take a 'subset' of the mesh and work on that

2016-10-27 20:59:46	Andlon	So I could have an IndexedMeshView or something like that, which stores a reference to the vertices in the mesh, and a list of triangle indices in the subset
2016-10-27 21:00:20	Andlon	but the mesh has some methods that I'd rather not have to reimplement for the IndexedMeshView
2016-10-27 21:00:38	Andlon	so I could move these methods into an IndexedMeshBase template class and use CRTP
2016-10-27 21:01:17	Andlon	I'm not sure if I've made myself clear, but if anyone has any opinions on if using the CRTP is a good fit, I'd appreciate hearing them!

2016-10-27 22:29:46	Andlon	[06:55:47] I'm in a situation where it could make sense to use the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern. However, I'm worried it will make the API much harder to understand. Does anyone have any opinions on when it's worthwhile to add this complexity? [06:55:47]
2016-10-27 22:29:46	Andlon	[06:56:06] Hmm, actually, let me try to describe my situation, to see if anyone has any ideas for patterns that might fit my situation better [06:56:06]
2016-10-27 22:29:46	Andlon	[06:58:11] I have a template class IndexedMesh<Scalar, Index>, which represents a 2D geometrical mesh. This is all good, but it would be convenient to be able to take a 'subset' of the mesh and work on that [06:58:11]
2016-10-27 22:29:46	Andlon	[06:59:46] So I could have an IndexedMeshView or something like that, which stores a reference to the vertices in the mesh, and a list of triangle indices in the subset [06:59:46]
2016-10-27 22:29:46	Andlon	[07:00:20] but the mesh has some methods that I'd rather not have to reimplement for the IndexedMeshView [07:00:20]
2016-10-27 22:29:46	Andlon	[07:00:38] so I could move these methods into an IndexedMeshBase template class and use CRTP [07:00:38]
2016-10-27 22:29:46	Andlon	[07:01:17] I'm not sure if I've made myself clear, but if anyone has any opinions on if using the CRTP is a good fit, I'd appreciate hearing them! [07:01:17]
2016-10-27 22:29:46	immibis	[07:08:33] Would IndexedMeshBase have methods that return *this or similar? [07:08:33]
2016-10-27 22:29:46	immibis	[07:08:40] member functions* [07:08:40]
2016-10-27 22:29:46	Andlon	[07:12:04] immibis, no, most of its methods are simply methods to retrieve information about geometrical objects in the mesh [07:12:04]
2016-10-27 22:29:46	Andlon	[07:13:10] IndexedMeshBase<Scalar, Index, Derived> could then be implemented by accessing the underlying data storage of the Derived type (which would be a vector of vertices, a vector of triangles/elements and some neighbor information) [07:13:10]
2016-10-27 22:29:46	immibis	[07:58:21] Andlon: you could use virtual functions [07:58:21]
2016-10-27 22:29:46	Andlon	[07:59:49] immibis, well, I happen to rely heavily on the inlining of template functions for performance, so I think introducing virtual functions would not cut it, unfortunately! [07:59:49]
2016-10-27 22:29:46	Andlon	[08:00:40] (of course, you never know, maybe the compiler is smart enough to be able to extract similar performance) [08:00:40]

2016-10-28 07:01:10	phao	Hi. I'm doing some small experiments with C++ and GMP having to do with using operator overloading with GMP types. I have this test program (forgive my C-ish C++): http://pastie.org/private/spbbll9cw1xten3fyv0ncq with gave these results http://pastie.org/private/ewo6qbcl0r9kueuoenpaa - What surprised me was that the version using the + operator ran faster than the version using the += operator/assignment calls. Any explanations as to why that is?

2016-10-28 11:28:01	VE6ISA	So, does &*vector::end() is obviously bad practise but it seems to always work. Is that because vector::end() always points to the next item after a contiguous block of memory. Are there an implementations where this doesn't work?

2016-10-28 11:31:43	nolyc	VE6ISA: Undefined behavior results when programs attempt to do things for which the standard defines no semantics, and requires no diagnostic either. Examples include dereferencing invalid pointers and dividing by zero. Executing such programs may cause them to produce incorrect results, crash, silently "work", or even format the hard drive.

2016-10-28 11:33:40	thinlizzy	so just don't do that. it buys you nothing. if you are really addicted to pointers and you want to work with them, do auto p_end = v.data() + v.size(); instead

2016-10-28 12:28:09	thinlizzy	[21:37:22] offtopic :-/ [21:37:22]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	Oxyd	[21:37:40] I don't have any, but I'm sure if you go and write a filesystem driver, you'll get one yourself. [21:37:40]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	thinlizzy	[21:37:50] :D you are on fire, Oxyd [21:37:50]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	Eelis	[21:41:28] clappjak: the whole point is to emphasize that as far as the language is concerned, once behavior is undefined, absolutely anything can happen, regadless of whether it's plausible [21:41:28]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	Eelis	[21:41:46] so complaining that the example isn't plausible means you've missed the point. [21:41:46]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	clappjak	[21:42:16] Eelis, not that it isn't plausible, I've just never personally heard of it happening [21:42:16]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	Eelis	[21:42:41] of course it's not plausible, that's the point (again) [21:42:41]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	hs_	[21:53:59] clappjak, the point of UB is not that something crazy may happen; it is that the compiler can make something crazy happen and still count as "conforming to C++" [21:53:59]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	Smasher	[22:05:06] hi all! i have some years experience in java development and start to use c/c++ now, and I wonder if there is something wrong with it if I use the same var/func naming conventions which i use in java? [22:05:06]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	thinlizzy	[22:05:50] Smasher, go for it [22:05:50]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	thinlizzy	[22:05:51] !next [22:05:51]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	nolyc	[22:05:52] Another satisfied customer, next! [22:05:52]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	thinlizzy	[22:06:22] ah I forgot something very important [22:06:22]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	thinlizzy	[22:06:27] !give Smasher c/c++ [22:06:27]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	nolyc	[22:06:28] Smasher: I take most uses of the compound C/C++ as an indication of ignorance. ~ Bjarne Stroustrup - See also http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#C-slash [22:06:28]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	Smasher	[22:12:51] nolyc alright :D but sometimes you are forced to mix them up... mainly because you just cant write everything yourself and have to rely on external code [22:12:51]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	Smasher	[22:13:05] that should have went to thinlizzy [22:13:05]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	Smasher	[22:13:41] but as for the conventions this sounds good, because i dont have to readjust [22:13:41]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	w3z	[22:13:44] why does everyone want to preface their silly questions with how they *do* have experience in x but ... [22:13:44]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	Smasher	[22:14:34] to bring out the background [22:14:34]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	thinlizzy	[22:14:42] vanity, need for attention/respect,... who knows? I already gave up on understanding the psychotic minds from the internets ;( [22:14:42]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	w3z	[22:14:46] eh, using camelcase and pseudo-hungarian wont ingratiate you with most developers [22:14:46]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	thinlizzy	[22:15:22] also his question has nothing to do with the language and it requires more context like his developer community / company, accepted coding styles, etc. [22:15:22]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	w3z	[22:15:38] but this channel is not about your silly format style choices [22:15:38]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	thinlizzy	[22:15:56] w3z, also the normal/common java coding style does not use hungarian, but we are getting offtopic :) [22:15:56]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	thinlizzy	[22:16:35] getting back to C++, I've seen camelCase and PascalCase in a lot of places, including in the same code base :-/ [22:16:35]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	w3z	[22:16:51] did you enjoy my c/c++ snippet yesterday? [22:16:51]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	Smasher	[22:17:03] didnt mean to start a holywar -.- [22:17:03]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	thinlizzy	[22:17:06] as long as it is consistent, there is nothing wrong with that [22:17:06]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	w3z	[22:17:31] well, it cant be consistent since the std_lib_uses_this [22:17:31]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	w3z	[22:17:57] an PascalCase for concepts [22:17:57]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	w3z	[22:18:00] d [22:18:00]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	Smasher	[22:18:52] since i dont develop in a team i think i can use camel case, as long as i stick to it [22:18:52]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	w3z	[22:20:18] {D d; B*p=&d; p->f();} using B=struct{virtual void f()=0;}; using D=struct:B{void f()override{BARK;}}; [22:20:18]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	geordi	[22:20:19] void<unnamed struct>::f() [22:20:19]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	w3z	[22:21:18] i cant stress strongly enough how i dont care [22:21:18]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	w3z	[22:22:10] i emphatically have no concerns about the style in which you write your hello world program [22:22:10]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	Smasher	[22:23:38] w3z i can feel some hate though [22:23:38]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	w3z	[22:24:15] thats just baseline hate [22:24:15]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	Smasher	[22:24:34] aha, i see [22:24:34]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	w3z	[22:25:14] plus irritation at off-topic chatter [22:25:14]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	Smasher	[22:26:06] well then lets </offtopic> [22:26:06]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	thinlizzy	[22:26:08] w3z, no C++ coding style should be obligated to be consistent with stdlib code. there are lots of weird stuff there [22:26:08]

2016-10-28 22:29:29	xaxxon	[08:17:09] cool, thank you. [08:17:09]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	KrzaQ	[08:17:29] hm [08:17:29]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	xaxxon	[08:18:56] What I was missing is that calling a function doesn't care which is more specific, but instantiating a class does [08:18:56]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	xaxxon	[08:19:33] I basically tried what you did with functions and couldn't make it work because the functino calls were ambiguous [08:19:33]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	KrzaQ	[08:19:54] ah, yeah [08:19:54]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	KrzaQ	[08:21:06] I guess you could make go_impl a static function of the trait, (not sure whether this is a good idea, but it's there) [08:21:06]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	xaxxon	[08:21:55] I'll mess with it.  I just needed the hint in the right direction.   thank you [08:21:55]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	xaxxon	[08:22:27] I just need to know if I got a proxy, what is it a proxy for.   and I'm defining proxy as "has OTHER" [08:22:27]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	xaxxon	[08:22:44] at least that's the corellary to the test case [08:22:44]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	xaxxon	[08:26:22] KrzaQ, This is what I really wanted to do: https://godbolt.org/g/wnrfJP [08:26:22]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	xaxxon	[08:26:46] KrzaQ, thanks again :) [08:26:46]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	KrzaQ	[08:26:53] no problem [08:26:53]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	KrzaQ	[08:27:07] I'd put RealT as a using declaration inside go though [08:27:07]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	KrzaQ	[08:27:41] unless you want to be able to use a specific type that's not consistent with the trait [08:27:41]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	AxldenieD	[08:27:54] hello :) [08:27:54]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	KrzaQ	[08:28:00] i.e go<Bar,Foo>() [08:28:00]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	KrzaQ	[08:29:15] xaxxon: https://godbolt.org/g/lHfqQX [08:29:15]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	KrzaQ	[08:29:23] I guess this makes it a little verbose for C++11 though [08:29:23]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	xaxxon	[08:29:26] you dirty little auto cheater [08:29:26]

2016-10-28 22:33:17	w3z	you cuold use if constexpr there instead of nesting the type in your trait

2016-10-28 22:35:32	KrzaQ	it's a bit more difficult with if constexpr :P
