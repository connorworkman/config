2016-10-17 13:15:44	w3z	well it depends on the type of the object, if its pod, and has no padding, you can simply use it as an effective type in the buffer via a cast (the legallity of doing so in std c++ is eh), alternatively you can placement new it in to the buffer, assuming proper alignment .... otherwise, you have to copy the data from the buffer in to your new object instance
2016-10-17 13:16:43	w3z	there is no difference between a class and struct type in c++ other than default public access to members and public inheritance

2016-10-17 14:55:53	davidstone	And `f` has an overload that is specialized on nullptr to be deleted
2016-10-17 14:55:58	davidstone	Or provide some other sort of error mechanism

2016-10-17 14:58:59	Eelis	so that logic leads to atrocities
2016-10-17 14:59:16	davidstone	The 'real' solution is to use a better type for string literals

2016-10-17 15:03:42	Eelis	and those analyses can be all the wonderful flow analysis stuff and whatnot, and actually catch some meaningful cases

2016-10-17 18:08:26	w33	what function like memcpy was there that allowed the two buffers to overlap?

2016-10-17 18:10:50	w33	thanks
2016-10-17 18:11:36	w33	ptr_1 and ptr_1 overlaps in memcpy(ptr_1,ptr_1, num);. Is that okay? It's basically a NOP?
2016-10-17 18:11:44	ubsan	it's fine

2016-10-17 18:11:49	ubsan	although it won't be a NOP

2016-10-17 18:12:33	w33	ubsan: it won't?
2016-10-17 18:12:34	medgno	isn't memcpy with overlapping memory undefined?
2016-10-17 18:12:49	ubsan	w33: I mean like, it'll still do the copy
2016-10-17 18:12:56	ubsan	even though it's equivalent to a NOP
2016-10-17 18:13:00	ubsan	so sloooowness
2016-10-17 18:13:47	Moto-chan	If you pass in equal pointers, they do overlap, therefore the behaviour is unsigned.
2016-10-17 18:13:53	Moto-chan	For memcpy anyway
2016-10-17 18:14:13	chrisf	undefined, perhaps.
2016-10-17 18:14:34	Moto-chan	Lol, yes
2016-10-17 18:14:35	Moto-chan	Typo

2016-10-17 18:15:36	w33	right

2016-10-17 21:03:33	nolyc	[06:21:21] Did you know that member functions of a local class shall be defined inline in their class definition, if they are defined at all? [06:21:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	Moto-chan	[06:21:49] w3z: Careful! Someone may think that guy is you at a glance! [06:21:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	xaxxon	[06:24:06] a "did you know" "yes/no" interview question.   I want to interview there [06:24:06]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	xaxxon	[06:24:23] though I guess it could be a trick questino [06:24:23]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	w3z	[06:24:39] can you explain why if you prefer ..... because local function definitions are not allowed [06:24:39]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	w3z	[06:25:31] even retards want to be like mike [06:25:31]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	Moto-chan	[06:25:34] They're inline inside the class definition because it'd be pretty silly if they weren't :3 [06:25:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	w3z	[06:26:47] (though jordan references are sort of dated now, dunno if retards want to be like lebron though) [06:26:47]

2016-10-17 21:03:33	nolyc	[06:27:17] When does it matter that the member functions whose names end in _until take an argument that specifies a time point? [06:27:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	w3z	[06:27:56] when you want to specify a timeout ... [06:27:56]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	w3z	[06:28:51] !interview [06:28:51]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	nolyc	[06:28:53] Do you often dream about the fact that a class that declares or inherits a virtual function is called a polymorphic class? [06:28:53]

2016-10-17 21:03:33	fiveflowerzz	[07:02:27] How to know when (in which cases)   mytype x;    automatically assigns it to a zero value? [07:02:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	fiveflowerzz	[07:02:52] i.e. for which types are we sure, in C++03, that it is automatically zero when defining it ? [07:02:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	velco	[07:02:52] mytype x{}; [07:02:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	fiveflowerzz	[07:03:21] velco: can you explain? [07:03:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	velco	[07:03:23] "mytype x;" is default initialized; if there is no ctor it won;t be initialized [07:03:23]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	***	Playback Complete.
2016-10-17 21:03:54	velco	in contrast, "mytype x{};" will be zeroed if there is no ctor

2016-10-18 00:14:20	V-ille	[09:06:50] casting the vectors won't [09:06:50]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	xaxxon	[09:06:53] Waynes, the vectors aren't compatible [09:06:53]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	xaxxon	[09:07:08] the data inside them may be, but you cannot pass it to something that wants a vector of the other type [09:07:08]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	V-ille	[09:07:28] you need to get a span type from the future [09:07:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	xaxxon	[09:07:28] you can't even change the constness of the element type [09:07:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	Waynes	[09:08:22] ok, but thanks anyway [09:08:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	AbleBacon	[09:08:52] the irony is that 'char' and 'unsigned char' could actually be stored identically on your system [09:08:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	xaxxon	[09:09:38] AbleBacon, but can they be stored ironically? [09:09:38]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	ville	[09:09:50] so what's the deal with ranges, spans and views? lot of it seems to be just naming the same thing differently? [09:09:50]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	ville	[09:12:11] what's the relation between the three? some sort of hierarchy or more like a venn diagramm with some overlap? [09:12:11]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	w3z	[09:21:00] <<i,S::v; struct S{static int v; int f(int x=S::v){return x;}}; int i=S{}.f(); int g(){return 42;}  int S::v=g(); //contrived dynamic init brokenness [09:21:00]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	geordi	[09:21:01] 0, 42 [09:21:01]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	AbleBacon	[09:21:58] why would you ever want to 'union' an 'int' and a 'float'? [09:21:58]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:22:31] because some people think they are allowed to read the bit representation of a float that way [09:22:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:22:42] but that doesn't make sense with plain int, so i dunno [09:22:42]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	bumbar	[09:22:43] i'm getting undefined reference to template member function inside a nested class. function is specialized and defined in the header file, http://ideone.com/TJz3bP [09:22:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:23:33] !give bumbar testcase [09:23:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	nolyc	[09:23:34] bumbar: A testcase is the _least_ amount of code that replicates your problem, paste it to http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com and give us the link. Do _not_ paste code to the channel. See the testcase checklist at http://eel.is/iso-c++/testcase/ [09:23:34]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:23:47] bumbar: that doesn't reproduce whatever error you are seeing [09:23:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	AbleBacon	[09:24:00] yeah... in fact, it seems to be running fine... [09:24:00]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	bumbar	[09:24:47] urdh, it's split across multiple files [09:24:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	dminuoso_	[09:25:02] AbleBacon: There could be plenty reasons. One obvious could be that you're implementing a variant type, then a union is a great place to start. [09:25:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:25:10] bumbar, use wandbox then [09:25:10]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:25:18] http://melpon.org/wandbox/ [09:25:18]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	w3z	[09:25:50] hah someone broke clangs stdlib on wandbox, tsk tsk [09:25:50]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:26:22] lol wtf [09:26:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:27:03] only Clang HEAD though [09:27:03]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	dminuoso_	[09:27:28] Will a union always align the data according to the type with the largest alignment requirement? [09:27:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	w3z	[09:27:31] including string or iostream, seems to lead to conflicting definitions of swap errors, though they look the same in the error text [09:27:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:27:51] that's what you get when you don't have gated commits with good regression tests [09:27:51]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	w3z	[09:28:18] it was probably EricWF's fault :) [09:28:18]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:29:33] dminuoso_, http://eel.is/c++draft/class.union#2 [09:29:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:29:39] so, uh, "maybe"? [09:29:39]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:30:48] i can't read standardese, but it sounds like it has to since all members share address [09:30:48]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	dminuoso_	[09:32:04] Are such notes normative? [09:32:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	dminuoso_	[09:32:19] (I thought that notes without exceptions are non-normative in ISO) [09:32:19]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:32:42] well, they are I suppose [09:32:42]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	urdh	[09:32:59] but check what the note refers to as well [09:32:59]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	bumbar	[09:33:36] urdh, i can't reproduce it, but the structure is the same, http://melpon.org/wandbox/permlink/xe0IOV0ufAsedldw [09:33:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	dminuoso_	[09:34:21] urdh: I wonder if two union members are considered to be layout compatible then. [09:34:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	dminuoso_	[09:34:59] That according to [basic.compound] would mean that a pointer to each would hvae the same alignment. [09:34:59]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	dminuoso_	[09:35:40] urdh: Ohhh [expr.static.cast] is the key. [09:35:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	dminuoso_	[09:35:59] urdh: [...] If the original pointer value represents the address A of a byte in memory and A does not satisfy the alignment requirement of T, then the resulting pointer value is unspecified. Otherwise, if the original pointer value points to an object a, and there is an object b of type T (ignoring cv-qualification) that is pointer-interconvertible ([basic.compound]) with a, the result is a pointer to b. [09:35:59]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	dminuoso_	[09:36:05] [...] [09:36:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	dminuoso_	[09:36:44] urdh: And according to iso http://www.iso.org/schema/isosts/v1.1/doc/n-6ew0.html notes are indeed without exception non-normative. [09:36:44]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	elsewho	[09:45:59] hi, how can i deduce the type of a lambda expression C++11, or is it depending on the compiler implementation? [09:45:59]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	velco	[09:47:54] just like you deduce othre types: pass the lambda to a function template [09:47:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:20	w3z	[09:48:16] how old fashioned :) [09:48:16]

2016-10-18 00:19:49	AStorm	compiler says something cryptic like: error: use of 'decltype(auto) makeEventHandler(const char*, const string&)' before deduction of 'auto'

2016-10-18 00:20:33	AStorm	because the use is as parameter to a function with clearly defined type
2016-10-18 00:20:44	klys	if you're using auto you should replace it with the type you mean

2016-10-18 00:22:04	AStorm	yes, but the lambda type is special

2016-10-18 05:55:23	S4nD3r	I have an image (gray). Then, I need to mark, using a line, the part of image that I want the algorithm segment (the segmentation is based on the similarity of pixels. The segmentation is working properly.  What I need to do, is store the mark (that line that I did) and use it again to repeat the same simulation sometimes

2016-10-18 06:45:44	micros	does anyone know how to post a linux user input key event for KEY_VOLDOWN/UP where the input type is EV_REL?  when i do this, no event is processed under android.  If i use EV_KEY, it works OK, but this is not suitable for a rotary knob which provides only a relative offset when its turned.
