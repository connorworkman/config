2016-09-16 14:59:20	Kimryd	uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
2016-09-16 14:59:22	kerrang	i'd rather not stick everything into a drum machine, but i may have no choice
2016-09-16 14:59:32	Kimryd	let me czech
2016-09-16 14:59:36	Rory_	yeah i thought you had to use slicer
2016-09-16 15:00:15	bongofury	no shit
2016-09-16 15:00:46	Kimryd	kerrang, you want to map samplers to individual keys?
2016-09-16 15:00:54	kerrang	yeah
2016-09-16 15:01:05	bongofury	:(
2016-09-16 15:01:13	bongofury	thanks for the news Kimryd
2016-09-16 15:01:17	bongofury	they're all gone
2016-09-16 15:01:17	kerrang	i was looking at the midi mapping, but can't find a way to trigger a midi note
2016-09-16 15:01:26	bongofury	1st generation is all in the dust
2016-09-16 15:01:33	bongofury	Bob, Don, Rich
2016-09-16 15:01:39	bongofury	thuper thad
2016-09-16 15:01:54	Kimryd	kerrang, try
2016-09-16 15:02:05	Kimryd	drop a sample in sampler, right click, convert to multi-sample
2016-09-16 15:02:13	Kimryd	Then edit multisample
2016-09-16 15:02:24	Kimryd	you get this https://gyazo.com/bfe0e4dbf3bd50cb3b2311d2fa69f54f

2016-09-16 15:03:31	Kimryd	Otherwise you can try a mcguyver thingy by using note filters and note receivers and shit...
2016-09-16 15:05:30	kerrang	oh so that's how you get multisample
2016-09-16 15:05:41	Kimryd	That is how you get multisamplu
2016-09-16 15:05:58	Kimryd	I've never tried to slice in bitwig
2016-09-16 15:06:05	kerrang	that would make the drum machine more managable
2016-09-16 15:06:06	Kimryd	I rarely slice to begin with
2016-09-16 15:06:27	kerrang	eh i'm not slicing, but i just wanted to group certain samples together when i could
2016-09-16 15:06:35	Kimryd	o
2016-09-16 15:06:35	kerrang	multisample basically solves that
2016-09-16 15:06:58	Kimryd	Have you figured out how exactly dafuq the polyphonic LFOs work?
2016-09-16 15:07:05	Kimryd	Like, what makes it polyphonic?
2016-09-16 15:07:16	kerrang	plfo?
2016-09-16 15:07:20	Kimryd	Yes
2016-09-16 15:07:36	kerrang	nope

2016-09-16 15:11:20	kerrang	Kimryd: I think the name makes it pretty straight forward, an lfo for each voice basically
2016-09-16 15:11:32	kerrang	simulates the sum of an lfo per note on
2016-09-16 15:11:51	kerrang	at least thats what it seems like when i play with it with fm4

2016-09-16 15:12:35		[15:12]
2016-09-16 15:13:09	Kimryd	So, if I have a 5 note chord playing, and I set PLFO > Cutoff, then, it'll magically create 5 LFOs for the duration of the notes?
2016-09-16 15:13:21	Kimryd	Because that's what I see in my head but I'm going "naaaaaaaaaaaaaaah"
2016-09-16 15:16:30	kerrang	kinda, i think
2016-09-16 15:17:08	kerrang	it makes more sense when you think of an arpeggio instead, because then the same lfo (per voice) gets added in at different times
2016-09-16 15:17:18	kerrang	so you can better visualize the interference
2016-09-16 15:18:10	kerrang	if you have a basic midi chord without any humanization then all the simulated lfos just get summed together in phase
2016-09-16 15:18:17	Kimryd	OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
2016-09-16 15:18:19	Kimryd	Got it
2016-09-16 15:18:36	Kimryd	Right, that's why it wasn't making sense. I was imagining the notes triggering at the same time
2016-09-16 15:19:27	kerrang	yeah, kinda tricky to see without any mention in the manual about it
2016-09-16 15:19:42	kerrang	bitwig manual -> 4/10
2016-09-16 15:20:07	kerrang	though tbh i haven't looked at it in a while
2016-09-16 15:21:33	Kimryd	The manual fucking sucks
2016-09-16 15:22:01	kerrang	iirc i was so happy to see that it was a well designed manual, but it's missing so much content
2016-09-16 15:22:05	kerrang	heartbreaking
2016-09-16 15:23:07	Kimryd	I want to see a section in the manual titled "Why we made an oscilloscope before implementing any kind of spectrum"
2016-09-16 15:23:18	Kimryd	"and a cowbell synth"
2016-09-16 15:23:51	kerrang	right
2016-09-16 15:24:17	kerrang	it's surprsing to me that i can't drag around my multisample region, you have to set the range
2016-09-16 15:24:38	Kimryd	I don't know anything about that stuff at all
2016-09-16 15:25:31	kerrang	ableton didn't have multisamples right? (not talking about drum pad)
2016-09-16 15:26:10	Kimryd	Sampler does
2016-09-16 15:27:01	kerrang	and it just dawned on me that i can't treat samples differently

2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:32:29] but ya i think it's the background bass sound that's the problem, the melody is fine. but the background sound is more monotonous throughout the song [09:32:29]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:32:41] which kind of overshadows the more lively melody [09:32:41]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:33:44] yeah true [09:33:44]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:33:50] i never understood basslines [09:33:50]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:34:16] like you know how a lot of song [09:34:16]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:34:24] starts out with the bass, percussion, drum along with the melody [09:34:24]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:34:36] yup [09:34:36]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:35:00] and i just start with chords [09:35:00]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:35:04] then there's a switch, silence, the bass or percussion is cut out, and we have the drop where the melody becomes the focus [09:35:04]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:35:11] with a slight increase in volume and intensity [09:35:11]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:35:36] but there still needs to be a lot of bass in the drop or it sounds empty [09:35:36]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:36:20] maybe... but what i mean is, when the song is transitioning, that's when you can make those changes to make the song more lively [09:36:20]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:36:21] and dynamic [09:36:21]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:36:24] :> [09:36:24]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:36:51] sometimes less is more, so when you do use a certain sound again in the sound, it's more meaningful [09:36:51]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:37:13] yeah i think i get you [09:37:13]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:37:34] do you reckon i should make the lead more prominent [09:37:34]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:37:49] and the bass less so [09:37:49]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:37:51] by focusing the listener's ears to different instruments [09:37:51]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:38:05] sometimes it's the melody that's in focus, sometimes it's the beefy bass, percussion, etc [09:38:05]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:38:20] heh dont know, just play around with it! [09:38:20]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:38:35] hey you're right [09:38:35]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:38:37] others can help you mroe i'm sure. i've never even used a daw. i'm looking to start myself lol [09:38:37]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:39:06] you should man [09:39:06]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:39:15] it's fun but you'll hate yourself a lot [09:39:15]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:40:21] i just started learning the piano too, but i figured i could use this time to at least get familiar with a daw's interface, etc :D [09:40:21]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:41:32] go for it [09:41:32]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:41:36] what daw you have in mind? [09:41:36]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:41:56] the popular one seems to be fl studio and ableton [09:41:56]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:42:01] so i'm mostly considering these two [09:42:01]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:42:07] i use fl [09:42:07]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:42:15] like it? :D [09:42:15]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:42:46] yeah, it's really nice. i was a bit dumb and stayed away from tutorials and so didn't really progress in anything for ages tho [09:42:46]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:42:59] balance tutorials with practice [09:42:59]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:43:26] i've used it for about exactly a year now [09:43:26]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:44:00] here's my first song for comparison https://soundcloud.com/rorymadden/attempt-3/s-HBed5 [09:44:00]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	polyvox_	[09:44:01] ^ Reverse Play by Rory Madden [Soundcloud] [09:44:01]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:44:53] basically a mix of sytrus presets and 909s [09:44:53]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:45:12] good start! [09:45:12]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:45:24] lol [09:45:24]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:45:36] can defintely tell from the second song that you've progressed through the year :) [09:45:36]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:45:38] i remember for ages i thought it was super good [09:45:38]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:45:45] hahah thanks dude [09:45:45]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:45:47] ya it's really not bad! [09:45:47]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:46:45] i hope i'll be able to make something half decent with my first song :> [09:46:45]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:47:05] gotta go though, be back later! [09:47:05]

2016-09-17 12:46:45	kerrang	bitwig supports linux, though i haven't tried it on that os
2016-09-17 12:48:42	kerrang	there are linux-developed daws, like aurdor but i can't remember them or what the quality is like

2016-09-17 14:33:53	spudzee	[23:52:30] is reaktor 6 worth it? [23:52:30]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[23:57:38] its worth it if you get it in Komplete [23:57:38]

2016-09-17 14:33:53	kerrang	[00:01:18] iirc subsignal had it [00:01:18]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	kerrang	[00:01:23] someone had it [00:01:23]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:03:18] i dunno it looks really dope to me [00:03:18]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	spudzee	[00:03:25] I'm buying it [00:03:25]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:03:26] being able to use whole reaktor synths as modules [00:03:26]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:03:33] it supposedly sounds really good [00:03:33]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:03:41] and it seems so much more intuitive than Reaktor 5 [00:03:41]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:03:58] But paying for reaktor alone is a couple hundred shy of just getting Komplete 11 right? [00:03:58]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	 *	spudzee [00:04:09] grumbles [00:04:09]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	spudzee	[00:04:14] I don't really wanna spend that much [00:04:14]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	spudzee	[00:04:47] Komplete 11 is 3x as much [00:04:47]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:05:24] but so much more products [00:05:24]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:05:26] just get it than [00:05:26]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:05:27] 200 bux [00:05:27]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:05:34] well worth it still [00:05:34]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:05:35] just saying [00:05:35]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	spudzee	[00:06:09] I wonder... if I buy Komplete later will they give me a discount cause I already have Massive and Reaktor? [00:06:09]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:11:35] lol no [00:11:35]

2016-09-18 09:55:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: I love ambient stuff.
2016-09-18 09:55:11	kerrang	then i just suck at ambient then
2016-09-18 09:55:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	ambient, experimental, post-rock, avant garde jazz
2016-09-18 09:55:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	that's like 95% of what I listen to
2016-09-18 09:55:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	mostly japanese
2016-09-18 09:55:47	kerrang	why do i remember you not liking ambient music then, guess i'm thinking of someone else
2016-09-18 09:55:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	I don't like 'ambient techno'
2016-09-18 09:55:57	kerrang	and ofc it'd be japanese ;)

2016-09-18 09:56:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: is there a point where this evolves
2016-09-18 09:56:52	AdmiralBumbleBee	or is this the '6 seconds of music in 8 minutes' type of shit
2016-09-18 09:57:00	kerrang	kinda the latter
2016-09-18 09:57:08	kerrang	it's not suppose to evovle
2016-09-18 09:57:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	are you intentionally avoi..
2016-09-18 09:57:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	ok
2016-09-18 09:57:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	well
2016-09-18 09:57:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	I got bored of it
2016-09-18 09:57:25	kerrang	not surprised
2016-09-18 09:57:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	but maybe at least fill out the spectrum a bit more
2016-09-18 09:57:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'm not in the mood for this type of music, I wouldn't say that me getting bored of it is any indicator of 'badness'
2016-09-18 09:58:00	kerrang	so actually i'm kinda basing the sound of of some space em siganls
2016-09-18 09:58:14	kerrang	so suppose to be long, drony, dark
2016-09-18 09:58:44	kerrang	but yeah, it's not the most interesting thing in the world
2016-09-18 09:58:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'm sure you could get it in to a game
2016-09-18 09:59:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	but I'm sitting here listening to tricot, and it's pretty jarring to move to this
2016-09-18 09:59:11	kerrang	hahahah yeah i'd imagine
2016-09-18 09:59:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	from the 3 minutes I heard..
2016-09-18 09:59:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	I think you could probbaly do more with the spectral space
2016-09-18 09:59:48	AdmiralBumbleBee	without making it sound like 'more'
2016-09-18 10:00:23	kerrang	yeah, get some quite layers to fill up the top-end in a subtle manner
2016-09-18 10:01:54	kerrang	eh, maybe i'll daw now and see what i can do

2016-09-18 12:27:09	OneChainz	Would you say its necessarily a hard sound to recreate

2016-09-18 13:10:54	OneChainz	in the mean time, i need to figure out how to decay my sub properly so that it isn't constant.
2016-09-18 13:11:11	OneChainz	If i cut if off at the snare, it sounds really weird, but if i sidechain to the snare, it's too constant.

2016-09-18 13:13:01	adq	i would keep the first 2, maybe 3 seconds of the one with the glitch maybe, nothing more
2016-09-18 13:13:02	OneChainz	Oh i do. Each of my sub notes starts on a kick, and goes through until the next kick. I don't like how it sounds as it constant hits the bass then. I want it to sound like some of the trap songs out there where it decays out if that makes sense
2016-09-18 13:13:55	werbel	OneChainz Have you tried making the notes short? So it hits you but doesn't linger
2016-09-18 13:13:58	OneChainz	I know some songs just completely kil the bass on the snare, but it sounds weird when i do.
2016-09-18 13:14:37	adq	just fade out your bass before the next hit
2016-09-18 13:14:54	adq	you can do that in many ways
2016-09-18 13:16:57	OneChainz	I'll try cutting the nte and playing with release

2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:00:55] Anyone have an idea where one would start in recreating the first bass in Phiso-Jotaro? [22:00:55]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:01:19] would one go with Vocoding? Or pitchbends/FM? [22:01:19]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	wrl	[22:02:22] hey you should link us to the track so we don't have to engage in any strenuous googling [22:02:22]

2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:08:06] Main lead in the first drop [22:08:06]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	polyvox_	[22:08:06] ^ Phiso - Jotaro [YouTube] [22:08:06]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:08:47] Super metallic so I'm guessing fm/pitch bend [22:08:47]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	wrl	[22:18:07] yeah, sounds FM to me too [22:18:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:24:50] gonna mess around with serum i guess. not sure what wave table id want [22:24:50]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	adq	[22:25:38] sounds also comb filter + some disto + some stacked fx + some eq [22:25:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:26:42] by stacked fx i presume you mean a sleugh of serum fx like compression, reverb, etc? [22:26:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:27:09] Would you say its necessarily a hard sound to recreate [22:27:09]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	adq	[22:31:56] if you're not used to recreating sound (like me), yes ;) [22:31:56]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:34:11] I guess I can find a similar sound and modify it or something. I tried sampling it but hated how it sounded sampled [22:34:11]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	wrl	[22:38:13] also perhaps figure out why you want to duplicate the sound exactly instead of just making something that has the same effect and vibe [22:38:13]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	wrl	[22:38:21] straight up copying is some basic bitch shit [22:38:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:39:18] Possible remix idea [22:39:18]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:39:44] was going to use it for a little part of the song then throw in my own sound [22:39:44]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	wrl	[22:39:49] what is there to remix here besides the pre-drop vocal sample? [22:39:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:39:53] copy pasting the lead didnt sound right [22:39:53]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:40:27] I wanted to re work the drop. I mean, just messing around with it honestly. Most of the time I try to remix something it becomes it's own track [22:40:27]

2016-09-18 16:45:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	MSHMTX: and the people that make it past the stage where they still wanna know what an oscillator is, is about 1% of that.
2016-09-18 16:45:52	MSHMTX	yeah but there arent many advanced tutorials
2016-09-18 16:46:05	AdmiralBumbleBee	there aren't many advanced users that are idiots either :P

2016-09-18 16:46:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	the idea that an 'advanced user' needs a tutorial is a bit silly though, which is what I was poking fun at.

2016-09-18 16:49:01	MSHMTX	probable
2016-09-18 16:49:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	in my experience, the number of people that are passionate about music is a very small percentage of people that 'want to learn music'
2016-09-18 16:49:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	very small.
2016-09-18 16:49:48	AdmiralBumbleBee	so you have to realize that' we're a small section of another section of a sliver of ANOTHER sliver of the population.
2016-09-18 16:50:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	and I also think that most people figure 'if you made it this far, you've probably figured this out anyway' and don't think making a video about some advanced feature is worth it

2016-09-18 16:53:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	I have a bunch of random tutorials on youtube
2016-09-18 16:53:05	AdmiralBumbleBee	and that's certainly how I feel at least.
2016-09-18 16:53:19	MSHMTX	fair points for sure
2016-09-18 16:53:21	AdmiralBumbleBee	I have hundres on my computer (And various video sites)
2016-09-18 16:53:26	PersonaSound	saw it in my recommends on youtube but never checked it out
2016-09-18 16:53:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	and half the time I'm editing and I think "Well shit, if some dude even can understand this tutorial, he probably figured this out anyway..."
2016-09-18 16:53:46	MSHMTX	i think any kinda training beyond that is paid for or happens by knowing someone right place right time
2016-09-18 16:53:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	and then I get discouraged, half-ass it and don't put it on my channel

2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:47:35] MSHMTX: sure.. [02:47:35]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:47:53] MSHMTX: my point is, the number of people that want to know what an oscillator is outnumbers people like you by like 80,000:1 [02:47:53]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	MSHMTX	[02:48:03] lol [02:48:03]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:48:07] MSHMTX: so if people want their videos watched, what do you think they're going to choose to talk about? [02:48:07]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	MSHMTX	[02:48:11] what happens to all thos epeople do they just give up and use cymatics? [02:48:11]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:48:20] a. don't make it that far [02:48:20]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:48:28] b. give up when they realize bitches don't wanna date a dj [02:48:28]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:48:39] c. never liked music to begin with, and just wanted some ancillary benefit [02:48:39]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:48:48] d. discovered other passions [02:48:48]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:48:50] etc... [02:48:50]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	MSHMTX	[02:49:01] probable [02:49:01]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:49:19] in my experience, the number of people that are passionate about music is a very small percentage of people that 'want to learn music' [02:49:19]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:49:22] very small. [02:49:22]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:49:48] so you have to realize that' we're a small section of another section of a sliver of ANOTHER sliver of the population. [02:49:48]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:50:20] and I also think that most people figure 'if you made it this far, you've probably figured this out anyway' and don't think making a video about some advanced feature is worth it [02:50:20]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	MSHMTX	[02:52:40] i guess [02:52:40]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	MSHMTX	[02:53:00] PersonaSound, have you listened to Excisions Shambahla 2016 mix? [02:53:00]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:53:00] I have a bunch of random tutorials on youtube [02:53:00]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:53:05] and that's certainly how I feel at least. [02:53:05]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	MSHMTX	[02:53:19] fair points for sure [02:53:19]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:53:21] I have hundres on my computer (And various video sites) [02:53:21]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	PersonaSound	[02:53:26] saw it in my recommends on youtube but never checked it out [02:53:26]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:53:41] and half the time I'm editing and I think "Well shit, if some dude even can understand this tutorial, he probably figured this out anyway..." [02:53:41]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	MSHMTX	[02:53:46] i think any kinda training beyond that is paid for or happens by knowing someone right place right time [02:53:46]
2016-09-19 02:43:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:53:50] and then I get discouraged, half-ass it and don't put it on my channel [02:53:50]
2016-09-19 02:43:58	MSHMTX	[03:00:11] how good are you at editing [03:00:11]

2016-09-19 04:40:19	iamnew	hi guys, i have a question (maybe it is stupid but)
2016-09-19 04:41:26	iamnew	when i try to put some simple vocal phrase over some melody even if they are in the same key (sample title says so) it sounds like my ear is not prepared for it
2016-09-19 04:42:19	iamnew	i am not trying to make the most catchy song, i just want it to flow like water, when the listener hears it for first time, i dont know how to explain it better
2016-09-19 04:42:58	raz	be water my friend
2016-09-19 04:44:02	iamnew	sorry but i am not bruce lee

2016-09-19 04:45:59	raz	well, your question is impossible to answer
2016-09-19 04:46:05	raz	it is unspecific
2016-09-19 04:48:21	iamnew	@raz, i dont know how to explain it properly
2016-09-19 04:48:54	raz	then how do you expect us to answer a question that you can't ask?
2016-09-19 04:49:18	iamnew	@raz, how can i get the melody and vocal to sound good together, like when you listen for the first time the ear is prepared for it
2016-09-19 04:49:31	iamnew	@raz, not to sound like there is something wrong
2016-09-19 04:50:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	iamnew: that is totally contextual and style dependent.
2016-09-19 04:50:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	what the listener 'expects' depends on the style of music
2016-09-19 04:50:35	raz	yea, basically make it sound like other songs in your genre
2016-09-19 04:51:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	the melodic and harmonic expectations are all over the place for different genres
2016-09-19 04:51:15	raz	people tell me it also helps to be in key sometimes. but i don't really believe in that.
2016-09-19 04:51:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	if I'm writing some metalcore shit and not throwing minor 2 and tritones around, but every leap is a M3 P4 P5... it's going to sound awful
2016-09-19 04:51:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	or, it will sound like a new genre of music
2016-09-19 04:53:58	iamnew	hmm, since i am pretty noob at music theory, can you recommend on which topic should i read some books?
2016-09-19 04:53:58		[04:53]
2016-09-19 04:54:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	no
2016-09-19 04:54:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	go listen to some music and copy it.
2016-09-19 04:54:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	I can recommend books, but it won't help you
2016-09-19 04:54:30	AdmiralBumbleBee	go listen to some of your favorite songs and transcribe them
2016-09-19 04:54:37	AdmiralBumbleBee	that will get you where you want to go WAY faster.
2016-09-19 04:54:42	iamnew	i can make good melodies but only when they are played alone, when i try to make it more complex, put some more melodies on top it doesnt sound very good
2016-09-19 04:55:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	just go do what I said for 3-4 of your favorite songs
2016-09-19 04:55:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	harmony and melody AND rhythm.
2016-09-19 04:55:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	then try on your own again
2016-09-19 04:55:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	I guarantee it will be significantly better
2016-09-19 04:56:29	iamnew	also i have another stupid question
2016-09-19 04:57:08	iamnew	how can there be so much unique music when there are just 12 notes, and almost all EDM music is in minor scale
2016-09-19 05:01:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	most edm isn't minor scale
2016-09-19 05:01:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	iamnew: think of how many combinations of those notes are, with different timbres, expressions, rhythms
2016-09-19 05:03:51	iamnew	@AdmiralBumbleBee: my music library is 80% minor scales, and this post also confirms that: https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/smii1/til_most_of_edm_tracks_are_composed_in_minor_keys/
2016-09-19 05:03:52	polyvox_	^ TIL Most of EDM tracks are composed in Minor keys : edmproduction
2016-09-19 05:05:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	iamnew: that does not confirm what you said
2016-09-19 05:05:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	read again
2016-09-19 05:05:28	AdmiralBumbleBee	80% of 700 songs in one person's collection is.
2016-09-19 05:06:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	but let's just go ahead and assume that it's somehow correct
2016-09-19 05:06:18	AdmiralBumbleBee	then what?
2016-09-19 05:06:21	AdmiralBumbleBee	why does that matter at all?

2016-09-19 05:13:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	to your original question about complexity, assume a totally diatonic 3 note melody of 3 octaves
2016-09-19 05:13:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	that gives you over 12,000 possible combinations of notes

2016-09-19 05:13:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	add a second instrument with the same restriction, now you have 144+million combinations of notes.
2016-09-19 05:14:00	therue	meow :)
2016-09-19 05:14:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	2 instruments, 3 pitches.
2016-09-19 05:14:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	now add in the infinite rhythmic variation
2016-09-19 05:14:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	expression (filters, pitch modulation, timber modulations of various sorts)
2016-09-19 05:14:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	harmonic interactions
2016-09-19 05:14:48	AdmiralBumbleBee	you could make A LOT of very different sounding music with 3 notes.
2016-09-19 05:14:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	(in fact, and infinite amount of variation)

2016-09-19 05:26:55	iamnew	the plugins compared to ableton are not that good, but the workflow, the routing
2016-09-19 05:27:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	yeah, I don't own bitwig (since I have live and barely even touch that anyway)...
2016-09-19 05:27:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	but I totally agree with iamnew, just from using the demo twice
2016-09-19 05:27:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's a better program unless you can afford live Suite, then suite is a better value
2016-09-19 05:28:20	iamnew	you can do almost anything with shortcuts, with the mouse wheel you can zoom in zoom out scroll left/right
2016-09-19 05:29:33	iamnew	there is built in device called audio mod, which lets you controll every parameter of the plugins based on the incoming signal
2016-09-19 05:30:25	therue	there's also a great game that just came out that i plan on playing on windows anyway :P and i'm also kind of interested in demoscene, so being able use the platform the program will be running on is also another reason
2016-09-19 05:31:07	therue	of course there will be things i'll miss about linux, but i'll have the laptop for that
2016-09-19 05:31:47	iamnew	bitwig is cross platform, whatever you choose, i highly recommend you try it
2016-09-19 05:32:03	therue	oooh i see
2016-09-19 05:32:06	iamnew	i sound like i am marketing it, but just try it
2016-09-19 05:32:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	therue: which game
2016-09-19 05:32:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	therue: also yeah... you really need to try bitwig. I don't even own the shit, and I don't like how the company works... but it's great software.

2016-09-19 14:24:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	I REALLY like the new interface builder
2016-09-19 14:24:38	AdmiralBumbleBee	and swift 3 is a big improvement

2016-09-19 14:25:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	all?
2016-09-19 14:25:02	kerrang	i completely forgot there was a new xcode, had to go through the usual "accept new license" which fucked my openssl lib

2016-09-19 14:28:33	Ycros	yeah it'll be fun to see if I can get it working

2016-09-19 14:33:17	kerrang	kinda need multiple threads for any audio app, right?
2016-09-19 14:33:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	nah
2016-09-19 14:34:26	kerrang	tbh when it comes to plugins, i'm too confused about how threads are handled because the sdks seem to handle that
2016-09-19 14:35:02	Ycros	kerrang: your audio processing runs on one thread, all your other crap (like ui, midi handling, automation) runs on another
2016-09-19 14:35:55	kerrang	yeah that i get, i guess it's confusing to me because the plugin class you work has functions called in different threads
2016-09-19 14:36:08	Ycros	yep
2016-09-19 14:36:31	kerrang	so that one class needs to be super thread-friendly if you're going to create other threads for midi, ui, and io
2016-09-19 14:36:38	AdmiralBumbleBee	well, it depends on the host and api
2016-09-19 14:37:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	with vst2, it was entirely possible that all your shit got thrown on a single thread unless you forked
2016-09-19 14:37:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	then they changed that in 2.2 iirc?
2016-09-19 14:37:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	AU can still part you in a single context
2016-09-19 14:37:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	park
2016-09-19 14:37:29	Ycros	I don't even know how au works
2016-09-19 14:37:50	Ycros	I've only been directly working with newer vst 2 (and peeking at 3)
2016-09-19 14:38:42	kerrang	vst is my only aim since it's cross-platform, au(2 and 3) would be next on my list if i was comfortable with vst3
2016-09-19 14:38:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	well if you use vst3
2016-09-19 14:39:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	you get au for free
2016-09-19 14:39:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	if you use juce, you get everything for free (pace may be required)
2016-09-19 14:39:12	kerrang	they're similar i'm guessing?
2016-09-19 14:39:45	kerrang	oh nvm, yeah if i used juce for dev that's true
2016-09-19 14:40:17	kerrang	i just dislike juce because it encouraged bad audio dev practices without providing warnings
2016-09-19 14:40:44	kerrang	"hey you can use this parameter class, but just know it's not thread-safe" <- stuff new audio dev wouldn't necessarily know
2016-09-19 14:42:42	Ycros	kerrang: did you get a vst ui going from rust?
2016-09-19 14:43:04	Ycros	conrod has been getting a whole lot of dev, I'm going to try it
2016-09-19 14:43:29	kerrang	Ycros: no, i had to pull myself away from that project for a while. conrod was always going to be my choice for ui though
2016-09-19 14:43:46	_Hex_	do VST3 please
2016-09-19 14:43:47	_Hex_	fuck vst2

2016-09-19 14:43:49	kerrang	i forgot my rationale, but i had decided an immediate-mode ui made sense
2016-09-19 14:43:50	Ycros	it seems like the author is also building audio things based on some of the example screenshots

2016-09-19 14:46:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	reaper has vst3, but it's missing things
2016-09-19 14:46:15	_Hex_	i honestly think most of them do now
2016-09-19 14:47:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	so sonar is apparently missing part of the spec
2016-09-19 14:47:48	AdmiralBumbleBee	specifically preset handling (a huge part of it)
2016-09-19 14:47:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	so is samplitude
2016-09-19 14:47:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	reaper too
2016-09-19 14:47:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	not sure about fl
2016-09-19 14:48:01	_Hex_	they probably go with their own preset handling
2016-09-19 14:48:10	_Hex_	but really..most support using vst3 plugs
2016-09-19 14:48:14	_Hex_	maybe it's not 100% complete
2016-09-19 14:48:19	_Hex_	but vst3 is a damn sight better than vst2
2016-09-19 14:48:30	AdmiralBumbleBee	what do you like about vst3 over 2?
2016-09-19 14:48:42	Ycros	the 3 makes it way more aesthetic

2016-09-20 02:45:45	Nahck	been thinking about doepfers dc offset/polarizer/attenuator
2016-09-20 02:49:19	robotika	do you rock the modular? i guess, the answer is yes

2016-09-20 02:53:31	Nahck	distings on my shopping list for sure
2016-09-20 02:54:03	Nahck	and a phaser and a multimode  svf

2016-09-20 06:36:15	_Hex_	which i disagree with
2016-09-20 06:36:18	_Hex_	but oh well
2016-09-20 06:36:55	PersonaSound	that reminds me; what ratios would you use on a compressor for glueing things
2016-09-20 06:37:07	_Hex_	i guess that's what happens when you have a marketing guy making the tutorial vids
2016-09-20 06:37:21	PersonaSound	a retarded questions but i normally use 10:1:0 (?)  when smashing my high and mids on a bass
2016-09-20 06:37:23	_Hex_	depends the glue but usually low ratio, slow attack, long release
2016-09-20 06:37:35	PersonaSound	a slow attack?
2016-09-20 06:37:36	_Hex_	jesus..10:1 is pretty excessive for glue
2016-09-20 06:37:54	_Hex_	also depends on your definition of glue
2016-09-20 06:38:28	PersonaSound	well, i
2016-09-20 06:39:29	PersonaSound	i normally try to glue my mid and high back together on a bass after filtering, distorting, and fx processing each band
2016-09-20 06:40:09	PersonaSound	i try to glue the frequencies back together so that the bass still has some dynamics while all bands are equally leveled, no harsh high end

2016-09-20 08:12:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	probably toss on a high-pass too, then just some moderate compression, a very mild reverb and listen again
2016-09-20 08:12:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	then take it all off
2016-09-20 08:12:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	and start over
2016-09-20 08:13:15	AdmiralBumbleBee	after you listen
2016-09-20 08:13:18	Saint_Isidore	Do I just click on the high pass or do I need to adjust it as well
2016-09-20 08:13:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	doesn't matter too much

2016-09-20 08:15:59	AdmiralBumbleBee	no, that's how much gain reduction the compressor is doing
2016-09-20 08:16:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	so...
2016-09-20 08:16:04	Saint_Isidore	oh
2016-09-20 08:16:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	the meter should be bouncing on the -5

2016-09-20 11:09:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	so if you have 25.5' for instance
2016-09-20 11:09:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	find the distance between 25 and 26 with your ruler
2016-09-20 11:09:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	maybe it's 18mm, let's say that
2016-09-20 11:09:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	multiply that by the decimal seconds (0.5)
2016-09-20 11:10:09	AdmiralBumbleBee	and you know that your coord is 9mm perpendicular to 25'

2016-09-20 11:12:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	no, you'll get this.
2016-09-20 11:12:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	let's imagine that you need to plot something between 25 and 26 minutes
2016-09-20 11:12:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	ok?
2016-09-20 11:12:55	Estr	ok
2016-09-20 11:13:18	AdmiralBumbleBee	so
2016-09-20 11:13:18		[11:13]
2016-09-20 11:13:30	AdmiralBumbleBee	take your ruler and find the distance on your map between 25 and 26 inutes
2016-09-20 11:13:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	for this thought exercise, we'll assume that it's 18mm
2016-09-20 11:13:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	ok?
2016-09-20 11:13:59	Estr	ok
2016-09-20 11:14:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	so what we want to figure out, is how many mm ar in 1 second
2016-09-20 11:14:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	right?
2016-09-20 11:14:22	Estr	yes
2016-09-20 11:14:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	so first, you need your seconds in decimal
2016-09-20 11:14:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	if it's 25.5'... we know our seconds are everything after the .
2016-09-20 11:15:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	so 0.5
2016-09-20 11:15:15	AdmiralBumbleBee	if you saw 25' 30"... you need to convert seconds to decimal (still 0.5) there
2016-09-20 11:15:28	AdmiralBumbleBee	if you see 25' 0.5"... obviously it's 0.5
2016-09-20 11:15:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	following?
2016-09-20 11:15:52	Estr	yes
2016-09-20 11:16:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	so ALL you need to do
2016-09-20 11:16:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	is multiple decimal seconds by the physical measurement that 1 minute is.
2016-09-20 11:16:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	so 0.5 * 18mm
2016-09-20 11:16:37	AdmiralBumbleBee	and that means that 0.5 seconds is exactly 9mm away from 25 minutes on your map
2016-09-20 11:17:17	Estr	thats more accurate
2016-09-20 11:17:21	Estr	but its still not 110% accurate
2016-09-20 11:17:32	Estr	how do they get it accurate at boats?

2016-09-20 11:56:43	Estr	so there's no explenation
2016-09-20 11:57:03	adq	if  1 knot = 1,852 km/h is true, then a knot is a speed unit which is often under the hood (distance unit / time unit)
2016-09-20 11:57:12	adq	because s = d/t
2016-09-20 11:57:26	adq	later on you will see physics and acceleration maybe
2016-09-20 11:57:31	adq	which is another story
2016-09-20 11:57:56	adq	the derivative of accelleration is the speed

2016-09-20 11:59:39	Estr	after 2 years of apprentice and military and all that stuff I'll go to university
2016-09-20 11:59:40	adq	well more seriously Estr, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-multiplication
2016-09-20 11:59:41	polyvox_	^ Cross-multiplication - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
2016-09-20 11:59:47	Estr	and I've heard that the math there is very advanced
2016-09-20 11:59:56	adq	when you move stuff in your equation, and if everything has an associated unit
2016-09-20 12:00:10	adq	you can always find what it will be if you move "something"
2016-09-20 12:00:23	adq	impossible for me to explain in english properly it seems lol
2016-09-20 12:01:25	adq	like you could say: 1852km = 1 knot/h or etc..
2016-09-20 12:01:49	adq	oops i'm even wrong
2016-09-20 12:02:01	adq	1852km = 1 knot.h
2016-09-20 12:02:16	adq	or 1 knot/h⁻¹
2016-09-20 12:03:23	adq	slightly you should see why some weird units exist, like m/s² or  m·s⁻²
2016-09-20 12:03:28	Estr	1,852m*
2016-09-20 12:03:53	Estr	i mean km*
2016-09-20 12:04:43	adq	so next time, always verify that the unit(s) in your left part of the equal sign matches the unit(s) of your right side
2016-09-20 12:04:47	adq	if not, something is wrong
2016-09-20 12:05:05	adq	you would then have spotted you cannot have time = distance
2016-09-20 12:05:33	Estr	You're confusing me even more :^)
2016-09-20 12:05:51	adq	but this time i really wanted to help you :)
2016-09-20 12:07:08	adq	you need to familiarize yourself with moving stuff from left to right or right to left, from numerator to denominator or the contrary, etc
2016-09-20 12:07:27	adq	that's fundamental

2016-09-20 16:41:51	MSHMTX	now i feel like all the more active users make alternative type stuff
2016-09-20 16:42:09	kerrang	well i know i was one of those
2016-09-20 16:42:28	MSHMTX	no joke though it was all big room, electro, and neuro in here
2016-09-20 16:42:28	kerrang	got here to make edm, now i just complain about how most of it is bad
2016-09-20 16:42:47	MSHMTX	it has gotten bad hasnt it
2016-09-20 16:43:00	kerrang	and talk to all the people who actuall know stuff about production (cause no one else irl is interested in it)
2016-09-20 16:43:58	MSHMTX	how do u know the ppl u think know what theyre talking about know?
2016-09-20 16:44:45	kerrang	cause they make good music
2016-09-20 16:44:50	kerrang	so they know something
2016-09-20 16:45:31	kerrang	plus, come on, some people here have years of studio experience
2016-09-20 16:49:41	kerrang	heh, i kinda miss the days when my friends were interested in making music

2016-09-20 17:37:46	DylanT	I remember mixing on my monitors when I was using them... it sounds completely different ... I feel like when I mix in my headphones the whole sound sounds way different

2016-09-20 17:38:07	DylanT	Gonna start mixing lower

2016-09-20 17:55:56	kerrang	DylanT: bitwig

2016-09-20 17:56:22	_Hex_	?
2016-09-20 17:56:28	_Hex_	because if you're using peak meters when mixing
2016-09-20 17:56:32	_Hex_	you're doing it wrong
2016-09-20 17:56:37	_Hex_	they are next to useless

2016-09-20 17:57:48	kerrang	that's normal depending on how much you actually daw
2016-09-20 17:58:00	kerrang	if you don't do it regularly, you'll forget stuff
2016-09-20 17:58:06	_Hex_	read up on k-system metering
2016-09-20 17:58:15	_Hex_	that'll probaby be the most helpful
2016-09-20 17:58:30	_Hex_	that way you can see peak + average loudness and calibrate your environment

2016-09-20 18:49:18	_Hex_	a different metering system which is tied to monitoring
2016-09-20 18:49:22	_Hex_	so you can make better decisions
2016-09-20 18:49:31	_Hex_	and eliminate some of the guesswork
2016-09-20 18:49:48	_Hex_	because..really..peak meters don't help much at all
2016-09-20 18:50:06	_Hex_	there are way better standards out there now too

2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:25:42] he could have learned to not mix with peak meters [04:25:42]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:46:37] here you go dylan: http://www.aes.org/technical/documentDownloads.cfm?docID=65 [04:46:37]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	DylanT	[04:48:32] I wonder what the general gist im gonna learn from this article will be. [04:48:32]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:49:17] a different metering system which is tied to monitoring [04:49:17]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:49:22] so you can make better decisions [04:49:22]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:49:31] and eliminate some of the guesswork [04:49:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:49:48] because..really..peak meters don't help much at all [04:49:48]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:50:06] there are way better standards out there now too [04:50:06]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	DylanT	[04:50:16] Hmm [04:50:16]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:50:17] but i've yet to figure out how to integrate them into music [04:50:17]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	DylanT	[04:51:48] Feels like I need analog gear or something.. Lol [04:51:48]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:52:10] no..but you can use plug-ins which show you VU style metering [04:52:10]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:52:19] although your DAW should have k-system meters [04:52:19]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	DylanT	[04:52:20] Ah [04:52:20]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:52:23] and if not..there are free plugs [04:52:23]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:52:40] peaks show..err..peaks [04:52:40]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:52:53] but they don't show shit with regards to avergae level..or perceived loudness [04:52:53]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	***	Playback Complete.
2016-09-20 18:53:20	_Hex_	and i guess ultimately you're probably trying to mix "loud" without it being crushed
2016-09-20 18:53:50	_Hex_	so you have that perceived power without squashing to oblivion in an attempt to raise the perceived loudness
2016-09-20 18:54:11	DylanT	I see

2016-09-20 19:06:09	|aaron	well ive tried to separate vocals out from a few different tracks using the polyphonic sustain mode
2016-09-20 19:06:22	|aaron	they were lossless source so no issue there

2016-09-20 19:07:09	|aaron	it just didnt separate out the vocals effectively. i even turn up the sensitivity in note edit mode to max but still it was all mushed together
2016-09-20 19:07:24	|aaron	ive had the same result with the last 4 tracks ive tried
2016-09-20 19:07:54	_Hex_	wait..are you trying to separate vocals from a mix?
2016-09-20 19:07:59	|aaron	yeah
2016-09-20 19:08:05	|aaron	its an advertised feature
2016-09-20 19:08:09	_Hex_	oh..no..no chance
2016-09-20 19:08:19	|aaron	haha ok
2016-09-20 19:08:27	|aaron	wont waste anymore time on that then lol

2016-09-20 19:09:07	_Hex_	yeah..that's near impossible at this point in technology
2016-09-20 19:09:22	|aaron	or a simpler example even, trying to pitch an acapella. it works except for the blobs that have vibrato, even if i turn the vibrato down with the tool it still sounds like ass if i change the pitch at all
2016-09-20 19:09:29	_Hex_	yep
2016-09-20 19:09:41	_Hex_	i thought you were talking about using it more for pitch correction
2016-09-20 19:09:45	_Hex_	monophonic
2016-09-20 19:10:01	|aaron	well in this example thats what i mean
2016-09-20 19:10:02	_Hex_	i've only had good results on the polyphonic side with single instruments
2016-09-20 19:10:11	_Hex_	e.g. fixing bad pitch on an acoustic guitar part
2016-09-20 19:10:24	|aaron	gotcha

2016-09-20 19:10:31	_Hex_	for fixing vibrato on a single vox
2016-09-20 19:10:36	_Hex_	you really need to split things up
2016-09-20 19:10:46	_Hex_	so you leave that initial part alone
2016-09-20 19:10:59	_Hex_	and gradually fix the tial

2016-09-20 19:11:08	_Hex_	rather than going all in on it

2016-09-20 19:11:47	|aaron	sigh so much for the diy acapella dream lol
2016-09-20 19:11:52	_Hex_	heh
2016-09-20 19:11:53	|aaron	maybe in 10 years
2016-09-20 19:12:04	_Hex_	you can usually find acapellas for shit out there
2016-09-20 19:12:07	_Hex_	if you look hard enough

2016-09-20 19:13:36	_Hex_	that's the technical article btw
2016-09-20 19:13:41	_Hex_	if you do a good search
2016-09-20 19:13:49	_Hex_	there are guys who have broken it down into layman's terms
2016-09-20 19:13:52	_Hex_	and it's far easier to digest
2016-09-20 19:13:52	DylanT	So there ARE plugins for VU meters?
2016-09-20 19:13:56	_Hex_	oh 100%
2016-09-20 19:13:58	_Hex_	tons of them

2016-09-21 13:41:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	gotta keep my weeb status intact
2016-09-21 13:41:24	lums	and then work with a limited set until i want more features(have more money)
2016-09-21 13:41:36	MSHMTX	is the ipad version prettier
2016-09-21 13:41:37	MSHMTX	?
2016-09-21 13:41:39	Ycros	lums: I have a 4ms dual looping delay, which is rad. It's a very clean clocked delay
2016-09-21 13:41:48	AdmiralBumbleBee	MSHMTX: yes, way better than ps2 or psp versions
2016-09-21 13:42:14	lums	sweet
2016-09-21 13:42:17	MSHMTX	like right at the timestamp?
2016-09-21 13:42:43	_Hex_	yeah
2016-09-21 13:42:50	MSHMTX	its like a square pluck
2016-09-21 13:42:57	MSHMTX	with some like screamy filter
2016-09-21 13:43:09	AdmiralBumbleBee	MSHMTX: can you find the preset that matches it
2016-09-21 13:43:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	is the question ^
2016-09-21 13:43:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	or comes close I guess
2016-09-21 13:43:18	_Hex_	basically..yeah...
2016-09-21 13:43:27	MSHMTX	i think the screamy part might just be a layer
2016-09-21 13:43:30	_Hex_	i'm having to basically mix a re-creation of this track today
2016-09-21 13:43:37	_Hex_	and the sound they've got there
2016-09-21 13:43:40	_Hex_	is just terrible
2016-09-21 13:43:44	MSHMTX	AdmiralBumbleBee for what?
2016-09-21 13:43:47	_Hex_	they haven't matched it at all
2016-09-21 13:43:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	MSHMTX: for the sound _Hex_ linked.
2016-09-21 13:43:58	MSHMTX	any synth?
2016-09-21 13:44:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	serum
2016-09-21 13:44:14	Ycros	lums: if you're running external stuff in then you'll want the rosie or some other way of gaining your external signal, modular audio typically sits at -5 to 5V (or 10V peak to peak), your other gear is probably sitting at under 4V peak to peak
2016-09-21 13:44:33	MSHMTX	let me hear theirs?
2016-09-21 13:44:33	MSHMTX	lol
2016-09-21 13:44:34	Ycros	or less depending on the gear :P

2016-09-21 13:46:26	Ycros	although many external mixers will handle the levels ok
2016-09-21 13:47:40	lums	ah yeah, haven't read up on that yet
2016-09-21 13:47:55	lums	colin benders is great
2016-09-21 13:52:58	Ycros	lums: the rosie module that you added does both those things
2016-09-21 13:54:06	Ycros	or does it
2016-09-21 13:54:10	MSHMTX	I could prob make it im gonna try

2016-09-21 13:55:43	Ycros	lol
2016-09-21 13:55:47	_Hex_	so it's easier to just re-do some sounds
2016-09-21 13:55:53	_Hex_	i often replace kicks/snares/claps
2016-09-21 13:55:57	_Hex_	in fact..nearly always
2016-09-21 13:57:00	Ycros	there's been this youtuber collaboration alliance thing going on recently, and mr. bill just posted a video.. where he was supposed to just mix and finalise the track... but there's 8 hours of footage and he's basically written a new track

2016-09-21 14:54:46	_Hex_	which part in particular
2016-09-21 14:54:56	_Hex_	it's actually not worlds away from the version i have to mathc
2016-09-21 14:55:02	_Hex_	it's all pitched down from the actual original
2016-09-21 14:56:23	kerrang	well the vocals for sure, i think it's just too washed out and get a sharp resonance when vocalist tries to be loud

2016-09-21 14:59:57	kerrang	even then
2016-09-21 15:00:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'd probably have guess like 70-80...

2016-09-21 15:02:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	if you're good about managing automation, you can work 'single-track' like just fine
2016-09-21 15:02:47	kerrang	really? it makes sense to me for recorded instruments, but on electronic tracks i imagine there being different synths per section
2016-09-21 15:02:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	but most DAWs are shit or annoying
2016-09-21 15:02:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	for handling automation
2016-09-21 15:03:26	kerrang	true, that's something i've told myself to try but usually can dude to lack of cpu power
2016-09-21 15:03:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: you can automate anything in modern synths...
2016-09-21 15:03:38	kerrang	so i usually have to restrict myself to a single track for a synth

2016-09-21 15:06:31	kerrang	for me, i think it's also a composition thing. i get too stuck on one idea instead of trying new melodies on the same synth
2016-09-21 15:07:20	kerrang	then i end up with a track that has the same pad for 8 minutes with little to no changes ;)

2016-09-21 15:30:53	_Hex_	and landlords basically do fixed term leases
2016-09-21 15:31:01	_Hex_	so at the end of your lease (a year) they kick you
2016-09-21 15:31:06	_Hex_	which in reality means you can stay

2016-09-21 15:31:23	senses	i have a dog, so i'm limited to actual houses. he needs a backyard even though he's an inside dog. also, can't stand having neighbors -so- close by.

2016-09-21 17:01:25	senses	success is also measured by what you value. success for one person is not the same as another. success doesn't have to = mone. for me, success is more about having a particular lifestyle be sustainable.

2016-09-21 17:02:47	senses	yeah
2016-09-21 17:03:01	kerrang	i believe that you shouldn't be pressured into going to college unless you want to (because you want to study a subject, or because you want that BA/BS)
2016-09-21 17:03:30	kerrang	but if you want to make a certain amount of income per year, you'll most likely need a college degree
2016-09-21 17:03:30	|aaron	yeah thats kinda my point. it really is NOT the best idea for a significant amount of people
2016-09-21 17:03:34	Ycros	do it for the riiiight reasons
2016-09-21 17:03:47	senses	especially if you're young. i went to college when i was 18 because i thought it was what i -should- do, but i ended up goofing off and blowing it because it wasn't right for me at the time. i should've just waited until i was older, when i knew what i wanted to do.
2016-09-21 17:03:57	|aaron	i guess. if you want to make real money in america you need to go into business for yourself, and a degree is an obstacle to that

2016-09-21 17:43:55	senses	ok, figured there would be. can't picture how big it would be though.
2016-09-21 17:43:56	Ycros	yeah you could, though in practice people tend to go mm, cm, m
2016-09-21 17:44:02	Kimryd	10 cm
2016-09-21 17:44:08	Ycros	yeah

2016-09-21 17:44:45	Ycros	I think generally cm is used for people's height

2016-09-21 17:56:00	_Hex_	the tldr; would be you can mix to a "0" average on a k-12 meter
2016-09-21 17:56:09	_Hex_	if peaks go above that..your material is too dynamic
2016-09-21 17:56:16	Ycros	it's really about relative volumes and maximising the use of faders and such. And uh, being careful around some plugins which expect a certain incoming level
2016-09-21 17:56:17	DylanT	Yeah cause peak metering is different than the average and vu
2016-09-21 17:56:26	_Hex_	if there is minimal peak information then your material isn't dynamic enough

2016-09-21 18:05:02	DylanT	Ok, so what are 'stems'?
2016-09-21 18:05:19	DylanT	And why do producers bounce them
2016-09-21 18:05:38	Ycros	it's a multi-track rendering of your project
2016-09-21 18:05:46	Saint_Is_	its not a stem until it has been bounced (per track)
2016-09-21 18:05:49	Ycros	they're bounced to audio because peolpe use different daws, plugins
2016-09-21 18:05:56	DylanT	Ah
2016-09-21 18:06:24	senses	helpful for sending to someone else to remix or for live performance.

2016-09-21 18:06:51	DylanT	ah
2016-09-21 18:06:54	Ycros	yeah. You might also choose to group or bus certain tracks and render out a particular set of stems
2016-09-21 18:07:12	Ycros	like if you're doing a live performance, you might want to think about which elements you'd like to mix and combine from different projects, and it what ways
2016-09-21 18:07:21	Ycros	and render out a number of stems to conform to that
2016-09-21 18:07:47	DylanT	cool
2016-09-21 18:07:54	kerrang	related, do people just renders from master to include sends in stems?
2016-09-21 18:08:37	Ycros	kerrang: you bounce out the sends
2016-09-21 18:08:41	Ycros	or the returns rather
2016-09-21 18:09:34	DylanT	sends,returns is foreign language to me xD
2016-09-21 18:09:40	DylanT	Anyway
2016-09-21 18:10:27	_Hex_	the send/return config basically takes a split of the signal (where in the chain depends on the DAW) and the "return" is where it appears
2016-09-21 18:10:29	kerrang	eh, don't see how boucing a return would work when multiple tracks use a send track
2016-09-21 18:10:36	_Hex_	so rather than inserting a reverb on 10 drum tracks
2016-09-21 18:10:42	XMPPwocky	fml... jamming out in renoise and it crashes
2016-09-21 18:10:44	_Hex_	you can create a reverb "return"

2016-09-22 00:23:54	kerrang	[04:10:29] eh, don't see how boucing a return would work when multiple tracks use a send track [04:10:29]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	_Hex_	[04:10:36] so rather than inserting a reverb on 10 drum tracks [04:10:36]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	XMPPwocky	[04:10:42] fml... jamming out in renoise and it crashes [04:10:42]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	_Hex_	[04:10:44] you can create a reverb "return" [04:10:44]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	XMPPwocky	[04:10:49] since when does renoise crash [04:10:49]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	_Hex_	[04:10:50] and send splits from all those drums to that reverb [04:10:50]

2016-09-22 00:23:54	DylanT	[04:27:39] Hmm [04:27:39]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	DylanT	[04:27:47] Theres no VU metering effect on Ableton is  there? [04:27:47]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	DylanT	[04:27:55] Or how do I check [04:27:55]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	_Hex_	[04:28:40] The Meter shows both peak and RMS output levels for the track. While monitoring, however, it shows peak and RMS input levels. Peak meters show sudden changes in level, while RMS meters give a better impression of perceived loudness. [04:28:40]

2016-09-22 06:52:03	_Hex_	i like the look of that studio
2016-09-22 06:53:00	Kadabra	Are those all touch screens
2016-09-22 06:53:19	_Hex_	yeah
2016-09-22 06:53:24	_Hex_	i'd prefer faders actually
2016-09-22 06:53:28	_Hex_	but i like the nice and clean look
2016-09-22 06:54:06	bongofury	nice look
2016-09-22 06:54:18	bongofury	i too prefer mechanical faders
2016-09-22 06:54:27	bongofury	i guess those are trimpots on the table?
2016-09-22 06:54:47	_Hex_	i think that's his monitoring station
2016-09-22 06:59:54	bongofury	had to look up "Ney-Fi"
2016-09-22 07:01:27	_Hex_	does your DAW support eucon?
2016-09-22 07:02:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	I actually just got in to pro tools|control 3 days ago
2016-09-22 07:02:32	_Hex_	it's pretty awesome
2016-09-22 07:02:36	_Hex_	although i don't have an ipad
2016-09-22 07:02:37	AdmiralBumbleBee	fairly interesting how much of a better app that is than cubase IC
2016-09-22 07:02:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	or DP's contrlo app
2016-09-22 07:02:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	like way better
2016-09-22 07:02:46	_Hex_	oh completely
2016-09-22 07:02:47	_Hex_	although
2016-09-22 07:02:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	and it's better than v-contrl, which I was using before
2016-09-22 07:03:01	_Hex_	i was amazed at the android "app" steinberg abandoned
2016-09-22 07:03:22	bongofury	jesus christ the police in the US are out of fuckin control
2016-09-22 07:03:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	was there a different one than cubase IC?
2016-09-22 07:03:28	bongofury	oops wrong #
2016-09-22 07:03:30	_Hex_	there was cubase IC pro
2016-09-22 07:03:33	_Hex_	for android
2016-09-22 07:03:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	yeah ic pro
2016-09-22 07:03:38	_Hex_	but it ran in the browser
2016-09-22 07:03:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	bought that... feel kinda ripped off.
2016-09-22 07:03:46	_Hex_	i was testing a beta
2016-09-22 07:03:50	_Hex_	which was actually pretty amazing
2016-09-22 07:03:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's missing so much stuff that'd be useful to me
2016-09-22 07:04:06	_Hex_	but i guess due to the variety of android devices it was deemed too unreliable
2016-09-22 07:04:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	input assignments, routing assignments, plugin control
2016-09-22 07:04:19	_Hex_	the version i was testing basically had everything you could want

2016-09-22 07:05:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	because last ic pro update was july, and I'd be confused if they didn't port that stuff to ios
2016-09-22 07:05:02	_Hex_	it was never pushed to public
2016-09-22 07:05:18	_Hex_	i guess they went back to the drawing board with some stuff

2016-09-22 07:05:37	_Hex_	sure it was 1/2 finished

2016-09-22 07:05:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	steinberg has some very talented people working for them
2016-09-22 07:06:26	_Hex_	yeah..i guess they have a research dept who push the results of their efforts to the test team for feedback..stuff that's been in the pipeline for 5+ years
2016-09-22 07:06:32	_Hex_	and still not ready for prime time

2016-09-22 16:21:57	_Hex_	what would be a practical purpose of using a gate?
2016-09-22 16:22:29	_Hex_	it's letting signal through above a certain threshold..below that threshold it is closing the gate
2016-09-22 16:22:42	_Hex_	for practical purposes well..there are tons of uses
2016-09-22 16:23:06	_Hex_	one easy one is if you have a live recording of a drum kit..you can set the gate to only open on the hits you want and reduce the bleed elsewhere
2016-09-22 16:23:29	_Hex_	want a pulsing synth?  you can take a pad, send a hi-hat pattern to the side-chain of the gate and now your pad pulses

2016-09-23 08:05:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	there does need to be some sort of 'pushing the limits' in some way to be recognized by the community

2016-09-23 09:00:10	Nahck	those lifeforms things are so ugly :C
2016-09-23 09:00:31	Saint_Isidore	SO I had my singer come over last night and did some vocal recording last night. The recording came out great but with her vocal dynamics every once in awhile the meter barely clipped. Whats the best way to solve for that? You guys aren't adjusting the mic input while the singer is singing are you? Do I lower the volume so at the singers loudest the meter doesn't clip?
2016-09-23 09:01:31	_Hex_	you should be recording so you're hovering around 0VU
2016-09-23 09:01:41	Saint_Isidore	hi _Hex_
2016-09-23 09:01:59	_Hex_	and in the digital world that should give you (depending on how your equipment is calibrated) 18dB for any overshoots
2016-09-23 09:02:00	adq	how about calibration before
2016-09-23 09:02:11	_Hex_	which are unlikely to happen with that amount of headroom
2016-09-23 09:02:14	Nahck	but that midi keyboard looks nice, i need something like that
2016-09-23 09:02:15	_Hex_	make sure you're recording at 24bit too
2016-09-23 09:02:25	_Hex_	and also..it's completely common to adjust mic gain
2016-09-23 09:02:30	_Hex_	in input stage
2016-09-23 09:03:40	Saint_Isidore	While adjusting the input level during the performance, are just trying to anticipate that the louder signal is coming and lower the input right before?
2016-09-23 09:04:19	Saint_Isidore	Nahck I did calibraet prior and though I was right on the money, but teh singer ended up singing louder at certain spots that I was not expecting
2016-09-23 09:04:33	_Hex_	what level are you recording at?
2016-09-23 09:04:34	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: what is 'right on the money'
2016-09-23 09:04:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: and do you have any VU meters around? even a soft one will work early on
2016-09-23 09:04:50	Saint_Isidore	AdmiralBumbleBee I mean close to just under 0db
2016-09-23 09:04:54	_Hex_	0dB FS?
2016-09-23 09:04:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: that's bad.
2016-09-23 09:05:00	Saint_Isidore	oh?
2016-09-23 09:05:05	Saint_Isidore	crap what shoudl it be at
2016-09-23 09:05:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	what _Hex_  said above
2016-09-23 09:05:12	_Hex_	what meter were you looking at?
2016-09-23 09:05:14	_Hex_	a peak meter?
2016-09-23 09:05:18	_Hex_	or a vu meter?
2016-09-23 09:05:52	AdmiralBumbleBee	quite certain he's just using the peak meter in the logic channel strip
2016-09-23 09:06:00	_Hex_	in that case..that'll be a peak meter
2016-09-23 09:06:02	Saint_Isidore	yea that one
2016-09-23 09:06:04	_Hex_	so yeah..fucked

2016-09-23 09:07:05	Saint_Isidore	hehehe well last night was just a last minute recording and used an maudio USB mic
2016-09-23 09:07:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	a 16-bit mic
2016-09-23 09:07:35	Saint_Isidore	I was actually surprised how well it recorded..just in my office/room
2016-09-23 09:07:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: so... just think about this for a minute
2016-09-23 09:07:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: your mic has _at minimum_ a noise floor of -96db right?
2016-09-23 09:08:05	Saint_Isidore	not sure what  noise floor is?
2016-09-23 09:08:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	ay caramba

2016-09-23 09:08:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: with a 16-bit signal, it will be just under -96dbFS.
2016-09-23 09:09:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	you can't have any audible signal lower than that (ignoring dither... that's another can of worms)
2016-09-23 09:09:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	your 24-bit integer signal has a noise floor around -144.4db
2016-09-23 09:09:56	Saint_Isidore	so is it like the mics ability to record low end sound is up to -96dbFS?
2016-09-23 09:10:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: uh... low-amplitude, sorta.
2016-09-23 09:10:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	let's just say yes.
2016-09-23 09:10:24	_Hex_	no..he'll associate low end with bass
2016-09-23 09:10:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	the answer isn't yes, but that's good enough of an understanding for now
2016-09-23 09:10:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	low-amplitude, not low-end
2016-09-23 09:10:35	Saint_Isidore	ok
2016-09-23 09:10:36	_Hex_	low amplitude
2016-09-23 09:10:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	definitely
2016-09-23 09:11:12	Saint_Isidore	so amplitube is like volume?

2016-09-23 09:12:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	uh, no

2016-09-23 09:12:20	Saint_Isidore	no shit?
2016-09-23 09:12:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	always
2016-09-23 09:12:34	AdmiralBumbleBee	you said always... you're not always turning up stuff
2016-09-23 09:12:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	but for now, sure.
2016-09-23 09:12:44	Saint_Isidore	I mean the mic level
2016-09-23 09:12:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	let's jsut assume a simple gain
2016-09-23 09:12:49	Saint_Isidore	ok
2016-09-23 09:12:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	turns up everything
2016-09-23 09:13:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	linearly, for this discussion (which isn't the actual case... but simplifying again)
2016-09-23 09:13:18	Nahck	Kimryd: i think pittsburgh stuff sounds a bit dull and soulless. i've got the synth box and it's a cool thing to have because it packs so many things in it, but as a synth voice alone, super dull
2016-09-23 09:13:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: so why are you trying to get your signal as close to 0dbFS as possible?
2016-09-23 09:13:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: what do you think that you're acheiving?

2016-09-23 09:14:37	Saint_Isidore	AdmiralBumbleBee  well i know you don't want to go over 0db and when she was singing her volume was a bit low, so I turned mics input to make it louder and It was gettine me closer to the 0db mark
2016-09-23 09:14:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: why does it 'being low' matter?
2016-09-23 09:15:06	Saint_Isidore	I wanted to here it louder in the headphone mix
2016-09-23 09:15:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	why can't you just turn it up with a fader or trim plugin?
2016-09-23 09:15:15	Saint_Isidore	and the output was all up
2016-09-23 09:15:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	what's wrong with that do you think?
2016-09-23 09:15:49	Saint_Isidore	Never heard of a trim plug in LOL
2016-09-23 09:15:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	ok
2016-09-23 09:16:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	I started this whole line of discussion assuming you had a _bit_ more knowledge that this
2016-09-23 09:16:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	so
2016-09-23 09:16:14	Saint_Isidore	Sorry, trying to learn
2016-09-23 09:16:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	got it
2016-09-23 09:16:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: so generally, MOST folks... are trying to avoid bringing up the noise-floor of their signal.
2016-09-23 09:16:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: with a 24-bit signal, if you add 20db of gain... your noise floor whent from -144dbFS so -124dbFS
2016-09-23 09:16:52	AdmiralBumbleBee	make sense so far?
2016-09-23 09:17:18	Saint_Isidore	1 sec AdmiralBumbleBee
2016-09-23 09:18:12	Saint_Isidore	ok so can noise floor be like like that hum you get from a home studio?
2016-09-23 09:18:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	that would contribute somewhat
2016-09-23 09:18:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	a hum is frequency specific though usually
2016-09-23 09:18:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	think of that low-level hiss that you'd hear if you added 100db of gain to a track
2016-09-23 09:18:59	AdmiralBumbleBee	or when you turn up your stereo with nothing on, and you just hear hiss
2016-09-23 09:19:14	Saint_Isidore	oh so by raising the peak meter close to 0db your adding a lot more floor noise?

2016-09-23 09:19:51	Saint_Isidore	so that hiss you hear from just having the mic on?
2016-09-23 09:19:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	sometimes.
2016-09-23 09:20:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: you have a input signal with a -96db, minimum, noise floor in a -144dbFS package here.
2016-09-23 09:20:44	Saint_Isidore	what do you mean by packager AdmiralBumbleBee
2016-09-23 09:20:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	if your mic signal is right at 0db... the noise floor is at -96db, no matter what.
2016-09-23 09:20:47	Saint_Isidore	package
2016-09-23 09:20:54	Saint_Isidore	ok I got that!
2016-09-23 09:20:56	Saint_Isidore	:)
2016-09-23 09:21:05	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: your 16-bit signal is being put in to a 24-bit audio stream (eventually 32-bit floating)
2016-09-23 09:21:07	Saint_Isidore	so 0db means noise floor at 96db
2016-09-23 09:21:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: so what if you turn down the input signal 20db?
2016-09-23 09:21:49	Saint_Isidore	your noise floor drops too?
2016-09-23 09:21:55	Saint_Isidore	by 20db
2016-09-23 09:21:59	AdmiralBumbleBee	from the mic, yes
2016-09-23 09:22:05	Saint_Isidore	so noise floor of 76db
2016-09-23 09:22:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	but
2016-09-23 09:22:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	no
2016-09-23 09:22:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	-20 + -96
2016-09-23 09:22:33	Saint_Isidore	-116db
2016-09-23 09:22:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	yes

2016-09-23 09:22:44	Saint_Isidore	which is good right?
2016-09-23 09:22:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	but... our goal is not a lower noise floor.
2016-09-23 09:22:50	Saint_Isidore	fuck
2016-09-23 09:22:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	but if you notice...
2016-09-23 09:23:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	we're still well above that -144dbFS absolute noise floor of the format
2016-09-23 09:23:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	we could drop that input signal by 48db before we're in danger of _adding_ noise
2016-09-23 09:23:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	so you could record at -48db input, ADD back 48db of gain
2016-09-23 09:23:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	and you're still notadding any noise
2016-09-23 09:24:19	Saint_Isidore	can you explain the -144dbFS absolute noise floor again
2016-09-23 09:24:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: yes

2016-09-23 09:24:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: in a 24-bit format, the digital noise floor is ~-144dbFS
2016-09-23 09:25:05	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: so if you took a totally empty 24-bit file and added 144db of gain, you would end up with 0dbFS peaking noise.
2016-09-23 09:25:19	Saint_Isidore	which is fine correct?
2016-09-23 09:25:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	do you want noise?
2016-09-23 09:25:32	Saint_Isidore	not at all
2016-09-23 09:25:40	AdmiralBumbleBee	k
2016-09-23 09:25:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	so the point of all this
2016-09-23 09:25:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	is that you can have your input signal coming in quite low
2016-09-23 09:25:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	and adjust it digitally
2016-09-23 09:26:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	without any quality loss
2016-09-23 09:26:18	Saint_Isidore	like with a compressor perhaps?

2016-09-23 09:26:26	Saint_Isidore	awe ok!

2016-09-23 09:27:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: a lot of plug-ins are programmed to work with signal in a specific range

2016-09-23 09:27:50	Saint_Isidore	gotcha

2016-09-23 09:31:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: the takeaway is... you can have your signal pretty damn low, and add a good bit of makeup gain without issue.
2016-09-23 09:32:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: and you'll also get along with a large portin of plugins better
2016-09-23 09:32:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: and you'll avoid clipping.

2016-09-23 10:24:00	djdementia	i was just going to mention one of motu's strong points is it's Windows driver
2016-09-23 10:24:03	subsignal	yea Saint_Isidore those are pretty good
2016-09-23 10:24:04	djdementia	but that doesn't matter much to you ;)
2016-09-23 10:24:31	Saint_Isidore	Seems to work fine on my mac :)
2016-09-23 10:24:52	djdementia	oh yeah it works great on a mac too - i was just saying the windows drivers are what set MOTU aside from most other manufacturers
2016-09-23 10:24:54	Saint_Isidore	just smells like weed...bought it from a guy going to burning man
2016-09-23 10:24:58	subsignal	yea i rocks motu mk3 x3 at home no problems with mac or windows
2016-09-23 10:25:12	Saint_Isidore	sweet subsignal  djdementia   :)
2016-09-23 10:25:23	djdementia	MOTU supports WaveRT, one of the very few audio interfaces that support that

2016-09-23 10:26:13	Saint_Isidore	great
2016-09-23 10:26:45	djdementia	I want  a IIc though. it'd be nice to have an audio interface that works with android and iOS
2016-09-23 10:26:49	Saint_Isidore	What did you add _Hex_
2016-09-23 10:26:54	djdementia	the MOTU IIc works on both

2016-09-23 10:27:07	Saint_Isidore	:(
2016-09-23 10:27:11	_Hex_	but umm..just went far more with the body of things
2016-09-23 10:27:12	Saint_Isidore	awe
2016-09-23 10:27:21	_Hex_	to make her "warmer" and "fuller"
2016-09-23 10:27:28	subsignal	sounds noice on laptop
2016-09-23 10:27:30	_Hex_	and conversely took a shitload of crap out of your instrumental
2016-09-23 10:27:41	_Hex_	so the vocal isn't fighting in the same range
2016-09-23 10:27:41		[10:27]
2016-09-23 10:27:48	Saint_Isidore	with eq?
2016-09-23 10:27:54	_Hex_	eq on the instrumetal
2016-09-23 10:27:59	Saint_Isidore	nice!
2016-09-23 10:28:02	_Hex_	but the voacl was multiple layers of compression..some decapitator

2016-09-23 10:28:12	subsignal	mmm
2016-09-23 10:28:14	_Hex_	using the mic pre to drive things
2016-09-23 10:28:29	_Hex_	but far more effort than i would normally do to a vocal
2016-09-23 10:28:40	_Hex_	which is mic technique, recording level, and the mic
2016-09-23 10:28:50	_Hex_	ideally you shouldn't have to do shit..touch of compression..little eq ..maybe
2016-09-23 10:28:51	_Hex_	and that's it
2016-09-23 10:29:02	Saint_Isidore	oh wow
2016-09-23 10:29:04	_Hex_	anyway..sounds okay for your $100 or whatever mic
2016-09-23 10:29:18	_Hex_	bit boomy in the low mids
2016-09-23 10:29:20	_Hex_	but whatever
2016-09-23 10:29:21	_Hex_	5 mins
2016-09-23 10:29:23	Saint_Isidore	I think you can buy it for 60.00 some places LOL
2016-09-23 10:29:23	_Hex_	who gives a shit
2016-09-23 10:29:51	Saint_Isidore	I do, gonna use it for a 30 second promo video  :)

2016-09-23 10:30:06	_Hex_	you can do that comparison in terms of the body

2016-09-23 10:30:19	_Hex_	those snaps are horrible in the instrumental
2016-09-23 10:30:29	_Hex_	really sharp spike which steps on the vocal range
2016-09-23 10:30:37	Saint_Isidore	gotcha
2016-09-23 10:30:54	_Hex_	and to me..i want her to wrap around my ears in a warm blacket
2016-09-23 10:30:59	_Hex_	glass of whisky
2016-09-23 10:31:02	_Hex_	dark bar
2016-09-23 10:31:29	Saint_Isidore	Definately sounds fuller and warmer
2016-09-23 10:31:44	Saint_Isidore	now...do I buy the slate or save the money and buy the bluebird
2016-09-23 10:32:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: I think you have your ideas reversed there
2016-09-23 10:32:31	Saint_Isidore	?
2016-09-23 10:32:37	_Hex_	slate gives you access to a mic locker which would cost 10s of thousands
2016-09-23 10:32:51	_Hex_	i'd personally save money and buy slate
2016-09-23 10:32:57	Nahck	mic locker wut
2016-09-23 10:33:08	Saint_Isidore	seriously? that many different mic emulations?
2016-09-23 10:33:30	Saint_Isidore	and I don't need another pre amp either right?

2016-09-23 10:34:28	bongofury	no
2016-09-23 10:34:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: if it was even 10% of getting there to 1 mic
2016-09-23 10:34:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: you're still getting your money's worth.
2016-09-23 10:34:48	Saint_Isidore	I mean there has to be a hardware difference right, I mean it can sound just like it?
2016-09-23 10:35:12	_Hex_	read the reviews
2016-09-23 10:35:17	Saint_Isidore	I wonder if they ever go on sale LOL
2016-09-23 10:35:20	_Hex_	you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference
2016-09-23 10:35:25	_Hex_	and it's only $1k
2016-09-23 10:35:32	_Hex_	that shit should be quadruple
2016-09-23 10:35:42	bongofury	yeahno
2016-09-23 10:35:46	_Hex_	yeahno what
2016-09-23 10:36:02	bongofury	well if you have a fabulous reference mic, why color it
2016-09-23 10:36:11	_Hex_	...
2016-09-23 10:36:14	bongofury	thats like instagram filtering your wedding photos or something like that

2016-09-23 10:36:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	ever
2016-09-23 10:36:43	bongofury	no, quite the opposite
2016-09-23 10:36:59	bongofury	i just dont understand the principle of trying to emulate a mic
2016-09-23 10:37:12	_Hex_	that's okay
2016-09-23 10:37:14	_Hex_	other people get it
2016-09-23 10:37:48	AdmiralBumbleBee	bongofury: because sometimes you want a specific sound for a specific source
2016-09-23 10:37:51	_Hex_	this isn't some bullshit like antares mic modeller
2016-09-23 10:38:07	bongofury	k
2016-09-23 10:39:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	there's a lot to be said for "Oh, if I do X, I'll get Y sound"
2016-09-23 10:39:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	if X is just selecting a preset on a mic model, and youg et exactly what you want
2016-09-23 10:39:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	then that's pretty damn useful
2016-09-23 10:39:35	Saint_Isidore	Does anyone here own the slate?
2016-09-23 10:41:27	Saint_Isidore	I'm seriously this close to buy it  ||

2016-09-23 10:42:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	bongofury: same. I'm not interested in VMS at all really

2016-09-23 10:57:32	_Hex_	Saint_Isidore: go try VMR if you can
2016-09-23 10:57:39	_Hex_	they are adding more mic models to it too
2016-09-23 10:57:48	_Hex_	so with a software update you get more emulations
2016-09-23 10:58:01	Saint_Isidore	so if I buy the slate do I get vmr? or not
2016-09-23 10:58:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	fairly certain you don't get VMR
2016-09-23 10:59:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	but you do get all the modules for the mic thing, and pres
2016-09-23 10:59:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	which works in the slate rack system
2016-09-23 10:59:39	_Hex_	you get VMS
2016-09-23 10:59:55	_Hex_	VMR is free btw
2016-09-23 11:00:00	_Hex_	you just pay for the modules
2016-09-23 11:00:04	_Hex_	and some modules are also free
2016-09-23 11:00:09	_Hex_	but you'll get a VMS license
2016-09-23 11:00:13	Saint_Isidore	Any recomendation as to where to buy?
2016-09-23 11:00:16	_Hex_	which loads those VMS modules into VMR
2016-09-23 11:00:33	Saint_Isidore	You think this mic will last a lifetime?
2016-09-23 11:00:52	_Hex_	honestly...no
2016-09-23 11:00:53	Saint_Isidore	mainly wanted for vocal and acoustic guitar recordings
2016-09-23 11:00:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	_Hex_: the whole VMR thing is confusing, because they sell a product called 'VMR'
2016-09-23 11:00:55	Saint_Isidore	damn
2016-09-23 11:00:56	_Hex_	but for what you get
2016-09-23 11:01:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	even though you can get revival and monster and trimmer in VMR for free
2016-09-23 11:01:06	_Hex_	i mean..no mic lasts a lifetime
2016-09-23 11:01:08	_Hex_	not in that price range
2016-09-23 11:01:24	_Hex_	unless it's an sm57

2016-09-23 11:01:52	bongofury	sm57 only sounds like an sm57

2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[20:59:38] you get VMS [20:59:38]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[20:59:54] VMR is free btw [20:59:54]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[20:59:59] you just pay for the modules [20:59:59]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:00:03] and some modules are also free [21:00:03]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:00:08] but you'll get a VMS license [21:00:08]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	Saint_Isidore	[21:00:12] Any recomendation as to where to buy? [21:00:12]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:00:15] which loads those VMS modules into VMR [21:00:15]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	Saint_Isidore	[21:00:32] You think this mic will last a lifetime? [21:00:32]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:00:51] honestly...no [21:00:51]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	Saint_Isidore	[21:00:52] mainly wanted for vocal and acoustic guitar recordings [21:00:52]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:00:54] _Hex_: the whole VMR thing is confusing, because they sell a product called 'VMR' [21:00:54]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	Saint_Isidore	[21:00:54] damn [21:00:54]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:00:55] but for what you get [21:00:55]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:01:05] even though you can get revival and monster and trimmer in VMR for free [21:01:05]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:01:05] i mean..no mic lasts a lifetime [21:01:05]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:01:07] not in that price range [21:01:07]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:01:23] unless it's an sm57 [21:01:23]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:01:28] in which case it'll outlive humanity [21:01:28]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	bongofury	[21:01:31] when did people start adding an "s" to "bus" [21:01:31]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	Saint_Isidore	[21:01:40] then I'll just buy a sm57 :P [21:01:40]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	bongofury	[21:01:51] sm57 only sounds like an sm57 [21:01:51]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:01:53] however..as i said..if it was me buying mics today [21:01:53]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:01:57] i'd buy vms no question [21:01:57]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:02:37] you also have the luxury of auditioning different "mics" on the vocalist [21:02:37]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	Saint_Isidore	[21:02:43] I want to record and album with my singer and want to eventually be able to product it myself. Thinking the slate will meet my needs [21:02:43]

2016-09-23 12:21:02	Saint_Isidore	[21:23:58] So what happens if you plug in another microphone into the xlr going to the slate pre-amp..would still sort work? [21:23:58]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:27:44] yeah..it's just a pre [21:27:44]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	Saint_Isidore	[21:28:16] so Are you really paying for the mic, pre or software. Just curious [21:28:16]

2016-09-23 16:04:35	Saint_Isidore	just curious have you ever messed with motu's cuemix fx
2016-09-23 16:06:37	AdmiralBumbleBee	yep
2016-09-23 16:06:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	but I don't have a motu dvecie hooked up righ tnow
2016-09-23 16:07:50	Saint_Isidore	I'm trying to figure my audio interface out, or really the cuemix fx software. Right now I just want to use it with logic
2016-09-23 16:08:27	Saint_Isidore	I have a single mic hooked up to a dn not matter what setting I use in logic I hear the mic monitoring coming through my speakers
2016-09-23 16:09:08	Saint_Isidore	Do I need to mute all teh track in the cuemix software. I muted them all and then logic will behave as expected with the mic monitoring
2016-09-23 16:09:14	Saint_Isidore	but is that correct?

2016-09-23 16:19:23	Saint_Isidore	oh ok
2016-09-23 16:20:12	Saint_Isidore	do you unmute the cuemix stuff if your using the ultrlite for a live performance?
2016-09-23 16:20:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	depends on how low you can get your beffers
2016-09-23 16:21:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	if your buffers are 128 or less, you can probably survive always going through logic
2016-09-23 16:21:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	without any issue
2016-09-23 16:21:28	bongofury	Gaytency
2016-09-23 16:21:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	bongofury: latent homosexuality
2016-09-23 16:21:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	aka gaytency
2016-09-23 16:22:04	Saint_Isidore	so you can have LPX at a live show with the ultrlite and run right to the mains?
2016-09-23 16:22:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: yes
2016-09-23 16:22:10	Saint_Isidore	and use the effects in LPX
2016-09-23 16:22:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	correct
2016-09-23 16:22:14	Saint_Isidore	how cool!
2016-09-23 16:22:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: however, mainstage is more appropriate for that
2016-09-23 16:22:21	AdmiralBumbleBee	in terms of UX
2016-09-23 16:22:56	Saint_Isidore	never heard of mainstage
2016-09-23 16:23:18	Saint_Isidore	holy crap!!! main stage is awesome
2016-09-23 16:23:30	Saint_Isidore	can I use it with my ultrlite for seperate mixes?
2016-09-23 16:23:34	AdmiralBumbleBee	yes
2016-09-23 16:23:41	Saint_Isidore	OMG OMG!
2016-09-23 16:24:03	Saint_Isidore	buyign it righ tnow
2016-09-23 16:26:55	Saint_Isidore	Can mainstage run sequences?
2016-09-23 16:28:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	not really, no
2016-09-23 16:28:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	you could load a long wave file in to the sampler and trigger that
2016-09-23 16:28:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	and other similar workflows
2016-09-23 16:28:44	Saint_Isidore	can it launch clips like ableton?
2016-09-23 16:29:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	not like ableton

2016-09-24 00:33:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	[03:10:29] Saint_Isidore: because that interface has a lot of inputs [03:10:29]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	Saint_Isidore	[03:11:00] but just 8 [03:11:00]

2016-09-24 04:53:42	raz	it's ripped from a full track with guitars, so hard to bring low-end back after hi-passing it
2016-09-24 04:55:18	AdmiralBumbleBee	raz: dupe track, pitch shift an octave down
2016-09-24 04:55:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	raz: blend in with compresison
2016-09-24 04:55:40	raz	hmm good call, gonna try that again (first attempt sucked)
2016-09-24 04:56:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	you may have to low-pass the pitch shifted version
2016-09-24 04:56:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	depending on the algo your daw uses
2016-09-24 04:56:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	to get rid of the warblies

2016-09-24 06:04:05	AdmiralBumbleBee	the panning is really offputting on the vocal to me

2016-09-24 06:05:32	 *	AdmiralBumbleBee shrugs
2016-09-24 06:05:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	worse is pretty relative I guess
2016-09-24 06:05:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	since I don't like eithre vocal track
2016-09-24 06:05:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	the rest of the track is pretty great though
2016-09-24 06:06:28	raz	dont like the sound / how its processed, or just not the singing altogether?

2016-09-24 06:12:09	AdmiralBumbleBee	maybe it was just a bad idea
2016-09-24 06:12:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	maybe it needs to be done differntly
2016-09-24 06:13:26	raz	yea i need a break anyway.. you mean just the vocals or the overall track?  cause i also screwed with the master chain

2016-09-24 06:13:59	Saint_Isidore	AdmiralBumbleBee do you knof if for my 1/4 outputs on the motu, can I use a regular mono (like guitar cord) or does it tneed to be a TRS?
2016-09-24 06:14:45	Saint_Isidore	I hear a lot of humming coming out of my monitor speak using just a TS cord and I'm not sure that the reason?
2016-09-24 06:16:59	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: read up on balanced cables
2016-09-24 06:16:59		[06:16]
2016-09-24 06:17:09	AdmiralBumbleBee	you CAN use a TS cable, but it can have more noise
2016-09-24 06:17:30	AdmiralBumbleBee	you definitely want balanced cables for active monitors though
2016-09-24 06:17:37	Saint_Isidore	ok yea they are active
2016-09-24 06:17:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	still, read up on balanced cabling and how it works

2016-09-24 06:19:27	adq	did not see any => kick ok
2016-09-24 06:19:38	Saint_Isidore	Its humming alot Ycros
2016-09-24 06:19:46	Ycros	then, uh, don't
2016-09-24 06:19:52	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: it probably won't fix the humming much.
2016-09-24 06:19:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	you probably have a ground loop occurring
2016-09-24 06:20:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	balanced cables will only help with interference
2016-09-24 06:20:10	Ycros	I don't get much noise when running TS, but I think I'm mostly all on TRS now
2016-09-24 06:20:16	Saint_Isidore	from the TS cable?  I just don't own a TSR to check
2016-09-24 06:20:28	Saint_Isidore	just wondering if I need to go buy some
2016-09-24 06:20:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: try plugging one of your monitors in to a different outlet
2016-09-24 06:20:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: or if you're on a laptop, try on battery power
2016-09-24 06:21:13	Saint_Isidore	imac using the motu, goign out from the motu to the active (powered monitor)
2016-09-24 06:21:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: are you using bus-power on the ultralite?
2016-09-24 06:22:03	Saint_Isidore	no a power adapter
2016-09-24 06:22:08	Saint_Isidore	on usb
2016-09-24 06:22:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	ok
2016-09-24 06:22:25	Saint_Isidore	I tried to run off firewire and buss power but it woudl intermittnely shut down
2016-09-24 06:22:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	so there's a ground loop between the monitors and your imac
2016-09-24 06:22:40	AdmiralBumbleBee	see if you can get any one of those 3 things on a different circuit
2016-09-24 06:22:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	and see if that helps
2016-09-24 06:23:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	if so, then there's some other fixes that are more convenient
2016-09-24 06:23:07	Saint_Isidore	like power the monitor from another room outlet?
2016-09-24 06:23:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	yes
2016-09-24 06:23:16	Saint_Isidore	ok I'll check 1 sec :)
2016-09-24 06:23:18	Saint_Isidore	TY AdmiralBumbleBee
2016-09-24 06:23:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	usually everything in the room will be on the same breaker
2016-09-24 06:23:52	AdmiralBumbleBee	but sometimes you'll get lucky and there'll be an outlet that's not
2016-09-24 06:23:59	AdmiralBumbleBee	and often that will break the ground loop

2016-09-24 06:27:44	Saint_Isidore	so the TRS won't do it

2016-09-24 06:27:59	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: if it's RF interference then sure
2016-09-24 06:28:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	ground loop, no
2016-09-24 06:28:17	Saint_Isidore	how do I know which it is?
2016-09-24 06:28:26	Ycros	yeah I just pulled my power cord out, it powers from firewire
2016-09-24 06:28:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: the sound
2016-09-24 06:29:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: go record a track from a mic-in with the gain all the way up
2016-09-24 06:29:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: then boost the shit out of it
2016-09-24 06:29:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: put on a spectrum analyzer
2016-09-24 06:29:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: if you see spikes at 60,120, 240 etc...
2016-09-24 06:29:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's ground
2016-09-24 06:29:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	if you see weird modulating noise, it's RF

2016-09-24 07:18:36	Saint_Isidore	So AdmiralBumbleBee when you set up a monitor mix, do you need to bus the channel to a dedicated auxiliary track and then set that Aux track to the monitor output channel (in my case)?
2016-09-24 07:19:52	Saint_Isidore	 This works, i'm just wondering if its the best way
2016-09-24 07:21:15	_Hex_	buy a mic yet?
2016-09-24 07:21:39	Saint_Isidore	 not yet, still reading and trying to decide _Hex_
2016-09-24 07:21:42	Saint_Isidore	so much to learn!

2016-09-24 07:46:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: yes,t hat's how you do it in logic
2016-09-24 07:46:32	Saint_Isidore	ae ok perfect
2016-09-24 07:46:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	it varies for other DAWs, like cubase has some seriously useful shit for that
2016-09-24 07:49:22	Saint_Isidore	_Hex_ So I'm torn on the slate mic.. I could get 3 blue mics for the same price. Do you think the slate is overkill for my purposes? Also, I record at home/office with limited sound proofing. maybe I can convert my closet into a vocal booth.
2016-09-24 07:49:50	bongofury	dont get 3 of any mic if youre on a budget
2016-09-24 07:50:02	bongofury	if you need stereo, get one matched pair for that application
2016-09-24 07:50:14	bongofury	or a single stereo mic, ofc
2016-09-24 07:50:25	bongofury	then get a different one for tone color
2016-09-24 07:50:35	_Hex_	Saint_Isidore: i don't see how you can be torn..more mics can be added with a software updaet
2016-09-24 07:50:48	_Hex_	and you're getting the sound of mics worth $$$$$$
2016-09-24 07:51:15	Saint_Isidore	OK so if I mainly want it for guitar and vocals, single mic application..your saying its a no brainer
2016-09-24 07:51:22	_Hex_	i think it's a no-brainer
2016-09-24 07:51:29	_Hex_	did you watch that vid?
2016-09-24 07:51:35	_Hex_	did you hear how different those mic tones were?
2016-09-24 07:51:36	Saint_Isidore	I just heard this recording of of the same singer singing the same song, with mics that range from 4k to 2 hundred. and coudl barely hear the difference
2016-09-24 07:51:39	bongofury	will you need more than one mic at a time?
2016-09-24 07:51:52	Saint_Isidore	yeah I watched it...I mean it really does seem cool.
2016-09-24 07:51:56	Saint_Isidore	not at this point
2016-09-24 07:52:04	bongofury	then I agree with hex
2016-09-24 07:52:06	_Hex_	could you hear much of a difference between the tones they tried?
2016-09-24 07:52:27	Saint_Isidore	I have a set of drums mics I use when I record custom live drum loops and for stage performances
2016-09-24 07:52:42	Saint_Isidore	I couldn't no...but I'm a drummer LOL
2016-09-24 07:52:49	bongofury	then buy one Blue, save $, or get the Slate
2016-09-24 07:52:52	_Hex_	okay..well..then maybe it's just training your ear
2016-09-24 07:52:53	Saint_Isidore	I need to develop my ears
2016-09-24 07:52:58	Saint_Isidore	yea\
2016-09-24 07:53:09	bongofury	personally I'm pretty happy with my cheap chinese LDCs
2016-09-24 07:53:13	bongofury	YMMV
2016-09-24 07:53:30	bongofury	I guess the few germans balance out the chinese here
2016-09-24 07:53:38	_Hex_	i don't know if you liked the sound of that shit i did to your recording yesterday
2016-09-24 07:53:44	Saint_Isidore	I guess thats why I'm torn bongofury I just recorded a vocal track with a 100 usb mic and loved it LOL
2016-09-24 07:53:50	Saint_Isidore	or at least liked it alot
2016-09-24 07:53:55	_Hex_	but i will reiterate..i had to do far more processing on that than i would ever normally do..just to get it into the ballpark
2016-09-24 07:54:06	Saint_Isidore	but then again, maybe I just don't know what I don;t know... and if I heard the slate it woudl blow me away
2016-09-24 07:54:15	bongofury	Saint_Isidore ugh
2016-09-24 07:54:20	bongofury	get a real mic tho
2016-09-24 07:54:51	bongofury	heres a rule, dont use usb mics
2016-09-24 07:55:03	Saint_Isidore	LOL
2016-09-24 07:55:19	Saint_Isidore	I thought that too...but man it came out really good
2016-09-24 07:55:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: you're gonna have to use a lot of mics to figure out what/when you like anyway
2016-09-24 07:55:33	AdmiralBumbleBee	but I'm sure the VMS would be fine for years to come
2016-09-24 07:57:47	bongofury	imagine how much better it will turn out when your initial signal is coming from a gold-sputtered diaphragm about an inch across, running thru your ADCs instead of whatever they stuck in the USB mic
2016-09-24 07:59:52	AdmiralBumbleBee	bongofury: well technically, the adcs in the usb mic are his too...
2016-09-24 08:00:25	_Hex_	i think he might go the slate vms
2016-09-24 08:00:32	_Hex_	muhahaha..now i get my slate commission
2016-09-24 08:00:35	_Hex_	j/k
2016-09-24 08:01:58	_Hex_	i started off with cheaper mics
2016-09-24 08:01:58		[08:01]
2016-09-24 08:02:02	_Hex_	i thought they sounded amazing
2016-09-24 08:02:12	_Hex_	wondered why i couldn't match sounds
2016-09-24 08:02:27	_Hex_	bought more expensive mics..closer but still no cigar
2016-09-24 08:02:30	_Hex_	used $$$$ mics
2016-09-24 08:02:37	_Hex_	oh..there's the sound i was after
2016-09-24 08:02:47	_Hex_	the other mics now just sit unused

2016-09-25 06:06:57	Saint_Isadore	Is it possible to record a mic with an audio interface instrument in with no preamp, or is a pre-amp required in order to use a standard xlr microphone?
2016-09-25 06:07:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isadore: digital mics do exist...
2016-09-25 06:07:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	but they are rather expensive
2016-09-25 06:07:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	so in your case, you need a pre-amp
2016-09-25 06:07:49	Saint_Isadore	so would the signal be too low AdmiralBumbleBee without a pre-amp?
2016-09-25 06:08:09	Saint_Isadore	I see I do get a signal but with the trim all the way up its very low
2016-09-25 06:08:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	yes, and you'll also have issues with frequency characteristics and phase
2016-09-25 06:08:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	due to impedance mismatch
2016-09-25 06:08:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	so.. just don't do it.
2016-09-25 06:09:02	Saint_Isadore	gotcha ok thanks AdmiralBumbleBee
2016-09-25 06:09:15	Saint_Isadore	why do so many interfaces have 2 pre-amps and ike 6 line ins

2016-09-25 06:10:05	Saint_Isadore	so like if a guitar amp has a line out, you can go directly in the line in?
2016-09-25 06:10:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	sure
2016-09-25 06:10:42	Saint_Isadore	or maybe a keyboards out

2016-09-25 08:19:08	MSHMTX	fScatxycle, could you recommend me some readng materials on the subject?
2016-09-25 08:19:23	fScatxycle	Unfortunately there isn't much out there on film score
2016-09-25 08:19:28	fScatxycle	believe me, it sucks
2016-09-25 08:19:45	kerrang	feel the emotion
2016-09-25 08:19:51	fScatxycle	the easiest way is to just know enough theory to properly explore chromatic changes and understand how they work
2016-09-25 08:19:59	MSHMTX	its not the writing
2016-09-25 08:20:06	MSHMTX	its the mixing im worried about
2016-09-25 08:20:20	MSHMTX	im writing to a very short film
2016-09-25 08:20:25	fScatxycle	just keep low volume when you need to and crescendo when you need to
2016-09-25 08:20:27	fScatxycle	it's rather simple
2016-09-25 08:20:27	kerrang	there's a mixing standard for film
2016-09-25 08:20:27	MSHMTX	around 4 mins
2016-09-25 08:20:37	fScatxycle	ALWAYS have some sort of ambience going on
2016-09-25 08:20:38	MSHMTX	how should i pan?
2016-09-25 08:20:38	kerrang	like the k-system, but something else
2016-09-25 08:20:50	MSHMTX	should i pan based on where things are on screen
2016-09-25 08:21:04	fScatxycle	no, unless you're incorporating the cinematic hits and such
2016-09-25 08:21:14	MSHMTX	yeah im doing the foley too
2016-09-25 08:21:24	MSHMTX	like basically all the sound
2016-09-25 08:21:24		[08:21]
2016-09-25 08:21:25	kerrang	are you mixing music or general sounds?
2016-09-25 08:21:29	MSHMTX	both
2016-09-25 08:21:36	fScatxycle	pan hi hits
2016-09-25 08:21:38	fScatxycle	don't pan bass hits
2016-09-25 08:21:48	fScatxycle	also don't be excessive. Just a lil pan to the right or left
2016-09-25 08:21:49	kerrang	music no, foley/anything-thats-part-of-the-scene yes
2016-09-25 08:22:00	kerrang	also what he said
2016-09-25 08:22:21	kerrang	but that's basically all i know about sound mixing for film
2016-09-25 08:22:21	fScatxycle	just think if you were there. If bass slams it doesn't really feel directional. If someone hits an anvil you can tell it comes from a direction
2016-09-25 08:22:33	MSHMTX	right
2016-09-25 08:22:40	MSHMTX	does it have to be as cleanly mixed as like
2016-09-25 08:22:42	MSHMTX	a song?
2016-09-25 08:22:44	MSHMTX	no right?
2016-09-25 08:22:56	fScatxycle	quite often it's actually the opposite
2016-09-25 08:22:57	MSHMTX	because in the natural world sounds would ovelap frequencies
2016-09-25 08:23:07	kerrang	yeah that's what i'd think
2016-09-25 08:23:07	fScatxycle	if the music were perfectly clear it would honestly sound strange
2016-09-25 08:23:10	MSHMTX	you prob gotta do way less processing for sure
2016-09-25 08:23:19	kerrang	it's more about balance than anything imo
2016-09-25 08:23:24	fScatxycle	there is generally a layer of grit to the music
2016-09-25 08:23:25	MSHMTX	im gonna take my time with it
2016-09-25 08:23:29	 *	kerrang is talking foley and scene, not music
2016-09-25 08:23:32	fScatxycle	so it flows with the movie
2016-09-25 08:23:35	MSHMTX	i should definitely do the sounds BEFORE the music right?
2016-09-25 08:23:46	fScatxycle	yes
2016-09-25 08:23:56	fScatxycle	you will use those hitpoints to change music tempo after
2016-09-25 08:24:08	fScatxycle	you'll use heavy rubato to make sure you hit all the hitpoints on downbeats

2016-09-25 18:30:07	Ycros	oh interesting, this code implies that on 32bit it's a carbon windowRef, but on 64bit it's an NSView*

2016-09-25 18:31:43	Ycros	unless juce is doing something to trigger that

2016-09-25 18:33:46	kerrang	1) ignore the pointer completely and do window management myself (if there are no major effects on the host)
2016-09-25 18:33:48	Ycros	well the juce code shows those two paths clearly
2016-09-25 18:34:23	Ycros	you could ignore it, it means your window won't be a child of your parent app, it'll appear as a standalone window
2016-09-25 18:34:26	kerrang	2) update the vst crate to provide the native window types (or a trait for all of them) and create a piston_window trait ot connect conrod to it

2016-09-25 18:35:22	Ycros	you still need to add the capability to glutin before you add it to piston_window

2016-09-25 18:36:43	kerrang	oye i need to write all this down
2016-09-25 18:36:55	Ycros	glutin provides the window backend that piston_window uses
2016-09-25 18:37:02	Ycros	ie. opening and closing and managing windows
2016-09-25 18:37:07	Ycros	this is exactly what you're trying to do
2016-09-25 18:38:30	kerrang	ah it's the default window backend
2016-09-25 18:38:37	Ycros	it opens a window with glutin, then renders into it using gfx/gfx_graphics
2016-09-25 18:39:47	Ycros	"For gfx to work, it needs access to the graphics system of the OS. This is typically provided through some window initialization API. gfx can use a couple of those to acquire graphical contexts. For example; glfw or glutin."
2016-09-25 18:41:18	kerrang	seems a bit redundant, but ok
2016-09-25 18:42:36	kerrang	oh, ok i was confusing the role of gfx

2016-09-26 14:16:28	Ycros	kerrang: yo, I got glutin running in a vst on windows, and then I got all excited since in theory conrod can run without piston, but it turns out the glutin/glium backend for conrod isn't implemented yet (there's just a skeleton), so, going to have to thread the functionality through piston after all
2016-09-26 14:17:01	httpster	arty_knots: wot
2016-09-26 14:17:26	Ycros	kerrang: I was eyeballing the mac side of things as well, going to be trickier I think
2016-09-26 14:17:54	kerrang	Ycros: damn, i knew you'd figure it out before me
2016-09-26 14:18:15	kerrang	i'm not really surprised that mac would be more difficult
2016-09-26 14:18:34	Ycros	kerrang: my glutin commit is here https://github.com/ycros/glutin/tree/child-windows and here's me using raw glutin + gl from vst2 https://github.com/ycros/vparty/blob/master/src/lib.rs
2016-09-26 14:18:56	Ycros	well it uses carbon on 32bit and cocoa on 64bit apparently
2016-09-26 14:19:23	kerrang	dat profile pic
2016-09-26 14:19:26	kerrang	and that beard
2016-09-26 14:19:36	Ycros	lol
2016-09-26 14:19:53	kerrang	reminds me i need to scrap my github profile pic
2016-09-26 14:20:21	Ycros	oh yeah turns out the window does get a close event (at least, testing in ableton live), so it does get killed when you close it
2016-09-26 14:20:55	Ycros	it's why I put the logging in (turns out printing to stdout doesn't end up in ableton's log file, hurr)
2016-09-26 14:21:18	Ycros	I bet I could hook a function in their memory space to do it though :P
2016-09-26 14:21:23	kerrang	it never occurred to me to use a log file for a plugin
2016-09-26 14:21:27	kerrang	that sounds useful
2016-09-26 14:21:36	Ycros	this is probably slightly more robust
2016-09-26 14:21:42	Ycros	well
2016-09-26 14:21:49	Ycros	can probably attach a debugger to the daw
2016-09-26 14:21:54	Ycros	and just breakpoint inside your plugin code
2016-09-26 14:22:37	kerrang	meh, that's more problematic to me. or at least it was when i did it with xcode
2016-09-26 14:26:55	Ycros	now I'm not sure about my design in glutin re: platforms that don't support child windows, currently it needs a WindowHandle struct implemented per platform
2016-09-26 14:26:55		[14:26]
2016-09-26 14:27:06	Ycros	could just use an empty struct for the others
2016-09-26 14:27:59	Ycros	but whoever on the rust channel was right in that piston should probably have its own somewhere
2016-09-26 14:28:08	kerrang	i'm wondering how this can be translated to another window backend for piston_window
2016-09-26 14:28:25	kerrang	yeah it seems weird to me piston has no option for handling native windows
2016-09-26 14:28:37	Ycros	because again, piston doesn't just use glutin, they can use glfw or something else
2016-09-26 14:29:02	Ycros	now, maybe, we can implement our own backend, and sidestep modifying piston at all
2016-09-26 14:29:25	kerrang	that would be something, i was thinking there should be a way to just say we use glutin
2016-09-26 14:29:43	kerrang	but i guess i'm missing something again
2016-09-26 14:29:53	Ycros	yeah, could complete the conrod glutin/glium backend implementation
2016-09-26 14:30:25	Ycros	https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/conrod/blob/master/src/backend/glium.rs <--- it's currently looking like this though :P
2016-09-26 14:30:37	Ycros	that said, it might not actually be too hard to do
2016-09-26 14:31:08	Ycros	https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/conrod/blob/master/examples/glutin_glium.rs <--- partially working example
2016-09-26 14:31:49	Ycros	but, it might be easier to glue a "child window glutin" variant backend into piston-window or whatever
2016-09-26 14:32:04	Ycros	and just use the piston integration in conrod
2016-09-26 14:32:55	Ycros	not sure yet, I gotta read more code to find out
2016-09-26 14:36:16	Ycros	I mean at this point you can just do your own gl stuff if you want
2016-09-26 14:38:49	kerrang	to get to that point could be enough for some projects, i'd imagine some people would like the ability to opt out of piston/conrod in favor of lower gl work
2016-09-26 14:44:00		[14:38]
2016-09-26 14:44:27	Ycros	yeah, well, the conrod author is clearly deving some audio related stuff from his example screenshots :P
2016-09-26 14:44:48	kerrang	heh, i wish he released the source code to that
2016-09-26 14:45:19	kerrang	but i'm not sure how helpful that would be. probably a standalone app using rust-audio crates
2016-09-26 14:50:38	Ycros	*shrug* could be commercial, could be in a state he just doesn't want to publically release
2016-09-26 14:50:51	Ycros	it looks like he's building some sort of daw thing
2016-09-26 14:51:06	Ycros	and yeah it does look standalone
2016-09-26 14:51:07	kerrang	yeah, rust-audio's dsp-chain makes that kinda easy
2016-09-26 14:51:24	Ycros	honestly I haven't looked at that stuff, but I might use it if it fits
2016-09-26 14:51:26	kerrang	i haven't used it, but it's basically provides routing
2016-09-26 14:51:43	kerrang	i've looked at some of their stuff, but a lot of it just rubs me the wrong way
2016-09-26 14:51:57	kerrang	disagreements on implementation i guess
2016-09-26 14:52:02	Ycros	a nice set of implementations for things like filters, delays, convolvers, etc. could be nice
2016-09-26 14:52:13	kerrang	Ycros: i was working on that for a while
2016-09-26 14:52:43	Ycros	all I have personally so far in rust is a fractional delay :P I should port over some filter code
2016-09-26 14:52:57	Ycros	really I need to get oversampling stuff going
2016-09-26 14:53:18	kerrang	Ycros: https://github.com/buosseph/audio
2016-09-26 14:53:52	kerrang	it's very meh, but i was trying hard to make it useful
2016-09-26 14:54:02	kerrang	oh wait i'm an idiot that's the wrong crate
2016-09-26 14:54:24	kerrang	https://github.com/buosseph/rasp
2016-09-26 14:54:34	kerrang	i forgot i even gave it a silly name
2016-09-26 14:55:59	Ycros	yeah. There are some forks of DSPFilters, might be worth peeking at the other forks
2016-09-26 14:56:27	kerrang	DSPFilters implementation is also weird to me when i checked it last
2016-09-26 14:56:42	Ycros	yeah some of the forks clean it up maybe
2016-09-26 14:56:44	Ycros	dunno
2016-09-26 14:57:11	kerrang	anyway, that's code i need to revisit and clean up, a lot

2016-09-26 15:29:35	Ycros	kerrang: mmm, it looks like piston_window is very light on code, it's just a convenience package that gives you piston + glutin. See I kind of want to avoid adding "child window" support to the base piston window stuff (that's in core) because then all of the backends need an implementation, they don't seem to have anything for disjoint backend featuresets at the moment (except for AdvancedWindow which doesn't seem to help in this case as we're
2016-09-26 15:29:36	Ycros	interested in the costruction of the window)

2016-09-26 16:40:36	kerrang	huh, so reading the juce vst source made me learn how opcodes are used in vsts
2016-09-26 16:41:08	Ycros	yeah, neat having that open source. wdl-ol is the other one that you can look at
2016-09-26 16:42:08	kerrang	helps that i've been learning about dispatching for web, so now i understand the concept
2016-09-26 16:43:23	kerrang	JUCE seems to handle windows completely within their vstwrapper, i'm wondering if that's the best approach
2016-09-26 16:44:17	kerrang	though i keep seeing that a new conrod backend needs to be made, and we'd have to create a new crate for windows
2016-09-26 16:46:03	kerrang	ideally, the window pointer can be transumted into something usable (which means forking the vst crate) which can be used by glutin or gilium
2016-09-26 16:46:45	Ycros	eh I think we can just use the piston backend for conrod and just slip in a new piston-window backend, less surface area
2016-09-26 16:48:11	kerrang	so create a new piston-window backend for child windows
2016-09-26 16:48:42	kerrang	or i should say native windows
2016-09-26 16:49:22	Ycros	well child windows
2016-09-26 16:49:31	Ycros	they already all create native windows, but at the top level
2016-09-26 16:51:49	kerrang	fair, i said native because i dont see a child window for cocoa

2016-09-26 16:54:34	kerrang	i was looking at the 32-bit juce code for carbon windows
2016-09-26 16:54:57	kerrang	looks like cocoa returns an NSView, which i'm going to assume is recursive
2016-09-26 16:54:59	Ycros	glutin creates an NSApplication, then an NSWindow, I think for a child we to skip the NSApplication and create an NSWindow depending on whether me have  a carbon windowRef or an NSView to parent under
2016-09-26 16:55:27	kerrang	yup
2016-09-26 16:55:58	Ycros	and it seems like with vst you'll get a carbon windowRefon 32bit and an NSView on 64bit, except REAPER (and maybe others?) has an extra feature flag which you can use to get an NSView on 32bit
2016-09-26 16:57:12	kerrang	guess that explains the isNSView conditional in juce

2016-09-26 21:42:10	RollGreen	[01:49:36] it's hard but as you get less stupid it gets less hard [01:49:36]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	kerrang	[01:49:37] probably [01:49:37]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	_Hex_	[01:50:05] haha [01:50:05]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	_Hex_	[01:50:05] man [01:50:05]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	_Hex_	[01:50:19] i think almost anyone would win this debate against him [01:50:19]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	RollGreen	[01:50:33] i dunno man [01:50:33]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	RollGreen	[01:50:39] he's dangerously ignorant [01:50:39]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	_Hex_	[01:50:53] every answer is about how he has this [01:50:53]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	_Hex_	[01:50:58] and owns that [01:50:58]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	RollGreen	[01:51:05] thats what i mean [01:51:05]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	_Hex_	[01:51:09] and nothing really connects up [01:51:09]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	RollGreen	[01:51:19] you level a constructed argument at him and he'll just waffle about loads of shit and come back round to MURICA [01:51:19]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	_Hex_	[01:51:20] is he mentally deficient? [01:51:20]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	_Hex_	[01:51:24] yes [01:51:24]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	RollGreen	[01:51:25] he's old [01:51:25]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	_Hex_	[01:51:30] it's playing chess with a pigeon [01:51:30]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	RollGreen	[01:51:41] politics are out of touch corporate whores [01:51:41]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	RollGreen	[01:51:53] and i don't even wear one of those stupid anonymous masks [01:51:53]

2016-09-26 21:42:10	RollGreen	[01:52:06] my nan had a saying [01:52:06]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	RollGreen	[01:52:09] never wrestle with a pig [01:52:09]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	RollGreen	[01:52:16] you'll get covered in shit and the pig will love it [01:52:16]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	_Hex_	[01:52:30] yep [01:52:30]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	RollGreen	[01:53:04] bernie is probably the only person i would vote for [01:53:04]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	RollGreen	[01:53:12] i wish kennedy hadn't got shot :( [01:53:12]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	RollGreen	[01:55:24] like the one pres that wanted to goto space [01:55:24]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	kerrang	[02:40:35] huh, so reading the juce vst source made me learn how opcodes are used in vsts [02:40:35]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Ycros	[02:41:07] yeah, neat having that open source. wdl-ol is the other one that you can look at [02:41:07]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	kerrang	[02:42:07] helps that i've been learning about dispatching for web, so now i understand the concept [02:42:07]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	kerrang	[02:43:23] JUCE seems to handle windows completely within their vstwrapper, i'm wondering if that's the best approach [02:43:23]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	kerrang	[02:44:16] though i keep seeing that a new conrod backend needs to be made, and we'd have to create a new crate for windows [02:44:16]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	kerrang	[02:46:02] ideally, the window pointer can be transumted into something usable (which means forking the vst crate) which can be used by glutin or gilium [02:46:02]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Ycros	[02:46:44] eh I think we can just use the piston backend for conrod and just slip in a new piston-window backend, less surface area [02:46:44]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	kerrang	[02:48:10] so create a new piston-window backend for child windows [02:48:10]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	kerrang	[02:48:41] or i should say native windows [02:48:41]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Ycros	[02:49:21] well child windows [02:49:21]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Ycros	[02:49:31] they already all create native windows, but at the top level [02:49:31]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	kerrang	[02:51:49] fair, i said native because i dont see a child window for cocoa [02:51:49]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	kerrang	[02:52:05] err wait [02:52:05]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Ycros	[02:54:11] hmm? [02:54:11]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	kerrang	[02:54:33] i was looking at the 32-bit juce code for carbon windows [02:54:33]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	kerrang	[02:54:56] looks like cocoa returns an NSView, which i'm going to assume is recursive [02:54:56]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Ycros	[02:54:59] glutin creates an NSApplication, then an NSWindow, I think for a child we to skip the NSApplication and create an NSWindow depending on whether me have  a carbon windowRef or an NSView to parent under [02:54:59]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	kerrang	[02:55:26] yup [02:55:26]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Ycros	[02:55:57] and it seems like with vst you'll get a carbon windowRefon 32bit and an NSView on 64bit, except REAPER (and maybe others?) has an extra feature flag which you can use to get an NSView on 32bit [02:55:57]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	kerrang	[02:57:11] guess that explains the isNSView conditional in juce [02:57:11]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	kerrang	[03:01:00] gd internet cant load a yt video [03:01:00]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	kerrang	[03:02:23] well shit, spanish music that isn't total shit (to me) https://youtu.be/sBdh46iFfHM [03:02:23]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Ycros	[03:02:48] but yeah, I'd do that check in the vst code, and just wrapper the pointer in the correct type [03:02:48]

2016-09-26 23:28:24	legreffier	not regarding level, more like freqs balances
2016-09-26 23:29:07	legreffier	mid range is a mess , i get it, but i can't seem to find a way out
2016-09-26 23:30:51	dylant	Do you guys bounce/freeze your tracks to audio w/ audio effects ?
2016-09-26 23:32:21	legreffier	dylant: depends :)
2016-09-26 23:33:28	legreffier	(i feel i'm pretty close, but that bass sounds have a weird mid)
2016-09-26 23:33:54	legreffier	(and i love what i did with these plucks)
2016-09-26 23:34:30	dylant	Is that your track?
2016-09-26 23:34:36	legreffier	yeah
2016-09-26 23:35:19	dylant	cool :)
2016-09-26 23:36:00	legreffier	i feel i'll just finish the arrangement , bounce that steam and bring the mess at my friends' (which is an actual sound engineer)
2016-09-26 23:36:24	legreffier	and make rough levels too ah ah ah ah

2016-09-27 04:16:59	kerrang	dang
2016-09-27 04:17:06	kerrang	must've been one hardcore game
2016-09-27 04:17:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: duh, it's badminton
2016-09-27 04:17:59	kerrang	i've never played badminton, it just looks like tennis to me
2016-09-27 04:18:09	legreffier	sounds dangerous.
2016-09-27 04:19:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: it's like tennis, but so much more hardcore
2016-09-27 04:19:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: cocks flying at 200+mph
2016-09-27 04:19:51	kerrang	oh damn
2016-09-27 04:19:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	tennis is the wimp's sport
2016-09-27 04:19:59	kerrang	TIL
2016-09-27 04:20:33	httpster	haha its easier than tennis
2016-09-27 04:20:53	httpster	more fine precision and less power required imo
2016-09-27 04:21:09	httpster	i dunno, maybe stretching my amrs was too much
2016-09-27 04:21:36	httpster	i also had a bit of pain during the first game, still kept playing until the pain was too much. im dumv like that
2016-09-27 04:21:50	Ycros	pushing through pain is how injuries happen
2016-09-27 04:21:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	Ycros: it's how men are made

2016-09-27 04:31:54	httpster	it sounds fun
2016-09-27 04:32:14	httpster	i'll prolly check it out today, thanks
2016-09-27 04:32:20	httpster	AdmiralBumbleBee: do you know any good horror animes?
2016-09-27 04:32:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	ohhhhhhhh
2016-09-27 04:32:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	my favorite!
2016-09-27 04:32:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	what kind?
2016-09-27 04:32:44	httpster	i have no idea
2016-09-27 04:32:58	httpster	my girlfriend wants to watch some but i dont really know more specifically what
2016-09-27 04:33:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	hmmm
2016-09-27 04:33:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	go watch 'another' then
2016-09-27 04:33:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	see what she says
2016-09-27 04:33:38	AdmiralBumbleBee	or mirai nikki
2016-09-27 04:33:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	my watch list is like 90% horror/gore
2016-09-27 04:34:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	I can go on forever
2016-09-27 04:34:07	Ycros	is that really horror though
2016-09-27 04:34:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	another is horror for sure
2016-09-27 04:34:18	httpster	mirai nikki doesnt sound like horror
2016-09-27 04:34:23	Ycros	no mirai nikki
2016-09-27 04:34:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	yep
2016-09-27 04:34:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's not really
2016-09-27 04:34:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	but like I said, I'm curious what she thinks horror is.
2016-09-27 04:34:41	httpster	i wonder if theres an anime of any junji ito
2016-09-27 04:34:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	since it's just dystopian and moderately violent
2016-09-27 04:37:22	Ycros	I haven't seen Another, I should add it to my list
2016-09-27 04:43:00		[04:37]
2016-09-27 04:45:09	kerrang	that's been on the to-watch-list for a bit
2016-09-27 04:45:27	httpster	AdmiralBumbleBee: she just said that non-scifi unless it's a dystopic and that she wants to be scared and feel anxious :D
2016-09-27 04:45:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	just watch another then
2016-09-27 04:51:00		[04:45]
2016-09-27 04:53:07	httpster	AdmiralBumbleBee: she liked another
2016-09-27 04:53:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	hmm
2016-09-27 04:53:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	has she seen higurashi then?
2016-09-27 04:53:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	any of them
2016-09-27 04:53:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	or ga:rei zero?
2016-09-27 04:53:47	httpster	she's gonna watch higurashi, it's been on her todo
2016-09-27 04:53:57	httpster	imo it looks pretty terrible tho :D
2016-09-27 04:54:03	httpster	ga:rei seems interesting
2016-09-27 04:54:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	probably the most iconic modern horror/slasher anime
2016-09-27 04:54:15	AdmiralBumbleBee	I HATE the animation
2016-09-27 04:54:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	but the rest is good
2016-09-27 04:54:20	Ycros	ha
2016-09-27 04:57:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	httpster: out of curiosity, has she seen any weird horror shit like gantz or bokurano?
2016-09-27 04:58:02	Ycros	mmm yes gantz
2016-09-27 04:58:08	Ycros	worth reading the manga
2016-09-27 04:58:15	AdmiralBumbleBee	gantz is fun as fuck, manga especially
2016-09-27 04:58:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	but a lot of people seem to dislike it
2016-09-27 04:58:38	httpster	AdmiralBumbleBee: i'll ask
2016-09-27 04:58:46	httpster	im not really a fan of manga myself at all
2016-09-27 04:58:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	eh, there's some times you just HAVE to read the manga
2016-09-27 04:59:04	Ycros	it's just... it's one of the few things I've read where it manages to consistently make it like "ok, this is the most fucked up it can possibly get" next story arc, NOPE
2016-09-27 04:59:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	^^
2016-09-27 04:59:21	AdmiralBumbleBee	mirai nikki is another good example
2016-09-27 04:59:28	AdmiralBumbleBee	the anime is great...
2016-09-27 04:59:37	AdmiralBumbleBee	read the manga and it's 10x better.
2016-09-27 04:59:49	Ycros	aha I guess I should read that then
2016-09-27 04:59:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	worth any aversion you have to reading manga.
2016-09-27 04:59:55	httpster	i dont doubt that. it's the same for books and movies for me
2016-09-27 05:00:04	Ycros	httpster: I'm not a fan of manga either, usually
2016-09-27 05:00:05	httpster	but i'd rather just read a book than read a manga
2016-09-27 05:00:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	Ycros: can't say much without spoiling things, but it's very much worth it.
2016-09-27 05:00:15	Ycros	most of the times I read a manga if the anime hooked me
2016-09-27 05:00:15	AdmiralBumbleBee	better story...
2016-09-27 05:00:18	AdmiralBumbleBee	yuno is more yuno.
2016-09-27 05:00:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	MY WAIFUUUUUUU
2016-09-27 05:01:27	Ycros	I wish they did more of the gantz anime though
2016-09-27 05:01:42	httpster	AdmiralBumbleBee: she hasnt seen either
2016-09-27 05:01:48	AdmiralBumbleBee	httpster: then she should see both
2016-09-27 05:02:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	at the very least, there's not much else out there like gantz.
2016-09-27 05:02:10	Ycros	HEH
2016-09-27 05:02:14	 *	kerrang knew yuno would be mentioned at some point
2016-09-27 05:02:21	AdmiralBumbleBee	without going deep in to guro territory
2016-09-27 05:02:26	Ycros	y u no yuno
2016-09-27 05:02:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: <3 waifu <3

2016-09-27 05:04:00	Ycros	eyeballing lists of "horror" not sure I'd really call much of it horror. Maybe that says more about me than the lists though
2016-09-27 05:04:18	httpster	she's pretty yandere
2016-09-27 05:04:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	Ycros: more weebs think anything with blood is 'horror'.
2016-09-27 05:04:23	httpster	Ycros: yeah same
2016-09-27 05:04:30	kerrang	guess i need to add gantz to the read/watch list
2016-09-27 05:04:36	httpster	i wanted some anime where she'd be on the brink of shitting herself
2016-09-27 05:04:43	kerrang	probably read, got too many shows i need to watch
2016-09-27 05:05:30	AdmiralBumbleBee	httpster: then she'd probably like shiki as well
2016-09-27 05:05:31	Ycros	does body horror count
2016-09-27 05:05:32	Ycros	ha
2016-09-27 05:05:36	Ycros	oh yeah Shiki
2016-09-27 05:05:37	Ycros	brilliant
2016-09-27 05:05:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	and yami shibai

2016-09-27 05:11:24	kerrang	i saw the ending to shiki (friend showed it to me as an example to gore anime)
2016-09-27 05:11:58	kerrang	kinda turned me off from it
2016-09-27 05:12:02	Ycros	wat
2016-09-27 05:12:10	Ycros	doing it very wrong
2016-09-27 05:12:17	Ycros	you start from the beginning
2016-09-27 05:13:08	kerrang	idk, i guess i'm not interested in watching a full show when i know the ending is, uh, "unhappy"?
2016-09-27 05:13:48	Ycros	spoilers
2016-09-27 05:14:50	kerrang	eh i tried
2016-09-27 05:16:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: wait, you're looking for happy endings in horror shows?
2016-09-27 05:16:15	AdmiralBumbleBee	uwotm8
2016-09-27 05:18:31	kerrang	no, that was just my intro to horror anime
2016-09-27 05:18:57	kerrang	and it turned me off from watching horror anime in general
2016-09-27 05:19:04	kerrang	or at least it did
2016-09-27 05:19:55	Ycros	still doing it wrong, should have started from the beginning
2016-09-27 05:22:06	kerrang	how long is it? 12 episodes?

2016-09-27 13:11:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	tehsma: slightly concerned that you didn't know what you meant
2016-09-27 13:11:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	since that's just for resampling
2016-09-27 13:11:52	tehsma	some sort of daw testy thing with graphs
2016-09-27 13:11:56	tehsma	in my mind
2016-09-27 13:12:12	tehsma	but it all worked out
2016-09-27 13:12:34	_Hex_	what's that link to that girl with the big tits
2016-09-27 13:12:49	_Hex_	(let's see how this works out)

2016-09-27 13:15:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	wrl: what issues are you running in to now?
2016-09-27 13:15:08	wrl	i added switchable roundrobin/glide modes and my whole notelogic code broke
2016-09-27 13:15:20	wrl	segfaults in FIFO management
2016-09-27 13:15:27	wrl	bad shit, bad code
2016-09-27 13:15:35	wrl	gonna sleep on it and write unit tests tomorrow i think
2016-09-27 13:15:40	Kimryd	You're still working on panther?
2016-09-27 13:15:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	wrl: just null pointers?
2016-09-27 13:15:45	wrl	yeah
2016-09-27 13:15:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	probably?
2016-09-27 13:15:47	Kimryd	nice
2016-09-27 13:15:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	references to old voices?
2016-09-27 13:16:09	wrl	AdmiralBumbleBee: so, actually, not segfaults, but cycles in the queue leading to infinite loops in the voice stealing code
2016-09-27 13:16:40	wrl	poly_rr working fine, some weird codepath coming into play with polyglide
2016-09-27 13:16:59	AdmiralBumbleBee	wrl: it was working before though wasn't it?
2016-09-27 13:17:09	AdmiralBumbleBee	are you just trying to handle voice allocation during switches?
2016-09-27 13:17:24	wrl	AdmiralBumbleBee: yeah but that was with no separate poly_rr code, it was a fallback
2016-09-27 13:17:30	wrl	but i want it to be a separate notelogic mode
2016-09-27 13:17:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	wrl: were you going to implement the 'always highest' and 'always lowest' voice stealing modes we talked about
2016-09-27 13:17:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	?
2016-09-27 13:18:10	wrl	probably not at first
2016-09-27 13:18:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	because I'm actually very curious how that'd turn out
2016-09-27 13:18:20	wrl	just a different scanning mode in the FIFO pop
2016-09-27 13:18:52	wrl	Kimryd: note-logic/note-allocation refactor is the last thing i want to solve before i cut another alpha
2016-09-27 13:20:20	Kimryd	I'm down to test it if you need people
2016-09-27 13:20:21	wrl	AdmiralBumbleBee: i really just need to stop stalling and write unit tests
2016-09-27 13:20:36	wrl	i've always looked at the notelogic as something i could effectively test and just haven't done it
2016-09-27 13:21:05	AdmiralBumbleBee	wrl: oh I wanted to ask a while ago
2016-09-27 13:21:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	wrl: do you use a pre and post filter in your resampler?
2016-09-27 13:21:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	or just post?
2016-09-27 13:21:22	wrl	AdmiralBumbleBee: in camphor or my DAW?
2016-09-27 13:21:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	either
2016-09-27 13:21:46	wrl	DAW neither presently, will probably just have a pre filter when I add one
2016-09-27 13:21:48	AdmiralBumbleBee	I was looking in to IMD in resamplers based on a post fabien wrote...

2016-09-27 13:22:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	I wasn't actually fully aware of the effects of IMD on oversampled signals
2016-09-27 13:26:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	fml, I'm so bad at this
2016-09-27 13:26:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	wrl: ok, the rabbit-hole started here https://www.gearslutz.com/board/mastering-forum/968641-some-thoughts-high-resolution-audio-processing.html

2016-09-28 01:28:51	Roller	just depends on who's first or second room lol

2016-09-28 01:30:34	robotika	i haven't listened to dnb since 1995
2016-09-28 01:30:39	Roller	every rave i've been to since i can remember is 140 in one room 174 in another
2016-09-28 01:30:46	httpster	i usually stay around 126 to 135bpm
2016-09-28 01:31:05	Roller	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBcWZs6KLQQ
2016-09-28 01:31:07	httpster	im pretty happy to finally having found a proper sound for myself too

2016-09-28 01:31:43	httpster	yeah, i dont really know anyone who makes similar music to mine
2016-09-28 01:31:51	httpster	https://clyp.it/icq3jkd5 this is my latest finished tune
2016-09-28 01:32:00	robotika	i just go with the flow - i have no idea what anything will turn out like
2016-09-28 01:32:30	Roller	per project yeah
2016-09-28 01:32:36	Roller	but i know what i'm after
2016-09-28 01:33:04	httpster	i do try out a lot of different genres
2016-09-28 01:33:10	Roller	httpster:  this is don
2016-09-28 01:33:11	httpster	footwork, grime, hiphop, psytrance
2016-09-28 01:33:25	httpster	but my best tunes are always some synthy funky house
2016-09-28 01:33:25	Roller	drums are on point
2016-09-28 01:33:29	robotika	i don't have the discipline for genres
2016-09-28 01:33:30	Roller	the synth sits right in the mix with the drums
2016-09-28 01:33:38	Roller	the vocals are a little sharp
2016-09-28 01:33:57	httpster	Roller: really? well yeah they might at least be a bit too loud. i still havent finished the mix and this is a few weeks old version
2016-09-28 01:34:10	Roller	hey it's just what i'm hearing
2016-09-28 01:34:15	Roller	they aren't wrong
2016-09-28 01:34:23	Roller	just sharp compared with how smooth the rest of the mix is
2016-09-28 01:34:28	Roller	it's like you need to round the corners off
2016-09-28 01:34:36	httpster	nah but i appreciate the feedback. mixing the vocals have been a bitch cause either they drown and get muddy or stand out too much
2016-09-28 01:34:39	httpster	still havent figured it out
2016-09-28 01:34:54	Roller	i still don't know what i'm doing at all anyway with mixing
2016-09-28 01:34:54		[01:34]
2016-09-28 01:34:58	Roller	i mix with compressors
2016-09-28 01:35:02	Roller	at unity
2016-09-28 01:35:02	httpster	:D
2016-09-28 01:35:03	Roller	lol
2016-09-28 01:35:17	httpster	if it looks dumb but sounds good, it's not dumb
2016-09-28 01:35:18	Roller	keep everything at zero and use compression to bring up or take down
2016-09-28 01:35:24	Roller	yeah true
2016-09-28 01:35:27	Roller	what works works
2016-09-28 01:36:40	Roller	really nice httpster

2016-09-28 03:55:53	therue2	the moment when i was 5 years old and said i've had it with piano lesson *flips table*
2016-09-28 03:56:16	PersonaSound	pls www.nhd.org
2016-09-28 03:56:20	therue2	jk :P
2016-09-28 03:56:33	PersonaSound	was going to do my project on the fabric night club but the event has to be older than 10 years
2016-09-28 03:57:30	nike	metallica's concert in moscow in 91?
2016-09-28 03:58:17	Ycros	pfft let him do his own research
2016-09-28 03:58:25	PersonaSound	that's doable
2016-09-28 03:59:25	PersonaSound	i can't really find any topics on taking a stand for anything revolving music on google which is why i asked here, you guys are older
2016-09-28 04:00:26	PersonaSound	all i need to do is fine a solid topic with a lot of resources, then i'll continue the project on my own from then, according to my teacher it'll take 2-3 months to finish

2016-09-28 04:06:32	adq	PersonaSound, better rebelious event in music industry would be some famous artist getting rid of their label or management
2016-09-28 04:06:36	adq	like radiohead did, among many
2016-09-28 04:06:57	PersonaSound	didn't prince do something like that?

2016-09-28 09:47:58	wrl	doesn't make it any less sketchy
2016-09-28 09:49:01	wrl	if i installed some software and it was like "downloading some random component from a different vendor and domain" i'd exit out immediately
2016-09-28 09:49:02	fqtw	what makes it sketchy?

2016-09-28 09:49:15	wrl	and i'd also wonder why they couldn't just bundle it
2016-09-28 09:49:17	fqtw	not random, the user would know
2016-09-28 09:49:25	wrl	yeah

2016-09-28 09:52:17	wrl	if i put out a free plugin and said "please don't redistribute builds, just direct people here", and i found out that somebody's installer was hitting my server without that dev/company asking me permission first, i'd be pissed

2016-09-28 09:52:41	wrl	if the company was big enough and didn't respond, that's borderline legal cease & desist territory imo

2016-09-28 13:11:30	Roller	they don't run those massive stacks of speakers quietly
2016-09-28 13:11:50	Roller	and you could argue that electronic music of most brands is meant to be heard on a stack
2016-09-28 13:11:57	Kimryd	Not every electronic artist makes music for massive stacks of speakers and people who are off their faces
2016-09-28 13:12:10	Roller	loud music has nothing to do with being off your face
2016-09-28 13:12:15	Nahck	well i took tequila poppers mdma and dank kush once and tried to find some smooth ass electronic sounds

2016-09-28 13:12:46	Roller	and yeah i would say that most electronic music is meant to be played through big speakers

2016-09-28 14:40:57	Saint_Isidore	AdmiralBumbleBee  sorry I meant .nks?
2016-09-28 14:41:03	Ycros	gc deprecated on macos as of 10.8
2016-09-28 14:41:48	AdmiralBumbleBee	Ycros: still compiles in xcode 8 though :)
2016-09-28 14:41:55	Ycros	I thought gc was only in objc 2.0 and never on ios? dunno lol. The only Cocoa dev I've done in the past was actually in ruby, and on desktop
2016-09-28 14:42:11	Ycros	erryone running away to swift now :P
2016-09-28 14:42:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	swift is pretty nice
2016-09-28 14:42:30	AdmiralBumbleBee	been my main toy lately
2016-09-28 14:42:31	Ycros	yeah
2016-09-28 14:42:37	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: kontakt
2016-09-28 14:42:38	Ycros	it looks nice, but I haven't seriously used it
2016-09-28 14:42:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	they did some breaking syntax changes recently though
2016-09-28 14:42:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	for the better
2016-09-28 14:42:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	but... annoying.
2016-09-28 14:43:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	and there's a converter to update your code to swift 3.0
2016-09-28 14:43:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	but it doesn't work perfectly
2016-09-28 14:43:13	Ycros	annoying, but I hear it had rough edges from people that used it
2016-09-28 14:43:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	like every function name in cocoa and quartz changed
2016-09-28 14:43:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	but the converter doesn't work
2016-09-28 14:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	so your swift 2 code may just be totally fucked
2016-09-28 14:43:59	kerrang	has swift been following apples model of a major update every year?
2016-09-28 14:44:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	:(
2016-09-28 14:44:51	kerrang	while i know the changes between swift 2 and 3 do merit a major version change, i didn't know about 1 to 2
2016-09-28 14:45:06	Ycros	AdmiralBumbleBee: derp
2016-09-28 14:45:52	Ycros	yeah I heard they made the API way more ergonomic, seems like they're shifting away from "hey we're wrapping objc" which is a good thing
2016-09-28 14:46:09	AdmiralBumbleBee	yep
2016-09-28 14:46:12	Ycros	sucks they didn't get their converter working properly though
2016-09-28 14:46:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	a big part of 3.0 was that
2016-09-28 14:46:28	AdmiralBumbleBee	objc contstants are native swift types now
2016-09-28 14:46:30	Ycros	golang have done such automated things in the past which is rad (but then golang is a very simple language)
2016-09-28 14:46:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	none of that doX(15 y:10) type shit
2016-09-28 14:47:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	just do(x:15, y:10) now
2016-09-28 14:47:13	Ycros	interesting to see IBM going ham on swift
2016-09-28 14:47:22	Ycros	in the "enterprise"/server space
2016-09-28 14:47:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	Ycros: that's funny to me...
2016-09-28 14:47:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	not even apple is dogfooding swift yet
2016-09-28 14:47:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	and IBM is saying shit's ready for enterprise
2016-09-28 14:47:53	kerrang	ibm is desperate

2016-09-28 14:51:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'm not paying someone to stop annoying me

2016-09-28 14:52:30	MSHMTX	what do you do?
2016-09-28 14:52:38	AdmiralBumbleBee	I buy it from the artist
2016-09-28 14:52:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	and if it's shit
2016-09-28 14:52:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	I sell it
2016-09-28 14:52:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	for like $1 less than I bought it for
2016-09-28 14:52:58	MSHMTX	nobody else wants to do that
2016-09-28 14:53:07	MSHMTX	so theyve been stealing it
2016-09-28 14:53:09	MSHMTX	for 20+ years
2016-09-28 14:53:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	that's fine, that's defitely an issue
2016-09-28 14:53:20	MSHMTX	streaming is the alternative to that
2016-09-28 14:53:26	MSHMTX	so at least ppl pay something
2016-09-28 14:53:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	still... spotify is a shitty service.
2016-09-28 14:53:33	MSHMTX	i disagree im satisfied
2016-09-28 14:53:33	AdmiralBumbleBee	not sure if apple music is any better
2016-09-28 14:53:38	AdmiralBumbleBee	google play music isn't bad at all
2016-09-28 14:54:02	MSHMTX	i bet all the pay services are pretty equal
2016-09-28 14:54:03	kerrang	it'll be interesting to see spotify buy soundcloud
2016-09-28 14:54:04	MSHMTX	fuck tidal though
2016-09-28 14:54:18	MSHMTX	theyre buying soundcloud because they want to incoporate mixes into spotify
2016-09-28 14:54:21	kerrang	if they do, i hope they keep soundcloud completely separate from streaming
2016-09-28 14:54:22	_808BY	kerrang: lets see if they fuck it up
2016-09-28 14:54:28	AdmiralBumbleBee	MSHMTX: google play doesn't blare t-pain ads when I'm listening to some chill ambient music.
2016-09-28 14:54:29	MSHMTX	so it kinda helps soundclouds issues with dj mixes being taken down
2016-09-28 14:54:30	Ycros	_808BY: 1) get better C or C++ knowledge (there's a lot of C++ stuff in the space) 2) will pirkle's two books on building fx and synths in C++ are great and practical 3) volume 2 of musimathics has details explanations 4) once you understand a bit of theory, the art of va filter design is an excellent reference
2016-09-28 14:54:33	AdmiralBumbleBee	so they definitely are NOT the same
2016-09-28 14:54:39	MSHMTX	is google play free?
2016-09-28 14:54:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	no
2016-09-28 14:55:26	kerrang	MSHMTX: i don't see an aquisition changing any copyright issues on either platfomr
2016-09-28 14:55:46	Ycros	I pay for spotify, it's a fantastic service
2016-09-28 14:55:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	MSHMTX: really though, I get that plenty of people are ok with spotify
2016-09-28 14:55:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	but unless you pay
2016-09-28 14:55:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's fucking awful
2016-09-28 14:56:00	MSHMTX	spotify is just going to eat soundcloud
2016-09-28 14:56:03	MSHMTX	and make it part of spotify
2016-09-28 14:56:05	AdmiralBumbleBee	and their strategy is to annoy you in to paying
2016-09-28 14:56:07	Ycros	wait did you just compare paid google play to free spotify
2016-09-28 14:56:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	which is stupid
2016-09-28 14:56:09	MSHMTX	where all the music is already liscenced

2016-09-28 14:56:35	MSHMTX	oh
2016-09-28 14:56:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	but you can only use the radio feature

2016-09-29 00:46:13	legreffier	[09:17:19] i wonder if i'll still get some firewire drivers fuckups. [09:17:19]

2016-09-29 00:46:13	legreffier	[09:51:02] I think i asked here a while ago [09:51:02]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	legreffier	[09:51:02] but i got no answer , i'm searching for a good sample browser. [09:51:02]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	legreffier	[09:51:22] Finder's preview won't cut it [09:51:22]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	adq	[10:21:27] legreffier, ask _hex_ when he comes back, or maybe lums remember the name of the product _hex_ recommended few days ago [10:21:27]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	adq	[10:21:46] it was something with an ugly GUI but lot of feature and fast browsing iirc [10:21:46]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	httpster	[10:28:29] ive used mutant [10:28:29]

2016-09-29 01:15:53	Nahck	well its good if u have everything structured in folders with max 100 samples in the end
2016-09-29 01:16:48	Nahck	but with macs filebrowser that is a PITA
2016-09-29 01:18:02	Nahck	should take like two days and rearrange my sample collections
2016-09-29 01:20:47	raz	well.. it's also slow as hell. the indexer is broken (doesn't pick up new files on network volumes for *days*, sometimes never, no way to trigger a re-index). it can only search by filename, limiting to folders/types is near impossible. bookmarks don't work. can't seek in the audio preview.
2016-09-29 01:21:00	raz	sometimes folders or samples just disapper
2016-09-29 01:21:10	raz	i could go on and on...
2016-09-29 01:23:29	raz	god forbid having things like a tagging system (so you could drill down to stuff like 'drums'), search by sonic attributes, length or similarities, or just any other fucking feature that would make it not the worst file browser i've ever used

2016-09-29 03:00:36	raz	because it truncates in the middle...
2016-09-29 03:00:47	raz	i have a feeling this will be the same clueless piece of shit software as all of them
2016-09-29 03:02:03	raz	then again, apparently it's from asia
2016-09-29 03:02:08	adq	it's probably doing it in an alpha-fashion anyway
2016-09-29 03:02:57	raz	well.. it's astonishingly slow..
2016-09-29 03:03:10	raz	when will people learn that you don't need to stat() every fucking file just to index them
2016-09-29 03:03:25	raz	and that you can populate your goddamn index in the background
2016-09-29 03:03:38	raz	maybe i should write an indexer...  i just hate writing gui code

2016-09-29 03:05:37	adq	you just don't need to read the file content, except if you index (meta)data of it

2016-09-29 03:06:15	raz	no, the authors of these indexers are just incompetent, that's all
2016-09-29 03:06:25	adq	if you say so lol
2016-09-29 03:06:41	adq	but locate as a sample browser seems very limited
2016-09-29 03:06:59	adq	to not say, useless even, and probably hard to integrate in the daw, no d'n'd, etc

2016-09-29 03:09:35	adq	??
2016-09-29 03:09:43	legreffier	i need a safe and neat way to disable it
2016-09-29 03:10:09	raz	legreffier: sudo mdutil -a -i off
2016-09-29 03:10:19	raz	the problem is that then also Alfred and a bunch of other things stop working
2016-09-29 03:10:32	raz	the indexer isn't much of a tax anymore anyway (they finally got the priority issues mostly sorted)
2016-09-29 03:10:44	raz	it's just useless because nothing using spotlight ever finds anything
2016-09-29 03:11:00	raz	literally the only part that actually works is the index of Applications.. duh
2016-09-29 03:12:42	legreffier	you don't usually have 1000s of applications
2016-09-29 03:12:46	legreffier	will try that
2016-09-29 03:13:03	raz	yea the only problem is that e.g. Alfred will not see *any* applications anymore when you disable it
2016-09-29 03:13:06	raz	because it queries the index
2016-09-29 03:13:20	legreffier	i reinstalled my computer yesterday, mavericks and stuffs
2016-09-29 03:13:24	legreffier	quite a boost

2016-09-29 06:35:50	_Hex_	get that new xiaomi
2016-09-29 06:35:55	subsignal	so u can develop apps and take all them monies
2016-09-29 06:36:24	kerrang	because every android phone i've found is filled with bloatware, google is still failing to get updates out any fater despite saying they're taking more control away from oems

2016-09-29 06:37:26	adq	nexus were ok, and were a reference for android dev, not a flagship product
2016-09-29 06:37:28	_Hex_	we'll find out oct 4th
2016-09-29 06:37:28	kerrang	oh boy, what did i miss
2016-09-29 06:37:30	adq	things are going in another direction now
2016-09-29 06:37:32	_Hex_	i think nexus will continue

2016-09-29 06:38:38	_Hex_	yeah..oct4th is hardware
2016-09-29 06:38:42	kerrang	andromeda is basically turning android into a desktop os
2016-09-29 06:38:48	adq	there is also fuchsia
2016-09-29 06:38:51	kerrang	chrome os into android
2016-09-29 06:38:53	adq	and also, etc.. i'm gonna sto phere
2016-09-29 06:38:59	_Hex_	i think it's combining chrome os and android

2016-09-29 06:39:06	_Hex_	so things act more like windows
2016-09-29 06:39:11	_Hex_	you buy a phone from a hardware company
2016-09-29 06:39:18	_Hex_	they do the drivers..but your OS is updated from google
2016-09-29 06:39:32	_Hex_	so you're not reliant on manufacturers and carriers
2016-09-29 06:39:36	_Hex_	remove the bloat bullshit

2016-09-29 06:55:21	PersonaSound	lol
2016-09-29 06:55:22	subsignal	lol
2016-09-29 06:55:45	adq	that's a very good exercise kerrang, especially to understand what a compiler is
2016-09-29 06:55:54	subsignal	then some decision trees
2016-09-29 06:55:54	adq	or interpreter, depending on the language you target

2016-09-29 07:14:03	_Hex_	how it works is great

2016-09-29 12:09:40	_Hex_	send shit to groups
2016-09-29 12:09:44	_Hex_	and just do sends from the group
2016-09-29 12:09:55	_Hex_	and route your record tracks to that group
2016-09-29 12:10:05	_Hex_	also send your instrumental to another group
2016-09-29 12:10:06	Saint_Isidore	but I still need to manual ad add a send for each track I crfaete correct?
2016-09-29 12:10:06	_Hex_	or VCA group
2016-09-29 12:10:12	_Hex_	no
2016-09-29 12:10:17	_Hex_	just do the send from the group instead
2016-09-29 12:10:30	_Hex_	what are you wanting to send exactly?
2016-09-29 12:10:41	Saint_Isidore	Just the mix to the vocalist in there headphones
2016-09-29 12:10:47	_Hex_	their
2016-09-29 12:10:48	Saint_Isidore	but I keep adding tracks

2016-09-29 12:10:58	Saint_Isidore	thanks
2016-09-29 12:11:04	_Hex_	i have no idea how you have set up your DAW
2016-09-29 12:11:07	_Hex_	but it sounds convoluted
2016-09-29 12:11:22	_Hex_	normally you'd have your backing going to a group so you can raise/lower the entire instrumental for the vocalist
2016-09-29 12:11:33	_Hex_	you'd set tracks into a tape style monitoring
2016-09-29 12:11:47	_Hex_	so when you hit monitor on the track they cna hear themselves along with the instrumental
2016-09-29 12:11:53	_Hex_	hit record..record
2016-09-29 12:12:01	Saint_Isidore	I don't understand :(
2016-09-29 12:12:03	_Hex_	hit playback..that should disable monitor and let you listen to the playback instead

2016-09-29 12:15:01	_Hex_	you press play..singer can hear the instrumental
2016-09-29 12:15:05	_Hex_	you add a track

2016-09-29 12:15:53	Saint_Isidore	ok but I have a headphone mix that she getting to her headphones...or does that not matter
2016-09-29 12:16:02	_Hex_	you've over complicating shit
2016-09-29 12:16:05	_Hex_	for your needs
2016-09-29 12:16:11	_Hex_	you don't need to create an entirely new monitor mix
2016-09-29 12:16:13	Saint_Isidore	I usually do
2016-09-29 12:16:26	_Hex_	yes..you'll hear what she hears
2016-09-29 12:16:30	_Hex_	so if she wants certain shit up or down
2016-09-29 12:16:34	_Hex_	that'll affect what you're hearing
2016-09-29 12:16:35	_Hex_	but who cares
2016-09-29 12:16:38	Saint_Isidore	right
2016-09-29 12:16:40	Saint_Isidore	ok
2016-09-29 12:16:48	_Hex_	hence assigning everything to a group
2016-09-29 12:16:55	_Hex_	so you can just raise your entire instrumental up/down

2016-09-29 12:17:01	_Hex_	so she's not having to fight it
2016-09-29 12:17:05	_Hex_	or EQ out the mids
2016-09-29 12:17:09	_Hex_	or whatever
2016-09-29 12:17:24	_Hex_	depending on how complicated your vocal recording is
2016-09-29 12:17:30	_Hex_	i would often print a vocal slave session
2016-09-29 12:17:39	_Hex_	which would have drums/bass/keys/guitars/synths stems
2016-09-29 12:17:48	_Hex_	and then you have some degree of control over the mix
2016-09-29 12:17:55	_Hex_	but you leave your master session intact
2016-09-29 12:17:59	_Hex_	do all your recording + edits in the slave
2016-09-29 12:18:06	_Hex_	then just export those (edited) to your master

2016-09-29 14:53:46	Roller	your gunna eat the whole thing anyway

2016-09-29 14:56:22	Roller	i use standard ableton and serum thats it D:

Did you say I did not need to bus to a AUX track that send to the headphone mix? I was still stuck with the same result.

2016-09-30 21:07:19	raz	Kimryd: diggin the vibe. many of the chords are badly off but that can be fixed
2016-09-30 21:07:35	Kimryd	THAT'S WHAT i THOUGHT
2016-09-30 21:07:52	Kimryd	I'm using this plugin that mimics Ableton Live's Chord MIDI device
2016-09-30 21:07:56	Kimryd	you know the one
2016-09-30 21:08:04	Kimryd	but it seems something is broken in it
2016-09-30 21:08:21	raz	yea not sure.. the pitch progression actually sounds about right
2016-09-30 21:08:33	raz	but the chords themselves seem to have brown notes
2016-09-30 21:08:33	dylant	ableton lives instruments are meh
2016-09-30 21:09:05	raz	when i end up there i usually dump to midi and try to fix manually
2016-09-30 21:09:10	raz	sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't
2016-09-30 21:09:50	Kimryd	I'm not using ableton live dylant
2016-09-30 21:09:52	Kimryd	I am using bitwig
2016-09-30 21:10:00	raz	i've actually given up on most of these chord helpers for that reason..  it's a pita to fix
2016-09-30 21:10:09	Kimryd	hence the use a vst that mimics the chord device but is not the chord device OG

2016-09-30 21:12:02	Kimryd	raz, I went and got rid of the vst and wrote in the corresponding chords

2016-10-01 02:51:51	Ycros	Kimryd: it's probably a tuned delay line, so karplu-strong synthesis
2016-10-01 02:52:19	Kimryd	Really?
2016-10-01 02:52:19	Kimryd	Interesting
2016-10-01 02:52:36	Kimryd	never thought of karplus used in that scenario
2016-10-01 02:52:36	Kimryd	but bitwig's sounds very... resonant.... unlike live's which sound more metallic?
2016-10-01 02:55:18	Ycros	live's sounds like it to me
2016-10-01 02:59:09	Ycros	bitwig's seems to be a resonant filter bank
2016-10-01 02:59:20	Kimryd	those would be, like.... bandpasses?
2016-10-01 02:59:32	Ycros	likely, yeah
2016-10-01 03:02:08	Ycros	Kimryd: drop a delay-1 in bitwig, drop the delay time to 10ms, feedback max, excite with a short ping/burst whatever
2016-10-01 03:03:22	Kimryd	I know karplus, it's just a burst of noise > delay with lots of fb
2016-10-01 03:03:22		[03:03]
2016-10-01 03:03:25	Kimryd	correct?
2016-10-01 03:03:42	Ycros	well you can use different things for the excitation signal, but yeah
2016-10-01 03:03:48	Ycros	also really really short delays
2016-10-01 03:04:32	Ycros	but listen to the sound, it's the same as live's resonator
2016-10-01 03:04:50	Ycros	although, well, live's resonator has 5 separately tuned delay lines
2016-10-01 03:04:59	Kimryd	neat
2016-10-01 03:05:00	Kimryd	hrm
2016-10-01 03:05:17	Kimryd	with the note fx in bitwig, I can potentially make a tuned delay?
2016-10-01 03:05:18	Kimryd	setting it to mod the feedback
2016-10-01 03:05:34	Kimryd	or the time
2016-10-01 03:05:34	Ycros	it only goes as low as 10ms
2016-10-01 03:05:34	Kimryd	Oh
2016-10-01 03:06:37	Ycros	you'd want an even faster delay, but also smaller increments
2016-10-01 03:07:35	Ycros	you can clearly hear the delay in live's one at the lowest notes
2016-10-01 03:07:53	Ycros	shame it doesn't keytrack (although you could fix it with an m4l device)
2016-10-01 03:09:26	Kimryd	that's why I mentioned the note fx mod
2016-10-01 03:09:34	Ycros	I guess that's what Collision is for though
2016-10-01 03:11:16	Kimryd	collision can go get in a dui
2016-10-01 03:11:25	Kimryd	collision*
2016-10-01 03:13:32	Ycros	well collision and tension

2016-10-01 05:02:54	bongofury	two different things
2016-10-01 05:06:15	adq	i don't think so too, but it can lead to the same result (aka same sounding)
2016-10-01 05:06:36	adq	waveshapping is extremely convienient, simple, cpu efficient, tube-like, etc
2016-10-01 05:06:48	adq	phase distortion, i cannot really talk much about it until I know more
2016-10-01 05:07:30	adq	also waveshapping does not care of frequency domain and can directly operate on time domain, and is not dependent on previous input

2016-10-01 06:58:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	_Hex_: are you often (ever) dumped multitrack comps to do?
2016-10-01 06:58:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	or does your stuff come in comped normally
2016-10-01 06:59:02	bongofury	I have nobody to talk to about it, so I guess I'll just spam here: today need to send the envelope data and the note data into the M4L engine
2016-10-01 07:01:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	bongofury: you can monitor the value of a parameter that's being automated
2016-10-01 07:01:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	that's the easiest way to get envelopes in
2016-10-01 07:01:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	and most accurate
2016-10-01 07:01:21	bongofury	yeah but
2016-10-01 07:01:28	bongofury	the automation is coming from a place that's stateless
2016-10-01 07:01:34	bongofury	so I have to fill a buffer
2016-10-01 07:01:43	bongofury	think wavetable, for control data.
2016-10-01 07:01:53	bongofury	Unfortunately Live doesn't give API access to actual envelopes
2016-10-01 07:02:00	bongofury	so you have to drive them with M4L objects
2016-10-01 07:02:23	bongofury	and, on first play, record the automation to bake it in
2016-10-01 07:02:35	bongofury	or, suffer the playback degradation of all those automations. :(

2016-10-01 14:06:33	AdmiralBumbleBee	[22:20:06] Saint_Isidore: 'gain' [22:20:06]
2016-10-01 14:06:33	Saint_Isidore	[22:20:52] I don't see a "gain" plugin [22:20:52]
2016-10-01 14:06:33	Saint_Isidore	[22:21:14] or just raise the output gain on any already used plugin? [22:21:14]
2016-10-01 14:06:33	AdmiralBumbleBee	[22:21:21] Saint_Isidore: there's a plugin called gain [22:21:21]
2016-10-01 14:06:33	bd-	[22:21:23] like a limiter or a rain gain increase? [22:21:23]

2016-10-01 14:06:33	bd-	[22:23:33] mr001: wasn't too keen on the beeps at the start, but the rest is good. the clap sounds a bit too loud, or maybe just needs pitched down a bit [22:23:33]
2016-10-01 14:06:33	Saint_Isidore	[22:24:10] didn't think to look in Utilities [22:24:10]
2016-10-01 14:06:33	Saint_Isidore	[22:24:13] AdmiralBumbleBee [22:24:13]
2016-10-01 14:06:33	AdmiralBumbleBee	[22:24:23] it's a good place for utility plugins to be [22:24:23]
2016-10-01 14:06:33	Saint_Isidore	[22:24:58] I thought that would have been under dynamics [22:24:58]
2016-10-01 14:06:33	Saint_Isidore	[22:25:28] mr001  thats a sweet little jam you got there [22:25:28]

2016-10-01 14:06:33	Saint_Isidore	[22:29:40] would be a great opener for "American Horror Story" mr001 [22:29:40]

2016-10-02 15:07:17	Roller	you won't find that in sample packs
2016-10-02 15:07:23	kerrang	but i'm guessing that's just a result of a lot of people copying stuff like 808 and 909 samples, so those are saturated
2016-10-02 15:07:31	Roller	like real drums?
2016-10-02 15:07:45	kerrang	yeah
2016-10-02 15:07:46	_Hex_	lots of excuses
2016-10-02 15:07:50	_Hex_	but no excusing you're and your
2016-10-02 15:08:01	_Hex_	kerrang: what sounds are you looking for?
2016-10-02 15:08:12	Roller	thats what i'm trying to get out o fhim
2016-10-02 15:08:48	kerrang	realistic drumkit for hip hop
2016-10-02 15:08:48	Roller	breaks
2016-10-02 15:08:48	Roller	man breaks
2016-10-02 15:08:48	Roller	things with drums or things with no drums
2016-10-02 15:08:48	_Hex_	kerrang: tried m-phazes stuff?
2016-10-02 15:08:56	Roller	you can't resample hiphop :|
2016-10-02 15:08:58	Roller	thtas like incest
2016-10-02 15:09:00	Roller	you like incest hex?
2016-10-02 15:09:14	_Hex_	or the just blaze library
2016-10-02 15:09:31	Roller	or search for original breaks..
2016-10-02 15:09:32	Roller	and chop em
2016-10-02 15:09:34	Roller	like a bawss
2016-10-02 15:09:50	kerrang	guess that's what i gotta do from now on
2016-10-02 15:10:04	Roller	theres no quick solution like a sample pack man..
2016-10-02 15:10:06	Roller	you gotta DIGGG
2016-10-02 15:10:38	_Hex_	or use addictive drums if you want a full and cohesive kit sound
2016-10-02 15:10:38		[15:10]
2016-10-02 15:10:44	Roller	that won't sound organic
2016-10-02 15:10:45	kerrang	_Hex_: i'll look at the blaze library and m-phases tracks
2016-10-02 15:10:51	_Hex_	Roller: sure it will
2016-10-02 15:10:54	Roller	no it won't
2016-10-02 15:10:57	_Hex_	sure it will
2016-10-02 15:10:58	Roller	it's sampled hits
2016-10-02 15:11:00	kerrang	long-term i do want to buy addictive drums or superior drummer
2016-10-02 15:11:02	Roller	it's pitched and tidied
2016-10-02 15:11:08	Roller	you want all the nastiness and grit on the dums
2016-10-02 15:11:09	Roller	drums
2016-10-02 15:11:13	Roller	especially for hiphop
2016-10-02 15:11:14	kerrang	but there's no point in buying that until i have a decent machine
2016-10-02 15:11:30	Roller	do you make 90s hiphop with synths?
2016-10-02 15:11:36	Roller	sounds in context..
2016-10-02 15:11:46	kerrang	Roller: hip hop is just what i'm looking at right now, not the only genre i'm interested in that needs real drums
2016-10-02 15:11:49	_Hex_	and what hip hop have you worked on?
2016-10-02 15:11:56	Roller	loads
2016-10-02 15:12:03	Roller	never released anything but loads
2016-10-02 15:12:03	_Hex_	...
2016-10-02 15:12:06	_Hex_	never released anything..okay
2016-10-02 15:12:08	Roller	lol mate i'm literally looping something right now
2016-10-02 15:12:14	Roller	who gives a shit about releases
2016-10-02 15:12:21	kerrang	yeah but hex is the real deal
2016-10-02 15:12:28	Roller	ok..
2016-10-02 15:12:32	_Hex_	i guess your nan likes to get your mix tapes in her christmas stocking
2016-10-02 15:12:39	Roller	so music made by someone with no releases is shit compared to someone with bitches and money
2016-10-02 15:12:41	Roller	give me a break man
2016-10-02 15:12:46	_Hex_	"oh..look at little roller..he's sample some organic breaks..what a gem"
2016-10-02 15:12:52	kerrang	no that's not what i meant
2016-10-02 15:12:57	Roller	if you don't use breaks in hiphop
2016-10-02 15:13:02	Roller	i have no idea what you think you'e doing lol
2016-10-02 15:13:11	Roller	even for hi hats and organic rhytm
2016-10-02 15:13:21	Roller	you've either taken the groove from a drum break or you're laying the groove with one
2016-10-02 15:13:45	_Hex_	kerrang: i've got couple of libaries going back a long way if you want me to zip 'em up for you
2016-10-02 15:14:10	kerrang	_Hex_: i'd appreciate that
2016-10-02 15:14:52	Roller	i have the nicest two samples sat on top of eachother untouched or processed
2016-10-02 15:15:12	Roller	i make alot of hiphop man.. i'm only putting forward ideas, i don't know where your ego is coming from tbh
2016-10-02 15:15:29	kerrang	i've been thinking a lot about how i need to reapproach my use of samples, so that's why i'm so focused on one-shots and less on chopping breaks
2016-10-02 15:15:43	Roller	chopping a break turns it into one shots
2016-10-02 15:15:47	Roller	yo run audio into midi..
2016-10-02 15:15:58	Roller	then you can process each hit however you want
2016-10-02 15:16:12	kerrang	but chopping breaks doesn't necessarily address timbral changes per hit
2016-10-02 15:16:26	Roller	then use the rhythm of the break but only one of the hit sounds say for a snare
2016-10-02 15:16:34	Roller	then you have control of velocity and other adsr shit
2016-10-02 15:16:45	kerrang	you can grab something from a break, change it's velocity, but how you gonna get a variation of the hit with a different timbre that's realistic?
2016-10-02 15:17:04	Roller	the break will have more than one snare sound in it if you want to use the break for that?
2016-10-02 15:17:08	kerrang	i haven't figured out how you'd do that through processing, pitch changes aren't enough, maybe mapping distortion to velocity
2016-10-02 15:17:29	Roller	velocity is usually enough for that
2016-10-02 15:17:32	kerrang	Roller: and there's always the case where you have overlapping samples
2016-10-02 15:17:39	kerrang	e.g. in the amen, the kick is never alone
2016-10-02 15:17:45	Roller	i just drop one or the other
2016-10-02 15:17:46	kerrang	always has the hi-hat with it
2016-10-02 15:18:00	Roller	yeah you have to be careful with like a kick hit with a hi hat in it your right
2016-10-02 15:18:11	Roller	just being surgical though you can usually find a clean hit in there

2016-10-02 15:18:32	kerrang	i think of chopping as making something from the break, but for when i have an idea that's not based on a break i'd rather use one-shots

2016-10-03 04:53:20	bd-	[14:42:34] mixing could do with some work, although i'm using some reasonbly shitty earphones so maybe it's just these [14:42:34]
2016-10-03 04:53:20	TheCometCE	[14:42:55] no it probably does need it, I've shifted my whole mixing process around in the last 2 weeks [14:42:55]
2016-10-03 04:53:20	bd-	[14:43:23] 1:31 the drop in volume on the lead synth is odd [14:43:23]
2016-10-03 04:53:20	TheCometCE	[14:43:34] my mixing habits are directly tied to the radio/tv broadcasting degree on my wall, I have a lot of habits that work great for broadcasting VO that are horrible for music [14:43:34]
2016-10-03 04:53:20	bd-	[14:44:25] overall i like it though, nice track [14:44:25]

2016-10-03 04:57:13	TheCometCE	I dig it, I almost wish it was futuregarage-y with some reverb on the drumline, but I'm biased

2016-10-03 04:58:04	kerrang	so i just tried adding a bunch of distortion on a send
2016-10-03 04:58:35	kerrang	didn't work well for the drums, and yeah reverb on the drums would help a lot here
2016-10-03 04:59:22	kerrang	ooh actually some automated reverb on the snare would be nice
2016-10-03 04:59:59	kerrang	were my drums too static? not in programming but in timbre
2016-10-03 05:00:30	TheCometCE	they seemed alright to me, very punchy but in a good way
2016-10-03 05:00:34	adq	not for me, i mean the static feeling comes more from the constant noise/pad/synth behind more
2016-10-03 05:00:44	TheCometCE	yeah
2016-10-03 05:00:45	adq	i can see you improved in mixing your wip, kerrang

2016-10-03 05:19:35	kerrang	[14:58:35] didn't work well for the drums, and yeah reverb on the drums would help a lot here [14:58:35]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	kerrang	[14:59:22] ooh actually some automated reverb on the snare would be nice [14:59:22]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	kerrang	[14:59:59] were my drums too static? not in programming but in timbre [14:59:59]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	TheCometCE	[15:00:30] they seemed alright to me, very punchy but in a good way [15:00:30]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	adq	[15:00:34] not for me, i mean the static feeling comes more from the constant noise/pad/synth behind more [15:00:34]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	TheCometCE	[15:00:44] yeah [15:00:44]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	adq	[15:00:45] i can see you improved in mixing your wip, kerrang [15:00:45]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	adq	[15:00:57] before it was much more muddy and less clean [15:00:57]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	adq	[15:01:02] so keep going anyway [15:01:02]

2016-10-03 05:19:35	kerrang	[15:02:20] i keep falling into that habit [15:02:20]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	kerrang	[15:02:55] and worse bitwigs organ plugin didn't have any decay and sustain control :/ [15:02:55]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	adq	[15:03:01] as long as the habit is not falling into you [15:03:01]

2016-10-03 05:19:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	[15:09:05] kerrang: why would an organ plugin have decay and sustain? [15:09:05]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	[15:10:16] that's like complaining that a piano plugin doesn't have formant shifting and a dirty bit crusher [15:10:16]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	kerrang	[15:11:35] AdmiralBumbleBee: an organ doesn't have any decay? [15:11:35]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	[15:12:26] ... [15:12:26]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	[15:12:30] have no never played an organ? [15:12:30]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	[15:12:36] it's simply on/off [15:12:36]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	[15:12:43] no=you [15:12:43]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	kerrang	[15:12:43] no [15:12:43]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	kerrang	[15:13:00] it's been a while since i was even near an organ [15:13:00]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	kerrang	[15:13:18] but it makes sense when i think about it [15:13:18]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	[15:13:43] air blows or it doesn't [15:13:43]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	[15:13:54] open a valve, close a valve [15:13:54]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	kerrang	[15:15:34] yeah, then i'll need to rethink my use of it then [15:15:34]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	[15:16:13] or you can just synthesize an organ [15:16:13]
2016-10-03 05:19:35	adq	[15:16:34] my parents has an old pump organ they only use to decorate and put stuff on it, one of the pump is dead [15:16:34]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	[15:16:55] kerrang: just toss on an inverted sawtooth, pile on some partials [15:16:55]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	adq	[15:16:57] but i remember you can have a simili-effect depending on something you pull (a metallic arm) [15:16:57]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	[15:16:58] then use whatever controls you want [15:16:58]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	adq	[15:17:14] not close enough to a sustain pedal anyway [15:17:14]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	adq	[15:17:31] it's more like it make the pressure increases and sounds louder/stronger while enabled [15:17:31]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	adq	[15:17:38] makes* [15:17:38]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	raz	[15:18:14] sample it and sell it as a kontakt instrument [15:18:14]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	adq	[15:18:19] the name is "harmonium" in french but it looks like it's called a pump organ in english [15:18:19]

2016-10-03 05:25:00	legreffier	full organs are usually in big stony room with lotta reverb... So a release can kinda make
2016-10-03 05:25:13	legreffier	at least it's a stupid request.
2016-10-03 05:25:23	legreffier	sense*
2016-10-03 05:25:38	adq	well it makes sense because they can be synthetized or sampled, and adsr is very often nearby
2016-10-03 05:26:03	adq	after, if you're going for perfect emulation of the real instrument, that's another story

2016-10-03 12:20:03	raz	these side chains are a pita to setup
2016-10-03 12:20:18	raz	and eat a surprising amount of cpu when doing it the standard ableton compressor way
2016-10-03 12:20:42	raz	and most of my reverbs have about 40 knobs that i have never touched in my life
2016-10-03 12:20:47	raz	i'd rather have one that's actually useful
2016-10-03 12:21:48	kerrang	if i ever make a reverb i'll try to keep that sidechain in mind
2016-10-03 12:22:02	kerrang	but reverbs are hard, so that probably won't be soon

2016-10-03 12:27:36	kerrang	still gotta sidechainf or them transients

2016-10-03 14:38:36	bongofury	even if you were, you'd prob have genital herpes, which would mean, you were just going around giving it to them

2016-10-03 14:41:00	bongofury	think about that.  Not as a man, but as a woman.  You're using the internet because nobody IRL will fuck you.
2016-10-03 14:41:15	bongofury	it says a lot more about the women than the men
2016-10-03 14:41:30	bongofury	men are always seeking and horny, of course they have few options compared to their desire

2016-10-04 05:46:20	bd-	45mins worth
2016-10-04 05:46:35	TheCometCE	I'm at around 28ish right now
2016-10-04 05:47:03	TheCometCE	I mean, I'm doing pay what you want with it, I'm not trying to make it huge, but instead of ending the album I keep transitioning into new tracks XD
2016-10-04 05:47:43	TheCometCE	also I just bitch slapped myself with nostalgia, found where I had an old Calyx album <3
2016-10-04 05:48:21	TheCometCE	Tearing Us Apart is <3
2016-10-04 05:48:26	bd-	weird, i was listening to calyx - killa this morning
2016-10-04 05:48:37	TheCometCE	same album as that :3
2016-10-04 05:48:53	bd-	msxep027?
2016-10-04 05:49:19	TheCometCE	apparently Calyx and Teebee are still producing together, although none of their recent stuff seems to hit the same quality as his older work, they've kinda fallen into EDM a lil when they should've stuck with DnB
2016-10-04 05:50:29	TheCometCE	eh actually scratch that, rose tinted goggles, just started playing a few tracks from the most recent album and it's not too bad
2016-10-04 05:50:32	bd-	i kinda stopped listening to dnb ~2008
2016-10-04 05:50:46	TheCometCE	same here, still some gems here and there though
2016-10-04 05:50:50	bd-	around the time fresh started making this commerical radio shite
2016-10-04 05:51:23	TheCometCE	I was more annoyed that the genre had devolved into "sample amen break, add reese" for too damned long
2016-10-04 05:52:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	as if anyone actually samples the amen anymore
2016-10-04 05:52:25	TheCometCE	thank fucking god that stopped <_<
2016-10-04 05:52:33	AdmiralBumbleBee	more like 'find chopped amen break in pirated sample pack, put glitchy plugin on it'
2016-10-04 05:52:39	adq	dnb is very generic, you have lot of sub genres under dnb flag, and without amen nor reese
2016-10-04 05:53:16	adq	google conf is going to start soon, for those interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4y0KOeXViI

2016-10-04 05:53:24	adq	though i doubt they will talk much about audio
2016-10-04 05:53:28	TheCometCE	I enjoyed when it bled over into other genres, especially if it got super trancey
2016-10-04 05:55:55	bd-	yea i liked a lot of the synthy/trancy dnb
2016-10-04 05:55:55		[05:55]
2016-10-04 05:55:57	bd-	blame etc
2016-10-04 05:56:10	bd-	and some of the more... like ehh psydnb? i guess
2016-10-04 05:56:16	bd-	stuff on fokuz

2016-10-04 05:56:48	TheCometCE	I should dig around and see if I can find some neurofunk territory stuff that has more of a DnB pacing
2016-10-04 05:57:09	TheCometCE	most of it is either glitch or on the downtempo side
2016-10-04 05:57:17	TheCometCE	not that that's a bad thing of course
2016-10-04 05:57:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	adq: announcement! We've successfully increased audio latency! Bigger numbers are better!
2016-10-04 05:57:33	adq	ahah
2016-10-04 05:59:44	TheCometCE	I had nearly a full second a latency once while running too many effects in FL XD
2016-10-04 06:00:02	TheCometCE	too much lookahead and attack on a limiter

2016-10-04 06:02:24	kerrang	yup that was nice
2016-10-04 06:02:33	bd-	i think i get slightly less latency than that
2016-10-04 06:02:39	TheCometCE	that's not bad at all
2016-10-04 06:02:41	adq	drummer
2016-10-04 06:02:43	bd-	but due to using 96khz
2016-10-04 06:02:55	TheCometCE	6.94ms is my latency on my current project, and that's reduced
2016-10-04 06:03:12	TheCometCE	which I don't think is that bad? I've never really fought with it

2016-10-04 08:44:21	kerrang	i mean if you can do everythign vanilla, i'd recommend it
2016-10-04 08:44:37	adq	ahah the ending
2016-10-04 08:44:40	kerrang	well at least for dom manipulation and data fetching if possible
2016-10-04 08:44:44	adq	i cannot spoil it
2016-10-04 08:44:55	adq	:')
2016-10-04 08:45:02	kerrang	i did spend a few months learning how a bunch of those worked together
2016-10-04 08:45:06	kerrang	and gave up
2016-10-04 08:45:48	adq	in few years, it will be more easy for you kerrang
2016-10-04 08:46:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	and this is why I like C, lisp and java.
2016-10-04 08:46:08	adq	you will have learned more languages & stuff, more skills, and you will be able to make parallel and find similar concept in many things
2016-10-04 08:46:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	give me a compiler and I can write anything

2016-10-04 08:46:34	kerrang	web will never get easier
2016-10-04 08:46:47	adq	well, java, when I started, I made a big mistake which makes me hate this language (and platform) for few years
2016-10-04 08:46:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: it's a tangled web we weave
2016-10-04 08:46:51	adq	and i'm still not loving it
2016-10-04 08:46:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	java is quite nice IMO
2016-10-04 08:47:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	at v8
2016-10-04 08:47:03	adq	my mistake was not to take an editor which would autocomplete many things in java
2016-10-04 08:47:09	AdmiralBumbleBee	and the standard library is fantastic.
2016-10-04 08:47:13	adq	because I hadn't the need in C, for example
2016-10-04 08:47:22	adq	and that slowed me down a lot, and makes me hate java a lot
2016-10-04 08:47:31	adq	(like typing import manually/by hands)
2016-10-04 08:47:45	httpster	lol
2016-10-04 08:47:55	httpster	adq programms all of his apps in notepad.exe
2016-10-04 08:47:57	adq	at some point, I learned from my mistakes
2016-10-04 08:48:05	AdmiralBumbleBee	honestly, I rather write clojure or groovy on the jvm
2016-10-04 08:48:07	httpster	then faxes the code to google for releases
2016-10-04 08:48:09	adq	httpster, well, i was very vim enthousiast
2016-10-04 08:48:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	but java itself is reasonable these days
2016-10-04 08:48:23	adq	and other proprietary editor, like borland delphi, or vs, or xcode
2016-10-04 08:48:32	adq	but nothing for java like netbeans or their competitors i don't recall
2016-10-04 08:48:44	adq	i did not use eclipse or intellij, and i should have
2016-10-04 08:48:49	adq	thus lot of hate
2016-10-04 08:48:51	httpster	adq: have you tried intellij?
2016-10-04 08:48:56	adq	i'm using it daily
2016-10-04 08:49:08	adq	it's a bit heavy though, need lot of ram lol
2016-10-04 08:49:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	I _still_ get indexing issues and epic ram usage when I try intellij
2016-10-04 08:49:28	adq	and still not stable like vim, emacs, vs or xcode
2016-10-04 08:49:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's totally unusable
2016-10-04 08:49:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	for me
2016-10-04 08:49:49	adq	i'm using intellij + gradle, intellij reaches easily 3GB of ram after one day
2016-10-04 08:49:58	adq	gradle is a daemon i give like 2GB of ram to it too
2016-10-04 08:50:07	adq	and you can stack few more GB for some tabs & other stuff
2016-10-04 08:50:11	adq	not even counting VMs
2016-10-04 08:50:15	AdmiralBumbleBee	adq: loading all my library definitions easily puts intellij at 5gb... and indexing for life.
2016-10-04 08:50:23	adq	yeah it's crazy
2016-10-04 08:50:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	that's just ON LOAD
2016-10-04 08:50:30	adq	the heaviest editor i have ever used
2016-10-04 08:50:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	before I can even type any text or load a vm or anything
2016-10-04 08:50:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's silly
2016-10-04 08:50:40	adq	I don't get it too
2016-10-04 08:50:55	adq	but i almost have no choice (it's too convinient for android dev)

2016-10-04 09:58:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	asava: if you want a weighted keyboard, it's going to be a pretty personal choice.
2016-10-04 09:59:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	go try stuff in a shop
2016-10-04 09:59:06	samrandomshii	i’m really bad at mixing vocals
2016-10-04 09:59:25	samrandomshii	how do i not suck
2016-10-04 09:59:26	samrandomshii	?
2016-10-04 10:00:04	MSHMTX	make sure the source audio is good
2016-10-04 10:00:31	samrandomshii	right
2016-10-04 10:00:39	MSHMTX	compress
2016-10-04 10:00:52	MSHMTX	and if its a lead vocal it should be the focal point
2016-10-04 10:01:12	MSHMTX	some light saturation and appropriate delay and reverb helps too
2016-10-04 10:01:41	MSHMTX	i dont know too many ppl in here that work with vocalists
2016-10-04 10:01:55	adq	sometimes you have to carve the spectrum to leave space for your vocal, samrandomshii
2016-10-04 10:02:03	adq	instead of mixing vocal, mix the other tracks
2016-10-04 10:02:15	MSHMTX	^^
2016-10-04 10:02:17	MSHMTX	yeah definitely
2016-10-04 10:02:25	samrandomshii	what comes first though ?
2016-10-04 10:02:30	MSHMTX	maybe even sidechain some stuff in the same range to the vocals right?
2016-10-04 10:02:37	adq	but you will always also find that you have to process vocal more or less too
2016-10-04 10:03:02	adq	samrandomshii, i'm not experienced enough with vocal to give advice, so take them lightly
2016-10-04 10:03:55	adq	i think it makes sense, as MSHMTX implicitly said, to get some info liek knowing the frequency range of your vocal
2016-10-04 10:04:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	step 1 probably is making sure the vocals don't suck to begin with
2016-10-04 10:04:12	MSHMTX	and dont do anything too drastic
2016-10-04 10:04:15	adq	so you can plan in advance to not clash with a lead synth in the same range
2016-10-04 10:04:16	MSHMTX	I said that already
2016-10-04 10:04:22	adq	or at least, don't play them at same time
2016-10-04 10:04:22	MSHMTX	a strong recording is most of it
2016-10-04 10:04:25	adq	yup
2016-10-04 10:05:17	samrandomshii	so treat it like the lead synth  ?
2016-10-04 10:05:28	MSHMTX	somewhat yeah
2016-10-04 10:05:35	MSHMTX	it should be in a similar place in the mix
2016-10-04 10:05:47	MSHMTX	maybe a bit lower volume than a big lead
2016-10-04 10:06:52	adq	another thing is the melody part, where ppl fix cents or semitone(s) of the vocal to keep them right where they should (gentle autotune, melodyne, etc)
2016-10-04 10:07:47	adq	also those double, triple or even quadruple (i heard recently) technics of de-duplicating the vocals
2016-10-04 10:08:01	adq	man, like anything with audio this is endless all the things you could do
2016-10-04 10:08:38	samrandomshii	is melodyne or autotune the only ways of pitching vocals  ?
2016-10-04 10:08:51	adq	i don't think so, but they are famous enough so you get the idea
2016-10-04 10:09:04	samrandomshii	why wont pitching them up or down in ableton give me the same result  ?
2016-10-04 10:09:21	adq	because those algo are not trivial, it's rarely shipped with a daw like a basic pitch shifter
2016-10-04 10:09:40	adq	(and a basic pitch shifter is not even trivial too)
2016-10-04 10:11:07	Kimryd	I made one of those once
2016-10-04 10:11:07		[10:11]
2016-10-04 10:11:16	Kimryd	but it wasn't 100%

2016-10-04 10:12:19	adq	it does not always sound good tbh
2016-10-04 10:12:42	adq	and it's destructive, if you pitch down let's say, one octave
2016-10-04 10:12:49	adq	then you pitch up the result again an octave up
2016-10-04 10:13:02	adq	you're not close enough to the original signal
2016-10-04 10:13:35	adq	but still, it's great code & great explanation & decent result & decent computational cost
2016-10-04 10:13:40	_Hex_	samrandomshii: what sort of vocal sound are you going for?
2016-10-04 10:14:38	samrandomshii	so i did this song
2016-10-04 10:14:48	samrandomshii	but the vocals were clashing with the song
2016-10-04 10:14:59	_Hex_	got anything i can listen to?

2016-10-04 10:15:45	samrandomshii	i had the guy sing on this song but i’m not really proud of the mixing
2016-10-04 10:16:06	adq	damn it sounds a bit like raz, but without baby voice
2016-10-04 10:16:07	_Hex_	okay
2016-10-04 10:16:14	_Hex_	so..you're not going for hifi at all
2016-10-04 10:16:17	_Hex_	basically do this
2016-10-04 10:16:22	samrandomshii	not for this one
2016-10-04 10:16:22	_Hex_	mute your instruments
2016-10-04 10:16:32	_Hex_	just have vocal + bass + drums
2016-10-04 10:16:37	_Hex_	and get them sitting well together
2016-10-04 10:16:43	_Hex_	then bring your instrumental underneath
2016-10-04 10:16:45	raz	i kinda like it
2016-10-04 10:16:53	raz	the singing is too weird even for me tho
2016-10-04 10:16:56	adq	lol
2016-10-04 10:17:05	adq	you're lying, obviously
2016-10-04 10:17:25	_Hex_	you'll find a point where the low mid doesn't clash
2016-10-04 10:17:25	_Hex_	and at this point you decide
2016-10-04 10:17:25	raz	maybe a baby voice would help
2016-10-04 10:17:25	_Hex_	do you keep the low mid there and bring up the tops
2016-10-04 10:17:25	_Hex_	or do you push the instruments up higher

2016-10-04 10:17:26	_Hex_	and instead dip some of the clash areas
2016-10-04 10:17:59	samrandomshii	and if i were to keep the higher frequencies ?
2016-10-04 10:18:08	samrandomshii	only during the middle part
2016-10-04 10:18:08	_Hex_	on what?
2016-10-04 10:18:18	_Hex_	it's the low mids and mids which are clashing with the vocal
2016-10-04 10:18:18	samrandomshii	the vocals
2016-10-04 10:18:23	_Hex_	the voice has no highs
2016-10-04 10:18:32	_Hex_	you need to choose your vocal
2016-10-04 10:18:33	_Hex_	err
2016-10-04 10:18:34	_Hex_	focal
2016-10-04 10:18:34	_Hex_	point
2016-10-04 10:18:36	_Hex_	so if that's the vocals
2016-10-04 10:18:40	samrandomshii	i specifically removed the highs
2016-10-04 10:18:42	_Hex_	and you want the vocals to have the high end
2016-10-04 10:18:51	_Hex_	then you need to balance the top end of other elements with that
2016-10-04 10:19:28	_Hex_	there are basically 2 easy trains of thoughts with vocals
2016-10-04 10:19:35	_Hex_	you're either keeping them natural
2016-10-04 10:19:45	_Hex_	or you're processing them so they're obviously effected
2016-10-04 10:19:52	_Hex_	if you try and go 1/2 way in between
2016-10-04 10:20:02	_Hex_	people know what a voice is meant to sound like so if it's 1/2 done on either
2016-10-04 10:20:06	_Hex_	it tends to just sound wrong
2016-10-04 10:20:08	_Hex_	so..
2016-10-04 10:20:17	_Hex_	if you're going for that more telephone sound (obviously effected)
2016-10-04 10:20:18	_Hex_	that's fine
2016-10-04 10:20:21	MSHMTX	_Hex_ knows what hes doing
2016-10-04 10:20:23	adq	Kimryd, i wanted you to know that I listened to it, but I don't really like the track, on the contrary I listened to "I Have A Passion For Throwing Myself Out Of Moving Vehicles" which this one i'm ok with it though on this last one you seem to have worked less on the mix (but at least i like it lol) than the one you just pasted
2016-10-04 10:20:26	_Hex_	but if you want a more natural tone
2016-10-04 10:20:31	_Hex_	i.e. bring some highs back in
2016-10-04 10:20:39	_Hex_	then you'll need to fit other things around them
2016-10-04 10:20:49	Kimryd	adq, you're right I worked less on the mix of the last
2016-10-04 10:20:54	Kimryd	I prefer this one lol
2016-10-04 10:21:03	Kimryd	not-mix wise, I mean
2016-10-04 10:21:07	samrandomshii	that makes a lot of sense
2016-10-04 10:21:31	_Hex_	get drums/bass/vocals right
2016-10-04 10:21:36	_Hex_	and the rest kind of slots into place i find
2016-10-04 10:21:48	_Hex_	arrangmeent is key too
2016-10-04 10:21:51	_Hex_	if you have a lead synth

2016-10-04 10:22:00	_Hex_	or if it is
2016-10-04 10:22:02	_Hex_	low pass it
2016-10-04 10:22:04	_Hex_	or something
2016-10-04 10:22:06	_Hex_	get it out of the way
2016-10-04 10:22:08	_Hex_	so one has focus
2016-10-04 10:22:19	_Hex_	or...maybe it's doubling what the vocal is doing
2016-10-04 10:22:26	_Hex_	in that case meld them together

2016-10-04 10:24:35	_Hex_	or do you mean micro pitch tuning?
2016-10-04 10:24:41	samrandomshii	like when i pitch vocals up 3 semitones
2016-10-04 10:24:48	_Hex_	oh..yeah..they're going to sound like pitched vocals
2016-10-04 10:24:48	samrandomshii	the vocals become weird
2016-10-04 10:24:57	_Hex_	you could try and pitch then shift formants down
2016-10-04 10:25:04	_Hex_	but it's not going to sound totally natural
2016-10-04 10:25:17	samrandomshii	how do i shift formants down ?
2016-10-04 10:25:20	XMPPwocky	adq: yeah, they actually do accurate modelling of old DACs
2016-10-04 10:25:26	_Hex_	with a processor that shifts formats
2016-10-04 10:25:28	_Hex_	formants
2016-10-04 10:26:16	XMPPwocky	you can get anything from just bitcrushing, to mu-law bitcrushing (like digital telephones), to prediction coding (speak-n-spell ish, similar to Bitspeek w/ less options)
2016-10-04 10:26:16		[10:26]
2016-10-04 10:26:24	_Hex_	but you do need to make a decision

2016-10-04 10:26:41	_Hex_	then either re-record in the appropriate key
2016-10-04 10:26:43	_Hex_	or just embrace it

2016-10-04 10:27:01	XMPPwocky	they also have PWM and PDM which you... might want, but you need to turn your shit way down first
2016-10-04 10:27:06	XMPPwocky	yeah
2016-10-04 10:27:09	samrandomshii	one last thing
2016-10-04 10:27:11	XMPPwocky	it's really, really nasty
2016-10-04 10:27:12	adq	wondering if they find the code somewhere, or if they reverse it themselves
2016-10-04 10:27:37	adq	(i had an apple //c and IIe, i can remember the weird noisy vocal, rarely, in few game)
2016-10-04 10:27:40	XMPPwocky	adq: i know chipsounds is partially from patents and partially from data they got from manufacturers themselves
2016-10-04 10:27:50	samrandomshii	why is pitching particular words of an audio file different in melodyne from just pitching that segment up or down in a sampler ?
2016-10-04 10:28:06	XMPPwocky	adq: the fun part about pwm is that the carrier wave is somewhere around 12000KHz
2016-10-04 10:28:11	XMPPwocky	full scale
2016-10-04 10:28:16	adq	that's fast
2016-10-04 10:28:22	XMPPwocky	so if you accidentally use pwm mode without the low pass on the output
2016-10-04 10:28:24	XMPPwocky	rip your ears
2016-10-04 10:28:26	_Hex_	pitching up/down in a sampler is usually just changing how quickly something is played
2016-10-04 10:28:37	_Hex_	so the faster it's played..the higher up in pitch it will be
2016-10-04 10:28:40	samrandomshii	with warp modes in ableton ?

2016-10-04 10:30:03	_Hex_	z-plane is great actually
2016-10-04 10:30:04	samrandomshii	yup
2016-10-04 10:30:04	adq	i have no idea, i think warp == stretch
2016-10-04 10:30:07	adq	so they pitch + stretch
2016-10-04 10:30:12	adq	so it keeps playing at same rate
2016-10-04 10:30:26	adq	(otherwise we all know the effect of playing at different SR a track with a fixed SR)
2016-10-04 10:30:32	adq	(it's pure pitch up/down)
2016-10-04 10:30:35	_Hex_	does ableton allow you to choose which pitching algorithm?
2016-10-04 10:30:47	samrandomshii	it does
2016-10-04 10:30:51	samrandomshii	it has 4 or 5

2016-10-04 10:34:29	_Hex_	so you're always monitoring through autotune..if anything is triggering fucked sounding tuning
2016-10-04 10:34:35	_Hex_	it's probably not worth the hassle of that part

2016-10-05 05:47:40	Mikarin_	Do you know how many tracks in the world has 808 kick or 909 open hihat?
2016-10-05 05:48:00	Roller	no
2016-10-05 05:48:07	Roller	you usually chop the break
2016-10-05 05:48:10	wrl	yeah
2016-10-05 05:48:14	Roller	you use the rhythm and rearrange it
2016-10-05 05:48:22	wrl	this is 2016, using a break verbatim is long past basic bitch shit
2016-10-05 05:48:32	Roller	ok..
2016-10-05 05:48:37	Roller	he just asked do you layer a looped break
2016-10-05 05:48:41	wrl	chop + rearrange
2016-10-05 05:48:53	Roller	usually layering up the hits with your own drums

2016-10-05 05:49:10	raz	for brownie points, chop up *multiple* breaks and mix them together

2016-10-05 05:49:21	Roller	yeah i use more than one break
2016-10-05 05:49:23	kerrang	this is why i ask
2016-10-05 05:49:23	wrl	multiple breaks, layering, etc
2016-10-05 05:49:49	kerrang	that the type of dnb beat i love, but post basically just layers other breaks on top
2016-10-05 05:50:03	Roller	that guy is uhh
2016-10-05 05:50:04	Roller	what
2016-10-05 05:50:12	wrl	layer samples together for the actual important drum hits
2016-10-05 05:50:13	Roller	you don't just use a straight break nowadays as wrl said
2016-10-05 05:50:14	wrl	kick + snare
2016-10-05 05:50:20	kerrang	yeah, i could chop them up, but the idea is still the same, you don't actually program with midi
2016-10-05 05:50:22	wrl	use breaks for the feel
2016-10-05 05:50:28	Roller	layering can be fucked up but sometimes it works
2016-10-05 05:50:35	Roller	i usually drop the breaks kick and snare
2016-10-05 05:50:38	wrl	or if you're real slick, use bfd or addictive drums or ssd or whatever and do your own breaks
2016-10-05 05:50:43	Roller	but the snare usually adds character
2016-10-05 05:50:44	wrl	Roller: yeah not a bad plan
2016-10-05 05:50:45	wrl	yeah
2016-10-05 05:50:55	wrl	i like chopping out all the snare of a break and cycling between them
2016-10-05 05:51:02	Roller	yeah you get a nice timbre variation
2016-10-05 05:51:08	bd-	i don't like using break samples, just feels wrong
2016-10-05 05:51:12	Roller	the kick is too much issue with phasing
2016-10-05 05:51:15	Roller	i usually cba to fiddle with it
2016-10-05 05:51:25	bd-	but writing own drum patterns and getting them sounding good is pretty difficult
2016-10-05 05:51:36	kerrang	guess this is why dnb artists make their own breaks separately and build a library (i assume)
2016-10-05 05:51:40	wrl	yep
2016-10-05 05:51:41	Roller	you can write your own patterns, and use break hits for a more organic sound
2016-10-05 05:51:49	Roller	or vice versa use a break to inspire your patterns

2016-10-05 05:54:46	Roller	makes it sound olllld
2016-10-05 05:54:57	Roller	makes me wonder if it would work sped up
2016-10-05 05:54:59	adq	it's not the bpm, it's the arrangement & sound design
2016-10-05 05:55:03	Roller	you reckon?
2016-10-05 05:55:05	adq	which makes me think that
2016-10-05 05:55:22	adq	and it's more close to jungle than dnb
2016-10-05 05:55:22	Roller	i do agree but for me i instantly recoginsed the bpm
2016-10-05 05:55:30	adq	but no, i don't reckon it specifically
2016-10-05 05:55:46	adq	but i recog the vibe for sure
2016-10-05 05:55:52	Roller	yeah definitely that vibe
2016-10-05 05:56:17	Roller	bd-: not to piss anyone off but dnb takes a certain finesse in terms of, you don't actually have much space to work with?
2016-10-05 05:56:43	adq	it's a difficult genre to produce, it makes it even more interesting
2016-10-05 05:56:45	kerrang	i just want to get good at making breaks in general
2016-10-05 05:56:56	kerrang	then that can be applied to a few other genres too

2016-10-05 05:57:39	adq	for sure kerrang
2016-10-05 05:57:50	Roller	well, just my opinion but i think slower bpms allow more room for sounds to breathe
2016-10-05 05:57:53	kerrang	Roller: bitwig, basically the same thing
2016-10-05 05:58:13	Roller	dnb you have not as much real estate and have to choose your palette carefully and then work with it
2016-10-05 05:58:21	bd-	depends on the type on dnb tbh
2016-10-05 05:58:28	Roller	ofc there's no hard rule

2016-10-05 06:18:47	raz	Kimryd: kinda like the sound but the chords are lame till 2:20, sounds like brown notes too
2016-10-05 06:18:47	Kimryd	bbut it went away
2016-10-05 06:18:51	raz	from 2:20 it gets better
2016-10-05 06:18:54	bd-	what kind of problem
2016-10-05 06:19:03	Kimryd	I'll record a gif
2016-10-05 06:19:26	raz	the breaks from 3:40 are great
2016-10-05 06:19:39	raz	from there i dig the tune so far
2016-10-05 06:19:54	Roller	i think you need to smooth out the arrangement
2016-10-05 06:19:57	raz	almost one of these cases of 'just throw the first half away'
2016-10-05 06:20:00	Kimryd	sank u very nice, the mix tho?
2016-10-05 06:20:02	Roller	i get variation but
2016-10-05 06:20:13	Roller	it needs to be a little more progressive?
2016-10-05 06:20:27	raz	can't judge mix, sounds well enough on my laptop speakers...
2016-10-05 06:20:39	Kimryd	Roller, vagueness
2016-10-05 06:20:48	Roller	sorry
2016-10-05 06:21:15	raz	yea i'd just scrap everything before 3:40, or it will take tons of fixing work.. the 2nd part i dig
2016-10-05 06:21:26	Roller	i think you have too much going on in the drums in terms of variated patterns
2016-10-05 06:21:30	Roller	leave the fills to end of phrase
2016-10-05 06:21:39	Roller	it stops me from settling into a groove

2016-10-05 06:22:13	Kimryd	bd-, anywayz my shit ain't werq so basically when I turn a knob, which is automatically mapped to a macro (a la Live) via the controller script, the values happen like

2016-10-05 06:22:20	Kimryd	rather than, say, sine
2016-10-05 06:22:37	Kimryd	when I turn it, it just just all over, no curvature between values if that makes sense
2016-10-05 06:22:47	Kimryd	doesn't seem to follow any logic
2016-10-05 06:23:04	bd-	isn't there an option for resolution of the knobs?
2016-10-05 06:23:08	bd-	cause there's stepped i think?
2016-10-05 06:23:12	bd-	at least they are on bsp
2016-10-05 06:23:37	Kimryd	Yes, there is, I looked at the script and there's a line that drew my attention but I didn't edit it cuz idfknowhatimdoing
2016-10-05 06:23:56	bd-	unless you have 1:1 precision then you'd need to interpolate the input somehow
2016-10-05 06:24:14	Kimryd	Oh!
2016-10-05 06:24:33	Kimryd	I set the knobs mode to Realtive #2 (whatever that is), rather than absolute and the jumping stopped
2016-10-05 06:24:38	Kimryd	but now the accceleration is nil
2016-10-05 06:24:48	Kimryd	relative*
2016-10-05 06:24:53	Roller	absolute is 1-0 i think
2016-10-05 06:25:00	Roller	relative is to the increments of the knob
2016-10-05 06:25:07	Kimryd	I see...
2016-10-05 06:25:10	bd-	ah
2016-10-05 06:25:21	Kimryd	So relative #3 = 3 values?
2016-10-05 06:25:36	Kimryd	+/-
2016-10-05 06:25:55	Roller	possibly i mean i don't know bitwig well or scripting, i just know in ableton you can open the midi and set relative, absolute and change the variable for how far it opens and closes
2016-10-05 06:26:03	Kimryd	Everything works fine in live btw and I think that takeover / pickup is the problem
2016-10-05 06:26:14	Roller	ahh
2016-10-05 06:26:21	Kimryd	They're endless encoders
2016-10-05 06:26:24	Roller	can't you disable the midi input in lie control panel?
2016-10-05 06:26:29	Kimryd	no...
2016-10-05 06:26:32	Roller	i'm sure you can
2016-10-05 06:26:34	Kimryd	there's no option, anywhere
2016-10-05 06:26:39	Roller	there is let me open it up
2016-10-05 06:26:39	Kimryd	No, trust me, I google'd
2016-10-05 06:26:49	Roller	you know in preferences
2016-10-05 06:26:50	Roller	when it says
2016-10-05 06:26:54	Kimryd	the only way would be to do like nektar did, and make a "Soft takeover" in the script
2016-10-05 06:27:06	Kimryd	and I don't know js or where to put it
2016-10-05 06:27:10	Roller	track sync remote

2016-10-05 06:27:37	Kimryd	unfortunately...
2016-10-05 06:27:46	Roller	i know but if there's a conflict because live is tracking your midi controller
2016-10-05 06:27:49	Roller	you can disable one of the options

2016-10-05 06:28:37	Kimryd	I used a midi monitor to see if there were lots of messages but that's a negatory
2016-10-05 06:28:37	Roller	i can't remember which is which but track sync and remote all represent in out and clock sync
2016-10-05 06:28:44	Roller	ahh oka

2016-10-05 06:31:43	Roller	you tried that?
2016-10-05 06:31:53	Kimryd	I tried using different scripts like the generic ones
2016-10-05 06:31:54	Kimryd	No dice
2016-10-05 06:32:00	Kimryd	I did this for 3 hours this morning
2016-10-05 06:32:06	Roller	turn everything blue click on a control and wiggle knob :/
2016-10-05 06:32:10	bd-	what's the script for or do? isn't it just regular midi shit it ouputs?
2016-10-05 06:32:16	Roller	it should be that simple, strange your having issues
2016-10-05 06:32:26	Kimryd	I allows bi-directional communication, automapping, etc
2016-10-05 06:32:32	bd-	ah right
2016-10-05 06:32:41	Kimryd	turns the beatstep into 4-5 controllers
2016-10-05 06:32:49	Kimryd	like a mini-push
2016-10-05 06:32:57	Roller	have you figured out if it's the script or not?
2016-10-05 06:33:04	Roller	like if you don't use the script can you map fine in midi mapping
2016-10-05 06:33:23	Kimryd	I'm convinced it is takeover of whatever due to the fact that multiple scripts all failed
2016-10-05 06:33:26	bd-	i really wish the Push was standalone
2016-10-05 06:33:29	Kimryd	or*

2016-10-06 12:40:21	_Hex_	i've been using dorrough forever now
2016-10-06 12:40:35	_Hex_	but i feel like i should be applying LU in my workflow
2016-10-06 12:40:51	_Hex_	from what I understnad it's perceptually modeled for loudness?
2016-10-06 12:40:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	yep
2016-10-06 12:41:03	_Hex_	right..
2016-10-06 12:41:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	but I really don't see any benefit except for deliverables
2016-10-06 12:41:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	which I don't deal with
2016-10-06 12:41:14	_Hex_	so it'd give a better indication of apparent loudness vs rms
2016-10-06 12:41:41	_Hex_	i believe spotify and itunes and all that shit are working off LU now
2016-10-06 12:41:59	_Hex_	so if you play songs in a playlist everything is brought in line based on their LU measurements
2016-10-06 12:42:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	you can run with r128 for most online services
2016-10-06 12:42:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's usually -1 off luFS
2016-10-06 12:42:44	_Hex_	mmm..still based on LU though
2016-10-06 12:42:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	obviously if you have a choice, luFS is better to go with right now
2016-10-06 12:42:52	AdmiralBumbleBee	just straight up
2016-10-06 12:42:53	_Hex_	there are differing standards
2016-10-06 12:42:58	_Hex_	but all based on LU aren't they
2016-10-06 12:42:58	_Hex_	?
2016-10-06 12:43:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	kinda?
2016-10-06 12:43:28	AdmiralBumbleBee	r128 doesn't use lufs
2016-10-06 12:43:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	that other one does
2016-10-06 12:43:33	AdmiralBumbleBee	1770 or whatever
2016-10-06 12:44:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	r128 gives other guidelines that can be met without luFS measurement
2016-10-06 12:44:34	_Hex_	mmm
2016-10-06 12:44:42	_Hex_	okay..but aren't they still based on loudness units?
2016-10-06 12:45:02	_Hex_	just differences like you might get with k-12 and k-14
2016-10-06 12:45:04	_Hex_	or some other shit?
2016-10-06 12:45:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	they're 'loudness unit' based measurements
2016-10-06 12:45:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	so yes
2016-10-06 12:45:19	_Hex_	Basically EBU R 128 recommends to normalize audio at -23 LUFS ±0.5 LU (±1 LU for live programmes), measured with a relative gate at -10 LU.
2016-10-06 12:45:23	_Hex_	yeah..
2016-10-06 12:45:33	_Hex_	okay..so it's not a completely different loudness unit measurement
2016-10-06 12:45:50	_Hex_	it's more a "deliver this based on these loudness unit rules"
2016-10-06 12:45:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	well there's multiple loudness unit measurements
2016-10-06 12:46:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	usually when someone says 'luFS' they mean the 1770 standard though
2016-10-06 12:46:55	_Hex_	hmm
2016-10-06 12:46:58	_Hex_	now i'm confused
2016-10-06 12:47:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	great, then you understand
2016-10-06 12:47:09	_Hex_	because it makes zero sense adopting multiple perceptual measurements
2016-10-06 12:47:17	_Hex_	i thought there was a loudness unit spec
2016-10-06 12:47:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	there's multiple international standards for LU
2016-10-06 12:47:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	british standard
2016-10-06 12:47:28	AdmiralBumbleBee	european standard
2016-10-06 12:47:33	AdmiralBumbleBee	american broadcasting standard
2016-10-06 12:47:36	_Hex_	yes..but..okay..hear me out
2016-10-06 12:47:41	_Hex_	and with a simplistic example
2016-10-06 12:47:48	_Hex_	let's say you have an RMS meter
2016-10-06 12:48:00	_Hex_	with british standard..european etc
2016-10-06 12:48:06	_Hex_	it's still measuring the RMS value
2016-10-06 12:48:14	_Hex_	and then adapting depending on spec
2016-10-06 12:48:22	_Hex_	that underlying RMS shouldn't change
2016-10-06 12:48:24	_Hex_	?
2016-10-06 12:48:34	AdmiralBumbleBee	it does change
2016-10-06 12:48:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	because the windows, decay etc.. change based on the standard
2016-10-06 12:49:00	_Hex_	and the same applies with LU?
2016-10-06 12:49:06	_Hex_	they are all measuring shit differently?
2016-10-06 12:49:15	AdmiralBumbleBee	yep, because there's different LU measurement standards
2016-10-06 12:49:30	_Hex_	 Despite the different names, LFKS and LUFS are  identical. Both terms describe the same phenomenon and just like LKFS, one unit of LUFS is equal to one dB.
2016-10-06 12:49:30	_Hex_	LKFS/LUFS are absolute measures, and depending on which broadcast standard is in use, the loudness target level could be e.g. -24 LKFS or -23 LUFS. However, in order to aim for a more 'traditional number', a relative measure has been defined:  Loudness Units (LU). Now, the broadcaster can set the target level (regardless of whether it is -23 or -24) to 0 LU, and again, one LU is equal
2016-10-06 12:49:30	_Hex_	to one dB.
2016-10-06 12:49:40	AdmiralBumbleBee	what you quoted lookes like 1770
2016-10-06 12:49:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	which is the main one
2016-10-06 12:49:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	that most shit is based on now

2016-10-06 12:55:21	_Hex_	i'm just curious as some of the mixes i like to ref are fucking slammed rms wise
2016-10-06 12:55:42	_Hex_	but seem to not be as loud on the loudness meter
2016-10-06 12:55:47	_Hex_	and more dynamic than you might expect
2016-10-06 12:56:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	some of the mixes I've seen you post are clearly clipped somehow and sound fine
2016-10-06 12:56:09	_Hex_	oh 100%
2016-10-06 12:56:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'm actually rather curious what trend is causing that
2016-10-06 12:56:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	what equipment is the hotshit for that now
2016-10-06 12:56:30	_Hex_	mixes i've posted of mine or other peoples?
2016-10-06 12:56:34	AdmiralBumbleBee	other people's
2016-10-06 12:56:42	_Hex_	no idea what they're using
2016-10-06 12:56:54	_Hex_	i use kclip, inflator, t-racks clipper
2016-10-06 12:57:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	have you looked at standardclip?
2016-10-06 12:57:10	_Hex_	no
2016-10-06 12:57:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	it has a much better AA filter than kclip
2016-10-06 12:57:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	MUCH better.
2016-10-06 12:57:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	not that kclip is bad
2016-10-06 12:57:29	_Hex_	ibetter than kclip v2?
2016-10-06 12:57:34	AdmiralBumbleBee	that, I don't know
2016-10-06 12:57:40	_Hex_	that was completely redone
2016-10-06 12:57:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	I haven't looked at kclip 2 yet
2016-10-06 12:57:46	_Hex_	that said
2016-10-06 12:57:49	_Hex_	you hate mh channelstrip too
2016-10-06 12:57:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	well that thing aliases like a mother fucker
2016-10-06 12:57:59	AdmiralBumbleBee	the eq is broken
2016-10-06 12:58:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	and so is the compressor
2016-10-06 12:58:06	_Hex_	i can't say it's ever bothered me
2016-10-06 12:58:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	objectively... it's bad :P
2016-10-06 12:58:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	but
2016-10-06 12:58:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	so is a distorted guitar amp
2016-10-06 12:58:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	so...
2016-10-06 12:58:23	 *	AdmiralBumbleBee shrugs
2016-10-06 12:58:24	_Hex_	i can't argue with serban
2016-10-06 12:58:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	first time I used MH channel, it just hit me with "That doesn't sound right... soemthing is wrong"
2016-10-06 12:58:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	and I never got passed that.
2016-10-06 12:58:56	_Hex_	weird
2016-10-06 12:59:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	sometimes folks get passed that and do great shit with it anyway
2016-10-06 12:59:08	_Hex_	i think that's one plug i'd find hard to do without
2016-10-06 12:59:29	_Hex_	it has EQ curves i haven't found in another plug
2016-10-06 12:59:47	_Hex_	and is so retarded fast to use
2016-10-06 13:00:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	I don't doubt that it's useful
2016-10-06 13:00:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	just... I never got to that point.
2016-10-06 13:00:31	_Hex_	i actually think neutron might duplicate the curves
2016-10-06 13:00:37	_Hex_	i've yet to completely test
2016-10-06 13:00:43	_Hex_	but that's one of the things i asked for in their alloy 3 plug
2016-10-06 13:00:47	_Hex_	which i guess turned into neutron
2016-10-06 13:01:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'm kinda confused that they are still selling alloy

2016-10-06 13:02:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	the overlap between neutron and ozone seems to pretty much totally cover alloy
2016-10-06 13:02:47	_Hex_	hmm
2016-10-06 13:02:47	_Hex_	nope
2016-10-06 13:03:08	_Hex_	you know..i was so pumped for neutron
2016-10-06 13:03:13	_Hex_	but it just lacks what alloy can do
2016-10-06 13:03:19	_Hex_	althoguh it does other things

2016-10-07 04:42:49	TimbreWolfVM	[12:49:26] it's an analogue VST [12:49:26]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	adq	[12:49:33] not bad, but not good enough [12:49:33]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	TimbreWolfVM	[12:49:34] with true analogue components [12:49:34]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	kerrang	[12:50:07] adq: that's the best i've seen recently [12:50:07]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	kerrang	[12:50:32] at least for the WD blacks [12:50:32]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	adq	[12:50:32] you should reason in price/TB [12:50:32]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	adq	[12:50:43] like for food, always reason in price/kG [12:50:43]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	adq	[12:50:50] kg* [12:50:50]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	adq	[12:51:19] so instead of 2 internal of 1TB, you will find cheaper options with 1 internal of 2TB [12:51:19]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	kerrang	[12:52:28] aight, i'll just keep an eye out and do some comparisons later this weekend [12:52:28]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	adq	[12:52:42] i think i need more TB too [12:52:42]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	adq	[12:53:19] I don't really mind the brand or the model, will look too [12:53:19]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	adq	[12:54:22] TimbreWolfVM, still riding your analog horse, it's crazy [12:54:22]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	TimbreWolfVM	[12:54:43] using plugins is fucking crazy man [12:54:43]

2016-10-07 04:42:49	kerrang	[12:55:51] apparently the game Inside sound track was recorded with sounds being played to a _human skull_ via a contact mic [12:55:51]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	kerrang	[12:56:19] i want that impulse response [12:56:19]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	adq	[12:56:40] nope, i just seeked quickly [12:56:40]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	kerrang	[12:56:46] “Eventually all the teeth fell out of the skull because of the vibrations,” [12:56:46]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	adq	[12:56:50] i hear lot of mono saw tooth + resonance [12:56:50]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	bd-	[12:57:03] those tracks sound alright actually, like some mid 90s hard trance style [12:57:03]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	TimbreWolfVM	[12:57:04] lol [12:57:04]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	TimbreWolfVM	[12:57:14] thanks [12:57:14]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	bd-	[12:57:26] it's still a shitty synth though [12:57:26]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	TimbreWolfVM	[12:57:32] i'm going to add the DrumBrute to my timbrewolf [12:57:32]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	TimbreWolfVM	[12:57:39] and then use the wolf a bit different [12:57:39]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	TimbreWolfVM	[12:57:45] gonna combine nicely i think [12:57:45]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	TimbreWolfVM	[12:57:57] especially as the timbre wolf makes very solid basses without resonance [12:57:57]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	Ycros	[12:58:23] rad, definitely want to have a play with one [12:58:23]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	TimbreWolfVM	[13:02:08] the DrumBrute? it's kind of the only solid affordable analog drumcomputer right now [13:02:08]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	TimbreWolfVM	[13:02:22] the mfb ones lack "air" if that's the right word [13:02:22]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	TimbreWolfVM	[13:07:09] funny how it has two different kicks.. i wonder if one could be used as solid bassline replacement [13:07:09]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	Ycros	[13:07:43] yeah maybe. sometimes it's nice to have two different kicks in a track though [13:07:43]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	TimbreWolfVM	[13:08:32] hope it's better than the initial minibrute regarding controls [13:08:32]
2016-10-07 04:42:49	TimbreWolfVM	[13:09:05] in terms of precise pots [13:09:05]

2016-10-07 05:39:25	phantasy	[15:22:23] just fucked around with some drums and a deadmau5 pluck preset i made [15:22:23]
2016-10-07 05:39:25	phantasy	[15:22:29] not original [15:22:29]
2016-10-07 05:39:25	ulex	[15:24:46] that ambient sound is nice [15:24:46]
2016-10-07 05:39:25	phantasy	[15:27:02] thanks dogg [15:27:02]
2016-10-07 05:39:25	phantasy	[15:27:15] im really just concerned about the drums mix and that sound [15:27:15]
2016-10-07 05:39:25	phantasy	[15:27:27] what do you think of them drums [15:27:27]
2016-10-07 05:39:25	ulex	[15:27:45] haha they are really weak [15:27:45]
2016-10-07 05:39:25	phantasy	[15:27:56] in what way? [15:27:56]
2016-10-07 05:39:25	phantasy	[15:28:04] like how can i make it better [15:28:04]
2016-10-07 05:39:25	phantasy	[15:30:22] come on don't tell me the mix is weak without giving me a reason that does me no good [15:30:22]
2016-10-07 05:39:25	ulex	[15:31:04] well it's first important to get better samples , you using stock daw drums ? [15:31:04]
2016-10-07 05:39:25	phantasy	[15:31:21] these are battery 4 samples [15:31:21]
2016-10-07 05:39:25	phantasy	[15:31:42] 3 layers each drum except the hh [15:31:42]
2016-10-07 05:39:25	phantasy	[15:31:46] thats just 1 sound [15:31:46]
2016-10-07 05:39:25	phantasy	[15:32:16] i think i can make the HH sound cooler if i add a hint of return channel reverb and a hint of delay to make it sound bigger [15:32:16]
2016-10-07 05:39:25	phantasy	[15:34:09] like a 12 millisecond delay time would be the titties [15:34:09]
2016-10-07 05:39:25	phantasy	[15:34:41] my only real concern is that the high end will be way too much once i push this shit into a limiter at the end of my master chain [15:34:41]
2016-10-07 05:39:25	bd-	[15:34:54] i don't think the drums are weak, at least not in the context of that style of track [15:34:54]
2016-10-07 05:39:25	bd-	[15:35:03] maybe 1 layer too many if anything [15:35:03]
2016-10-07 05:39:25	phantasy	[15:35:23] which drum? [15:35:23]
2016-10-07 05:39:25	bd-	[15:35:30] kick mainly [15:35:30]

2016-10-07 05:42:26	wrl	do deadlifts bruh

2016-10-07 05:42:31	wrl	get dat swole lower back
2016-10-07 05:42:33	bd-	i can't use daw and synths at same time so i have to get up and move between one seat and another very often
2016-10-07 05:42:43	wrl	you probably won't meet fine women at the deadlift spot
2016-10-07 05:44:51	phantasy	this is true^^
2016-10-07 05:46:16	bd-	phantasy: don't normally listen to stuff like that but i think that track is pretty decent
2016-10-07 05:46:50	phantasy	thanks bd- what do you usually listen to?
2016-10-07 05:47:31	bd-	ehh, everything electronic
2016-10-07 05:47:37	bd-	but techno a bit less than other genres
2016-10-07 05:48:23	phantasy	nice
2016-10-07 05:49:21	bd-	most techno i've listened to is that more minimal style, not sure what it's called exactly

2016-10-07 05:50:29	phantasy	that track is more techno-influenced than anything, definitely NOT purist's techno
2016-10-07 05:53:59	bd-	not really for me, although i do like the sort of 90s rave/breaks bit in the middle

2016-10-07 13:56:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	maybe in your DAW, maybe some software mixer, maybe the cable is wrong

2016-10-07 14:10:18	krk_	i read on the internet it says it is something with the power

2016-10-07 14:10:36	krk_	how can i minimize that on the pc too

2016-10-07 14:11:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	raz: neither have most codecs.

2016-10-07 14:14:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	until you're used to them
2016-10-07 14:14:58	krk_	:D
2016-10-07 14:15:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	depends on how much material you listen to, how often you move around the room (this is a good thing)
2016-10-07 14:15:05	AdmiralBumbleBee	how much you pay attention
2016-10-07 14:15:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	how much you use them to produce/mix
2016-10-07 14:15:10	krk_	another thing
2016-10-07 14:15:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	etc..
2016-10-07 14:16:35	krk_	before having the new speakers, i was working on "bad" left monitor, and now even when i am in the middle i feel like the mono sound is coming from the left monitor
2016-10-07 14:16:45	krk_	i have to move more to the right to hear it in the center
2016-10-07 14:17:00	krk_	the monitors are set equally on the table
2016-10-07 14:17:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	were you using the same cable before?
2016-10-07 14:17:32	krk_	does it have something to do with the "used to" the bad monitor or i am not sitting exactly properly?
2016-10-07 14:17:40	krk_	no
2016-10-07 14:17:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	there's no way to tell.
2016-10-07 14:17:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	you may have become used to it, maybe your room is shit, maybe you have ear cancer
2016-10-07 14:18:09	AdmiralBumbleBee	maybe the audio really IS off to the left extra
2016-10-07 14:18:14	krk_	dont scare me
2016-10-07 14:18:17	krk_	:D

2016-10-07 14:18:50	krk_	maybe it has something to do with it
2016-10-07 14:19:38	AdmiralBumbleBee	that definitely fits in the 'maybe your room is shit' category
2016-10-07 14:20:08	krk_	i know

2016-10-07 14:22:12	krk_	they can go up to +6db
2016-10-07 14:22:18	AdmiralBumbleBee	turn them up till they're too noisy
2016-10-07 14:22:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	then crank it back a bit
2016-10-07 14:22:51	krk_	how noisy you mean? since i have that hiss/noise
2016-10-07 14:22:54	krk_	noisy like distorted?

2016-10-07 14:23:15	AdmiralBumbleBee	turn them up till the noise is too much, or the character of it changes audibly
2016-10-07 14:23:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	then turn it down a bit from there
2016-10-07 14:23:54	krk_	ok
2016-10-07 14:24:13	krk_	does the loudness have impact on the lifetime of the speaker?

2016-10-08 03:17:55	krk_	[00:20:08] i know [00:20:08]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	krk_	[00:21:41] one more question [00:21:41]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	krk_	[00:21:52] how allowed am i to turn the speakers? [00:21:52]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	krk_	[00:22:02] currently they are set at -30db on the back [00:22:02]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	krk_	[00:22:12] they can go up to +6db [00:22:12]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	[00:22:18] turn them up till they're too noisy [00:22:18]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	[00:22:22] then crank it back a bit [00:22:22]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	krk_	[00:22:51] how noisy you mean? since i have that hiss/noise [00:22:51]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	krk_	[00:22:54] noisy like distorted? [00:22:54]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	[00:22:59] noisy. [00:22:59]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	[00:23:15] turn them up till the noise is too much, or the character of it changes audibly [00:23:15]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	[00:23:19] then turn it down a bit from there [00:23:19]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	krk_	[00:23:54] ok [00:23:54]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	krk_	[00:24:13] does the loudness have impact on the lifetime of the speaker? [00:24:13]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	[00:24:24] if you're within spec, no [00:24:24]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	[00:24:29] if you're blasting them, yes [00:24:29]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	krk_	[00:24:29] i am really noob at hardware sorry [00:24:29]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	krk_	[00:25:23] ok [00:25:23]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	krk_	[00:25:45] also should i turn off the monitors when i am not working? [00:25:45]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	[00:25:57] maybe [00:25:57]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	krk_	[00:26:00] i am mostly on the pc, but just in case when i am not working [00:26:00]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	[00:26:05] people do both [00:26:05]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	[00:26:08] on and turn off [00:26:08]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	[00:26:22] either side could convince you that they're right [00:26:22]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	krk_	[00:26:44] why are they doing it? [00:26:44]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	krk_	[00:26:57] does it have something with the lifetime of the speaker? [00:26:57]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	[00:27:08] leave them on to reduce switch wear, capacitor wear, choke wear... [00:27:08]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	[00:27:29] turn them off to save money and avoid potential issues with damaging intermittent sound [00:27:29]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	[00:27:42] both reasonings are really minimally impactful [00:27:42]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	embri0n	[00:27:54] i wish i had monitors to test [00:27:54]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	krk_	[00:34:08] @AdmiralBumbleBee is it true that if i dont turn off the monitors when changing the minijack i can break the monitors? [00:34:08]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	[00:34:25] krk_: unlikely, but slight possibility [00:34:25]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	krk_	[00:35:07] because of the loud noise it makes [00:35:07]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	krk_	[00:35:23] when pluging it in the pc it doesnt make noise, on the phone it did noise [00:35:23]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	embri0n	[00:50:28] krk_ is super excited... i would be too if i had new monitors [00:50:28]

2016-10-08 03:17:55	krk_	[00:52:04] only without that noise [00:52:04]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	krk_	[00:52:20] what monitors do you have? [00:52:20]

2016-10-08 05:14:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	krk_: it's just poor sheilding
2016-10-08 05:14:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	on the audio device in your computer
2016-10-08 05:14:57	krk_	but what does it have to do with a website?
2016-10-08 05:15:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's going to depend on the current gpu use and USB use
2016-10-08 05:15:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	it can also be influenced by NICs as well, but usually only older ones
2016-10-08 05:15:53	krk_	is audio interface still the only solution?
2016-10-08 05:16:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	or a much better motherboard
2016-10-08 05:16:07	Ycros	your computer is a complex network of electricity, sometimes certain things will generate noise that will interfere with your audio output
2016-10-08 05:16:09	AdmiralBumbleBee	audio interface is the ideal solution for you
2016-10-08 05:16:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	krk_: what Ycros said, except it only occurs due to low quality parts... there are onboard audio devices that are well sheilded which won't exhibit such noise
2016-10-08 05:16:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	however... it's pretty normal.
2016-10-08 05:17:30	krk_	i still cannot understand why on certain website when scrolling (using the moouse wheel constantly) there is no noise
2016-10-08 05:17:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	krk_: gpu involvement normally.
2016-10-08 05:18:29	Ycros	it's probably when certain circuits/chips clock to certain frequencies that you're hearing it as noise

2016-10-08 07:09:59	bongofury	and video processing was something you batched when you went to bed

2016-10-08 07:11:15	AdmiralBumbleBee	or whatever it was called

2016-10-08 07:12:37	AdmiralBumbleBee	there was this really god mac deinterlacing program

2016-10-08 07:18:56	kerrang	when are you supposed to flip the phase of a track? I feel like i'm misusing it right now
2016-10-08 07:18:56		[07:18]
2016-10-08 07:19:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: polarity*
2016-10-08 07:19:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: and when it is causing phase cancellation with similar spectral content
2016-10-08 07:19:40	AdmiralBumbleBee	such as a multi-miked track
2016-10-08 07:19:48	kerrang	got a distored break and trying to layer dry drum hits on top (each with polarity flipped) but when i try shifting the position of my snare i get phasing
2016-10-08 07:20:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	you're putting different drums on top?
2016-10-08 07:20:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	or the same drum
2016-10-08 07:20:24	kerrang	AdmiralBumbleBee: same drum, but no bus distortion
2016-10-08 07:20:28	AdmiralBumbleBee	either way, it doesn't really matter... no reason to invert polarity
2016-10-08 07:20:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: unless your plugin is flipping the polarity, or changing the phase... no reason to do that
2016-10-08 07:20:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	or I guess unless it's delaying the signal, in which case it may help
2016-10-08 07:21:24	kerrang	i do need to flip polarity to adjust for phasing, but offsetting midi brings it back

2016-10-08 12:56:21	kerrang	damn this floor trim is kinda annoying to rip out
2016-10-08 12:58:30	kerrang	or tedious i should say
2016-10-08 12:59:38	MSHMTX	AdmiralBumbleBee, something tells me it could be sounding better should i get into the TotalMix ?

2016-10-08 13:00:00	MSHMTX	is too loud
2016-10-08 13:00:08	MSHMTX	because its clipping according to the totalmix

2016-10-08 13:08:33	Questionable	Hey there, can someone perhaps shed some light on how the FX in this stem were made? To be specific, the weird bird sort of FM stuff, the granular noise at 0:04 and the ratting that comes in at 0:28. https://clyp.it/wjkpxu0q

2016-10-08 13:14:00		[13:08]
2016-10-08 13:23:11	tehsma	sounds like at least two layers, one is very close to white noise, with an LFO modulating volume, which increases in rate over time
2016-10-08 13:23:31	tehsma	(then decreases in rate)
2016-10-08 13:23:40	tehsma	the other close to a sine wave, with pitch being modulated by a similar LFO, similarly increasing in rate (and then decreasing
2016-10-08 13:24:11	tehsma	there is also an envelope modulating the sine-y layer, specifically- modulating pitch
2016-10-08 13:25:48	tehsma	there also may be a highpass filter on the white noise, with an envelope modulating the filter cutoff similar shape as the other envelope, this sort of thing long attack /\ long decay
2016-10-08 13:26:28	Questionable	Thanks, lemme just try that a see what I get, haha.
2016-10-08 13:27:41	tehsma	i think the weird panning, reverbed sound at 28 may be that 'click' you hear at :35
2016-10-08 13:28:09	tehsma	they are just using some crazzy ass delay effect, like the sort of thing you can do in logic's dekay designer
2016-10-08 13:28:22	tehsma	where you can control the pitch, panning, filter, etc of all the delay impulses
2016-10-08 13:28:34	tehsma	delay designer*
2016-10-08 13:29:42	Questionable	Well, the bird stuff really is just a sine. :P
2016-10-08 13:29:42		[13:29]
2016-10-08 13:31:45	tehsma	nice
2016-10-08 13:35:07	Questionable	I'm sort of getting the noise, just need to fiddle around with it a bit more.
2016-10-08 13:35:26	Questionable	I have a feeling it's not any of the noise options in Massive just 'cause none of them sound like it.
2016-10-08 13:36:07	bongofury	birds++
2016-10-08 13:37:13	bongofury	yeah this can be done with sine and 2 harmonics

2016-10-08 13:37:42	bongofury	this sond is accomplished by having a rate tied to the length of sweep

2016-10-08 13:37:46	bongofury	*sound
2016-10-08 13:37:52	Questionable	I think the rattling might just be easier to make by finding a similar sample and just running it through a bunch of reverb, lol.
2016-10-08 13:38:22	bongofury	also, the sweep shape over time, after each sample, is exponential
2016-10-08 13:38:59	bongofury	so its quiet for attack length then goes steeply up in ampmod
2016-10-08 13:39:38	bongofury	so that sound is a sine with very few harmonics which has a synced frequency, volume and release.
2016-10-08 13:39:45	bongofury	that would be the analysis I guess.
2016-10-08 13:39:47	bongofury	anyone else?

2016-10-08 13:50:14	bongofury	is that what you have?
2016-10-08 13:50:26	bongofury	ok so the interior wall isnt equipped to handle the volume
2016-10-08 13:50:27	tehsma	trapping mouisture because the outer layer of brick or whatnot has lost its integrity
2016-10-08 13:50:31	bongofury	and the roof is leaking into it

2016-10-08 13:51:04	tehsma	at least to me
2016-10-08 13:51:18	tehsma	still i do know that we have a double wall on the other side of hte building, or cavity wall as you say
2016-10-08 13:51:18	bongofury	thats not your job
2016-10-08 13:51:23	tehsma	and that fucker is all sorts of compromised

2016-10-08 14:26:45	bongofury	its an eq with a gain possible greater than 1

2016-10-08 14:42:22	bongofury	when it moves, over time.
2016-10-08 14:42:36	bongofury	like when node 5 goes left, then down, then turns off

2016-10-08 14:43:05	bongofury	hope that helps

2016-10-08 17:40:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: you can do almost anything with it you can do in the actual app
2016-10-08 17:44:10	kerrang	AdmiralBumbleBee: ah so it's just more tightly/better integrated compared to other daw remote apps
2016-10-08 17:44:20	kerrang	or other remote apps in general for music purposes
2016-10-08 17:44:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	yep
2016-10-08 17:45:05	AdmiralBumbleBee	it basically has the full mixer integrated, all shortcuts, all menu items
2016-10-08 17:45:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	sequence overview
2016-10-08 17:45:40	AdmiralBumbleBee	and the connection is very simple
2016-10-08 17:45:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	there's no setting up controllers, messing with some local app
2016-10-08 17:45:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	you just open the app on your tablet or whatever... it finds your computer
2016-10-08 17:46:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	done
2016-10-08 17:46:05	AdmiralBumbleBee	nothing else
2016-10-08 17:46:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	and it handles the remote or local application closing very gracefully
2016-10-08 17:46:30	AdmiralBumbleBee	and sleep
2016-10-08 17:46:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	the damn thing just works
2016-10-08 17:47:11	kerrang	that sounds nice, i just dont see myself using it
2016-10-08 17:47:36	kerrang	i'd guess it be useful for recording sessions if you're both the mixier and person prepping
2016-10-08 17:47:44	kerrang	aka you

2016-10-09 03:53:55	Nahck	its not an offset but the position in the series of wavetables

2016-10-09 03:54:43	fqtw	i thought its just one sample that is used as a wavetable

2016-10-09 03:55:08	Nahck	might be but i dont think so

2016-10-09 04:16:07	adq	everything seems explained:
2016-10-09 04:16:07	adq	Technically speaking, when Serum loads a wavetable it is using 2048
2016-10-09 04:16:08	adq	samples for a sub-table of the wavetable set. This means the
2016-10-09 04:16:08	adq	maximum file size would be 2048(samples) x 256(sub-tables) x 32(bits)
2016-10-09 04:16:08	adq	(which is exactly 2 megabytes).
2016-10-09 04:16:12	adq	etc... just R T F M
2016-10-09 04:16:25	fqtw	yeah i got that
2016-10-09 04:16:44	fqtw	but does it normalize all the onecycle tables to a common pitch?
2016-10-09 04:16:57	Nahck	it doesnt need to
2016-10-09 04:17:00	fqtw	or only all of them by the first cycle's fundamental pitch?
2016-10-09 04:17:14	Nahck	its a one cycle and of the same lenght
2016-10-09 04:17:30	Nahck	so its automatically same pitch
2016-10-09 04:17:39	fqtw	but what if u drop in a pitch sweep sample?
2016-10-09 04:18:02	Nahck	itll sound like osc sync
2016-10-09 04:18:29	fqtw	will it stretch all wavetables to the same length?
2016-10-09 04:18:46	fqtw	and to the same pitch
2016-10-09 04:18:48	Nahck	probably not
2016-10-09 04:19:00	Nahck	it will cut it
2016-10-09 04:19:08	Nahck	would be my guess
2016-10-09 04:19:18	fqtw	so it will normalize all by the first cycle's fundamental pitch?
2016-10-09 04:19:36	fqtw	use that as a reference pitch?
2016-10-09 04:19:36		[04:19]
2016-10-09 04:21:03	Nahck	i would guess u put one cycle there
2016-10-09 04:21:27	Nahck	and then theres some clever algorithm that does the rest
2016-10-09 04:21:52	Nahck	or maybe it detects all the cycles itself just guessing
2016-10-09 04:21:55	Nahck	rtfm

2016-10-09 04:54:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	raz: you should put some thought in to using decent software
2016-10-09 04:54:35	raz	like what?
2016-10-09 04:54:49	raz	i've been trying some other daws.. but didn't really get into them
2016-10-09 04:55:27	raz	ableton seems to have a lot of stuff right..  the routing etc. felt awkward in the other daws that i tried so far
2016-10-09 04:56:07	 *	raz plans on retrying a few daws when the new macbook with moar diskspace arrives
2016-10-09 04:56:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	what have you tried
2016-10-09 04:57:34	raz	bitwig.. logic (but only for very short)..
2016-10-09 04:57:44	raz	i think cubase but that was ages ago
2016-10-09 04:58:19	raz	bitwig seemed promising but the non-zoomable fly-squat interface killed it for me
2016-10-09 04:58:33	raz	in logic the UI felt clumsy, like working with gloves
2016-10-09 04:58:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	logic is pretty amazing...
2016-10-09 04:58:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	but it frustrates me everytime I use it
2016-10-09 04:59:12	raz	i dunno... i really liked the way they've done that instrument stuff
2016-10-09 04:59:25	raz	with a common UI for almost everything (or maybe that was just the builtins, i didn't get super far)
2016-10-09 04:59:36	raz	also that sampler-thing they ship... so tempting
2016-10-09 04:59:50	raz	but all the other parts...  i just didn't warm up with it
2016-10-09 05:00:51	raz	i think the main reason i stopped evaluating it was because i knew i'd switch back to ableton and getting used to a piano roll that isn't complete garbage would only make me depressed then..
2016-10-09 05:01:17	raz	i can't believe ableton doesn't even try to fix that fucking thing
2016-10-09 05:01:25	 *	raz insta-rage
2016-10-09 05:01:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	for what you complain about
2016-10-09 05:01:40	AdmiralBumbleBee	seems like almost anything would be better
2016-10-09 05:02:04	raz	yea.. but what good is an awesome piano roll when everything else is shit...
2016-10-09 05:02:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	definitely don't think that's the case
2016-10-09 05:02:52	raz	so which daw would you recommend?
2016-10-09 05:03:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'm not recommending anything actually
2016-10-09 05:03:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'm just curious why you don't switch when you seem to dislike live so much
2016-10-09 05:04:15	raz	love/hate...  as said... if i had a feeling the alternatives wouldn't be even more annoying.. i'd go there..

2016-10-09 07:35:46	kerrang	intro and outro do not work
2016-10-09 07:36:02	JavaTheHutt	noted
2016-10-09 07:37:02	raz	mid part also doesn't work
2016-10-09 07:37:04	raz	but the mix is good
2016-10-09 07:37:37	kerrang	i was going to say the mix was bad because all the mid sounds are either drowned out by the percussion or gets too loud towards the end
2016-10-09 07:37:52	JavaTheHutt	i don't know a damn about mixing tbh
2016-10-09 07:37:53	raz	hmm interesting
2016-10-09 07:38:10	raz	well i hate this type of kick anyway
2016-10-09 07:38:10	JavaTheHutt	i just change the instruments if i feel they are too loud
2016-10-09 07:38:17	JavaTheHutt	fruity kick>
2016-10-09 07:38:19	kerrang	and you use the same kick and hat pattern for the entire track without any variation, and any movement that's supposed to be created by other elements don't work because of the mix
2016-10-09 07:38:38	raz	but yea now that you say it.. it's true, the instruments/bass are too quiet..
2016-10-09 07:38:50	JavaTheHutt	no bass, just the kick
2016-10-09 07:38:51	raz	i guess i thought it's meant to be that way, filed them as background ambient with the beat being the main thing
2016-10-09 07:38:59	kerrang	raz: i can't hear the bass cause of my speakers, but i couldn't hear anything else
2016-10-09 07:39:14	JavaTheHutt	yeah, there isnt any bass, (which i should probably add)
2016-10-09 07:39:16	raz	yea well...  i think the whole thing can be scrapped ;)
2016-10-09 07:39:25	raz	i do somewhat like the intro noise thing
2016-10-09 07:39:58	raz	or maybe try keeping the midi but replacing almost all sounds
2016-10-09 07:39:58		[07:39]
2016-10-09 07:40:00	raz	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-10-09 07:40:26	raz	or maybe other people like how it is now..  that's all just my opinion

2016-10-09 07:40:59	JavaTheHutt	hmm well i might just scrap it, as it doesnt fit the pseudo-ambient aesthetic im trying to create

2016-10-09 07:42:51	JavaTheHutt	and we were talking about filter sweeps
2016-10-09 07:44:22	kerrang	man this is so quiet
2016-10-09 07:45:42	kerrang	suffers from the usual challenge in ambient, not enough going on to keep it interesting
2016-10-09 07:46:33	JavaTheHutt	(not trying to be an aphex twin fanboy) but i took a little inspiration from Selected Ambient Works pt. II
2016-10-09 07:46:37	kerrang	violin is too loud
2016-10-09 07:47:18	kerrang	but not by that much, just stands out
2016-10-09 07:47:26	JavaTheHutt	alright
2016-10-09 07:48:03	kerrang	i get the idea, but again these are just samples/loops on repeat most of the time
2016-10-09 07:48:46	JavaTheHutt	so just make it more, interesting
2016-10-09 07:49:16	kerrang	JavaTheHutt: you have a start here, but now it's a matter of figuring out how to keep the listener from not being bored

2016-10-09 07:49:52	kerrang	automation (like filter sweeps as mentioned) maybe different melodies or alter loop lengths so elements don't come in at the same time repeatedly
2016-10-09 07:50:33	kerrang	depends on where you want to go with it, and how much attention you want to grab from the listener (how 'ambient' you really want to be)

2016-10-09 11:56:39	kerrang	ah, i didn't think that floor trim was suppose to cover the space between the floor and wall
2016-10-09 11:56:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	wall spacing is 1/2" moulding depth
2016-10-09 11:57:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	subfloor is irrelevant 98% of the time
2016-10-09 11:57:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	you just need moisture barrier + padding (if it's not already glued on to the laminate)
2016-10-09 11:57:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	unless you have a concrete subfloor, then you may need to level it

2016-10-09 12:07:43	kerrang	it's weird to me that some popular flooring installation videos show installing planks against the floor trim (not going to do that)
2016-10-09 12:08:11	kerrang	but i got the idea now, straight forward so long i plan my cuts a bit
2016-10-09 12:08:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: there are some instances where removing moulding and/or trim isn't possible
2016-10-09 12:09:05	AdmiralBumbleBee	historical, unmatchable paint/finish, integrated moulding etc..
2016-10-09 12:09:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	so you have no other choice
2016-10-09 12:09:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	and then there are some instances where how-to hosts are morons.
2016-10-09 12:09:37	kerrang	heh i'm assuming the latter
2016-10-09 12:10:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: you also may be missing the trim step
2016-10-09 12:10:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	and maybe you don't know the difference between moulding, baseboards and trim...
2016-10-09 12:10:28	AdmiralBumbleBee	possibly because some people erroneously use those terms interchangeably

2016-10-10 10:01:32	Questionable	Yeah, SynthHacker has some really nice tutorials, but sadly I can't really find anything that sounds like what I'm trying to recreate.
2016-10-10 10:01:55	Questionable	He's got some pitched leads so I guess that's a starting point.

2016-10-10 15:15:43	kerrang	i'll probably buy it at some point, either second-hand or on sale
2016-10-10 15:15:43	embri0n	i rarely had ableton crash on me, since i've been using Serum it goes down everytime the wind changes

2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:05:20] a theme has all font-sizing specified in px [18:05:20]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:05:31] is there an easy way to globally increase/decrease these? [18:05:31]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	[18:05:57] _Hex_: regex [18:05:57]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:06:33] search/replace? [18:06:33]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	kerrang	[18:06:58] if it's all set using px, then yeah. search and replace is your only option [18:06:58]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	[18:07:04] _Hex_: yep [18:07:04]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:07:30] okay..i was hoping there would be an easier way as they want this user-editable [18:07:30]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	[18:07:33] _Hex_: regex and capture value between font-size: and px, then increment [18:07:33]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	[18:07:39] not too hard to write [18:07:39]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	[18:07:41] easy to do in perl [18:07:41]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:08:07] if it was done in EM i could just change the base font size [18:08:07]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:08:07] and be done with it [18:08:07]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	kerrang	[18:08:08] _Hex_: do you mean they want the font-size to scale with browser settings? [18:08:08]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	kerrang	[18:08:19] yeah, i was referring to em's [18:08:19]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:08:35] kerrang: not to do with browser settings..it's a shopify theme and they want the admin to be able to set a base font size [18:08:35]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:08:41] but because everything is in PX [18:08:41]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:08:43] i guess they're fucked [18:08:43]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	kerrang	[18:08:46] yup [18:08:46]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:08:49] unless i switch everything over to EM [18:08:49]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:08:55] and then set a base font size [18:08:55]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	kerrang	[18:09:24] only way to do that would be with ems/rems and set the base font-size using an inline style attribue added via javascript [18:09:24]

2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:10:34] well..with em [18:10:34]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:10:38] can't you just set your base font size [18:10:38]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:10:46] and it'll scale depending? [18:10:46]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	[18:10:49] _Hex_: you can always just manually increment the values using basic dom with js [18:10:49]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	[18:11:30] vanillaJS™ no less [18:11:30]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	[18:11:50] just toss on a class for 'incrementablefont' [18:11:50]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:11:54] nah..i think this is fucked [18:11:54]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:11:58] or at least [18:11:58]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:12:06] i can just push back and say "nope..not gonna happen" [18:12:06]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	[18:12:09] Document.getElementsByClassName(), iterate, increment [18:12:09]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	[18:12:19] like 6 loc [18:12:19]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	kerrang	[18:13:16] _Hex_: yes, but i'm saying if you want it to be a theme config you need to override it some how. the stylesheet isn't configurable through an admin interface [18:13:16]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	kerrang	[18:13:31] if you just want to do it in code, then a base font-size with ems is all you need [18:13:31]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	kerrang	[18:13:42] err, code == CSS [18:13:42]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:13:59] it's in shopify and yeah..you can completely manipulate the CSS via an admin interface [18:13:59]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	kerrang	[18:14:22] nvm then [18:14:22]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:14:23] so i'd just split out base font size to an admin editable value [18:14:23]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:14:29] and it'd compile on run [18:14:29]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:14:31] easy peasy [18:14:31]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	kerrang	[18:14:49] neato [18:14:49]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:16:34] i hate web [18:16:34]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	_Hex_	[18:16:50] i should farm this shit out to someone else [18:16:50]
2016-10-12 14:44:19	kerrang	[18:17:46] yes but then they'd probably screw it up more [18:17:46]

2016-10-12 16:07:13	kerrang	[18:06:58] if it's all set using px, then yeah. search and replace is your only option [18:06:58]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	[18:07:04] _Hex_: yep [18:07:04]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	_Hex_	[18:07:30] okay..i was hoping there would be an easier way as they want this user-editable [18:07:30]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	[18:07:33] _Hex_: regex and capture value between font-size: and px, then increment [18:07:33]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	[18:07:39] not too hard to write [18:07:39]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	[18:07:41] easy to do in perl [18:07:41]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	_Hex_	[18:08:07] if it was done in EM i could just change the base font size [18:08:07]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	_Hex_	[18:08:07] and be done with it [18:08:07]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	kerrang	[18:08:08] _Hex_: do you mean they want the font-size to scale with browser settings? [18:08:08]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	kerrang	[18:08:19] yeah, i was referring to em's [18:08:19]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	_Hex_	[18:08:35] kerrang: not to do with browser settings..it's a shopify theme and they want the admin to be able to set a base font size [18:08:35]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	_Hex_	[18:08:41] but because everything is in PX [18:08:41]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	_Hex_	[18:08:43] i guess they're fucked [18:08:43]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	kerrang	[18:08:46] yup [18:08:46]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	_Hex_	[18:08:49] unless i switch everything over to EM [18:08:49]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	_Hex_	[18:08:55] and then set a base font size [18:08:55]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	kerrang	[18:09:24] only way to do that would be with ems/rems and set the base font-size using an inline style attribue added via javascript [18:09:24]

2016-10-12 16:07:13	_Hex_	[18:10:34] well..with em [18:10:34]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	_Hex_	[18:10:38] can't you just set your base font size [18:10:38]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	_Hex_	[18:10:46] and it'll scale depending? [18:10:46]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	[18:10:49] _Hex_: you can always just manually increment the values using basic dom with js [18:10:49]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	[18:11:30] vanillaJS™ no less [18:11:30]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	[18:11:50] just toss on a class for 'incrementablefont' [18:11:50]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	_Hex_	[18:11:54] nah..i think this is fucked [18:11:54]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	_Hex_	[18:11:58] or at least [18:11:58]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	_Hex_	[18:12:06] i can just push back and say "nope..not gonna happen" [18:12:06]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	[18:12:09] Document.getElementsByClassName(), iterate, increment [18:12:09]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	[18:12:19] like 6 loc [18:12:19]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	kerrang	[18:13:16] _Hex_: yes, but i'm saying if you want it to be a theme config you need to override it some how. the stylesheet isn't configurable through an admin interface [18:13:16]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	kerrang	[18:13:31] if you just want to do it in code, then a base font-size with ems is all you need [18:13:31]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	kerrang	[18:13:42] err, code == CSS [18:13:42]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	_Hex_	[18:13:59] it's in shopify and yeah..you can completely manipulate the CSS via an admin interface [18:13:59]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	kerrang	[18:14:22] nvm then [18:14:22]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	_Hex_	[18:14:23] so i'd just split out base font size to an admin editable value [18:14:23]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	_Hex_	[18:14:29] and it'd compile on run [18:14:29]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	_Hex_	[18:14:31] easy peasy [18:14:31]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	kerrang	[18:14:49] neato [18:14:49]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	_Hex_	[18:16:34] i hate web [18:16:34]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	_Hex_	[18:16:50] i should farm this shit out to someone else [18:16:50]
2016-10-12 16:07:13	kerrang	[18:17:46] yes but then they'd probably screw it up more [18:17:46]

2016-10-12 19:40:08	_Hex_	and does it need all 3
2016-10-12 19:40:18	_Hex_	or does it mean it has to disengage if one of those occurs but it doesn't need all 3
2016-10-12 19:45:09	Ycros	I would interpret that as any one of those
2016-10-12 19:45:09		[19:45]
2016-10-12 19:46:13	Ycros	if it was all then they wouldn't use "or"

2016-10-12 20:29:58	_Hex_	Ycros: okay..so does that mean it needs to have the functionality of all 3?
2016-10-12 20:30:02	_Hex_	and if any one of those occurs
2016-10-12 20:30:08	_Hex_	or does it mean that it only needs to have 1 of those features
2016-10-12 20:31:17	Ycros	the first one. Functionality of all 3, if any occurs.
2016-10-12 20:31:42	_Hex_	okay..that's not how i interpreted it
2016-10-12 20:31:49	Ycros	wat
2016-10-12 20:32:07	_Hex_	well..if I have feature A, feature B, feature C
2016-10-12 20:32:09	_Hex_	using boolean logic
2016-10-12 20:32:26	_Hex_	if A or B or C then that produces a true statement
2016-10-12 20:32:27	Ycros	it's not boolean logic, it's common sense. Unless there's further context you didn't share.
2016-10-12 20:32:37	_Hex_	well..no..hold on
2016-10-12 20:32:45	_Hex_	it can be interpreted different ways
2016-10-12 20:32:47	_Hex_	hence my question
2016-10-12 20:33:11	_Hex_	i don't know how this is interpreted legally
2016-10-12 20:33:22	_Hex_	logic would say you apply boolean logic to it
2016-10-12 20:33:35	Ycros	I'm not sure I agree with that, there's only one obvious interpretation to me. Again, if it's a legal document, consult a lawyer.
2016-10-12 20:33:46	_Hex_	so..to clarify
2016-10-12 20:33:54	_Hex_	you say it needs to have feature A/B/C
2016-10-12 20:33:59	_Hex_	?
2016-10-12 20:35:19	Ycros	the whole thing is a feature, you disengage if this condition happens, or if this condition happens, or if this condition happens. It's one feature, with 3 conditions upon which it's triggered.
2016-10-12 20:35:50	_Hex_	right
2016-10-12 20:36:02	_Hex_	but what if feature does not have certain conditions available?
2016-10-12 20:36:20	_Hex_	does that render it invalid?
2016-10-12 20:36:36	Ycros	you mean, if it doesn't have brakes, or an accelerator?
2016-10-12 20:36:40	_Hex_	correct
2016-10-12 20:36:42	Ycros	that's additional context you didn't share
2016-10-12 20:36:50	_Hex_	well..no..there's no context here
2016-10-12 20:36:57	Ycros	well, there is
2016-10-12 20:36:57	_Hex_	it's simply interpreting that
2016-10-12 20:37:04	_Hex_	if you want the full context
2016-10-12 20:37:09	_Hex_	it's related to an electric scooter
2016-10-12 20:37:14	_Hex_	and what it's classed as
2016-10-12 20:37:43	_Hex_	and those electric scooters while having pedals do not meet the conditions outlaid above
2016-10-12 20:37:46	Ycros	if some of these things are optional features, then I'd interpret it the other way
2016-10-12 20:38:06	Ycros	except
2016-10-12 20:38:07	Ycros	well, no
2016-10-12 20:38:09	Ycros	it doesn't matter
2016-10-12 20:38:13	_Hex_	anyway..it sounds like you're guessing like everyone else is
2016-10-12 20:38:17	Ycros	if it doesn't have breaks then that condition won't ever be hit
2016-10-12 20:38:24	Ycros	so the interpretation actually remains the same
2016-10-12 20:38:38	_Hex_	that would have been my interpretation
2016-10-12 20:38:48	_Hex_	i.e. A or B or C produces a true statement
2016-10-12 20:39:04	Ycros	yep. But one of those might never be hit. And that's fine.
2016-10-12 20:39:09	_Hex_	if any of those are true then the statement is true
2016-10-12 20:39:19	_Hex_	but if all are false then the statement is false
2016-10-12 20:39:28	Ycros	one might never be true because it can't be
2016-10-12 20:39:43	_Hex_	but it doesn't matter if any of the others are true
2016-10-12 20:39:47	_Hex_	because the statement will be true
2016-10-12 20:39:53	_Hex_	you follow my logic now?
2016-10-12 20:40:33	Ycros	wat
2016-10-12 20:40:37	_Hex_	*sigh*
2016-10-12 20:40:58	_Hex_	if you don't have a certain feature
2016-10-12 20:41:01	_Hex_	then it can never be true
2016-10-12 20:41:07	Ycros	yes
2016-10-12 20:41:19	_Hex_	but if one of the other variables are true
2016-10-12 20:41:24	_Hex_	then the result will = true
2016-10-12 20:41:28	Ycros	what's wrong with that?
2016-10-12 20:41:31	_Hex_	i.e. a = true, b= false, c= false
2016-10-12 20:41:32	Ycros	yep
2016-10-12 20:41:34	_Hex_	then the statement = true
2016-10-12 20:41:43	Ycros	yes
2016-10-12 20:41:44	_Hex_	the only way it could be false is if a/b/c are false

2016-10-12 20:43:14	_Hex_	you said a/b/c = true for the statement to = true

2016-10-12 20:44:13	_Hex_	those are two very different interpretations
2016-10-12 20:44:28	Ycros	like, if it had A AND B as conditions that could happen (because their dependents are implemented), I'd say it would still need to comply with A OR B triggering. Just triggering off "A" and never triggering off "B" would be incorrect
2016-10-12 20:44:59	_Hex_	well..AND was never mentioned
2016-10-12 20:45:07	_Hex_	that's a different set of logic
2016-10-12 20:45:16	_Hex_	but you can see how this can be interpreted multiple ways now?

2016-10-12 20:45:39	_Hex_	hmm
2016-10-12 20:45:48	Ycros	I can see how you might have mistakenly interpreted some other way, but I still maintain there's one obvious interpretation

2016-10-12 20:46:02	Ycros	it's not conflicting, but maybe I'm not stating it in a way that you're understanding

2016-10-12 20:47:43	Ycros	ie. if a scooter has just brakes, then only the brakes condition is relevant to the whole statement. If a scooter has brakes AND an accelerator, then both the braken and the accelerator condition are releavent to the statement. In that laterr case, either one could trigger it. But only implementing a trigger on the brakes if it has an accelerator would be invalid.
2016-10-12 20:48:36	Ycros	but the condition can't trigger if the accelerator doesn't exist, so it's an impossibility for it to go true
2016-10-12 20:48:55	_Hex_	the argument here is does it need to have all 3 conditions
2016-10-12 20:49:18	_Hex_	do you interpret that as it does to satisfy that statement?
2016-10-12 20:49:20	Ycros	well, yes. But some might always be false (ie. missing brakes or an accelerator)
2016-10-12 20:49:35	_Hex_	so..going back to this
2016-10-12 20:49:40	_Hex_	and looking at it logically
2016-10-12 20:49:43	Ycros	which is how I interpreted it at the start, but maybe poorly explained
2016-10-12 20:49:50	_Hex_	the statement to be true
2016-10-12 20:49:54	_Hex_	must have A/B/C
2016-10-12 20:50:05	_Hex_	and ONE or MORE of those must be true
2016-10-12 20:50:10	_Hex_	for the statement to be true?
2016-10-12 20:50:58	Ycros	I'm not sure I can explain it more thoroughly than I just did
2016-10-12 20:51:17	_Hex_	heh..okay..thanks for trying
2016-10-12 20:51:26	_Hex_	i'm interested to get a legal opinion on this
2016-10-12 20:51:52	Ycros	it's possible that they should have added "if fitted". Or there's other language elsewhere that clarifies that.

But only implementing a trigger on the brakes if it has an accelerator would be invalid. [06:47:43]
2016-10-12 21:28:15	Ycros	[06:48:36] but the condition can't trigger if the accelerator doesn't exist, so it's an impossibility for it to go true [06:48:36]
2016-10-12 21:28:15	_Hex_	[06:48:55] the argument here is does it need to have all 3 conditions [06:48:55]
2016-10-12 21:28:15	_Hex_	[06:49:18] do you interpret that as it does to satisfy that statement? [06:49:18]
2016-10-12 21:28:15	Ycros	[06:49:20] well, yes. But some might always be false (ie. missing brakes or an accelerator) [06:49:20]
2016-10-12 21:28:15	_Hex_	[06:49:35] so..going back to this [06:49:35]
2016-10-12 21:28:15	_Hex_	[06:49:40] and looking at it logically [06:49:40]
2016-10-12 21:28:15	Ycros	[06:49:43] which is how I interpreted it at the start, but maybe poorly explained [06:49:43]
2016-10-12 21:28:15	_Hex_	[06:49:50] the statement to be true [06:49:50]
2016-10-12 21:28:15	_Hex_	[06:49:54] must have A/B/C [06:49:54]
2016-10-12 21:28:15	_Hex_	[06:50:05] and ONE or MORE of those must be true [06:50:05]
2016-10-12 21:28:15	_Hex_	[06:50:10] for the statement to be true? [06:50:10]
2016-10-12 21:28:15	Ycros	[06:50:58] I'm not sure I can explain it more thoroughly than I just did [06:50:58]
2016-10-12 21:28:15	_Hex_	[06:51:17] heh..okay..thanks for trying [06:51:17]
2016-10-12 21:28:15	_Hex_	[06:51:26] i'm interested to get a legal opinion on this [06:51:26]
2016-10-12 21:28:15	Ycros	[06:51:52] it's possible that they should have added "if fitted". Or there's other language elsewhere that clarifies that. [06:51:52]

2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:41:19] but if one of the other variables are true [06:41:19]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:41:24] then the result will = true [06:41:24]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	Ycros	[06:41:28] what's wrong with that? [06:41:28]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:41:31] i.e. a = true, b= false, c= false [06:41:31]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	Ycros	[06:41:32] yep [06:41:32]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:41:34] then the statement = true [06:41:34]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	Ycros	[06:41:43] yes [06:41:43]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:41:44] the only way it could be false is if a/b/c are false [06:41:44]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	Ycros	[06:41:50] indeed [06:41:50]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:41:51] which is NOT what you originally interpreted it as [06:41:51]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	Ycros	[06:41:55] yes it is [06:41:55]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:41:58] no it's not [06:41:58]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:42:25] <_Hex_> Ycros: okay..so does that mean it needs to have the functionality of all 3? [06:42:25]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:42:25] <_Hex_> and if any one of those occurs [06:42:25]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:42:25] <_Hex_> or does it mean that it only needs to have 1 of those features [06:42:25]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:42:25] <Ycros> the first one. Functionality of all 3, if any occurs. [06:42:25]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	Ycros	[06:42:34] yep [06:42:34]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:42:39] ?!?!?!? [06:42:39]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	Ycros	[06:43:02] some conditions will never trigger because they can't, that doesn't invalidate my interpretation [06:43:02]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:43:02] let me rephrase then [06:43:02]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:43:14] you said a/b/c = true for the statement to = true [06:43:14]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:43:28] i.e. it NEEDS to have the functionality of all 3 [06:43:28]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:43:53] but now you say only 1 of A/B/C needs to be true for the statement to be true [06:43:53]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:44:13] those are two very different interpretations [06:44:13]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	Ycros	[06:44:28] like, if it had A AND B as conditions that could happen (because their dependents are implemented), I'd say it would still need to comply with A OR B triggering. Just triggering off "A" and never triggering off "B" would be incorrect [06:44:28]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:44:59] well..AND was never mentioned [06:44:59]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:45:07] that's a different set of logic [06:45:07]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:45:16] but you can see how this can be interpreted multiple ways now? [06:45:16]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	Ycros	[06:45:18] no, read what I'm saying [06:45:18]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:45:39] hmm [06:45:39]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	Ycros	[06:45:48] I can see how you might have mistakenly interpreted some other way, but I still maintain there's one obvious interpretation [06:45:48]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:45:48] you seem to have conflicting logic [06:45:48]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	Ycros	[06:46:02] it's not conflicting, but maybe I'm not stating it in a way that you're understanding [06:46:02]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	Ycros	[06:47:43] ie. if a scooter has just brakes, then only the brakes condition is relevant to the whole statement. If a scooter has brakes AND an accelerator, then both the braken and the accelerator condition are releavent to the statement. In that laterr case, either one could trigger it. But only implementing a trigger on the brakes if it has an accelerator would be invalid. [06:47:43]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	Ycros	[06:48:36] but the condition can't trigger if the accelerator doesn't exist, so it's an impossibility for it to go true [06:48:36]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:48:55] the argument here is does it need to have all 3 conditions [06:48:55]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:49:18] do you interpret that as it does to satisfy that statement? [06:49:18]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	Ycros	[06:49:20] well, yes. But some might always be false (ie. missing brakes or an accelerator) [06:49:20]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:49:35] so..going back to this [06:49:35]
2016-10-12 22:54:40	_Hex_	[06:49:40] and looking at it logically [06:49:40]

2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:41:19] but if one of the other variables are true [06:41:19]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:41:24] then the result will = true [06:41:24]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	Ycros	[06:41:28] what's wrong with that? [06:41:28]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:41:31] i.e. a = true, b= false, c= false [06:41:31]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	Ycros	[06:41:32] yep [06:41:32]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:41:34] then the statement = true [06:41:34]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	Ycros	[06:41:43] yes [06:41:43]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:41:44] the only way it could be false is if a/b/c are false [06:41:44]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	Ycros	[06:41:50] indeed [06:41:50]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:41:51] which is NOT what you originally interpreted it as [06:41:51]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	Ycros	[06:41:55] yes it is [06:41:55]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:41:58] no it's not [06:41:58]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:42:25] <_Hex_> Ycros: okay..so does that mean it needs to have the functionality of all 3? [06:42:25]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:42:25] <_Hex_> and if any one of those occurs [06:42:25]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:42:25] <_Hex_> or does it mean that it only needs to have 1 of those features [06:42:25]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:42:25] <Ycros> the first one. Functionality of all 3, if any occurs. [06:42:25]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	Ycros	[06:42:34] yep [06:42:34]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:42:39] ?!?!?!? [06:42:39]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	Ycros	[06:43:02] some conditions will never trigger because they can't, that doesn't invalidate my interpretation [06:43:02]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:43:02] let me rephrase then [06:43:02]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:43:14] you said a/b/c = true for the statement to = true [06:43:14]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:43:28] i.e. it NEEDS to have the functionality of all 3 [06:43:28]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:43:53] but now you say only 1 of A/B/C needs to be true for the statement to be true [06:43:53]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:44:13] those are two very different interpretations [06:44:13]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	Ycros	[06:44:28] like, if it had A AND B as conditions that could happen (because their dependents are implemented), I'd say it would still need to comply with A OR B triggering. Just triggering off "A" and never triggering off "B" would be incorrect [06:44:28]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:44:59] well..AND was never mentioned [06:44:59]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:45:07] that's a different set of logic [06:45:07]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:45:16] but you can see how this can be interpreted multiple ways now? [06:45:16]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	Ycros	[06:45:18] no, read what I'm saying [06:45:18]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:45:39] hmm [06:45:39]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	Ycros	[06:45:48] I can see how you might have mistakenly interpreted some other way, but I still maintain there's one obvious interpretation [06:45:48]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:45:48] you seem to have conflicting logic [06:45:48]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	Ycros	[06:46:02] it's not conflicting, but maybe I'm not stating it in a way that you're understanding [06:46:02]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	Ycros	[06:47:43] ie. if a scooter has just brakes, then only the brakes condition is relevant to the whole statement. If a scooter has brakes AND an accelerator, then both the braken and the accelerator condition are releavent to the statement. In that laterr case, either one could trigger it. But only implementing a trigger on the brakes if it has an accelerator would be invalid. [06:47:43]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	Ycros	[06:48:36] but the condition can't trigger if the accelerator doesn't exist, so it's an impossibility for it to go true [06:48:36]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:48:55] the argument here is does it need to have all 3 conditions [06:48:55]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:49:18] do you interpret that as it does to satisfy that statement? [06:49:18]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	Ycros	[06:49:20] well, yes. But some might always be false (ie. missing brakes or an accelerator) [06:49:20]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:49:35] so..going back to this [06:49:35]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:49:40] and looking at it logically [06:49:40]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	Ycros	[06:49:43] which is how I interpreted it at the start, but maybe poorly explained [06:49:43]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:49:50] the statement to be true [06:49:50]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:49:54] must have A/B/C [06:49:54]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:50:05] and ONE or MORE of those must be true [06:50:05]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:50:10] for the statement to be true? [06:50:10]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	Ycros	[06:50:58] I'm not sure I can explain it more thoroughly than I just did [06:50:58]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:51:17] heh..okay..thanks for trying [06:51:17]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:51:26] i'm interested to get a legal opinion on this [06:51:26]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	Ycros	[06:51:52] it's possible that they should have added "if fitted". Or there's other language elsewhere that clarifies that. [06:51:52]
2016-10-12 23:31:42	_Hex_	[06:55:25] bed [06:55:25]

2016-10-13 15:02:26	bongofury	uh nah
2016-10-13 15:02:34	bongofury	that was just called "dubstep"
2016-10-13 15:02:51	bongofury	because there was another sound called dubstep, and this was the closest to him
2016-10-13 15:02:58	bongofury	then it all shitflowed downhill from there
2016-10-13 15:03:08	bongofury	language, especially new language, is fluid
2016-10-13 15:03:12	MSHMTX	im just saying the ppl who were inspired by burial
2016-10-13 15:03:20	MSHMTX	burial was considered dubstep
2016-10-13 15:03:30	MSHMTX	but like machinedrum and faltydl not really so much
2016-10-13 15:03:31	bongofury	not a lot of people remeber that before burial

2016-10-13 16:17:28	AdmiralBumbleBee	I use designer 99% of the time
2016-10-13 16:17:33	kerrang	AdmiralBumbleBee: i mean the main reason i want designer is to do both UI design and digital drawing possibly through a wacom tablet
2016-10-13 16:17:34	AdmiralBumbleBee	so I'm probably a poor one to ask even
2016-10-13 16:17:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: designer then, 100%.
2016-10-13 16:19:34	kerrang	AdmiralBumbleBee: yeah, i was thinking there may be feature differences for the drawing because of the vector graphic difference, but so far i haven't seen anything to worry about

2016-10-13 17:17:39	MSHMTX	[02:13:40] the game all fucked up [02:13:40]

2016-10-13 17:17:39	prim3r	[02:15:02] because all these chicks everywhere get 200 messages a day [02:15:02]
2016-10-13 17:17:39	kerrang	[02:15:20] i'd be a bit concerned about age in my location, suburbs man [02:15:20]
2016-10-13 17:17:39	kerrang	[02:15:36] i wouldn't be surprised if there were teens on tinder claiming they were 18 [02:15:36]

2016-10-13 17:17:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:16:14] similar feature parity [02:16:14]
2016-10-13 17:17:39	kerrang	[02:16:29] AdmiralBumbleBee: yes i know, was asking about specific features. [02:16:29]

2016-10-13 17:17:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:17:21] if you're unsure [02:17:21]
2016-10-13 17:17:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:17:28] I use designer 99% of the time [02:17:28]
2016-10-13 17:17:39	kerrang	[02:17:33] AdmiralBumbleBee: i mean the main reason i want designer is to do both UI design and digital drawing possibly through a wacom tablet [02:17:33]
2016-10-13 17:17:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:17:34] so I'm probably a poor one to ask even [02:17:34]
2016-10-13 17:17:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:17:41] kerrang: designer then, 100%. [02:17:41]
2016-10-13 17:17:39	kerrang	[02:19:34] AdmiralBumbleBee: yeah, i was thinking there may be feature differences for the drawing because of the vector graphic difference, but so far i haven't seen anything to worry about [02:19:34]
2016-10-13 17:17:39	kerrang	[02:19:39] thank you [02:19:39]

2016-10-13 22:05:18	TimbreWolfVM	does anyone want to buy my sony pcm-d100 dsd recorder for 480 euro? ^^
2016-10-13 22:07:10	torriz	y u selling it?
2016-10-13 22:09:17	TimbreWolfVM	i use the sp-404sx for recording now and prefer it due to its reverb
2016-10-13 22:09:31	TimbreWolfVM	and i *really* want the drumbrute asap :D
2016-10-13 22:10:23	TimbreWolfVM	also i got tired of hifi and want to go more towards lofi
2016-10-13 22:10:49	TimbreWolfVM	at least in a 90s sound instead of 2016 sound way
2016-10-13 22:11:02	torriz	interesting

2016-10-13 22:12:19	TimbreWolfVM	the pcm-d100 was the best portable solution i was able to afford at the time i bought it, it's sweet for recording things just as they are
2016-10-13 22:12:34	TimbreWolfVM	but i miss the noise and dirt of 16bit devices meanwhile

2016-10-13 22:27:22	TimbreWolfVM	indeed
2016-10-13 22:27:33	TimbreWolfVM	tested the mpx16 three times in total
2016-10-13 22:27:42	TimbreWolfVM	found bugs on every single unit within minutes
2016-10-13 22:27:54	TimbreWolfVM	lost data about 2 times an hour, entirely
2016-10-13 22:28:13	TimbreWolfVM	but i also used it with an sdhc card which it isn't made for, only takes sd actually
2016-10-13 22:28:27	TimbreWolfVM	possibly it's worth a sd card retry without hc

2016-10-13 23:04:12	legreffier	I gotta change the encoder pot though, it makes it a pain in the ass to use
2016-10-13 23:04:20	TimbreWolfVM	a friend saves up for the xbase and is totally fire for it
2016-10-13 23:04:24	TimbreWolfVM	he wants to make hardcore acid
2016-10-13 23:04:24	legreffier	same circuitry on the sound side.
2016-10-13 23:04:25	TimbreWolfVM	lol
2016-10-13 23:05:03	legreffier	xbase is kinda of another beast , since it has knob/function
2016-10-13 23:05:08	TimbreWolfVM	i kinda like the sound, but as basic drumcomputer tool it's too hard in the attacks for me
2016-10-13 23:05:26	legreffier	let your line inputs deal with it
2016-10-13 23:05:31	legreffier	ya know.
2016-10-13 23:05:43	TimbreWolfVM	i'm lucky arturia released the drumbrute, it's exactly what i need for a price i can soon afford
2016-10-13 23:06:00	legreffier	" - what's your limiter it sounds so good and natural ? - line in overdrive ! "
2016-10-13 23:06:11	TimbreWolfVM	lol ^^
2016-10-13 23:06:21	TimbreWolfVM	on good mixers that works great
2016-10-13 23:06:21	legreffier	2ms of red are NOT a big deal.
2016-10-13 23:06:31	legreffier	even on shitty one.
2016-10-13 23:06:34	TimbreWolfVM	on cheap mixers not so great imo
2016-10-13 23:06:47	TimbreWolfVM	some already recommended preamps instead of limiters to me
2016-10-13 23:06:53	TimbreWolfVM	like two for each stereo side
2016-10-13 23:06:54	legreffier	for <5ms, it's definitely ok
2016-10-13 23:07:01	TimbreWolfVM	a bit too expensive for what i want tho
2016-10-13 23:07:07	 *	legreffier take a smuggish look
2016-10-13 23:07:18	 *	legreffier "gritty analog drive""
2016-10-13 23:07:21	TimbreWolfVM	heh
2016-10-13 23:07:34	TimbreWolfVM	i use pedals for my analog fun
2016-10-13 23:07:52	TimbreWolfVM	might change with the drumbrute tho
2016-10-13 23:07:58	TimbreWolfVM	i think i'm going to use a proper mixer again
2016-10-13 23:08:47	legreffier	so i was saying : airbase is kind of a preset box, because control SUCK ! left/right button and one encoder pot... no good control
2016-10-13 23:09:05	TimbreWolfVM	ah ic
2016-10-13 23:09:12	TimbreWolfVM	but otherwise same functions as xbase?
2016-10-13 23:09:17	legreffier	i have some M4L mappers to send the right CC to the right place... but it's not the same.
2016-10-13 23:09:27	legreffier	same control, same circuits.
2016-10-13 23:09:39	legreffier	different workflow.
2016-10-13 23:09:41	TimbreWolfVM	ic
2016-10-13 23:09:51	TimbreWolfVM	are you going to change it for an xbase then?
2016-10-13 23:09:52	legreffier	stepper and swing too

2016-10-13 23:11:36	TimbreWolfVM	wrong channel
2016-10-13 23:12:18	TimbreWolfVM	what is nexus like? not satisfying then?

2016-10-13 23:15:45	legreffier	it's really nice and fun to use, and most of the time completely overkill.
2016-10-13 23:16:08	legreffier	really enjoyable if you make trance/electrohouse/mainroom/...
2016-10-13 23:16:37	bd-	i liked that other synth they used to make, Vanguard
2016-10-13 23:16:52	bd-	dunno why they stopped selling it
2016-10-13 23:17:18	legreffier	you can use it "as" a wavetable synth. but it's supposed to be a preset box.
2016-10-13 23:17:18		[23:17]
2016-10-13 23:17:58	legreffier	i think they could sell nexus better and more expensive

2016-10-13 23:24:47	legreffier	it doesn't have the overkill varnish around all Nexus sounds.
2016-10-13 23:24:57	legreffier	still similar sounding.

2016-10-14 14:04:26	_Hex_	needs tightening up too
2016-10-14 14:04:32	_Hex_	sustain wise
2016-10-14 14:04:40	_Hex_	your top end is a bit all over the show too
2016-10-14 14:04:48	_Hex_	tamb hits and other percussion stick out
2016-10-14 14:04:53	_Hex_	but not in a good way
2016-10-14 14:04:59	_Hex_	they're all hitting different freq points
2016-10-14 14:05:20	_Hex_	they should be matching the top end of your synth
2016-10-14 14:06:02	_Hex_	right now if i shelved the high end up on the whole mix you'd hear them stick out waaaaaaay further than i think you'd intended
2016-10-14 14:06:25	_Hex_	kick doesn't need that clicky top end either (goes back to better sample choice)
2016-10-14 14:07:31	Rory_	the clicky kick at 1:52?
2016-10-14 14:07:42	Rory_	and the percussion in the drops?
2016-10-14 14:08:21	Rory_	and what do you mean by 100 and 200

2016-10-14 14:09:40	_Hex_	100 and 200hz
2016-10-14 14:09:47	_Hex_	overall the kick is too clicky
2016-10-14 14:09:55	Rory_	too much high end?

2016-10-14 14:10:10	_Hex_	it has a nasty click sound
2016-10-14 14:10:12	_Hex_	just lowpass that kick
2016-10-14 14:10:23	_Hex_	if you're married to that sample (i don';t like it)
2016-10-14 14:10:26	_Hex_	then low pass kick
2016-10-14 14:10:31	_Hex_	shorten it
2016-10-14 14:10:42	_Hex_	and scoop out some of the lumpy freq between 100 and 200
2016-10-14 14:10:50	Rory_	how do i make the percussion stand out less?
2016-10-14 14:11:47	_Hex_	move the fader
2016-10-14 14:12:05	_Hex_	or eq out some specific freqs
2016-10-14 14:12:10	_Hex_	or apply something like a de-esser
2016-10-14 14:12:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	more specifically, move the fader up
2016-10-14 14:12:18	_Hex_	move the fader up?
2016-10-14 14:12:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	that's the best way to make elements stand out less
2016-10-14 14:12:36	_Hex_	i'm pretty sure he's just pulling your leg
2016-10-14 14:12:44	_Hex_	see if you're paying attention

2016-10-14 18:18:44	raz	even if i like the sound, impatience just makes me skip forward
2016-10-14 18:18:57	raz	obv it's different on a movie where you can't skip forward

2016-10-14 18:53:11	tehsma	u may be better off lowcutting out the sub entnirely above 120hz or higher and just using a triangle or sine with the same midi as the sub layer
2016-10-14 18:53:32	tehsma	mono, 1 voice, as minimal as posisble to ensure biggest impact

2016-10-15 06:11:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	anyway, probably just buy the anker usb 3 hub

2016-10-15 06:12:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	^ that one works and does anything you could want
2016-10-15 06:12:12	kerrang	i was comparing that to the sabret 4 usb 3 hub, looked the same except smaller
2016-10-15 06:12:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	the 4-port hubs lack some power sometimes
2016-10-15 06:12:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	and ports
2016-10-15 06:12:34	kerrang	ah
2016-10-15 06:12:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	all my hard drives are on that anker

2016-10-15 06:13:42	kerrang	for a more permenant fixure, yeah that would be better
2016-10-15 06:15:22	kerrang	i'm a bit surprised i dont see any usb 3.1 hubs

2016-10-15 06:15:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's like 50% slower
2016-10-15 06:15:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	I think it has some throttling bullshit based on available power

2016-10-15 09:33:45	Kiicki	Anyone know if third party plugins work when you route in mixer in Fl studio? kickstart for sidechaining does nothing when in routing. Other plugins do work, for example Reeverb 2

2016-10-15 09:34:10	alfie_but_spooky	Kiicki: con...fused. are you using them as inserts or sends?
2016-10-15 09:34:29	alfie_but_spooky	because processing (compression/whatever) isn't gonna have much of a useful effect if you're using it as a send

2016-10-15 09:35:41	Kiicki	I have two melodies. In channel 5 and 6. I have my kickstart in channel 10. I click on channel 5 and route it to 10. same with clicking on mixer 6 and send it to 10 which is my sidechain
2016-10-15 09:36:09	Kiicki	it does work with reeverb 2 plugin so i think I'm doing right?
2016-10-15 09:36:31	alfie_but_spooky	why not just run two copies of kickstart? that's the beauty of a plugin like kickstart, it's very low CPU usage and therefore allows you to run MILLIONS OF COPIES to tune your ducking perfectly for each channel
2016-10-15 09:36:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	 alfie_but_spooky using compression as a send is actually a very popular mixing technique
2016-10-15 09:37:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	usually called 'new york compression'
2016-10-15 09:37:18	Kiicki	It's just an example. I like to have many channels but many of those use the same plugin and setup. Just wondering why it doesn't work
2016-10-15 09:37:34	alfie_but_spooky	AdmiralBumbleBee: yup but talking about parallel processing is totally overcomplicating matters rn :P

2016-10-15 09:38:57	alfie_but_spooky	AdmiralBumbleBee: it's not factually wrong, i just omitted the more complicated parts, which i was gonna cover *later* once we'd solved Kiicki's actual problem
2016-10-15 09:39:16	alfie_but_spooky	Kiicki: can you try moving the instance of kickstart to just one of the melody channels, make sure it's actually doing kickstart things?
2016-10-15 09:39:30	alfie_but_spooky	because if fruity verb works, it SHOULD work
2016-10-15 09:39:43	Kiicki	I don't route much. I do indeed have been doing it individually but layering melodies, I prefer to have them in individual channels. just because some melodies need something different but they all could also have something in common. Which is why I make an "all sidechain channel"
2016-10-15 09:40:07	Kiicki	yeah, doing it individualy works.
2016-10-15 09:40:16	Kiicki	So I know that the plugin does work
2016-10-15 09:40:27	alfie_but_spooky	wait... do me a favour, take a screenshot of what your mixer looks like? i think i know what's wrong, i just want to confirm it
2016-10-15 09:40:39	alfie_but_spooky	are the melody channels being routed to the master and the sidechain buss at the same time?

2016-10-15 09:42:14	Kiicki	So the melody is in channel 5 and in channel 10 is the kickstart
2016-10-15 09:42:15	alfie_but_spooky	yup, it's going to the master. that's why it's not working
2016-10-15 09:42:22	Kiicki	aah
2016-10-15 09:42:23	alfie_but_spooky	you're hearing both kickstart and the un-kickstarted version of the signal
2016-10-15 09:42:31	alfie_but_spooky	so, my inital suspicions were correct :D
2016-10-15 09:42:42	Kiicki	Now it works. Thanks!
2016-10-15 09:43:15	Kiicki	It's weird how there was no problem with reeverb 2. maybe it works even better now or something

2016-10-15 09:43:52	alfie_but_spooky	now, what AdmiralBumbleBee was talking about is parallel compression; mixing a heavily compressed version of a signal with the dry version.
2016-10-15 09:44:17	alfie_but_spooky	Kiicki: now you've unrouted it from the master, replace kickstart with reeverb 2 and you'll figure out why you thought it was working :D
2016-10-15 09:44:33	AdmiralBumbleBee	PersonaSound: death sandwiches
2016-10-15 09:44:43	alfie_but_spooky	tl;dr: you were listening to the dry signal as well as the wet signal. now you're just listening to the wet signal, which is why you can hear the ducking now
2016-10-15 09:44:50	Kiicki	yeah, just tested it out. It's way better now. I really appreciate it!
2016-10-15 09:44:52	PersonaSound	i love those things
2016-10-15 09:45:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	Kiicki: you should have been able to hear the ducking before as well, but less so
2016-10-15 09:45:21	AdmiralBumbleBee	it may be worth redoing your erroneous routing and listening again
2016-10-15 09:45:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	just so you are aware of what you were hearing
2016-10-15 09:45:29	Kiicki	yeah, it was barely. It was so bad though which is why I thought something was wrong
2016-10-15 09:45:30	alfie_but_spooky	mmhm, agreed
2016-10-15 09:45:55	alfie_but_spooky	look at the routing in the FL mixer: you'll see you were listening to two copies of the signal, the dry and the ducked version
2016-10-15 09:45:59	AdmiralBumbleBee	Kiicki: I'm pointing it out because if you said 'barely working' the issue would have been immediately obvious
2016-10-15 09:46:09	AdmiralBumbleBee	Kiicki: but you said not working... which made this take much longer :)
2016-10-15 09:46:15	alfie_but_spooky	AdmiralBumbleBee: hey, the issue WAS immediately obvious, i picked up on it quickly ;)
2016-10-15 09:46:49	alfie_but_spooky	but no, it's my fault for not realising FL can route OUT to multiple channels :P i don't use FL, again
2016-10-15 09:46:54	Kiicki	yeah, I should have stated that I barely heard the difference
2016-10-15 09:47:08	 *	alfie_but_spooky holds cubase & live close
2016-10-15 09:48:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	alfie_but_spooky: cubase can do that too though :P
2016-10-15 09:48:32	alfie_but_spooky	although actually i've been toying with bitwig recently. it's very, very clean... i still prefer live most of the time (bitwig is a CPU hog >.<) but holy shit the weird clip audio sequencing in bitwig is SO COOL for the kinda stuff i do
2016-10-15 09:49:23	alfie_but_spooky	AdmiralBumbleBee: yeah, but i use it SO goddamn rarely :P i'm used to the way live does it, which is admittedly kinda sub-par compared to "take the output from this and put it there" but it works well enough for what i do so //shrug
2016-10-15 09:49:23		[09:49]
2016-10-15 09:51:23	alfie_but_spooky	the one thing i wish live did was had actual busses a-la "proper" studio desks: i really dislike using returns or audio tracks purely to sum and route out to my summing hardware
2016-10-15 09:51:39	alfie_but_spooky	but that's me being a picky fuck :P
2016-10-15 09:52:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	I don't think that's really that picky
2016-10-15 09:52:09	AdmiralBumbleBee	it really simplifies mixing larger projects
2016-10-15 09:52:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	for many, many reasons, it seems like Live expects you to never use any more than ~16-20 tracks
2016-10-15 09:53:41	alfie_but_spooky	yeah. i mean, i can *do* it in live, it's not hard to do at all, i just have a set of audio tracks at the top of my arrangement which are routed out to my summing hardware, and then another audio track which brings that summed signal back in and to live's master channel so i can still render in live
2016-10-15 09:53:49	alfie_but_spooky	it's convoluted as fuck, sure, but it does work pretty well
2016-10-15 09:54:31	alfie_but_spooky	i'd just much prefer having multiple mixbusses and then group switches a-la analog studio desks
2016-10-15 09:55:42	alfie_but_spooky	especially as my projects often hit 60 channels or more :D

2016-10-15 13:52:05	ionide	did you use samples or is most of it midi?
2016-10-15 13:52:20	ionide	like the keys are really chill
2016-10-15 13:52:28	ionide	a bit messy.
2016-10-15 13:52:36	raz	i need to turn down the low end tho..  even i can hear that.. that means theres at least 20dB too much lol
2016-10-15 13:52:39	ionide	when both the bass and keys are playing at the same time
2016-10-15 13:53:04	ionide	You could try to drop the bass when the jazz-keys are playing
2016-10-15 13:53:32	raz	yea the end part with the vox is complete mess still
2016-10-15 13:54:24	ionide	I DO love the style
2016-10-15 13:54:41	ionide	But the keys should be "stand alone" some how
2016-10-15 13:55:11	ionide	to be insinuated/be in focus
2016-10-15 13:55:23	ionide	since it sounds like its one of the key elements to the style
2016-10-15 13:55:42	ionide	have fun and experiment
2016-10-15 13:55:47	raz	hmm yea
2016-10-15 13:55:53	raz	may try a solo part

2016-10-15 13:58:11	ionide	3-4 years gotta count for something i guess.

2016-10-15 13:59:13	kerrang	heh i'd wish i coudl come up with some of those sounds, they're good
2016-10-15 13:59:27	ionide	its all serum dawg
2016-10-15 13:59:28	kerrang	i wouldn't go the arp route on that one

2016-10-15 17:03:16	kerrang	[23:56:50] i don't really have a dedicated bitcrusher that sounds good [23:56:50]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	raz	[23:57:33] ionide: not bad at all [23:57:33]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	raz	[23:57:50] not my genre but damn you are good with sound [23:57:50]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	ionide	[23:58:11] 3-4 years gotta count for something i guess. [23:58:11]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	ionide	[23:58:34] i feel like im getting more into sound design than track making in the latest [23:58:34]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	kerrang	[23:59:13] heh i'd wish i coudl come up with some of those sounds, they're good [23:59:13]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	ionide	[23:59:27] its all serum dawg [23:59:27]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	kerrang	[23:59:28] i wouldn't go the arp route on that one [23:59:28]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	ionide	[23:59:45] please carry on with your rant, would love to hear it [23:59:45]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	kerrang	[00:00:06] ionide: that's vauge as shit, serum has it's own whole set of effects [00:00:06]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	kerrang	[00:00:14] but they are quality stuff [00:00:14]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	ionide	[00:00:28] The effects are shit though, don't use them. almost exclusivley [00:00:28]

2016-10-15 17:03:16	ionide	[00:00:40] ) [00:00:40]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	ionide	[00:01:46] when i do serum i play around with either sine/saw/square and FM [00:01:46]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	ionide	[00:02:24] porta, fm and basic filtering with lfo [00:02:24]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	ionide	[00:03:19] i need more sigarettes, but i'm empty [00:03:19]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	kerrang	[00:04:36] oh hey a cool chiptune album https://shirobon.bandcamp.com/album/dimensions [00:04:36]

2016-10-15 17:03:16	ionide	[00:05:09] sounds crazy [00:05:09]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	ionide	[00:05:29] have you tried chiptuning your own keyboards? its cray [00:05:29]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	ionide	[00:05:39] idk if that's thre right analogy [00:05:39]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	kerrang	[00:06:25] that didn't make any sense to me [00:06:25]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	ionide	[00:09:01] im not talking about midi keyboards [00:09:01]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	ionide	[00:09:32] i'm talking about physically messing with the boards of an electronic keyboard to get glitchy sounds [00:09:32]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	kerrang	[00:10:24] you mean circuit bending, different thing from chiptunes [00:10:24]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	kerrang	[00:10:29] well kinda [00:10:29]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	kerrang	[00:11:07] it's been something i wanted to try, but i don't have the room or equipment to do any electronics work [00:11:07]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	ionide	[00:11:54] ah yeah, circuit beding [00:11:54]

2016-10-15 17:03:16	Questionable	[01:19:14] Hey there, does anyone perhaps know how I can make the downlifter at 1:49 in this track? It's obviously just an LFO on some noise but I've been going through different noise settings in Serum and Massive and nothing sounds like it. https://soundcloud.com/seven-lions/seven-lions-deep-divide [01:19:14]

2016-10-15 17:03:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	[01:21:30] Questionable: with a reverb [01:21:30]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	Questionable	[01:23:59] Could you be a bit more specific? :P [01:23:59]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	kerrang	[01:25:28] he was pretty specific [01:25:28]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	Questionable	[01:26:18] Maybe I just don't understand then. :/ [01:26:18]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	Questionable	[01:26:31] Like, what kind of filter? [01:26:31]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	kerrang	[01:26:32] oh gawd our corporate videos are so... corproate? [01:26:32]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	kerrang	[01:26:56] video is also laggy? watdafaq [01:26:56]
2016-10-15 17:03:16	kerrang	[01:27:40] like noticable blurring (not sure what causes that on video, i don't think they recorded below 30 fps) [01:27:40]
