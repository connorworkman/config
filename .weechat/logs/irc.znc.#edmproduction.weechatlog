2016-09-16 14:59:20	Kimryd	uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
2016-09-16 14:59:22	kerrang	i'd rather not stick everything into a drum machine, but i may have no choice
2016-09-16 14:59:32	Kimryd	let me czech
2016-09-16 14:59:36	Rory_	yeah i thought you had to use slicer
2016-09-16 15:00:15	bongofury	no shit
2016-09-16 15:00:46	Kimryd	kerrang, you want to map samplers to individual keys?
2016-09-16 15:00:54	kerrang	yeah
2016-09-16 15:01:05	bongofury	:(
2016-09-16 15:01:13	bongofury	thanks for the news Kimryd
2016-09-16 15:01:17	bongofury	they're all gone
2016-09-16 15:01:17	kerrang	i was looking at the midi mapping, but can't find a way to trigger a midi note
2016-09-16 15:01:26	bongofury	1st generation is all in the dust
2016-09-16 15:01:33	bongofury	Bob, Don, Rich
2016-09-16 15:01:39	bongofury	thuper thad
2016-09-16 15:01:54	Kimryd	kerrang, try
2016-09-16 15:02:05	Kimryd	drop a sample in sampler, right click, convert to multi-sample
2016-09-16 15:02:13	Kimryd	Then edit multisample
2016-09-16 15:02:24	Kimryd	you get this https://gyazo.com/bfe0e4dbf3bd50cb3b2311d2fa69f54f

2016-09-16 15:03:31	Kimryd	Otherwise you can try a mcguyver thingy by using note filters and note receivers and shit...
2016-09-16 15:05:30	kerrang	oh so that's how you get multisample
2016-09-16 15:05:41	Kimryd	That is how you get multisamplu
2016-09-16 15:05:58	Kimryd	I've never tried to slice in bitwig
2016-09-16 15:06:05	kerrang	that would make the drum machine more managable
2016-09-16 15:06:06	Kimryd	I rarely slice to begin with
2016-09-16 15:06:27	kerrang	eh i'm not slicing, but i just wanted to group certain samples together when i could
2016-09-16 15:06:35	Kimryd	o
2016-09-16 15:06:35	kerrang	multisample basically solves that
2016-09-16 15:06:58	Kimryd	Have you figured out how exactly dafuq the polyphonic LFOs work?
2016-09-16 15:07:05	Kimryd	Like, what makes it polyphonic?
2016-09-16 15:07:16	kerrang	plfo?
2016-09-16 15:07:20	Kimryd	Yes
2016-09-16 15:07:36	kerrang	nope

2016-09-16 15:11:20	kerrang	Kimryd: I think the name makes it pretty straight forward, an lfo for each voice basically
2016-09-16 15:11:32	kerrang	simulates the sum of an lfo per note on
2016-09-16 15:11:51	kerrang	at least thats what it seems like when i play with it with fm4

2016-09-16 15:12:35		[15:12]
2016-09-16 15:13:09	Kimryd	So, if I have a 5 note chord playing, and I set PLFO > Cutoff, then, it'll magically create 5 LFOs for the duration of the notes?
2016-09-16 15:13:21	Kimryd	Because that's what I see in my head but I'm going "naaaaaaaaaaaaaaah"
2016-09-16 15:16:30	kerrang	kinda, i think
2016-09-16 15:17:08	kerrang	it makes more sense when you think of an arpeggio instead, because then the same lfo (per voice) gets added in at different times
2016-09-16 15:17:18	kerrang	so you can better visualize the interference
2016-09-16 15:18:10	kerrang	if you have a basic midi chord without any humanization then all the simulated lfos just get summed together in phase
2016-09-16 15:18:17	Kimryd	OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
2016-09-16 15:18:19	Kimryd	Got it
2016-09-16 15:18:36	Kimryd	Right, that's why it wasn't making sense. I was imagining the notes triggering at the same time
2016-09-16 15:19:27	kerrang	yeah, kinda tricky to see without any mention in the manual about it
2016-09-16 15:19:42	kerrang	bitwig manual -> 4/10
2016-09-16 15:20:07	kerrang	though tbh i haven't looked at it in a while
2016-09-16 15:21:33	Kimryd	The manual fucking sucks
2016-09-16 15:22:01	kerrang	iirc i was so happy to see that it was a well designed manual, but it's missing so much content
2016-09-16 15:22:05	kerrang	heartbreaking
2016-09-16 15:23:07	Kimryd	I want to see a section in the manual titled "Why we made an oscilloscope before implementing any kind of spectrum"
2016-09-16 15:23:18	Kimryd	"and a cowbell synth"
2016-09-16 15:23:51	kerrang	right
2016-09-16 15:24:17	kerrang	it's surprsing to me that i can't drag around my multisample region, you have to set the range
2016-09-16 15:24:38	Kimryd	I don't know anything about that stuff at all
2016-09-16 15:25:31	kerrang	ableton didn't have multisamples right? (not talking about drum pad)
2016-09-16 15:26:10	Kimryd	Sampler does
2016-09-16 15:27:01	kerrang	and it just dawned on me that i can't treat samples differently

2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:32:29] but ya i think it's the background bass sound that's the problem, the melody is fine. but the background sound is more monotonous throughout the song [09:32:29]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:32:41] which kind of overshadows the more lively melody [09:32:41]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:33:44] yeah true [09:33:44]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:33:50] i never understood basslines [09:33:50]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:34:16] like you know how a lot of song [09:34:16]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:34:24] starts out with the bass, percussion, drum along with the melody [09:34:24]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:34:36] yup [09:34:36]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:35:00] and i just start with chords [09:35:00]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:35:04] then there's a switch, silence, the bass or percussion is cut out, and we have the drop where the melody becomes the focus [09:35:04]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:35:11] with a slight increase in volume and intensity [09:35:11]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:35:36] but there still needs to be a lot of bass in the drop or it sounds empty [09:35:36]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:36:20] maybe... but what i mean is, when the song is transitioning, that's when you can make those changes to make the song more lively [09:36:20]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:36:21] and dynamic [09:36:21]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:36:24] :> [09:36:24]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:36:51] sometimes less is more, so when you do use a certain sound again in the sound, it's more meaningful [09:36:51]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:37:13] yeah i think i get you [09:37:13]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:37:34] do you reckon i should make the lead more prominent [09:37:34]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:37:49] and the bass less so [09:37:49]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:37:51] by focusing the listener's ears to different instruments [09:37:51]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:38:05] sometimes it's the melody that's in focus, sometimes it's the beefy bass, percussion, etc [09:38:05]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:38:20] heh dont know, just play around with it! [09:38:20]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:38:35] hey you're right [09:38:35]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:38:37] others can help you mroe i'm sure. i've never even used a daw. i'm looking to start myself lol [09:38:37]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:39:06] you should man [09:39:06]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:39:15] it's fun but you'll hate yourself a lot [09:39:15]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:40:21] i just started learning the piano too, but i figured i could use this time to at least get familiar with a daw's interface, etc :D [09:40:21]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:41:32] go for it [09:41:32]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:41:36] what daw you have in mind? [09:41:36]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:41:56] the popular one seems to be fl studio and ableton [09:41:56]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:42:01] so i'm mostly considering these two [09:42:01]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:42:07] i use fl [09:42:07]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:42:15] like it? :D [09:42:15]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:42:46] yeah, it's really nice. i was a bit dumb and stayed away from tutorials and so didn't really progress in anything for ages tho [09:42:46]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:42:59] balance tutorials with practice [09:42:59]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:43:26] i've used it for about exactly a year now [09:43:26]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:44:00] here's my first song for comparison https://soundcloud.com/rorymadden/attempt-3/s-HBed5 [09:44:00]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	polyvox_	[09:44:01] ^ Reverse Play by Rory Madden [Soundcloud] [09:44:01]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:44:53] basically a mix of sytrus presets and 909s [09:44:53]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:45:12] good start! [09:45:12]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:45:24] lol [09:45:24]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:45:36] can defintely tell from the second song that you've progressed through the year :) [09:45:36]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:45:38] i remember for ages i thought it was super good [09:45:38]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:45:45] hahah thanks dude [09:45:45]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:45:47] ya it's really not bad! [09:45:47]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:46:45] i hope i'll be able to make something half decent with my first song :> [09:46:45]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:47:05] gotta go though, be back later! [09:47:05]

2016-09-17 12:46:45	kerrang	bitwig supports linux, though i haven't tried it on that os
2016-09-17 12:48:42	kerrang	there are linux-developed daws, like aurdor but i can't remember them or what the quality is like

2016-09-17 14:33:53	spudzee	[23:52:30] is reaktor 6 worth it? [23:52:30]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[23:57:38] its worth it if you get it in Komplete [23:57:38]

2016-09-17 14:33:53	kerrang	[00:01:18] iirc subsignal had it [00:01:18]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	kerrang	[00:01:23] someone had it [00:01:23]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:03:18] i dunno it looks really dope to me [00:03:18]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	spudzee	[00:03:25] I'm buying it [00:03:25]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:03:26] being able to use whole reaktor synths as modules [00:03:26]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:03:33] it supposedly sounds really good [00:03:33]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:03:41] and it seems so much more intuitive than Reaktor 5 [00:03:41]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:03:58] But paying for reaktor alone is a couple hundred shy of just getting Komplete 11 right? [00:03:58]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	 *	spudzee [00:04:09] grumbles [00:04:09]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	spudzee	[00:04:14] I don't really wanna spend that much [00:04:14]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	spudzee	[00:04:47] Komplete 11 is 3x as much [00:04:47]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:05:24] but so much more products [00:05:24]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:05:26] just get it than [00:05:26]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:05:27] 200 bux [00:05:27]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:05:34] well worth it still [00:05:34]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:05:35] just saying [00:05:35]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	spudzee	[00:06:09] I wonder... if I buy Komplete later will they give me a discount cause I already have Massive and Reaktor? [00:06:09]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:11:35] lol no [00:11:35]

2016-09-18 09:55:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: I love ambient stuff.
2016-09-18 09:55:11	kerrang	then i just suck at ambient then
2016-09-18 09:55:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	ambient, experimental, post-rock, avant garde jazz
2016-09-18 09:55:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	that's like 95% of what I listen to
2016-09-18 09:55:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	mostly japanese
2016-09-18 09:55:47	kerrang	why do i remember you not liking ambient music then, guess i'm thinking of someone else
2016-09-18 09:55:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	I don't like 'ambient techno'
2016-09-18 09:55:57	kerrang	and ofc it'd be japanese ;)

2016-09-18 09:56:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: is there a point where this evolves
2016-09-18 09:56:52	AdmiralBumbleBee	or is this the '6 seconds of music in 8 minutes' type of shit
2016-09-18 09:57:00	kerrang	kinda the latter
2016-09-18 09:57:08	kerrang	it's not suppose to evovle
2016-09-18 09:57:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	are you intentionally avoi..
2016-09-18 09:57:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	ok
2016-09-18 09:57:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	well
2016-09-18 09:57:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	I got bored of it
2016-09-18 09:57:25	kerrang	not surprised
2016-09-18 09:57:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	but maybe at least fill out the spectrum a bit more
2016-09-18 09:57:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'm not in the mood for this type of music, I wouldn't say that me getting bored of it is any indicator of 'badness'
2016-09-18 09:58:00	kerrang	so actually i'm kinda basing the sound of of some space em siganls
2016-09-18 09:58:14	kerrang	so suppose to be long, drony, dark
2016-09-18 09:58:44	kerrang	but yeah, it's not the most interesting thing in the world
2016-09-18 09:58:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'm sure you could get it in to a game
2016-09-18 09:59:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	but I'm sitting here listening to tricot, and it's pretty jarring to move to this
2016-09-18 09:59:11	kerrang	hahahah yeah i'd imagine
2016-09-18 09:59:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	from the 3 minutes I heard..
2016-09-18 09:59:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	I think you could probbaly do more with the spectral space
2016-09-18 09:59:48	AdmiralBumbleBee	without making it sound like 'more'
2016-09-18 10:00:23	kerrang	yeah, get some quite layers to fill up the top-end in a subtle manner
2016-09-18 10:01:54	kerrang	eh, maybe i'll daw now and see what i can do

2016-09-18 12:27:09	OneChainz	Would you say its necessarily a hard sound to recreate

2016-09-18 13:10:54	OneChainz	in the mean time, i need to figure out how to decay my sub properly so that it isn't constant.
2016-09-18 13:11:11	OneChainz	If i cut if off at the snare, it sounds really weird, but if i sidechain to the snare, it's too constant.

2016-09-18 13:13:01	adq	i would keep the first 2, maybe 3 seconds of the one with the glitch maybe, nothing more
2016-09-18 13:13:02	OneChainz	Oh i do. Each of my sub notes starts on a kick, and goes through until the next kick. I don't like how it sounds as it constant hits the bass then. I want it to sound like some of the trap songs out there where it decays out if that makes sense
2016-09-18 13:13:55	werbel	OneChainz Have you tried making the notes short? So it hits you but doesn't linger
2016-09-18 13:13:58	OneChainz	I know some songs just completely kil the bass on the snare, but it sounds weird when i do.
2016-09-18 13:14:37	adq	just fade out your bass before the next hit
2016-09-18 13:14:54	adq	you can do that in many ways
2016-09-18 13:16:57	OneChainz	I'll try cutting the nte and playing with release

2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:00:55] Anyone have an idea where one would start in recreating the first bass in Phiso-Jotaro? [22:00:55]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:01:19] would one go with Vocoding? Or pitchbends/FM? [22:01:19]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	wrl	[22:02:22] hey you should link us to the track so we don't have to engage in any strenuous googling [22:02:22]

2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:08:06] Main lead in the first drop [22:08:06]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	polyvox_	[22:08:06] ^ Phiso - Jotaro [YouTube] [22:08:06]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:08:47] Super metallic so I'm guessing fm/pitch bend [22:08:47]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	wrl	[22:18:07] yeah, sounds FM to me too [22:18:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:24:50] gonna mess around with serum i guess. not sure what wave table id want [22:24:50]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	adq	[22:25:38] sounds also comb filter + some disto + some stacked fx + some eq [22:25:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:26:42] by stacked fx i presume you mean a sleugh of serum fx like compression, reverb, etc? [22:26:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:27:09] Would you say its necessarily a hard sound to recreate [22:27:09]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	adq	[22:31:56] if you're not used to recreating sound (like me), yes ;) [22:31:56]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:34:11] I guess I can find a similar sound and modify it or something. I tried sampling it but hated how it sounded sampled [22:34:11]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	wrl	[22:38:13] also perhaps figure out why you want to duplicate the sound exactly instead of just making something that has the same effect and vibe [22:38:13]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	wrl	[22:38:21] straight up copying is some basic bitch shit [22:38:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:39:18] Possible remix idea [22:39:18]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:39:44] was going to use it for a little part of the song then throw in my own sound [22:39:44]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	wrl	[22:39:49] what is there to remix here besides the pre-drop vocal sample? [22:39:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:39:53] copy pasting the lead didnt sound right [22:39:53]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	OneChainz	[22:40:27] I wanted to re work the drop. I mean, just messing around with it honestly. Most of the time I try to remix something it becomes it's own track [22:40:27]

2016-09-18 16:45:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	MSHMTX: and the people that make it past the stage where they still wanna know what an oscillator is, is about 1% of that.
2016-09-18 16:45:52	MSHMTX	yeah but there arent many advanced tutorials
2016-09-18 16:46:05	AdmiralBumbleBee	there aren't many advanced users that are idiots either :P

2016-09-18 16:46:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	the idea that an 'advanced user' needs a tutorial is a bit silly though, which is what I was poking fun at.

2016-09-18 16:49:01	MSHMTX	probable
2016-09-18 16:49:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	in my experience, the number of people that are passionate about music is a very small percentage of people that 'want to learn music'
2016-09-18 16:49:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	very small.
2016-09-18 16:49:48	AdmiralBumbleBee	so you have to realize that' we're a small section of another section of a sliver of ANOTHER sliver of the population.
2016-09-18 16:50:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	and I also think that most people figure 'if you made it this far, you've probably figured this out anyway' and don't think making a video about some advanced feature is worth it

2016-09-18 16:53:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	I have a bunch of random tutorials on youtube
2016-09-18 16:53:05	AdmiralBumbleBee	and that's certainly how I feel at least.
2016-09-18 16:53:19	MSHMTX	fair points for sure
2016-09-18 16:53:21	AdmiralBumbleBee	I have hundres on my computer (And various video sites)
2016-09-18 16:53:26	PersonaSound	saw it in my recommends on youtube but never checked it out
2016-09-18 16:53:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	and half the time I'm editing and I think "Well shit, if some dude even can understand this tutorial, he probably figured this out anyway..."
2016-09-18 16:53:46	MSHMTX	i think any kinda training beyond that is paid for or happens by knowing someone right place right time
2016-09-18 16:53:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	and then I get discouraged, half-ass it and don't put it on my channel

2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:47:35] MSHMTX: sure.. [02:47:35]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:47:53] MSHMTX: my point is, the number of people that want to know what an oscillator is outnumbers people like you by like 80,000:1 [02:47:53]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	MSHMTX	[02:48:03] lol [02:48:03]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:48:07] MSHMTX: so if people want their videos watched, what do you think they're going to choose to talk about? [02:48:07]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	MSHMTX	[02:48:11] what happens to all thos epeople do they just give up and use cymatics? [02:48:11]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:48:20] a. don't make it that far [02:48:20]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:48:28] b. give up when they realize bitches don't wanna date a dj [02:48:28]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:48:39] c. never liked music to begin with, and just wanted some ancillary benefit [02:48:39]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:48:48] d. discovered other passions [02:48:48]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:48:50] etc... [02:48:50]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	MSHMTX	[02:49:01] probable [02:49:01]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:49:19] in my experience, the number of people that are passionate about music is a very small percentage of people that 'want to learn music' [02:49:19]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:49:22] very small. [02:49:22]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:49:48] so you have to realize that' we're a small section of another section of a sliver of ANOTHER sliver of the population. [02:49:48]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:50:20] and I also think that most people figure 'if you made it this far, you've probably figured this out anyway' and don't think making a video about some advanced feature is worth it [02:50:20]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	MSHMTX	[02:52:40] i guess [02:52:40]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	MSHMTX	[02:53:00] PersonaSound, have you listened to Excisions Shambahla 2016 mix? [02:53:00]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:53:00] I have a bunch of random tutorials on youtube [02:53:00]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:53:05] and that's certainly how I feel at least. [02:53:05]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	MSHMTX	[02:53:19] fair points for sure [02:53:19]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:53:21] I have hundres on my computer (And various video sites) [02:53:21]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	PersonaSound	[02:53:26] saw it in my recommends on youtube but never checked it out [02:53:26]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:53:41] and half the time I'm editing and I think "Well shit, if some dude even can understand this tutorial, he probably figured this out anyway..." [02:53:41]
2016-09-19 02:43:57	MSHMTX	[02:53:46] i think any kinda training beyond that is paid for or happens by knowing someone right place right time [02:53:46]
2016-09-19 02:43:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:53:50] and then I get discouraged, half-ass it and don't put it on my channel [02:53:50]
2016-09-19 02:43:58	MSHMTX	[03:00:11] how good are you at editing [03:00:11]

2016-09-19 04:40:19	iamnew	hi guys, i have a question (maybe it is stupid but)
2016-09-19 04:41:26	iamnew	when i try to put some simple vocal phrase over some melody even if they are in the same key (sample title says so) it sounds like my ear is not prepared for it
2016-09-19 04:42:19	iamnew	i am not trying to make the most catchy song, i just want it to flow like water, when the listener hears it for first time, i dont know how to explain it better
2016-09-19 04:42:58	raz	be water my friend
2016-09-19 04:44:02	iamnew	sorry but i am not bruce lee

2016-09-19 04:45:59	raz	well, your question is impossible to answer
2016-09-19 04:46:05	raz	it is unspecific
2016-09-19 04:48:21	iamnew	@raz, i dont know how to explain it properly
2016-09-19 04:48:54	raz	then how do you expect us to answer a question that you can't ask?
2016-09-19 04:49:18	iamnew	@raz, how can i get the melody and vocal to sound good together, like when you listen for the first time the ear is prepared for it
2016-09-19 04:49:31	iamnew	@raz, not to sound like there is something wrong
2016-09-19 04:50:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	iamnew: that is totally contextual and style dependent.
2016-09-19 04:50:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	what the listener 'expects' depends on the style of music
2016-09-19 04:50:35	raz	yea, basically make it sound like other songs in your genre
2016-09-19 04:51:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	the melodic and harmonic expectations are all over the place for different genres
2016-09-19 04:51:15	raz	people tell me it also helps to be in key sometimes. but i don't really believe in that.
2016-09-19 04:51:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	if I'm writing some metalcore shit and not throwing minor 2 and tritones around, but every leap is a M3 P4 P5... it's going to sound awful
2016-09-19 04:51:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	or, it will sound like a new genre of music
2016-09-19 04:53:58	iamnew	hmm, since i am pretty noob at music theory, can you recommend on which topic should i read some books?
2016-09-19 04:53:58		[04:53]
2016-09-19 04:54:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	no
2016-09-19 04:54:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	go listen to some music and copy it.
2016-09-19 04:54:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	I can recommend books, but it won't help you
2016-09-19 04:54:30	AdmiralBumbleBee	go listen to some of your favorite songs and transcribe them
2016-09-19 04:54:37	AdmiralBumbleBee	that will get you where you want to go WAY faster.
2016-09-19 04:54:42	iamnew	i can make good melodies but only when they are played alone, when i try to make it more complex, put some more melodies on top it doesnt sound very good
2016-09-19 04:55:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	just go do what I said for 3-4 of your favorite songs
2016-09-19 04:55:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	harmony and melody AND rhythm.
2016-09-19 04:55:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	then try on your own again
2016-09-19 04:55:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	I guarantee it will be significantly better
2016-09-19 04:56:29	iamnew	also i have another stupid question
2016-09-19 04:57:08	iamnew	how can there be so much unique music when there are just 12 notes, and almost all EDM music is in minor scale
2016-09-19 05:01:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	most edm isn't minor scale
2016-09-19 05:01:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	iamnew: think of how many combinations of those notes are, with different timbres, expressions, rhythms
2016-09-19 05:03:51	iamnew	@AdmiralBumbleBee: my music library is 80% minor scales, and this post also confirms that: https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/smii1/til_most_of_edm_tracks_are_composed_in_minor_keys/
2016-09-19 05:03:52	polyvox_	^ TIL Most of EDM tracks are composed in Minor keys : edmproduction
2016-09-19 05:05:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	iamnew: that does not confirm what you said
2016-09-19 05:05:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	read again
2016-09-19 05:05:28	AdmiralBumbleBee	80% of 700 songs in one person's collection is.
2016-09-19 05:06:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	but let's just go ahead and assume that it's somehow correct
2016-09-19 05:06:18	AdmiralBumbleBee	then what?
2016-09-19 05:06:21	AdmiralBumbleBee	why does that matter at all?

2016-09-19 05:13:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	to your original question about complexity, assume a totally diatonic 3 note melody of 3 octaves
2016-09-19 05:13:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	that gives you over 12,000 possible combinations of notes

2016-09-19 05:13:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	add a second instrument with the same restriction, now you have 144+million combinations of notes.
2016-09-19 05:14:00	therue	meow :)
2016-09-19 05:14:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	2 instruments, 3 pitches.
2016-09-19 05:14:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	now add in the infinite rhythmic variation
2016-09-19 05:14:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	expression (filters, pitch modulation, timber modulations of various sorts)
2016-09-19 05:14:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	harmonic interactions
2016-09-19 05:14:48	AdmiralBumbleBee	you could make A LOT of very different sounding music with 3 notes.
2016-09-19 05:14:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	(in fact, and infinite amount of variation)

2016-09-19 05:26:55	iamnew	the plugins compared to ableton are not that good, but the workflow, the routing
2016-09-19 05:27:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	yeah, I don't own bitwig (since I have live and barely even touch that anyway)...
2016-09-19 05:27:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	but I totally agree with iamnew, just from using the demo twice
2016-09-19 05:27:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's a better program unless you can afford live Suite, then suite is a better value
2016-09-19 05:28:20	iamnew	you can do almost anything with shortcuts, with the mouse wheel you can zoom in zoom out scroll left/right
2016-09-19 05:29:33	iamnew	there is built in device called audio mod, which lets you controll every parameter of the plugins based on the incoming signal
2016-09-19 05:30:25	therue	there's also a great game that just came out that i plan on playing on windows anyway :P and i'm also kind of interested in demoscene, so being able use the platform the program will be running on is also another reason
2016-09-19 05:31:07	therue	of course there will be things i'll miss about linux, but i'll have the laptop for that
2016-09-19 05:31:47	iamnew	bitwig is cross platform, whatever you choose, i highly recommend you try it
2016-09-19 05:32:03	therue	oooh i see
2016-09-19 05:32:06	iamnew	i sound like i am marketing it, but just try it
2016-09-19 05:32:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	therue: which game
2016-09-19 05:32:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	therue: also yeah... you really need to try bitwig. I don't even own the shit, and I don't like how the company works... but it's great software.

2016-09-19 14:24:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	I REALLY like the new interface builder
2016-09-19 14:24:38	AdmiralBumbleBee	and swift 3 is a big improvement

2016-09-19 14:25:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	all?
2016-09-19 14:25:02	kerrang	i completely forgot there was a new xcode, had to go through the usual "accept new license" which fucked my openssl lib

2016-09-19 14:28:33	Ycros	yeah it'll be fun to see if I can get it working

2016-09-19 14:33:17	kerrang	kinda need multiple threads for any audio app, right?
2016-09-19 14:33:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	nah
2016-09-19 14:34:26	kerrang	tbh when it comes to plugins, i'm too confused about how threads are handled because the sdks seem to handle that
2016-09-19 14:35:02	Ycros	kerrang: your audio processing runs on one thread, all your other crap (like ui, midi handling, automation) runs on another
2016-09-19 14:35:55	kerrang	yeah that i get, i guess it's confusing to me because the plugin class you work has functions called in different threads
2016-09-19 14:36:08	Ycros	yep
2016-09-19 14:36:31	kerrang	so that one class needs to be super thread-friendly if you're going to create other threads for midi, ui, and io
2016-09-19 14:36:38	AdmiralBumbleBee	well, it depends on the host and api
2016-09-19 14:37:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	with vst2, it was entirely possible that all your shit got thrown on a single thread unless you forked
2016-09-19 14:37:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	then they changed that in 2.2 iirc?
2016-09-19 14:37:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	AU can still part you in a single context
2016-09-19 14:37:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	park
2016-09-19 14:37:29	Ycros	I don't even know how au works
2016-09-19 14:37:50	Ycros	I've only been directly working with newer vst 2 (and peeking at 3)
2016-09-19 14:38:42	kerrang	vst is my only aim since it's cross-platform, au(2 and 3) would be next on my list if i was comfortable with vst3
2016-09-19 14:38:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	well if you use vst3
2016-09-19 14:39:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	you get au for free
2016-09-19 14:39:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	if you use juce, you get everything for free (pace may be required)
2016-09-19 14:39:12	kerrang	they're similar i'm guessing?
2016-09-19 14:39:45	kerrang	oh nvm, yeah if i used juce for dev that's true
2016-09-19 14:40:17	kerrang	i just dislike juce because it encouraged bad audio dev practices without providing warnings
2016-09-19 14:40:44	kerrang	"hey you can use this parameter class, but just know it's not thread-safe" <- stuff new audio dev wouldn't necessarily know
2016-09-19 14:42:42	Ycros	kerrang: did you get a vst ui going from rust?
2016-09-19 14:43:04	Ycros	conrod has been getting a whole lot of dev, I'm going to try it
2016-09-19 14:43:29	kerrang	Ycros: no, i had to pull myself away from that project for a while. conrod was always going to be my choice for ui though
2016-09-19 14:43:46	_Hex_	do VST3 please
2016-09-19 14:43:47	_Hex_	fuck vst2

2016-09-19 14:43:49	kerrang	i forgot my rationale, but i had decided an immediate-mode ui made sense
2016-09-19 14:43:50	Ycros	it seems like the author is also building audio things based on some of the example screenshots

2016-09-19 14:46:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	reaper has vst3, but it's missing things
2016-09-19 14:46:15	_Hex_	i honestly think most of them do now
2016-09-19 14:47:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	so sonar is apparently missing part of the spec
2016-09-19 14:47:48	AdmiralBumbleBee	specifically preset handling (a huge part of it)
2016-09-19 14:47:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	so is samplitude
2016-09-19 14:47:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	reaper too
2016-09-19 14:47:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	not sure about fl
2016-09-19 14:48:01	_Hex_	they probably go with their own preset handling
2016-09-19 14:48:10	_Hex_	but really..most support using vst3 plugs
2016-09-19 14:48:14	_Hex_	maybe it's not 100% complete
2016-09-19 14:48:19	_Hex_	but vst3 is a damn sight better than vst2
2016-09-19 14:48:30	AdmiralBumbleBee	what do you like about vst3 over 2?
2016-09-19 14:48:42	Ycros	the 3 makes it way more aesthetic

2016-09-20 02:45:45	Nahck	been thinking about doepfers dc offset/polarizer/attenuator
2016-09-20 02:49:19	robotika	do you rock the modular? i guess, the answer is yes

2016-09-20 02:53:31	Nahck	distings on my shopping list for sure
2016-09-20 02:54:03	Nahck	and a phaser and a multimode  svf

2016-09-20 06:36:15	_Hex_	which i disagree with
2016-09-20 06:36:18	_Hex_	but oh well
2016-09-20 06:36:55	PersonaSound	that reminds me; what ratios would you use on a compressor for glueing things
2016-09-20 06:37:07	_Hex_	i guess that's what happens when you have a marketing guy making the tutorial vids
2016-09-20 06:37:21	PersonaSound	a retarded questions but i normally use 10:1:0 (?)  when smashing my high and mids on a bass
2016-09-20 06:37:23	_Hex_	depends the glue but usually low ratio, slow attack, long release
2016-09-20 06:37:35	PersonaSound	a slow attack?
2016-09-20 06:37:36	_Hex_	jesus..10:1 is pretty excessive for glue
2016-09-20 06:37:54	_Hex_	also depends on your definition of glue
2016-09-20 06:38:28	PersonaSound	well, i
2016-09-20 06:39:29	PersonaSound	i normally try to glue my mid and high back together on a bass after filtering, distorting, and fx processing each band
2016-09-20 06:40:09	PersonaSound	i try to glue the frequencies back together so that the bass still has some dynamics while all bands are equally leveled, no harsh high end

2016-09-20 08:12:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	probably toss on a high-pass too, then just some moderate compression, a very mild reverb and listen again
2016-09-20 08:12:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	then take it all off
2016-09-20 08:12:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	and start over
2016-09-20 08:13:15	AdmiralBumbleBee	after you listen
2016-09-20 08:13:18	Saint_Isidore	Do I just click on the high pass or do I need to adjust it as well
2016-09-20 08:13:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	doesn't matter too much

2016-09-20 08:15:59	AdmiralBumbleBee	no, that's how much gain reduction the compressor is doing
2016-09-20 08:16:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	so...
2016-09-20 08:16:04	Saint_Isidore	oh
2016-09-20 08:16:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	the meter should be bouncing on the -5

2016-09-20 11:09:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	so if you have 25.5' for instance
2016-09-20 11:09:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	find the distance between 25 and 26 with your ruler
2016-09-20 11:09:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	maybe it's 18mm, let's say that
2016-09-20 11:09:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	multiply that by the decimal seconds (0.5)
2016-09-20 11:10:09	AdmiralBumbleBee	and you know that your coord is 9mm perpendicular to 25'

2016-09-20 11:12:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	no, you'll get this.
2016-09-20 11:12:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	let's imagine that you need to plot something between 25 and 26 minutes
2016-09-20 11:12:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	ok?
2016-09-20 11:12:55	Estr	ok
2016-09-20 11:13:18	AdmiralBumbleBee	so
2016-09-20 11:13:18		[11:13]
2016-09-20 11:13:30	AdmiralBumbleBee	take your ruler and find the distance on your map between 25 and 26 inutes
2016-09-20 11:13:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	for this thought exercise, we'll assume that it's 18mm
2016-09-20 11:13:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	ok?
2016-09-20 11:13:59	Estr	ok
2016-09-20 11:14:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	so what we want to figure out, is how many mm ar in 1 second
2016-09-20 11:14:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	right?
2016-09-20 11:14:22	Estr	yes
2016-09-20 11:14:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	so first, you need your seconds in decimal
2016-09-20 11:14:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	if it's 25.5'... we know our seconds are everything after the .
2016-09-20 11:15:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	so 0.5
2016-09-20 11:15:15	AdmiralBumbleBee	if you saw 25' 30"... you need to convert seconds to decimal (still 0.5) there
2016-09-20 11:15:28	AdmiralBumbleBee	if you see 25' 0.5"... obviously it's 0.5
2016-09-20 11:15:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	following?
2016-09-20 11:15:52	Estr	yes
2016-09-20 11:16:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	so ALL you need to do
2016-09-20 11:16:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	is multiple decimal seconds by the physical measurement that 1 minute is.
2016-09-20 11:16:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	so 0.5 * 18mm
2016-09-20 11:16:37	AdmiralBumbleBee	and that means that 0.5 seconds is exactly 9mm away from 25 minutes on your map
2016-09-20 11:17:17	Estr	thats more accurate
2016-09-20 11:17:21	Estr	but its still not 110% accurate
2016-09-20 11:17:32	Estr	how do they get it accurate at boats?

2016-09-20 11:56:43	Estr	so there's no explenation
2016-09-20 11:57:03	adq	if  1 knot = 1,852 km/h is true, then a knot is a speed unit which is often under the hood (distance unit / time unit)
2016-09-20 11:57:12	adq	because s = d/t
2016-09-20 11:57:26	adq	later on you will see physics and acceleration maybe
2016-09-20 11:57:31	adq	which is another story
2016-09-20 11:57:56	adq	the derivative of accelleration is the speed

2016-09-20 11:59:39	Estr	after 2 years of apprentice and military and all that stuff I'll go to university
2016-09-20 11:59:40	adq	well more seriously Estr, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-multiplication
2016-09-20 11:59:41	polyvox_	^ Cross-multiplication - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
2016-09-20 11:59:47	Estr	and I've heard that the math there is very advanced
2016-09-20 11:59:56	adq	when you move stuff in your equation, and if everything has an associated unit
2016-09-20 12:00:10	adq	you can always find what it will be if you move "something"
2016-09-20 12:00:23	adq	impossible for me to explain in english properly it seems lol
2016-09-20 12:01:25	adq	like you could say: 1852km = 1 knot/h or etc..
2016-09-20 12:01:49	adq	oops i'm even wrong
2016-09-20 12:02:01	adq	1852km = 1 knot.h
2016-09-20 12:02:16	adq	or 1 knot/h⁻¹
2016-09-20 12:03:23	adq	slightly you should see why some weird units exist, like m/s² or  m·s⁻²
2016-09-20 12:03:28	Estr	1,852m*
2016-09-20 12:03:53	Estr	i mean km*
2016-09-20 12:04:43	adq	so next time, always verify that the unit(s) in your left part of the equal sign matches the unit(s) of your right side
2016-09-20 12:04:47	adq	if not, something is wrong
2016-09-20 12:05:05	adq	you would then have spotted you cannot have time = distance
2016-09-20 12:05:33	Estr	You're confusing me even more :^)
2016-09-20 12:05:51	adq	but this time i really wanted to help you :)
2016-09-20 12:07:08	adq	you need to familiarize yourself with moving stuff from left to right or right to left, from numerator to denominator or the contrary, etc
2016-09-20 12:07:27	adq	that's fundamental

2016-09-20 16:41:51	MSHMTX	now i feel like all the more active users make alternative type stuff
2016-09-20 16:42:09	kerrang	well i know i was one of those
2016-09-20 16:42:28	MSHMTX	no joke though it was all big room, electro, and neuro in here
2016-09-20 16:42:28	kerrang	got here to make edm, now i just complain about how most of it is bad
2016-09-20 16:42:47	MSHMTX	it has gotten bad hasnt it
2016-09-20 16:43:00	kerrang	and talk to all the people who actuall know stuff about production (cause no one else irl is interested in it)
2016-09-20 16:43:58	MSHMTX	how do u know the ppl u think know what theyre talking about know?
2016-09-20 16:44:45	kerrang	cause they make good music
2016-09-20 16:44:50	kerrang	so they know something
2016-09-20 16:45:31	kerrang	plus, come on, some people here have years of studio experience
2016-09-20 16:49:41	kerrang	heh, i kinda miss the days when my friends were interested in making music

2016-09-20 17:37:46	DylanT	I remember mixing on my monitors when I was using them... it sounds completely different ... I feel like when I mix in my headphones the whole sound sounds way different

2016-09-20 17:38:07	DylanT	Gonna start mixing lower

2016-09-20 17:55:56	kerrang	DylanT: bitwig

2016-09-20 17:56:22	_Hex_	?
2016-09-20 17:56:28	_Hex_	because if you're using peak meters when mixing
2016-09-20 17:56:32	_Hex_	you're doing it wrong
2016-09-20 17:56:37	_Hex_	they are next to useless

2016-09-20 17:57:48	kerrang	that's normal depending on how much you actually daw
2016-09-20 17:58:00	kerrang	if you don't do it regularly, you'll forget stuff
2016-09-20 17:58:06	_Hex_	read up on k-system metering
2016-09-20 17:58:15	_Hex_	that'll probaby be the most helpful
2016-09-20 17:58:30	_Hex_	that way you can see peak + average loudness and calibrate your environment

2016-09-20 18:49:18	_Hex_	a different metering system which is tied to monitoring
2016-09-20 18:49:22	_Hex_	so you can make better decisions
2016-09-20 18:49:31	_Hex_	and eliminate some of the guesswork
2016-09-20 18:49:48	_Hex_	because..really..peak meters don't help much at all
2016-09-20 18:50:06	_Hex_	there are way better standards out there now too

2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:25:42] he could have learned to not mix with peak meters [04:25:42]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:46:37] here you go dylan: http://www.aes.org/technical/documentDownloads.cfm?docID=65 [04:46:37]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	DylanT	[04:48:32] I wonder what the general gist im gonna learn from this article will be. [04:48:32]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:49:17] a different metering system which is tied to monitoring [04:49:17]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:49:22] so you can make better decisions [04:49:22]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:49:31] and eliminate some of the guesswork [04:49:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:49:48] because..really..peak meters don't help much at all [04:49:48]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:50:06] there are way better standards out there now too [04:50:06]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	DylanT	[04:50:16] Hmm [04:50:16]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:50:17] but i've yet to figure out how to integrate them into music [04:50:17]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	DylanT	[04:51:48] Feels like I need analog gear or something.. Lol [04:51:48]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:52:10] no..but you can use plug-ins which show you VU style metering [04:52:10]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:52:19] although your DAW should have k-system meters [04:52:19]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	DylanT	[04:52:20] Ah [04:52:20]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:52:23] and if not..there are free plugs [04:52:23]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:52:40] peaks show..err..peaks [04:52:40]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	_Hex_	[04:52:53] but they don't show shit with regards to avergae level..or perceived loudness [04:52:53]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	***	Playback Complete.
2016-09-20 18:53:20	_Hex_	and i guess ultimately you're probably trying to mix "loud" without it being crushed
2016-09-20 18:53:50	_Hex_	so you have that perceived power without squashing to oblivion in an attempt to raise the perceived loudness
2016-09-20 18:54:11	DylanT	I see

2016-09-20 19:06:09	|aaron	well ive tried to separate vocals out from a few different tracks using the polyphonic sustain mode
2016-09-20 19:06:22	|aaron	they were lossless source so no issue there

2016-09-20 19:07:09	|aaron	it just didnt separate out the vocals effectively. i even turn up the sensitivity in note edit mode to max but still it was all mushed together
2016-09-20 19:07:24	|aaron	ive had the same result with the last 4 tracks ive tried
2016-09-20 19:07:54	_Hex_	wait..are you trying to separate vocals from a mix?
2016-09-20 19:07:59	|aaron	yeah
2016-09-20 19:08:05	|aaron	its an advertised feature
2016-09-20 19:08:09	_Hex_	oh..no..no chance
2016-09-20 19:08:19	|aaron	haha ok
2016-09-20 19:08:27	|aaron	wont waste anymore time on that then lol

2016-09-20 19:09:07	_Hex_	yeah..that's near impossible at this point in technology
2016-09-20 19:09:22	|aaron	or a simpler example even, trying to pitch an acapella. it works except for the blobs that have vibrato, even if i turn the vibrato down with the tool it still sounds like ass if i change the pitch at all
2016-09-20 19:09:29	_Hex_	yep
2016-09-20 19:09:41	_Hex_	i thought you were talking about using it more for pitch correction
2016-09-20 19:09:45	_Hex_	monophonic
2016-09-20 19:10:01	|aaron	well in this example thats what i mean
2016-09-20 19:10:02	_Hex_	i've only had good results on the polyphonic side with single instruments
2016-09-20 19:10:11	_Hex_	e.g. fixing bad pitch on an acoustic guitar part
2016-09-20 19:10:24	|aaron	gotcha

2016-09-20 19:10:31	_Hex_	for fixing vibrato on a single vox
2016-09-20 19:10:36	_Hex_	you really need to split things up
2016-09-20 19:10:46	_Hex_	so you leave that initial part alone
2016-09-20 19:10:59	_Hex_	and gradually fix the tial

2016-09-20 19:11:08	_Hex_	rather than going all in on it

2016-09-20 19:11:47	|aaron	sigh so much for the diy acapella dream lol
2016-09-20 19:11:52	_Hex_	heh
2016-09-20 19:11:53	|aaron	maybe in 10 years
2016-09-20 19:12:04	_Hex_	you can usually find acapellas for shit out there
2016-09-20 19:12:07	_Hex_	if you look hard enough

2016-09-20 19:13:36	_Hex_	that's the technical article btw
2016-09-20 19:13:41	_Hex_	if you do a good search
2016-09-20 19:13:49	_Hex_	there are guys who have broken it down into layman's terms
2016-09-20 19:13:52	_Hex_	and it's far easier to digest
2016-09-20 19:13:52	DylanT	So there ARE plugins for VU meters?
2016-09-20 19:13:56	_Hex_	oh 100%
2016-09-20 19:13:58	_Hex_	tons of them

2016-09-21 13:41:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	gotta keep my weeb status intact
2016-09-21 13:41:24	lums	and then work with a limited set until i want more features(have more money)
2016-09-21 13:41:36	MSHMTX	is the ipad version prettier
2016-09-21 13:41:37	MSHMTX	?
2016-09-21 13:41:39	Ycros	lums: I have a 4ms dual looping delay, which is rad. It's a very clean clocked delay
2016-09-21 13:41:48	AdmiralBumbleBee	MSHMTX: yes, way better than ps2 or psp versions
2016-09-21 13:42:14	lums	sweet
2016-09-21 13:42:17	MSHMTX	like right at the timestamp?
2016-09-21 13:42:43	_Hex_	yeah
2016-09-21 13:42:50	MSHMTX	its like a square pluck
2016-09-21 13:42:57	MSHMTX	with some like screamy filter
2016-09-21 13:43:09	AdmiralBumbleBee	MSHMTX: can you find the preset that matches it
2016-09-21 13:43:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	is the question ^
2016-09-21 13:43:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	or comes close I guess
2016-09-21 13:43:18	_Hex_	basically..yeah...
2016-09-21 13:43:27	MSHMTX	i think the screamy part might just be a layer
2016-09-21 13:43:30	_Hex_	i'm having to basically mix a re-creation of this track today
2016-09-21 13:43:37	_Hex_	and the sound they've got there
2016-09-21 13:43:40	_Hex_	is just terrible
2016-09-21 13:43:44	MSHMTX	AdmiralBumbleBee for what?
2016-09-21 13:43:47	_Hex_	they haven't matched it at all
2016-09-21 13:43:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	MSHMTX: for the sound _Hex_ linked.
2016-09-21 13:43:58	MSHMTX	any synth?
2016-09-21 13:44:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	serum
2016-09-21 13:44:14	Ycros	lums: if you're running external stuff in then you'll want the rosie or some other way of gaining your external signal, modular audio typically sits at -5 to 5V (or 10V peak to peak), your other gear is probably sitting at under 4V peak to peak
2016-09-21 13:44:33	MSHMTX	let me hear theirs?
2016-09-21 13:44:33	MSHMTX	lol
2016-09-21 13:44:34	Ycros	or less depending on the gear :P

2016-09-21 13:46:26	Ycros	although many external mixers will handle the levels ok
2016-09-21 13:47:40	lums	ah yeah, haven't read up on that yet
2016-09-21 13:47:55	lums	colin benders is great
2016-09-21 13:52:58	Ycros	lums: the rosie module that you added does both those things
2016-09-21 13:54:06	Ycros	or does it
2016-09-21 13:54:10	MSHMTX	I could prob make it im gonna try

2016-09-21 13:55:43	Ycros	lol
2016-09-21 13:55:47	_Hex_	so it's easier to just re-do some sounds
2016-09-21 13:55:53	_Hex_	i often replace kicks/snares/claps
2016-09-21 13:55:57	_Hex_	in fact..nearly always
2016-09-21 13:57:00	Ycros	there's been this youtuber collaboration alliance thing going on recently, and mr. bill just posted a video.. where he was supposed to just mix and finalise the track... but there's 8 hours of footage and he's basically written a new track

2016-09-21 14:54:46	_Hex_	which part in particular
2016-09-21 14:54:56	_Hex_	it's actually not worlds away from the version i have to mathc
2016-09-21 14:55:02	_Hex_	it's all pitched down from the actual original
2016-09-21 14:56:23	kerrang	well the vocals for sure, i think it's just too washed out and get a sharp resonance when vocalist tries to be loud

2016-09-21 14:59:57	kerrang	even then
2016-09-21 15:00:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'd probably have guess like 70-80...

2016-09-21 15:02:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	if you're good about managing automation, you can work 'single-track' like just fine
2016-09-21 15:02:47	kerrang	really? it makes sense to me for recorded instruments, but on electronic tracks i imagine there being different synths per section
2016-09-21 15:02:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	but most DAWs are shit or annoying
2016-09-21 15:02:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	for handling automation
2016-09-21 15:03:26	kerrang	true, that's something i've told myself to try but usually can dude to lack of cpu power
2016-09-21 15:03:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: you can automate anything in modern synths...
2016-09-21 15:03:38	kerrang	so i usually have to restrict myself to a single track for a synth

2016-09-21 15:06:31	kerrang	for me, i think it's also a composition thing. i get too stuck on one idea instead of trying new melodies on the same synth
2016-09-21 15:07:20	kerrang	then i end up with a track that has the same pad for 8 minutes with little to no changes ;)

2016-09-21 15:30:53	_Hex_	and landlords basically do fixed term leases
2016-09-21 15:31:01	_Hex_	so at the end of your lease (a year) they kick you
2016-09-21 15:31:06	_Hex_	which in reality means you can stay

2016-09-21 15:31:23	senses	i have a dog, so i'm limited to actual houses. he needs a backyard even though he's an inside dog. also, can't stand having neighbors -so- close by.

2016-09-21 17:01:25	senses	success is also measured by what you value. success for one person is not the same as another. success doesn't have to = mone. for me, success is more about having a particular lifestyle be sustainable.

2016-09-21 17:02:47	senses	yeah
2016-09-21 17:03:01	kerrang	i believe that you shouldn't be pressured into going to college unless you want to (because you want to study a subject, or because you want that BA/BS)
2016-09-21 17:03:30	kerrang	but if you want to make a certain amount of income per year, you'll most likely need a college degree
2016-09-21 17:03:30	|aaron	yeah thats kinda my point. it really is NOT the best idea for a significant amount of people
2016-09-21 17:03:34	Ycros	do it for the riiiight reasons
2016-09-21 17:03:47	senses	especially if you're young. i went to college when i was 18 because i thought it was what i -should- do, but i ended up goofing off and blowing it because it wasn't right for me at the time. i should've just waited until i was older, when i knew what i wanted to do.
2016-09-21 17:03:57	|aaron	i guess. if you want to make real money in america you need to go into business for yourself, and a degree is an obstacle to that

2016-09-21 17:43:55	senses	ok, figured there would be. can't picture how big it would be though.
2016-09-21 17:43:56	Ycros	yeah you could, though in practice people tend to go mm, cm, m
2016-09-21 17:44:02	Kimryd	10 cm
2016-09-21 17:44:08	Ycros	yeah

2016-09-21 17:44:45	Ycros	I think generally cm is used for people's height

2016-09-21 17:56:00	_Hex_	the tldr; would be you can mix to a "0" average on a k-12 meter
2016-09-21 17:56:09	_Hex_	if peaks go above that..your material is too dynamic
2016-09-21 17:56:16	Ycros	it's really about relative volumes and maximising the use of faders and such. And uh, being careful around some plugins which expect a certain incoming level
2016-09-21 17:56:17	DylanT	Yeah cause peak metering is different than the average and vu
2016-09-21 17:56:26	_Hex_	if there is minimal peak information then your material isn't dynamic enough

2016-09-21 18:05:02	DylanT	Ok, so what are 'stems'?
2016-09-21 18:05:19	DylanT	And why do producers bounce them
2016-09-21 18:05:38	Ycros	it's a multi-track rendering of your project
2016-09-21 18:05:46	Saint_Is_	its not a stem until it has been bounced (per track)
2016-09-21 18:05:49	Ycros	they're bounced to audio because peolpe use different daws, plugins
2016-09-21 18:05:56	DylanT	Ah
2016-09-21 18:06:24	senses	helpful for sending to someone else to remix or for live performance.

2016-09-21 18:06:51	DylanT	ah
2016-09-21 18:06:54	Ycros	yeah. You might also choose to group or bus certain tracks and render out a particular set of stems
2016-09-21 18:07:12	Ycros	like if you're doing a live performance, you might want to think about which elements you'd like to mix and combine from different projects, and it what ways
2016-09-21 18:07:21	Ycros	and render out a number of stems to conform to that
2016-09-21 18:07:47	DylanT	cool
2016-09-21 18:07:54	kerrang	related, do people just renders from master to include sends in stems?
2016-09-21 18:08:37	Ycros	kerrang: you bounce out the sends
2016-09-21 18:08:41	Ycros	or the returns rather
2016-09-21 18:09:34	DylanT	sends,returns is foreign language to me xD
2016-09-21 18:09:40	DylanT	Anyway
2016-09-21 18:10:27	_Hex_	the send/return config basically takes a split of the signal (where in the chain depends on the DAW) and the "return" is where it appears
2016-09-21 18:10:29	kerrang	eh, don't see how boucing a return would work when multiple tracks use a send track
2016-09-21 18:10:36	_Hex_	so rather than inserting a reverb on 10 drum tracks
2016-09-21 18:10:42	XMPPwocky	fml... jamming out in renoise and it crashes
2016-09-21 18:10:44	_Hex_	you can create a reverb "return"

2016-09-22 00:23:54	kerrang	[04:10:29] eh, don't see how boucing a return would work when multiple tracks use a send track [04:10:29]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	_Hex_	[04:10:36] so rather than inserting a reverb on 10 drum tracks [04:10:36]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	XMPPwocky	[04:10:42] fml... jamming out in renoise and it crashes [04:10:42]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	_Hex_	[04:10:44] you can create a reverb "return" [04:10:44]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	XMPPwocky	[04:10:49] since when does renoise crash [04:10:49]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	_Hex_	[04:10:50] and send splits from all those drums to that reverb [04:10:50]

2016-09-22 00:23:54	DylanT	[04:27:39] Hmm [04:27:39]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	DylanT	[04:27:47] Theres no VU metering effect on Ableton is  there? [04:27:47]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	DylanT	[04:27:55] Or how do I check [04:27:55]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	_Hex_	[04:28:40] The Meter shows both peak and RMS output levels for the track. While monitoring, however, it shows peak and RMS input levels. Peak meters show sudden changes in level, while RMS meters give a better impression of perceived loudness. [04:28:40]

2016-09-22 06:52:03	_Hex_	i like the look of that studio
2016-09-22 06:53:00	Kadabra	Are those all touch screens
2016-09-22 06:53:19	_Hex_	yeah
2016-09-22 06:53:24	_Hex_	i'd prefer faders actually
2016-09-22 06:53:28	_Hex_	but i like the nice and clean look
2016-09-22 06:54:06	bongofury	nice look
2016-09-22 06:54:18	bongofury	i too prefer mechanical faders
2016-09-22 06:54:27	bongofury	i guess those are trimpots on the table?
2016-09-22 06:54:47	_Hex_	i think that's his monitoring station
2016-09-22 06:59:54	bongofury	had to look up "Ney-Fi"
2016-09-22 07:01:27	_Hex_	does your DAW support eucon?
2016-09-22 07:02:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	I actually just got in to pro tools|control 3 days ago
2016-09-22 07:02:32	_Hex_	it's pretty awesome
2016-09-22 07:02:36	_Hex_	although i don't have an ipad
2016-09-22 07:02:37	AdmiralBumbleBee	fairly interesting how much of a better app that is than cubase IC
2016-09-22 07:02:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	or DP's contrlo app
2016-09-22 07:02:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	like way better
2016-09-22 07:02:46	_Hex_	oh completely
2016-09-22 07:02:47	_Hex_	although
2016-09-22 07:02:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	and it's better than v-contrl, which I was using before
2016-09-22 07:03:01	_Hex_	i was amazed at the android "app" steinberg abandoned
2016-09-22 07:03:22	bongofury	jesus christ the police in the US are out of fuckin control
2016-09-22 07:03:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	was there a different one than cubase IC?
2016-09-22 07:03:28	bongofury	oops wrong #
2016-09-22 07:03:30	_Hex_	there was cubase IC pro
2016-09-22 07:03:33	_Hex_	for android
2016-09-22 07:03:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	yeah ic pro
2016-09-22 07:03:38	_Hex_	but it ran in the browser
2016-09-22 07:03:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	bought that... feel kinda ripped off.
2016-09-22 07:03:46	_Hex_	i was testing a beta
2016-09-22 07:03:50	_Hex_	which was actually pretty amazing
2016-09-22 07:03:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's missing so much stuff that'd be useful to me
2016-09-22 07:04:06	_Hex_	but i guess due to the variety of android devices it was deemed too unreliable
2016-09-22 07:04:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	input assignments, routing assignments, plugin control
2016-09-22 07:04:19	_Hex_	the version i was testing basically had everything you could want

2016-09-22 07:05:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	because last ic pro update was july, and I'd be confused if they didn't port that stuff to ios
2016-09-22 07:05:02	_Hex_	it was never pushed to public
2016-09-22 07:05:18	_Hex_	i guess they went back to the drawing board with some stuff

2016-09-22 07:05:37	_Hex_	sure it was 1/2 finished

2016-09-22 07:05:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	steinberg has some very talented people working for them
2016-09-22 07:06:26	_Hex_	yeah..i guess they have a research dept who push the results of their efforts to the test team for feedback..stuff that's been in the pipeline for 5+ years
2016-09-22 07:06:32	_Hex_	and still not ready for prime time

2016-09-22 16:21:57	_Hex_	what would be a practical purpose of using a gate?
2016-09-22 16:22:29	_Hex_	it's letting signal through above a certain threshold..below that threshold it is closing the gate
2016-09-22 16:22:42	_Hex_	for practical purposes well..there are tons of uses
2016-09-22 16:23:06	_Hex_	one easy one is if you have a live recording of a drum kit..you can set the gate to only open on the hits you want and reduce the bleed elsewhere
2016-09-22 16:23:29	_Hex_	want a pulsing synth?  you can take a pad, send a hi-hat pattern to the side-chain of the gate and now your pad pulses

2016-09-23 08:05:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	there does need to be some sort of 'pushing the limits' in some way to be recognized by the community

2016-09-23 09:00:10	Nahck	those lifeforms things are so ugly :C
2016-09-23 09:00:31	Saint_Isidore	SO I had my singer come over last night and did some vocal recording last night. The recording came out great but with her vocal dynamics every once in awhile the meter barely clipped. Whats the best way to solve for that? You guys aren't adjusting the mic input while the singer is singing are you? Do I lower the volume so at the singers loudest the meter doesn't clip?
2016-09-23 09:01:31	_Hex_	you should be recording so you're hovering around 0VU
2016-09-23 09:01:41	Saint_Isidore	hi _Hex_
2016-09-23 09:01:59	_Hex_	and in the digital world that should give you (depending on how your equipment is calibrated) 18dB for any overshoots
2016-09-23 09:02:00	adq	how about calibration before
2016-09-23 09:02:11	_Hex_	which are unlikely to happen with that amount of headroom
2016-09-23 09:02:14	Nahck	but that midi keyboard looks nice, i need something like that
2016-09-23 09:02:15	_Hex_	make sure you're recording at 24bit too
2016-09-23 09:02:25	_Hex_	and also..it's completely common to adjust mic gain
2016-09-23 09:02:30	_Hex_	in input stage
2016-09-23 09:03:40	Saint_Isidore	While adjusting the input level during the performance, are just trying to anticipate that the louder signal is coming and lower the input right before?
2016-09-23 09:04:19	Saint_Isidore	Nahck I did calibraet prior and though I was right on the money, but teh singer ended up singing louder at certain spots that I was not expecting
2016-09-23 09:04:33	_Hex_	what level are you recording at?
2016-09-23 09:04:34	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: what is 'right on the money'
2016-09-23 09:04:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: and do you have any VU meters around? even a soft one will work early on
2016-09-23 09:04:50	Saint_Isidore	AdmiralBumbleBee I mean close to just under 0db
2016-09-23 09:04:54	_Hex_	0dB FS?
2016-09-23 09:04:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: that's bad.
2016-09-23 09:05:00	Saint_Isidore	oh?
2016-09-23 09:05:05	Saint_Isidore	crap what shoudl it be at
2016-09-23 09:05:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	what _Hex_  said above
2016-09-23 09:05:12	_Hex_	what meter were you looking at?
2016-09-23 09:05:14	_Hex_	a peak meter?
2016-09-23 09:05:18	_Hex_	or a vu meter?
2016-09-23 09:05:52	AdmiralBumbleBee	quite certain he's just using the peak meter in the logic channel strip
2016-09-23 09:06:00	_Hex_	in that case..that'll be a peak meter
2016-09-23 09:06:02	Saint_Isidore	yea that one
2016-09-23 09:06:04	_Hex_	so yeah..fucked

2016-09-23 09:07:05	Saint_Isidore	hehehe well last night was just a last minute recording and used an maudio USB mic
2016-09-23 09:07:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	a 16-bit mic
2016-09-23 09:07:35	Saint_Isidore	I was actually surprised how well it recorded..just in my office/room
2016-09-23 09:07:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: so... just think about this for a minute
2016-09-23 09:07:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: your mic has _at minimum_ a noise floor of -96db right?
2016-09-23 09:08:05	Saint_Isidore	not sure what  noise floor is?
2016-09-23 09:08:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	ay caramba

2016-09-23 09:08:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: with a 16-bit signal, it will be just under -96dbFS.
2016-09-23 09:09:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	you can't have any audible signal lower than that (ignoring dither... that's another can of worms)
2016-09-23 09:09:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	your 24-bit integer signal has a noise floor around -144.4db
2016-09-23 09:09:56	Saint_Isidore	so is it like the mics ability to record low end sound is up to -96dbFS?
2016-09-23 09:10:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: uh... low-amplitude, sorta.
2016-09-23 09:10:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	let's just say yes.
2016-09-23 09:10:24	_Hex_	no..he'll associate low end with bass
2016-09-23 09:10:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	the answer isn't yes, but that's good enough of an understanding for now
2016-09-23 09:10:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	low-amplitude, not low-end
2016-09-23 09:10:35	Saint_Isidore	ok
2016-09-23 09:10:36	_Hex_	low amplitude
2016-09-23 09:10:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	definitely
2016-09-23 09:11:12	Saint_Isidore	so amplitube is like volume?

2016-09-23 09:12:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	uh, no

2016-09-23 09:12:20	Saint_Isidore	no shit?
2016-09-23 09:12:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	always
2016-09-23 09:12:34	AdmiralBumbleBee	you said always... you're not always turning up stuff
2016-09-23 09:12:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	but for now, sure.
2016-09-23 09:12:44	Saint_Isidore	I mean the mic level
2016-09-23 09:12:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	let's jsut assume a simple gain
2016-09-23 09:12:49	Saint_Isidore	ok
2016-09-23 09:12:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	turns up everything
2016-09-23 09:13:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	linearly, for this discussion (which isn't the actual case... but simplifying again)
2016-09-23 09:13:18	Nahck	Kimryd: i think pittsburgh stuff sounds a bit dull and soulless. i've got the synth box and it's a cool thing to have because it packs so many things in it, but as a synth voice alone, super dull
2016-09-23 09:13:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: so why are you trying to get your signal as close to 0dbFS as possible?
2016-09-23 09:13:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: what do you think that you're acheiving?

2016-09-23 09:14:37	Saint_Isidore	AdmiralBumbleBee  well i know you don't want to go over 0db and when she was singing her volume was a bit low, so I turned mics input to make it louder and It was gettine me closer to the 0db mark
2016-09-23 09:14:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: why does it 'being low' matter?
2016-09-23 09:15:06	Saint_Isidore	I wanted to here it louder in the headphone mix
2016-09-23 09:15:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	why can't you just turn it up with a fader or trim plugin?
2016-09-23 09:15:15	Saint_Isidore	and the output was all up
2016-09-23 09:15:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	what's wrong with that do you think?
2016-09-23 09:15:49	Saint_Isidore	Never heard of a trim plug in LOL
2016-09-23 09:15:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	ok
2016-09-23 09:16:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	I started this whole line of discussion assuming you had a _bit_ more knowledge that this
2016-09-23 09:16:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	so
2016-09-23 09:16:14	Saint_Isidore	Sorry, trying to learn
2016-09-23 09:16:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	got it
2016-09-23 09:16:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: so generally, MOST folks... are trying to avoid bringing up the noise-floor of their signal.
2016-09-23 09:16:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: with a 24-bit signal, if you add 20db of gain... your noise floor whent from -144dbFS so -124dbFS
2016-09-23 09:16:52	AdmiralBumbleBee	make sense so far?
2016-09-23 09:17:18	Saint_Isidore	1 sec AdmiralBumbleBee
2016-09-23 09:18:12	Saint_Isidore	ok so can noise floor be like like that hum you get from a home studio?
2016-09-23 09:18:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	that would contribute somewhat
2016-09-23 09:18:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	a hum is frequency specific though usually
2016-09-23 09:18:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	think of that low-level hiss that you'd hear if you added 100db of gain to a track
2016-09-23 09:18:59	AdmiralBumbleBee	or when you turn up your stereo with nothing on, and you just hear hiss
2016-09-23 09:19:14	Saint_Isidore	oh so by raising the peak meter close to 0db your adding a lot more floor noise?

2016-09-23 09:19:51	Saint_Isidore	so that hiss you hear from just having the mic on?
2016-09-23 09:19:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	sometimes.
2016-09-23 09:20:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: you have a input signal with a -96db, minimum, noise floor in a -144dbFS package here.
2016-09-23 09:20:44	Saint_Isidore	what do you mean by packager AdmiralBumbleBee
2016-09-23 09:20:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	if your mic signal is right at 0db... the noise floor is at -96db, no matter what.
2016-09-23 09:20:47	Saint_Isidore	package
2016-09-23 09:20:54	Saint_Isidore	ok I got that!
2016-09-23 09:20:56	Saint_Isidore	:)
2016-09-23 09:21:05	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: your 16-bit signal is being put in to a 24-bit audio stream (eventually 32-bit floating)
2016-09-23 09:21:07	Saint_Isidore	so 0db means noise floor at 96db
2016-09-23 09:21:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: so what if you turn down the input signal 20db?
2016-09-23 09:21:49	Saint_Isidore	your noise floor drops too?
2016-09-23 09:21:55	Saint_Isidore	by 20db
2016-09-23 09:21:59	AdmiralBumbleBee	from the mic, yes
2016-09-23 09:22:05	Saint_Isidore	so noise floor of 76db
2016-09-23 09:22:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	but
2016-09-23 09:22:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	no
2016-09-23 09:22:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	-20 + -96
2016-09-23 09:22:33	Saint_Isidore	-116db
2016-09-23 09:22:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	yes

2016-09-23 09:22:44	Saint_Isidore	which is good right?
2016-09-23 09:22:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	but... our goal is not a lower noise floor.
2016-09-23 09:22:50	Saint_Isidore	fuck
2016-09-23 09:22:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	but if you notice...
2016-09-23 09:23:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	we're still well above that -144dbFS absolute noise floor of the format
2016-09-23 09:23:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	we could drop that input signal by 48db before we're in danger of _adding_ noise
2016-09-23 09:23:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	so you could record at -48db input, ADD back 48db of gain
2016-09-23 09:23:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	and you're still notadding any noise
2016-09-23 09:24:19	Saint_Isidore	can you explain the -144dbFS absolute noise floor again
2016-09-23 09:24:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: yes

2016-09-23 09:24:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: in a 24-bit format, the digital noise floor is ~-144dbFS
2016-09-23 09:25:05	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: so if you took a totally empty 24-bit file and added 144db of gain, you would end up with 0dbFS peaking noise.
2016-09-23 09:25:19	Saint_Isidore	which is fine correct?
2016-09-23 09:25:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	do you want noise?
2016-09-23 09:25:32	Saint_Isidore	not at all
2016-09-23 09:25:40	AdmiralBumbleBee	k
2016-09-23 09:25:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	so the point of all this
2016-09-23 09:25:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	is that you can have your input signal coming in quite low
2016-09-23 09:25:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	and adjust it digitally
2016-09-23 09:26:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	without any quality loss
2016-09-23 09:26:18	Saint_Isidore	like with a compressor perhaps?

2016-09-23 09:26:26	Saint_Isidore	awe ok!

2016-09-23 09:27:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: a lot of plug-ins are programmed to work with signal in a specific range

2016-09-23 09:27:50	Saint_Isidore	gotcha

2016-09-23 09:31:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: the takeaway is... you can have your signal pretty damn low, and add a good bit of makeup gain without issue.
2016-09-23 09:32:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: and you'll also get along with a large portin of plugins better
2016-09-23 09:32:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: and you'll avoid clipping.

2016-09-23 10:24:00	djdementia	i was just going to mention one of motu's strong points is it's Windows driver
2016-09-23 10:24:03	subsignal	yea Saint_Isidore those are pretty good
2016-09-23 10:24:04	djdementia	but that doesn't matter much to you ;)
2016-09-23 10:24:31	Saint_Isidore	Seems to work fine on my mac :)
2016-09-23 10:24:52	djdementia	oh yeah it works great on a mac too - i was just saying the windows drivers are what set MOTU aside from most other manufacturers
2016-09-23 10:24:54	Saint_Isidore	just smells like weed...bought it from a guy going to burning man
2016-09-23 10:24:58	subsignal	yea i rocks motu mk3 x3 at home no problems with mac or windows
2016-09-23 10:25:12	Saint_Isidore	sweet subsignal  djdementia   :)
2016-09-23 10:25:23	djdementia	MOTU supports WaveRT, one of the very few audio interfaces that support that

2016-09-23 10:26:13	Saint_Isidore	great
2016-09-23 10:26:45	djdementia	I want  a IIc though. it'd be nice to have an audio interface that works with android and iOS
2016-09-23 10:26:49	Saint_Isidore	What did you add _Hex_
2016-09-23 10:26:54	djdementia	the MOTU IIc works on both

2016-09-23 10:27:07	Saint_Isidore	:(
2016-09-23 10:27:11	_Hex_	but umm..just went far more with the body of things
2016-09-23 10:27:12	Saint_Isidore	awe
2016-09-23 10:27:21	_Hex_	to make her "warmer" and "fuller"
2016-09-23 10:27:28	subsignal	sounds noice on laptop
2016-09-23 10:27:30	_Hex_	and conversely took a shitload of crap out of your instrumental
2016-09-23 10:27:41	_Hex_	so the vocal isn't fighting in the same range
2016-09-23 10:27:41		[10:27]
2016-09-23 10:27:48	Saint_Isidore	with eq?
2016-09-23 10:27:54	_Hex_	eq on the instrumetal
2016-09-23 10:27:59	Saint_Isidore	nice!
2016-09-23 10:28:02	_Hex_	but the voacl was multiple layers of compression..some decapitator

2016-09-23 10:28:12	subsignal	mmm
2016-09-23 10:28:14	_Hex_	using the mic pre to drive things
2016-09-23 10:28:29	_Hex_	but far more effort than i would normally do to a vocal
2016-09-23 10:28:40	_Hex_	which is mic technique, recording level, and the mic
2016-09-23 10:28:50	_Hex_	ideally you shouldn't have to do shit..touch of compression..little eq ..maybe
2016-09-23 10:28:51	_Hex_	and that's it
2016-09-23 10:29:02	Saint_Isidore	oh wow
2016-09-23 10:29:04	_Hex_	anyway..sounds okay for your $100 or whatever mic
2016-09-23 10:29:18	_Hex_	bit boomy in the low mids
2016-09-23 10:29:20	_Hex_	but whatever
2016-09-23 10:29:21	_Hex_	5 mins
2016-09-23 10:29:23	Saint_Isidore	I think you can buy it for 60.00 some places LOL
2016-09-23 10:29:23	_Hex_	who gives a shit
2016-09-23 10:29:51	Saint_Isidore	I do, gonna use it for a 30 second promo video  :)

2016-09-23 10:30:06	_Hex_	you can do that comparison in terms of the body

2016-09-23 10:30:19	_Hex_	those snaps are horrible in the instrumental
2016-09-23 10:30:29	_Hex_	really sharp spike which steps on the vocal range
2016-09-23 10:30:37	Saint_Isidore	gotcha
2016-09-23 10:30:54	_Hex_	and to me..i want her to wrap around my ears in a warm blacket
2016-09-23 10:30:59	_Hex_	glass of whisky
2016-09-23 10:31:02	_Hex_	dark bar
2016-09-23 10:31:29	Saint_Isidore	Definately sounds fuller and warmer
2016-09-23 10:31:44	Saint_Isidore	now...do I buy the slate or save the money and buy the bluebird
2016-09-23 10:32:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: I think you have your ideas reversed there
2016-09-23 10:32:31	Saint_Isidore	?
2016-09-23 10:32:37	_Hex_	slate gives you access to a mic locker which would cost 10s of thousands
2016-09-23 10:32:51	_Hex_	i'd personally save money and buy slate
2016-09-23 10:32:57	Nahck	mic locker wut
2016-09-23 10:33:08	Saint_Isidore	seriously? that many different mic emulations?
2016-09-23 10:33:30	Saint_Isidore	and I don't need another pre amp either right?

2016-09-23 10:34:28	bongofury	no
2016-09-23 10:34:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: if it was even 10% of getting there to 1 mic
2016-09-23 10:34:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: you're still getting your money's worth.
2016-09-23 10:34:48	Saint_Isidore	I mean there has to be a hardware difference right, I mean it can sound just like it?
2016-09-23 10:35:12	_Hex_	read the reviews
2016-09-23 10:35:17	Saint_Isidore	I wonder if they ever go on sale LOL
2016-09-23 10:35:20	_Hex_	you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference
2016-09-23 10:35:25	_Hex_	and it's only $1k
2016-09-23 10:35:32	_Hex_	that shit should be quadruple
2016-09-23 10:35:42	bongofury	yeahno
2016-09-23 10:35:46	_Hex_	yeahno what
2016-09-23 10:36:02	bongofury	well if you have a fabulous reference mic, why color it
2016-09-23 10:36:11	_Hex_	...
2016-09-23 10:36:14	bongofury	thats like instagram filtering your wedding photos or something like that

2016-09-23 10:36:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	ever
2016-09-23 10:36:43	bongofury	no, quite the opposite
2016-09-23 10:36:59	bongofury	i just dont understand the principle of trying to emulate a mic
2016-09-23 10:37:12	_Hex_	that's okay
2016-09-23 10:37:14	_Hex_	other people get it
2016-09-23 10:37:48	AdmiralBumbleBee	bongofury: because sometimes you want a specific sound for a specific source
2016-09-23 10:37:51	_Hex_	this isn't some bullshit like antares mic modeller
2016-09-23 10:38:07	bongofury	k
2016-09-23 10:39:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	there's a lot to be said for "Oh, if I do X, I'll get Y sound"
2016-09-23 10:39:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	if X is just selecting a preset on a mic model, and youg et exactly what you want
2016-09-23 10:39:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	then that's pretty damn useful
2016-09-23 10:39:35	Saint_Isidore	Does anyone here own the slate?
2016-09-23 10:41:27	Saint_Isidore	I'm seriously this close to buy it  ||

2016-09-23 10:42:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	bongofury: same. I'm not interested in VMS at all really

2016-09-23 10:57:32	_Hex_	Saint_Isidore: go try VMR if you can
2016-09-23 10:57:39	_Hex_	they are adding more mic models to it too
2016-09-23 10:57:48	_Hex_	so with a software update you get more emulations
2016-09-23 10:58:01	Saint_Isidore	so if I buy the slate do I get vmr? or not
2016-09-23 10:58:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	fairly certain you don't get VMR
2016-09-23 10:59:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	but you do get all the modules for the mic thing, and pres
2016-09-23 10:59:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	which works in the slate rack system
2016-09-23 10:59:39	_Hex_	you get VMS
2016-09-23 10:59:55	_Hex_	VMR is free btw
2016-09-23 11:00:00	_Hex_	you just pay for the modules
2016-09-23 11:00:04	_Hex_	and some modules are also free
2016-09-23 11:00:09	_Hex_	but you'll get a VMS license
2016-09-23 11:00:13	Saint_Isidore	Any recomendation as to where to buy?
2016-09-23 11:00:16	_Hex_	which loads those VMS modules into VMR
2016-09-23 11:00:33	Saint_Isidore	You think this mic will last a lifetime?
2016-09-23 11:00:52	_Hex_	honestly...no
2016-09-23 11:00:53	Saint_Isidore	mainly wanted for vocal and acoustic guitar recordings
2016-09-23 11:00:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	_Hex_: the whole VMR thing is confusing, because they sell a product called 'VMR'
2016-09-23 11:00:55	Saint_Isidore	damn
2016-09-23 11:00:56	_Hex_	but for what you get
2016-09-23 11:01:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	even though you can get revival and monster and trimmer in VMR for free
2016-09-23 11:01:06	_Hex_	i mean..no mic lasts a lifetime
2016-09-23 11:01:08	_Hex_	not in that price range
2016-09-23 11:01:24	_Hex_	unless it's an sm57

2016-09-23 11:01:52	bongofury	sm57 only sounds like an sm57

2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[20:59:38] you get VMS [20:59:38]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[20:59:54] VMR is free btw [20:59:54]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[20:59:59] you just pay for the modules [20:59:59]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:00:03] and some modules are also free [21:00:03]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:00:08] but you'll get a VMS license [21:00:08]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	Saint_Isidore	[21:00:12] Any recomendation as to where to buy? [21:00:12]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:00:15] which loads those VMS modules into VMR [21:00:15]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	Saint_Isidore	[21:00:32] You think this mic will last a lifetime? [21:00:32]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:00:51] honestly...no [21:00:51]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	Saint_Isidore	[21:00:52] mainly wanted for vocal and acoustic guitar recordings [21:00:52]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:00:54] _Hex_: the whole VMR thing is confusing, because they sell a product called 'VMR' [21:00:54]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	Saint_Isidore	[21:00:54] damn [21:00:54]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:00:55] but for what you get [21:00:55]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:01:05] even though you can get revival and monster and trimmer in VMR for free [21:01:05]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:01:05] i mean..no mic lasts a lifetime [21:01:05]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:01:07] not in that price range [21:01:07]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:01:23] unless it's an sm57 [21:01:23]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:01:28] in which case it'll outlive humanity [21:01:28]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	bongofury	[21:01:31] when did people start adding an "s" to "bus" [21:01:31]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	Saint_Isidore	[21:01:40] then I'll just buy a sm57 :P [21:01:40]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	bongofury	[21:01:51] sm57 only sounds like an sm57 [21:01:51]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:01:53] however..as i said..if it was me buying mics today [21:01:53]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:01:57] i'd buy vms no question [21:01:57]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:02:37] you also have the luxury of auditioning different "mics" on the vocalist [21:02:37]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	Saint_Isidore	[21:02:43] I want to record and album with my singer and want to eventually be able to product it myself. Thinking the slate will meet my needs [21:02:43]

2016-09-23 12:21:02	Saint_Isidore	[21:23:58] So what happens if you plug in another microphone into the xlr going to the slate pre-amp..would still sort work? [21:23:58]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	_Hex_	[21:27:44] yeah..it's just a pre [21:27:44]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	Saint_Isidore	[21:28:16] so Are you really paying for the mic, pre or software. Just curious [21:28:16]

2016-09-23 16:04:35	Saint_Isidore	just curious have you ever messed with motu's cuemix fx
2016-09-23 16:06:37	AdmiralBumbleBee	yep
2016-09-23 16:06:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	but I don't have a motu dvecie hooked up righ tnow
2016-09-23 16:07:50	Saint_Isidore	I'm trying to figure my audio interface out, or really the cuemix fx software. Right now I just want to use it with logic
2016-09-23 16:08:27	Saint_Isidore	I have a single mic hooked up to a dn not matter what setting I use in logic I hear the mic monitoring coming through my speakers
2016-09-23 16:09:08	Saint_Isidore	Do I need to mute all teh track in the cuemix software. I muted them all and then logic will behave as expected with the mic monitoring
2016-09-23 16:09:14	Saint_Isidore	but is that correct?

2016-09-23 16:19:23	Saint_Isidore	oh ok
2016-09-23 16:20:12	Saint_Isidore	do you unmute the cuemix stuff if your using the ultrlite for a live performance?
2016-09-23 16:20:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	depends on how low you can get your beffers
2016-09-23 16:21:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	if your buffers are 128 or less, you can probably survive always going through logic
2016-09-23 16:21:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	without any issue
2016-09-23 16:21:28	bongofury	Gaytency
2016-09-23 16:21:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	bongofury: latent homosexuality
2016-09-23 16:21:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	aka gaytency
2016-09-23 16:22:04	Saint_Isidore	so you can have LPX at a live show with the ultrlite and run right to the mains?
2016-09-23 16:22:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: yes
2016-09-23 16:22:10	Saint_Isidore	and use the effects in LPX
2016-09-23 16:22:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	correct
2016-09-23 16:22:14	Saint_Isidore	how cool!
2016-09-23 16:22:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: however, mainstage is more appropriate for that
2016-09-23 16:22:21	AdmiralBumbleBee	in terms of UX
2016-09-23 16:22:56	Saint_Isidore	never heard of mainstage
2016-09-23 16:23:18	Saint_Isidore	holy crap!!! main stage is awesome
2016-09-23 16:23:30	Saint_Isidore	can I use it with my ultrlite for seperate mixes?
2016-09-23 16:23:34	AdmiralBumbleBee	yes
2016-09-23 16:23:41	Saint_Isidore	OMG OMG!
2016-09-23 16:24:03	Saint_Isidore	buyign it righ tnow
2016-09-23 16:26:55	Saint_Isidore	Can mainstage run sequences?
2016-09-23 16:28:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	not really, no
2016-09-23 16:28:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	you could load a long wave file in to the sampler and trigger that
2016-09-23 16:28:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	and other similar workflows
2016-09-23 16:28:44	Saint_Isidore	can it launch clips like ableton?
2016-09-23 16:29:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	not like ableton

2016-09-23 17:13:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	because I don't have access to my motu interface atm to load up cuemix
2016-09-23 17:13:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	and I really don't know it well
