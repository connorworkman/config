2016-09-16 14:59:20	Kimryd	uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
2016-09-16 14:59:22	kerrang	i'd rather not stick everything into a drum machine, but i may have no choice
2016-09-16 14:59:32	Kimryd	let me czech
2016-09-16 14:59:36	Rory_	yeah i thought you had to use slicer
2016-09-16 15:00:15	bongofury	no shit
2016-09-16 15:00:46	Kimryd	kerrang, you want to map samplers to individual keys?
2016-09-16 15:00:54	kerrang	yeah
2016-09-16 15:01:05	bongofury	:(
2016-09-16 15:01:13	bongofury	thanks for the news Kimryd
2016-09-16 15:01:17	bongofury	they're all gone
2016-09-16 15:01:17	kerrang	i was looking at the midi mapping, but can't find a way to trigger a midi note
2016-09-16 15:01:26	bongofury	1st generation is all in the dust
2016-09-16 15:01:33	bongofury	Bob, Don, Rich
2016-09-16 15:01:39	bongofury	thuper thad
2016-09-16 15:01:54	Kimryd	kerrang, try
2016-09-16 15:02:05	Kimryd	drop a sample in sampler, right click, convert to multi-sample
2016-09-16 15:02:13	Kimryd	Then edit multisample
2016-09-16 15:02:24	Kimryd	you get this https://gyazo.com/bfe0e4dbf3bd50cb3b2311d2fa69f54f

2016-09-16 15:03:31	Kimryd	Otherwise you can try a mcguyver thingy by using note filters and note receivers and shit...
2016-09-16 15:05:30	kerrang	oh so that's how you get multisample
2016-09-16 15:05:41	Kimryd	That is how you get multisamplu
2016-09-16 15:05:58	Kimryd	I've never tried to slice in bitwig
2016-09-16 15:06:05	kerrang	that would make the drum machine more managable
2016-09-16 15:06:06	Kimryd	I rarely slice to begin with
2016-09-16 15:06:27	kerrang	eh i'm not slicing, but i just wanted to group certain samples together when i could
2016-09-16 15:06:35	Kimryd	o
2016-09-16 15:06:35	kerrang	multisample basically solves that
2016-09-16 15:06:58	Kimryd	Have you figured out how exactly dafuq the polyphonic LFOs work?
2016-09-16 15:07:05	Kimryd	Like, what makes it polyphonic?
2016-09-16 15:07:16	kerrang	plfo?
2016-09-16 15:07:20	Kimryd	Yes
2016-09-16 15:07:36	kerrang	nope

2016-09-16 15:11:20	kerrang	Kimryd: I think the name makes it pretty straight forward, an lfo for each voice basically
2016-09-16 15:11:32	kerrang	simulates the sum of an lfo per note on
2016-09-16 15:11:51	kerrang	at least thats what it seems like when i play with it with fm4

2016-09-16 15:12:35		[15:12]
2016-09-16 15:13:09	Kimryd	So, if I have a 5 note chord playing, and I set PLFO > Cutoff, then, it'll magically create 5 LFOs for the duration of the notes?
2016-09-16 15:13:21	Kimryd	Because that's what I see in my head but I'm going "naaaaaaaaaaaaaaah"
2016-09-16 15:16:30	kerrang	kinda, i think
2016-09-16 15:17:08	kerrang	it makes more sense when you think of an arpeggio instead, because then the same lfo (per voice) gets added in at different times
2016-09-16 15:17:18	kerrang	so you can better visualize the interference
2016-09-16 15:18:10	kerrang	if you have a basic midi chord without any humanization then all the simulated lfos just get summed together in phase
2016-09-16 15:18:17	Kimryd	OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
2016-09-16 15:18:19	Kimryd	Got it
2016-09-16 15:18:36	Kimryd	Right, that's why it wasn't making sense. I was imagining the notes triggering at the same time
2016-09-16 15:19:27	kerrang	yeah, kinda tricky to see without any mention in the manual about it
2016-09-16 15:19:42	kerrang	bitwig manual -> 4/10
2016-09-16 15:20:07	kerrang	though tbh i haven't looked at it in a while
2016-09-16 15:21:33	Kimryd	The manual fucking sucks
2016-09-16 15:22:01	kerrang	iirc i was so happy to see that it was a well designed manual, but it's missing so much content
2016-09-16 15:22:05	kerrang	heartbreaking
2016-09-16 15:23:07	Kimryd	I want to see a section in the manual titled "Why we made an oscilloscope before implementing any kind of spectrum"
2016-09-16 15:23:18	Kimryd	"and a cowbell synth"
2016-09-16 15:23:51	kerrang	right
2016-09-16 15:24:17	kerrang	it's surprsing to me that i can't drag around my multisample region, you have to set the range
2016-09-16 15:24:38	Kimryd	I don't know anything about that stuff at all
2016-09-16 15:25:31	kerrang	ableton didn't have multisamples right? (not talking about drum pad)
2016-09-16 15:26:10	Kimryd	Sampler does
2016-09-16 15:27:01	kerrang	and it just dawned on me that i can't treat samples differently

2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:32:29] but ya i think it's the background bass sound that's the problem, the melody is fine. but the background sound is more monotonous throughout the song [09:32:29]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:32:41] which kind of overshadows the more lively melody [09:32:41]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:33:44] yeah true [09:33:44]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:33:50] i never understood basslines [09:33:50]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:34:16] like you know how a lot of song [09:34:16]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:34:24] starts out with the bass, percussion, drum along with the melody [09:34:24]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:34:36] yup [09:34:36]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:35:00] and i just start with chords [09:35:00]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:35:04] then there's a switch, silence, the bass or percussion is cut out, and we have the drop where the melody becomes the focus [09:35:04]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:35:11] with a slight increase in volume and intensity [09:35:11]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:35:36] but there still needs to be a lot of bass in the drop or it sounds empty [09:35:36]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:36:20] maybe... but what i mean is, when the song is transitioning, that's when you can make those changes to make the song more lively [09:36:20]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:36:21] and dynamic [09:36:21]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:36:24] :> [09:36:24]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:36:51] sometimes less is more, so when you do use a certain sound again in the sound, it's more meaningful [09:36:51]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:37:13] yeah i think i get you [09:37:13]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:37:34] do you reckon i should make the lead more prominent [09:37:34]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:37:49] and the bass less so [09:37:49]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:37:51] by focusing the listener's ears to different instruments [09:37:51]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:38:05] sometimes it's the melody that's in focus, sometimes it's the beefy bass, percussion, etc [09:38:05]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:38:20] heh dont know, just play around with it! [09:38:20]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:38:35] hey you're right [09:38:35]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:38:37] others can help you mroe i'm sure. i've never even used a daw. i'm looking to start myself lol [09:38:37]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:39:06] you should man [09:39:06]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:39:15] it's fun but you'll hate yourself a lot [09:39:15]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:40:21] i just started learning the piano too, but i figured i could use this time to at least get familiar with a daw's interface, etc :D [09:40:21]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:41:32] go for it [09:41:32]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:41:36] what daw you have in mind? [09:41:36]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:41:56] the popular one seems to be fl studio and ableton [09:41:56]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:42:01] so i'm mostly considering these two [09:42:01]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:42:07] i use fl [09:42:07]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:42:15] like it? :D [09:42:15]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:42:46] yeah, it's really nice. i was a bit dumb and stayed away from tutorials and so didn't really progress in anything for ages tho [09:42:46]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:42:59] balance tutorials with practice [09:42:59]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:43:26] i've used it for about exactly a year now [09:43:26]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:44:00] here's my first song for comparison https://soundcloud.com/rorymadden/attempt-3/s-HBed5 [09:44:00]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	polyvox_	[09:44:01] ^ Reverse Play by Rory Madden [Soundcloud] [09:44:01]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:44:53] basically a mix of sytrus presets and 909s [09:44:53]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:45:12] good start! [09:45:12]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:45:24] lol [09:45:24]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:45:36] can defintely tell from the second song that you've progressed through the year :) [09:45:36]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:45:38] i remember for ages i thought it was super good [09:45:38]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	Rory_	[09:45:45] hahah thanks dude [09:45:45]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:45:47] ya it's really not bad! [09:45:47]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:46:45] i hope i'll be able to make something half decent with my first song :> [09:46:45]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	therue	[09:47:05] gotta go though, be back later! [09:47:05]

2016-09-17 12:46:45	kerrang	bitwig supports linux, though i haven't tried it on that os
2016-09-17 12:48:42	kerrang	there are linux-developed daws, like aurdor but i can't remember them or what the quality is like

2016-09-17 14:33:53	spudzee	[23:52:30] is reaktor 6 worth it? [23:52:30]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[23:57:38] its worth it if you get it in Komplete [23:57:38]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	spudzee	[23:59:04] hmmm [23:59:04]

2016-09-17 14:33:53	kerrang	[00:01:18] iirc subsignal had it [00:01:18]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	kerrang	[00:01:23] someone had it [00:01:23]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:03:18] i dunno it looks really dope to me [00:03:18]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	spudzee	[00:03:25] I'm buying it [00:03:25]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:03:26] being able to use whole reaktor synths as modules [00:03:26]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:03:33] it supposedly sounds really good [00:03:33]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:03:41] and it seems so much more intuitive than Reaktor 5 [00:03:41]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:03:58] But paying for reaktor alone is a couple hundred shy of just getting Komplete 11 right? [00:03:58]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	 *	spudzee [00:04:09] grumbles [00:04:09]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	spudzee	[00:04:14] I don't really wanna spend that much [00:04:14]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	spudzee	[00:04:47] Komplete 11 is 3x as much [00:04:47]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:05:24] but so much more products [00:05:24]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:05:26] just get it than [00:05:26]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:05:27] 200 bux [00:05:27]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:05:34] well worth it still [00:05:34]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:05:35] just saying [00:05:35]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	spudzee	[00:06:09] I wonder... if I buy Komplete later will they give me a discount cause I already have Massive and Reaktor? [00:06:09]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:11:35] lol no [00:11:35]
2016-09-17 14:33:53	MSHMTX	[00:11:52] Maaaaaayyyybeee if they put on a crossgrade sale [00:11:52]
