2016-10-17 16:10:07	j25	Hey, basic question. It seems like adding an unsigned number and a signed number together works. e.g. if I have a 3-bit unsigned number 7 (111), and a 3-bit signed number -3 (101), adding them returns 4 (100) with a carry bit. Is this true? Why is it?

2016-10-17 16:30:39	okuu	What do you guys think about allowing identifiers beginning with a digit?
2016-10-17 16:31:05	okuu	When writing numeric code, I often wanted to define variables like “2h”.
2016-10-17 16:31:38	okuu	But, no, most languages don't allow it, so I had to settle for “h2”, which could be confused (in intent) with “h_2”.

2016-10-17 16:33:53	okuu	Errr, correction: read all contiguous alphanumeric characters.

2016-10-17 18:15:50	Sircle	Hi
2016-10-17 18:15:56	Sircle	Should the datetime of postgres/database used or datetime generated on serverside(java) be used. Each has its own pros and cons. 10 servers, each will have a different date time. If we go to PG side, is it possible to generate every date time (not just auto generated timestamp for each insert/update)? any others?

2016-10-17 18:27:45	soulisson	Hi, can anyone help me? My english is not great and I'm trying to learn Android dev. In the documentation, an activity is defined as "An Activity is an application component that provides a screen with which users can interact in order to do something, such as dial the phone, take a photo, ...". So is an activity a class, or the object we get when we instantiate the class?
2016-10-17 18:27:53	Sircle	_W_:  so set the time stamp from server side and sync all servers to one time stamp?

2016-10-17 21:03:35	okuu	[05:51:05] When in doubt, make your code look like Windows file paths. [05:51:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	hanshenrik	[05:51:34] that's what PHP did. no joke. [05:51:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	okuu	[05:54:29] hanshenrik: Also: “Can't be arsed providing actual documentation. Will just provide a shitty example. Hope you can make sense of it. To protect my ass against accusations that the code is shit, I'm saying that the instructions here are mere guidelines.” [05:54:29]

2016-10-18 01:34:09	Rashad	Recurrence can be solved with a "flag" for the time slot, and perhaps "exceptions" can also be used to override some recurrence for special cases.
2016-10-18 01:34:09	+vendu	vdamewood, so basically, they should be called FINNS and nothing else :P

2016-10-18 01:38:10	Rashad	Perhaps the service provider can restrict reservations to either minutes or days, then if he/she chooses days, he is to choose which days of the week then add exceptions as they arise, while for minutes you choose times of each day of the week and then do the same for exceptions.

2016-10-18 02:25:06	keller_k1nd	mvaenskae: a buffer overflow happens if you allocate some memory, but write beyond that allocated area
2016-10-18 02:25:12	dminuoso_	And the above implementation HAS CHAR_BIT 16.
2016-10-18 02:25:22	dminuoso_	Just to show its not just theoretical.
2016-10-18 02:25:37	Zeno`	vdamewood, no because somewhere else in the standard it says that short > char
2016-10-18 02:25:47	vdamewood	Zeno`: No, short >= char
2016-10-18 02:25:54	mvaenskae	keller_k1nd: so the buffer overflow happens due to reading too many chars for each string (in this case actually reading even a single char to the char* is causing a theoretical overflow, right?

2016-10-18 02:39:05	Zeno`	mvaenskae, here's something to ponder. I more robust way of using malloc, instead of using sizeof(specifictype), is to do something like....     int *mymem;  mymem = malloc(NUM_ELEMENTS * sizeof *mymem);

2016-10-18 04:44:58	mmlj4	B3nszy: come up with a file format (colon-delimited is best), or better yet use a database... MySQL, SQLite, etc.
2016-10-18 04:45:01	B3nszy	I missed the class on it and the book is confusing
2016-10-18 04:45:06	mmlj4	also, JSON works
2016-10-18 04:45:15	B3nszy	this is intro to programming

2016-10-18 04:45:52	mmlj4	you could write to /dev/null and read your data back from /dev/random
2016-10-18 04:46:02	csd_	if i say that i've implemented a messaging protocol (zmq), does that imply that i've written the library, or that i've integrated it with my application? going for the latter
2016-10-18 04:46:03	+vendu	Zeno`, hehe it's the only reason i'm using floating-point math in the kernel :P
2016-10-18 04:46:17	Zeno`	vendu, it doesn't use floating point
2016-10-18 04:46:19	+vendu	Zeno`, so i hacked together a couple of functions using i387 asm too =)
2016-10-18 04:46:23	Zeno`	err... 'cept to make the LUT
2016-10-18 04:46:27	+vendu	Zeno`, ceil() and sin() :)

2016-10-18 04:47:11	vdamewood	If I were to design a new architecture, I would make it so that floats and ints used the same registers.
2016-10-18 04:47:19	+vendu	Zeno`, great idea, we should do that later on =)

2016-10-18 10:27:16	mistralol	but i actually find its not so much the dev's. It is the leads dont give the right people the right work or the right support to people when they need it

2016-10-18 10:30:25	mistralol	true but the grad is untested in such matters

2016-10-18 10:38:13	Shayanjm	Yes, correct, but a lot of development today requires domain knowledge
2016-10-18 10:38:16	deniska	and lately it's much easier to teach chemists to write programs than chemistry to programmers

2016-10-18 10:50:17	mistralol	Dark_Fox: yeah so any devloper when faced with that basically cooks the books
2016-10-18 10:50:30	Dark_Fox	Shayanjm: Then why are you bothering with a discussion about what constitutes a good developer?
2016-10-18 10:50:39	+vendu	hello again, everyone =)
2016-10-18 10:50:40	btborg	You can look up C libraries in man, and it just works
2016-10-18 10:50:41	Dark_Fox	mistralol: Yeah, pretty much
2016-10-18 10:50:42	purplex88	sbrg: can i choose either one? i didn't find an example yet
2016-10-18 10:50:49	Shayanjm	Dark_Fox: to find out how to recruit more of them?
2016-10-18 10:51:04	Dark_Fox	mistralol: A lot of the Agile-bashing I see is based around that metric-lawyering, though
2016-10-18 10:51:04	Shayanjm	It's a very good question that should have real answers without devolving into a pissing contest
2016-10-18 10:51:07	mistralol	Dark_Fox: when i moved job I had never actually heard the term "sand bagging" before
2016-10-18 10:51:09	sbrg	purplex88: the point is, if I have two sorted lists and I merge them, it doesn't matter that one is larger than the other
2016-10-18 10:51:22	ario	i've been working on the same bug for 3 weeks now at work lol
2016-10-18 10:51:24	ario	:<

2016-10-18 10:52:09	sbrg	merge sort splits the array into pieces until it has pieces of length 1 to deal with. it merges that into an array of size 2 which is sorted. it will then eventually have two arrays that are of length 2 which are sorted, which it can also merge(because they are sorted), etc etc

2016-10-18 10:52:49	mistralol	Dark_Fox: aka when you don't have work in your current sprint and start taking from the backlog.... So the stuff ont he backlog is already done for the next sprint

2016-10-18 10:52:59	+vendu	btborg, if you wanna see some nice os code, get the lions book :)
2016-10-18 10:53:03	sbrg	normally, you just do     iMiddle = (iEnd + iBegin) / 2;              // iMiddle = mid point (copied directly from wikipedia) which is integer division, so it's rounded down
2016-10-18 10:53:09	Dark_Fox	mistralol: Ahh

2016-10-18 10:53:19	purplex88	sbrg: because of less number of comparsions?

2016-10-18 10:55:46	rindolf	sbrg: insertion sort is pretty good for small data sets.
2016-10-18 10:55:48	+vendu	in fact, let me find some of those for you =)

2016-10-18 10:56:09	mistralol	I cannot recall who asked. But yeah i think its not hard to find a good dev. So long as a company is prepared to pay
2016-10-18 10:56:14	sbrg	rindolf: yeah, there's definitely a usecase for almost all sorting algorithms. except bubble sort.

2016-10-18 11:26:29	Dark_Fox	I think some manner of programming test or technical questions are useful, just to make sure they aren't lying on the resume, but beyond that the interview should be more about good work habits and culture fit
2016-10-18 11:26:30	Rounin	My first one did sort of a pseudo one... It tested numerical comprehension and language comprehension and perhaps logic
2016-10-18 11:26:38	Dark_Fox	Wow, jeez

2016-10-18 11:27:50	Rounin	Personally I went to university
2016-10-18 11:28:01	Dark_Fox	Well, more like seeing if they arrive on time, or if not, if they give you prior notice that they'll be late.  If they have projects they're showing you, or during the programming test, if they document and layout their code in a well organized manner
2016-10-18 11:28:08	Rounin	Though I did program as a hobby before that, and I used, for instance, a book on QuickBASIC

2016-10-18 12:21:51	bizarrefish	yes, true. it's about breaking the execution of the script up so that, for example, 'isEnemyInFront' could appear as a blocking getter method to the scripting environment, but it actually ends up saving a continuation somewhere and resuming when the data is available
2016-10-18 12:23:07	bizarrefish	i guess I am talking about a narrow usage of free monads here, as simple ways to implement suspend/resume

2016-10-18 12:23:33	sbrg	so, in one scenario, when the user writes "isEnemyFront", execution is blocked on communication with some thread, while in the other, you basically have an entire AST parsed that you ship off to the execution environment which is then executed there and the results are returned once it's finished?
2016-10-18 12:25:17	sbrg	Because that doesn't sound like "free monads" specifically. that just sounds like a generic design decision that has little to do with monads or anything else. maybe i'm not getting it

2016-10-18 12:25:29	bizarrefish	i think im being unclear. in the threading approach, they would be writing in the same language as the simulator. there wouldnt be a need to parse what they write, but having it run in a separate thread would allow the main thread to control the execution
2016-10-18 12:26:15	bizarrefish	rather than if it was running in the main thread, where their code would need to reflect the control flow of the simulator
2016-10-18 12:27:07	bizarrefish	the free monad / interpreter approach would be another way of decoupling these things

2016-10-18 18:32:10	bjpenn	i guess its converting it into something that only pickle can understand
2016-10-18 18:32:16	+PlanckWalk	Yes, Python's pickling is a particular form of serialization
2016-10-18 18:32:33	curl	When information is sent over the Internet, it is generally broken up into smaller pieces or "packets". The use of packets facilitates speedy transmission since different parts of a message can be sent by different routes and then reassembled at the destination. It is also a safety measure to minimize the chances of losing information in the transmission process. TCP is the means for creating the packets, putting them back togethe
2016-10-18 18:32:57	bjpenn	i guess i dont understand why you would use pickle to create a binary when you can just output the strings into a plaintext file

In C++, input streams are objects from which you can read values using “>>”, and output streams are objects into which you can write values using “<<”. “std::cin” is just one particular example of an input stream, and “std::cout” is just one particular example of an output stream.

2016-10-18 21:40:57	dminuoso_	bjpenn: Millions of updates per second on a dataset this large will cost you, you need to be aware of this. Im guessing you're already dishing out lots of money on DynamoDB.
2016-10-18 21:40:59	bjpenn	i dont think thats cheaper than dynamodb infact
2016-10-18 21:41:10	dminuoso_	That could be a possibility.
2016-10-18 21:41:16	bjpenn	yeah
2016-10-18 21:41:27	bjpenn	im thinking commodity servers on SSDs

2016-10-18 23:55:21	Xatenev	[09:22:24] I could imagine that you can set the USB drive "copy protected" [09:22:24]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	adsc	[09:22:25] so that they could copy the program, but not really run it from somewhere else [09:22:25]

2016-10-18 23:55:21	Xatenev	[09:22:41] so you basically set the hardware "copy protected" [09:22:41]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Xatenev	[09:22:45] xD [09:22:45]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	adsc	[09:23:37] nah, if they can run it, they can read it, and if they can read it, they can copy it [09:23:37]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	LucaS05	[09:23:39] Xatenev: :D But can i run a program in that situation? I mean giving a password for running it, means giving a password for copy it [09:23:39]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Xatenev	[09:23:50] probably :| [09:23:50]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	LucaS05	[09:25:26] maybe i can start a process that could check continuosly if someone is trying to copy it (yeah, i'm lost :D) [09:25:26]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	adsc	[09:25:49] and they'd just kill that process and copy it [09:25:49]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Xatenev	[09:25:59] LucaS05: you should probably just tell the customer to rethink his requirement :P [09:25:59]

2016-10-19 00:41:21	Xatenev	[09:21:38] okay [09:21:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	LucaS05	[09:21:41] :D [09:21:41]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	LucaS05	[09:21:52] Weird request, i know [09:21:52]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	adsc	[09:22:11] maybe you could do something with server side checking [09:22:11]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	LucaS05	[09:22:21] but i was thinking that maybe i was wrong and a solution exists [09:22:21]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Xatenev	[09:22:24] I could imagine that you can set the USB drive "copy protected" [09:22:24]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	adsc	[09:22:25] so that they could copy the program, but not really run it from somewhere else [09:22:25]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Xatenev	[09:22:27] instead of the software [09:22:27]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	LucaS05	[09:22:27] adsc: what do you mean? [09:22:27]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Xatenev	[09:22:41] so you basically set the hardware "copy protected" [09:22:41]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Xatenev	[09:22:45] xD [09:22:45]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	adsc	[09:23:37] nah, if they can run it, they can read it, and if they can read it, they can copy it [09:23:37]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	LucaS05	[09:23:39] Xatenev: :D But can i run a program in that situation? I mean giving a password for running it, means giving a password for copy it [09:23:39]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Xatenev	[09:23:50] probably :| [09:23:50]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	LucaS05	[09:25:26] maybe i can start a process that could check continuosly if someone is trying to copy it (yeah, i'm lost :D) [09:25:26]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	adsc	[09:25:49] and they'd just kill that process and copy it [09:25:49]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Xatenev	[09:25:59] LucaS05: you should probably just tell the customer to rethink his requirement :P [09:25:59]

2016-10-19 01:05:29	dminuoso_	Neslepaks: readelf is basically the same as objdump (except it only works for elf)

2016-10-19 01:06:41	dminuoso_	Neslepaks: ELF files are usually produced by your systems linker.

2016-10-19 01:07:36	dminuoso_	readelf (like objdump) just lets you inspect that ELF file
2016-10-19 01:07:44	Neslepaks	Sorry, I mixed this up with something else.
2016-10-19 01:07:48	Neslepaks	Nevermind, I apologize

2016-10-19 01:08:18	GeDaMo	ELF is an executable format used on amongst others Linux
2016-10-19 01:08:30	dminuoso_	Well its specified as part of the System V ABI.
2016-10-19 01:08:32	javaisnom	Ah. I've read that file extension while reinstalling Arch,
2016-10-19 01:08:37	javaisnom	but I've never seen it on an actual file
2016-10-19 01:08:43	dminuoso_	As such any systems following the System V ABI will support ELF, Linux belongs to these systems.

Would you either build it out with a cron job to export the file to their system or would you build an API to generate that report for download and have them call that API to download the file onto their system?

2016-10-19 07:03:49	tommycannady	ah it has to do with the game guide manual

2016-10-19 07:22:40	tommycannady	generator.. I have a map editor
2016-10-19 07:22:45	tommycannady	what I do is generate maps and then edit them

2016-10-19 08:22:53	Guest61608	sbrg, well, the more bootstraping the more potential for the issue, and since a compiler is especially vital in code generation, it seems like particularly bad code to introduce bugs into.
2016-10-19 08:23:04	Guest61608	anyway
2016-10-19 08:23:07	sbrg	If the first compiler has a bug in the code-generation, it is highly unlikely that this bug shows itself by making the compiler generate buggy code. it is much more likely that the compiler just breaks

2016-10-19 08:23:49	piou	I don't think so, I see no specific issue linked to boostraping here, the issues with compilers emitting code that doesn't work are the same issues everybody has with any other program.
2016-10-19 08:24:40	Guest61608	piou, because compilers are in a unique position to negatively affect more programs than just itself?

2016-10-19 08:25:13	GeDaMo	Hi Holandoro :)
2016-10-19 08:25:16	vdamewood	If a compiler is buggy enough to emit badf code, odds are the next iteration's source will have some check for the bug, and avoid the 'feature', while using a less elegant way of getting the job done.
2016-10-19 08:25:18	Holandoro	How do i go about writing an assembler ? I've read others code but its mostly non-data driven
2016-10-19 08:25:28	piou	Guest61608: but that's true no matter where the compiler comes from. Really. If you want a bug that propagates from compiler to compiler I've never ever seen one.
2016-10-19 08:26:03	piou	Guest61608: if the code emitted isn't correct it can't magically be passed to the next one. Code generation is too complex for that, it will break before it happens.
2016-10-19 08:26:14	Holandoro	bascally, the other code I read is javascript code and it has these "slice" functions called and it seems very inefficient
2016-10-19 08:26:19	piou	Guest61608: (well, could theoretically happen but in real life that's unheard of)

2016-10-19 09:20:45	piou	maroon_: to read from a file into a buffer you need: 1) to allocate a buffer, either statically using the syntax « char buf[1024] » for example, or dynamically (meaning the length is only known when running the program) using « char* buf = malloc(1024 * sizeof(char)); ». 2) Once that memory is allocated open the file.

This is not sizeof(buffer) because that syntax means « The size of the variable buffer » and in the case of dynamic allocation this size is that of a pointer (so 4 or 8 but nothing useful to you). 3) close the file. You did that right.

2016-10-19 10:30:34	ciniglio	I believe this answer assumes that you can't resize in place, which makes sense to me (since that's not really a resize)
2016-10-19 10:30:57	moppy	But his question is about increasing the array by a FIXED size each time it's full, vs doubling the size
2016-10-19 10:31:05	chillychil	exactly
2016-10-19 10:31:17	sbrg	chillychil: Think of it like this: if you increase the size a fixed amount every time(let's say N elements), then every N'th element will trigger a resize. yes?

2016-10-19 10:31:36	ciniglio	thought you meant each insertion
2016-10-19 10:31:53	chillychil	sbrg:yes
2016-10-19 10:31:58	_W_	if you increase exponentially, the amount of previously-moved-in-resize tends towards a fixed fraction of the current size
2016-10-19 10:32:23	sbrg	however, if you double the size every time, then every time you resize, the next resize is as many insertions away as the current size of the array(before resize)

2016-10-19 10:35:03	btborg	Question about If-Else If-Else blocks
2016-10-19 10:35:05	sbrg	amortized running time is sometimes explained using "saving work". every time you double the size of the array, from N to 2N, you have "saved" N free(O(1)) insertions. this means that when the resize finally happens, you have gotten so many insertions in without doing a resize that "on average" the cost of insertion is constant time.

2016-10-19 10:36:50	chillychil	is the answer that the actual answer is that every time our array fills up, if we only increase the size by a fixed factor  Then our time cost in copying will be a summation of natural numbers times the fixed factor  This summation is n(n+1)/2

2016-10-19 11:14:30	Shayanjm	instead I think you should figure out how much your shares are worth today (pre-acquisition), and figure out what multiplier the investors are expecting on their valuation
2016-10-19 11:14:36	Shayanjm	yes it does
2016-10-19 11:14:43	Shayanjm	especially if your company has gone through multiple rounds of funding

2016-10-19 12:53:19	JX7P	so an object encapsulating a Vector of 5120 items needs only the shallow content (pointer to a vector, or the vector's internal data structure, which is a few pointers and integers if i remember right)  to be copied

2016-10-19 12:56:12	JX7P	in JX Objective-C, getting system time is extremely fast: you just ask Computer "getTheDate" and it will prepare you a Date. you spend a short time in the dispatch, as JX Objective-C has very fast message dispatch, and only a little time in allocating the Date object. so the major bottleneck is system speed

2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:09:39] Hi I have a question, For some reason in valgrind my C code when executed says invalid read of size 1 and it has something to do with a strlen, why? http://sprunge.us/cbbR?c [00:09:39]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	+PlanckWalk	[00:14:48] hoqan: Not nearly enough information [00:14:48]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:15:07] PlanckWalk: what else is needed? [00:15:07]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	+PlanckWalk	[00:15:07] Most of the variables you use there are not even declared [00:15:07]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:15:11] ah [00:15:11]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:15:25] would it not being delimited with a '\0' have anything to do with it? [00:15:25]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:15:34] i dont want to share my full code because of the coe grabbers [00:15:34]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:15:36] code [00:15:36]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	+PlanckWalk	[00:15:38] That would certainly be a complete fail, yes [00:15:38]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	+PlanckWalk	[00:15:51] strlen looks for a terminating \0 [00:15:51]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:15:56] ah [00:15:56]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	+PlanckWalk	[00:16:06] So if there isn't one, it will run off into whatever memory it can reach until it finds one [00:16:06]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:16:27] maybe thats why then [00:16:27]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:16:54] I could share my code but dont upload it anywhere [00:16:54]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	Heffree	[00:16:55] Probably, that would you give the output of invalid read of size 1 [00:16:55]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:17:20] ah [00:17:20]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	+PlanckWalk	[00:17:43] Applying strlen to something that isn't a C string is definitely wrong [00:17:43]

2016-10-19 14:34:38	elricsfate	[00:20:36] I'm interested in finding a free or open source solution for an upcoming project. [00:20:36]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:27:20] Here is more code: http://sprunge.us/hLcL?c [00:27:20]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:27:27] Im really not sure why strlen is segfaulting [00:27:27]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	elricsfate	[00:28:57] Is there a better channel to ask this than programming? [00:28:57]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	minous	[00:32:09] hoqan, so, you know for sure strlen is where the segfault happens? [00:32:09]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:32:18] it says [00:32:18]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:32:24] ==25002== Invalid read of size 1 ==25002==    at 0x4C2C1A2: strlen (vg_replace_strmem.c:412) [00:32:24]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:32:36] along with the function nest [00:32:36]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	+PlanckWalk	[00:32:57] Is s a valid C string? [00:32:57]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:33:04] yes [00:33:04]

2016-10-19 17:11:01	moppy	Then I write some dynamic java code to interpret some data at runtime and autocomplete fails :-)
2016-10-19 17:11:02	spjt	autocomplete isn't what does it for me, it's navigating to the declaration. In a 1M line codebase written by someone else, that's key

In the insert function, if the node is null, it will create a new node and return it.
