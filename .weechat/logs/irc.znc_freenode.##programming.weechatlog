2016-10-17 16:10:07	j25	Hey, basic question. It seems like adding an unsigned number and a signed number together works. e.g. if I have a 3-bit unsigned number 7 (111), and a 3-bit signed number -3 (101), adding them returns 4 (100) with a carry bit. Is this true? Why is it?

2016-10-17 16:30:39	okuu	What do you guys think about allowing identifiers beginning with a digit?
2016-10-17 16:31:05	okuu	When writing numeric code, I often wanted to define variables like “2h”.
2016-10-17 16:31:38	okuu	But, no, most languages don't allow it, so I had to settle for “h2”, which could be confused (in intent) with “h_2”.

2016-10-17 16:33:53	okuu	Errr, correction: read all contiguous alphanumeric characters.

2016-10-17 18:15:50	Sircle	Hi
2016-10-17 18:15:56	Sircle	Should the datetime of postgres/database used or datetime generated on serverside(java) be used. Each has its own pros and cons. 10 servers, each will have a different date time. If we go to PG side, is it possible to generate every date time (not just auto generated timestamp for each insert/update)? any others?

2016-10-17 18:27:45	soulisson	Hi, can anyone help me? My english is not great and I'm trying to learn Android dev. In the documentation, an activity is defined as "An Activity is an application component that provides a screen with which users can interact in order to do something, such as dial the phone, take a photo, ...". So is an activity a class, or the object we get when we instantiate the class?
2016-10-17 18:27:53	Sircle	_W_:  so set the time stamp from server side and sync all servers to one time stamp?

2016-10-17 21:03:35	okuu	[05:51:05] When in doubt, make your code look like Windows file paths. [05:51:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	hanshenrik	[05:51:34] that's what PHP did. no joke. [05:51:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	okuu	[05:54:29] hanshenrik: Also: “Can't be arsed providing actual documentation. Will just provide a shitty example. Hope you can make sense of it. To protect my ass against accusations that the code is shit, I'm saying that the instructions here are mere guidelines.” [05:54:29]

2016-10-18 01:34:09	Rashad	Recurrence can be solved with a "flag" for the time slot, and perhaps "exceptions" can also be used to override some recurrence for special cases.
2016-10-18 01:34:09	+vendu	vdamewood, so basically, they should be called FINNS and nothing else :P

2016-10-18 01:38:10	Rashad	Perhaps the service provider can restrict reservations to either minutes or days, then if he/she chooses days, he is to choose which days of the week then add exceptions as they arise, while for minutes you choose times of each day of the week and then do the same for exceptions.

2016-10-18 02:25:06	keller_k1nd	mvaenskae: a buffer overflow happens if you allocate some memory, but write beyond that allocated area
2016-10-18 02:25:12	dminuoso_	And the above implementation HAS CHAR_BIT 16.
2016-10-18 02:25:22	dminuoso_	Just to show its not just theoretical.
2016-10-18 02:25:37	Zeno`	vdamewood, no because somewhere else in the standard it says that short > char
2016-10-18 02:25:47	vdamewood	Zeno`: No, short >= char
2016-10-18 02:25:54	mvaenskae	keller_k1nd: so the buffer overflow happens due to reading too many chars for each string (in this case actually reading even a single char to the char* is causing a theoretical overflow, right?

2016-10-18 02:39:05	Zeno`	mvaenskae, here's something to ponder. I more robust way of using malloc, instead of using sizeof(specifictype), is to do something like....     int *mymem;  mymem = malloc(NUM_ELEMENTS * sizeof *mymem);

2016-10-18 04:44:58	mmlj4	B3nszy: come up with a file format (colon-delimited is best), or better yet use a database... MySQL, SQLite, etc.
2016-10-18 04:45:01	B3nszy	I missed the class on it and the book is confusing
2016-10-18 04:45:06	mmlj4	also, JSON works
2016-10-18 04:45:15	B3nszy	this is intro to programming

2016-10-18 04:45:52	mmlj4	you could write to /dev/null and read your data back from /dev/random
2016-10-18 04:46:02	csd_	if i say that i've implemented a messaging protocol (zmq), does that imply that i've written the library, or that i've integrated it with my application? going for the latter
2016-10-18 04:46:03	+vendu	Zeno`, hehe it's the only reason i'm using floating-point math in the kernel :P
2016-10-18 04:46:17	Zeno`	vendu, it doesn't use floating point
2016-10-18 04:46:19	+vendu	Zeno`, so i hacked together a couple of functions using i387 asm too =)
2016-10-18 04:46:23	Zeno`	err... 'cept to make the LUT
2016-10-18 04:46:27	+vendu	Zeno`, ceil() and sin() :)

2016-10-18 04:47:11	vdamewood	If I were to design a new architecture, I would make it so that floats and ints used the same registers.
2016-10-18 04:47:19	+vendu	Zeno`, great idea, we should do that later on =)

2016-10-18 10:27:16	mistralol	but i actually find its not so much the dev's. It is the leads dont give the right people the right work or the right support to people when they need it

2016-10-18 10:30:25	mistralol	true but the grad is untested in such matters

2016-10-18 10:38:13	Shayanjm	Yes, correct, but a lot of development today requires domain knowledge
2016-10-18 10:38:16	deniska	and lately it's much easier to teach chemists to write programs than chemistry to programmers

2016-10-18 10:50:17	mistralol	Dark_Fox: yeah so any devloper when faced with that basically cooks the books
2016-10-18 10:50:30	Dark_Fox	Shayanjm: Then why are you bothering with a discussion about what constitutes a good developer?
2016-10-18 10:50:39	+vendu	hello again, everyone =)
2016-10-18 10:50:40	btborg	You can look up C libraries in man, and it just works
2016-10-18 10:50:41	Dark_Fox	mistralol: Yeah, pretty much
2016-10-18 10:50:42	purplex88	sbrg: can i choose either one? i didn't find an example yet
2016-10-18 10:50:49	Shayanjm	Dark_Fox: to find out how to recruit more of them?
2016-10-18 10:51:04	Dark_Fox	mistralol: A lot of the Agile-bashing I see is based around that metric-lawyering, though
2016-10-18 10:51:04	Shayanjm	It's a very good question that should have real answers without devolving into a pissing contest
2016-10-18 10:51:07	mistralol	Dark_Fox: when i moved job I had never actually heard the term "sand bagging" before
2016-10-18 10:51:09	sbrg	purplex88: the point is, if I have two sorted lists and I merge them, it doesn't matter that one is larger than the other
2016-10-18 10:51:22	ario	i've been working on the same bug for 3 weeks now at work lol
2016-10-18 10:51:24	ario	:<

2016-10-18 10:52:09	sbrg	merge sort splits the array into pieces until it has pieces of length 1 to deal with. it merges that into an array of size 2 which is sorted. it will then eventually have two arrays that are of length 2 which are sorted, which it can also merge(because they are sorted), etc etc

2016-10-18 10:52:49	mistralol	Dark_Fox: aka when you don't have work in your current sprint and start taking from the backlog.... So the stuff ont he backlog is already done for the next sprint

2016-10-18 10:52:59	+vendu	btborg, if you wanna see some nice os code, get the lions book :)
2016-10-18 10:53:03	sbrg	normally, you just do     iMiddle = (iEnd + iBegin) / 2;              // iMiddle = mid point (copied directly from wikipedia) which is integer division, so it's rounded down
2016-10-18 10:53:09	Dark_Fox	mistralol: Ahh

2016-10-18 10:53:19	purplex88	sbrg: because of less number of comparsions?

2016-10-18 10:55:46	rindolf	sbrg: insertion sort is pretty good for small data sets.
2016-10-18 10:55:48	+vendu	in fact, let me find some of those for you =)

2016-10-18 10:56:09	mistralol	I cannot recall who asked. But yeah i think its not hard to find a good dev. So long as a company is prepared to pay
2016-10-18 10:56:14	sbrg	rindolf: yeah, there's definitely a usecase for almost all sorting algorithms. except bubble sort.

2016-10-18 11:26:29	Dark_Fox	I think some manner of programming test or technical questions are useful, just to make sure they aren't lying on the resume, but beyond that the interview should be more about good work habits and culture fit
2016-10-18 11:26:30	Rounin	My first one did sort of a pseudo one... It tested numerical comprehension and language comprehension and perhaps logic
2016-10-18 11:26:38	Dark_Fox	Wow, jeez

2016-10-18 11:27:50	Rounin	Personally I went to university
2016-10-18 11:28:01	Dark_Fox	Well, more like seeing if they arrive on time, or if not, if they give you prior notice that they'll be late.  If they have projects they're showing you, or during the programming test, if they document and layout their code in a well organized manner
2016-10-18 11:28:08	Rounin	Though I did program as a hobby before that, and I used, for instance, a book on QuickBASIC

2016-10-18 12:21:51	bizarrefish	yes, true. it's about breaking the execution of the script up so that, for example, 'isEnemyInFront' could appear as a blocking getter method to the scripting environment, but it actually ends up saving a continuation somewhere and resuming when the data is available
2016-10-18 12:23:07	bizarrefish	i guess I am talking about a narrow usage of free monads here, as simple ways to implement suspend/resume

2016-10-18 12:23:33	sbrg	so, in one scenario, when the user writes "isEnemyFront", execution is blocked on communication with some thread, while in the other, you basically have an entire AST parsed that you ship off to the execution environment which is then executed there and the results are returned once it's finished?
2016-10-18 12:25:17	sbrg	Because that doesn't sound like "free monads" specifically. that just sounds like a generic design decision that has little to do with monads or anything else. maybe i'm not getting it

2016-10-18 12:25:29	bizarrefish	i think im being unclear. in the threading approach, they would be writing in the same language as the simulator. there wouldnt be a need to parse what they write, but having it run in a separate thread would allow the main thread to control the execution
2016-10-18 12:26:15	bizarrefish	rather than if it was running in the main thread, where their code would need to reflect the control flow of the simulator
2016-10-18 12:27:07	bizarrefish	the free monad / interpreter approach would be another way of decoupling these things

2016-10-18 18:32:10	bjpenn	i guess its converting it into something that only pickle can understand
2016-10-18 18:32:16	+PlanckWalk	Yes, Python's pickling is a particular form of serialization
2016-10-18 18:32:33	curl	When information is sent over the Internet, it is generally broken up into smaller pieces or "packets". The use of packets facilitates speedy transmission since different parts of a message can be sent by different routes and then reassembled at the destination. It is also a safety measure to minimize the chances of losing information in the transmission process. TCP is the means for creating the packets, putting them back togethe
2016-10-18 18:32:57	bjpenn	i guess i dont understand why you would use pickle to create a binary when you can just output the strings into a plaintext file

In C++, input streams are objects from which you can read values using “>>”, and output streams are objects into which you can write values using “<<”. “std::cin” is just one particular example of an input stream, and “std::cout” is just one particular example of an output stream.

2016-10-18 21:40:57	dminuoso_	bjpenn: Millions of updates per second on a dataset this large will cost you, you need to be aware of this. Im guessing you're already dishing out lots of money on DynamoDB.
2016-10-18 21:40:59	bjpenn	i dont think thats cheaper than dynamodb infact
2016-10-18 21:41:10	dminuoso_	That could be a possibility.
2016-10-18 21:41:16	bjpenn	yeah
2016-10-18 21:41:27	bjpenn	im thinking commodity servers on SSDs

2016-10-18 23:55:21	Xatenev	[09:22:24] I could imagine that you can set the USB drive "copy protected" [09:22:24]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	adsc	[09:22:25] so that they could copy the program, but not really run it from somewhere else [09:22:25]

2016-10-18 23:55:21	Xatenev	[09:22:41] so you basically set the hardware "copy protected" [09:22:41]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Xatenev	[09:22:45] xD [09:22:45]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	adsc	[09:23:37] nah, if they can run it, they can read it, and if they can read it, they can copy it [09:23:37]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	LucaS05	[09:23:39] Xatenev: :D But can i run a program in that situation? I mean giving a password for running it, means giving a password for copy it [09:23:39]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Xatenev	[09:23:50] probably :| [09:23:50]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	LucaS05	[09:25:26] maybe i can start a process that could check continuosly if someone is trying to copy it (yeah, i'm lost :D) [09:25:26]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	adsc	[09:25:49] and they'd just kill that process and copy it [09:25:49]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Xatenev	[09:25:59] LucaS05: you should probably just tell the customer to rethink his requirement :P [09:25:59]

2016-10-19 00:41:21	Xatenev	[09:21:38] okay [09:21:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	LucaS05	[09:21:41] :D [09:21:41]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	LucaS05	[09:21:52] Weird request, i know [09:21:52]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	adsc	[09:22:11] maybe you could do something with server side checking [09:22:11]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	LucaS05	[09:22:21] but i was thinking that maybe i was wrong and a solution exists [09:22:21]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Xatenev	[09:22:24] I could imagine that you can set the USB drive "copy protected" [09:22:24]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	adsc	[09:22:25] so that they could copy the program, but not really run it from somewhere else [09:22:25]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Xatenev	[09:22:27] instead of the software [09:22:27]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	LucaS05	[09:22:27] adsc: what do you mean? [09:22:27]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Xatenev	[09:22:41] so you basically set the hardware "copy protected" [09:22:41]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Xatenev	[09:22:45] xD [09:22:45]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	adsc	[09:23:37] nah, if they can run it, they can read it, and if they can read it, they can copy it [09:23:37]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	LucaS05	[09:23:39] Xatenev: :D But can i run a program in that situation? I mean giving a password for running it, means giving a password for copy it [09:23:39]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Xatenev	[09:23:50] probably :| [09:23:50]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	LucaS05	[09:25:26] maybe i can start a process that could check continuosly if someone is trying to copy it (yeah, i'm lost :D) [09:25:26]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	adsc	[09:25:49] and they'd just kill that process and copy it [09:25:49]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Xatenev	[09:25:59] LucaS05: you should probably just tell the customer to rethink his requirement :P [09:25:59]

2016-10-19 01:05:29	dminuoso_	Neslepaks: readelf is basically the same as objdump (except it only works for elf)

2016-10-19 01:06:41	dminuoso_	Neslepaks: ELF files are usually produced by your systems linker.

2016-10-19 01:07:36	dminuoso_	readelf (like objdump) just lets you inspect that ELF file
2016-10-19 01:07:44	Neslepaks	Sorry, I mixed this up with something else.
2016-10-19 01:07:48	Neslepaks	Nevermind, I apologize

2016-10-19 01:08:18	GeDaMo	ELF is an executable format used on amongst others Linux
2016-10-19 01:08:30	dminuoso_	Well its specified as part of the System V ABI.
2016-10-19 01:08:32	javaisnom	Ah. I've read that file extension while reinstalling Arch,
2016-10-19 01:08:37	javaisnom	but I've never seen it on an actual file
2016-10-19 01:08:43	dminuoso_	As such any systems following the System V ABI will support ELF, Linux belongs to these systems.

Would you either build it out with a cron job to export the file to their system or would you build an API to generate that report for download and have them call that API to download the file onto their system?

2016-10-19 07:03:49	tommycannady	ah it has to do with the game guide manual

2016-10-19 07:22:40	tommycannady	generator.. I have a map editor
2016-10-19 07:22:45	tommycannady	what I do is generate maps and then edit them

2016-10-19 08:22:53	Guest61608	sbrg, well, the more bootstraping the more potential for the issue, and since a compiler is especially vital in code generation, it seems like particularly bad code to introduce bugs into.
2016-10-19 08:23:04	Guest61608	anyway
2016-10-19 08:23:07	sbrg	If the first compiler has a bug in the code-generation, it is highly unlikely that this bug shows itself by making the compiler generate buggy code. it is much more likely that the compiler just breaks

2016-10-19 08:23:49	piou	I don't think so, I see no specific issue linked to boostraping here, the issues with compilers emitting code that doesn't work are the same issues everybody has with any other program.
2016-10-19 08:24:40	Guest61608	piou, because compilers are in a unique position to negatively affect more programs than just itself?

2016-10-19 08:25:13	GeDaMo	Hi Holandoro :)
2016-10-19 08:25:16	vdamewood	If a compiler is buggy enough to emit badf code, odds are the next iteration's source will have some check for the bug, and avoid the 'feature', while using a less elegant way of getting the job done.
2016-10-19 08:25:18	Holandoro	How do i go about writing an assembler ? I've read others code but its mostly non-data driven
2016-10-19 08:25:28	piou	Guest61608: but that's true no matter where the compiler comes from. Really. If you want a bug that propagates from compiler to compiler I've never ever seen one.
2016-10-19 08:26:03	piou	Guest61608: if the code emitted isn't correct it can't magically be passed to the next one. Code generation is too complex for that, it will break before it happens.
2016-10-19 08:26:14	Holandoro	bascally, the other code I read is javascript code and it has these "slice" functions called and it seems very inefficient
2016-10-19 08:26:19	piou	Guest61608: (well, could theoretically happen but in real life that's unheard of)

2016-10-19 09:20:45	piou	maroon_: to read from a file into a buffer you need: 1) to allocate a buffer, either statically using the syntax « char buf[1024] » for example, or dynamically (meaning the length is only known when running the program) using « char* buf = malloc(1024 * sizeof(char)); ». 2) Once that memory is allocated open the file.

This is not sizeof(buffer) because that syntax means « The size of the variable buffer » and in the case of dynamic allocation this size is that of a pointer (so 4 or 8 but nothing useful to you). 3) close the file. You did that right.

2016-10-19 10:30:34	ciniglio	I believe this answer assumes that you can't resize in place, which makes sense to me (since that's not really a resize)
2016-10-19 10:30:57	moppy	But his question is about increasing the array by a FIXED size each time it's full, vs doubling the size
2016-10-19 10:31:05	chillychil	exactly
2016-10-19 10:31:17	sbrg	chillychil: Think of it like this: if you increase the size a fixed amount every time(let's say N elements), then every N'th element will trigger a resize. yes?

2016-10-19 10:31:36	ciniglio	thought you meant each insertion
2016-10-19 10:31:53	chillychil	sbrg:yes
2016-10-19 10:31:58	_W_	if you increase exponentially, the amount of previously-moved-in-resize tends towards a fixed fraction of the current size
2016-10-19 10:32:23	sbrg	however, if you double the size every time, then every time you resize, the next resize is as many insertions away as the current size of the array(before resize)

2016-10-19 10:35:03	btborg	Question about If-Else If-Else blocks
2016-10-19 10:35:05	sbrg	amortized running time is sometimes explained using "saving work". every time you double the size of the array, from N to 2N, you have "saved" N free(O(1)) insertions. this means that when the resize finally happens, you have gotten so many insertions in without doing a resize that "on average" the cost of insertion is constant time.

2016-10-19 10:36:50	chillychil	is the answer that the actual answer is that every time our array fills up, if we only increase the size by a fixed factor  Then our time cost in copying will be a summation of natural numbers times the fixed factor  This summation is n(n+1)/2

2016-10-19 11:14:30	Shayanjm	instead I think you should figure out how much your shares are worth today (pre-acquisition), and figure out what multiplier the investors are expecting on their valuation
2016-10-19 11:14:36	Shayanjm	yes it does
2016-10-19 11:14:43	Shayanjm	especially if your company has gone through multiple rounds of funding

2016-10-19 12:53:19	JX7P	so an object encapsulating a Vector of 5120 items needs only the shallow content (pointer to a vector, or the vector's internal data structure, which is a few pointers and integers if i remember right)  to be copied

2016-10-19 12:56:12	JX7P	in JX Objective-C, getting system time is extremely fast: you just ask Computer "getTheDate" and it will prepare you a Date. you spend a short time in the dispatch, as JX Objective-C has very fast message dispatch, and only a little time in allocating the Date object. so the major bottleneck is system speed

2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:09:39] Hi I have a question, For some reason in valgrind my C code when executed says invalid read of size 1 and it has something to do with a strlen, why? http://sprunge.us/cbbR?c [00:09:39]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	+PlanckWalk	[00:14:48] hoqan: Not nearly enough information [00:14:48]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:15:07] PlanckWalk: what else is needed? [00:15:07]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	+PlanckWalk	[00:15:07] Most of the variables you use there are not even declared [00:15:07]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:15:11] ah [00:15:11]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:15:25] would it not being delimited with a '\0' have anything to do with it? [00:15:25]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:15:34] i dont want to share my full code because of the coe grabbers [00:15:34]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:15:36] code [00:15:36]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	+PlanckWalk	[00:15:38] That would certainly be a complete fail, yes [00:15:38]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	+PlanckWalk	[00:15:51] strlen looks for a terminating \0 [00:15:51]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:15:56] ah [00:15:56]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	+PlanckWalk	[00:16:06] So if there isn't one, it will run off into whatever memory it can reach until it finds one [00:16:06]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:16:27] maybe thats why then [00:16:27]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:16:54] I could share my code but dont upload it anywhere [00:16:54]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	Heffree	[00:16:55] Probably, that would you give the output of invalid read of size 1 [00:16:55]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:17:20] ah [00:17:20]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	+PlanckWalk	[00:17:43] Applying strlen to something that isn't a C string is definitely wrong [00:17:43]

2016-10-19 14:34:38	elricsfate	[00:20:36] I'm interested in finding a free or open source solution for an upcoming project. [00:20:36]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:27:20] Here is more code: http://sprunge.us/hLcL?c [00:27:20]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:27:27] Im really not sure why strlen is segfaulting [00:27:27]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	elricsfate	[00:28:57] Is there a better channel to ask this than programming? [00:28:57]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	minous	[00:32:09] hoqan, so, you know for sure strlen is where the segfault happens? [00:32:09]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:32:18] it says [00:32:18]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:32:24] ==25002== Invalid read of size 1 ==25002==    at 0x4C2C1A2: strlen (vg_replace_strmem.c:412) [00:32:24]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:32:36] along with the function nest [00:32:36]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	+PlanckWalk	[00:32:57] Is s a valid C string? [00:32:57]
2016-10-19 14:34:38	hoqan	[00:33:04] yes [00:33:04]

2016-10-19 17:11:01	moppy	Then I write some dynamic java code to interpret some data at runtime and autocomplete fails :-)
2016-10-19 17:11:02	spjt	autocomplete isn't what does it for me, it's navigating to the declaration. In a 1M line codebase written by someone else, that's key

In the insert function, if the node is null, it will create a new node and return it.

2016-10-19 20:40:03	***	Buffer Playback...
2016-10-19 20:40:03	michael__	[05:58:50] What I posted above lets C and C++ users each call the correct style, but doesn't hide nsFunction, and is a little messy [05:58:50]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	imode	[05:59:21] you could have it so that you only define nsFunction inside the compilation unit that you define Function in. [05:59:21]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	imode	[05:59:44] (if you're using C++. otherwise, define nsFunction.) [05:59:44]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	imode	[06:00:07] something like #ifndef __cplusplus void nsFunction(int x); #endif [06:00:07]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	imode	[06:00:55] and in whatever.c, void nsFunction(int x) { <whatever> } namespace ns { inline void Function(x) { nsFunction(x); } } [06:00:55]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	michael__	[06:00:57] But the C++ inline has to have access to the C functions, so I need to define them, then hide them [06:00:57]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	imode	[06:01:19] here, let me type it up. [06:01:19]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	michael__	[06:02:05] I could do it not inline, but the extra jump would be a performance penalty (Running on an embedded platform with not much resources) [06:02:05]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	michael__	[06:03:01] I could define them only in their domain, and symlink header.c to header.cpp [06:03:01]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	michael__	[06:03:09] And compile both separately [06:03:09]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	imode	[06:03:30] one sec. [06:03:30]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	imode	[06:03:42] http://pastebin.com/dAcxMgTf [06:03:42]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	imode	[06:03:49] something like this. [06:03:49]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	imode	[06:04:27] if you're using C++, nsFunction is never declared in the header, but it's used in the compilation unit. [06:04:27]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	imode	[06:04:36] so other parts of your program can't see it. [06:04:36]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	imode	[06:04:49] you'll always use ns::Function [06:04:49]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	imode	[06:05:02] (big, large, glowing neon disclaimer: I'm not a C++ person.) [06:05:02]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	michael__	[06:05:10] I thought inlines had to be defined in the header? [06:05:10]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	imode	[06:05:25] I don't think so. let me double-check. [06:05:25]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	imode	[06:06:16] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5057021/why-are-c-inline-functions-in-the-header this answer gets it right. [06:06:16]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	imode	[06:06:40] his comment that "because you don't declare it inline doesn't mean the compiler can't inline the function" is pretty accurate. the compiler is pretty smart. [06:06:40]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	michael__	[06:07:55] I'm going to define them separately, and compile them twice.  Once as C, once as C++ [06:07:55]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	 *	imode [06:08:05] shrugs. [06:08:05]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	imode	[06:08:13] probably for the best. [06:08:13]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	imode	[06:08:20] but this is one option. [06:08:20]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	doxterpepper	[06:14:53] So what is a code linter? [06:14:53]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	doxterpepper	[06:15:20] Is it basically to act as a compiler and catch bad code? [06:15:20]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	liste	[06:16:28] doxterpepper: it analyzes your code and catches common mistakes and code smells [06:16:28]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	Coldseeker	[06:16:39] doxterpepper: basically. it goes over code and looks no only for errors, but also suspect code, things that might be *valid* but tend to be bad signs. (eg, code smells, antipatterns) [06:16:39]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	doxterpepper	[06:17:37] gotcha, that's what I figured. They seem really useful for interpreted languages like ruby or python, are they usually used much for compiled languages? [06:17:37]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	Coldseeker	[06:18:03] doxterpepper: they orginally became popular back in the bad old days when compilers could barely detect flat out errors, and couldn't produce a useful error message if their life depended on it. these days they mainly focus on antipatterns, and yes interpreted languages. [06:18:03]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	michael__	[06:18:33] Hmm, wonder what my code would look like.  I like using gotos [06:18:33]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	Coldseeker	[06:19:11] doxterpepper: its not uncommon for modern linters to be combined with style and code policy enforcement. as well as "advanced" things like function contracts, limits, etc, etc. [06:19:11]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	doxterpepper	[06:19:30] Gotcha, I had heard of linters but never really researched them too much. I was thinkgin about starting to use one on a rails project to try and catch silly mistakes we make [06:19:30]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	doxterpepper	[06:20:05] Can you usually set what style to look for? [06:20:05]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	Coldseeker	[06:21:01] doxterpepper: thats generally the idea, though it depends on the specific linter. [06:21:01]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	liste	[06:21:33] doxterpepper: they're useful for both dynamic and static languages, but are extra useful for dynamic ones because there isn't a compiler catching errors [06:21:33]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	Kitlith	[06:21:50] I use a linter built into my editor, so I don't have to compile before seeing my silly mistakes. [06:21:50]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	Coldseeker	[06:22:09] (a linter that can't except at least some configuration generally isn't very useful; there is always an edge case where "bad" code is just the best way to go.) [06:22:09]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	doxterpepper	[06:24:16] I think im going to look more into them. My team tends to do silly thins because they aren't as familiar with rails so it would proabably help some [06:24:16]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	doxterpepper	[06:25:34] Anybody have suggestions for linters related to ruby and or ruby on rails? [06:25:34]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	meshsmith	[06:27:36] General question: ruby or python for web app? [06:27:36]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	imode	[06:28:01] lolcode, obviously. [06:28:01]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	Shayanjm	[06:28:21] meshsmith: whichever you know right now. [06:28:21]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	doxterpepper	[06:28:34] meshsmith: Both are good, basically do the same thing. I'd go with whichever you know better [06:28:34]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	meshsmith	[06:29:25] k, more fun with japanese gems. [06:29:25]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	rai_	[06:30:52] meshsmith: you can get webapps up quickly with ruby (really quickly) [06:30:52]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	stoveeee	[06:32:54] Whats a good resource for going from AP Comp Sci level of Java knowledge to full scale Java developer? I've tried pet projects like a Statistics software analysis thing and I've fiddled with API access, but I don't feel like I know enough to give those tasks a serious shot [06:32:54]

2016-10-20 01:56:57	Rashad	Last year I worked as an intern for ADSC in Singapore... The problem my team was trying to solve is "sound source localization using microphone arrays"... The idea of making a robot able to detect where a certain sound came from.

2016-10-20 01:58:11	Rashad	However, it's really difficult for a robot to localize sounds for some reason and no one is even halfway towards the final goal.
2016-10-20 01:58:21	velco	did anyone try to solve sound source location using AI techniques ?
2016-10-20 01:58:43	Rashad	But we know it is solvable because animals can do it with ears instead of microphones.... mind you... only TWO ears.
2016-10-20 01:59:14	Rashad	The rule of thumb for microphone arrays is that you need a N microphones for N sound sources..
2016-10-20 01:59:15	velco	what are ears if not a device which transforms sound waves in electrical signals, i.e. a microphone ?
2016-10-20 01:59:36	monq	ears also control balance
2016-10-20 01:59:40	Rashad	So my team was using "deep neural networks" to solve the problem.

2016-10-20 05:18:37	monq	you can set up an elaborate system where you have a messaging system that handles event queues and whatnot but unless you're doing something really specific and huge i don't think you want that
2016-10-20 05:18:55	Xatenev	adsc: When i add 'v' as format - that means every argument can take up to 16 bit space at MAX right?

2016-10-20 05:57:28	Xatenev	that would result in 3 or 4 bits?

2016-10-20 05:57:47	+rindolf	Xatenev: numbers are not inherently hexadecimal or decimal or whatever - only their representation is.
2016-10-20 05:58:02	sbrg	when you think "number" you should think "Number as i've always known numbers". when you think binary, decimal or some other base, you should think of it as translating from the numbers you've always known to another way of representing the same number.
2016-10-20 05:58:18	sbrg	0b10 is not a different number from 2. it is the same number. it is just a different representation.
2016-10-20 05:58:19	ciniglio	0x6 requires 3 bits; depending on the language or program, it may actually use a lot of 0's in front of those 3 bits

2016-10-20 09:02:22	renlo	Lets say there is a web application. There are various build steps, dependencies, and configuration options for this web application. To deploy this web application, an image is created (AMI / docker image, doesnt really matter). Then, the image is spun up, filesystems mounted, config options inputed, etc., and the app is deployed.

I think the team who made the application should provide a 'build script', which installs all the dependencies in the image. The DevOps team should handle deploying that image, setting up the automated building of the image, etc

2016-10-20 13:24:29	muffinmonstah	ok im going to ask my question then, so for my coursework i need to develop a tennis scoringboard, however I need to implement MVC design pattern .. now my question is, as the GUI only will display the match between two persons, should I still create a superclass for players? or should I just create a String for each player (player 1 and player 2)
2016-10-20 13:24:39	muffinmonstah	pretty please!
2016-10-20 13:25:03	muffinmonstah	i mean, create the strings on the model class
2016-10-20 13:25:55	moppy	Let me understand this.
2016-10-20 13:26:03	moppy	You have a gui that can display a match between 2 players
2016-10-20 13:26:09	muffinmonstah	correct
2016-10-20 13:26:19	moppy	And you want to know how to store the player information?
2016-10-20 13:26:24	muffinmonstah	yes
2016-10-20 13:26:36	muffinmonstah	because as I will implement the view, controller and model class
2016-10-20 13:26:53	muffinmonstah	I dont know if do I need to create extra classes (object of type Player)
2016-10-20 13:26:59	muffinmonstah	or do I need to create a interface
2016-10-20 13:27:13	moppy	Where are the player's scores recorded? In the gui?

2016-10-20 13:27:42	muffinmonstah	well they should be recorded in the model class I think
2016-10-20 13:28:08	moppy	The model is the data. The view what the user sees. the controller is the logic runs it.

2016-10-21 04:05:42	Rashad	Here is one cool idea: just like how you pull data from the database for the user to view in a component (think messages pulled from the database and displayed as bubbles), you can do the same on the "database" tab to view your data in a user-friendly way.

2016-10-21 04:16:32	password4	I dont really give a fuck about compactness
2016-10-21 04:16:33	Rashad	For example, you just want to know the user's nickname at the present time, but instead of declaring "var user_nickname" declaring "var user = {}; user.nickname;" is more maintainable.

2016-10-21 05:29:12	InPhase	GeDaMo: The standard library allows optimizations to be written into the library that make things faster, but would be too cumbersome if you had to do them by hand each time you wanted to use them.

2016-10-21 05:33:03	InPhase	GeDaMo: If you know exactly the size of every string as a constant, then you can pack them into tight character arrays.  But as long as dynamic memory is present, std::string is much better than preallocating large buffers.

2016-10-21 11:27:21	tom_mai78101	Problem is, you are tasked to find the longest concatenated string out of the many texts. Let's say, you have {cat, cats, catdog, catdogcat}. You need to iterate though each text and find that catdogcat is the longest.
2016-10-21 11:27:24	tom_mai78101	tomine: Yep
2016-10-21 11:27:48	tom_mai78101	tomine: Because I have no idea how to "optimize" it down to at least O(n^2)

2016-10-21 11:28:14	tomine	hmm
2016-10-21 11:28:16	tom_mai78101	I had to use two for loops, with the second nested for loop using recursion to check for concatenated text.
2016-10-21 11:28:45	tomine	how about sorting the strings by length and then going backwards from the longest word?
2016-10-21 11:28:53	tom_mai78101	The first for loop is to iterate through 173,000 texts. The second for loop checks for all available 173,000 texts as string patterns.
2016-10-21 11:28:58	tomine	words* by length
2016-10-21 11:29:12	tom_mai78101	tomine: Going to try that.
2016-10-21 11:29:16	lyinch	tom_mai78101: There is a better way! I did that problem for the longest contiguous subarray with the highest summation. There should be a dynamic programming method

2016-10-21 17:03:29	MadokaMagica	I believe that is also implemented in the file writing functions

2016-10-21 17:04:22	MadokaMagica	Yeah like the write function actually waits until the lock on the file is released before writing to it
2016-10-21 17:04:31	MadokaMagica	So multiple writes are written in a batch
2016-10-21 17:04:45	woggle	okuu: In particular, this means that if two processes have a file open with O_APPEND and write(), it's gaurenteed that everything written by each write() call will appear in the file rather than clobbering each other.
2016-10-21 17:04:56	MadokaMagica	The main thing I'm worrying about is how system call return types work
2016-10-21 17:05:02	woggle	okuu: (But it's not gaurenteed that they'll each write() everything they asked for, making this a bit less useful.)
2016-10-21 17:05:02	MadokaMagica	Or process return types
2016-10-21 17:05:14	MadokaMagica	Whenever we call exit() we have to save the return type, and also save it when an exception occurs

2016-10-21 17:08:06	MadokaMagica	Yes, I know
2016-10-21 17:08:19	MadokaMagica	I think that the kill function and exit function are the only times a process will exit
2016-10-21 17:08:21	woggle	Random832: They'll presumable be writing to the same part of the file, but when two write()s overlap, exactly one will "win" and write last rather than seeing any combination.

2016-10-21 17:09:28	Random832	it's a bit worrying because it's a common scenario
2016-10-21 17:09:30	woggle	Random832: There's no gaurentees about what order happens, just that there is an order.
2016-10-21 17:09:49	Random832	yes i mean the write vs the file position update, given that the position is shared between the processes
2016-10-21 17:09:50	woggle	Random832: The same is true in the O_APPEND case, it just happens that the first step of writing with O_APPEND is seeking.
2016-10-21 17:10:58	Random832	the question i would have is whether you can ever lose data.
2016-10-21 17:11:20	Random832	like, one process writes "aaaaaa" and the other process writes "bbbbbb" to the same position and you therefore only see one of those lines
2016-10-21 17:12:33	MadokaMagica	I think the first process should run first
2016-10-21 17:12:47	MadokaMagica	And then the file lock is released and given to the second process
2016-10-21 17:12:51	MadokaMagica	Which overrides what the first process wrote
2016-10-21 17:13:20	MadokaMagica	It's kinda like one user going into process.c and making some edits and another user coming in and overriding those edits and those two users spend an hour arguing about the project never getting done

2016-10-21 17:13:46	woggle	Random832: Er, I guess if they share the open file description, the atomic requirement means it should correctly for normal writes if not O_APPEND.

2016-10-21 20:55:34	kadoban	ackpacket: Directly, i.e. "Yes, probably." ?
2016-10-21 20:56:24	ackpacket	kadoban, Literally, just yes.  If they continue to source me on the subject, for example django views, I'll just let them know after a while "Sorry, I don't know, I've never used what you're asking about"
2016-10-21 20:56:59	kadoban	Hehe
2016-10-21 20:57:23	Demon_Fox	Basically like trying every possible combination of cards in a deck of X size
2016-10-21 20:57:26	ackpacket	kadoban, it 1) discourages the ask to ask with the least effort from me, and 2) illustrates why it should be discouraged lol

2016-10-21 20:58:38	kadoban	That sounds more like a permutation
2016-10-21 20:58:38	ackpacket	Demon_Fox, so it's not a combination, but an ordering, that you want?
2016-10-21 20:58:46	Demon_Fox	I suppose
2016-10-21 20:58:56	ackpacket	Demon_Fox, Well what would change it from suppose to "yes"
2016-10-21 20:59:05	Demon_Fox	yes
2016-10-21 20:59:20	ackpacket	Demon_Fox, there are nice recursive ways of doing this
2016-10-21 20:59:24	thecha	where does the buffer come in?

2016-10-21 22:28:31	fancyfetus	Hey guys, I'm working on a large  fault-tolerant IRC bot that can listen to every single channel in a very large IRC server. Unfortunately, the server has some limitations that I have to adhere too. For example, I can only join channels at a rate of 3/second, which is troublesome when there are 30'000 channels up.
2016-10-21 22:28:45	fancyfetus	If my TCP connection fails, then I have to spend a loooong time rejoining all those channels.
2016-10-21 22:29:12	fancyfetus	My solution was to connect to the IRC server through multiple TCP connections and then have each connection listen to only a handful of channels.

2016-10-21 22:29:52	rindolf	fancyfetus: that sounds nefarious.
2016-10-21 22:30:25	+PlanckWalk	That can be a problem too, since many servers prevent more than a tiny handful of connections from the same IP.
2016-10-21 22:30:25	fancyfetus	but it just doesn't feel like a good enough solution. Most channels have little to no traffic, while some channels have nearly all of it. How do I intelligently distribute that? What happens when new channels are created and others stop being used?
2016-10-21 22:30:37	fancyfetus	PlanckWalk: that's not really an issue in my case
2016-10-21 22:30:42	medfly	Oh, found it! (tried 'connect')
2016-10-21 22:30:48	fancyfetus	I'm fairly sure I'm meant to do it this way

2016-10-21 22:32:18	fancyfetus	So my question isn't one of a coding nature. I'm looking for a technique or a best-practice that people use to distribute messages across multiple TCP connections.
2016-10-21 22:32:27	+PlanckWalk	The way you're "meant" to listen to all channels is to get permission from server admins.
2016-10-21 22:32:49	fancyfetus	PlanckWalk: This isn't exactly IRC, it's Twitch, which uses a very similar protocol for their chat

It the amount of communication.  One skype meeting per day for an hour is not as efficient in a team process as being in the same too with the team all day long.

2016-10-22 04:38:29	Drakonan	okuu, it could be the sites themselves have you tried download managers that give you multiple pipelines to download with?

2016-10-22 04:39:29	okuu	systemfault: Exactly!
2016-10-22 04:39:52	Drakonan	usually torrents would be the first to throttle but you can encrypt them in theory
2016-10-22 04:40:00	okuu	But the numbers don't lie. I'm downloading torrents at 1.2 MB/s right now, and that's only because I've deliberately throttled my torrent client.
2016-10-22 04:40:10	jonez	you can get great speeds with a torrent. keep in mind that is a distributed system, sometimes from several corners of the internet at once.
2016-10-22 04:40:18	okuu	But Arch system updates, which are delivered via HTTP? 20 KB/s.

2016-10-22 04:53:43	Sadale	Currently I'm able to get stuffs done. My program may not be elegant. But at least it works :3
2016-10-22 04:54:01	Sadale	I still remember the days that I wrote automation script with... C++
2016-10-22 04:54:19	Rashad	Drakonan: I haven't worked as part of a team or in a company yet.
2016-10-22 04:54:22	Rashad	So I don't know.
2016-10-22 04:54:35	Sadale	This channel was my most active channel. Now I've moved to anime :p
2016-10-22 04:54:39	Drakonan	Rashad, ha why is this so common everyone have tips but no one is in a position to give them
2016-10-22 04:54:52	Rashad	But you don't need to know these stuff... I mean... if you have a certain talent/skill and there is demand for it, you're probably on the right track..

2016-10-22 04:57:16	Drakonan	and for that you REALLY need to know your stuff to pass the interview

2016-10-22 05:14:19	wowsuchnamaste	My recommendation would be to use tools that work for your own workflow while learning. If you're on a windows machine, visual studio. If on a mac, xcode. Add a github account to allow yourself to keep backups of your learner projects, with the added benefit of learning git as a sideeffect. Point being; you will probably not get hired as a programmer for being an svn wizard, but based on
2016-10-22 05:14:19	wowsuchnamaste	your problem solving abilities and level of programming experience. So learn the tools that make sense to you. Getting into a new company, they should provide you with the information you need to get into their workflow fast and without further difficulties, and you'll be expected to be able to learn the tools that fit into that specific workflow without further ado.

2016-10-22 06:16:58	InPhase	velco: Yes, we've lost some of the control in practice.  I think android on phones is a good example of this borderline.  It's a struggle to get phones which are both modern phones, and retain full control of the software.  The hobbyist developers who are working on custom mods seem to lag behind Google developers, and some of the hardware vendors fight hard against the ability to install these.

2016-10-22 10:38:30	sbrg	programming in a language that makes a lot of things difficult and errors more likely to happen isn't "hardcore". it's just a waste of time and effort.
2016-10-22 10:38:36	jeaye	Zeno`: If you choose not to drastically improve your program's static safety, without impacting its run-time performance, then it's up to you; the most important thing is to at least realize that C is _not_ the most viable option. It's likely just the one you like the most.

2016-10-22 10:44:16	jeaye	Zeno`: If you do a lot of C work, consider adopting C++ around your typical C. Adopting C++ doesn't mean rewriting everything to use std::vector and std::string; it can mean something as simple as a stronger type system. Array copies can be size-checked at compile-time. Small wins here and there; take only what you want from the language.
2016-10-22 10:44:27	InPhase	r7st: So in reduced cases it is harder to see or explain the advantages of C++ over C.

2016-10-22 13:24:58	Random832	the 17 is the total number of columns including spaces

2016-10-22 18:49:17	Random832	that'd explain pressing enter, if you haven't redirected 0 to your pipe
2016-10-22 18:49:42	r7st	can the pipe not take 0?

2016-10-22 20:18:50	_W_	TarsleC: what I did (java web app with code hotswapping) was when there was a change on disk, reload in a separate context - whatever was on the old version finished to completion, but new version was up for new requests immediately, and old was garbage collected once its last request completed

2016-10-22 23:49:00	amigojapan	Batholith: there are many alternatives to pastebin that dont use ads,   but I use many things that as far as I know only pastebin does, like expiring a post after a date…. I would like ot know a better site
2016-10-22 23:49:11	vendu	i've been working on my kernel for a change :P
2016-10-22 23:49:26	rindolf	vendu: yes, I know.
2016-10-22 23:49:44	Batholith	amigojapan: I would also like to know of a better site. Ideone used to be awesome but it now enforces you to run the code, which is just annoying.
2016-10-22 23:49:52	vendu	rindolf, i applied some black magic to eliminate doing divisions in the scheduler =)
2016-10-22 23:49:58	Batholith	Ideone doesn't have expiration feature though. :(
2016-10-22 23:50:14	vendu	turn them into faster ops, use lookup tables to store two 16-bit words per divisor :)
2016-10-22 23:50:15	Batholith	But ideone is very clean and simple, which is what I like about it.
2016-10-22 23:50:30	amigojapan	Batholith: github has gist https://gist.github.com/
2016-10-22 23:50:39	vendu	so i divide 32-bit numbers by 16-bit ones =)

2016-10-23 02:49:30	piou	LastShot: just in case you're not actually a troll (although you look like one): asking a question without providing the necessary informations when asked to is harming yourself. OOP isn't a problem solving method, it's a software architechure one. It says nothing of the solution itself, only how you organized yourself to realise that solution. So yeah, I'm with rindolf here.

2016-10-23 03:14:37	sbrg	what happened and is happening is that there are a bunch of (mostly chinese) companies that produce cheap-ass IoT devices with nearly 0 focus on security. many or most of these devices have some form of hardcoded backdoor in them that is often not documented but blatantly easy to find because it's often just a telnet server or something(discovered with a portscan). in most cases, the access credentials are also hardcoded, which means
2016-10-23 03:14:37	sbrg	that if you break one device, you can break into all other devices.
2016-10-23 03:15:20	sbrg	so now we have thousands upon thousands of IoT devices that are compromised, and a bunch more probably just waiting to be compromised, and there is little we can do. there is no infrastructure for recalling these devices or to let people know they own devices that have been compromised.

2016-10-23 04:18:23	gde33	command line "interface"
2016-10-23 04:18:35	amigojapan	gde33: hmmm, except for being bloated nowdays OSes are a little better than AmigaOS I think
2016-10-23 04:18:54	amigojapan	Se7ev: Command Line Interface
2016-10-23 04:18:58	gde33	bloat can be managed
2016-10-23 04:18:59	amigojapan	nate2: ok, let me look it up
2016-10-23 04:19:04	echotangoecho	gde33: what is wrong with command line interfaces?
2016-10-23 04:19:18	turbo64	absolutely nothing imo
2016-10-23 04:19:20	echotangoecho	I do a lot of work from the terminal
2016-10-23 04:19:35	turbo64	i use linux exclusively through a putty terminal
2016-10-23 04:19:48	gde33	echotangoecho: the golden rule was that if you have to read teh manual to use the interface its terrible, its not even interfacing.
2016-10-23 04:19:49	turbo64	kids these days just didn't grow up with DOS and can't handle the command line

2016-10-23 04:19:57	echotangoecho	that's just silly

2016-10-23 04:20:11	Rounin	Hm, yes, the bloat is kind of the largest difference
2016-10-23 04:20:22	Rounin	That, and that modern software tends to do things to you that you don't want

2016-10-23 04:21:40	turbo64	if i want to find/replace in a text file i dont have to open a text editor, i just use sed

2016-10-23 04:21:48	turbo64	and mass renaming is easy

2016-10-23 04:26:05	gde33	when you type format it is okay to show you the files no?
2016-10-23 04:26:25	turbo64	its easier for me to open a config file from the command line and edit it in vim than to open a gui text editor, browse to the config file, etc.
2016-10-23 04:26:26	gde33	its just garbage, it is what you use if there is no proper interface in my opinion.
2016-10-23 04:26:41	turbo64	and if its a global config file i have to open a terminal anyway to run the text editor with root privileges
2016-10-23 04:26:50	gde33	turbo64: because you have a lot of experience doing that
2016-10-23 04:27:02	gde33	I understand and you are right
2016-10-23 04:27:17	amigojapan	turbo64: I do something intermediate, I browse to the file using xtrem, then I launch geany from commandline

2016-10-23 04:27:34	turbo64	i use geany purely as an IDE

Zero updates to worry about. 5. Exclusive games simply not found on computers. 6. Beautiful hardware and a very special feeling of using a unique machine.
2016-10-23 05:20:44	vendu	hello again =)
2016-10-23 05:20:47	elpoptardo	7. No installations.

2016-10-23 05:21:02	vendu	damn i wish i'd understand the replacements of divisions with faster operations =)
2016-10-23 05:21:11	elpoptardo	9. Virtually all users have the same setup.

2016-10-23 05:22:03	amigojapan	elpoptardo: PC games dont nessesarily need an installation either…. they just all do it that way
2016-10-23 05:22:04	elpoptardo	They tried silly things such as the mouse for the PlayStation, which is still cool, but it was just for a minority of clearly labeled games.
2016-10-23 05:22:06	vendu	the range of divisors in the kernel is just a few thousand :)
2016-10-23 05:22:18	amigojapan	elpoptardo: most joypads can be connected to PCs

2016-10-23 05:24:48	vendu	xux, and i think i have them covered, mostly :)
2016-10-23 05:25:04	amigojapan	liste: yes,  just a little while ago I mentioned that I felt leaving cartriges felt like a step in the worng direction, even back when it happened
2016-10-23 05:25:28	elpoptardo	If you have one cartridge, that game becomes good, no matter how much it sucks. If you have a hard drive and floppies with 30,000,000 pirated games, you play each game for 10 seconds and barely see the title screen before going: "Seen it... NEXT!"
2016-10-23 05:26:28	amigojapan	ok elpoptardo , so what generation of consoles are you saying were needed in the way you say? I can probably agree until like the year 2004 or so

2016-10-23 05:27:31	elpoptardo	I found the games made for that console to be very trashy and poor.

2016-10-23 05:30:09	elpoptardo	Nintendo NX (project name) turned into "Nintendo Switch".
2016-10-23 05:30:22	elpoptardo	Of course, I never leave the house, so it doesn't appeal to me in the least.

2016-10-23 05:30:59	elpoptardo	Seems like it would be very weak since all of the GPU and stuff has to be inside that portable unit.

2016-10-23 08:58:47	Heraclmene	So what you're saying is if the user calls your iterator function but performs the deletion via key at some point, the iterator is then invalid.

2016-10-23 09:00:20	SlashLife	Which can only happen from another thread, because the moment the iterator deletion function returns, the iterator is invalid anyway and must not be reused to delete again and would be in *clear* violation of the precondition.
2016-10-23 09:00:20		[09:00]
2016-10-23 09:00:40	Heraclmene	Could you not lock the collection then check if the iterator is valid somehow?
2016-10-23 09:01:15	SlashLife	My solution is actually to explicitly require for the iterator not to be invalidated by concurrent operations.
2016-10-23 09:01:47	SlashLife	And there is no way to check whether an iterator is valid, and considering this thing is supposed to be lock free, a lock is out of the question as well.
2016-10-23 09:02:06	SlashLife	I'm just pondering about the implications of preconditions within multi threaded code.

2016-10-23 09:03:14	SlashLife	Because theoretically it would be possible to pass a valid iterator to the function, then invalidate it before the function could even execute a single instruction - and claim that this would still satisfy the precondition.

2016-10-23 18:22:57	wrkrcoop	i want to learn about the physics of how memory works. can someone tell me what to google? i google ‘how does computer memory work’ but that didn’t give me what i was looking for

2016-10-23 19:56:53	DarkCthulhu	Hi all
2016-10-23 19:57:32	OoTLink	oy :D
2016-10-23 19:57:34	OoTLink	hiii
2016-10-23 19:59:06	DarkCthulhu	What's up OoTLink?
2016-10-23 19:59:14	DarkCthulhu	High spirits today :P
2016-10-23 19:59:16	OoTLink	cookies!
2016-10-23 19:59:44	DarkCthulhu	I've just realized, there is no text on distributed systems which bridges academia and real world systems, like the mysqls and mongodbs. That's a text worth writing for sure.
2016-10-23 20:00:10	OoTLink	aye, aside from like "we support sql queries!"

2016-10-23 20:01:22	DarkCthulhu	Yep. I want to link the concepts, even the rudimentary CAP theorem, and the consensus algorithms they use in production, with academia and its various theoretical concepts.
2016-10-23 20:01:33	DarkCthulhu	I wonder if I can find a publisher if I do write that text.
2016-10-23 20:01:34	OoTLink	hrmm actually, not sure how mongo deals with sql queries
2016-10-23 20:01:45	OoTLink	spark sql and hive do it pretty well
2016-10-23 20:01:58	OoTLink	i believe pandas lets you do sql queries on dataframes as well?
2016-10-23 20:02:08	DarkCthulhu	I'm not sure, I have only used pandas once or twice with scikit learn.
2016-10-23 20:02:14	OoTLink	apache drilll is pretty neat
2016-10-23 20:02:15	DarkCthulhu	But these are details aren't they? :)
2016-10-23 20:02:25	OoTLink	it'll let you do a sql query on a folder of avro files, or other types of files
2016-10-23 20:02:27	OoTLink	yeah lol
2016-10-23 20:02:30	DarkCthulhu	OoTLink: Interesting. Hadn't heard of that one. What is drill?
2016-10-23 20:02:36	DarkCthulhu	reading up
2016-10-23 20:02:58	OoTLink	I dunno, I only found out about it a couple weeks ago
2016-10-23 20:03:12	DarkCthulhu	Too much Apache open source software nowadays to keep up with.

If I have separate programs running in separate processes and a Watchdog component that listens to the "heartbeat" signals that the programs send to it to indicate they're alive and not blocked. Where in the code would I send that signal? If I create a timer that sends it... that's a separate thread and will send a heartbeat even when the main app thread is blocked.

2016-10-24 00:26:50	SpaghettiCat	amigojapan: that is not as effective as an organized, educational course. And you would have to study longer because certs and contribs are the only proof you have of your skills
2016-10-24 00:27:11	monq	Jinx00, depends on what you want to work with.
2016-10-24 00:27:17	monq	but you should absolutely learn vanilla JS well first

2016-10-24 02:56:13	squid_squad	but i want the string to int
2016-10-24 02:56:17	squid_squad	so i can round it
2016-10-24 02:56:22	squid_squad	then back into string
2016-10-24 02:56:25	roegng	liste so given l = [0,6,8,3] ; l[-1] would be 3?
2016-10-24 02:56:27	Rounin	Perhaps the whole thing throws an exception in getDeposit and that's why the dialogue never shows

2016-10-24 06:57:20	amigojapan	vdamewood: I am not sure, there is not enough information on the net to know, maybe just a java function would work, perhaps I need to study the android SDK to find something to call to keep on running on suspended mode

2016-10-24 07:33:26	+nitrix	Myrl-saki: I have a game where all the objects on the map are sort of automata. They have a state, like a door's open/closed, different pin number, etc. Currently, I pass them messages like proximity events, stepped on event, and the object reacts to it.
2016-10-24 07:33:44	swoc	And then display a notification with the number, saving it to a *.txt file.

2016-10-24 07:34:07	+nitrix	Myrl-saki: But with FRP, it's complicated because those objects are in chunks, and the chunks form the world. So if I want them to react, like simply moving, the event has to go to the chunk which moves the object.

2016-10-24 13:19:24	sbrg	below context free languages, there are regular languages, which are all languages that you can write a regular expression to parse, to simplify a bit.
2016-10-24 13:19:36	sbrg	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy this may provide some insight.
2016-10-24 13:20:18	sbrg	however, you don't necessarily need to know all the theory by heart or understand it on a deep level to write a parser using, for example, bison/flex.

2016-10-24 13:27:37	sbrg	anyway, this is why something like a context free language is strictly more powerful than a regular language. a regular expression describes a regular language. a context free grammar describes a context free language. a regular language is, by definition, something that can be "parsed" by a finite automaton. therefore, a finite automaton isn't "powerful enough" to parse something that requires a context free grammar to describe it.

2016-10-24 14:29:32	okuu	As in, needing HTTP clients to perform everyday tasks.

2016-10-24 18:45:38	okuu	One nice thing about languages like Perl and JavaScript is that they have regular expression literals. But they come at the price of hardwiring regular expressions into the language. I think regular expressions should be a normal library like any other.
2016-10-24 18:46:59	okuu	So, if regular expressions must be a user-defined library feature, and regular expression literals must be available, then regular expression literals must be user-defined literals.

2016-10-24 22:59:38	dminuoso_	[07:19:41] I would buy a VT100 in a heartbeat. [07:19:41]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	liste	[07:20:05] I once saw a terminal (not sure which one) at a thrift store [07:20:05]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	bizarrefish	[07:20:19] I understand that a protocol is needed to do various things, but it feels like it would be better implemented in glibc [07:20:19]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	bizarrefish	[07:20:39] Or at least as a separate kind of kernel device. [07:20:39]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	dminuoso_	[07:20:40] Yes, load more things into glibc that absolutely do not belong into a standard C library. [07:20:40]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	bizarrefish	[07:20:49] Not the same thing which I use to talk to peripherals. [07:20:49]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	bizarrefish	[07:21:56] belonging is a slippery idea; for one thing, are we talking about being faithful to the original POSIX/UNIX philosophies, or are we talking about an ideal we would have today? [07:21:56]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	bizarrefish	[07:23:22] The user part of the computing landscape has somewhat changed since the inception of UNIX, leading to sub-optimal design. Linux community is pleasantly vigilant in places when it comes to replacing swathes of the system to reflect this. KMS, Wayland, Render nodes, etc... [07:23:22]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	bizarrefish	[07:23:50] Also UBI/mmcblk [07:23:50]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	bizarrefish	[07:24:15] Perhaps it's time for TTYs to get re-done [07:24:15]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	velco	[07:25:18] dminuoso_: glibc is not just a standard c libraruy [07:25:18]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	liste	[07:25:29] I wonder if you can still stick a terminal into a Windows machine [07:25:29]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	liste	[07:25:43] that happens to have a COM port :d [07:25:43]

2016-10-24 22:59:38	velco	[07:29:51] dminuoso_: well it never was :) [07:29:51]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	velco	[07:30:50] the separation of standards, when you look for specific source compatibilty is achieved by the way of feature macros [07:30:50]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	velco	[07:31:21] otherwise, various APIs aren't independent from each other and need to be implemented in the same place [07:31:21]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	MaximumKEK	[07:39:06] Hi9 All. [07:39:06]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	MaximumKEK	[07:40:03] I have been trying to get into programming for years, just lurkin to see what the people talk about. [07:40:03]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	lyinch	[07:52:28] hey, if I do insertion sort, I always swap all the elements, until the next item is at the right place. If I use binary sort, in the already sorted subarray, I can find the position in O(nlogn), but how can I "move" all the items, do insert the item at the located position? [07:52:28]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	velco	[07:53:05] just move them after you have found the position [07:53:05]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	velco	[07:53:21] backwards :) [07:53:21]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	lyinch	[07:55:02] but that still moves every item, just like the swapping does. I want to reduce the movements. I thought about smth. like pointers in a linked list, that I can change a few pointers and it works. But this is bad, because I can't get item at position i [07:55:02]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	lyinch	[07:55:51] like A -> B and then I change the pointers that it's A -> B -> C (and obviously the pointers where I took item C from) [07:55:51]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	adsc	[07:56:47] "binary sort"? [07:56:47]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	lyinch	[07:57:40] binary search, sorry... [07:57:40]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	adsc	[07:58:21] so you basically want to invent a new sorting algorithm? [07:58:21]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	lyinch	[07:59:20] I might exist, but it's a variation (hopefully improvement) of insertion sort, and I either don't know about it or it doesn't work because of some flaw I'm not aware of. And that's why I'm asking [07:59:20]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	velco	[07:59:37] lyinch: the closest to what you describe is a skip list [07:59:37]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	adsc	[08:00:37] lyinch: so it's insertion sort but instead of linearly stepping through to find the correct position you use binary search to find it? [08:00:37]

2016-10-24 23:19:14	velco	[07:53:05] just move them after you have found the position [07:53:05]
2016-10-24 23:19:14	velco	[07:53:21] backwards :) [07:53:21]
2016-10-24 23:19:14	lyinch	[07:55:02] but that still moves every item, just like the swapping does. I want to reduce the movements. I thought about smth. like pointers in a linked list, that I can change a few pointers and it works. But this is bad, because I can't get item at position i [07:55:02]
2016-10-24 23:19:14	lyinch	[07:55:51] like A -> B and then I change the pointers that it's A -> B -> C (and obviously the pointers where I took item C from) [07:55:51]
2016-10-24 23:19:14	adsc	[07:56:47] "binary sort"? [07:56:47]
2016-10-24 23:19:15	lyinch	[07:57:40] binary search, sorry... [07:57:40]
2016-10-24 23:19:15	adsc	[07:58:21] so you basically want to invent a new sorting algorithm? [07:58:21]
2016-10-24 23:19:15	lyinch	[07:59:20] I might exist, but it's a variation (hopefully improvement) of insertion sort, and I either don't know about it or it doesn't work because of some flaw I'm not aware of. And that's why I'm asking [07:59:20]
2016-10-24 23:19:15	velco	[07:59:37] lyinch: the closest to what you describe is a skip list [07:59:37]
2016-10-24 23:19:15	adsc	[08:00:37] lyinch: so it's insertion sort but instead of linearly stepping through to find the correct position you use binary search to find it? [08:00:37]
2016-10-24 23:19:15	adsc	[08:01:22] sounds like it should work [08:01:22]

I have not made any statements about anyone's programming ability, and my only point was that software is complicated to write, and that there exist clients for mongodb that probably have hundreds of man-hours put in already. you can't match that
2016-10-25 02:17:41	sbrg	in a short amount of time -- which I presumed she had seeing as she is doing something for work, and you can't just decide to go off on a tangent and write a client because you felt like it. it's not your own time.

2016-10-25 02:20:02	newageprogrammer	sbrg: To start off, she has stated before that she is female, and then you used that fact to attempt to offend her in a crude way. Second, a program that has say 2 hours of work put into it can be more reliable and scalable than one with 5000 hours and features you will never use. Writing a client doesn't take much time if you know how to follow a reference correctly, and it's a good learning experience. Grown-ups? You

2016-10-25 03:17:39	jerit	sbrg bcrypt automatically adds a salt to the password it generates iirc so that the format of the returned hash value that you store is <salt>.<password> or some such thing

2016-10-25 11:47:18	Wesley-chan	[21:44:06] the burden of proof is on you if you think free will is real, elusiveother [21:44:06]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	PiratePrentice	[21:44:21] PlanckWalk: I understand what you're getting at. I guess I should say that I don't believe the answer will be revealed with time. I think it's intractable. [21:44:21]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	Wesley-chan	[21:44:25] because we have no evidence of anything beyond what is physical [21:44:25]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	elusiveother	[21:44:27] Wesley-chan: you're the one saying it's definitely not; therefore, burden of proof falls on you [21:44:27]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	Wesley-chan	[21:44:47] the burden of proof lies on the person making the claim [21:44:47]

2016-10-25 11:47:18	elusiveother	[21:45:14] Wesley-chan: we also don't full understand the physical universe. we certainly don't understand it enough to say a meta-physical universe doesn't exist [21:45:14]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	PiratePrentice	[21:45:45] Although, I did read an article in some bygone physics journal about quantumn physics dictating that reality is fundamentally probabilistic, not determistic, but that still doesn't get us out of the free will problem [21:45:45]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	Wesley-chan	[21:45:47] what we call "metaphysics" and "magic" are without any doubt real. But that is just what we call things beyond our current physical understanding [21:45:47]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	Wesley-chan	[21:46:03] It is silly to make physical and philosophical assumptions based on such concepts [21:46:03]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	gde33	[21:46:17] reality is problematic [21:46:17]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	elusiveother	[21:46:30] Wesley-chan: gravity is currently beyond our understanding. we do not call gravity magic [21:46:30]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	PiratePrentice	[21:46:40] conciousness is the real mystery to me [21:46:40]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	Wesley-chan	[21:46:48] because gravity is predictable [21:46:48]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	PiratePrentice	[21:46:55] with things like motion, we can proceed directly from the physical quantity to some explanation of what motion is [21:46:55]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	elusiveother	[21:47:02] Wesley-chan: not on the quantum scale [21:47:02]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	PiratePrentice	[21:47:07] conciousness is this thing that just...escapes analysis [21:47:07]

2016-10-25 13:11:26	Lymia	piou, C being the cause of security vulnerabilities (IMO) is ultimately a problem of lacking features, though
2016-10-25 13:11:40	jonez	vdamewood, it == AT&T Unix
2016-10-25 13:11:48	Lymia	The same bugs happen just as easily in assembly, or any other very low level systems language. They lack bounds checking, etc.
2016-10-25 13:11:51	+vdamewood	jonez: That is correct.
2016-10-25 13:12:14	rai_	the essential idea behind C was to provide some abstraction over systems level programming and to provide <some> portability.

2016-10-25 13:12:51	jonez	ok
2016-10-25 13:13:12	imode	question: does anybody happen to know what version of wiki markup that c2.com uses? I would hazard a guess as to none of you but I might as well ask. :)
2016-10-25 13:13:25	+vdamewood	jonez: It's just that they have a complete version of it before they had a C compiler. The system was later rewritten in C (or perhaps converted).
2016-10-25 13:13:32	+vdamewood	s/have/had/
2016-10-25 13:13:40	piou	Lymia: I'm not sure about that... I guess it depends on what you call "feature". We could have the exact same language with bound checking and less UB. It's just that the standard doesn't agree with this position so implementing it in compilers would be going against the standard so it wouldn't be C anymore. We don't need to introduce new constructs into the language, we mostly need more static

2016-10-25 13:13:48	Lymia	C has no particular feature that is *detrimental* to safety (perhaps with the exception of undefined behavior)

2016-10-25 13:14:06	Lymia	Rather, for the most part, it mostly lacks additional safeties to prevent the kind of thing that causes problems.
2016-10-25 13:14:19	rai_	Lymia: more of a lack of features is what makes it unsafe in the wrong hands
2016-10-25 13:14:20	piou	on that I agree
2016-10-25 13:14:26	imode	_W_: thought as much... I tried pushing a json dump of a page through mediawiki and it got a lot of elements right.
2016-10-25 13:14:43	Lymia	Compare PHP
2016-10-25 13:14:43	turbo64	criticizing c for being unsafe is like criticizing the model t for not having power windows
2016-10-25 13:14:52	piou	rai_: it's definitely not a matter of hands, I've seen code written by very very good people, they still get it wrong

2016-10-25 13:14:57	+vdamewood	doomlord: Building on what you said, basically the computing world was in need of a minimalistic high-level language, and C was there.
2016-10-25 13:15:10	jonez	vdamewood, so they wrote assembly?

2016-10-25 13:15:35	turbo64	well even when c came out it would be a long time before people stopped using assembly

2016-10-25 13:15:51	doomlord	you used to have to write a lot more in assembly for decent performance

2016-10-25 13:49:45	Xgc	[23:22:10] piou: Depends on which industries adopt the language.  If it infiltrates large industrial or business applications, life could be very very long, similar to the COBOL installations. [23:22:10]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	imode	[23:22:25] better beverage: warm up some water to a boil, fill a cup with it halfway, pour in a lot of condensed milk, a lot of sugar, a lot of cinnamon, a lot of honey, and a few glugs of vanilla extract. [23:22:25]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	MadokaMagica	[23:22:37] Operating Systems is a bitch [23:22:37]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	imode	[23:22:42] pure calories. warms ya up inside. [23:22:42]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	MadokaMagica	[23:22:42] In Stanford it's the hardest programming class [23:22:42]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	rai_	[23:22:55] _W_: if it becomes integrated into infrastructure, then yes there will be some legacy.  The state of California still has millions of lines of Cobol code in action.  However for the most part that won't be true, especially for user-facing applications. [23:22:55]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	_W_	[23:23:35] rai_: web pages to administer phone networks? [23:23:35]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	+PlanckWalk	[23:23:36] I don't see why "useless in 20 years" is sad. [23:23:36]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	MadokaMagica	[23:23:47] For me good code is good code [23:23:47]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	MadokaMagica	[23:23:55] Don't see why some code shouldn't run for 100 years [23:23:55]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	MadokaMagica	[23:24:05] The only reason why this is abnormal is because this industry is so young [23:24:05]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	+PlanckWalk	[23:24:10] A great many very worthwhile things are useless in 20 years [23:24:10]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	MadokaMagica	[23:24:28] In many areas like web/mobile most code is under 20 years old because no one's been programming them 20 years ago [23:24:28]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	_W_	[23:24:30] I bet the same code hotswap classloader is still in use for the webpages of that phone company. If I'm lucky they put some fancy JS webpage in front of it that does calls back to the same old app [23:24:30]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	MadokaMagica	[23:24:31] They didn't exist [23:24:31]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	piou	[23:24:46] most of what I use on a day to day basis already has more than 20y anyway... [23:24:46]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	MadokaMagica	[23:24:54] Some other areas like financial institutions aren't as reliant on the latest and greatest [23:24:54]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	MadokaMagica	[23:25:01] It would be financially disadvantageous to upgrade ever year [23:25:01]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	piou	[23:25:31] I get that partly back, vim isn't as old as I thought, only 15y [23:25:31]

2016-10-25 13:49:45	xiphiasx1	[23:25:41] if anyone cares [23:25:41]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	xiphiasx1	[23:25:47] i just broke MSVC with lambda's [23:25:47]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	xiphiasx1	[23:25:55] it's a bad lambda but, a compiler crash nonetheless [23:25:55]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	turbo64	[23:26:35] man fuck msvc [23:26:35]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	MadokaMagica	[23:27:12] TO this day I still get delegates and lambda functions mixed up [23:27:12]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	piou	[23:27:24] xiphiasx1: could you get a POC? I'd like to test it with other compilers [23:27:24]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	xiphiasx1	[23:27:37] http://pastie.org/private/bopqiimatpkq8ck5zknzng [23:27:37]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	xiphiasx1	[23:27:40] bear in mind [23:27:40]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	xiphiasx1	[23:27:42] this does not even compile [23:27:42]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	xiphiasx1	[23:27:50] MSVC dies instantly upon trying [23:27:50]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	piou	[23:28:09] I don't even have MSVC ^^ [23:28:09]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	xiphiasx1	[23:28:23] actually, i'm not sure it DOES compile [23:28:23]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	xiphiasx1	[23:28:27] all i've tried is MSVC [23:28:27]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	xiphiasx1	[23:29:20] and as expected it does not, but gcc doesn't crash [23:29:20]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	piou	[23:30:25] yep [23:30:25]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	MadokaMagica	[23:32:52] Hello again [23:32:52]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	turbo64	[23:32:56] o/ [23:32:56]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	MadokaMagica	[23:34:01] Linux command line and vim made me realize just how much I missed robust modern IDEs [23:34:01]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	+vdamewood	[23:34:26] I'm happy with Sublime. [23:34:26]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	MadokaMagica	[23:34:53] From basic stuff like better scrolling and syntax checking to autocomplete and a visual debugger far better than gdb [23:34:53]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	+vdamewood	[23:35:38] That's something I would like them to add to sublime, in-GUI debugging... but for a general-language text editor, that would be a nightmare. [23:35:38]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	piou	[23:39:52] MadokaMagica: have you tried cgdb? It helps quite a lot compared to plain gdb [23:39:52]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	piou	[23:42:52] MadokaMagica: for the others things... Quite frankly every time I see someone using an IDE they just look plain slow to me, I always feel the same as when you stand behind someone that never uses keybindings when you know all of them... It's frustrating... "But couldn't you just rename that function everywhere it's used with a NULL argument, reindent and use multipoint input to refactor that out [23:42:52]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	piou	[23:42:58] nicely? No?" [23:42:58]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	piou	[23:43:44] I do acknowledge the easier learning curve though, but the effort to really learn how to use vim looks worth it to me. [23:43:44]

2016-10-25 15:33:47	MadokaMagica	[23:32:52] Hello again [23:32:52]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	turbo64	[23:32:56] o/ [23:32:56]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	MadokaMagica	[23:34:01] Linux command line and vim made me realize just how much I missed robust modern IDEs [23:34:01]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	vdamewood	[23:34:26] I'm happy with Sublime. [23:34:26]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	MadokaMagica	[23:34:53] From basic stuff like better scrolling and syntax checking to autocomplete and a visual debugger far better than gdb [23:34:53]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	vdamewood	[23:35:38] That's something I would like them to add to sublime, in-GUI debugging... but for a general-language text editor, that would be a nightmare. [23:35:38]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	piou	[23:39:52] MadokaMagica: have you tried cgdb? It helps quite a lot compared to plain gdb [23:39:52]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	piou	[23:42:52] MadokaMagica: for the others things... Quite frankly every time I see someone using an IDE they just look plain slow to me, I always feel the same as when you stand behind someone that never uses keybindings when you know all of them... It's frustrating... "But couldn't you just rename that function everywhere it's used with a NULL argument, reindent and use multipoint input to refactor that out [23:42:52]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	piou	[23:42:58] nicely? No?" [23:42:58]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	piou	[23:43:44] I do acknowledge the easier learning curve though, but the effort to really learn how to use vim looks worth it to me. [23:43:44]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	pavonia	[00:00:38] What are languages called that are able to represent all total functions with a finite domain? [00:00:38]

2016-10-25 16:41:17	bjpenn	one struggle with me is learning new programming concepts with names that have no correlation to their actual meaning.

2016-10-25 16:45:56	timemage	Chloe, it's nice to be able to have the user specify base.  the thing about atoi is there's basically no way to use it in a way that you can be sure that it won't give you undefined behaviour.

2016-10-25 17:57:02	Chloe	[03:25:12] that's what I was looking for :D thanks [03:25:12]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Chloe	[03:27:33] wow ok it's late, gnite [03:27:33]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	timemage	[03:29:30] Chloe, later. [03:29:30]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	imode	[03:33:01] jesus my site, with _minimal god damn styling_ looks entirely different in chrome and firefox. [03:33:01]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Chloe	[03:33:32] imode: sounds like you need a reset [03:33:32]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	imode	[03:33:46] the spacing on elements is totally... [03:33:46]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	imode	[03:33:51] euuuuch. [03:33:51]

2016-10-25 17:57:02	John[Lisbeth]	[03:44:18] can you run a program while it's encrypted? [03:44:18]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	BaneAliens	[03:48:40] anyone ever had an interview at google mountain view? Do you guys think it is necessary to have a rental car if you are staying at a hotel in MV? [03:48:40]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Love4Boobies	[03:56:22] According to GCC's warnings, "int foo; for (...) if (setjmp(bar) == 0)" can clobber foo, even though I thought it wouldn't because setjmp in the loop's scope. [03:56:22]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Love4Boobies	[03:56:42] I can't make it volatile because it's actually a pointer, which I need to maybe free and definitely return. [03:56:42]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Love4Boobies	[03:56:55] Any suggestions other than moveing the loop in a helper function? [03:56:55]

However I don't understand why the pre-handshake exploit is suppose to work? Isn't the whole point, to keep alive a connection to avoid renegotiating handshake?

2016-10-26 04:13:13	Batholith	I'm in a bit of a conundrum. I want to follow Mozilla's guidelines but when implementing a 3D vector, it doesn't really make sense in my head to have a getter for the vectors. And if I instead made the vectors public, I'd have to rename the vectors to x, y, and z instead of mX, mY, mZ which would break the guidelines again.

2016-10-26 06:51:21	unvexp	I'm planning on writing a code to read a json response from a url, save it to a sql database, and process it for statistical use (thousands of data to read and process). I know most popular languages today can do that. And as far as I understand, Python is easy but can be slow, Java adds unecessary use of the processor, and C is far low level for that. Do you guys have any suggestions? Should I pick
2016-10-26 06:51:23	unvexp	Python over C?

2016-10-26 08:29:08	frib	pilne, if these messages are successfully sent to an active window, shouldn't it be possible to send them to an inactive window (as is possible with other linux applications) regardless of the windows side of things?
2016-10-26 08:29:36	frib	the simple test would be to hardcode in the ID of an inactive window
2016-10-26 08:29:41	pilne	in theory, yes, but you are way deeper in the rabbit hole than i've even thought about tbh.

2016-10-26 08:30:53	Dark_Fox	Well, I know that in Windows, the Window ID is generated at run time

2016-10-26 09:03:15	Bilz	i'm working on a google programming challenge that involves computing many many xor's.... i've sort of filtered out all the gibberish of the problem into this short pastebin with two examples here: http://pastebin.com/viKtLU45 . I've come up with a solution, but I think it takes O(n^2) time to solve (im new to this terminology so this maybe wrong). anyway, it takes too long and I'm guessing there is a quicker way. I was wondering
2016-10-26 09:03:15	Bilz	 whether I can xor the first column in the "matrix" and some how from that deduce the xor of the second column of the "matrix" quickly
2016-10-26 09:03:48	Bilz	if anyone has any advice or guidance, it would be much appreciated
