2016-10-17 16:10:07	j25	Hey, basic question. It seems like adding an unsigned number and a signed number together works. e.g. if I have a 3-bit unsigned number 7 (111), and a 3-bit signed number -3 (101), adding them returns 4 (100) with a carry bit. Is this true? Why is it?

2016-10-17 16:24:10	Zuu	the bitmask i have, that i want to apply to 32 bit int, is 11000000110000001100000011000000, meaning that the resulting int will only have 28 of the bits, of any integer that i want to apply this "remove" operation on

2016-10-17 16:24:59	Zuu	nope, contigouous would have been done in two ops
2016-10-17 16:25:16	okuu	Is there some standard algorithm using for escaping/unescaping string literals in most languages, or do they all differ in subtle ways?

2016-10-17 16:26:19	+PlanckWalk	Some in not at all subtle ways
2016-10-17 16:26:21	Zuu	so the goal, is to do this 4 piece pattern, in, hopefully less than 7 ops :>

2016-10-17 16:30:39	okuu	What do you guys think about allowing identifiers beginning with a digit?
2016-10-17 16:31:05	okuu	When writing numeric code, I often wanted to define variables like “2h”.
2016-10-17 16:31:38	okuu	But, no, most languages don't allow it, so I had to settle for “h2”, which could be confused (in intent) with “h_2”.
2016-10-17 16:31:57	+PlanckWalk	_2h? :-)
2016-10-17 16:32:10	okuu	That's horrifying.
2016-10-17 16:32:16	+PlanckWalk	I know! ;-)

2016-10-17 16:33:22	okuu	Anyway, the new tokenization rule would actually be simpler: lump all alphanumeric characters together. If the result can be converted to an integer, it's an integer. If not, it's an identifier.
2016-10-17 16:33:53	okuu	Errr, correction: read all contiguous alphanumeric characters.

2016-10-17 16:37:04	okuu	Screw that. Want a double? Use 1.0e6. Or something like that.
2016-10-17 16:37:21	okuu	Actually, I'm lying. I'm not even thinking about doubles.
2016-10-17 16:38:01	okuu	I really need to think seriously about what characters I want in identifiers, though.
2016-10-17 16:38:11	okuu	I like how Lisp can use identifiers-like-this.
