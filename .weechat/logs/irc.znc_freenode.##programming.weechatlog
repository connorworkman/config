2016-10-17 16:10:07	j25	Hey, basic question. It seems like adding an unsigned number and a signed number together works. e.g. if I have a 3-bit unsigned number 7 (111), and a 3-bit signed number -3 (101), adding them returns 4 (100) with a carry bit. Is this true? Why is it?

2016-10-17 16:30:39	okuu	What do you guys think about allowing identifiers beginning with a digit?
2016-10-17 16:31:05	okuu	When writing numeric code, I often wanted to define variables like “2h”.
2016-10-17 16:31:38	okuu	But, no, most languages don't allow it, so I had to settle for “h2”, which could be confused (in intent) with “h_2”.

2016-10-17 16:33:53	okuu	Errr, correction: read all contiguous alphanumeric characters.

2016-10-17 18:15:50	Sircle	Hi
2016-10-17 18:15:56	Sircle	Should the datetime of postgres/database used or datetime generated on serverside(java) be used. Each has its own pros and cons. 10 servers, each will have a different date time. If we go to PG side, is it possible to generate every date time (not just auto generated timestamp for each insert/update)? any others?

2016-10-17 18:27:45	soulisson	Hi, can anyone help me? My english is not great and I'm trying to learn Android dev. In the documentation, an activity is defined as "An Activity is an application component that provides a screen with which users can interact in order to do something, such as dial the phone, take a photo, ...". So is an activity a class, or the object we get when we instantiate the class?
2016-10-17 18:27:53	Sircle	_W_:  so set the time stamp from server side and sync all servers to one time stamp?

2016-10-17 21:03:35	okuu	[05:51:05] When in doubt, make your code look like Windows file paths. [05:51:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	hanshenrik	[05:51:34] that's what PHP did. no joke. [05:51:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	okuu	[05:54:29] hanshenrik: Also: “Can't be arsed providing actual documentation. Will just provide a shitty example. Hope you can make sense of it. To protect my ass against accusations that the code is shit, I'm saying that the instructions here are mere guidelines.” [05:54:29]

2016-10-18 01:34:09	Rashad	Recurrence can be solved with a "flag" for the time slot, and perhaps "exceptions" can also be used to override some recurrence for special cases.
2016-10-18 01:34:09	+vendu	vdamewood, so basically, they should be called FINNS and nothing else :P

2016-10-18 01:38:10	Rashad	Perhaps the service provider can restrict reservations to either minutes or days, then if he/she chooses days, he is to choose which days of the week then add exceptions as they arise, while for minutes you choose times of each day of the week and then do the same for exceptions.

2016-10-18 02:25:06	keller_k1nd	mvaenskae: a buffer overflow happens if you allocate some memory, but write beyond that allocated area
2016-10-18 02:25:12	dminuoso_	And the above implementation HAS CHAR_BIT 16.
2016-10-18 02:25:22	dminuoso_	Just to show its not just theoretical.
2016-10-18 02:25:37	Zeno`	vdamewood, no because somewhere else in the standard it says that short > char
2016-10-18 02:25:47	vdamewood	Zeno`: No, short >= char
2016-10-18 02:25:54	mvaenskae	keller_k1nd: so the buffer overflow happens due to reading too many chars for each string (in this case actually reading even a single char to the char* is causing a theoretical overflow, right?

2016-10-18 02:39:05	Zeno`	mvaenskae, here's something to ponder. I more robust way of using malloc, instead of using sizeof(specifictype), is to do something like....     int *mymem;  mymem = malloc(NUM_ELEMENTS * sizeof *mymem);

2016-10-18 04:44:58	mmlj4	B3nszy: come up with a file format (colon-delimited is best), or better yet use a database... MySQL, SQLite, etc.
2016-10-18 04:45:01	B3nszy	I missed the class on it and the book is confusing
2016-10-18 04:45:06	mmlj4	also, JSON works
2016-10-18 04:45:15	B3nszy	this is intro to programming

2016-10-18 04:45:52	mmlj4	you could write to /dev/null and read your data back from /dev/random
2016-10-18 04:46:02	csd_	if i say that i've implemented a messaging protocol (zmq), does that imply that i've written the library, or that i've integrated it with my application? going for the latter
2016-10-18 04:46:03	+vendu	Zeno`, hehe it's the only reason i'm using floating-point math in the kernel :P
2016-10-18 04:46:17	Zeno`	vendu, it doesn't use floating point
2016-10-18 04:46:19	+vendu	Zeno`, so i hacked together a couple of functions using i387 asm too =)
2016-10-18 04:46:23	Zeno`	err... 'cept to make the LUT
2016-10-18 04:46:27	+vendu	Zeno`, ceil() and sin() :)

2016-10-18 04:47:11	vdamewood	If I were to design a new architecture, I would make it so that floats and ints used the same registers.
2016-10-18 04:47:19	+vendu	Zeno`, great idea, we should do that later on =)

2016-10-18 10:27:16	mistralol	but i actually find its not so much the dev's. It is the leads dont give the right people the right work or the right support to people when they need it

2016-10-18 10:30:25	mistralol	true but the grad is untested in such matters

2016-10-18 10:38:13	Shayanjm	Yes, correct, but a lot of development today requires domain knowledge
2016-10-18 10:38:16	deniska	and lately it's much easier to teach chemists to write programs than chemistry to programmers

2016-10-18 10:50:17	mistralol	Dark_Fox: yeah so any devloper when faced with that basically cooks the books
2016-10-18 10:50:30	Dark_Fox	Shayanjm: Then why are you bothering with a discussion about what constitutes a good developer?
2016-10-18 10:50:39	+vendu	hello again, everyone =)
2016-10-18 10:50:40	btborg	You can look up C libraries in man, and it just works
2016-10-18 10:50:41	Dark_Fox	mistralol: Yeah, pretty much
2016-10-18 10:50:42	purplex88	sbrg: can i choose either one? i didn't find an example yet
2016-10-18 10:50:49	Shayanjm	Dark_Fox: to find out how to recruit more of them?
2016-10-18 10:51:04	Dark_Fox	mistralol: A lot of the Agile-bashing I see is based around that metric-lawyering, though
2016-10-18 10:51:04	Shayanjm	It's a very good question that should have real answers without devolving into a pissing contest
2016-10-18 10:51:07	mistralol	Dark_Fox: when i moved job I had never actually heard the term "sand bagging" before
2016-10-18 10:51:09	sbrg	purplex88: the point is, if I have two sorted lists and I merge them, it doesn't matter that one is larger than the other
2016-10-18 10:51:22	ario	i've been working on the same bug for 3 weeks now at work lol
2016-10-18 10:51:24	ario	:<

2016-10-18 10:52:09	sbrg	merge sort splits the array into pieces until it has pieces of length 1 to deal with. it merges that into an array of size 2 which is sorted. it will then eventually have two arrays that are of length 2 which are sorted, which it can also merge(because they are sorted), etc etc

2016-10-18 10:52:49	mistralol	Dark_Fox: aka when you don't have work in your current sprint and start taking from the backlog.... So the stuff ont he backlog is already done for the next sprint

2016-10-18 10:52:59	+vendu	btborg, if you wanna see some nice os code, get the lions book :)
2016-10-18 10:53:03	sbrg	normally, you just do     iMiddle = (iEnd + iBegin) / 2;              // iMiddle = mid point (copied directly from wikipedia) which is integer division, so it's rounded down
2016-10-18 10:53:09	Dark_Fox	mistralol: Ahh

2016-10-18 10:53:19	purplex88	sbrg: because of less number of comparsions?

2016-10-18 10:55:46	rindolf	sbrg: insertion sort is pretty good for small data sets.
2016-10-18 10:55:48	+vendu	in fact, let me find some of those for you =)

2016-10-18 10:56:09	mistralol	I cannot recall who asked. But yeah i think its not hard to find a good dev. So long as a company is prepared to pay
2016-10-18 10:56:14	sbrg	rindolf: yeah, there's definitely a usecase for almost all sorting algorithms. except bubble sort.

2016-10-18 11:26:29	Dark_Fox	I think some manner of programming test or technical questions are useful, just to make sure they aren't lying on the resume, but beyond that the interview should be more about good work habits and culture fit
2016-10-18 11:26:30	Rounin	My first one did sort of a pseudo one... It tested numerical comprehension and language comprehension and perhaps logic
2016-10-18 11:26:38	Dark_Fox	Wow, jeez

2016-10-18 11:27:50	Rounin	Personally I went to university
2016-10-18 11:28:01	Dark_Fox	Well, more like seeing if they arrive on time, or if not, if they give you prior notice that they'll be late.  If they have projects they're showing you, or during the programming test, if they document and layout their code in a well organized manner
2016-10-18 11:28:08	Rounin	Though I did program as a hobby before that, and I used, for instance, a book on QuickBASIC

2016-10-18 12:21:51	bizarrefish	yes, true. it's about breaking the execution of the script up so that, for example, 'isEnemyInFront' could appear as a blocking getter method to the scripting environment, but it actually ends up saving a continuation somewhere and resuming when the data is available
2016-10-18 12:23:07	bizarrefish	i guess I am talking about a narrow usage of free monads here, as simple ways to implement suspend/resume

2016-10-18 12:23:33	sbrg	so, in one scenario, when the user writes "isEnemyFront", execution is blocked on communication with some thread, while in the other, you basically have an entire AST parsed that you ship off to the execution environment which is then executed there and the results are returned once it's finished?
2016-10-18 12:25:17	sbrg	Because that doesn't sound like "free monads" specifically. that just sounds like a generic design decision that has little to do with monads or anything else. maybe i'm not getting it

2016-10-18 12:25:29	bizarrefish	i think im being unclear. in the threading approach, they would be writing in the same language as the simulator. there wouldnt be a need to parse what they write, but having it run in a separate thread would allow the main thread to control the execution
2016-10-18 12:26:15	bizarrefish	rather than if it was running in the main thread, where their code would need to reflect the control flow of the simulator
2016-10-18 12:27:07	bizarrefish	the free monad / interpreter approach would be another way of decoupling these things

2016-10-18 18:32:10	bjpenn	i guess its converting it into something that only pickle can understand
2016-10-18 18:32:16	+PlanckWalk	Yes, Python's pickling is a particular form of serialization
2016-10-18 18:32:33	curl	When information is sent over the Internet, it is generally broken up into smaller pieces or "packets". The use of packets facilitates speedy transmission since different parts of a message can be sent by different routes and then reassembled at the destination. It is also a safety measure to minimize the chances of losing information in the transmission process. TCP is the means for creating the packets, putting them back togethe
2016-10-18 18:32:57	bjpenn	i guess i dont understand why you would use pickle to create a binary when you can just output the strings into a plaintext file

2016-10-18 19:42:04	MisterSyntax	now that i think about it more, "to implement" could also be written as "to merge" or "to integrate" or "to use with". say you're implementing new features, then you're essentially just adding new features into the existing system. so implementing class A on class B means adding the 'feature/functionalities' of class A to class B
