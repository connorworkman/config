2016-10-17 12:36:12	kazagistar	sure it is

2016-10-17 12:36:21	Zuu	how?
2016-10-17 12:36:37	kazagistar	there is a way to convert any lookaround into a normal nfa
2016-10-17 12:36:49	sbrg	kazagistar: I see. IIRC, there have been some people implementing regex engines via "derivatives" which I don't think allow for all those complicated features. but they are supposedly more efficient. maybe that is of some interest?
2016-10-17 12:36:58	Zuu	i think i will have a look at that then.
