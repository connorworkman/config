2016-10-17 13:36:06	minimalism	Noticed before I logged off yesterday that one init script for macchanger doesn't seem to want to go off before vpn
2016-10-17 13:36:06		[13:36]
2016-10-17 13:36:49	<--	minimalism (~none@unaffiliated/minimalism) has quit (Client Quit)
2016-10-17 13:37:05	-->	minimalism (~none@unaffiliated/minimalism) is back on server
2016-10-17 13:43:00		[13:37]
2016-10-17 13:57:34	alyptik	you change your mac?
2016-10-17 14:03:00		[13:57]
2016-10-17 14:04:15	minimalism	yeah
2016-10-17 14:04:20	minimalism	I had it set on arch to change on boot
2016-10-17 14:04:25	minimalism	then start vpn
2016-10-17 14:05:36	alyptik	ah and using openrc right? i don't have much experience with writing inits for that
2016-10-17 14:11:00		[14:05]
2016-10-17 14:17:00		[14:11]
2016-10-17 14:27:15	minimalism	I wrote one for it with just a start() function
2016-10-17 14:28:00	minimalism	but it's something that just fires once, can't be stopped or anything
2016-10-17 14:28:52	alyptik	ah
2016-10-17 14:29:01	alyptik	weird, maybe there is a race condition or something
2016-10-17 14:35:00		[14:29]
2016-10-17 14:44:46	minimalism	I set a before and after
2016-10-17 14:44:56	minimalism	it's probably some difference of behavior in booting
2016-10-17 14:45:15	minimalism	an odd thing I noticed is it seems.. "seems" to be able to change MAC on an interface that is currently up
2016-10-17 14:45:22	minimalism	without going up and down
2016-10-17 14:45:29	minimalism	it didn't work that way on arch
2016-10-17 14:45:40	alyptik	that shouldn't work .-.
2016-10-17 14:46:08	minimalism	people don't think it be like it is, but it do
2016-10-17 14:46:15	alyptik	lol
2016-10-17 14:46:29	minimalism	I just did it
2016-10-17 14:46:38	alyptik	well i guess it would be ok for you but your router would freak out afaik
2016-10-17 14:46:49	alyptik	ARP tables would be f'ed up 
2016-10-17 14:47:55	minimalism	 /etc/init.d/macchanger restart
2016-10-17 14:47:56	minimalism	New MAC: *redacted*         [ ok ]
2016-10-17 14:47:56	<--	minimalism (~none@unaffiliated/minimalism) has quit (Quit: minimalism)
2016-10-17 14:49:36	-->	minimalism (~none@unaffiliated/minimalism) is back on server
2016-10-17 14:51:19	minimalism	Apparently it doesn't work. It just looks like it does.. which is weird
2016-10-17 14:51:19		[14:51]
2016-10-17 14:51:38	alyptik	yeah it is strange it didn't throw an error
2016-10-17 14:51:50	minimalism	It still shows the VPN as on and everything
2016-10-17 14:51:53	minimalism	even changes the MAC
2016-10-17 14:52:03	minimalism	everything looks alright until you actually try using something requiring a connection
2016-10-17 14:52:06	minimalism	then it's just hanging
2016-10-17 14:52:53	alyptik	yeah the arp handler on your router prob was freaking out
2016-10-17 14:58:00		[14:52]
2016-10-17 14:59:53	minimalism	beginning to worry I did something making gentoo not use my GPU
2016-10-17 15:00:04	minimalism	it may just be a bug with screenfetch but unsure
2016-10-17 15:00:13	alyptik	huh how come
2016-10-17 15:00:27	minimalism	screenfetch isn't returning my GPU except in root, however
2016-10-17 15:00:38	minimalism	a lot of commands used to return hardware information are restricted in gentoo
2016-10-17 15:00:42	minimalism	they're unusable outside of root
2016-10-17 15:00:56	minimalism	blkid, lspci, etc.
2016-10-17 15:00:59	minimalism	won't tell you anything
2016-10-17 15:01:43	alyptik	from the script:
2016-10-17 15:01:43	alyptik	gpu_info=$($(PATH="/usr/bin:$PATH" type -p lspci | cut -f1) 2> /dev/null | grep VGA)
2016-10-17 15:01:51	alyptik	see if that works for you without root
2016-10-17 15:03:08	minimalism	seems awfully intricate for whatever that does
2016-10-17 15:03:11	minimalism	with lspci
2016-10-17 15:03:45	alyptik	prob meant to portable as possible
2016-10-17 15:03:50	minimalism	It doesn't work though
2016-10-17 15:04:03	alyptik	ah i guess lspci is root only
2016-10-17 15:04:03	minimalism	lspci is just plain restricted outside of root.. mentioned something similar in gentoo about blkid the other day
2016-10-17 15:04:09	minimalism	they claim it's not restricted, but
2016-10-17 15:04:15	minimalism	it got into a semantic argument
2016-10-17 15:04:38	minimalism	I know it's detecting the card as being there, however
2016-10-17 15:04:45	minimalism	I'm trying to think of a definitive way to see it's being used
2016-10-17 15:04:50	minimalism	right now in action on X and with any graphical program
2016-10-17 15:05:21	alyptik	try grep -i --color memory /var/log/Xorg.0.log 
2016-10-17 15:05:58	alyptik	or wherever your xorg log it
2016-10-17 15:06:01	alyptik	s/it/is
2016-10-17 15:07:42	minimalism	you know you can just set grep colors in env
2016-10-17 15:07:59	alyptik	just pasting from my aliases file
2016-10-17 15:08:08	alyptik	that is an old one gpumeminfo= lol
2016-10-17 15:08:17	minimalism	you're looking for the word "memory" in those files?
2016-10-17 15:08:19	minimalism	why
2016-10-17 15:08:43	alyptik	i have no clue tbh
2016-10-17 15:08:53	alyptik	i just grepped gpu in my aliases file
2016-10-17 15:09:33	alyptik	i think that alias is from like 2 years ago; so if it doesn't work not surprsed
2016-10-17 15:10:34	minimalism	I've looked through xorg log before and saw mentions of radeon but I'm getting suspicious since it doesn't mention my exact model
2016-10-17 15:10:40	minimalism	and it tries to load vesa for some reason
2016-10-17 15:11:16	alyptik	don't know enough about ati to know what vesa is
2016-10-17 15:11:39	minimalism	vesa and mesa
2016-10-17 15:12:06	alyptik	oh and ati doesn't use vesa?
2016-10-17 15:12:13	minimalism	I don't think so
2016-10-17 15:12:19	minimalism	I think it's a nvidia thing
2016-10-17 15:14:41	minimalism	I can't wait to see how efficiently this system runs when I'm done trimming packages with USE flags, fully completing a perfect kernel config, a solid initramfs
2016-10-17 15:14:41		[15:14]
2016-10-17 15:14:49	minimalism	some looking over firmware loaded etc.
2016-10-17 15:14:52	minimalism	removing a fuckton of modules
2016-10-17 15:15:11	alyptik	kernel config is an art
2016-10-17 15:15:20	alyptik	where rice meets useful
2016-10-17 15:15:29	minimalism	The besy way to do it is probably remove everything then go from there
2016-10-17 15:15:31	minimalism	best*
2016-10-17 15:15:53	alyptik	i like to start from makelocalmod config
2016-10-17 15:16:01	alyptik	make localmodconfig*
2016-10-17 15:16:13	minimalism	I'm not familiar
2016-10-17 15:16:34	alyptik	it sets every module not currently loaded to N
2016-10-17 15:16:49	minimalism	Ahh, that's what I've been wanting
2016-10-17 15:16:55	minimalism	I should boot arch and then run that
2016-10-17 15:17:03	minimalism	it'll give me a better idea of what I don't need
2016-10-17 15:17:07	minimalism	then trim some more for gentoo
2016-10-17 15:17:09	alyptik	and afaik it does make oldconfig for the rest
2016-10-17 15:21:17	alyptik	do you bother with cgroups?
2016-10-17 15:21:24	alyptik	trying to decide if worth learning
2016-10-17 15:21:49	minimalism	haven't looked into them at all
2016-10-17 15:22:07	minimalism	Did you get tox working?
2016-10-17 15:22:13	alyptik	yup
2016-10-17 15:22:25	alyptik	was pretty painless
2016-10-17 15:22:33	alyptik	looked at config but didn't touch
2016-10-17 15:22:38	alyptik	didn't really know what does what yet
2016-10-17 15:22:58	minimalism	I basically just changed its default or not color setting
2016-10-17 15:23:04	minimalism	change time_format and timestamp_fornat
2016-10-17 15:23:10	minimalism	the characters displayed for line_*
2016-10-17 15:23:17	minimalism	changed the away_note to AFK
2016-10-17 15:23:27	minimalism	set the input/output device numbers
2016-10-17 15:23:37	minimalism	set my download_path for where to save transferred files
2016-10-17 15:23:42	minimalism	set my path to my avatar image
2016-10-17 15:24:02	minimalism	then after that it's basically just some keybinds for stuff, and able to set custom sound files
2016-10-17 15:30:00		[15:24]
2016-10-17 15:39:13	alyptik	what is the arch of Gentoo Linux Alpha Handbook
2016-10-17 15:39:30	alyptik	doesn't really say
2016-10-17 15:40:38	alyptik	it says 64-bit but i don't understand if it is x86_64 or a seperate proprietary one
2016-10-17 15:42:34	minimalism	no idea
2016-10-17 15:42:40	minimalism	I just read amd64 and Linux Sea
2016-10-17 15:43:34	alyptik	oh googling finally turned up something; it is some obscure proprietary one
2016-10-17 15:43:42	alyptik	name is misleading
2016-10-17 15:49:00		[15:43]
2016-10-17 16:27:56	minimalism	trying to determine if I need egl support enabled
2016-10-17 16:27:56		[16:27]
2016-10-17 16:28:00	minimalism	mpv is claiming it's not on
2016-10-17 16:31:21	minimalism	>mpv running >mpd+ncmpcpp running >tmux+weechat+toxic running >chromium running >850 MiB RAM used
2016-10-17 16:31:24	minimalism	that's what's up
2016-10-17 16:37:00		[16:31]
2016-10-17 16:43:53	alyptik	sorry was eating
2016-10-17 16:44:13	alyptik	i do like egl more than glc
2016-10-17 16:44:16	alyptik	glx*
2016-10-17 16:44:21	alyptik	but not needed i think
2016-10-17 16:50:00		[16:44]
