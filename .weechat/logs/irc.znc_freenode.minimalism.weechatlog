2016-10-17 13:36:06	minimalism	Noticed before I logged off yesterday that one init script for macchanger doesn't seem to want to go off before vpn
2016-10-17 13:36:06		[13:36]
2016-10-17 13:36:49	<--	minimalism (~none@unaffiliated/minimalism) has quit (Client Quit)
2016-10-17 13:37:05	-->	minimalism (~none@unaffiliated/minimalism) is back on server
2016-10-17 13:43:00		[13:37]
2016-10-17 13:57:34	alyptik	you change your mac?
2016-10-17 14:03:00		[13:57]
2016-10-17 14:04:15	minimalism	yeah
2016-10-17 14:04:20	minimalism	I had it set on arch to change on boot
2016-10-17 14:04:25	minimalism	then start vpn
2016-10-17 14:05:36	alyptik	ah and using openrc right? i don't have much experience with writing inits for that
2016-10-17 14:11:00		[14:05]
2016-10-17 14:17:00		[14:11]
2016-10-17 14:27:15	minimalism	I wrote one for it with just a start() function
2016-10-17 14:28:00	minimalism	but it's something that just fires once, can't be stopped or anything
2016-10-17 14:28:52	alyptik	ah
2016-10-17 14:29:01	alyptik	weird, maybe there is a race condition or something
2016-10-17 14:35:00		[14:29]
2016-10-17 14:44:46	minimalism	I set a before and after
2016-10-17 14:44:56	minimalism	it's probably some difference of behavior in booting
2016-10-17 14:45:15	minimalism	an odd thing I noticed is it seems.. "seems" to be able to change MAC on an interface that is currently up
2016-10-17 14:45:22	minimalism	without going up and down
2016-10-17 14:45:29	minimalism	it didn't work that way on arch
2016-10-17 14:45:40	alyptik	that shouldn't work .-.
2016-10-17 14:46:08	minimalism	people don't think it be like it is, but it do
2016-10-17 14:46:15	alyptik	lol
2016-10-17 14:46:29	minimalism	I just did it
2016-10-17 14:46:38	alyptik	well i guess it would be ok for you but your router would freak out afaik
2016-10-17 14:46:49	alyptik	ARP tables would be f'ed up 
2016-10-17 14:47:55	minimalism	 /etc/init.d/macchanger restart
2016-10-17 14:47:56	minimalism	New MAC: *redacted*         [ ok ]
2016-10-17 14:47:56	<--	minimalism (~none@unaffiliated/minimalism) has quit (Quit: minimalism)
2016-10-17 14:49:36	-->	minimalism (~none@unaffiliated/minimalism) is back on server
2016-10-17 14:51:19	minimalism	Apparently it doesn't work. It just looks like it does.. which is weird
2016-10-17 14:51:19		[14:51]
2016-10-17 14:51:38	alyptik	yeah it is strange it didn't throw an error
2016-10-17 14:51:50	minimalism	It still shows the VPN as on and everything
2016-10-17 14:51:53	minimalism	even changes the MAC
2016-10-17 14:52:03	minimalism	everything looks alright until you actually try using something requiring a connection
2016-10-17 14:52:06	minimalism	then it's just hanging
2016-10-17 14:52:53	alyptik	yeah the arp handler on your router prob was freaking out
