2016-10-17 13:36:06	minimalism	Noticed before I logged off yesterday that one init script for macchanger doesn't seem to want to go off before vpn
2016-10-17 13:36:06		[13:36]
2016-10-17 13:36:49	<--	minimalism (~none@unaffiliated/minimalism) has quit (Client Quit)
2016-10-17 13:37:05	-->	minimalism (~none@unaffiliated/minimalism) is back on server
2016-10-17 13:43:00		[13:37]
2016-10-17 13:57:34	alyptik	you change your mac?
2016-10-17 14:03:00		[13:57]
2016-10-17 14:04:15	minimalism	yeah
2016-10-17 14:04:20	minimalism	I had it set on arch to change on boot
2016-10-17 14:04:25	minimalism	then start vpn
2016-10-17 14:05:36	alyptik	ah and using openrc right? i don't have much experience with writing inits for that
2016-10-17 14:11:00		[14:05]
2016-10-17 14:17:00		[14:11]
2016-10-17 14:27:15	minimalism	I wrote one for it with just a start() function
2016-10-17 14:28:00	minimalism	but it's something that just fires once, can't be stopped or anything
2016-10-17 14:28:52	alyptik	ah
2016-10-17 14:29:01	alyptik	weird, maybe there is a race condition or something
2016-10-17 14:35:00		[14:29]
2016-10-17 14:44:46	minimalism	I set a before and after
2016-10-17 14:44:56	minimalism	it's probably some difference of behavior in booting
2016-10-17 14:45:15	minimalism	an odd thing I noticed is it seems.. "seems" to be able to change MAC on an interface that is currently up
2016-10-17 14:45:22	minimalism	without going up and down
2016-10-17 14:45:29	minimalism	it didn't work that way on arch
2016-10-17 14:45:40	alyptik	that shouldn't work .-.
2016-10-17 14:46:08	minimalism	people don't think it be like it is, but it do
2016-10-17 14:46:15	alyptik	lol
2016-10-17 14:46:29	minimalism	I just did it
2016-10-17 14:46:38	alyptik	well i guess it would be ok for you but your router would freak out afaik
2016-10-17 14:46:49	alyptik	ARP tables would be f'ed up 
2016-10-17 14:47:55	minimalism	 /etc/init.d/macchanger restart
2016-10-17 14:47:56	minimalism	New MAC: *redacted*         [ ok ]
2016-10-17 14:47:56	<--	minimalism (~none@unaffiliated/minimalism) has quit (Quit: minimalism)
2016-10-17 14:49:36	-->	minimalism (~none@unaffiliated/minimalism) is back on server
2016-10-17 14:51:19	minimalism	Apparently it doesn't work. It just looks like it does.. which is weird
2016-10-17 14:51:19		[14:51]
2016-10-17 14:51:38	alyptik	yeah it is strange it didn't throw an error
2016-10-17 14:51:50	minimalism	It still shows the VPN as on and everything
2016-10-17 14:51:53	minimalism	even changes the MAC
2016-10-17 14:52:03	minimalism	everything looks alright until you actually try using something requiring a connection
2016-10-17 14:52:06	minimalism	then it's just hanging
2016-10-17 14:52:53	alyptik	yeah the arp handler on your router prob was freaking out
2016-10-17 14:58:00		[14:52]
2016-10-17 14:59:53	minimalism	beginning to worry I did something making gentoo not use my GPU
2016-10-17 15:00:04	minimalism	it may just be a bug with screenfetch but unsure
2016-10-17 15:00:13	alyptik	huh how come
2016-10-17 15:00:27	minimalism	screenfetch isn't returning my GPU except in root, however
2016-10-17 15:00:38	minimalism	a lot of commands used to return hardware information are restricted in gentoo
2016-10-17 15:00:42	minimalism	they're unusable outside of root
2016-10-17 15:00:56	minimalism	blkid, lspci, etc.
2016-10-17 15:00:59	minimalism	won't tell you anything
2016-10-17 15:01:43	alyptik	from the script:
2016-10-17 15:01:43	alyptik	gpu_info=$($(PATH="/usr/bin:$PATH" type -p lspci | cut -f1) 2> /dev/null | grep VGA)
2016-10-17 15:01:51	alyptik	see if that works for you without root
2016-10-17 15:03:08	minimalism	seems awfully intricate for whatever that does
2016-10-17 15:03:11	minimalism	with lspci
2016-10-17 15:03:45	alyptik	prob meant to portable as possible
2016-10-17 15:03:50	minimalism	It doesn't work though
2016-10-17 15:04:03	alyptik	ah i guess lspci is root only
2016-10-17 15:04:03	minimalism	lspci is just plain restricted outside of root.. mentioned something similar in gentoo about blkid the other day
2016-10-17 15:04:09	minimalism	they claim it's not restricted, but
2016-10-17 15:04:15	minimalism	it got into a semantic argument
2016-10-17 15:04:38	minimalism	I know it's detecting the card as being there, however
2016-10-17 15:04:45	minimalism	I'm trying to think of a definitive way to see it's being used
2016-10-17 15:04:50	minimalism	right now in action on X and with any graphical program
2016-10-17 15:05:21	alyptik	try grep -i --color memory /var/log/Xorg.0.log 
2016-10-17 15:05:58	alyptik	or wherever your xorg log it
2016-10-17 15:06:01	alyptik	s/it/is
2016-10-17 15:07:42	minimalism	you know you can just set grep colors in env
2016-10-17 15:07:59	alyptik	just pasting from my aliases file
2016-10-17 15:08:08	alyptik	that is an old one gpumeminfo= lol
2016-10-17 15:08:17	minimalism	you're looking for the word "memory" in those files?
2016-10-17 15:08:19	minimalism	why
2016-10-17 15:08:43	alyptik	i have no clue tbh
2016-10-17 15:08:53	alyptik	i just grepped gpu in my aliases file
2016-10-17 15:09:33	alyptik	i think that alias is from like 2 years ago; so if it doesn't work not surprsed
2016-10-17 15:10:34	minimalism	I've looked through xorg log before and saw mentions of radeon but I'm getting suspicious since it doesn't mention my exact model
2016-10-17 15:10:40	minimalism	and it tries to load vesa for some reason
2016-10-17 15:11:16	alyptik	don't know enough about ati to know what vesa is
2016-10-17 15:11:39	minimalism	vesa and mesa
2016-10-17 15:12:06	alyptik	oh and ati doesn't use vesa?
2016-10-17 15:12:13	minimalism	I don't think so
2016-10-17 15:12:19	minimalism	I think it's a nvidia thing
2016-10-17 15:14:41	minimalism	I can't wait to see how efficiently this system runs when I'm done trimming packages with USE flags, fully completing a perfect kernel config, a solid initramfs
2016-10-17 15:14:41		[15:14]
2016-10-17 15:14:49	minimalism	some looking over firmware loaded etc.
2016-10-17 15:14:52	minimalism	removing a fuckton of modules
2016-10-17 15:15:11	alyptik	kernel config is an art
2016-10-17 15:15:20	alyptik	where rice meets useful
2016-10-17 15:15:29	minimalism	The besy way to do it is probably remove everything then go from there
2016-10-17 15:15:31	minimalism	best*
2016-10-17 15:15:53	alyptik	i like to start from makelocalmod config
2016-10-17 15:16:01	alyptik	make localmodconfig*
2016-10-17 15:16:13	minimalism	I'm not familiar
2016-10-17 15:16:34	alyptik	it sets every module not currently loaded to N
2016-10-17 15:16:49	minimalism	Ahh, that's what I've been wanting
2016-10-17 15:16:55	minimalism	I should boot arch and then run that
2016-10-17 15:17:03	minimalism	it'll give me a better idea of what I don't need
2016-10-17 15:17:07	minimalism	then trim some more for gentoo
2016-10-17 15:17:09	alyptik	and afaik it does make oldconfig for the rest
2016-10-17 15:21:17	alyptik	do you bother with cgroups?
2016-10-17 15:21:24	alyptik	trying to decide if worth learning
2016-10-17 15:21:49	minimalism	haven't looked into them at all
2016-10-17 15:22:07	minimalism	Did you get tox working?
2016-10-17 15:22:13	alyptik	yup
2016-10-17 15:22:25	alyptik	was pretty painless
2016-10-17 15:22:33	alyptik	looked at config but didn't touch
2016-10-17 15:22:38	alyptik	didn't really know what does what yet
2016-10-17 15:22:58	minimalism	I basically just changed its default or not color setting
2016-10-17 15:23:04	minimalism	change time_format and timestamp_fornat
2016-10-17 15:23:10	minimalism	the characters displayed for line_*
2016-10-17 15:23:17	minimalism	changed the away_note to AFK
2016-10-17 15:23:27	minimalism	set the input/output device numbers
2016-10-17 15:23:37	minimalism	set my download_path for where to save transferred files
2016-10-17 15:23:42	minimalism	set my path to my avatar image
2016-10-17 15:24:02	minimalism	then after that it's basically just some keybinds for stuff, and able to set custom sound files
2016-10-17 15:30:00		[15:24]
2016-10-17 15:39:13	alyptik	what is the arch of Gentoo Linux Alpha Handbook
2016-10-17 15:39:30	alyptik	doesn't really say
2016-10-17 15:40:38	alyptik	it says 64-bit but i don't understand if it is x86_64 or a seperate proprietary one
2016-10-17 15:42:34	minimalism	no idea
2016-10-17 15:42:40	minimalism	I just read amd64 and Linux Sea
2016-10-17 15:43:34	alyptik	oh googling finally turned up something; it is some obscure proprietary one
2016-10-17 15:43:42	alyptik	name is misleading
2016-10-17 15:49:00		[15:43]
2016-10-17 16:27:56	minimalism	trying to determine if I need egl support enabled
2016-10-17 16:27:56		[16:27]
2016-10-17 16:28:00	minimalism	mpv is claiming it's not on
2016-10-17 16:31:21	minimalism	>mpv running >mpd+ncmpcpp running >tmux+weechat+toxic running >chromium running >850 MiB RAM used
2016-10-17 16:31:24	minimalism	that's what's up
2016-10-17 16:37:00		[16:31]
2016-10-17 16:43:53	alyptik	sorry was eating
2016-10-17 16:44:13	alyptik	i do like egl more than glc
2016-10-17 16:44:16	alyptik	glx*
2016-10-17 16:44:21	alyptik	but not needed i think
2016-10-17 16:50:00		[16:44]
2016-10-17 17:16:52	minimalism	the issue was mpv being strict enough to demand specifying the backend as x11 for some reason
2016-10-17 17:16:52		[17:16]
2016-10-17 17:17:01	minimalism	an issue about it was posted on debian's bug tracker as well
2016-10-17 17:23:00		[17:17]
2016-10-17 17:45:34	minimalism	that guy is giving me cancer
2016-10-17 17:45:34		[17:45]
2016-10-17 17:48:54	alyptik	he is either a troll or retarded
2016-10-17 17:49:04	alyptik	he does this a lot, banned from arch gen i think
2016-10-17 17:49:33	minimalism	I don't know how anyone could commit to that level of dumb behavior
2016-10-17 17:50:14	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-17 17:50:19	alyptik	wow
2016-10-17 17:50:26	alyptik	the symlink thing 
2016-10-17 17:50:45	minimalism	I don't know if it's something with the package he just installed
2016-10-17 17:50:50	minimalism	or if he's just doing that because he wants to
2016-10-17 17:50:59	minimalism	but either way, I'm beginning to suspect trolling a bit
2016-10-17 17:51:18	alyptik	yeah my money has been on troll
2016-10-17 17:52:02	minimalism	I called it at first because of the nick
2016-10-17 17:52:05	minimalism	and playing dumb
2016-10-17 17:52:12	minimalism	who nicks KKKrx
2016-10-17 17:52:15	minimalism	in that casing?
2016-10-17 17:52:34	minimalism	it's not banworthy or anything like tigrmesh surely believes it is, but
2016-10-17 17:52:44	minimalism	I think he knows he can taunt everyone with that
2016-10-17 17:52:50	alyptik	lol
2016-10-17 17:53:07	alyptik	didnt even think about username
2016-10-17 17:57:25	minimalism	the software choices will prove what's going on
2016-10-17 17:57:38	alyptik	heh
2016-10-17 17:58:45	minimalism	this son of a bitch..
2016-10-17 18:01:00	minimalism	he
2016-10-17 18:01:00		[18:01]
2016-10-17 18:01:05	minimalism	is just taunting me now
2016-10-17 18:07:00		[18:01]
2016-10-17 20:32:30	minimalism	just remembered something of interest I've been wanting with nix for a while
2016-10-17 20:32:30		[20:32]
2016-10-17 20:32:51	alyptik	hm?
2016-10-17 20:34:00	minimalism	an alternative startx
2016-10-17 20:34:04	minimalism	that doesn't use systemd in any way
2016-10-17 20:34:18	minimalism	even the authors of startx advise against using it lol
2016-10-17 20:34:31	alyptik	wow didn't even know it used systemd
2016-10-17 20:34:38	minimalism	it doesn't
2016-10-17 20:34:47	minimalism	but the only short alternative I know does have some systemd mentions
2016-10-17 20:35:00	minimalism	one of the arch people wrote it.. "rez-x"
2016-10-17 20:35:03	minimalism	fucking systemd line in there
2016-10-17 20:36:29	alyptik	i can't find it which line?
2016-10-17 20:37:13	minimalism	It's not in startx
2016-10-17 20:37:22	minimalism	it's just the only startx alternative does have mentions of systemd
2016-10-17 20:37:27	minimalism	https://gist.github.com/vodik/9442735
2016-10-17 20:37:34	alyptik	oh thats what you meant
2016-10-17 20:37:58	minimalism	the startx on gentoo fucking sucks
2016-10-17 20:38:09	minimalism	few different lines different, and it creates the serverauth file in $HOME
2016-10-17 20:38:11	minimalism	instead of /tmp
2016-10-17 20:39:03	alyptik	wat
2016-10-17 20:39:06	alyptik	that is weird
2016-10-17 20:40:48	alyptik	i can't think of a single good reason why
2016-10-17 20:41:45	minimalism	A major issue imo is how poorly a lot of system shell scripts are written
2016-10-17 20:41:53	minimalism	they look filthy, and the indentation/formatting is inconsistent and bad
2016-10-17 20:45:02	alyptik	yeah that's why i hate reading shell scripts
2016-10-17 20:45:17	alyptik	everyone should be as ocd with indenting as C devs
2016-10-17 20:45:33	minimalism	ocd should be a prerequisite for handling anything system critical
2016-10-17 20:45:43	alyptik	hah amen
2016-10-17 20:46:09	minimalism	if it were up to me.. I'd trim the fuck out of the FHS
2016-10-17 20:46:15	minimalism	remove useless dirs like media, srv
2016-10-17 20:46:21	minimalism	maybe even proc since sys was supposed to replace it
2016-10-17 20:48:03	alyptik	while i was making the FHS manpage package i was surprised just how fat the damn thing is
2016-10-17 20:48:03		[20:48]
2016-10-17 20:48:28	alyptik	2.6k lines to describe a filesystem standard
2016-10-17 20:49:05	minimalism	ridiculous
2016-10-17 20:49:29	minimalism	They should just let someone with ocd and a sense of minimalism and organization just redo the fucking thing
2016-10-17 20:49:35	minimalism	and then everyone can just accept it and update accordingly
2016-10-17 20:51:00	alyptik	lol there are 240 optional paths included
2016-10-17 20:51:22	minimalism	lib, lib32, lib64
2016-10-17 20:51:25	minimalism	they should all go too
2016-10-17 20:51:35	minimalism	I acknowledge bin has somewhat of a purpose for the base system, but
2016-10-17 20:52:08	alyptik	/media is stupid
2016-10-17 20:52:17	minimalism	entirely pointless
2016-10-17 20:52:24	minimalism	it's just rebranded /mnt
2016-10-17 20:52:39	alyptik	 i have never seen anyone use it ever except udisks
2016-10-17 20:52:42	minimalism	opt can fuck off too
2016-10-17 20:52:43	alyptik	go systemd hah
2016-10-17 20:52:58	alyptik	opt i can see some use for
2016-10-17 20:53:01	minimalism	I've used it, but only because
2016-10-17 20:53:09	alyptik	it where where i put all my bloat so it is easy to nuke
2016-10-17 20:53:11	minimalism	I wanted a place to store some software files that were global
2016-10-17 20:53:13	minimalism	rather than home
2016-10-17 20:53:15	minimalism	but still..
2016-10-17 20:53:19	minimalism	not really worth it
2016-10-17 20:53:24	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-17 20:53:29	alyptik	doesn't belong in a 'standard'
2016-10-17 20:53:50	minimalism	They should leverage /usr more
2016-10-17 20:53:57	minimalism	with optional subdirs for stupid bs
2016-10-17 20:54:17	alyptik	i put all my misc shit in /store
2016-10-17 20:54:19	minimalism	usr really is supposed to hold such things
2016-10-17 20:54:32	minimalism	I keep all my own scripts in /usr/local/bin and what not
2016-10-17 20:54:55	alyptik	i don't really like /usr/local, so i symlinked it to a dir in /store
2016-10-17 20:54:56	minimalism	/usr/* and /home/*/ need to be used properly instead of all this bs
2016-10-17 20:55:20	alyptik	/store/config is a git repo with ./scripts under that
2016-10-17 20:55:42	minimalism	logically..
2016-10-17 20:55:49	minimalism	the freebsd way makes sense, but
2016-10-17 20:55:54	minimalism	I still think it's wrong in some ways
2016-10-17 20:55:56	alyptik	/usr is basically / nowadays lol
2016-10-17 20:56:27	minimalism	tbh when we try to separate base system from additionally installed items
2016-10-17 20:56:29	minimalism	it becomes a mess
2016-10-17 20:56:57	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-17 20:56:59	minimalism	we should just get rid of bin, etc, lib, media, opt, proc, and all the other lib* except lib itself in usr
2016-10-17 20:57:03	minimalism	no more /usr/tmp either
2016-10-17 20:57:10	alyptik	wait what
2016-10-17 20:57:13	alyptik	why is that even a thing
2016-10-17 20:57:19	minimalism	because dumb bs
2016-10-17 20:57:24	minimalism	it's probably symlinked on arch as well
2016-10-17 20:58:02	alyptik	dont have it
2016-10-17 20:58:10	minimalism	it's symlinked on gentoo
2016-10-17 20:58:13	alyptik	is that like /var/tmp or smth
2016-10-17 20:58:20	alyptik	oh so not persistent
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[03:52:12] who nicks KKKrx [03:52:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:38		[21:03]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[03:52:15] in that casing? [03:52:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[03:52:34] it's not banworthy or anything like tigrmesh surely believes it is, but [03:52:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[03:52:44] I think he knows he can taunt everyone with that [03:52:44]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[03:57:25] the software choices will prove what's going on [03:57:25]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[03:58:45] this son of a bitch.. [03:58:45]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[04:01:00] he [04:01:00]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[04:01:05] is just taunting me now [04:01:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:32:30] just remembered something of interest I've been wanting with nix for a while [06:32:30]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:34:00] an alternative startx [06:34:00]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:34:04] that doesn't use systemd in any way [06:34:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:34:18] even the authors of startx advise against using it lol [06:34:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:34:38] it doesn't [06:34:38]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:34:47] but the only short alternative I know does have some systemd mentions [06:34:47]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:35:00] one of the arch people wrote it.. "rez-x" [06:35:00]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:35:03] fucking systemd line in there [06:35:03]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:37:13] It's not in startx [06:37:13]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:37:22] it's just the only startx alternative does have mentions of systemd [06:37:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:37:27] https://gist.github.com/vodik/9442735 [06:37:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:37:58] the startx on gentoo fucking sucks [06:37:58]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:38:09] few different lines different, and it creates the serverauth file in $HOME [06:38:09]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:38:10] instead of /tmp [06:38:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:41:45] A major issue imo is how poorly a lot of system shell scripts are written [06:41:45]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:41:53] they look filthy, and the indentation/formatting is inconsistent and bad [06:41:53]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:45:33] ocd should be a prerequisite for handling anything system critical [06:45:33]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:46:09] if it were up to me.. I'd trim the fuck out of the FHS [06:46:09]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:46:15] remove useless dirs like media, srv [06:46:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:46:21] maybe even proc since sys was supposed to replace it [06:46:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:49:05] ridiculous [06:49:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:49:29] They should just let someone with ocd and a sense of minimalism and organization just redo the fucking thing [06:49:29]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:49:35] and then everyone can just accept it and update accordingly [06:49:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:51:22] lib, lib32, lib64 [06:51:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:51:25] they should all go too [06:51:25]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:51:34] I acknowledge bin has somewhat of a purpose for the base system, but [06:51:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:52:17] entirely pointless [06:52:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:52:24] it's just rebranded /mnt [06:52:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:52:42] opt can fuck off too [06:52:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:01] I've used it, but only because [06:53:01]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:11] I wanted a place to store some software files that were global [06:53:11]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:13] rather than home [06:53:13]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:15] but still.. [06:53:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:19] not really worth it [06:53:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:50] They should leverage /usr more [06:53:50]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:57] with optional subdirs for stupid bs [06:53:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:54:19] usr really is supposed to hold such things [06:54:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:54:32] I keep all my own scripts in /usr/local/bin and what not [06:54:32]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:54:56] /usr/* and /home/*/ need to be used properly instead of all this bs [06:54:56]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:55:42] logically.. [06:55:42]

2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:57:19] because dumb bs [06:57:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:57:24] it's probably symlinked on arch as well [06:57:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:58:10] it's symlinked on gentoo [06:58:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:58:26]  /usr/tmp is symlinked to /tmp [06:58:26]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:58:34] arch changed its FHS a bit with symlinks and removing some stuff [06:58:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:59:24] even Alpine doesn't take modern ways and minimalism far enough [06:59:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[07:00:23] you know, if you get down to it [07:00:23]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[07:00:29] you can probably just remove usr itself [07:00:29]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[07:00:33] once you start really thinking about it [07:00:33]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[07:02:16] yep, remove usr and make your own local/bin to add to PATH in $HOME [07:02:16]
2016-10-17 21:03:40	minimalism	that should be the user's choice though
2016-10-17 21:03:42	minimalism	not in the FHS
2016-10-17 21:06:37	minimalism	One of these days I'm going to lose my mind and go rogue from Linux standards
2016-10-17 21:10:26	alyptik	lol
2016-10-17 21:10:41	alyptik	there should be RFCs for linux
2016-10-17 21:14:53	minimalism	also, everyone who creates config files in the root of $HOME/user needs to be thrown into a volcano

2016-10-18 14:40:35	alyptik	oh yeah i wasn't sure if you had this already but figured you'd find it useful
2016-10-18 14:40:55	alyptik	http://tinyurl.com/zsh-refcard-pdf
2016-10-18 14:41:26	alyptik	only other reference i have printed out besides ascii table
2016-10-18 14:43:53	minimalism	damn, I just realized I forgot what enabled shell commands to sort files logically
2016-10-18 14:43:55	minimalism	by number
2016-10-18 14:44:25	alyptik	what do you mean
2016-10-18 14:44:54	minimalism	ah just figured it out
2016-10-18 14:45:02	minimalism	it was because I was running this command from a script that had sh shebang
2016-10-18 14:45:06	minimalism	so it wasn't reading my aliases
2016-10-18 14:45:21	alyptik	oh hah i didn't know know shell scripts read aliases
2016-10-18 14:45:24	minimalism	by default.. shell is a retard that things
2016-10-18 14:45:26	alyptik	i always have written them without
2016-10-18 14:45:29	minimalism	after it goes 01-10
2016-10-18 14:45:32	minimalism	that 101 is next
2016-10-18 14:45:44	alyptik	lol yup
2016-10-18 14:45:45	minimalism	thinks*
2016-10-18 14:45:58	minimalism	so it makes watching Dragon Ball 01-153 a pain to do with a mpv cli command
2016-10-18 14:46:30	alyptik	for stuff i like i just use find -regex and rename the files
2016-10-18 14:46:38	alyptik	s/stuff/stuff like that
2016-10-18 14:46:48	minimalism	I have a consistent file naming system for all of my files
2016-10-18 14:46:51	minimalism	so no way on that
2016-10-18 14:46:56	alyptik	heh
2016-10-18 14:47:11	alyptik	what do you accomplish it with?
2016-10-18 14:47:12	alyptik	sort?
2016-10-18 14:47:17	minimalism	I won't even tolerate full metadata
2016-10-18 14:47:23	minimalism	accomplish what with
2016-10-18 14:47:37	alyptik	so it doesn't sort it in that stupid way
2016-10-18 14:47:48	minimalism	all coreutils are aliased for me in zsh basically
2016-10-18 14:47:55	minimalism	with my preferred flags/timestamp format
2016-10-18 14:48:02	alyptik	smart
2016-10-18 14:48:06	alyptik	i did that with a few like grep
2016-10-18 14:48:20	minimalism	-I can be a pretty useful flag for that.. but I don't alias grep
2016-10-18 14:48:24	minimalism	-I can be wrong
2016-10-18 14:48:37	minimalism	ls -AFhlv --color=auto --time-style=+"%m-%d-%Y %I:%M %p %Z"
2016-10-18 14:48:38	minimalism	my ls alias
2016-10-18 14:49:07	alyptik	lets see what mine is
2016-10-18 14:49:17	alyptik	ls -lAhqiQFs  --color=auto
2016-10-18 14:49:27	alyptik	more bloaty
2016-10-18 14:49:33	alyptik	i am stealing that time style thing though
2016-10-18 14:49:53	minimalism	I declare war on three letter abbreviations of months/days, daylight savings time, and the current numerical date format
2016-10-18 14:50:35	alyptik	lol
2016-10-18 14:51:02	minimalism	I'd vote for whoever gets rid of DST
2016-10-18 14:51:12	minimalism	it's so pointless, and not everyone even wants to follow it
2016-10-18 14:51:26	alyptik	it is good pretty much only for farmers i think
2016-10-18 14:51:39	alyptik	in hawaii we just happily ignore DST
2016-10-18 14:51:43	alyptik	life is pretty good
2016-10-18 14:51:48	minimalism	I don't see how it benefits farmers though
2016-10-18 14:51:56	alyptik	no idea, just what i've heard
2016-10-18 14:51:57	minimalism	it makes the nights shorter during the winter.. but I guess during summer
2016-10-18 14:52:09	minimalism	it helps I guess, but it's not worth pissing everyone off like this
2016-10-18 14:52:11	minimalism	it's just a number
2016-10-18 14:52:19	minimalism	they can just wake up earlier by an hour during the summer
2016-10-18 14:52:23	alyptik	lol
2016-10-18 14:53:31	minimalism	DST just makes it get dark at 4 PM during the winter
2016-10-18 14:53:34	minimalism	instead of 5
2016-10-18 14:53:39	minimalism	makes more sense than anything ever, ever.
2016-10-18 14:54:35	alyptik	ack m-d-y
2016-10-18 14:54:54	alyptik	my ocd can't permit anything other than y-m-d
2016-10-18 14:54:54		[14:54]
2016-10-18 14:55:50	minimalism	I personally prefer MM-DD-YYYY, but if the world had to agree on one format
2016-10-18 14:56:04	minimalism	I could do with YYYY-MM-DD
2016-10-18 14:57:51	alyptik	i like y-m-d because it it a nice comprimise
2016-10-18 14:57:57	alyptik	d-m-y is too fucking weird
2016-10-18 15:03:00		[14:57]
2016-10-18 15:09:34	minimalism	heh
2016-10-18 15:09:40	minimalism	Do you have an SBC? Like a pi or beaglebone?
2016-10-18 15:13:59	minimalism	I've just been thinking about it because I want to install Alpine on something .. do something cool with it
2016-10-18 15:16:28	minimalism	I was thinking about trying Alpine as a desktop on my second drive, but
2016-10-18 15:16:39	minimalism	it'd be cool to have a dedicated machine for Alpine.. for whatever I'd use it for
2016-10-18 15:17:25	minimalism	I wish beaglebone would get its shit together
2016-10-18 15:17:27	minimalism	and release a new model
2016-10-18 15:20:36	minimalism	think it'd be cool since Alpine is mostly made for both amd64 and ARM
2016-10-18 15:20:36		[15:20]
2016-10-18 15:20:50	minimalism	it's already trim as can be, so no debian grievances
2016-10-18 15:21:51	minimalism	debian is the worst thing in computing
2016-10-18 15:27:00		[15:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[06:58:26]  /usr/tmp is symlinked to /tmp [06:58:26]
2016-10-18 23:55:26		[23:55]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[06:58:34] arch changed its FHS a bit with symlinks and removing some stuff [06:58:34]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[06:59:24] even Alpine doesn't take modern ways and minimalism far enough [06:59:24]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[07:00:23] you know, if you get down to it [07:00:23]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[07:00:29] you can probably just remove usr itself [07:00:29]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[07:00:33] once you start really thinking about it [07:00:33]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[07:02:16] yep, remove usr and make your own local/bin to add to PATH in $HOME [07:02:16]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[07:03:40] that should be the user's choice though [07:03:40]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[07:03:42] not in the FHS [07:03:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[07:06:37] One of these days I'm going to lose my mind and go rogue from Linux standards [07:06:37]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[07:14:53] also, everyone who creates config files in the root of $HOME/user needs to be thrown into a volcano [07:14:53]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[00:39:48] Another day. Another thing to configure on gentoo. [00:39:48]

2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[07:06:37] One of these days I'm going to lose my mind and go rogue from Linux standards [07:06:37]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[07:14:53] also, everyone who creates config files in the root of $HOME/user needs to be thrown into a volcano [07:14:53]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:39:48] Another day. Another thing to configure on gentoo. [00:39:48]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:43:53] damn, I just realized I forgot what enabled shell commands to sort files logically [00:43:53]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:43:55] by number [00:43:55]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:44:54] ah just figured it out [00:44:54]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:45:02] it was because I was running this command from a script that had sh shebang [00:45:02]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:45:06] so it wasn't reading my aliases [00:45:06]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:45:24] by default.. shell is a retard that things [00:45:24]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:45:29] after it goes 01-10 [00:45:29]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:45:32] that 101 is next [00:45:32]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:45:45] thinks* [00:45:45]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:45:57] so it makes watching Dragon Ball 01-153 a pain to do with a mpv cli command [00:45:57]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:46:48] I have a consistent file naming system for all of my files [00:46:48]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:46:51] so no way on that [00:46:51]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:47:17] I won't even tolerate full metadata [00:47:17]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:47:23] accomplish what with [00:47:23]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:47:48] all coreutils are aliased for me in zsh basically [00:47:48]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:47:55] with my preferred flags/timestamp format [00:47:55]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:48:19] -I can be a pretty useful flag for that.. but I don't alias grep [00:48:19]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:48:24] -I can be wrong [00:48:24]

2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:49:53] I declare war on three letter abbreviations of months/days, daylight savings time, and the current numerical date format [00:49:53]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:51:02] I'd vote for whoever gets rid of DST [00:51:02]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:51:12] it's so pointless, and not everyone even wants to follow it [00:51:12]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:51:48] I don't see how it benefits farmers though [00:51:48]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:51:57] it makes the nights shorter during the winter.. but I guess during summer [00:51:57]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:52:09] it helps I guess, but it's not worth pissing everyone off like this [00:52:09]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:52:11] it's just a number [00:52:11]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:52:19] they can just wake up earlier by an hour during the summer [00:52:19]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:53:31] DST just makes it get dark at 4 PM during the winter [00:53:31]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:53:34] instead of 5 [00:53:34]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:53:39] makes more sense than anything ever, ever. [00:53:39]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:55:50] I personally prefer MM-DD-YYYY, but if the world had to agree on one format [00:55:50]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:56:04] I could do with YYYY-MM-DD [00:56:04]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[01:09:34] heh [01:09:34]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[01:09:40] Do you have an SBC? Like a pi or beaglebone? [01:09:40]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[01:13:59] I've just been thinking about it because I want to install Alpine on something .. do something cool with it [01:13:59]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[01:16:28] I was thinking about trying Alpine as a desktop on my second drive, but [01:16:28]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[01:16:39] it'd be cool to have a dedicated machine for Alpine.. for whatever I'd use it for [01:16:39]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[01:17:25] I wish beaglebone would get its shit together [01:17:25]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[01:17:27] and release a new model [01:17:27]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[01:20:36] think it'd be cool since Alpine is mostly made for both amd64 and ARM [01:20:36]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[01:20:50] it's already trim as can be, so no debian grievances [01:20:50]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[01:21:51] debian is the worst thing in computing [01:21:51]

2016-10-25 11:57:27	alyptik	yeah this seems safer than just setting a USE flag by itself
2016-10-25 11:57:40	minimalism	depends
2016-10-25 11:57:59	minimalism	gentoo has multiple versions of everything, and sometimes things don't exist or have changed drastically between versions
2016-10-25 11:58:05	minimalism	some are safe to set a general USE flag for all versions
2016-10-25 11:58:12	minimalism	most of mine for example are for all versions
2016-10-25 11:58:23	alyptik	i am mostly trying to avoid what happened with your USE flag snafu thing
2016-10-25 11:58:27	alyptik	the conky one
2016-10-25 11:58:42	minimalism	that was mostly a mistake with X
2016-10-25 11:58:53	minimalism	X should be set globally and banned as necessary on individual packages
2016-10-25 11:59:18	alyptik	oh that would be better than just enabling when needed?
2016-10-25 11:59:23	minimalism	it depends
2016-10-25 11:59:51	minimalism	some USE flags should be set globally, some should be on a case by case basis
2016-10-25 11:59:57	alyptik	ah i see
2016-10-25 11:59:58	minimalism	for example here are my globals
2016-10-25 12:00:25	minimalism	alsa bindist -bluetooth -cups -fortran -gnome -gnome-keyring -google -gtk3 -ipv6 -java -kde -pulseaudio -qt5 -syslog -systemd -vlc X zsh-completion
2016-10-25 12:00:36	minimalism	so I banned all the things I will never want
2016-10-25 12:00:40	minimalism	and if by some chance in hell I need one of those
2016-10-25 12:00:43	minimalism	I can just enable them for that specific package
2016-10-25 12:01:15	minimalism	X is only banned in a few things like conky
2016-10-25 12:01:25	minimalism	but enabled for everything else like I require
2016-10-25 12:02:09	minimalism	you could argue flags like jpeg gif png tiff svg could be set globally
2016-10-25 12:02:24	minimalism	but I think it varies from package to package since jpeg is mostly only for editing/viewing
2016-10-25 12:02:33	minimalism	rather than enabled for interfaces that really only use png and gif
2016-10-25 12:02:43	alyptik	syslog?
2016-10-25 12:02:43	minimalism	so I think image support should be enabled on a case by case
2016-10-25 12:02:52	minimalism	specific type of logger afaik
2016-10-25 12:03:11	minimalism	I don't think it's a general log support.. I think it's specifically for the syslog logger
2016-10-25 12:03:13	alyptik	i guess openrc uses klogd or something?
2016-10-25 12:03:20	minimalism	it uses whatever you want
2016-10-25 12:03:21	alyptik	ah ok
2016-10-25 12:03:29	minimalism	sysklogd is one a lot of people use though
2016-10-25 12:04:06	minimalism	I assume syslog means syslog-ng
2016-10-25 12:04:07	minimalism	 app-admin/syslog-ng
2016-10-25 12:04:13	alyptik	oh btw are you on lvm also?
2016-10-25 12:04:18	alyptik	or what rootfs if not
2016-10-25 12:04:37	minimalism	nah, never used lvm or anything like that
2016-10-25 12:04:41	minimalism	I use plain partitions
2016-10-25 12:04:44	alyptik	just straight ext4?
2016-10-25 12:04:49	minimalism	yeah
2016-10-25 12:04:58	minimalism	I might have to use lvm though if I want to encrypt
2016-10-25 12:05:08	minimalism	I don't feel ready for encryption yet though
2016-10-25 12:05:17	alyptik	you know i am not even 100% how to encrypt without lvm
2016-10-25 12:05:25	alyptik	never looked up if LUKS can be used without lvm
2016-10-25 12:05:26	minimalism	I don't know either
2016-10-25 12:05:31	minimalism	I don't think you can
2016-10-25 12:05:51	minimalism	it has to be one real partition with fake volumes inside it to do that rootcrypt thing
2016-10-25 12:06:13	alyptik	ah
2016-10-25 12:06:57	alyptik	been procrastinating registering my secure boot keys too
2016-10-25 12:07:02	alyptik	so much to break, so little time
2016-10-25 12:13:00		[12:07]
2016-10-25 12:14:59	alyptik	eh weird, my vim doesn't see zsh-completion as a valid uSE flag
2016-10-25 12:16:19	alyptik	works fine in emerge though 
2016-10-25 12:16:43	minimalism	zsh-completion doesn't appear to be a USE flag on my vim either
2016-10-25 12:16:49	minimalism	it may only be available in a newer version
2016-10-25 12:17:09	alyptik	yeah probably a recent thing
2016-10-25 12:23:00		[12:17]
2016-10-25 12:28:14	minimalism	I don't know how SNL isn't cancelled
2016-10-25 12:28:22	minimalism	keep hearing about their bs election gags
2016-10-25 12:28:28	minimalism	it's so lazy, and they're all terrible comedians
2016-10-25 12:28:55	alyptik	i don't know either
2016-10-25 12:29:50	alyptik	i haven't bothered to watch the election ones
2016-10-25 12:30:02	alyptik	well i haven't bothered with any SNL in years tbh lol
2016-10-25 12:30:25	minimalism	Most sane people haven't, but I keep seeing it mentioned on the internet
2016-10-25 12:30:47	minimalism	all they do is do a poor imitation of Trump
2016-10-25 12:31:01	alyptik	lol
2016-10-25 12:31:04	minimalism	while Kate Mcwhatever plays herself.. a bitch .. hillary
2016-10-25 12:31:30	minimalism	and apparently that kid from Good Burger still exists
2016-10-25 12:31:55	alyptik	is that the keenan & kel kids
2016-10-25 12:32:07	minimalism	yeah that one, keenan
2016-10-25 12:32:09	alyptik	hah
2016-10-25 12:32:26	alyptik	fuck i think i was like 14 when that skit came out
2016-10-25 12:32:40	minimalism	everyone's pretending to laugh because SNL is liberal and from NY
2016-10-25 12:38:00		[12:32]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[00:53:39] makes more sense than anything ever, ever. [00:53:39]
2016-10-25 13:49:48		[13:49]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[00:55:50] I personally prefer MM-DD-YYYY, but if the world had to agree on one format [00:55:50]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[00:56:04] I could do with YYYY-MM-DD [00:56:04]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[01:09:34] heh [01:09:34]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[01:09:40] Do you have an SBC? Like a pi or beaglebone? [01:09:40]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[01:13:59] I've just been thinking about it because I want to install Alpine on something .. do something cool with it [01:13:59]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[01:16:28] I was thinking about trying Alpine as a desktop on my second drive, but [01:16:28]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[01:16:39] it'd be cool to have a dedicated machine for Alpine.. for whatever I'd use it for [01:16:39]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[01:17:25] I wish beaglebone would get its shit together [01:17:25]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[01:17:27] and release a new model [01:17:27]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[01:20:36] think it'd be cool since Alpine is mostly made for both amd64 and ARM [01:20:36]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[01:20:50] it's already trim as can be, so no debian grievances [01:20:50]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[01:21:51] debian is the worst thing in computing [01:21:51]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[21:56:45] it means apply X USE flag to pango for versions equal to or greater than 1.40.3 [21:56:45]

2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:03:11] I don't think it's a general log support.. I think it's specifically for the syslog logger [22:03:11]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:03:20] it uses whatever you want [22:03:20]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:03:29] sysklogd is one a lot of people use though [22:03:29]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:04:06] I assume syslog means syslog-ng [22:04:06]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:04:07]  app-admin/syslog-ng [22:04:07]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:04:37] nah, never used lvm or anything like that [22:04:37]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:04:41] I use plain partitions [22:04:41]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:04:49] yeah [22:04:49]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:04:58] I might have to use lvm though if I want to encrypt [22:04:58]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:05:08] I don't feel ready for encryption yet though [22:05:08]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:05:26] I don't know either [22:05:26]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:05:31] I don't think you can [22:05:31]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:05:51] it has to be one real partition with fake volumes inside it to do that rootcrypt thing [22:05:51]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:16:43] zsh-completion doesn't appear to be a USE flag on my vim either [22:16:43]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:16:49] it may only be available in a newer version [22:16:49]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:28:14] I don't know how SNL isn't cancelled [22:28:14]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:28:22] keep hearing about their bs election gags [22:28:22]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:28:28] it's so lazy, and they're all terrible comedians [22:28:28]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:30:25] Most sane people haven't, but I keep seeing it mentioned on the internet [22:30:25]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:30:47] all they do is do a poor imitation of Trump [22:30:47]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:31:04] while Kate Mcwhatever plays herself.. a bitch .. hillary [22:31:04]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:31:30] and apparently that kid from Good Burger still exists [22:31:30]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:32:07] yeah that one, keenan [22:32:07]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:32:40] everyone's pretending to laugh because SNL is liberal and from NY [22:32:40]
2016-10-25 16:58:23	minimalism	What exactly are ctags? Haven't looked into them myself yet
2016-10-25 16:58:23		[16:58]
2016-10-25 16:59:15	alyptik	if you are editing like a c/cpp file you can view the function definition when you see the function in the code
2016-10-25 16:59:45	alyptik	think they work for all languages, but i know c/cpp for sure
2016-10-25 16:59:54	minimalism	not sure I follow
2016-10-25 17:00:16	alyptik	so like void foo() { printf "derp"; }
2016-10-25 17:00:26	alyptik	when you are editing a file and you see foo();
2016-10-25 17:00:40	alyptik	you can see what is foo() exactly 
2016-10-25 17:00:46	minimalism	How?
2016-10-25 17:00:50	alyptik	without having to go search yourself
2016-10-25 17:01:02	alyptik	you have to tag it in a ctags file
2016-10-25 17:01:14	alyptik	there are vim plugs that do it automatically i think
2016-10-25 17:01:39	alyptik	not sure on specifics, haven't used it myself either
2016-10-25 17:01:44	alyptik	but that is the general concept
2016-10-25 17:01:45	minimalism	I must be thinking of something different because for some reason I'm thinking of ctags as having to do with rc/init
2016-10-25 17:01:57	alyptik	it can be any language with functions i think
2016-10-25 17:02:05	minimalism	wait I think I'm thinking of cgroups
2016-10-25 17:02:09	alyptik	lol
2016-10-25 17:02:23	alyptik	yeah that is a completly diff thing
2016-10-25 17:03:02	alyptik	cgroups from what i understand are a way to specify how much system resources a pid is allowed to use
2016-10-25 17:03:18	alyptik	setting that up is on my todo list
2016-10-25 17:09:00		[17:03]
2016-10-25 17:10:57	minimalism	my to do list I look forward to completing with gentoo
2016-10-25 17:11:16	minimalism	I want to move onto using alpine to set up servers and learn more about network admin type stuff
2016-10-25 17:11:27	minimalism	and learn some C finally
2016-10-25 17:13:32	alyptik	i want to learn cpp eventually
2016-10-25 17:13:37	minimalism	I'm learning so many different things simultaneously that it will be a while for it all to culminate into something great
2016-10-25 17:13:53	minimalism	but I already have quite a varied set of skills that aren't usually paired together
2016-10-25 17:14:20	minimalism	if I ever do some app with commercial intent.. I won't need designers, sysadmins, or front end people
2016-10-25 17:14:31	minimalism	just one of my friends in programming
2016-10-25 17:14:35	alyptik	lol
2016-10-25 17:14:37	minimalism	fuck dealing with designers
2016-10-25 17:16:28	minimalism	designin, front endin, administratin, kind of programmin ...
2016-10-25 17:17:40	alyptik	i would never be able to do the  logo design 
2016-10-25 17:17:45	alyptik	i am horrible at anything art
2016-10-25 17:17:56	minimalism	it's not so much drawing or art
2016-10-25 17:18:17	minimalism	it's skilled manipulation of expensive licensed proprietary fonts and some geometry/choice of colors
2016-10-25 17:18:24	minimalism	that's really 100% of it
2016-10-25 17:18:31	alyptik	hah
2016-10-25 17:18:33	minimalism	most logos that go beyond that end up too complex and look bad
2016-10-25 17:18:33	alyptik	very true
2016-10-25 17:19:05	minimalism	I designed a logo for a small company whose entire prospect is branding lol
2016-10-25 17:19:50	minimalism	not something I could do every day though.. too much dwelling
2016-10-25 17:20:01	minimalism	that's why you see logo designers charging fortune 500 companies like 50k per job
2016-10-25 17:26:00		[17:20]
2016-10-25 17:34:36	alyptik	hm
2016-10-25 17:34:41	alyptik	how detailed do i need to make /etc/conf.d/modules
2016-10-25 17:34:51	minimalism	haven't looked into it yet
2016-10-25 17:34:58	alyptik	do i need to figure out exactly what i need or can i just shove all the modules in there
2016-10-25 17:35:05	alyptik	you didnt touch it at all?
2016-10-25 17:35:08	minimalism	not yet, no
2016-10-25 17:35:16	minimalism	I only have my module conf from arch which was blacklisting
2016-10-25 17:35:22	alyptik	i will just do that then till i figure out whats what
2016-10-25 17:35:43	minimalism	I'm working on a full evaluation of USE flags for everything right now, and also
2016-10-25 17:35:44	alyptik	my other install i just shoved everything from /lib/modules in there hah
2016-10-25 17:35:50	minimalism	working on the savedconfig for linux-firmware
2016-10-25 17:37:16	minimalism	arch really handed this stuff to us
2016-10-25 17:37:22	minimalism	systemd services, no real scripting
2016-10-25 17:37:26	minimalism	journalctl
2016-10-25 17:37:35	minimalism	no setting up logging or cron
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:41:11] truthfully, a lot of those claims that you'll break something by editing manually are false [03:41:11]
2016-10-25 17:57:05		[17:57]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:41:31] like they say don't edit /etc/passwd,group,shadow,gshadow [03:41:31]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:41:36] you totally can, and I regularly do [03:41:36]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:41:52] you just need to know what permission settings they all need to have [03:41:52]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:42:21] that's usually the main concern [03:42:21]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:42:26] knowing who is supposed to own the files/dirs [03:42:26]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:42:30] and what permission setting [03:42:30]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:43:53] I heard cronie and chrony so highly recommended for cron jobs and time sync, but who knows [03:43:53]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:44:02] sysklogd is also recommended for beginners in the handbook [03:44:02]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:44:50] I have it installed and I think it's set via eselect, but [03:44:50]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:44:55] I never actually configured it in any way [03:44:55]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:45:08] You up for doing some co-op on gentoo config this week? [03:45:08]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:45:14] It's easier to actually get it done when two minds are on it [03:45:14]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:45:33] alright, what are you choosing for logging, cron, initramfs [03:45:33]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:45:53] I'm planning unless I have reason otherwise.. to use sysklogd, cronie+chrony, dracut [03:45:53]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:46:00] initrd, initramfs, you know [03:46:00]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:46:08] oh [03:46:08]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:46:14] like software to create it [03:46:14]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:46:20] like arch has its own mkinitcpio [03:46:20]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:46:23] we don't have that on gentoo [03:46:23]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:46:26] lol fuck genkernel [03:46:26]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:46:30] it doesn't include the necessary stuff [03:46:30]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:46:43] we need to learn dracut or learn to do it manually.. I was actually telling NextHendrix [03:46:43]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:46:59] it may be easier to write a file full of files/paths with wildcards [03:46:59]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:47:04] to make it future proof in case of version changes [03:47:04]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:47:17] and write a script that does an rsync of those files to a dir like [03:47:17]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:47:23] $HOME/Build/initramfs/ [03:47:23]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:47:36] where it syncs the files, and it automatically builds into a compressed initramfs image [03:47:36]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:47:41] that is automoved to /boot [03:47:41]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:47:54] it's just a collection of files used to get a headstart during boot [03:47:54]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:48:01] to provide some functionality before the system is really going [03:48:01]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:48:23] like /boot partition is all that's accessible at first for example [03:48:23]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:48:26] before it reaches root [03:48:26]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:48:36] especially if root is encrypted, you know [03:48:36]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:48:55] I'm not entirely clear on it, but I think I get the gist [03:48:55]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:49:08] it's just a binary that launches shit during startup to get the system going, fin. [03:49:08]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:50:03] init [03:50:03]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:50:41] I think init is pid 1 everywhere [03:50:41]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:51:00] systemd is just a really fucking lame system that hides too much [03:51:00]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:51:02] and logs in binary [03:51:02]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:51:23]  /sbin/init [03:51:23]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:51:25] that file [03:51:25]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:51:54] did you notice that package on arch [03:51:54]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:51:57] it's like called [03:51:57]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:52:02] systemd-sysvinitcompat or something [03:52:02]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:52:14] like on gentoo you definitely have sysvinit installed [03:52:14]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:52:28] check this out.. this is what's returned by e-file for ownership of /sbin/init [03:52:28]

2016-10-25 17:57:06	minimalism	[03:53:25] in my case with openrc, sysvinit provides it [03:53:25]
2016-10-25 17:57:06	minimalism	[03:55:06] there's another interesting thing about gentoo [03:55:06]
2016-10-25 17:57:06	minimalism	[03:55:21] and most likely why they never really officially called it "Gentoo Linux" in the /etc/os-release file [03:55:21]
2016-10-25 17:57:06	minimalism	[03:55:36] it's just "Gentoo" unlike "Arch Linux" [03:55:36]
2016-10-25 17:57:06	minimalism	[03:55:48] you can do Gentoo/FreeBSD instead of Gentoo/Linux [03:55:48]
2016-10-25 17:57:06	minimalism	[03:56:01] see that sys-freebsd/freebsd-sbin above [03:56:01]
2016-10-25 17:58:05	alyptik	there we go back in
2016-10-25 17:58:13	alyptik	that is kinda neat
2016-10-25 18:01:09	alyptik	what other logging options are there
2016-10-25 18:02:09	minimalism	well the handbook mentions
2016-10-25 18:02:19	minimalism	sysklogd, syslog-ng, metalog
2016-10-25 18:02:27	minimalism	and you can optionally choose whether to install logrotate
2016-10-25 18:02:30	minimalism	which we use on arch
2016-10-25 18:03:24	alyptik	never heard of metalog
2016-10-25 18:04:28	alyptik	prob will just stick with sysklogd
2016-10-25 18:07:22	minimalism	yeah, I would
2016-10-25 18:07:28	minimalism	sysklogd+logrotate should be simple enough
2016-10-25 18:07:38	minimalism	I think you can set all the logging levels for various types of logs
2016-10-25 18:07:42	minimalism	even set path/filename for the logs
2016-10-25 18:09:20	minimalism	https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Security_Handbook/Logging
2016-10-25 18:13:38	minimalism	hm
2016-10-25 18:13:38		[18:13]
2016-10-25 18:13:49	minimalism	appears syslog use flag probably does go with sysklogd
2016-10-25 18:13:55	minimalism	 /etc/syslog.conf belongs to sysklogd
2016-10-25 18:15:59	alyptik	oh looks like zswap isn't freezing me
2016-10-25 18:16:11	alyptik	lz4 compression is just really fucking slow
2016-10-25 18:16:39	minimalism	very relevant article
2016-10-25 18:16:41	minimalism	http://www.tecmint.com/systemd-replaces-init-in-linux/
2016-10-25 18:17:49	minimalism	as I thought/recall
2016-10-25 18:17:52	minimalism	systemd is pid 1 on arch
2016-10-25 18:17:56	minimalism	I think init was pid 3
2016-10-25 18:18:20	alyptik	oh this article is really good
2016-10-25 18:19:32	alyptik	a bit biased
2016-10-25 18:19:35	alyptik	but good info
2016-10-25 18:21:39	minimalism	ignore the bias, just has a history and basic facts of use
2016-10-25 18:27:00		[18:21]
2016-10-25 18:33:10	minimalism	just looked at my ctags in eselect after reading news
2016-10-25 18:33:16	minimalism	are you using exuberant-ctags?
2016-10-25 18:33:49	alyptik	i am compiling kernel atm
2016-10-25 18:33:57	alyptik	was planning on installing though yeah
2016-10-25 18:34:06	minimalism	apparently the minimal USE flag on vim
2016-10-25 18:34:12	minimalism	is what triggers ctags from being installed or not
2016-10-25 18:34:19	alyptik	oo
2016-10-25 18:34:39	minimalism	that would remove/disable plugins, fonts, drivers, etc. though
2016-10-25 18:34:48	minimalism	so things are good then, ctags can stay
2016-10-25 18:35:13	minimalism	I've been linking this article to people
2016-10-25 18:35:15	minimalism	https://timboudreau.com/blog/gentoo/read
2016-10-25 18:35:31	minimalism	especially a friend who works as a software engineer who's forced to use OSX
2016-10-25 18:37:59	alyptik	will read when chromium loads it hah
2016-10-25 18:38:08	alyptik	it is trying to open 25 t atmabs 
2016-10-25 18:38:15	alyptik	25 tabs atm*
2016-10-25 18:40:18	alyptik	oh no wonder it is so slow
2016-10-25 18:40:23	alyptik	76 tabs* hah
2016-10-25 18:46:00		[18:40]
2016-10-25 20:34:53	minimalism	got a neat little thing going with USE flags now
2016-10-25 20:34:53		[20:34]
2016-10-25 20:35:17	minimalism	got a good set of globals and this tiny 3 liner of shell to go through a list of packages
2016-10-25 20:35:32	minimalism	and grep a specific USE flag to check + or - to see if it's consistent across the board
2016-10-25 20:35:50	alyptik	oh that is cool
2016-10-25 20:35:58	alyptik	like a shell func?
2016-10-25 20:41:00		[20:35]
2016-10-25 20:45:26	minimalism	oh I just discovered a better line
2016-10-25 20:46:54	minimalism	equery uses $(equery hasuse $1) | grep $1
2016-10-25 20:47:00	minimalism	as a func
2016-10-25 20:47:04	minimalism	since shell won't read $1
2016-10-25 20:47:27	minimalism	so if you do that with ssl as $1
2016-10-25 20:47:33	alyptik	added to my aliases 
2016-10-25 20:47:38	minimalism	it's more to check consistency
2016-10-25 20:47:52	minimalism	like if it's something you should take note of where packages all have it banned or enabled
2016-10-25 20:48:01	minimalism	like ssl for example is clear
2016-10-25 20:48:05	minimalism	they all have it enabled across the board
2016-10-25 20:48:08	minimalism	no action necessary
2016-10-25 20:48:46	alyptik	should i quote the $()
2016-10-25 20:48:56	alyptik	does splitting affect how equery reads it?
2016-10-25 20:50:51	minimalism	I think it has to be contained
2016-10-25 20:51:06	minimalism	that's to isolate it or whatever.. I don't know the terms
2016-10-25 20:51:16	minimalism	I just learn a thing or two about shell scripting and it comes together
2016-10-25 20:51:33	alyptik	ah
2016-10-25 20:51:36	alyptik	hm i wonder
2016-10-25 20:52:03	alyptik	ah no can't make it into an alias with parallel
2016-10-25 20:52:09	alyptik	the pipe heh
2016-10-25 20:52:59	minimalism	it's not the pipe, it's the.. what do you call that
2016-10-25 20:53:02	minimalism	the $1 var
2016-10-25 20:53:19	alyptik	well i was thinking parallel ::: equery grep ::: 
2016-10-25 20:53:30	alyptik	but doesnt work with the pipe 
2016-10-25 20:53:59	alyptik	was just trying to see if i can make it an alias for fun heh
2016-10-25 20:58:19	minimalism	just wrote these in
2016-10-25 20:58:19		[20:58]
2016-10-25 20:58:21	minimalism	emergelog() { tail -n "$1" "/var/log/emerge.log" | less; }
2016-10-25 20:58:23	minimalism	equery-use-consistency() { equery uses $(equery hasuse "$1") | grep "$1"; }
2016-10-25 21:04:00		[20:58]
2016-10-25 21:15:53	minimalism	another useful thing to ban in USE is accessibility
2016-10-25 21:21:00		[21:15]
2016-10-25 21:23:26	alyptik	what does that entail
2016-10-25 21:23:30	alyptik	like screen reader shit?
2016-10-25 21:27:19	minimalism	basically for blind, deaf, etc.
2016-10-25 21:27:43	alyptik	yeah -accessibility it is
2016-10-25 21:28:05	minimalism	the fuck
2016-10-25 21:28:11	minimalism	SELinux is enabled in my kernel config now
2016-10-25 21:28:18	alyptik	lol
2016-10-25 21:33:44	minimalism	Oh you got tox working right?
2016-10-25 21:39:00		[21:33]
2016-10-25 21:42:23	alyptik	i did yup
2016-10-25 21:48:00		[21:42]
2016-10-25 21:48:52	minimalism	this Dragon Box rip is fucking amzing
2016-10-25 21:48:54	minimalism	amazing*
2016-10-25 21:49:27	alyptik	dragon box?
2016-10-25 21:49:41	minimalism	it's the ultimate release from over a decade ago for Dragon Ball
2016-10-25 21:49:48	alyptik	oh shit
2016-10-25 21:50:03	minimalism	no one's ever put out the real original source on the internet
2016-10-25 21:50:14	minimalism	the DVD set for Dragon Ball alone was 100,000 JPY
2016-10-25 21:50:18	alyptik	OG dragon ball was the shit
2016-10-25 21:50:26	minimalism	Dragon Ball Z I think may have been 150K or more
2016-10-25 21:50:31	minimalism	possibly 200
2016-10-25 21:50:38	alyptik	damn
2016-10-25 21:50:38	minimalism	this is like 1000-2000 USD per box set
2016-10-25 21:50:43	minimalism	so no one was really ripping these things
2016-10-25 21:51:11	minimalism	worse yet, they won't ever be released again, and the US video source is completely different
2016-10-25 21:51:13	minimalism	audio too
2016-10-25 21:51:27	minimalism	it's missing the original OP/ED versions, audio is bad, the video colors are off
2016-10-25 21:51:32	minimalism	they did a poor job attempting to clean it
2016-10-25 21:51:38	minimalism	"remaster"
2016-10-25 21:51:52	minimalism	Dragon Ball basically has Star Wars theatrical tier status with the 2004 Dragon Box from Japan
2016-10-25 21:52:13	alyptik	remastering is hard to do well
2016-10-25 21:52:25	minimalism	right, it's not something you should do either for the most part
2016-10-25 21:52:29	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-25 21:52:30	minimalism	they didn't even have the real video source
2016-10-25 21:52:51	minimalism	you don't let some scrub studio handle the most valuable negative in all of animation
2016-10-25 21:53:12	minimalism	so this guy started ripping the DVDs in full quality, so the files are like 1 GiB each
2016-10-25 21:53:23	minimalism	the original grain and color are there
2016-10-25 21:53:26	alyptik	haha that is sick
2016-10-25 21:53:31	minimalism	there's no fucked up rip with black bordering on one side either
2016-10-25 21:53:40	minimalism	and the original mono audio is so soft and perfect
2016-10-25 21:53:48	minimalism	unlike the scratchy version released here
2016-10-25 21:54:10	minimalism	no one's ever posted this original source in this condition, and better yet
2016-10-25 21:54:19	alyptik	torrent?
2016-10-25 21:54:21	minimalism	he muxed it with the official translation subtitles perfectly timed to the video
2016-10-25 21:54:33	minimalism	normally they don't sync right
2016-10-25 21:54:55	minimalism	https://www.nyaa.se/?user=329876
2016-10-25 21:55:01	minimalism	he's only got up to General Blue posted so far
2016-10-25 21:55:21	alyptik	\o/
2016-10-25 21:55:24	alyptik	"Found Gentoo Base System release 2.2 on /dev/mapper/sp3-gentoo"
2016-10-25 21:55:42	alyptik	now to finish up and see if it runs
2016-10-25 21:55:54	alyptik	oh sweet
2016-10-25 21:55:57	alyptik	bookmarking for later
2016-10-25 21:57:32	minimalism	https://imgur.com/a/Paudf
2016-10-25 21:57:34	minimalism	check it out
2016-10-25 21:57:41	minimalism	the authentic grain you see only on the real original video source
2016-10-25 21:57:53	minimalism	I'm so pissed off they took it out of Star Wars
2016-10-25 21:57:57	minimalism	it just changes everything
2016-10-25 22:01:32	alyptik	wow 
2016-10-25 22:01:52	alyptik	shit last time i saw dragonball i was like 16 hah
2016-10-25 22:02:06	alyptik	gonna try rebooting, won't respond for a bit
2016-10-25 22:08:00		[22:02]
2016-10-25 22:10:49	minimalism	trying to remember what I did with the kernel and efibootmgr
