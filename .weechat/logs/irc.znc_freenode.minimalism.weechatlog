2016-10-17 13:36:06	minimalism	Noticed before I logged off yesterday that one init script for macchanger doesn't seem to want to go off before vpn
2016-10-17 13:36:06		[13:36]
2016-10-17 13:36:49	<--	minimalism (~none@unaffiliated/minimalism) has quit (Client Quit)
2016-10-17 13:37:05	-->	minimalism (~none@unaffiliated/minimalism) is back on server
2016-10-17 13:43:00		[13:37]
2016-10-17 13:57:34	alyptik	you change your mac?
2016-10-17 14:03:00		[13:57]
2016-10-17 14:04:15	minimalism	yeah
2016-10-17 14:04:20	minimalism	I had it set on arch to change on boot
2016-10-17 14:04:25	minimalism	then start vpn
2016-10-17 14:05:36	alyptik	ah and using openrc right? i don't have much experience with writing inits for that
2016-10-17 14:11:00		[14:05]
2016-10-17 14:17:00		[14:11]
2016-10-17 14:27:15	minimalism	I wrote one for it with just a start() function
2016-10-17 14:28:00	minimalism	but it's something that just fires once, can't be stopped or anything
2016-10-17 14:28:52	alyptik	ah
2016-10-17 14:29:01	alyptik	weird, maybe there is a race condition or something
2016-10-17 14:35:00		[14:29]
2016-10-17 14:44:46	minimalism	I set a before and after
2016-10-17 14:44:56	minimalism	it's probably some difference of behavior in booting
2016-10-17 14:45:15	minimalism	an odd thing I noticed is it seems.. "seems" to be able to change MAC on an interface that is currently up
2016-10-17 14:45:22	minimalism	without going up and down
2016-10-17 14:45:29	minimalism	it didn't work that way on arch
2016-10-17 14:45:40	alyptik	that shouldn't work .-.
2016-10-17 14:46:08	minimalism	people don't think it be like it is, but it do
2016-10-17 14:46:15	alyptik	lol
2016-10-17 14:46:29	minimalism	I just did it
2016-10-17 14:46:38	alyptik	well i guess it would be ok for you but your router would freak out afaik
2016-10-17 14:46:49	alyptik	ARP tables would be f'ed up 
2016-10-17 14:47:55	minimalism	 /etc/init.d/macchanger restart
2016-10-17 14:47:56	minimalism	New MAC: *redacted*         [ ok ]
2016-10-17 14:47:56	<--	minimalism (~none@unaffiliated/minimalism) has quit (Quit: minimalism)
2016-10-17 14:49:36	-->	minimalism (~none@unaffiliated/minimalism) is back on server
2016-10-17 14:51:19	minimalism	Apparently it doesn't work. It just looks like it does.. which is weird
2016-10-17 14:51:19		[14:51]
2016-10-17 14:51:38	alyptik	yeah it is strange it didn't throw an error
2016-10-17 14:51:50	minimalism	It still shows the VPN as on and everything
2016-10-17 14:51:53	minimalism	even changes the MAC
2016-10-17 14:52:03	minimalism	everything looks alright until you actually try using something requiring a connection
2016-10-17 14:52:06	minimalism	then it's just hanging
2016-10-17 14:52:53	alyptik	yeah the arp handler on your router prob was freaking out
2016-10-17 14:58:00		[14:52]
2016-10-17 14:59:53	minimalism	beginning to worry I did something making gentoo not use my GPU
2016-10-17 15:00:04	minimalism	it may just be a bug with screenfetch but unsure
2016-10-17 15:00:13	alyptik	huh how come
2016-10-17 15:00:27	minimalism	screenfetch isn't returning my GPU except in root, however
2016-10-17 15:00:38	minimalism	a lot of commands used to return hardware information are restricted in gentoo
2016-10-17 15:00:42	minimalism	they're unusable outside of root
2016-10-17 15:00:56	minimalism	blkid, lspci, etc.
2016-10-17 15:00:59	minimalism	won't tell you anything
2016-10-17 15:01:43	alyptik	from the script:
2016-10-17 15:01:43	alyptik	gpu_info=$($(PATH="/usr/bin:$PATH" type -p lspci | cut -f1) 2> /dev/null | grep VGA)
2016-10-17 15:01:51	alyptik	see if that works for you without root
2016-10-17 15:03:08	minimalism	seems awfully intricate for whatever that does
2016-10-17 15:03:11	minimalism	with lspci
2016-10-17 15:03:45	alyptik	prob meant to portable as possible
2016-10-17 15:03:50	minimalism	It doesn't work though
2016-10-17 15:04:03	alyptik	ah i guess lspci is root only
2016-10-17 15:04:03	minimalism	lspci is just plain restricted outside of root.. mentioned something similar in gentoo about blkid the other day
2016-10-17 15:04:09	minimalism	they claim it's not restricted, but
2016-10-17 15:04:15	minimalism	it got into a semantic argument
2016-10-17 15:04:38	minimalism	I know it's detecting the card as being there, however
2016-10-17 15:04:45	minimalism	I'm trying to think of a definitive way to see it's being used
2016-10-17 15:04:50	minimalism	right now in action on X and with any graphical program
2016-10-17 15:05:21	alyptik	try grep -i --color memory /var/log/Xorg.0.log 
2016-10-17 15:05:58	alyptik	or wherever your xorg log it
2016-10-17 15:06:01	alyptik	s/it/is
2016-10-17 15:07:42	minimalism	you know you can just set grep colors in env
2016-10-17 15:07:59	alyptik	just pasting from my aliases file
2016-10-17 15:08:08	alyptik	that is an old one gpumeminfo= lol
2016-10-17 15:08:17	minimalism	you're looking for the word "memory" in those files?
2016-10-17 15:08:19	minimalism	why
2016-10-17 15:08:43	alyptik	i have no clue tbh
2016-10-17 15:08:53	alyptik	i just grepped gpu in my aliases file
2016-10-17 15:09:33	alyptik	i think that alias is from like 2 years ago; so if it doesn't work not surprsed
2016-10-17 15:10:34	minimalism	I've looked through xorg log before and saw mentions of radeon but I'm getting suspicious since it doesn't mention my exact model
2016-10-17 15:10:40	minimalism	and it tries to load vesa for some reason
2016-10-17 15:11:16	alyptik	don't know enough about ati to know what vesa is
2016-10-17 15:11:39	minimalism	vesa and mesa
2016-10-17 15:12:06	alyptik	oh and ati doesn't use vesa?
2016-10-17 15:12:13	minimalism	I don't think so
2016-10-17 15:12:19	minimalism	I think it's a nvidia thing
2016-10-17 15:14:41	minimalism	I can't wait to see how efficiently this system runs when I'm done trimming packages with USE flags, fully completing a perfect kernel config, a solid initramfs
2016-10-17 15:14:41		[15:14]
2016-10-17 15:14:49	minimalism	some looking over firmware loaded etc.
2016-10-17 15:14:52	minimalism	removing a fuckton of modules
2016-10-17 15:15:11	alyptik	kernel config is an art
2016-10-17 15:15:20	alyptik	where rice meets useful
2016-10-17 15:15:29	minimalism	The besy way to do it is probably remove everything then go from there
2016-10-17 15:15:31	minimalism	best*
2016-10-17 15:15:53	alyptik	i like to start from makelocalmod config
2016-10-17 15:16:01	alyptik	make localmodconfig*
2016-10-17 15:16:13	minimalism	I'm not familiar
2016-10-17 15:16:34	alyptik	it sets every module not currently loaded to N
2016-10-17 15:16:49	minimalism	Ahh, that's what I've been wanting
2016-10-17 15:16:55	minimalism	I should boot arch and then run that
2016-10-17 15:17:03	minimalism	it'll give me a better idea of what I don't need
2016-10-17 15:17:07	minimalism	then trim some more for gentoo
2016-10-17 15:17:09	alyptik	and afaik it does make oldconfig for the rest
2016-10-17 15:21:17	alyptik	do you bother with cgroups?
2016-10-17 15:21:24	alyptik	trying to decide if worth learning
2016-10-17 15:21:49	minimalism	haven't looked into them at all
2016-10-17 15:22:07	minimalism	Did you get tox working?
2016-10-17 15:22:13	alyptik	yup
2016-10-17 15:22:25	alyptik	was pretty painless
2016-10-17 15:22:33	alyptik	looked at config but didn't touch
2016-10-17 15:22:38	alyptik	didn't really know what does what yet
2016-10-17 15:22:58	minimalism	I basically just changed its default or not color setting
2016-10-17 15:23:04	minimalism	change time_format and timestamp_fornat
2016-10-17 15:23:10	minimalism	the characters displayed for line_*
2016-10-17 15:23:17	minimalism	changed the away_note to AFK
2016-10-17 15:23:27	minimalism	set the input/output device numbers
2016-10-17 15:23:37	minimalism	set my download_path for where to save transferred files
2016-10-17 15:23:42	minimalism	set my path to my avatar image
2016-10-17 15:24:02	minimalism	then after that it's basically just some keybinds for stuff, and able to set custom sound files
2016-10-17 15:30:00		[15:24]
2016-10-17 15:39:13	alyptik	what is the arch of Gentoo Linux Alpha Handbook
2016-10-17 15:39:30	alyptik	doesn't really say
2016-10-17 15:40:38	alyptik	it says 64-bit but i don't understand if it is x86_64 or a seperate proprietary one
2016-10-17 15:42:34	minimalism	no idea
2016-10-17 15:42:40	minimalism	I just read amd64 and Linux Sea
2016-10-17 15:43:34	alyptik	oh googling finally turned up something; it is some obscure proprietary one
2016-10-17 15:43:42	alyptik	name is misleading
2016-10-17 15:49:00		[15:43]
2016-10-17 16:27:56	minimalism	trying to determine if I need egl support enabled
2016-10-17 16:27:56		[16:27]
2016-10-17 16:28:00	minimalism	mpv is claiming it's not on
2016-10-17 16:31:21	minimalism	>mpv running >mpd+ncmpcpp running >tmux+weechat+toxic running >chromium running >850 MiB RAM used
2016-10-17 16:31:24	minimalism	that's what's up
2016-10-17 16:37:00		[16:31]
2016-10-17 16:43:53	alyptik	sorry was eating
2016-10-17 16:44:13	alyptik	i do like egl more than glc
2016-10-17 16:44:16	alyptik	glx*
2016-10-17 16:44:21	alyptik	but not needed i think
2016-10-17 16:50:00		[16:44]
2016-10-17 17:16:52	minimalism	the issue was mpv being strict enough to demand specifying the backend as x11 for some reason
2016-10-17 17:16:52		[17:16]
2016-10-17 17:17:01	minimalism	an issue about it was posted on debian's bug tracker as well
2016-10-17 17:23:00		[17:17]
2016-10-17 17:45:34	minimalism	that guy is giving me cancer
2016-10-17 17:45:34		[17:45]
2016-10-17 17:48:54	alyptik	he is either a troll or retarded
2016-10-17 17:49:04	alyptik	he does this a lot, banned from arch gen i think
2016-10-17 17:49:33	minimalism	I don't know how anyone could commit to that level of dumb behavior
2016-10-17 17:50:14	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-17 17:50:19	alyptik	wow
2016-10-17 17:50:26	alyptik	the symlink thing 
2016-10-17 17:50:45	minimalism	I don't know if it's something with the package he just installed
2016-10-17 17:50:50	minimalism	or if he's just doing that because he wants to
2016-10-17 17:50:59	minimalism	but either way, I'm beginning to suspect trolling a bit
2016-10-17 17:51:18	alyptik	yeah my money has been on troll
2016-10-17 17:52:02	minimalism	I called it at first because of the nick
2016-10-17 17:52:05	minimalism	and playing dumb
2016-10-17 17:52:12	minimalism	who nicks KKKrx
2016-10-17 17:52:15	minimalism	in that casing?
2016-10-17 17:52:34	minimalism	it's not banworthy or anything like tigrmesh surely believes it is, but
2016-10-17 17:52:44	minimalism	I think he knows he can taunt everyone with that
2016-10-17 17:52:50	alyptik	lol
2016-10-17 17:53:07	alyptik	didnt even think about username
2016-10-17 17:57:25	minimalism	the software choices will prove what's going on
2016-10-17 17:57:38	alyptik	heh
2016-10-17 17:58:45	minimalism	this son of a bitch..
2016-10-17 18:01:00	minimalism	he
2016-10-17 18:01:00		[18:01]
2016-10-17 18:01:05	minimalism	is just taunting me now
2016-10-17 18:07:00		[18:01]
2016-10-17 20:32:30	minimalism	just remembered something of interest I've been wanting with nix for a while
2016-10-17 20:32:30		[20:32]
2016-10-17 20:32:51	alyptik	hm?
2016-10-17 20:34:00	minimalism	an alternative startx
2016-10-17 20:34:04	minimalism	that doesn't use systemd in any way
2016-10-17 20:34:18	minimalism	even the authors of startx advise against using it lol
2016-10-17 20:34:31	alyptik	wow didn't even know it used systemd
2016-10-17 20:34:38	minimalism	it doesn't
2016-10-17 20:34:47	minimalism	but the only short alternative I know does have some systemd mentions
2016-10-17 20:35:00	minimalism	one of the arch people wrote it.. "rez-x"
2016-10-17 20:35:03	minimalism	fucking systemd line in there
2016-10-17 20:36:29	alyptik	i can't find it which line?
2016-10-17 20:37:13	minimalism	It's not in startx
2016-10-17 20:37:22	minimalism	it's just the only startx alternative does have mentions of systemd
2016-10-17 20:37:27	minimalism	https://gist.github.com/vodik/9442735
2016-10-17 20:37:34	alyptik	oh thats what you meant
2016-10-17 20:37:58	minimalism	the startx on gentoo fucking sucks
2016-10-17 20:38:09	minimalism	few different lines different, and it creates the serverauth file in $HOME
2016-10-17 20:38:11	minimalism	instead of /tmp
2016-10-17 20:39:03	alyptik	wat
2016-10-17 20:39:06	alyptik	that is weird
2016-10-17 20:40:48	alyptik	i can't think of a single good reason why
2016-10-17 20:41:45	minimalism	A major issue imo is how poorly a lot of system shell scripts are written
2016-10-17 20:41:53	minimalism	they look filthy, and the indentation/formatting is inconsistent and bad
2016-10-17 20:45:02	alyptik	yeah that's why i hate reading shell scripts
2016-10-17 20:45:17	alyptik	everyone should be as ocd with indenting as C devs
2016-10-17 20:45:33	minimalism	ocd should be a prerequisite for handling anything system critical
2016-10-17 20:45:43	alyptik	hah amen
2016-10-17 20:46:09	minimalism	if it were up to me.. I'd trim the fuck out of the FHS
2016-10-17 20:46:15	minimalism	remove useless dirs like media, srv
2016-10-17 20:46:21	minimalism	maybe even proc since sys was supposed to replace it
2016-10-17 20:48:03	alyptik	while i was making the FHS manpage package i was surprised just how fat the damn thing is
2016-10-17 20:48:03		[20:48]
2016-10-17 20:48:28	alyptik	2.6k lines to describe a filesystem standard
2016-10-17 20:49:05	minimalism	ridiculous
2016-10-17 20:49:29	minimalism	They should just let someone with ocd and a sense of minimalism and organization just redo the fucking thing
2016-10-17 20:49:35	minimalism	and then everyone can just accept it and update accordingly
2016-10-17 20:51:00	alyptik	lol there are 240 optional paths included
2016-10-17 20:51:22	minimalism	lib, lib32, lib64
2016-10-17 20:51:25	minimalism	they should all go too
2016-10-17 20:51:35	minimalism	I acknowledge bin has somewhat of a purpose for the base system, but
2016-10-17 20:52:08	alyptik	/media is stupid
2016-10-17 20:52:17	minimalism	entirely pointless
2016-10-17 20:52:24	minimalism	it's just rebranded /mnt
2016-10-17 20:52:39	alyptik	 i have never seen anyone use it ever except udisks
2016-10-17 20:52:42	minimalism	opt can fuck off too
2016-10-17 20:52:43	alyptik	go systemd hah
2016-10-17 20:52:58	alyptik	opt i can see some use for
2016-10-17 20:53:01	minimalism	I've used it, but only because
2016-10-17 20:53:09	alyptik	it where where i put all my bloat so it is easy to nuke
2016-10-17 20:53:11	minimalism	I wanted a place to store some software files that were global
2016-10-17 20:53:13	minimalism	rather than home
2016-10-17 20:53:15	minimalism	but still..
2016-10-17 20:53:19	minimalism	not really worth it
2016-10-17 20:53:24	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-17 20:53:29	alyptik	doesn't belong in a 'standard'
2016-10-17 20:53:50	minimalism	They should leverage /usr more
2016-10-17 20:53:57	minimalism	with optional subdirs for stupid bs
2016-10-17 20:54:17	alyptik	i put all my misc shit in /store
2016-10-17 20:54:19	minimalism	usr really is supposed to hold such things
2016-10-17 20:54:32	minimalism	I keep all my own scripts in /usr/local/bin and what not
2016-10-17 20:54:55	alyptik	i don't really like /usr/local, so i symlinked it to a dir in /store
2016-10-17 20:54:56	minimalism	/usr/* and /home/*/ need to be used properly instead of all this bs
2016-10-17 20:55:20	alyptik	/store/config is a git repo with ./scripts under that
2016-10-17 20:55:42	minimalism	logically..
2016-10-17 20:55:49	minimalism	the freebsd way makes sense, but
2016-10-17 20:55:54	minimalism	I still think it's wrong in some ways
2016-10-17 20:55:56	alyptik	/usr is basically / nowadays lol
2016-10-17 20:56:27	minimalism	tbh when we try to separate base system from additionally installed items
2016-10-17 20:56:29	minimalism	it becomes a mess
2016-10-17 20:56:57	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-17 20:56:59	minimalism	we should just get rid of bin, etc, lib, media, opt, proc, and all the other lib* except lib itself in usr
2016-10-17 20:57:03	minimalism	no more /usr/tmp either
2016-10-17 20:57:10	alyptik	wait what
2016-10-17 20:57:13	alyptik	why is that even a thing
2016-10-17 20:57:19	minimalism	because dumb bs
2016-10-17 20:57:24	minimalism	it's probably symlinked on arch as well
2016-10-17 20:58:02	alyptik	dont have it
2016-10-17 20:58:10	minimalism	it's symlinked on gentoo
2016-10-17 20:58:13	alyptik	is that like /var/tmp or smth
2016-10-17 20:58:20	alyptik	oh so not persistent
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[03:52:12] who nicks KKKrx [03:52:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:38		[21:03]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[03:52:15] in that casing? [03:52:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[03:52:34] it's not banworthy or anything like tigrmesh surely believes it is, but [03:52:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[03:52:44] I think he knows he can taunt everyone with that [03:52:44]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[03:57:25] the software choices will prove what's going on [03:57:25]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[03:58:45] this son of a bitch.. [03:58:45]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[04:01:00] he [04:01:00]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[04:01:05] is just taunting me now [04:01:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:32:30] just remembered something of interest I've been wanting with nix for a while [06:32:30]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:34:00] an alternative startx [06:34:00]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:34:04] that doesn't use systemd in any way [06:34:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:34:18] even the authors of startx advise against using it lol [06:34:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:34:38] it doesn't [06:34:38]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:34:47] but the only short alternative I know does have some systemd mentions [06:34:47]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:35:00] one of the arch people wrote it.. "rez-x" [06:35:00]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:35:03] fucking systemd line in there [06:35:03]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:37:13] It's not in startx [06:37:13]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:37:22] it's just the only startx alternative does have mentions of systemd [06:37:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:37:27] https://gist.github.com/vodik/9442735 [06:37:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:37:58] the startx on gentoo fucking sucks [06:37:58]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:38:09] few different lines different, and it creates the serverauth file in $HOME [06:38:09]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:38:10] instead of /tmp [06:38:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:41:45] A major issue imo is how poorly a lot of system shell scripts are written [06:41:45]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:41:53] they look filthy, and the indentation/formatting is inconsistent and bad [06:41:53]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:45:33] ocd should be a prerequisite for handling anything system critical [06:45:33]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:46:09] if it were up to me.. I'd trim the fuck out of the FHS [06:46:09]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:46:15] remove useless dirs like media, srv [06:46:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:46:21] maybe even proc since sys was supposed to replace it [06:46:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:49:05] ridiculous [06:49:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:49:29] They should just let someone with ocd and a sense of minimalism and organization just redo the fucking thing [06:49:29]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:49:35] and then everyone can just accept it and update accordingly [06:49:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:51:22] lib, lib32, lib64 [06:51:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:51:25] they should all go too [06:51:25]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:51:34] I acknowledge bin has somewhat of a purpose for the base system, but [06:51:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:52:17] entirely pointless [06:52:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:52:24] it's just rebranded /mnt [06:52:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:52:42] opt can fuck off too [06:52:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:01] I've used it, but only because [06:53:01]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:11] I wanted a place to store some software files that were global [06:53:11]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:13] rather than home [06:53:13]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:15] but still.. [06:53:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:19] not really worth it [06:53:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:50] They should leverage /usr more [06:53:50]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:57] with optional subdirs for stupid bs [06:53:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:54:19] usr really is supposed to hold such things [06:54:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:54:32] I keep all my own scripts in /usr/local/bin and what not [06:54:32]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:54:56] /usr/* and /home/*/ need to be used properly instead of all this bs [06:54:56]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:55:42] logically.. [06:55:42]

2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:57:19] because dumb bs [06:57:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:57:24] it's probably symlinked on arch as well [06:57:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:58:10] it's symlinked on gentoo [06:58:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:58:26]  /usr/tmp is symlinked to /tmp [06:58:26]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:58:34] arch changed its FHS a bit with symlinks and removing some stuff [06:58:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:59:24] even Alpine doesn't take modern ways and minimalism far enough [06:59:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[07:00:23] you know, if you get down to it [07:00:23]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[07:00:29] you can probably just remove usr itself [07:00:29]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[07:00:33] once you start really thinking about it [07:00:33]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[07:02:16] yep, remove usr and make your own local/bin to add to PATH in $HOME [07:02:16]
2016-10-17 21:03:40	minimalism	that should be the user's choice though
2016-10-17 21:03:42	minimalism	not in the FHS
2016-10-17 21:06:37	minimalism	One of these days I'm going to lose my mind and go rogue from Linux standards
2016-10-17 21:10:26	alyptik	lol
2016-10-17 21:10:41	alyptik	there should be RFCs for linux
2016-10-17 21:14:53	minimalism	also, everyone who creates config files in the root of $HOME/user needs to be thrown into a volcano

2016-10-18 14:40:35	alyptik	oh yeah i wasn't sure if you had this already but figured you'd find it useful
2016-10-18 14:40:55	alyptik	http://tinyurl.com/zsh-refcard-pdf
2016-10-18 14:41:26	alyptik	only other reference i have printed out besides ascii table
2016-10-18 14:43:53	minimalism	damn, I just realized I forgot what enabled shell commands to sort files logically
2016-10-18 14:43:55	minimalism	by number
2016-10-18 14:44:25	alyptik	what do you mean
2016-10-18 14:44:54	minimalism	ah just figured it out
2016-10-18 14:45:02	minimalism	it was because I was running this command from a script that had sh shebang
2016-10-18 14:45:06	minimalism	so it wasn't reading my aliases
2016-10-18 14:45:21	alyptik	oh hah i didn't know know shell scripts read aliases
2016-10-18 14:45:24	minimalism	by default.. shell is a retard that things
2016-10-18 14:45:26	alyptik	i always have written them without
2016-10-18 14:45:29	minimalism	after it goes 01-10
2016-10-18 14:45:32	minimalism	that 101 is next
2016-10-18 14:45:44	alyptik	lol yup
2016-10-18 14:45:45	minimalism	thinks*
2016-10-18 14:45:58	minimalism	so it makes watching Dragon Ball 01-153 a pain to do with a mpv cli command
2016-10-18 14:46:30	alyptik	for stuff i like i just use find -regex and rename the files
2016-10-18 14:46:38	alyptik	s/stuff/stuff like that
2016-10-18 14:46:48	minimalism	I have a consistent file naming system for all of my files
2016-10-18 14:46:51	minimalism	so no way on that
2016-10-18 14:46:56	alyptik	heh
2016-10-18 14:47:11	alyptik	what do you accomplish it with?
2016-10-18 14:47:12	alyptik	sort?
2016-10-18 14:47:17	minimalism	I won't even tolerate full metadata
2016-10-18 14:47:23	minimalism	accomplish what with
2016-10-18 14:47:37	alyptik	so it doesn't sort it in that stupid way
2016-10-18 14:47:48	minimalism	all coreutils are aliased for me in zsh basically
2016-10-18 14:47:55	minimalism	with my preferred flags/timestamp format
2016-10-18 14:48:02	alyptik	smart
2016-10-18 14:48:06	alyptik	i did that with a few like grep
2016-10-18 14:48:20	minimalism	-I can be a pretty useful flag for that.. but I don't alias grep
2016-10-18 14:48:24	minimalism	-I can be wrong
2016-10-18 14:48:37	minimalism	ls -AFhlv --color=auto --time-style=+"%m-%d-%Y %I:%M %p %Z"
2016-10-18 14:48:38	minimalism	my ls alias
2016-10-18 14:49:07	alyptik	lets see what mine is
2016-10-18 14:49:17	alyptik	ls -lAhqiQFs  --color=auto
2016-10-18 14:49:27	alyptik	more bloaty
2016-10-18 14:49:33	alyptik	i am stealing that time style thing though
2016-10-18 14:49:53	minimalism	I declare war on three letter abbreviations of months/days, daylight savings time, and the current numerical date format
2016-10-18 14:50:35	alyptik	lol
2016-10-18 14:51:02	minimalism	I'd vote for whoever gets rid of DST
2016-10-18 14:51:12	minimalism	it's so pointless, and not everyone even wants to follow it
2016-10-18 14:51:26	alyptik	it is good pretty much only for farmers i think
2016-10-18 14:51:39	alyptik	in hawaii we just happily ignore DST
2016-10-18 14:51:43	alyptik	life is pretty good
2016-10-18 14:51:48	minimalism	I don't see how it benefits farmers though
2016-10-18 14:51:56	alyptik	no idea, just what i've heard
2016-10-18 14:51:57	minimalism	it makes the nights shorter during the winter.. but I guess during summer
2016-10-18 14:52:09	minimalism	it helps I guess, but it's not worth pissing everyone off like this
2016-10-18 14:52:11	minimalism	it's just a number
2016-10-18 14:52:19	minimalism	they can just wake up earlier by an hour during the summer
2016-10-18 14:52:23	alyptik	lol
2016-10-18 14:53:31	minimalism	DST just makes it get dark at 4 PM during the winter
2016-10-18 14:53:34	minimalism	instead of 5
2016-10-18 14:53:39	minimalism	makes more sense than anything ever, ever.
2016-10-18 14:54:35	alyptik	ack m-d-y
2016-10-18 14:54:54	alyptik	my ocd can't permit anything other than y-m-d
2016-10-18 14:54:54		[14:54]
2016-10-18 14:55:50	minimalism	I personally prefer MM-DD-YYYY, but if the world had to agree on one format
2016-10-18 14:56:04	minimalism	I could do with YYYY-MM-DD
