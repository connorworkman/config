2016-10-17 13:36:06	minimalism	Noticed before I logged off yesterday that one init script for macchanger doesn't seem to want to go off before vpn
2016-10-17 13:36:06		[13:36]
2016-10-17 13:36:49	<--	minimalism (~none@unaffiliated/minimalism) has quit (Client Quit)
2016-10-17 13:37:05	-->	minimalism (~none@unaffiliated/minimalism) is back on server
2016-10-17 13:43:00		[13:37]
2016-10-17 13:57:34	alyptik	you change your mac?
2016-10-17 14:03:00		[13:57]
2016-10-17 14:04:15	minimalism	yeah
2016-10-17 14:04:20	minimalism	I had it set on arch to change on boot
2016-10-17 14:04:25	minimalism	then start vpn
2016-10-17 14:05:36	alyptik	ah and using openrc right? i don't have much experience with writing inits for that
2016-10-17 14:11:00		[14:05]
2016-10-17 14:17:00		[14:11]
2016-10-17 14:27:15	minimalism	I wrote one for it with just a start() function
2016-10-17 14:28:00	minimalism	but it's something that just fires once, can't be stopped or anything
2016-10-17 14:28:52	alyptik	ah
2016-10-17 14:29:01	alyptik	weird, maybe there is a race condition or something
2016-10-17 14:35:00		[14:29]
2016-10-17 14:44:46	minimalism	I set a before and after
2016-10-17 14:44:56	minimalism	it's probably some difference of behavior in booting
2016-10-17 14:45:15	minimalism	an odd thing I noticed is it seems.. "seems" to be able to change MAC on an interface that is currently up
2016-10-17 14:45:22	minimalism	without going up and down
2016-10-17 14:45:29	minimalism	it didn't work that way on arch
2016-10-17 14:45:40	alyptik	that shouldn't work .-.
2016-10-17 14:46:08	minimalism	people don't think it be like it is, but it do
2016-10-17 14:46:15	alyptik	lol
2016-10-17 14:46:29	minimalism	I just did it
2016-10-17 14:46:38	alyptik	well i guess it would be ok for you but your router would freak out afaik
2016-10-17 14:46:49	alyptik	ARP tables would be f'ed up 
2016-10-17 14:47:55	minimalism	 /etc/init.d/macchanger restart
2016-10-17 14:47:56	minimalism	New MAC: *redacted*         [ ok ]
2016-10-17 14:47:56	<--	minimalism (~none@unaffiliated/minimalism) has quit (Quit: minimalism)
2016-10-17 14:49:36	-->	minimalism (~none@unaffiliated/minimalism) is back on server
2016-10-17 14:51:19	minimalism	Apparently it doesn't work. It just looks like it does.. which is weird
2016-10-17 14:51:19		[14:51]
2016-10-17 14:51:38	alyptik	yeah it is strange it didn't throw an error
2016-10-17 14:51:50	minimalism	It still shows the VPN as on and everything
2016-10-17 14:51:53	minimalism	even changes the MAC
2016-10-17 14:52:03	minimalism	everything looks alright until you actually try using something requiring a connection
2016-10-17 14:52:06	minimalism	then it's just hanging
2016-10-17 14:52:53	alyptik	yeah the arp handler on your router prob was freaking out
2016-10-17 14:58:00		[14:52]
2016-10-17 14:59:53	minimalism	beginning to worry I did something making gentoo not use my GPU
2016-10-17 15:00:04	minimalism	it may just be a bug with screenfetch but unsure
2016-10-17 15:00:13	alyptik	huh how come
2016-10-17 15:00:27	minimalism	screenfetch isn't returning my GPU except in root, however
2016-10-17 15:00:38	minimalism	a lot of commands used to return hardware information are restricted in gentoo
2016-10-17 15:00:42	minimalism	they're unusable outside of root
2016-10-17 15:00:56	minimalism	blkid, lspci, etc.
2016-10-17 15:00:59	minimalism	won't tell you anything
2016-10-17 15:01:43	alyptik	from the script:
2016-10-17 15:01:43	alyptik	gpu_info=$($(PATH="/usr/bin:$PATH" type -p lspci | cut -f1) 2> /dev/null | grep VGA)
2016-10-17 15:01:51	alyptik	see if that works for you without root
2016-10-17 15:03:08	minimalism	seems awfully intricate for whatever that does
2016-10-17 15:03:11	minimalism	with lspci
2016-10-17 15:03:45	alyptik	prob meant to portable as possible
2016-10-17 15:03:50	minimalism	It doesn't work though
2016-10-17 15:04:03	alyptik	ah i guess lspci is root only
2016-10-17 15:04:03	minimalism	lspci is just plain restricted outside of root.. mentioned something similar in gentoo about blkid the other day
2016-10-17 15:04:09	minimalism	they claim it's not restricted, but
2016-10-17 15:04:15	minimalism	it got into a semantic argument
2016-10-17 15:04:38	minimalism	I know it's detecting the card as being there, however
2016-10-17 15:04:45	minimalism	I'm trying to think of a definitive way to see it's being used
2016-10-17 15:04:50	minimalism	right now in action on X and with any graphical program
2016-10-17 15:05:21	alyptik	try grep -i --color memory /var/log/Xorg.0.log 
2016-10-17 15:05:58	alyptik	or wherever your xorg log it
2016-10-17 15:06:01	alyptik	s/it/is
2016-10-17 15:07:42	minimalism	you know you can just set grep colors in env
2016-10-17 15:07:59	alyptik	just pasting from my aliases file
2016-10-17 15:08:08	alyptik	that is an old one gpumeminfo= lol
2016-10-17 15:08:17	minimalism	you're looking for the word "memory" in those files?
2016-10-17 15:08:19	minimalism	why
2016-10-17 15:08:43	alyptik	i have no clue tbh
2016-10-17 15:08:53	alyptik	i just grepped gpu in my aliases file
2016-10-17 15:09:33	alyptik	i think that alias is from like 2 years ago; so if it doesn't work not surprsed
2016-10-17 15:10:34	minimalism	I've looked through xorg log before and saw mentions of radeon but I'm getting suspicious since it doesn't mention my exact model
2016-10-17 15:10:40	minimalism	and it tries to load vesa for some reason
2016-10-17 15:11:16	alyptik	don't know enough about ati to know what vesa is
2016-10-17 15:11:39	minimalism	vesa and mesa
2016-10-17 15:12:06	alyptik	oh and ati doesn't use vesa?
2016-10-17 15:12:13	minimalism	I don't think so
2016-10-17 15:12:19	minimalism	I think it's a nvidia thing
2016-10-17 15:14:41	minimalism	I can't wait to see how efficiently this system runs when I'm done trimming packages with USE flags, fully completing a perfect kernel config, a solid initramfs
2016-10-17 15:14:41		[15:14]
2016-10-17 15:14:49	minimalism	some looking over firmware loaded etc.
2016-10-17 15:14:52	minimalism	removing a fuckton of modules
2016-10-17 15:15:11	alyptik	kernel config is an art
2016-10-17 15:15:20	alyptik	where rice meets useful
2016-10-17 15:15:29	minimalism	The besy way to do it is probably remove everything then go from there
2016-10-17 15:15:31	minimalism	best*
2016-10-17 15:15:53	alyptik	i like to start from makelocalmod config
2016-10-17 15:16:01	alyptik	make localmodconfig*
2016-10-17 15:16:13	minimalism	I'm not familiar
2016-10-17 15:16:34	alyptik	it sets every module not currently loaded to N
2016-10-17 15:16:49	minimalism	Ahh, that's what I've been wanting
2016-10-17 15:16:55	minimalism	I should boot arch and then run that
2016-10-17 15:17:03	minimalism	it'll give me a better idea of what I don't need
2016-10-17 15:17:07	minimalism	then trim some more for gentoo
2016-10-17 15:17:09	alyptik	and afaik it does make oldconfig for the rest
2016-10-17 15:21:17	alyptik	do you bother with cgroups?
2016-10-17 15:21:24	alyptik	trying to decide if worth learning
2016-10-17 15:21:49	minimalism	haven't looked into them at all
2016-10-17 15:22:07	minimalism	Did you get tox working?
2016-10-17 15:22:13	alyptik	yup
2016-10-17 15:22:25	alyptik	was pretty painless
2016-10-17 15:22:33	alyptik	looked at config but didn't touch
2016-10-17 15:22:38	alyptik	didn't really know what does what yet
2016-10-17 15:22:58	minimalism	I basically just changed its default or not color setting
2016-10-17 15:23:04	minimalism	change time_format and timestamp_fornat
2016-10-17 15:23:10	minimalism	the characters displayed for line_*
2016-10-17 15:23:17	minimalism	changed the away_note to AFK
2016-10-17 15:23:27	minimalism	set the input/output device numbers
2016-10-17 15:23:37	minimalism	set my download_path for where to save transferred files
2016-10-17 15:23:42	minimalism	set my path to my avatar image
2016-10-17 15:24:02	minimalism	then after that it's basically just some keybinds for stuff, and able to set custom sound files
2016-10-17 15:30:00		[15:24]
2016-10-17 15:39:13	alyptik	what is the arch of Gentoo Linux Alpha Handbook
2016-10-17 15:39:30	alyptik	doesn't really say
2016-10-17 15:40:38	alyptik	it says 64-bit but i don't understand if it is x86_64 or a seperate proprietary one
2016-10-17 15:42:34	minimalism	no idea
2016-10-17 15:42:40	minimalism	I just read amd64 and Linux Sea
2016-10-17 15:43:34	alyptik	oh googling finally turned up something; it is some obscure proprietary one
2016-10-17 15:43:42	alyptik	name is misleading
2016-10-17 15:49:00		[15:43]
2016-10-17 16:27:56	minimalism	trying to determine if I need egl support enabled
2016-10-17 16:27:56		[16:27]
2016-10-17 16:28:00	minimalism	mpv is claiming it's not on
2016-10-17 16:31:21	minimalism	>mpv running >mpd+ncmpcpp running >tmux+weechat+toxic running >chromium running >850 MiB RAM used
2016-10-17 16:31:24	minimalism	that's what's up
2016-10-17 16:37:00		[16:31]
2016-10-17 16:43:53	alyptik	sorry was eating
2016-10-17 16:44:13	alyptik	i do like egl more than glc
2016-10-17 16:44:16	alyptik	glx*
2016-10-17 16:44:21	alyptik	but not needed i think
2016-10-17 16:50:00		[16:44]
2016-10-17 17:16:52	minimalism	the issue was mpv being strict enough to demand specifying the backend as x11 for some reason
2016-10-17 17:16:52		[17:16]
2016-10-17 17:17:01	minimalism	an issue about it was posted on debian's bug tracker as well
2016-10-17 17:23:00		[17:17]
2016-10-17 17:45:34	minimalism	that guy is giving me cancer
2016-10-17 17:45:34		[17:45]
2016-10-17 17:48:54	alyptik	he is either a troll or retarded
2016-10-17 17:49:04	alyptik	he does this a lot, banned from arch gen i think
2016-10-17 17:49:33	minimalism	I don't know how anyone could commit to that level of dumb behavior
2016-10-17 17:50:14	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-17 17:50:19	alyptik	wow
2016-10-17 17:50:26	alyptik	the symlink thing 
2016-10-17 17:50:45	minimalism	I don't know if it's something with the package he just installed
2016-10-17 17:50:50	minimalism	or if he's just doing that because he wants to
2016-10-17 17:50:59	minimalism	but either way, I'm beginning to suspect trolling a bit
2016-10-17 17:51:18	alyptik	yeah my money has been on troll
2016-10-17 17:52:02	minimalism	I called it at first because of the nick
2016-10-17 17:52:05	minimalism	and playing dumb
2016-10-17 17:52:12	minimalism	who nicks KKKrx
2016-10-17 17:52:15	minimalism	in that casing?
2016-10-17 17:52:34	minimalism	it's not banworthy or anything like tigrmesh surely believes it is, but
2016-10-17 17:52:44	minimalism	I think he knows he can taunt everyone with that
2016-10-17 17:52:50	alyptik	lol
2016-10-17 17:53:07	alyptik	didnt even think about username
2016-10-17 17:57:25	minimalism	the software choices will prove what's going on
2016-10-17 17:57:38	alyptik	heh
2016-10-17 17:58:45	minimalism	this son of a bitch..
2016-10-17 18:01:00	minimalism	he
2016-10-17 18:01:00		[18:01]
2016-10-17 18:01:05	minimalism	is just taunting me now
2016-10-17 18:07:00		[18:01]
2016-10-17 20:32:30	minimalism	just remembered something of interest I've been wanting with nix for a while
2016-10-17 20:32:30		[20:32]
2016-10-17 20:32:51	alyptik	hm?
2016-10-17 20:34:00	minimalism	an alternative startx
2016-10-17 20:34:04	minimalism	that doesn't use systemd in any way
2016-10-17 20:34:18	minimalism	even the authors of startx advise against using it lol
2016-10-17 20:34:31	alyptik	wow didn't even know it used systemd
2016-10-17 20:34:38	minimalism	it doesn't
2016-10-17 20:34:47	minimalism	but the only short alternative I know does have some systemd mentions
2016-10-17 20:35:00	minimalism	one of the arch people wrote it.. "rez-x"
2016-10-17 20:35:03	minimalism	fucking systemd line in there
2016-10-17 20:36:29	alyptik	i can't find it which line?
2016-10-17 20:37:13	minimalism	It's not in startx
2016-10-17 20:37:22	minimalism	it's just the only startx alternative does have mentions of systemd
2016-10-17 20:37:27	minimalism	https://gist.github.com/vodik/9442735
2016-10-17 20:37:34	alyptik	oh thats what you meant
2016-10-17 20:37:58	minimalism	the startx on gentoo fucking sucks
2016-10-17 20:38:09	minimalism	few different lines different, and it creates the serverauth file in $HOME
2016-10-17 20:38:11	minimalism	instead of /tmp
2016-10-17 20:39:03	alyptik	wat
2016-10-17 20:39:06	alyptik	that is weird
2016-10-17 20:40:48	alyptik	i can't think of a single good reason why
2016-10-17 20:41:45	minimalism	A major issue imo is how poorly a lot of system shell scripts are written
2016-10-17 20:41:53	minimalism	they look filthy, and the indentation/formatting is inconsistent and bad
2016-10-17 20:45:02	alyptik	yeah that's why i hate reading shell scripts
2016-10-17 20:45:17	alyptik	everyone should be as ocd with indenting as C devs
2016-10-17 20:45:33	minimalism	ocd should be a prerequisite for handling anything system critical
2016-10-17 20:45:43	alyptik	hah amen
2016-10-17 20:46:09	minimalism	if it were up to me.. I'd trim the fuck out of the FHS
2016-10-17 20:46:15	minimalism	remove useless dirs like media, srv
2016-10-17 20:46:21	minimalism	maybe even proc since sys was supposed to replace it
2016-10-17 20:48:03	alyptik	while i was making the FHS manpage package i was surprised just how fat the damn thing is
2016-10-17 20:48:03		[20:48]
2016-10-17 20:48:28	alyptik	2.6k lines to describe a filesystem standard
2016-10-17 20:49:05	minimalism	ridiculous
2016-10-17 20:49:29	minimalism	They should just let someone with ocd and a sense of minimalism and organization just redo the fucking thing
2016-10-17 20:49:35	minimalism	and then everyone can just accept it and update accordingly
2016-10-17 20:51:00	alyptik	lol there are 240 optional paths included
2016-10-17 20:51:22	minimalism	lib, lib32, lib64
2016-10-17 20:51:25	minimalism	they should all go too
2016-10-17 20:51:35	minimalism	I acknowledge bin has somewhat of a purpose for the base system, but
2016-10-17 20:52:08	alyptik	/media is stupid
2016-10-17 20:52:17	minimalism	entirely pointless
2016-10-17 20:52:24	minimalism	it's just rebranded /mnt
2016-10-17 20:52:39	alyptik	 i have never seen anyone use it ever except udisks
2016-10-17 20:52:42	minimalism	opt can fuck off too
2016-10-17 20:52:43	alyptik	go systemd hah
2016-10-17 20:52:58	alyptik	opt i can see some use for
2016-10-17 20:53:01	minimalism	I've used it, but only because
2016-10-17 20:53:09	alyptik	it where where i put all my bloat so it is easy to nuke
2016-10-17 20:53:11	minimalism	I wanted a place to store some software files that were global
2016-10-17 20:53:13	minimalism	rather than home
2016-10-17 20:53:15	minimalism	but still..
2016-10-17 20:53:19	minimalism	not really worth it
2016-10-17 20:53:24	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-17 20:53:29	alyptik	doesn't belong in a 'standard'
2016-10-17 20:53:50	minimalism	They should leverage /usr more
2016-10-17 20:53:57	minimalism	with optional subdirs for stupid bs
2016-10-17 20:54:17	alyptik	i put all my misc shit in /store
2016-10-17 20:54:19	minimalism	usr really is supposed to hold such things
2016-10-17 20:54:32	minimalism	I keep all my own scripts in /usr/local/bin and what not
2016-10-17 20:54:55	alyptik	i don't really like /usr/local, so i symlinked it to a dir in /store
2016-10-17 20:54:56	minimalism	/usr/* and /home/*/ need to be used properly instead of all this bs
2016-10-17 20:55:20	alyptik	/store/config is a git repo with ./scripts under that
2016-10-17 20:55:42	minimalism	logically..
2016-10-17 20:55:49	minimalism	the freebsd way makes sense, but
2016-10-17 20:55:54	minimalism	I still think it's wrong in some ways
2016-10-17 20:55:56	alyptik	/usr is basically / nowadays lol
2016-10-17 20:56:27	minimalism	tbh when we try to separate base system from additionally installed items
2016-10-17 20:56:29	minimalism	it becomes a mess
2016-10-17 20:56:57	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-17 20:56:59	minimalism	we should just get rid of bin, etc, lib, media, opt, proc, and all the other lib* except lib itself in usr
2016-10-17 20:57:03	minimalism	no more /usr/tmp either
2016-10-17 20:57:10	alyptik	wait what
2016-10-17 20:57:13	alyptik	why is that even a thing
2016-10-17 20:57:19	minimalism	because dumb bs
2016-10-17 20:57:24	minimalism	it's probably symlinked on arch as well
2016-10-17 20:58:02	alyptik	dont have it
2016-10-17 20:58:10	minimalism	it's symlinked on gentoo
2016-10-17 20:58:13	alyptik	is that like /var/tmp or smth
2016-10-17 20:58:20	alyptik	oh so not persistent
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[03:52:12] who nicks KKKrx [03:52:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:38		[21:03]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[03:52:15] in that casing? [03:52:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[03:52:34] it's not banworthy or anything like tigrmesh surely believes it is, but [03:52:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[03:52:44] I think he knows he can taunt everyone with that [03:52:44]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[03:57:25] the software choices will prove what's going on [03:57:25]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[03:58:45] this son of a bitch.. [03:58:45]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[04:01:00] he [04:01:00]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[04:01:05] is just taunting me now [04:01:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:32:30] just remembered something of interest I've been wanting with nix for a while [06:32:30]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:34:00] an alternative startx [06:34:00]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:34:04] that doesn't use systemd in any way [06:34:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:34:18] even the authors of startx advise against using it lol [06:34:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:34:38] it doesn't [06:34:38]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:34:47] but the only short alternative I know does have some systemd mentions [06:34:47]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:35:00] one of the arch people wrote it.. "rez-x" [06:35:00]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:35:03] fucking systemd line in there [06:35:03]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:37:13] It's not in startx [06:37:13]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:37:22] it's just the only startx alternative does have mentions of systemd [06:37:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:37:27] https://gist.github.com/vodik/9442735 [06:37:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:37:58] the startx on gentoo fucking sucks [06:37:58]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:38:09] few different lines different, and it creates the serverauth file in $HOME [06:38:09]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:38:10] instead of /tmp [06:38:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:41:45] A major issue imo is how poorly a lot of system shell scripts are written [06:41:45]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:41:53] they look filthy, and the indentation/formatting is inconsistent and bad [06:41:53]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:45:33] ocd should be a prerequisite for handling anything system critical [06:45:33]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:46:09] if it were up to me.. I'd trim the fuck out of the FHS [06:46:09]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:46:15] remove useless dirs like media, srv [06:46:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:46:21] maybe even proc since sys was supposed to replace it [06:46:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:49:05] ridiculous [06:49:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:49:29] They should just let someone with ocd and a sense of minimalism and organization just redo the fucking thing [06:49:29]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:49:35] and then everyone can just accept it and update accordingly [06:49:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:51:22] lib, lib32, lib64 [06:51:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:51:25] they should all go too [06:51:25]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:51:34] I acknowledge bin has somewhat of a purpose for the base system, but [06:51:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:52:17] entirely pointless [06:52:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:52:24] it's just rebranded /mnt [06:52:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:52:42] opt can fuck off too [06:52:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:01] I've used it, but only because [06:53:01]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:11] I wanted a place to store some software files that were global [06:53:11]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:13] rather than home [06:53:13]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:15] but still.. [06:53:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:19] not really worth it [06:53:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:50] They should leverage /usr more [06:53:50]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:53:57] with optional subdirs for stupid bs [06:53:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:54:19] usr really is supposed to hold such things [06:54:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:54:32] I keep all my own scripts in /usr/local/bin and what not [06:54:32]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:54:56] /usr/* and /home/*/ need to be used properly instead of all this bs [06:54:56]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:55:42] logically.. [06:55:42]

2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:57:19] because dumb bs [06:57:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:57:24] it's probably symlinked on arch as well [06:57:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:58:10] it's symlinked on gentoo [06:58:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:58:26]  /usr/tmp is symlinked to /tmp [06:58:26]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:58:34] arch changed its FHS a bit with symlinks and removing some stuff [06:58:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[06:59:24] even Alpine doesn't take modern ways and minimalism far enough [06:59:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[07:00:23] you know, if you get down to it [07:00:23]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[07:00:29] you can probably just remove usr itself [07:00:29]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[07:00:33] once you start really thinking about it [07:00:33]
2016-10-17 21:03:38	minimalism	[07:02:16] yep, remove usr and make your own local/bin to add to PATH in $HOME [07:02:16]
2016-10-17 21:03:40	minimalism	that should be the user's choice though
2016-10-17 21:03:42	minimalism	not in the FHS
2016-10-17 21:06:37	minimalism	One of these days I'm going to lose my mind and go rogue from Linux standards
2016-10-17 21:10:26	alyptik	lol
2016-10-17 21:10:41	alyptik	there should be RFCs for linux
2016-10-17 21:14:53	minimalism	also, everyone who creates config files in the root of $HOME/user needs to be thrown into a volcano

2016-10-18 14:40:35	alyptik	oh yeah i wasn't sure if you had this already but figured you'd find it useful
2016-10-18 14:40:55	alyptik	http://tinyurl.com/zsh-refcard-pdf
2016-10-18 14:41:26	alyptik	only other reference i have printed out besides ascii table
2016-10-18 14:43:53	minimalism	damn, I just realized I forgot what enabled shell commands to sort files logically
2016-10-18 14:43:55	minimalism	by number
2016-10-18 14:44:25	alyptik	what do you mean
2016-10-18 14:44:54	minimalism	ah just figured it out
2016-10-18 14:45:02	minimalism	it was because I was running this command from a script that had sh shebang
2016-10-18 14:45:06	minimalism	so it wasn't reading my aliases
2016-10-18 14:45:21	alyptik	oh hah i didn't know know shell scripts read aliases
2016-10-18 14:45:24	minimalism	by default.. shell is a retard that things
2016-10-18 14:45:26	alyptik	i always have written them without
2016-10-18 14:45:29	minimalism	after it goes 01-10
2016-10-18 14:45:32	minimalism	that 101 is next
2016-10-18 14:45:44	alyptik	lol yup
2016-10-18 14:45:45	minimalism	thinks*
2016-10-18 14:45:58	minimalism	so it makes watching Dragon Ball 01-153 a pain to do with a mpv cli command
2016-10-18 14:46:30	alyptik	for stuff i like i just use find -regex and rename the files
2016-10-18 14:46:38	alyptik	s/stuff/stuff like that
2016-10-18 14:46:48	minimalism	I have a consistent file naming system for all of my files
2016-10-18 14:46:51	minimalism	so no way on that
2016-10-18 14:46:56	alyptik	heh
2016-10-18 14:47:11	alyptik	what do you accomplish it with?
2016-10-18 14:47:12	alyptik	sort?
2016-10-18 14:47:17	minimalism	I won't even tolerate full metadata
2016-10-18 14:47:23	minimalism	accomplish what with
2016-10-18 14:47:37	alyptik	so it doesn't sort it in that stupid way
2016-10-18 14:47:48	minimalism	all coreutils are aliased for me in zsh basically
2016-10-18 14:47:55	minimalism	with my preferred flags/timestamp format
2016-10-18 14:48:02	alyptik	smart
2016-10-18 14:48:06	alyptik	i did that with a few like grep
2016-10-18 14:48:20	minimalism	-I can be a pretty useful flag for that.. but I don't alias grep
2016-10-18 14:48:24	minimalism	-I can be wrong
2016-10-18 14:48:37	minimalism	ls -AFhlv --color=auto --time-style=+"%m-%d-%Y %I:%M %p %Z"
2016-10-18 14:48:38	minimalism	my ls alias
2016-10-18 14:49:07	alyptik	lets see what mine is
2016-10-18 14:49:17	alyptik	ls -lAhqiQFs  --color=auto
2016-10-18 14:49:27	alyptik	more bloaty
2016-10-18 14:49:33	alyptik	i am stealing that time style thing though
2016-10-18 14:49:53	minimalism	I declare war on three letter abbreviations of months/days, daylight savings time, and the current numerical date format
2016-10-18 14:50:35	alyptik	lol
2016-10-18 14:51:02	minimalism	I'd vote for whoever gets rid of DST
2016-10-18 14:51:12	minimalism	it's so pointless, and not everyone even wants to follow it
2016-10-18 14:51:26	alyptik	it is good pretty much only for farmers i think
2016-10-18 14:51:39	alyptik	in hawaii we just happily ignore DST
2016-10-18 14:51:43	alyptik	life is pretty good
2016-10-18 14:51:48	minimalism	I don't see how it benefits farmers though
2016-10-18 14:51:56	alyptik	no idea, just what i've heard
2016-10-18 14:51:57	minimalism	it makes the nights shorter during the winter.. but I guess during summer
2016-10-18 14:52:09	minimalism	it helps I guess, but it's not worth pissing everyone off like this
2016-10-18 14:52:11	minimalism	it's just a number
2016-10-18 14:52:19	minimalism	they can just wake up earlier by an hour during the summer
2016-10-18 14:52:23	alyptik	lol
2016-10-18 14:53:31	minimalism	DST just makes it get dark at 4 PM during the winter
2016-10-18 14:53:34	minimalism	instead of 5
2016-10-18 14:53:39	minimalism	makes more sense than anything ever, ever.
2016-10-18 14:54:35	alyptik	ack m-d-y
2016-10-18 14:54:54	alyptik	my ocd can't permit anything other than y-m-d
2016-10-18 14:54:54		[14:54]
2016-10-18 14:55:50	minimalism	I personally prefer MM-DD-YYYY, but if the world had to agree on one format
2016-10-18 14:56:04	minimalism	I could do with YYYY-MM-DD
2016-10-18 14:57:51	alyptik	i like y-m-d because it it a nice comprimise
2016-10-18 14:57:57	alyptik	d-m-y is too fucking weird
2016-10-18 15:03:00		[14:57]
2016-10-18 15:09:34	minimalism	heh
2016-10-18 15:09:40	minimalism	Do you have an SBC? Like a pi or beaglebone?
2016-10-18 15:13:59	minimalism	I've just been thinking about it because I want to install Alpine on something .. do something cool with it
2016-10-18 15:16:28	minimalism	I was thinking about trying Alpine as a desktop on my second drive, but
2016-10-18 15:16:39	minimalism	it'd be cool to have a dedicated machine for Alpine.. for whatever I'd use it for
2016-10-18 15:17:25	minimalism	I wish beaglebone would get its shit together
2016-10-18 15:17:27	minimalism	and release a new model
2016-10-18 15:20:36	minimalism	think it'd be cool since Alpine is mostly made for both amd64 and ARM
2016-10-18 15:20:36		[15:20]
2016-10-18 15:20:50	minimalism	it's already trim as can be, so no debian grievances
2016-10-18 15:21:51	minimalism	debian is the worst thing in computing
2016-10-18 15:27:00		[15:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[06:58:26]  /usr/tmp is symlinked to /tmp [06:58:26]
2016-10-18 23:55:26		[23:55]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[06:58:34] arch changed its FHS a bit with symlinks and removing some stuff [06:58:34]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[06:59:24] even Alpine doesn't take modern ways and minimalism far enough [06:59:24]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[07:00:23] you know, if you get down to it [07:00:23]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[07:00:29] you can probably just remove usr itself [07:00:29]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[07:00:33] once you start really thinking about it [07:00:33]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[07:02:16] yep, remove usr and make your own local/bin to add to PATH in $HOME [07:02:16]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[07:03:40] that should be the user's choice though [07:03:40]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[07:03:42] not in the FHS [07:03:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[07:06:37] One of these days I'm going to lose my mind and go rogue from Linux standards [07:06:37]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[07:14:53] also, everyone who creates config files in the root of $HOME/user needs to be thrown into a volcano [07:14:53]
2016-10-18 23:55:26	minimalism	[00:39:48] Another day. Another thing to configure on gentoo. [00:39:48]

2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[07:06:37] One of these days I'm going to lose my mind and go rogue from Linux standards [07:06:37]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[07:14:53] also, everyone who creates config files in the root of $HOME/user needs to be thrown into a volcano [07:14:53]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:39:48] Another day. Another thing to configure on gentoo. [00:39:48]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:43:53] damn, I just realized I forgot what enabled shell commands to sort files logically [00:43:53]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:43:55] by number [00:43:55]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:44:54] ah just figured it out [00:44:54]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:45:02] it was because I was running this command from a script that had sh shebang [00:45:02]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:45:06] so it wasn't reading my aliases [00:45:06]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:45:24] by default.. shell is a retard that things [00:45:24]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:45:29] after it goes 01-10 [00:45:29]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:45:32] that 101 is next [00:45:32]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:45:45] thinks* [00:45:45]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:45:57] so it makes watching Dragon Ball 01-153 a pain to do with a mpv cli command [00:45:57]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:46:48] I have a consistent file naming system for all of my files [00:46:48]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:46:51] so no way on that [00:46:51]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:47:17] I won't even tolerate full metadata [00:47:17]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:47:23] accomplish what with [00:47:23]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:47:48] all coreutils are aliased for me in zsh basically [00:47:48]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:47:55] with my preferred flags/timestamp format [00:47:55]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:48:19] -I can be a pretty useful flag for that.. but I don't alias grep [00:48:19]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:48:24] -I can be wrong [00:48:24]

2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:49:53] I declare war on three letter abbreviations of months/days, daylight savings time, and the current numerical date format [00:49:53]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:51:02] I'd vote for whoever gets rid of DST [00:51:02]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:51:12] it's so pointless, and not everyone even wants to follow it [00:51:12]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:51:48] I don't see how it benefits farmers though [00:51:48]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:51:57] it makes the nights shorter during the winter.. but I guess during summer [00:51:57]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:52:09] it helps I guess, but it's not worth pissing everyone off like this [00:52:09]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:52:11] it's just a number [00:52:11]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:52:19] they can just wake up earlier by an hour during the summer [00:52:19]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:53:31] DST just makes it get dark at 4 PM during the winter [00:53:31]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:53:34] instead of 5 [00:53:34]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:53:39] makes more sense than anything ever, ever. [00:53:39]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:55:50] I personally prefer MM-DD-YYYY, but if the world had to agree on one format [00:55:50]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[00:56:04] I could do with YYYY-MM-DD [00:56:04]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[01:09:34] heh [01:09:34]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[01:09:40] Do you have an SBC? Like a pi or beaglebone? [01:09:40]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[01:13:59] I've just been thinking about it because I want to install Alpine on something .. do something cool with it [01:13:59]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[01:16:28] I was thinking about trying Alpine as a desktop on my second drive, but [01:16:28]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[01:16:39] it'd be cool to have a dedicated machine for Alpine.. for whatever I'd use it for [01:16:39]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[01:17:25] I wish beaglebone would get its shit together [01:17:25]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[01:17:27] and release a new model [01:17:27]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[01:20:36] think it'd be cool since Alpine is mostly made for both amd64 and ARM [01:20:36]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[01:20:50] it's already trim as can be, so no debian grievances [01:20:50]
2016-10-20 00:25:37	minimalism	[01:21:51] debian is the worst thing in computing [01:21:51]

2016-10-25 11:57:27	alyptik	yeah this seems safer than just setting a USE flag by itself
2016-10-25 11:57:40	minimalism	depends
2016-10-25 11:57:59	minimalism	gentoo has multiple versions of everything, and sometimes things don't exist or have changed drastically between versions
2016-10-25 11:58:05	minimalism	some are safe to set a general USE flag for all versions
2016-10-25 11:58:12	minimalism	most of mine for example are for all versions
2016-10-25 11:58:23	alyptik	i am mostly trying to avoid what happened with your USE flag snafu thing
2016-10-25 11:58:27	alyptik	the conky one
2016-10-25 11:58:42	minimalism	that was mostly a mistake with X
2016-10-25 11:58:53	minimalism	X should be set globally and banned as necessary on individual packages
2016-10-25 11:59:18	alyptik	oh that would be better than just enabling when needed?
2016-10-25 11:59:23	minimalism	it depends
2016-10-25 11:59:51	minimalism	some USE flags should be set globally, some should be on a case by case basis
2016-10-25 11:59:57	alyptik	ah i see
2016-10-25 11:59:58	minimalism	for example here are my globals
2016-10-25 12:00:25	minimalism	alsa bindist -bluetooth -cups -fortran -gnome -gnome-keyring -google -gtk3 -ipv6 -java -kde -pulseaudio -qt5 -syslog -systemd -vlc X zsh-completion
2016-10-25 12:00:36	minimalism	so I banned all the things I will never want
2016-10-25 12:00:40	minimalism	and if by some chance in hell I need one of those
2016-10-25 12:00:43	minimalism	I can just enable them for that specific package
2016-10-25 12:01:15	minimalism	X is only banned in a few things like conky
2016-10-25 12:01:25	minimalism	but enabled for everything else like I require
2016-10-25 12:02:09	minimalism	you could argue flags like jpeg gif png tiff svg could be set globally
2016-10-25 12:02:24	minimalism	but I think it varies from package to package since jpeg is mostly only for editing/viewing
2016-10-25 12:02:33	minimalism	rather than enabled for interfaces that really only use png and gif
2016-10-25 12:02:43	alyptik	syslog?
2016-10-25 12:02:43	minimalism	so I think image support should be enabled on a case by case
2016-10-25 12:02:52	minimalism	specific type of logger afaik
2016-10-25 12:03:11	minimalism	I don't think it's a general log support.. I think it's specifically for the syslog logger
2016-10-25 12:03:13	alyptik	i guess openrc uses klogd or something?
2016-10-25 12:03:20	minimalism	it uses whatever you want
2016-10-25 12:03:21	alyptik	ah ok
2016-10-25 12:03:29	minimalism	sysklogd is one a lot of people use though
2016-10-25 12:04:06	minimalism	I assume syslog means syslog-ng
2016-10-25 12:04:07	minimalism	 app-admin/syslog-ng
2016-10-25 12:04:13	alyptik	oh btw are you on lvm also?
2016-10-25 12:04:18	alyptik	or what rootfs if not
2016-10-25 12:04:37	minimalism	nah, never used lvm or anything like that
2016-10-25 12:04:41	minimalism	I use plain partitions
2016-10-25 12:04:44	alyptik	just straight ext4?
2016-10-25 12:04:49	minimalism	yeah
2016-10-25 12:04:58	minimalism	I might have to use lvm though if I want to encrypt
2016-10-25 12:05:08	minimalism	I don't feel ready for encryption yet though
2016-10-25 12:05:17	alyptik	you know i am not even 100% how to encrypt without lvm
2016-10-25 12:05:25	alyptik	never looked up if LUKS can be used without lvm
2016-10-25 12:05:26	minimalism	I don't know either
2016-10-25 12:05:31	minimalism	I don't think you can
2016-10-25 12:05:51	minimalism	it has to be one real partition with fake volumes inside it to do that rootcrypt thing
2016-10-25 12:06:13	alyptik	ah
2016-10-25 12:06:57	alyptik	been procrastinating registering my secure boot keys too
2016-10-25 12:07:02	alyptik	so much to break, so little time
2016-10-25 12:13:00		[12:07]
2016-10-25 12:14:59	alyptik	eh weird, my vim doesn't see zsh-completion as a valid uSE flag
2016-10-25 12:16:19	alyptik	works fine in emerge though 
2016-10-25 12:16:43	minimalism	zsh-completion doesn't appear to be a USE flag on my vim either
2016-10-25 12:16:49	minimalism	it may only be available in a newer version
2016-10-25 12:17:09	alyptik	yeah probably a recent thing
2016-10-25 12:23:00		[12:17]
2016-10-25 12:28:14	minimalism	I don't know how SNL isn't cancelled
2016-10-25 12:28:22	minimalism	keep hearing about their bs election gags
2016-10-25 12:28:28	minimalism	it's so lazy, and they're all terrible comedians
2016-10-25 12:28:55	alyptik	i don't know either
2016-10-25 12:29:50	alyptik	i haven't bothered to watch the election ones
2016-10-25 12:30:02	alyptik	well i haven't bothered with any SNL in years tbh lol
2016-10-25 12:30:25	minimalism	Most sane people haven't, but I keep seeing it mentioned on the internet
2016-10-25 12:30:47	minimalism	all they do is do a poor imitation of Trump
2016-10-25 12:31:01	alyptik	lol
2016-10-25 12:31:04	minimalism	while Kate Mcwhatever plays herself.. a bitch .. hillary
2016-10-25 12:31:30	minimalism	and apparently that kid from Good Burger still exists
2016-10-25 12:31:55	alyptik	is that the keenan & kel kids
2016-10-25 12:32:07	minimalism	yeah that one, keenan
2016-10-25 12:32:09	alyptik	hah
2016-10-25 12:32:26	alyptik	fuck i think i was like 14 when that skit came out
2016-10-25 12:32:40	minimalism	everyone's pretending to laugh because SNL is liberal and from NY
2016-10-25 12:38:00		[12:32]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[00:53:39] makes more sense than anything ever, ever. [00:53:39]
2016-10-25 13:49:48		[13:49]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[00:55:50] I personally prefer MM-DD-YYYY, but if the world had to agree on one format [00:55:50]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[00:56:04] I could do with YYYY-MM-DD [00:56:04]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[01:09:34] heh [01:09:34]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[01:09:40] Do you have an SBC? Like a pi or beaglebone? [01:09:40]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[01:13:59] I've just been thinking about it because I want to install Alpine on something .. do something cool with it [01:13:59]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[01:16:28] I was thinking about trying Alpine as a desktop on my second drive, but [01:16:28]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[01:16:39] it'd be cool to have a dedicated machine for Alpine.. for whatever I'd use it for [01:16:39]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[01:17:25] I wish beaglebone would get its shit together [01:17:25]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[01:17:27] and release a new model [01:17:27]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[01:20:36] think it'd be cool since Alpine is mostly made for both amd64 and ARM [01:20:36]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[01:20:50] it's already trim as can be, so no debian grievances [01:20:50]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[01:21:51] debian is the worst thing in computing [01:21:51]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	minimalism	[21:56:45] it means apply X USE flag to pango for versions equal to or greater than 1.40.3 [21:56:45]

2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:03:11] I don't think it's a general log support.. I think it's specifically for the syslog logger [22:03:11]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:03:20] it uses whatever you want [22:03:20]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:03:29] sysklogd is one a lot of people use though [22:03:29]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:04:06] I assume syslog means syslog-ng [22:04:06]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:04:07]  app-admin/syslog-ng [22:04:07]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:04:37] nah, never used lvm or anything like that [22:04:37]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:04:41] I use plain partitions [22:04:41]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:04:49] yeah [22:04:49]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:04:58] I might have to use lvm though if I want to encrypt [22:04:58]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:05:08] I don't feel ready for encryption yet though [22:05:08]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:05:26] I don't know either [22:05:26]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:05:31] I don't think you can [22:05:31]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:05:51] it has to be one real partition with fake volumes inside it to do that rootcrypt thing [22:05:51]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:16:43] zsh-completion doesn't appear to be a USE flag on my vim either [22:16:43]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:16:49] it may only be available in a newer version [22:16:49]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:28:14] I don't know how SNL isn't cancelled [22:28:14]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:28:22] keep hearing about their bs election gags [22:28:22]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:28:28] it's so lazy, and they're all terrible comedians [22:28:28]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:30:25] Most sane people haven't, but I keep seeing it mentioned on the internet [22:30:25]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:30:47] all they do is do a poor imitation of Trump [22:30:47]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:31:04] while Kate Mcwhatever plays herself.. a bitch .. hillary [22:31:04]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:31:30] and apparently that kid from Good Burger still exists [22:31:30]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:32:07] yeah that one, keenan [22:32:07]
2016-10-25 15:33:51	minimalism	[22:32:40] everyone's pretending to laugh because SNL is liberal and from NY [22:32:40]
2016-10-25 16:58:23	minimalism	What exactly are ctags? Haven't looked into them myself yet
2016-10-25 16:58:23		[16:58]
2016-10-25 16:59:15	alyptik	if you are editing like a c/cpp file you can view the function definition when you see the function in the code
2016-10-25 16:59:45	alyptik	think they work for all languages, but i know c/cpp for sure
2016-10-25 16:59:54	minimalism	not sure I follow
2016-10-25 17:00:16	alyptik	so like void foo() { printf "derp"; }
2016-10-25 17:00:26	alyptik	when you are editing a file and you see foo();
2016-10-25 17:00:40	alyptik	you can see what is foo() exactly 
2016-10-25 17:00:46	minimalism	How?
2016-10-25 17:00:50	alyptik	without having to go search yourself
2016-10-25 17:01:02	alyptik	you have to tag it in a ctags file
2016-10-25 17:01:14	alyptik	there are vim plugs that do it automatically i think
2016-10-25 17:01:39	alyptik	not sure on specifics, haven't used it myself either
2016-10-25 17:01:44	alyptik	but that is the general concept
2016-10-25 17:01:45	minimalism	I must be thinking of something different because for some reason I'm thinking of ctags as having to do with rc/init
2016-10-25 17:01:57	alyptik	it can be any language with functions i think
2016-10-25 17:02:05	minimalism	wait I think I'm thinking of cgroups
2016-10-25 17:02:09	alyptik	lol
2016-10-25 17:02:23	alyptik	yeah that is a completly diff thing
2016-10-25 17:03:02	alyptik	cgroups from what i understand are a way to specify how much system resources a pid is allowed to use
2016-10-25 17:03:18	alyptik	setting that up is on my todo list
2016-10-25 17:09:00		[17:03]
2016-10-25 17:10:57	minimalism	my to do list I look forward to completing with gentoo
2016-10-25 17:11:16	minimalism	I want to move onto using alpine to set up servers and learn more about network admin type stuff
2016-10-25 17:11:27	minimalism	and learn some C finally
2016-10-25 17:13:32	alyptik	i want to learn cpp eventually
2016-10-25 17:13:37	minimalism	I'm learning so many different things simultaneously that it will be a while for it all to culminate into something great
2016-10-25 17:13:53	minimalism	but I already have quite a varied set of skills that aren't usually paired together
2016-10-25 17:14:20	minimalism	if I ever do some app with commercial intent.. I won't need designers, sysadmins, or front end people
2016-10-25 17:14:31	minimalism	just one of my friends in programming
2016-10-25 17:14:35	alyptik	lol
2016-10-25 17:14:37	minimalism	fuck dealing with designers
2016-10-25 17:16:28	minimalism	designin, front endin, administratin, kind of programmin ...
2016-10-25 17:17:40	alyptik	i would never be able to do the  logo design 
2016-10-25 17:17:45	alyptik	i am horrible at anything art
2016-10-25 17:17:56	minimalism	it's not so much drawing or art
2016-10-25 17:18:17	minimalism	it's skilled manipulation of expensive licensed proprietary fonts and some geometry/choice of colors
2016-10-25 17:18:24	minimalism	that's really 100% of it
2016-10-25 17:18:31	alyptik	hah
2016-10-25 17:18:33	minimalism	most logos that go beyond that end up too complex and look bad
2016-10-25 17:18:33	alyptik	very true
2016-10-25 17:19:05	minimalism	I designed a logo for a small company whose entire prospect is branding lol
2016-10-25 17:19:50	minimalism	not something I could do every day though.. too much dwelling
2016-10-25 17:20:01	minimalism	that's why you see logo designers charging fortune 500 companies like 50k per job
2016-10-25 17:26:00		[17:20]
2016-10-25 17:34:36	alyptik	hm
2016-10-25 17:34:41	alyptik	how detailed do i need to make /etc/conf.d/modules
2016-10-25 17:34:51	minimalism	haven't looked into it yet
2016-10-25 17:34:58	alyptik	do i need to figure out exactly what i need or can i just shove all the modules in there
2016-10-25 17:35:05	alyptik	you didnt touch it at all?
2016-10-25 17:35:08	minimalism	not yet, no
2016-10-25 17:35:16	minimalism	I only have my module conf from arch which was blacklisting
2016-10-25 17:35:22	alyptik	i will just do that then till i figure out whats what
2016-10-25 17:35:43	minimalism	I'm working on a full evaluation of USE flags for everything right now, and also
2016-10-25 17:35:44	alyptik	my other install i just shoved everything from /lib/modules in there hah
2016-10-25 17:35:50	minimalism	working on the savedconfig for linux-firmware
2016-10-25 17:37:16	minimalism	arch really handed this stuff to us
2016-10-25 17:37:22	minimalism	systemd services, no real scripting
2016-10-25 17:37:26	minimalism	journalctl
2016-10-25 17:37:35	minimalism	no setting up logging or cron
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:41:11] truthfully, a lot of those claims that you'll break something by editing manually are false [03:41:11]
2016-10-25 17:57:05		[17:57]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:41:31] like they say don't edit /etc/passwd,group,shadow,gshadow [03:41:31]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:41:36] you totally can, and I regularly do [03:41:36]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:41:52] you just need to know what permission settings they all need to have [03:41:52]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:42:21] that's usually the main concern [03:42:21]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:42:26] knowing who is supposed to own the files/dirs [03:42:26]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:42:30] and what permission setting [03:42:30]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:43:53] I heard cronie and chrony so highly recommended for cron jobs and time sync, but who knows [03:43:53]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:44:02] sysklogd is also recommended for beginners in the handbook [03:44:02]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:44:50] I have it installed and I think it's set via eselect, but [03:44:50]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:44:55] I never actually configured it in any way [03:44:55]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:45:08] You up for doing some co-op on gentoo config this week? [03:45:08]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:45:14] It's easier to actually get it done when two minds are on it [03:45:14]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:45:33] alright, what are you choosing for logging, cron, initramfs [03:45:33]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:45:53] I'm planning unless I have reason otherwise.. to use sysklogd, cronie+chrony, dracut [03:45:53]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:46:00] initrd, initramfs, you know [03:46:00]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:46:08] oh [03:46:08]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:46:14] like software to create it [03:46:14]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:46:20] like arch has its own mkinitcpio [03:46:20]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:46:23] we don't have that on gentoo [03:46:23]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:46:26] lol fuck genkernel [03:46:26]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:46:30] it doesn't include the necessary stuff [03:46:30]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:46:43] we need to learn dracut or learn to do it manually.. I was actually telling NextHendrix [03:46:43]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:46:59] it may be easier to write a file full of files/paths with wildcards [03:46:59]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:47:04] to make it future proof in case of version changes [03:47:04]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:47:17] and write a script that does an rsync of those files to a dir like [03:47:17]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:47:23] $HOME/Build/initramfs/ [03:47:23]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:47:36] where it syncs the files, and it automatically builds into a compressed initramfs image [03:47:36]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:47:41] that is automoved to /boot [03:47:41]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:47:54] it's just a collection of files used to get a headstart during boot [03:47:54]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:48:01] to provide some functionality before the system is really going [03:48:01]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:48:23] like /boot partition is all that's accessible at first for example [03:48:23]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:48:26] before it reaches root [03:48:26]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:48:36] especially if root is encrypted, you know [03:48:36]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:48:55] I'm not entirely clear on it, but I think I get the gist [03:48:55]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:49:08] it's just a binary that launches shit during startup to get the system going, fin. [03:49:08]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:50:03] init [03:50:03]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:50:41] I think init is pid 1 everywhere [03:50:41]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:51:00] systemd is just a really fucking lame system that hides too much [03:51:00]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:51:02] and logs in binary [03:51:02]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:51:23]  /sbin/init [03:51:23]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:51:25] that file [03:51:25]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:51:54] did you notice that package on arch [03:51:54]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:51:57] it's like called [03:51:57]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:52:02] systemd-sysvinitcompat or something [03:52:02]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:52:14] like on gentoo you definitely have sysvinit installed [03:52:14]
2016-10-25 17:57:05	minimalism	[03:52:28] check this out.. this is what's returned by e-file for ownership of /sbin/init [03:52:28]

2016-10-25 17:57:06	minimalism	[03:53:25] in my case with openrc, sysvinit provides it [03:53:25]
2016-10-25 17:57:06	minimalism	[03:55:06] there's another interesting thing about gentoo [03:55:06]
2016-10-25 17:57:06	minimalism	[03:55:21] and most likely why they never really officially called it "Gentoo Linux" in the /etc/os-release file [03:55:21]
2016-10-25 17:57:06	minimalism	[03:55:36] it's just "Gentoo" unlike "Arch Linux" [03:55:36]
2016-10-25 17:57:06	minimalism	[03:55:48] you can do Gentoo/FreeBSD instead of Gentoo/Linux [03:55:48]
2016-10-25 17:57:06	minimalism	[03:56:01] see that sys-freebsd/freebsd-sbin above [03:56:01]
2016-10-25 17:58:05	alyptik	there we go back in
2016-10-25 17:58:13	alyptik	that is kinda neat
2016-10-25 18:01:09	alyptik	what other logging options are there
2016-10-25 18:02:09	minimalism	well the handbook mentions
2016-10-25 18:02:19	minimalism	sysklogd, syslog-ng, metalog
2016-10-25 18:02:27	minimalism	and you can optionally choose whether to install logrotate
2016-10-25 18:02:30	minimalism	which we use on arch
2016-10-25 18:03:24	alyptik	never heard of metalog
2016-10-25 18:04:28	alyptik	prob will just stick with sysklogd
2016-10-25 18:07:22	minimalism	yeah, I would
2016-10-25 18:07:28	minimalism	sysklogd+logrotate should be simple enough
2016-10-25 18:07:38	minimalism	I think you can set all the logging levels for various types of logs
2016-10-25 18:07:42	minimalism	even set path/filename for the logs
2016-10-25 18:09:20	minimalism	https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Security_Handbook/Logging
2016-10-25 18:13:38	minimalism	hm
2016-10-25 18:13:38		[18:13]
2016-10-25 18:13:49	minimalism	appears syslog use flag probably does go with sysklogd
2016-10-25 18:13:55	minimalism	 /etc/syslog.conf belongs to sysklogd
2016-10-25 18:15:59	alyptik	oh looks like zswap isn't freezing me
2016-10-25 18:16:11	alyptik	lz4 compression is just really fucking slow
2016-10-25 18:16:39	minimalism	very relevant article
2016-10-25 18:16:41	minimalism	http://www.tecmint.com/systemd-replaces-init-in-linux/
2016-10-25 18:17:49	minimalism	as I thought/recall
2016-10-25 18:17:52	minimalism	systemd is pid 1 on arch
2016-10-25 18:17:56	minimalism	I think init was pid 3
2016-10-25 18:18:20	alyptik	oh this article is really good
2016-10-25 18:19:32	alyptik	a bit biased
2016-10-25 18:19:35	alyptik	but good info
2016-10-25 18:21:39	minimalism	ignore the bias, just has a history and basic facts of use
2016-10-25 18:27:00		[18:21]
2016-10-25 18:33:10	minimalism	just looked at my ctags in eselect after reading news
2016-10-25 18:33:16	minimalism	are you using exuberant-ctags?
2016-10-25 18:33:49	alyptik	i am compiling kernel atm
2016-10-25 18:33:57	alyptik	was planning on installing though yeah
2016-10-25 18:34:06	minimalism	apparently the minimal USE flag on vim
2016-10-25 18:34:12	minimalism	is what triggers ctags from being installed or not
2016-10-25 18:34:19	alyptik	oo
2016-10-25 18:34:39	minimalism	that would remove/disable plugins, fonts, drivers, etc. though
2016-10-25 18:34:48	minimalism	so things are good then, ctags can stay
2016-10-25 18:35:13	minimalism	I've been linking this article to people
2016-10-25 18:35:15	minimalism	https://timboudreau.com/blog/gentoo/read
2016-10-25 18:35:31	minimalism	especially a friend who works as a software engineer who's forced to use OSX
2016-10-25 18:37:59	alyptik	will read when chromium loads it hah
2016-10-25 18:38:08	alyptik	it is trying to open 25 t atmabs 
2016-10-25 18:38:15	alyptik	25 tabs atm*
2016-10-25 18:40:18	alyptik	oh no wonder it is so slow
2016-10-25 18:40:23	alyptik	76 tabs* hah
2016-10-25 18:46:00		[18:40]
2016-10-25 20:34:53	minimalism	got a neat little thing going with USE flags now
2016-10-25 20:34:53		[20:34]
2016-10-25 20:35:17	minimalism	got a good set of globals and this tiny 3 liner of shell to go through a list of packages
2016-10-25 20:35:32	minimalism	and grep a specific USE flag to check + or - to see if it's consistent across the board
2016-10-25 20:35:50	alyptik	oh that is cool
2016-10-25 20:35:58	alyptik	like a shell func?
2016-10-25 20:41:00		[20:35]
2016-10-25 20:45:26	minimalism	oh I just discovered a better line
2016-10-25 20:46:54	minimalism	equery uses $(equery hasuse $1) | grep $1
2016-10-25 20:47:00	minimalism	as a func
2016-10-25 20:47:04	minimalism	since shell won't read $1
2016-10-25 20:47:27	minimalism	so if you do that with ssl as $1
2016-10-25 20:47:33	alyptik	added to my aliases 
2016-10-25 20:47:38	minimalism	it's more to check consistency
2016-10-25 20:47:52	minimalism	like if it's something you should take note of where packages all have it banned or enabled
2016-10-25 20:48:01	minimalism	like ssl for example is clear
2016-10-25 20:48:05	minimalism	they all have it enabled across the board
2016-10-25 20:48:08	minimalism	no action necessary
2016-10-25 20:48:46	alyptik	should i quote the $()
2016-10-25 20:48:56	alyptik	does splitting affect how equery reads it?
2016-10-25 20:50:51	minimalism	I think it has to be contained
2016-10-25 20:51:06	minimalism	that's to isolate it or whatever.. I don't know the terms
2016-10-25 20:51:16	minimalism	I just learn a thing or two about shell scripting and it comes together
2016-10-25 20:51:33	alyptik	ah
2016-10-25 20:51:36	alyptik	hm i wonder
2016-10-25 20:52:03	alyptik	ah no can't make it into an alias with parallel
2016-10-25 20:52:09	alyptik	the pipe heh
2016-10-25 20:52:59	minimalism	it's not the pipe, it's the.. what do you call that
2016-10-25 20:53:02	minimalism	the $1 var
2016-10-25 20:53:19	alyptik	well i was thinking parallel ::: equery grep ::: 
2016-10-25 20:53:30	alyptik	but doesnt work with the pipe 
2016-10-25 20:53:59	alyptik	was just trying to see if i can make it an alias for fun heh
2016-10-25 20:58:19	minimalism	just wrote these in
2016-10-25 20:58:19		[20:58]
2016-10-25 20:58:21	minimalism	emergelog() { tail -n "$1" "/var/log/emerge.log" | less; }
2016-10-25 20:58:23	minimalism	equery-use-consistency() { equery uses $(equery hasuse "$1") | grep "$1"; }
2016-10-25 21:04:00		[20:58]
2016-10-25 21:15:53	minimalism	another useful thing to ban in USE is accessibility
2016-10-25 21:21:00		[21:15]
2016-10-25 21:23:26	alyptik	what does that entail
2016-10-25 21:23:30	alyptik	like screen reader shit?
2016-10-25 21:27:19	minimalism	basically for blind, deaf, etc.
2016-10-25 21:27:43	alyptik	yeah -accessibility it is
2016-10-25 21:28:05	minimalism	the fuck
2016-10-25 21:28:11	minimalism	SELinux is enabled in my kernel config now
2016-10-25 21:28:18	alyptik	lol
2016-10-25 21:33:44	minimalism	Oh you got tox working right?
2016-10-25 21:39:00		[21:33]
2016-10-25 21:42:23	alyptik	i did yup
2016-10-25 21:48:00		[21:42]
2016-10-25 21:48:52	minimalism	this Dragon Box rip is fucking amzing
2016-10-25 21:48:54	minimalism	amazing*
2016-10-25 21:49:27	alyptik	dragon box?
2016-10-25 21:49:41	minimalism	it's the ultimate release from over a decade ago for Dragon Ball
2016-10-25 21:49:48	alyptik	oh shit
2016-10-25 21:50:03	minimalism	no one's ever put out the real original source on the internet
2016-10-25 21:50:14	minimalism	the DVD set for Dragon Ball alone was 100,000 JPY
2016-10-25 21:50:18	alyptik	OG dragon ball was the shit
2016-10-25 21:50:26	minimalism	Dragon Ball Z I think may have been 150K or more
2016-10-25 21:50:31	minimalism	possibly 200
2016-10-25 21:50:38	alyptik	damn
2016-10-25 21:50:38	minimalism	this is like 1000-2000 USD per box set
2016-10-25 21:50:43	minimalism	so no one was really ripping these things
2016-10-25 21:51:11	minimalism	worse yet, they won't ever be released again, and the US video source is completely different
2016-10-25 21:51:13	minimalism	audio too
2016-10-25 21:51:27	minimalism	it's missing the original OP/ED versions, audio is bad, the video colors are off
2016-10-25 21:51:32	minimalism	they did a poor job attempting to clean it
2016-10-25 21:51:38	minimalism	"remaster"
2016-10-25 21:51:52	minimalism	Dragon Ball basically has Star Wars theatrical tier status with the 2004 Dragon Box from Japan
2016-10-25 21:52:13	alyptik	remastering is hard to do well
2016-10-25 21:52:25	minimalism	right, it's not something you should do either for the most part
2016-10-25 21:52:29	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-25 21:52:30	minimalism	they didn't even have the real video source
2016-10-25 21:52:51	minimalism	you don't let some scrub studio handle the most valuable negative in all of animation
2016-10-25 21:53:12	minimalism	so this guy started ripping the DVDs in full quality, so the files are like 1 GiB each
2016-10-25 21:53:23	minimalism	the original grain and color are there
2016-10-25 21:53:26	alyptik	haha that is sick
2016-10-25 21:53:31	minimalism	there's no fucked up rip with black bordering on one side either
2016-10-25 21:53:40	minimalism	and the original mono audio is so soft and perfect
2016-10-25 21:53:48	minimalism	unlike the scratchy version released here
2016-10-25 21:54:10	minimalism	no one's ever posted this original source in this condition, and better yet
2016-10-25 21:54:19	alyptik	torrent?
2016-10-25 21:54:21	minimalism	he muxed it with the official translation subtitles perfectly timed to the video
2016-10-25 21:54:33	minimalism	normally they don't sync right
2016-10-25 21:54:55	minimalism	https://www.nyaa.se/?user=329876
2016-10-25 21:55:01	minimalism	he's only got up to General Blue posted so far
2016-10-25 21:55:21	alyptik	\o/
2016-10-25 21:55:24	alyptik	"Found Gentoo Base System release 2.2 on /dev/mapper/sp3-gentoo"
2016-10-25 21:55:42	alyptik	now to finish up and see if it runs
2016-10-25 21:55:54	alyptik	oh sweet
2016-10-25 21:55:57	alyptik	bookmarking for later
2016-10-25 21:57:32	minimalism	https://imgur.com/a/Paudf
2016-10-25 21:57:34	minimalism	check it out
2016-10-25 21:57:41	minimalism	the authentic grain you see only on the real original video source
2016-10-25 21:57:53	minimalism	I'm so pissed off they took it out of Star Wars
2016-10-25 21:57:57	minimalism	it just changes everything
2016-10-25 22:01:32	alyptik	wow 
2016-10-25 22:01:52	alyptik	shit last time i saw dragonball i was like 16 hah
2016-10-25 22:02:06	alyptik	gonna try rebooting, won't respond for a bit
2016-10-25 22:08:00		[22:02]

2016-10-26 09:43:44	minimalism	[07:52:51] you don't let some scrub studio handle the most valuable negative in all of animation [07:52:51]
2016-10-26 09:43:44	minimalism	[07:53:12] so this guy started ripping the DVDs in full quality, so the files are like 1 GiB each [07:53:12]
2016-10-26 09:43:44	minimalism	[07:53:23] the original grain and color are there [07:53:23]
2016-10-26 09:43:44	minimalism	[07:53:31] there's no fucked up rip with black bordering on one side either [07:53:31]
2016-10-26 09:43:44	minimalism	[07:53:40] and the original mono audio is so soft and perfect [07:53:40]
2016-10-26 09:43:44	minimalism	[07:53:48] unlike the scratchy version released here [07:53:48]
2016-10-26 09:43:44	minimalism	[07:54:10] no one's ever posted this original source in this condition, and better yet [07:54:10]
2016-10-26 09:43:44	minimalism	[07:54:21] he muxed it with the official translation subtitles perfectly timed to the video [07:54:21]
2016-10-26 09:43:44	minimalism	[07:54:33] normally they don't sync right [07:54:33]
2016-10-26 09:43:44	minimalism	[07:54:55] https://www.nyaa.se/?user=329876 [07:54:55]
2016-10-26 09:43:44	minimalism	[07:55:01] he's only got up to General Blue posted so far [07:55:01]
2016-10-26 09:43:44	minimalism	[07:57:32] https://imgur.com/a/Paudf [07:57:32]
2016-10-26 09:43:44	minimalism	[07:57:34] check it out [07:57:34]
2016-10-26 09:43:44	minimalism	[07:57:41] the authentic grain you see only on the real original video source [07:57:41]
2016-10-26 09:43:44	minimalism	[07:57:53] I'm so pissed off they took it out of Star Wars [07:57:53]
2016-10-26 09:43:44	minimalism	[07:57:57] it just changes everything [07:57:57]
2016-10-26 09:43:44	minimalism	[08:10:49] trying to remember what I did with the kernel and efibootmgr [08:10:49]
2016-10-26 09:44:14	--	minimalism: No such server
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[04:35:31] especially a friend who works as a software engineer who's forced to use OSX [04:35:31]
2016-10-26 12:54:20		[12:54]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:34:53] got a neat little thing going with USE flags now [06:34:53]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:35:17] got a good set of globals and this tiny 3 liner of shell to go through a list of packages [06:35:17]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:35:32] and grep a specific USE flag to check + or - to see if it's consistent across the board [06:35:32]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:45:26] oh I just discovered a better line [06:45:26]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:46:54] equery uses $(equery hasuse $1) | grep $1 [06:46:54]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:47:00] as a func [06:47:00]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:47:04] since shell won't read $1 [06:47:04]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:47:27] so if you do that with ssl as $1 [06:47:27]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:47:38] it's more to check consistency [06:47:38]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:47:52] like if it's something you should take note of where packages all have it banned or enabled [06:47:52]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:48:01] like ssl for example is clear [06:48:01]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:48:05] they all have it enabled across the board [06:48:05]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:48:08] no action necessary [06:48:08]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:50:51] I think it has to be contained [06:50:51]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:51:06] that's to isolate it or whatever.. I don't know the terms [06:51:06]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:51:15] I just learn a thing or two about shell scripting and it comes together [06:51:15]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:52:59] it's not the pipe, it's the.. what do you call that [06:52:59]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:53:02] the $1 var [06:53:02]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:58:19] just wrote these in [06:58:19]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:58:21] emergelog() { tail -n "$1" "/var/log/emerge.log" | less; } [06:58:21]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[06:58:23] equery-use-consistency() { equery uses $(equery hasuse "$1") | grep "$1"; } [06:58:23]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[07:15:53] another useful thing to ban in USE is accessibility [07:15:53]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[07:27:19] basically for blind, deaf, etc. [07:27:19]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[07:28:05] the fuck [07:28:05]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[07:28:11] SELinux is enabled in my kernel config now [07:28:11]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[07:33:44] Oh you got tox working right? [07:33:44]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[07:48:52] this Dragon Box rip is fucking amzing [07:48:52]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[07:48:54] amazing* [07:48:54]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	minimalism	[07:49:41] it's the ultimate release from over a decade ago for Dragon Ball [07:49:41]
2016-10-26 12:54:21	minimalism	[07:50:03] no one's ever put out the real original source on the internet [07:50:03]
2016-10-26 12:54:21	minimalism	[07:50:14] the DVD set for Dragon Ball alone was 100,000 JPY [07:50:14]
2016-10-26 12:54:21	minimalism	[07:50:26] Dragon Ball Z I think may have been 150K or more [07:50:26]
2016-10-26 12:54:21	minimalism	[07:50:31] possibly 200 [07:50:31]
2016-10-26 12:54:21	minimalism	[07:50:38] this is like 1000-2000 USD per box set [07:50:38]
2016-10-26 12:54:21	minimalism	[07:50:43] so no one was really ripping these things [07:50:43]
2016-10-26 12:54:21	minimalism	[07:51:11] worse yet, they won't ever be released again, and the US video source is completely different [07:51:11]
2016-10-26 12:54:21	minimalism	[07:51:13] audio too [07:51:13]
2016-10-26 12:54:21	minimalism	[07:51:27] it's missing the original OP/ED versions, audio is bad, the video colors are off [07:51:27]
2016-10-26 12:54:21	minimalism	[07:51:32] they did a poor job attempting to clean it [07:51:32]
2016-10-26 12:54:21	minimalism	[07:51:38] "remaster" [07:51:38]
2016-10-26 12:54:21	minimalism	[07:51:52] Dragon Ball basically has Star Wars theatrical tier status with the 2004 Dragon Box from Japan [07:51:52]
2016-10-26 12:54:21	minimalism	[07:52:25] right, it's not something you should do either for the most part [07:52:25]
2016-10-26 12:54:21	minimalism	[07:52:30] they didn't even have the real video source [07:52:30]

2016-10-26 13:10:26		[13:10]
2016-10-26 13:10:44	alyptik	breh
2016-10-26 13:11:03	minimalism	I forgot to ask, but want to exchange tox IDs?
2016-10-26 13:11:15	minimalism	I've got 2 others from freenode on there
2016-10-26 13:11:23	alyptik	sure it feel pointless with no contacts
2016-10-26 13:11:24	alyptik	rofl
2016-10-26 13:11:31	minimalism	alright, paste your id on cryptobin
2016-10-26 13:11:40	minimalism	set it to burn after like 10 minutes
2016-10-26 13:11:51	minimalism	you should try to avoid linking it anywhere/pasting
2016-10-26 13:11:55	alyptik	so how do i do this exactly
2016-10-26 13:12:01	minimalism	to prevent the association of an identity with the id
2016-10-26 13:12:07	minimalism	go into the toxic client
2016-10-26 13:12:09	minimalism	type /myid
2016-10-26 13:12:17	alyptik	ah there we go
2016-10-26 13:12:19	minimalism	it'll give you the id+antispam string all in one
2016-10-26 13:12:25	minimalism	then paste it on cryptobin.co
2016-10-26 13:13:11	alyptik	alright
2016-10-26 13:13:20	alyptik	for the password how do i get that to you?
2016-10-26 13:13:27	minimalism	just write the password in here
2016-10-26 13:13:33	minimalism	the bin will expire in like 10 minutes, so
2016-10-26 13:13:34	alyptik	alright i'll just use minimalism 
2016-10-26 13:13:38	minimalism	it'll be pointless if anyone is reading
2016-10-26 13:14:03	alyptik	so paste the string?
2016-10-26 13:14:06	alyptik	the hashed one?
2016-10-26 13:14:39	minimalism	the URI it provides
2016-10-26 13:14:46	minimalism	to cryptobin
2016-10-26 13:14:56	minimalism	I couldn't unhash that 
2016-10-26 13:14:58	alyptik	https://cryptobin.co/78v2r6b3
2016-10-26 13:16:51	minimalism	If you haven't already
2016-10-26 13:16:55	minimalism	you can set display name with /nick
2016-10-26 13:16:59	alyptik	ah
2016-10-26 13:17:01	minimalism	and set status with /note ""
2016-10-26 13:17:17	minimalism	it's basically skype but not fucking terrible
2016-10-26 13:17:38	alyptik	lol
2016-10-26 13:17:40	minimalism	and it doesn't support video calls in this client yet, which some people think is an issue, but I like
2016-10-26 13:17:43	minimalism	it supports only audio atm
2016-10-26 13:18:19	alyptik	well i am more of a chat person anyway
2016-10-26 13:18:25	alyptik	i am listeing to music 99% of the time
2016-10-26 13:19:02	minimalism	indeed
2016-10-26 13:19:09	minimalism	the rare times I want to make a call though
2016-10-26 13:19:12	minimalism	it's gonna be audio
2016-10-26 13:19:31	minimalism	I just want it having audio because that's a needed feature to convert normals to using tox
2016-10-26 13:19:54	minimalism	they aren't using tox now, but one of these days they might get spooked by something the government does
2016-10-26 13:19:57	minimalism	and then.. well hopefully
2016-10-26 13:20:23	alyptik	how do i actually add you
2016-10-26 13:20:24	alyptik	lol
2016-10-26 13:22:43	alyptik	dammit
2016-10-26 13:22:46	alyptik	avatar is too big
2016-10-26 13:23:15	minimalism	avatar?
2016-10-26 13:23:24	minimalism	oh, file size
2016-10-26 13:23:34	minimalism	I believe it restricts to something like 100 KiB
2016-10-26 13:23:46	minimalism	we can't view avatars in toxic, it's solely for the benefit of people using the graphical clients
2016-10-26 13:23:50	minimalism	and for them to recognize us
2016-10-26 13:24:01	minimalism	I have one set, but yeah
2016-10-26 13:24:19	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-26 13:24:24	alyptik	i guess i have to just edit in gimp
2016-10-26 13:24:26	minimalism	I honestly can't remember how to actually add, but it may be in contacts tab or main tab
2016-10-26 13:24:48	alyptik	no pending reqq
2016-10-26 13:24:50	alyptik	it says
2016-10-26 13:24:55	minimalism	well I sent one to that ID
2016-10-26 13:24:58	minimalism	and it was validated
2016-10-26 13:27:36	alyptik	yeah i dont see you in contacts

2016-10-27 17:07:29	minimalism	[23:10:26] bruh [23:10:26]
2016-10-27 17:07:29	minimalism	[23:11:03] I forgot to ask, but want to exchange tox IDs? [23:11:03]
2016-10-27 17:07:29	minimalism	[23:11:15] I've got 2 others from freenode on there [23:11:15]
2016-10-27 17:07:29	minimalism	[23:11:31] alright, paste your id on cryptobin [23:11:31]
2016-10-27 17:07:29	minimalism	[23:11:40] set it to burn after like 10 minutes [23:11:40]
2016-10-27 17:07:29	minimalism	[23:11:51] you should try to avoid linking it anywhere/pasting [23:11:51]
2016-10-27 17:07:29	minimalism	[23:12:01] to prevent the association of an identity with the id [23:12:01]
2016-10-27 17:07:29	minimalism	[23:12:07] go into the toxic client [23:12:07]
2016-10-27 17:07:29	minimalism	[23:12:09] type /myid [23:12:09]
2016-10-27 17:07:29	minimalism	[23:12:19] it'll give you the id+antispam string all in one [23:12:19]
2016-10-27 17:07:29	minimalism	[23:12:25] then paste it on cryptobin.co [23:12:25]
2016-10-27 17:07:29	minimalism	[23:13:27] just write the password in here [23:13:27]
2016-10-27 17:07:29	minimalism	[23:13:33] the bin will expire in like 10 minutes, so [23:13:33]
2016-10-27 17:07:29	minimalism	[23:13:38] it'll be pointless if anyone is reading [23:13:38]
2016-10-27 17:07:29	minimalism	[23:14:39] the URI it provides [23:14:39]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:14:46] to cryptobin [23:14:46]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:14:56] I couldn't unhash that  [23:14:56]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:16:50] If you haven't already [23:16:50]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:16:55] you can set display name with /nick [23:16:55]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:17:01] and set status with /note "" [23:17:01]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:17:17] it's basically skype but not fucking terrible [23:17:17]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:17:40] and it doesn't support video calls in this client yet, which some people think is an issue, but I like [23:17:40]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:17:43] it supports only audio atm [23:17:43]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:19:02] indeed [23:19:02]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:19:09] the rare times I want to make a call though [23:19:09]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:19:11] it's gonna be audio [23:19:11]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:19:31] I just want it having audio because that's a needed feature to convert normals to using tox [23:19:31]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:19:54] they aren't using tox now, but one of these days they might get spooked by something the government does [23:19:54]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:19:57] and then.. well hopefully [23:19:57]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:23:15] avatar? [23:23:15]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:23:24] oh, file size [23:23:24]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:23:34] I believe it restricts to something like 100 KiB [23:23:34]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:23:46] we can't view avatars in toxic, it's solely for the benefit of people using the graphical clients [23:23:46]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:23:50] and for them to recognize us [23:23:50]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:24:01] I have one set, but yeah [23:24:01]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:24:26] I honestly can't remember how to actually add, but it may be in contacts tab or main tab [23:24:26]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:24:55] well I sent one to that ID [23:24:55]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:24:58] and it was validated [23:24:58]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:27:50] yeah doesn't appear to be added [23:27:50]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:27:53] resend your /myid [23:27:53]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:29:07] says already sent [23:29:07]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:29:13] are you using some different version of toxcore or something? [23:29:13]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:29:29] I honestly don't know then [23:29:29]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:29:48] what do you mean [23:29:48]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:29:51] you type toxic [23:29:51]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:29:54] and it logs you in [23:29:54]
2016-10-27 17:07:30	minimalism	[23:31:32] just deleted contact and resent request [23:31:32]
2016-10-27 17:08:02	--	minimalism: No such server
2016-10-27 18:58:42	alyptik	hey, readd another tox id
2016-10-27 18:58:42		[18:58]
2016-10-27 18:58:58	alyptik	switching to utox so i don't forgot about background terms hah
2016-10-27 18:59:32	alyptik	https://cryptobin.co/52a6y7q0
2016-10-27 18:59:33	alyptik	foo
2016-10-27 19:05:00		[18:59]
2016-10-27 19:05:11	minimalism	utox?
2016-10-27 19:05:17	minimalism	I heard qtox was the superior one but okay
2016-10-27 19:05:26	alyptik	oh lemme try that
2016-10-27 19:05:39	minimalism	I'm gonna AFK a while
2016-10-27 19:05:44	alyptik	kk
2016-10-27 19:05:44	minimalism	finished my USE flag revision earlier
2016-10-27 19:06:11	alyptik	i am dding my gentoo install anyway
2016-10-27 19:06:17	alyptik	dont feel like messing with lvm
2016-10-27 19:06:30	minimalism	yeah I'm not touching encryption yet
2016-10-27 19:06:36	minimalism	gentoo is enough of a hurdle
2016-10-27 19:06:40	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-27 19:06:44	minimalism	I'll leave disk encryption until I have this mastered first
2016-10-27 19:07:31	minimalism	I'll probably do a new install with just enough to actually set up encryption, and then use a foreign iso like archiso
2016-10-27 19:07:43	minimalism	to do an rsync against my current install to delete all files in the new install that don't exist in my backup
2016-10-27 19:08:15	minimalism	And if I encrypt.. I basically have to encrypt every backup I have too
2016-10-27 19:08:17	minimalism	it's a whole thing
2016-10-27 19:09:24	alyptik	ton of work for sure
2016-10-27 19:09:25	minimalism	fuggg
2016-10-27 19:09:30	minimalism	doing an emerge sync before going AFK
2016-10-27 19:09:33	minimalism	and 37 updates
2016-10-27 19:09:39	alyptik	well once luks is open you can snapshot 
2016-10-27 19:09:44	alyptik	for backups
2016-10-27 19:15:00		[19:09]
2016-10-27 20:39:05	minimalism	finally
2016-10-27 20:39:05		[20:39]
2016-10-27 20:39:11	minimalism	had to chill a bit and my headache went away
2016-10-27 20:39:48	alyptik	glad to hear
2016-10-27 20:40:09	minimalism	Getting close to completing gentoo now I think
2016-10-27 20:40:26	minimalism	still have to do logging, cron, and do some more on trimming linux-firmware
2016-10-27 20:40:57	minimalism	then I'll have to do my usual system hardening routing with file permissions, users, PAM, and all that
2016-10-27 20:41:01	alyptik	oh btw
2016-10-27 20:41:02	minimalism	routine*
2016-10-27 20:41:03	alyptik	https://cryptobin.co/n7x5g8n6
2016-10-27 20:41:04	alyptik	foo
2016-10-27 20:41:05	minimalism	and my iptables filters
2016-10-27 20:41:07	alyptik	qtox is way better
2016-10-27 20:41:25	minimalism	yeah, Hendrix said the same
2016-10-27 20:41:27	minimalism	he tried them all
2016-10-27 20:42:05	minimalism	it's pretty much perfectly packaged for normals
2016-10-27 20:42:09	minimalism	it's a shame people still use skype
2016-10-27 20:42:29	alyptik	there we go
2016-10-27 20:42:53	alyptik	i just dislike using ncurses things for typing where i dont have xterm shortcuts
2016-10-27 20:43:01	alyptik	xterm-style*
2016-10-27 20:43:12	minimalism	I still prefer ncurses basically always
2016-10-27 20:43:29	alyptik	also my left ctrl is far as fk
2016-10-27 20:43:33	alyptik	don't think i can keybind meta
2016-10-27 20:43:54	minimalism	found out today you can sync portage with basically any method you want
2016-10-27 20:44:04	minimalism	rsync is still the officially supported one really, but they offer more now
2016-10-27 20:44:10	minimalism	git is an option even for main repository
2016-10-27 20:44:32	minimalism	I'm using git sync for overlays because they actually are all git repositories, but it's sweet how customizable this is
2016-10-27 20:44:59	alyptik	oh wut
2016-10-27 20:45:01	alyptik	git hah
2016-10-27 20:45:12	minimalism	?
2016-10-27 20:45:30	alyptik	didn't know you could sync with git protocol
2016-10-27 20:45:50	minimalism	you can but it's not really that supported.. it depends on the repository
2016-10-27 20:45:55	alyptik	still cool
2016-10-27 20:46:04	minimalism	funtoo though 100% supports it
2016-10-27 20:46:06	minimalism	primarily
2016-10-27 20:46:12	minimalism	gentoo's official repository is still primarily rsync
2016-10-27 20:46:38	minimalism	like you know the /etc/portage/repos.conf/* files?
2016-10-27 20:46:47	minimalism	like gentoo.conf and anything for overlays
2016-10-27 20:46:53	minimalism	example gentoo.conf:
2016-10-27 20:46:55	minimalism	[DEFAULT]
2016-10-27 20:46:57	minimalism	main-repo = gentoo
2016-10-27 20:46:59	minimalism	[gentoo]
2016-10-27 20:47:01	minimalism	location = /usr/portage
2016-10-27 20:47:03	minimalism	sync-type = rsync
2016-10-27 20:47:05	minimalism	sync-uri = rsync://rsync.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage
2016-10-27 20:47:07	minimalism	auto-sync = yes
2016-10-27 20:47:09	minimalism	written for rsync
2016-10-27 20:47:11	minimalism	you can change that sync URI to the git one
2016-10-27 20:47:16	minimalism	and change type from rsync to git.. although it's not super supported
2016-10-27 20:47:31	minimalism	and the tox-overlay for example is git to begin with and hosted on github so
2016-10-27 20:47:33	minimalism	only options:
2016-10-27 20:47:36	minimalism	[tox-overlay]
2016-10-27 20:47:37	minimalism	location = /usr/local/overlay/tox-overlay
2016-10-27 20:47:39	minimalism	sync-type = git
2016-10-27 20:47:41	minimalism	sync-uri = git://github.com/Tox/gentoo-overlay-tox
2016-10-27 20:47:43	minimalism	auto-sync = yes
2016-10-27 20:49:16	alyptik	-C is remove right
2016-10-27 20:49:19	alyptik	for emerge
2016-10-27 20:50:01	minimalism	I don't think that's what -C was
2016-10-27 20:50:06	minimalism	I use emerge -cav for removing
2016-10-27 20:50:13	minimalism	and for depcleaning
2016-10-27 20:50:20	alyptik	oh -C seems like a force
2016-10-27 20:50:22	minimalism	ah yes
2016-10-27 20:50:25	alyptik	-cav is is
2016-10-27 20:50:28	alyptik	it is*
2016-10-27 20:50:29	minimalism	it's an an --unmerge
2016-10-27 20:50:37	minimalism	but yeah that may be a force
2016-10-27 20:50:51	minimalism	>> This  does  no
2016-10-27 20:50:53	minimalism	              checking  of  dependencies,  so it may remove packages necessary for the
2016-10-27 20:50:55	minimalism	              proper operation of your system.
2016-10-27 20:50:57	minimalism	yeah don't use -C
2016-10-27 20:51:12	alyptik	shit i typed -C by accident after all that
2016-10-27 20:51:14	alyptik	oh well
2016-10-27 20:51:20	minimalism	-a is shorthand for --ask btw
2016-10-27 20:51:26	minimalism	I just like to see what it'll do first
2016-10-27 20:51:28	alyptik	replacing libelf with another elf one anyway
2016-10-27 20:51:39	minimalism	and -v of course is verbose
2016-10-27 20:51:40	alyptik	should be fine
2016-10-27 20:51:44	alyptik	ah
2016-10-27 20:51:54	alyptik	are ebuilds and atoms the same also?
2016-10-27 20:52:00	alyptik	dont really get that whole part
2016-10-27 20:55:04	minimalism	I think they use it as another name, yeah
2016-10-27 20:55:04		[20:55]
2016-10-27 20:55:14	minimalism	because when you do a command that would be searching for a package/version in /usr/portage
2016-10-27 20:55:19	minimalism	it says invalid atom if it doesn't exist
2016-10-27 20:56:34	minimalism	gentoo and source based distributions appear to be quite a world
2016-10-27 20:56:59	minimalism	apparently robbins started funtoo because he didn't like the direction gentoo ended up going.. I think he regretted making it a foundation with a council and members etc.
2016-10-27 20:57:04	minimalism	then it becomes bureaucracy and stalemates
2016-10-27 20:57:33	alyptik	oh i understand now
2016-10-27 20:57:41	minimalism	understand what?
2016-10-27 20:57:45	alyptik	the atom thing
2016-10-27 20:57:56	minimalism	what is it
2016-10-27 20:58:16	alyptik	it is basically what gentoo calls the source package in the repo
2016-10-27 20:58:30	alyptik	or is that wrong
2016-10-27 20:59:02	alyptik	the ebuild thing though idk still
2016-10-27 21:00:23	alyptik	tbh the emerge man page is killing me
2016-10-27 21:00:26	alyptik	reminds me of gcc
2016-10-27 21:01:17	minimalism	looking forward to seeing if gentoo leads me to trying funtoo or exherbo in the future
2016-10-27 21:01:30	alyptik	exherbo?
2016-10-27 21:01:48	minimalism	it's another source based distribution
2016-10-27 21:01:53	alyptik	ah
2016-10-27 21:01:57	minimalism	gentoo is kind of like a religion where people splinter off
2016-10-27 21:02:17	minimalism	they don't necessarily fork, but they reinvent using the same principles with some core differences
2016-10-27 21:02:29	minimalism	there's sabayon (totally stupid and for dumb fucks too lazy to use gentoo properly)
2016-10-27 21:02:37	alyptik	sounds like what arch would be like if the arch clones werent all so bad
2016-10-27 21:02:40	minimalism	funtoo which is the founder of gentoo's recreation of it with some critical changes
2016-10-27 21:02:53	minimalism	and no bureaucracy similar to what gentoo has now with its voting and council people/developers
2016-10-27 21:03:05	minimalism	and exherbo is in the same spirit as gentoo, but its own thing
2016-10-27 21:03:19	alyptik	in regards to what exactly?
2016-10-27 21:03:24	alyptik	the core devs?
2016-10-27 21:03:33	minimalism	?
2016-10-27 21:03:45	alyptik	the bureaucracy 
2016-10-27 21:06:26	minimalism	oh gentoo has some council of people
2016-10-27 21:06:30	minimalism	that vote on things before making decisions
2016-10-27 21:06:41	minimalism	which is probably why some things about gentoo seem archaic
2016-10-27 21:06:57	minimalism	there isn't just a couple people who can decide something on their own and immediately take action
2016-10-27 21:07:02	minimalism	like arch or something
2016-10-27 21:07:04	alyptik	that makes me think of a cabal hah
2016-10-27 21:07:10	minimalism	there is a drawback to a non-democratic option though
2016-10-27 21:07:15	minimalism	because with arch we ended up with systemd
2016-10-27 21:07:36	minimalism	gentoo council would never allow that to happen with it being implemented as the main option
2016-10-27 21:07:40	alyptik	who decided that anyway, just a couple core devs?
2016-10-27 21:07:47	alyptik	and everyone said fuck it
2016-10-27 21:07:52	minimalism	on arch, I believe so
2016-10-27 21:07:56	minimalism	project lead/owner/whatever
2016-10-27 21:07:58	alyptik	ah
2016-10-27 21:08:19	minimalism	if there is a vote of any kind
2016-10-27 21:08:28	minimalism	it's just between a few people
2016-10-27 21:08:43	alyptik	on arch?
2016-10-27 21:09:09	minimalism	yeah
2016-10-27 21:09:13	alyptik	sounds about right
2016-10-27 21:09:14	minimalism	this is what gentoo does apparently: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Council
2016-10-27 21:12:48	minimalism	truthfully, I don't think arch really believed systemd was best
2016-10-27 21:12:48		[21:12]
2016-10-27 21:13:04	minimalism	I think they were just too arrogant to use gentoo's openrc project because it was gentoo's
2016-10-27 21:13:16	alyptik	oh didn't know it was gentoo's
2016-10-27 21:13:49	alyptik	interesting
2016-10-27 21:13:54	alyptik	this page
2016-10-27 21:14:39	minimalism	yeah.. drawbacks to each solution though
2016-10-27 21:14:49	minimalism	a council can create gridlock like congress, but
2016-10-27 21:14:59	minimalism	it can stop terrible things from changing for the worse
2016-10-27 21:15:00	alyptik	filabusters
2016-10-27 21:15:03	alyptik	hah
2016-10-27 21:15:18	minimalism	on the other hand.. arch may be responsible for the systemd epidemic
2016-10-27 21:15:25	minimalism	they were the earliest adopter after Red Hat itself
2016-10-27 21:15:47	alyptik	dunno if systemd will ever stop
2016-10-27 21:15:57	minimalism	it might
2016-10-27 21:15:57	alyptik	eventually we will see Systemd/Linux
2016-10-27 21:16:05	minimalism	over my dead body
2016-10-27 21:16:15	alyptik	lol
2016-10-27 21:16:16	minimalism	I'd sooner start my own distribution than deal with that
2016-10-27 21:16:32	minimalism	this is why it's important to gain higher level technical knowledge
2016-10-27 21:16:45	minimalism	so you don't have to get dragged into these situations where you have no other options
2016-10-27 21:16:57	alyptik	very true
2016-10-27 21:17:32	minimalism	most arch users think they're at the top of the ladder and don't have anything else to learn
2016-10-27 21:17:44	minimalism	really, really arrogant
2016-10-27 21:17:49	minimalism	even using gentoo doesn't put you anywhere near the top
2016-10-27 21:18:21	minimalism	until you're writing core utilities in C and able to build your own system from scratch like with LFS or something.. then I mean, no way
2016-10-27 21:18:43	alyptik	you aren't near the top until you are maintaining kernel or something
2016-10-27 21:24:00		[21:18]
2016-10-27 21:28:46	minimalism	forgot to link exherbo
2016-10-27 21:28:48	minimalism	http://exherbo.org/
2016-10-27 21:28:56	minimalism	omp recommends this, and was apparently a former gentoo developer
2016-10-27 21:29:10	minimalism	I'm not gonna use it probably, but might be fun to play with
2016-10-27 21:29:17	alyptik	yeah i remember that about him
2016-10-27 21:29:48	alyptik	lol this page immediately reminds you of omp too 
2016-10-27 21:35:00		[21:29]
2016-10-27 21:35:31	minimalism	lol how so
2016-10-27 21:35:38	alyptik	the cow
2016-10-27 21:35:47	minimalism	well the cow is more about gentoo
2016-10-27 21:36:04	minimalism	the old gentoo mascot way back when and still even now was Larry the cow
2016-10-27 21:36:12	alyptik	lol
2016-10-27 21:36:23	minimalism	http://git.exherbo.org/summer/packages/media/mpv/
2016-10-27 21:36:24	minimalism	http://git.exherbo.org/summer/packages/media-gfx/sxiv/
2016-10-27 21:36:27	minimalism	it's not too different at least
2016-10-27 21:36:53	alyptik	hm
2016-10-27 21:37:06	alyptik	if i have to reboot how bad is a ctrl-C mid emerge@world
2016-10-27 21:38:01	minimalism	I'm honestly not sure.. I don't know if it actually installs anything during the emerge
2016-10-27 21:38:10	minimalism	like it may just be building packages inside /usr/portage/distfiles
2016-10-27 21:38:19	minimalism	before actually merging them, but I think it does them one by one
2016-10-27 21:38:25	alyptik	seems like it is only compiling
2016-10-27 21:38:28	minimalism	so I guess it depends on what package you Ctrl+C'd on
2016-10-27 21:38:40	alyptik	sys-devel/gcc hah
2016-10-27 21:38:42	alyptik	i will wait
2016-10-27 21:38:47	minimalism	yeah.. maybe recompile
2016-10-27 21:39:00	minimalism	also you can ban fortran USE flag globally
2016-10-27 21:39:13	minimalism	it's default with gcc and fftw.. totally pointless
2016-10-27 21:39:14	alyptik	think i did that already per your seugg
2016-10-27 21:39:16	alyptik	sugg*
2016-10-27 21:45:00		[21:39]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[06:56:59] apparently robbins started funtoo because he didn't like the direction gentoo ended up going.. I think he regretted making it a foundation with a council and members etc. [06:56:59]
2016-10-27 22:29:52		[22:29]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[06:57:04] then it becomes bureaucracy and stalemates [06:57:04]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[06:57:41] understand what? [06:57:41]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[06:57:56] what is it [06:57:56]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:01:17] looking forward to seeing if gentoo leads me to trying funtoo or exherbo in the future [07:01:17]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:01:48] it's another source based distribution [07:01:48]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:01:57] gentoo is kind of like a religion where people splinter off [07:01:57]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:02:17] they don't necessarily fork, but they reinvent using the same principles with some core differences [07:02:17]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:02:29] there's sabayon (totally stupid and for dumb fucks too lazy to use gentoo properly) [07:02:29]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:02:40] funtoo which is the founder of gentoo's recreation of it with some critical changes [07:02:40]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:02:53] and no bureaucracy similar to what gentoo has now with its voting and council people/developers [07:02:53]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:03:05] and exherbo is in the same spirit as gentoo, but its own thing [07:03:05]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:03:33] ? [07:03:33]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:06:26] oh gentoo has some council of people [07:06:26]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:06:30] that vote on things before making decisions [07:06:30]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:06:41] which is probably why some things about gentoo seem archaic [07:06:41]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:06:57] there isn't just a couple people who can decide something on their own and immediately take action [07:06:57]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:07:02] like arch or something [07:07:02]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:07:10] there is a drawback to a non-democratic option though [07:07:10]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:07:15] because with arch we ended up with systemd [07:07:15]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:07:36] gentoo council would never allow that to happen with it being implemented as the main option [07:07:36]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:07:52] on arch, I believe so [07:07:52]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:07:56] project lead/owner/whatever [07:07:56]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:08:19] if there is a vote of any kind [07:08:19]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:08:28] it's just between a few people [07:08:28]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:09:09] yeah [07:09:09]
2016-10-27 22:29:52	minimalism	[07:09:14] this is what gentoo does apparently: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Council [07:09:14]

2016-10-28 01:40:11	alyptik	ah
2016-10-28 01:40:11	minimalism	I'm pretty much immune to influenza now
2016-10-28 01:40:16	alyptik	lol
2016-10-28 01:40:45	minimalism	watching a video of some Indian tech scammer trying to scam some dude who's actually using Linux
2016-10-28 01:40:52	minimalism	and he's running Windows in a VM to play her
2016-10-28 01:40:56	minimalism	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw-MUOCSZrA
2016-10-28 01:41:57	minimalism	It's truly insulting how bad they are at scamming people
2016-10-28 01:41:57		[01:41]
2016-10-28 01:42:02	alyptik	shit i have heard of this happening too to people here too
2016-10-28 01:42:04	minimalism	but if they were actually good, they could just do actual work
2016-10-28 01:42:09	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-28 01:42:37	minimalism	You could make millions in like a week if you were good at this
2016-10-28 01:42:52	minimalism	just be white with a North American accent basically, mostly just the accent
2016-10-28 01:43:08	minimalism	use VoIP to fake location of origin phone number, really do some good work on the phone number and caller display name
2016-10-28 01:45:04	alyptik	if you are that smart blackhat still prob pays better though
2016-10-28 01:45:07	alyptik	with that you could do
2016-10-28 01:48:10	minimalism	oh there's tons of things anyone with a brain can do to rob everyone blind
2016-10-28 01:48:20	minimalism	you pretty much have to expatriate with the loot though
2016-10-28 01:49:31	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-28 01:51:48	minimalism	https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/comments/59lq95/the_one_time_g_was_right/?st=iutp62q1&sh=36973035
2016-10-28 01:52:00	minimalism	forget how I got onto reddit today.. never use it
2016-10-28 01:52:57	alyptik	clang
2016-10-28 01:53:04	alyptik	i should figure that out someday
2016-10-28 01:53:44	minimalism	I was using it on freebsd for like a week when I was deciding on a new OS for a production server
2016-10-28 01:54:00	alyptik	how is it?
2016-10-28 01:54:02	minimalism	but it encountered errors with ruby gems because it's a foreign package manager that is mostly only compatible with gcc for certain gems
2016-10-28 01:54:06	minimalism	clang is fine, however
2016-10-28 01:54:10	minimalism	it's exactly as the thread says
2016-10-28 01:54:12	alyptik	yeah i have icc
2016-10-28 01:54:17	minimalism	you need a gcc fallback exception
2016-10-28 01:54:24	alyptik	fking impossible to compile some thing with it meant for gcc
2016-10-28 01:54:25	minimalism	which is what alpine does with how it uses busybox/musl
2016-10-28 01:54:37	minimalism	you install a package called build-base that just knows when to use what
2016-10-28 01:55:09	minimalism	I think GNU and glibc are moldy and need to go, but for the time being, we need well setup fallbacks
2016-10-28 01:55:33	alyptik	for sure
2016-10-28 01:57:38	minimalism	I really think Alpine's got the right idea
2016-10-28 01:57:38		[01:57]
2016-10-28 01:58:08	minimalism	it does use binary, and has a sort of ports system similar to arch's ABS with I think some similarities to ports in general with BSDs
2016-10-28 01:58:20	minimalism	but it uses binary since the places it's often used are way too weak to compile
2016-10-28 01:58:25	alyptik	BSD does some thing right
2016-10-28 01:58:31	alyptik	ports is def one
2016-10-28 01:58:37	minimalism	I feel like they got some ideas right
2016-10-28 01:58:40	minimalism	then executed wrong
2016-10-28 01:58:44	alyptik	lol
2016-10-28 01:58:48	minimalism	I actually tried ports and it pissed me off
2016-10-28 01:58:51	minimalism	it sounded great in theory
2016-10-28 01:59:02	alyptik	i guess theory != practice always hah
2016-10-28 01:59:14	minimalism	a ports system with a build command and parameters similar to gentoo's USE flags
2016-10-28 01:59:16	minimalism	would be sweet
2016-10-28 01:59:39	minimalism	like ports install pkgname --USE=ncurses,-X,alsa
2016-10-28 02:00:12	minimalism	with a ports build command as well to be used within a dir containing a build file
2016-10-28 02:00:20	minimalism	in case you wanted to modify something or write your own
2016-10-28 02:01:23	alyptik	that would actually be pretty cool
2016-10-28 02:01:46	minimalism	Alpine seems like the ideal operating system atm
2016-10-28 02:02:02	alyptik	i should look at it more
2016-10-28 02:02:04	minimalism	it plateaus versioned repositories
2016-10-28 02:02:04	alyptik	it sounds cool
2016-10-28 02:02:13	minimalism	like a repository for 3.4 with stable versions of everything in it
2016-10-28 02:02:21	minimalism	or you can use the edge repository for bleeding edge use
2016-10-28 02:02:43	minimalism	another reason I dislike arch.. single version availability
2016-10-28 02:02:53	alyptik	yeah that does suck
2016-10-28 02:03:02	alyptik	specicially when shit breaks
2016-10-28 02:03:19	minimalism	yeah then you need to go to fucking seblu.net
2016-10-28 02:03:25	minimalism	and do a whole thing with a chroot and wget
2016-10-28 02:09:00		[02:03]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[07:28:56] omp recommends this, and was apparently a former gentoo developer [07:28:56]
2016-10-28 11:26:22		[11:26]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[07:29:10] I'm not gonna use it probably, but might be fun to play with [07:29:10]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[07:35:30] lol how so [07:35:30]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[07:35:47] well the cow is more about gentoo [07:35:47]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[07:36:04] the old gentoo mascot way back when and still even now was Larry the cow [07:36:04]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[07:36:23] http://git.exherbo.org/summer/packages/media/mpv/ [07:36:23]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[07:36:24] http://git.exherbo.org/summer/packages/media-gfx/sxiv/ [07:36:24]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[07:36:27] it's not too different at least [07:36:27]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[07:38:01] I'm honestly not sure.. I don't know if it actually installs anything during the emerge [07:38:01]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[07:38:10] like it may just be building packages inside /usr/portage/distfiles [07:38:10]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[07:38:19] before actually merging them, but I think it does them one by one [07:38:19]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[07:38:28] so I guess it depends on what package you Ctrl+C'd on [07:38:28]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[07:38:47] yeah.. maybe recompile [07:38:47]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[07:39:00] also you can ban fortran USE flag globally [07:39:00]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[07:39:13] it's default with gcc and fftw.. totally pointless [07:39:13]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[11:25:59] tfw thought was okay, then sick again, then kind of okay again [11:25:59]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[11:40:00] no just some annoying headache coupled with recent sleep pattern fuckups [11:40:00]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[11:40:11] I'm pretty much immune to influenza now [11:40:11]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[11:40:45] watching a video of some Indian tech scammer trying to scam some dude who's actually using Linux [11:40:45]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[11:40:52] and he's running Windows in a VM to play her [11:40:52]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[11:40:56] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw-MUOCSZrA [11:40:56]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[11:41:57] It's truly insulting how bad they are at scamming people [11:41:57]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[11:42:04] but if they were actually good, they could just do actual work [11:42:04]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[11:42:37] You could make millions in like a week if you were good at this [11:42:37]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[11:42:52] just be white with a North American accent basically, mostly just the accent [11:42:52]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[11:43:08] use VoIP to fake location of origin phone number, really do some good work on the phone number and caller display name [11:43:08]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[11:48:10] oh there's tons of things anyone with a brain can do to rob everyone blind [11:48:10]
2016-10-28 11:26:22	minimalism	[11:48:20] you pretty much have to expatriate with the loot though [11:48:20]

2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[11:52:00] forget how I got onto reddit today.. never use it [11:52:00]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[11:53:44] I was using it on freebsd for like a week when I was deciding on a new OS for a production server [11:53:44]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[11:54:02] but it encountered errors with ruby gems because it's a foreign package manager that is mostly only compatible with gcc for certain gems [11:54:02]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[11:54:06] clang is fine, however [11:54:06]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[11:54:10] it's exactly as the thread says [11:54:10]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[11:54:17] you need a gcc fallback exception [11:54:17]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[11:54:25] which is what alpine does with how it uses busybox/musl [11:54:25]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[11:54:37] you install a package called build-base that just knows when to use what [11:54:37]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[11:55:09] I think GNU and glibc are moldy and need to go, but for the time being, we need well setup fallbacks [11:55:09]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[11:57:38] I really think Alpine's got the right idea [11:57:38]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[11:58:08] it does use binary, and has a sort of ports system similar to arch's ABS with I think some similarities to ports in general with BSDs [11:58:08]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[11:58:20] but it uses binary since the places it's often used are way too weak to compile [11:58:20]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[11:58:37] I feel like they got some ideas right [11:58:37]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[11:58:40] then executed wrong [11:58:40]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[11:58:47] I actually tried ports and it pissed me off [11:58:47]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[11:58:50] it sounded great in theory [11:58:50]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[11:59:14] a ports system with a build command and parameters similar to gentoo's USE flags [11:59:14]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[11:59:16] would be sweet [11:59:16]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[11:59:39] like ports install pkgname --USE=ncurses,-X,alsa [11:59:39]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[12:00:12] with a ports build command as well to be used within a dir containing a build file [12:00:12]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[12:00:20] in case you wanted to modify something or write your own [12:00:20]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[12:01:46] Alpine seems like the ideal operating system atm [12:01:46]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[12:02:04] it plateaus versioned repositories [12:02:04]

2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[12:03:25] and do a whole thing with a chroot and wget [12:03:25]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[17:53:22] dat feel when FBI re-opens Clinton investigation [17:53:22]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[17:54:42] look at how quickly democrats are dismissing Comey's credibility now [17:54:42]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[17:54:57] they were all claiming his decision in defense this whole time, and now he believes there's more to it [17:54:57]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[17:55:02] and "fuck comey" is the new sentiment [17:55:02]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[17:59:28] if Hillary went to prison and/or lost the election, the only thing that could make it better a completely new candidate on the ballot who swept in last second who was a rational centrist libertarian who ended up winning the presidency [17:59:28]
2016-10-28 11:26:23	minimalism	[17:59:35] better is* [17:59:35]
2016-10-28 11:27:54	alyptik	shit my install is great
2016-10-28 11:28:09	alyptik	but i can't boot because of lack of/wrong initamfs
2016-10-28 11:28:20	alyptik	trying to fix now heh
2016-10-28 11:34:00		[11:28]
2016-10-28 11:38:21	minimalism	just did an mkvextract on a bunch of files, and thinking about how to go through all of them to create into new mkvs
2016-10-28 11:38:46	alyptik	not sure for mkv but mkv you can just cat them together
2016-10-28 11:38:54	alyptik	s/but mkv/but mp4
2016-10-28 11:39:17	minimalism	nah it's an mkv situation with mkvtoolnix commands, the issue though is
2016-10-28 11:39:25	minimalism	imagine each original mkv had a filename like
2016-10-28 11:39:29	minimalism	DB - 01.mkv
2016-10-28 11:39:33	alyptik	whats a good article to get started with dracut btw?
2016-10-28 11:39:43	minimalism	they were all extracted to get video, audio, subtitles, etc.
2016-10-28 11:39:48	alyptik	oh that's what you mean
2016-10-28 11:39:55	minimalism	so they're name FILENAME_01 FILENAME_02, etc.
2016-10-28 11:40:01	minimalism	FILENAME being DB - 01.mkv
2016-10-28 11:40:13	minimalism	and so I have a directory full of these files extracted for each episode
2016-10-28 11:40:25	minimalism	and I need to assemble them all in one shot into their individual episodes
2016-10-28 11:40:30	minimalism	01-04 for each file piece
2016-10-28 11:40:38	alyptik	so reverse your extract
2016-10-28 11:40:50	alyptik	?
2016-10-28 11:41:18	minimalism	I'm in like retard mode right now so I can't even process that
2016-10-28 11:41:28	alyptik	am asking if that's what you mean
2016-10-28 11:41:33	alyptik	not sure how to do it either
2016-10-28 11:47:00		[11:41]
2016-10-28 11:54:49	minimalism	almost overflowed my disk there
2016-10-28 11:54:56	alyptik	lol
2016-10-28 11:55:14	minimalism	was duplicating dirs of the video files
2016-10-28 11:55:26	minimalism	and it almost went over the line.. it fatal'd on I/O though
2016-10-28 12:00:14	minimalism	animal crackers, gentoo, mkv merging Dragon Ball
2016-10-28 12:00:20	minimalism	yes, this was God's plan for the world
2016-10-28 12:06:00		[12:00]
2016-10-28 12:07:53	alyptik	whats a good article to get started with dracut btw?
2016-10-28 12:08:04	alyptik	or wiki or whichever ref you are using
2016-10-28 12:08:10	alyptik	and lol
2016-10-28 12:08:17	minimalism	I haven't used dracut
2016-10-28 12:08:19	minimalism	I have it installed though
2016-10-28 12:08:31	minimalism	I did a temporary phone in just to get started
2016-10-28 12:08:37	minimalism	used genkernel's initramfs option
2016-10-28 12:08:43	minimalism	I did not phone in the kernel though.. all custom
2016-10-28 12:08:48	alyptik	well i have a maul compiled kernel :[
2016-10-28 12:08:56	alyptik	so that has to be dracut i think
2016-10-28 12:09:07	alyptik	or wait lemme go reread gentoo handbook
2016-10-28 12:12:11	alyptik	s/maul/manual
2016-10-28 12:12:33	minimalism	you can still use genkernel for an initramfs
2016-10-28 12:12:37	minimalism	even with your own custom kernel
2016-10-28 12:12:40	minimalism	that's what I did
2016-10-28 12:12:46	alyptik	hm lemme give that a shit
2016-10-28 12:12:49	alyptik	rofl
2016-10-28 12:12:51	alyptik	shot*

2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[21:39:17] nah it's an mkv situation with mkvtoolnix commands, the issue though is [21:39:17]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[21:39:25] imagine each original mkv had a filename like [21:39:25]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[21:39:29] DB - 01.mkv [21:39:29]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[21:39:43] they were all extracted to get video, audio, subtitles, etc. [21:39:43]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[21:39:55] so they're name FILENAME_01 FILENAME_02, etc. [21:39:55]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[21:40:01] FILENAME being DB - 01.mkv [21:40:01]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[21:40:13] and so I have a directory full of these files extracted for each episode [21:40:13]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[21:40:25] and I need to assemble them all in one shot into their individual episodes [21:40:25]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[21:40:30] 01-04 for each file piece [21:40:30]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[21:41:18] I'm in like retard mode right now so I can't even process that [21:41:18]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[21:54:49] almost overflowed my disk there [21:54:49]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[21:55:14] was duplicating dirs of the video files [21:55:14]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[21:55:26] and it almost went over the line.. it fatal'd on I/O though [21:55:26]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[22:00:14] animal crackers, gentoo, mkv merging Dragon Ball [22:00:14]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[22:00:20] yes, this was God's plan for the world [22:00:20]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[22:08:17] I haven't used dracut [22:08:17]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[22:08:19] I have it installed though [22:08:19]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[22:08:31] I did a temporary phone in just to get started [22:08:31]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[22:08:37] used genkernel's initramfs option [22:08:37]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[22:08:43] I did not phone in the kernel though.. all custom [22:08:43]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[22:12:33] you can still use genkernel for an initramfs [22:12:33]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[22:12:37] even with your own custom kernel [22:12:37]
2016-10-28 12:28:15	minimalism	[22:12:40] that's what I did [22:12:40]
2016-10-28 12:29:01	alyptik	fuck lol
2016-10-28 12:29:07	alyptik	my cpu keeps overheating when compiling
2016-10-28 12:29:13	alyptik	then i lock up
2016-10-28 12:35:00		[12:29]
2016-10-28 19:48:44	minimalism	sorry was away
2016-10-28 19:48:44		[19:48]
2016-10-28 19:48:56	alyptik	no worries
2016-10-28 19:49:03	alyptik	i spent 2 hours figuring out USE flags ha
2016-10-28 19:49:10	alyptik	finally make vim compile with +python3
2016-10-28 19:49:19	alyptik	made*
2016-10-28 19:53:34	minimalism	mine is built with both
2016-10-28 19:53:42	minimalism	I didn't touch python flags or anything like that..
2016-10-28 19:53:58	alyptik	weird
2016-10-28 19:54:27	alyptik	oh and after a lot of search ebuild=PKGBUILD and atom=package
2016-10-28 19:54:35	alyptik	so simple bleh, but had to look in dev docs
2016-10-28 19:55:19	minimalism	lol
2016-10-28 19:55:25	minimalism	duplicate terminology.. always wonderful
2016-10-28 19:55:36	minimalism	makes sense though they wanted something of their own for everything
2016-10-28 19:55:41	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-28 19:55:50	minimalism	ebuilds and atoms.. I like the terms at least
2016-10-28 19:55:58	alyptik	the world needs to just call them fucking install scripts though
2016-10-28 19:56:03	alyptik	atoms is ok, that makes more sense
2016-10-28 19:58:48	minimalism	I call them build files
2016-10-28 19:59:18	minimalism	install is more so just one part of the build file
2016-10-28 19:59:35	alyptik	true build scripts is better
2016-10-28 19:59:47	alyptik	for distros like this
2016-10-28 20:00:09	alyptik	the install step is usually just copying fakeroot anyway 
2016-10-28 20:06:00		[20:00]
2016-10-28 20:32:34	minimalism	I'm more focused on this whole Dragon Ball rip/translation thing than I am on gentoo
2016-10-28 20:32:34		[20:32]
2016-10-28 20:32:40	minimalism	should be the other way around.. but damnit
2016-10-28 20:33:00	alyptik	lol
2016-10-28 20:33:10	alyptik	i have just been reading and emerging all day
2016-10-28 20:39:00		[20:33]
2016-10-28 20:42:09	alyptik	ah ok i have to import my phone one
2016-10-28 20:42:10	alyptik	sec
2016-10-28 20:42:25	minimalism	keep in mind though
2016-10-28 20:42:29	minimalism	this isn't centralized, so
2016-10-28 20:42:32	minimalism	any contacts you add on one
2016-10-28 20:42:38	minimalism	won't be added on the other
2016-10-28 20:43:01	alyptik	hm if i logged into the same ID though
2016-10-28 20:43:05	alyptik	then add you, what happens?
2016-10-28 20:44:10	minimalism	Elaborate
2016-10-28 20:44:20	alyptik	it is a toxme.io profile
2016-10-28 20:44:26	minimalism	no
2016-10-28 20:44:32	minimalism	there are no profiles centralized in some foreign place
2016-10-28 20:44:41	alyptik	ah ok so i should add you on phone
2016-10-28 20:44:43	alyptik	then export right
2016-10-28 20:44:47	minimalism	well, no
2016-10-28 20:44:58	minimalism	I think it's entirely stored in the file
2016-10-28 20:45:01	minimalism	similar to gpg
2016-10-28 20:45:21	minimalism	I think toxme.io is purely a nameserver
2016-10-28 20:45:23	minimalism	connecting everyone
2016-10-28 20:45:26	alyptik	so then the IDs are different?
2016-10-28 20:45:31	minimalism	well..
2016-10-28 20:45:39	minimalism	no, but
2016-10-28 20:45:46	minimalism	it's kind of like two parallel copies of a drive
2016-10-28 20:45:51	minimalism	one can change as it's used
2016-10-28 20:46:08	alyptik	so if you message me where does the message go
2016-10-28 20:46:11	alyptik	since it is by ID?
2016-10-28 20:46:35	alyptik	you know what lets just try it hah
2016-10-28 20:46:36	minimalism	I'm not entirely clear on how it works, but there's essentially no cloud function here whatsoever
2016-10-28 20:46:37	alyptik	easier
2016-10-28 20:46:48	minimalism	it's almost entirely stored in your data file
2016-10-28 20:46:56	minimalism	and the nameserver is basically just the link
2016-10-28 20:47:36	alyptik	try that https://cryptobin.co/v0s536x3
2016-10-28 20:47:39	alyptik	same as before
2016-10-28 20:48:18	alyptik	oh nice
2016-10-28 20:48:20	alyptik	got it on both
2016-10-28 20:48:24	alyptik	try messaging me 
2016-10-28 20:49:17	minimalism	you're going on and offline and it's not displaying a nick
2016-10-28 20:49:54	minimalism	I don't know what you're doing but it's super glitchy
2016-10-28 20:50:14	alyptik	ah ok i get it
2016-10-28 20:50:22	alyptik	it is one profile but not meant to be logged in 2 places at once
2016-10-28 20:50:34	alyptik	it syncs the ID so it's good enough
2016-10-28 20:51:17	alyptik	still glitchy?
2016-10-28 20:52:32	alyptik	well i am only logged into phone now so i see it there
2016-10-28 20:53:50	alyptik	wait can you see what i type
2016-10-28 20:53:57	alyptik	logged into only computer now
2016-10-28 20:58:41	alyptik	good enough for me; was mostly wondering if antox was useless
2016-10-28 20:58:41		[20:58]
2016-10-28 21:10:05	minimalism	using something like tox on a google anything device seems to defeat the purpose
2016-10-28 21:10:10	minimalism	similar to protonmail on android and ios
2016-10-28 21:10:18	minimalism	sure, transmission is encrypted.. however
2016-10-28 21:10:24	minimalism	it's going to be received and open, or sent from
2016-10-28 21:10:28	minimalism	a device that is highly monitored
2016-10-28 21:11:35	alyptik	that is a good point
2016-10-28 21:12:16	alyptik	i disabled a shitton of phone home services but still prob not the best idea
2016-10-28 21:12:53	minimalism	I'm using copperhead
2016-10-28 21:12:56	minimalism	with almost nothing on it
2016-10-28 21:13:43	alyptik	how is that btw?
2016-10-28 21:13:43		[21:13]
2016-10-28 21:13:47	alyptik	i know you've had it a while
2016-10-28 21:14:12	minimalism	I love it, but unfortunately it no longer receives support for my device
2016-10-28 21:14:29	minimalism	I'd rather a deprecated/unsupported OS though than use Android or CM
2016-10-28 21:14:42	minimalism	I only use this thing for FreeOTP mainly anyway with some stuff from F-Droid
2016-10-28 21:14:55	alyptik	what about like LTE?
2016-10-28 21:14:59	alyptik	works good?
2016-10-28 21:14:59	minimalism	like mBrowser (literally does nothing but open web pages with checkboxes to support images/scripts or not)
2016-10-28 21:15:06	minimalism	I don't use mobile phone service
2016-10-28 21:15:10	minimalism	I have a real thing about being tracked
2016-10-28 21:15:17	alyptik	oh in that case shit
2016-10-28 21:15:26	alyptik	no reason at all to care about support
2016-10-28 21:15:28	minimalism	I'm fairly sure there's no issue with it
2016-10-28 21:15:41	minimalism	it uses the AOSP apps mostly
2016-10-28 21:15:47	minimalism	without google's modifications done to them
2016-10-28 21:15:48	alyptik	i am reliant on my data plan etc
2016-10-28 21:15:56	alyptik	or else i'd be on a non stock ROM
2016-10-28 21:16:00	minimalism	I don't think you'll have any issue
2016-10-28 21:16:04	minimalism	ask polyzen
2016-10-28 21:16:07	alyptik	my phone does
2016-10-28 21:16:09	minimalism	he used copperhead and has phone service
2016-10-28 21:16:13	alyptik	this partitcular model
2016-10-28 21:16:17	minimalism	what model is it
2016-10-28 21:16:22	alyptik	LG G Stylo
2016-10-28 21:16:30	alyptik	mostly due to not much dev going on at xda
2016-10-28 21:16:30	minimalism	ah that's not a google phone
2016-10-28 21:16:33	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-28 21:16:34	minimalism	copperhead only supports google phones
2016-10-28 21:16:37	alyptik	was a bad choice
2016-10-28 21:17:20	minimalism	the price for mobile service in Canada though
2016-10-28 21:17:23	minimalism	plus being tracked..
2016-10-28 21:17:25	minimalism	no way, man
2016-10-28 21:17:27	minimalism	not worth it
2016-10-28 21:17:36	alyptik	heh
2016-10-28 21:17:49	minimalism	the government gets a free tracking device wherever you go and a full ear on everything you're doing
2016-10-28 21:17:54	minimalism	and you're paying them for the privilege
2016-10-28 21:18:01	minimalism	that is just... I don't even know anymore
2016-10-28 21:18:06	minimalism	this whole thing is backwards
2016-10-28 21:18:07	alyptik	yeah 
2016-10-28 21:18:18	alyptik	cell towers = you are tracked at all times
2016-10-28 21:18:38	minimalism	if they start implanting chips as IDs
2016-10-28 21:18:56	minimalism	I'll either find some way out of it, or remove it from my skin and deceive them into thinking I'm still chipped
2016-10-28 21:19:01	alyptik	i doubt they will
2016-10-28 21:19:05	alyptik	not many use phone without service
2016-10-28 21:19:08	minimalism	heh, we'll see
2016-10-28 21:19:11	minimalism	they do it to pets
2016-10-28 21:19:20	alyptik	pets can't make calls tho
2016-10-28 21:19:21	alyptik	hah
2016-10-28 21:19:34	minimalism	I wasn't referring to phone service as much as just
2016-10-28 21:19:41	minimalism	gov embedding tracking chips/IDs in our skin
2016-10-28 21:19:44	alyptik	oh
2016-10-28 21:19:51	alyptik	shit that is likely
2016-10-28 21:19:57	alyptik	i wouldnt bet against it
2016-10-28 21:19:58	minimalism	but I know that the tracking microchips in pets was not because people cared about pets
2016-10-28 21:20:07	minimalism	it was testing for the next one
2016-10-28 21:20:18	alyptik	lojack fo people
2016-10-28 21:20:31	minimalism	we have trouble stopping animal abuse, but we have tracking chips in cats and dogs, filling databases
2016-10-28 21:20:51	alyptik	and the IoT botnet
2016-10-28 21:20:52	alyptik	ofc
2016-10-28 21:21:04	minimalism	People have lost any semblance of common sense
2016-10-28 21:21:10	minimalism	I think there were refrigerators..
2016-10-28 21:21:13	minimalism	with twitter integration?
2016-10-28 21:21:22	alyptik	that huge DDoS recently
2016-10-28 21:21:27	alyptik	was supposed to be an IoT botnet
2016-10-28 21:21:34	minimalism	probably
2016-10-28 21:21:43	minimalism	ton of dormant devices that don't get updated can just be picked up
2016-10-28 21:21:48	minimalism	I think it's all really stupid, but
2016-10-28 21:21:58	minimalism	knowing is half the battle, so you can intentionally get dumb appliances
2016-10-28 21:22:08	alyptik	no idea why we need IoT
2016-10-28 21:22:11	alyptik	seriously
2016-10-28 21:22:15	minimalism	10-20 years down the line
2016-10-28 21:22:30	minimalism	people like us on IRC who actually know how these things work can probably get a coffeemaker to kill its owner
2016-10-28 21:22:39	alyptik	rofl
2016-10-28 21:24:54	minimalism	I'd be very wary of IoT controlling machines with radiation like microwaves
2016-10-28 21:25:30	alyptik	well microwaves are shielded and i doubt they can bypass the safeguards
2016-10-28 21:25:38	minimalism	well, you say that..
2016-10-28 21:25:44	alyptik	you would need to short and make a hole in shielding or something
2016-10-28 21:25:51	alyptik	which is possible actually
2016-10-28 21:25:52	alyptik	shit
2016-10-28 21:25:57	minimalism	but I don't think we could have predicted 10 years ago that idiots would integrate some ridiculous new thing called social media into a refrigerator
2016-10-28 21:26:28	minimalism	honestly, it's pretty dangerous in general controlling all these temperature controlled machines
2016-10-28 21:26:30	minimalism	imagine this
2016-10-28 21:26:40	minimalism	someone gains control of your oven
2016-10-28 21:26:45	minimalism	raises heat to point of starting a fire
2016-10-28 21:26:57	minimalism	increses refrigerator temperature until everything melts
2016-10-28 21:27:05	minimalism	let's pretend water escape from the refrigerator
2016-10-28 21:27:07	alyptik	fuck that would suck ass
2016-10-28 21:27:16	minimalism	what if one of those devices forcefully is forced to go on the fritz
2016-10-28 21:27:22	minimalism	and the electricity comes into contact with that water
2016-10-28 21:28:02	minimalism	science, a little creative destruction, and the internet.. neighborhoods could be burned down
2016-10-28 21:28:19	alyptik	IoT is the first horseman
2016-10-28 21:28:20	alyptik	hah
2016-10-28 21:28:22	minimalism	Anything that can happen, probably will, and it all seems unnecessary and stupid. Because 20 more years down the line.
2016-10-28 21:28:33	minimalism	We'll be paying security experts because we just discovered cyber security in homes
2016-10-28 21:28:38	minimalism	like we did recently with our own normal computers
2016-10-28 21:28:43	minimalism	to "harden"
2016-10-28 21:28:43		[21:28]
2016-10-28 21:28:44	alyptik	indeed
2016-10-28 21:28:46	minimalism	appliances
2016-10-28 21:28:53	minimalism	when the solution to begin with was just not to put them online in the first place
2016-10-28 21:28:54	alyptik	hardening my toilet
2016-10-28 21:28:57	alyptik	i lul now
2016-10-28 21:29:03	alyptik	not in 10 years
2016-10-28 21:30:12	minimalism	well it's going to happen in California in 5
2016-10-28 21:30:24	minimalism	and the next forest fires will be blamed on global warming when it was really some asshole's smart house
2016-10-28 21:30:30	alyptik	lol
2016-10-28 21:30:59	minimalism	I think it's all crazy and insane, but on the other hand
2016-10-28 21:31:13	minimalism	if I am *really* good at understanding the unix-like systems these things run on
2016-10-28 21:31:17	minimalism	and can get away with it
2016-10-28 21:31:36	minimalism	I might just swing by places and flicker the lights and turn on music
2016-10-28 21:32:11	minimalism	turn an entire neighborhood into a rave
2016-10-28 21:32:23	alyptik	hah
2016-10-28 21:32:31	alyptik	that would actually be fun as as fuck
2016-10-28 21:32:38	minimalism	it's already happening now
2016-10-28 21:33:02	minimalism	smart houses just aren't as common as they will be, so you can't just hit any random place.. you have to know specifically which ones
2016-10-28 21:35:25	alyptik	how often should i emerge --sync?
2016-10-28 21:35:34	alyptik	before every emerge like with pacman?
2016-10-28 21:35:39	minimalism	if you noticed the message that displays while doing it
2016-10-28 21:35:49	minimalism	gentoo has an etiquette that says no more than once a day
2016-10-28 21:35:56	alyptik	ah thank god
2016-10-28 21:35:57	minimalism	because it costs quite a bit in bandwidth
2016-10-28 21:36:00	alyptik	--sync takes forever
2016-10-28 21:36:09	minimalism	right, you can do git.. but like I said
2016-10-28 21:36:15	minimalism	not completely supported like rsync
2016-10-28 21:36:16	alyptik	i am usually scrolled too fast
2016-10-28 21:36:24	minimalism	you can sync an overlay separately though
2016-10-28 21:36:42	minimalism	emerge --sync overlayname
2016-10-28 21:36:47	alyptik	i dont actually know what overlays are 
2016-10-28 21:36:48	minimalism	like emerge --sync tox-overlay
2016-10-28 21:36:48	alyptik	lol
2016-10-28 21:36:56	minimalism	How'd you install tox on gentoo then?
2016-10-28 21:37:03	alyptik	it's not
2016-10-28 21:37:06	minimalism	oh
2016-10-28 21:37:09	minimalism	well you will learn then
2016-10-28 21:37:12	alyptik	ah ok
2016-10-28 21:37:15	minimalism	it's like PPAs on Ubuntu.. however
2016-10-28 21:37:20	minimalism	gentoo can officially support them or not
2016-10-28 21:37:27	minimalism	they're like separate repositories maintained by users or organizations
2016-10-28 21:37:54	minimalism	https://overlays.gentoo.org/
2016-10-28 21:38:21	minimalism	you'll notice the icons beside them
2016-10-28 21:38:25	minimalism	they mean official or unofficial
2016-10-28 21:38:47	minimalism	you can also create a personal local overlay
2016-10-28 21:38:50	minimalism	for your own ebuilds
2016-10-28 21:39:03	minimalism	or you can post them on github and make that an overlay, and let other people access it
2016-10-28 21:39:12	minimalism	not even github, any git host
2016-10-28 21:39:24	minimalism	fuck arch
2016-10-28 21:39:25	minimalism	srsly
2016-10-28 21:39:32	minimalism	binary signing bullshit
2016-10-28 21:39:32	alyptik	ah gotcha
2016-10-28 21:39:40	alyptik	lol
2016-10-28 21:45:00		[21:39]
2016-10-28 21:55:19	alyptik	time to see if gentoo boots

2016-10-28 22:16:47	minimalism	[07:21:34] probably [07:21:34]

2016-10-28 22:16:47	minimalism	[07:21:58] knowing is half the battle, so you can intentionally get dumb appliances [07:21:58]

2016-10-28 22:16:47	minimalism	[07:22:30] people like us on IRC who actually know how these things work can probably get a coffeemaker to kill its owner [07:22:30]
2016-10-28 22:16:47	minimalism	[07:24:54] I'd be very wary of IoT controlling machines with radiation like microwaves [07:24:54]
2016-10-28 22:16:47	minimalism	[07:25:38] well, you say that.. [07:25:38]
2016-10-28 22:16:47	minimalism	[07:25:57] but I don't think we could have predicted 10 years ago that idiots would integrate some ridiculous new thing called social media into a refrigerator [07:25:57]
2016-10-28 22:16:47	minimalism	[07:26:28] honestly, it's pretty dangerous in general controlling all these temperature controlled machines [07:26:28]
2016-10-28 22:16:47	minimalism	[07:26:30] imagine this [07:26:30]
2016-10-28 22:16:47	minimalism	[07:26:40] someone gains control of your oven [07:26:40]

2016-10-28 22:21:19	minimalism	oh it's not in a script

2016-10-28 22:29:34	minimalism	[07:39:24] fuck arch [07:39:24]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	minimalism	[07:39:25] srsly [07:39:25]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	minimalism	[07:39:32] binary signing bullshit [07:39:32]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	minimalism	[08:08:26] Did it work? [08:08:26]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	minimalism	[08:19:24] still trying to figure out how to mux this with shell scripting [08:19:24]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	minimalism	[08:19:42] not mkvtoolnix so much as just finding a way with shell scripting to avoid a seriously tedious one by one [08:19:42]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	minimalism	[08:20:21] I broke each dragon ball mkv into separate parts [08:20:21]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	minimalism	[08:20:26] a video file, two audio files, and an srt sub file [08:20:26]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	minimalism	[08:20:35] and instead of naming them by extension, I numbered them [08:20:35]

2016-10-28 22:29:34	minimalism	[08:20:46] well it's more about me learning shell scripting that is universally applicable [08:20:46]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	minimalism	[08:20:54] to expedite just about any tedious task of processing [08:20:54]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	minimalism	[08:21:10] My shell is zsh, but [08:21:10]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	minimalism	[08:21:15] I'm using pretty univerally compatible stuff [08:21:15]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	minimalism	[08:21:19] oh it's not in a script [08:21:19]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	minimalism	[08:21:25] I'm writing it all in the command line [08:21:25]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	minimalism	[08:21:44] imagine the following [08:21:44]

2016-10-28 22:29:34	minimalism	[08:24:14] _01 is video [08:24:14]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	minimalism	[08:24:17] _02 is audio 1 [08:24:17]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	minimalism	[08:24:20] _03 is audio 2 [08:24:20]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	minimalism	[08:24:24] _04 is subtitles [08:24:24]
2016-10-28 22:39:00	alyptik	oh woah
2016-10-28 22:39:04	alyptik	jrnl looks cool
2016-10-28 22:45:00		[22:39]
2016-10-28 23:48:21	minimalism	jrnl?
2016-10-28 23:48:21		[23:48]
2016-10-28 23:52:51	alyptik	minimalism some sort of new logging thing
2016-10-28 23:52:56	alyptik	why did i highlight you
2016-10-28 23:52:57	alyptik	haha
2016-10-28 23:53:13	alyptik	it was just a  dmenu plugin i saw
2016-10-28 23:59:00		[23:53]
2016-10-29 09:23:11	minimalism	breh
2016-10-29 09:23:11		[09:23]

2016-10-29 11:43:00		[11:37]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:28:38] like we did recently with our own normal computers [07:28:38]
2016-10-29 12:25:08		[12:25]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:28:43] to "harden" [07:28:43]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:28:46] appliances [07:28:46]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:28:53] when the solution to begin with was just not to put them online in the first place [07:28:53]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:30:12] well it's going to happen in California in 5 [07:30:12]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:30:24] and the next forest fires will be blamed on global warming when it was really some asshole's smart house [07:30:24]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:30:59] I think it's all crazy and insane, but on the other hand [07:30:59]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:31:13] if I am *really* good at understanding the unix-like systems these things run on [07:31:13]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:31:17] and can get away with it [07:31:17]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:31:35] I might just swing by places and flicker the lights and turn on music [07:31:35]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:32:11] turn an entire neighborhood into a rave [07:32:11]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:32:38] it's already happening now [07:32:38]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:33:02] smart houses just aren't as common as they will be, so you can't just hit any random place.. you have to know specifically which ones [07:33:02]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:35:39] if you noticed the message that displays while doing it [07:35:39]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:35:49] gentoo has an etiquette that says no more than once a day [07:35:49]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:35:57] because it costs quite a bit in bandwidth [07:35:57]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:36:09] right, you can do git.. but like I said [07:36:09]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:36:15] not completely supported like rsync [07:36:15]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:36:24] you can sync an overlay separately though [07:36:24]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:36:42] emerge --sync overlayname [07:36:42]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:36:48] like emerge --sync tox-overlay [07:36:48]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:36:56] How'd you install tox on gentoo then? [07:36:56]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:37:06] oh [07:37:06]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:37:09] well you will learn then [07:37:09]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:37:15] it's like PPAs on Ubuntu.. however [07:37:15]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:37:20] gentoo can officially support them or not [07:37:20]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:37:27] they're like separate repositories maintained by users or organizations [07:37:27]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:37:54] https://overlays.gentoo.org/ [07:37:54]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:38:21] you'll notice the icons beside them [07:38:21]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:38:25] they mean official or unofficial [07:38:25]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:38:47] you can also create a personal local overlay [07:38:47]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:38:50] for your own ebuilds [07:38:50]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	minimalism	[07:39:03] or you can post them on github and make that an overlay, and let other people access it [07:39:03]

2016-10-29 12:26:01	alyptik	oh sorry
2016-10-29 12:26:06	alyptik	half asleep here
2016-10-29 12:27:28	minimalism	I forgot what I was gonna ask
2016-10-29 12:27:37	minimalism	but it was about if you wanted to start trying to configure something on gentoo
2016-10-29 12:27:53	alyptik	i am recompiling kernel atm
2016-10-29 12:27:55	minimalism	might've been cron or logging
2016-10-29 12:27:55	alyptik	well shit was hah
2016-10-29 12:28:00	alyptik	i just crashed
2016-10-29 12:28:10	alyptik	i can prob be setting that up
2016-10-29 12:28:13	alyptik	your choice
2016-10-29 12:29:31	minimalism	which cron daemon did you choose
2016-10-29 12:30:49	alyptik	lemme see what there is
2016-10-29 12:30:53	alyptik	didn't think too much about it yet
2016-10-29 12:31:40	minimalism	I was thinking the typical cronie+chrony
2016-10-29 12:31:53	minimalism	it doesn't work the same way as I had it on debian servers though with just writing lines into crontab
2016-10-29 12:32:03	minimalism	apparently cronie is a bit different and doesn't follow anything from crontab
2016-10-29 12:32:10	minimalism	Kind of annoying tbh if true
2016-10-29 12:32:16	minimalism	I'd prefer all cron in one single directory
2016-10-29 12:32:19	minimalism	or file
2016-10-29 12:33:15	alyptik	hm
2016-10-29 12:33:24	alyptik	well i use cronie on my arch box
2016-10-29 12:33:36	minimalism	I'd be very interested to hear how you use it
2016-10-29 12:33:36	alyptik	not sure if it's one file since i use crontab -e
2016-10-29 12:33:45	alyptik	sec lemme check
2016-10-29 12:33:49	alyptik	dont actually remember ha
2016-10-29 12:33:54	minimalism	heh
2016-10-29 12:33:58	minimalism	well I love the idea of cron, a lot
2016-10-29 12:34:08	minimalism	it kicks the shit out of systemd, 100%
2016-10-29 12:34:22	alyptik	0 */1 * * *     DISPLAY=:0 /usr/bin/modprobed-db store >/dev/null 2>&1
2016-10-29 12:34:27	alyptik	why do i have DISPLAY 
2016-10-29 12:34:28	alyptik	wtf
2016-10-29 12:34:30	alyptik	lol
2016-10-29 12:34:56	alyptik	root is 0 */1 * * *     DISPLAY=:0.0 /usr/bin/updatedb >/dev/null 2>&1
2016-10-29 12:35:07	alyptik	also 0 */1 * * *     DISPLAY=:0.0 /srv/archive/mysql/db_backup.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
2016-10-29 12:35:21	alyptik	wtf was i thinking 
2016-10-29 12:35:27	alyptik	with those DISPLAY= lol
2016-10-29 12:35:36	minimalism	I've already forgotten the meaning of >/dev/null 2>&1
2016-10-29 12:35:46	alyptik	stdin and err to /dev/null
2016-10-29 12:36:10	alyptik	x>&y makes FD x a copy of FD y
2016-10-29 12:36:22	alyptik	so 1 goes to null, then 2 is copied there
2016-10-29 12:36:48	alyptik	not sure if cronie understand &>
2016-10-29 12:36:52	alyptik	figured better to be safe
2016-10-29 12:40:41	minimalism	ah right
2016-10-29 12:40:41		[12:40]
2016-10-29 12:40:45	minimalism	2 is error level right?
2016-10-29 12:40:58	minimalism	fuck I'm blanking
2016-10-29 12:41:45	alyptik	yup
2016-10-29 12:41:52	alyptik	0 is stdin, 1 stdout, 2 stderr
2016-10-29 12:41:57	alyptik	rest can vary
2016-10-29 12:41:58	minimalism	Can you explain the meaning of the >&1 though
2016-10-29 12:42:12	minimalism	I literally just read this maybe 2 weeks ago
2016-10-29 12:42:15	alyptik	> is always an alias for 1>
2016-10-29 12:42:16	minimalism	and I've already forgotten
2016-10-29 12:42:19	alyptik	< is for 0<
2016-10-29 12:42:34	alyptik	so >&1 is actually 1>'./&1'
2016-10-29 12:42:40	alyptik	not what you want heh
2016-10-29 12:43:07	alyptik	if it isn't a valid fd you will truncate a file]
2016-10-29 12:43:10	alyptik	so be careful
2016-10-29 12:43:21	minimalism	there's that one again.. "fd"
2016-10-29 12:43:25	alyptik	oh sorry
2016-10-29 12:43:29	minimalism	I only started using anything nix in January of 2015
2016-10-29 12:43:30	alyptik	file diescriptor
2016-10-29 12:43:33	minimalism	so I have some knowledge gaps
2016-10-29 12:43:36	alyptik	it's just a file really
2016-10-29 12:43:46	alyptik	a special one
2016-10-29 12:43:57	alyptik	FD 0 for example is a read only 
2016-10-29 12:44:04	minimalism	Do you happen to know the flag with find to find fd's?
2016-10-29 12:44:16	alyptik	most terminals work by redirecting input to there
2016-10-29 12:44:25	alyptik	shit i had an alias for that
2016-10-29 12:44:27	alyptik	sec
2016-10-29 12:44:42	alyptik	nm it is for ls
2016-10-29 12:44:42	minimalism	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor
2016-10-29 12:44:44	minimalism	this helps some
2016-10-29 12:44:45	alyptik	still useful though
2016-10-29 12:44:47	alyptik	ls -lAhqiQFs1 --color=auto /proc/$$/fd
2016-10-29 12:45:12	alyptik	shows current FDs and the dev node they go to
2016-10-29 12:45:32	alyptik	or file if you do like 3>/tmp/test
2016-10-29 12:48:18	minimalism	just tried it
2016-10-29 12:48:26	minimalism	pts/6 huh
2016-10-29 12:48:31	minimalism	is that strictly assigned to fd?
2016-10-29 12:48:38	alyptik	loginctl list-sessions
2016-10-29 12:48:48	minimalism	gentoo
2016-10-29 12:48:53	alyptik	oh sorry
2016-10-29 12:48:56	alyptik	hm not sure equiv
2016-10-29 12:49:03	alyptik	but PTS= pseudo terminal'
2016-10-29 12:49:05	minimalism	see, this is the appeal of gentoo
2016-10-29 12:49:20	minimalism	learn the actual commands instead of what's basically an alias like systemd's commands
2016-10-29 12:49:22	alyptik	just means what terminal device you are attached to
2016-10-29 12:49:26	alyptik	hah very true
2016-10-29 12:55:00		[12:49]
2016-10-29 12:55:35	alyptik	didn't have to shoot snot tho
2016-10-29 12:55:41	alyptik	dammit
2016-10-29 12:55:44	alyptik	was for aot
2016-10-29 13:01:00		[12:55]
2016-10-29 13:04:42	alyptik	my reference for redirections: https://ptpb.pw/FxEe.pdf
2016-10-29 13:04:59	alyptik	sorry about pdf, it was from a long time ago
2016-10-29 13:05:21	alyptik	oh i am dumb
2016-10-29 13:05:24	alyptik	link at the bottom: https://github.com/pkrumins/bash-redirections-cheat-sheet
2016-10-29 13:05:47	alyptik	http://www.catonmat.net/blog/bash-one-liners-explained-part-three/ is the tutorial itself
2016-10-29 13:05:53	alyptik	best one i've ever found
2016-10-29 13:11:00		[13:05]
2016-10-29 13:16:16	minimalism	ah sweet
2016-10-29 13:16:19	minimalism	I love image cheat sheets
2016-10-29 13:16:21	minimalism	I have some
2016-10-29 13:17:55	alyptik	https://ptpb.pw/o7iN/text
2016-10-29 13:18:03	alyptik	if you want a shorthand
2016-10-29 13:21:11	minimalism	I doubt these are of any use, but some cheatsheets I keep
2016-10-29 13:21:12	minimalism	https://imgur.com/a/Rq4Ob
2016-10-29 13:22:38	alyptik	lol good 'ol test
2016-10-29 13:23:14	alyptik	for those i just man bash for refreshers
2016-10-29 13:23:25	alyptik	bash man bage is the only good part of bash
2016-10-29 13:23:29	alyptik	s/bage/page/
2016-10-29 13:26:40	minimalism	I try not to refer to it as bash
2016-10-29 13:26:40		[13:26]
2016-10-29 13:26:48	minimalism	I always say shell because bash specific stuff is awful and annoying
2016-10-29 13:27:09	alyptik	not always
2016-10-29 13:27:18	alyptik	stuff like /dev/tcp is cool
2016-10-29 13:27:27	alyptik	the rest not so much though
2016-10-29 13:28:02	minimalism	bash is a problem for highest compatibility though
2016-10-29 13:28:20	alyptik	pretty much that actually; maybe shell parameter flags too like ${foo^^bar}
2016-10-29 13:28:50	alyptik	i use /bin/sh for everything, or zsh if desperate in scripts
2016-10-29 13:30:15	minimalism	I only use /bin/sh
2016-10-29 13:31:12	alyptik	stuff like associative arrays are cool in zsh
2016-10-29 13:31:28	alyptik	also the globbing
2016-10-29 13:31:32	alyptik	bass as hell
2016-10-29 13:31:36	alyptik	lol boss*
2016-10-29 13:31:39	minimalism	I like zsh for my shell of choice, but anything in /bin/ or /*bin
2016-10-29 13:31:48	minimalism	should be /bin/sh for max compat
2016-10-29 13:32:11	alyptik	like if you want to find derp dir somewhere in /home you go cd /home/**/derp/
2016-10-29 13:32:18	alyptik	cool stuff like that
2016-10-29 13:32:33	minimalism	I try to avoid some of zsh's easier routes
2016-10-29 13:32:35	minimalism	like not typing cd
2016-10-29 13:32:41	alyptik	yeah that is a bad habit
2016-10-29 13:32:42	minimalism	because cd should be your habit
2016-10-29 13:32:51	alyptik	well i pushd everything hah
2016-10-29 13:32:57	alyptik	it is reflex already
2016-10-29 13:33:03	minimalism	I have that aliased just for memory, but
2016-10-29 13:33:11	minimalism	I try to avoid using it except when I really need it for something
2016-10-29 13:33:22	alyptik	zsh i like shortcuts when they serve a purpose
2016-10-29 13:34:17	alyptik	cat /**/text.txt saves me having to construct some crazy find command
2016-10-29 13:34:27	alyptik	or recursive grep or something
2016-10-29 13:34:56	alyptik	ofc you should still know how though
2016-10-29 13:35:09	alyptik	if i don't know how to not use a shortcut i ignore it
2016-10-29 13:36:07	alyptik	also you should learn all the readline commands if you have spare time
2016-10-29 13:36:33	alyptik	lots of nice things like C+o and Esc+d
2016-10-29 13:40:31	alyptik	gonna eat dinner
2016-10-29 13:40:32	alyptik	brb
2016-10-29 18:39:21	minimalism	[01:53:28] I don't understand how these servers are running unattended update then and not rebooting [01:53:28]
2016-10-29 18:39:21		[18:39]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	minimalism	[01:59:44] does that mean I can stop compiling [01:59:44]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	minimalism	[01:59:55] thank god [01:59:55]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	minimalism	[02:00:25] make sure you keep multiple kernels and a rescue iso [02:00:25]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	minimalism	[02:00:28] to not repeat this [02:00:28]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	minimalism	[02:04:47] lol [02:04:47]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	minimalism	[02:07:51] adding -mtune appears to not mean anything to emerge @world [02:07:51]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	minimalism	[02:09:15] native [02:09:15]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	minimalism	[02:10:28] I just left it at native along with the original march native [02:10:28]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	minimalism	[02:10:30] makes no difference [02:10:30]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	minimalism	[02:10:46] I figured it would do nothing, since it returned the same stuff from gcc's information [02:10:46]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	minimalism	[02:10:52] they both set to sandybridge and all [02:10:52]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	minimalism	[02:12:14] yep [02:12:14]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	minimalism	[02:12:37] I'll leave both as native just for the sake of completion I guess [02:12:37]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	minimalism	[02:14:25] well dosfstools is only necessary to format [02:14:25]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	minimalism	[02:14:30] it's not required to boot efi [02:14:30]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	minimalism	[02:16:26] because it has to be available as a known fs during boot [02:16:26]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	minimalism	[02:16:29] it can't be a module [02:16:29]

2016-10-29 18:39:22	minimalism	[02:32:24] seems firefox's USE flags are troublesome [02:32:24]
2016-10-29 18:39:22	minimalism	[02:32:36] building firefox with your CFLAGS appears to be unsupported [02:32:36]
2016-10-29 18:39:22	minimalism	[03:13:12] found another USE to ban [03:13:12]
2016-10-29 18:39:22	minimalism	[03:27:53] found 2 more that can be banned just for fun [03:27:53]

2016-10-29 21:04:46	minimalism	and #gentoo doesn't seem concerned a bunch of packages has the msn USE flag

2016-10-29 23:10:16	minimalism	[02:32:24] seems firefox's USE flags are troublesome [02:32:24]
2016-10-29 23:10:16	minimalism	[02:32:36] building firefox with your CFLAGS appears to be unsupported [02:32:36]
2016-10-29 23:10:16	minimalism	[03:13:12] found another USE to ban [03:13:12]
2016-10-29 23:10:16	minimalism	[03:27:53] found 2 more that can be banned just for fun [03:27:53]
2016-10-29 23:10:16	minimalism	[03:27:56] -ios and -ipod [03:27:56]
2016-10-29 23:10:16	minimalism	[07:04:29] so many bannable USE flags [07:04:29]
2016-10-29 23:10:16	minimalism	[07:04:46] and #gentoo doesn't seem concerned a bunch of packages has the msn USE flag [07:04:46]
2016-10-29 23:10:16	minimalism	[07:04:51] something that hasn't existed in years [07:04:51]
2016-10-29 23:10:16	minimalism	[07:05:02] have the* [07:05:02]
2016-10-30 22:27:15	minimalism	not sure if should delve into curiosity about weak php sites..
2016-10-30 22:27:15		[22:27]
2016-10-30 22:32:58	alyptik	man idk if you wanna jump down that rabbit hole hah
2016-10-30 22:33:16	alyptik	webdev stuff is currently giving me an ulcer
2016-10-30 22:33:25	minimalism	yeah that's not what I meant lol
2016-10-30 22:33:30	alyptik	what do you mean then
2016-10-30 22:33:36	minimalism	a hat that is not white
2016-10-30 22:33:38	alyptik	like spoits?
2016-10-30 22:33:42	alyptik	sploits*
2016-10-30 22:33:44	alyptik	ah
2016-10-30 22:33:49	alyptik	that would be fun
2016-10-30 22:33:49	minimalism	well you know how most sites paywall something
2016-10-30 22:34:02	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-30 22:34:07	minimalism	with php from a bad developer, it's usually a very bad string system
2016-10-30 22:34:12	minimalism	with a query+token of sorts
2016-10-30 22:34:29	minimalism	and I'm curious if something like that could be foiled
2016-10-30 22:34:30	alyptik	how good is your php?
2016-10-30 22:34:38	minimalism	I don't know php at all really
2016-10-30 22:34:40	alyptik	i have no clue tbh 
2016-10-30 22:34:42	minimalism	I've only played with it here and there
2016-10-30 22:34:49	alyptik	php is pretty damn complicated
2016-10-30 22:34:52	alyptik	i suck at it
2016-10-30 22:34:52	minimalism	this is probably more about databases
2016-10-30 22:35:11	alyptik	should ask maybe jelle or smth
2016-10-30 22:35:18	minimalism	lol
2016-10-30 22:35:19	minimalism	nah
2016-10-30 22:35:50	alyptik	i wish you luck https://www.exploit-db.com/webapps/
2016-10-30 22:41:00		[22:35]
2016-10-30 22:41:57	minimalism	what I really wonder about
2016-10-30 22:42:09	minimalism	is if there's some very swift method to reach your hand in the cookie jar and bail without anyone ever knowing really
2016-10-30 22:43:40	minimalism	I imagine peopled o
2016-10-30 22:43:42	minimalism	do*
2016-10-30 22:43:47	minimalism	we just don't hear about it
2016-10-30 22:57:00		[22:51]
2016-10-30 23:00:01	minimalism	I'm thinking of permanently switching to vimb from mainline browsers
2016-10-30 23:00:26	alyptik	hm looks cool
2016-10-30 23:00:32	alyptik	lemme see what it's like
2016-10-30 23:00:35	minimalism	yeah
2016-10-30 23:00:40	minimalism	you know who really made me think about this
2016-10-30 23:00:54	minimalism	hackerhercules told me that when we worry about addons not being present for browsers
2016-10-30 23:01:02	minimalism	it's almost entirely addons to correct bad default behavior
2016-10-30 23:01:04	minimalism	and it's true
2016-10-30 23:01:12	minimalism	almost everything in my chromium addons is behavior correction
2016-10-30 23:01:21	minimalism	none of those things are even issues in alt browsers really
2016-10-30 23:01:33	minimalism	it has a rewrite for https if available which eliminates the need for https everywhere it seems
2016-10-30 23:01:33	alyptik	bleh
2016-10-30 23:01:39	alyptik	i already don't like it
2016-10-30 23:01:40	minimalism	and privoxy might do the job instead of ublock
2016-10-30 23:01:45	minimalism	what's the problem?
2016-10-30 23:01:55	alyptik	doesnt have stuff like ^T to go back like :help in vim
2016-10-30 23:02:30	alyptik	i don't feel like learning more  arbitrary shortcuts for a single use program
2016-10-30 23:02:39	alyptik	tbh you could just use vim as a browser i think
2016-10-30 23:02:49	alyptik	prob a plugin for that
2016-10-30 23:03:04	minimalism	you could try dwb
2016-10-30 23:03:07	minimalism	development resumed on it
2016-10-30 23:03:24	alyptik	lets give this a shot
2016-10-30 23:05:02	alyptik	this looks useable
2016-10-30 23:05:06	alyptik	easy to customize too
2016-10-30 23:06:17	minimalism	no ebuild on gentoo afaik
2016-10-30 23:06:20	minimalism	I want to try it again
2016-10-30 23:17:00		[23:11]
2016-10-30 23:28:24	minimalism	I'm thinking I should find a cron expert around here
2016-10-30 23:28:30	minimalism	that can really get down to it about pros/cons of them
2016-10-30 23:28:41	minimalism	and what can be done about the cron.*/ dirs since they belong to cronbase
2016-10-30 23:32:39	alyptik	good idea
2016-10-30 23:32:39		[23:32]
2016-10-30 23:32:47	alyptik	not a lot of people use it in arch
2016-10-30 23:34:18	minimalism	my deb server that I've run cronjobs on before is using plain cron
2016-10-30 23:34:30	minimalism	but it still has those cron.*/ dirs despite only needing crontab
2016-10-30 23:37:34	alyptik	i think those are a leftover from original plain cron
2016-10-30 23:37:47	alyptik	it's how it sorted jobs, idk why though
2016-10-30 23:40:04	minimalism	well they're part of cronbase, which is just the files I believe
2016-10-30 23:40:09	minimalism	plain cron is a separate package called cron
2016-10-30 23:40:55	alyptik	ah
2016-10-30 23:43:03	minimalism	testing a cron job now solely with cronbase in crontab
2016-10-30 23:43:07	minimalism	doubt it does anything
2016-10-30 23:43:10	minimalism	probably just files
2016-10-30 23:43:43	alyptik	my embedded has a cron init.d
2016-10-30 23:43:48	alyptik	you can code?
2016-10-30 23:43:55	alyptik	s/can/want
2016-10-30 23:43:55	minimalism	not really
2016-10-30 23:44:06	minimalism	wait, your embedded?
2016-10-30 23:44:10	alyptik	my router
2016-10-30 23:44:15	alyptik	with opkg it uses init.d
2016-10-30 23:44:30	alyptik	you want the source of that file?
2016-10-30 23:44:45	minimalism	well I'll know in a minute if crontab can do anything on its own (pretty sure it can't)
2016-10-30 23:44:59	alyptik	i don't think so
2016-10-30 23:45:03	alyptik	i am curious too
2016-10-30 23:45:14	minimalism	I know /usr/bin/crontab to edit is a separate file, however
2016-10-30 23:45:25	minimalism	I don't know if cronbase on its own possesses anything that enables execution
2016-10-30 23:45:36	minimalism	wait
2016-10-30 23:45:38	minimalism	yes it does
2016-10-30 23:45:51	minimalism	incoming paste

2016-10-30 23:46:41	minimalism	LOL WOW
2016-10-30 23:46:41	alyptik	wat
2016-10-30 23:46:43	minimalism	IT WORKED
2016-10-30 23:46:46	alyptik	wat da fuq

2016-10-30 23:47:06	minimalism	and there it is
2016-10-30 23:47:08	minimalism	the file exists now
2016-10-30 23:47:47	minimalism	cronbase has no USE flags.. now I have to wonder
2016-10-30 23:47:47		[23:47]
2016-10-30 23:47:53	minimalism	cronie had anacron USE flag
2016-10-30 23:48:15	minimalism	I wonder if this can do cron jobs on a recurring basis as specified like syncing chrony
2016-10-30 23:48:26	alyptik	lold
2016-10-30 23:48:52	minimalism	just for additional proof this works
2016-10-30 23:48:54	minimalism	 $ eix-installed | grep cron

2016-10-30 23:48:59	minimalism	literally all that's installed *cron*
2016-10-30 23:49:17	alyptik	i dont understand
2016-10-30 23:49:20	alyptik	thats cool haha
2016-10-30 23:49:29	minimalism	well cronbase possesses /etc/crontab
2016-10-30 23:49:34	minimalism	but not crontab edit like the /usr/bin/crontab
2016-10-30 23:49:43	minimalism	and it also possesses /etc/cron.*/ dirs
2016-10-30 23:49:57	minimalism	and the only executable it has it /usr/sbin/run-crons
2016-10-30 23:50:03	minimalism	it has is*
2016-10-30 23:50:05	minimalism	which does the deed
2016-10-30 23:50:41	minimalism	do you have access to a gentoo machine?
2016-10-30 23:54:58	alyptik	atm i have a chroot
2016-10-30 23:55:58	minimalism	try running a cron job with just cronbase installed
2016-10-30 23:56:11	minimalism	looking up gentoo wiki articles and just asked a question in #gentoo
2016-10-30 23:57:53	alyptik	sec
2016-10-30 23:59:16	minimalism	k just confirmed chronyd was already working
2016-10-30 23:59:26	minimalism	I forcefully set time to June 23rd 10 AM 1988
2016-10-30 23:59:33	minimalism	and then I started the chronyd service again
2016-10-30 23:59:37	minimalism	it sync'd it up
2016-10-30 23:59:41	minimalism	chrony is totally separate
2016-10-30 23:59:47	minimalism	has its own daemon
2016-10-31 00:03:15	alyptik	yeah works for me too

2016-10-31 00:23:18	minimalism	[09:48:15] I wonder if this can do cron jobs on a recurring basis as specified like syncing chrony [09:48:15]
2016-10-31 00:23:18	minimalism	[09:48:52] just for additional proof this works [09:48:52]
2016-10-31 00:23:18	minimalism	[09:48:54]  $ eix-installed | grep cron [09:48:54]
2016-10-31 00:23:18	minimalism	[09:48:57] sys-process/cronbase-0.3.7-r5 [09:48:57]
2016-10-31 00:23:18	minimalism	[09:48:59] literally all that's installed *cron* [09:48:59]
2016-10-31 00:23:18	minimalism	[09:49:29] well cronbase possesses /etc/crontab [09:49:29]
2016-10-31 00:23:18	minimalism	[09:49:34] but not crontab edit like the /usr/bin/crontab [09:49:34]
2016-10-31 00:23:18	minimalism	[09:49:43] and it also possesses /etc/cron.*/ dirs [09:49:43]
2016-10-31 00:23:18	minimalism	[09:49:57] and the only executable it has it /usr/sbin/run-crons [09:49:57]
2016-10-31 00:23:18	minimalism	[09:50:03] it has is* [09:50:03]
2016-10-31 00:23:18	minimalism	[09:50:05] which does the deed [09:50:05]
2016-10-31 00:23:18	minimalism	[09:50:41] do you have access to a gentoo machine? [09:50:41]
2016-10-31 00:23:18	minimalism	[09:55:58] try running a cron job with just cronbase installed [09:55:58]
2016-10-31 00:23:18	minimalism	[09:56:11] looking up gentoo wiki articles and just asked a question in #gentoo [09:56:11]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[09:59:16] k just confirmed chronyd was already working [09:59:16]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[09:59:26] I forcefully set time to June 23rd 10 AM 1988 [09:59:26]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[09:59:33] and then I started the chronyd service again [09:59:33]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[09:59:37] it sync'd it up [09:59:37]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[09:59:41] chrony is totally separate [09:59:41]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[09:59:47] has its own daemon [09:59:47]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[10:08:38] trying to also figure out the deal with hw/system/local time etc. [10:08:38]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[10:08:57] chrony on wiki mentions specifying a hwclockfile to /etc/adjtime [10:08:57]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[10:09:06] which is generated by typing # hwclock --systohc like even arch guide mentioned [10:09:06]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[10:09:13] but hw is supposed to be UTC timezone or something [10:09:13]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[10:09:18] while local should be your actual zone [10:09:18]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[10:09:23] hw appears to be local right now [10:09:23]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[10:09:28] unless it'll set to UTC upon reboot [10:09:28]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[10:15:15] waiting to see if cronbase can run this command to open a new urxvt terminal every minute now [10:15:15]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[10:15:23] might take 10 minutes though because there's another job in here [10:15:23]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[10:15:31] every 10 minutes it says it runs [10:15:31]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[10:15:44] test -x /usr/sbin/run-crons && /usr/sbin/run-crons [10:15:44]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[10:16:31] you what the irony is here after reading what's in this crontab [10:16:31]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[10:16:37] I could use cronbase to destroy itself [10:16:37]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[10:16:52] 59  * * * * root rm -f /var/spool/cron/lastrun/cron.hourly [10:16:52]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[10:17:03] I could set it remove itself in /etc/ with all those cron.*/ dirs [10:17:03]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[10:17:06] except crontab file [10:17:06]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[10:18:05] I don't think anyone in gentoo answered my cron question [10:18:05]
2016-10-31 00:23:19	minimalism	[10:20:28] I wonder if crontab can interpret vars [10:20:28]
2016-10-31 00:23:47	alyptik	i don't think so
2016-10-31 00:24:01	alyptik	it can test though
2016-10-31 00:27:59	minimalism	it doesn't appear to be understanding the new cron job
2016-10-31 00:30:26	minimalism	definitely not understanding every n minutes crons
2016-10-31 00:30:28	minimalism	like */2
2016-10-31 00:30:41	alyptik	it's weird
2016-10-31 00:30:48	alyptik	idk how it works at all tbh
2016-10-31 00:31:07	minimalism	yeah, cron seems really schizo picking and choosing
2016-10-31 00:31:12	alyptik	i never go under an hour
2016-10-31 00:31:16	minimalism	I don't know the difference between all the cron daemons either
2016-10-31 00:31:24	minimalism	this is probably why systemd got away with shit
2016-10-31 00:31:30	alyptik	lol
2016-10-31 00:31:31	minimalism	the cron standard wasn't clearly defined or something
2016-10-31 00:31:43	alyptik	fcron is a different format too
2016-10-31 00:31:52	alyptik	it is a combo of anacron and cronie afaik
2016-10-31 00:31:52	minimalism	cronie supposedly doesn't even use crontab
2016-10-31 00:31:57	minimalism	it's suggested to comment it out
2016-10-31 00:32:01	alyptik	lol
2016-10-31 00:33:29	minimalism	okay, I think I know what it is
2016-10-31 00:33:36	minimalism	it doesn't seem to want to obey my normal user
2016-10-31 00:33:46	minimalism	it shouldn't need root access of any kind to execute this command though
2016-10-31 00:34:15	alyptik	odd
2016-10-31 00:39:16	minimalism	FAILED to authorize user with PAM (Authentication failure)
2016-10-31 00:39:16		[00:39]
2016-10-31 00:39:18	minimalism	hm
2016-10-31 00:39:26	minimalism	apparently it can't use my normal user, but it can use root
2016-10-31 00:39:38	alyptik	maybe you need to be in cron group
2016-10-31 00:39:43	minimalism	I am
2016-10-31 00:39:45	alyptik	weird
2016-10-31 00:39:46	minimalism	that's why this is so puzzling
2016-10-31 00:40:04	alyptik	is PAM setup?
2016-10-31 00:40:15	minimalism	In what fashion?
2016-10-31 00:40:23	alyptik	not sure if cron needs a pam config
2016-10-31 00:40:34	alyptik	i had to do it a few times in arch not for cron but other things
2016-10-31 00:46:00		[00:40]
2016-10-31 00:48:09	minimalism	now I see
2016-10-31 00:48:24	minimalism	read an article and did some equery/e-file stuff to see what was included with certain packages
2016-10-31 00:48:32	minimalism	if you used cronbase alone.. supposedly
2016-10-31 00:48:43	minimalism	you could write a cron.allow file with one user per line to permit other than root
2016-10-31 00:48:48	minimalism	and then you'd have to write a PAM policy
2016-10-31 00:48:58	minimalism	and modify /etc/security/access.conf
2016-10-31 00:50:05	minimalism	you know what really pisses me off about arch though
2016-10-31 00:50:13	minimalism	its permission leniency on commands like poweroff/shutdown
2016-10-31 00:51:11	minimalism	also cron cannot read vars
2016-10-31 00:51:15	minimalism	it'll just be interpreted as blank
2016-10-31 00:51:33	alyptik	oo
2016-10-31 00:51:44	minimalism	I wrote $HISTSIZE.txt
2016-10-31 00:51:49	minimalism	created a file called ".txt"
2016-10-31 00:51:54	alyptik	i am redoing kernel config atm apparently you can live patch kernels now
2016-10-31 00:52:02	minimalism	interesting
2016-10-31 00:52:14	alyptik	try HISTSIZE='test'
2016-10-31 00:52:21	alyptik	above the job
2016-10-31 00:52:24	alyptik	see if it works
2016-10-31 00:52:30	minimalism	that is interesting..
2016-10-31 00:52:42	minimalism	the env variable wouldn't be set now that I think about it for HISTSIZE really
2016-10-31 00:52:44	minimalism	at least for the cron user
2016-10-31 00:52:55	minimalism	you're right
2016-10-31 00:52:56	alyptik	from nconfig
2016-10-31 00:52:57	minimalism	it did interpret it

2016-10-31 00:53:17	alyptik	but you can set vars
2016-10-31 00:53:38	minimalism	well let's see
2016-10-31 00:53:41	minimalism	gonna test it
2016-10-31 00:59:00		[00:53]
2016-10-31 01:00:07	minimalism	it does interpret
2016-10-31 01:00:15	minimalism	I was trying with $SHELL only to realize just now why it wasn't working
2016-10-31 01:00:20	minimalism	it has slashes in the value lol
2016-10-31 01:00:52	alyptik	oh what
2016-10-31 01:00:54	alyptik	weird

2016-10-31 01:31:12	minimalism	[10:48:58] and modify /etc/security/access.conf [10:48:58]
2016-10-31 01:31:12	minimalism	[10:50:05] you know what really pisses me off about arch though [10:50:05]
2016-10-31 01:31:12	minimalism	[10:50:13] its permission leniency on commands like poweroff/shutdown [10:50:13]
2016-10-31 01:31:12	minimalism	[10:51:11] also cron cannot read vars [10:51:11]
2016-10-31 01:31:12	minimalism	[10:51:15] it'll just be interpreted as blank [10:51:15]
2016-10-31 01:31:12	minimalism	[10:51:44] I wrote $HISTSIZE.txt [10:51:44]
2016-10-31 01:31:12	minimalism	[10:51:49] created a file called ".txt" [10:51:49]
2016-10-31 01:31:12	minimalism	[10:52:02] interesting [10:52:02]
2016-10-31 01:31:12	minimalism	[10:52:30] that is interesting.. [10:52:30]
2016-10-31 01:31:12	minimalism	[10:52:42] the env variable wouldn't be set now that I think about it for HISTSIZE really [10:52:42]
2016-10-31 01:31:12	minimalism	[10:52:44] at least for the cron user [10:52:44]
2016-10-31 01:31:12	minimalism	[10:52:55] you're right [10:52:55]
2016-10-31 01:31:12	minimalism	[10:52:57] it did interpret it [10:52:57]
2016-10-31 01:31:12	minimalism	[10:53:02] otherwise it would have taken it literally [10:53:02]
2016-10-31 01:31:12	minimalism	[10:53:38] well let's see [10:53:38]
2016-10-31 01:31:12	minimalism	[10:53:41] gonna test it [10:53:41]
2016-10-31 01:31:12	minimalism	[11:00:07] it does interpret [11:00:07]
2016-10-31 01:31:12	minimalism	[11:00:15] I was trying with $SHELL only to realize just now why it wasn't working [11:00:15]
2016-10-31 01:31:12	minimalism	[11:00:20] it has slashes in the value lol [11:00:20]
2016-10-31 01:37:00		[01:31]
2016-10-31 03:00:22	minimalism	apparently dcron, cronie, and vixie-cron are popular
2016-10-31 03:00:22		[03:00]
2016-10-31 03:05:09	minimalism	perfect
2016-10-31 03:05:17	minimalism	cronie works and recognizes my users properly, vars are interpreted
2016-10-31 03:05:24	minimalism	things are good unless I feel like using dcron instead of cronie
2016-10-31 03:11:00		[03:05]
2016-10-31 04:25:28	alyptik	what is dcron like?
2016-10-31 04:25:28		[04:25]
2016-10-31 04:25:36	alyptik	also never heard of vixie cron
2016-10-31 04:25:48	minimalism	apparently it's.. well these crons
2016-10-31 04:25:58	minimalism	are pretty philosophy based and all mixed in functionality and syntax
2016-10-31 04:26:12	alyptik	oh this page isn't bad
2016-10-31 04:26:13	alyptik	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Cron
2016-10-31 04:26:19	minimalism	I can't get a good handle on how they are since no one wants to explain
2016-10-31 04:26:24	alyptik	@hourly         ID=greatest_ever_job      echo This job is very useful.
2016-10-31 04:26:36	alyptik	dcron is ez mode it looks like
2016-10-31 04:27:06	alyptik	Like anacron, fcron assumes the computer is not always running and, unlike anacron, it can schedule events at intervals shorter than a single day which may be useful for systems which suspend/hibernate regularly (such as a laptop). Like cronwhip, fcron can run jobs that should have been run during the computer's downtime.
2016-10-31 04:27:12	minimalism	for the record
2016-10-31 04:27:17	minimalism	fcron is kind of blot size wise
2016-10-31 04:27:21	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-31 04:27:24	minimalism	dcron is pretty minimal and someone just recommended it
2016-10-31 04:27:28	alyptik	it depends if you need async jobs
2016-10-31 04:27:31	minimalism	cronie and dcron seem like the best options
2016-10-31 04:27:45	alyptik	is something wrong with anacron? 
2016-10-31 04:27:51	alyptik	i always like cronie personally
2016-10-31 04:27:56	minimalism	anacron is supposedly more of a functional dependency
2016-10-31 04:28:03	minimalism	and some crons include anacron-like functionality
2016-10-31 04:28:10	minimalism	cronie included
2016-10-31 04:28:13	minimalism	has an anacron USE
2016-10-31 04:28:19	alyptik	oo
2016-10-31 04:28:27	alyptik	oh i remember what i was gonna ask
2016-10-31 04:28:38	alyptik	is there xf86-video-intel
2016-10-31 04:28:43	alyptik	or something similir?
2016-10-31 04:28:49	minimalism	how gentoo works is
2016-10-31 04:28:58	minimalism	your make.conf determines what driver packages to install
2016-10-31 04:29:17	alyptik	it determines ./configure basically
2016-10-31 04:29:17	minimalism	like I wrote my VIDEO_CARDS=""
2016-10-31 04:29:18	alyptik	right
2016-10-31 04:29:19	minimalism	as
2016-10-31 04:29:25	minimalism	VIDEO_CARDS="radeon radeonsi"
2016-10-31 04:29:40	alyptik	wait what, i dont even have that in there
2016-10-31 04:29:45	minimalism	and that prompted the installation of
2016-10-31 04:29:47	alyptik	should i look for portage or intel wiki in gento 
2016-10-31 04:29:57	minimalism	x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati
2016-10-31 04:30:02	minimalism	that was installed auto based on that setting
2016-10-31 04:30:21	alyptik	where did you read that though, the portage page on gentoo?
2016-10-31 04:30:23	minimalism	which is how it should be
2016-10-31 04:30:28	minimalism	it was somewhere
2016-10-31 04:31:13	minimalism	I can't seem to paste from firefox
2016-10-31 04:31:15	minimalism	annoying
2016-10-31 04:31:24	minimalism	https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/make.conf
2016-10-31 04:31:25	minimalism	there we go
2016-10-31 04:31:43	minimalism	like I said
2016-10-31 04:31:48	minimalism	this is how it should be, because
2016-10-31 04:31:54	minimalism	if you backup your core configs
2016-10-31 04:31:59	minimalism	and want to rebuild gentoo on another computer
2016-10-31 04:32:08	minimalism	it should just pull in the package you need for video based on the make.conf
2016-10-31 04:32:13	minimalism	and not be an explicitly listed package
2016-10-31 04:32:20	alyptik	oh thats why 
2016-10-31 04:32:26	alyptik	the page is only on x86
2016-10-31 04:32:31	alyptik	does it still apply?
2016-10-31 04:32:37	alyptik	https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:X86/Portage/Variables
2016-10-31 04:32:48	minimalism	I don't know
2016-10-31 04:32:54	minimalism	I just read amd64 handbook and the wiki
2016-10-31 04:32:59	minimalism	but x86 is technically a separate profile
2016-10-31 04:33:22	alyptik	gah it annoying compiling kernels and not being able to do anything
2016-10-31 04:33:24	alyptik	lol
2016-10-31 04:34:11	alyptik	should be done soon hopefully
2016-10-31 04:34:38	alyptik	it's so much easier to learn by doing bleh
2016-10-31 04:35:02	minimalism	You need to set L10N if you haven't
2016-10-31 04:35:22	minimalism	set it to L10N=""
2016-10-31 04:35:31	minimalism	prevents useless installations of languages and what not
2016-10-31 04:35:39	minimalism	and set LINGUAS="en"
2016-10-31 04:35:51	alyptik	this is all in make?
2016-10-31 04:35:55	minimalism	correct
2016-10-31 04:35:59	alyptik	this seem like .profile things
2016-10-31 04:36:00	alyptik	weird
2016-10-31 04:36:01	minimalism	it's covered on that wiki page I linked
2016-10-31 04:36:12	alyptik	oh didn't see that
2016-10-31 04:36:14	alyptik	looking now
2016-10-31 04:36:39	alyptik	yeah this is way diff
2016-10-31 04:36:44	alyptik	than the x86
2016-10-31 04:37:10	alyptik	damn
2016-10-31 04:37:16	alyptik	i have a lot of rebuilding to do
2016-10-31 04:38:48	minimalism	reminds me I needed to change my GENTOO_MIRRORS setting
2016-10-31 04:38:56	minimalism	I had it set to the default round robin distfiles.gentoo.org still
2016-10-31 04:39:04	minimalism	just explicitly set it to the ipv4 only gentoo.osuosl.org
2016-10-31 04:39:49	alyptik	oh hey it finished
2016-10-31 04:39:49	minimalism	breaks my balls that none of these are SSL
2016-10-31 04:39:55	alyptik	your ipv6 is spotty?
2016-10-31 04:40:04	minimalism	I don't have ipv6 and I don't want to use it
2016-10-31 04:40:09	alyptik	ah
2016-10-31 04:40:14	minimalism	I disable it in everything, and I disabled it in the kernel
2016-10-31 04:40:18	alyptik	yeah if you dont have native from isp it is useless
2016-10-31 04:40:23	alyptik	tunnels are stup[id
2016-10-31 04:40:26	minimalism	it's somewhat pointless too
2016-10-31 04:40:32	minimalism	it's really just a third world fix
2016-10-31 04:40:32		[04:40]
2016-10-31 04:40:36	minimalism	our continent has all the ipv4
2016-10-31 04:40:42	minimalism	that's literally the only reason why it exists
2016-10-31 04:40:50	alyptik	i like having a ton of public ips personally
2016-10-31 04:40:56	alyptik	but you have no use for stuff like that
2016-10-31 04:41:43	alyptik	i don't think you care about running a webserver or similar at all
2016-10-31 04:41:52	alyptik	sorta opposite i bet lol
2016-10-31 04:41:53	minimalism	I run one on a cloud service
2016-10-31 04:42:02	alyptik	yeah offsite
2016-10-31 04:42:04	minimalism	I am supporting ipv6 there, or at least I will
2016-10-31 04:42:07	minimalism	within the next 2 months
2016-10-31 04:42:30	minimalism	I'm saying there's no reason to care about having an ipv6 in the first world
2016-10-31 04:42:45	minimalism	its only use is to support it for websites with international traffic
2016-10-31 04:42:52	alyptik	well there is now but only because of how stupid we are using it
2016-10-31 04:42:58	alyptik	like you said our continent hogs it
2016-10-31 04:43:37	minimalism	well think about this
2016-10-31 04:43:43	minimalism	ipv4 will be our spam filter against the third world
2016-10-31 04:44:01	minimalism	if you don't want to deal with Chinese and Indian spam, gg
2016-10-31 04:44:04	minimalism	just no ipv6
2016-10-31 04:44:29	alyptik	well it makes sense in theory but all my ipv6 traffic like scans and such are from US
2016-10-31 04:44:38	minimalism	right now, yes
2016-10-31 04:44:42	alyptik	the hackers in third world all bounce through vpns
2016-10-31 04:44:44	minimalism	but it's going to be used as a third world fix
2016-10-31 04:44:44	alyptik	and tor and stuff
2016-10-31 04:44:51	minimalism	I'm not worried about real hackers
2016-10-31 04:44:55	alyptik	oh
2016-10-31 04:44:58	minimalism	I'm worried about scrubs phoning to say your windows is fucked
2016-10-31 04:45:00	alyptik	what do you mean
2016-10-31 04:45:03	alyptik	hah
2016-10-31 04:45:14	alyptik	that it true in that case
2016-10-31 04:45:17	alyptik	very much so]
2016-10-31 04:45:39	minimalism	I really wish India didn't have internet
2016-10-31 04:46:02	minimalism	I've seen enough of their terrible php/javascript abortions and general occupation of any hiring site
2016-10-31 04:46:07	minimalism	where they lie about their qualifications
2016-10-31 04:46:23	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-31 04:49:02	minimalism	their wordpress sites and terrible comments in "english"
2016-10-31 04:49:06	minimalism	that place.. 
2016-10-31 04:49:10	alyptik	hm
2016-10-31 04:49:13	minimalism	I really hate India
2016-10-31 04:49:22	alyptik	what if i copy my src dir over
2016-10-31 04:49:29	alyptik	then once in gentoo make module_install
2016-10-31 04:49:35	alyptik	you think that'd work?
2016-10-31 04:49:41	minimalism	src dir from what
2016-10-31 04:49:45	alyptik	my kernel i compiled
2016-10-31 04:49:53	alyptik	so i can make modules for gentoo
2016-10-31 04:50:06	alyptik	dont want to compile hwile kernel again
2016-10-31 04:50:13	alyptik	s/hwlle/whole
2016-10-31 04:50:23	minimalism	what kind of machine is being used for this anyway
2016-10-31 04:50:25	minimalism	how weak is it
2016-10-31 04:50:42	alyptik	sec lemme lscpu for you
2016-10-31 04:51:00	minimalism	you should just install screenfetch
2016-10-31 04:51:01	alyptik	Vendor ID:             GenuineIntel
2016-10-31 04:51:01	alyptik	CPU family:            6
2016-10-31 04:51:01	alyptik	Model:                 69
2016-10-31 04:51:01	alyptik	Model name:            Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4300U CPU @ 1.90GHz
2016-10-31 04:51:05	alyptik	i have it
2016-10-31 04:51:14	alyptik	always forgot to use though hah
2016-10-31 04:51:32	alyptik	microsoft surface pro 3
2016-10-31 04:51:36	minimalism	I use it all the time as a quick look at RAM and packages installed/uptime
2016-10-31 04:51:42	alyptik	ah
2016-10-31 04:51:56	alyptik	i just use my screen hardstatus for that hah
2016-10-31 04:52:11	minimalism	my status bar has uptime and RAM %
2016-10-31 04:52:16	alyptik	oo i should make a script to looks at uptime
2016-10-31 04:52:17	minimalism	but screenfetch I find easiest for checking packages installed
2016-10-31 04:52:22	alyptik	i don't have that one
2016-10-31 04:52:42	alyptik	i guess awk on screentfetch is easier way
2016-10-31 04:52:52	minimalism	uptime='uptime -p | cut -c 4-'
2016-10-31 04:53:00	alyptik	oh there we go
2016-10-31 04:53:06	minimalism	I use this in my tmux status bar as well
2016-10-31 04:53:17	alyptik	i need to use cut/paste more
2016-10-31 04:53:37	minimalism	I don't use it much at all
2016-10-31 04:53:47	minimalism	in fact, this was taken from somewhere else, and I've only used cut one time since
2016-10-31 04:54:00	minimalism	I forget how to use it each time because I use it so infrequently
2016-10-31 04:54:10	alyptik	hah me too
2016-10-31 04:54:17	alyptik	they are powerful commands
2016-10-31 04:54:20	alyptik	paste esp
2016-10-31 04:57:27	minimalism	I'm thinking about checking if there's a way I can ban entire portage categories
2016-10-31 04:57:27		[04:57]
2016-10-31 04:57:29	minimalism	from syncing
2016-10-31 04:57:35	minimalism	like kde-*/*
2016-10-31 04:57:39	minimalism	or gnome-*/*
2016-10-31 04:57:42	alyptik	heh
2016-10-31 04:57:50	alyptik	that would be a nice thing to have
2016-10-31 04:58:03	minimalism	if you really don't use anything in certain categories
2016-10-31 04:58:10	minimalism	you could ban a lot, and maybe trim portage tree down 200 MiB
2016-10-31 05:04:00		[04:58]
2016-10-31 11:08:36	minimalism	Just noticed a cool feature I forgot
2016-10-31 11:08:36		[11:08]
2016-10-31 12:10:01	minimalism	fuck this is annoying
2016-10-31 12:10:01		[12:10]
2016-10-31 12:10:07	minimalism	there isn't even a man entry for dcron
2016-10-31 12:16:00		[12:10]
2016-10-31 13:21:52	alyptik	i hate that too
2016-10-31 13:21:52		[13:21]
2016-10-31 13:21:54	alyptik	try info maybe
2016-10-31 13:27:00		[13:21]
2016-10-31 13:41:42	--	irc: disconnected from server
2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:38:56] I had it set to the default round robin distfiles.gentoo.org still [14:38:56]

2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:40:04] I don't have ipv6 and I don't want to use it [14:40:04]
2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:40:14] I disable it in everything, and I disabled it in the kernel [14:40:14]
2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:40:26] it's somewhat pointless too [14:40:26]
2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:40:32] it's really just a third world fix [14:40:32]
2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:40:36] our continent has all the ipv4 [14:40:36]
2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:40:42] that's literally the only reason why it exists [14:40:42]
2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:41:53] I run one on a cloud service [14:41:53]
2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:42:04] I am supporting ipv6 there, or at least I will [14:42:04]
2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:42:07] within the next 2 months [14:42:07]
2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:42:30] I'm saying there's no reason to care about having an ipv6 in the first world [14:42:30]
2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:42:45] its only use is to support it for websites with international traffic [14:42:45]
2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:43:37] well think about this [14:43:37]
2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:43:43] ipv4 will be our spam filter against the third world [14:43:43]

2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:44:04] just no ipv6 [14:44:04]
2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:44:38] right now, yes [14:44:38]
2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:44:44] but it's going to be used as a third world fix [14:44:44]
2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:44:51] I'm not worried about real hackers [14:44:51]

2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:51:00] you should just install screenfetch [14:51:00]
2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:51:36] I use it all the time as a quick look at RAM and packages installed/uptime [14:51:36]

2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:52:17] but screenfetch I find easiest for checking packages installed [14:52:17]

2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:53:47] in fact, this was taken from somewhere else, and I've only used cut one time since [14:53:47]

2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:57:27] I'm thinking about checking if there's a way I can ban entire portage categories [14:57:27]

2016-10-31 13:42:05	minimalism	[14:58:10] you could ban a lot, and maybe trim portage tree down 200 MiB [14:58:10]

2016-10-31 16:27:00		[16:21]
2016-11-01 04:53:58	minimalism	I just found some interesting information on Gentoo's history
2016-11-01 04:53:58		[04:53]
2016-11-01 11:42:03	alyptik	what did you find?
2016-11-01 11:42:03		[11:42]
2016-11-01 11:42:14	minimalism	the origin of the names
2016-11-01 11:42:18	minimalism	Enoch and Gentoo
2016-11-01 11:43:04	alyptik	someonsaid gentoo is a penguin
2016-11-01 11:43:09	alyptik	what is enoch?
2016-11-01 11:43:13	alyptik	that is form the bible
2016-11-01 11:43:16	minimalism	I actually had forgotten what Enoch meant, and found out someone else involved with the project came up with Gentoo
2016-11-01 11:43:18	minimalism	right
2016-11-01 11:43:27	alyptik	enoch was a dude in the bible
2016-11-01 11:43:28	minimalism	I realize gentoo is a penguin, but I didn't know the reason
2016-11-01 11:43:38	alyptik	i forget what he did exactly
2016-11-01 11:43:42	minimalism	apparently it's the fastest swimming penguin
2016-11-01 11:43:46	alyptik	lol what
2016-11-01 11:43:49	minimalism	well that's what I looked up
2016-11-01 11:43:51	alyptik	that is awesome
2016-11-01 11:43:57	minimalism	I forgot the whole enoch story
2016-11-01 11:44:16	minimalism	apparently it's believed he lived 365 years and was taken to heaven by God while still a living being
2016-11-01 11:44:24	minimalism	so Enoch almost means walk with God
2016-11-01 11:44:38	alyptik	YES that is it hah
2016-11-01 11:44:43	alyptik	it was bugging me i didn't remember
2016-11-01 11:44:45	minimalism	this is related to what NextHendrix and I kept looking into when we started using gentoo'
2016-11-01 11:44:54	minimalism	why it's called emerge and all that
2016-11-01 11:44:58	minimalism	and all the e* commands
2016-11-01 11:45:04	minimalism	like if the word emerge was really "emerge"
2016-11-01 11:45:09	minimalism	or e-merge
2016-11-01 11:45:29	minimalism	then one person in #gentoo who had been around a while mentioned it's most likely because it was originally due to the original name of Enoch Linux
2016-11-01 11:45:36	minimalism	so it's enoch* everything on those commands
2016-11-01 11:45:53	alyptik	i am trying to trim my kernel atm, do you run make localmodconf and nconfig?
2016-11-01 11:45:56	alyptik	or just the first?
2016-11-01 11:46:07	minimalism	when I configured it, I used menuconfig
2016-11-01 11:46:13	alyptik	oh gentoo used to be enoch?
2016-11-01 11:46:14	minimalism	but I have checked out nconfig here and there for searching
2016-11-01 11:46:20	minimalism	Enoch Linux is Gentoo
2016-11-01 11:46:24	alyptik	oh neat
2016-11-01 11:46:28	minimalism	in 1999 it launched as Enoch Linux
2016-11-01 11:46:35	minimalism	then it reformed into what is now gentoo
2016-11-01 11:46:37	alyptik	no localmodconfig at all?
2016-11-01 11:46:38	minimalism	around 2001
2016-11-01 11:46:42	alyptik	how do you know what to keep
2016-11-01 11:46:49	minimalism	I've never used localmodconfig
2016-11-01 11:46:50	minimalism	what's it for?
2016-11-01 11:47:00	alyptik	i'm making my kernel not bloated
2016-11-01 11:47:02	alyptik	gentoo
2016-11-01 11:47:10	minimalism	well I mean specific purpose
2016-11-01 11:47:12	minimalism	what does it do
2016-11-01 11:47:17	alyptik	oh the command
2016-11-01 11:47:54	minimalism	I'm really pleased with finding out that backstory on Enoch again
2016-11-01 11:47:57	minimalism	and the fastest swimmer
2016-11-01 11:48:06	minimalism	Want to know why Gentoo's system is so cool?
2016-11-01 11:48:08	alyptik	it set loaded modules to =m runs make oldconfig and sets rest to n 
2016-11-01 11:48:24	alyptik	so you only have included what you are actually using
2016-11-01 11:48:30	minimalism	I found Daniel Robbins' timeline
2016-11-01 11:48:33	minimalism	that he wrote himself
2016-11-01 11:48:41	alyptik	who is that
2016-11-01 11:48:47	minimalism	founder of Gentoo
2016-11-01 11:48:58	minimalism	he also created Funtoo
2016-11-01 11:49:06	alyptik	oo
2016-11-01 11:50:40	minimalism	apparently he created Enoch, and then
2016-11-01 11:50:50	minimalism	there was some incompatibility that forced him to use FreeBSD for a while
2016-11-01 11:50:57	minimalism	and some friend of his kept Enoch going in the meantime
2016-11-01 11:51:10	minimalism	then later in the year he returns to Enoch
2016-11-01 11:51:16	minimalism	after learning about FreeBSD's ports system and compiling
2016-11-01 11:51:32	minimalism	then he mixed all of these ideas into what became Gentoo and Portage in 2001
2016-11-01 11:52:02	alyptik	haha interesting
2016-11-01 11:52:21	minimalism	he basically went on a pilgrimage lol
2016-11-01 11:52:50	alyptik	lol
2016-11-01 11:53:57	minimalism	http://www.funtoo.org/Funtoo_Linux_History
2016-11-01 11:55:20	minimalism	What I really like about Gentoo is that it feels like.. because it's so customized and "from scratch"
2016-11-01 11:55:21	alyptik	alright i just tried it
2016-11-01 11:55:31	alyptik	took my fat config, ran make localmodconfig
2016-11-01 11:55:34	alyptik	we'll see if i can boot
2016-11-01 11:55:34	minimalism	that it makes you feel like you've been set free and can use any operating system no matter how obscure
2016-11-01 11:55:42	alyptik	++ 
2016-11-01 11:55:44	alyptik	i agree
2016-11-01 12:00:40	minimalism	Trying this localmodconfig now
2016-11-01 12:00:40		[12:00]
2016-11-01 12:00:45	minimalism	How exactly does it determine things?
2016-11-01 12:01:48	alyptik	whatever is loaded
2016-11-01 12:01:55	alyptik	modprobe loaded i mean
2016-11-01 12:02:19	alyptik	so the unused kernel modules are dropped
2016-11-01 12:04:39	minimalism	well I ran it and it made about a 10-20 line difference in config
2016-11-01 12:04:44	minimalism	but lsmod only has one module loaded, so
2016-11-01 12:04:48	minimalism	not really sure what it's doing
2016-11-01 12:05:01	alyptik	sec lemme find the doc i saw about it'
2016-11-01 12:05:14	minimalism	I can only imagine it's basing this on what's installed
2016-11-01 12:05:25	alyptik	https://www.kernel.org/doc/linux/README
2016-11-01 12:07:28	minimalism	localyesconfig seems interesting
2016-11-01 12:08:13	alyptik	i looked at that one too
2016-11-01 12:08:19	alyptik	if this breaks will try that next
2016-11-01 12:08:30	alyptik	i still dont understand initramfs well enough
2016-11-01 12:08:48	minimalism	apparently the only difference is that one modularizes CONFIG_X86_PKG_TEMP_THERMAL
2016-11-01 12:08:50	minimalism	and the other doesn't
2016-11-01 12:09:03	minimalism	I can't say I understand initramfs well either, but basically
2016-11-01 12:09:09	minimalism	anything you'd want to be available during boot, will be
2016-11-01 12:09:12	minimalism	if it's included in hte initramfs
2016-11-01 12:09:14	minimalism	the*
2016-11-01 12:09:28	minimalism	like radeon module if you want GPU capabilities to set resolution and make certain font rendering in tty available during boot
2016-11-01 12:10:43	minimalism	Are you sure this is finding loaded modules
2016-11-01 12:10:51	minimalism	because none of these are loaded except TEMP_THERMAL
2016-11-01 12:11:09	alyptik	it runs lsmod
2016-11-01 12:11:16	alyptik	do you have that installed?
2016-11-01 12:11:49	alyptik	also if it is already =(m|y) it doesn't change i think
2016-11-01 12:12:05	minimalism	lsmod has only showed one specific module since I started using gentoo
2016-11-01 12:12:12	alyptik	lol wut
2016-11-01 12:12:29	minimalism	# cat /proc/modules 
2016-11-01 12:12:31	minimalism	x86_pkg_temp_thermal 4791 0 - Live 0xffffffffa0003000
2016-11-01 12:12:37	alyptik	`lsmod | wc -l`
2016-11-01 12:12:38	minimalism	lsmod, or straight to it with /proc/modukes
2016-11-01 12:12:38	alyptik	200
2016-11-01 12:12:40	minimalism	modules*
2016-11-01 12:12:42	minimalism	that's it
2016-11-01 12:13:01	alyptik	i guess i need bloat to survive
2016-11-01 12:13:01	minimalism	2, which includes the line indicating each column
2016-11-01 12:13:23	minimalism	all this is doing is turning some things from "NOT SET" to "m"
2016-11-01 12:13:39	alyptik	weird
2016-11-01 12:13:47	alyptik	it trimmmed a bunch for me
2016-11-01 12:14:00	minimalism	well mine was already trim to begin with, so I'm unsure
2016-11-01 12:14:05	alyptik	ah maybe that's why]
2016-11-01 12:14:07	minimalism	I mean, my system works
2016-11-01 12:14:15	minimalism	so I don't know what to think here
2016-11-01 12:14:25	alyptik	you were prob fine before
2016-11-01 12:14:40	alyptik	can't trim trim unbloated things
2016-11-01 12:14:44	minimalism	the only thing I'm noticing though
2016-11-01 12:14:45	minimalism	is
2016-11-01 12:15:02	minimalism	it's basing this on the contents of /lib64/modules/<kernel>/modules.dep
2016-11-01 12:15:30	minimalism	perhaps it's correcting a mistake of mine if these are here
2016-11-01 12:15:47	minimalism	I'll trust it..
2016-11-01 12:15:47		[12:15]
2016-11-01 12:16:02	alyptik	i would try the localyesconfig
2016-11-01 12:16:06	alyptik	maybe then you dont need initramfs
2016-11-01 12:16:06	minimalism	If not, I'll drive down to Oregon and strangle Linus
2016-11-01 12:16:15	alyptik	lol
2016-11-01 12:17:36	minimalism	we really need to figure out initramfs with dracut, or gain full mastery by manually assembling one
2016-11-01 12:18:08	minimalism	I'm trying to figure out dcron atm since it's so poorly documented
2016-11-01 12:18:12	minimalism	there's like nothing to go on
2016-11-01 12:18:17	alyptik	what for though?
2016-11-01 12:18:22	minimalism	and I feel forced to learn dcron over cronie because
2016-11-01 12:18:25	alyptik	isnt openrc good enough for services
2016-11-01 12:18:36	minimalism	if you want to write init scripts for everything
2016-11-01 12:18:45	minimalism	cron jobs are like a clean up service more than anything
2016-11-01 12:18:46	alyptik	oh good point
2016-11-01 12:18:48	minimalism	have it remove systemd files
2016-11-01 12:18:52	minimalism	remove .keep files
2016-11-01 12:20:42	minimalism	lol fuck wait
2016-11-01 12:20:49	minimalism	I think localmodconfig was actually trimming
2016-11-01 12:20:55	minimalism	and I mixed up the config and config.old
2016-11-01 12:21:34	alyptik	haha
2016-11-01 12:21:43	minimalism	it was nerfing modules I didn't need I think
2016-11-01 12:21:52	minimalism	trimmed about 0.5 kb
2016-11-01 12:22:12	alyptik	how big is .config
2016-11-01 12:22:23	alyptik	or wait nm that is a dumb questionn
2016-11-01 12:22:34	minimalism	mine is about 94-95K
2016-11-01 12:22:54	alyptik	wait what
2016-11-01 12:23:04	alyptik	what .config file?
2016-11-01 12:23:07	minimalism	When you enable something
2016-11-01 12:23:11	minimalism	it expands additional config lines
2016-11-01 12:23:18	minimalism	like if you enable ext2 or ext3
2016-11-01 12:23:24	minimalism	it includes additional lines like encryption or bs like that
2016-11-01 12:23:25	alyptik	oo
2016-11-01 12:23:28	minimalism	if you don't enable it
2016-11-01 12:23:31	minimalism	it's just one line like
2016-11-01 12:23:34	minimalism	EXT3 IS NOT SET
2016-11-01 12:23:41	alyptik	mine is 120k
2016-11-01 12:23:46	alyptik	not too horrible
2016-11-01 12:23:59	alyptik	vs 156k
2016-11-01 12:24:02	alyptik	old one
2016-11-01 12:24:14	minimalism	I can probably still make this smaller
2016-11-01 12:24:55	minimalism	It's a give and take though.. will inevitably enable things I haven't enabled before
2016-11-01 12:25:01	minimalism	and learn about things I absolutely don't need
2016-11-01 12:25:07	minimalism	I'll probably end up with a smaller kernel though
2016-11-01 12:25:25	alyptik	hm i wonder if this will break if i compile with icc instead of gcc
2016-11-01 12:28:05	minimalism	I'm curious about these NF_ lines for IPV4, NAT, LOG, etc.
2016-11-01 12:28:07	minimalism	ARP
2016-11-01 12:28:14	minimalism	reminds me I haven't set up my firewall here ye t
2016-11-01 12:28:15	minimalism	yet*
2016-11-01 12:33:35	alyptik	hm?
2016-11-01 12:33:35		[12:33]
2016-11-01 12:33:38	alyptik	oh those
2016-11-01 12:33:49	alyptik	which ones specifically? or all?
2016-11-01 12:37:13	minimalism	any of them really
2016-11-01 12:37:18	minimalism	looking into iptables on gentoo now
2016-11-01 12:38:10	alyptik	oh
2016-11-01 12:38:17	alyptik	i think these are support for nftables
2016-11-01 12:38:30	alyptik	my source of the nftables package is all for making kernel modules
2016-11-01 12:38:40	minimalism	well they're both from netfilters, so I don't know
2016-11-01 12:38:44	alyptik	these ones to be precise
2016-11-01 12:38:58	alyptik	i think iptables uses some netfilter too
2016-11-01 12:44:00		[12:38]
2016-11-01 12:46:01	alyptik	do you bother with sudo?
2016-11-01 12:46:07	alyptik	or just su root for things that need it
2016-11-01 12:47:19	minimalism	I use sudo
2016-11-01 12:47:27	minimalism	I actually disable the root account
2016-11-01 12:47:44	minimalism	half the login is already guessed if it's allowed to log in or be used
2016-11-01 12:47:48	alyptik	oh so you just make yourself root basically
2016-11-01 12:47:51	alyptik	changing name
2016-11-01 12:48:59	alyptik	WOW
2016-11-01 12:49:04	alyptik	i am done compiling wtf
2016-11-01 12:49:19	alyptik	that like like 20 minutes
2016-11-01 12:49:23	alyptik	was like*
2016-11-01 12:55:00		[12:49]
2016-11-01 14:21:38	minimalism	back to trying to get iptables to work
2016-11-01 14:21:38		[14:21]
2016-11-01 14:23:25	minimalism	arch just read from files in /etc/iptables but this seems a bit different
2016-11-01 14:23:30	minimalism	not sure how to load rules from a file here
2016-11-01 14:28:43	alyptik	tbh i hate iptables even on arc
2016-11-01 14:28:49	alyptik	i just use nftables for all my machine
2016-11-01 14:29:11	minimalism	well it's a necessity if you operate a server or something
2016-11-01 14:29:33	alyptik	why not nftables?
2016-11-01 14:29:42	alyptik	it is basically the new iptables
2016-11-01 14:30:01	minimalism	I haven't really tried it, but I guess
2016-11-01 14:30:07	minimalism	I'm gonna check if alpine has it in repositories though
2016-11-01 14:30:13	minimalism	I want to learn things I can use on my server(s)
2016-11-01 14:30:25	alyptik	sec i'll show you mine
2016-11-01 14:31:13	minimalism	ah very good, alpine has both
2016-11-01 14:31:22	minimalism	but they seem to have a firm stance on the cron situation..
2016-11-01 14:31:25	minimalism	nothing but dcron
2016-11-01 14:31:43	alyptik	https://ptpb.pw/Ofrx/text
2016-11-01 14:31:55	minimalism	Does it work for ipv6?
2016-11-01 14:31:57	alyptik	it is a lot easier to keep straight imo
2016-11-01 14:32:12	alyptik	make changes sudo nft -f /etc/nftables.nft
2016-11-01 14:32:13	alyptik	done
2016-11-01 14:32:30	minimalism	holy fucking balls this is long
2016-11-01 14:33:04	alyptik	sorry it is for my pub facing server
2016-11-01 14:33:08	alyptik	has to be detailed
2016-11-01 14:33:18	minimalism	yeah the one I'm talking about is too
2016-11-01 14:33:21	minimalism	full on production stuff
2016-11-01 14:33:30	alyptik	isnt iptables basically same length?
2016-11-01 14:33:34	alyptik	as my file i mean
2016-11-01 14:33:54	alyptik	the rules work almost the same that's why, just organized different
2016-11-01 14:35:32	minimalism	well I'm using a simple stateful firewall or whatever
2016-11-01 14:35:52	alyptik	stateful?
2016-11-01 14:35:53	minimalism	https://ptpb.pw/AHng1L0CIjJRnFKSADk-KG2_2VMy
2016-11-01 14:36:01	minimalism	that's what they call it.. stateful, stateless, whatever
2016-11-01 14:36:10	minimalism	I have no fucking idea what any of it means, I can't "into" networking
2016-11-01 14:36:22	alyptik	oh ok
2016-11-01 14:36:26	alyptik	i didn't know what it was called
2016-11-01 14:36:34	alyptik	this is for your pub server though?
2016-11-01 14:36:45	minimalism	no
2016-11-01 14:36:45		[14:36]
2016-11-01 14:36:47	minimalism	my own machine
2016-11-01 14:36:53	minimalism	public server doesn't have much more though
2016-11-01 14:36:58	alyptik	you basically drop everything that isn't RELATED,ESTABLISHED lol
2016-11-01 14:37:20	minimalism	My rules do?
2016-11-01 14:37:25	alyptik	yeah
2016-11-01 14:37:29	minimalism	well
2016-11-01 14:37:37	minimalism	It works whatever it does
2016-11-01 14:37:54	alyptik	oh wait
2016-11-01 14:38:00	alyptik	jk you accept everything
2016-11-01 14:38:13	alyptik	-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j TCP
2016-11-01 14:38:19	alyptik	but you drop everything else
2016-11-01 14:38:22	alyptik	that works too
2016-11-01 14:38:30	alyptik	nice way to handle it actually
2016-11-01 14:39:40	minimalism	this was a recommended firewall I've read on a wiki
2016-11-01 14:39:57	alyptik	it is a pretty good idea
2016-11-01 14:40:28	alyptik	ah just tried, does work for me though; must be because i am bridging my public from my modem
2016-11-01 14:40:39	alyptik	ISP public IPs can be weird
2016-11-01 14:40:51	alyptik	i should get a VPS
2016-11-01 14:41:38	minimalism	I really need to get an SBC and install alpine to learn some networking stuff
2016-11-01 14:44:44	alyptik	how i am (attempting to) teach myself:
2016-11-01 14:44:46	alyptik	https://kernelnewbies.org/Networking?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=hacking_the_wholism_of_linux_net.txt

2016-11-01 14:48:58	alyptik	yeah
2016-11-01 14:49:03	alyptik	the network stack is fking complicated
2016-11-01 14:53:29	minimalism	not quite sure what to do now
2016-11-01 14:53:29		[14:53]
2016-11-01 14:55:55	alyptik	did your kernel work
2016-11-01 14:55:59	alyptik	with localyesconfig?
2016-11-01 14:59:47	minimalism	Haven't compiled it
2016-11-01 14:59:53	minimalism	was just testing differences between config files
2016-11-01 15:01:01	alyptik	ah
2016-11-01 15:06:22	minimalism	sigh this is ridiculous
2016-11-01 15:06:27	minimalism	it's not reading the iptables rules for some reason
2016-11-01 15:06:34	minimalism	it's erroring out when I try to run iptables-restore

2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:30:13] I want to learn things I can use on my server(s) [00:30:13]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:31:13] ah very good, alpine has both [00:31:13]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:31:22] but they seem to have a firm stance on the cron situation.. [00:31:22]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:31:25] nothing but dcron [00:31:25]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:31:55] Does it work for ipv6? [00:31:55]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:32:30] holy fucking balls this is long [00:32:30]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:33:18] yeah the one I'm talking about is too [00:33:18]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:33:21] full on production stuff [00:33:21]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:35:32] well I'm using a simple stateful firewall or whatever [00:35:32]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:35:53] https://ptpb.pw/AHng1L0CIjJRnFKSADk-KG2_2VMy [00:35:53]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:36:01] that's what they call it.. stateful, stateless, whatever [00:36:01]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:36:10] I have no fucking idea what any of it means, I can't "into" networking [00:36:10]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:36:45] no [00:36:45]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:36:47] my own machine [00:36:47]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:36:53] public server doesn't have much more though [00:36:53]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:37:20] My rules do? [00:37:20]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:37:29] well [00:37:29]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:37:37] It works whatever it does [00:37:37]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:39:40] this was a recommended firewall I've read on a wiki [00:39:40]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:41:38] I really need to get an SBC and install alpine to learn some networking stuff [00:41:38]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:48:10] damn that's long [00:48:10]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:53:29] not quite sure what to do now [00:53:29]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:59:47] Haven't compiled it [00:59:47]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[00:59:53] was just testing differences between config files [00:59:53]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[01:06:22] sigh this is ridiculous [01:06:22]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[01:06:27] it's not reading the iptables rules for some reason [01:06:27]
2016-11-02 00:56:17	minimalism	[01:06:34] it's erroring out when I try to run iptables-restore [01:06:34]

2016-11-02 03:35:45		[03:35]
2016-11-02 03:37:48	alyptik	i did not D:
2016-11-02 03:37:59	alyptik	been trying to get gcc6 so i can use distcc
2016-11-02 03:38:05	minimalism	I forgot about it, but it was enabled in the livedvd
2016-11-02 03:38:14	minimalism	it makes that back and forth text cursor thing during emerge
2016-11-02 03:38:14	alyptik	but bleh now working
2016-11-02 03:38:20	alyptik	neat
2016-11-02 03:38:27	alyptik	i will stick that in now before i head to bed
2016-11-02 03:38:42	minimalism	I'm forcing myself to learn everything I can about gentoo so I'm ready for using alpine in production
2016-11-02 03:38:56	minimalism	basically just an easy version of gentoo that's more minimal and binary
2016-11-02 03:39:02	alyptik	lol
2016-11-02 03:42:36	minimalism	add this line to make.conf
2016-11-02 03:42:38	minimalism	FEATURES="candy"
2016-11-02 03:44:06	alyptik	i just did
2016-11-02 03:44:09	alyptik	nice!
2016-11-02 03:44:09	minimalism	682 MiB RAM with Chromium open.. waaat
2016-11-02 03:44:13	alyptik	it's like the pacman one
2016-11-02 03:44:26	minimalism	well pacman doesn't have that cursor coloring though
2016-11-02 03:44:28	minimalism	going back and forth
2016-11-02 03:44:36	minimalism	it's cooler if you set a cursor color in your term
2016-11-02 03:44:57	minimalism	like this:
2016-11-02 03:44:59	minimalism	URxvt.cursorColor: #5E468C

2016-11-02 03:46:35	alyptik	that is sick
2016-11-02 03:47:19	alyptik	tom i need to figure out this overlay business
2016-11-02 03:47:24	alyptik	need to get gcc6 installed
2016-11-02 03:47:35	minimalism	what's your issue with gcc exactly
2016-11-02 03:47:38	minimalism	why can't you install 6
2016-11-02 03:48:54	alyptik	distcc
2016-11-02 03:48:59	minimalism	no I mean
2016-11-02 03:49:06	minimalism	why are you unable to install 6
2016-11-02 03:49:08	alyptik	i don't understand overlays
2016-11-02 03:49:13	alyptik	you need one to install it
2016-11-02 03:49:15	minimalism	what do overlays have to do with this
2016-11-02 03:49:23	alyptik	gcc version is 4.x
2016-11-02 03:49:24	minimalism	there's a 6+ ebuild in official
2016-11-02 03:49:27	alyptik	what
2016-11-02 03:49:28	alyptik	where
2016-11-02 03:49:32	alyptik	i couldn't find one

2016-11-02 03:50:57	alyptik	i think i will just wait for you before i do shit from now on

2016-11-02 13:10:30	minimalism	Overlays are actually really simple
2016-11-02 13:10:30		[13:10]
2016-11-02 13:10:46	alyptik	i have layman
2016-11-02 13:10:51	alyptik	did -a overlay
2016-11-02 13:10:54	alyptik	but now what lol
2016-11-02 13:10:59	minimalism	I'm not using layman
2016-11-02 13:11:09	minimalism	tbh I don't understand its purpose still
2016-11-02 13:11:12	alyptik	same
2016-11-02 13:11:16	alyptik	i can mount one
2016-11-02 13:11:24	alyptik	but then idk what to do with it
2016-11-02 13:11:31	alyptik	should i use another tool?
2016-11-02 13:11:36	minimalism	I created the /usr/local/overlay/ dir
2016-11-02 13:11:52	minimalism	created dirs with the names of the appropriate overlays I wanted
2016-11-02 13:11:59	minimalism	then in /etc/portage/repos.conf
2016-11-02 13:12:06	minimalism	created .conf files in the name of said overlays
2016-11-02 13:12:16	minimalism	like for example..
2016-11-02 13:12:23	minimalism	created /usr/local/overlay/tox-overlay/
2016-11-02 13:12:39	alyptik	that sounds way simpler
2016-11-02 13:12:43	minimalism	then created /etc/portage/repos.conf/tox-overlay.conf
2016-11-02 13:12:45	alyptik	google results said to use layman
2016-11-02 13:12:51	minimalism	and insert this in the file
2016-11-02 13:12:52	minimalism	[tox-overlay]
2016-11-02 13:12:54	alyptik	oh also i am installing this ebuild by path
2016-11-02 13:12:54	minimalism	location = /usr/local/overlay/tox-overlay
2016-11-02 13:12:56	minimalism	sync-type = git
2016-11-02 13:12:58	minimalism	sync-uri = git://github.com/Tox/gentoo-overlay-tox
2016-11-02 13:13:00	minimalism	auto-sync = yes
2016-11-02 13:13:02	minimalism	then I do emerge --sync as usual, because it just works with that
2016-11-02 13:13:02	alyptik	is there another way to do this?
2016-11-02 13:13:11	minimalism	create a local overlay
2016-11-02 13:13:16	minimalism	maybe put it in there or something..
2016-11-02 13:13:22	alyptik	oh that works
2016-11-02 13:13:46	minimalism	local overlay is /usr/local/portage/
2016-11-02 13:13:56	minimalism	mentions how to do it on the wiki
2016-11-02 13:14:09	minimalism	I gotta go like destress or something..
2016-11-02 13:14:12	minimalism	difficult day

2016-11-02 17:07:09	minimalism	just did some commands back and forth with a few tools to change some terrible ASS subs to UTF-8 SRT
2016-11-02 17:07:18	minimalism	and removed all those windows ^M line breaks
2016-11-02 17:07:36	alyptik	lol
2016-11-02 17:13:00		[17:07]
2016-11-02 17:15:54	minimalism	just started running my muxing script
2016-11-02 17:16:05	alyptik	it's working now?
2016-11-02 17:16:17	minimalism	yeah, phillid helped me the other day
2016-11-02 17:16:20	alyptik	nice
2016-11-02 17:16:26	minimalism	I cleaned up the dragon ball files, now I'm doing dbz
2016-11-02 17:16:32	minimalism	I always disassemble the mkv container contents
2016-11-02 17:16:38	minimalism	clean it up a bit.. mostly subtitles
2016-11-02 17:16:40	minimalism	remove things
2016-11-02 17:16:43	minimalism	re-order tracks if necessary
2016-11-02 17:16:47	minimalism	then remux in a clean new mkv
2016-11-02 17:16:54	minimalism	then run another script to properly set metadata
2016-11-02 17:17:23	minimalism	now I have sweet SRT subs that listen to my media player config
2016-11-02 17:17:27	minimalism	so I can have my own font and all
2016-11-02 17:17:43	minimalism	srs.. anything but SRT is unacceptable
2016-11-02 17:17:53	alyptik	i almost have gcc setup 
2016-11-02 17:17:55	minimalism	it's the only cleanly written format, and it lets people choose their own font/font size
2016-11-02 17:18:01	alyptik	distcc is good, just need to setup ccache

2016-11-02 17:18:44	minimalism	and how close to being done compiling
2016-11-02 17:20:50	alyptik	oh not compiling atm
2016-11-02 17:20:54	alyptik	just setting up config
2016-11-02 17:21:25	minimalism	on ep 120 now muxing
2016-11-02 17:21:48	minimalism	I've really gotta get through my watch list here.. ton of hard drive space occupied
2016-11-02 17:24:48	alyptik	haha
2016-11-02 17:29:12	minimalism	Have like 80 movies to watch
2016-11-02 17:29:12		[17:29]
2016-11-02 17:29:17	minimalism	and a few series to get through/delete
2016-11-02 17:35:00		[17:29]
2016-11-02 17:51:41	minimalism	fucking.. damnit
2016-11-02 17:51:41		[17:51]
2016-11-02 17:51:48	minimalism	just noticed something went wrong with the mux
2016-11-02 17:57:00		[17:51]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[13:49:24] there's a 6+ ebuild in official [13:49:24]
2016-11-02 23:27:15		[23:27]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[13:49:35] cd /usr/portage/sys-devel/gcc [13:49:35]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[13:49:40] ls | grep gcc-6 [13:49:40]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[13:50:35] echo ">=sys-devel/gcc-6.2.0-r1" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords/keywords [13:50:35]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[13:50:57] next time just do a find search in /usr/portage [13:50:57]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[13:51:01] literally the easiest way [13:51:01]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[13:52:55] oh also [13:52:55]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[13:52:57] equery meta pkgname [13:52:57]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[13:54:13] lol wait [13:54:13]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[13:54:15] just noticed something [13:54:15]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[13:54:21] there's absolutely no keywords on 6.2 [13:54:21]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[13:54:29] there's not even a highlight of arch support [13:54:29]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[13:54:44] just double checked on gentoo.org [13:54:44]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[13:54:51] that ebuild must be super experimental [13:54:51]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[23:10:30] Overlays are actually really simple [23:10:30]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[23:10:59] I'm not using layman [23:10:59]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[23:11:09] tbh I don't understand its purpose still [23:11:09]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[23:11:36] I created the /usr/local/overlay/ dir [23:11:36]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[23:11:52] created dirs with the names of the appropriate overlays I wanted [23:11:52]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[23:11:59] then in /etc/portage/repos.conf [23:11:59]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[23:12:06] created .conf files in the name of said overlays [23:12:06]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[23:12:16] like for example.. [23:12:16]
2016-11-02 23:27:15	minimalism	[23:12:23] created /usr/local/overlay/tox-overlay/ [23:12:23]
2016-11-02 23:27:16	minimalism	[23:12:43] then created /etc/portage/repos.conf/tox-overlay.conf [23:12:43]
2016-11-02 23:27:16	minimalism	[23:12:51] and insert this in the file [23:12:51]
2016-11-02 23:27:16	minimalism	[23:12:52] [tox-overlay] [23:12:52]
2016-11-02 23:27:16	minimalism	[23:12:54] location = /usr/local/overlay/tox-overlay [23:12:54]
2016-11-02 23:27:16	minimalism	[23:12:56] sync-type = git [23:12:56]
2016-11-02 23:27:16	minimalism	[23:12:58] sync-uri = git://github.com/Tox/gentoo-overlay-tox [23:12:58]
2016-11-02 23:27:16	minimalism	[23:13:00] auto-sync = yes [23:13:00]
2016-11-02 23:27:16	minimalism	[23:13:02] then I do emerge --sync as usual, because it just works with that [23:13:02]
2016-11-02 23:27:16	minimalism	[23:13:11] create a local overlay [23:13:11]
2016-11-02 23:27:16	minimalism	[23:13:16] maybe put it in there or something.. [23:13:16]
2016-11-02 23:27:16	minimalism	[23:13:46] local overlay is /usr/local/portage/ [23:13:46]
2016-11-02 23:27:16	minimalism	[23:13:56] mentions how to do it on the wiki [23:13:56]
2016-11-02 23:27:16	minimalism	[23:14:09] I gotta go like destress or something.. [23:14:09]
2016-11-02 23:27:16	minimalism	[23:14:12] difficult day [23:14:12]
2016-11-02 23:27:16	minimalism	[03:06:51] neat [03:06:51]
2016-11-02 23:27:16	minimalism	[03:07:09] just did some commands back and forth with a few tools to change some terrible ASS subs to UTF-8 SRT [03:07:09]
2016-11-02 23:27:16	minimalism	[03:07:18] and removed all those windows ^M line breaks [03:07:18]
2016-11-02 23:27:16	minimalism	[03:15:54] just started running my muxing script [03:15:54]

2016-11-02 23:33:00		[23:27]
2016-11-03 12:05:07	minimalism	setting up an alpine server
2016-11-03 12:05:07		[12:05]
2016-11-03 12:05:15	minimalism	makes more sense after having used gentoo
2016-11-03 12:06:05	alyptik	on your VPS?
2016-11-03 12:08:50	minimalism	yeah
2016-11-03 12:09:03	minimalism	ash is limited.. but it's enough, I think
2016-11-03 12:09:14	minimalism	unless you're doing a bunch of background tasks and sysadmin stuff, I don't know
2016-11-03 12:09:17	alyptik	it should be enough
2016-11-03 12:09:22	alyptik	you could try ksh too
2016-11-03 12:09:26	minimalism	alpine offers you the option to install a lot of GNU versions of things
2016-11-03 12:09:31	minimalism	if you don't like busybox's applets
2016-11-03 12:09:31	alyptik	small still but more feaatures
2016-11-03 12:09:39	minimalism	that's why I really like this OS
2016-11-03 12:09:49	minimalism	it doesn't do anything more than necessary, but you can if you want to
2016-11-03 12:09:54	minimalism	it's like the gentoo of binary
2016-11-03 12:09:59	alyptik	cool
2016-11-03 12:10:10	minimalism	installed bash too, not to use as a shell but
2016-11-03 12:10:15	minimalism	for scripts/programs that require bash env
2016-11-03 12:16:00		[12:10]
2016-11-03 12:53:21	minimalism	muh gentoo
2016-11-03 12:53:21		[12:53]
2016-11-03 12:53:34	alyptik	i still need to see if mine boots

2016-11-03 12:53:42	alyptik	but doing too many things to reboot atm
2016-11-03 12:57:30	minimalism	trying to resist customizing anything on alpine
2016-11-03 12:57:47	minimalism	need to focus on security and hardening only, or it ends up being a rabbit hole of ricing
2016-11-03 12:59:29	alyptik	haha
2016-11-03 13:00:58	minimalism	I have to learn some ash stuff
2016-11-03 13:01:06	minimalism	afaik.. only .profile exists for ash
2016-11-03 13:01:14	minimalism	no rc, env, and what not type files
2016-11-03 13:01:21	minimalism	wonder if PS1 works the same
2016-11-03 13:01:30	alyptik	my router runs ash
2016-11-03 13:01:34	alyptik	it works about the same
2016-11-03 13:01:46	minimalism	is it just the one dotfile?
2016-11-03 13:02:21	minimalism	okay definitely not the same as zsh PS1
2016-11-03 13:02:29	alyptik	it is closer to bash

2016-11-03 13:04:47	minimalism	yeah which is why it's clearly not worth using ash
2016-11-03 13:04:48	alyptik	so much easiar
2016-11-03 13:04:53	alyptik	heh
2016-11-03 13:04:59	minimalism	bash and anything related need to fucking go
2016-11-03 13:05:12	minimalism	we need to be using plain bourne shell for everything shell like we do now for executing

2016-11-03 13:05:29	minimalism	if I created a distro.. no fucking bash

2016-11-03 13:05:43	alyptik	zsh should work on alpine too
2016-11-03 13:05:47	minimalism	I might just default it to bourne shell and maybe give users the option if I don't force zsh
2016-11-03 13:05:47	alyptik	i use zsh find on my router
2016-11-03 13:05:48	minimalism	it does
2016-11-03 13:05:54	alyptik	s/find/fine
2016-11-03 13:05:57	minimalism	I just wanted to avoid the rabbit hole because if I add zsh
2016-11-03 13:06:00	alyptik	ah
2016-11-03 13:06:06	minimalism	it means I'll be inclined to make it mirror my main machine
2016-11-03 13:07:24	minimalism	fuck it
2016-11-03 13:07:25	minimalism	zshing it
2016-11-03 13:07:29	minimalism	just going to use "moderation"
2016-11-03 13:07:35	alyptik	lol
2016-11-03 13:08:41	minimalism	wat
2016-11-03 13:08:41		[13:08]
2016-11-03 13:08:44	minimalism	no useradd command
2016-11-03 13:08:48	minimalism	well this is a problem
2016-11-03 13:08:59	alyptik	oh i installed that with opkg
2016-11-03 13:09:05	alyptik	idk what to do on alpine
2016-11-03 13:09:52	minimalism	apparently busybox has its own version of "adduser"
2016-11-03 13:10:11	minimalism	I like how it doesn't have a chsh command lol
2016-11-03 13:10:17	minimalism	basically "fuck you, edit passwd"
2016-11-03 13:12:47	minimalism	you forget how many things shell does for you until you use ash
2016-11-03 13:12:57	minimalism	like chown GNU version
2016-11-03 13:13:01	minimalism	lets you user:group
2016-11-03 13:13:11	minimalism	this one does not, which makes me have to use the chgrp command
2016-11-03 13:13:40	minimalism	also apparently it does not auto create a group for your user
2016-11-03 13:13:48	alyptik	for sure
2016-11-03 13:19:00		[13:13]
2016-11-03 13:46:48	minimalism	trying to think if I should be making a group for my user..
2016-11-03 13:46:48		[13:46]
2016-11-03 13:47:35	alyptik	not 100% if needed tbh
2016-11-03 13:47:56	minimalism	yeah really not sure though because all users are assigned a group that is used on files when created
2016-11-03 13:48:06	minimalism	right now it's username:wheel being assigned
2016-11-03 13:48:44	alyptik	doesnt seem harmful
2016-11-03 13:49:50	minimalism	well it's still not giving me any sort of root ability just because of the group being assigned to files
2016-11-03 13:50:09	minimalism	and regardless, the files belong to my user
2016-11-03 13:50:14	minimalism	and root can do anything, so if you're wheel
2016-11-03 13:50:16	minimalism	you're fucking wheel
2016-11-03 13:50:21	alyptik	lol
2016-11-03 13:50:43	minimalism	I'm not sure I see the point in user named group tbh
2016-11-03 13:50:51	alyptik	same
2016-11-03 13:50:56	minimalism	yes, it does isolate it a bit more than something like group "users"
2016-11-03 13:51:04	minimalism	might prevent another user from gaining access because of same group
2016-11-03 13:51:17	minimalism	but if the group is wheel, then I certainly don't
2016-11-03 13:51:43	minimalism	well, less is more as they say
2016-11-03 13:51:53	minimalism	and more should be deleted from all nix systems asap
2016-11-03 13:52:05	alyptik	i agree
2016-11-03 13:52:24	alyptik	it is prob useful more for multi user computers
2016-11-03 13:52:42	minimalism	yeah I see no purpose here if all users are in wheel
2016-11-03 13:52:59	minimalism	it's just root (will be disabled), my user as wheel group, and app specific user
2016-11-03 13:53:07	minimalism	although I don't think that user would have wheel access
2016-11-03 13:59:00		[13:53]
2016-11-03 14:37:44	minimalism	I've seen DB and DBZ so many times, but
2016-11-03 14:37:44		[14:37]
2016-11-03 14:37:51	minimalism	How the fuck did DBZ make sense at all to anyone in America
2016-11-03 14:37:56	minimalism	who hadn't already seen DB beforehand?
2016-11-03 14:38:19	alyptik	DB played in america
2016-11-03 14:38:23	alyptik	iirc
2016-11-03 14:38:31	minimalism	very shortly though.. not the entire thing either
2016-11-03 14:38:35	minimalism	no one had seen it before Z
2016-11-03 14:38:35	alyptik	true
2016-11-03 14:38:43	alyptik	and no idea
2016-11-03 14:38:43	minimalism	and virtually no one ever
2016-11-03 14:38:49	minimalism	actually saw DB
2016-11-03 14:42:17	minimalism	now I see what happens
2016-11-03 14:42:28	minimalism	adduser won't create you a user group if you specify an existing group
2016-11-03 14:42:38	alyptik	ah
2016-11-03 14:45:14	minimalism	something you may find interesting if you deal with video codec at all
2016-11-03 14:45:23	minimalism	when I was extracting all the contents of these DBZ mkvs
2016-11-03 14:45:27	minimalism	and cleaning all the files
2016-11-03 14:45:32	minimalism	converting subs to srt, etc.
2016-11-03 14:45:44	minimalism	after I remuxed them.. what was actually a microsoft codec like FOURCC
2016-11-03 14:45:49	minimalism	somehow became x264
2016-11-03 14:46:01	minimalism	but the file didn't change as far as I can tell
2016-11-03 14:46:11	alyptik	wtf is FourCC
2016-11-03 14:46:12	alyptik	lol
2016-11-03 14:46:24	alyptik	never even heard of it
2016-11-03 14:47:23	minimalism	https://matroska.org/technical/specs/codecid/index.html
2016-11-03 14:47:48	alyptik	microsoft to lazy to change anything but name rofl 
2016-11-03 14:47:51	minimalism	V_MS/VFW/FOURCC Microsoft (TM) Video Codec Manager (VCM)
2016-11-03 14:47:54	alyptik	s/to l/too l
2016-11-03 14:47:57	minimalism	yeah it seems like it's literally just a name
2016-11-03 14:48:20	minimalism	because somehow mkv recognizes it as x264 lol
2016-11-03 14:49:04	alyptik	lol
2016-11-03 14:55:00		[14:49]
2016-11-03 14:58:52	minimalism	one thing I noticed is that alpine does not PAM by default
2016-11-03 14:59:04	minimalism	last time I tried it a month ago, I'm pretty sure I noticed that, but I'm unsure what package pulled it in
2016-11-03 14:59:15	alyptik	it doesn't most things default heh
2016-11-03 14:59:18	alyptik	NH said no manpages
2016-11-03 14:59:23	minimalism	well depends
2016-11-03 14:59:27	minimalism	you can use standar
2016-11-03 14:59:29	minimalism	d
2016-11-03 14:59:31	minimalism	or extended
2016-11-03 14:59:33	minimalism	I use extended
2016-11-03 14:59:36	alyptik	ah
2016-11-03 14:59:39	minimalism	it's basically the same thing without as much of a pain
2016-11-03 14:59:46	alyptik	heh
2016-11-03 14:59:53	minimalism	even extended is more minimal than anything you've ever seen lol
2016-11-03 14:59:59	alyptik	how close to LFS
2016-11-03 15:00:09	minimalism	how close in what way?
2016-11-03 15:00:14	minimalism	I also have not yet tried LFS
2016-11-03 15:00:15	alyptik	setup to be done
2016-11-03 15:00:25	alyptik	making gcc toolchain etc
2016-11-03 15:00:36	minimalism	oh it works by default
2016-11-03 15:00:36	minimalism	it does all of openrc for you and all that
2016-11-03 15:00:42	minimalism	and the setup-alpine script just hands things to you
2016-11-03 15:00:43	alyptik	ah thank god hah
2016-11-03 15:00:45	minimalism	this isn't binary
2016-11-03 15:00:47	minimalism	err
2016-11-03 15:00:50	minimalism	isn't source-based*
2016-11-03 15:00:50	alyptik	setting up gcc fucking sucks
2016-11-03 15:00:51	minimalism	this is binary
2016-11-03 15:00:52	alyptik	oh
2016-11-03 15:01:07	minimalism	it's as I said.. it's like a minimal binary version of gentoo almost
2016-11-03 15:01:15	alyptik	missed that part
2016-11-03 15:01:16	minimalism	openrc, busybox, musl..
2016-11-03 15:01:23	alyptik	so what is the package manager?
2016-11-03 15:01:29	minimalism	something called apk
2016-11-03 15:01:36	minimalism	very small/basic.. doesn't do anything luxurious
2016-11-03 15:01:38	alyptik	ah
2016-11-03 15:01:50	minimalism	it's more like pacman really
2016-11-03 15:02:00	alyptik	pacman isn't bad
2016-11-03 15:02:04	alyptik	just wish it was open source
2016-11-03 15:02:06	minimalism	but without all the bells and whisles
2016-11-03 15:02:13	minimalism	pacman isn't open source?
2016-11-03 15:02:15	alyptik	nope
2016-11-03 15:02:17	alyptik	lol
2016-11-03 15:02:19	minimalism	the source is up on archlinux I thought
2016-11-03 15:02:32	alyptik	arch doesn't maintain pacman iirc
2016-11-03 15:03:04	minimalism	https://git.archlinux.org/pacman.git/tree/
2016-11-03 15:03:20	alyptik	oh hm i must be thinking of something else
2016-11-03 15:03:29	alyptik	in arch gen someone said pacman wasn't open source
2016-11-03 15:03:44	alyptik	maybe they meant libalpm or somethign
2016-11-03 15:04:02	minimalism	the amount of C code in things like this make my head spin
2016-11-03 15:04:12	alyptik	lol fuck yeah
2016-11-03 15:04:22	alyptik	i tried to look at gcc source once 
2016-11-03 15:04:25	minimalism	I want to understand and be able to use C so badly, but
2016-11-03 15:04:26	alyptik	fuck that as well
2016-11-03 15:04:36	minimalism	I just don't know if I'll ever grasp it, and the only reassurance I have is that
2016-11-03 15:04:43	minimalism	I never thought I'd be as far along as I am right now either
2016-11-03 15:04:47	alyptik	i am trying to do it little by little
2016-11-03 15:04:56	alyptik	mostly you jsut have to dissect githubs
2016-11-03 15:05:01	alyptik	stuff slowly starts to make sense
2016-11-03 15:05:02	minimalism	most people argue learn a language first but..
2016-11-03 15:05:07	minimalism	it just doesn't work that way for me
2016-11-03 15:05:24	minimalism	it's like learning to build houses before you've ever even lived in one
2016-11-03 15:05:50	minimalism	I don't see how they can use C so proficiently without a lot of experience with advance use of nix
2016-11-03 15:06:00	alyptik	me neither
2016-11-03 15:06:04	minimalism	like a lot of the terminology in C made zero sense to me until I started reading about and using gentoo
2016-11-03 15:06:11	minimalism	like memory management and all
2016-11-03 15:06:28	alyptik	like pointers you mean?
2016-11-03 15:06:42	minimalism	Any of it really
2016-11-03 15:06:51	alyptik	yeah it is a lot to grasp
2016-11-03 15:06:52	minimalism	Like.. you know how your memory usage displayed it sometimes not accurate
2016-11-03 15:06:59	minimalism	like it's not actually being used
2016-11-03 15:07:01	alyptik	C is pretty close to hardware
2016-11-03 15:07:02	minimalism	it just wasn't cleared
2016-11-03 15:07:17	minimalism	I didn't understand what C meant by garbage collection or memory management at all
2016-11-03 15:07:26	minimalism	until I started using more advanced nix and witnessing these things
2016-11-03 15:07:32	minimalism	to really know its connection to hardware
2016-11-03 15:07:41	minimalism	how can you really write C without understanding the machine itself?
2016-11-03 15:07:51	minimalism	if you do, it's probably pitiful code
2016-11-03 15:08:12	minimalism	either way though.. the system is all that really interests me
2016-11-03 15:08:26	minimalism	the code I feel is more of just something that may happen during my adventures with the machine
2016-11-03 15:08:48	minimalism	right
2016-11-03 15:08:56	minimalism	people argue against gentoo being a waste of time, but I mean really
2016-11-03 15:09:07	minimalism	anyone using this OS knows more than archers unless said archers also used gentoo at one point
2016-11-03 15:09:17	minimalism	and a lot of them did
2016-11-03 15:09:56	minimalism	that's why I really resent the gentoo bashing
2016-11-03 15:10:08	minimalism	they're like "it's a waste of time/text flying by for hours" etc.
2016-11-03 15:10:08		[15:10]
2016-11-03 15:10:09	alyptik	it isn't really an arch thing
2016-11-03 15:10:14	minimalism	when they received the benefit of the knowledge already
2016-11-03 15:10:17	alyptik	tbh the distro wars is linux wide
2016-11-03 15:10:20	minimalism	but the people who haven't used gentoo haven't yet
2016-11-03 15:10:27	alyptik	anyone on a distro shit talks other distros lols
2016-11-03 15:10:31	alyptik	it's a fact of life
2016-11-03 15:10:54	minimalism	I could still give arch the seal of approval if it weren't using systemd
2016-11-03 15:10:57	minimalism	but it is, so I can't
2016-11-03 15:11:16	alyptik	and openrc on arch is ugh
2016-11-03 15:11:19	minimalism	aside from that one detail, it's a fantastic OS
2016-11-03 15:11:20	alyptik	not worth bothering
2016-11-03 15:11:25	minimalism	if it were supported by default
2016-11-03 15:11:28	minimalism	it'd be fantastic
2016-11-03 15:12:42	minimalism	it's no wonder Linus gets mad
2016-11-03 15:12:56	minimalism	his knowledge is from a time before all the ease of use we have now
2016-11-03 15:12:59	minimalism	so it's really close to the metal
2016-11-03 15:13:16	alyptik	Linus' first words were prob "ffs"
2016-11-03 15:13:52	alyptik	it must be a burden
2016-11-03 15:13:59	alyptik	knowing more than anyone in the world about kernel
2016-11-03 15:14:01	alyptik	seriously
2016-11-03 15:14:07	minimalism	yeah, I know.. and the worst part is
2016-11-03 15:14:13	minimalism	people constantly complain and try to get him fired
2016-11-03 15:14:16	minimalism	because of his attitude
2016-11-03 15:14:18	alyptik	lol yeah
2016-11-03 15:14:22	minimalism	social justice people tried to dethrone him so many times
2016-11-03 15:14:36	alyptik	i saw some SJW pull request other day LOL
2016-11-03 15:14:40	alyptik	to linux kernel
2016-11-03 15:14:44	minimalism	but you have to view him as like a dragon guarding the treasure
2016-11-03 15:15:06	minimalism	lol what did they try to do?
2016-11-03 15:15:21	alyptik	make README politically correct
2016-11-03 15:15:22	alyptik	lolololol
2016-11-03 15:17:50	alyptik	here: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/156
2016-11-03 15:18:15	alyptik	was all in good fun though, just a joke
2016-11-03 15:18:21	alyptik	i hope at least
2016-11-03 15:24:00		[15:18]
2016-11-03 15:36:00		[15:30]
2016-11-03 15:40:14	minimalism	lol I just verified it's a troll
2016-11-03 15:40:17	minimalism	but I
2016-11-03 15:40:21	minimalism	've seen some ridiculous ones
2016-11-03 15:40:38	minimalism	usually about gender neutral bs, and wanting master/slave in databases removed in favor of leader/follower because das racis
2016-11-03 15:41:09	minimalism	it comes as no surprise it was all white women, black guys, and a few very beta white men supporting it but only because they're completely whipped
2016-11-03 15:42:55	minimalism	hahahaha I just remembered a favorite of mine
2016-11-03 15:43:03	minimalism	I found it by clicking a few links from that one you linked
2016-11-03 15:43:07	minimalism	https://github.com/letsgetrandy/DICSS
2016-11-03 15:43:12	minimalism	this one really rustled some jimmies
2016-11-03 15:45:05	minimalism	also, I'm 99% sure that issue/feminist software foundation is /g/'s troll group
2016-11-03 15:45:10	minimalism	they made C+= too
2016-11-03 15:46:02	minimalism	https://github.com/letsgetrandy/DICSS/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen
2016-11-03 15:46:13	minimalism	you have no idea how many angry issues there were from people whining about how it's not funny
2016-11-03 15:46:15	minimalism	and sexist
2016-11-03 15:46:24	minimalism	they seem to have been deleted now since it's actual software lol
2016-11-03 15:46:35	minimalism	it is by all means a joke, but the fun is that it's real
2016-11-03 15:46:39	minimalism	and they can't do anything about it
2016-11-03 15:47:03	minimalism	it's almost like that ep of South Park where Cartman has Tourette's
2016-11-03 15:47:12	minimalism	and he can say whatever he fucking wants anytime anywhere
2016-11-03 15:47:22	minimalism	and other people just can't do anything about it because it's an illness
2016-11-03 15:48:51	minimalism	it's just too good how he taunted them
2016-11-03 15:48:56	minimalism	playing it off like it's serious software
2016-11-03 15:49:22	minimalism	it was like one child just saying all these terrible things in a very specific "okay" context
2016-11-03 15:49:26	minimalism	right in front of an adult or a teacher
2016-11-03 15:49:35	minimalism	and the other children are mad and there's just nothing that can be done
2016-11-03 15:52:19	minimalism	hahaha I found them

2016-11-03 16:00:00		[15:54]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:06:11] like memory management and all [01:06:11]
2016-11-03 22:49:44		[22:49]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:06:42] Any of it really [01:06:42]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:06:52] Like.. you know how your memory usage displayed it sometimes not accurate [01:06:52]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:06:59] like it's not actually being used [01:06:59]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:07:02] it just wasn't cleared [01:07:02]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:07:17] I didn't understand what C meant by garbage collection or memory management at all [01:07:17]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:07:25] until I started using more advanced nix and witnessing these things [01:07:25]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:07:32] to really know its connection to hardware [01:07:32]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:07:41] how can you really write C without understanding the machine itself? [01:07:41]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:07:51] if you do, it's probably pitiful code [01:07:51]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:08:12] either way though.. the system is all that really interests me [01:08:12]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:08:26] the code I feel is more of just something that may happen during my adventures with the machine [01:08:26]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:08:48] right [01:08:48]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:08:56] people argue against gentoo being a waste of time, but I mean really [01:08:56]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:09:07] anyone using this OS knows more than archers unless said archers also used gentoo at one point [01:09:07]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:09:17] and a lot of them did [01:09:17]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:09:56] that's why I really resent the gentoo bashing [01:09:56]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:10:07] they're like "it's a waste of time/text flying by for hours" etc. [01:10:07]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:10:14] when they received the benefit of the knowledge already [01:10:14]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:10:20] but the people who haven't used gentoo haven't yet [01:10:20]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:10:54] I could still give arch the seal of approval if it weren't using systemd [01:10:54]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:10:57] but it is, so I can't [01:10:57]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:11:19] aside from that one detail, it's a fantastic OS [01:11:19]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:11:25] if it were supported by default [01:11:25]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:11:28] it'd be fantastic [01:11:28]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:12:42] it's no wonder Linus gets mad [01:12:42]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:12:56] his knowledge is from a time before all the ease of use we have now [01:12:56]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:12:59] so it's really close to the metal [01:12:59]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:14:07] yeah, I know.. and the worst part is [01:14:07]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:14:13] people constantly complain and try to get him fired [01:14:13]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:14:16] because of his attitude [01:14:16]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:14:22] social justice people tried to dethrone him so many times [01:14:22]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:14:44] but you have to view him as like a dragon guarding the treasure [01:14:44]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:15:06] lol what did they try to do? [01:15:06]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:40:14] lol I just verified it's a troll [01:40:14]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:40:17] but I [01:40:17]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:40:21] 've seen some ridiculous ones [01:40:21]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:40:38] usually about gender neutral bs, and wanting master/slave in databases removed in favor of leader/follower because das racis [01:40:38]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:41:09] it comes as no surprise it was all white women, black guys, and a few very beta white men supporting it but only because they're completely whipped [01:41:09]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:42:55] hahahaha I just remembered a favorite of mine [01:42:55]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:43:03] I found it by clicking a few links from that one you linked [01:43:03]

2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:43:12] this one really rustled some jimmies [01:43:12]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:45:05] also, I'm 99% sure that issue/feminist software foundation is /g/'s troll group [01:45:05]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:45:10] they made C+= too [01:45:10]

2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:46:13] you have no idea how many angry issues there were from people whining about how it's not funny [01:46:13]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:46:15] and sexist [01:46:15]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:46:24] they seem to have been deleted now since it's actual software lol [01:46:24]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:46:35] it is by all means a joke, but the fun is that it's real [01:46:35]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:46:39] and they can't do anything about it [01:46:39]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:47:03] it's almost like that ep of South Park where Cartman has Tourette's [01:47:03]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:47:12] and he can say whatever he fucking wants anytime anywhere [01:47:12]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:47:22] and other people just can't do anything about it because it's an illness [01:47:22]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:48:51] it's just too good how he taunted them [01:48:51]
2016-11-03 22:49:44	minimalism	[01:48:56] playing it off like it's serious software [01:48:56]

2016-11-04 12:57:34	minimalism	.
2016-11-04 12:57:34		[12:57]
2016-11-04 12:57:46	minimalism	alpine's default cron is better than the ones available elsewhere
2016-11-04 12:59:15	alyptik	is it just frond?
2016-11-04 12:59:20	alyptik	is it just crond*
2016-11-04 13:01:34	minimalism	well it's *a* crond
2016-11-04 13:01:42	minimalism	but its file structure is different
2016-11-04 13:01:48	alyptik	how so?
2016-11-04 13:01:53	minimalism	it has /etc/crontabs/ and /periodic/*
2016-11-04 13:02:08	minimalism	like /etc/crontabs/<user>
2016-11-04 13:02:09	alyptik	oo
2016-11-04 13:02:16	minimalism	and /periodic/{hourly,weekly,monthly} like that
2016-11-04 13:02:20	minimalism	err
2016-11-04 13:02:25	minimalism	 /etc/periodic/*
2016-11-04 13:02:54	alyptik	rc-service is basically systemctl right
2016-11-04 13:02:59	minimalism	I'd have preferred /etc/cron/crontabs/<user> and /etc/cron/periodic/*, but heh
2016-11-04 13:03:01	minimalism	still way better
2016-11-04 13:03:03	alyptik	or should i be doing it with another command
2016-11-04 13:03:08	alyptik	enabling i mean
2016-11-04 13:03:11	minimalism	openrc has a few commands
2016-11-04 13:03:23	minimalism	to view services and status, you'd use
2016-11-04 13:03:24	alyptik	/etc/init.d/?
2016-11-04 13:03:26	minimalism	rc-status
2016-11-04 13:03:28	alyptik	oh
2016-11-04 13:03:28	minimalism	like rc-status -a
2016-11-04 13:03:38	minimalism	you can use /etc/init.d as well but the openrc commands are like a shortcut
2016-11-04 13:03:46	alyptik	ahh gotcha
2016-11-04 13:03:55	minimalism	like rc-service openvpn start
2016-11-04 13:03:58	minimalism	stop
2016-11-04 13:04:00	minimalism	restart
2016-11-04 13:04:02	minimalism	etc.
2016-11-04 13:04:17	alyptik	rc-update add * default is enable serv right
2016-11-04 13:04:21	minimalism	then there's rc-update add,del,show servicename
2016-11-04 13:04:44	minimalism	then you can end it with runlevel
2016-11-04 13:04:46	minimalism	like boot
2016-11-04 13:04:49	minimalism	shutdown
2016-11-04 13:04:54	minimalism	if you don't specify one
2016-11-04 13:04:56	minimalism	it goes to default
2016-11-04 13:04:59	alyptik	ah gotcha
2016-11-04 13:05:04	minimalism	it's way better than systemd
2016-11-04 13:05:07	minimalism	it's just so much simpler
2016-11-04 13:05:12	minimalism	one dir with the init scripts
2016-11-04 13:05:16	minimalism	and basic commands
2016-11-04 13:05:55	alyptik	gonna try booting into gentoo after youcompleteme finishes compiling
2016-11-04 13:07:04	minimalism	schwing
2016-11-04 13:07:08	minimalism	just found out what alpine's cron is
2016-11-04 13:07:11	minimalism	busybox
2016-11-04 13:07:15	minimalism	busybox crond
2016-11-04 13:07:23	minimalism	it's enabled too in gentoo's default savedconfig for busybox
2016-11-04 13:07:39	alyptik	lol wut
2016-11-04 13:07:44	minimalism	yeah
2016-11-04 13:07:50	alyptik	my busybox on router has no cron
2016-11-04 13:07:51	alyptik	:[
2016-11-04 13:09:29	alyptik	lol in my server access log:

2016-11-04 13:10:17	minimalism	talking to someone in #alpine-linux about it
2016-11-04 13:10:25	minimalism	trying to get clarification on how they got it going
2016-11-04 13:10:28	alyptik	someone trying to run shellcode LOL 
2016-11-04 13:10:34	minimalism	wat
2016-11-04 13:10:40	minimalism	are you saying someone tried to hack your router?
2016-11-04 13:10:49	alyptik	nah this is my pub facing nginx server
2016-11-04 13:10:54	alyptik	it comes with the territory
2016-11-04 13:11:02	minimalism	so where did they try to run this code
2016-11-04 13:11:05	alyptik	it's as common as ssh scanning
2016-11-04 13:11:15	alyptik	it is put into an HTTP GET request
2016-11-04 13:11:21	minimalism	ah, I see
2016-11-04 13:11:27	minimalism	why would they think that would work
2016-11-04 13:11:37	alyptik	it works for some computers
2016-11-04 13:11:49	alyptik	ones without stack memory randomization etc
2016-11-04 13:11:50	minimalism	well it'd have to be the worst configured and worst operating system there is, I'd think
2016-11-04 13:11:54	minimalism	like really archaic
2016-11-04 13:11:59	alyptik	pretty much you ar eright
2016-11-04 13:12:08	alyptik	the sec features are default since like 3.5
2016-11-04 13:12:17	minimalism	there's safeguards for that sort of thing pretty much everywhere now
2016-11-04 13:12:22	alyptik	yep
2016-11-04 13:13:01	alyptik	i have HSTS anyway
2016-11-04 13:13:01		[13:13]
2016-11-04 13:13:08	alyptik	so HTTP GETS all fail
2016-11-04 13:13:09	minimalism	we need to figure out this busybox crond man
2016-11-04 13:13:25	minimalism	it's so simple and enabled by default in the busybox savedconfig
2016-11-04 13:13:32	alyptik	idk what i would even cron tho
2016-11-04 13:13:32	minimalism	saves the trouble of installing anything additional
2016-11-04 13:13:47	minimalism	oh yeah, trimmed my kernel this morning
2016-11-04 13:14:05	minimalism	got some stuff removed that I've been meaning to do like hibernation/sleep/suspension in tty
2016-11-04 13:14:14	minimalism	removed the last module =m in there with localyesconfig
2016-11-04 13:14:48	minimalism	There's still more to remove, but I need to do more reading
2016-11-04 13:15:24	minimalism	I was removing firmware files from the linux-firmware savedconfig as well
2016-11-04 13:15:33	minimalism	I found myself in the linux kernel source repository on github
2016-11-04 13:16:38	alyptik	localyesconfig keeps failing for me
2016-11-04 13:16:43	alyptik	trying localmodconfig 
2016-11-04 13:17:13	minimalism	what's so nice about this is
2016-11-04 13:17:20	minimalism	I don't need to bother blacklisting modules
2016-11-04 13:17:22	alyptik	is this anything for youy
2016-11-04 13:17:24	minimalism	because they don't exist to begin with
2016-11-04 13:17:24	alyptik	7����j}Rd����p%�eO7�x�%J     �<n��O�VN���E�����ܫ����o�%
2016-11-04 13:17:30	alyptik	or just garbage
2016-11-04 13:17:34	minimalism	some valid characters but it's all broken boxes mostly
2016-11-04 13:17:45	alyptik	ah ok prob non printing chars
2016-11-04 13:17:54	alyptik	trying to figure out what they were trying to do lol
2016-11-04 13:17:55	minimalism	might be my fonts too, who knows
2016-11-04 13:18:09	minimalism	they were trying to dick your machine
2016-11-04 13:19:10	minimalism	no symlink or whatever to crond on busybox gentoo, but
2016-11-04 13:19:15	minimalism	it's in currently defined functions for busybox
2016-11-04 13:19:23	minimalism	Currently defined functions:
2016-11-04 13:19:25	minimalism	 [, [[, acpid, addgroup, adduser, adjtimex, ar, arp, arping, ash, awk, base64, basename, bb, bbconfig,
2016-11-04 13:19:27	minimalism	 bbsh, blkid, blockdev, brctl, bunzip2, bzcat, bzip2, cal, cat, catv, chat, chattr, chgrp, chmod, chown,
2016-11-04 13:19:29	minimalism	 chpasswd, chpst, chroot, chrt, chvt, cksum, clear, cmp, comm, conspy, cp, cpio, crond,
2016-11-04 13:19:33	alyptik	yeah but shellcode is pretty interesting
2016-11-04 13:19:40	alyptik	to me at least
2016-11-04 13:19:55	minimalism	what I find most appealing are shell and C
2016-11-04 13:20:05	minimalism	I like really clean pure ruby for web stuff, but that's it
2016-11-04 13:20:10	minimalism	anything else I just don't care for
2016-11-04 13:20:36	minimalism	I only like pure clean readable ruby for the web because it's just that, and sometimes with the web
2016-11-04 13:20:43	minimalism	you need to alter things quickly, it's not a versioned release
2016-11-04 13:20:50	minimalism	it needs to be a readable and maintainable codebase
2016-11-04 13:21:48	alyptik	well shellcode is shell
2016-11-04 13:21:51	alyptik	just in hex formal lol
2016-11-04 13:27:00		[13:21]
2016-11-04 13:39:14	alyptik	hah
2016-11-04 13:39:48	alyptik	!-/bin/sh 
2016-11-04 13:40:12	alyptik	not sure how that would work but i guess it does somehow

2016-11-04 14:11:12	minimalism	[23:03:28] like rc-status -a [23:03:28]
2016-11-04 14:11:12	minimalism	[23:03:38] you can use /etc/init.d as well but the openrc commands are like a shortcut [23:03:38]
2016-11-04 14:11:12	minimalism	[23:03:55] like rc-service openvpn start [23:03:55]

2016-11-04 14:11:12	minimalism	[23:04:20] then there's rc-update add,del,show servicename [23:04:20]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:04:44] then you can end it with runlevel [23:04:44]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:04:46] like boot [23:04:46]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:04:49] shutdown [23:04:49]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:04:53] if you don't specify one [23:04:53]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:04:56] it goes to default [23:04:56]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:05:04] it's way better than systemd [23:05:04]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:05:07] it's just so much simpler [23:05:07]

2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:07:08] just found out what alpine's cron is [23:07:08]

2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:07:44] yeah [23:07:44]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:10:17] talking to someone in #alpine-linux about it [23:10:17]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:10:25] trying to get clarification on how they got it going [23:10:25]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:10:34] wat [23:10:34]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:10:40] are you saying someone tried to hack your router? [23:10:40]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:11:02] so where did they try to run this code [23:11:02]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:11:21] ah, I see [23:11:21]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:11:27] why would they think that would work [23:11:27]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:11:50] well it'd have to be the worst configured and worst operating system there is, I'd think [23:11:50]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:11:54] like really archaic [23:11:54]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:12:17] there's safeguards for that sort of thing pretty much everywhere now [23:12:17]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:13:09] we need to figure out this busybox crond man [23:13:09]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:13:25] it's so simple and enabled by default in the busybox savedconfig [23:13:25]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:13:32] saves the trouble of installing anything additional [23:13:32]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:13:47] oh yeah, trimmed my kernel this morning [23:13:47]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:14:05] got some stuff removed that I've been meaning to do like hibernation/sleep/suspension in tty [23:14:05]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:14:14] removed the last module =m in there with localyesconfig [23:14:14]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:14:48] There's still more to remove, but I need to do more reading [23:14:48]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:15:24] I was removing firmware files from the linux-firmware savedconfig as well [23:15:24]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:15:33] I found myself in the linux kernel source repository on github [23:15:33]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:17:13] what's so nice about this is [23:17:13]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:17:20] I don't need to bother blacklisting modules [23:17:20]
2016-11-04 14:11:13	minimalism	[23:17:24] because they don't exist to begin with [23:17:24]

2016-11-04 14:59:33	minimalism	[00:02:03] no idea how to use them though [00:02:03]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:03:26] rc-status [23:03:26]
2016-11-04 15:15:43		[15:15]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:03:28] like rc-status -a [23:03:28]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:03:38] you can use /etc/init.d as well but the openrc commands are like a shortcut [23:03:38]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:03:55] like rc-service openvpn start [23:03:55]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:03:58] stop [23:03:58]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:04:00] restart [23:04:00]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:04:02] etc. [23:04:02]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:04:20] then there's rc-update add,del,show servicename [23:04:20]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:04:44] then you can end it with runlevel [23:04:44]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:04:46] like boot [23:04:46]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:04:49] shutdown [23:04:49]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:04:53] if you don't specify one [23:04:53]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:04:56] it goes to default [23:04:56]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:05:04] it's way better than systemd [23:05:04]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:05:07] it's just so much simpler [23:05:07]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:05:12] one dir with the init scripts [23:05:12]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:05:16] and basic commands [23:05:16]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:07:04] schwing [23:07:04]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:07:08] just found out what alpine's cron is [23:07:08]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:07:11] busybox [23:07:11]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:07:15] busybox crond [23:07:15]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:07:23] it's enabled too in gentoo's default savedconfig for busybox [23:07:23]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:07:44] yeah [23:07:44]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:10:17] talking to someone in #alpine-linux about it [23:10:17]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:10:25] trying to get clarification on how they got it going [23:10:25]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:10:34] wat [23:10:34]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:10:40] are you saying someone tried to hack your router? [23:10:40]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:11:02] so where did they try to run this code [23:11:02]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:11:21] ah, I see [23:11:21]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:11:27] why would they think that would work [23:11:27]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:11:50] well it'd have to be the worst configured and worst operating system there is, I'd think [23:11:50]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:11:54] like really archaic [23:11:54]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:12:17] there's safeguards for that sort of thing pretty much everywhere now [23:12:17]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:13:09] we need to figure out this busybox crond man [23:13:09]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:13:25] it's so simple and enabled by default in the busybox savedconfig [23:13:25]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:13:32] saves the trouble of installing anything additional [23:13:32]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:13:47] oh yeah, trimmed my kernel this morning [23:13:47]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:14:05] got some stuff removed that I've been meaning to do like hibernation/sleep/suspension in tty [23:14:05]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:14:14] removed the last module =m in there with localyesconfig [23:14:14]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:14:48] There's still more to remove, but I need to do more reading [23:14:48]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:15:24] I was removing firmware files from the linux-firmware savedconfig as well [23:15:24]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:15:33] I found myself in the linux kernel source repository on github [23:15:33]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:17:13] what's so nice about this is [23:17:13]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:17:20] I don't need to bother blacklisting modules [23:17:20]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:17:24] because they don't exist to begin with [23:17:24]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:17:34] some valid characters but it's all broken boxes mostly [23:17:34]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:17:55] might be my fonts too, who knows [23:17:55]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:18:09] they were trying to dick your machine [23:18:09]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:19:10] no symlink or whatever to crond on busybox gentoo, but [23:19:10]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:19:15] it's in currently defined functions for busybox [23:19:15]
2016-11-04 15:15:43	minimalism	[23:19:23] Currently defined functions: [23:19:23]

2016-11-04 15:15:44	minimalism	[23:19:55] what I find most appealing are shell and C [23:19:55]
2016-11-04 15:15:44	minimalism	[23:20:05] I like really clean pure ruby for web stuff, but that's it [23:20:05]
2016-11-04 15:15:44	minimalism	[23:20:09] anything else I just don't care for [23:20:09]
2016-11-04 15:15:44	minimalism	[23:20:35] I only like pure clean readable ruby for the web because it's just that, and sometimes with the web [23:20:35]
2016-11-04 15:15:44	minimalism	[23:20:43] you need to alter things quickly, it's not a versioned release [23:20:43]
2016-11-04 15:15:44	minimalism	[23:20:50] it needs to be a readable and maintainable codebase [23:20:50]

2016-11-04 16:11:00		[16:11]
2016-11-04 16:11:38	alyptik	none
2016-11-04 16:11:53	minimalism	I'm still trying to trim my kernel while I figure out this cron thing
2016-11-04 16:13:15	alyptik	i am just gonna stick with my bloated kernel
2016-11-04 16:13:20	alyptik	tired of trying to fix this lol

2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:07:08] just found out what alpine's cron is [23:07:08]

2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:07:23] it's enabled too in gentoo's default savedconfig for busybox [23:07:23]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:07:44] yeah [23:07:44]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:10:17] talking to someone in #alpine-linux about it [23:10:17]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:10:25] trying to get clarification on how they got it going [23:10:25]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:10:34] wat [23:10:34]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:10:40] are you saying someone tried to hack your router? [23:10:40]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:11:02] so where did they try to run this code [23:11:02]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:11:21] ah, I see [23:11:21]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:11:27] why would they think that would work [23:11:27]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:11:50] well it'd have to be the worst configured and worst operating system there is, I'd think [23:11:50]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:11:54] like really archaic [23:11:54]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:12:17] there's safeguards for that sort of thing pretty much everywhere now [23:12:17]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:13:09] we need to figure out this busybox crond man [23:13:09]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:13:25] it's so simple and enabled by default in the busybox savedconfig [23:13:25]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:13:32] saves the trouble of installing anything additional [23:13:32]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:13:47] oh yeah, trimmed my kernel this morning [23:13:47]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:14:05] got some stuff removed that I've been meaning to do like hibernation/sleep/suspension in tty [23:14:05]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:14:14] removed the last module =m in there with localyesconfig [23:14:14]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:14:48] There's still more to remove, but I need to do more reading [23:14:48]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:15:24] I was removing firmware files from the linux-firmware savedconfig as well [23:15:24]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:15:33] I found myself in the linux kernel source repository on github [23:15:33]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:17:13] what's so nice about this is [23:17:13]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:17:20] I don't need to bother blacklisting modules [23:17:20]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:17:24] because they don't exist to begin with [23:17:24]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:17:34] some valid characters but it's all broken boxes mostly [23:17:34]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:17:55] might be my fonts too, who knows [23:17:55]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:18:09] they were trying to dick your machine [23:18:09]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:19:10] no symlink or whatever to crond on busybox gentoo, but [23:19:10]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:19:15] it's in currently defined functions for busybox [23:19:15]

2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:20:05] I like really clean pure ruby for web stuff, but that's it [23:20:05]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:20:09] anything else I just don't care for [23:20:09]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:20:35] I only like pure clean readable ruby for the web because it's just that, and sometimes with the web [23:20:35]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:20:43] you need to alter things quickly, it's not a versioned release [23:20:43]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[23:20:50] it needs to be a readable and maintainable codebase [23:20:50]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[00:01:36] trying to get information on how to setup busybox crond [00:01:36]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[00:01:48] even gentoo wiki mentions a lot of busybox's applets can replace external utilities like dhcpcd [00:01:48]
2016-11-04 23:25:14	minimalism	[00:02:03] no idea how to use them though [00:02:03]

2016-11-05 12:48:24	minimalism	Do you have any experience with PAM?
2016-11-05 12:48:24		[12:48]
2016-11-05 13:18:39	alyptik	very veyr little
2016-11-05 13:18:39		[13:18]
2016-11-05 13:18:41	alyptik	how come
2016-11-05 13:18:57	minimalism	alpine doesn't have it by default and busybox's default config has PAM support disabled
2016-11-05 13:19:03	minimalism	I'm trying to get a grasp of what PAM really does
2016-11-05 13:19:09	minimalism	like if it's even at all necessary.. depending on context
2016-11-05 13:19:17	alyptik	it is like polkit
2016-11-05 13:19:20	minimalism	in my experience, it's mostly just password strength enforcement
2016-11-05 13:19:22	alyptik	the non systemd version
2016-11-05 13:19:41	alyptik	allows you to authenticate user for progreams
2016-11-05 13:19:44	alyptik	programs*
2016-11-05 13:19:56	alyptik	for example there is a dovecot PAM module to check email for your acccount
2016-11-05 13:20:02	minimalism	seems to be, and I've modified its files here and there based on hardening guides, however
2016-11-05 13:20:16	minimalism	yeah I'm not really understanding too well what it does
2016-11-05 13:20:25	alyptik	if your apps dont use PAM you dont really need it
2016-11-05 13:20:31	alyptik	usually the program will tell you if it does
2016-11-05 13:20:36	minimalism	well this is on a production server using alpine
2016-11-05 13:20:41	minimalism	which absolutely does not have PAM
2016-11-05 13:20:42	alyptik	running what though
2016-11-05 13:20:45	minimalism	but all the typical permissions
2016-11-05 13:20:45	alyptik	mail server?
2016-11-05 13:20:48	minimalism	like what uses root
2016-11-05 13:20:51	minimalism	no, it's a full thing
2016-11-05 13:20:55	minimalism	ruby app with redis DB
2016-11-05 13:20:59	alyptik	redis?
2016-11-05 13:21:01	minimalism	and opensmtpd for mail
2016-11-05 13:21:15	alyptik	what is opensmtpd  auth
2016-11-05 13:21:17	alyptik	the method i mean
2016-11-05 13:21:25	minimalism	no idea.. haven't used it before
2016-11-05 13:21:32	minimalism	it's something I'm adding to the app to send out mail
2016-11-05 13:21:37	alyptik	like my postfix uses dovecot auth
2016-11-05 13:21:39	minimalism	it's an OpenBSD project though, fairly recent
2016-11-05 13:21:44	minimalism	it's really lean/trim
2016-11-05 13:21:46	alyptik	which in turn auths form a mariadb
2016-11-05 13:21:47	minimalism	secure as they say
2016-11-05 13:21:59	alyptik	you prob have to pick a method when you setup
2016-11-05 13:22:05	alyptik	i doubt PAM is required tho
2016-11-05 13:22:09	alyptik	just avallable
2016-11-05 13:22:18	minimalism	I really don't understand its purpose
2016-11-05 13:22:24	minimalism	PAM is present on gentoo and has a ton of policies
2016-11-05 13:22:27	alyptik	it is an auth method
2016-11-05 13:22:28	minimalism	it was absolutely used on arch
2016-11-05 13:22:37	alyptik	so when i try to send mail as alyptik@mini
2016-11-05 13:22:41	minimalism	you say that, but I just don't know what you mean based on the context
2016-11-05 13:22:44	alyptik	how do you know alyptik is a real user
2016-11-05 13:22:59	alyptik	PAM module handles that
2016-11-05 13:23:20	minimalism	well on gentoo
2016-11-05 13:23:27	minimalism	these same packages all have pam USE enabled
2016-11-05 13:23:49	minimalism	not redis, but opensmtpd does
2016-11-05 13:24:03	alyptik	yea there is prob a mariadb flag too
2016-11-05 13:24:08	alyptik	or other similar thing
2016-11-05 13:24:19	minimalism	nah
2016-11-05 13:24:22	minimalism	mta and pam
2016-11-05 13:24:24	minimalism	that's it
2016-11-05 13:25:01	alyptik	oh i guess it can only auth with pam then
2016-11-05 13:25:02	minimalism	opensmtpd added "/etc/pam.d/smtpd" on gentoo
2016-11-05 13:25:03	alyptik	prob required
2016-11-05 13:25:10	minimalism	well that's just it..
2016-11-05 13:25:13	alyptik	https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/whatispam.html
2016-11-05 13:25:16	minimalism	opensmtpd is an official package on alpine
2016-11-05 13:25:24	alyptik	lol i read that as what i spam
2016-11-05 13:25:24	minimalism	yet pam is not default on alpine at all, or really even supported to begin with
2016-11-05 13:25:58	minimalism	I know that part
2016-11-05 13:26:04	minimalism	I used PAM to enforce password rules
2016-11-05 13:26:07	minimalism	and number of tries
2016-11-05 13:26:20	minimalism	afaik, on alpine you access password db directly since there is no PAM
2016-11-05 13:26:28	minimalism	but I'm still just not really grasping it based on explanation
2016-11-05 13:26:38	minimalism	is it like a middleman just kind of playing guard between the user and password db?
2016-11-05 13:26:43	alyptik	think of it as alternative to /etc/passwd
2016-11-05 13:26:52	alyptik	more modular/customizable version
2016-11-05 13:27:01	minimalism	but /etc/passwd remains in use even with PAM
2016-11-05 13:27:10	alyptik	not for system
2016-11-05 13:27:13	alyptik	for programs
2016-11-05 13:27:19	alyptik	it isn't a system wide thing
2016-11-05 13:28:11	minimalism	apparently alpine has been using SHA512 hashing for quite a long time
2016-11-05 13:28:35	minimalism	With only 3 users including root (which would be disabled)
2016-11-05 13:28:43	minimalism	and a lot of strong passwords and permission restrictions on files
2016-11-05 13:28:49	minimalism	maybe not having PAM isn't a problem
2016-11-05 13:28:57	alyptik	tbh PAM is too complicated for me
2016-11-05 13:29:01	alyptik	i just stick with passwd
2016-11-05 13:29:10	minimalism	that's what I don't get though.. on arch
2016-11-05 13:29:14	minimalism	passwd was absolutely being used
2016-11-05 13:29:19	minimalism	but PAM was active as well
2016-11-05 13:29:23	alyptik	for what
2016-11-05 13:29:24	minimalism	it was enforcing authentication rules
2016-11-05 13:29:35	alyptik	on my system PAM is only used for polkit/DEs
2016-11-05 13:29:40	minimalism	hm
2016-11-05 13:29:53	alyptik	well a lot of things use polkit
2016-11-05 13:29:54	minimalism	what I've observed is it just plays defense for passwd and shadow
2016-11-05 13:29:56	alyptik	i guess
2016-11-05 13:30:20	minimalism	damn this is annoying
2016-11-05 13:30:28	minimalism	alpine is super secure in other ways, but this PAM thing is tripping me up
2016-11-05 13:31:43	alyptik	http://wiki2.dovecot.org/PasswordDatabase/PAM
2016-11-05 13:31:55	alyptik	"This is the most common way to authenticate system users nowadays. PAM is not itself a password database, but rather its configuration tells the system how exactly to do the authentication. Usually this means using the pam_unix.so module, which authenticates user from the system's shadow password file. "
2016-11-05 13:32:40	alyptik	i guess it is like an API to access shadow
2016-11-05 13:33:18	minimalism	see, that's what I meant
2016-11-05 13:33:21	minimalism	it's not a db for passwords
2016-11-05 13:33:25	minimalism	it's like a guard
2016-11-05 13:33:41	minimalism	because I'm really familiar with all the changes that occur to passwd, shadow, etc. as things happen
2016-11-05 13:33:41		[13:33]
2016-11-05 13:33:50	alyptik	so i guess it isnt needed
2016-11-05 13:34:09	minimalism	if it's not needed and doesn't cause any security issues, then that's great
2016-11-05 13:34:20	minimalism	I'd think though.. that if it's true that it's not really necessary
2016-11-05 13:34:26	minimalism	that it requires some precaution on the admin's end
2016-11-05 13:34:41	minimalism	so perm 400, 600, 700, etc.
2016-11-05 13:34:46	minimalism	on all files that need to be obscured
2016-11-05 13:34:56	alyptik	yeah
2016-11-05 13:35:03	minimalism	I already umask 077 on all users
2016-11-05 13:35:10	alyptik	lol 077
2016-11-05 13:35:20	alyptik	hardcore
2016-11-05 13:35:21	minimalism	Do you use 027 or something?
2016-11-05 13:35:24	alyptik	022
2016-11-05 13:35:29	minimalism	you should read this article
2016-11-05 13:35:41	minimalism	https://blogs.gentoo.org/mgorny/2011/10/18/027-umask-a-compromise-between-security-and-simplicity/
2016-11-05 13:35:51	minimalism	I like 077 because when I used arch, everything was as hardened as I could get it
2016-11-05 13:35:58	minimalism	have yet to fully harden gentoo, but getting there as I learn
2016-11-05 13:36:13	alyptik	oh this is on my local comp where idgaf about sec heh
2016-11-05 13:36:22	alyptik	on my server i use 027
2016-11-05 13:36:55	minimalism	077 on everything for me lol
2016-11-05 13:37:09	minimalism	I view my personal machine as like practice for the big game
2016-11-05 13:37:09	alyptik	that would prob be easier
2016-11-05 13:37:12	minimalism	(production)
2016-11-05 13:37:20	alyptik	but i use a lot of weird users/gorups like vmail
2016-11-05 13:37:28	alyptik	groups*
2016-11-05 13:38:52	minimalism	bet I could make alpine even less on memory if I did a custom kernel
2016-11-05 13:39:09	minimalism	lot of trouble though, and I'm not experienced enough with custom kernel to really do that with production
2016-11-05 13:39:37	minimalism	20 MiB RAM at all times though
2016-11-05 13:39:47	minimalism	Alpine is the ideal seedbox, or anything cloud really
2016-11-05 13:41:33	minimalism	I hate the NSA.. but I'm gonna read my NSA RHEL Hardening guide again for this server
2016-11-05 13:41:36	minimalism	and this other one I just found
2016-11-05 13:41:38	minimalism	http://www.puschitz.com/SecuringLinux.shtml
2016-11-05 13:43:48	alyptik	oo
2016-11-05 13:45:13	minimalism	that guide is old af, but it may have some timeless advice
2016-11-05 13:45:46	minimalism	https://ptpb.pw/AD7ihXOvMPmnC5u58UYZuPtOMCoH.pdf
2016-11-05 13:45:54	minimalism	file will expire in about 90 seconds
2016-11-05 13:48:23	alyptik	wot
2016-11-05 13:48:36	alyptik	how do you make ptpb files expire
2016-11-05 13:49:33	minimalism	I commented to sudokode once ptpb should be a temp host like any other good host so it's not a cookie jar of old information basically
2016-11-05 13:49:33		[13:49]
2016-11-05 13:49:39	minimalism	and now there's a feature called sunset
2016-11-05 13:49:48	minimalism	"-F sunset=120"
2016-11-05 13:49:51	minimalism	n in seconds
2016-11-05 13:50:40	alyptik	neat
2016-11-05 13:56:00		[13:50]
2016-11-05 17:11:30	minimalism	fuggg
2016-11-05 17:11:30		[17:11]
2016-11-05 17:11:36	minimalism	long list of modules on alpine
2016-11-05 17:11:40	minimalism	gotta blacklist on here
2016-11-05 17:17:00		[17:11]
2016-11-05 18:44:34	alyptik	how come
2016-11-05 18:44:34		[18:44]
2016-11-06 00:47:38	minimalism	because I imagine they're costing memory if they're loaded
2016-11-06 00:47:38		[00:47]
2016-11-06 00:49:15	alyptik	that's true
2016-11-06 00:49:19	alyptik	i prob have a lot of useless ones
2016-11-06 00:50:55	minimalism	if Alpine is at 20 MiB RAM used
2016-11-06 00:51:04	minimalism	I bet most of that is modules with this many loaded
2016-11-06 00:52:35	minimalism	thinking about this whole IOMMU thing and what it is
2016-11-06 00:52:42	minimalism	someone mentioned it earlier, and I have it enabled in kernel
2016-11-06 00:58:00		[00:52]
2016-11-06 01:05:10	alyptik	iommu?
2016-11-06 01:05:14	alyptik	tbh no idea
2016-11-06 01:05:24	alyptik	i vaguely read about it looking at qemu
2016-11-06 01:05:26	alyptik	no idea wtf it is
2016-11-06 01:11:00		[01:05]
2016-11-06 01:45:39	minimalism	well it has something to do with virt, but I'm not too sure
2016-11-06 01:45:39		[01:45]
2016-11-06 01:48:17	minimalism	kernel seems to have IOMMU enabled, but wikipedia leads me to believe my hardware does not support it
2016-11-06 01:48:28	minimalism	like it mentions same model number intel CPUs, but not my specific variant
2016-11-06 01:48:32	minimalism	and same thing with the mobo
2016-11-06 01:48:37	minimalism	others in the line but not mine
2016-11-06 01:54:00		[01:48]
2016-11-06 01:54:59	minimalism	weird
2016-11-06 01:55:04	minimalism	someone must have mentioned IOMMU
2016-11-06 01:55:16	minimalism	I don't know how it entered my mind, because I can't find it again in aot
2016-11-06 02:01:00		[01:55]
