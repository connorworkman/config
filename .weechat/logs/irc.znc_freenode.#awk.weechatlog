2016-10-17 21:03:36	hugo_	[17:31:49] i need to get some values with awk. i have a file with this kind of values ==> "My string A", "My string B", 0, 0.000%, 0.000%, 604800, 99.000%, 100.000%, 604800, 100.000%, 100.000%, [17:31:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	hugo_	[17:31:57] it is not entire line [17:31:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	hugo_	[17:32:10] i would like to get this output with awk command =>        My string A:My string B:99.000% [17:32:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	hugo_	[17:32:36] 99.000% is the 7rd filed (,) [17:32:36]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	hugo_	[17:32:43] it is a csv file [17:32:43]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	mute	[17:33:02] quoted... won't be easy if those quoted ones have commas [17:33:02]

2016-10-17 21:03:36	hugo_	[17:33:06] how to get that ? [17:33:06]

2016-10-17 21:03:36	yitz	[17:46:50] And spaces don't get cleaned up well [17:46:50]

2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[17:55:50] Still, that fails as soon as one of the strings contain comma [17:55:50]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	yitz	[18:02:31] o.O nifty. I had no clue you could do that to OFS [18:02:31]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[18:49:40] You can do it to any variables. Useful if you need to read multiple files that use different separators [18:49:40]

2016-10-18 00:14:23	hugo_	[17:32:43] it is a csv file [17:32:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	mute	[17:33:02] quoted... won't be easy if those quoted ones have commas [17:33:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[17:33:03] Don't cross post, please [17:33:03]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	hugo_	[17:33:06] how to get that ? [17:33:06]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	mute	[17:34:32] vktec sent him here though [17:34:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[17:38:39] Oh. Fair enough [17:38:39]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[17:39:27] hugo_: awk -F 'BEGIN{OFS=":"} {print $1, $2, $7}' [17:39:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	mute	[17:42:52] seems to be missing something [17:42:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[17:46:43] -F, [17:46:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[17:46:50] And spaces don't get cleaned up well [17:46:50]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[17:47:04] -F', ' [17:47:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[17:51:04] (-v OFS=:) [17:51:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[17:51:42] or one of my favorite seemingly lesser known awk features: awk -F, '{print $1, $2, $7}' OFS=: filename [17:51:42]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	geirha	[17:55:50] Still, that fails as soon as one of the strings contain comma [17:55:50]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[18:02:31] o.O nifty. I had no clue you could do that to OFS [18:02:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	geirha	[18:49:40] You can do it to any variables. Useful if you need to read multiple files that use different separators [18:49:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	geirha	[18:50:21] awk 'script...' FS=, file.csv FS='\t' file.tsv [18:50:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Riviera	[19:12:41] yitz: while you are at it check gawk's -E [19:12:41]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[20:14:32] Interesting again [20:14:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[22:37:43] huh, my scripts works with gawk, nawk, busybox awk, but makes mawk segfault :-P [22:37:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[23:00:15] Either file a bug report or accept that mawk isn't really awk, emg [23:00:15]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[23:04:05] yeah it's the second time mawk hasn't worked with a script of mine :-/ [23:04:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[23:04:12] I really should file a bug report [23:04:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[23:04:15] or two [23:04:15]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[23:04:29] my current script has such attrocities as: 			times[FILENAME,f,$5,$6,inds[FILENAME,f,$5,$6]++] = time [23:04:29]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[23:07:22] ... awk may not be the best tool for you [23:07:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	dualbus	[05:20:46] axisys: is that the up-to-date mawk you're testing with, or the old debian version? [05:20:46]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	dualbus	[05:20:52] woops, I meant emg [05:20:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	xpt	[06:21:31] yitz: why not? I have written a script that uses 4 or 5 dimensional arrays and is working like a charm [06:21:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	xpt	[06:22:31] even on some "funny" awk version on IBM AIX [06:22:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	xpt	[06:23:06] and by "funny" I mean broken, does not even say on which awk implementation it's based [06:23:06]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	alxtb	[09:20:03] Hi, I have this awk command:          /Subnets/{f=0} f{print}; /Now performing 2280/ {f=1}' file.txt [09:20:03]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	alxtb	[09:20:23] It returns two columns [09:20:23]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	alxtb	[09:20:36] I want those two columns each output into individual files [09:20:36]

2016-10-18 00:14:23	linedash	[09:24:15] $1 for first column [09:24:15]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	alxtb	[09:24:16] or have I forgotten how awk works completely? [09:24:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	alxtb	[09:24:20] thanks [09:24:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	linedash	[09:24:21] $0 represents the whole line [09:24:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	alxtb	[09:24:25] thank you [09:24:25]

2016-10-18 23:55:23	mute	[23:53:56] awk can loop tho [23:53:56]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[23:58:22] I have to execute also shell commands in that loop like readline to read from a pipe [23:58:22]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[23:58:40] so no, I can't do everything with awk [23:58:40]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	nal1	[00:11:26] Celmor: awk can read from a pipe [00:11:26]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	nal1	[00:11:36] i mean, it can read from stdin using getline [00:11:36]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	mute	[00:14:08] too bad we'll never know since we'll never get the details of that task. [00:14:08]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[00:14:42] https://pastebin.com/qTGfgTKu [00:14:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[00:15:59] I wanted to improve on that code by calculating the hex number from the percentage (the floating number from perviously) [00:15:59]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	nal1	[00:16:03] you really want to rewrite that thing in awk mute ? [00:16:03]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[00:16:08] previously* [00:16:08]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[00:16:34] yeah, I pretty much have no idea where to begin rewriting it [00:16:34]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	nal1	[00:17:37] status bar stuff always needs to be as fast as possible, so yeah, one call to awk for everything is not a bad idea [00:17:37]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[00:17:58] that's the complication [00:17:58]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	mute	[00:33:43] i wrote one of these [00:33:43]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	mute	[00:33:50] sadly i cant find it [00:33:50]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	nal	[00:56:19] aw, i was gonna translate that into awk but there was a blackout [00:56:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[00:58:19] you still can ;) [00:58:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	nal	[02:06:57] im too tired now [02:06:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	nal	[02:07:53] http://dpaste.com/1CK10RR best attempt i guess? [02:07:53]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[02:11:51] nal, thanks, but I have some c code which may take less cpu cycles, still gonna consider your solution [02:11:51]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[02:12:03] http://sprunge.us/MegV [02:12:03]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	nal	[02:28:37] dont consider it, better to use c [02:28:37]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[02:29:41] yeah, my old code took 8 times the cpu cycles [02:29:41]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	mute	[02:31:30] sysinfo huh [02:31:30]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[02:31:58] yeah [02:31:58]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	alxtb	[08:35:55] Hi I'm trying to do this in bash: numLines= wc -l $ipFileLocation | awk '{print $1 -1}' [08:35:55]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	alxtb	[08:36:32] How do I assign the value to the bash variable as opposed to just printing it? [08:36:32]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	dualbus	[08:36:45] alxtb: that is a question for #bash [08:36:45]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	dualbus	[08:37:04] numLines=$(wc -l ...| awk ...) [08:37:04]

2016-10-18 23:55:23	iaj	[09:24:26] -v OFS=';' it seems [09:24:26]

2016-10-19 00:41:24	Celmor	[00:16:08] previously* [00:16:08]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	Celmor	[00:16:34] yeah, I pretty much have no idea where to begin rewriting it [00:16:34]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	nal1	[00:17:37] status bar stuff always needs to be as fast as possible, so yeah, one call to awk for everything is not a bad idea [00:17:37]

2016-10-19 03:14:44	Tahvok	Hey guys!
2016-10-19 03:15:40	Tahvok	I'm trying to retrieve mysql version. I need the number only (no dot version). ex: if you execute mysql -V you get: mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.6.27-76.0, for Linux (x86_64) using  6.0
2016-10-19 03:15:49	Tahvok	I need to get 5.6 from this string
2016-10-19 03:16:03	Tahvok	What I did is the following: mysql -V | awk '{print $5}' | awk -F. '{print $1 "." $2}'
2016-10-19 03:16:14	gnomon	Tahvok, that's a good start!
2016-10-19 03:16:28	Tahvok	It works. But I think there should be a way to combine this 2 awk commands?
2016-10-19 03:16:50	gnomon	Tahvok, definitely.  There are very few situations where it's better to have two awk commands piped into each other instead of a single command.
2016-10-19 03:17:23	gnomon	Tahvok, so, do you want to be talked through the process of figuring out how to combine them, or do you want a fully-formed answer to try out and discuss?
2016-10-19 03:18:04	Tahvok	I need an answer for work, but I would like to discuss the process as well
2016-10-19 03:18:23	gnomon	Sure thing.
2016-10-19 03:19:04	gnomon	(just a sec)
2016-10-19 03:19:11	Tahvok	np
2016-10-19 03:19:22	Tahvok	Thanks for helping out btw!
2016-10-19 03:20:32	gnomon	Tahvok, no problem.  (:   So, here's a first attempt that duplicates your logic but combines the two awk invocations into one:
2016-10-19 03:20:36	gnomon	# echo 'mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.6.27-76.0, for Linux (x86_64) using  6.0' | awk '{vn=$5; oFS=FS; FS="."; $0=$5; print $1 "." $2; FS=oFS}'
2016-10-19 03:20:37	shbot	gnomon: 5.6
2016-10-19 03:20:40	gnomon	Now, we can make that simpler.
2016-10-19 03:21:31	Tahvok	Why do you need to save the FS?
2016-10-19 03:22:02	gnomon	Tahvok, it's just good practice to restore mutable global state after you're done messing with it.
2016-10-19 03:22:18	gnomon	Not strictly necessary in this case because of the impending simplification, eg.:
2016-10-19 03:22:18		[03:22]
2016-10-19 03:22:21	gnomon	# echo 'mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.6.27-76.0, for Linux (x86_64) using  6.0' | awk '{vn=$5; split(vn,vn_segments,"."); print vn_segments[1] "." vn_segments[2]}'
2016-10-19 03:22:22	shbot	gnomon: 5.6
2016-10-19 03:23:03	Tahvok	for the awk? in case I have more commands? Or for the shell? Because if I understand correctly awk is a subprocess, so it does not affect the parent process (shell)
2016-10-19 03:23:11	gnomon	(that could be further simplified by removing the 'vn' variable altogether and putting $5 directly into the invocation of split(), but I wanted to do it one step at a time)
2016-10-19 03:24:25	gnomon	Tahvok, yes, it definitely does not affect the parent process.  Your mental model is completely correct there.  Resetting global state would be good for the rest of your awk program, and also potentially for the rest of your input data; if 'mysql -V' printed out more than one line, for example, it would be difficult to reason about the kind of output that would result from your program.
2016-10-19 03:24:27	Tahvok	from your example I understand that awk always cuts the string in $0 according to FS? I didn't know that
2016-10-19 03:24:58	gnomon	awk always processes $0 according to FS _at read time_, and there are a few actions that force a re-read, like assigning anything to the $0 variable.
2016-10-19 03:25:18	Tahvok	Good to know :)
2016-10-19 03:25:24	gnomon	So if you remove the '$0=$5' bit then there won't be any reprocessing, and the print statements won't work as expected.
2016-10-19 03:25:25	Tahvok	How split is better than this?
2016-10-19 03:25:45	gnomon	split() is better than messing with FS because it doesn't change global state.
2016-10-19 03:25:51	Tahvok	I see
2016-10-19 03:26:28	Tahvok	# echo 'mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.6.27-76.0, for Linux (x86_64) using  6.0' | awk '{split($5,vn_segments,"."); print vn_segments[1] "." vn_segments[2]}'
2016-10-19 03:26:28	shbot	Tahvok: 5.6
2016-10-19 03:26:33	Tahvok	Nice
2016-10-19 03:27:09	-->	marky1991 (~marky1991@unaffiliated/marky1991) has joined #awk
2016-10-19 03:27:20	gnomon	And of course you can golf that down, now that there's no need to distinguish 'vn' from 'vn_segments'
2016-10-19 03:27:41	gnomon	# echo 'mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.6.27-76.0, for Linux (x86_64) using  6.0' | awk '{split($5,vn,"."); print vn[1] "." vn[2]}'
2016-10-19 03:27:43	shbot	gnomon: 5.6
2016-10-19 03:27:58	gnomon	In this case that brevity may make it a bit easier to see the shape of the logic.
2016-10-19 03:28:17	Tahvok	Definitely
2016-10-19 03:28:22	gnomon	Or it may not, it depends on whether the reader knows the behaviour of the split() function.
