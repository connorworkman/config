2016-10-17 21:03:36	hugo_	[17:31:49] i need to get some values with awk. i have a file with this kind of values ==> "My string A", "My string B", 0, 0.000%, 0.000%, 604800, 99.000%, 100.000%, 604800, 100.000%, 100.000%, [17:31:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	hugo_	[17:31:57] it is not entire line [17:31:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	hugo_	[17:32:10] i would like to get this output with awk command =>        My string A:My string B:99.000% [17:32:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	hugo_	[17:32:36] 99.000% is the 7rd filed (,) [17:32:36]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	hugo_	[17:32:43] it is a csv file [17:32:43]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	mute	[17:33:02] quoted... won't be easy if those quoted ones have commas [17:33:02]

2016-10-17 21:03:36	hugo_	[17:33:06] how to get that ? [17:33:06]

2016-10-17 21:03:36	yitz	[17:46:50] And spaces don't get cleaned up well [17:46:50]

2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[17:55:50] Still, that fails as soon as one of the strings contain comma [17:55:50]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	yitz	[18:02:31] o.O nifty. I had no clue you could do that to OFS [18:02:31]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[18:49:40] You can do it to any variables. Useful if you need to read multiple files that use different separators [18:49:40]

2016-10-18 00:14:23	hugo_	[17:32:43] it is a csv file [17:32:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	mute	[17:33:02] quoted... won't be easy if those quoted ones have commas [17:33:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[17:33:03] Don't cross post, please [17:33:03]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	hugo_	[17:33:06] how to get that ? [17:33:06]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	mute	[17:34:32] vktec sent him here though [17:34:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[17:38:39] Oh. Fair enough [17:38:39]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[17:39:27] hugo_: awk -F 'BEGIN{OFS=":"} {print $1, $2, $7}' [17:39:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	mute	[17:42:52] seems to be missing something [17:42:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[17:46:43] -F, [17:46:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[17:46:50] And spaces don't get cleaned up well [17:46:50]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[17:47:04] -F', ' [17:47:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[17:51:04] (-v OFS=:) [17:51:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[17:51:42] or one of my favorite seemingly lesser known awk features: awk -F, '{print $1, $2, $7}' OFS=: filename [17:51:42]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	geirha	[17:55:50] Still, that fails as soon as one of the strings contain comma [17:55:50]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[18:02:31] o.O nifty. I had no clue you could do that to OFS [18:02:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	geirha	[18:49:40] You can do it to any variables. Useful if you need to read multiple files that use different separators [18:49:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	geirha	[18:50:21] awk 'script...' FS=, file.csv FS='\t' file.tsv [18:50:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Riviera	[19:12:41] yitz: while you are at it check gawk's -E [19:12:41]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[20:14:32] Interesting again [20:14:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[22:37:43] huh, my scripts works with gawk, nawk, busybox awk, but makes mawk segfault :-P [22:37:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[23:00:15] Either file a bug report or accept that mawk isn't really awk, emg [23:00:15]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[23:04:05] yeah it's the second time mawk hasn't worked with a script of mine :-/ [23:04:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[23:04:12] I really should file a bug report [23:04:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[23:04:15] or two [23:04:15]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[23:04:29] my current script has such attrocities as: 			times[FILENAME,f,$5,$6,inds[FILENAME,f,$5,$6]++] = time [23:04:29]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[23:07:22] ... awk may not be the best tool for you [23:07:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	dualbus	[05:20:46] axisys: is that the up-to-date mawk you're testing with, or the old debian version? [05:20:46]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	dualbus	[05:20:52] woops, I meant emg [05:20:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	xpt	[06:21:31] yitz: why not? I have written a script that uses 4 or 5 dimensional arrays and is working like a charm [06:21:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	xpt	[06:22:31] even on some "funny" awk version on IBM AIX [06:22:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	xpt	[06:23:06] and by "funny" I mean broken, does not even say on which awk implementation it's based [06:23:06]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	alxtb	[09:20:03] Hi, I have this awk command:          /Subnets/{f=0} f{print}; /Now performing 2280/ {f=1}' file.txt [09:20:03]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	alxtb	[09:20:23] It returns two columns [09:20:23]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	alxtb	[09:20:36] I want those two columns each output into individual files [09:20:36]

2016-10-18 00:14:23	linedash	[09:24:15] $1 for first column [09:24:15]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	alxtb	[09:24:16] or have I forgotten how awk works completely? [09:24:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	alxtb	[09:24:20] thanks [09:24:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	linedash	[09:24:21] $0 represents the whole line [09:24:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	alxtb	[09:24:25] thank you [09:24:25]

2016-10-18 23:55:23	mute	[23:53:56] awk can loop tho [23:53:56]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[23:58:22] I have to execute also shell commands in that loop like readline to read from a pipe [23:58:22]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[23:58:40] so no, I can't do everything with awk [23:58:40]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	nal1	[00:11:26] Celmor: awk can read from a pipe [00:11:26]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	nal1	[00:11:36] i mean, it can read from stdin using getline [00:11:36]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	mute	[00:14:08] too bad we'll never know since we'll never get the details of that task. [00:14:08]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[00:14:42] https://pastebin.com/qTGfgTKu [00:14:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[00:15:59] I wanted to improve on that code by calculating the hex number from the percentage (the floating number from perviously) [00:15:59]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	nal1	[00:16:03] you really want to rewrite that thing in awk mute ? [00:16:03]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[00:16:08] previously* [00:16:08]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[00:16:34] yeah, I pretty much have no idea where to begin rewriting it [00:16:34]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	nal1	[00:17:37] status bar stuff always needs to be as fast as possible, so yeah, one call to awk for everything is not a bad idea [00:17:37]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[00:17:58] that's the complication [00:17:58]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	mute	[00:33:43] i wrote one of these [00:33:43]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	mute	[00:33:50] sadly i cant find it [00:33:50]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	nal	[00:56:19] aw, i was gonna translate that into awk but there was a blackout [00:56:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[00:58:19] you still can ;) [00:58:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	nal	[02:06:57] im too tired now [02:06:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	nal	[02:07:53] http://dpaste.com/1CK10RR best attempt i guess? [02:07:53]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[02:11:51] nal, thanks, but I have some c code which may take less cpu cycles, still gonna consider your solution [02:11:51]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[02:12:03] http://sprunge.us/MegV [02:12:03]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	nal	[02:28:37] dont consider it, better to use c [02:28:37]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[02:29:41] yeah, my old code took 8 times the cpu cycles [02:29:41]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	mute	[02:31:30] sysinfo huh [02:31:30]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Celmor	[02:31:58] yeah [02:31:58]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	alxtb	[08:35:55] Hi I'm trying to do this in bash: numLines= wc -l $ipFileLocation | awk '{print $1 -1}' [08:35:55]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	alxtb	[08:36:32] How do I assign the value to the bash variable as opposed to just printing it? [08:36:32]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	dualbus	[08:36:45] alxtb: that is a question for #bash [08:36:45]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	dualbus	[08:37:04] numLines=$(wc -l ...| awk ...) [08:37:04]

2016-10-18 23:55:23	iaj	[09:24:26] -v OFS=';' it seems [09:24:26]

2016-10-19 00:41:24	Celmor	[00:16:08] previously* [00:16:08]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	Celmor	[00:16:34] yeah, I pretty much have no idea where to begin rewriting it [00:16:34]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	nal1	[00:17:37] status bar stuff always needs to be as fast as possible, so yeah, one call to awk for everything is not a bad idea [00:17:37]

2016-10-19 03:14:44	Tahvok	Hey guys!
2016-10-19 03:15:40	Tahvok	I'm trying to retrieve mysql version. I need the number only (no dot version). ex: if you execute mysql -V you get: mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.6.27-76.0, for Linux (x86_64) using  6.0
2016-10-19 03:15:49	Tahvok	I need to get 5.6 from this string
2016-10-19 03:16:03	Tahvok	What I did is the following: mysql -V | awk '{print $5}' | awk -F. '{print $1 "." $2}'
2016-10-19 03:16:14	gnomon	Tahvok, that's a good start!
2016-10-19 03:16:28	Tahvok	It works. But I think there should be a way to combine this 2 awk commands?
2016-10-19 03:16:50	gnomon	Tahvok, definitely.  There are very few situations where it's better to have two awk commands piped into each other instead of a single command.
2016-10-19 03:17:23	gnomon	Tahvok, so, do you want to be talked through the process of figuring out how to combine them, or do you want a fully-formed answer to try out and discuss?
2016-10-19 03:18:04	Tahvok	I need an answer for work, but I would like to discuss the process as well
2016-10-19 03:18:23	gnomon	Sure thing.
2016-10-19 03:19:04	gnomon	(just a sec)
2016-10-19 03:19:11	Tahvok	np
2016-10-19 03:19:22	Tahvok	Thanks for helping out btw!
2016-10-19 03:20:32	gnomon	Tahvok, no problem.  (:   So, here's a first attempt that duplicates your logic but combines the two awk invocations into one:
2016-10-19 03:20:36	gnomon	# echo 'mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.6.27-76.0, for Linux (x86_64) using  6.0' | awk '{vn=$5; oFS=FS; FS="."; $0=$5; print $1 "." $2; FS=oFS}'
2016-10-19 03:20:37	shbot	gnomon: 5.6
2016-10-19 03:20:40	gnomon	Now, we can make that simpler.
2016-10-19 03:21:31	Tahvok	Why do you need to save the FS?
2016-10-19 03:22:02	gnomon	Tahvok, it's just good practice to restore mutable global state after you're done messing with it.
2016-10-19 03:22:18	gnomon	Not strictly necessary in this case because of the impending simplification, eg.:
2016-10-19 03:22:18		[03:22]
2016-10-19 03:22:21	gnomon	# echo 'mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.6.27-76.0, for Linux (x86_64) using  6.0' | awk '{vn=$5; split(vn,vn_segments,"."); print vn_segments[1] "." vn_segments[2]}'
2016-10-19 03:22:22	shbot	gnomon: 5.6
2016-10-19 03:23:03	Tahvok	for the awk? in case I have more commands? Or for the shell? Because if I understand correctly awk is a subprocess, so it does not affect the parent process (shell)
2016-10-19 03:23:11	gnomon	(that could be further simplified by removing the 'vn' variable altogether and putting $5 directly into the invocation of split(), but I wanted to do it one step at a time)
2016-10-19 03:24:25	gnomon	Tahvok, yes, it definitely does not affect the parent process.  Your mental model is completely correct there.  Resetting global state would be good for the rest of your awk program, and also potentially for the rest of your input data; if 'mysql -V' printed out more than one line, for example, it would be difficult to reason about the kind of output that would result from your program.
2016-10-19 03:24:27	Tahvok	from your example I understand that awk always cuts the string in $0 according to FS? I didn't know that
2016-10-19 03:24:58	gnomon	awk always processes $0 according to FS _at read time_, and there are a few actions that force a re-read, like assigning anything to the $0 variable.
2016-10-19 03:25:18	Tahvok	Good to know :)
2016-10-19 03:25:24	gnomon	So if you remove the '$0=$5' bit then there won't be any reprocessing, and the print statements won't work as expected.
2016-10-19 03:25:25	Tahvok	How split is better than this?
2016-10-19 03:25:45	gnomon	split() is better than messing with FS because it doesn't change global state.
2016-10-19 03:25:51	Tahvok	I see
2016-10-19 03:26:28	Tahvok	# echo 'mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.6.27-76.0, for Linux (x86_64) using  6.0' | awk '{split($5,vn_segments,"."); print vn_segments[1] "." vn_segments[2]}'
2016-10-19 03:26:28	shbot	Tahvok: 5.6
2016-10-19 03:26:33	Tahvok	Nice
2016-10-19 03:27:09	-->	marky1991 (~marky1991@unaffiliated/marky1991) has joined #awk
2016-10-19 03:27:20	gnomon	And of course you can golf that down, now that there's no need to distinguish 'vn' from 'vn_segments'
2016-10-19 03:27:41	gnomon	# echo 'mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.6.27-76.0, for Linux (x86_64) using  6.0' | awk '{split($5,vn,"."); print vn[1] "." vn[2]}'
2016-10-19 03:27:43	shbot	gnomon: 5.6
2016-10-19 03:27:58	gnomon	In this case that brevity may make it a bit easier to see the shape of the logic.
2016-10-19 03:28:17	Tahvok	Definitely
2016-10-19 03:28:22	gnomon	Or it may not, it depends on whether the reader knows the behaviour of the split() function.

2016-10-19 14:34:39	jeffreylevesque	[20:24:03] have to double escape sometimes [20:24:03]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	jeffreylevesque	[20:24:30] accidentally removed it bc -u xxx:xxx is generated from a variable [20:24:30]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	jeffreylevesque	[20:27:22] now, i have:  awk -F\" '{if (/^OPTIONS[[:blank:]]?="/ && !/-u xxx:xxx/) sub(/-u[[:blank:]]*[a-zA-Z]{3}:[a-zA-Z]{3}/, "-u xxx:xxx", $1); print $1 "\"" $2"\""; else print $0}' some_file.txt [20:27:22]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	jeffreylevesque	[20:42:55] geirha: i got it, i think - ` awk -F\" '{if (/^OPTIONS[[:blank:]]?="/ && !/-u xxx:xxx/) sub(/-u[[:blank:]]*[a-zA-Z]{3}:[a-zA-Z]{3}/, "-u xxx:xxx", $1); print $1 "\"" $2"\""; else print $0}' some_file.txt [20:42:55]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	jeffreylevesque	[20:43:50] well almost [20:43:50]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	jeffreylevesque	[20:43:52] getting there [20:43:52]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	ritztech	[22:20:03] im trying to use awk instaed of sed in this case   sed -r 's/.*-- (.*)-0.*/\1/' [22:20:03]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	ritztech	[22:20:51] Beacuse every line i need to extract  text Between each section   so awk '{print $1","$4","---MAGIC SED----}'  lol [22:20:51]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Riviera	[22:23:57] That's not English, that's gibberish (both the English and the code). [22:23:57]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	ritztech	[22:25:40] this might work awk -F, '{sub(".*sent at:","",$1); print $1}' [22:25:40]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	ritztech	[22:36:33] looking better but now i just need to  put print $1 and such lol almost there [22:36:33]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	ritztech	[22:36:34] awk 'gsub(/.*at:|Observ.*/,"")' [22:36:34]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	izalove	[22:40:50] nice [22:40:50]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	izalove	[22:41:31] that's basically a portable   sed -nr 's/.*at:|Observ.*//' [22:41:31]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	izalove	[22:41:55] never thought about using gsub like that [22:41:55]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Riviera	[22:42:10] you meant /p, non? [22:42:10]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	izalove	[22:42:20] ah yes sure [22:42:20]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	izalove	[22:42:25] sorry forgot about that [22:42:25]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	izalove	[22:42:48] awk 'gsub(...)||1' [22:42:48]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Riviera	[22:43:11] now i am confused [22:43:11]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	izalove	[22:43:41] it was just an idea for doing sed -r '...' [22:43:41]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	izalove	[22:43:43] without -n [22:43:43]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Riviera	[22:44:08] ritztech's problem is solved, right? [22:44:08]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	ritztech	[22:44:43] well i had to working in sed  but i have fields to extract from 1 [22:44:43]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	ritztech	[22:44:47] print $1 [22:44:47]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	ritztech	[22:44:53] and that was part of $2 [22:44:53]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	ritztech	[22:52:12] awk -F ',' '{ print $1"," gsub(/.*at:| -.*/,""); print $1}' [22:52:12]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	ritztech	[22:52:45] but its throwing a newline [22:52:45]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Riviera	[22:54:25] I don't know if that's a "no" or a "yes" [22:54:25]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Riviera	[22:54:27] :) [22:54:27]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	ritztech	[22:55:20] ha pretty much a no almost there trying to figure it out [22:55:20]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	ritztech	[22:58:03] OKay finally got it. [22:58:03]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	ritztech	[22:58:06] awk -F ',' '{print $1"," gsub(/.*at:| -.*/,"") $1}' [22:58:06]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	izalove	[23:38:59] o.o [23:38:59]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	izalove	[23:39:56] # nawk '{ print $1 gsub(/xyz/,"") }' <<< xyz [23:39:56]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	shbot	[23:39:58] izalove: 1 [23:39:58]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	izalove	[23:40:00] # gawk '{ print $1 gsub(/xyz/,"") }' <<< xyz [23:40:00]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	shbot	[23:40:01] izalove: xyz1 [23:40:01]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	izalove	[23:40:03] # mawk '{ print $1 gsub(/xyz/,"") }' <<< xyz [23:40:03]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	shbot	[23:40:05] izalove: xyz1 [23:40:05]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	izalove	[23:41:02] i've never seen any code that uses print gsub like ritztech did [23:41:02]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Riviera	[00:02:24] izalove: There's this xkcd about the command line with the most punctuation characters, [00:02:24]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Riviera	[00:03:42] izalove: https://xkcd.com/1638/ [00:03:42]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Riviera	[00:04:01] izalove: (the img's title text) [00:04:01]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	izalove	[00:04:15] uuoc [00:04:15]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Riviera	[00:05:56] izalove: i used print gsub(/[[:punct:]]/, "&"), $0  (not really, i used a quotient of punctuation and length) [00:05:56]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Riviera	[00:06:14] izalove: not quite what ritztech did, but that's the closed i came in the last weeks 8) [00:06:14]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	izalove	[00:06:30] nice [00:06:30]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	izalove	[00:06:46] that's pretty clever [00:06:46]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Riviera	[00:07:15] closest* [00:07:15]

2016-10-19 20:40:04	jeffreylevesque	[20:24:03] have to double escape sometimes [20:24:03]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	jeffreylevesque	[20:24:30] accidentally removed it bc -u xxx:xxx is generated from a variable [20:24:30]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	jeffreylevesque	[20:27:22] now, i have:  awk -F\" '{if (/^OPTIONS[[:blank:]]?="/ && !/-u xxx:xxx/) sub(/-u[[:blank:]]*[a-zA-Z]{3}:[a-zA-Z]{3}/, "-u xxx:xxx", $1); print $1 "\"" $2"\""; else print $0}' some_file.txt [20:27:22]

2016-10-19 20:40:04	jeffreylevesque	[20:43:50] well almost [20:43:50]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	jeffreylevesque	[20:43:52] getting there [20:43:52]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	ritztech	[22:20:03] im trying to use awk instaed of sed in this case   sed -r 's/.*-- (.*)-0.*/\1/' [22:20:03]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	ritztech	[22:20:51] Beacuse every line i need to extract  text Between each section   so awk '{print $1","$4","---MAGIC SED----}'  lol [22:20:51]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	Riviera	[22:23:57] That's not English, that's gibberish (both the English and the code). [22:23:57]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	ritztech	[22:25:40] this might work awk -F, '{sub(".*sent at:","",$1); print $1}' [22:25:40]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	ritztech	[22:36:33] looking better but now i just need to  put print $1 and such lol almost there [22:36:33]

2016-10-19 20:40:04	izalove	[22:41:55] never thought about using gsub like that [22:41:55]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	Riviera	[22:42:10] you meant /p, non? [22:42:10]

2016-10-19 20:40:04	izalove	[22:43:41] it was just an idea for doing sed -r '...' [22:43:41]

2016-10-19 20:40:04	ritztech	[22:44:47] print $1 [22:44:47]

2016-10-20 22:57:58	_spk_	hello, thanks ttmrichter :)
2016-10-20 22:58:11	_spk_	..interesting to see the wiki is hosted on SDF :)
2016-10-20 22:59:07	_spk_	essentially I have a comma-separated list of firstname,lastname,emailaddress - I though it'd be very simple to process this in awk into the format that mailman wants it
2016-10-20 22:59:31	_spk_	which is firstname lastname <emailadress>

2016-10-20 23:11:54	_spk_	geirha: yeah, that's what is happening. I'm sorta confused how the source data ended up in that state but then again, I guess you never quite know what you're going to get supplied with...
2016-10-20 23:12:05	geirha	(shameless plug) With my loadable csv builtin for bash, it would be: while csv first last email; do printf '%s %s <%s>\n' "$first" "$last" "$email"; done < file.csv

2016-10-21 03:16:07	lunaphyte	hi.  i got some help here the other day with matching/filtering some input, and i've of course now found that the criteria has changed.  http://dpaste.com/049RJH6.txt
2016-10-21 03:16:50	lunaphyte	the first section was the original input, the second is the additional input
2016-10-21 03:17:49	lunaphyte	initially i was using this: $1 ~ /^[A-L][0-9]+$/
2016-10-21 03:18:49	lunaphyte	but of course it doesn't match numbers only, or fields with characters after the numbers [e.g. B23-Trk50]
2016-10-21 03:19:30	gnomon	lunaphyte, hmm.  What are the new criteria?
2016-10-21 03:19:59	lunaphyte	now i'm using NF==0{p=0} p{print} $1=="------"{p=1} - which seems to do ok, but it doens't feel terribly elegant, and it also requires a way to stop matching at the first blank line
2016-10-21 03:20:56	lunaphyte	gnomon: the criteria are to show just the rows in the "tables" - e.g. just show the port details
2016-10-21 03:21:36	lunaphyte	where a port can now be more than just ^[A-L][0-9]+$

2016-10-22 06:18:21	geirha	though ls already sorts the files, so using the original array would work too; just from 0 to n-1 in that case
2016-10-22 06:19:24	geirha	though parsing ls output at all is generally bad

2016-10-22 17:58:12	nal	nope, it's right
2016-10-22 17:58:24	Camusensei	so how should I understand it?
2016-10-22 17:58:32	nal	$"* means flatten the list
2016-10-22 17:59:47	Camusensei	oooh, that's dirty, you use the fact that " is not a valid character in shell variable names so that it doesn't get expanded? no, even if that were the case, the " would still require an ending quote
2016-10-22 17:59:54	Camusensei	I'm still puzzled
2016-10-22 18:00:32	Camusensei	I would understand if it were  awk -v 'w=$"*' '

2016-10-22 18:03:31	nal	unlike the bash manpage, this thing is legible and short
2016-10-22 18:05:21	Camusensei	I won't argue on this :p
2016-10-22 18:05:45	nal	anyway, it cant be made much faster, the dictionary is 30mb... so i'm gonna have to use another dictionary or cut this one up
2016-10-22 18:05:55	Camusensei	you should precompute your limit in your for loops,    for (i=1;i<=split($0,words,";" FS);i++)
2016-10-22 18:06:07	Camusensei	get the split($0,words,";" FS) in a var
2016-10-22 18:06:52	Camusensei	same thing, don't do toupper(w) for every word, store it in a var
2016-10-22 18:06:53	nal	ah right right
2016-10-22 18:08:13	Camusensei	for the rest of the code, I must be too tired, I don't understand it at all ^^' you're on your own there, sorry

2016-10-23 10:50:02	John[Lisbeth]	Okay
2016-10-23 10:50:17	John[Lisbeth]	So recently I am studying micro languages
2016-10-23 10:51:00	John[Lisbeth]	I use something called forth which is a language as well as a rpn calculator. Some versions of gnu dc give you a similar experience.
2016-10-23 10:51:29	John[Lisbeth]	The idea behind rpn is everything in the lang is a word
2016-10-23 10:51:41	John[Lisbeth]	words are separated by spaces
2016-10-23 10:52:07	John[Lisbeth]	so I might have a word called ?#!!677 but the symbols do not matter
2016-10-23 10:52:24	John[Lisbeth]	Each word is like a function or a method
2016-10-23 10:52:46	John[Lisbeth]	2 + 2 is written as 2 2 +
2016-10-23 10:55:30	John[Lisbeth]	Sorry typing on a phone and at work.
2016-10-23 10:56:33	John[Lisbeth]	2 adds 2 to a linked list. We write 2 again and now we have two 2s on a linked list. + Takes two things off a linked list and returns their sum
2016-10-23 10:57:10	John[Lisbeth]	This rpn language has a very short algorithm and so you can embed it in tiny environments
2016-10-23 10:59:58	John[Lisbeth]	I am thinking about using awk to interpret it because awk is available in most shells, busybox most importantly
2016-10-23 11:01:07	Riviera	John[Lisbeth]: Okay.
2016-10-23 11:01:58	izalove	you know what else is available in most shells?  shells
2016-10-23 11:02:07	John[Lisbeth]	what?
2016-10-23 11:02:07		[11:02]
2016-10-23 11:03:23	izalove	do it in shell
2016-10-23 11:03:29	John[Lisbeth]	O I see
2016-10-23 11:03:38	izalove	go big or go home
2016-10-23 11:03:50	John[Lisbeth]	not all env use same shell though
2016-10-23 11:04:05	John[Lisbeth]	many shell env besides windows have awk

2016-10-23 12:39:05	John[Lisbeth]	most systems that have awk come with shells
2016-10-23 12:39:20	John[Lisbeth]	but I see awk as a more universal platform because they all have approximately the same awk whereas they will have different shells
2016-10-23 12:39:47	John[Lisbeth]	There is also sed which I have not loked into as well as curl
2016-10-23 12:40:07	jetchisel	well, there is gawk and awk plus more :)
2016-10-23 12:40:21	John[Lisbeth]	My target is going to be busybox environments which do not have package managers
2016-10-23 12:40:50	John[Lisbeth]	I think I can get most compute tasks done with http so like wget
2016-10-23 12:41:23	John[Lisbeth]	My goal is to get a nice unix going on my phone. I have got this really nice shell called termux which gives me a shell on my phone as well as a basic busybox
2016-10-23 12:42:00	John[Lisbeth]	But I really need to get a forth in there because forth allows me to do alot of lispy type things like redefine anything in the language
2016-10-23 12:42:32	regain	John[Lisbeth]: POSIX cares, when talking about "universal"... busybox is not posix-conformant. busybox-awk has lot of bugs. busy-box programs has too little -options
2016-10-23 12:43:02	John[Lisbeth]	that causes potential problems

2016-10-23 12:44:31	John[Lisbeth]	perhaps I could work around the bugs
2016-10-23 12:44:40	John[Lisbeth]	but that would get tedious

2016-10-23 12:49:38	John[Lisbeth]	I want to use torrent and store small chunks of files on people's phones and pass them around
2016-10-23 12:52:04	regain	John[Lisbeth]: you can take .c source files, and cross-compile into arm. i do use arm-linux-androideabi-gcc... but people use --target option...

2016-10-24 22:59:39	xpt	[19:44:10] actually awk reads a record not a line (it's line by default) [19:44:10]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	izalove	[19:44:28] it was a simpilified explanation [19:44:28]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	xpt	[19:44:58] don oversimplify simple tool because it's seems too simple [19:44:58]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	xpt	[19:47:39] wasn't there awk+shell database engine that predates oracle RDBMS? [19:47:39]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	quesker	[20:02:22] I need to add a line to a [foo] section.  I know how to change lines but not how to add one [20:02:22]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	izalove	[20:03:16] awk '{ print } /foo/ { print "add this thing" }' [20:03:16]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	quesker	[20:03:25] thanks [20:03:25]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	_val_	[20:04:32] exit [20:04:32]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	quesker	[21:30:03] I need to pass in foo so I changed it to awk -vfoo="$foo" '{print} $0 ~ foo { print "added line" }'    but since foo is [foo/bar] I think maybe the [] are being treated as a character class or something, it is matching a lot of stuff [21:30:03]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	quesker	[21:30:36] if I escape them I get  warning: escape sequence `\[' treated as plain `[' [21:30:36]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	Riviera	[21:33:12] quesker: so foo is not a regular expression but a literal string? [21:33:12]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	quesker	[21:33:18] right [21:33:18]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	quesker	[21:33:40] oh just use ==? [21:33:40]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	Riviera	[21:33:44] quesker: would you not agree that it's then pretty stupid to use the regex operator ~ ? [21:33:44]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	quesker	[21:33:54] I agree heh [21:33:54]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	Riviera	[21:34:11] quesker: == would test for equality, index for substringity 8( [21:34:11]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	Riviera	[21:34:14] err 8) [21:34:14]

2016-10-24 22:59:39	quesker	[21:34:23] ok thanks [21:34:23]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	quesker	[21:37:45] do I need to check > 0?  this seems to work   awk -vfoo="$foo" '{print}  index($0, foo)  { print "added line" }' [21:37:45]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	quesker	[21:38:16] umm nevermind [21:38:16]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	John[Lisbeth]	[22:11:10] is there a way to use awk as my /usr/bin/read ? [22:11:10]

2016-10-24 22:59:39	John[Lisbeth]	[22:17:30] I need read [22:17:30]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	yitz_	[22:18:24] So ... call 'read'? [22:18:24]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	yitz_	[22:18:51] There's no /usr/bin/read on my machine ... or most? [22:18:51]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	John[Lisbeth]	[22:21:14] mine is /usr/local/bin/read [22:21:14]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	John[Lisbeth]	[22:21:31] your path may vary [22:21:31]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	rods-tab3	[22:22:28] here [22:22:28]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	rods-tab3	[22:22:48] here:  read is a shell builtin [22:22:48]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	John[Lisbeth]	[22:24:00] which shell? [22:24:00]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	yitz	[22:26:18] Any POSIX complient shell [22:26:18]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	yitz	[22:26:37] The 'read' command modifies a local shell var which cannot be done with a child process [22:26:37]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	rods-tab3	[22:42:02] posx says can be separate executable:  man 1p read [22:42:02]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	yitz	[22:44:12] "The setting of variables specified by the var operands shall affect the current shell execution environment" [22:44:12]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	yitz	[22:44:51] The current shell env cannot be affected by a child process ergo it cannot be a binary that's called via a fork() and exec() [22:44:51]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	rods-tab3	[22:51:48] !paddlin  rods-tab3 [22:51:48]

2016-10-24 22:59:39	emg	[23:05:09] yitz: in most current implementations no, a child process cannot affect the environment of the parent, but it's not hard to think of a system on which that would be possible, e.g. a process can edit /proc/$PPID/env or something like that, in which case things like alias, read, etc. could indeed be separate programs/processes [23:05:09]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	emg	[23:05:40] also POSIX has this weird thing where some special builtins also have to be available as executables in path, like cd, why?! not entirely sure but it's there [23:05:40]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	yitz	[23:07:35] That's a ... weird requirement [23:07:35]

2016-10-24 23:19:16	xpt	[19:47:39] wasn't there awk+shell database engine that predates oracle RDBMS? [19:47:39]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	quesker	[20:02:22] I need to add a line to a [foo] section.  I know how to change lines but not how to add one [20:02:22]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	izalove	[20:03:16] awk '{ print } /foo/ { print "add this thing" }' [20:03:16]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	quesker	[20:03:25] thanks [20:03:25]

2016-10-24 23:19:16	quesker	[21:30:03] I need to pass in foo so I changed it to awk -vfoo="$foo" '{print} $0 ~ foo { print "added line" }'    but since foo is [foo/bar] I think maybe the [] are being treated as a character class or something, it is matching a lot of stuff [21:30:03]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	quesker	[21:30:36] if I escape them I get  warning: escape sequence `\[' treated as plain `[' [21:30:36]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	Riviera	[21:33:12] quesker: so foo is not a regular expression but a literal string? [21:33:12]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	quesker	[21:33:18] right [21:33:18]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	quesker	[21:33:40] oh just use ==? [21:33:40]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	Riviera	[21:33:44] quesker: would you not agree that it's then pretty stupid to use the regex operator ~ ? [21:33:44]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	quesker	[21:33:54] I agree heh [21:33:54]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	Riviera	[21:34:11] quesker: == would test for equality, index for substringity 8( [21:34:11]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	Riviera	[21:34:14] err 8) [21:34:14]

2016-10-24 23:19:16	quesker	[21:34:23] ok thanks [21:34:23]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	quesker	[21:37:45] do I need to check > 0?  this seems to work   awk -vfoo="$foo" '{print}  index($0, foo)  { print "added line" }' [21:37:45]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	quesker	[21:38:16] umm nevermind [21:38:16]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	John[Lisbeth]	[22:11:10] is there a way to use awk as my /usr/bin/read ? [22:11:10]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	John[Lisbeth]	[22:11:14] basically getline [22:11:14]

2016-10-24 23:19:16	John[Lisbeth]	[22:17:30] I need read [22:17:30]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	yitz_	[22:18:24] So ... call 'read'? [22:18:24]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	yitz_	[22:18:51] There's no /usr/bin/read on my machine ... or most? [22:18:51]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	John[Lisbeth]	[22:21:14] mine is /usr/local/bin/read [22:21:14]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	John[Lisbeth]	[22:21:31] your path may vary [22:21:31]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	rods-tab3	[22:22:28] here [22:22:28]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	rods-tab3	[22:22:48] here:  read is a shell builtin [22:22:48]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	John[Lisbeth]	[22:24:00] which shell? [22:24:00]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	yitz	[22:26:18] Any POSIX complient shell [22:26:18]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	yitz	[22:26:37] The 'read' command modifies a local shell var which cannot be done with a child process [22:26:37]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	rods-tab3	[22:42:02] posx says can be separate executable:  man 1p read [22:42:02]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	yitz	[22:44:12] "The setting of variables specified by the var operands shall affect the current shell execution environment" [22:44:12]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	yitz	[22:44:51] The current shell env cannot be affected by a child process ergo it cannot be a binary that's called via a fork() and exec() [22:44:51]

2016-10-25 11:42:07	yitz_	[22:18:24] So ... call 'read'? [22:18:24]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	yitz_	[22:18:51] There's no /usr/bin/read on my machine ... or most? [22:18:51]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	John[Lisbeth]	[22:21:14] mine is /usr/local/bin/read [22:21:14]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	John[Lisbeth]	[22:21:31] your path may vary [22:21:31]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	rods-tab3	[22:22:28] here [22:22:28]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	rods-tab3	[22:22:48] here:  read is a shell builtin [22:22:48]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	John[Lisbeth]	[22:24:00] which shell? [22:24:00]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	yitz	[22:26:18] Any POSIX complient shell [22:26:18]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	yitz	[22:26:37] The 'read' command modifies a local shell var which cannot be done with a child process [22:26:37]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	rods-tab3	[22:42:02] posx says can be separate executable:  man 1p read [22:42:02]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	yitz	[22:44:12] "The setting of variables specified by the var operands shall affect the current shell execution environment" [22:44:12]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	yitz	[22:44:51] The current shell env cannot be affected by a child process ergo it cannot be a binary that's called via a fork() and exec() [22:44:51]

2016-10-25 11:42:07	emg	[23:05:09] yitz: in most current implementations no, a child process cannot affect the environment of the parent, but it's not hard to think of a system on which that would be possible, e.g. a process can edit /proc/$PPID/env or something like that, in which case things like alias, read, etc. could indeed be separate programs/processes [23:05:09]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	emg	[23:05:40] also POSIX has this weird thing where some special builtins also have to be available as executables in path, like cd, why?! not entirely sure but it's there [23:05:40]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	yitz	[23:07:35] That's a ... weird requirement [23:07:35]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	Riviera	[23:12:59] emg: cd can be used for testing cdability, e.g. as an -exec primary for find. [23:12:59]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	emg	[23:14:15] Riviera: interesting [23:14:15]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	yitz	[23:15:52] vs test -d and text -x [23:15:52]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	emg	[23:20:21] or -exec sh -c 'cd ... || ...' [23:20:21]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	emg	[23:20:33] but I can see how it would be useful now [23:20:33]

2016-10-25 15:33:48	John[Lisbeth]	[22:17:30] I need read [22:17:30]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	yitz_	[22:18:24] So ... call 'read'? [22:18:24]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	yitz_	[22:18:51] There's no /usr/bin/read on my machine ... or most? [22:18:51]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	John[Lisbeth]	[22:21:14] mine is /usr/local/bin/read [22:21:14]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	John[Lisbeth]	[22:21:31] your path may vary [22:21:31]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	rods-tab3	[22:22:28] here [22:22:28]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	rods-tab3	[22:22:48] here:  read is a shell builtin [22:22:48]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	John[Lisbeth]	[22:24:00] which shell? [22:24:00]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	yitz	[22:26:18] Any POSIX complient shell [22:26:18]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	yitz	[22:26:37] The 'read' command modifies a local shell var which cannot be done with a child process [22:26:37]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	rods-tab3	[22:42:02] posx says can be separate executable:  man 1p read [22:42:02]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	yitz	[22:44:12] "The setting of variables specified by the var operands shall affect the current shell execution environment" [22:44:12]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	yitz	[22:44:51] The current shell env cannot be affected by a child process ergo it cannot be a binary that's called via a fork() and exec() [22:44:51]

2016-10-25 15:33:48	emg	[23:05:09] yitz: in most current implementations no, a child process cannot affect the environment of the parent, but it's not hard to think of a system on which that would be possible, e.g. a process can edit /proc/$PPID/env or something like that, in which case things like alias, read, etc. could indeed be separate programs/processes [23:05:09]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	emg	[23:05:40] also POSIX has this weird thing where some special builtins also have to be available as executables in path, like cd, why?! not entirely sure but it's there [23:05:40]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	yitz	[23:07:35] That's a ... weird requirement [23:07:35]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	Riviera	[23:12:59] emg: cd can be used for testing cdability, e.g. as an -exec primary for find. [23:12:59]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	emg	[23:14:15] Riviera: interesting [23:14:15]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	yitz	[23:15:52] vs test -d and text -x [23:15:52]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	emg	[23:20:21] or -exec sh -c 'cd ... || ...' [23:20:21]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	emg	[23:20:33] but I can see how it would be useful now [23:20:33]

2016-10-25 17:57:03	mute	[02:06:16] the 0+ forces awk to convert it to a number [02:06:16]

2016-10-25 17:57:03	mute	[02:09:39] without an anchor, 10.00 matches 0.00 [02:09:39]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	lgc_	[02:10:20] Yes, but the problem was that 0.00 passed through. [02:10:20]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	mute	[02:10:28] then i've no idea [02:10:28]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	mute	[02:10:46] perhaps your data has \r in it, is it only 2 columns [02:10:46]

2016-10-25 17:57:03	lgc_	[02:13:24] What is the \r? [02:13:24]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	lgc_	[02:22:56] Well thanks, mute. Good night /good morning. [02:22:56]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	mute	[02:23:39] \r is a dos line ending. can mess things up [02:23:39]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	mute	[02:23:44] or appear to [02:23:44]

2016-10-27 04:58:10	gnomon	linedash, so, depending on what qualifies as readable for you, you could do it with a single pattern using alternation, eg.: $4 !~ /(\.jpg|\.jpeg|\.gif)/ ...
2016-10-27 04:58:47	gnomon	linedash, obviously with a whole bunch of matches that could become unwieldy, so it pushes the complexity out of your control structure into your pattern definition.
2016-10-27 04:59:01	linedash	gnomon: that's perfectly readable to me alright.  I am keen to understand why my current ver doesn't work tho or what the proper way of doing that would be
2016-10-27 04:59:46	linedash	I thought you could string patterns together within the parentheses
2016-10-27 05:00:09	gnomon	linedash, so, the ~ infix comparison operator accepts only two inputs: a search space on the lefthand side and a pattern (or a datum that can be turned into a pattern) on the righthand side.

2016-10-27 05:01:20	gnomon	linedash, the ~ and !~ operators can't accept a compound/parenthesized statement on the righthand side, even though the intention might be clear to you and to other readers.  Your idea isn't unreasonable, it's just not something compatible with awk's quite simple grammar.
2016-10-27 05:01:42	linedash	gnomon: that's helpful; thanks.  Does the same apply to == and =! ?
2016-10-27 05:01:45	linedash	!= even
2016-10-27 05:02:20	gnomon	linedash, the same applies to the comparison infix operators, yes.

2016-10-27 17:07:24	thekrynn	[13:54:49] hi all, had a question on how to round a variable and store it as another variable in awk (not via print) [13:54:49]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	thekrynn	[13:59:02] echo "1.2345" | awk '{print int($1 * 100) / 100}' -> 1.23 [13:59:02]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	thekrynn	[13:59:06] figured it out [13:59:06]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	_val_	[14:02:47] # echo "1.2345" | awk '{printf("%.2f",$1)}' [14:02:47]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	shbot	[14:02:48] _val_: 1.23 [14:02:48]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	thekrynn	[14:03:03] i needed it inline as i need to do [14:03:03]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	thekrynn	[14:03:17] { val += round (x / y) } END { print val } [14:03:17]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	geirha	[14:07:12] # echo 1.9999 | awk '{print int($1 * 100) / 100}' [14:07:12]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	shbot	[14:07:12] geirha: 1.99 [14:07:12]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	geirha	[14:08:11] wouldn't it make more sense to do the rounding at the END ? [14:08:11]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	linedash	[14:54:38] what would be the correct syntax to not match against several words?  In this instance, I'm scanning a pre-parsed apache log and want to remove all images - so for example, awk '$4 !~ /\.jpg/ && $4 !~ /\.jpeg/' -- I thought I should be able to do '$4 !~ (/\.jpg/ || /\.jpeg/)' but that doesn't seem to work [14:54:38]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	linedash	[14:55:56] I want to skip about a dozen or so terms, so was hoping to wrap them all in one big $4 !~ (/stuff/ || /morestuff/ || /yetmorestuff/) type pattern [14:55:56]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	gnomon	[14:58:10] linedash, so, depending on what qualifies as readable for you, you could do it with a single pattern using alternation, eg.: $4 !~ /(\.jpg|\.jpeg|\.gif)/ ... [14:58:10]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	gnomon	[14:58:47] linedash, obviously with a whole bunch of matches that could become unwieldy, so it pushes the complexity out of your control structure into your pattern definition. [14:58:47]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	linedash	[14:59:01] gnomon: that's perfectly readable to me alright.  I am keen to understand why my current ver doesn't work tho or what the proper way of doing that would be [14:59:01]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	linedash	[14:59:46] I thought you could string patterns together within the parentheses [14:59:46]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	gnomon	[15:00:09] linedash, so, the ~ infix comparison operator accepts only two inputs: a search space on the lefthand side and a pattern (or a datum that can be turned into a pattern) on the righthand side. [15:00:09]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	geirha	[15:00:14] /\.(jpg|jpeg|gif)$/ [15:00:14]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	gnomon	[15:01:20] linedash, the ~ and !~ operators can't accept a compound/parenthesized statement on the righthand side, even though the intention might be clear to you and to other readers.  Your idea isn't unreasonable, it's just not something compatible with awk's quite simple grammar. [15:01:20]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	linedash	[15:01:42] gnomon: that's helpful; thanks.  Does the same apply to == and =! ? [15:01:42]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	linedash	[15:01:45] != even [15:01:45]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	gnomon	[15:02:20] linedash, the same applies to the comparison infix operators, yes. [15:02:20]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	gnomon	[15:02:33] (foo == bar) || (baz != quux) [15:02:33]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	gnomon	[15:02:35] but not [15:02:35]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	gnomon	[15:02:51] (foo || baz) == (bar && quux) [15:02:51]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	linedash	[15:03:48] gnomon: thanks!  Helps explain a few things alright [15:03:48]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	gnomon	[15:05:06] Excellent! [15:05:06]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	gnomon	[15:05:12] linedash, you're welcome.  Good luck! [15:05:12]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	linedash	[15:16:08] gnomon: any idea what's going wrong with this then? [15:16:08]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	linedash	[15:16:13] $ remotesscheck 1 | awk '$4 ~ /\.(jpg|jpeg|gif|png)$/ { print $4 }' [15:16:13]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	linedash	[15:16:13] /images/ASI-logo-for-email.png [15:16:13]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	linedash	[15:16:36] ah feck [15:16:36]

2016-10-27 17:07:24	linedash	[15:16:41] one of those damn days :) [15:16:41]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	gnomon	[15:17:38] linedash, trailing whitespace character at the end of your apache log line? [15:17:38]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	linedash	[15:18:10] nah;  ~ should have been !~ [15:18:10]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	linedash	[15:18:29] brain not working at 100% ; I should just leave the rest of this for tomorrow [15:18:29]

2016-10-27 17:07:24	waldner	[20:34:22] nope [20:34:22]

2016-10-27 22:29:48	thekrynn	[13:54:49] hi all, had a question on how to round a variable and store it as another variable in awk (not via print) [13:54:49]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	thekrynn	[13:59:02] echo "1.2345" | awk '{print int($1 * 100) / 100}' -> 1.23 [13:59:02]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	thekrynn	[13:59:06] figured it out [13:59:06]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	_val_	[14:02:47] # echo "1.2345" | awk '{printf("%.2f",$1)}' [14:02:47]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	shbot	[14:02:48] _val_: 1.23 [14:02:48]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	thekrynn	[14:03:03] i needed it inline as i need to do [14:03:03]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	thekrynn	[14:03:17] { val += round (x / y) } END { print val } [14:03:17]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	geirha	[14:07:12] # echo 1.9999 | awk '{print int($1 * 100) / 100}' [14:07:12]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	shbot	[14:07:12] geirha: 1.99 [14:07:12]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	geirha	[14:08:11] wouldn't it make more sense to do the rounding at the END ? [14:08:11]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	linedash	[14:54:38] what would be the correct syntax to not match against several words?  In this instance, I'm scanning a pre-parsed apache log and want to remove all images - so for example, awk '$4 !~ /\.jpg/ && $4 !~ /\.jpeg/' -- I thought I should be able to do '$4 !~ (/\.jpg/ || /\.jpeg/)' but that doesn't seem to work [14:54:38]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	linedash	[14:55:56] I want to skip about a dozen or so terms, so was hoping to wrap them all in one big $4 !~ (/stuff/ || /morestuff/ || /yetmorestuff/) type pattern [14:55:56]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	gnomon	[14:58:10] linedash, so, depending on what qualifies as readable for you, you could do it with a single pattern using alternation, eg.: $4 !~ /(\.jpg|\.jpeg|\.gif)/ ... [14:58:10]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	gnomon	[14:58:47] linedash, obviously with a whole bunch of matches that could become unwieldy, so it pushes the complexity out of your control structure into your pattern definition. [14:58:47]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	linedash	[14:59:01] gnomon: that's perfectly readable to me alright.  I am keen to understand why my current ver doesn't work tho or what the proper way of doing that would be [14:59:01]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	linedash	[14:59:46] I thought you could string patterns together within the parentheses [14:59:46]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	gnomon	[15:00:09] linedash, so, the ~ infix comparison operator accepts only two inputs: a search space on the lefthand side and a pattern (or a datum that can be turned into a pattern) on the righthand side. [15:00:09]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	geirha	[15:00:14] /\.(jpg|jpeg|gif)$/ [15:00:14]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	gnomon	[15:01:20] linedash, the ~ and !~ operators can't accept a compound/parenthesized statement on the righthand side, even though the intention might be clear to you and to other readers.  Your idea isn't unreasonable, it's just not something compatible with awk's quite simple grammar. [15:01:20]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	linedash	[15:01:42] gnomon: that's helpful; thanks.  Does the same apply to == and =! ? [15:01:42]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	linedash	[15:01:45] != even [15:01:45]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	gnomon	[15:02:20] linedash, the same applies to the comparison infix operators, yes. [15:02:20]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	gnomon	[15:02:33] (foo == bar) || (baz != quux) [15:02:33]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	gnomon	[15:02:35] but not [15:02:35]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	gnomon	[15:02:51] (foo || baz) == (bar && quux) [15:02:51]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	linedash	[15:03:48] gnomon: thanks!  Helps explain a few things alright [15:03:48]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	gnomon	[15:05:06] Excellent! [15:05:06]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	gnomon	[15:05:12] linedash, you're welcome.  Good luck! [15:05:12]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	linedash	[15:16:08] gnomon: any idea what's going wrong with this then? [15:16:08]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	linedash	[15:16:13] $ remotesscheck 1 | awk '$4 ~ /\.(jpg|jpeg|gif|png)$/ { print $4 }' [15:16:13]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	linedash	[15:16:13] /images/ASI-logo-for-email.png [15:16:13]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	linedash	[15:16:36] ah feck [15:16:36]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	linedash	[15:16:37] nm [15:16:37]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	linedash	[15:16:41] one of those damn days :) [15:16:41]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	gnomon	[15:17:38] linedash, trailing whitespace character at the end of your apache log line? [15:17:38]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	linedash	[15:18:10] nah;  ~ should have been !~ [15:18:10]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	linedash	[15:18:29] brain not working at 100% ; I should just leave the rest of this for tomorrow [15:18:29]

2016-10-27 22:29:48	waldner	[20:32:46] with the right quoting [20:32:46]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	Guest22070	[20:33:34] so, (awk -v prev="${prev} '$0 ~ prev {RS='|' '/prev/ {$1=""; print $0 }' ...) [20:33:34]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	waldner	[20:34:22] nope [20:34:22]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	waldner	[20:34:45] awk -v prev="${prev}" -v RS='|' '$0 ~ prev { $1=""; print $0 }' [20:34:45]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	Guest22070	[20:34:45] then? [20:34:45]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	Guest22070	[20:44:45] @waldner are you still here? [20:44:45]

2016-10-27 22:35:26	geirha	\d is undefined
2016-10-27 22:35:27	G66K	no idea why this not functioning
2016-10-27 22:35:45	geirha	to match a digit, use [0-9] or [[:digit:]]
2016-10-27 22:36:03	G66K	blocks ?
2016-10-27 22:36:10	G66K	the \d syntax didnt work?
2016-10-27 22:37:02	geirha	awk uses posix extended regular expressions, which does not define \d
2016-10-27 22:37:19	geirha	\d is a perl-style regex thing
2016-10-27 22:38:22	G66K	exactly, thanks for the info
2016-10-27 22:38:47	geirha	on a side note, the {print} part is redundant, since that's the default action

2016-10-28 11:26:19	waldner	[20:31:07] awk -v prev="${prev}" '...use prev here ...' [20:31:07]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	waldner	[20:31:23] ah, to do match then you want [20:31:23]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	waldner	[20:31:41] awk -v prev="${prev}" '$0 ~ prev { do things }' [20:31:41]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	Guest22070	[20:32:17] so, awk -v prev="${prev [20:32:17]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	waldner	[20:32:46] with the right quoting [20:32:46]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	Guest22070	[20:33:34] so, (awk -v prev="${prev} '$0 ~ prev {RS='|' '/prev/ {$1=""; print $0 }' ...) [20:33:34]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	waldner	[20:34:22] nope [20:34:22]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	waldner	[20:34:45] awk -v prev="${prev}" -v RS='|' '$0 ~ prev { $1=""; print $0 }' [20:34:45]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	Guest22070	[20:34:45] then? [20:34:45]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	Guest22070	[20:44:45] @waldner are you still here? [20:44:45]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	G66K	[08:34:13] hello every [08:34:13]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	G66K	[08:34:14] one [08:34:14]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	G66K	[08:34:43] awk '$2 ~ /\d+-\d+/ {print}' mail-list [08:34:43]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	G66K	[08:35:09] the number field $2 has value of 555-5553 [08:35:09]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	G66K	[08:35:13] but seems not matching it [08:35:13]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	G66K	[08:35:20] my regex is correct [08:35:20]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	geirha	[08:35:26] \d is undefined [08:35:26]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	G66K	[08:35:27] no idea why this not functioning [08:35:27]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	geirha	[08:35:45] to match a digit, use [0-9] or [[:digit:]] [08:35:45]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	G66K	[08:36:03] blocks ? [08:36:03]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	G66K	[08:36:10] the \d syntax didnt work? [08:36:10]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	geirha	[08:37:02] awk uses posix extended regular expressions, which does not define \d [08:37:02]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	geirha	[08:37:19] \d is a perl-style regex thing [08:37:19]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	G66K	[08:38:22] exactly, thanks for the info [08:38:22]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	geirha	[08:38:47] on a side note, the {print} part is redundant, since that's the default action [08:38:47]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	geirha	[08:39:13] awk '$2 ~ /[0-9]-[0-9]/' [08:39:13]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	G66K	[08:39:42] awk '$2 ~ /^[0-9]+-[0-9]+$/ {print $2}' [08:39:42]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	G66K	[08:39:56] yes i know i was testing my code before i implement it [08:39:56]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	G66K	[08:40:08] this exactly what i want [08:40:08]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	geirha	[08:40:21] yeah, looks good [08:40:21]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	bla	[08:40:34] Hi! Is there a variable that returns the whole current line in a general {} catcher? [08:40:34]

2016-10-28 12:28:12	Guest22070	[20:30:41] Hi. Trying to write the following script. How to pass variable $prev? subCommands="$( awk -v RS='|' '/${prev}/ {$1=""; print $0 }' ~/commands.txt)" [20:30:41]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	waldner	[20:31:07] awk -v prev="${prev}" '...use prev here ...' [20:31:07]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	waldner	[20:31:23] ah, to do match then you want [20:31:23]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	waldner	[20:31:41] awk -v prev="${prev}" '$0 ~ prev { do things }' [20:31:41]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	Guest22070	[20:32:17] so, awk -v prev="${prev [20:32:17]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	waldner	[20:32:46] with the right quoting [20:32:46]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	Guest22070	[20:33:34] so, (awk -v prev="${prev} '$0 ~ prev {RS='|' '/prev/ {$1=""; print $0 }' ...) [20:33:34]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	waldner	[20:34:22] nope [20:34:22]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	waldner	[20:34:45] awk -v prev="${prev}" -v RS='|' '$0 ~ prev { $1=""; print $0 }' [20:34:45]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	Guest22070	[20:34:45] then? [20:34:45]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	Guest22070	[20:44:45] @waldner are you still here? [20:44:45]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	G66K	[08:34:13] hello every [08:34:13]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	G66K	[08:34:14] one [08:34:14]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	G66K	[08:34:43] awk '$2 ~ /\d+-\d+/ {print}' mail-list [08:34:43]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	G66K	[08:35:09] the number field $2 has value of 555-5553 [08:35:09]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	G66K	[08:35:13] but seems not matching it [08:35:13]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	G66K	[08:35:20] my regex is correct [08:35:20]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	geirha	[08:35:26] \d is undefined [08:35:26]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	G66K	[08:35:27] no idea why this not functioning [08:35:27]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	geirha	[08:35:45] to match a digit, use [0-9] or [[:digit:]] [08:35:45]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	G66K	[08:36:03] blocks ? [08:36:03]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	G66K	[08:36:10] the \d syntax didnt work? [08:36:10]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	geirha	[08:37:02] awk uses posix extended regular expressions, which does not define \d [08:37:02]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	geirha	[08:37:19] \d is a perl-style regex thing [08:37:19]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	G66K	[08:38:22] exactly, thanks for the info [08:38:22]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	geirha	[08:38:47] on a side note, the {print} part is redundant, since that's the default action [08:38:47]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	geirha	[08:39:13] awk '$2 ~ /[0-9]-[0-9]/' [08:39:13]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	G66K	[08:39:42] awk '$2 ~ /^[0-9]+-[0-9]+$/ {print $2}' [08:39:42]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	G66K	[08:39:56] yes i know i was testing my code before i implement it [08:39:56]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	G66K	[08:40:08] this exactly what i want [08:40:08]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	geirha	[08:40:21] yeah, looks good [08:40:21]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	bla	[08:40:34] Hi! Is there a variable that returns the whole current line in a general {} catcher? [08:40:34]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	geirha	[08:40:58] $0 [08:40:58]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	geirha	[08:41:06] not sure what a general {} catcher is [08:41:06]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	G66K	[08:42:33] its been a year i dont use awk seems like i forget all of it [08:42:33]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	bla	[08:42:34] geirha: Thank you very much! I was referring to a curly brace -block with no regular expression in the front. [08:42:34]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	bla	[08:43:10] Thanks again! Good bye! [08:43:10]

2016-10-28 22:16:41	G66K	[08:35:09] the number field $2 has value of 555-5553 [08:35:09]
2016-10-28 22:16:41	G66K	[08:35:13] but seems not matching it [08:35:13]
2016-10-28 22:16:41	G66K	[08:35:20] my regex is correct [08:35:20]
2016-10-28 22:16:41	geirha	[08:35:26] \d is undefined [08:35:26]
2016-10-28 22:16:41	G66K	[08:35:27] no idea why this not functioning [08:35:27]
2016-10-28 22:16:41	geirha	[08:35:45] to match a digit, use [0-9] or [[:digit:]] [08:35:45]
2016-10-28 22:16:41	G66K	[08:36:03] blocks ? [08:36:03]
2016-10-28 22:16:41	G66K	[08:36:10] the \d syntax didnt work? [08:36:10]
2016-10-28 22:16:41	geirha	[08:37:02] awk uses posix extended regular expressions, which does not define \d [08:37:02]
2016-10-28 22:16:41	geirha	[08:37:19] \d is a perl-style regex thing [08:37:19]
2016-10-28 22:16:41	G66K	[08:38:22] exactly, thanks for the info [08:38:22]
2016-10-28 22:16:41	geirha	[08:38:47] on a side note, the {print} part is redundant, since that's the default action [08:38:47]

2016-10-28 22:16:41	G66K	[08:40:08] this exactly what i want [08:40:08]
2016-10-28 22:16:41	geirha	[08:40:21] yeah, looks good [08:40:21]
2016-10-28 22:16:41	bla	[08:40:34] Hi! Is there a variable that returns the whole current line in a general {} catcher? [08:40:34]
2016-10-28 22:16:41	geirha	[08:40:58] $0 [08:40:58]
2016-10-28 22:16:41	geirha	[08:41:06] not sure what a general {} catcher is [08:41:06]
2016-10-28 22:16:41	G66K	[08:42:33] its been a year i dont use awk seems like i forget all of it [08:42:33]
2016-10-28 22:16:41	bla	[08:42:34] geirha: Thank you very much! I was referring to a curly brace -block with no regular expression in the front. [08:42:34]
