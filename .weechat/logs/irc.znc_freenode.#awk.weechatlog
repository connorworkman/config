2016-10-17 21:03:36	hugo_	[17:31:49] i need to get some values with awk. i have a file with this kind of values ==> "My string A", "My string B", 0, 0.000%, 0.000%, 604800, 99.000%, 100.000%, 604800, 100.000%, 100.000%, [17:31:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	hugo_	[17:31:57] it is not entire line [17:31:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	hugo_	[17:32:10] i would like to get this output with awk command =>        My string A:My string B:99.000% [17:32:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	hugo_	[17:32:36] 99.000% is the 7rd filed (,) [17:32:36]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	hugo_	[17:32:43] it is a csv file [17:32:43]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	mute	[17:33:02] quoted... won't be easy if those quoted ones have commas [17:33:02]

2016-10-17 21:03:36	hugo_	[17:33:06] how to get that ? [17:33:06]

2016-10-17 21:03:36	yitz	[17:46:50] And spaces don't get cleaned up well [17:46:50]

2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[17:55:50] Still, that fails as soon as one of the strings contain comma [17:55:50]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	yitz	[18:02:31] o.O nifty. I had no clue you could do that to OFS [18:02:31]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[18:49:40] You can do it to any variables. Useful if you need to read multiple files that use different separators [18:49:40]

2016-10-18 00:14:23	hugo_	[17:32:10] i would like to get this output with awk command =>        My string A:My string B:99.000% [17:32:10]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	hugo_	[17:32:36] 99.000% is the 7rd filed (,) [17:32:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	hugo_	[17:32:43] it is a csv file [17:32:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	mute	[17:33:02] quoted... won't be easy if those quoted ones have commas [17:33:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[17:33:03] Don't cross post, please [17:33:03]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	hugo_	[17:33:06] how to get that ? [17:33:06]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	mute	[17:34:32] vktec sent him here though [17:34:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[17:38:39] Oh. Fair enough [17:38:39]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[17:39:27] hugo_: awk -F 'BEGIN{OFS=":"} {print $1, $2, $7}' [17:39:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	mute	[17:42:52] seems to be missing something [17:42:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[17:46:43] -F, [17:46:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[17:46:50] And spaces don't get cleaned up well [17:46:50]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[17:47:04] -F', ' [17:47:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[17:51:04] (-v OFS=:) [17:51:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[17:51:42] or one of my favorite seemingly lesser known awk features: awk -F, '{print $1, $2, $7}' OFS=: filename [17:51:42]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	geirha	[17:55:50] Still, that fails as soon as one of the strings contain comma [17:55:50]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[18:02:31] o.O nifty. I had no clue you could do that to OFS [18:02:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	geirha	[18:49:40] You can do it to any variables. Useful if you need to read multiple files that use different separators [18:49:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	geirha	[18:50:21] awk 'script...' FS=, file.csv FS='\t' file.tsv [18:50:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Riviera	[19:12:41] yitz: while you are at it check gawk's -E [19:12:41]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[20:14:32] Interesting again [20:14:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[22:37:43] huh, my scripts works with gawk, nawk, busybox awk, but makes mawk segfault :-P [22:37:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[23:00:15] Either file a bug report or accept that mawk isn't really awk, emg [23:00:15]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[23:04:05] yeah it's the second time mawk hasn't worked with a script of mine :-/ [23:04:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[23:04:12] I really should file a bug report [23:04:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[23:04:15] or two [23:04:15]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	emg	[23:04:29] my current script has such attrocities as: 			times[FILENAME,f,$5,$6,inds[FILENAME,f,$5,$6]++] = time [23:04:29]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	yitz	[23:07:22] ... awk may not be the best tool for you [23:07:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	dualbus	[05:20:46] axisys: is that the up-to-date mawk you're testing with, or the old debian version? [05:20:46]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	dualbus	[05:20:52] woops, I meant emg [05:20:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	xpt	[06:21:31] yitz: why not? I have written a script that uses 4 or 5 dimensional arrays and is working like a charm [06:21:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	xpt	[06:22:31] even on some "funny" awk version on IBM AIX [06:22:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	xpt	[06:23:06] and by "funny" I mean broken, does not even say on which awk implementation it's based [06:23:06]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	alxtb	[09:20:03] Hi, I have this awk command:          /Subnets/{f=0} f{print}; /Now performing 2280/ {f=1}' file.txt [09:20:03]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	alxtb	[09:20:23] It returns two columns [09:20:23]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	alxtb	[09:20:36] I want those two columns each output into individual files [09:20:36]

2016-10-18 00:14:23	linedash	[09:21:13] it's fairly straight forward [09:21:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	alxtb	[09:22:07] linedash could you remind me is the first column $1 or $0 [09:22:07]

2016-10-18 00:14:23	linedash	[09:24:15] $1 for first column [09:24:15]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	alxtb	[09:24:16] or have I forgotten how awk works completely? [09:24:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	alxtb	[09:24:20] thanks [09:24:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	linedash	[09:24:21] $0 represents the whole line [09:24:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	alxtb	[09:24:25] thank you [09:24:25]

2016-10-18 13:39:15	nal1	read the manpage, awk isnt complicated, really
2016-10-18 13:39:54	Celmor	I rather pick it up piece by piece from what I need, if I just try to learn everything at once, I will forget half of it shortly after
2016-10-18 13:40:28	nal1	try writing what you are currently in awk
2016-10-18 13:40:46	nal1	its doable, maybe
