2016-10-17 19:17:50	malinoff	botnut: the problem is, we don't know what's "this" exactly. We don't know the problem you're trying to solve. All you're saying is you're going to have terrabytes of graph-based data.

If your question was like "here's my code, trying to work with postgresql using psycopg2 connector, but I don't get results I expect", I wouldn't say a word. But your question is not about python, your question is too general, and is about comparing databases. Not even comparing python connectors to databases

2016-10-18 00:14:26	twb	[09:42:26] Hrrrrrm, that didn't seem to change it either [09:42:26]
2016-10-18 00:14:26	twb	[09:42:40] But putting a syntax error there causes the program to not start, so it's not COMPLETELY ignoring me [09:42:40]

2016-10-18 00:14:26	ksk	[09:46:47] Im ugsing joblib.Parallel like this: results = Parallel(n_jobs=4,verbose=50)(delayed(migrator)(webpack) for entry in list) - is there an easy way to make it print the remaining list on every iteration, so I can see which entrys are left "todo"? Im not really good with that type of syntax thingy. thanks! [09:46:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:26	Tiberium	[09:47:30] Guys, I can have an int(flags - similar to bitmask), which can take values from adding to these: +1,+2,+4,+8,+16,+32,+64,+128,+256,+512. How do I parse it to list of booleans? [09:47:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:26	Tiberium	[09:47:49] For example: 1, 17, 3, 12 and so on [09:47:49]
2016-10-18 00:14:26	w0rp	[09:50:27] Does anyone know if there's a formatter for pytest output which will a line you can copy and paste back in your terminal to run exactly that test again? [09:50:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:26	henbruas	[09:50:42] Tiberium, so 3 would be [True, True], for example? [09:50:42]
2016-10-18 00:14:26	w0rp	[09:50:43] You can re-run all failed tests with a plugin, and that does help. [09:50:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:26	Tiberium	[09:50:48] henbruas, yes [09:50:48]
2016-10-18 00:14:26	marsje	[09:51:59] I made a script that copy a bunch of files to the cloud, multi threaded. It works but sometimes I see some extra unexplanable threads and memory usage goes through the roof (15 GB) until the point the process gets killed. Any recommendations how to debug this? [09:51:59]
2016-10-18 00:14:26	henbruas	[09:52:27] Tiberium, this is probably a terrible way to do things, but: [bool(int(x)) for x in format(3, "b")] [09:52:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:26	Tiberium	[09:52:50] henbruas, ok, thanks [09:52:50]
2016-10-18 00:14:26	twb	[09:52:53] Urgh if I set the roundup "master URL" thing from http://localhost:8917/demo to http://0.0.0.0:8917/demo, it binds to * as I wanted --- but then every page redirect goes to 0.0.0.0 [09:52:53]

2016-10-18 00:38:41	cirengRH	dgarana, what is the most suitable ?
2016-10-18 00:38:47	cirengRH	dgarana, yes you are right
2016-10-18 00:39:00	dgarana	my favourite webapp framework is flask

2016-10-18 00:39:38	dgarana	cirengRH: you mean the webapp deployment?
2016-10-18 00:39:43	phz_	it’s either an empty list or a singleton list
2016-10-18 00:39:51	dgarana	cause here there are 2 facts, development and deployment
2016-10-18 00:39:57	cirengRH	dgarana, I heard it but never tried it, I m still struggling with django hahah.
2016-10-18 00:40:11	ksk	Im ugsing joblib.Parallel like this: results = Parallel(n_jobs=4,verbose=50)(delayed(migrator)(webpack) for entry in list) - is there an easy way to make it print the remaining list on every iteration, so I can see which entrys are left "todo"? Im not really good with that type of syntax thingy. thanks!
2016-10-18 00:40:14	cirengRH	dgarana, yes . I meant webs development
2016-10-18 00:40:44	nedbat	phz_: or make a back-mapping: backwards = {v:k for k,v in CONSTANTS.__dict__.items()}
2016-10-18 00:40:50	dgarana	cirengRH: I prefer using nginx, it more suitable and you can easily manage upstreams and redirections,

2016-10-18 01:56:09	Earthnail	Hi there. I have a use case where I basically want to stream program execution to increase speed. The rough structure is: read file in chunks. For each chunk: 1) process 2) make a db query 3) make a decision based on the results of the db query and the decision of the previous chunk. Basically, that creates three threads: the first thread reads and processes chunks, and puts that into a queue. The second thread reads off that queue, sends s
2016-10-18 01:56:09	Earthnail	omething to the db, and puts the results of it into the next queue. The third thread reads off that second queue and produces results. Now, for the second step, I want to have a worker pool. Because the database can process requests in parallel (without performance penalties for individual requests), I'd like to create something like a worker pool for these requests. It's a bit like ThreadPoolExecutor, except that I don't have all elements
2016-10-18 01:56:09	Earthnail	when I call pool.map(), but need to send new queries to my ThreadPool continuously. I've looked a lot into asyncio for that ThreadPool, but I never used it. Does this sound like a regular use case that I should solve with three threads and asyncio in the second thread? Are there common design patterns I can follow?
2016-10-18 01:56:17	PocketKiller	:o...
2016-10-18 01:56:23	Cheaterman	So yeah, buddies, what happens to a file object with a zero refcount? Does it get GCed and it closes the file?

2016-10-18 02:08:33	AeroNotix	I've never really found a good solution to having private repositories on github. What are the solutions? --process-dependency-links works but doesn't seem like a nice solution either. Not to mention that pip freeze after using --process-dependency-links doesn't properly generate the correct requirements!
2016-10-18 02:08:35	cdunklau	ẞ is certainly LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S
2016-10-18 02:08:50	deniska	Earthnail: I'm not familiar with pyzmq, but does it by chance have machinery for sending multiple requests and then waiting for multiple results?
2016-10-18 02:09:01	howlymowly	i did it by pressing Capslock + ß ...  how did u do it?
2016-10-18 02:09:13	tos9	"in 2010, the use of the capital ẞ became mandatory in official documentation in Germany for geographical names written in all-caps."

The Mage will always get an MP pool, while Civilian almost never does - but if they have a specific flag on them, they should. In this case, I have a list of many character classes and pools such as MP, where there exist a few gotchas like that. I am pondering the best way to handle the gotchas.

2016-10-18 04:42:55	Volund	tos9: the way MOST characters work, they're either a Mortal, a Vampire, a Mage, a Werewolf, a Changeling, or whatever. each 'character class' shares 90% of its traits/stats with the others, but the difference tends to be different resource pools (vampires spend Blood Points to use their powers, Werewolves spend Essence, Mages spend Mana etc.) Mortals don't have a special pool like this... but if that Mortal is a special kind of

2016-10-18 05:40:11	Norbin	Need some help with properly extracting all fields from a nested JSON, i am quite new to generators or traversing so keep that in mind, I am open to any method that is right. My json {dict} structure is very arbitrary and can the keys of the main dict can contain simple strings, ints, dicts and lists, where in case of dicts and strings, those can be nested further into dict of lists of dicts, or anything

2016-10-18 05:40:14	Norbin	similiar. my goal is to be able to extract (even simple print)  all the possible values where strings/numbers are considered the lowest level, i don't wanna print a dict with all the key:values in one line, i wanna iterate over that dict and do that, and if there's a list in that dict, print the values of the list as well, i hope you get my goal. here's an example of what i have thus far, just a simple yield
2016-10-18 05:40:16	Norbin	depends on the type of the key, that works but it's not going further into the actual content of each key, just looking at it from the top level:  http://paste.ofcode.org/MNCPLZnxvYWzFPEC6zrUPg

2016-10-18 08:04:35	jwhisnant	gronke: how is doing them sequentially different than doing them in groups of 10?
2016-10-18 08:05:14	gronke	jwhisnant, apparently it overloads the system if all of them are processed at once, so they want the option to do it in batches
2016-10-18 08:05:20	gronke	so instead of doing 457 files, they'd do 50 at once

2016-10-18 08:05:47	gronke	and the files are numbered, so you'd have A1.file, A2.file... then A450.file, A451.file, etc.
2016-10-18 08:06:10	gronke	the commands and everything are easy, I just can't figure out how to do the slicing
2016-10-18 08:06:13	jwhisnant	gronke: I am skeptical of "apparently", unless their is more information behind that ...
2016-10-18 08:06:27	Yhg1s	gronke: it's a little hard to suggest specific things without seeing what you're doing.
2016-10-18 08:06:31	gronke	I don't question it, I'm just doing what they're asking me to do, it's genetics work so I dont know the science
2016-10-18 08:06:39	gronke	Here's what I have so far: https://paste.linux.community/view/12948c23
2016-10-18 08:06:52	deniska	gronke: you may use `while a_list_of_things: things_to_process = a_list_of_things[:50]; a_list_of_things = a_list_of_things[50:]`
2016-10-18 08:07:03	deniska	That's how I usually do that :)
2016-10-18 08:07:13	gronke	err rather, this: https://paste.linux.community/view/24ab9277
2016-10-18 08:07:58	gronke	I thought of having two counters, one to count which loop i'm on, and the other to count the overall number
2016-10-18 08:08:12	Yhg1s	gronke: do you want actual counters, or do you just want to process things from a list?
2016-10-18 08:08:13	deniska	gronke: what about solution I suggested?
2016-10-18 08:08:26	gronke	deniska, I dont really understand how to implement that, sorry
2016-10-18 08:08:48	gronke	Yhg1s, I just need the list of numbers, because I will just insert a command in there that i need, and then lable the outfiles accordingly
2016-10-18 08:08:51	deniska	gronke: erm, it's a correct python code
2016-10-18 08:09:08	deniska	list to process might as well be range() object if you need numbers
2016-10-18 08:09:20	gronke	so, for example, with my current code when I try 5 and 2, I get 3 loops that count up to 6, so it's not accounting for the remainder

2016-10-18 08:10:49	Yhg1s	gronke: in your current code, for every item in divs[0] you have to do range(divisions) items. Then, after those divs[0]*division items, you need to do divs[1] items.

2016-10-18 14:23:16	Wild_Cat	Ranieri_: "decimal arithmetic" is arbitrary-precision arithmetic, as implemented by the decimal module in the Python stdlib.
2016-10-18 14:23:57	NoImNotNineVolt	Ranieri_: you don't install packages from pypy. you install packages from pypi. pypy is an implementation of python.
2016-10-18 14:24:27	NoImNotNineVolt	Ranieri_: you can install packages from pypi using pip, among other ways.

2016-10-18 14:24:39	foul_owl	Ah ok...how do I determine what goes there?
2016-10-18 14:24:42	NoImNotNineVolt	but again, i'm 99% sure that bigfloat is _NOT_ what you're looking for.
2016-10-18 14:24:43	Ranieri_	Yeah, I read about Decimal()
2016-10-18 14:24:49	foul_owl	Is there a way to look up what module contains a symbol?

You may have to sandwich a string between regex like "regex = r'\[' + NAME + r'\]'" and that will mean anything with the NAME in brackets (Use "\\[" if not raw string). What pattern do you want to match? The one in the example?

2016-10-18 18:40:40	Random832	the kernel can't buffer it into user memory?
2016-10-18 18:40:48	runciter	not if you use MSG_WAITALL

2016-10-18 18:41:13	runciter	how could it?  it's preventing the syscall from returning until it's read the number of bytes you've requested

2016-10-18 18:42:42	runciter	well, you give it a buffer, but the implementation doesn't copy into the buffer IIRC

2016-10-18 18:44:32	runciter	Random832: well, the real thing would be to read a kernel's source, which i might just do
