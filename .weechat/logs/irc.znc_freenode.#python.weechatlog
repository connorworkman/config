2016-10-17 16:46:47	Elec_A	Hello, May I ask you please explain this line of code : grid = [[1] * 8 for n in range (10)], This is my first time seeing this. I know it will create a 10x8 grid with 1 in each cell, but what kind of syntax is that ?

2016-10-17 16:47:10	KirkMcDonald	Elec_A: It is a list comprehension.
2016-10-17 16:47:17	KirkMcDonald	Elec_A: It is also using sequence multiplication.
2016-10-17 16:47:43	Elec_A	KirkMcDonald: is it faster than using two for loops ?
2016-10-17 16:48:02	KirkMcDonald	Elec_A: A list comprehension is virtually identical to the equivalent code using a for loop.
