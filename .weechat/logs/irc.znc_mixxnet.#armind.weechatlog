2016-10-27 05:16:27	Ahiru	Tubes was easy
2016-10-27 05:16:46	Ahiru	D2T could be Dream to Trance

2016-10-27 05:18:05	D2T	Unfortunately most low end desktops have hdds
2016-10-27 05:18:45	Ahiru	are SSDs as fast and as affordable as HDDs these days?
2016-10-27 05:19:13	firestartersftw	no
2016-10-27 05:19:15	firestartersftw	not yet
2016-10-27 05:19:44	Ahiru	as fast is possible, but affordable? maybe not
2016-10-27 05:20:00	D2T	Theyre getting close.
2016-10-27 05:20:04	+TigerClaw	SSDs are fast, once you get one, you'll never go back to HDDs
2016-10-27 05:20:08	+Tu13es	SSDs are way faster
2016-10-27 05:20:15	+Tu13es	but not cheaper per size
2016-10-27 05:20:30	D2T	I only use hdds in RAID now
2016-10-27 05:20:34	Ahiru	they occupy less space, but I don't know about the heat
2016-10-27 05:20:53	+Tu13es	no movement = less power
2016-10-27 05:21:21	Ahiru	gfx cards barely have movement :)
2016-10-27 05:21:33	Ahiru	but they need their own fan
2016-10-27 05:21:50	+TigerClaw	With SSDs, Windows 10 only takes a few seconds to boot up

2016-10-27 05:22:00	D2T	Revox oh man haha
2016-10-27 05:22:07	firestartersftw	that would be lit
2016-10-27 05:22:15	D2T	Then the holdup would be the network
2016-10-27 05:22:45	+TigerClaw	the bottleneck would just be whatever your CPU and graphics card are
2016-10-27 05:22:54	D2T	For data transfer?
2016-10-27 05:23:01	D2T	Oh
2016-10-27 05:23:05	D2T	In a pc yea
2016-10-27 05:23:46	Ahiru	are they going to drop discs soon?
2016-10-27 05:23:52	+TigerClaw	data transfer depends on what type of network you have, which is why its better going wtih gigabit
2016-10-27 05:23:53	Cihan	<Revox> can google drive play files?
2016-10-27 05:23:54	Cihan	yes
2016-10-27 05:23:57	Ahiru	we could go back to chips

2016-10-27 06:06:20	@Chreddy	firestartersftw what you need is an i7 (preferably the most expensive one), 32gb ram, 10tb hdd, 2 x GTX1080's, water cooling and lots of it

2016-10-27 06:07:44	D2T	i would avoid buying anything on amazon unless it is direct from amazon

2016-10-27 06:08:23	@Chreddy	D2T i guess it depends what you're buying tho? bought quite a few cd's from 3rd party sellers on amazon uk
2016-10-27 06:08:39	D2T	generally i would avoid for larger purchases
2016-10-27 06:08:46	@Chreddy	never had any problems with that.. even one i had to return, cause they sent me a wrong one, lol
2016-10-27 06:08:47	D2T	you have less or no purchase protection
2016-10-27 06:09:00	@Chreddy	they sent me some classical shit, and what i bought was trance

2016-10-27 06:09:09	@Chreddy	i was disappointed, haha
2016-10-27 06:09:10	D2T	because its entirely dependent on the seller, and they dont generally care about negative feedback because it wont change their rating 
2016-10-27 06:09:14	D2T	if they have enough sales
2016-10-27 06:09:18	@Chreddy	i see
2016-10-27 06:10:06	D2T	and if a manufacturer warranty is in the mix, then resellers have to be authorized and legit otherwise the warranty began when THEY bought it

2016-10-27 10:04:25	+Silxx	i'm sure we have a different definition of good, as well as trance
2016-10-27 10:04:40	ANTiP0D	if yes, then sorry, i just wanted to explain my thoughts
2016-10-27 10:04:57	iekue_erander	everyone has a different definition of "good" anyway
2016-10-27 10:04:58	Craveinn	of course Silxx everyone has their own definition

2016-10-27 10:05:33	+Silxx	they don't have a different definition of good, they have a different OPINION of what is good
2016-10-27 10:05:56	ANTiP0D	Silxx stop! I think armin serves us a great trance music which is good
2016-10-27 10:06:05	+Silxx	i know right
2016-10-27 10:06:09	ANTiP0D	no matter what anyone says
2016-10-27 10:06:09	+Silxx	the best in trance and progressive
2016-10-27 10:06:23	iekue_erander	yeah but due to armin and his armada boys u dnt know what else is out there
2016-10-27 10:06:29	ANTiP0D	that music is amazing! I'm listening to his show since I started listening to trance, he brough me into trance
2016-10-27 10:06:40	+Silxx	smallprint: so long as it's signed to an armada label, or incredibly generic and fluffy

2016-10-27 17:07:20	@chreddy	[01:48:14] so how are they supposed to avoid "going marvel with it"? [01:48:14]

2016-10-27 17:07:20	D2T	[01:48:48] they tend to have a few slightly original movies that wind up being fun, then they sequel the shit out of them until theres no difference between the movies [01:48:48]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	D2T	[01:49:29] honestly couldnt tell the difference between the avengers 2, ca 2, ca 3, etc - thor 2 boring as hell, iron man 3 ruins a potentially great villain [01:49:29]

2016-10-28 15:47:45	KrissO	Chreddy also i'm not sure if Voolgarizm is an artist, but after looking at the advert text i interpreted it as it's an alternative mix by mario (the last track)
2016-10-28 15:48:22	@Chreddy	yeah, it's defo an alternative mix, afaik
2016-10-28 15:48:25	@Chreddy	https://soundcloud.com/outburstrecords/sets/mario-piu-thunderstruck
2016-10-28 15:49:22	@Chreddy	or is it? ugh, confusing
2016-10-28 15:49:23	@Chreddy	https://www.beatport.com/artist/voolgarizm/557822/tracks
2016-10-28 15:49:31	@Chreddy	Beatport made an artist entry for Voolgarizm
2016-10-28 15:49:53	KrissO	yeah i saw that
2016-10-28 15:49:59	@Chreddy	and seems like there's two different tracks which both has "Voolgarizm mixes".. so maybe it's an artist after all
2016-10-28 15:49:59	KrissO	but i suspected they were wrong
2016-10-28 15:50:03	KrissO	ohh
2016-10-28 15:50:06	KrissO	i didn't see that
2016-10-28 15:50:06	@Chreddy	thats another possibility
2016-10-28 15:50:16	KrissO	we should tweet/msg mario
2016-10-28 15:50:17	@Chreddy	hehe
2016-10-28 15:50:40	@Chreddy	yeah, would prolly be the best thing to do, in this case
2016-10-28 15:50:49	@Chreddy	if anyone knows what it is, he's the guy, haha
2016-10-28 15:50:55	KrissO	yeah
2016-10-28 15:51:01	@Verena	mennodejong: Thank you for another amazing Menno Solo experience Sydney, it was unreal! If you haven't had& https://t.co/gXepdiAoIT
2016-10-28 15:51:14	KrissO	there is no remix credit
2016-10-28 15:51:16	KrissO	in the booklet
2016-10-28 15:51:27	@Chreddy	i see
2016-10-28 15:51:46	KrissO	but wtf, why didn't u and revox get ur copy yet?
2016-10-28 15:51:52	@Chreddy	imo the only correct thing to do, is use Remix whenever someone remixed a track, and Mix (not remix) when it's some kind of alternative mix
2016-10-28 15:51:59	@Chreddy	but obviously not everyone does it like that
2016-10-28 15:52:11	KrissO	Mix?
2016-10-28 15:52:23	@Chreddy	dunno KrissO.. both of us pre-ordered on the solarshop
2016-10-28 15:52:26	@Chreddy	hopefully withijn a few days tho
2016-10-28 15:52:30	KrissO	you mean Mixed by? that's a technical credit
2016-10-28 15:52:33	@Chreddy	was shipped on 25th iirc
2016-10-28 15:52:40	KrissO	ok
2016-10-28 15:53:09	@Chreddy	no, i mean Voolgarizm Mix instead of Voolgarizm Remix (like the PT5 artwork says)
2016-10-28 15:53:27	@Chreddy	would be better to write Remix if another artist remixed the track imo
2016-10-28 15:53:35	KrissO	ahh yes
2016-10-28 15:53:40	@Chreddy	instead of just "mix-title-whatever-whatever Mix"
2016-10-28 15:54:07	KrissO	sometimes it's random if they use mix/remix. i was thinking in this case it was intention
2016-10-28 15:54:32	@Chreddy	hehe yeah, no idea
2016-10-28 15:54:34	@Chreddy	:D
2016-10-28 15:54:39	@Chreddy	sunnnnnnnnnnnnset boulevaaaaaaaaaaard

2016-10-30 11:32:44	SasCologne	D2T: http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/28/13460496/apple-macbook-pro-16gb-ram-battery-life-phil-schiller you seen that yet?
2016-10-30 11:32:44		[11:32]
2016-10-30 11:32:49	D2T	yup
2016-10-30 11:32:53	SasCologne	hilarious
2016-10-30 11:32:58	D2T	worst macbooks ever
2016-10-30 11:33:04	D2T	theyre gonna sell jack shit
2016-10-30 11:33:13	D2T	even die hard apple nuts are pissed off
2016-10-30 11:34:32	D2T	- New MacBook Pro Has Better Keyboard Than 12-Inch MacBook, But It's Expensive and Lacking Ports
2016-10-30 11:34:33	D2T	- New MacBook Pros Max Out at 16GB RAM Due to Battery Life Concerns
2016-10-30 11:34:33	D2T	- Apple Says It's Out of the Standalone Display Business
2016-10-30 11:34:38	D2T	- New MacBook Pros Don't Include Backlit Apple Logo or Power Extension Cable
2016-10-30 11:34:38	D2T	- Thunderbolt 3 Ports on Right Side of 13-Inch MacBook Pro Have Reduced PCI Express Bandwidth
2016-10-30 11:34:38	D2T	- Apple Continues to Sell Base Model 2015 MacBook Pros at Same Price Points (ty @Pentium)
2016-10-30 11:36:29	SasCologne	New MacBook Pros Don't Include Backlit Apple Logo << well that's a deal breaker
2016-10-30 11:36:40	SasCologne	how else can people in a dark room see that i'm using a macbook?
2016-10-30 11:37:38	D2T	it was always just a fun feature. also used to be nice to know if the thing was in sleep mode or not when closing the screen
2016-10-30 11:37:50	D2T	not icluding the extended power cable is ridiculous
2016-10-30 11:38:00	D2T	theyre charging $19 for a 6 ft extension
2016-10-30 11:38:04	D2T	that used to be included with everything
2016-10-30 11:39:14	D2T	moral of the story: keep the thing thicker, add more battery, add more ram, leave SD card and ports, cut price even a couple hundred would make it more reasonable.
2016-10-30 11:39:25	D2T	then you actually have a pro laptop and not a piece of shit
2016-10-30 11:45:00		[11:39]
2016-10-30 11:47:31	SasCologne	yep
2016-10-30 11:47:36	SasCologne	or if you keep the price, make it proper pro
2016-10-30 11:47:46	SasCologne	not this shit, no dedicate GPU, only dual core
2016-10-30 11:47:50	SasCologne	just to make it thinner, that's not pro
2016-10-30 11:48:06	SasCologne	and I don't think the current ones are too heavy or thick for anyone
2016-10-30 11:52:04	FuZzCasT	can't you install OSX on normal laptops?
2016-10-30 11:52:17	FuZzCasT	of whatever the latest version of Apple OS is
2016-10-30 11:52:20	FuZzCasT	or*
2016-10-30 11:53:00	@Verena	Super8Tab: Hello Mexico! We are so excited and ready for #groovecruise 
2016-10-30 11:55:00	@Revox	D2T: I still havent order one yet and I actually might not
2016-10-30 11:55:22	SasCologne	FuZzCasT: not really
2016-10-30 11:55:42	SasCologne	you can get linux distros that are very similar to OSX nowadays though
