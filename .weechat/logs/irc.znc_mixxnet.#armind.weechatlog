2016-10-27 05:16:27	Ahiru	Tubes was easy
2016-10-27 05:16:46	Ahiru	D2T could be Dream to Trance

2016-10-27 05:18:05	D2T	Unfortunately most low end desktops have hdds
2016-10-27 05:18:45	Ahiru	are SSDs as fast and as affordable as HDDs these days?
2016-10-27 05:19:13	firestartersftw	no
2016-10-27 05:19:15	firestartersftw	not yet
2016-10-27 05:19:44	Ahiru	as fast is possible, but affordable? maybe not
2016-10-27 05:20:00	D2T	Theyre getting close.
2016-10-27 05:20:04	+TigerClaw	SSDs are fast, once you get one, you'll never go back to HDDs
2016-10-27 05:20:08	+Tu13es	SSDs are way faster
2016-10-27 05:20:15	+Tu13es	but not cheaper per size
2016-10-27 05:20:30	D2T	I only use hdds in RAID now
2016-10-27 05:20:34	Ahiru	they occupy less space, but I don't know about the heat
2016-10-27 05:20:53	+Tu13es	no movement = less power
2016-10-27 05:21:21	Ahiru	gfx cards barely have movement :)
2016-10-27 05:21:33	Ahiru	but they need their own fan
2016-10-27 05:21:50	+TigerClaw	With SSDs, Windows 10 only takes a few seconds to boot up

2016-10-27 05:22:00	D2T	Revox oh man haha
2016-10-27 05:22:07	firestartersftw	that would be lit
2016-10-27 05:22:15	D2T	Then the holdup would be the network
2016-10-27 05:22:45	+TigerClaw	the bottleneck would just be whatever your CPU and graphics card are
2016-10-27 05:22:54	D2T	For data transfer?
2016-10-27 05:23:01	D2T	Oh
2016-10-27 05:23:05	D2T	In a pc yea
2016-10-27 05:23:46	Ahiru	are they going to drop discs soon?
2016-10-27 05:23:52	+TigerClaw	data transfer depends on what type of network you have, which is why its better going wtih gigabit
2016-10-27 05:23:53	Cihan	<Revox> can google drive play files?
2016-10-27 05:23:54	Cihan	yes
2016-10-27 05:23:57	Ahiru	we could go back to chips

2016-10-27 06:06:20	@Chreddy	firestartersftw what you need is an i7 (preferably the most expensive one), 32gb ram, 10tb hdd, 2 x GTX1080's, water cooling and lots of it

2016-10-27 06:07:44	D2T	i would avoid buying anything on amazon unless it is direct from amazon

2016-10-27 06:08:23	@Chreddy	D2T i guess it depends what you're buying tho? bought quite a few cd's from 3rd party sellers on amazon uk
2016-10-27 06:08:39	D2T	generally i would avoid for larger purchases
2016-10-27 06:08:46	@Chreddy	never had any problems with that.. even one i had to return, cause they sent me a wrong one, lol
2016-10-27 06:08:47	D2T	you have less or no purchase protection
2016-10-27 06:09:00	@Chreddy	they sent me some classical shit, and what i bought was trance

2016-10-27 06:09:09	@Chreddy	i was disappointed, haha
2016-10-27 06:09:10	D2T	because its entirely dependent on the seller, and they dont generally care about negative feedback because it wont change their rating 
2016-10-27 06:09:14	D2T	if they have enough sales
2016-10-27 06:09:18	@Chreddy	i see
2016-10-27 06:10:06	D2T	and if a manufacturer warranty is in the mix, then resellers have to be authorized and legit otherwise the warranty began when THEY bought it

2016-10-27 10:04:25	+Silxx	i'm sure we have a different definition of good, as well as trance
2016-10-27 10:04:40	ANTiP0D	if yes, then sorry, i just wanted to explain my thoughts
2016-10-27 10:04:57	iekue_erander	everyone has a different definition of "good" anyway
2016-10-27 10:04:58	Craveinn	of course Silxx everyone has their own definition

2016-10-27 10:05:33	+Silxx	they don't have a different definition of good, they have a different OPINION of what is good
2016-10-27 10:05:56	ANTiP0D	Silxx stop! I think armin serves us a great trance music which is good
2016-10-27 10:06:05	+Silxx	i know right
2016-10-27 10:06:09	ANTiP0D	no matter what anyone says
2016-10-27 10:06:09	+Silxx	the best in trance and progressive
2016-10-27 10:06:23	iekue_erander	yeah but due to armin and his armada boys u dnt know what else is out there
2016-10-27 10:06:29	ANTiP0D	that music is amazing! I'm listening to his show since I started listening to trance, he brough me into trance
2016-10-27 10:06:40	+Silxx	smallprint: so long as it's signed to an armada label, or incredibly generic and fluffy

2016-10-27 17:07:20	@chreddy	[01:48:14] so how are they supposed to avoid "going marvel with it"? [01:48:14]

2016-10-27 17:07:20	D2T	[01:48:48] they tend to have a few slightly original movies that wind up being fun, then they sequel the shit out of them until theres no difference between the movies [01:48:48]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	D2T	[01:49:29] honestly couldnt tell the difference between the avengers 2, ca 2, ca 3, etc - thor 2 boring as hell, iron man 3 ruins a potentially great villain [01:49:29]

2016-10-28 15:47:45	KrissO	Chreddy also i'm not sure if Voolgarizm is an artist, but after looking at the advert text i interpreted it as it's an alternative mix by mario (the last track)
2016-10-28 15:48:22	@Chreddy	yeah, it's defo an alternative mix, afaik
2016-10-28 15:48:25	@Chreddy	https://soundcloud.com/outburstrecords/sets/mario-piu-thunderstruck
2016-10-28 15:49:22	@Chreddy	or is it? ugh, confusing
2016-10-28 15:49:23	@Chreddy	https://www.beatport.com/artist/voolgarizm/557822/tracks
2016-10-28 15:49:31	@Chreddy	Beatport made an artist entry for Voolgarizm
2016-10-28 15:49:53	KrissO	yeah i saw that
2016-10-28 15:49:59	@Chreddy	and seems like there's two different tracks which both has "Voolgarizm mixes".. so maybe it's an artist after all
2016-10-28 15:49:59	KrissO	but i suspected they were wrong
2016-10-28 15:50:03	KrissO	ohh
2016-10-28 15:50:06	KrissO	i didn't see that
2016-10-28 15:50:06	@Chreddy	thats another possibility
2016-10-28 15:50:16	KrissO	we should tweet/msg mario
2016-10-28 15:50:17	@Chreddy	hehe
2016-10-28 15:50:40	@Chreddy	yeah, would prolly be the best thing to do, in this case
2016-10-28 15:50:49	@Chreddy	if anyone knows what it is, he's the guy, haha
2016-10-28 15:50:55	KrissO	yeah
2016-10-28 15:51:01	@Verena	mennodejong: Thank you for another amazing Menno Solo experience Sydney, it was unreal! If you haven't had& https://t.co/gXepdiAoIT
2016-10-28 15:51:14	KrissO	there is no remix credit
2016-10-28 15:51:16	KrissO	in the booklet
2016-10-28 15:51:27	@Chreddy	i see
2016-10-28 15:51:46	KrissO	but wtf, why didn't u and revox get ur copy yet?
2016-10-28 15:51:52	@Chreddy	imo the only correct thing to do, is use Remix whenever someone remixed a track, and Mix (not remix) when it's some kind of alternative mix
2016-10-28 15:51:59	@Chreddy	but obviously not everyone does it like that
2016-10-28 15:52:11	KrissO	Mix?
2016-10-28 15:52:23	@Chreddy	dunno KrissO.. both of us pre-ordered on the solarshop
2016-10-28 15:52:26	@Chreddy	hopefully withijn a few days tho
2016-10-28 15:52:30	KrissO	you mean Mixed by? that's a technical credit
2016-10-28 15:52:33	@Chreddy	was shipped on 25th iirc
2016-10-28 15:52:40	KrissO	ok
2016-10-28 15:53:09	@Chreddy	no, i mean Voolgarizm Mix instead of Voolgarizm Remix (like the PT5 artwork says)
2016-10-28 15:53:27	@Chreddy	would be better to write Remix if another artist remixed the track imo
2016-10-28 15:53:35	KrissO	ahh yes
2016-10-28 15:53:40	@Chreddy	instead of just "mix-title-whatever-whatever Mix"
2016-10-28 15:54:07	KrissO	sometimes it's random if they use mix/remix. i was thinking in this case it was intention
2016-10-28 15:54:32	@Chreddy	hehe yeah, no idea
2016-10-28 15:54:34	@Chreddy	:D
2016-10-28 15:54:39	@Chreddy	sunnnnnnnnnnnnset boulevaaaaaaaaaaard

2016-10-30 11:32:44		[11:32]
2016-10-30 11:32:49	D2T	yup
2016-10-30 11:32:53	SasCologne	hilarious
2016-10-30 11:32:58	D2T	worst macbooks ever
2016-10-30 11:33:04	D2T	theyre gonna sell jack shit
2016-10-30 11:33:13	D2T	even die hard apple nuts are pissed off
2016-10-30 11:34:32	D2T	- New MacBook Pro Has Better Keyboard Than 12-Inch MacBook, But It's Expensive and Lacking Ports
2016-10-30 11:34:33	D2T	- New MacBook Pros Max Out at 16GB RAM Due to Battery Life Concerns
2016-10-30 11:34:33	D2T	- Apple Says It's Out of the Standalone Display Business
2016-10-30 11:34:38	D2T	- New MacBook Pros Don't Include Backlit Apple Logo or Power Extension Cable
2016-10-30 11:34:38	D2T	- Thunderbolt 3 Ports on Right Side of 13-Inch MacBook Pro Have Reduced PCI Express Bandwidth
2016-10-30 11:34:38	D2T	- Apple Continues to Sell Base Model 2015 MacBook Pros at Same Price Points (ty @Pentium)
2016-10-30 11:36:29	SasCologne	New MacBook Pros Don't Include Backlit Apple Logo << well that's a deal breaker
2016-10-30 11:36:40	SasCologne	how else can people in a dark room see that i'm using a macbook?
2016-10-30 11:37:38	D2T	it was always just a fun feature. also used to be nice to know if the thing was in sleep mode or not when closing the screen
2016-10-30 11:37:50	D2T	not icluding the extended power cable is ridiculous
2016-10-30 11:38:00	D2T	theyre charging $19 for a 6 ft extension
2016-10-30 11:38:04	D2T	that used to be included with everything
2016-10-30 11:39:14	D2T	moral of the story: keep the thing thicker, add more battery, add more ram, leave SD card and ports, cut price even a couple hundred would make it more reasonable.
2016-10-30 11:39:25	D2T	then you actually have a pro laptop and not a piece of shit
2016-10-30 11:45:00		[11:39]
2016-10-30 11:47:31	SasCologne	yep
2016-10-30 11:47:36	SasCologne	or if you keep the price, make it proper pro
2016-10-30 11:47:46	SasCologne	not this shit, no dedicate GPU, only dual core
2016-10-30 11:47:50	SasCologne	just to make it thinner, that's not pro
2016-10-30 11:48:06	SasCologne	and I don't think the current ones are too heavy or thick for anyone
2016-10-30 11:52:04	FuZzCasT	can't you install OSX on normal laptops?
2016-10-30 11:52:17	FuZzCasT	of whatever the latest version of Apple OS is
2016-10-30 11:52:20	FuZzCasT	or*
2016-10-30 11:53:00	@Verena	Super8Tab: Hello Mexico! We are so excited and ready for #groovecruise

2016-10-30 11:55:22	SasCologne	FuZzCasT: not really
2016-10-30 11:55:42	SasCologne	you can get linux distros that are very similar to OSX nowadays though

2016-10-31 05:31:23	+wolv``	First-generation immigrants
2016-10-31 05:31:28	+wolv``	if I'd move to the states right now
2016-10-31 05:31:34	+wolv``	would that make me a first-generation immigrant?
2016-10-31 05:31:43	@Revox	eh
2016-10-31 05:32:40	@Revox	yes
2016-10-31 05:32:54	@Revox	altho it might have an age thing to it
2016-10-31 05:33:13	+wolv``	The term first-generation can refer to either people who were born in one country and relocated to another at a young age, or to their children born in the country they have relocated to. The term second-generation refers to children of first-generation immigrants, and thus exhibits the same ambiguity.
2016-10-31 05:33:13	@Revox	yes it does
2016-10-31 05:33:24	@Revox	so I guess under 10
2016-10-31 05:33:29	@Revox	so then no
2016-10-31 05:34:08	@Revox	altho
2016-10-31 05:34:17	@Revox	In the United States[edit]
2016-10-31 05:34:17	@Revox	First generation immigrant: immigrant who migrated to the U.S.
2016-10-31 05:34:18	@Revox	Second generation immigrant: U.S.-born children of at least one foreign-born parent.

2016-10-31 17:57:16	firestartersftw	what do you think
2016-10-31 17:57:19	@Chreddy	and some people might say that it's not worth getting the new 3ds because of SNES games only.. funny enough, i've only heard that reason from people who lived to play snes games earlier in their lives :P
2016-10-31 17:57:42	D2T	haha. The control stick is nice - and it does load smash bros much faster
2016-10-31 17:57:45	@Chreddy	sure, the snes was alive while i was, but it was replaced by the n64, before i started doing gaming.. and for nintendo home consoles, i didn't really start before the wii
2016-10-31 17:57:50	firestartersftw	speaking of smash bros
2016-10-31 17:57:56	D2T	then theres this Yoshi Edition on Amazon - https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91DXuemEHdL._AC_SL1500_.jpg

2016-10-31 18:00:21	@Chreddy	if they ever make a snes mini, i hope they add more than just 30 games.. cause that isn't enough, for the best nintendo console ever released, haha
2016-10-31 18:00:43	@Chreddy	and if they can't add more than 30 games, then at least make some kind of store, where you can buy more games to add yourself
2016-10-31 18:00:48	D2T	probably not. cant include licensed games
2016-10-31 18:00:50	@Chreddy	or something similar

2016-11-01 10:04:21	D2T	those comments should help
2016-11-01 10:04:31	D2T	its brutality
2016-11-01 10:08:47	@Revox	it's not helping
2016-11-01 10:09:38	@Revox	I kinda just want to get that 13" esc one
2016-11-01 10:09:39	daniel	D2T
2016-11-01 10:09:41	daniel	you're not helping
2016-11-01 10:10:05	D2T	"Apple no longer makes anything I care to buy. Flat statement. Sad to admit after nearly 30 years of buying their products but true. Apple could care less what its customers think or say or want, it seems."
2016-11-01 10:10:18	D2T	thats basically me
2016-11-01 10:10:30	@Revox	it's always been like that
2016-11-01 10:10:50	@Revox	also it's a populair thing to shit on what they do
2016-11-01 10:11:26	@Revox	however 1 thing I do agree is that apple is focused way more on their profit generator the iphone
2016-11-01 10:11:29	D2T	"Those complaining about Apple’s current Mac lineup are not haters, they’re lovers. They’ve spent 10+ years and 5+ figures on Macs.
2016-11-01 10:11:30	D2T	These aren’t Luddites who simply hate change. These are people who already had blank checks written to Apple but had to tear up the checks."
2016-11-01 10:11:48	@Revox	yea I read that too
2016-11-01 10:11:55	@Revox	but whats the problem?
2016-11-01 10:11:59	D2T	16GB RAM limits on a $3200 laptop is bewildering to me. If the strategy here is to kill off the Mac brand, while focusing only on the iPhone, then I think they are well on their way.
2016-11-01 10:12:03	D2T	shit like tjat
2016-11-01 10:12:24	@Revox	that's intels fault in part
2016-11-01 10:12:38	D2T	no its apples, schiller admits it they didnt want to put in a 32gb controller
2016-11-01 10:12:46	@Revox	correct cause
2016-11-01 10:12:55	@Revox	that will not be the DDR4L
2016-11-01 10:12:58	@Revox	or whatever the naming
2016-11-01 10:12:59	@Revox	is
2016-11-01 10:13:01	@Revox	but DDR3
2016-11-01 10:13:08	@Revox	look at the surface book
2016-11-01 10:13:10	@Revox	same reason
2016-11-01 10:13:11	D2T	yea and they still use DDR3 or ddr3l
2016-11-01 10:13:11	D2T	lol
2016-11-01 10:13:51	@Revox	LPDDR
2016-11-01 10:13:52	D2T	well the nice thing about surface pro is that ther are other options out there around the same price with higher specs if you want a windows laptop that can actually do things
2016-11-01 10:13:57	@Revox	indeed they do
2016-11-01 10:14:16	@Revox	regardless
2016-11-01 10:14:23	@Revox	again
2016-11-01 10:14:28	@Revox	what's the problem?
2016-11-01 10:14:44	D2T	apple isnt offering a useful laptop for a large majority of their market 
2016-11-01 10:14:47	D2T	is the problem
2016-11-01 10:14:51	@Revox	so?
2016-11-01 10:14:57	@Revox	that means I shouldn't buy it?
2016-11-01 10:15:02	@Revox	listen to people complain?
2016-11-01 10:15:02		[10:15]
2016-11-01 10:15:04	@Revox	fuck that
2016-11-01 10:15:06	D2T	i mean u can waste ur money
2016-11-01 10:15:07	D2T	lol
2016-11-01 10:15:13	@Revox	indeed
2016-11-01 10:15:15	D2T	but its not offering a benefit over what you have already
2016-11-01 10:15:23	@Revox	I disagree
2016-11-01 10:15:27	D2T	then buy it
2016-11-01 10:15:28	D2T	lol
2016-11-01 10:15:35	@Revox	the color is different
2016-11-01 10:15:37	@Revox	hehe

2016-11-01 10:16:14	@Revox	and I might buy 2
2016-11-01 10:16:23	@Revox	there's one thing I hate tho
2016-11-01 10:16:25	@Revox	REALLY hate
2016-11-01 10:16:38	@Revox	the delivery time
2016-11-01 10:16:46	@Revox	ffs why is it 4-5 weeks?
2016-11-01 10:16:53	@Revox	same with the apple watch why is it 3-4 weeks?
2016-11-01 10:16:55	@Revox	I WANT IT NOW
2016-11-01 10:17:14	@Revox	that reason makes me not want to get it more than hardware limitations or prices
2016-11-01 10:17:16	+Battaglin	foxconn is on strike!!
2016-11-01 10:17:17	+Battaglin	haha

2016-11-01 10:18:48	@Revox	I don't

2016-11-01 10:29:01	@Revox	sometimes it would be easier to be poor
2016-11-01 10:29:07	@Revox	then I wouldn't even have to think
2016-11-01 10:29:28	D2T	no, you would have to think constantly "should i get this and not be able to pay rent"
2016-11-01 10:29:37	D2T	"oh i have bed bugs but cant afford anything to get rid of them"
2016-11-01 10:29:45	@Revox	that's a US thing
2016-11-01 10:29:50	firestartersftw	revox
2016-11-01 10:29:53	@Revox	hello
2016-11-01 10:29:56	firestartersftw	hey
2016-11-01 10:30:09	firestartersftw	You've built a raid, right?
2016-11-01 10:30:09		[10:30]
2016-11-01 10:30:14	D2T	lol
2016-11-01 10:30:18	D2T	Raid 10 or bust
2016-11-01 10:30:21	D2T	do not use raid 5 or 6
2016-11-01 10:30:23	@Revox	yes why?
2016-11-01 10:30:35	firestartersftw	well
2016-11-01 10:30:39	SasCologne	yolo raid ftw
2016-11-01 10:30:41	SasCologne	raid 0
2016-11-01 10:30:43	D2T	haha
2016-11-01 10:30:51	firestartersftw	It was suggested at a meeting that the station get a raid
2016-11-01 10:30:54	@Revox	raid is not a replacement for backup
2016-11-01 10:31:07	firestartersftw	what's your suggestion then
2016-11-01 10:31:12	SasCologne	you can raid in WoW too
2016-11-01 10:31:15	SasCologne	its fun
2016-11-01 10:31:21	@Revox	the only reason to put something in raid is for redudancy
2016-11-01 10:31:25	firestartersftw	I might work on it this winter since all my friends are gone
2016-11-01 10:31:36	D2T	Revox speaks truth
2016-11-01 10:31:45	@Revox	meaning if a harddrive dies and you have raid it might keep running
2016-11-01 10:31:46	D2T	raid is not a backup
2016-11-01 10:31:59	firestartersftw	I was originally just going to get a 4tb nas for the mini station but hte big station needs something 
2016-11-01 10:32:01	@Revox	that's why you see it in enterprises
2016-11-01 10:32:26	firestartersftw	revox at the moment our whole system is redundant
2016-11-01 10:32:33	@Revox	how?
2016-11-01 10:32:41	firestartersftw	there's one computer that constantly reads to another each time it's updated
2016-11-01 10:32:42	@Revox	mutiple computers?
2016-11-01 10:32:44	firestartersftw	yes
2016-11-01 10:32:53	firestartersftw	one in the live station and one in the production room
2016-11-01 10:32:54	@Revox	then there's less need for raid
2016-11-01 10:33:02	firestartersftw	well we want to have a single system
2016-11-01 10:33:04	@Revox	cause you solved it another way
2016-11-01 10:33:08	@Revox	aah
2016-11-01 10:33:13	firestartersftw	yeah but it's a shitty system
2016-11-01 10:33:21	firestartersftw	if one crashes we're fucked
2016-11-01 10:33:28	@Revox	yes
2016-11-01 10:33:28	firestartersftw	we go off air for 40k people
2016-11-01 10:33:42	SasCologne	for a proper backup you also need an off-site backup across the country
2016-11-01 10:33:43	@Revox	I'd still suggest 2 tho instead of raid
2016-11-01 10:34:07	firestartersftw	we want to change this so we still have a backup for if one system shuts down
2016-11-01 10:34:26	@Revox	raid only makes storage redudant
2016-11-01 10:34:28	firestartersftw	why do you prefer 2
2016-11-01 10:34:31	@Revox	not soundcards
2016-11-01 10:34:31	firestartersftw	curious
2016-11-01 10:34:36	@Revox	or other hardware
2016-11-01 10:34:39	@Revox	you might need
2016-11-01 10:34:40	+Battaglin	lol SasCologne 
2016-11-01 10:34:41	firestartersftw	i see
2016-11-01 10:34:45	firestartersftw	educate me 
2016-11-01 10:34:47	+Battaglin	raid in WOW too
2016-11-01 10:34:58	firestartersftw	because i want to do a massive tech project for the station this winter
2016-11-01 10:35:04	daniel	all depends on what IO or read/write capacity you need
2016-11-01 10:35:20	@Revox	if you now have 2 computers
2016-11-01 10:35:24	@Revox	you have 2 of everything
2016-11-01 10:35:32	firestartersftw	not really
2016-11-01 10:35:38	firestartersftw	only one goes out live
2016-11-01 10:35:42	D2T	Battaglin hahaha
2016-11-01 10:35:42	@Revox	yes
2016-11-01 10:35:45	D2T	Battaglin youre helping
2016-11-01 10:35:56	@Revox	but you can switch right?
2016-11-01 10:36:00	firestartersftw	not really
2016-11-01 10:36:23	@Revox	ok well then I don't know
2016-11-01 10:36:33	firestartersftw	one, called MOTHER, is in the production studio. Everytime there is an update, DAUGHTER gets it from the live studio and broadcasts on air
2016-11-01 10:36:43	SasCologne	so PC
2016-11-01 10:36:45	@Revox	right
2016-11-01 10:36:53	firestartersftw	if daughter goes down we're fucked
2016-11-01 10:36:55	firestartersftw	and it has
2016-11-01 10:36:59	SasCologne	that's called master/slave in normal non-PC speech :P
2016-11-01 10:37:04	@Revox	why did it go down?
2016-11-01 10:37:11	firestartersftw	outages
2016-11-01 10:37:15	@Revox	what kind?
2016-11-01 10:37:16	firestartersftw	the pcs are all old af
2016-11-01 10:37:23	firestartersftw	electrical
2016-11-01 10:37:29	@Revox	not helping
2016-11-01 10:37:32	firestartersftw	we have a generator backup
2016-11-01 10:37:35	@Revox	did the harddrive die?
2016-11-01 10:37:40	firestartersftw	no
2016-11-01 10:37:56	@Revox	so then even if you had raid it would not have helped you
2016-11-01 10:37:57	firestartersftw	we also want something that can support more data
2016-11-01 10:38:04	firestartersftw	so then what would help
2016-11-01 10:38:20	@Revox	you want the 2 systems to become 1?
2016-11-01 10:38:33	firestartersftw	yes
2016-11-01 10:38:38	@Revox	ok get one with raid
2016-11-01 10:38:43	firestartersftw	ok
2016-11-01 10:38:59	@Revox	however be aware of what that is and what you need to do
2016-11-01 10:39:35	@Revox	most consumer level raid might not support hotswap
2016-11-01 10:39:37	firestartersftw	ok
2016-11-01 10:39:47	@Revox	which means you might need to turn it off
2016-11-01 10:39:48	firestartersftw	we want something past consumer level maybe
2016-11-01 10:39:53	firestartersftw	we're a business
2016-11-01 10:40:13	firestartersftw	run by people used to "old-school" setups
2016-11-01 10:40:27	firestartersftw	when i say old-school, they don't really know about digital networking
2016-11-01 10:40:32	firestartersftw	that's why I'm asking here
2016-11-01 10:40:40	@Revox	and again raid only protects against 1 harddrive failing
2016-11-01 10:40:50	@Revox	be sure to have backups
2016-11-01 10:40:51	@Revox	always
2016-11-01 10:40:52	firestartersftw	ok
2016-11-01 10:41:25	firestartersftw	rn we have basically no backups
2016-11-01 10:41:26	@Revox	if anything else in the computer dies it won't help you
2016-11-01 10:41:30	firestartersftw	we don't really have a server
2016-11-01 10:41:39	firestartersftw	we want to set up one
2016-11-01 10:41:43	@Revox	yes
2016-11-01 10:41:55	@Revox	make that a priority
2016-11-01 10:41:56	firestartersftw	i truly thought we had a server till recently so that's a goal for this winter
2016-11-01 10:41:57	firestartersftw	ok
2016-11-01 10:42:11	@Revox	atleast have some backup
2016-11-01 10:42:19	firestartersftw	i'll probably be messaging incessantly about this over the course of the next couple months
2016-11-01 10:42:31	firestartersftw	yeah we really need backup
2016-11-01 10:42:55	@Revox	if you lost everything you are in trouble
2016-11-01 10:43:20	firestartersftw	yeah
2016-11-01 10:43:29	firestartersftw	rn we have print outs of old logs lol
2016-11-01 10:43:35	firestartersftw	it's a shitty system
2016-11-01 10:43:53	firestartersftw	stuck in the 90s as people who tune in to my shows like to say haha
2016-11-01 10:44:11	@Revox	also be aware I don't like giving advise cause if you follow it and everything goes to shit it's my fault and I don't want that
2016-11-01 10:44:23	firestartersftw	I'm not going to blame you if things go to shit
2016-11-01 10:44:33	firestartersftw	that's why i plan on planning things out with you
2016-11-01 10:44:36	@Revox	even if you don't
2016-11-01 10:44:55	@Revox	I will feel sorry I'll worry and get anxious
2016-11-01 10:44:59	@Revox	and that's not good for me
2016-11-01 10:45:01	firestartersftw	any sort of building wouldn't start till january
2016-11-01 10:45:08	firestartersftw	rest of the term is just planning
2016-11-01 10:45:18	@Revox	I'm not going to be part of any planning
2016-11-01 10:45:18		[10:45]
2016-11-01 10:45:21	firestartersftw	ok
2016-11-01 10:45:27	firestartersftw	but can i ask you questions?
2016-11-01 10:45:38	firestartersftw	I don't know much about this kind of stuff
2016-11-01 10:46:08	@Revox	I rather you wouldn't
2016-11-01 10:46:35	@Revox	and that's has nothing to do with you
2016-11-01 10:46:37	@Revox	but with me
2016-11-01 10:47:07	firestartersftw	am i allowed to discuss it in here

2016-11-01 10:48:10	@Revox	I don't know how people can do it
2016-11-01 10:48:20	@Revox	I would be so emotionaly invested
2016-11-01 10:48:42	SasCologne	21:40:43 <@Revox> and again raid only protects against 1 harddrive failing <<< ehh, depends on the configuration

2016-11-02 08:39:42	iUSAJerry	He picks over the top stuff to show that you people are so sensitive to stuff that doesn't matter. It's satire
