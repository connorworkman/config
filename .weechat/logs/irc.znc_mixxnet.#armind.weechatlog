2016-10-27 05:16:27	Ahiru	Tubes was easy
2016-10-27 05:16:46	Ahiru	D2T could be Dream to Trance

2016-10-27 05:18:05	D2T	Unfortunately most low end desktops have hdds
2016-10-27 05:18:45	Ahiru	are SSDs as fast and as affordable as HDDs these days?
2016-10-27 05:19:13	firestartersftw	no
2016-10-27 05:19:15	firestartersftw	not yet
2016-10-27 05:19:44	Ahiru	as fast is possible, but affordable? maybe not
2016-10-27 05:20:00	D2T	Theyre getting close.
2016-10-27 05:20:04	+TigerClaw	SSDs are fast, once you get one, you'll never go back to HDDs
2016-10-27 05:20:08	+Tu13es	SSDs are way faster
2016-10-27 05:20:15	+Tu13es	but not cheaper per size
2016-10-27 05:20:30	D2T	I only use hdds in RAID now
2016-10-27 05:20:34	Ahiru	they occupy less space, but I don't know about the heat
2016-10-27 05:20:53	+Tu13es	no movement = less power
2016-10-27 05:21:21	Ahiru	gfx cards barely have movement :)
2016-10-27 05:21:33	Ahiru	but they need their own fan
2016-10-27 05:21:50	+TigerClaw	With SSDs, Windows 10 only takes a few seconds to boot up

2016-10-27 05:22:00	D2T	Revox oh man haha
2016-10-27 05:22:07	firestartersftw	that would be lit
2016-10-27 05:22:15	D2T	Then the holdup would be the network
2016-10-27 05:22:45	+TigerClaw	the bottleneck would just be whatever your CPU and graphics card are
2016-10-27 05:22:54	D2T	For data transfer?
2016-10-27 05:23:01	D2T	Oh
2016-10-27 05:23:05	D2T	In a pc yea
2016-10-27 05:23:46	Ahiru	are they going to drop discs soon?
2016-10-27 05:23:52	+TigerClaw	data transfer depends on what type of network you have, which is why its better going wtih gigabit
2016-10-27 05:23:53	Cihan	<Revox> can google drive play files?
2016-10-27 05:23:54	Cihan	yes
2016-10-27 05:23:57	Ahiru	we could go back to chips

2016-10-27 06:06:20	@Chreddy	firestartersftw what you need is an i7 (preferably the most expensive one), 32gb ram, 10tb hdd, 2 x GTX1080's, water cooling and lots of it

2016-10-27 06:07:44	D2T	i would avoid buying anything on amazon unless it is direct from amazon

2016-10-27 06:08:23	@Chreddy	D2T i guess it depends what you're buying tho? bought quite a few cd's from 3rd party sellers on amazon uk
2016-10-27 06:08:39	D2T	generally i would avoid for larger purchases
2016-10-27 06:08:46	@Chreddy	never had any problems with that.. even one i had to return, cause they sent me a wrong one, lol
2016-10-27 06:08:47	D2T	you have less or no purchase protection
2016-10-27 06:09:00	@Chreddy	they sent me some classical shit, and what i bought was trance

2016-10-27 06:09:09	@Chreddy	i was disappointed, haha
2016-10-27 06:09:10	D2T	because its entirely dependent on the seller, and they dont generally care about negative feedback because it wont change their rating 
2016-10-27 06:09:14	D2T	if they have enough sales
2016-10-27 06:09:18	@Chreddy	i see
2016-10-27 06:10:06	D2T	and if a manufacturer warranty is in the mix, then resellers have to be authorized and legit otherwise the warranty began when THEY bought it

2016-10-27 10:03:42	+Silxx	blindly follow armin
2016-10-27 10:03:43	ANTiP0D	I dont think so! I follow also other armada djs
2016-10-27 10:03:48	+Silxx	no matter what shit he plays

2016-10-27 10:04:25	+Silxx	i'm sure we have a different definition of good, as well as trance
2016-10-27 10:04:40	ANTiP0D	if yes, then sorry, i just wanted to explain my thoughts
2016-10-27 10:04:57	iekue_erander	everyone has a different definition of "good" anyway
2016-10-27 10:04:58	Craveinn	of course Silxx everyone has their own definition

2016-10-27 10:05:33	+Silxx	they don't have a different definition of good, they have a different OPINION of what is good
2016-10-27 10:05:56	ANTiP0D	Silxx stop! I think armin serves us a great trance music which is good
2016-10-27 10:06:05	+Silxx	i know right
2016-10-27 10:06:09	ANTiP0D	no matter what anyone says
2016-10-27 10:06:09	+Silxx	the best in trance and progressive
2016-10-27 10:06:23	iekue_erander	yeah but due to armin and his armada boys u dnt know what else is out there
2016-10-27 10:06:29	ANTiP0D	that music is amazing! I'm listening to his show since I started listening to trance, he brough me into trance
2016-10-27 10:06:40	+Silxx	smallprint: so long as it's signed to an armada label, or incredibly generic and fluffy
