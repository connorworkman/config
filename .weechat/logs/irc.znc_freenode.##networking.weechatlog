Looking at the Google Search Console, it says it cannot crawl the site due to a DNS error, however we can all access it via mydomain.com and www.mydomain.com - it confuses my tiny mind.

However, it seems like I cannot scan those ports that dont have running service bind to that port.  so my question is, how can I scan all those ports with or without service bind to them.

2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:20:44] at least in ethernet [05:20:44]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:20:57] rjsalts: About that, the 10G is shared among all on the node, so a SFP module that is limited to 1GbE is fine. [05:20:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:21:49] If I were building a new network for internet connectivity, I would probably go with 10G-EPON. I have no idea why Google Fiber didn't. No legacy cruft. [05:21:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:22:03] This has diagrams explaining: https://www.dslreports.com/forum/r30519466-PON-EPON-or-GPON-or-GEPON [05:22:03]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:22:17] This one is good: https://www.dslreports.com/r0/download/2252302~256f9cd0ef7c9c3cecf2019dd954bc8f/4144_627 [05:22:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:22:54] Then again, you get a 1500 MTU with GPON... [05:22:54]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:27:04] If you're gold plating why not go with active optical network with multiple fibres into each home and having ospf/isis/... layer 3 network in jellyfish topology [05:27:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:27:27] rjsalts: That is expensive. PON is cheaper. :P [05:27:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:27:34] rjsalts: Anyway, I am not building a new last mile network. [05:27:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:27:57] I know, hence the gold plating ;) [05:27:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:29:22] yeah, pissed that it doesn't look likely we'll even get PON here, let alone active optical network [05:29:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:35:50] Hi, I have created centos iptables policy to accept input, output and forward for all ports 1 to 65535 as for testing purpose so that I can scan them to see if they are really open. However, it seems like I cannot scan those ports that dont have running service bind to that port.  so my question is, how can I scan all those ports with or without service bind to them. [05:35:50]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:37:30] rommel092079: you dont [05:37:30]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:37:53] rommel092079: something needs to listen on a port for it to accept connections [05:37:53]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:37:53] zapotah, what do you mean ? [05:37:53]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:37:58] rommel092079: the kernel would send back the icmp message to say that the port wasn't open if there is no listening process [05:37:58]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:38:19] so I really need a service to bind to that port ? [05:38:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:38:45] rjsalts: no, i said all that out of spite [05:38:45]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:38:58] rommel092079: yes, really [05:38:58]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:39:02] rommel092079: or write a custom kernel that does something strange [05:39:02]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:39:09] is there a service that will bind to all those ports? [05:39:09]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:39:28] zapotah: huh? [05:39:28]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:39:32] or can you advice me something where I can scan all those ports? [05:39:32]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:40:56] rommel092079: no, you would have to have a very strange use case for that to even be helpful [05:40:56]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:41:49] rommel092079: whats the point of all this nonsense [05:41:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:41:55] zapotah: what do you mean, you said it out of spite? [05:41:55]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:42:05] rjsalts: highlight mistake [05:42:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:42:12] was meant for rommel092079 [05:42:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:42:15] ah [05:42:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:42:23] fucking phone [05:42:23]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:42:25] rjsalts, I just have to scan all those ports to know which port are accessible behind firewall or something. [05:42:25]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:42:38] difficult AF to type [05:42:38]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:43:35] rommel092079: well, you wont scan udp anyway [05:43:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:44:04] why [05:44:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:44:18] rommel092079: because thats how udp works [05:44:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:44:57] rommel092079: udp doesn't have a "connnection" your udp sender gives destination and port and preys something is there to listen [05:44:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:44:58] alright. I will have to focus on tcp [05:44:58]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:45:10] prays even [05:45:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:45:19] rommel092079: for tcp youd write a script that spawns ie. netcat instances [05:45:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:45:37] rommel092079: dont ask how [05:45:37]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:45:52] rommel092079: prime opportunity to learn scripting here [05:45:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:46:04] netcat? [05:46:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:46:17] rommel092079: it can't tell the difference between packet loss, firewall, wrong destination, etc for udp [05:46:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:46:48] rommel092079: it's a very simple program to set up a tcp connection to/from stdin/stdout [05:46:48]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:46:59] rommel092079: socat also does udp [05:46:59]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:47:29] alright. googling time netcat and socat. [05:47:29]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:47:32] tnx [05:47:32]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	linocisco	[06:59:45] hi all [06:59:45]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	linocisco	[07:00:05] how to check my network security? [07:00:05]

2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:44:36] Hey hey hey, so does anyone presently here know about traffic sniffing and analysis? [09:44:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:44:58] I want to be able to visit linkedin.com at work without my butthole puckering up. [09:44:58]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:46:09] But more importantly, I like to pass commands to my torrentbox so that I have a movie to watch when I get home. [09:46:09]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:46:43] There was a company wide email last week warning against torrenting while at work, and I think it's just coincidental, but it still has me paranoid that I'm leaking packets or something. [09:46:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Tools	[09:47:20] I think that would be more aimed at people torrent on their workstation instead of downloading it at home. [09:47:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:47:53] Tools: yeah, but if I point my work browser at let's say demenoid or piratebay, I don't want that throwing a flag on the filter either. [09:47:53]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:48:14] It's easier for me to just browse on the work pc and then curl or wget the torrent files after I've found what I want. [09:48:14]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:49:10] So the idea is keep the the browser traffic cloaked by passing it through SSH/socks. [09:49:10]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:50:43] I didn't see anything other than data going from my work pc to VPS when I grepped my tcpdump logs. So I guess I'm good? [09:50:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:51:20] But I don't know if those packets contain header information (about the final destination, f.e. demenoid.com). [09:51:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:51:56] Input from knowledgeable lurkers would be greatly appreciated. [09:51:56]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	lithiumpt	[09:52:05] you could have a dns leak [09:52:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:53:28] dns leak would only show the domain name and not the /whatevercomesafter path, right? [09:53:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:54:10] for example, if i visited Dogs.com/barkblocker. The dns would only show a request to dogs.com? [09:54:10]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:56:16] Anyway, I have my browser routing dns through SSH/socks. So I think I should be dns-leak free. [09:56:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	rabbitear	[09:57:03] Indigoblue: wireshark? [09:57:03]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:57:38] rabbitear: wireshark looked good too, but I'm still a newb so I doubt it was a thorough sweep. [09:57:38]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:58:11] All I looked for were packets on TCP/UDP ports 53. [09:58:11]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:59:06] Occasionally javascript will bypass the socks proxy, but that's usually just clever adverts [09:59:06]

2016-10-18 02:00:30	Indigoblue	I'm wondering if my employer will be able to see web-traffic routed through a SSH/socks5 proxy w/remote dns.
2016-10-18 02:00:55	Indigoblue	Company currently uses BYOD policy.
2016-10-18 02:00:55	inire	is the ssh/socks5 proxy owned by your employer?
2016-10-18 02:01:08	Indigoblue	No, it is not. It is a personal vps
2016-10-18 02:01:31	inire	ok, so, you make an ssh connection through the employer network to the ssh server on vps
2016-10-18 02:01:32	GeekNerd_phone	Indigoblue: before attempting to help with this, I'd say you maybe want to read your AUP (acceptable use policy) and try not to be a dick.
2016-10-18 02:01:56	inire	ssh is encrypted, so they won't see any of that traffic
2016-10-18 02:02:16	inire	as long as ALL your traffic is tunneled down that connection, you won't have "issues"
2016-10-18 02:02:25	inire	but, see what GeekNerd is saying
2016-10-18 02:02:28	GeekNerd_phone	they WILL know that encrypted traffic is there, and where its destination is (the IP address of your VPS)
2016-10-18 02:02:37	GeekNerd_phone	if they are monitoring you
2016-10-18 02:02:37		[02:02]
2016-10-18 02:02:47	Indigoblue	GeekNerd_phone: AFAIK our AUP does not say anything about VPS or private VPN.
2016-10-18 02:03:04	Indigoblue	Yeah, I'm not concerned about them seeing encrypted traffic, as long as the bandwidth is low.
2016-10-18 02:03:20	GeekNerd_phone	and unless you are in a communist dictatorship, where employers would turn you in for free speech, I see no reason to use their network for things you must hide from them

2016-10-18 03:36:13	drac_boy	I suspect the wire is because the cable itself doesn't have any ground pins from either ends
2016-10-18 03:36:20	UncleDrax	but protected patch panels for example supposedly can shunt surges to ground and such. you might kill your panel, but in theory it's cheaper than replacing the equipment that was attached to it.
2016-10-18 03:36:24	UncleDrax	also you need good groudning ofc

2016-10-18 03:58:32	djph	not really no
2016-10-18 03:58:47	Haris	for e.g., if ISP gives me a link with 1 Gbps interface speed, but 10 or 30 Mbps CIR bw, would it help latency if this is the case

2016-10-18 03:59:27	Gollee	sure, the traffic is sent at 10x the speed at 1gig then at 100mbit, but the difference is probably negligible in the big picture
2016-10-18 03:59:47	UncleDrax	it would improve the latency on that particular physical link between you and your ISPs equipment. but you're talking like a couple nanoseconds at best. which is irrelevent for most uses

2016-10-18 05:46:51	@daemonkeeper	Sure one only takes 5V, but you need a transformer from your normal voltage and that is not that efficient.

2016-10-18 07:27:49	jxer	would u want your controller inthe cloud
2016-10-18 07:27:52	Milotop	well squeeb, we've trained ourselves with samsung and mikrotik, so we're probably not gonna consider ubnt
2016-10-18 07:28:03	Milotop	also jxer makes a valid point tbh
2016-10-18 07:28:03	jxer	thus requring a solid internet connection just to manage your network
2016-10-18 07:28:06	jxer	i think thats nuts
2016-10-18 07:28:10	squeeb	jxer: ask meraki ?
2016-10-18 07:28:20	jxer	i think cloud has its place
2016-10-18 07:28:24	jxer	this is not one of them
2016-10-18 07:28:25	squeeb	actually no, if the controller goes offline, the APs keep running
2016-10-18 07:28:29	jxer	yet
2016-10-18 07:28:32	jxer	u can't manage it
2016-10-18 07:28:34	jxer	or make changes
2016-10-18 07:28:40	squeeb	jxer: Meraki are doing this now
2016-10-18 07:28:42	jxer	keep the controller onsite
2016-10-18 07:28:44	squeeb	and they're lolrich
2016-10-18 07:28:50	jxer	yea
2016-10-18 07:28:59	jxer	cus the "cloud" is the friggin answer to everything
2016-10-18 07:29:04	Milotop	everyone who sells DUH CLOUD is lolrich because it's the most recent buzzword in IT
2016-10-18 07:29:10	Milotop	everyone throws down cash if they even hear it
2016-10-18 07:29:12	squeeb	Yea it's diagonally scalable in the cloud
2016-10-18 07:29:14	jxer	pretty much
2016-10-18 07:29:16	jxer	scales
2016-10-18 07:29:20	jxer	its amazing
2016-10-18 07:29:31	djph	there can be arguments made for both a local (on-site) and "cloud" (i.e. "in your office a mile away") installations of the controller
2016-10-18 07:29:32	jxer	it will even suck your dick if you pay for the platinum package

2016-10-18 12:13:19	Dagger	you can arrange for v6 addresses to be about 64 bits (with the remaining bits set to zero), which is pretty similar to the two 32-bit addresses you end up with on NATed v4

I need to create a 2 x /24 subnets for that 4G device, the 4g usb device will be mounted to a virtualbox VM pfsense that will route all traffic to a VPN. The thing I don't know, is how and is it possible to make the 2 subnets with the 4g usb in the pfsense. I have the same setup now (2 x /24 subnets and 5 vms connecting to the pfsense but through

2016-10-18 16:08:38	Network2501	some sort of purchased thing
2016-10-18 16:09:02	Network2501	the end point just needs to accepted and forward on incoming connection requests
2016-10-18 16:09:38	Network2501	my guess is though it's just used for anon so it won't permit inbound connection attempts

2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[08:57:41] archer121: it writes all traffic between HOST-A and HOST-B and icmp packets to/from HOST-A. [08:57:41]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121	[08:58:11] evilman_work: You are so helpfull! [08:58:11]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[08:59:12] archer121: run the tcpdump and check again. then stop tcpdump with CTRL+C, and then open the dump in the wireshark. [08:59:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121	[08:59:45] evilman_work: okey. [08:59:45]

2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:01:48] archer121: when it has been done, let's analyse it together. [09:01:48]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121	[09:09:38] evilman_work: I have the dump file. At this point, I would like to tell why I am doing this because I don't want it to be a xy problem. Someone has written a python script to backup some files to google drive. When they are running the problem, they are getting this issue: https://paste.ubuntu.com/23347579/ So I thought of helping him debug the issue. [09:09:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121	[09:10:01] evilman_work: running the program* [09:10:01]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121	[09:11:07] evilman_work: So the actual HOST-B in question is not centineltest.cardinalcommerce.com but some google server. Will that be an issue? [09:11:07]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:12:12] archer121: it doesn't matter. there are tons things those cause the same issue.  open the dump in the wireshark. [09:12:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:13:36] archer121: then in wireshark: Statistics -> Conversation List -> TCP [09:13:36]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	bytefire	[09:13:45] do ldap and nfs perform same function? [09:13:45]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:15:38] bytecat: nope. start from wiki-articles about these things. [09:15:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121	[09:17:04] evilman_work: TCP Conversions = 1. I get a line. [09:17:04]

2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:21:58] archer121: show the screenshot, please. [09:21:58]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121	[09:22:25] evilman_work: After closing the conversations window, right? [09:22:25]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:22:33] archer121: yep. [09:22:33]

2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:25:30] archer121: as can you see, the server side shutdowns the connection after receiving of client hello message. [09:25:30]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121	[09:27:34] evilman_work: Did you infer that from the TCP Flags> [09:27:34]

2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:28:15] archer121: yep, from tcp flags and sequence numbers. [09:28:15]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	zapotah	[09:29:06] whatever fails, fails with the ssl handshake there [09:29:06]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	zapotah	[09:30:09] perhaps the script tries to do an ssl3.0 negotiation and google has disabled that [09:30:09]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:30:12] archer121: seems like the server side doesn't like the client hello message. [09:30:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:30:46] archer121: you can check the detail from client hello message. [09:30:46]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:30:54] **the details [09:30:54]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121	[09:31:06] evilman_work: Let me check. [09:31:06]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121_	[09:34:21] evilman_work: I had to reconnect to a different WiFi and hence may have lost anything you have said after: <evilman_work> **the details [09:34:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121_	[09:34:52] evilman_work: Maybe the server doesnot support tls1? [09:34:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121_	[09:36:57] evilman_work: Another thing that I noticed is that there is a field called GMT Unix Time: and it has year 2076 [09:36:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121_	[09:37:38] evilman_work: But the system time is correct [09:37:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:39:21] archer121_: hm.. it's very strange. [09:39:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121_	[09:42:07] evilman_work: And another point is that this issue is happening only from this machine. Other machines in the subnet is using tls fine. [09:42:07]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:43:49] archer121_: are you getting this issue with all tls connections or only when you are connecting to several hosts? [09:43:49]

2016-10-18 23:55:21	Zajt	[09:45:45] On this one: https://puu.sh/rO8iV/b0aa1905b8.png can I say that in the TCP case if you use retransmissions,the throughput will be higher than without retransmissions? [09:45:45]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:45:52] archer121_: yep. try to connect to other servers. [09:45:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121_	[09:47:21] evilman_work: google.com is not working. Also I noticed that it takes some time for openssl command to finish. It takes a couple of seconds after printing "CONNECTED(00000003)" [09:47:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	zapotah	[09:48:08] Zajt: instead of expecting ##networking to give you answers to your homework, i suggest reading up on the concepts and understanding what the impact of the various forms of communication are [09:48:08]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	zapotah	[09:48:29] Zajt: dont have time and got tests coming up and hoping to braindump stuff? too bad. [09:48:29]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Zajt	[09:48:43] I read at teh same time zapotah but ask here if my answers seem to be correct because we don't have any answers [09:48:43]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:49:30] archer121_: use -msg and -state options in the openssl command. [09:49:30]

2016-10-19 00:08:39	+catphish_	seems like the problem is on the linux end, since its receiving the ESP packets but not decrypting them (or not feeding them back into the gre tunnel)
2016-10-19 00:09:18	evilman_work	catphish_: so you can use the ip xfrm monitor to get the debug info in realtime.

2016-10-19 00:12:25	archer121_	evilman_work: you mean connect to a server which uses ssl, and get the dump from server side?

2016-10-19 00:41:21	+catphish_	[10:07:19] traffic works perfectly one way, i see encrypted packets going back the other way, but they don't appear decrypted on the fre ijnterface [10:07:19]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	+catphish_	[10:07:24] *gre interface [10:07:24]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	evilman_work	[10:07:36] catphish_: what kind of hardware do you use on the ends? [10:07:36]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	+catphish_	[10:07:59] one end is an edgerouter pro, the other end is linux (libreswan) [10:07:59]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	+catphish_	[10:08:39] seems like the problem is on the linux end, since its receiving the ESP packets but not decrypting them (or not feeding them back into the gre tunnel) [10:08:39]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	evilman_work	[10:09:18] catphish_: so you can use the ip xfrm monitor to get the debug info in realtime. [10:09:18]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	+catphish_	[10:09:53] that sounds like what i need [10:09:53]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	evilman_work	[10:11:11] archer121_: seems like correct client hello. have you write the dump from client end? can you write the dump from server end? [10:11:11]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	zamba	[10:11:45] how safe is it to start increasing mtu size on my local network? [10:11:45]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	+catphish_	[10:12:18] zamba: if all devices and the switch support it and are configured the same (switch can be higher), then its ok [10:12:18]

2016-10-19 00:41:21	archer121_	[10:12:25] evilman_work: you mean connect to a server which uses ssl, and get the dump from server side? [10:12:25]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	evilman_work	[10:12:32] archer121_: yep. [10:12:32]

2016-10-19 00:41:21	+catphish_	[10:13:08] evilman_work: weirdly "ip xfrm state list" shows the tunnel twice [10:13:08]

2016-10-19 04:03:17	TheGoodDoc	Alright, so this might be a silly question (There is a reason for me asking this). We recently had a change in ISP, and it is to be a GB line up and down, well they guys was here, installed it, and the speeds was subpar, talking 300 down 800 up. So we have been dealing with them for a while now. They are trying to say it might be a DNS issue, I understand DNS could cause latency, but is there any way it could effect bandwit
2016-10-19 04:04:33	UncleDrax	for Gig, I have to bring up that not all test points (esp if it's out in public Internet land) are equal. How are you testing this? something like iPerf between 2 on-net end-points?
2016-10-19 04:05:10	UncleDrax	also older or poor-quality NICs can't do true Gig line-rate even. probably only an issue on laptops or netbooks these days though.

The hardware is what they provided, and according to them, they have done up to 4gb connection installs.

2016-10-19 04:48:16	+catphish_	the book is very old i would suggest
2016-10-19 04:48:37	+catphish_	 /30 can be necessary for hardware thats older than me
2016-10-19 04:48:40	plus65Naomi	I am studying CCNA
2016-10-19 04:48:51	+catphish_	 /31 is often used when the 2 ends have adjacent IPs
2016-10-19 04:49:01	UncleDrax	 /30 is the default that would have the most compliance. /31s can be used for newer kit
2016-10-19 04:49:15	UncleDrax	for the purposes of a test, say /30
2016-10-19 04:49:27	+catphish_	then again, who uses a point to point serial link in 2016?

2016-10-19 08:51:27	OMGDoggeh	Hello eahmedshendy. Do you want to be DR?
2016-10-19 08:51:27	eahmedshendy	Here is the situation, when you have a simple network infrastructure, one DSL router for internet and local network, and a local server behind this DSL router. This local server hosts a website. Internet can access application on this local server through a static IP address.
2016-10-19 08:51:27	eahmedshendy	Here is the problem, when local server is connected to the network of the local employee (which means has access to the router and internet), internet bandwidth is getting too low, even google can�t be opened easily. If we disconnected this server from the network, internet connection is getting back to normal, and everyone feels fine against it.

2016-10-19 08:51:28	eahmedshendy	So how do you think as a procedure to identify the problem. After many things (with my little knowledge), I guess the server may be hacked.
2016-10-19 08:51:30	sveinse	notabyte: weell. it depends. I'm replacing a Cisco RV320. Bigger crap that that is hard to find
2016-10-19 08:51:31	eahmedshendy	The admin of the server (non-IT guy) told me that the server previously can be accessed through static IP address from internet, and locally, but from the localhost itself only you can �ping 8.8.8.8� but not �ping www.google.com�, some friend just edited resolv.conf file with a DNS, and now the server can access internet. After this change in resolv.conf, the problem of internet bandwidth is started.

2016-10-19 10:37:49	webbly	ryao: because I thought so?

2016-10-19 10:46:15	OMGDoggeh	of it. Hairpinning is where a machine on the LAN is able to access another machine on the LAN via the external IP address of the LAN/router (with port forwarding set up on the router to direct requests to the appropriate machine on the LAN).

2016-10-19 11:37:58	thurstylark	We have a product that uses a Debian Jessie box as the gateway, DHCP, and DNS server. This is usually connected directly to an Engenius ENS500EXT ap. Every client on this network connects through this ap. We wanted to start connecting some of these clients hardwired, so we put an unmanaged switch between the jessie box and the AP. This stops traffic through that ap until we configure the ap to remove the

2016-10-19 16:12:06	cipher6	fair enough, they're putting me through WGU where the finals ARE the certs,
2016-10-19 16:12:21	cipher6	so as long as they're footing 100% of the bill, I'm going to collect as many certs as possible,
2016-10-19 16:12:26	B0g4r7	jge, to do a throughput test, you'd have to move a lot of data through it.  You'd need the cooperation of another host on the other side of the link to send and receive that data.
2016-10-19 16:12:50	B0g4r7	Like speedtest.net, to give a simple example.
2016-10-19 16:12:57	jge	B0g4r7: ohh

2016-10-19 16:48:41	B0g4r7	Of course it's linux under the hood, but they try not to let it show.

2016-10-19 20:40:03	sanyiamacs	[06:37:58] how would you expect that to work [06:37:58]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	Celmor	[06:38:20] implementation wise or writing the rule? [06:38:20]

2016-10-19 20:40:07	Celmor	so the shortest method to specify a multitude of rules to match for multiple interfaces would be to define rules for each of these interface to forward them to a shared chain?

But if using 10.0.0.2 I can not ping 10.0.0.1. Tried using virio-net and i added 2 vlan tags in my route for each subnet. Bit ignorant in this area but my end goal is to have a separate lan on my network to which I can assign ips to VM's in a virtualbox thats on bridged networking.

2016-10-20 05:21:23	radialneon	Hello, I ran some tests on my SAMBA file server and found that it performs rather well when the computers that read/write to it are connected to the router via cable but it is very slow (1.5MB/s max) when doing so via wi-fi. Help? :)
2016-10-20 05:22:00	radialneon	I'm suspecting this might be a network problem. I use a DI-524 router to connect the devices. The file server is connected via cable to the router.

2016-10-20 06:47:06	ryao	The general thinking is that they detect TLS inside tunnels and drop it because it might be an attempt to view a banned website. After all, the website could be loaded outside the VPN if it wasn't banned.

2016-10-20 07:57:00	radialneon	Hello, I have two wifi printers connected to my router. When I tell them to print anything, they don't seem to be receiving the request
2016-10-20 07:57:37	squib	gosh that's awful.
2016-10-20 07:57:50	radialneon	I believe wireless isolation setting in router might be preventing them from communicating with the computer. It works when I ask them to print via USB.
2016-10-20 07:58:04	squib	your printing source is also on wifi?
2016-10-20 07:58:24	radialneon	I tried both print sources in wifi and in cable
2016-10-20 07:58:24	squib	are you able to ping the IP address assigned to the printer?
2016-10-20 07:58:44	squib	radialneon, client isolation should only be preventing communication between radios

2016-10-20 09:17:12	zamabe	comcastuser12: anyway, the mfg of the modem makes available the firmware. The ISP grabs the firmware for testing (or not) and then deploys it on their network.

2016-10-20 10:56:52	squib	subscribe is for presence functions
2016-10-20 10:56:56	Apachez	the others can be dropped
2016-10-20 10:57:02	squib	if you want to see presence you need to enable subscribe messages
2016-10-20 10:57:02	Apachez	like TRACE, PUT, DELETE and shit like that
2016-10-20 10:57:11	squib	like for busy/away statuses
2016-10-20 10:57:31	Apachez	but with sip I have thse options: register, invite, ack, bye, cancel, options, subscribe, notify, prack and refer

2016-10-20 10:57:47	Apachez	register is obvious, to phone home and tell your server "hi, Im here"
2016-10-20 10:57:52	Apachez	invite is when you call somebody
2016-10-20 10:57:56	Apachez	ack is to accept the call
2016-10-20 10:58:01	squib	Apachez, those pretty much sum up the basics of what you should know.  just google each of those separately
2016-10-20 10:58:01	Apachez	bye is to flip the call off
2016-10-20 10:58:10	Apachez	cancel is eh... different from bye?
2016-10-20 10:58:19	squib	cancel is hangup during call progress

2016-10-20 15:34:22	ryao	Whiskey`: By the way, is there any thing you can imagine that would stop municipalities from reviving the ILEC/CLEC model with EPON using VLANs and PPPoE to allow customers' traffic to be handed off to CLECs that would do internet and possibly also VoIP and IPTV? EPON in China uses PPPoE and the ISP provides IPTV and VoIP over it.

2016-10-20 15:36:46	ryao	Whiskey`: Well, I had dismissed the idea of ILEC/CLEC for Fiber because I didn't see a way of multiplexing multiple providers until now and the legacy cruft in GPON doesn't seem well suited to it.
2016-10-20 15:37:01	ryao	Whiskey`: Cool. Thanks.

2016-10-20 17:21:01	lance77	So, I've run into a really strange issue with a 3750x. If a port gets shutdown, it willnever come back up. And if disconnecting the fiber from an active connection, it will continue to show up up and keep trying to push traffic out the interface. Migration to a replacement is in progress, just curious if anyone has ever seen that behavior before?

2016-10-20 21:46:52	bezaban	private key can be used for authentication, but in addition to private/public x509 certificates and associated keys have so-called 'key usage' fields that define acceptable and possible use of keysets

2016-10-20 21:48:29	grawity	which might be why SSH switched from encrypt/decrypt in v1 to sign/verify in v2
2016-10-20 21:48:33	grawity	asawa: usually, yes
2016-10-20 21:48:43	grawity	asawa: I think ECDH might be more common nowadays

2016-10-20 22:26:22	asawa	kapjack, many graduates from coding schools mainly know python. Anything low level like C is beyond them
2016-10-20 22:26:47	_krator44	and just not aware get into the theory behind it
2016-10-20 22:26:54	_krator44	ever^
2016-10-20 22:27:51	_krator44	but that just an example
2016-10-20 22:28:10	_krator44	mathematicians will also not be aware of turing machine theory
2016-10-20 22:28:19	_krator44	computation complexity etc.

2016-10-20 22:28:38	_krator44	it's just a substantially different set of topics
2016-10-20 22:28:52	asawa	most important question. Who earns more? mathematicians or computer scientists? The median ones
2016-10-20 22:29:22	kapjack	Depends on the subject
2016-10-20 22:29:25	asawa	My bet is on the computer scientists. Their knowledge is more practical
2016-10-20 22:29:49	asawa	irony is that mathematicians are smarter. I know that because I cannot understand them even after trying hard

2016-10-20 22:46:38	PetyrBaelish	Or does it get set automatically now that I configured it in the router?
2016-10-20 22:46:38	Packet_Surf	something that you think other wifi devices arent using
2016-10-20 22:46:51	Packet_Surf	theres a default

2016-10-20 22:47:14	grawity	you could say the 40 MHz option makes it use two channels at once

2016-10-21 05:21:38	Humorousone_	physically?
2016-10-21 05:21:41	niab	yep
2016-10-21 05:21:47	niab	without cutting them
2016-10-21 05:21:52	Humorousone_	hmm
2016-10-21 05:21:56	Humorousone_	Diameter?
2016-10-21 05:22:02	niab	that was my first guess
2016-10-21 05:22:06	Humorousone_	I mean fibre usually has huge cladding and stuff
2016-10-21 05:22:06	Windy	they do look different...
2016-10-21 05:22:06	niab	should be much thinner than copper i guess
2016-10-21 05:22:11	Sanyiamacska	yea

2016-10-21 05:22:19	niab	cool
2016-10-21 05:22:35	Humorousone_	I mean you could also try doing a traceroute and seeing how pings look between each node on your network
2016-10-21 05:22:48	Humorousone_	depends how long the fibre is really

2016-10-21 05:24:15	niab	havent checked myself yet to be honest but i'm trying to get a decent line for the office and some ISPs claim only copper cable coming into the building but one colleague said he once went down to the basement and saw fibre optic cables
2016-10-21 05:24:33	niab	cool
2016-10-21 05:24:35	niab	thanks
2016-10-21 05:24:40	raastine	so guys, about DHCP snooping
2016-10-21 05:24:44	UncleDrax	niab: it's possible it's not the ISP's fiber, or they don't have any docco on it.
2016-10-21 05:24:52	Sanyiamacska	i think your mate just tried to talk big
2016-10-21 05:24:53	raastine	can it be used to allow only one DHCP server on the network?

2016-10-21 05:25:08	niab	yep i'm also not convinced cos why would ISP say otherwise
2016-10-21 05:25:08	drathir	niab: fibre could be used for isp infra...
2016-10-21 05:25:09	Humorousone_	is it that all hidden

2016-10-21 05:26:04	Sanyiamacska	well, they might be retards
2016-10-21 05:26:06	niab	thanks at least now i have some facts to argue with

2016-10-21 05:26:42	raastine	wonder if should enable it
2016-10-21 05:26:49	raastine	does it have negative effets?
2016-10-21 05:26:51	raastine	effects*
2016-10-21 05:26:52	Sanyiamacska	but still, i don't think that they would state that there is no fiber there, when they do know that it is there
2016-10-21 05:26:54	Humorousone_	Related question: Is there a way of setting up an adhoc network (hotspot) without getting kicked off through an automated system, on a university network?
2016-10-21 05:27:11	Humorousone_	I've got permission from the IT guys, but they can't make exceptions through their software
2016-10-21 05:27:15	UncleDrax	raastine: like all features, misconfiguration could cause issues for the devices on the other end. sure. but DHCPSnooping is pretty simple and safe in most cases.
2016-10-21 05:27:17	Sanyiamacska	i like working with bt, at least they know their englosh
2016-10-21 05:27:22	niab	they state on their website that 100mbit leased line is available so that might be a good reason having a fibre optic cable here
2016-10-21 05:27:33	drathir	niab: Sanyiamacska no fiber could mean no fiber for end customer...
2016-10-21 05:27:43	UncleDrax	ya or all the fiber is in use.

2016-10-21 05:29:12	drathir	also maybe not used per customer fiber termination so far... cost put fiber to every customer vs exist vdsl etc they not yet modernize infra...
2016-10-21 05:29:14	UncleDrax	raastine: if you have the extra switches, with all feature testing, setup a bench or lab.. test the config.. verify it functions as you expect. then deploy per your/your-orgs deployment policy

2016-10-21 09:48:28	javi404	why would you need two?
2016-10-21 09:48:40	Exagone313	two days ago, my ISP fucked up with false terrorist list and blocked some websites such as google and wikipedia. today, many sites are unreachable because of the dyn ddos and it looks likes it cached non accessible addresses. There are a few DNS servers in my country ran by associations about privacy or cooperative internet access I could use. Or have a local recursive DNS server.
2016-10-21 09:49:05	thuryn	Janko, you'd have one DNS service running that is authoritative for certain zones, and then handles anything recursively.
2016-10-21 09:49:12	thuryn	like javi404 says
2016-10-21 09:49:15	Janko	because I already have an authoritative server set up, which doesn't support recursion

2016-10-21 09:50:10	eas	sooner or later you hit dns expirations

2016-10-22 07:32:11	okuu	Hello. I have a very noob question: During the last 3 weeks, my Internet connection has been very slow, but only for web traffic (HTTP). For torrents, it's exactly as fast as advertised by my ISP. I'm using a program called nethogs to check what processes are using the network, and, in addition to the ones I expected (Emacs, transmission-daemon, web browsers), I find some strange no-name processes whose only description is
2016-10-22 07:32:11	okuu	“192.168.0.4:<some-port>-<some-public-IP>:<some-port>”. What's worse is that these no-name processes are running as root. What might this be?

There is a panel that has an unmanaged netgear switch and cable modem (not much room for everything else) that routes to every port. Cable modem is plugged to coax, modem goes to port 1 on the netgear switch, and the other 9 rooms are plugged into the netgear switch.

2016-10-22 09:12:18	random_numbers	I'll keep that in mind for when I try to setup ipv6 here.
2016-10-22 09:12:27	azonenberg	its fine if you use static IPs, like on a router
2016-10-22 09:12:33	azonenberg	or if you only connect a box to one ipv6 subnet at a time
2016-10-22 09:12:44	azonenberg	Or if you dont care which subnet you route to the internet from
2016-10-22 09:12:56	azonenberg	actually its not the DMZ thats the issue
2016-10-22 09:12:58	azonenberg	that can get to the internet
2016-10-22 09:13:06	azonenberg	its the lab subnet for prototype hardware that we dont want talking out
2016-10-22 09:13:57	random_numbers	Makes sense.

2016-10-22 14:35:46	B0g4r7	The two fiber media converters on the right side of the catalyst are GBIC modules.

2016-10-22 14:46:38	B0g4r7	Maybe the bottom one has a copper module in one of the holes, connected to a copper port on the catalyst.

2016-10-22 14:47:18	wallbroken	Casa utente
2016-10-22 14:47:18	wallbroken	Lato utente (ovvero, casa nostra) possiamo avere svariate tipologie di collegamento voce/dati.
2016-10-22 14:47:18	wallbroken	La più comune è quella sul caro vecchio doppino telefonico di rame.
2016-10-22 14:47:18	wallbroken	In questo caso, in casa si avrà un filtro adso/fonia che splitta e pulisce le frequenze nel tratto filtro -> 2 apparecchi (modem/telefono). Lungo il doppino viaggiano assieme (in quando comunque sfruttano frequenze vicine, ma diverse) per poi essere riseparate in sala telecom/sala olo, come vedremo più avanti.
2016-10-22 14:47:18	wallbroken	Già qui ci sarebbe il primo discorso di possibili malfunzionamenti dovuto al famoso "ultimo miglio". Tutta la tratta stradale per esempio non è esente da possibili guasti : cavi tranciati per sbaglio in strada da ruspe di lavori, atti vandalici sugli armadi stradali (che raccolgono tutti i doppini degli appartamenti/condomini di zona per affasciarli in un unico collegamento verso la
2016-10-22 14:47:18	wallbroken	centrale telecom), umidità e fili rovinati nelle stesse, etc.
2016-10-22 14:47:18	wallbroken	Abbiamo poi per esempio i collegamenti diretti in fibra (vedi al momento fastweb ma entro breve anche altri operatori come wind) che tramite un apparato chiamato catalyst posto nel condominio, raccoglie tutte le coppie di fibre ottiche degli utenti per farle viaggiare assieme lungo l'apparato in centrale.
2016-10-22 14:47:19	wallbroken	Quando è la fibra a raggiungere direttamente l'utente fino a casa, parliamo di FTTh (Fiber to the Home)
2016-10-22 14:47:19	wallbroken	La nomenclatura generica che invece include altre modalità di utilizzo della fibra ma non completamente fino a casa cliente, è detta FTTx.
2016-10-22 14:47:20	wallbroken	In quest'ultimo caso, questa sarà la situazione lato cliente:
2016-10-22 14:47:20	wallbroken	Nel caso del collegamento totale in fibra, viene tolto completamente il vecchio doppino in rame, e al suo posto sfruttandone il suo tubo, viene posizionata la nuova fibra.
2016-10-22 14:47:21	wallbroken	La fibra usata per arrivare fino a casa utente.. che arriva allo switch-hub condominiale

2016-10-22 15:08:13	kerframil	Celmor: every rule? no, not necessarily. you could write two rules that jump to a custom chain, at which juncture, the fact that the packet passed in via br0 or eth0 is established.
2016-10-22 15:08:16	Celmor	can an interface even have a comma in its name?
2016-10-22 15:10:24	Celmor	kerframil, well, I split first UDP and TCP packets into their custom chains, and it gets a lot less overseeable if some of them just point out somewhere else

2016-10-22 15:12:12	Celmor	eth1 is internet facing, rest internal
2016-10-22 15:12:23	kerframil	Celmor: ! -i eth1 will work for you then (that will cover lo also, but shouldn't be a concern)

2016-10-22 15:13:41	kerframil	yes. if you add an interface, you'll have to compose the ruleset in a different way.
2016-10-22 15:14:13	Celmor	so this should work, right? '-A UDP ! -i eth1 -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT'

2016-10-22 18:11:51	rantic	If PC.8 on LAN1 wants to talk to PC.19 on LAN2. Is it correct to say that PC.8 creates a packet with the logical address of PC.19 on LAN2 and encapsulates this in an ethernet frame destined for the default gateway (router). The router then checks a record of networks, looks for a match and creates a new ethernet frame with the MAC Address of PC.19 and sends it to LAN2's switch?

Too much of the signal can overamplify it, making it harder to transfer. iw wlan0/wlx scan should show your signal strength greater than -48dB, which is good. Your channel and frequency also matter as well, as well as how high up it is.

2016-10-23 06:35:43	schlogg	If you were to create a backend server for an app would you consider having two backends? One that you will send links to the user to confirm accounts etc and then the real backend which the other backend will talk to and the phone will also talk to. I realize this is security by obfuscation and pointless against a real hacker but I don't like sending out the backend address to anyone
2016-10-23 06:35:44	schlogg	since it would make it easy to just DOS/DDOS it for any mischievious person. Thus if anyone DDOS the signup backend then dont disturb players talking to the real backend.

2016-10-23 15:13:11	BenderRodriguez	they show up as untagged packets

2016-10-23 15:13:43	BenderRodriguez	how do I o about doing this?

2016-10-23 17:49:46	tpanarch1st	pppingme, i guess, the one thing that is still confusing, is making sure the electricity plug is appropriate
2016-10-23 17:50:25	@pppingme	if it powers up and smoke doesn't come out, you probably got the electric side of things right
2016-10-23 17:50:47	tpanarch1st	pppingme, as soon as i pick the unit up, the lights drop before coming back on
2016-10-23 17:50:51	tpanarch1st	i suspect there may be an issue there
2016-10-23 17:51:01	@pppingme	probably a loose power connection
2016-10-23 17:51:17	tpanarch1st	ahh maybe that's the issue
2016-10-23 17:51:26	tpanarch1st	i notice a screw is missing in the front panel
2016-10-23 17:51:32	tpanarch1st	and i haven't done that
2016-10-23 17:51:35	tpanarch1st	some people suck,
2016-10-23 17:52:23	tpanarch1st	they deliberately sabotaged my belongings

2016-10-23 17:56:19	nightrider97	good day. I created an openvpn server in our office. the openvpn configuration only employs keys and certs, cipher blowfish and sha1 auth with 128 size key. no compression.  my original speed without vpn is 9 Mbps but when I tested it with vpn, even just inside the office, the traffic drops to 3 Mbps.  im using tcp.  i need it on tcpc.

2016-10-23 22:02:55	SlimmyJimmy	sounds like a decent solution also but I think the ftp client/server would be just a bit easier

Take your subnetmask 255.255.0.0 and expand it by 4 bits. now you go from first ip to last ip of this subnets and write them down, repeat as needed. Now you have your original /16 split in multiple smaller /20's

2016-10-24 00:27:59	rjsalts	sanmi, If we're talking Class based routing then no. They're always /24 in Class C
2016-10-24 00:28:00	djph	sanmi: no, because we're not using classful networking anymore.  Even when we were using classful networking, we couldn't because "class C" defined a /24 netmask (255.255.255.0)

2016-10-24 03:53:53	UncleDrax	fiber in the home seems like a PITA tbh (unless low-bend radius gets cheaper and fiber-NICs are more common in the end-user desktop market). cat5e is reasonable for most home-users that don't foresee ever going past 1GbE. Cat6 is more ideal, but if it's that much more expensive, you can do without.

We are now receiving an additional /27 from them in a different subnet. Is it possible to route those new IPs out the original interface without assigning a new interface to the router to house them?

2016-10-24 07:48:27	FrostCyborg	My biggest hang up is that I want to migrate our environment from RoaS to a proper L3 switched environment, but I have no way of testing it as we have no "spare" equipment to work on/play around with.
2016-10-24 07:49:01	UncleDrax	are containers considered 'secure' now? (I never followed containerization, but last I heard they weren't great for actual isolation or something)
2016-10-24 07:49:38	FrostCyborg	I had the CIO tell my manager that it was pointless to get me a Fortigate 60E that I could run 3 separate VDOMs on so that I could mirror our environment and test changes to policy and infrastructure before implementing them into production (because I don't make changes THAT often) *facepalm*

2016-10-24 10:48:15	prsn	hi! we're using redis on a fairly performance critical path. an nginx server calls out to it once per request. the call itself has several arguments, which are currently like 80 bytes. this call goes over the network to redis, which passes the args to a lua script it has loaded and then makes a decision and returns it.
2016-10-24 10:48:20	prsn	my boss thinks that adding an additional 32 byte string to those arguments is unacceptably bad compared to hardcoding the string in the lua script (which sucks for other reasons), because "if we get 50k requests in a second, that's 1.6GB of additional network traffic in that second"
2016-10-24 10:48:27	prsn	my intuition is that this is not a concern. the traffic is from an EC2 instance to an ElastiCache instance, and I think that because of how packets work, and how small the request already is, those 32 extra bytes are very unlikely to incur significant processing cost in the network stack at either end.
2016-10-24 10:48:32	prsn	am i totally wrong?

2016-10-24 17:01:46	schone	i have two linux computers on a local network and each of them has a bridge set up on a subnet of what the eth0 IP is… Computer A sends arp requests when trying to ping an IP on a device on the bridge of computer B.  Computer B receives the ARP request on eth0 but doesn’t transfer it to cbr0 on itself… why is that? what do I need to do for that bridge to respond

2016-10-24 22:59:38	Atro	[07:25:46] zapotah: i got off easy, a cluster got fucked via power but the flash got a lil shake, it wasnt fried, detached cluster, upgraded, remade cluster, everything work [07:25:46]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	vrturbo	[07:27:51] bgp question, routerA can't hold more than 60,000 routes but only accepts default route from DC, RouterB connects to another peer with around 300K routes but can take a full table if need be, will router B send all the 300K ebgp routes to Router A ?, Can I filter iBGP from routerB to not send too many routes to routerA ?  Only these to routers will live in the AS [07:27:51]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	vrturbo	[07:29:07] RouterA is a stacked L3 switch, RouterB is a single router, hence me wanting to keep the default route on routerA [07:29:07]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	evilman_work	[07:33:08] vrturbo: you can accept only default routes from uplinks. also set higher local-pref value to default route from uplink on router A to keep it selected. [07:33:08]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	vrturbo	[07:35:50] I'm just worried the 300K of ebgp routers will get to our stacked internet switches, Currently HP5900 10g switches [07:35:50]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	vrturbo	[07:36:09] which have a max limit on routes etc [07:36:09]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	evilman_work	[07:36:34] vrturbo: don't accept routes from uplinks, except default. [07:36:34]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	evilman_work	[07:38:09] vrturbo: other way is limiting of accepted route prefix length (upto /16 for example) - it should reduce the route number. [07:38:09]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	vrturbo	[07:38:43] yes, but will routerA and routerB share routes over ibgp as they will be in the same AS [07:38:43]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	vrturbo	[07:38:44] ? [07:38:44]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	evilman_work	[07:38:58] vrturbo: yep. [07:38:58]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	vrturbo	[07:39:48] which could crash my 5900 switches hmm [07:39:48]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	evilman_work	[07:40:04] vrturbo: so accept only default is prefered way. [07:40:04]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	evilman_work	[07:41:10] but better way is avoid usage of l3-switches as border gateways with multiple uplinks. [07:41:10]

2016-10-24 22:59:38	evilman_work	[07:48:48] nope. it's impossible. [07:48:48]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	evilman_work	[07:49:18] it cannot get these thumbnails from nowhere. [07:49:18]

2016-10-25 00:23:42	+catphish	switches are expensive

2016-10-25 00:24:07	ryao	If it wasn't more conomical to go with 10G versus bonding, no one would do it.
2016-10-25 00:24:17	drac_boy	catphish on the other hand if you can find the cards yourself then infiniband isn't THAT expensive for a home pro/lab setup tho :) (hint: the infiniband switch is by a company with the first letter of M)
2016-10-25 00:24:20	+catphish	using linux as a switch is definitely an option if necessary
2016-10-25 00:24:24	+catphish	it should do a few Gbits
2016-10-25 00:24:58	Haxxa	ok are there any decent managed gigabit switches which support etherchannel bundling have 8 ports or more and use less than 40w + less than $170usd

2016-10-25 00:25:13	ryao	For less than $170 USD, you can probably get infiniband point to point.

2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight_	[21:16:41] Let me try SSH to be sure. [21:16:41]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	zapotah	[21:17:05] _the_ webserver? [21:17:05]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight_	[21:17:30] Oh, the computer in question is my (one and only) server [21:17:30]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight_	[21:18:04] Okay, so I've just established that whatever IP I pick, it redirects to my server :') [21:18:04]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	zapotah	[21:18:23] sounds like a proxy arp fuckup [21:18:23]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	zapotah	[21:18:34] somewhere [21:18:34]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight_	[21:18:38] I just factory resetted the router [21:18:38]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight_	[21:18:48] But this weird stuff is the reason I did it, though. [21:18:48]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight_	[21:19:02] For some reason it assigned a new static ip to my server. [21:19:02]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	jxer	[21:19:03] is the server using proxy ip's? [21:19:03]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	jxer	[21:19:11] what kind of server is it? [21:19:11]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight_	[21:19:16] It's a debian box [21:19:16]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	jxer	[21:19:26] like a normal no frills setup? [21:19:26]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight_	[21:19:28] Im a network noob, so let's say that networking "just worked" [21:19:28]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight_	[21:19:31] yes [21:19:31]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	jxer	[21:19:35] not esx? [21:19:35]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight_	[21:19:49] That's the other network kind, right? [21:19:49]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	zapotah	[21:20:00] this is like the blind leading the blind [21:20:00]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight_	[21:20:11] It's gigabit to a gigabit switch, which is connected to the router via 100mbit [21:20:11]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	jxer	[21:20:18] ok [21:20:18]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	jxer	[21:20:21] nvm then [21:20:21]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight_	[21:20:23] :D [21:20:23]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	jxer	[21:20:24] see if the reboot fixes [21:20:24]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight_	[21:20:28] Tried it, no help [21:20:28]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	jxer	[21:20:35] reboot the server [21:20:35]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight_	[21:20:41] Tried that, too [21:20:41]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	jxer	[21:21:00] screenshot the dhcp table [21:21:00]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	jxer	[21:21:05] leases [21:21:05]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	zapotah	[21:21:24] its not a dhcp issue [21:21:24]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	zapotah	[21:21:29] ill give that as a hint [21:21:29]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	jxer	[21:21:38] if you know the problem [21:21:38]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	jxer	[21:21:50] stop being a dick and just tell him the solution [21:21:50]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	jxer	[21:22:00] wtf is wrong with you? [21:22:00]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight_	[21:22:13] I think he means it's just not the DHCP, but I don't know what else it is [21:22:13]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight_	[21:22:20] (or she) [21:22:20]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	jxer	[21:22:35] no he's being a dick [21:22:35]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	jxer	[21:22:41] not much else to say about it [21:22:41]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight_	[21:22:57] Maybe if I can reboot my rpi and see if that connects to the wifi, I can check if those ip's match [21:22:57]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight_	[21:24:25] I'll be right back. [21:24:25]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight_	[21:24:43] Going to try and delete the dhcp entry, assign a static ip (I want), add that to DMZ, boot the server back up [21:24:43]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight_	[21:24:55] God knows what this crappy fritzbox is doing under the hood. [21:24:55]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	jxer	[21:25:10] why are you putting anything in a dmz? [21:25:10]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	allamoox	[21:31:03] Guys is it correct that a network ID should be alwayse an even number? [21:31:03]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	Harlock	[21:33:13] mostly [21:33:13]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	allamoox	[21:36:56] Harlock:  so 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.0.1 192.168.3.1 What will be the network ID for it [21:36:56]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight1	[21:37:48] Eh, not working. [21:37:48]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	m1dnight1	[21:38:00] Now I should have assigned an address outside of the DHCP pool, but it's unreachable. [21:38:00]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	lamba	[21:38:18] bit of a tard question i'm afraid. in eigrp if you've got two routes to a network, via 2 interfaces, and both routes come in with the same reported distance; Then if interface metrics are default, and both are the same speed, the feasible metric should also match, right ? [21:38:18]

2016-10-25 15:33:47	Skymont	[23:54:13] so does anyone know what the issue could be, if i can connect to irc but my web browser pages won't load? [23:54:13]

2016-10-25 15:33:47	+pppingme	[23:56:48] Skymont is this a real question or a ##homework question? [23:56:48]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	Skymont	[23:56:59] real question [23:56:59]

2016-10-25 15:33:47	Skymont	[23:59:35] weird* lol [23:59:35]

2016-10-25 15:33:47	Andrew8472	[00:05:59] networks work weird some rare times also, like any computer system [00:05:59]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	tpr	[00:07:50] mm. /etc/hosts is safer against ddos [00:07:50]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	tpr	[00:07:56] than your local dns server [00:07:56]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	tpr	[00:08:18] or your not so local authoritative server.. [00:08:18]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	+pppingme	[00:10:27] Andrew8472 network behavior is very predictable [00:10:27]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	Skymont	[00:11:09] it might be because of my vpn [00:11:09]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	Andrew8472	[00:11:35] pppingme: yes, just it can fail some rare times [00:11:35]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	+pppingme	[00:11:56] rarely, at least not without some action. [00:11:56]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	Andrew8472	[00:12:05] like refreshing the web page and it works [00:12:05]

2016-10-25 15:33:47	Network2501	[00:15:19] that's a paddling [00:15:19]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	^7heo	[00:15:29] that's a stupid discussion. [00:15:29]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	Bray90820	[00:16:48] B0g4r7: I know it's a kernel panic because my network card halted but I have no idea how to fix it [00:16:48]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	+pppingme	[00:16:54] Andrew8472 if it didn't work the first time, there was a reason, it may not be a reason you're privy to, but there was a reason, so, again, networks are 100% predictable, you not knowing about a failed state doesn't make them unpredictable. [00:16:54]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	Andrew8472	[00:18:33] I was refering to Skymont's issue BTW [00:18:33]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	Andrew8472	[00:19:32] but networking is like any other computer system, it can fails too, not 100% perfect [00:19:32]

2016-10-25 17:57:01	chezidek	[02:55:30] hey if i have an IAM role that is allowed to write to logs:*, if someone hacks that box cant they just use that role to delete all my logs? [02:55:30]
2016-10-25 17:57:01	chezidek	[02:56:00] i goog'd for some ways to mitigate that but didnt see anything [02:56:00]
2016-10-25 17:57:01	+pppingme	[03:09:35] chezidek a good reason to dis-allow non-root logins [03:09:35]
2016-10-25 17:57:01	chezidek	[03:10:08] so only let root log in? [03:10:08]
2016-10-25 17:57:01	+pppingme	[03:10:20] typo.. [03:10:20]
2016-10-25 17:57:01	+pppingme	[03:10:23] you get the gist though [03:10:23]
2016-10-25 17:57:01	chezidek	[03:10:40] yea, you're right [03:10:40]
2016-10-25 17:57:01	chezidek	[03:10:51] guess apache isn't running as a user that can su anyway [03:10:51]
2016-10-25 17:57:01	chezidek	[03:10:56] so barring some priv escalation it should be ok [03:10:56]
2016-10-25 17:57:01	+pppingme	[03:11:12] no services should ever run as root [03:11:12]
2016-10-25 17:57:01	chezidek	[03:11:24] since thats most of what ive seen, is people getting in thru a vulnerability or misconfig in php or something [03:11:24]
2016-10-25 17:57:01	mmlj4	[03:18:06] root shouldn't be able to log in except with ssh keys [03:18:06]

2016-10-25 21:01:35	+pppingme	and I don't think you can split management vs run environment, i.e. the "manager" has to run on the same box, while with libivrt, I can run virt-manager remotely if I want/need (none of my virt-servers even run a gui)
