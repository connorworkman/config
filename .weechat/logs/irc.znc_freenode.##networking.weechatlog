Looking at the Google Search Console, it says it cannot crawl the site due to a DNS error, however we can all access it via mydomain.com and www.mydomain.com - it confuses my tiny mind.

However, it seems like I cannot scan those ports that dont have running service bind to that port.  so my question is, how can I scan all those ports with or without service bind to them.

2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:20:44] at least in ethernet [05:20:44]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:20:57] rjsalts: About that, the 10G is shared among all on the node, so a SFP module that is limited to 1GbE is fine. [05:20:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:21:49] If I were building a new network for internet connectivity, I would probably go with 10G-EPON. I have no idea why Google Fiber didn't. No legacy cruft. [05:21:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:22:03] This has diagrams explaining: https://www.dslreports.com/forum/r30519466-PON-EPON-or-GPON-or-GEPON [05:22:03]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:22:17] This one is good: https://www.dslreports.com/r0/download/2252302~256f9cd0ef7c9c3cecf2019dd954bc8f/4144_627 [05:22:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:22:54] Then again, you get a 1500 MTU with GPON... [05:22:54]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:27:04] If you're gold plating why not go with active optical network with multiple fibres into each home and having ospf/isis/... layer 3 network in jellyfish topology [05:27:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:27:27] rjsalts: That is expensive. PON is cheaper. :P [05:27:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:27:34] rjsalts: Anyway, I am not building a new last mile network. [05:27:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:27:57] I know, hence the gold plating ;) [05:27:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:29:22] yeah, pissed that it doesn't look likely we'll even get PON here, let alone active optical network [05:29:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:35:50] Hi, I have created centos iptables policy to accept input, output and forward for all ports 1 to 65535 as for testing purpose so that I can scan them to see if they are really open. However, it seems like I cannot scan those ports that dont have running service bind to that port.  so my question is, how can I scan all those ports with or without service bind to them. [05:35:50]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:37:30] rommel092079: you dont [05:37:30]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:37:53] rommel092079: something needs to listen on a port for it to accept connections [05:37:53]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:37:53] zapotah, what do you mean ? [05:37:53]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:37:58] rommel092079: the kernel would send back the icmp message to say that the port wasn't open if there is no listening process [05:37:58]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:38:19] so I really need a service to bind to that port ? [05:38:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:38:45] rjsalts: no, i said all that out of spite [05:38:45]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:38:58] rommel092079: yes, really [05:38:58]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:39:02] rommel092079: or write a custom kernel that does something strange [05:39:02]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:39:09] is there a service that will bind to all those ports? [05:39:09]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:39:28] zapotah: huh? [05:39:28]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:39:32] or can you advice me something where I can scan all those ports? [05:39:32]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:40:56] rommel092079: no, you would have to have a very strange use case for that to even be helpful [05:40:56]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:41:49] rommel092079: whats the point of all this nonsense [05:41:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:41:55] zapotah: what do you mean, you said it out of spite? [05:41:55]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:42:05] rjsalts: highlight mistake [05:42:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:42:12] was meant for rommel092079 [05:42:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:42:15] ah [05:42:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:42:23] fucking phone [05:42:23]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:42:25] rjsalts, I just have to scan all those ports to know which port are accessible behind firewall or something. [05:42:25]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:42:38] difficult AF to type [05:42:38]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:43:35] rommel092079: well, you wont scan udp anyway [05:43:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:44:04] why [05:44:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:44:18] rommel092079: because thats how udp works [05:44:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:44:57] rommel092079: udp doesn't have a "connnection" your udp sender gives destination and port and preys something is there to listen [05:44:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:44:58] alright. I will have to focus on tcp [05:44:58]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:45:10] prays even [05:45:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:45:19] rommel092079: for tcp youd write a script that spawns ie. netcat instances [05:45:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:45:37] rommel092079: dont ask how [05:45:37]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:45:52] rommel092079: prime opportunity to learn scripting here [05:45:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:46:04] netcat? [05:46:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:46:17] rommel092079: it can't tell the difference between packet loss, firewall, wrong destination, etc for udp [05:46:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:46:48] rommel092079: it's a very simple program to set up a tcp connection to/from stdin/stdout [05:46:48]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:46:59] rommel092079: socat also does udp [05:46:59]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:47:29] alright. googling time netcat and socat. [05:47:29]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:47:32] tnx [05:47:32]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	linocisco	[06:59:45] hi all [06:59:45]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	linocisco	[07:00:05] how to check my network security? [07:00:05]

2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:44:36] Hey hey hey, so does anyone presently here know about traffic sniffing and analysis? [09:44:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:44:58] I want to be able to visit linkedin.com at work without my butthole puckering up. [09:44:58]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:46:09] But more importantly, I like to pass commands to my torrentbox so that I have a movie to watch when I get home. [09:46:09]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:46:43] There was a company wide email last week warning against torrenting while at work, and I think it's just coincidental, but it still has me paranoid that I'm leaking packets or something. [09:46:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Tools	[09:47:20] I think that would be more aimed at people torrent on their workstation instead of downloading it at home. [09:47:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:47:53] Tools: yeah, but if I point my work browser at let's say demenoid or piratebay, I don't want that throwing a flag on the filter either. [09:47:53]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:48:14] It's easier for me to just browse on the work pc and then curl or wget the torrent files after I've found what I want. [09:48:14]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:49:10] So the idea is keep the the browser traffic cloaked by passing it through SSH/socks. [09:49:10]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:50:43] I didn't see anything other than data going from my work pc to VPS when I grepped my tcpdump logs. So I guess I'm good? [09:50:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:51:20] But I don't know if those packets contain header information (about the final destination, f.e. demenoid.com). [09:51:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:51:56] Input from knowledgeable lurkers would be greatly appreciated. [09:51:56]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	lithiumpt	[09:52:05] you could have a dns leak [09:52:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:53:28] dns leak would only show the domain name and not the /whatevercomesafter path, right? [09:53:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:54:10] for example, if i visited Dogs.com/barkblocker. The dns would only show a request to dogs.com? [09:54:10]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:56:16] Anyway, I have my browser routing dns through SSH/socks. So I think I should be dns-leak free. [09:56:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	rabbitear	[09:57:03] Indigoblue: wireshark? [09:57:03]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:57:38] rabbitear: wireshark looked good too, but I'm still a newb so I doubt it was a thorough sweep. [09:57:38]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:58:11] All I looked for were packets on TCP/UDP ports 53. [09:58:11]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:59:06] Occasionally javascript will bypass the socks proxy, but that's usually just clever adverts [09:59:06]

2016-10-18 02:00:30	Indigoblue	I'm wondering if my employer will be able to see web-traffic routed through a SSH/socks5 proxy w/remote dns.
2016-10-18 02:00:55	Indigoblue	Company currently uses BYOD policy.
2016-10-18 02:00:55	inire	is the ssh/socks5 proxy owned by your employer?
2016-10-18 02:01:08	Indigoblue	No, it is not. It is a personal vps
2016-10-18 02:01:31	inire	ok, so, you make an ssh connection through the employer network to the ssh server on vps
2016-10-18 02:01:32	GeekNerd_phone	Indigoblue: before attempting to help with this, I'd say you maybe want to read your AUP (acceptable use policy) and try not to be a dick.
2016-10-18 02:01:56	inire	ssh is encrypted, so they won't see any of that traffic
2016-10-18 02:02:16	inire	as long as ALL your traffic is tunneled down that connection, you won't have "issues"
2016-10-18 02:02:25	inire	but, see what GeekNerd is saying
2016-10-18 02:02:28	GeekNerd_phone	they WILL know that encrypted traffic is there, and where its destination is (the IP address of your VPS)
2016-10-18 02:02:37	GeekNerd_phone	if they are monitoring you
2016-10-18 02:02:37		[02:02]
2016-10-18 02:02:47	Indigoblue	GeekNerd_phone: AFAIK our AUP does not say anything about VPS or private VPN.
2016-10-18 02:03:04	Indigoblue	Yeah, I'm not concerned about them seeing encrypted traffic, as long as the bandwidth is low.
2016-10-18 02:03:20	GeekNerd_phone	and unless you are in a communist dictatorship, where employers would turn you in for free speech, I see no reason to use their network for things you must hide from them

2016-10-18 03:36:13	drac_boy	I suspect the wire is because the cable itself doesn't have any ground pins from either ends
2016-10-18 03:36:20	UncleDrax	but protected patch panels for example supposedly can shunt surges to ground and such. you might kill your panel, but in theory it's cheaper than replacing the equipment that was attached to it.
2016-10-18 03:36:24	UncleDrax	also you need good groudning ofc

2016-10-18 03:58:32	djph	not really no
2016-10-18 03:58:47	Haris	for e.g., if ISP gives me a link with 1 Gbps interface speed, but 10 or 30 Mbps CIR bw, would it help latency if this is the case

2016-10-18 03:59:27	Gollee	sure, the traffic is sent at 10x the speed at 1gig then at 100mbit, but the difference is probably negligible in the big picture
2016-10-18 03:59:47	UncleDrax	it would improve the latency on that particular physical link between you and your ISPs equipment. but you're talking like a couple nanoseconds at best. which is irrelevent for most uses

2016-10-18 05:46:51	@daemonkeeper	Sure one only takes 5V, but you need a transformer from your normal voltage and that is not that efficient.

2016-10-18 07:27:49	jxer	would u want your controller inthe cloud
2016-10-18 07:27:52	Milotop	well squeeb, we've trained ourselves with samsung and mikrotik, so we're probably not gonna consider ubnt
2016-10-18 07:28:03	Milotop	also jxer makes a valid point tbh
2016-10-18 07:28:03	jxer	thus requring a solid internet connection just to manage your network
2016-10-18 07:28:06	jxer	i think thats nuts
2016-10-18 07:28:10	squeeb	jxer: ask meraki ?
2016-10-18 07:28:20	jxer	i think cloud has its place
2016-10-18 07:28:24	jxer	this is not one of them
2016-10-18 07:28:25	squeeb	actually no, if the controller goes offline, the APs keep running
2016-10-18 07:28:29	jxer	yet
2016-10-18 07:28:32	jxer	u can't manage it
2016-10-18 07:28:34	jxer	or make changes
2016-10-18 07:28:40	squeeb	jxer: Meraki are doing this now
2016-10-18 07:28:42	jxer	keep the controller onsite
2016-10-18 07:28:44	squeeb	and they're lolrich
2016-10-18 07:28:50	jxer	yea
2016-10-18 07:28:59	jxer	cus the "cloud" is the friggin answer to everything
2016-10-18 07:29:04	Milotop	everyone who sells DUH CLOUD is lolrich because it's the most recent buzzword in IT
2016-10-18 07:29:10	Milotop	everyone throws down cash if they even hear it
2016-10-18 07:29:12	squeeb	Yea it's diagonally scalable in the cloud
2016-10-18 07:29:14	jxer	pretty much
2016-10-18 07:29:16	jxer	scales
2016-10-18 07:29:20	jxer	its amazing
2016-10-18 07:29:31	djph	there can be arguments made for both a local (on-site) and "cloud" (i.e. "in your office a mile away") installations of the controller
2016-10-18 07:29:32	jxer	it will even suck your dick if you pay for the platinum package

2016-10-18 12:13:19	Dagger	you can arrange for v6 addresses to be about 64 bits (with the remaining bits set to zero), which is pretty similar to the two 32-bit addresses you end up with on NATed v4

I need to create a 2 x /24 subnets for that 4G device, the 4g usb device will be mounted to a virtualbox VM pfsense that will route all traffic to a VPN. The thing I don't know, is how and is it possible to make the 2 subnets with the 4g usb in the pfsense. I have the same setup now (2 x /24 subnets and 5 vms connecting to the pfsense but through

2016-10-18 16:08:38	Network2501	some sort of purchased thing
2016-10-18 16:09:02	Network2501	the end point just needs to accepted and forward on incoming connection requests
2016-10-18 16:09:38	Network2501	my guess is though it's just used for anon so it won't permit inbound connection attempts

2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[08:57:41] archer121: it writes all traffic between HOST-A and HOST-B and icmp packets to/from HOST-A. [08:57:41]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121	[08:58:11] evilman_work: You are so helpfull! [08:58:11]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[08:59:12] archer121: run the tcpdump and check again. then stop tcpdump with CTRL+C, and then open the dump in the wireshark. [08:59:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121	[08:59:45] evilman_work: okey. [08:59:45]

2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:01:48] archer121: when it has been done, let's analyse it together. [09:01:48]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121	[09:09:38] evilman_work: I have the dump file. At this point, I would like to tell why I am doing this because I don't want it to be a xy problem. Someone has written a python script to backup some files to google drive. When they are running the problem, they are getting this issue: https://paste.ubuntu.com/23347579/ So I thought of helping him debug the issue. [09:09:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121	[09:10:01] evilman_work: running the program* [09:10:01]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121	[09:11:07] evilman_work: So the actual HOST-B in question is not centineltest.cardinalcommerce.com but some google server. Will that be an issue? [09:11:07]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:12:12] archer121: it doesn't matter. there are tons things those cause the same issue.  open the dump in the wireshark. [09:12:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:13:36] archer121: then in wireshark: Statistics -> Conversation List -> TCP [09:13:36]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	bytefire	[09:13:45] do ldap and nfs perform same function? [09:13:45]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:15:38] bytecat: nope. start from wiki-articles about these things. [09:15:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121	[09:17:04] evilman_work: TCP Conversions = 1. I get a line. [09:17:04]

2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:21:58] archer121: show the screenshot, please. [09:21:58]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121	[09:22:25] evilman_work: After closing the conversations window, right? [09:22:25]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:22:33] archer121: yep. [09:22:33]

2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:25:30] archer121: as can you see, the server side shutdowns the connection after receiving of client hello message. [09:25:30]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121	[09:27:34] evilman_work: Did you infer that from the TCP Flags> [09:27:34]

2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:28:15] archer121: yep, from tcp flags and sequence numbers. [09:28:15]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	zapotah	[09:29:06] whatever fails, fails with the ssl handshake there [09:29:06]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	zapotah	[09:30:09] perhaps the script tries to do an ssl3.0 negotiation and google has disabled that [09:30:09]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:30:12] archer121: seems like the server side doesn't like the client hello message. [09:30:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:30:46] archer121: you can check the detail from client hello message. [09:30:46]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:30:54] **the details [09:30:54]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121	[09:31:06] evilman_work: Let me check. [09:31:06]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121_	[09:34:21] evilman_work: I had to reconnect to a different WiFi and hence may have lost anything you have said after: <evilman_work> **the details [09:34:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121_	[09:34:52] evilman_work: Maybe the server doesnot support tls1? [09:34:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121_	[09:36:57] evilman_work: Another thing that I noticed is that there is a field called GMT Unix Time: and it has year 2076 [09:36:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121_	[09:37:38] evilman_work: But the system time is correct [09:37:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:39:21] archer121_: hm.. it's very strange. [09:39:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121_	[09:42:07] evilman_work: And another point is that this issue is happening only from this machine. Other machines in the subnet is using tls fine. [09:42:07]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:43:49] archer121_: are you getting this issue with all tls connections or only when you are connecting to several hosts? [09:43:49]

2016-10-18 23:55:21	Zajt	[09:45:45] On this one: https://puu.sh/rO8iV/b0aa1905b8.png can I say that in the TCP case if you use retransmissions,the throughput will be higher than without retransmissions? [09:45:45]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:45:52] archer121_: yep. try to connect to other servers. [09:45:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	archer121_	[09:47:21] evilman_work: google.com is not working. Also I noticed that it takes some time for openssl command to finish. It takes a couple of seconds after printing "CONNECTED(00000003)" [09:47:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	zapotah	[09:48:08] Zajt: instead of expecting ##networking to give you answers to your homework, i suggest reading up on the concepts and understanding what the impact of the various forms of communication are [09:48:08]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	zapotah	[09:48:29] Zajt: dont have time and got tests coming up and hoping to braindump stuff? too bad. [09:48:29]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Zajt	[09:48:43] I read at teh same time zapotah but ask here if my answers seem to be correct because we don't have any answers [09:48:43]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	evilman_work	[09:49:30] archer121_: use -msg and -state options in the openssl command. [09:49:30]

2016-10-19 00:08:39	+catphish_	seems like the problem is on the linux end, since its receiving the ESP packets but not decrypting them (or not feeding them back into the gre tunnel)
2016-10-19 00:09:18	evilman_work	catphish_: so you can use the ip xfrm monitor to get the debug info in realtime.

2016-10-19 00:12:25	archer121_	evilman_work: you mean connect to a server which uses ssl, and get the dump from server side?

2016-10-19 00:41:21	+catphish_	[10:07:19] traffic works perfectly one way, i see encrypted packets going back the other way, but they don't appear decrypted on the fre ijnterface [10:07:19]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	+catphish_	[10:07:24] *gre interface [10:07:24]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	evilman_work	[10:07:36] catphish_: what kind of hardware do you use on the ends? [10:07:36]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	+catphish_	[10:07:59] one end is an edgerouter pro, the other end is linux (libreswan) [10:07:59]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	+catphish_	[10:08:39] seems like the problem is on the linux end, since its receiving the ESP packets but not decrypting them (or not feeding them back into the gre tunnel) [10:08:39]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	evilman_work	[10:09:18] catphish_: so you can use the ip xfrm monitor to get the debug info in realtime. [10:09:18]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	+catphish_	[10:09:53] that sounds like what i need [10:09:53]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	evilman_work	[10:11:11] archer121_: seems like correct client hello. have you write the dump from client end? can you write the dump from server end? [10:11:11]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	zamba	[10:11:45] how safe is it to start increasing mtu size on my local network? [10:11:45]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	+catphish_	[10:12:18] zamba: if all devices and the switch support it and are configured the same (switch can be higher), then its ok [10:12:18]

2016-10-19 00:41:21	archer121_	[10:12:25] evilman_work: you mean connect to a server which uses ssl, and get the dump from server side? [10:12:25]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	evilman_work	[10:12:32] archer121_: yep. [10:12:32]

2016-10-19 00:41:21	+catphish_	[10:13:08] evilman_work: weirdly "ip xfrm state list" shows the tunnel twice [10:13:08]

2016-10-19 04:03:17	TheGoodDoc	Alright, so this might be a silly question (There is a reason for me asking this). We recently had a change in ISP, and it is to be a GB line up and down, well they guys was here, installed it, and the speeds was subpar, talking 300 down 800 up. So we have been dealing with them for a while now. They are trying to say it might be a DNS issue, I understand DNS could cause latency, but is there any way it could effect bandwit
2016-10-19 04:04:33	UncleDrax	for Gig, I have to bring up that not all test points (esp if it's out in public Internet land) are equal. How are you testing this? something like iPerf between 2 on-net end-points?
2016-10-19 04:05:10	UncleDrax	also older or poor-quality NICs can't do true Gig line-rate even. probably only an issue on laptops or netbooks these days though.

The hardware is what they provided, and according to them, they have done up to 4gb connection installs.

2016-10-19 04:48:16	+catphish_	the book is very old i would suggest
2016-10-19 04:48:37	+catphish_	 /30 can be necessary for hardware thats older than me
2016-10-19 04:48:40	plus65Naomi	I am studying CCNA
2016-10-19 04:48:51	+catphish_	 /31 is often used when the 2 ends have adjacent IPs
2016-10-19 04:49:01	UncleDrax	 /30 is the default that would have the most compliance. /31s can be used for newer kit
2016-10-19 04:49:15	UncleDrax	for the purposes of a test, say /30
2016-10-19 04:49:27	+catphish_	then again, who uses a point to point serial link in 2016?

2016-10-19 08:51:27	OMGDoggeh	Hello eahmedshendy. Do you want to be DR?
2016-10-19 08:51:27	eahmedshendy	Here is the situation, when you have a simple network infrastructure, one DSL router for internet and local network, and a local server behind this DSL router. This local server hosts a website. Internet can access application on this local server through a static IP address.
2016-10-19 08:51:27	eahmedshendy	Here is the problem, when local server is connected to the network of the local employee (which means has access to the router and internet), internet bandwidth is getting too low, even google can�t be opened easily. If we disconnected this server from the network, internet connection is getting back to normal, and everyone feels fine against it.

2016-10-19 08:51:28	eahmedshendy	So how do you think as a procedure to identify the problem. After many things (with my little knowledge), I guess the server may be hacked.
2016-10-19 08:51:30	sveinse	notabyte: weell. it depends. I'm replacing a Cisco RV320. Bigger crap that that is hard to find
2016-10-19 08:51:31	eahmedshendy	The admin of the server (non-IT guy) told me that the server previously can be accessed through static IP address from internet, and locally, but from the localhost itself only you can �ping 8.8.8.8� but not �ping www.google.com�, some friend just edited resolv.conf file with a DNS, and now the server can access internet. After this change in resolv.conf, the problem of internet bandwidth is started.

2016-10-19 10:37:49	webbly	ryao: because I thought so?

2016-10-19 10:46:15	OMGDoggeh	of it. Hairpinning is where a machine on the LAN is able to access another machine on the LAN via the external IP address of the LAN/router (with port forwarding set up on the router to direct requests to the appropriate machine on the LAN).

2016-10-19 11:37:58	thurstylark	We have a product that uses a Debian Jessie box as the gateway, DHCP, and DNS server. This is usually connected directly to an Engenius ENS500EXT ap. Every client on this network connects through this ap. We wanted to start connecting some of these clients hardwired, so we put an unmanaged switch between the jessie box and the AP. This stops traffic through that ap until we configure the ap to remove the

2016-10-19 16:12:06	cipher6	fair enough, they're putting me through WGU where the finals ARE the certs,
2016-10-19 16:12:21	cipher6	so as long as they're footing 100% of the bill, I'm going to collect as many certs as possible,
2016-10-19 16:12:26	B0g4r7	jge, to do a throughput test, you'd have to move a lot of data through it.  You'd need the cooperation of another host on the other side of the link to send and receive that data.
2016-10-19 16:12:50	B0g4r7	Like speedtest.net, to give a simple example.
2016-10-19 16:12:57	jge	B0g4r7: ohh

2016-10-19 16:48:41	B0g4r7	Of course it's linux under the hood, but they try not to let it show.

2016-10-19 20:40:03	sanyiamacs	[06:37:58] how would you expect that to work [06:37:58]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	Celmor	[06:38:20] implementation wise or writing the rule? [06:38:20]

2016-10-19 20:40:07	Celmor	so the shortest method to specify a multitude of rules to match for multiple interfaces would be to define rules for each of these interface to forward them to a shared chain?

But if using 10.0.0.2 I can not ping 10.0.0.1. Tried using virio-net and i added 2 vlan tags in my route for each subnet. Bit ignorant in this area but my end goal is to have a separate lan on my network to which I can assign ips to VM's in a virtualbox thats on bridged networking.

2016-10-20 05:21:23	radialneon	Hello, I ran some tests on my SAMBA file server and found that it performs rather well when the computers that read/write to it are connected to the router via cable but it is very slow (1.5MB/s max) when doing so via wi-fi. Help? :)
2016-10-20 05:22:00	radialneon	I'm suspecting this might be a network problem. I use a DI-524 router to connect the devices. The file server is connected via cable to the router.
