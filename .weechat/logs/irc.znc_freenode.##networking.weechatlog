Looking at the Google Search Console, it says it cannot crawl the site due to a DNS error, however we can all access it via mydomain.com and www.mydomain.com - it confuses my tiny mind.

However, it seems like I cannot scan those ports that dont have running service bind to that port.  so my question is, how can I scan all those ports with or without service bind to them.

2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:20:44] at least in ethernet [05:20:44]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:20:57] rjsalts: About that, the 10G is shared among all on the node, so a SFP module that is limited to 1GbE is fine. [05:20:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:21:49] If I were building a new network for internet connectivity, I would probably go with 10G-EPON. I have no idea why Google Fiber didn't. No legacy cruft. [05:21:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:22:03] This has diagrams explaining: https://www.dslreports.com/forum/r30519466-PON-EPON-or-GPON-or-GEPON [05:22:03]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:22:17] This one is good: https://www.dslreports.com/r0/download/2252302~256f9cd0ef7c9c3cecf2019dd954bc8f/4144_627 [05:22:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:22:54] Then again, you get a 1500 MTU with GPON... [05:22:54]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:27:04] If you're gold plating why not go with active optical network with multiple fibres into each home and having ospf/isis/... layer 3 network in jellyfish topology [05:27:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:27:27] rjsalts: That is expensive. PON is cheaper. :P [05:27:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	ryao	[05:27:34] rjsalts: Anyway, I am not building a new last mile network. [05:27:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:27:57] I know, hence the gold plating ;) [05:27:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:29:22] yeah, pissed that it doesn't look likely we'll even get PON here, let alone active optical network [05:29:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:35:50] Hi, I have created centos iptables policy to accept input, output and forward for all ports 1 to 65535 as for testing purpose so that I can scan them to see if they are really open. However, it seems like I cannot scan those ports that dont have running service bind to that port.  so my question is, how can I scan all those ports with or without service bind to them. [05:35:50]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:37:30] rommel092079: you dont [05:37:30]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:37:53] rommel092079: something needs to listen on a port for it to accept connections [05:37:53]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:37:53] zapotah, what do you mean ? [05:37:53]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:37:58] rommel092079: the kernel would send back the icmp message to say that the port wasn't open if there is no listening process [05:37:58]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:38:19] so I really need a service to bind to that port ? [05:38:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:38:45] rjsalts: no, i said all that out of spite [05:38:45]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:38:58] rommel092079: yes, really [05:38:58]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:39:02] rommel092079: or write a custom kernel that does something strange [05:39:02]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:39:09] is there a service that will bind to all those ports? [05:39:09]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:39:28] zapotah: huh? [05:39:28]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:39:32] or can you advice me something where I can scan all those ports? [05:39:32]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:40:56] rommel092079: no, you would have to have a very strange use case for that to even be helpful [05:40:56]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:41:49] rommel092079: whats the point of all this nonsense [05:41:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:41:55] zapotah: what do you mean, you said it out of spite? [05:41:55]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:42:05] rjsalts: highlight mistake [05:42:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:42:12] was meant for rommel092079 [05:42:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:42:15] ah [05:42:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:42:23] fucking phone [05:42:23]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:42:25] rjsalts, I just have to scan all those ports to know which port are accessible behind firewall or something. [05:42:25]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:42:38] difficult AF to type [05:42:38]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:43:35] rommel092079: well, you wont scan udp anyway [05:43:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:44:04] why [05:44:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:44:18] rommel092079: because thats how udp works [05:44:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:44:57] rommel092079: udp doesn't have a "connnection" your udp sender gives destination and port and preys something is there to listen [05:44:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:44:58] alright. I will have to focus on tcp [05:44:58]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:45:10] prays even [05:45:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:45:19] rommel092079: for tcp youd write a script that spawns ie. netcat instances [05:45:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:45:37] rommel092079: dont ask how [05:45:37]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	zapotah	[05:45:52] rommel092079: prime opportunity to learn scripting here [05:45:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:46:04] netcat? [05:46:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:46:17] rommel092079: it can't tell the difference between packet loss, firewall, wrong destination, etc for udp [05:46:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:46:48] rommel092079: it's a very simple program to set up a tcp connection to/from stdin/stdout [05:46:48]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rjsalts	[05:46:59] rommel092079: socat also does udp [05:46:59]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:47:29] alright. googling time netcat and socat. [05:47:29]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	rommel092079	[05:47:32] tnx [05:47:32]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	linocisco	[06:59:45] hi all [06:59:45]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	linocisco	[07:00:05] how to check my network security? [07:00:05]

2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:44:36] Hey hey hey, so does anyone presently here know about traffic sniffing and analysis? [09:44:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:44:58] I want to be able to visit linkedin.com at work without my butthole puckering up. [09:44:58]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:46:09] But more importantly, I like to pass commands to my torrentbox so that I have a movie to watch when I get home. [09:46:09]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:46:43] There was a company wide email last week warning against torrenting while at work, and I think it's just coincidental, but it still has me paranoid that I'm leaking packets or something. [09:46:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Tools	[09:47:20] I think that would be more aimed at people torrent on their workstation instead of downloading it at home. [09:47:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:47:53] Tools: yeah, but if I point my work browser at let's say demenoid or piratebay, I don't want that throwing a flag on the filter either. [09:47:53]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:48:14] It's easier for me to just browse on the work pc and then curl or wget the torrent files after I've found what I want. [09:48:14]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:49:10] So the idea is keep the the browser traffic cloaked by passing it through SSH/socks. [09:49:10]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:50:43] I didn't see anything other than data going from my work pc to VPS when I grepped my tcpdump logs. So I guess I'm good? [09:50:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:51:20] But I don't know if those packets contain header information (about the final destination, f.e. demenoid.com). [09:51:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:51:56] Input from knowledgeable lurkers would be greatly appreciated. [09:51:56]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	lithiumpt	[09:52:05] you could have a dns leak [09:52:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:53:28] dns leak would only show the domain name and not the /whatevercomesafter path, right? [09:53:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:54:10] for example, if i visited Dogs.com/barkblocker. The dns would only show a request to dogs.com? [09:54:10]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:56:16] Anyway, I have my browser routing dns through SSH/socks. So I think I should be dns-leak free. [09:56:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	rabbitear	[09:57:03] Indigoblue: wireshark? [09:57:03]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:57:38] rabbitear: wireshark looked good too, but I'm still a newb so I doubt it was a thorough sweep. [09:57:38]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:58:11] All I looked for were packets on TCP/UDP ports 53. [09:58:11]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Indigoblue	[09:59:06] Occasionally javascript will bypass the socks proxy, but that's usually just clever adverts [09:59:06]

2016-10-18 02:00:30	Indigoblue	I'm wondering if my employer will be able to see web-traffic routed through a SSH/socks5 proxy w/remote dns.
2016-10-18 02:00:55	Indigoblue	Company currently uses BYOD policy.
2016-10-18 02:00:55	inire	is the ssh/socks5 proxy owned by your employer?
2016-10-18 02:01:08	Indigoblue	No, it is not. It is a personal vps
2016-10-18 02:01:31	inire	ok, so, you make an ssh connection through the employer network to the ssh server on vps
2016-10-18 02:01:32	GeekNerd_phone	Indigoblue: before attempting to help with this, I'd say you maybe want to read your AUP (acceptable use policy) and try not to be a dick.
2016-10-18 02:01:56	inire	ssh is encrypted, so they won't see any of that traffic
2016-10-18 02:02:16	inire	as long as ALL your traffic is tunneled down that connection, you won't have "issues"
2016-10-18 02:02:25	inire	but, see what GeekNerd is saying
2016-10-18 02:02:28	GeekNerd_phone	they WILL know that encrypted traffic is there, and where its destination is (the IP address of your VPS)
2016-10-18 02:02:37	GeekNerd_phone	if they are monitoring you
2016-10-18 02:02:37		[02:02]
2016-10-18 02:02:47	Indigoblue	GeekNerd_phone: AFAIK our AUP does not say anything about VPS or private VPN.
2016-10-18 02:03:04	Indigoblue	Yeah, I'm not concerned about them seeing encrypted traffic, as long as the bandwidth is low.
2016-10-18 02:03:20	GeekNerd_phone	and unless you are in a communist dictatorship, where employers would turn you in for free speech, I see no reason to use their network for things you must hide from them

2016-10-18 03:36:13	drac_boy	I suspect the wire is because the cable itself doesn't have any ground pins from either ends
2016-10-18 03:36:20	UncleDrax	but protected patch panels for example supposedly can shunt surges to ground and such. you might kill your panel, but in theory it's cheaper than replacing the equipment that was attached to it.
2016-10-18 03:36:24	UncleDrax	also you need good groudning ofc

2016-10-18 03:58:32	djph	not really no
2016-10-18 03:58:47	Haris	for e.g., if ISP gives me a link with 1 Gbps interface speed, but 10 or 30 Mbps CIR bw, would it help latency if this is the case

2016-10-18 03:59:27	Gollee	sure, the traffic is sent at 10x the speed at 1gig then at 100mbit, but the difference is probably negligible in the big picture
2016-10-18 03:59:47	UncleDrax	it would improve the latency on that particular physical link between you and your ISPs equipment. but you're talking like a couple nanoseconds at best. which is irrelevent for most uses

2016-10-18 05:46:51	@daemonkeeper	Sure one only takes 5V, but you need a transformer from your normal voltage and that is not that efficient.

2016-10-18 07:27:49	jxer	would u want your controller inthe cloud
2016-10-18 07:27:52	Milotop	well squeeb, we've trained ourselves with samsung and mikrotik, so we're probably not gonna consider ubnt
2016-10-18 07:28:03	Milotop	also jxer makes a valid point tbh
2016-10-18 07:28:03	jxer	thus requring a solid internet connection just to manage your network
2016-10-18 07:28:06	jxer	i think thats nuts
2016-10-18 07:28:10	squeeb	jxer: ask meraki ?
2016-10-18 07:28:20	jxer	i think cloud has its place
2016-10-18 07:28:24	jxer	this is not one of them
2016-10-18 07:28:25	squeeb	actually no, if the controller goes offline, the APs keep running
2016-10-18 07:28:29	jxer	yet
2016-10-18 07:28:32	jxer	u can't manage it
2016-10-18 07:28:34	jxer	or make changes
2016-10-18 07:28:40	squeeb	jxer: Meraki are doing this now
2016-10-18 07:28:42	jxer	keep the controller onsite
2016-10-18 07:28:44	squeeb	and they're lolrich
2016-10-18 07:28:50	jxer	yea
2016-10-18 07:28:59	jxer	cus the "cloud" is the friggin answer to everything
2016-10-18 07:29:04	Milotop	everyone who sells DUH CLOUD is lolrich because it's the most recent buzzword in IT
2016-10-18 07:29:10	Milotop	everyone throws down cash if they even hear it
2016-10-18 07:29:12	squeeb	Yea it's diagonally scalable in the cloud
2016-10-18 07:29:14	jxer	pretty much
2016-10-18 07:29:16	jxer	scales
2016-10-18 07:29:20	jxer	its amazing
2016-10-18 07:29:31	djph	there can be arguments made for both a local (on-site) and "cloud" (i.e. "in your office a mile away") installations of the controller
2016-10-18 07:29:32	jxer	it will even suck your dick if you pay for the platinum package

2016-10-18 12:13:19	Dagger	you can arrange for v6 addresses to be about 64 bits (with the remaining bits set to zero), which is pretty similar to the two 32-bit addresses you end up with on NATed v4
