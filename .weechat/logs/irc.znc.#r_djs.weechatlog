2016-09-15 22:08:11	alyptik	just more plugins and stuff
2016-09-15 22:09:05	strepto	I like simplicity.
2016-09-15 22:09:35	alyptik	heh no argument against it
2016-09-15 22:09:57	alyptik	i just started with weechat and stuck with it; one day i'll learn irssi too

2016-09-22 05:25:08	@djdementia	What Does Audio Compression Sound Like?
2016-09-22 05:26:05	@djdementia	it's pretty interesting, although i found this part better: https://youtu.be/DwpS7gOt554?t=2m32s
2016-09-22 05:26:36	@djdementia	he plays a wav file then compresses the file in different formats and shifts the phase between compressed and original
2016-09-22 05:26:56	@djdementia	which essentially means it'll cancel out any audio that is the same between uncompressed and compressed and only leave the 'difference' of what changed
2016-09-22 05:27:01	@djdementia	then you can listen to that 'difference'
2016-09-22 05:28:01	@djdementia	it's interesting how much is removed at high quality OGG Q10 which is practically transparent at 512Kbps, and look how much more is lost when you go to 320K MP3
2016-09-22 05:28:24	@djdementia	but... keep in mind that this is not taking into account the psycho-acoustic elements of compression algorhythms
2016-09-22 05:28:47	@djdementia	which is where stuff like AAC and OGG really shine, they use psycho acoustics to trick your brain into thinking that the missing audio is actually still there
2016-09-22 05:30:06	@djdementia	think of it like 3d goggles, they exploit some weaknesses in human sensory perception to give you the illusion that it is 3d when it is not. same is true for these compression algorithm

2016-09-26 21:42:12	@phusion	[17:27:30] those kinds of producers just cement my EDM philosophy, sorry, I don't want to hear guns cocking or loud screeching, the same 'ol fart bass we've been hearing since 2007 [17:27:30]

2016-09-26 21:42:12	@phusion	[17:29:05] I can compliment them on their production skills, but can't ever really enjoy their stuff anymore, I mean, The Originalz did a suh-weeet remix of King Crimson for fucks sake, how cool is that-- now just .. blech, trap crap [17:29:05]
2016-09-26 21:42:12	toastercookie	[17:29:32] heh [17:29:32]

2016-09-29 08:09:44	hellupmeeee	Hey guys, quick question here
2016-09-29 08:11:45	toastercookie	sup
2016-09-29 08:12:49	@phusion	sup hellupmeeee 
2016-09-29 08:16:35	hellupmeeee	I'm getting into DJ'ing and I found 2 controllers, the DDJ-SB2, and a b-stock version of it. Now the b-stock one has been returned by someone, but what I noticed in the ad is that one of them just says that it comes with Serato DJ and the other (b-stock verison) says Serato v29
2016-09-29 08:16:50	hellupmeeee	And the other b-stock versions have like v31 v32 etc and are more expensive
2016-09-29 08:17:11	hellupmeeee	Can I just update the software myself without a problem or is it better to get a new one for like 30 euros more
2016-09-29 08:17:42	@phusion	Serato is free usually
2016-09-29 08:17:53	@phusion	I have DJ + ITCH w/ my Vestax VCI300mk2
2016-09-29 08:18:04	@phusion	buuuut... not sure
2016-09-29 08:23:30	hellupmeeee	What's your opinion between the Traktor Kontrol S2 and the Pioneer DDJ-SB2
2016-09-29 08:23:43	hellupmeeee	The traktor looks nicer quality wise
2016-09-29 08:23:58	hellupmeeee	I'm trying to get into drum and bass mixing
2016-09-29 08:25:21	Tu13es	i don't know much specifically about the hardware, but probably the choice between traktor / serato is what matters more
2016-09-29 08:25:21		[08:25]
2016-09-29 08:25:43	Tu13es	that's basically what i did. play with both, see what you like, then find a controller that works with it
2016-09-29 08:26:30	@phusion	I avoid Traktor like the plague
2016-09-29 08:26:31	@phusion	but thats me
2016-09-29 08:27:27	Tu13es	likewise except for serato :P
2016-09-29 08:27:35	Tu13es	it's a personal choice really
2016-09-29 08:29:15	@phusion	yeah, if you just want to play your tracks then use Serato, if you want to get an engineering degree to do a pitch bend and a transition, use Traktor, personal choice :P
2016-09-29 08:29:26	hellupmeeee	lool
2016-09-29 08:29:34	@phusion	choose to get in your own way, or don't.
2016-09-29 08:29:46	@phusion	but yeah, among DJ's, this is kind of the Mac Vs PC debate

2016-09-29 08:31:37	@phusion	do that for 6-8 months or so and then start looking for a controller based on your needs
2016-09-29 08:31:39	hellupmeeee	HAHAHAH THAT TUNE that starts in that mix hahahaha
2016-09-29 08:31:51	@phusion	I used a Numark Totalcontrol for years, its a total piece of shit

2016-10-01 14:06:35	***	Buffer Playback...
2016-10-01 14:06:35	hellupmeeee	[18:23:43] The traktor looks nicer quality wise [18:23:43]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	hellupmeeee	[18:23:57] I'm trying to get into drum and bass mixing [18:23:57]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	Tu13es	[18:25:21] i don't know much specifically about the hardware, but probably the choice between traktor / serato is what matters more [18:25:21]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	Tu13es	[18:25:43] that's basically what i did. play with both, see what you like, then find a controller that works with it [18:25:43]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	@phusion	[18:26:29] I avoid Traktor like the plague [18:26:29]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	@phusion	[18:26:31] but thats me [18:26:31]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	Tu13es	[18:27:27] likewise except for serato :P [18:27:27]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	Tu13es	[18:27:35] it's a personal choice really [18:27:35]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	@phusion	[18:29:14] yeah, if you just want to play your tracks then use Serato, if you want to get an engineering degree to do a pitch bend and a transition, use Traktor, personal choice :P [18:29:14]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	hellupmeeee	[18:29:26] lool [18:29:26]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	@phusion	[18:29:34] choose to get in your own way, or don't. [18:29:34]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	@phusion	[18:29:46] but yeah, among DJ's, this is kind of the Mac Vs PC debate [18:29:46]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	@phusion	[18:30:02] what do you spin hellupmeeee ? [18:30:02]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	toastercookie	[18:30:14] "if you want to get an engineering degree to do a pitch bend and a transition" [18:30:14]

2016-10-01 14:06:35	hellupmeeee	[18:30:30] I tried it for 20 minutes before and I loved it [18:30:30]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	@phusion	[18:30:31] yeah, you need a physics degree too [18:30:31]

2016-10-01 14:06:35	@phusion	[18:31:10] well, you should get a really basic controller [18:31:10]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	@phusion	[18:31:26] pick Serato/traktor (serato) and just.. start making mixes [18:31:26]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	@phusion	[18:31:36] do that for 6-8 months or so and then start looking for a controller based on your needs [18:31:36]

2016-10-03 04:53:22	hellupmeeee	[18:23:43] The traktor looks nicer quality wise [18:23:43]
2016-10-03 04:53:22	hellupmeeee	[18:23:57] I'm trying to get into drum and bass mixing [18:23:57]
2016-10-03 04:53:22	Tu13es	[18:25:21] i don't know much specifically about the hardware, but probably the choice between traktor / serato is what matters more [18:25:21]
2016-10-03 04:53:22	Tu13es	[18:25:43] that's basically what i did. play with both, see what you like, then find a controller that works with it [18:25:43]
2016-10-03 04:53:22	@phusion	[18:26:29] I avoid Traktor like the plague [18:26:29]
2016-10-03 04:53:22	@phusion	[18:26:31] but thats me [18:26:31]
2016-10-03 04:53:22	Tu13es	[18:27:27] likewise except for serato :P [18:27:27]
2016-10-03 04:53:22	Tu13es	[18:27:35] it's a personal choice really [18:27:35]
2016-10-03 04:53:22	@phusion	[18:29:14] yeah, if you just want to play your tracks then use Serato, if you want to get an engineering degree to do a pitch bend and a transition, use Traktor, personal choice :P [18:29:14]
2016-10-03 04:53:22	hellupmeeee	[18:29:26] lool [18:29:26]

2016-10-03 04:53:22	@phusion	[18:29:46] but yeah, among DJ's, this is kind of the Mac Vs PC debate [18:29:46]

2016-10-05 23:26:13	@phusion	[18:26:29] I avoid Traktor like the plague [18:26:29]
2016-10-05 23:26:13	@phusion	[18:26:31] but thats me [18:26:31]
2016-10-05 23:26:13	Tu13es	[18:27:27] likewise except for serato :P [18:27:27]
2016-10-05 23:26:13	Tu13es	[18:27:35] it's a personal choice really [18:27:35]
2016-10-05 23:26:13	@phusion	[18:29:14] yeah, if you just want to play your tracks then use Serato, if you want to get an engineering degree to do a pitch bend and a transition, use Traktor, personal choice :P [18:29:14]
2016-10-05 23:26:13	hellupmeeee	[18:29:26] lool [18:29:26]

2016-10-08 10:44:42	snowdusk	i cant make up my mind -- serato dj or rekordbox dj. rekordbox dj has improved a lot lately now i am tempted to move to rekordbox dj. if i do it will be nice because i have both controller and cdjs
2016-10-08 10:45:01	snowdusk	but then i got too comfy with serato dj
