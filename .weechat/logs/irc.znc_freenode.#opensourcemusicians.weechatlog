2016-10-17 13:34:59	holstein	when it does, its *very* safe, lucrative projects..
2016-10-17 13:35:07	holstein	if you want to make art, just keep at it :)
2016-10-17 13:35:23	holstein	if you want to be popular, just pull up youtube, and emulate the first music you see in the top hits..

2016-10-17 14:19:57	holstein	i like carl sagan..
2016-10-17 14:20:35	holstein	not sure that adds up for me, though.. its likely cut, for someone's agenda..
2016-10-17 14:21:53	holstein	yeah, i think the way it was *actually* said, was. "it *deserves* to be destroyed by the truth"
2016-10-17 14:22:04	holstein	thats a bit different, than the command that is "must" be..
2016-10-17 14:22:46	holstein	much more evocative.. i think.. to think that, because something can have truth tear it down, that it *deserves* to be torn down..

2016-10-17 14:23:06	holstein	"it must be" is more like some call to action in a cult
2016-10-17 14:23:28	holstein	like "we must destroy this with our truth.." which, is not what thats about, at all..

2016-10-17 14:33:51	holstein	regardless.. i find it an important distinction.. "deserves" vs "it must be"
2016-10-17 14:35:02	holstein	i like this resource http://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/03/13/destroy/

2016-10-17 14:35:35	holstein	even “That which can be destroyed by the truth should be,”.. thats still preferable, to me, to the call to action..

2016-10-17 14:38:17	holstein	since, it seems, Sagan was actually just quoting that, in his documentary..
2016-10-17 14:38:32	holstein	klopsi-u3: not that pushing an agenda, requires facts, or research ;)
2016-10-17 14:40:36	holstein	its prolly better, in that case, to go with the wording of the quote that best fits the agenda,. and hope no one checks on it..
