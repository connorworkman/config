2016-10-17 14:21:53	holstein	yeah, i think the way it was *actually* said, was. "it *deserves* to be destroyed by the truth"
2016-10-17 14:22:04	holstein	thats a bit different, than the command that is "must" be..
2016-10-17 14:22:46	holstein	much more evocative.. i think.. to think that, because something can have truth tear it down, that it *deserves* to be torn down..

2016-10-17 16:45:26	holstein	she stated that, in the debate..
2016-10-17 16:45:44	Stuzz	I see no harm when there's no other talk in here (unless there's new folks being scared away).
2016-10-17 16:46:07	holstein	id rather see it go to a politics channel
2016-10-17 16:46:23	holstein	since, it can be quite divisive, and
2016-10-17 16:46:23		[16:46]
2016-10-17 16:46:49	holstein	there are those places here, that i want folks to have access to.. i mean, thats why we support freenode.. so *anyone* can talk about whatever they want
2016-10-17 16:47:10	holstein	but, i can /ignore.. and thats fine.. occasionally, i just get caught up in the irony, and cant help it
2016-10-17 16:47:44	holstein	i mean, i literally heard her state that, first hand, in the debate.. for example. we dont really need a wiki leaks entry about that. since, she just said it, first hand ;)

2016-10-17 16:53:25	holstein	nah
2016-10-17 16:53:35	holstein	i mean, i watched them..
2016-10-17 16:53:46	holstein	but, i think folks are pretty much set...
2016-10-17 16:53:56	holstein	i think, its more of a ratings grab, these days
2016-10-17 16:54:17	holstein	its more of a random show, like some reality TV thing.. where, its allowed to get "off the rails"..
2016-10-17 16:54:43	holstein	thats entertaining, rather than,  facilitating a "good" debate..
2016-10-17 16:55:24	Stuzz	Was it hosted by Jerry Springer?
2016-10-17 16:55:32	holstein	i know, right?!

2016-10-17 16:55:42	holstein	the last one was just allowed to be such a mess
2016-10-17 16:55:51	Stuzz	I didn't watch 'em
2016-10-17 16:55:58	holstein	you just stop the debate. its easy
2016-10-17 16:56:06	holstein	"we are going to stop if you talk over each other"
2016-10-17 16:56:09	holstein	and you stop that shit
2016-10-17 16:56:10	Stuzz	I actually closed my IRC client 'cause I didn't want to even see anything about it
2016-10-17 16:56:43	Stuzz	I know I can't affect anything related to it, so it simply has no worth for me
2016-10-17 16:56:55	holstein	and we say, to the US public.. "the debates stopped because the adults we have chosen as candidates couldnt communicate respectfully within the parameters of the debate"
2016-10-17 16:57:29	holstein	yeah.. and, im not sure i can affect anything about it.. but, id like to talk about how to constructively do so...
2016-10-17 16:57:42	Stuzz	Well...  you can vote
2016-10-17 16:57:50	holstein	what would it take to elect a 3rd party candidate?
2016-10-17 16:58:08	holstein	how do we stop this "career politician" problem?
2016-10-17 16:58:22	holstein	its supposed to be *representatives* of us.. the fucking actual people
2016-10-17 16:58:30	holstein	if it were? it wouldnt be as much of a problem for sure
2016-10-17 16:58:46	holstein	there would be skin in the game, so to speak
2016-10-17 16:59:01	holstein	im actually not a conspiracy theorist. i think this is just people, doing things people do..
2016-10-17 16:59:07	Stuzz	Representatives, as selected by who?
2016-10-17 16:59:23	holstein	they are out of touch, and greedy, and busy... and not realistic representatives of us
2016-10-17 16:59:36	Stuzz	As far as I can tell, the system doesn't really work as it is.  But, I don't have another one.
2016-10-17 16:59:40	holstein	Stuzz: it was intended to be normal folks, rotating in..
2016-10-17 16:59:53	Stuzz	But I really don't know much 'bout politics (or anything) at all
2016-10-17 16:59:59	holstein	Stuzz: yup. but, the system? as it is? is not really implemented 100% as intended
2016-10-17 17:00:14	Stuzz	No?
2016-10-17 17:00:17	holstein	i think, if one couldnt make a career of this, that would be a good start

2016-10-17 17:01:36	holstein	its a mess, all the way up to the presidential canidates, though.. where, they are chosen more for who can when the popularity contest.. or who knows..

2016-10-17 17:02:13	holstein	again.. i agree with you Stuzz.. i dont have a "better" solution, necessarily.. but, i do think this simple thing would be a nice start.. and address this corporate greed
2016-10-17 17:02:26	Stuzz	Do y'all have city/state elections too?
2016-10-17 17:02:56	holstein	if it were just normal folks? taking 6 month turns? saying "oh shit, i have to go back and live in that town.. im not going to make that bad decision, just because it helps me in this career path to senate" or whatever

2016-10-17 17:04:54	holstein	Stuzz: yeah. i wonder about that..
2016-10-17 17:05:05	holstein	like, do they just invest well ;)
2016-10-17 17:06:00	Stuzz	I got no problem with 'em getting paid well while there, but the golden handshake on the way out isn't suitable
2016-10-17 17:06:12	Stuzz	They should probably get paid more, tbh
2016-10-17 17:06:21	Stuzz	(while actually in the job)
2016-10-17 17:07:12	Stuzz	Certainly now shortage of folks who make more than a country's rep

2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[02:59:53] But I really don't know much 'bout politics (or anything) at all [02:59:53]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[02:59:59] Stuzz: yup. but, the system? as it is? is not really implemented 100% as intended [02:59:59]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:00:14] No? [03:00:14]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:00:17] i think, if one couldnt make a career of this, that would be a good start [03:00:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:00:43] right. its literally the term.. representatives.. delegates.. but, they are not really normal folks.. [03:00:43]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:01:07] it should be, we *all* take a turn there.. and, then, the collective has more say. [03:01:07]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:01:36] its a mess, all the way up to the presidential canidates, though.. where, they are chosen more for who can when the popularity contest.. or who knows.. [03:01:36]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:02:13] again.. i agree with you Stuzz.. i dont have a "better" solution, necessarily.. but, i do think this simple thing would be a nice start.. and address this corporate greed [03:02:13]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:02:26] Do y'all have city/state elections too? [03:02:26]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:02:55] if it were just normal folks? taking 6 month turns? saying "oh shit, i have to go back and live in that town.. im not going to make that bad decision, just because it helps me in this career path to senate" or whatever [03:02:55]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:03:15] Stuzz: yup. local elections.. [03:03:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:03:22] k [03:03:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:03:50] What's Obama get to do afterwards? [03:03:50]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:03:58] who knows.. [03:03:58]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:04:04] relax, im sure.. [03:04:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:04:14] he looks like he's aged like 20 years.. [03:04:14]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:04:32] All polititians 'round here seem to get paid even after they're out [03:04:32]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:04:44] prolly can write books, and do what he likes.. [03:04:44]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:04:54] They certainly don't go hungry at least [03:04:54]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:04:54] Stuzz: yeah. i wonder about that.. [03:04:54]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:05:05] like, do they just invest well ;) [03:05:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:06:00] I got no problem with 'em getting paid well while there, but the golden handshake on the way out isn't suitable [03:06:00]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:06:12] They should probably get paid more, tbh [03:06:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:06:21] (while actually in the job) [03:06:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:07:12] Certainly now shortage of folks who make more than a country's rep [03:07:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:07:21] yeah.. who knows [03:07:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:07:25] im sure its a tough gig.. [03:07:25]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:07:36] Well..  I wouldn't want it [03:07:36]

2016-10-18 11:14:54	canseco	I usually launch QjackCtl before, as it uses JACK to work, but it's more easy if you use a distro ready to work out of the box
2016-10-18 11:15:03	canseco	like KXStudio or AVLinux

2016-10-18 11:22:09	canseco	Hi jpt9
2016-10-18 11:22:26	 *	jpt9 just made a thing with a recording he had lying around:
2016-10-18 11:22:28	jpt9	https://soundcloud.com/jptuttle/radiophonic-sketch-3-composition-for-spatula-cutting-board-and-daw
2016-10-18 11:22:47	jpt9	Okay, so I didn't really plan it out in advance, so I'm not sure how "composed" I'd consider it.
2016-10-18 11:22:50	jpt9	But it was fun.

2016-10-18 11:54:07	catbadger	any qtractor ninjas in here?
2016-10-18 11:56:49	rncbc	catbadger: ninjas?
2016-10-18 11:56:49		[11:56]
2016-10-18 11:57:52	catbadger	I'm looking for advice. What's the learning curve like for qtractor?
2016-10-18 11:59:10	catbadger	rncbc ninjas are power-users
2016-10-18 11:59:11	rncbc	catbadger: though question imho the curve is perfectly plain ;)
2016-10-18 11:59:26	catbadger	compared to say lmms?
2016-10-18 11:59:30	catbadger	or fruityloops?
2016-10-18 12:00:49	rncbc	catbadger: maybe comparing oranges with apples; though, lmms is a fl wannabe
2016-10-18 12:01:22	catbadger	fl is great, lmms is limited in what it can achieve without vocal tracking
2016-10-18 12:01:29	catbadger	hmm
2016-10-18 12:01:38	catbadger	I liked lmms due to it's amaxing ui
2016-10-18 12:01:55	rncbc	catbadger: maybe you wanna lokk at the wiki -> http://sourceforge.net/p/qtractor/wiki/
2016-10-18 12:02:03	catbadger	thank you
2016-10-18 12:02:06	rncbc	look*

2016-10-18 23:55:24	canseco	[21:21:42] Your welcome [21:21:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	canseco	[21:22:09] Hi jpt9 [21:22:09]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	 *	jpt9 [21:22:26] just made a thing with a recording he had lying around: [21:22:26]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	jpt9	[21:22:28] https://soundcloud.com/jptuttle/radiophonic-sketch-3-composition-for-spatula-cutting-board-and-daw [21:22:28]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	jpt9	[21:22:47] Okay, so I didn't really plan it out in advance, so I'm not sure how "composed" I'd consider it. [21:22:47]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	jpt9	[21:22:50] But it was fun. [21:22:50]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[21:54:07] any qtractor ninjas in here? [21:54:07]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	rncbc	[21:56:49] catbadger: ninjas? [21:56:49]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[21:57:52] I'm looking for advice. What's the learning curve like for qtractor? [21:57:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[21:59:10] rncbc ninjas are power-users [21:59:10]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	rncbc	[21:59:11] catbadger: though question imho the curve is perfectly plain ;) [21:59:11]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[21:59:26] compared to say lmms? [21:59:26]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[21:59:30] or fruityloops? [21:59:30]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	rncbc	[22:00:49] catbadger: maybe comparing oranges with apples; though, lmms is a fl wannabe [22:00:49]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[22:01:22] fl is great, lmms is limited in what it can achieve without vocal tracking [22:01:22]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[22:01:29] hmm [22:01:29]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[22:01:38] I liked lmms due to it's amaxing ui [22:01:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	rncbc	[22:01:55] catbadger: maybe you wanna lokk at the wiki -> http://sourceforge.net/p/qtractor/wiki/ [22:01:55]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[22:02:03] thank you [22:02:03]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	rncbc	[22:02:06] look* [22:02:06]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[22:02:09] i appreciate the discussion [22:02:09]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	rncbc	[22:02:48] catbadger: maybe im too deeply biased [22:02:48]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[22:08:55] maybe, but talking to someone who uses or has used it is very telling [22:08:55]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	rncbc	[22:21:38] catbadger: you're welcome but you have to note that im qtractor's author (sensei?) no other and that's why my telling is skewed :) [22:21:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[22:29:05] oh ic [22:29:05]

2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[21:57:52] I'm looking for advice. What's the learning curve like for qtractor? [21:57:52]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[21:59:10] rncbc ninjas are power-users [21:59:10]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	rncbc	[21:59:11] catbadger: though question imho the curve is perfectly plain ;) [21:59:11]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[21:59:26] compared to say lmms? [21:59:26]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[21:59:30] or fruityloops? [21:59:30]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	rncbc	[22:00:49] catbadger: maybe comparing oranges with apples; though, lmms is a fl wannabe [22:00:49]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[22:01:22] fl is great, lmms is limited in what it can achieve without vocal tracking [22:01:22]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[22:01:29] hmm [22:01:29]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[22:01:38] I liked lmms due to it's amaxing ui [22:01:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	rncbc	[22:01:55] catbadger: maybe you wanna lokk at the wiki -> http://sourceforge.net/p/qtractor/wiki/ [22:01:55]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[22:02:03] thank you [22:02:03]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	rncbc	[22:02:06] look* [22:02:06]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[22:02:09] i appreciate the discussion [22:02:09]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	rncbc	[22:02:48] catbadger: maybe im too deeply biased [22:02:48]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[22:08:55] maybe, but talking to someone who uses or has used it is very telling [22:08:55]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	rncbc	[22:21:38] catbadger: you're welcome but you have to note that im qtractor's author (sensei?) no other and that's why my telling is skewed :) [22:21:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[22:29:05] oh ic [22:29:05]

2016-10-19 02:40:04	gcrk1	klopsi-u3: i think the first part is too long, there is some melodie or something missing, or maybe you should insert a b-part with another bass-line and drums? after 2:30 or something i like the song, pretty repitive and simple (which is great) and i like the sounds

2016-10-19 04:33:14	leebre	i havent smoked for some days, i am nervous, otherwise i would contribute today...next time for sure
2016-10-19 04:33:40	holstein	i havent smoked for like 6 years, and im still nervous ;)
2016-10-19 04:34:30	leebre	hi holstein
2016-10-19 04:34:42	holstein	o/
2016-10-19 04:35:05	leebre	just playing with carla
2016-10-19 04:35:05	gcrk	leebre: is your message connected to my question?
2016-10-19 04:35:19	leebre	which question ?
2016-10-19 04:35:26	gcrk	hehe :D
2016-10-19 04:35:35	gcrk	well, i got a lot of xruns and dont know why
2016-10-19 04:35:50	leebre	look, xruns are the same on any system
2016-10-19 04:35:50	gcrk	yesterday everything worked perfect but today is something different
2016-10-19 04:36:03	holstein	gcrk: can you mitigate them my relaxing your settings?
2016-10-19 04:36:06	leebre	it means that something is disturbing your audio realtime performance
2016-10-19 04:36:39	holstein	lets see.. things that can "just change" randomly, between boots.. the audio device can do that..
2016-10-19 04:36:39	gcrk	holstein: a little but still a lot. about 30 a second
2016-10-19 04:37:17	leebre	as holstein explained to me, and others too, you have to try to isolate the problem and find out what exactly is producing the xruns
2016-10-19 04:37:17	holstein	you may think you are on the same device, but, be running jack on a different one
2016-10-19 04:37:17	gcrk	okay, got this. how do i do this?
2016-10-19 04:37:17	holstein	you could have done an update.. or, booted into a different kernel..
2016-10-19 04:37:21	leebre	though, takin linux av live from usb would be a way to test if your hardware is sane and fully supported by linux kernel
2016-10-19 04:37:26	gcrk	i have done an update
2016-10-19 04:41:17	holstein	right.. so, as the mechanics say "there's your problem"
2016-10-19 04:41:17		[04:41]
2016-10-19 04:41:18	holstein	you just play detective on what you say is happening.. "everything was find, and now, something id different"..
2016-10-19 04:41:18	holstein	me? since, i keep my older kernels, as "known good" states, i would simply reboot into the last kernel that worked, if i took a kernel update
2016-10-19 04:41:18	leebre	yes
2016-10-19 04:41:18	gcrk	good idea
2016-10-19 04:41:18	leebre	and normally, all other kernels, specially in the debian and ubuntu domain stay bootable in the bootloaders menu
2016-10-19 04:41:18	gcrk	maybe i should at first figure out what packages updated...
2016-10-19 04:41:18	gcrk	i am on arch
2016-10-19 04:41:18	holstein	for me, a "better" trick is, looking at *if* i need an update,*before* i take the update
2016-10-19 04:41:18	leebre	arch is different, i am only havin the latest kernel, and if i am having luck i can go to testing and get the kernel from tomorrow
2016-10-19 04:41:18	gcrk	i thought there may be a log where i can see what causes the xruns to have a more specific idea of what happens
2016-10-19 04:41:18	holstein	but, im audio production machine is *intentionally* *not* online.. so, i do not need to maintain any updates
2016-10-19 04:41:18	leebre	holstein, i really cant say if i am needing an update or not
2016-10-19 04:41:19	leebre	though i have one machine, that is connected to the net, which i am consantly updating everday
2016-10-19 04:41:19	holstein	leebre: sure you can.. *is* the machine online? if it is, then, you will want to facilitate security updates
2016-10-19 04:41:19	leebre	yes
2016-10-19 04:41:19	leebre	my daw machine, i am following your advices
2016-10-19 04:41:19	holstein	i dont need/want updates to my audio software
2016-10-19 04:41:19	gcrk	well, the update is a good idea to investigate, i will do this and maybe ask again later for more help. thank you leebre and holstein
2016-10-19 04:41:21	holstein	i dont get any benefit from those updates, since, i dont need/want any new featurs
2016-10-19 04:41:25	leebre	no unneccessary changes to the system that could "worsen" things to
2016-10-19 04:41:44	gcrk	well, i do a lot of other stuff with this pc so i am happy of everything is up to date
2016-10-19 04:41:58	gcrk	*if
2016-10-19 04:42:10	holstein	gcrk: lol. its actually this lack of happiness, currently, that we are discussing
2016-10-19 04:42:12	leebre	holstein, i cannot say sometimey if those updates are for any value for me, its all too complex...
2016-10-19 04:42:26	holstein	anyways.. some cant, for whatever reason, have a dedicated production environment.. which is fine
2016-10-19 04:42:33	leebre	i am waiting for jack1 0.1.2.5 - here , i know what i am waiting for,...jack alsa midi bridge
2016-10-19 04:42:37	holstein	but, updates can break things.. thats just the nature of the biz
2016-10-19 04:42:50	leebre	sure
2016-10-19 04:42:52	leebre	but
2016-10-19 04:42:57	leebre	same coin
2016-10-19 04:43:06	holstein	one can have a separate installation.. and dual boot..
2016-10-19 04:43:08	leebre	other side...update can magically heal bugs sometimes
2016-10-19 04:43:20	holstein	well.. fun fact? this is not addressing bugs
2016-10-19 04:43:28	holstein	its more about staying in a "wanted" state
2016-10-19 04:43:35	leebre	and we all want spontanous wonder healings, aren't we ?
2016-10-19 04:43:38	gcrk	holstein: dual boot is maybe a thing i should consider for my audio stuff
2016-10-19 04:44:02	holstein	like this.. "my thing is working.. i want to keep the thing in this state, and dont get any benefit from updating".. so it can be kept in that state
2016-10-19 04:44:04	leebre	dual boot is fine
2016-10-19 04:44:18	holstein	if one needs a fix? then, one can apply that fix..
2016-10-19 04:44:24	leebre	seperate hard disk would be best for that, no hassle with partitions then
2016-10-19 04:44:24	holstein	bugs are just another part of the biz
2016-10-19 04:44:57	holstein	gcrk: for me, its worth the hassle.. i can have, for example, separate setups, that can facilitate different needs.. per install
2016-10-19 04:45:13	holstein	whats good for my production setup, may not be great for my "daily" install
2016-10-19 04:45:51	holstein	this has been a lot less hassle, for me, than, checking after some updates, and playing detective on what is broken
2016-10-19 04:45:54	gcrk	holstein: yes, this seems to be my problem here. some updates just break things but there are reason why i need them

2016-10-19 04:46:03	leebre	when you are thinking bout dual boot for havin one system at frozen state, you might could think of a DAW container solution featuring docker
2016-10-19 04:46:11	holstein	gcrk: sure.. but, not likely with your audio production needs..
2016-10-19 04:46:21	holstein	gcrk: you may actually just *need* it to work, and be the same as it was yesterday..
2016-10-19 04:46:39	holstein	thats what i need, and prefer.. when i need the updates, its on a more "desktop" oriented setup
2016-10-19 04:46:42	gcrk	holstein: yes, great input, thank you!
2016-10-19 04:46:45	leebre	thats the problem with an open free world full of free open alternatives, one have to get a free clean mind to be able to make the right choice, ithink
2016-10-19 04:46:58	gcrk	leebre: DAW container?
2016-10-19 04:47:00	leebre	my poor thougs
2016-10-19 04:47:35	gcrk	leebre: never worked with docker, seems to be a lot of learning for this, isnt it?
2016-10-19 04:47:37	holstein	when i *was* running a production environment that i updated? i *literally* mirrored that setup, on a laptop.. before applying the updates to the main production machine? i would apply them on the laptop, and test the updated system with my audio hardware..
2016-10-19 04:47:41	leebre	c container....read about docker if youare interrested in having such a solution, i cannot explainbit as well as wiki or google can because docker is not a viretual machine, its a cgourps contaainber i think
2016-10-19 04:47:55	leebre	docker i guess is easy , but i havent tried it yet
2016-10-19 04:48:08	holstein	that worked *great*, until, an update was specifically problematic with hardware that was on the main machine, and not on the laptop
2016-10-19 04:48:34	gcrk	leebre: i will also investigate with that, thanks
2016-10-19 04:48:38	holstein	containerization is *great*, as well.. but, not likely to help us with our audio production environments

2016-10-19 04:48:58	holstein	there is more to the stack.. the kernel interacting with the hardware drivers
2016-10-19 04:49:01	gcrk	when i choose to have a second system i could consider av linux, which may be the right thing for audio :x
2016-10-19 04:49:08	holstein	that breaks, on the host, and cannot be virtualized..
2016-10-19 04:49:14	leebre	okay
2016-10-19 04:49:17	leebre	was just a thought
2016-10-19 04:49:28	holstein	if the DAW is in a container, thats great for the DAW.. but, not specifically going to address *all* potential breakage
2016-10-19 04:49:29	leebre	as i said, all complicado, no comprendre
2016-10-19 04:50:15	JazzyEagle	look at the German speaking Spanish in an English channel!!  Very multicultural!!  hehe
2016-10-19 04:50:39	leebre	hehehe

2016-10-19 04:51:41	 *	JazzyEagle is learning German using an app called DuoLingo
2016-10-19 04:51:43	gcrk	yeah anyway, got some input, i will look what i can do and i guess there will be a good solution ;)
2016-10-19 04:51:47	JazzyEagle	Currently, it says I'm 28% fluent.  :)
2016-10-19 04:51:47	leebre	i start learning now to speack dutch a lil
2016-10-19 04:51:49	gcrk	DuoLingo is so great
2016-10-19 04:51:55	gcrk	i love it

2016-10-19 04:52:01	leebre	i need to learnfaster languages
2016-10-19 04:52:08	pifie	I know several people using DuoLingo
2016-10-19 04:52:26	gcrk	JazzyEagle: wanna proof it?
2016-10-19 04:52:27	gcrk	;)
2016-10-19 04:52:28	JazzyEagle	gcrk: We could be friends on there, if you're cool with it.  :)
2016-10-19 04:52:32	JazzyEagle	Proof what?
2016-10-19 04:52:37	pifie	but...
2016-10-19 04:52:43	pifie	Duoling is.... THE DEVIL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbmXSR_QiP8
2016-10-19 04:53:07	holstein	i was introduced to this "appliance" like nature of my audio production environment, when checking out AVlinux
2016-10-19 04:53:07	gcrk	JazzyEagle: pm ;)
2016-10-19 04:53:41	pifie	I'm blasting progressive trance music at work
2016-10-19 04:53:53	holstein	this was the basic philosophy of that distro.. not that im saying its "good" or "better" than any other.. just that, when i thought about it, i *did* prefer a "stable" appliance setup, rather than something rolling..
2016-10-19 04:53:54	pifie	I don't know if it's appropiate
2016-10-19 04:54:04	holstein	hehe
2016-10-19 04:54:10	pifie	Rupert Sheldrake phrases blasting in a physics department... slightly odd
2016-10-19 04:54:13	holstein	sometimes, i have to leave spaces like that.. when folks are playing music
2016-10-19 04:54:19	holstein	i just cant ignore it, and get anything done..
2016-10-19 04:54:36	pifie	holstein: this music is quite easy to work with
2016-10-19 04:54:40	holstein	some, like to listen to music passively, like that. and i get that.. but, for me, id rather it just be quiet..
2016-10-19 04:54:49	pifie	stable beat, not much chord changes, mostly tonal
2016-10-19 04:54:57	holstein	yup.. im sure it is. but, for me? *any* listening, passively, like that.. is not good
2016-10-19 04:55:00	pifie	if it was quiet, the sound of the pcs would trump over the rest
2016-10-19 04:55:04	holstein	i dont want to have "music to ignore" going on..
2016-10-19 04:55:19	pifie	there are people that earn a living out of making ignorable music
2016-10-19 04:55:19	holstein	i like the hum, in some cases.. but, hell.. thats why we have headphones :)
2016-10-19 04:55:28	pifie	Oh
2016-10-19 04:55:35	holstein	yup.. but, i just choose *not* to listen to ignorable music
2016-10-19 04:55:35	pifie	By the way, do any of you know about Lemon Demon?
2016-10-19 04:55:54	holstein	for me? its a training in passively listening.. and i cant afford to train myself to lose focus like that
2016-10-19 04:56:15	holstein	i try my best to make every note, in or out, matter :)
2016-10-19 04:56:16	pifie	A sort of funny band by Neil Cicierega.... it has some nice chord changes and all
2016-10-19 04:56:32	holstein	but, i get that folks like to have some music playing, while working..
2016-10-19 04:56:32		[04:56]
2016-10-19 04:56:39	holstein	i just have to keep earplugs handy :)
2016-10-19 04:57:10	pifie	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LeSFBy2bZU&t=50m15s <- a very Devo inspired album, I recommend it
2016-10-19 04:57:17	pifie	Got some earworms from that album this week
2016-10-19 04:57:22	holstein	nice..
2016-10-19 04:57:37	pifie	And funny earworms, like singing
2016-10-19 04:57:45	pifie	"As your father I expressly forbid it!"
2016-10-19 04:57:54	holstein	pifie: did you get into "hitrecord.org"?
2016-10-19 04:58:04	pifie	I did sign in but not much else

2016-10-19 05:43:19	leebre	it totally sucks
2016-10-19 05:43:21	leebre	really
2016-10-19 05:43:30	leebre	because we all know, it does not exist
2016-10-19 05:43:30	holstein	in most art, its the *imperfections* that folks prefer, and gravitate to

2016-10-19 05:44:07	holstein	but, is that "good" art? likely not
2016-10-19 05:44:14	holstein	nah.. fuck perfect
2016-10-19 05:44:15	leebre	exactly
2016-10-19 05:44:26	leebre	i tried to get the perfect sound while usingsoftware
2016-10-19 05:44:31	leebre	but i want to do it by hand
2016-10-19 05:44:35	leebre	like a bassdrum
2016-10-19 05:44:47	holstein	im human.. making mistakes? and working with my "imperfections"? to make something *better* than what is perfect? thats what im capable of, as a human
2016-10-19 05:44:58	leebre	its a sub and kick... and a low pass and a high cute, and maybe a compressor
2016-10-19 05:45:12	holstein	sure.. and, i think,when you stop thinking about it that way, you'll get further..
2016-10-19 05:45:21	leebre	i am livin in a constant loop, its a nightmare
2016-10-19 05:45:26	holstein	there is no "kick drum" model, in a vaccum, somewhere, that is the "perfect" one
2016-10-19 05:45:29	leebre	i am not getting paied for all the madness i am doin
2016-10-19 05:45:37	leebre	and it doesnt pay off anyways anykind
2016-10-19 05:45:37	holstein	theres just you, and your ears, and what you hear, and what you prefer to hear
2016-10-19 05:45:47	holstein	perfection is not really part of "sound"..
2016-10-19 05:46:02	leebre	here in nightmare nation, it is hehehe
2016-10-19 05:46:24	leebre	close to the lake of sorrow, near by the rivers of salty water
2016-10-19 05:46:30	holstein	discernment, is certainly a tricky thing to take on..
2016-10-19 05:46:56	holstein	for me, it helps to think of this, not as a shortcoming.. in my personal being
2016-10-19 05:47:04	leebre	i want a perfect sound, and because i am , me, some people are believing in me, which does not make it easier living lies
2016-10-19 05:47:32	leebre	i cant do nothing because i can do only perfect
2016-10-19 05:47:41	holstein	"im not getting the sound i want".. *great*.. thats either, an indication of how bad i am? or, its a chance for me to learn to.. *first* discern a few things.. the sound im getting, against the sound i want..
2016-10-19 05:47:51	holstein	"perfect" is just not a factor, here
2016-10-19 05:48:05	leebre	i have an excat idea of how the sound has to be
2016-10-19 05:48:11	leebre	very exact i guess
2016-10-19 05:48:17	holstein	*great*..
2016-10-19 05:48:23	leebre	feom 22 hz to 22 khz
2016-10-19 05:48:26	leebre	from
2016-10-19 05:48:28	holstein	so, you tweak what is needed, to get closer to that. *knowing* its not perfect
2016-10-19 05:48:48	holstein	and knowing, that the #'s you are spouting out? are relative to situational, and environmental variables
2016-10-19 05:48:52	leebre	i tweaked my whole life, enough tweaking, i need results now, and some butter on the bread
2016-10-19 05:49:09	holstein	well, in *many* cases? we just get close, and move on..
2016-10-19 05:49:15	leebre	i got thropwn back to the start
2016-10-19 05:49:22	holstein	again.. this doesnt have to be an indication of some shortcoming in our person
2016-10-19 05:49:31	holstein	its just a sound. you get close, and move on, and do better next time
2016-10-19 05:49:36	leebre	i need to work on bassdrums that are tonal
2016-10-19 05:49:50	leebre	everything must be perfect and tuned
2016-10-19 05:49:52	holstein	well, *you* are not working with *any* drums
2016-10-19 05:49:56	holstein	but, thats, beside the point
2016-10-19 05:50:26	holstein	actually spending some time? with an acoustic drum? in actual space? would likely be an educational experience for most, and a lesson in discernment..
2016-10-19 05:50:41	leebre	now i am at the point that iam not trusting the conversion software that converted all my samples to sfz...i have to check every sfz file by eye and edit by hand
2016-10-19 05:50:56	holstein	*great*!

2016-10-19 05:51:16	holstein	anyways. dont overthink it.. you have the  sound you have, and the sound you want..
2016-10-19 05:51:20	holstein	and, discernment
2016-10-19 05:51:24	leebre	i pleaed percusission with a group of people this weeken in amsterdam, was a great experience
2016-10-19 05:51:27	leebre	played
2016-10-19 05:51:28	holstein	no "perfect" models..
2016-10-19 05:51:44	leebre	really, it was fun
2016-10-19 05:51:48	holstein	sure.. so, you understand, then, that *every* person, in that performance space, has their own experience
2016-10-19 05:51:48	leebre	we melted to one group
2016-10-19 05:51:58	leebre	yes
2016-10-19 05:51:58	holstein	there is no "perfect" sound.. or tuning.. or whatever
2016-10-19 05:52:04	leebre	no
2016-10-19 05:52:07	holstein	its more about that group.. "melting" together..
2016-10-19 05:52:14	leebre	when doing music with others its a completly different thing
2016-10-19 05:52:15	catbadger	but there can be a perfect sound for a scenario
2016-10-19 05:52:19	holstein	nah
2016-10-19 05:52:24	holstein	i mean, there can be for *you*
2016-10-19 05:52:25	leebre	here, being together with others is what is al about, i think
2016-10-19 05:52:28	catbadger	or a perfect sound for a moment or feeling you are trying to evoke
2016-10-19 05:52:34	holstein	but, its relative.. its not "here is the only, and perfect sound"
2016-10-19 05:52:38	catbadger	yes
2016-10-19 05:52:43	catbadger	totally relative
2016-10-19 05:52:47	holstein	its *all* up to the individual, and discernment
2016-10-19 05:53:02	holstein	no *actual* physical state of perfection to attain
2016-10-19 05:53:17	leebre	perfection does not exist, freedom does not exists, time does not exist..probably...and even if it does, it wont change anything for you or me
2016-10-19 05:53:22	catbadger	anyone know how i can set up snd_seq in ubuntu?
2016-10-19 05:53:30	holstein	thats my only point.. we tend to, as humans, spend/waste a lot of resources getting to this state of being. that is not a thing, and is quite boring..
2016-10-19 05:54:02	holstein	catbadger: should be the same as debian, and most other linux's.. what are you trying to do?
2016-10-19 05:54:31	leebre	i am , as others describing me, i am intense, i did not knew the word before, and i dont know if i am, but everything feels quite tense
2016-10-19 05:54:50	holstein	leebre: cool.. maybe you can also try relaxing..
2016-10-19 05:54:50	catbadger	I am weak when it comes to linux sound arch, i usually produce from windows, so i'm not sure how to do this at all. qtractor says it's not installed or not started.
2016-10-19 05:54:53	holstein	if you find that helpful..
2016-10-19 05:55:07	holstein	if tension is helping you? and being intense is constructive? go for it
2016-10-19 05:55:14	holstein	processes are *so* individual..
2016-10-19 05:55:37	holstein	for me, i like to experiment, and re-think my processes.. to see if i can get anything different, or better..
2016-10-19 05:55:41	leebre	if a woman calls you intense, and all others are smiling and dont want to beintense maybe hehehedo not know for sure
2016-10-19 05:56:41	leebre	making music since more then 20 years, it feels all crazy...why am i doing it...fun, joy, curiosity, respect, hidden wishes to earn money one day, ....yearning for getting famous ?
2016-10-19 05:56:53	holstein	catbadger: when you say "qtractor says".. please elaborate.. when does what say what exactly? and what are you trying to facilitate?
2016-10-19 05:57:04	holstein	is this just a message? lots of messages are in linux os's
2016-10-19 05:57:04		[05:57]
2016-10-19 05:57:19	catbadger	The audio/MIDI engine could not be started. Make sure the JACK audio server (jackd) and/or the ALSA Sequencer kernel module (snd-seq-midi) are up and running and then restart the session
2016-10-19 05:57:26	holstein	there is no "linux" company, making sure the "nasty looking bits" are hidden.. we see *all* kinds of messages. that are not problematic..

2016-10-19 05:58:00	catbadger	haha yeah, lacking the sequencer plugin for a sequencer is pretty fatal though
2016-10-19 05:58:09	rncbc	catbadger: you need to have the ALSA MIDI Sequencer kernel module loaded alright
2016-10-19 05:58:12	holstein	catbadger: sure.. can you make sure it is? as in, your starting qtractor *could* be crashing jack..
2016-10-19 05:58:30	leebre	modprobe alsa_snd_seq
2016-10-19 05:58:32	holstein	also ^ what rncbc is saying

2016-10-19 06:01:51	rncbc	catbadger, holstein: there should be some system settings somewhere, that you set it one and forget for ever more :)
2016-10-19 06:01:52	catbadger	ok thanks
2016-10-19 06:02:00	catbadger	rncbc thanks
2016-10-19 06:02:07	holstein	likely, "just magically set" with ubuntustudio.. who knows..
2016-10-19 06:02:24	rncbc	holstein: obviously
2016-10-19 06:02:34	holstein	its *much* better than it once was.. there was a time, not too long ago, that, one had to re-build things in the ubuntu repos with "jack support"
2016-10-19 06:02:38	holstein	that was a PITA..
2016-10-19 06:02:54	leebre	loading modules is an essential and special feauture of the linux lkernel, the monolith kernel
2016-10-19 06:03:22	leebre	the good thing with linux is, we all want that every one is being able to work with opensource software
2016-10-19 06:04:05	leebre	three people just trying to hel you right now, do you have this with windows, too....that the developper of cubase tries to zhelp you in person to fix aour issues with the software ?

2016-10-19 06:05:12	holstein	or, just trust something else to facilitate this for you
2016-10-19 06:05:33	holstein	education, never hurts anything.. but, one can also learn just enough to be dangerous, so to speak
2016-10-19 06:05:57	leebre	mmm
2016-10-19 06:05:58	catbadger	I'm so happy you're all here to help
2016-10-19 06:05:59	catbadger	thank you
2016-10-19 06:06:08	holstein	i used to see folks ripping things like pulse audio out, and copy/pasting all kinds of things into ubuntustudio.. not really to "fix" anything, specifically, though
2016-10-19 06:06:19	leebre	surely not
2016-10-19 06:06:30	leebre	but this is part of a learning process, too, holstein
2016-10-19 06:06:37	holstein	sure.. but, learning about what?
2016-10-19 06:06:51	leebre	how hot the plate is...
2016-10-19 06:06:52	holstein	do i really need to learn just enough to be dangerous?
2016-10-19 06:07:08	holstein	or, is it better, if i just want to make art, to just go and trust someone else?
2016-10-19 06:07:09	catbadger	haha the plate is hot
2016-10-19 06:07:11	leebre	blisters are good for emotional growth

2016-10-19 06:13:29	holstein	i like to think of it like a server sys admin.. no doubt, that person? is tinkering. and installing, and building.. and playing with software. learning. professional development
2016-10-19 06:13:32	leebre	and as an artist i want controll, as much as possible
2016-10-19 06:13:52	holstein	i *guarantee* you, in production? they are not copy pasting "sudo" commands from wiki pages ;)
2016-10-19 06:14:02	leebre	sure not
2016-10-19 06:14:16	leebre	they are recording and producing but not configuring the machine
2016-10-19 06:14:42	holstein	this separation was key, for me.. since, i realized, *no* other entity was responsible for my support.. or giving it.. nor, preventing it.. and, i *need* a safe experimental environment..

2016-10-19 06:15:12	leebre	but i am a one man show, my sys admin does not exists, the support hotline for desperate OSM's doesn't exist neither
2016-10-19 06:15:14	holstein	"hey, whats that button do?".. is a great teacher.. and i like doing that, and learning that way
2016-10-19 06:15:25	holstein	but, not on my main production machine, or daily driver

2016-10-19 06:16:39	leebre	i went the wrong way, yes

2016-10-19 06:16:44	holstein	there are no "wrong" ways..
2016-10-19 06:16:50	holstein	just things that either help, or not
2016-10-19 06:17:22	leebre	you tried to imply many times to me, very gently and helpfully, tha I might took the wrong way, i think i am remebering ...
2016-10-19 06:17:44	leebre	or the wrong apporaches
2016-10-19 06:17:54	holstein	right. but, if you are getting where you need, thats all that matter

2016-10-19 06:20:06	holstein	maybe not

2016-10-19 06:22:08	leebre	every one must find out for themsleves
2016-10-19 06:22:09	holstein	they just released KDE 1.0 ;)
2016-10-19 06:22:16	holstein	is that a waste of time? i dont think so..
2016-10-19 06:22:23	leebre	linux tricks that are ten years old are probably not working for you, now...
2016-10-19 06:22:24	holstein	but, its an educational look into the past..

2016-10-19 06:23:34	leebre	the frequency of switching between happy and sad, between success and failure , this frquency is getting higher and its too stressfull for me
2016-10-19 06:23:49	holstein	yup
2016-10-19 06:23:56	holstein	if one can, *not* join these things together
2016-10-19 06:24:02	holstein	as in, success = happy
2016-10-19 06:24:11	leebre	today i called somewhere and wanted to know if i understood the way right...the way was 2 years of waiting to get maybe a medical diagnosis
2016-10-19 06:24:18	holstein	its challenging, for sure.. but, even the term success has so much relativity to it
2016-10-19 06:25:25	leebre	the woman was very friendly she said ,that till a certainpoint i understood it right, that she swallowed. took a deep breath and said, everything that i said was right, so, o have to wait 2 years at minimum to get diagnosed...this is livinin a rich country
2016-10-19 06:25:46	leebre	2 years, forget it
2016-10-19 06:25:47	catbadger	leebre what country?
2016-10-19 06:25:52	leebre	germany
2016-10-19 06:25:57	holstein	if i looked at, say, what "successful" artists are doing? and judged myself, against that metric? and then, additionally based my happiness on that outcome? that would be quite depressing ;)
2016-10-19 06:26:11	catbadger	holstein that's my boat
2016-10-19 06:26:19	catbadger	XD
2016-10-19 06:26:31	holstein	but, i need not hinge any of that on my happiness.. thats a separate thing
2016-10-19 06:26:43	leebre	i was waised this way, you want to eat, you need money, you want a woman, you need a job, want  a family, you need a good job ...
2016-10-19 06:26:47	leebre	raised
2016-10-19 06:27:06	holstein	when you think about ,maybe the more happy humans you see, i think you'll find, they are not really dealing with any of these things, to get happy
2016-10-19 06:27:12	leebre	you want to earnmoney with music, try your best
2016-10-19 06:27:17	catbadger	yes. I'm happy about a lot of things.my family makes me proud. I love my wife... but I crave validation for my art. I want mainstream success
2016-10-19 06:27:24	holstein	if you think about a child.. they are *quite* happy.. but, its not because they are earning more money, or "successful"
2016-10-19 06:27:24		[06:27]
2016-10-19 06:27:40	catbadger	it's because they don't need to make money
2016-10-19 06:27:42	leebre	right, being naive helps
2016-10-19 06:27:56	leebre	hiding behind naivity hehehe
2016-10-19 06:27:56	catbadger	they don't know that the world is a monster that wants to eat them alive
2016-10-19 06:28:00	holstein	naive? or realistic?
2016-10-19 06:28:18	leebre	putting the head under the pillow and pretending you cannot see anything though thetre are no problems hehehe
2016-10-19 06:28:49	holstein	well, this is not about pretending
2016-10-19 06:29:04	holstein	this is about *not* hooking happiness up on success..
2016-10-19 06:29:05	leebre	being happy is the only shield we have aginst the reality, i mean look at the state of the earth and you know what i amtalkin bout
2016-10-19 06:29:10	holstein	they are not the same.. and one doesnt have to bring the other
2016-10-19 06:29:23	holstein	being happy is more of a process.. quite personal..
2016-10-19 06:29:38	holstein	lots of, what we would call, successful folks are not happy
2016-10-19 06:29:44	leebre	people are punishing and critizigin me for not being successfull
2016-10-19 06:29:48	holstein	so
2016-10-19 06:29:57	holstein	by what metric?
2016-10-19 06:30:02	leebre	money
2016-10-19 06:30:07	holstein	fuck money
2016-10-19 06:30:15	holstein	money is also *not* happiness
2016-10-19 06:30:24	leebre	i am not interrested in money, and this is very arrogant i think
2016-10-19 06:30:31	holstein	you can find, and read about, and see, and talk to *lots* of folks with shit loads of money, that are not happy
2016-10-19 06:30:51	leebre	i know
2016-10-19 06:30:54	holstein	leebre: if you are not interested in that, then, you say that..
2016-10-19 06:31:02	leebre	then i dont eat
2016-10-19 06:31:05	holstein	you tell "people", thats not a metric for your success..
2016-10-19 06:31:08	holstein	leebre: ?
2016-10-19 06:31:13	holstein	leebre: im not saying ,stop making money
2016-10-19 06:31:28	leebre	yes, i often dont have money to eat, i am putting my money in my art
2016-10-19 06:31:48	holstein	im saying, *we* dont have to hang our happiness on the amount of money, or success we have
2016-10-19 06:31:54	leebre	the people they, we dont want to talk with you about success because we have success...we demand you earn more money
2016-10-19 06:32:03	holstein	right.. i have, many times, in the past, not had money to eat
2016-10-19 06:32:14	leebre	because without enough money aou cant eat and you are broken then
2016-10-19 06:32:14	holstein	on more than one occasion, those were *very* happy times :)
2016-10-19 06:32:20	holstein	no
2016-10-19 06:32:25	catbadger	I want this conversation to have my babies
2016-10-19 06:32:36	holstein	money is just money.. its not indicative of broken-ness.. or happiness
2016-10-19 06:32:43	holstein	leebre: you connect these.. not sure hwy
2016-10-19 06:32:46	holstein	why*
2016-10-19 06:33:00	leebre	here money is tied to being happy
2016-10-19 06:33:03	holstein	money is just that.. its not food.. or sustenance..
2016-10-19 06:33:05	holstein	leebre: no
2016-10-19 06:33:16	holstein	leebre: *no where" is money tied to that.. *you* are tying it to that
2016-10-19 06:33:25	leebre	because i am not happy when the people surrounding me are sad and nervous because of me
2016-10-19 06:33:34	holstein	and, you can? but, as they say, you literally cannot buy happiness
2016-10-19 06:33:50	holstein	leebre: so. they are *not* sad and nervous because of you
2016-10-19 06:33:58	holstein	leebre: you cannot make a person have those emotions. they choose that..
2016-10-19 06:34:03	holstein	communication can help..
2016-10-19 06:34:11	leebre	i am seeing everything as you are saying now, i am not totally unhappy, i am just not happy and that is because what i said before
2016-10-19 06:34:36	holstein	right. because you hang your happiness on someone else's idea of what success is..
2016-10-19 06:34:40	leebre	i lost the will to communicate, i gave up, yes
2016-10-19 06:34:50	holstein	thats typical, i think.. folks want their parents', etc, to be proud, or whatever
2016-10-19 06:35:02	holstein	leebre: right. but, what did you 'give up' on? *only* happiness..
2016-10-19 06:35:18	catbadger	I don't know there's a line from boiler room that goes "people who say money can't buy happiness don't have any."
2016-10-19 06:35:31	leebre	this wil never happen, and this is not the point, people are angry and sad because of my poverty
2016-10-19 06:35:31	holstein	yup :
2016-10-19 06:35:37	holstein	:)
2016-10-19 06:35:44	holstein	and if you think it can? go for it!
2016-10-19 06:35:53	catbadger	happiness is abstract and subjective.
2016-10-19 06:35:56	holstein	yup
2016-10-19 06:36:05	holstein	but, where is the happiness level? of cash?
2016-10-19 06:36:08	leebre	i know i can be happier hehehe
2016-10-19 06:36:14	catbadger	cash can buy anything.
2016-10-19 06:36:21	holstein	lol
2016-10-19 06:36:25	holstein	good luck with that..
2016-10-19 06:36:26	catbadger	for real.
2016-10-19 06:36:35	catbadger	what do you think it can't buy?
2016-10-19 06:36:42	holstein	see if you can buy yourself love.. or respect.. or happiness.. or peace..
2016-10-19 06:36:44	catbadger	love? tell that to Melinda Gates
2016-10-19 06:36:48	holstein	if you can, go for it
2016-10-19 06:36:49	leebre	i am not interrested in money, and that will totally annoy others, a poor guy needing help, needing food or money, and saying while holding up hands: money doe not interrest me hehehe
2016-10-19 06:36:59	catbadger	hshs
2016-10-19 06:37:02	catbadger	haha
2016-10-19 06:37:07	holstein	im not telling you how things are.. im telling you, how i choose to live.. thats all i can do
2016-10-19 06:37:13	holstein	you want to buy happiness? go for it
2016-10-19 06:37:15	catbadger	I'm not saying all you need is money, but it's hard to raise a family without it
2016-10-19 06:37:25	catbadger	it's hard to live without it
2016-10-19 06:37:33	holstein	sure.. but is "raising a family" now, happiness?
2016-10-19 06:37:35	catbadger	it's actually near impossile in developed countries
2016-10-19 06:37:39	leebre	i am only focused on love, and that will blow any situation hehehe, so, i am better fosucing on music

2016-10-19 06:38:36	leebre	yeah, money canbuy love, this is an experience that does not go together in anyways with the experiences i ve made
2016-10-19 06:38:41	catbadger	she supports my art thog
2016-10-19 06:39:15	catbadger	I have real love. and money coming in, things are good, but I'm still not getting my validation.

2016-10-19 06:41:08	leebre	this is totally exhausting, and the reward is allways infront of my nose, like a carrot stringed on a stick infront of a mule
2016-10-19 06:41:24	holstein	thats more what im speaking to
2016-10-19 06:41:36	holstein	the idea that, if you catch the carrot, or not,makes one happy
2016-10-19 06:41:47	leebre	i want the carrot
2016-10-19 06:41:51	holstein	or, you can buy that peace of mind, that you now own the carrot
2016-10-19 06:42:10	catbadger	catching the carrot is not happiness. happiness is the fleeting moments of light in the struggle to reach the carrot

2016-10-19 07:52:16	catbadger	I'm making a pop album
2016-10-19 07:52:26	holstein	cool!
2016-10-19 07:52:36	catbadger	just want to create a sellable thing, and worry about the art if and when i make it.
2016-10-19 07:52:41	holstein	its interesting, how, its popularity, is somehow inherent in it, before its creation ;)
2016-10-19 07:52:48	catbadger	haha
2016-10-19 07:53:04	catbadger	yeah I'm actually studying pop right now and I have found many patterns
2016-10-19 07:53:10	holstein	yup.. just pull up youtube, and copy the first thing that has the most hits
2016-10-19 07:53:22	holstein	right.. but, there is no accounting for taste..
2016-10-19 07:53:35	catbadger	oh dumb question, is there a free place to get midi's of top40 music for free?
2016-10-19 07:53:45	holstein	youtube just has the tunes
2016-10-19 07:54:06	holstein	no one is likely converting anything to midi, and *allowed* to offer that as a download, due to licensing..
2016-10-19 07:54:09	catbadger	even older pop... elvis, beatles, stones//
2016-10-19 07:54:20	holstein	sure.. but, thats just the notes, anyways
2016-10-19 07:54:35	catbadger	yes
2016-10-19 07:54:38	holstein	theres more to it. the lyric.. or lack of lyric. the climate.. etc

2016-10-19 07:55:03	holstein	anyways. for you? this'll be much easier
2016-10-19 07:55:03	catbadger	I think anyway
2016-10-19 07:55:09	holstein	since, your goal has nothing to do with art, or music
2016-10-19 07:55:23	holstein	you can just make a product, and put cash behind that product being marketed..
2016-10-19 07:55:29	catbadger	the end goal is art and my own music, but i need to get popular first
2016-10-19 07:55:33	holstein	lol
2016-10-19 07:55:38	holstein	thats actually not true
2016-10-19 07:55:48	catbadger	?
2016-10-19 07:55:50	holstein	the popularity of the music, has nothing to do with you making your own music
2016-10-19 07:55:57	holstein	you just make your own music.. its really just the one step..
2016-10-19 07:56:12	holstein	if you hinge it on its popularity.. thats when the compromises begin..
2016-10-19 07:56:14	holstein	which is fine..
2016-10-19 07:56:23	holstein	but, its just not a prerequisite..
2016-10-19 07:56:34	holstein	hell, you have a few dayjobs. .you dont need to sell anything..
2016-10-19 07:56:50	holstein	you have the freedom to just make your art, and not be attached to an outcome..
2016-10-19 07:56:57	catbadger	but i am
2016-10-19 07:57:01	catbadger	attached to an outcome
2016-10-19 07:57:07	holstein	you are choosing to me
2016-10-19 07:57:09	holstein	to be*
2016-10-19 07:57:12	catbadger	yes
2016-10-19 07:57:15	holstein	which, is fine
2016-10-19 07:57:23	holstein	but, you are trying to make it "popular", and you cant do that
2016-10-19 07:57:31	holstein	its not inherent in the product. its popularity
2016-10-19 07:57:38	holstein	thats more about marketing *any* product
2016-10-19 07:57:41	catbadger	well said.

2016-10-19 07:58:26	catbadger	you are right
2016-10-19 07:58:30	holstein	im not saying there is anything wrong with mcdonalds. but, its not the most popular because of its quality
2016-10-19 07:58:30	catbadger	i think i see what you're saying
2016-10-19 07:58:34	holstein	its due to marketing..

2016-10-19 07:59:02	holstein	you just cant do that
2016-10-19 07:59:05	dmbaturin	Note that you don't even need to make your own music to be popular. In fact, you'd better not. ;)

2016-10-19 07:59:21	holstein	as the saying goes, its easy to make a million in the music business.. you just start out with 2 million
2016-10-19 07:59:44	holstein	if you make a product, and market it, with the intention of its becoming popular. thats what that process looks lie
2016-10-19 07:59:45	holstein	like*
2016-10-19 08:00:01	holstein	just like with the mcdonalds burger. the process was *never* about making a good, or better meal
2016-10-19 08:00:40	holstein	that'l be the same with your "pop" album. if you want it to be popular, the quality is not a factor, necessarily
2016-10-19 08:01:00	holstein	its marketability, etc.. these will be more important..
2016-10-19 08:01:06	leebre	dont use fast food examples toexplain something,it scinfusing when youare hungry hehehe
2016-10-19 08:01:20	catbadger	huaha
2016-10-19 08:01:34	catbadger	I see what you're saying i think
2016-10-19 08:01:52	holstein	*my* music? the albums i make? they are not really intended as products like that
2016-10-19 08:01:58	holstein	i want them as basically reference materials
2016-10-19 08:02:21	holstein	i want someone to have access, to hire me, or my project.. so, i do not really try to market them, in any  "popular" market like that..
2016-10-19 08:02:24	holstein	its not a focus, or goal
2016-10-19 08:02:46	holstein	if i wanted to, or needed to sell them? then i would have to reconsider the business model
2016-10-19 08:03:36	holstein	i am basically a side-man, on many other projects that are of various marketing intentions..
2016-10-19 08:04:03	holstein	but, i dont have any say-so. i just play what im hired to play, and the rest is up to that person
2016-10-19 08:05:05	holstein	like http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/rupertwates3 for example

2016-10-19 08:06:07		[08:06]
2016-10-19 08:06:15	holstein	he pays out a lot to get help with promotion, etc..
2016-10-19 08:06:28	holstein	he pays out a lot in fees when myself, and other musicians perform with him..
2016-10-19 08:06:56	holstein	he has a sustainable business model.. you can find someone doing what you want, and  see how they do what they do..
2016-10-19 08:07:12	holstein	thats why i suggest, simply copying someone on youtube, that is "popular", if thats literally the only goal..

2016-10-19 08:09:49	holstein	dmbaturin: sure.. remember, its just about keeping moving.. not creating anything "good"..
2016-10-19 08:09:54	holstein	more about gaining experience..
2016-10-19 08:10:07	holstein	take the 8 minutes, and thats what you get :)
2016-10-19 08:10:38	dmbaturin	Though, frankly, a lot of 40
2016-10-19 08:10:51	dmbaturin	's bop tunes look like 8 minute songs, and not in good sense.
2016-10-19 08:12:01	dmbaturin	Not that it makes recordings bad, but the head is something one would forget by the second chorus and never remember.
2016-10-19 08:12:18	catbadger	Ok, so once I get popularity what's next? I guess finding a manager to handle the business would be the way to go?
2016-10-19 08:12:44	catbadger	or is it smarter to be your own manager?

2016-10-19 08:19:19	dmbaturin	Anyway, I think the goals to get enough income from music to become a full time musician, and to be popular and have 13 year olds hang your posters in their bedrooms may not be related, or possibly even contradictory.

2016-10-19 08:21:59		[08:21]
2016-10-19 08:22:50	holstein	well, some are able to have a "fan-base"
2016-10-19 08:22:56	holstein	joshua bell, for example
2016-10-19 08:23:13	holstein	is he as popular as, say, a Beiber? ora Beyonce? no..
2016-10-19 08:23:33	holstein	but, if he's able to do what he wants, and make a sustainable business.. *great*
2016-10-19 08:24:00	holstein	its always a challenge mixing art and business..
2016-10-19 08:24:37	holstein	always some kind of compromise.. but, it doesnt have to *always* be, catering one's art to fit what is being consumed, or created, or what seems marketable
2016-10-19 08:24:48	holstein	one can always simply work and cultivate one's own market
2016-10-19 08:25:04	holstein	we see this with actual physical products, and modern business models..
2016-10-19 08:25:22	leebre	reality is too ambivalent...i think thats the same word in english...its all two polarities at the same time...its particle and wave...depending how you want to see it...head is banging
2016-10-19 08:25:27	holstein	basically, testing the waters, with crowd-funding, on devices.. etc.. this is a way of building that market, before hand
2016-10-19 08:26:19	holstein	if you think about your art, as a product, for a minute..
2016-10-19 08:26:56	holstein	are we going to make the product we want to make? or can make? or want to own? and be excited about? or are we making it just for that initial flash of "popular" income?

2016-10-19 08:27:41	holstein	im not meaning to imply anything "bad" about either. its just. one is an example of one making one's are a product, and the other is, one making a product to target an existing market. that can be challenging for *anyone*
2016-10-19 08:27:58	holstein	we can see, for example, *large* companies like microsoft, unable to target a popular phone/tablet market
2016-10-19 08:28:17	holstein	you would think "well, we'll just put out a phone/tablet.. those are popular" and the checks start rolling in
2016-10-19 08:28:23	holstein	but, its not that simple.. you cant account for taste
2016-10-19 08:28:47	holstein	there are multi-billion dollar companies trying to account for taste, and going bankrupt, *all* the time
2016-10-19 08:29:02	catbadger	good point

2016-10-19 08:30:07	catbadger	yes, but validation
2016-10-19 08:30:16	holstein	whats "valid" though?
2016-10-19 08:30:20	holstein	again, its not a state of being for art
2016-10-19 08:30:34	holstein	art doesnt really care what we find to be "valid".. or if our friends like it..
2016-10-19 08:30:45	leebre	i am crying hehehe, sent a message to dutchmusic partners, and my message was forwarded and  some one else is writing back and the subject is: re: great guy...ihave to cry now
2016-10-19 08:31:02	holstein	its certainly can be inspiring, for someone to say "i like your song". but, that doesnt mean anything about that song.. doenst validate it..
2016-10-19 08:31:03	catbadger	I've been told i'm great at every free show, but no one asked if my band wants to play paying gigs, so i quit after letting the rpoject run for 2 years.
2016-10-19 08:31:11	holstein	there is no "art validation process"
2016-10-19 08:31:21	holstein	thats all relative to the creator, and also, the observer..
2016-10-19 08:31:27	catbadger	I want people to want me. that will validate and vindicate me
2016-10-19 08:31:42	holstein	catbadger: sure. but, thats *all* it will do.. it doesnt make your art "valid"
2016-10-19 08:31:50	leebre	you can make peple wanting you,  but selling music is another game
2016-10-19 08:31:55	catbadger	but that's it.
2016-10-19 08:31:57	holstein	just becuase someone pays you to play, doesnt make it "good" or "bad"
2016-10-19 08:32:00	catbadger	that's what I want.
2016-10-19 08:32:18	holstein	sure. and you *cant* build that into the art

2016-10-19 08:33:11	catbadger	I feel that my songs are great. I feel that my production sucks or is weak.
2016-10-19 08:33:16	holstein	cool
2016-10-19 08:33:23	holstein	so, you can work on that, for your *own* benefit
2016-10-19 08:33:30	holstein	there will not be a point, where, you have "valid production"
2016-10-19 08:33:33	holstein	its just not a thing..
2016-10-19 08:33:55	holstein	i really like, thinking of the context, as well.. for example

2016-10-19 08:34:27	holstein	prolly, a 300 year old violin, in a subway, with a person that can *fill* concert halls

2016-10-19 08:34:51	catbadger	THAT is depressing
2016-10-19 08:34:52	holstein	its just not a gauge of validity..

2016-10-19 08:34:59	catbadger	i understand that
2016-10-19 08:35:02	dmbaturin	I don't think it is.

2016-10-19 08:35:32	holstein	you need not sell a million copies, or the label cancels your tour
2016-10-19 08:35:43	catbadger	i see
2016-10-19 08:35:43	holstein	you dont need to move 100 units to recoup for production..
2016-10-19 08:35:49	dmbaturin	He has no problem finding his listeners. It's just harder to find them in a subway. ;)
2016-10-19 08:35:53	holstein	you dont need to fill the room, or the venue wont have you back ;)
2016-10-19 08:36:11	holstein	its just not something you really need to choose to be worried or bothered with..
2016-10-19 08:36:18	dmbaturin	And subway is not very conductive to what he does.
2016-10-19 08:36:29	holstein	its a *completely* depressing state.. trying to market products in business..
2016-10-19 08:36:36	catbadger	yes
2016-10-19 08:36:41	holstein	again. multi billion dollar  research companies *cant* get this right
2016-10-19 08:36:44	holstein	you cant account for taste
2016-10-19 08:36:51	holstein	but, you? you can just make art..
2016-10-19 08:36:57	holstein	no judgment..
2016-10-19 08:37:07	holstein	why not just do more of that ;)
2016-10-19 08:37:07		[08:37]
2016-10-19 08:37:16	catbadger	I want judgement for my work.
2016-10-19 08:37:21	catbadger	I want people to love it
2016-10-19 08:37:26	holstein	sure.. submit it for whatever judgment you please
2016-10-19 08:37:29	catbadger	haha
2016-10-19 08:37:33	holstein	but, you cant *make* folks love it.. of build that into it
2016-10-19 08:37:43	catbadger	I think you can. Gematria.
2016-10-19 08:37:44	holstein	you cant build in, someone else's opinion of the  thing..
2016-10-19 08:37:52	holstein	if you think you can? then, again. go for it
2016-10-19 08:38:02	catbadger	haha I will
2016-10-19 08:38:05	holstein	cool
2016-10-19 08:38:07	catbadger	I feel that it's all numeric
2016-10-19 08:38:10	holstein	and, i truly wish you luck!
2016-10-19 08:38:19	catbadger	haha thanks holstein.
2016-10-19 08:38:31	holstein	when you get it sorted? you can sell this idea to those multi-billion dollar corps that cant do it
2016-10-19 08:38:39	catbadger	that's different
2016-10-19 08:38:42	holstein	you can literally change the face of business forever
2016-10-19 08:38:43	holstein	itsnoto
2016-10-19 08:38:49	holstein	its *exactly* the same
2016-10-19 08:38:51	catbadger	there's record companies doing what I'm talking about
2016-10-19 08:38:54	holstein	you make a product, that you want folks to love
2016-10-19 08:39:01	holstein	catbadger: no
2016-10-19 08:39:18	holstein	catbadger: they are *not* just able to take, literally anything, and guarantee folks will love it
2016-10-19 08:39:22	dmbaturin	You know, I post links to my stuff here so that people can judge the hell out of it. I want artistic judgment so that I know if it's, musically, good or bad; and I'm prepared if people don't love it. Making them love it is not the goal, it would not be really compatible with getting it judged. ;)
2016-10-19 08:39:35	holstein	thats why companies. *even* record companies, go out of business..
2016-10-19 08:40:13	holstein	but again.. i truly wish you well.. and, when you get it sorted? because, maybe you can? you'll literally be the first person to do so. and you'll be famous
2016-10-19 08:40:33	holstein	learning to build "you will love it", *definitely*, into every product..
2016-10-19 08:40:39	holstein	life changing..
2016-10-19 08:42:10	holstein	they say, all we need to know, we learn in elementary school.. thats so realistic, in so many ways..  its so easy for us to get caught up in these adolescent concepts of peer validation.. wanting folks to "like us" ;)
2016-10-19 08:42:34	holstein	nothing wrong with that.. thats for sure.. i wouldnt want to bet my business on it.. though..
2016-10-19 08:43:55	dmbaturin	I didn't know about authentic cadence until well into high school!
2016-10-19 08:44:30	leebre	i ve seen this happenin others people life, now its happening in mine
2016-10-19 08:44:45	catbadger	lebre?
2016-10-19 08:44:56	leebre	jokin
2016-10-19 08:50:00		[08:44]
2016-10-19 08:50:39	holstein	im actually on a bit of a similar arc.. hopefullly, it doesnt take 10 years..
2016-10-19 08:50:59	holstein	i'll get the house paid off, and be out of debt, and, not *have* to play what others find popular, for income

2016-10-19 08:51:48	leebre	my bass teacher showed me how to count, when youhave to play music for money that you really do not like
2016-10-19 08:52:06	holstein	and, i dont have to "like" it, all the time.
2016-10-19 08:52:10	leebre	he counts , 1 �, 2 �, 3 �, 4 �, 1�,...
2016-10-19 08:52:14	holstein	i can get something from the experience..
2016-10-19 08:52:53	holstein	anyways.. its more like "1 dollar.. 2, 3, 4, *2* dollars, 2, 3, 4, *3* dollars.."
2016-10-19 08:52:58	holstein	but, even that, only gets you so far
2016-10-19 08:53:11	holstein	the "proper discomfort fees", so to speak

2016-10-19 08:53:25	leebre	hardened
2016-10-19 08:53:39	holstein	i dont think its life, exclusively..
2016-10-19 08:53:49	leebre	ou tof the comfort zone , directly into real life
2016-10-19 08:53:55	holstein	there is a joy, in realizing other people's music.. i have had great experiences doing so
2016-10-19 08:54:05	holstein	in many popular projects, or whatever... cover bands.. etc..
2016-10-19 08:54:18	leebre	that is cool, really
2016-10-19 08:54:20	holstein	but, at the end of the day, i want to make more time for *my* music..
2016-10-19 08:54:34	leebre	because its a serious topic for you, you have to earnyour money with it
2016-10-19 08:54:36	holstein	and, i can choose to do that. and get into a situation where, i dont need to do the other, as much..
2016-10-19 08:54:41	holstein	no
2016-10-19 08:54:45	leebre	and you still can see the beauty in it, cool

2016-10-19 08:55:00	leebre	we are free
2016-10-19 08:55:13	holstein	i can work on catering the scenarios to be conducive for that..
2016-10-19 08:55:46	leebre	my whole life i was really concerned what others are thinking about me, this changed now, takes away a lil pressure
2016-10-19 08:56:10	holstein	i think its natural to seek that validation..
2016-10-19 08:56:28	leebre	ofcourse, when youhave to pay the rent, or the debs, and you have a wife or a family everything gets scaled a lil
2016-10-19 08:56:58	leebre	i had to talk once with the father of a friend of mine, he shouted at me
2016-10-19 08:57:22	leebre	that he needs to bring 10 K home every month so that no one si starving to death, ..he exaggerated a lil
2016-10-19 08:57:54	leebre	our teachers told us the same, that ou rparents allready spent 100K for us...i dont know if this is all true
2016-10-19 08:58:33	leebre	the guy i worked with, a old fashioned playboy, he calculated how expensive life can get when youhave luck and get old
2016-10-19 08:58:48	leebre	maybe twenty years from 80-100 in  special home for eldery peoples
2016-10-19 08:58:56	leebre	makes maybe 2 million

2016-10-19 08:59:58	holstein	sure.. what im talking about? is catering *my* specifics.. that i can control, so that i dont have to worry about that
2016-10-19 09:00:26	holstein	if i only have $300 in expenses, per month, in 8 years.. then, *all* my music has to do, is come up with that..
2016-10-19 09:00:55	holstein	like 5 grand a year? i think thats do-able..
2016-10-19 09:00:57	catbadger	haha

2016-10-19 09:01:09	catbadger	rent here starts at $2000

2016-10-19 09:01:37	holstein	you dont have to rent ;)
2016-10-19 09:01:40	catbadger	want to buy a house? 25% down. average price of a house is 500k-1M here

2016-10-19 09:02:35	holstein	i did a *lot* of my own labor to facilitate that
2016-10-19 09:02:39	catbadger	icic
2016-10-19 09:02:55	holstein	one of the perks of this will be, that i will *not* have to play "popular" music, necessarily, anymore. if i dont choose to
2016-10-19 09:03:12	holstein	i can literally meet my expenses.. which, *could* be 5 grand a year..
2016-10-19 09:03:28	holstein	if i wanted to live in a box on the street? which is a *valid* choice, i could get that down ;)

2016-10-19 09:10:37	leebre	yes
2016-10-19 09:11:14	leebre	but its reality and i can want much, i can want hair on my head, or i can want to be very charming...but these are wishes, mabye decisions, yes
2016-10-19 09:11:27	leebre	but not every thought get manifested to reality
2016-10-19 09:12:22	holstein	...ive never considered that i can control hair growth as part of freewill ;)
2016-10-19 09:12:47	leebre	i was using bad examples, you know me
2016-10-19 09:12:47	holstein	im *perfectly* fine, not thinking about my hair growing.. im fine handing that one off..
2016-10-19 09:13:04	leebre	i had to let go yes
2016-10-19 09:13:15	leebre	to become happy you must ignore some wishes and thoughts
2016-10-19 09:13:21	holstein	yeah?
2016-10-19 09:13:35	leebre	maybe i guess
2016-10-19 09:13:45	holstein	well, im going to go ignore my wishes and thoughts about not wanting to drive, and get to the gig

2016-10-19 09:38:47	leebre	not well, i do not know it at all, but ive heard the name quite often here...
2016-10-19 09:39:18	ktao	it's kind of poor in functions
2016-10-19 09:39:34	ktao	does not allow to have more than 1 midi ch in a track

2016-10-19 09:42:21	leebre	the last maybe 10 songs are all made with qtractor
2016-10-19 09:42:42	ktao	i know qtractor and i find bitwig better for vst exept for lack of buses and several chs in a track
2016-10-19 09:43:20	ktao	rncbc: maybe it have it but i never used qtr with automation because it's not convenient
2016-10-19 09:43:28	leebre	concerning vst i guess there is no difference betweenbitwig and qtractor, i guess, no expert here...but there are many differences between those two DAW's..but not vst integration i guess
2016-10-19 09:44:11	ktao	it puts envelope over the track and confuses me whil bitwig immediately shows all automated parameters as soon as you add a vst into the track
2016-10-19 09:45:05	-->	AlienCat (~Katt@unaffiliated/aliencat) has joined #opensourcemusicians
2016-10-19 09:45:54	rncbc	ktao: qtractor midi model has been one midi track, one midi channel, one midi instrument, since ever. so there you're mostly right: but midi buses are multi-channel alright. you can put in there all the multi-timbral instruments you like, or else, as it was designed from day 1, you can drive outboard midi instruments
2016-10-19 09:46:45	ktao	rncbc: via carla vst i can make each qtractor's track as multichannel
2016-10-19 09:46:51	ktao	via carla lv2
2016-10-19 09:47:03	ktao	but bitwig can't load carla lv2

2016-10-19 09:47:45	ktao	rncbc:  if you load g-player vst sampler to load gig files into it that g-player has 16 tracks
2016-10-19 09:48:07	rncbc	ktao: how do you get a qtractor midi track to be multi-channel, with carla or else, quite frankly is beyond me ;)
2016-10-19 09:48:10	ktao	so if you load anything to tracks 2-16 they are not played back
2016-10-19 09:48:21	ktao	because bitwig works only with ch 1
2016-10-19 09:48:49	ktao	when you load carla lv2 you can get a lot of chs inside the carla copy
2016-10-19 09:49:23	ktao	so inside of that copy you can load unisono lv2
2016-10-19 09:49:45	ktao	it duplicates notes of channels and sends notes to any channels
2016-10-19 09:49:46	rncbc	ktao: but the carla-lv2 instance which is fed by a qtractor midi track only gets events on one midi channel, the one the track is assigned, duh?
2016-10-19 09:50:06	ktao	so if you want to combine 2 or more instruments that's possible via carla
2016-10-19 09:50:21	ktao	yes the track can accept only one ch from midi keyboard
2016-10-19 09:50:34	ktao	i meant that via carla you can copy chs
2016-10-19 09:50:47	ktao	carla + unisono lv2
2016-10-19 09:54:15	rncbc	ktao: i wonder what you're trying to achieve with that; probably you're meaning 2 or more instruments to play in unison
2016-10-19 09:54:43	ktao	rncbc: right
2016-10-19 09:55:13	ktao	rncbc: see i need to load 2 gig files - one is the usual notes and the second are release samples
2016-10-19 09:55:33	ktao	so i need to duplicate ch1 to ch2 inside the track
2016-10-19 09:55:52	ktao	i can do it in qtractor via carla lv2 with unisono
2016-10-19 09:55:52		[09:55]

2016-10-19 09:57:13	ktao	where can i get that vst?
2016-10-19 09:57:17	leebre	yep
2016-10-19 09:57:34	rncbc	ktao: last ive checked there was one, from the same source tree
2016-10-19 09:57:44	rncbc	ktao: ask falktx
2016-10-19 09:58:10	ktao	i suppose it requires some vst sdk 2.4
2016-10-19 09:58:37	rncbc	ktao: is that a problem?
2016-10-19 09:58:59	leebre	there is a carla vst package , that is carla being able to load vst plugins, but it is not carla as vst...
2016-10-19 09:59:08	ktao	i could not find that sdk it's no longer available
2016-10-19 09:59:32	ktao	i can already load vsts without carla
2016-10-19 09:59:39	ktao	i need carla as a vst itself

2016-10-19 10:01:11	leebre	infinite small amount of knowledge here
2016-10-19 10:01:49	ktao	rncbc: in bin folder or src folder of carla there are .so files
2016-10-19 10:02:16	rncbc	in facto i have it here installed alright: dated Jun 18 22:11, /usr/local/lib/vst/carla.vst/

2016-10-19 10:50:44	catbadger	lol

2016-10-19 10:51:18	caoliver	And who are YOU?
2016-10-19 10:52:59	caoliver	I see a lot of attitudes on both the users' and programmers' parts and damnably little humility.
2016-10-19 10:53:05	caoliver	This troubles me.
2016-10-19 10:55:26	catbadger	I'm a musician cleverly disguised as a senior software developer. I contribute to many projects.
2016-10-19 10:55:35	catbadger	:P
2016-10-19 10:55:51	 *	catbadger has been coding since he could talk (in the 80s)
2016-10-19 10:56:25	catbadger	qtractor is a project I'm just starting to learn
2016-10-19 10:56:36	catbadger	I want to see it as a user though
2016-10-19 10:56:57	caoliver	Still, QTractor is heavy gang-of-four C++ and not an easy dive even for someone with a good bit of coding, so suggesting DIY is a bit out of line.
2016-10-19 10:56:57		[10:56]
2016-10-19 10:57:10	ktao	qtractor's interface refers to 90s as people say
2016-10-19 10:57:30	ktao	not intuitive
2016-10-19 10:57:56	caoliver	I don't find it that awful.  I miss things like gradual tempo change.
2016-10-19 10:58:06	caoliver	rit/accel
2016-10-19 10:58:37	caoliver	Also would like to see automation curves more generally applied to CCs.
2016-10-19 10:58:51	caoliver	Not just volume/pan.
2016-10-19 10:59:15	caoliver	I you want to see awful, wrestle with LMMS.

2016-10-19 11:00:24	ktao	who tested tracktion? people swear it's the best
2016-10-19 11:00:44	caoliver	Handling JACK MIDI would be nice, but I can see why Rui doesn't want to open that can of worms.
2016-10-19 11:01:25	 *	caoliver is gradually working on a Lua scriptable MIDI mangler to handle routing from various controllers to various synths.
2016-10-19 11:01:36	ktao	it already supports jack
2016-10-19 11:02:11	caoliver	I can't sequence a free standing synth with a JACK MIDI interface as I recall.
2016-10-19 11:02:35	caoliver	I.e. externally routed MIDI events are strictly ALSA.
2016-10-19 11:02:48	ktao	yes because those synths work via alsamidi and things like virmidi
2016-10-19 11:03:52	ktao	that's a problem for bitwig for example. you can create external hardware container -bus but that bus will function only as alsamidi
2016-10-19 11:03:54	caoliver	I think the big reason is that Rui started this as a way of controlling hardware synths.  Strictly ITB wasn't on the radar.
2016-10-19 11:04:27	ktao	and you will have to start a2jmidid but if you do it it will capture midi keyboard and bitwig will freeze
2016-10-19 11:04:40	caoliver	I have only one hardware sound producer and that's a Korg rompler.
2016-10-19 11:05:18	caoliver	So no big deal.  If I get a Kawai piano controller and pianoteq down the road, the Korg will be somewhat redundant.

2016-10-19 11:06:18	caoliver	The full Pianoteq is about $600 more.
2016-10-19 11:06:32	caoliver	So about $2400.00

2016-10-19 11:07:20	ktao	caoliver: most digital pianos are crappy pieces of metal and plastic and do not meet specs of a real piano
2016-10-19 11:07:56	caoliver	I know.  I've had my Korg apart a few times.
2016-10-19 11:08:00	ktao	do you know any digital piano with a real downwieght of 50 gram per key?
2016-10-19 11:08:33	caoliver	I figure that a good action needs more than a little work to build even if the hammers are hitting switches rather than strings.

2016-10-19 11:10:49	caoliver	I've never needed a "magic" kernel.  Jack more or less behaves.
2016-10-19 11:10:50	catbadger	that's fair. i just want a sequencer i can make a beat on then drop lyrics onto and produce those lyrics all in the same program.

2016-10-19 11:11:26	caoliver	I tend to wire my controllers to synths and go "exploring."  Rarely do I track MIDI down.

2016-10-19 11:23:01	caoliver	I think they have several.  For some reason, I have Sanford 'verb, but I tend to use convolution reverbs.  Most modeled reverbs have a strange metalic character.
2016-10-19 11:24:02	ktao	caoliver: actually they use mostly high quality artificial plate reverbs in studios
2016-10-19 11:24:21	ktao	convolution is resource-taking with alsmost the same effect
2016-10-19 11:24:49	ktao	also convolution produces artifacts which spoiling of timbres
2016-10-19 11:24:49	caoliver	I don't think the CPU hit is that bad.  What hardware are you running this one?
2016-10-19 11:25:30	caoliver	I have not heard horrid results with good impule material.
2016-10-19 11:25:33	caoliver	impulse
2016-10-19 11:25:41	ktao	caoliver: you may try reading about convolution vs maths to find out that math is actually superior in most aspects
2016-10-19 11:26:10	ktao	finally convolution is also maths
2016-10-19 11:26:19	ktao	but with patternbased algo
2016-10-19 11:26:35	ktao	but it adds timbres of the material
2016-10-19 11:26:55	ktao	i use some old pc
2016-10-19 11:27:20	ktao	lga775 + 4cored cpu
2016-10-19 11:27:20		[11:27]
2016-10-19 11:27:30	caoliver	Which may happen with actual physical acoustics.  I guitar body, for instance, influences timbre.
2016-10-19 11:27:47	caoliver	q6600 ish?
2016-10-19 11:27:56	ktao	yes
2016-10-19 11:28:20	caoliver	I actually just got rid of one.  It was very nice, but it was a power pig.
2016-10-19 11:28:59	caoliver	It's possible to find old business desktops with 3rd gen I cores for very cheap these days.
2016-10-19 11:29:05	ktao	i would switch to some noiseless laptop if i had money
2016-10-19 11:29:19	 *	caoliver just bought two Dell 9010s this year.
2016-10-19 11:30:03	caoliver	They aren't perfectly noiseless, but I'm strictly in-the-box.
2016-10-19 11:30:44	caoliver	They ARE much quieter than the C2D shuttles and Q6600 tower they replaced.
2016-10-19 11:31:24	ktao	with large chassis you can install a good soundcard and which soundcards do you use in laptops i guess external usb?
2016-10-19 11:31:37	ktao	or firewire?
2016-10-19 11:32:11	caoliver	I suspect that you generally want your sound D/A A/D box outside the computer.
2016-10-19 11:32:50	ktao	but they say it adds latency
2016-10-19 11:32:51	caoliver	I had an A/D card for a while, but it picked up a lot of interference.
2016-10-19 11:33:23	caoliver	So does standing a distance away from an instrument.
2016-10-19 11:33:33	caoliver	The question is how much latency.
2016-10-19 11:33:53	ktao	i have about 15 tracks in qtractor and full load of dsp in jack
2016-10-19 11:34:33	caoliver	I would bounce some of those rather than rendering them with synths at once.
2016-10-19 11:34:38	ktao	i wonder if there are cards which have stronger dsps to hadle 60 tracks
2016-10-19 11:35:06	caoliver	I.e. capture several tracks as audio since mixing is cheap.
2016-10-19 11:35:49	ktao	i need to learn that trick to record audio after a sampler into another track
2016-10-19 11:36:17	caoliver	Example, I have some computationally expensive drums in ZynAddSubFX, so I've had to track them separately from the other parts.
2016-10-19 11:36:51	caoliver	But with that note I have to say farewell.  Errands call me.  :(
2016-10-19 11:36:59	caoliver	BBL
2016-10-19 11:37:26	ktao	i put jack to 2042 to avoid xruns

2016-10-19 14:34:41	ktao	[22:08:18] catbadger: i found experimentally some way to widen the stereo effect to make it closer to prof studios [22:08:18]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	ktao	[22:08:55] if you take valhalla reverb - room - stereo presets you will get smth like real studio reverb [22:08:55]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	ktao	[22:09:34] but in studios they can also somehow pan the instruments also with nice influence on highs [22:09:34]

2016-10-19 16:35:04	Septic_Gerkin	i can tell it's not quite greatness
2016-10-19 16:35:10	Septic_Gerkin	but i don't know what to change to make it greatness
2016-10-19 16:35:17	jpt9	Heh.
2016-10-19 16:35:25	Septic_Gerkin	but i really like your sound choices on the ambient stuff
2016-10-19 16:35:27	Septic_Gerkin	that's really good
2016-10-19 16:35:34	jpt9	I haven't done too much recording like that lately -- mostly I've just done piano stuff, and playing with sounds.
2016-10-19 16:35:51	Septic_Gerkin	we are brothers in spirit
2016-10-19 16:36:28	jpt9	Yeah.  The first radiophonic one used a rubber band and a sustain pedal as instrumnts; the second one used some generated sounds, lots of reverb, some freezer noise, and something I don't remember.
2016-10-19 16:36:52	Septic_Gerkin	awesome
2016-10-19 16:37:02	jpt9	And the third one used a spatula.
2016-10-19 16:37:16	Septic_Gerkin	can you sing?
2016-10-19 16:37:17	jpt9	Was sort of meant to sound like a bell.
2016-10-19 16:37:33	Septic_Gerkin	i need about 10 people to sing 4 lines
2016-10-19 16:37:35	jpt9	Sort of?  I don't have perfect pitch, and I don't usually sing in front of other people.
2016-10-19 16:37:55	Septic_Gerkin	not a problem
2016-10-19 16:38:06	Septic_Gerkin	but you can do like 20 takes until you get a simpmle melody right
2016-10-19 16:38:43	jpt9	If I've got a track to sing along with, it's far easier.  Though I don't really like my voice.
2016-10-19 16:38:52	Septic_Gerkin	i'll give you that track now

2016-10-19 16:48:53	Septic_Gerkin	the original pitch was too low for an average person to sing
2016-10-19 16:48:54	Septic_Gerkin	freeze
2016-10-19 16:49:01	jpt9	Are you using PulseAudio?
2016-10-19 16:49:04	Septic_Gerkin	no
2016-10-19 16:49:06	Septic_Gerkin	wait
2016-10-19 16:49:07	Septic_Gerkin	tes
2016-10-19 16:49:09	Septic_Gerkin	yes
2016-10-19 16:49:29	jpt9	There's a known bug where it'll sometimes freeze when opening the sound card through pulse, which it does every time you hit play.
2016-10-19 16:50:09	jpt9	If you use a specific hardware device in preferences (bypassing PulseAudio and just using the device via ALSA), it should fix this, at the expense of taking exclusive control of the sound card.
2016-10-19 16:50:49	jpt9	Or launch Audacity via 'env PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=30 audacity'

2016-10-19 18:04:20	holstein	i assumed the gear was high-maintenance..
2016-10-19 18:04:33	jpt9	Not really.
2016-10-19 18:04:50	jpt9	I mean, if you live somewhere with lots of wind and harsh weather, the antennas might be an issue.
2016-10-19 18:05:43	jpt9	I'm just running a random wire antenna from my window to a tree, though.  Not perfect, but with an unun and my radio's internal antenna tuner, I can cover nearly all of HF with it.  Probably not the most efficient setup, but it works.
2016-10-19 18:05:48	holstein	ah.. maybe thats the deal here
2016-10-19 18:05:52	holstein	with moutains, and wind.. etc
2016-10-19 18:06:10	holstein	im not sure folks can get away with that, here.. and get anything done
2016-10-19 18:06:16	jpt9	If you've got a tower, or antennas on top of your roof, it'd likely be higher maintenance.
2016-10-19 18:07:10	holstein	still. .seems interesting
2016-10-19 18:07:10		[18:07]
2016-10-19 18:07:56	jpt9	Yeah.
2016-10-19 18:10:33	jpt9	Anyway, I should actually get to sleep.  Night!
