2016-10-17 14:19:57	holstein	i like carl sagan..
2016-10-17 14:20:35	holstein	not sure that adds up for me, though.. its likely cut, for someone's agenda..
2016-10-17 14:21:53	holstein	yeah, i think the way it was *actually* said, was. "it *deserves* to be destroyed by the truth"
2016-10-17 14:22:04	holstein	thats a bit different, than the command that is "must" be..
2016-10-17 14:22:46	holstein	much more evocative.. i think.. to think that, because something can have truth tear it down, that it *deserves* to be torn down..
