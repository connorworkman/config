2016-10-17 14:21:53	holstein	yeah, i think the way it was *actually* said, was. "it *deserves* to be destroyed by the truth"
2016-10-17 14:22:04	holstein	thats a bit different, than the command that is "must" be..
2016-10-17 14:22:46	holstein	much more evocative.. i think.. to think that, because something can have truth tear it down, that it *deserves* to be torn down..

2016-10-17 16:45:26	holstein	she stated that, in the debate..
2016-10-17 16:45:44	Stuzz	I see no harm when there's no other talk in here (unless there's new folks being scared away).
2016-10-17 16:46:07	holstein	id rather see it go to a politics channel
2016-10-17 16:46:23	holstein	since, it can be quite divisive, and
2016-10-17 16:46:23		[16:46]
2016-10-17 16:46:49	holstein	there are those places here, that i want folks to have access to.. i mean, thats why we support freenode.. so *anyone* can talk about whatever they want
2016-10-17 16:47:10	holstein	but, i can /ignore.. and thats fine.. occasionally, i just get caught up in the irony, and cant help it
2016-10-17 16:47:44	holstein	i mean, i literally heard her state that, first hand, in the debate.. for example. we dont really need a wiki leaks entry about that. since, she just said it, first hand ;)

2016-10-17 16:53:25	holstein	nah
2016-10-17 16:53:35	holstein	i mean, i watched them..
2016-10-17 16:53:46	holstein	but, i think folks are pretty much set...
2016-10-17 16:53:56	holstein	i think, its more of a ratings grab, these days
2016-10-17 16:54:17	holstein	its more of a random show, like some reality TV thing.. where, its allowed to get "off the rails"..
2016-10-17 16:54:43	holstein	thats entertaining, rather than,  facilitating a "good" debate..
2016-10-17 16:55:24	Stuzz	Was it hosted by Jerry Springer?
2016-10-17 16:55:32	holstein	i know, right?!

2016-10-17 16:55:42	holstein	the last one was just allowed to be such a mess
2016-10-17 16:55:51	Stuzz	I didn't watch 'em
2016-10-17 16:55:58	holstein	you just stop the debate. its easy
2016-10-17 16:56:06	holstein	"we are going to stop if you talk over each other"
2016-10-17 16:56:09	holstein	and you stop that shit
2016-10-17 16:56:10	Stuzz	I actually closed my IRC client 'cause I didn't want to even see anything about it
2016-10-17 16:56:43	Stuzz	I know I can't affect anything related to it, so it simply has no worth for me
2016-10-17 16:56:55	holstein	and we say, to the US public.. "the debates stopped because the adults we have chosen as candidates couldnt communicate respectfully within the parameters of the debate"
2016-10-17 16:57:29	holstein	yeah.. and, im not sure i can affect anything about it.. but, id like to talk about how to constructively do so...
2016-10-17 16:57:42	Stuzz	Well...  you can vote
2016-10-17 16:57:50	holstein	what would it take to elect a 3rd party candidate?
2016-10-17 16:58:08	holstein	how do we stop this "career politician" problem?
2016-10-17 16:58:22	holstein	its supposed to be *representatives* of us.. the fucking actual people
2016-10-17 16:58:30	holstein	if it were? it wouldnt be as much of a problem for sure
2016-10-17 16:58:46	holstein	there would be skin in the game, so to speak
2016-10-17 16:59:01	holstein	im actually not a conspiracy theorist. i think this is just people, doing things people do..
2016-10-17 16:59:07	Stuzz	Representatives, as selected by who?
2016-10-17 16:59:23	holstein	they are out of touch, and greedy, and busy... and not realistic representatives of us
2016-10-17 16:59:36	Stuzz	As far as I can tell, the system doesn't really work as it is.  But, I don't have another one.
2016-10-17 16:59:40	holstein	Stuzz: it was intended to be normal folks, rotating in..
2016-10-17 16:59:53	Stuzz	But I really don't know much 'bout politics (or anything) at all
2016-10-17 16:59:59	holstein	Stuzz: yup. but, the system? as it is? is not really implemented 100% as intended
2016-10-17 17:00:14	Stuzz	No?
2016-10-17 17:00:17	holstein	i think, if one couldnt make a career of this, that would be a good start

2016-10-17 17:01:36	holstein	its a mess, all the way up to the presidential canidates, though.. where, they are chosen more for who can when the popularity contest.. or who knows..

2016-10-17 17:02:13	holstein	again.. i agree with you Stuzz.. i dont have a "better" solution, necessarily.. but, i do think this simple thing would be a nice start.. and address this corporate greed
2016-10-17 17:02:26	Stuzz	Do y'all have city/state elections too?
2016-10-17 17:02:56	holstein	if it were just normal folks? taking 6 month turns? saying "oh shit, i have to go back and live in that town.. im not going to make that bad decision, just because it helps me in this career path to senate" or whatever

2016-10-17 17:04:54	holstein	Stuzz: yeah. i wonder about that..
2016-10-17 17:05:05	holstein	like, do they just invest well ;)
2016-10-17 17:06:00	Stuzz	I got no problem with 'em getting paid well while there, but the golden handshake on the way out isn't suitable
2016-10-17 17:06:12	Stuzz	They should probably get paid more, tbh
2016-10-17 17:06:21	Stuzz	(while actually in the job)
2016-10-17 17:07:12	Stuzz	Certainly now shortage of folks who make more than a country's rep

2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[02:59:53] But I really don't know much 'bout politics (or anything) at all [02:59:53]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[02:59:59] Stuzz: yup. but, the system? as it is? is not really implemented 100% as intended [02:59:59]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:00:14] No? [03:00:14]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:00:17] i think, if one couldnt make a career of this, that would be a good start [03:00:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:00:43] right. its literally the term.. representatives.. delegates.. but, they are not really normal folks.. [03:00:43]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:01:07] it should be, we *all* take a turn there.. and, then, the collective has more say. [03:01:07]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:01:36] its a mess, all the way up to the presidential canidates, though.. where, they are chosen more for who can when the popularity contest.. or who knows.. [03:01:36]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:02:13] again.. i agree with you Stuzz.. i dont have a "better" solution, necessarily.. but, i do think this simple thing would be a nice start.. and address this corporate greed [03:02:13]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:02:26] Do y'all have city/state elections too? [03:02:26]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:02:55] if it were just normal folks? taking 6 month turns? saying "oh shit, i have to go back and live in that town.. im not going to make that bad decision, just because it helps me in this career path to senate" or whatever [03:02:55]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:03:15] Stuzz: yup. local elections.. [03:03:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:03:22] k [03:03:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:03:50] What's Obama get to do afterwards? [03:03:50]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:03:58] who knows.. [03:03:58]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:04:04] relax, im sure.. [03:04:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:04:14] he looks like he's aged like 20 years.. [03:04:14]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:04:32] All polititians 'round here seem to get paid even after they're out [03:04:32]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:04:44] prolly can write books, and do what he likes.. [03:04:44]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:04:54] They certainly don't go hungry at least [03:04:54]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:04:54] Stuzz: yeah. i wonder about that.. [03:04:54]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:05:05] like, do they just invest well ;) [03:05:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:06:00] I got no problem with 'em getting paid well while there, but the golden handshake on the way out isn't suitable [03:06:00]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:06:12] They should probably get paid more, tbh [03:06:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:06:21] (while actually in the job) [03:06:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:07:12] Certainly now shortage of folks who make more than a country's rep [03:07:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:07:21] yeah.. who knows [03:07:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	holstein	[03:07:25] im sure its a tough gig.. [03:07:25]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	Stuzz	[03:07:36] Well..  I wouldn't want it [03:07:36]

2016-10-18 11:14:54	canseco	I usually launch QjackCtl before, as it uses JACK to work, but it's more easy if you use a distro ready to work out of the box
2016-10-18 11:15:03	canseco	like KXStudio or AVLinux

2016-10-18 11:22:09	canseco	Hi jpt9
2016-10-18 11:22:26	 *	jpt9 just made a thing with a recording he had lying around:
2016-10-18 11:22:28	jpt9	https://soundcloud.com/jptuttle/radiophonic-sketch-3-composition-for-spatula-cutting-board-and-daw
2016-10-18 11:22:47	jpt9	Okay, so I didn't really plan it out in advance, so I'm not sure how "composed" I'd consider it.
2016-10-18 11:22:50	jpt9	But it was fun.

2016-10-18 11:54:07	catbadger	any qtractor ninjas in here?
2016-10-18 11:56:49	rncbc	catbadger: ninjas?
2016-10-18 11:56:49		[11:56]
2016-10-18 11:57:52	catbadger	I'm looking for advice. What's the learning curve like for qtractor?
2016-10-18 11:59:10	catbadger	rncbc ninjas are power-users
2016-10-18 11:59:11	rncbc	catbadger: though question imho the curve is perfectly plain ;)
2016-10-18 11:59:26	catbadger	compared to say lmms?
2016-10-18 11:59:30	catbadger	or fruityloops?
2016-10-18 12:00:49	rncbc	catbadger: maybe comparing oranges with apples; though, lmms is a fl wannabe
2016-10-18 12:01:22	catbadger	fl is great, lmms is limited in what it can achieve without vocal tracking
2016-10-18 12:01:29	catbadger	hmm
2016-10-18 12:01:38	catbadger	I liked lmms due to it's amaxing ui
2016-10-18 12:01:55	rncbc	catbadger: maybe you wanna lokk at the wiki -> http://sourceforge.net/p/qtractor/wiki/
2016-10-18 12:02:03	catbadger	thank you
2016-10-18 12:02:06	rncbc	look*

2016-10-18 23:55:24	canseco	[21:21:42] Your welcome [21:21:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	canseco	[21:22:09] Hi jpt9 [21:22:09]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	 *	jpt9 [21:22:26] just made a thing with a recording he had lying around: [21:22:26]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	jpt9	[21:22:28] https://soundcloud.com/jptuttle/radiophonic-sketch-3-composition-for-spatula-cutting-board-and-daw [21:22:28]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	jpt9	[21:22:47] Okay, so I didn't really plan it out in advance, so I'm not sure how "composed" I'd consider it. [21:22:47]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	jpt9	[21:22:50] But it was fun. [21:22:50]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[21:54:07] any qtractor ninjas in here? [21:54:07]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	rncbc	[21:56:49] catbadger: ninjas? [21:56:49]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[21:57:52] I'm looking for advice. What's the learning curve like for qtractor? [21:57:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[21:59:10] rncbc ninjas are power-users [21:59:10]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	rncbc	[21:59:11] catbadger: though question imho the curve is perfectly plain ;) [21:59:11]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[21:59:26] compared to say lmms? [21:59:26]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[21:59:30] or fruityloops? [21:59:30]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	rncbc	[22:00:49] catbadger: maybe comparing oranges with apples; though, lmms is a fl wannabe [22:00:49]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[22:01:22] fl is great, lmms is limited in what it can achieve without vocal tracking [22:01:22]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[22:01:29] hmm [22:01:29]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[22:01:38] I liked lmms due to it's amaxing ui [22:01:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	rncbc	[22:01:55] catbadger: maybe you wanna lokk at the wiki -> http://sourceforge.net/p/qtractor/wiki/ [22:01:55]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[22:02:03] thank you [22:02:03]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	rncbc	[22:02:06] look* [22:02:06]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[22:02:09] i appreciate the discussion [22:02:09]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	rncbc	[22:02:48] catbadger: maybe im too deeply biased [22:02:48]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[22:08:55] maybe, but talking to someone who uses or has used it is very telling [22:08:55]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	rncbc	[22:21:38] catbadger: you're welcome but you have to note that im qtractor's author (sensei?) no other and that's why my telling is skewed :) [22:21:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	catbadger	[22:29:05] oh ic [22:29:05]

2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[21:57:52] I'm looking for advice. What's the learning curve like for qtractor? [21:57:52]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[21:59:10] rncbc ninjas are power-users [21:59:10]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	rncbc	[21:59:11] catbadger: though question imho the curve is perfectly plain ;) [21:59:11]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[21:59:26] compared to say lmms? [21:59:26]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[21:59:30] or fruityloops? [21:59:30]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	rncbc	[22:00:49] catbadger: maybe comparing oranges with apples; though, lmms is a fl wannabe [22:00:49]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[22:01:22] fl is great, lmms is limited in what it can achieve without vocal tracking [22:01:22]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[22:01:29] hmm [22:01:29]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[22:01:38] I liked lmms due to it's amaxing ui [22:01:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	rncbc	[22:01:55] catbadger: maybe you wanna lokk at the wiki -> http://sourceforge.net/p/qtractor/wiki/ [22:01:55]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[22:02:03] thank you [22:02:03]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	rncbc	[22:02:06] look* [22:02:06]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[22:02:09] i appreciate the discussion [22:02:09]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	rncbc	[22:02:48] catbadger: maybe im too deeply biased [22:02:48]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[22:08:55] maybe, but talking to someone who uses or has used it is very telling [22:08:55]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	rncbc	[22:21:38] catbadger: you're welcome but you have to note that im qtractor's author (sensei?) no other and that's why my telling is skewed :) [22:21:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	catbadger	[22:29:05] oh ic [22:29:05]

2016-10-19 02:40:04	gcrk1	klopsi-u3: i think the first part is too long, there is some melodie or something missing, or maybe you should insert a b-part with another bass-line and drums? after 2:30 or something i like the song, pretty repitive and simple (which is great) and i like the sounds

2016-10-19 04:33:14	leebre	i havent smoked for some days, i am nervous, otherwise i would contribute today...next time for sure
2016-10-19 04:33:40	holstein	i havent smoked for like 6 years, and im still nervous ;)
2016-10-19 04:34:30	leebre	hi holstein
2016-10-19 04:34:42	holstein	o/
2016-10-19 04:35:05	leebre	just playing with carla
2016-10-19 04:35:05	gcrk	leebre: is your message connected to my question?
2016-10-19 04:35:19	leebre	which question ?
2016-10-19 04:35:26	gcrk	hehe :D
2016-10-19 04:35:35	gcrk	well, i got a lot of xruns and dont know why
2016-10-19 04:35:50	leebre	look, xruns are the same on any system
2016-10-19 04:35:50	gcrk	yesterday everything worked perfect but today is something different
2016-10-19 04:36:03	holstein	gcrk: can you mitigate them my relaxing your settings?
2016-10-19 04:36:06	leebre	it means that something is disturbing your audio realtime performance
2016-10-19 04:36:39	holstein	lets see.. things that can "just change" randomly, between boots.. the audio device can do that..
2016-10-19 04:36:39	gcrk	holstein: a little but still a lot. about 30 a second
2016-10-19 04:37:17	leebre	as holstein explained to me, and others too, you have to try to isolate the problem and find out what exactly is producing the xruns
2016-10-19 04:37:17	holstein	you may think you are on the same device, but, be running jack on a different one
2016-10-19 04:37:17	gcrk	okay, got this. how do i do this?
2016-10-19 04:37:17	holstein	you could have done an update.. or, booted into a different kernel..
2016-10-19 04:37:21	leebre	though, takin linux av live from usb would be a way to test if your hardware is sane and fully supported by linux kernel
2016-10-19 04:37:26	gcrk	i have done an update
2016-10-19 04:41:17	holstein	right.. so, as the mechanics say "there's your problem"
2016-10-19 04:41:17		[04:41]
2016-10-19 04:41:18	holstein	you just play detective on what you say is happening.. "everything was find, and now, something id different"..
2016-10-19 04:41:18	holstein	me? since, i keep my older kernels, as "known good" states, i would simply reboot into the last kernel that worked, if i took a kernel update
2016-10-19 04:41:18	leebre	yes
2016-10-19 04:41:18	gcrk	good idea
2016-10-19 04:41:18	leebre	and normally, all other kernels, specially in the debian and ubuntu domain stay bootable in the bootloaders menu
2016-10-19 04:41:18	gcrk	maybe i should at first figure out what packages updated...
2016-10-19 04:41:18	gcrk	i am on arch
2016-10-19 04:41:18	holstein	for me, a "better" trick is, looking at *if* i need an update,*before* i take the update
2016-10-19 04:41:18	leebre	arch is different, i am only havin the latest kernel, and if i am having luck i can go to testing and get the kernel from tomorrow
2016-10-19 04:41:18	gcrk	i thought there may be a log where i can see what causes the xruns to have a more specific idea of what happens
2016-10-19 04:41:18	holstein	but, im audio production machine is *intentionally* *not* online.. so, i do not need to maintain any updates
2016-10-19 04:41:18	leebre	holstein, i really cant say if i am needing an update or not
2016-10-19 04:41:19	leebre	though i have one machine, that is connected to the net, which i am consantly updating everday
2016-10-19 04:41:19	holstein	leebre: sure you can.. *is* the machine online? if it is, then, you will want to facilitate security updates
2016-10-19 04:41:19	leebre	yes
2016-10-19 04:41:19	leebre	my daw machine, i am following your advices
2016-10-19 04:41:19	holstein	i dont need/want updates to my audio software
2016-10-19 04:41:19	gcrk	well, the update is a good idea to investigate, i will do this and maybe ask again later for more help. thank you leebre and holstein
2016-10-19 04:41:21	holstein	i dont get any benefit from those updates, since, i dont need/want any new featurs
2016-10-19 04:41:25	leebre	no unneccessary changes to the system that could "worsen" things to
2016-10-19 04:41:44	gcrk	well, i do a lot of other stuff with this pc so i am happy of everything is up to date
2016-10-19 04:41:58	gcrk	*if
2016-10-19 04:42:10	holstein	gcrk: lol. its actually this lack of happiness, currently, that we are discussing
2016-10-19 04:42:12	leebre	holstein, i cannot say sometimey if those updates are for any value for me, its all too complex...
2016-10-19 04:42:26	holstein	anyways.. some cant, for whatever reason, have a dedicated production environment.. which is fine
2016-10-19 04:42:33	leebre	i am waiting for jack1 0.1.2.5 - here , i know what i am waiting for,...jack alsa midi bridge
2016-10-19 04:42:37	holstein	but, updates can break things.. thats just the nature of the biz
2016-10-19 04:42:50	leebre	sure
2016-10-19 04:42:52	leebre	but
2016-10-19 04:42:57	leebre	same coin
2016-10-19 04:43:06	holstein	one can have a separate installation.. and dual boot..
2016-10-19 04:43:08	leebre	other side...update can magically heal bugs sometimes
2016-10-19 04:43:20	holstein	well.. fun fact? this is not addressing bugs
2016-10-19 04:43:28	holstein	its more about staying in a "wanted" state
2016-10-19 04:43:35	leebre	and we all want spontanous wonder healings, aren't we ?
2016-10-19 04:43:38	gcrk	holstein: dual boot is maybe a thing i should consider for my audio stuff
2016-10-19 04:44:02	holstein	like this.. "my thing is working.. i want to keep the thing in this state, and dont get any benefit from updating".. so it can be kept in that state
2016-10-19 04:44:04	leebre	dual boot is fine
2016-10-19 04:44:18	holstein	if one needs a fix? then, one can apply that fix..
2016-10-19 04:44:24	leebre	seperate hard disk would be best for that, no hassle with partitions then
2016-10-19 04:44:24	holstein	bugs are just another part of the biz
2016-10-19 04:44:57	holstein	gcrk: for me, its worth the hassle.. i can have, for example, separate setups, that can facilitate different needs.. per install
2016-10-19 04:45:13	holstein	whats good for my production setup, may not be great for my "daily" install
2016-10-19 04:45:51	holstein	this has been a lot less hassle, for me, than, checking after some updates, and playing detective on what is broken
2016-10-19 04:45:54	gcrk	holstein: yes, this seems to be my problem here. some updates just break things but there are reason why i need them

2016-10-19 04:46:03	leebre	when you are thinking bout dual boot for havin one system at frozen state, you might could think of a DAW container solution featuring docker
2016-10-19 04:46:11	holstein	gcrk: sure.. but, not likely with your audio production needs..
2016-10-19 04:46:21	holstein	gcrk: you may actually just *need* it to work, and be the same as it was yesterday..
2016-10-19 04:46:39	holstein	thats what i need, and prefer.. when i need the updates, its on a more "desktop" oriented setup
2016-10-19 04:46:42	gcrk	holstein: yes, great input, thank you!
2016-10-19 04:46:45	leebre	thats the problem with an open free world full of free open alternatives, one have to get a free clean mind to be able to make the right choice, ithink
2016-10-19 04:46:58	gcrk	leebre: DAW container?
2016-10-19 04:47:00	leebre	my poor thougs
2016-10-19 04:47:35	gcrk	leebre: never worked with docker, seems to be a lot of learning for this, isnt it?
2016-10-19 04:47:37	holstein	when i *was* running a production environment that i updated? i *literally* mirrored that setup, on a laptop.. before applying the updates to the main production machine? i would apply them on the laptop, and test the updated system with my audio hardware..
2016-10-19 04:47:41	leebre	c container....read about docker if youare interrested in having such a solution, i cannot explainbit as well as wiki or google can because docker is not a viretual machine, its a cgourps contaainber i think
2016-10-19 04:47:55	leebre	docker i guess is easy , but i havent tried it yet
2016-10-19 04:48:08	holstein	that worked *great*, until, an update was specifically problematic with hardware that was on the main machine, and not on the laptop
2016-10-19 04:48:34	gcrk	leebre: i will also investigate with that, thanks
2016-10-19 04:48:38	holstein	containerization is *great*, as well.. but, not likely to help us with our audio production environments

2016-10-19 04:48:58	holstein	there is more to the stack.. the kernel interacting with the hardware drivers
2016-10-19 04:49:01	gcrk	when i choose to have a second system i could consider av linux, which may be the right thing for audio :x
2016-10-19 04:49:08	holstein	that breaks, on the host, and cannot be virtualized..
2016-10-19 04:49:14	leebre	okay
2016-10-19 04:49:17	leebre	was just a thought
2016-10-19 04:49:28	holstein	if the DAW is in a container, thats great for the DAW.. but, not specifically going to address *all* potential breakage
2016-10-19 04:49:29	leebre	as i said, all complicado, no comprendre
2016-10-19 04:50:15	JazzyEagle	look at the German speaking Spanish in an English channel!!  Very multicultural!!  hehe
2016-10-19 04:50:39	leebre	hehehe

2016-10-19 04:51:41	 *	JazzyEagle is learning German using an app called DuoLingo
2016-10-19 04:51:43	gcrk	yeah anyway, got some input, i will look what i can do and i guess there will be a good solution ;)
2016-10-19 04:51:47	JazzyEagle	Currently, it says I'm 28% fluent.  :)
2016-10-19 04:51:47	leebre	i start learning now to speack dutch a lil
2016-10-19 04:51:49	gcrk	DuoLingo is so great
2016-10-19 04:51:55	gcrk	i love it

2016-10-19 04:52:01	leebre	i need to learnfaster languages
2016-10-19 04:52:08	pifie	I know several people using DuoLingo
2016-10-19 04:52:26	gcrk	JazzyEagle: wanna proof it?
2016-10-19 04:52:27	gcrk	;)
2016-10-19 04:52:28	JazzyEagle	gcrk: We could be friends on there, if you're cool with it.  :)
2016-10-19 04:52:32	JazzyEagle	Proof what?
2016-10-19 04:52:37	pifie	but...
2016-10-19 04:52:43	pifie	Duoling is.... THE DEVIL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbmXSR_QiP8
2016-10-19 04:53:07	holstein	i was introduced to this "appliance" like nature of my audio production environment, when checking out AVlinux
2016-10-19 04:53:07	gcrk	JazzyEagle: pm ;)
2016-10-19 04:53:41	pifie	I'm blasting progressive trance music at work
2016-10-19 04:53:53	holstein	this was the basic philosophy of that distro.. not that im saying its "good" or "better" than any other.. just that, when i thought about it, i *did* prefer a "stable" appliance setup, rather than something rolling..
2016-10-19 04:53:54	pifie	I don't know if it's appropiate
2016-10-19 04:54:04	holstein	hehe
2016-10-19 04:54:10	pifie	Rupert Sheldrake phrases blasting in a physics department... slightly odd
2016-10-19 04:54:13	holstein	sometimes, i have to leave spaces like that.. when folks are playing music
2016-10-19 04:54:19	holstein	i just cant ignore it, and get anything done..
2016-10-19 04:54:36	pifie	holstein: this music is quite easy to work with
2016-10-19 04:54:40	holstein	some, like to listen to music passively, like that. and i get that.. but, for me, id rather it just be quiet..
2016-10-19 04:54:49	pifie	stable beat, not much chord changes, mostly tonal
2016-10-19 04:54:57	holstein	yup.. im sure it is. but, for me? *any* listening, passively, like that.. is not good
2016-10-19 04:55:00	pifie	if it was quiet, the sound of the pcs would trump over the rest
2016-10-19 04:55:04	holstein	i dont want to have "music to ignore" going on..
2016-10-19 04:55:19	pifie	there are people that earn a living out of making ignorable music
2016-10-19 04:55:19	holstein	i like the hum, in some cases.. but, hell.. thats why we have headphones :)
2016-10-19 04:55:28	pifie	Oh
2016-10-19 04:55:35	holstein	yup.. but, i just choose *not* to listen to ignorable music
2016-10-19 04:55:35	pifie	By the way, do any of you know about Lemon Demon?
2016-10-19 04:55:54	holstein	for me? its a training in passively listening.. and i cant afford to train myself to lose focus like that
2016-10-19 04:56:15	holstein	i try my best to make every note, in or out, matter :)
2016-10-19 04:56:16	pifie	A sort of funny band by Neil Cicierega.... it has some nice chord changes and all
2016-10-19 04:56:32	holstein	but, i get that folks like to have some music playing, while working..
2016-10-19 04:56:32		[04:56]
2016-10-19 04:56:39	holstein	i just have to keep earplugs handy :)
2016-10-19 04:57:10	pifie	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LeSFBy2bZU&t=50m15s <- a very Devo inspired album, I recommend it
2016-10-19 04:57:17	pifie	Got some earworms from that album this week
2016-10-19 04:57:22	holstein	nice..
2016-10-19 04:57:37	pifie	And funny earworms, like singing
2016-10-19 04:57:45	pifie	"As your father I expressly forbid it!"
2016-10-19 04:57:54	holstein	pifie: did you get into "hitrecord.org"?
2016-10-19 04:58:04	pifie	I did sign in but not much else

2016-10-19 05:43:19	leebre	it totally sucks
2016-10-19 05:43:21	leebre	really
2016-10-19 05:43:30	leebre	because we all know, it does not exist
2016-10-19 05:43:30	holstein	in most art, its the *imperfections* that folks prefer, and gravitate to

2016-10-19 05:44:07	holstein	but, is that "good" art? likely not
2016-10-19 05:44:14	holstein	nah.. fuck perfect
2016-10-19 05:44:15	leebre	exactly
2016-10-19 05:44:26	leebre	i tried to get the perfect sound while usingsoftware
2016-10-19 05:44:31	leebre	but i want to do it by hand
2016-10-19 05:44:35	leebre	like a bassdrum
2016-10-19 05:44:47	holstein	im human.. making mistakes? and working with my "imperfections"? to make something *better* than what is perfect? thats what im capable of, as a human
2016-10-19 05:44:58	leebre	its a sub and kick... and a low pass and a high cute, and maybe a compressor
2016-10-19 05:45:12	holstein	sure.. and, i think,when you stop thinking about it that way, you'll get further..
2016-10-19 05:45:21	leebre	i am livin in a constant loop, its a nightmare
2016-10-19 05:45:26	holstein	there is no "kick drum" model, in a vaccum, somewhere, that is the "perfect" one
2016-10-19 05:45:29	leebre	i am not getting paied for all the madness i am doin
2016-10-19 05:45:37	leebre	and it doesnt pay off anyways anykind
2016-10-19 05:45:37	holstein	theres just you, and your ears, and what you hear, and what you prefer to hear
2016-10-19 05:45:47	holstein	perfection is not really part of "sound"..
2016-10-19 05:46:02	leebre	here in nightmare nation, it is hehehe
2016-10-19 05:46:24	leebre	close to the lake of sorrow, near by the rivers of salty water
2016-10-19 05:46:30	holstein	discernment, is certainly a tricky thing to take on..
2016-10-19 05:46:56	holstein	for me, it helps to think of this, not as a shortcoming.. in my personal being
2016-10-19 05:47:04	leebre	i want a perfect sound, and because i am , me, some people are believing in me, which does not make it easier living lies
2016-10-19 05:47:32	leebre	i cant do nothing because i can do only perfect
2016-10-19 05:47:41	holstein	"im not getting the sound i want".. *great*.. thats either, an indication of how bad i am? or, its a chance for me to learn to.. *first* discern a few things.. the sound im getting, against the sound i want..
2016-10-19 05:47:51	holstein	"perfect" is just not a factor, here
2016-10-19 05:48:05	leebre	i have an excat idea of how the sound has to be
2016-10-19 05:48:11	leebre	very exact i guess
2016-10-19 05:48:17	holstein	*great*..
2016-10-19 05:48:23	leebre	feom 22 hz to 22 khz
2016-10-19 05:48:26	leebre	from
2016-10-19 05:48:28	holstein	so, you tweak what is needed, to get closer to that. *knowing* its not perfect
2016-10-19 05:48:48	holstein	and knowing, that the #'s you are spouting out? are relative to situational, and environmental variables
2016-10-19 05:48:52	leebre	i tweaked my whole life, enough tweaking, i need results now, and some butter on the bread
2016-10-19 05:49:09	holstein	well, in *many* cases? we just get close, and move on..
2016-10-19 05:49:15	leebre	i got thropwn back to the start
2016-10-19 05:49:22	holstein	again.. this doesnt have to be an indication of some shortcoming in our person
2016-10-19 05:49:31	holstein	its just a sound. you get close, and move on, and do better next time
2016-10-19 05:49:36	leebre	i need to work on bassdrums that are tonal
2016-10-19 05:49:50	leebre	everything must be perfect and tuned
2016-10-19 05:49:52	holstein	well, *you* are not working with *any* drums
2016-10-19 05:49:56	holstein	but, thats, beside the point
2016-10-19 05:50:26	holstein	actually spending some time? with an acoustic drum? in actual space? would likely be an educational experience for most, and a lesson in discernment..
2016-10-19 05:50:41	leebre	now i am at the point that iam not trusting the conversion software that converted all my samples to sfz...i have to check every sfz file by eye and edit by hand
2016-10-19 05:50:56	holstein	*great*!

2016-10-19 05:51:16	holstein	anyways. dont overthink it.. you have the  sound you have, and the sound you want..
2016-10-19 05:51:20	holstein	and, discernment
2016-10-19 05:51:24	leebre	i pleaed percusission with a group of people this weeken in amsterdam, was a great experience
2016-10-19 05:51:27	leebre	played
2016-10-19 05:51:28	holstein	no "perfect" models..
2016-10-19 05:51:44	leebre	really, it was fun
2016-10-19 05:51:48	holstein	sure.. so, you understand, then, that *every* person, in that performance space, has their own experience
2016-10-19 05:51:48	leebre	we melted to one group
2016-10-19 05:51:58	leebre	yes
2016-10-19 05:51:58	holstein	there is no "perfect" sound.. or tuning.. or whatever
2016-10-19 05:52:04	leebre	no
2016-10-19 05:52:07	holstein	its more about that group.. "melting" together..
2016-10-19 05:52:14	leebre	when doing music with others its a completly different thing
2016-10-19 05:52:15	catbadger	but there can be a perfect sound for a scenario
2016-10-19 05:52:19	holstein	nah
2016-10-19 05:52:24	holstein	i mean, there can be for *you*
2016-10-19 05:52:25	leebre	here, being together with others is what is al about, i think
2016-10-19 05:52:28	catbadger	or a perfect sound for a moment or feeling you are trying to evoke
2016-10-19 05:52:34	holstein	but, its relative.. its not "here is the only, and perfect sound"
2016-10-19 05:52:38	catbadger	yes
2016-10-19 05:52:43	catbadger	totally relative
2016-10-19 05:52:47	holstein	its *all* up to the individual, and discernment
2016-10-19 05:53:02	holstein	no *actual* physical state of perfection to attain
2016-10-19 05:53:17	leebre	perfection does not exist, freedom does not exists, time does not exist..probably...and even if it does, it wont change anything for you or me
2016-10-19 05:53:22	catbadger	anyone know how i can set up snd_seq in ubuntu?
2016-10-19 05:53:30	holstein	thats my only point.. we tend to, as humans, spend/waste a lot of resources getting to this state of being. that is not a thing, and is quite boring..
2016-10-19 05:54:02	holstein	catbadger: should be the same as debian, and most other linux's.. what are you trying to do?
2016-10-19 05:54:31	leebre	i am , as others describing me, i am intense, i did not knew the word before, and i dont know if i am, but everything feels quite tense
2016-10-19 05:54:50	holstein	leebre: cool.. maybe you can also try relaxing..
2016-10-19 05:54:50	catbadger	I am weak when it comes to linux sound arch, i usually produce from windows, so i'm not sure how to do this at all. qtractor says it's not installed or not started.
2016-10-19 05:54:53	holstein	if you find that helpful..
2016-10-19 05:55:07	holstein	if tension is helping you? and being intense is constructive? go for it
2016-10-19 05:55:14	holstein	processes are *so* individual..
2016-10-19 05:55:37	holstein	for me, i like to experiment, and re-think my processes.. to see if i can get anything different, or better..
2016-10-19 05:55:41	leebre	if a woman calls you intense, and all others are smiling and dont want to beintense maybe hehehedo not know for sure
2016-10-19 05:56:41	leebre	making music since more then 20 years, it feels all crazy...why am i doing it...fun, joy, curiosity, respect, hidden wishes to earn money one day, ....yearning for getting famous ?
2016-10-19 05:56:53	holstein	catbadger: when you say "qtractor says".. please elaborate.. when does what say what exactly? and what are you trying to facilitate?
2016-10-19 05:57:04	holstein	is this just a message? lots of messages are in linux os's
2016-10-19 05:57:04		[05:57]
2016-10-19 05:57:19	catbadger	The audio/MIDI engine could not be started. Make sure the JACK audio server (jackd) and/or the ALSA Sequencer kernel module (snd-seq-midi) are up and running and then restart the session
2016-10-19 05:57:26	holstein	there is no "linux" company, making sure the "nasty looking bits" are hidden.. we see *all* kinds of messages. that are not problematic..

2016-10-19 05:58:00	catbadger	haha yeah, lacking the sequencer plugin for a sequencer is pretty fatal though
2016-10-19 05:58:09	rncbc	catbadger: you need to have the ALSA MIDI Sequencer kernel module loaded alright
2016-10-19 05:58:12	holstein	catbadger: sure.. can you make sure it is? as in, your starting qtractor *could* be crashing jack..
2016-10-19 05:58:30	leebre	modprobe alsa_snd_seq
2016-10-19 05:58:32	holstein	also ^ what rncbc is saying

2016-10-19 06:01:51	rncbc	catbadger, holstein: there should be some system settings somewhere, that you set it one and forget for ever more :)
2016-10-19 06:01:52	catbadger	ok thanks
2016-10-19 06:02:00	catbadger	rncbc thanks
2016-10-19 06:02:07	holstein	likely, "just magically set" with ubuntustudio.. who knows..
2016-10-19 06:02:24	rncbc	holstein: obviously
2016-10-19 06:02:34	holstein	its *much* better than it once was.. there was a time, not too long ago, that, one had to re-build things in the ubuntu repos with "jack support"
2016-10-19 06:02:38	holstein	that was a PITA..
2016-10-19 06:02:54	leebre	loading modules is an essential and special feauture of the linux lkernel, the monolith kernel
2016-10-19 06:03:22	leebre	the good thing with linux is, we all want that every one is being able to work with opensource software
2016-10-19 06:04:05	leebre	three people just trying to hel you right now, do you have this with windows, too....that the developper of cubase tries to zhelp you in person to fix aour issues with the software ?

2016-10-19 06:05:12	holstein	or, just trust something else to facilitate this for you
2016-10-19 06:05:33	holstein	education, never hurts anything.. but, one can also learn just enough to be dangerous, so to speak
2016-10-19 06:05:57	leebre	mmm
2016-10-19 06:05:58	catbadger	I'm so happy you're all here to help
2016-10-19 06:05:59	catbadger	thank you
2016-10-19 06:06:08	holstein	i used to see folks ripping things like pulse audio out, and copy/pasting all kinds of things into ubuntustudio.. not really to "fix" anything, specifically, though
2016-10-19 06:06:19	leebre	surely not
2016-10-19 06:06:30	leebre	but this is part of a learning process, too, holstein
2016-10-19 06:06:37	holstein	sure.. but, learning about what?
2016-10-19 06:06:51	leebre	how hot the plate is...
2016-10-19 06:06:52	holstein	do i really need to learn just enough to be dangerous?
2016-10-19 06:07:08	holstein	or, is it better, if i just want to make art, to just go and trust someone else?
2016-10-19 06:07:09	catbadger	haha the plate is hot
2016-10-19 06:07:11	leebre	blisters are good for emotional growth

2016-10-19 06:13:29	holstein	i like to think of it like a server sys admin.. no doubt, that person? is tinkering. and installing, and building.. and playing with software. learning. professional development
2016-10-19 06:13:32	leebre	and as an artist i want controll, as much as possible
2016-10-19 06:13:52	holstein	i *guarantee* you, in production? they are not copy pasting "sudo" commands from wiki pages ;)
2016-10-19 06:14:02	leebre	sure not
2016-10-19 06:14:16	leebre	they are recording and producing but not configuring the machine
2016-10-19 06:14:42	holstein	this separation was key, for me.. since, i realized, *no* other entity was responsible for my support.. or giving it.. nor, preventing it.. and, i *need* a safe experimental environment..

2016-10-19 06:15:12	leebre	but i am a one man show, my sys admin does not exists, the support hotline for desperate OSM's doesn't exist neither
2016-10-19 06:15:14	holstein	"hey, whats that button do?".. is a great teacher.. and i like doing that, and learning that way
2016-10-19 06:15:25	holstein	but, not on my main production machine, or daily driver

2016-10-19 06:16:39	leebre	i went the wrong way, yes

2016-10-19 06:16:44	holstein	there are no "wrong" ways..
2016-10-19 06:16:50	holstein	just things that either help, or not
2016-10-19 06:17:22	leebre	you tried to imply many times to me, very gently and helpfully, tha I might took the wrong way, i think i am remebering ...
2016-10-19 06:17:44	leebre	or the wrong apporaches
2016-10-19 06:17:54	holstein	right. but, if you are getting where you need, thats all that matter

2016-10-19 06:20:06	holstein	maybe not

2016-10-19 06:22:08	leebre	every one must find out for themsleves
2016-10-19 06:22:09	holstein	they just released KDE 1.0 ;)
2016-10-19 06:22:16	holstein	is that a waste of time? i dont think so..
2016-10-19 06:22:23	leebre	linux tricks that are ten years old are probably not working for you, now...
2016-10-19 06:22:24	holstein	but, its an educational look into the past..

2016-10-19 06:23:34	leebre	the frequency of switching between happy and sad, between success and failure , this frquency is getting higher and its too stressfull for me
2016-10-19 06:23:49	holstein	yup
2016-10-19 06:23:56	holstein	if one can, *not* join these things together
2016-10-19 06:24:02	holstein	as in, success = happy
2016-10-19 06:24:11	leebre	today i called somewhere and wanted to know if i understood the way right...the way was 2 years of waiting to get maybe a medical diagnosis
2016-10-19 06:24:18	holstein	its challenging, for sure.. but, even the term success has so much relativity to it
2016-10-19 06:25:25	leebre	the woman was very friendly she said ,that till a certainpoint i understood it right, that she swallowed. took a deep breath and said, everything that i said was right, so, o have to wait 2 years at minimum to get diagnosed...this is livinin a rich country
2016-10-19 06:25:46	leebre	2 years, forget it
2016-10-19 06:25:47	catbadger	leebre what country?
2016-10-19 06:25:52	leebre	germany
2016-10-19 06:25:57	holstein	if i looked at, say, what "successful" artists are doing? and judged myself, against that metric? and then, additionally based my happiness on that outcome? that would be quite depressing ;)
2016-10-19 06:26:11	catbadger	holstein that's my boat
2016-10-19 06:26:19	catbadger	XD
2016-10-19 06:26:31	holstein	but, i need not hinge any of that on my happiness.. thats a separate thing
2016-10-19 06:26:43	leebre	i was waised this way, you want to eat, you need money, you want a woman, you need a job, want  a family, you need a good job ...
2016-10-19 06:26:47	leebre	raised
2016-10-19 06:27:06	holstein	when you think about ,maybe the more happy humans you see, i think you'll find, they are not really dealing with any of these things, to get happy
2016-10-19 06:27:12	leebre	you want to earnmoney with music, try your best
2016-10-19 06:27:17	catbadger	yes. I'm happy about a lot of things.my family makes me proud. I love my wife... but I crave validation for my art. I want mainstream success
2016-10-19 06:27:24	holstein	if you think about a child.. they are *quite* happy.. but, its not because they are earning more money, or "successful"
2016-10-19 06:27:24		[06:27]
2016-10-19 06:27:40	catbadger	it's because they don't need to make money
2016-10-19 06:27:42	leebre	right, being naive helps
2016-10-19 06:27:56	leebre	hiding behind naivity hehehe
2016-10-19 06:27:56	catbadger	they don't know that the world is a monster that wants to eat them alive
2016-10-19 06:28:00	holstein	naive? or realistic?
2016-10-19 06:28:18	leebre	putting the head under the pillow and pretending you cannot see anything though thetre are no problems hehehe
2016-10-19 06:28:49	holstein	well, this is not about pretending
2016-10-19 06:29:04	holstein	this is about *not* hooking happiness up on success..
2016-10-19 06:29:05	leebre	being happy is the only shield we have aginst the reality, i mean look at the state of the earth and you know what i amtalkin bout
2016-10-19 06:29:10	holstein	they are not the same.. and one doesnt have to bring the other
2016-10-19 06:29:23	holstein	being happy is more of a process.. quite personal..
2016-10-19 06:29:38	holstein	lots of, what we would call, successful folks are not happy
2016-10-19 06:29:44	leebre	people are punishing and critizigin me for not being successfull
2016-10-19 06:29:48	holstein	so
2016-10-19 06:29:57	holstein	by what metric?
2016-10-19 06:30:02	leebre	money
2016-10-19 06:30:07	holstein	fuck money
2016-10-19 06:30:15	holstein	money is also *not* happiness
2016-10-19 06:30:24	leebre	i am not interrested in money, and this is very arrogant i think
2016-10-19 06:30:31	holstein	you can find, and read about, and see, and talk to *lots* of folks with shit loads of money, that are not happy
2016-10-19 06:30:51	leebre	i know
2016-10-19 06:30:54	holstein	leebre: if you are not interested in that, then, you say that..
2016-10-19 06:31:02	leebre	then i dont eat
2016-10-19 06:31:05	holstein	you tell "people", thats not a metric for your success..
2016-10-19 06:31:08	holstein	leebre: ?
2016-10-19 06:31:13	holstein	leebre: im not saying ,stop making money
2016-10-19 06:31:28	leebre	yes, i often dont have money to eat, i am putting my money in my art
2016-10-19 06:31:48	holstein	im saying, *we* dont have to hang our happiness on the amount of money, or success we have
2016-10-19 06:31:54	leebre	the people they, we dont want to talk with you about success because we have success...we demand you earn more money
2016-10-19 06:32:03	holstein	right.. i have, many times, in the past, not had money to eat
2016-10-19 06:32:14	leebre	because without enough money aou cant eat and you are broken then
2016-10-19 06:32:14	holstein	on more than one occasion, those were *very* happy times :)
2016-10-19 06:32:20	holstein	no
2016-10-19 06:32:25	catbadger	I want this conversation to have my babies
2016-10-19 06:32:36	holstein	money is just money.. its not indicative of broken-ness.. or happiness
2016-10-19 06:32:43	holstein	leebre: you connect these.. not sure hwy
2016-10-19 06:32:46	holstein	why*
2016-10-19 06:33:00	leebre	here money is tied to being happy
2016-10-19 06:33:03	holstein	money is just that.. its not food.. or sustenance..
2016-10-19 06:33:05	holstein	leebre: no
2016-10-19 06:33:16	holstein	leebre: *no where" is money tied to that.. *you* are tying it to that
2016-10-19 06:33:25	leebre	because i am not happy when the people surrounding me are sad and nervous because of me
2016-10-19 06:33:34	holstein	and, you can? but, as they say, you literally cannot buy happiness
2016-10-19 06:33:50	holstein	leebre: so. they are *not* sad and nervous because of you
2016-10-19 06:33:58	holstein	leebre: you cannot make a person have those emotions. they choose that..
2016-10-19 06:34:03	holstein	communication can help..
2016-10-19 06:34:11	leebre	i am seeing everything as you are saying now, i am not totally unhappy, i am just not happy and that is because what i said before
2016-10-19 06:34:36	holstein	right. because you hang your happiness on someone else's idea of what success is..
2016-10-19 06:34:40	leebre	i lost the will to communicate, i gave up, yes
2016-10-19 06:34:50	holstein	thats typical, i think.. folks want their parents', etc, to be proud, or whatever
2016-10-19 06:35:02	holstein	leebre: right. but, what did you 'give up' on? *only* happiness..
2016-10-19 06:35:18	catbadger	I don't know there's a line from boiler room that goes "people who say money can't buy happiness don't have any."
2016-10-19 06:35:31	leebre	this wil never happen, and this is not the point, people are angry and sad because of my poverty
2016-10-19 06:35:31	holstein	yup :
2016-10-19 06:35:37	holstein	:)
2016-10-19 06:35:44	holstein	and if you think it can? go for it!
2016-10-19 06:35:53	catbadger	happiness is abstract and subjective.
2016-10-19 06:35:56	holstein	yup
2016-10-19 06:36:05	holstein	but, where is the happiness level? of cash?
2016-10-19 06:36:08	leebre	i know i can be happier hehehe
2016-10-19 06:36:14	catbadger	cash can buy anything.
2016-10-19 06:36:21	holstein	lol
2016-10-19 06:36:25	holstein	good luck with that..
2016-10-19 06:36:26	catbadger	for real.
2016-10-19 06:36:35	catbadger	what do you think it can't buy?
2016-10-19 06:36:42	holstein	see if you can buy yourself love.. or respect.. or happiness.. or peace..
2016-10-19 06:36:44	catbadger	love? tell that to Melinda Gates
2016-10-19 06:36:48	holstein	if you can, go for it
2016-10-19 06:36:49	leebre	i am not interrested in money, and that will totally annoy others, a poor guy needing help, needing food or money, and saying while holding up hands: money doe not interrest me hehehe
2016-10-19 06:36:59	catbadger	hshs
2016-10-19 06:37:02	catbadger	haha
2016-10-19 06:37:07	holstein	im not telling you how things are.. im telling you, how i choose to live.. thats all i can do
2016-10-19 06:37:13	holstein	you want to buy happiness? go for it
2016-10-19 06:37:15	catbadger	I'm not saying all you need is money, but it's hard to raise a family without it
2016-10-19 06:37:25	catbadger	it's hard to live without it
2016-10-19 06:37:33	holstein	sure.. but is "raising a family" now, happiness?
2016-10-19 06:37:35	catbadger	it's actually near impossile in developed countries
2016-10-19 06:37:39	leebre	i am only focused on love, and that will blow any situation hehehe, so, i am better fosucing on music

2016-10-19 06:38:36	leebre	yeah, money canbuy love, this is an experience that does not go together in anyways with the experiences i ve made
2016-10-19 06:38:41	catbadger	she supports my art thog
2016-10-19 06:39:15	catbadger	I have real love. and money coming in, things are good, but I'm still not getting my validation.

2016-10-19 06:41:08	leebre	this is totally exhausting, and the reward is allways infront of my nose, like a carrot stringed on a stick infront of a mule
2016-10-19 06:41:24	holstein	thats more what im speaking to
2016-10-19 06:41:36	holstein	the idea that, if you catch the carrot, or not,makes one happy
2016-10-19 06:41:47	leebre	i want the carrot
2016-10-19 06:41:51	holstein	or, you can buy that peace of mind, that you now own the carrot
2016-10-19 06:42:10	catbadger	catching the carrot is not happiness. happiness is the fleeting moments of light in the struggle to reach the carrot

2016-10-19 07:52:16	catbadger	I'm making a pop album
2016-10-19 07:52:26	holstein	cool!
2016-10-19 07:52:36	catbadger	just want to create a sellable thing, and worry about the art if and when i make it.
2016-10-19 07:52:41	holstein	its interesting, how, its popularity, is somehow inherent in it, before its creation ;)
2016-10-19 07:52:48	catbadger	haha
2016-10-19 07:53:04	catbadger	yeah I'm actually studying pop right now and I have found many patterns
2016-10-19 07:53:10	holstein	yup.. just pull up youtube, and copy the first thing that has the most hits
2016-10-19 07:53:22	holstein	right.. but, there is no accounting for taste..
2016-10-19 07:53:35	catbadger	oh dumb question, is there a free place to get midi's of top40 music for free?
2016-10-19 07:53:45	holstein	youtube just has the tunes
2016-10-19 07:54:06	holstein	no one is likely converting anything to midi, and *allowed* to offer that as a download, due to licensing..
2016-10-19 07:54:09	catbadger	even older pop... elvis, beatles, stones//
2016-10-19 07:54:20	holstein	sure.. but, thats just the notes, anyways
2016-10-19 07:54:35	catbadger	yes
2016-10-19 07:54:38	holstein	theres more to it. the lyric.. or lack of lyric. the climate.. etc

2016-10-19 07:55:03	holstein	anyways. for you? this'll be much easier
2016-10-19 07:55:03	catbadger	I think anyway
2016-10-19 07:55:09	holstein	since, your goal has nothing to do with art, or music
2016-10-19 07:55:23	holstein	you can just make a product, and put cash behind that product being marketed..
2016-10-19 07:55:29	catbadger	the end goal is art and my own music, but i need to get popular first
2016-10-19 07:55:33	holstein	lol
2016-10-19 07:55:38	holstein	thats actually not true
2016-10-19 07:55:48	catbadger	?
2016-10-19 07:55:50	holstein	the popularity of the music, has nothing to do with you making your own music
2016-10-19 07:55:57	holstein	you just make your own music.. its really just the one step..
2016-10-19 07:56:12	holstein	if you hinge it on its popularity.. thats when the compromises begin..
2016-10-19 07:56:14	holstein	which is fine..
2016-10-19 07:56:23	holstein	but, its just not a prerequisite..
2016-10-19 07:56:34	holstein	hell, you have a few dayjobs. .you dont need to sell anything..
2016-10-19 07:56:50	holstein	you have the freedom to just make your art, and not be attached to an outcome..
2016-10-19 07:56:57	catbadger	but i am
2016-10-19 07:57:01	catbadger	attached to an outcome
2016-10-19 07:57:07	holstein	you are choosing to me
2016-10-19 07:57:09	holstein	to be*
2016-10-19 07:57:12	catbadger	yes
2016-10-19 07:57:15	holstein	which, is fine
2016-10-19 07:57:23	holstein	but, you are trying to make it "popular", and you cant do that
2016-10-19 07:57:31	holstein	its not inherent in the product. its popularity
2016-10-19 07:57:38	holstein	thats more about marketing *any* product
2016-10-19 07:57:41	catbadger	well said.

2016-10-19 07:58:26	catbadger	you are right
2016-10-19 07:58:30	holstein	im not saying there is anything wrong with mcdonalds. but, its not the most popular because of its quality
2016-10-19 07:58:30	catbadger	i think i see what you're saying
2016-10-19 07:58:34	holstein	its due to marketing..

2016-10-19 07:59:02	holstein	you just cant do that
2016-10-19 07:59:05	dmbaturin	Note that you don't even need to make your own music to be popular. In fact, you'd better not. ;)

2016-10-19 07:59:21	holstein	as the saying goes, its easy to make a million in the music business.. you just start out with 2 million
2016-10-19 07:59:44	holstein	if you make a product, and market it, with the intention of its becoming popular. thats what that process looks lie
2016-10-19 07:59:45	holstein	like*
2016-10-19 08:00:01	holstein	just like with the mcdonalds burger. the process was *never* about making a good, or better meal
2016-10-19 08:00:40	holstein	that'l be the same with your "pop" album. if you want it to be popular, the quality is not a factor, necessarily
2016-10-19 08:01:00	holstein	its marketability, etc.. these will be more important..
2016-10-19 08:01:06	leebre	dont use fast food examples toexplain something,it scinfusing when youare hungry hehehe
2016-10-19 08:01:20	catbadger	huaha
2016-10-19 08:01:34	catbadger	I see what you're saying i think
2016-10-19 08:01:52	holstein	*my* music? the albums i make? they are not really intended as products like that
2016-10-19 08:01:58	holstein	i want them as basically reference materials
2016-10-19 08:02:21	holstein	i want someone to have access, to hire me, or my project.. so, i do not really try to market them, in any  "popular" market like that..
2016-10-19 08:02:24	holstein	its not a focus, or goal
2016-10-19 08:02:46	holstein	if i wanted to, or needed to sell them? then i would have to reconsider the business model
2016-10-19 08:03:36	holstein	i am basically a side-man, on many other projects that are of various marketing intentions..
2016-10-19 08:04:03	holstein	but, i dont have any say-so. i just play what im hired to play, and the rest is up to that person
2016-10-19 08:05:05	holstein	like http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/rupertwates3 for example

2016-10-19 08:06:07		[08:06]
2016-10-19 08:06:15	holstein	he pays out a lot to get help with promotion, etc..
2016-10-19 08:06:28	holstein	he pays out a lot in fees when myself, and other musicians perform with him..
2016-10-19 08:06:56	holstein	he has a sustainable business model.. you can find someone doing what you want, and  see how they do what they do..
2016-10-19 08:07:12	holstein	thats why i suggest, simply copying someone on youtube, that is "popular", if thats literally the only goal..

2016-10-19 08:09:49	holstein	dmbaturin: sure.. remember, its just about keeping moving.. not creating anything "good"..
2016-10-19 08:09:54	holstein	more about gaining experience..
2016-10-19 08:10:07	holstein	take the 8 minutes, and thats what you get :)
2016-10-19 08:10:38	dmbaturin	Though, frankly, a lot of 40
2016-10-19 08:10:51	dmbaturin	's bop tunes look like 8 minute songs, and not in good sense.
2016-10-19 08:12:01	dmbaturin	Not that it makes recordings bad, but the head is something one would forget by the second chorus and never remember.
2016-10-19 08:12:18	catbadger	Ok, so once I get popularity what's next? I guess finding a manager to handle the business would be the way to go?
2016-10-19 08:12:44	catbadger	or is it smarter to be your own manager?

2016-10-19 08:19:19	dmbaturin	Anyway, I think the goals to get enough income from music to become a full time musician, and to be popular and have 13 year olds hang your posters in their bedrooms may not be related, or possibly even contradictory.

2016-10-19 08:21:59		[08:21]
2016-10-19 08:22:50	holstein	well, some are able to have a "fan-base"
2016-10-19 08:22:56	holstein	joshua bell, for example
2016-10-19 08:23:13	holstein	is he as popular as, say, a Beiber? ora Beyonce? no..
2016-10-19 08:23:33	holstein	but, if he's able to do what he wants, and make a sustainable business.. *great*
2016-10-19 08:24:00	holstein	its always a challenge mixing art and business..
2016-10-19 08:24:37	holstein	always some kind of compromise.. but, it doesnt have to *always* be, catering one's art to fit what is being consumed, or created, or what seems marketable
2016-10-19 08:24:48	holstein	one can always simply work and cultivate one's own market
2016-10-19 08:25:04	holstein	we see this with actual physical products, and modern business models..
2016-10-19 08:25:22	leebre	reality is too ambivalent...i think thats the same word in english...its all two polarities at the same time...its particle and wave...depending how you want to see it...head is banging
2016-10-19 08:25:27	holstein	basically, testing the waters, with crowd-funding, on devices.. etc.. this is a way of building that market, before hand
2016-10-19 08:26:19	holstein	if you think about your art, as a product, for a minute..
2016-10-19 08:26:56	holstein	are we going to make the product we want to make? or can make? or want to own? and be excited about? or are we making it just for that initial flash of "popular" income?

2016-10-19 08:27:41	holstein	im not meaning to imply anything "bad" about either. its just. one is an example of one making one's are a product, and the other is, one making a product to target an existing market. that can be challenging for *anyone*
2016-10-19 08:27:58	holstein	we can see, for example, *large* companies like microsoft, unable to target a popular phone/tablet market
2016-10-19 08:28:17	holstein	you would think "well, we'll just put out a phone/tablet.. those are popular" and the checks start rolling in
2016-10-19 08:28:23	holstein	but, its not that simple.. you cant account for taste
2016-10-19 08:28:47	holstein	there are multi-billion dollar companies trying to account for taste, and going bankrupt, *all* the time
2016-10-19 08:29:02	catbadger	good point

2016-10-19 08:30:07	catbadger	yes, but validation
2016-10-19 08:30:16	holstein	whats "valid" though?
2016-10-19 08:30:20	holstein	again, its not a state of being for art
2016-10-19 08:30:34	holstein	art doesnt really care what we find to be "valid".. or if our friends like it..
2016-10-19 08:30:45	leebre	i am crying hehehe, sent a message to dutchmusic partners, and my message was forwarded and  some one else is writing back and the subject is: re: great guy...ihave to cry now
2016-10-19 08:31:02	holstein	its certainly can be inspiring, for someone to say "i like your song". but, that doesnt mean anything about that song.. doenst validate it..
2016-10-19 08:31:03	catbadger	I've been told i'm great at every free show, but no one asked if my band wants to play paying gigs, so i quit after letting the rpoject run for 2 years.
2016-10-19 08:31:11	holstein	there is no "art validation process"
2016-10-19 08:31:21	holstein	thats all relative to the creator, and also, the observer..
2016-10-19 08:31:27	catbadger	I want people to want me. that will validate and vindicate me
2016-10-19 08:31:42	holstein	catbadger: sure. but, thats *all* it will do.. it doesnt make your art "valid"
2016-10-19 08:31:50	leebre	you can make peple wanting you,  but selling music is another game
2016-10-19 08:31:55	catbadger	but that's it.
2016-10-19 08:31:57	holstein	just becuase someone pays you to play, doesnt make it "good" or "bad"
2016-10-19 08:32:00	catbadger	that's what I want.
2016-10-19 08:32:18	holstein	sure. and you *cant* build that into the art

2016-10-19 08:33:11	catbadger	I feel that my songs are great. I feel that my production sucks or is weak.
2016-10-19 08:33:16	holstein	cool
2016-10-19 08:33:23	holstein	so, you can work on that, for your *own* benefit
2016-10-19 08:33:30	holstein	there will not be a point, where, you have "valid production"
2016-10-19 08:33:33	holstein	its just not a thing..
2016-10-19 08:33:55	holstein	i really like, thinking of the context, as well.. for example

2016-10-19 08:34:27	holstein	prolly, a 300 year old violin, in a subway, with a person that can *fill* concert halls

2016-10-19 08:34:51	catbadger	THAT is depressing
2016-10-19 08:34:52	holstein	its just not a gauge of validity..

2016-10-19 08:34:59	catbadger	i understand that
2016-10-19 08:35:02	dmbaturin	I don't think it is.

2016-10-19 08:35:32	holstein	you need not sell a million copies, or the label cancels your tour
2016-10-19 08:35:43	catbadger	i see
2016-10-19 08:35:43	holstein	you dont need to move 100 units to recoup for production..
2016-10-19 08:35:49	dmbaturin	He has no problem finding his listeners. It's just harder to find them in a subway. ;)
2016-10-19 08:35:53	holstein	you dont need to fill the room, or the venue wont have you back ;)
2016-10-19 08:36:11	holstein	its just not something you really need to choose to be worried or bothered with..
2016-10-19 08:36:18	dmbaturin	And subway is not very conductive to what he does.
2016-10-19 08:36:29	holstein	its a *completely* depressing state.. trying to market products in business..
2016-10-19 08:36:36	catbadger	yes
2016-10-19 08:36:41	holstein	again. multi billion dollar  research companies *cant* get this right
2016-10-19 08:36:44	holstein	you cant account for taste
2016-10-19 08:36:51	holstein	but, you? you can just make art..
2016-10-19 08:36:57	holstein	no judgment..
2016-10-19 08:37:07	holstein	why not just do more of that ;)
2016-10-19 08:37:07		[08:37]
2016-10-19 08:37:16	catbadger	I want judgement for my work.
2016-10-19 08:37:21	catbadger	I want people to love it
2016-10-19 08:37:26	holstein	sure.. submit it for whatever judgment you please
2016-10-19 08:37:29	catbadger	haha
2016-10-19 08:37:33	holstein	but, you cant *make* folks love it.. of build that into it
2016-10-19 08:37:43	catbadger	I think you can. Gematria.
2016-10-19 08:37:44	holstein	you cant build in, someone else's opinion of the  thing..
2016-10-19 08:37:52	holstein	if you think you can? then, again. go for it
2016-10-19 08:38:02	catbadger	haha I will
2016-10-19 08:38:05	holstein	cool
2016-10-19 08:38:07	catbadger	I feel that it's all numeric
2016-10-19 08:38:10	holstein	and, i truly wish you luck!
2016-10-19 08:38:19	catbadger	haha thanks holstein.
2016-10-19 08:38:31	holstein	when you get it sorted? you can sell this idea to those multi-billion dollar corps that cant do it
2016-10-19 08:38:39	catbadger	that's different
2016-10-19 08:38:42	holstein	you can literally change the face of business forever
2016-10-19 08:38:43	holstein	itsnoto
2016-10-19 08:38:49	holstein	its *exactly* the same
2016-10-19 08:38:51	catbadger	there's record companies doing what I'm talking about
2016-10-19 08:38:54	holstein	you make a product, that you want folks to love
2016-10-19 08:39:01	holstein	catbadger: no
2016-10-19 08:39:18	holstein	catbadger: they are *not* just able to take, literally anything, and guarantee folks will love it
2016-10-19 08:39:22	dmbaturin	You know, I post links to my stuff here so that people can judge the hell out of it. I want artistic judgment so that I know if it's, musically, good or bad; and I'm prepared if people don't love it. Making them love it is not the goal, it would not be really compatible with getting it judged. ;)
2016-10-19 08:39:35	holstein	thats why companies. *even* record companies, go out of business..
2016-10-19 08:40:13	holstein	but again.. i truly wish you well.. and, when you get it sorted? because, maybe you can? you'll literally be the first person to do so. and you'll be famous
2016-10-19 08:40:33	holstein	learning to build "you will love it", *definitely*, into every product..
2016-10-19 08:40:39	holstein	life changing..
2016-10-19 08:42:10	holstein	they say, all we need to know, we learn in elementary school.. thats so realistic, in so many ways..  its so easy for us to get caught up in these adolescent concepts of peer validation.. wanting folks to "like us" ;)
2016-10-19 08:42:34	holstein	nothing wrong with that.. thats for sure.. i wouldnt want to bet my business on it.. though..
2016-10-19 08:43:55	dmbaturin	I didn't know about authentic cadence until well into high school!
2016-10-19 08:44:30	leebre	i ve seen this happenin others people life, now its happening in mine
2016-10-19 08:44:45	catbadger	lebre?
2016-10-19 08:44:56	leebre	jokin
2016-10-19 08:50:00		[08:44]
2016-10-19 08:50:39	holstein	im actually on a bit of a similar arc.. hopefullly, it doesnt take 10 years..
2016-10-19 08:50:59	holstein	i'll get the house paid off, and be out of debt, and, not *have* to play what others find popular, for income

2016-10-19 08:51:48	leebre	my bass teacher showed me how to count, when youhave to play music for money that you really do not like
2016-10-19 08:52:06	holstein	and, i dont have to "like" it, all the time.
2016-10-19 08:52:10	leebre	he counts , 1 �, 2 �, 3 �, 4 �, 1�,...
2016-10-19 08:52:14	holstein	i can get something from the experience..
2016-10-19 08:52:53	holstein	anyways.. its more like "1 dollar.. 2, 3, 4, *2* dollars, 2, 3, 4, *3* dollars.."
2016-10-19 08:52:58	holstein	but, even that, only gets you so far
2016-10-19 08:53:11	holstein	the "proper discomfort fees", so to speak

2016-10-19 08:53:25	leebre	hardened
2016-10-19 08:53:39	holstein	i dont think its life, exclusively..
2016-10-19 08:53:49	leebre	ou tof the comfort zone , directly into real life
2016-10-19 08:53:55	holstein	there is a joy, in realizing other people's music.. i have had great experiences doing so
2016-10-19 08:54:05	holstein	in many popular projects, or whatever... cover bands.. etc..
2016-10-19 08:54:18	leebre	that is cool, really
2016-10-19 08:54:20	holstein	but, at the end of the day, i want to make more time for *my* music..
2016-10-19 08:54:34	leebre	because its a serious topic for you, you have to earnyour money with it
2016-10-19 08:54:36	holstein	and, i can choose to do that. and get into a situation where, i dont need to do the other, as much..
2016-10-19 08:54:41	holstein	no
2016-10-19 08:54:45	leebre	and you still can see the beauty in it, cool

2016-10-19 08:55:00	leebre	we are free
2016-10-19 08:55:13	holstein	i can work on catering the scenarios to be conducive for that..
2016-10-19 08:55:46	leebre	my whole life i was really concerned what others are thinking about me, this changed now, takes away a lil pressure
2016-10-19 08:56:10	holstein	i think its natural to seek that validation..
2016-10-19 08:56:28	leebre	ofcourse, when youhave to pay the rent, or the debs, and you have a wife or a family everything gets scaled a lil
2016-10-19 08:56:58	leebre	i had to talk once with the father of a friend of mine, he shouted at me
2016-10-19 08:57:22	leebre	that he needs to bring 10 K home every month so that no one si starving to death, ..he exaggerated a lil
2016-10-19 08:57:54	leebre	our teachers told us the same, that ou rparents allready spent 100K for us...i dont know if this is all true
2016-10-19 08:58:33	leebre	the guy i worked with, a old fashioned playboy, he calculated how expensive life can get when youhave luck and get old
2016-10-19 08:58:48	leebre	maybe twenty years from 80-100 in  special home for eldery peoples
2016-10-19 08:58:56	leebre	makes maybe 2 million

2016-10-19 08:59:58	holstein	sure.. what im talking about? is catering *my* specifics.. that i can control, so that i dont have to worry about that
2016-10-19 09:00:26	holstein	if i only have $300 in expenses, per month, in 8 years.. then, *all* my music has to do, is come up with that..
2016-10-19 09:00:55	holstein	like 5 grand a year? i think thats do-able..
2016-10-19 09:00:57	catbadger	haha

2016-10-19 09:01:09	catbadger	rent here starts at $2000

2016-10-19 09:01:37	holstein	you dont have to rent ;)
2016-10-19 09:01:40	catbadger	want to buy a house? 25% down. average price of a house is 500k-1M here

2016-10-19 09:02:35	holstein	i did a *lot* of my own labor to facilitate that
2016-10-19 09:02:39	catbadger	icic
2016-10-19 09:02:55	holstein	one of the perks of this will be, that i will *not* have to play "popular" music, necessarily, anymore. if i dont choose to
2016-10-19 09:03:12	holstein	i can literally meet my expenses.. which, *could* be 5 grand a year..
2016-10-19 09:03:28	holstein	if i wanted to live in a box on the street? which is a *valid* choice, i could get that down ;)

2016-10-19 09:10:37	leebre	yes
2016-10-19 09:11:14	leebre	but its reality and i can want much, i can want hair on my head, or i can want to be very charming...but these are wishes, mabye decisions, yes
2016-10-19 09:11:27	leebre	but not every thought get manifested to reality
2016-10-19 09:12:22	holstein	...ive never considered that i can control hair growth as part of freewill ;)
2016-10-19 09:12:47	leebre	i was using bad examples, you know me
2016-10-19 09:12:47	holstein	im *perfectly* fine, not thinking about my hair growing.. im fine handing that one off..
2016-10-19 09:13:04	leebre	i had to let go yes
2016-10-19 09:13:15	leebre	to become happy you must ignore some wishes and thoughts
2016-10-19 09:13:21	holstein	yeah?
2016-10-19 09:13:35	leebre	maybe i guess
2016-10-19 09:13:45	holstein	well, im going to go ignore my wishes and thoughts about not wanting to drive, and get to the gig

2016-10-19 09:38:47	leebre	not well, i do not know it at all, but ive heard the name quite often here...
2016-10-19 09:39:18	ktao	it's kind of poor in functions
2016-10-19 09:39:34	ktao	does not allow to have more than 1 midi ch in a track

2016-10-19 09:42:21	leebre	the last maybe 10 songs are all made with qtractor
2016-10-19 09:42:42	ktao	i know qtractor and i find bitwig better for vst exept for lack of buses and several chs in a track
2016-10-19 09:43:20	ktao	rncbc: maybe it have it but i never used qtr with automation because it's not convenient
2016-10-19 09:43:28	leebre	concerning vst i guess there is no difference betweenbitwig and qtractor, i guess, no expert here...but there are many differences between those two DAW's..but not vst integration i guess
2016-10-19 09:44:11	ktao	it puts envelope over the track and confuses me whil bitwig immediately shows all automated parameters as soon as you add a vst into the track
2016-10-19 09:45:05	-->	AlienCat (~Katt@unaffiliated/aliencat) has joined #opensourcemusicians
2016-10-19 09:45:54	rncbc	ktao: qtractor midi model has been one midi track, one midi channel, one midi instrument, since ever. so there you're mostly right: but midi buses are multi-channel alright. you can put in there all the multi-timbral instruments you like, or else, as it was designed from day 1, you can drive outboard midi instruments
2016-10-19 09:46:45	ktao	rncbc: via carla vst i can make each qtractor's track as multichannel
2016-10-19 09:46:51	ktao	via carla lv2
2016-10-19 09:47:03	ktao	but bitwig can't load carla lv2

2016-10-19 09:47:45	ktao	rncbc:  if you load g-player vst sampler to load gig files into it that g-player has 16 tracks
2016-10-19 09:48:07	rncbc	ktao: how do you get a qtractor midi track to be multi-channel, with carla or else, quite frankly is beyond me ;)
2016-10-19 09:48:10	ktao	so if you load anything to tracks 2-16 they are not played back
2016-10-19 09:48:21	ktao	because bitwig works only with ch 1
2016-10-19 09:48:49	ktao	when you load carla lv2 you can get a lot of chs inside the carla copy
2016-10-19 09:49:23	ktao	so inside of that copy you can load unisono lv2
2016-10-19 09:49:45	ktao	it duplicates notes of channels and sends notes to any channels
2016-10-19 09:49:46	rncbc	ktao: but the carla-lv2 instance which is fed by a qtractor midi track only gets events on one midi channel, the one the track is assigned, duh?
2016-10-19 09:50:06	ktao	so if you want to combine 2 or more instruments that's possible via carla
2016-10-19 09:50:21	ktao	yes the track can accept only one ch from midi keyboard
2016-10-19 09:50:34	ktao	i meant that via carla you can copy chs
2016-10-19 09:50:47	ktao	carla + unisono lv2
2016-10-19 09:54:15	rncbc	ktao: i wonder what you're trying to achieve with that; probably you're meaning 2 or more instruments to play in unison
2016-10-19 09:54:43	ktao	rncbc: right
2016-10-19 09:55:13	ktao	rncbc: see i need to load 2 gig files - one is the usual notes and the second are release samples
2016-10-19 09:55:33	ktao	so i need to duplicate ch1 to ch2 inside the track
2016-10-19 09:55:52	ktao	i can do it in qtractor via carla lv2 with unisono
2016-10-19 09:55:52		[09:55]

2016-10-19 09:57:13	ktao	where can i get that vst?
2016-10-19 09:57:17	leebre	yep
2016-10-19 09:57:34	rncbc	ktao: last ive checked there was one, from the same source tree
2016-10-19 09:57:44	rncbc	ktao: ask falktx
2016-10-19 09:58:10	ktao	i suppose it requires some vst sdk 2.4
2016-10-19 09:58:37	rncbc	ktao: is that a problem?
2016-10-19 09:58:59	leebre	there is a carla vst package , that is carla being able to load vst plugins, but it is not carla as vst...
2016-10-19 09:59:08	ktao	i could not find that sdk it's no longer available
2016-10-19 09:59:32	ktao	i can already load vsts without carla
2016-10-19 09:59:39	ktao	i need carla as a vst itself

2016-10-19 10:01:11	leebre	infinite small amount of knowledge here
2016-10-19 10:01:49	ktao	rncbc: in bin folder or src folder of carla there are .so files
2016-10-19 10:02:16	rncbc	in facto i have it here installed alright: dated Jun 18 22:11, /usr/local/lib/vst/carla.vst/

2016-10-19 10:50:44	catbadger	lol

2016-10-19 10:51:18	caoliver	And who are YOU?
2016-10-19 10:52:59	caoliver	I see a lot of attitudes on both the users' and programmers' parts and damnably little humility.
2016-10-19 10:53:05	caoliver	This troubles me.
2016-10-19 10:55:26	catbadger	I'm a musician cleverly disguised as a senior software developer. I contribute to many projects.
2016-10-19 10:55:35	catbadger	:P
2016-10-19 10:55:51	 *	catbadger has been coding since he could talk (in the 80s)
2016-10-19 10:56:25	catbadger	qtractor is a project I'm just starting to learn
2016-10-19 10:56:36	catbadger	I want to see it as a user though
2016-10-19 10:56:57	caoliver	Still, QTractor is heavy gang-of-four C++ and not an easy dive even for someone with a good bit of coding, so suggesting DIY is a bit out of line.
2016-10-19 10:56:57		[10:56]
2016-10-19 10:57:10	ktao	qtractor's interface refers to 90s as people say
2016-10-19 10:57:30	ktao	not intuitive
2016-10-19 10:57:56	caoliver	I don't find it that awful.  I miss things like gradual tempo change.
2016-10-19 10:58:06	caoliver	rit/accel
2016-10-19 10:58:37	caoliver	Also would like to see automation curves more generally applied to CCs.
2016-10-19 10:58:51	caoliver	Not just volume/pan.
2016-10-19 10:59:15	caoliver	I you want to see awful, wrestle with LMMS.

2016-10-19 11:00:24	ktao	who tested tracktion? people swear it's the best
2016-10-19 11:00:44	caoliver	Handling JACK MIDI would be nice, but I can see why Rui doesn't want to open that can of worms.
2016-10-19 11:01:25	 *	caoliver is gradually working on a Lua scriptable MIDI mangler to handle routing from various controllers to various synths.
2016-10-19 11:01:36	ktao	it already supports jack
2016-10-19 11:02:11	caoliver	I can't sequence a free standing synth with a JACK MIDI interface as I recall.
2016-10-19 11:02:35	caoliver	I.e. externally routed MIDI events are strictly ALSA.
2016-10-19 11:02:48	ktao	yes because those synths work via alsamidi and things like virmidi
2016-10-19 11:03:52	ktao	that's a problem for bitwig for example. you can create external hardware container -bus but that bus will function only as alsamidi
2016-10-19 11:03:54	caoliver	I think the big reason is that Rui started this as a way of controlling hardware synths.  Strictly ITB wasn't on the radar.
2016-10-19 11:04:27	ktao	and you will have to start a2jmidid but if you do it it will capture midi keyboard and bitwig will freeze
2016-10-19 11:04:40	caoliver	I have only one hardware sound producer and that's a Korg rompler.
2016-10-19 11:05:18	caoliver	So no big deal.  If I get a Kawai piano controller and pianoteq down the road, the Korg will be somewhat redundant.

2016-10-19 11:06:18	caoliver	The full Pianoteq is about $600 more.
2016-10-19 11:06:32	caoliver	So about $2400.00

2016-10-19 11:07:20	ktao	caoliver: most digital pianos are crappy pieces of metal and plastic and do not meet specs of a real piano
2016-10-19 11:07:56	caoliver	I know.  I've had my Korg apart a few times.
2016-10-19 11:08:00	ktao	do you know any digital piano with a real downwieght of 50 gram per key?
2016-10-19 11:08:33	caoliver	I figure that a good action needs more than a little work to build even if the hammers are hitting switches rather than strings.

2016-10-19 11:10:49	caoliver	I've never needed a "magic" kernel.  Jack more or less behaves.
2016-10-19 11:10:50	catbadger	that's fair. i just want a sequencer i can make a beat on then drop lyrics onto and produce those lyrics all in the same program.

2016-10-19 11:11:26	caoliver	I tend to wire my controllers to synths and go "exploring."  Rarely do I track MIDI down.

2016-10-19 11:23:01	caoliver	I think they have several.  For some reason, I have Sanford 'verb, but I tend to use convolution reverbs.  Most modeled reverbs have a strange metalic character.
2016-10-19 11:24:02	ktao	caoliver: actually they use mostly high quality artificial plate reverbs in studios
2016-10-19 11:24:21	ktao	convolution is resource-taking with alsmost the same effect
2016-10-19 11:24:49	ktao	also convolution produces artifacts which spoiling of timbres
2016-10-19 11:24:49	caoliver	I don't think the CPU hit is that bad.  What hardware are you running this one?
2016-10-19 11:25:30	caoliver	I have not heard horrid results with good impule material.
2016-10-19 11:25:33	caoliver	impulse
2016-10-19 11:25:41	ktao	caoliver: you may try reading about convolution vs maths to find out that math is actually superior in most aspects
2016-10-19 11:26:10	ktao	finally convolution is also maths
2016-10-19 11:26:19	ktao	but with patternbased algo
2016-10-19 11:26:35	ktao	but it adds timbres of the material
2016-10-19 11:26:55	ktao	i use some old pc
2016-10-19 11:27:20	ktao	lga775 + 4cored cpu
2016-10-19 11:27:20		[11:27]
2016-10-19 11:27:30	caoliver	Which may happen with actual physical acoustics.  I guitar body, for instance, influences timbre.
2016-10-19 11:27:47	caoliver	q6600 ish?
2016-10-19 11:27:56	ktao	yes
2016-10-19 11:28:20	caoliver	I actually just got rid of one.  It was very nice, but it was a power pig.
2016-10-19 11:28:59	caoliver	It's possible to find old business desktops with 3rd gen I cores for very cheap these days.
2016-10-19 11:29:05	ktao	i would switch to some noiseless laptop if i had money
2016-10-19 11:29:19	 *	caoliver just bought two Dell 9010s this year.
2016-10-19 11:30:03	caoliver	They aren't perfectly noiseless, but I'm strictly in-the-box.
2016-10-19 11:30:44	caoliver	They ARE much quieter than the C2D shuttles and Q6600 tower they replaced.
2016-10-19 11:31:24	ktao	with large chassis you can install a good soundcard and which soundcards do you use in laptops i guess external usb?
2016-10-19 11:31:37	ktao	or firewire?
2016-10-19 11:32:11	caoliver	I suspect that you generally want your sound D/A A/D box outside the computer.
2016-10-19 11:32:50	ktao	but they say it adds latency
2016-10-19 11:32:51	caoliver	I had an A/D card for a while, but it picked up a lot of interference.
2016-10-19 11:33:23	caoliver	So does standing a distance away from an instrument.
2016-10-19 11:33:33	caoliver	The question is how much latency.
2016-10-19 11:33:53	ktao	i have about 15 tracks in qtractor and full load of dsp in jack
2016-10-19 11:34:33	caoliver	I would bounce some of those rather than rendering them with synths at once.
2016-10-19 11:34:38	ktao	i wonder if there are cards which have stronger dsps to hadle 60 tracks
2016-10-19 11:35:06	caoliver	I.e. capture several tracks as audio since mixing is cheap.
2016-10-19 11:35:49	ktao	i need to learn that trick to record audio after a sampler into another track
2016-10-19 11:36:17	caoliver	Example, I have some computationally expensive drums in ZynAddSubFX, so I've had to track them separately from the other parts.
2016-10-19 11:36:51	caoliver	But with that note I have to say farewell.  Errands call me.  :(
2016-10-19 11:36:59	caoliver	BBL
2016-10-19 11:37:26	ktao	i put jack to 2042 to avoid xruns

2016-10-19 14:34:41	ktao	[22:08:18] catbadger: i found experimentally some way to widen the stereo effect to make it closer to prof studios [22:08:18]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	ktao	[22:08:55] if you take valhalla reverb - room - stereo presets you will get smth like real studio reverb [22:08:55]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	ktao	[22:09:34] but in studios they can also somehow pan the instruments also with nice influence on highs [22:09:34]

2016-10-19 16:35:04	Septic_Gerkin	i can tell it's not quite greatness
2016-10-19 16:35:10	Septic_Gerkin	but i don't know what to change to make it greatness
2016-10-19 16:35:17	jpt9	Heh.
2016-10-19 16:35:25	Septic_Gerkin	but i really like your sound choices on the ambient stuff
2016-10-19 16:35:27	Septic_Gerkin	that's really good
2016-10-19 16:35:34	jpt9	I haven't done too much recording like that lately -- mostly I've just done piano stuff, and playing with sounds.
2016-10-19 16:35:51	Septic_Gerkin	we are brothers in spirit
2016-10-19 16:36:28	jpt9	Yeah.  The first radiophonic one used a rubber band and a sustain pedal as instrumnts; the second one used some generated sounds, lots of reverb, some freezer noise, and something I don't remember.
2016-10-19 16:36:52	Septic_Gerkin	awesome
2016-10-19 16:37:02	jpt9	And the third one used a spatula.
2016-10-19 16:37:16	Septic_Gerkin	can you sing?
2016-10-19 16:37:17	jpt9	Was sort of meant to sound like a bell.
2016-10-19 16:37:33	Septic_Gerkin	i need about 10 people to sing 4 lines
2016-10-19 16:37:35	jpt9	Sort of?  I don't have perfect pitch, and I don't usually sing in front of other people.
2016-10-19 16:37:55	Septic_Gerkin	not a problem
2016-10-19 16:38:06	Septic_Gerkin	but you can do like 20 takes until you get a simpmle melody right
2016-10-19 16:38:43	jpt9	If I've got a track to sing along with, it's far easier.  Though I don't really like my voice.
2016-10-19 16:38:52	Septic_Gerkin	i'll give you that track now

2016-10-19 16:48:53	Septic_Gerkin	the original pitch was too low for an average person to sing
2016-10-19 16:48:54	Septic_Gerkin	freeze
2016-10-19 16:49:01	jpt9	Are you using PulseAudio?
2016-10-19 16:49:04	Septic_Gerkin	no
2016-10-19 16:49:06	Septic_Gerkin	wait
2016-10-19 16:49:07	Septic_Gerkin	tes
2016-10-19 16:49:09	Septic_Gerkin	yes
2016-10-19 16:49:29	jpt9	There's a known bug where it'll sometimes freeze when opening the sound card through pulse, which it does every time you hit play.
2016-10-19 16:50:09	jpt9	If you use a specific hardware device in preferences (bypassing PulseAudio and just using the device via ALSA), it should fix this, at the expense of taking exclusive control of the sound card.
2016-10-19 16:50:49	jpt9	Or launch Audacity via 'env PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=30 audacity'

2016-10-19 18:04:20	holstein	i assumed the gear was high-maintenance..
2016-10-19 18:04:33	jpt9	Not really.
2016-10-19 18:04:50	jpt9	I mean, if you live somewhere with lots of wind and harsh weather, the antennas might be an issue.
2016-10-19 18:05:43	jpt9	I'm just running a random wire antenna from my window to a tree, though.  Not perfect, but with an unun and my radio's internal antenna tuner, I can cover nearly all of HF with it.  Probably not the most efficient setup, but it works.
2016-10-19 18:05:48	holstein	ah.. maybe thats the deal here
2016-10-19 18:05:52	holstein	with moutains, and wind.. etc
2016-10-19 18:06:10	holstein	im not sure folks can get away with that, here.. and get anything done
2016-10-19 18:06:16	jpt9	If you've got a tower, or antennas on top of your roof, it'd likely be higher maintenance.
2016-10-19 18:07:10	holstein	still. .seems interesting
2016-10-19 18:07:10		[18:07]
2016-10-19 18:07:56	jpt9	Yeah.
2016-10-19 18:10:33	jpt9	Anyway, I should actually get to sleep.  Night!

2016-10-19 20:40:05	jpt9	[03:56:35] Oh, and I found neat podcast today: https://soundstudiesblog.com/ [03:56:35]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	jpt9	[03:57:07] (Had to convert a couple of the files from m4a to ogg - for some reason my audiobook player didn't like them.  As in it crashed and shut down when I tried to load the podcast.) [03:57:07]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	holstein	[03:57:40] cool.. [03:57:40]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	holstein	[03:57:52] the latest "no guitar is safe" is really good [03:57:52]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	 *	jpt9 [03:59:07] finds it slightly funny how many guitar magazines that one company puts out -- Guitar Player, Guitar Afficiando, Guitar World... [03:59:07]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	jpt9	[03:59:15] (They also do Keyboard Magazine, which I do read.) [03:59:15]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	holstein	[03:59:25] i'lll download "the meaning of silence" [03:59:25]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	holstein	[03:59:31] i dont think i'll be back online for a week, though [03:59:31]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	jpt9	[03:59:38] Vacation? [03:59:38]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	holstein	[03:59:54] getting married tomorrow.. and the honeymoon [03:59:54]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	jpt9	[03:59:59] Congrats! [03:59:59]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	holstein	[04:00:04] 10 days off, pretty much [04:00:04]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	holstein	[04:00:05] yup :) [04:00:05]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	holstein	[04:00:11] cheers.. thanks [04:00:11]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	jpt9	[04:01:15] I should try sampling shortwave radio some time. [04:01:15]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	holstein	[04:02:01] isnt the barrier of entry a bit high? [04:02:01]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	jpt9	[04:02:15] Hmm? [04:02:15]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	jpt9	[04:02:26] I've got a ham radio that picks up 50kHz-60MHz already. [04:02:26]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	holstein	[04:02:27] or is that "amateur radio"? im thinking of? [04:02:27]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	jpt9	[04:02:34] I'm already a ham. [04:02:34]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	holstein	[04:02:38] cool [04:02:38]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	holstein	[04:02:44] some folks in my LUG do that [04:02:44]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	jpt9	[04:02:53] I've mostly done Morse Code stuff recently. [04:02:53]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	holstein	[04:03:03] moving files back n forth at ridiculous investments ;) [04:03:03]

2016-10-20 02:55:11	leebre	as arch user, you get arrogant over time, this is by design...something is not working, sooner then faster, I will remove build andinstall the package again, arch linux users cannot live with broken packages hehehe
2016-10-20 02:55:15	holycrunchitz	jack appears to be hooked up too
2016-10-20 02:55:40	holycrunchitz	ooh
2016-10-20 02:55:49	leebre	i lost sfz support in carla hehehe, i dont think 5 minutes to narrow something down, i remove and build again

2016-10-20 02:56:59	holycrunchitz	haha had a brainstorm, but nope

2016-10-20 02:59:01	JazzyEagle	Try importing a sound file (wav, ogg, or I think even mp3 would work) onto a track in qtractor and see if sound comes out.

2016-10-20 03:08:10	JazzyEagle	holycrunchitz: What distro do you use?
2016-10-20 03:08:20	holycrunchitz	ubuntu
2016-10-20 03:08:59	JazzyEagle	You may want to link to the KX Studio PPA and install the KX Studio stuff.  It makes Pro Audio stuff so much easier for Linux.
2016-10-20 03:09:29	JazzyEagle	KX Studio can be installed as it's own distro, as it has its own ISO, but it also has a PPA to use for both Debian and Ubuntu, for those who prefer to install another distro first.
2016-10-20 03:09:43	JazzyEagle	Since you're already up with Ubuntu, I'd recommend the PPA route.
2016-10-20 03:10:15	holycrunchitz	I tried that PPA, and didn't get what I wanted off it.

2016-10-20 04:40:45	Ricardus	Blast from the past. Last night I dreamed about a club that the band I used to work for, played a bunch of times. It was called Anthony's Attic, and it was in Delhi, NY. It was a NIGHTMARE load-in, and load-out. The bar itself was on the 2nd floor, so all of the gear had to go up a flight of stairs. Then the band played on a loft that was another flight of stairs up. So the PA stayed on the 2nd floor, but all band gear
2016-10-20 04:40:45	Ricardus	 and monitors had to get lugged up another flight of stairs. It was a college town, so the bar always packed'em in, and it was always a super enthusiastic crowd, but man.

2016-10-20 06:33:35	gtao	which sequencer do you use?
2016-10-20 06:33:44	HisaoNakai	qtractor
2016-10-20 06:33:51	leebre	qtractor only
2016-10-20 06:35:48	gtao	it uses mouse too much
2016-10-20 06:36:00	HisaoNakai	gtao: lol, yeah.
2016-10-20 06:36:20	HisaoNakai	gtao: I got a bit of a keyboard driven approach working, but it's still relies on the mouse a lot
2016-10-20 06:36:44	gtao	do you know vimperator plugin for firefox?
2016-10-20 06:36:53	HisaoNakai	yes, I use it.
2016-10-20 06:37:06	gtao	so the same concept can be applied to a daw
2016-10-20 06:37:14	HisaoNakai	of course.
2016-10-20 06:37:28	gtao	so why was it not applied so far?
2016-10-20 06:37:39	HisaoNakai	gtao: I had track up/down bound to J and K for a long time, and transport forward/backward to H and L

2016-10-20 06:38:16	HisaoNakai	gtao: because of either 1. the devs not feeling the need for it, 2. no one providing a PR 3. not enough demand from the userbase?
2016-10-20 06:38:34	gtao	what's transport? do you mean vertical playback line?
2016-10-20 06:39:11	HisaoNakai	oh and 4. all music programs are these opaque static programs not designed for easy customization
2016-10-20 06:39:14	rncbc	gtao: no. horizontal-wise instead
2016-10-20 06:39:29	gtao	users usually don't use vimperator and don't know about that possibility

2016-10-20 06:41:12	gtao	HisaoNakai: did you try bitwig?
2016-10-20 06:42:06	HisaoNakai	gtao: I do not use proprietary software, so no.
2016-10-20 06:42:08	rncbc	gtao: and live and cubase and reaper and whatelse?
2016-10-20 06:42:41	gtao	idk if it's proprietary or not
2016-10-20 06:42:44	HisaoNakai	it is.
2016-10-20 06:42:52	gtao	convenience is what matters
2016-10-20 06:42:59	HisaoNakai	depends on whom you ask.
2016-10-20 06:43:50	HisaoNakai	some sacrifice the convenience for (ethics|...), some get the convenience from the libre tools, (and so on)
2016-10-20 06:44:31	gtao	i would better use proprietary better product than worse opensource
2016-10-20 06:44:43	HisaoNakai	I will probably not like any DAW/sequencer, libre or otherwise.
2016-10-20 06:45:09	gtao	to avoid torture and pain
2016-10-20 06:45:14	HisaoNakai	and I'd like something as easily extensible and customizable as Emacs - being able to see and modify the source is critical for that.
2016-10-20 06:45:42	HisaoNakai	gtao: and no one's forcing you, I believe. ;)
2016-10-20 06:46:03	gtao	i don't care for the internals if it's emacs or nonemacs
2016-10-20 06:46:20	gtao	just wanna have ready-made convenient thing
2016-10-20 06:46:33	HisaoNakai	gtao: err, emacs is a program. a text editor. The way it's made makes it the most easily extensible and customizable, bar none.
2016-10-20 06:47:09	gtao	i use simple vim for text editing
2016-10-20 06:47:10	HisaoNakai	Yeah, it's not a ready-made convenience thing, it's a tool that you can adapt to fit your personal workflow. It becomes exactly what you want from it.
2016-10-20 06:47:49	HisaoNakai	vim is not simple by any stretch of imagination, by the way...it tries to become Emacs while trying to convince itself it's a UNIX-style program xD

2016-10-20 06:49:19	HisaoNakai	I was saying that the kind of DAW/sequencer I'd like would be Emacs-like, which no existing program (libre or not) is, and having the source is critical for that.
2016-10-20 06:49:34	gtao	do you know denemo?
2016-10-20 06:49:43	gtao	denemo is purely emacs style
2016-10-20 06:49:50	HisaoNakai	gtao: denemo is a scorewriter

2016-10-20 07:19:33	bluebell	catbadger: unfortuntly Linux has several sound systems and they can compete

2016-10-20 07:20:13	catbadger	I know a fair bit about linux, but my sound arch knowledge is admittedly weak.
2016-10-20 07:20:15	bluebell	catbadger: basically you have to setup jack to use your sound device and then alsa and pulseaudio to use jack
2016-10-20 07:20:23	catbadger	oh
2016-10-20 07:20:39	catbadger	yeah I'm not at my home machine right now
2016-10-20 07:20:43	bluebell	catbadger: most problems: pulseaudio catches your sound device and jack can't output to it
2016-10-20 07:20:48	catbadger	oh
2016-10-20 07:20:51	gtao	bluebell: do you know mastering?

2016-10-20 07:21:24	catbadger	I gotta get back to werkie
2016-10-20 07:21:37	 *	bluebell came home from work
2016-10-20 07:21:43	gtao	anyway you produce electronic music which does not need mastering at all
2016-10-20 07:22:04	gtao	if you made some metal your advice could be valuable
2016-10-20 07:22:08	bluebell	gtao: people are used to listen to "mastered" songs with compression applied
2016-10-20 07:22:39	gtao	bluebell: do they apply compression to all instuments separately or to the final stream?
2016-10-20 07:22:55	 *	catbadger goes back to debugging...
2016-10-20 07:22:55	bluebell	gtao: I make pop music, so I have some tools in master out to do the mastering. Some time ago I did it in a separate step with separate tools but now I only put the stuff in master out (multiband comp et al)
2016-10-20 07:23:29	bluebell	gtao: it depends. I use compression on each vocal track. And I apply some compression on master out
2016-10-20 07:23:50	bluebell	gtao: I don't use compression on synth tracks
2016-10-20 07:23:58	gtao	bluebell: and which effect you acheive by compressing?
2016-10-20 07:24:05	bluebell	gtao: compression.
2016-10-20 07:24:15	bluebell	gtao: higher average loudness
2016-10-20 07:24:20	gtao	i mean how sound changes
2016-10-20 07:24:39	bluebell	gtao: smoother, thicker, more "everything sticks together"
2016-10-20 07:24:41	gtao	and what is sacrificed?
2016-10-20 07:24:42	leebre	because the differences in the dynamic are smaller, though you can makeit louder. overall
2016-10-20 07:25:00	bluebell	gtao: if you don't use too much compression then nothing is sacrified
2016-10-20 07:25:30	bluebell	gtao: if you do it to much then you get some ugly pumping and effects like "instruments get lower when vocals start"

2016-10-20 07:26:57	gtao	my output sounds too queit as compared to songs from internet, if i increase volume i get over 0 db and cracks perhaps i need to use that compression too

2016-10-20 07:27:38	gtao	bluebell:  and what's the purpose of compressing voice?
2016-10-20 07:27:52	bluebell	gtao: make it smoother, more sustaining
2016-10-20 07:28:00	bluebell	gtao: and help prevent clipping
2016-10-20 07:28:21	bluebell	gtao: make the differences between loud and low notes smaller
2016-10-20 07:28:41	gtao	bluebell: do you know how they create that nice stereo panorama in studios? do they apply some kind of reverb to master out?
2016-10-20 07:29:00	bluebell	gtao: there are maaaany ways to make it broader.
2016-10-20 07:29:50	bluebell	gtao: pan the volume to the left or the right, delay one side a bit, mix left side phase-turned with the right side and so on
2016-10-20 07:30:25	gtao	bluebell: i used ambisonics in nonmixer for some time but it consumes too much cpu power. do you do any panning of instruments and if yes do you pan the tracks via qtractor means or by some other plugins?
2016-10-20 07:30:53	bluebell	gtao: AFAIK for ambisonic you need some special players but I am no expert
2016-10-20 07:31:30	bluebell	gtao: sometimes I use volume pan, sometimes I use lil delays, it depends
2016-10-20 07:31:49	gtao	how do you delay one side?
2016-10-20 07:31:52	bluebell	gtao: balance.lv2 is and CALF stereo tools are nice
2016-10-20 07:32:24	bluebell	gtao: with delay plugins but max 1 or 2 ms
2016-10-20 07:33:17	gtao	so you split a stereo master track into 2 mono tracks or those plugins deal with stereo tracks?
2016-10-20 07:33:17		[07:33]
2016-10-20 07:33:39	bluebell	gtao: oh no, such effects shouldn't be applied to the master but to individual tracks
2016-10-20 07:34:15	gtao	oh yes because each intrument should have own position
2016-10-20 07:34:21	bluebell	exactly
2016-10-20 07:34:52	gtao	and what does that phase inversion do?
2016-10-20 07:34:53	bluebell	and tools like a stereo chorus applied to the master would become boring very quickly
2016-10-20 07:35:49	bluebell	gtao: if you take the left side, change its phase by 180 degrees (invert it) and mix a bit of it to the right side then the right side seems to be righter than right :)
2016-10-20 07:35:55	gtao	i agree i tried stereo chorus from valhalla reverb and did not like it but there is another stereo preset within valhalla room which makes sound like out of a professional studio
2016-10-20 07:36:04	bluebell	gtao: it's the "stereo expander" effect
2016-10-20 07:36:41	gtao	interesting
2016-10-20 07:38:05	gtao	but you say you mix not total inverted left ch but portion of it, so you still supply the normal left ch too
2016-10-20 07:38:30	bluebell	if you mix 100% of inverted left to left then you get ... silence
2016-10-20 07:39:07	gtao	left to right you meant i guess
2016-10-20 07:39:51	bluebell	I guess if you use too much of the inverted left to the right side then you get some ugly effects since left and right are never 100% different
2016-10-20 07:40:14	bluebell	maybe the stereo width becomes smaller again
2016-10-20 07:40:37	gtao	which plugin do you use for that inversion trick?
2016-10-20 07:41:04	bluebell	none. I don't like this effect.
2016-10-20 07:41:28	gcrk	is there a way to get the message log from qjackctl on a shell?
2016-10-20 07:42:41	bluebell	you can start jackd in a shell then you get the messages
2016-10-20 07:42:55	bluebell	I do it but I redirect its outout to a log file
2016-10-20 07:43:37	gcrk	bluebell: okay, so there is no regular log file?
2016-10-20 07:44:01	bluebell	Qjackctl shows the log in the "messages" window
2016-10-20 07:44:08	bluebell	it catches jackd's ouput

2016-10-20 07:45:02	gtao	bluebell: btw you do not need special speakers system for ambisonics, you only need ambisonics microphone
2016-10-20 07:45:29	gtao	it has usually 4 mics positioned under diff angles
2016-10-20 07:45:41	bluebell	gcrk: I start jackd with a script when I log in
2016-10-20 07:46:08	bluebell	gtao: I don't know much about ambisonic
2016-10-20 07:46:59	bluebell	gcrk: did you know that jack can output/input to/from another jackd via network?
2016-10-20 07:47:08	bluebell	gcrk: maybe that can be an option, too
2016-10-20 07:47:35	gtao	it records 4 angles into some specially encoded stream and then you use special software to deal with it, finally you can get stereo or perhaps you can convert to 5.1
2016-10-20 07:48:04	bluebell	gtao: since I don't record everything with mics I guess ambisonics isn't for me
2016-10-20 07:48:28	bluebell	gtao: I use software synths and sample players

2016-10-20 07:49:56	bluebell	gtao: you can fake soundpositions a bit with an EQ if you read the docs about the Blauert's directional bands
2016-10-20 07:52:40	gtao	amb ladspa and lv2 plugins actually do the same they supress highs when you detach the source from the center and weaken volume, its default is 1 meter from the center so if you put the source directly into the center you get kind of stereo enlargement and the feel of being inside the box of the intrument

2016-10-20 08:13:55	bluebell	gcrk: you can run jack without a soundcard on your c2 and output to your pc
2016-10-20 08:14:49	gcrk	bluebell: right, but at first i want to use the soundcard because i want to be able to play everytime i want without turning the pc on which eats power like a monster
2016-10-20 08:16:13	bluebell	I see
2016-10-20 08:16:57	bluebell	Since I don't do action gaming I don't have a graphics card in my pc, so it doesn't use much power
2016-10-20 08:17:28	bluebell	only simple Intel onboard graphics
2016-10-20 08:17:31	gcrk	depends on your comparison. besides the c2 everything is using much power :D

2016-10-20 09:17:40	gtao	there are compressors to create death metal sound for example which you can't obtain by regular compressors
2016-10-20 09:17:46	bluebell	but they don't have an own life. they do what you tell them. choosing attack, release, ratio makes more differences than changing the plugin
2016-10-20 09:17:55	bluebell	I doubt that.
2016-10-20 09:18:23	gtao	maybe i need to find out the difference
2016-10-20 09:18:34	bluebell	the differences will be subtile
2016-10-20 09:18:43	bluebell	it's much more important how you use them
2016-10-20 09:19:01	gtao	so you advice not wasting time on comparison?
2016-10-20 09:19:12	bluebell	compare a couple of them
2016-10-20 09:19:17	bluebell	as I did
2016-10-20 09:19:43	bluebell	then choose one, use one and if something annoys you then search another one without that special annoyance
2016-10-20 09:20:17	bluebell	and as long as nothing annoys you simply change the settings until you like the sound
2016-10-20 09:21:27	gtao	btw what for do they use guitar amps. doesn't regular increase of volume amplify the sound?
2016-10-20 09:21:30	bluebell	one hint by me: use single band comprossors for single tracks, use multiband compressors in the master
2016-10-20 09:21:59	gtao	thanks
2016-10-20 09:22:37	bluebell	guitar amps change the sound intentionally. but you can't claim that you need brand X to make metal
2016-10-20 09:22:55	bluebell	a guitarist who know his instrument and his amp can make metal with a vox ac30
2016-10-20 09:23:41	bluebell	one more hint: if you use a multiband compressor and a multiband limiter in master then make sure they use the same split frequencies
2016-10-20 09:24:03	bluebell	I got some garbage before I checked that
2016-10-20 09:24:03		[09:24]

2016-10-20 09:25:22	gtao	why use limiter if it cuts off frequencies? isn't compressor alone enough?

2016-10-20 09:26:52	bluebell	a limiter is like a compressor with infinite ratio. It can be used to make sure nothing goes above 0 dB
2016-10-20 09:26:52	gtao	is mod duo a kind of guitar pedal foot switcher?
2016-10-20 09:27:19	bluebell	gtao: it's a programmable stomp box with lots of plugins
2016-10-20 09:28:13	bluebell	I use a multiband limiter as the very last plugin in master, set it to -0.1 dB (to have a lil bit headroom)
2016-10-20 09:28:40	gtao	is there kind of additional midi controller for foot to have more pedals because sustain and sostenuto pedals are not enough

2016-10-20 09:33:32	gtao	i have read that limiter simply cuts off sounds louder than the set value while compressor lowers them down
2016-10-20 09:33:59	bluebell	not the whole truth
2016-10-20 09:34:11	bluebell	there is a threshold with both devices
2016-10-20 09:34:43	bluebell	a compressor lowers the amp factor above this threshold
2016-10-20 09:35:18	bluebell	a limiter doesn't allow anything being louder
2016-10-20 09:35:47	bluebell	so a limiter is basically a compressor set to unlimited compression

2016-10-20 09:38:36	gtao	anyway if the entire dymanic range is filled the limiter will have to cut out some frequences to match the smaller range which is set, he has to

2016-10-20 09:55:41	bluebell	a saturator MUST make artefacts because it's basically a distortion device
2016-10-20 09:55:47	gtao	or they say you should upsample to 96000
2016-10-20 09:56:06	bluebell	a compressor produces harmonics as well as it "bends" the signal
2016-10-20 09:56:27	bluebell	good plugins do oversampling if it's needed
2016-10-20 09:56:47	bluebell	the calf limiter has an oversampling setting
2016-10-20 09:57:01	gtao	so theoretically a good compressor/saturator must upsample internally to 96000 and return the jackd rate on its output
2016-10-20 09:57:15	bluebell	calf limiter can 4x oversampling
2016-10-20 09:58:06	bluebell	a saturator uses nonlinear processing by intent so of course there are harmonics. on purpose.

2016-10-21 00:43:36	bluebell	hi mrwick
2016-10-21 00:43:55	mrwick	needing an interface for multitrack mixing, recording. I think I"ll do the focusrite 1818vsl
2016-10-21 00:45:11	mrwick	although these new behringer products are better now that they bought Midas and such, it's still a brand I cannot bring myself to buy :-/
2016-10-21 00:45:52	bluebell	I have one simple interface from Behringer and it wan't 100% reliable. I prefer Focusrite
2016-10-21 00:46:45	bluebell	I have 2 2i2 and I am very happy with them. 100% reliable, even with many hours of continuous operation
2016-10-21 00:46:51	mrwick	I was contemplating the focusrite equivalent, it goes to 192! but it seems to be less reliable when it comes to GNU/Linux
2016-10-21 00:47:10	mrwick	oh, 2 of them! do you chain them together or something?
2016-10-21 00:47:34	bluebell	I tried with 96 kHz but I get the best results with 44.1/48. If you go for really low latencies it's much better at 48
2016-10-21 00:48:05	mrwick	yeah, 48 is enough for me. if I want higher I would rather invest in something really nice
2016-10-21 00:48:05		[00:48]
2016-10-21 00:48:12	bluebell	mrwick: I have 2 because I have a 2nd flat (shared with 2 guys) because of my workplace
2016-10-21 00:48:45	mrwick	bluebell: so you only use one at a time? I need at least 8 outputs for analog mixing
2016-10-21 00:49:07	bluebell	mrwick: and there is still http://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html

2016-10-21 00:49:37	bluebell	mrwick: since I need it only to record vocals (one by one) and listen to the stereo output I don't need more inputs
2016-10-21 00:50:30	mrwick	ah, I see. I'd love to get the 18i20 but it is unclear if it's as workable as the 1818vsl.
2016-10-21 00:50:47	 *	mrwick wonders if any shop would allow a test run with a linux laptop
2016-10-21 00:51:02	bluebell	I guess Thoman in Germany would allow it
2016-10-21 00:51:16	bluebell	Too bad Focusrite doesn't have a Linux Task Force
2016-10-21 00:52:00	mrwick	oh the Thomann shop in Germany might allow it?
2016-10-21 00:52:26	bluebell	I'd phone with them before, of course
2016-10-21 00:52:52	mrwick	yes, I'll make some phone calls to see who is friendliest towards the idea
2016-10-21 00:54:07	bluebell	Maybe they send you one with the option to return it if it doesn't work with Linux. Just call em and find out.

2016-10-21 08:31:46	dmbaturin	leebre: He was a heroin user, though, oddly, he didn't exactly choose to become a junkie. Like many people at the time, he got addicted to prescription opioid painkillers.
2016-10-21 08:32:27	dmbaturin	And he was rather upset that people would start using heroin to emulate him.
2016-10-21 08:33:14	leebre	okay, i thought miles was on heroine and the bird on amphetamine
2016-10-21 08:33:28	dmbaturin	If Miles is to be trusted, he was quite an asshole nonetheless, but at least he didn't advocate heroin use.
2016-10-21 08:33:34	edogawa	pretty all of them on heroine
2016-10-21 08:33:45	leebre	i readt themiles biography, there he tells that he was paied at age of maybe 19 or so, with heroine, after a gig, instead of money...

2016-10-21 16:08:19	 *	jpt9 got a contact mic in the mail today.
2016-10-21 16:08:35	jpt9	(Just a Korg CM200BK -- one of the cheapo $13 ones designed for tuners.  Seems to work reasonably well.)
2016-10-21 16:10:56	Septic_Gerkin	hey
2016-10-21 16:11:11	Septic_Gerkin	what will you use it for?
2016-10-21 16:11:50	jpt9	Clipping it to things and poking them with other things to see what sorts of noises I can get out of them?
2016-10-21 16:12:08	Septic_Gerkin	ah cool
2016-10-21 16:12:30	Septic_Gerkin	stainless steel bowls partly filled with water are fun
2016-10-21 16:12:55	jpt9	I think I might have an idea of why my Fast Track USB keeps making clicking noises when I start/stop playback in Audacity -- Audacity opens/closes the soundcard then.
2016-10-21 16:13:09	jpt9	And yeah -- that sort of thing, PVC pipes, spatulas, cookie sheets, etc.

2016-10-21 16:29:10	jpt9	How is Audacity talking to your soundcard?  Have you selected a hardware device, or is it using PulseAudio?

2016-10-21 16:33:49	rhydermike	jpt9: I got a cheapy contact mic. I wanted to use it try and record my electric guitar acoustically.
2016-10-21 16:33:49		[16:33]
2016-10-21 16:34:35	jpt9	rhydermike: Did you do anything else neat with it?
2016-10-21 16:35:49	rhydermike	jpt9: No. I couldn't get it around the body of the electric, so I took it apart. At that point it was difficult to maintain pressure to make it work. Ah well, it was cheap...
2016-10-21 16:36:03	jpt9	Ah.
2016-10-21 16:36:35	jpt9	I played with mine through my Zoom MS-70CDR effects pedal earlier.
2016-10-21 16:36:42	rhydermike	I might invest in a proper piezo electric setup for electric guitars. I'd love to be able to get acoustic tones for recording without making much noise.
2016-10-21 16:37:29	nstewart_	I had a set of ghost saddles on a guitar. They work. Removed them only because they didn't work with my MIDI converter.
2016-10-21 16:37:39	rhydermike	I'm a huge Depeche Mode fan, so I might have a go at hitting some metal things and recording to make samples with ti.
2016-10-21 16:37:41	rhydermike	it
2016-10-21 16:37:59	Septic_Gerkin	yeah they had a sampler phase
2016-10-21 16:38:02	nstewart_	they're much cooler mixed in with the magnetics at medium volumes than they are for solidbody faucoustic guitar though
2016-10-21 16:38:14	Septic_Gerkin	well, we all did back then
2016-10-21 16:38:15	rhydermike	nstewart_: Ah, that's the sort of thing I need. A bit of an investment for proper ones though.
2016-10-21 16:39:19	rhydermike	nstewart_: I like the sound of a real mic'ed up acoustic, but TBH, for pop style, the bright sound of a contact pickup system is good in some contexts.
2016-10-21 16:39:41	rhydermike	nstewart_: Fast setup would be welcome too.

2016-10-22 12:13:49	leebre	JackWinter cool, thank you
2016-10-22 12:14:20	JackWinter	i would have hoped to have a 4.8.3-rt package, but not yet there
2016-10-22 12:14:26	leebre	I wanted to say with 4.67, but now this next big update 4.8-rt2 with this dirty cow fix...
2016-10-22 12:14:47	leebre	there is no 4.8-rt2 yet
2016-10-22 12:14:53	JackWinter	at least it's at the same level as the main distro kernel
2016-10-22 12:14:59	leebre	why?? what are you waiting fro in rt3 ?
2016-10-22 12:15:41	JackWinter	well they brought 4.8.2-rt, but the COW fix is in 4.8.3-rt...
2016-10-22 12:15:50	JackWinter	bad timing i guess
2016-10-22 12:16:19	JackWinter	they ought to release exploits in the beginning of the week, not at the end...
2016-10-22 12:17:40	leebre	you put it in, perfect

2016-10-22 17:45:08	BTRider	Hey Thanks
2016-10-22 17:45:10	BTRider	was AFK
2016-10-22 17:45:24	BTRider	well it is kinda repetitive but it's a concept for kinda ukulele based meditation music
2016-10-22 17:45:56	BTRider	what did you think worked and didn't work as far as that goes Septic_Gerkin and dmbaturin? how does the uke mic sound?
2016-10-22 17:46:58	dmbaturin	Let me listen again, with this in mind.
2016-10-22 17:48:55	BTRider	it's really part of a longer thing that started out as just uke and then i threw some other instrumentation to test out accompaniment ...vibes/marimba and stuff but you could consider that part of a longer song...the original one is 10 minutes really and does a lot more arpeggios on uke whereas this section is mostly uke strumming with some accompanamient but sounds cool
2016-10-22 17:49:17	BTRider	basically this genre i'm coming up with is supposed to be a soothing antitode to modern life...and listen anytime you need to escape tc
2016-10-22 17:49:25	BTRider	s/tc/et
2016-10-22 17:49:29	BTRider	s/tc/etc even
2016-10-22 17:50:30	dmbaturin	I think the micing worked just fine.

2016-10-22 17:52:41	BTRider	uke is actually really hard to record i tried a ton of different mics on it before i got this thing

2016-10-22 17:53:38	dmbaturin	I don't think the idea would work for me though. It's not bad, but I just don't find repetitive music soothing, or relaxing, or anything else. For an escape, I need something I can be completely immersed in, romantic and improvisation-heavy varieties of jazz work best.
2016-10-22 17:54:12	dmbaturin	A lot of baroque is good too.
2016-10-22 17:54:54	BTRider	well most meitation music is very repetitive and this is probably more repetitive than it needs to be but it doesnt really have a melody in it yet
2016-10-22 17:55:09	BTRider	thats why i was workin with the various instrumentation to figure out what to put a lead on it with besides, say, flute
2016-10-22 17:55:53	dmbaturin	But then again, I just don't listen to anything as a background, if I do, I listen more or less intently.
2016-10-22 17:55:53		[17:55]
2016-10-22 17:56:02	BTRider	it probably worked better as medition music as just uke and drums actaully the 10 min version i could put it up in a bit if you want to hear it
2016-10-22 17:56:14	dmbaturin	And listening intently to repetitive music, you can guess how well it works. :)
2016-10-22 17:56:56	BTRider	it's not designed to be listened to intently tho
2016-10-22 17:57:04	BTRider	it's background ish music/ambient
2016-10-22 17:57:29	BTRider	your'e not meditating ON the music the music just doesn't distract from your meditation but makes you feel happy

2016-10-22 17:58:04	BTRider	i mean think about it, if you're meditating, you don't want a lot of chord changes or something so interesting it brings you out of your meditation
2016-10-22 17:58:50	BTRider	but the uke parts themselves were more interesting by themselves without the other instruments getting in the way but i'm experimenting with the stuff
2016-10-22 17:58:53	dmbaturin	If I'm meditating, I don't want a lot of sounds really. ;)
2016-10-22 17:59:30	BTRider	well maybe not but people who live in busy places need something to block out the sound it's pretty common to have meditation music and most of it is faux asian and heavy synth and flutes
2016-10-22 17:59:32	dmbaturin	I'm not saying this is how it works, or must work for everyone of course.
2016-10-22 17:59:39	BTRider	this is more organic and tropicalish
2016-10-22 18:00:09	BTRider	i dunno i'm going to run it past some of my yoga friends/musicians see what they think that's what i put it up for
2016-10-22 18:00:47	dmbaturin	BTRider: There once was a whole genre focused on fake polynesian.

2016-10-22 18:10:26	BTRider	but if you have any comments besides it's too repetitive that would be cool
2016-10-22 18:10:55	BTRider	but also you can listen to some other of my tunes the swing house is kinda interesting but also repetitive but all house music is shakedown is really good

2016-10-22 18:30:58	Septic_Gerkin	BTRider: i liked the instrumentation, recording and the basic groove
2016-10-22 18:31:20	Septic_Gerkin	i didn't like that it was basically just an 8-bar groove

2016-10-22 18:51:31	BTRider	maybe some break beats and some key change most techno isnt all that complexe
2016-10-22 18:52:28	Psychic_Bratwurs	yes there are no 'effects' in it yet
2016-10-22 18:52:35	Psychic_Bratwurs	i'm weak with that stuff
2016-10-22 18:53:53	BTRider	this is my only house tune let me know what you think of it osmpbot https://soundcloud.com/drphaser/swing-house
2016-10-22 18:53:53	osmpbot	[URL] No Title
2016-10-22 18:55:54	Psychic_Bratwurs	i love the chord progression at 1:12 - great
2016-10-22 18:56:01	Psychic_Bratwurs	wouldn't have thought of that
2016-10-22 18:56:25	Psychic_Bratwurs	it's a little like my stuff - good structure and musicality, decent choice of instruments
2016-10-22 18:56:42	BTRider	yeah that was a mistake at 1:12 but it actually is pretty cool
2016-10-22 18:56:57	BTRider	nominally it's Dm/Gm/Am but I went Dm/G/Gm/Am on that one
2016-10-22 18:57:33	BTRider	well some sexy girl that's a good singer said that she likes to sing to rap so I threw that together to see what she could do with it but I doubt she's even heard it yet
2016-10-22 18:57:57	Psychic_Bratwurs	3:04 mistake
2016-10-22 18:58:21	BTRider	yeah
2016-10-22 18:58:21		[18:58]
2016-10-22 18:58:28	Psychic_Bratwurs	is it on a keyboard with some chord-assistance accompanyment
2016-10-22 18:58:49	BTRider	but overall that tune was designed to be uke friendly and guitar lead friendly but i havent done either of that with that tune yet
2016-10-22 18:58:55	Psychic_Bratwurs	ah
2016-10-22 18:58:59	Psychic_Bratwurs	what is uke?
2016-10-22 18:59:05	BTRider	a ukulele
2016-10-22 18:59:07	Psychic_Bratwurs	ok
2016-10-22 18:59:21	Psychic_Bratwurs	do you have a xylophone or was that a sampled instrument?
2016-10-22 18:59:24	BTRider	the first track you heard was my uke
2016-10-22 18:59:30	BTRider	it's sampled
2016-10-22 19:00:21	BTRider	everything but the uke was sampled on the first track
2016-10-22 19:00:28	Psychic_Bratwurs	key
2016-10-22 19:00:34	Psychic_Bratwurs	i like that sound a lot
2016-10-22 19:00:49	BTRider	which sound?
2016-10-22 19:00:55	Psychic_Bratwurs	the xylophone
2016-10-22 19:01:01	Psychic_Bratwurs	or whatever it is
2016-10-22 19:01:30	BTRider	well it was a vibraphone at first and then it switched to marimba and a touch of xylophone before it went into the synthy fluty sound
2016-10-22 19:01:50	Psychic_Bratwurs	oh ok
2016-10-22 19:02:00	BTRider	but they are all pretty similar...they have a real vibraphone at my college and it's so amazing ot play a real one it's so relaxing i almost fell over playing it
2016-10-22 19:03:01	Psychic_Bratwurs	haha
2016-10-22 19:03:43	BTRider	they should come with a warning statement: DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL WHILE PLAYING THIS INSTRUMENT
2016-10-22 19:03:56	BTRider	couple martinis and a vibraphone it's concussion time
2016-10-22 19:04:30	BTRider	anyway xylophones are like vibraphones, they are made out of metal, but a vibraphone has resonator pipes and a deck that vibrates which is out of this world in real life
2016-10-22 19:05:10	BTRider	and a marimba is like a xylophone that is made of wood but sometimes they have resonators like vibraphones but not the vibrating thingy that vibrates the tone bars like a vibraphone has, but, i didnt use the vibrating sound on my thingy
2016-10-22 19:05:55	Psychic_Bratwurs	i played a marimba before
2016-10-22 19:06:19	Psychic_Bratwurs	i love them and vibraphones
2016-10-22 19:06:41	BTRider	yeah they just take a lot of space
2016-10-22 19:07:01	BTRider	at the college they have a 37 note vibraphone i've never seen one with 3 octaves like that before it's tight to play it
2016-10-22 19:07:19	BTRider	the tone bars are gold encrusted it's sick
2016-10-22 19:07:54	Psychic_Bratwurs	nice

2016-10-23 09:43:29	contrapunctus	foot mics also amplify the sound of feet...e.g. if you're walking on the wooden platforms used for the sets, and you don't step carefully...
2016-10-23 09:43:35	dmbaturin	contrapunctus: An interesting variation I've seen: overhead mics. I bet it's a nightmare to do right, but the result was decent.

2016-10-23 09:44:47	contrapunctus	My best experience with this auditorium on one school, which had hanging (overhead) mics. Really consistent, even coverage. But it worked only because the stage was short in height (like 10 meters). In most other auditoriums I know of, the mics would /have/ be visible...which would ruin the visuals...

2016-10-23 09:48:28	contrapunctus	Another place - small space, no vocal amplification needed, just a mic for a guitar and a line out for sfx
2016-10-23 09:49:27	contrapunctus	And if it were any instrument other than a guitar, it probably wouldn't need amplification either.
2016-10-23 09:50:26	dmbaturin	Yeah, my "must be a nightmare to do right" remark was mostly about even coverage for larger stages, but hanging them so that they don't look obtrusive must be even more challenging.
2016-10-23 09:53:45	dmbaturin	I probably wouldn't mind, but then again, I see theater as art rather than entertainment and come for the acting.

I guess past some quality level nothing but player can make a really dramatic difference in sound.
2016-10-23 10:18:27	flexus	hope i had the right terms gg
2016-10-23 10:19:32	dmbaturin	contrapunctus: Yes, I was going for something like classical theme and variations, but I was too afraid of making a big piece.

2016-10-23 10:22:25	contrapunctus	dmbaturin: hm...then, I'm afraid it didn't get there. The differences between the variations aren't obvious enough.

2016-10-23 10:22:57	dmbaturin	Yeah, in a small piece, I was too afraid to introduce big variations. Maybe I shouldn't be though.

2016-10-23 11:22:14	dmbaturin	BTRider: Well, it's arguably one of the harder woodwinds. It requires lots of breath support to play the full range and it tends to produce a squeak or hiss rather than bad but musical sound if you are doing it wrong; ring keys over open holes need quite some finger precision; there are way too many keys under the pinkies; and it overblowth a twelfth (compound fifth) rather than octave meaning you have absolutely different ...
2016-10-23 11:22:20	dmbaturin	... fingerings in every register. Saxophones are easier, they have the same fingerings in both registers, they have no open holes, and larger instruments are generally more forgiving (except soprano, which is reportedly just as unrelenting as clarinet).

2016-10-23 11:23:31	dmbaturin	Also, both register key and the thumb hole are operated by, well, thumb, sometimes individually and sometimes together.
2016-10-23 11:27:56	BTRider	ic
2016-10-23 11:28:22	BTRider	well, what is the easiest woodwind to play that has dynamics if I move on from recorder?
2016-10-23 11:28:43	orngjce223	I'd recommend flute, but that's also the only woodwind I actually know, so
2016-10-23 11:29:21	dmbaturin	Another annoying thing is two keys and one hole operated by the left index finger. Bb4 is played with one of the index keys pressed, and B4 is all fingeroles closed plus register key plus one pinky key. I spent quite some time before I managed to get it right, lol.
2016-10-23 11:29:25	BTRider	which kind of flute and how easy is that to play?
2016-10-23 11:29:48	orngjce223	(The guy in charge of my school orchestra told everyone that clarinet had several of the same fingerings as saxophone. I think this was a ploy to get _anyone at all_ to play clarinet.)
2016-10-23 11:29:48	BTRider	my keyboard has a pretty tasty flute sound ive been playing
2016-10-23 11:29:59	dmbaturin	Flute is nice, the embouchure is quite subtle though, and it has no register keys to aid overblowing...
2016-10-23 11:30:46	orngjce223	Yeah the mouthstuff is tricky, but is transferrable to blowing bottles and such]
2016-10-23 11:30:51	BTRider	well i started with recorder to work on fingering first and its not all that easy to play it without squeakes..plus one of my favvorite songs (peaches en regalia) is all recorders for the wind section afaik
2016-10-23 11:30:51	contrapunctus	BTRider: why worry about ease of playing...pick the one whose sound you like best...
2016-10-23 11:31:04	 *	contrapunctus would love to learn clarinet
2016-10-23 11:31:04		[11:31]
2016-10-23 11:31:15	BTRider	contrapunctus: I'm old and need relatively instant gratiication and I already play half a dozen instruments
2016-10-23 11:31:28	contrapunctus	hm...
2016-10-23 11:31:57	dmbaturin	But yeah, if you love it enough, you can go through any ordeals, and if not, the annoying woodwind things may be too annoying.
2016-10-23 11:31:59	BTRider	but no winds so i want an easyish wind that would pair well with ukulele
2016-10-23 11:32:02	contrapunctus	(even in my choice, it's not just the sound but also the fact that it's nearly impossible to find a clarinet player here, whereas sax is quite popular...)
2016-10-23 11:32:25	BTRider	right its always hard to find clarinet playes but i like that sound better but sax destroyed the clarinet
2016-10-23 11:32:50	BTRider	there are more cello players than clarinet it seems
2016-10-23 11:32:54	contrapunctus	and, heya orngjce223 . quite rare to see you in non-lurkerdom :)
2016-10-23 11:33:03	orngjce223	yeah it's been a while
2016-10-23 11:33:03	dmbaturin	BTRider: Sax can be a good choice. It's easier to play badly, so to speak.
2016-10-23 11:33:27	contrapunctus	BTRider: cello is another instrument I'd like to learn, for the same reason - very few players (and the players that are there, are super busy)
2016-10-23 11:33:40	orngjce223	I haven't been doing much music tbh, I used the last year or so to write a tabletop RPG worldbook instead
2016-10-23 11:34:18	dmbaturin	contrapunctus: I still think we should tour India with a clarinet and accordion (or cello) duo, for the novelty value of both. ;)
2016-10-23 11:34:28	contrapunctus	dmbaturin: lol!
2016-10-23 11:34:36	contrapunctus	accordion...waaaaaaaaaaant.
2016-10-23 11:35:01	contrapunctus	I swear if there was someone here I could learn accordion making + repair + playing from, I'd ditch guitar in an instant.
2016-10-23 11:35:26	contrapunctus	but right now the main focus is to start performing solo, start earning a living.
2016-10-23 11:35:46	orngjce223	so, you know. If any of you know what Homestuck is
2016-10-23 11:36:06	contrapunctus	orngjce223: oh, so 'worldbook' is some RPG term, not the name of the RPG I thought you made :D
2016-10-23 11:36:33	orngjce223	yeah it's an add-on pack with an alternate setting and a bunch of new rules and stuff
2016-10-23 11:36:43	contrapunctus	orngjce223: I'm somewhat interested in RPGs (but can never find players, and now not the time either), and JazzyEagle is an RPG fanatic
2016-10-23 11:37:21	orngjce223	The actual system it's for is Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine (abbr CMWGE)
2016-10-23 11:37:36	dmbaturin	contrapunctus: The school where I'm learning clarinet has accordion majors. Geographical distribution of instruments is sure strange.
2016-10-23 11:38:40	dmbaturin	Well, art schools for kids also invariably have accordion teachers.
2016-10-23 11:38:47	contrapunctus	dmbaturin: daaaaamn *expression a mixture of sorrow and awe*

2016-10-23 11:41:31	contrapunctus	even here, where most people don't know what an accordion is (but have seen it in some old film or the other), when I tell them about me wanting to play it, they're like "oh you want to play THAT?" (disdain)

2016-10-23 11:52:24	dmbaturin	My point is, when your financial situation improves, it's a question if you'll find it a worthy investment, the cheapest oboes are like $1k, ones with complete keywork are easily $2k and above, and reedmaking is not cheap either. For bassoons, multiply everything by 2.

2016-10-25 07:47:54	BTRider	i just want to be able to add cool title to videos anyone know how to do that?

2016-10-25 07:48:40	edogawa	pifie: ardour can't edit video, just sound while running the video in sync and showing a timeline and monitor window
2016-10-25 07:49:13	BTRider	i was thinking this whole womens equality thing is merely a technological innovation that they are "equal" to men at say desk jobs
2016-10-25 07:49:28	BTRider	if society reverted back to farming/no tech, women would not at all be equal
2016-10-25 07:49:46	BTRider	therefore womens equality is pretty much a fantasy what do you think of that logic?

2016-10-25 12:53:02	Stuzz	As I understand, you created the Ardour MIDI mapping for the Axiom 61, right?
2016-10-25 12:53:05	edogawa	hi Stuzz
2016-10-25 12:53:19	Stuzz	I got one recently, so you have my thanks
2016-10-25 12:53:37	edogawa	yeah i think so, i took the Axiom 49 one and modified it IIRC
2016-10-25 12:53:53	edogawa	welcome
2016-10-25 12:54:38	Stuzz	One question I had...  I don't suppose you know is there's some method to move the bank of tracks that the faders work on?
2016-10-25 12:54:50	Stuzz	s/is/if
2016-10-25 12:55:23	Stuzz	Perhaps you didn't look into such things, and as you say, just tweaked and existing map?

2016-10-25 12:55:38	edogawa	yeah
2016-10-25 12:56:01	edogawa	i basically just extended it to fit the 61
2016-10-25 12:57:01	edogawa	and it's so long ago i don't really remember
2016-10-25 12:57:45	edogawa	currently i hardly ever use my MIDI equipment, life's taken different direction for now
2016-10-25 12:58:08	Stuzz	OK, no problem
2016-10-25 12:58:32	Stuzz	I also hardly ever use it, and am still working out what it can do :)

2016-10-25 13:49:47	Stuzz	[22:53:02] As I understand, you created the Ardour MIDI mapping for the Axiom 61, right? [22:53:02]

2016-10-25 13:49:47	Stuzz	[22:55:23] Perhaps you didn't look into such things, and as you say, just tweaked and existing map? [22:55:23]

2016-10-25 13:49:47	edogawa	[22:57:01] and it's so long ago i don't really remember [22:57:01]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	edogawa	[22:57:45] currently i hardly ever use my MIDI equipment, life's taken different direction for now [22:57:45]

2016-10-25 17:57:04	catbadger	[20:46:23] and other places [20:46:23]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Defcronyke	[20:46:35] hmm, i must have noticed you somewhere at some point then [20:46:35]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	catbadger	[20:46:49] :) i use it in some forums as well [20:46:49]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Defcronyke	[20:51:47] Hi DNS, I heard you had some trouble keeping up with the hostilities of the internet the other day... [20:51:47]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	DNS	[20:52:19] w0rd [20:52:19]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Defcronyke	[20:59:14] if anyone is interested, we have released an open source real-time audio reactive camera filter for the release of our debut album, but you could use it with any of your favourite music or sounds, not just with our music: https://unique-result-840.appspot.com/webgl2/webcam_mic1 [20:59:14]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	osmpbot	[20:59:14] [URL]  Audio Reactive Camera Filter for Ellipsis by Telephone Sound | telephonesound.com [20:59:14]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Defcronyke	[21:00:17] the source code for it is here: https://github.com/defcronyke/telephone-sound-ellipsis/blob/master/default/static/webgl2/webcam_mic1/shaders/filter1.fsh [21:00:17]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	osmpbot	[21:00:18] [URL] telephone-sound-ellipsis/filter1.fsh at master · defcronyke/telephone-sound-ellipsis · GitHub [21:00:18]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Defcronyke	[21:03:07] it is a visual filter which rewards your eyes for making music we like ;) [21:03:07]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	catbadger	[21:07:37] neat [21:07:37]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	catbadger	[21:45:07] Defkronyke I'm impressed [21:45:07]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Defcronyke	[21:46:10] thanks catbadger [21:46:10]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Defcronyke	[21:46:14] pls share it [21:46:14]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Defcronyke	[21:50:32] catbadger, we are also running an open challenge for visual artists or programmers/computer scientists which is involving the filter. You may be interested since you seem to be a programmer: https://steemit.com/music/@telephonesound/telephone-sound-contest [21:50:32]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	osmpbot	[21:50:32] [URL] No Title [21:50:32]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	catbadger	[21:53:03] cool [21:53:03]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	catbadger	[21:53:16] If i weren't at work and had social media I'd share it. [21:53:16]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	catbadger	[21:53:17] ;) [21:53:17]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	catbadger	[21:53:35] I'm not allowed to share form work [21:53:35]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	catbadger	[21:53:52] probably not allowed irc, but forvigvness vs prermission, right? [21:53:52]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Defcronyke	[21:54:10] share it later then if you want to [21:54:10]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	edogawa	[22:48:34] catbadger: yep, near Vienna, about 25 km outside the city [22:48:34]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Stuzz	[22:52:40] Ahh edogawa.  Hello [22:52:40]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Stuzz	[22:53:02] As I understand, you created the Ardour MIDI mapping for the Axiom 61, right? [22:53:02]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	edogawa	[22:53:05] hi Stuzz [22:53:05]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Stuzz	[22:53:19] I got one recently, so you have my thanks [22:53:19]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	edogawa	[22:53:37] yeah i think so, i took the Axiom 49 one and modified it IIRC [22:53:37]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	edogawa	[22:53:53] welcome [22:53:53]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Stuzz	[22:54:38] One question I had...  I don't suppose you know is there's some method to move the bank of tracks that the faders work on? [22:54:38]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Stuzz	[22:54:50] s/is/if [22:54:50]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Stuzz	[22:55:23] Perhaps you didn't look into such things, and as you say, just tweaked and existing map? [22:55:23]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Stuzz	[22:55:27] an* [22:55:27]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	edogawa	[22:55:38] yeah [22:55:38]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	edogawa	[22:56:01] i basically just extended it to fit the 61 [22:56:01]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	edogawa	[22:57:01] and it's so long ago i don't really remember [22:57:01]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	edogawa	[22:57:45] currently i hardly ever use my MIDI equipment, life's taken different direction for now [22:57:45]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Stuzz	[22:58:08] OK, no problem [22:58:08]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Stuzz	[22:58:32] I also hardly ever use it, and am still working out what it can do :) [22:58:32]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	SquidChild	[23:14:08] yes one should enjoy life [23:14:08]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Frog-Nog	[23:15:02] you know, like egg-nog [23:15:02]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	catbadger	[23:22:30] Thanks again for the knowledge and free conversation edogawa [23:22:30]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	catbadger	[23:22:35] I'm outie for hte day [23:22:35]

2016-10-26 01:47:50	dmbaturin	I was thinking of trying yesod, but haven't gotten to it so far.
2016-10-26 01:49:09	JazzyEagle	It's not the easiest thing in the world to understand.  The guy who wrote it is very smart and uses a lot of TemplateHaskell, which sucks in terms of trying to figure out what Types you're using, as a lot of typing is templated.
2016-10-26 01:50:18	JazzyEagle	The basics are really well documented, but anything above and beyond the basics, you have to read the code to figure out what's going on.
2016-10-26 01:51:05	dmbaturin	Yeah, that's what always bothers me about TemplateHaskell. OCaml's extension systems are purely syntactic at least (and PPX is restricted to specific extension points which makes it powerful enough to be practical but not confusing).
2016-10-26 01:52:11	JazzyEagle	Yeah.  I thought about learning OCaml and seeing what web options they have, but I figured if I start getting somewhere with this and I can convince contrapunctus to help (if he ever shows up again), he'd not be willing to learn another language.  hehe

2016-10-26 02:45:27	JazzyEagle	And I'd like listeners to be able to rate them (I was thinking 5 stars), and the radio playlist be automated but also accept requests.
2016-10-26 02:46:09	JazzyEagle	gcrk: I'm working up to the point of figuring out how to do it, but I know that the song files can either be directly in the database or hosted statically.

2016-10-26 02:46:44	JazzyEagle	My initial thought was to use mpd as the radio server with multiple threads for multiple streams (different streams for different genres)

2016-10-26 02:54:57	gcrk	this way you can write a script which adds a "suggest" button to jamendo for your radio station \o/
2016-10-26 02:55:07	JazzyEagle	gcrk: I'm still working out all of the details, but Jamendo was definitely a big inspiration for what I was thinking.

2016-10-26 02:56:25	JazzyEagle	Right now, I'm trying out a website library for Chicken Scheme called Awful to see if I can set it up the way that I want.  If not, I may go back to Haskell and see what website libs they have outside of Yesod, because I'm not a fan of Yesod.
2016-10-26 02:56:52	JazzyEagle	Thanks!  If you know how to code, I could use help.  I'm still in investigation phase, so I could always switch languages, if you don't know Scheme.

2016-10-26 03:21:51	leebre	yesterday i went to a bar and drank beer till four, attention, its osm related, i think
2016-10-26 03:21:51		[03:21]
2016-10-26 03:22:19	leebre	before i updated to latest kenerl 4.8.2-rt3
2016-10-26 03:22:52	leebre	on three machines, on one, something went badly wrong, but wasnt the kernel, maybe just bad luck
2016-10-26 03:23:49	leebre	the errormessage i tracked down...openbug, everything okay, regression , happened in the past onsome kernels,maybe ? hehehe dontknow, just sayin
2016-10-26 03:24:02	leebre	now back, to drinking til 4,
2016-10-26 03:24:22	leebre	much drank, only some hours sleep, dizzy, headache
2016-10-26 03:25:26	leebre	but evenin this state, before i smoked my first ...joint....i made it, needless to say that i am a user,no abilities in anything related
2016-10-26 03:26:44	leebre	what i want to say, i dontknow...why lets agree here i amnot a wunderkind and you all start using arch linux exclusively
2016-10-26 03:27:00	leebre	and  openrc
2016-10-26 03:27:10	leebre	and jack1
2016-10-26 03:27:55	leebre	you will see, i know how good you all are, in one year, we have every thing fixed, ehm...you have it fixed...
2016-10-26 03:28:34	dmbaturin	JazzyEagle: CPython is a bytecode compiler, there are other implementations that are JIT, not nearly as popular due to completness issues. Anyway, binary is not always "too binary" today either. Go is even less "binary" than say Java as it's not only mandatory GCed, but also keeps a lot of type information at runtime (and fails to make good use of it, lol).
2016-10-26 03:29:49	leebre	edited the aur user build script.....cut out so many stuff, iam suprised that its working, i dont need the headers, and the doc filesm except i want to build another rt kernel or buildkernelmodule
2016-10-26 03:30:15	leebre	dvbt, wifi, nvidia, all cut out...i dont need it, zap zap

2016-10-26 03:32:44	JazzyEagle	You just love torturing me with Micro$uck stuff, doncha?
2016-10-26 03:32:52	leebre	could it be that sfz support in carla is disabled at the moment by default at build time....?
2016-10-26 03:33:01	JazzyEagle	I'm less tortured by JVM, though I do try to avoid anything Java related.
2016-10-26 03:33:11	dmbaturin	Well, in all honesty... Whatever I think of MS, .Net machine implements tail recursion... JVM still does not.
2016-10-26 03:33:44	JazzyEagle	leebre: I doubt it.  SFZ is handled through a LinuxSampler plugin.
2016-10-26 03:34:12	leebre	linuxsampler is woring, did it like ever
2016-10-26 03:34:13	dmbaturin	It doesn't exactly make me love .Net, it may just be an argument against JVM, depending on your perspective. :)
2016-10-26 03:34:19	JazzyEagle	I know at one point you had to install the SVN version of LS, as the SFZ code was not in the production version, but I think they fixed that...
2016-10-26 03:34:33	JazzyEagle	dmbaturin: I'd rather avoid both of them, honestly.
2016-10-26 03:35:15	leebre	til now, i could allways build with linuxsampler, not the svn version,  edited the build script
2016-10-26 03:35:26	dmbaturin	Oracle is no better than MS. I love the idea of an open, cross-platform VM and ecosystem, but at this point, neither of those is one.

2016-10-26 04:12:12	dmbaturin	I seriously don't get those free software only distros. Even debian with its sensible model can be a royal pain in the butt when the hardware needs non-free firmware blobs, and you can't proceed with installation unless you get it elsewhere, and load.

2016-10-26 04:12:33	gcrk	but you did not accept the answer
2016-10-26 04:13:06	JazzyEagle	dmbaturin: It's for folks who are trying to support/endorse libre software by ONLY using it.  I did break down and installed Google Chrome for Nextflix and Flash, but everything else is pure libre.
2016-10-26 04:13:25	dmbaturin	Between non-free and non-working, the choice is kinda obvious; and if you have a machine that doesn't need those, well, they don't need to be installed.
2016-10-26 04:13:59	leebre	chrome is opensource i think
2016-10-26 04:14:02	leebre	chromium
2016-10-26 04:14:12	gcrk	chromium yes, google chrome not
2016-10-26 04:14:12	JazzyEagle	leebre: Chromium is (to a point), Chrome is NOT.
2016-10-26 04:14:29	leebre	netflix and flash, yes...skype and pulseaudio...okay...
2016-10-26 04:14:44	dmbaturin	JazzyEagle: Yeah, but, no one makes one install it even in distros that do include non-free software in the repos, and you can query license info before installing.
2016-10-26 04:14:45	JazzyEagle	I don't even have Skype installed.
2016-10-26 04:14:50	leebre	i would then try to run it in a sandbox, really
2016-10-26 04:15:20	JazzyEagle	No, but if you have a distro with only repo software, that helps deter one from installing non-libre software, especially if they're not very familiar with what is libre and what isn't and wants to get a feel for it.
2016-10-26 04:15:49	JazzyEagle	I'm not sitting here trying to indicate anyone MUST use a libre-only distro, mind you, I'm just saying that I wanted to try it to see if I could use only libre software.
2016-10-26 04:15:55	gcrk	JazzyEagle: i like your decision, how is your distro called again?
2016-10-26 04:15:59	leebre	i dont think i have so much non libre software here
2016-10-26 04:16:02	JazzyEagle	It was a personal decision, and I have no issues with distros with non-libre software.
2016-10-26 04:16:05	leebre	do not know...

2016-10-26 04:16:31	leebre	again , i think chromium is opensource andlibre, or am i wrong ?
2016-10-26 04:16:41	dmbaturin	leebre: Chrome isn't.
2016-10-26 04:16:49	JazzyEagle	dmbaturin: And that's totally fine.  I'm not trying to convince you to change.  Just explaining my personal reasons for making the choice.
2016-10-26 04:17:17	JazzyEagle	leebre: chromium doesn't have Flash & Netflix capabilities.
2016-10-26 04:17:19	leebre	i said chromium, it is a difference
2016-10-26 04:17:37	gcrk	dmbaturin: why is a only libre distro a technical solution for a social problem?
2016-10-26 04:17:39	leebre	yes
2016-10-26 04:17:45	JazzyEagle	Pepper Flash can be installed, but I don't think Pepper is 100% libre itself.

2016-10-26 04:18:55	leebre	i would use then , as i said a virtual machine, zap zap, and would sandbox it
2016-10-26 04:19:05	gcrk	JazzyEagle: i sure i could do this, its just harder, right?
2016-10-26 04:19:17	dmbaturin	gcrk: If the problem is that people don't understand free vs. non-free, suggesting that they use a libre-only distro is a technical solution to a people problem. The fundamental flaw is that there is no single definition of free.
2016-10-26 04:20:02	dmbaturin	I can imagine how a BSD fan might want a system free of _GPL_ software too, because he thinks GPL restricts his freedom.
2016-10-26 04:20:21	JazzyEagle	gcrk: harder than...  ?

2016-10-26 04:21:42	gcrk	JazzyEagle: i know. but i can install software which is not libre even on parabola i guess
2016-10-26 04:21:51	JazzyEagle	In fact, you could conceivably switch to Parabola without even reinstalling.  I believe Parabola has some sort of script that'll check your system for non-free software and ask you to remove them.
2016-10-26 04:21:55	gcrk	so there are non-libre options to choose
2016-10-26 04:22:13	JazzyEagle	gcrk: Yes, you can, but those options are from teh AUR.  They're not directly in the Parabola repos.
2016-10-26 04:22:13		[04:22]
2016-10-26 04:22:32	gcrk	right. so there are options, but not as easy as installing a package from the repo
2016-10-26 04:22:41	leebre	you can run bsd in a virtualmachine in arch openrc too, what ever you like...just install arch openrc first

2016-10-26 04:23:48	gcrk	i guess parabola is good to reflect on his own. i could setup it and built my system, install what i need and on any point i will find a software which is non libre. on arch i would get this information without any personal effort
2016-10-26 04:24:02	leebre	i do, really, i take your advuce serious, sorry

2016-10-26 04:29:00	dmbaturin	gcrk: Well, I have used both. The real point is that there are many areas where BSD is still problematic especially on desktop, and there is no debate. I would like to see it improved.
2016-10-26 04:30:03	gcrk	dmbaturin: i used it on desktop, what is problematic for you?
2016-10-26 04:30:32	leebre	sfz support in carla works here on to machines, on the third, this one, it worked before, now there is no sfz support anymore as it seems
2016-10-26 04:30:36	leebre	two machines
2016-10-26 04:30:46	gcrk	dmbaturin: and this problem comes from the userbase. i guess there are just a few people using it on a desktop...
2016-10-26 04:31:02	dmbaturin	Hardware support and audio, for instance.
2016-10-26 04:31:05	gcrk	dmbaturin: like linux 5 or 10 years ago
2016-10-26 04:32:15	dmbaturin	Well, it's not doing all that better with a lot of server applications either. I'm very enthusiastic about bhyve, but it's a decade late to the party.
2016-10-26 04:33:28	dmbaturin	It's good to see it done, and I like bhyve really, don't get me wrong.
2016-10-26 04:33:35	gcrk	dmbaturin: its to small for pretty special stuff, i know this. but i like it because of the license and some stuff, eg the packaging system

2016-10-26 04:42:51	dmbaturin	gcrk: Until some point it was nearly as popular for web servers as linux, and I think that diversity was great.
2016-10-26 04:43:51	dmbaturin	Personally I make sure my stuff works on anything POSIX-compatible unless it has a really good reason not to, but de facto linux-only software is increasingly common, and it worries me.
2016-10-26 04:44:30	pifie	posix is a good idea
2016-10-26 04:44:49	pifie	but the pressure to make things 'happen', well, brings about problems
2016-10-26 04:45:01	pifie	the pressure for something to be 'perfect', brings problems too
2016-10-26 04:45:06	pifie	it's a matter of how high the bar
2016-10-26 04:45:35	dmbaturin	With growing disparity, however, it gets troublesome. Quagga is commited to support all platforms equally, but it means that it only supports relatively small part of linux because linux is the only system to implement PBR, or network namespaces, or...
2016-10-26 04:46:35	dmbaturin	* I think some work on PBR is being done in FreeBSD, but that's way more than a decade late to the party, and Juniper et al. are not going to share theirs.

2016-10-26 06:17:00		[06:11]
2016-10-26 06:18:44	catbadger	Why would you make your music open source?
2016-10-26 06:19:46	catbadger	I've been contemplating releasing some open source music to be used in video games as a way to garner more attention for the music I am trying to sell.
2016-10-26 06:19:56	catbadger	but other than that, I'm just curious about motivation
2016-10-26 06:23:05	JazzyEagle	catbadger: obviously, everyone's answers could be different.  For me personally, I more wish for my music to be heard (if I could ever find time to record it, that is).  I'm not so concerned with making money off of it.  I want to write it and share it because it's fun for me.
2016-10-26 06:23:35	JazzyEagle	And if others want to use my music, I want them to have the freedom to do so without a ton of contracts and royalties and stuff that gets in the way of simply sharing good music.

2016-10-26 11:40:39	JazzyEagle	shiihs: I wasn't pleasantly surprised.  It made my ideas seem ...  underdeveloped.
2016-10-26 11:41:39	shiihs	oh? so do I understand correctly that you didn't like it because the results were too good? :D

2016-10-26 11:42:11	JazzyEagle	The results from everyone were awesome.
2016-10-26 11:42:25	shiihs	i especially liked the diversity
2016-10-26 11:42:33	JazzyEagle	Definitely.
2016-10-26 11:43:05	bomb	So, buddies. Which distro you're on?
2016-10-26 11:43:19	JazzyEagle	bomb: I'm using Parabola.
2016-10-26 11:43:43	bomb	"Derived from Arch" hmm.
2016-10-26 11:43:48	shiihs	i'm using arch now, because of JazzyEagle... and after all the trouble i went through he switched to parabola :o
2016-10-26 11:44:02	JazzyEagle	lol
2016-10-26 11:44:14	JazzyEagle	Parabola is just Arch with libre-only repos.
2016-10-26 11:44:24	shiihs	nah... just kidding... it was a very smooth install (apart from some stress about choosing partition sizes)
2016-10-26 11:44:34	JazzyEagle	Of course, we still have access to the AUR to install non-libre software, which I ended up doing for Google Chrome, because I'm a TV junkie.
2016-10-26 11:44:55	JazzyEagle	But that's the only non-libre software I have...  That I'm aware of.

2016-10-26 11:45:43	shiihs	does anyone know why it takes arch forever to package ardour 5 - is it buggy?
2016-10-26 11:46:00	shiihs	i mean it's probably available in some testing repository
2016-10-26 11:46:00		[11:46]
2016-10-26 11:46:04	shiihs	but not in the main one
2016-10-26 11:46:44	JazzyEagle	Not sure, shiihs.  This is very unusual.  We could probably send an e-mail to the e-mail list.  It's uusally pretty active.
2016-10-26 11:46:58	bomb	Preparing a "mainstream" distro for audio stuff is that annoying?
2016-10-26 11:47:38	shiihs	it took me a while to get pulse and jack to work together, but other than that i haven't really had major problems
2016-10-26 11:47:48	JazzyEagle	bomb: No, Arch repos are usually pretty cutting/bleeding edge.  Things are usually tested and added much quicker than this, sometimes even same day as release.
2016-10-26 11:47:57	JazzyEagle	This is very unusual for Arch.
2016-10-26 11:48:33	bomb	Hmm. I feel I'm unlucky for using Ubuntu 16.04

2016-10-26 11:50:30	bomb	Aside from packages, do you need to do considerable amount of work to get kernel and stuff working the way you want?
2016-10-26 11:51:23	JazzyEagle	bomb: For most standard usage, no.  Many of the non-standard things (such as realtime kernels) have build scripts, so that, even though it can take awhile build, doesn't require you to perform it all yourself.
2016-10-26 11:52:12	bomb	Hmm.

2016-10-26 11:56:29	shiihs	you'll probably be fine with a stock kernel
2016-10-26 11:56:40	JazzyEagle	Yeah, I don't think realtime kernel would be needed for that.

2016-10-26 11:57:23	JazzyEagle	Some people even think that the lowlatency kernel or even the standard kernel is good enough for pro audio these days.  I still personally find improved latency with the realtime kernel compared to the other two.
2016-10-26 11:57:29	JazzyEagle	It really depends on the hardware you got.

2016-10-26 13:03:03	pifie	bomb: I have a usb condenser
2016-10-26 13:03:26	pifie	I would have chosen a non-usb mic if I were you, it's more versatile
2016-10-26 13:04:09	bomb	I already have one, for years. I never used it because I never bought a cable for it.
2016-10-26 13:04:28	bomb	And then I switched to laptop, and my audio interface was a PCI one.
2016-10-26 13:05:19	bomb	So I just ordered this one, $40 on eBay, though I paid about twice for shipping and tax stuff.
2016-10-26 13:06:12	bomb	I thought of buying a cheap audio interface to use my existing condenser. But then I'll miss the portability of this USB mic.

2016-10-27 05:32:25	JazzyEagle	Hey, e's good!!
2016-10-27 05:32:46	catbadger	So I'm looking at a new vocal mic. my AKG880 is kind of thin. Will I get a better sound from a sm58?
2016-10-27 05:34:02	JazzyEagle	It's been a long time since I've gotten to use a bunch of different mics.  A lot of times, for vocal recordings, most people choose to use condensers instead of dynamic mics.  Not saying dynamics don't work or something, but I've generally heard a warmer tone with condensers.
2016-10-27 05:34:27	JazzyEagle	Of course, part of that could be the type of pre-amp that's being used w/ the mic, but the mic itself has a part to play in the warmth as well.
2016-10-27 05:36:19	JazzyEagle	catbadger: If you can afford a little more, I recall AT2020's & AT2035's sounding pretty good.  I just recently bought a Blue Encore 100, that I seem to like (though haven't bean able to do more than play with it a bit, haven't recorded anything yet), which is the first mic I personally have owned.
2016-10-27 05:36:39	JazzyEagle	I also remember the Rode NT-1[A] sounding really well as well.

2016-10-27 05:37:04	JazzyEagle	Of course, you may want to ask Ricardus as well, as he's done professional recording before and is a lot more knowledgeable on mics than I am.
2016-10-27 05:37:48	JazzyEagle	Not sure if he's around ATM, though.
2016-10-27 05:38:24	catbadger	k
2016-10-27 05:38:26	catbadger	thank you
2016-10-27 05:38:31	JazzyEagle	Yep.
2016-10-27 05:38:43	catbadger	I am looking for that warmer tone for sure
2016-10-27 05:39:12	catbadger	the preamp is my soundboard
2016-10-27 05:39:14	catbadger	XD
2016-10-27 05:39:27	catbadger	lol
2016-10-27 05:39:29	JazzyEagle	I know the big thing about mics is the natural EQ they provide, so if you're good enough with EQ, you can generally warm up or brighten the tone just be EQ, but the thing about good mics is that they do the EQing naturally for you, so you don't have as much work to do in post-production.
2016-10-27 05:39:34	catbadger	I also have a nanoverb
2016-10-27 05:39:48	catbadger	Wow. that was well said

2016-10-27 05:41:15	JazzyEagle	I'm sure there's more to a good mic than just that, but that's the big thing I know.
2016-10-27 05:42:02	catbadger	I'm kind of not much of a gearhead tbh. I just need enough to get my ideas out
2016-10-27 05:42:28	catbadger	you rock Jaz! thanks so much for your input.

2016-10-27 17:07:25	pifie	[23:58:34] I can see what I can do [23:58:34]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	klopsi-u3	[23:58:46] it's one of the greatest anti-authority songs of the past 30 years [23:58:46]

2016-10-27 17:07:25	pifie	[23:59:53] no problem [23:59:53]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	pifie	[00:00:14] my rice and beans are one of the greatest anti-throat meals of the past 3 years [00:00:14]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	pifie	[00:00:22] got a little too carried away with the pepper [00:00:22]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	klopsi-u3	[00:00:36] rice and beans are a great combination [00:00:36]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	pifie	[00:02:53] nutritional value 100% [00:02:53]

2016-10-27 17:07:25	Stuzz	[00:05:29] I thought there was little nutrition in rice [00:05:29]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	pifie	[00:18:23] Stuzz: you have to eat beans WITH rice [00:18:23]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	pifie	[00:18:28] beans alone are not enough [00:18:28]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	pifie	[00:18:44] klopsi-u3: Pass me both the singed part and the background track [00:18:44]

2016-10-27 17:07:25	pifie	[00:49:30] okay, you made it more difficult for me [00:49:30]

2016-10-28 01:23:22	l33nux	i am not doing it anymore because i want to help the osm scene, but it is against my opinions...i am not looking at warez anymore, that said, there are news in this area that have influences on the whole wide world
2016-10-28 01:24:23	l33nux	if a certain copy protection is  100% hacked and cracked, a new dynamic starts,  a new area beginns, ...not for the users of warezed software but for every one on this planet
2016-10-28 01:25:46	l33nux	it is a race, now all software that releis on the freshly hacked copy protection will be warezed - though new copy protections are getting developped and companies tryin to build on these new protections
2016-10-28 01:27:00	l33nux	i think, though i am not talking about that anymore, because i am not interrested and i dont need those stuff anymore, i am still thinking hackers and craking groups are havin huge impact on the whole world, on humanity...
2016-10-28 01:27:47	l33nux	i am not supporting these, i am not advertising, suggesting or implying anything...i am just sayin, those people are havin impact on humanity
2016-10-28 01:27:55	l33nux	like linux and opensource...
2016-10-28 01:28:57	rghvdberg	still the vast majority of 'normal' users know nothing of linux/opensource
2016-10-28 01:29:16	rghvdberg	which is a petty
2016-10-28 01:29:27	rghvdberg	cause it's awesome
2016-10-28 01:30:06	rghvdberg	used to warez everything, then I got tired of it because it didn't work right, didn't feel right
2016-10-28 01:30:26	rghvdberg	and then there was linux .. and my life changed

2016-10-28 01:31:36	rghvdberg	is kinda generalizing ;-)

2016-10-28 02:29:19	JazzyEagle	We keep our butter in the fridge anyway, so it's not easy to spread, and I'd rather her not use the microwave without supervision anyway.

2016-10-28 02:42:58	dmbaturin	In that it's refreshingly free of antiquated design features found in elisp or CL, or even a lot of other languages that came after it.
2016-10-28 02:43:40	JazzyEagle	Yeah, I guess.
2016-10-28 02:48:27	dmbaturin	It's pretty ironic that a language from the 70's has full closures, while most languages designed later don't, though.
2016-10-28 02:49:08	JazzyEagle	Not sure what closures are.  I know I read up on 'em before, but I can't keep all the terminology straight.
2016-10-28 02:55:00		[02:49]
2016-10-28 02:55:45	dmbaturin	JazzyEagle: makeIncrementer x = let step = x in (+) step -- the canonical example. What it returns is (+) together with an environment where step is bound to x set at evaluation time.
2016-10-28 02:57:52	JazzyEagle	That classic example doesn't make much sense to me.  Not sure why it's not just makeIncrementer x = (+) x
2016-10-28 02:58:07	JazzyEagle	Seems a little bit cleaner.
2016-10-28 02:58:20	dmbaturin	Well, I made it wordy for not saying "where x is bound to x" :)

2016-10-28 03:01:42	dmbaturin	Either way, in most languages if you want to store a function together with an environment, in a predictable way, you need an object. Nothing wrong with objects per se of course, but you can make an object system on top of closures, while the opposite is not quite true.

2016-10-28 04:58:12	JazzyEagle	dmbaturin: It's a maze that is made out of corn field...  After they harvest the corn, they mow down the corn plants in certain spots, effectively making a maze with the remaining corn plants.
2016-10-28 04:58:16	ssj71	dmbaturin: here in the US some farmers will plant their corn with certain rows missing which creates a maze that people can walk through

2016-10-28 05:00:19	holstein	when im playing a "jazz" gig with someone, and they are starring at one of those books? i know its going to be a long night

2016-10-28 05:01:13	holstein	it would be like, carrying reference books, and dictionaries, and phrase books to a hang with friends ;)
2016-10-28 05:01:29	dmbaturin	holstein: Well, I would never take it to a gig. Implying I'll ever get a gig, but that's another question. ;)
2016-10-28 05:01:38	holstein	you would just be starring at books, saying *very* nice sentences.. but, just not one's that are relevant to the current conversation

2016-10-28 05:04:08	holstein	he was starring at some fakebook app, on his phone.. and he just plowed through the bridge, in the wrong place.. and, it took *quite* a few choruses, for me to get his attention and get him back on track, before the singer came back in
2016-10-28 05:04:24	holstein	basically, just reading the ink, incorrectly, without listening to the conversation

2016-10-28 05:39:11	pifie	Well, if you are answered 'I follow X', then that is irrational for sure
2016-10-28 05:39:25	NeoFrontier	If a person chooses evil over good there is no rational explanation for it, because it is irrational by nature.
2016-10-28 05:39:26	pifie	For example X being 'true constructive ways', or 'destructive ways'

2016-10-28 05:39:40	NeoFrontier	such a choice.
2016-10-28 05:39:41	pifie	Those are just particular choices, can't be backed up by enough evidence to make them rational
2016-10-28 05:39:47	NeoFrontier	is irrational.
2016-10-28 05:39:53	NeoFrontier	Ungodly.
2016-10-28 05:39:54	NeoFrontier	earthly
2016-10-28 05:39:57	NeoFrontier	deadly
2016-10-28 05:39:59	pifie	Evil and good are not contradictory
2016-10-28 05:40:03	NeoFrontier	detrimental.
2016-10-28 05:40:11	pifie	Paradise for the spider is hell for the locust
2016-10-28 05:40:39	pifie	To follow what philosophers of old said: Nothing that has a contrary has substance.
2016-10-28 05:40:59	pifie	if you can do that, you can go to ##philosophy
2016-10-28 05:41:05	pifie	I'm already there
2016-10-28 05:42:41	NeoFrontier	People who isolate themselves from truth and good ways and thinking have chosen.
2016-10-28 05:42:43	NeoFrontier	evil.
2016-10-28 05:43:16	pifie	You can think you choose whatever you want. That doesn't make you so
2016-10-28 05:43:39	pifie	For example, suppose I choose to be evil, and in order to fulfill that, I go around tickling people to annoy them
2016-10-28 05:43:47	pifie	But the people happen to like it, unbeknownst to me
2016-10-28 05:43:56	pifie	It's not so easy, NeoFrontier, you are just projecting wishes

2016-10-28 11:26:20	l33nux	[21:04:38] holstein you are right [21:04:38]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:04:48] im currently dealing with this, locally.. with BMI and the jobs i play [21:04:48]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	l33nux	[21:05:02] again, its here about my fears never beeing able to listen to some stuff again, ever [21:05:02]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	l33nux	[21:05:05] but you are right [21:05:05]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	Defcronyke	[21:05:14] holstein, have you considered getting the fans to pay you directly? [21:05:14]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	l33nux	[21:05:18] i am for a fair free world, i do not want to steal, right [21:05:18]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:05:25] if i play at a local venue? i have *no* way of reporting my material that *is* licensed through BMI.. *i* should get that income [21:05:25]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:05:52] but, what does happen? BMI asks a club for a monthly fee, that *doesnt* go to the artists that created the material i am performing [21:05:52]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:06:04] and, usually, they just stop having live music.. [21:06:04]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	Defcronyke	[21:06:20] holstein, you are enabling BMI to be a middle-man for you when it's irrelevant [21:06:20]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:06:26] Defcronyke: sure.. again. this is not *me* specifically.. i dont expect personally youtube revenue [21:06:26]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:06:48] im talking about that person that *does*.. that, when i download their video, and play it locally, they are not getting that, anymore.. [21:06:48]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:07:13] Defcronyke: i tried using them, yes.. but, there is no way for that system to work, in either case [21:07:13]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	Defcronyke	[21:07:44] so what do you need them for then? PR? [21:07:44]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:07:50] Defcronyke: im *not* able to "enable" BMI in either case, to specifically collect revenue based on the material that is being performed.. [21:07:50]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	Defcronyke	[21:07:51] getting gigs? [21:07:51]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	Defcronyke	[21:08:12] idk man, I'm just saying it might be better to be paid directly [21:08:12]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:08:20] sure. and i do [21:08:20]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:08:50] but, when BMI hassles the local venue? that *is* paying me? directly? and really just wants a tax, thats not what they say they do [21:08:50]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:09:05] Defcronyke: if its like a "tax". like, a liquor tax, thats fine [21:09:05]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:09:27] but, i should be able to be turning in the material i perform, so, revenue goes where it is needed to go.. [21:09:27]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	Defcronyke	[21:10:43] holstein, if you like getting money from ad revenue, good luck with that. in my limited experience, ad revenue isn't much for some reason, even though running ads costs a fortune... [21:10:43]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	Defcronyke	[21:11:08] it is really the ad networks which win in that case [21:11:08]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:11:20] its not really a "live music" tax, though.. its intended to cover intellectual properties.. and, in order to do that.. the actual intellectual properties should be able to be identified.. [21:11:20]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:11:20] since, its not like that.. what happens is, a bill shows up, where i am playing, for basically, randomly assumed material, that  *i* cant ask about.. since, im not the venut.. [21:11:20]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:11:24] and, they just fire the band.. thus, i lose the job [21:11:24]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:11:32] Defcronyke: again.. i dont [21:11:32]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:12:04] Defcronyke: im not a youtube ad revenue person.. im only talking from that perspective.. saying that, if you consider it to be *not* stealing? that fine.. its still taking cash from that person [21:12:04]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	Defcronyke	[21:12:50] then the country who taxes its citizens through piracy fees should give the tax revenue directly to the artists whos material was "pirated" [21:12:50]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:13:04] right [21:13:04]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	Defcronyke	[21:13:05] i am speaking of an ideal case of course [21:13:05]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:13:12] but, that is *not* built into that system [21:13:12]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	Defcronyke	[21:13:27] the system will have to change, because it's not working currently [21:13:27]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:13:35] right [21:13:35]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:13:58] and, thats what im communicating about.. starting at the top, with the creator of the content, and choosing content that i think *might* support the model, better.. [21:13:58]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:14:09] if we all were doing that, as a community.. then, it would change.. [21:14:09]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	Defcronyke	[21:14:20] okay holstein, you start first [21:14:20]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:14:28] right [21:14:28]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:14:29] i am [21:14:29]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	Defcronyke	[21:14:54] good :) [21:14:54]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:16:43] im *also*, as a consumer, working towards this.. [21:16:43]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:18:02] but, whomever *is* getting that revenue? currently? from the piracy tax? and the bills that show up when im playing my music? etc? those folks will want it to stay the way it is [21:18:02]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:18:14] they are accepting income that is not earned by them.. and thats a pretty nice deal [21:18:14]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	Defcronyke	[21:18:29] holstein, but they can't really justify those actions, so they will fail soon enough [21:18:29]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:18:47] they dont need to [21:18:47]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	holstein	[21:18:56] and, its been in place for a long time [21:18:56]

2016-10-28 12:28:13	l33nux	[21:05:05] but you are right [21:05:05]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	Defcronyke	[21:05:14] holstein, have you considered getting the fans to pay you directly? [21:05:14]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	l33nux	[21:05:18] i am for a fair free world, i do not want to steal, right [21:05:18]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:05:25] if i play at a local venue? i have *no* way of reporting my material that *is* licensed through BMI.. *i* should get that income [21:05:25]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:05:52] but, what does happen? BMI asks a club for a monthly fee, that *doesnt* go to the artists that created the material i am performing [21:05:52]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:06:04] and, usually, they just stop having live music.. [21:06:04]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	Defcronyke	[21:06:20] holstein, you are enabling BMI to be a middle-man for you when it's irrelevant [21:06:20]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:06:26] Defcronyke: sure.. again. this is not *me* specifically.. i dont expect personally youtube revenue [21:06:26]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:06:48] im talking about that person that *does*.. that, when i download their video, and play it locally, they are not getting that, anymore.. [21:06:48]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:07:13] Defcronyke: i tried using them, yes.. but, there is no way for that system to work, in either case [21:07:13]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	Defcronyke	[21:07:44] so what do you need them for then? PR? [21:07:44]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:07:50] Defcronyke: im *not* able to "enable" BMI in either case, to specifically collect revenue based on the material that is being performed.. [21:07:50]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	Defcronyke	[21:07:51] getting gigs? [21:07:51]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	Defcronyke	[21:08:12] idk man, I'm just saying it might be better to be paid directly [21:08:12]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:08:20] sure. and i do [21:08:20]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:08:50] but, when BMI hassles the local venue? that *is* paying me? directly? and really just wants a tax, thats not what they say they do [21:08:50]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:09:05] Defcronyke: if its like a "tax". like, a liquor tax, thats fine [21:09:05]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:09:27] but, i should be able to be turning in the material i perform, so, revenue goes where it is needed to go.. [21:09:27]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	Defcronyke	[21:10:43] holstein, if you like getting money from ad revenue, good luck with that. in my limited experience, ad revenue isn't much for some reason, even though running ads costs a fortune... [21:10:43]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	Defcronyke	[21:11:08] it is really the ad networks which win in that case [21:11:08]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:11:20] its not really a "live music" tax, though.. its intended to cover intellectual properties.. and, in order to do that.. the actual intellectual properties should be able to be identified.. [21:11:20]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:11:20] since, its not like that.. what happens is, a bill shows up, where i am playing, for basically, randomly assumed material, that  *i* cant ask about.. since, im not the venut.. [21:11:20]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:11:24] and, they just fire the band.. thus, i lose the job [21:11:24]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:11:32] Defcronyke: again.. i dont [21:11:32]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:12:04] Defcronyke: im not a youtube ad revenue person.. im only talking from that perspective.. saying that, if you consider it to be *not* stealing? that fine.. its still taking cash from that person [21:12:04]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	Defcronyke	[21:12:50] then the country who taxes its citizens through piracy fees should give the tax revenue directly to the artists whos material was "pirated" [21:12:50]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:13:04] right [21:13:04]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	Defcronyke	[21:13:05] i am speaking of an ideal case of course [21:13:05]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:13:12] but, that is *not* built into that system [21:13:12]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	Defcronyke	[21:13:27] the system will have to change, because it's not working currently [21:13:27]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:13:35] right [21:13:35]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:13:58] and, thats what im communicating about.. starting at the top, with the creator of the content, and choosing content that i think *might* support the model, better.. [21:13:58]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:14:09] if we all were doing that, as a community.. then, it would change.. [21:14:09]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	Defcronyke	[21:14:20] okay holstein, you start first [21:14:20]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:14:28] right [21:14:28]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:14:29] i am [21:14:29]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	Defcronyke	[21:14:54] good :) [21:14:54]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:16:43] im *also*, as a consumer, working towards this.. [21:16:43]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:18:02] but, whomever *is* getting that revenue? currently? from the piracy tax? and the bills that show up when im playing my music? etc? those folks will want it to stay the way it is [21:18:02]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:18:14] they are accepting income that is not earned by them.. and thats a pretty nice deal [21:18:14]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	Defcronyke	[21:18:29] holstein, but they can't really justify those actions, so they will fail soon enough [21:18:29]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:18:47] they dont need to [21:18:47]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:18:56] and, its been in place for a long time [21:18:56]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	l33nux	[21:18:58] bye holstein... [21:18:58]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	l33nux	[21:19:01] �/ [21:19:01]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[21:19:05] l33nux: o/ [21:19:05]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	l33nux	[21:19:10] laters [21:19:10]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	frinknet_	[22:11:58] holstein: getting caught up on the PRO discussion. Are you BMI then? Why BMI instead of ASCAP? [22:11:58]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[22:19:31] frinknet_: its really just *some* bodies of work that i have chosen to do through BMI [22:19:31]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	holstein	[22:19:41] basically, where i *had* to.. or, others were involved.. [22:19:41]

2016-10-28 12:59:22	frinknet_	holstein: I see. I'm leaning towards ASCAP myself
2016-10-28 12:59:52	frinknet_	I've avoided PROs for 15 years but I think it's about time to commit. :-)
2016-10-28 13:02:14	holstein	i havent gotten anything from them, so far
2016-10-28 13:02:31	holstein	and, i get quite a run-around ,trying to speak with someone at BMI
2016-10-28 13:02:57	holstein	i had an ex girlfriend who got roses from someone at BMI
2016-10-28 13:03:20	frinknet_	Heh
2016-10-28 13:03:29	frinknet_	that's kinda what I've heard about them
2016-10-28 13:03:46	frinknet_	their algorithm favors the famous
2016-10-28 13:04:57	holstein	right.. but, it shouldnt be an algorithm? right?
2016-10-28 13:07:29	frinknet_	That's why I'm thinking ASCAP
2016-10-28 13:07:33	frinknet_	;-)
2016-10-28 13:08:38	holstein	well, *they* dont get back to me, either

2016-10-28 13:09:05	holstein	when i say "hello.. where are the forms where, as an artist, i turn in the factual information about the music im peforming live?"
2016-10-28 13:09:09	holstein	i dont get anything
2016-10-28 13:11:48	frinknet_	I talked to their Lawyers about 15 years ago. That's when I decided I wanted nothing to do with them. I also hate the way they strong arm venues and kill the live music scene
2016-10-28 13:12:56	holstein	thats where im caught
2016-10-28 13:13:09	holstein	i mean, *thats* how i make my income
2016-10-28 13:13:09		[13:13]
2016-10-28 13:13:16	frinknet_	I know. Hate that!
2016-10-28 13:13:39	holstein	so, when i have a job, then, the folks that are *supposed* to be for musicians? or IP.. somehow knock me out of work?
2016-10-28 13:13:41	holstein	thats odd
2016-10-28 13:13:52	holstein	its counterintuitive. and challenging to communicate about
2016-10-28 13:14:09	frinknet_	BMI is much more aggressive towards venues than ASCAP. Although ASCAP has a goon squad too
2016-10-28 13:14:13	holstein	you can see how it went earlier, here. and thats basically just getting a similar footing on the facts
2016-10-28 13:14:30	holstein	frinknet_: what i find, BMI has *always* been the first
2016-10-28 13:14:54	frinknet_	Yes BMI started the whole thing
2016-10-28 13:14:59	holstein	when i try and communicate with either, they say, im not the venue, and they dont speak to the artists
2016-10-28 13:15:08	holstein	but, the artists need to be stating what they are playing..
2016-10-28 13:15:09	frinknet_	It's interesting t read how and why the whole PRO thing came about
2016-10-28 13:15:20	holstein	if im playing *my* music? i can give the venue rights to that..
2016-10-28 13:15:36	holstein	if im playing *my* music? and its licensed with BMI? and they are paying? *i* should get that
2016-10-28 13:16:04	holstein	its challenging.. no one really wants to try and "get by" with anything wrong..
2016-10-28 13:16:07	holstein	not in my findings..
2016-10-28 13:16:30	holstein	BMI will drop off a bill for like 6 years of music... for something like 50 grand
2016-10-28 13:16:39	holstein	the place of course shits their pants..
2016-10-28 13:16:40	frinknet_	I like the way that SNOCAP and SoundExchange are handling digital much better than the terrestrial first gen PRO
2016-10-28 13:16:49	holstein	its gotta change
2016-10-28 13:16:57	holstein	and, i have a challenging time communicating with folks about it
2016-10-28 13:17:08	holstein	even locally.. i know, i have been actively vocal about it on FB
2016-10-28 13:17:12	frinknet_	holstein: The 50k bill is why I think of BMI as one of the big devils.
2016-10-28 13:17:17	holstein	i'll ping BMI and ascap in posts
2016-10-28 13:17:21	holstein	no response..
2016-10-28 13:17:45	holstein	and, in many cases, one artist will be like "oh, we need them representing us, the venue should pay!"
2016-10-28 13:18:08	holstein	and, im not saying the venue shouldnt pay.. they should have the option of paying for what is played..
2016-10-28 13:18:15	holstein	frinknet_: anyways.. i have a question for you
2016-10-28 13:18:22	frinknet_	I'm ready to give away my venue plays. Heck even radio isn't worth the hassle if it kills the industry...
2016-10-28 13:18:29	frinknet_	Shoot! :-)
2016-10-28 13:18:38	holstein	when i think about it, more like a liquor license, it adds up better "as-is"..

2016-10-28 13:19:07	holstein	when you think about a liquor license, some group or groups of "shareholders" or whatever, get that cash.. its not going to the people creating the drink
2016-10-28 13:19:18	holstein	maybe thats more what we are looking at? in some way?
2016-10-28 13:20:11	frinknet_	It is a tax that is collected by several private corporations which are filing their taxes as non-profit corps.
2016-10-28 13:20:32	frinknet_	It's EXTREMELY crooked
2016-10-28 13:20:45	holstein	seems like it
2016-10-28 13:20:59	frinknet_	That's why Lawrence Lessig got together with his pals t Harvard and came up with the Creative Commons
2016-10-28 13:21:11	holstein	but,  at least, when i think about it more like the liquor license, im not wondering why the *actual* IP getting performed isnt seeing the cash

2016-10-28 13:21:53	holstein	its when i collaborate with folks that get nervous about folks "stealing" their music
2016-10-28 13:21:54	frinknet_	Musicians haven't owned much of their own IP for 80+ years!!!

2016-10-28 13:22:16	holstein	id just check out the model, and try and emulate..
2016-10-28 13:23:28	frinknet_	The whole "stealing" thing is a farce among respectable musicians. It's the labels that use legal loopholes to steal.

2016-10-28 13:23:48	holstein	right?
2016-10-28 13:24:14	holstein	thats why im careful not to necessarily state it as preventing, or needing to prevent "theft" of a physical product
2016-10-28 13:24:18	holstein	like, that downloaded youtube vid
2016-10-28 13:24:18	frinknet_	The "stealing" is all in the IP realm. And BMI, ASCAP, SESAC and the rest WILL NOT protect you from true music theft.
2016-10-28 13:24:44	holstein	its not about protecting that video. its about that person that uploaded it, and is expecting, and needing me to watch it, according to those terms, to try and make income
2016-10-28 13:25:17	holstein	is that a good way to make income? or sustainable? or "good" at all? thats all debatable. but, the fact is.. that person is expecting that income, and if i dont follow that system, they dont get it
2016-10-28 13:25:57	frinknet_	holstein: in order to answer the question on where it broke and how to fix it you have to go back about 200 years and map out the growth and change of the music industry asking "why" at every turn
2016-10-28 13:26:18	holstein	yeah.. "copyright"..

2016-10-28 13:27:42	frinknet_	I think that there is definitely a place for mechanical licensing - that part is fair. Sync licensing on YouTube is following a similar model. All other licensing of music IP is generally corrupted (with few exceptions in between)
2016-10-28 13:28:09	holstein	i think they (google) are trying to break it..
2016-10-28 13:28:09		[13:28]
2016-10-28 13:28:24	holstein	make it more like BMI.. an algorithm determines.. etc
2016-10-28 13:28:35	holstein	who knows.. i cant keep up with all that news..

2016-10-28 13:30:22	frinknet_	holstein: their distribution models are run by greedy bastards. But the IP licensing side is built by programmers who understand open source and the importance of attribution and the need for simple compensation based on such attribution
2016-10-28 13:31:20	frinknet_	But the whole ads side of Google is designed like the insurance racket: Tell them you pay everyone and then make excuses why that doesn't apply in your case.
2016-10-28 13:33:18	holstein	yeah..
2016-10-28 13:33:23	frinknet_	Sir-Mix-A-Lot is one example where it's laughable (I'm privy to his numbers) - He's made about .0001 cents per play. At that rate it's not even worth signing up for artist compensation - or at least you shouldn't expect much from it
2016-10-28 13:33:26	holstein	and, we just comply
2016-10-28 13:33:32	holstein	most folks dont understand what any of it means
2016-10-28 13:33:49	frinknet_	Patreon is a great answer to this whole system
2016-10-28 13:34:07	holstein	maybe
2016-10-28 13:34:19	holstein	i think, there is an odd stigma around that..
2016-10-28 13:35:09	frinknet_	I'd say that Patreon + StageIt + SoundExchange + negotiating good sync placement deals is the future of the music industry
2016-10-28 13:35:32	frinknet_	holstein: what stigma? - I've never seen anything about a stigma
2016-10-28 13:35:39	holstein	yeah?
2016-10-28 13:36:10	holstein	as in, its a bit unprofessional seeming, in the current market
2016-10-28 13:36:43	holstein	like, if you had an actual business model, you would just shop it properly..
2016-10-28 13:36:53	holstein	if you were worth a shit, you'd just get a record deal.. et
2016-10-28 13:36:56	holstein	etc*
2016-10-28 13:37:10	holstein	i mean, im not agreeing with that perspective.. just saying how it can *seem*, in comparison
2016-10-28 13:37:27	holstein	"why is it free?" "must be, they cant sell it, its so bad".. etc
2016-10-28 13:37:44	frinknet_	Patreon goes back 200 years and re-implements the economic model that has worked for several millennia up until the advent of fast travel and music recording
2016-10-28 13:38:17	holstein	sure.. removing the media BS, and bias..
2016-10-28 13:38:41	holstein	its not bad, in my opinion.. just *so* different..
2016-10-28 13:38:45	frinknet_	The truth is there are more professional buskers than any other type of professional musicians. They don't get filthy rich but they make enough to play another day.

2016-10-28 13:39:40	frinknet_	I was a pro busker for a while. I payed my rent and met a ton of cool peeps
2016-10-28 13:40:18	holstein	i have done it a bit..
2016-10-28 13:40:45	holstein	its getting more realistic here, that a person could do it, professionally
2016-10-28 13:40:49	holstein	a few do.. but, just a few

2016-10-28 13:43:09	frinknet_	Now I'm in the most exclusive set of pro musicians (studio producer) and I'm finally in a place where the PRO could be advantageous to my business process. Most don't realize who gets payed for what. Artist have never made much from the PRO payout. Merch sales have always been more lucrative than performance licensing.

2016-10-28 13:46:55	frinknet_	Basically, the new music industry that seems to work well without labels or all of this funny business all revolves around YouTube.
2016-10-28 13:47:38	frinknet_	You busk on YouTube with Patreon as your "hat". You amass a fanbase that becomes an email list.
2016-10-28 13:48:39	frinknet_	Then you begin to do "concerts" online through StageIt YouTube Live or something else where you can get a cut of "admission"
2016-10-28 13:49:26	frinknet_	It follows the same model as the new movie consumption paradigm shift that happened with Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Video
2016-10-28 13:50:06	frinknet_	The live concert still makes money the traditional way. But how you plan the tour changes to include demographic analytics from these online sources.
2016-10-28 13:50:52	frinknet_	It's like Boggles said and MTV echoed: "Video killed the radio star"
2016-10-28 13:51:21	frinknet_	Being a "good musician" has become synonymous with taking good selfies!
2016-10-28 13:51:47	frinknet_	Anyhow. I gotta get. I'll be back on sometime Sunday.

2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:27:42] I think that there is definitely a place for mechanical licensing - that part is fair. Sync licensing on YouTube is following a similar model. All other licensing of music IP is generally corrupted (with few exceptions in between) [23:27:42]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:28:09] i think they (google) are trying to break it.. [23:28:09]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:28:24] make it more like BMI.. an algorithm determines.. etc [23:28:24]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:28:35] who knows.. i cant keep up with all that news.. [23:28:35]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:29:14] frinknet_: i listen to "hello internet" podcast, that is entertaining.. they are youtube'ers professionally, and discuss, occassionally.. [23:29:14]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:30:22] holstein: their distribution models are run by greedy bastards. But the IP licensing side is built by programmers who understand open source and the importance of attribution and the need for simple compensation based on such attribution [23:30:22]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:31:20] But the whole ads side of Google is designed like the insurance racket: Tell them you pay everyone and then make excuses why that doesn't apply in your case. [23:31:20]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:33:18] yeah.. [23:33:18]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:33:23] Sir-Mix-A-Lot is one example where it's laughable (I'm privy to his numbers) - He's made about .0001 cents per play. At that rate it's not even worth signing up for artist compensation - or at least you shouldn't expect much from it [23:33:23]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:33:26] and, we just comply [23:33:26]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:33:32] most folks dont understand what any of it means [23:33:32]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:33:49] Patreon is a great answer to this whole system [23:33:49]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:34:07] maybe [23:34:07]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:34:19] i think, there is an odd stigma around that.. [23:34:19]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:35:09] I'd say that Patreon + StageIt + SoundExchange + negotiating good sync placement deals is the future of the music industry [23:35:09]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:35:32] holstein: what stigma? - I've never seen anything about a stigma [23:35:32]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:35:39] yeah? [23:35:39]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:36:10] as in, its a bit unprofessional seeming, in the current market [23:36:10]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:36:43] like, if you had an actual business model, you would just shop it properly.. [23:36:43]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:36:53] if you were worth a shit, you'd just get a record deal.. et [23:36:53]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:36:56] etc* [23:36:56]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:37:10] i mean, im not agreeing with that perspective.. just saying how it can *seem*, in comparison [23:37:10]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:37:27] "why is it free?" "must be, they cant sell it, its so bad".. etc [23:37:27]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:37:44] Patreon goes back 200 years and re-implements the economic model that has worked for several millennia up until the advent of fast travel and music recording [23:37:44]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:38:17] sure.. removing the media BS, and bias.. [23:38:17]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:38:41] its not bad, in my opinion.. just *so* different.. [23:38:41]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:38:45] The truth is there are more professional buskers than any other type of professional musicians. They don't get filthy rich but they make enough to play another day. [23:38:45]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:39:09] they make more than i do, for sure [23:39:09]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:39:15] but, so does the valet.. [23:39:15]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:39:40] I was a pro busker for a while. I payed my rent and met a ton of cool peeps [23:39:40]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:40:18] i have done it a bit.. [23:40:18]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:40:45] its getting more realistic here, that a person could do it, professionally [23:40:45]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:40:49] a few do.. but, just a few [23:40:49]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:43:09] Now I'm in the most exclusive set of pro musicians (studio producer) and I'm finally in a place where the PRO could be advantageous to my business process. Most don't realize who gets payed for what. Artist have never made much from the PRO payout. Merch sales have always been more lucrative than performance licensing. [23:43:09]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:45:05] cool [23:45:05]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	holstein	[23:45:15] frinknet_: congrats on that.. [23:45:15]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:45:40] Finally doing sessions here at Crittenden Street! About damn time! :-P [23:45:40]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:46:55] Basically, the new music industry that seems to work well without labels or all of this funny business all revolves around YouTube. [23:46:55]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:47:38] You busk on YouTube with Patreon as your "hat". You amass a fanbase that becomes an email list. [23:47:38]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:48:39] Then you begin to do "concerts" online through StageIt YouTube Live or something else where you can get a cut of "admission" [23:48:39]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:49:26] It follows the same model as the new movie consumption paradigm shift that happened with Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Video [23:49:26]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:50:06] The live concert still makes money the traditional way. But how you plan the tour changes to include demographic analytics from these online sources. [23:50:06]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:50:52] It's like Boggles said and MTV echoed: "Video killed the radio star" [23:50:52]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:51:21] Being a "good musician" has become synonymous with taking good selfies! [23:51:21]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:51:47] Anyhow. I gotta get. I'll be back on sometime Sunday. [23:51:47]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	frinknet_	[23:51:51] CHeers! [23:51:51]
2016-10-28 22:16:44	jim	[23:52:52] how would you compare that to composition/songwriting? [23:52:52]

2016-10-28 22:29:33	holstein	[23:25:17] is that a good way to make income? or sustainable? or "good" at all? thats all debatable. but, the fact is.. that person is expecting that income, and if i dont follow that system, they dont get it [23:25:17]

2016-10-29 04:09:30	holstein	yup
2016-10-29 04:09:33	holstein	its the same notes, and all
2016-10-29 04:09:59	holstein	i usually suggest learning to sight-sing, or internalize the pitches, and sounds, rather than, just memorizing some finger placement
2016-10-29 04:10:27	holstein	with many instruments, finger placement can be more relative, anyway.. i find students get a little distracted with "what is this note name?" on guitar
2016-10-29 04:10:42	holstein	its like, just put your damned finger where the pitch you want happens.. who gives a shit what its called ;)

2016-10-29 04:15:16	holstein	its more about, relatively, which "E" to play, in context.. for example
2016-10-29 04:15:32	holstein	a friend just explained it a bit like having 6 pianos ;)
2016-10-29 04:15:54	dmbaturin	Ah, I thought you mean not knowing the note name when playing by ear.
2016-10-29 04:16:14	holstein	you cant just learn where to put your finger to get the "E" note.. could be lots of reasons, per case, and per player, why one would prefer one placement over another
2016-10-29 04:16:57	dmbaturin	That's my problem with those "systems" for memorizing the fretboard, like "CAGED" or whatever.
2016-10-29 04:17:10	holstein	all im saying is, if i look at the page, and see a note on the staff, and i have a sound in mind, and i put my finger where that sound is, thats *quicker*  than abstracting that out to a letter name, and waiting for my mind to then, figure out the places on the fingerboard where those letter names live, and choose one
2016-10-29 04:17:23	holstein	its quicker to just work with the sound i want, and use the language..
2016-10-29 04:17:31	holstein	it matters not that im playing an E..
2016-10-29 04:17:42	holstein	E is just what we call it.. and i can certainly refer to it as E..
2016-10-29 04:17:52	holstein	but, is that helpful? or fast? or relevant?
2016-10-29 04:18:07	holstein	i mean, even with your guitar and your clarinet.. your E's are different sounds

2016-10-29 04:19:54	dmbaturin	I told a bunch of freshmen string players about the way transposing in truments work lately. They were a bit surprised.

2016-10-29 04:20:29	dmbaturin	contrapunctus: Well, they just didn't know about the concept, yet.
2016-10-29 04:20:56	contrapunctus	dmbaturin: 'lately'?
2016-10-29 04:21:14	dmbaturin	A few days ago. Why?
2016-10-29 04:22:24	contrapunctus	ah, "you told them lately", rather than "the way transposing works [is different] lately".
2016-10-29 04:23:20	contrapunctus	transposing instruments are kind of an alien concept when you first come across them
2016-10-29 04:24:32	holstein	i mean, when you think about how you use your language, the spoken one.. when you want your computer, or a book, we dont conceptualize the given names for them.. we dont stop and spell the word "computer" in our minds
2016-10-29 04:24:32		[04:24]
2016-10-29 04:24:59	holstein	you just think of what you want, and go get it.. no need to abstract that want out into a proper name, like "computer", and then, figure out, around you, which of the items matches the term "computer"...
2016-10-29 04:25:24	holstein	thats more what im talking about.. internalizing the language, rather than just "playing by ear"..
2016-10-29 04:26:53	contrapunctus	hey, holstein . what's the musical equivalent of that, to "conceptualize the given names for them"?
2016-10-29 04:27:22	holstein	i have no idea
2016-10-29 04:27:34	holstein	im not quoting from some method book ;) im just talking about what works for me
2016-10-29 04:27:55	holstein	rather than "oh, there is an E, let me then, look and see where the E's are on my instrument, and choose one
2016-10-29 04:27:56	holstein	its more about doing it more like we read
2016-10-29 04:28:32	holstein	we dont focus on *each* little letter.. we can skim, and get the gist.. etc.. *thats* more what written languages are for
2016-10-29 04:28:32	holstein	we think of notation more like a recording.. and its not that..

2016-10-29 04:28:43	holstein	its more like a guide, or an outline
2016-10-29 04:29:09	holstein	there are *always* liberties to be taken.. you cant just learn where all the notes are, and all the note durations and start making music ;)
2016-10-29 04:30:06	holstein	its more about learning what those *phrases* mean, and the intention.. the resolutions.. and seeing them, in context, and understanding the larger sections, quickly.. so that we are *not* just looking at the E on the staff, and finding that E on an instrument, and plucking or striking or tooting it
2016-10-29 04:30:15	holstein	we can program computers to do that ;)
2016-10-29 04:31:06	holstein	what we can do is *much* better.. analyzing intention, and implying our own concepts on the performances.. with subtle differences in timing, or dynamics.. variables, per person, that we cant notate
2016-10-29 04:31:21	contrapunctus	sure.
2016-10-29 04:31:45	holstein	thats where, for me, art and music happen.. not in just making sure that when an E is on the page, we are playing an E..

2016-10-29 04:32:10	holstein	you can get a 100% on that test, and still be doing basically what a computer can easily do
2016-10-29 04:32:15	holstein	that dosent make it art, or music..

2016-10-29 04:32:30	holstein	well, i do

2016-10-29 04:32:51	holstein	we do it with our written language, quite early
2016-10-29 04:33:39	holstein	im sure its much better than it once was
2016-10-29 04:33:45	dmbaturin	contrapunctus: There's quite a lot of this kind of instruction around really.
2016-10-29 04:33:54	contrapunctus	dmbaturin: wut
2016-10-29 04:34:16	holstein	thats how my educational experiences were.. for my education degree path
2016-10-29 04:34:42	holstein	one can easily, just basically reproduce the "right" notes, and end up with a degree at the end
2016-10-29 04:34:56	holstein	because, you have basically learned to do what is easily grade-able
2016-10-29 04:35:21	dmbaturin	In the school where I learny guitar, there was a lot of it too. Some instructors were fortunate exceptions.
2016-10-29 04:35:34	holstein	schools *need* folks there.. they depend on revenue..
2016-10-29 04:35:56	contrapunctus	hm...I think I'm in such a situation too. Only my technique is commented on, and just a little bit on phrasing.
2016-10-29 04:35:58	holstein	the goal, is *not*, to make sure professionals leave the school prepared.. the goal is, to get folks in, that are paying tuition..
2016-10-29 04:36:06	holstein	the rest is gravy, so to speak
2016-10-29 04:36:35	holstein	they would want "good" players leaving, for the reputation. but, who checks? who knows?
2016-10-29 04:36:36	contrapunctus	Whereas, when I go to the classical guitar festival we have, with the classical guitar masters of the world...their primary focus is always on phrasing.
2016-10-29 04:36:51	holstein	right.. which i think is great..
2016-10-29 04:37:01	contrapunctus	technique is a means to an end for them.

2016-10-29 04:38:48	holstein	not in every case.. but, when we would get someone, basically, bringing up these concepts, or asking these questions.. when going back to my applied teacher, those things are not easily grade-able.. or easy to discuss..

2016-10-29 04:39:56		[04:39]
2016-10-29 04:42:48	holstein	ironically, learning to teach, also, wasnt a focus ;)
2016-10-29 04:43:03	holstein	i think these programs have changed, though..
2016-10-29 04:44:51	contrapunctus	...actually, on second thoughts, my current teacher doesn't speak a lot about refining my technique, either :\
2016-10-29 04:45:11	contrapunctus	I manage to get very little input from them :(
2016-10-29 04:46:00	holstein	i learned a lot about how *not* to teach, from my college applied prof
2016-10-29 04:46:11	contrapunctus	thinking of moving to Kolkata or Goa, where there are better teachers (in the latter, my former teacher whom I miss greatly and who'd give me all sorts of input)
2016-10-29 04:46:16	contrapunctus	holstein: lol
2016-10-29 04:46:18	holstein	i dont regret my time, there, though.. i learned a lot from others..
2016-10-29 04:46:57	contrapunctus	and on the other hand, I also think of moving to Italy or Germany, learning to make, repair and play accordions...maybe there's a classical course for them somewhere...
2016-10-29 04:47:13	dmbaturin	Sticking with an instructor if a productive teaching relationship doesn't happen is not a very good idea.
2016-10-29 04:47:40	holstein	there was no alternative, at my school, at that time
2016-10-29 04:47:42	contrapunctus	dmbaturin: yeah, I started with them this year, and will be leaving in the foreseable future

2016-10-29 04:48:51	contrapunctus	holstein: for accordions?
2016-10-29 04:48:54	holstein	you would basically apprentice with a master, and, then freelance
2016-10-29 04:48:59	dmbaturin	Classical accordion instruction is quite common actually.
2016-10-29 04:49:11	contrapunctus	dmbaturin: I think holstein means construction and repair
2016-10-29 04:49:15	holstein	either
2016-10-29 04:49:29	holstein	if you want an accordian, or repair, you would ask someone, and go where they suggest..
2016-10-29 04:49:37	holstein	not just to whomever has a "degree"..
2016-10-29 04:49:39	dmbaturin	Well, I'm commenting on the classical course part.
2016-10-29 04:50:08	holstein	could be, you can get that from a school, as well.. a similar apprenticeship type setup
2016-10-29 04:50:48	dmbaturin	I've been to an accordion den today, while looking for a certain classroom. ;)

2016-10-29 04:52:51	holstein	sure.. get a job *not* in music.. you can make money that way
2016-10-29 04:52:59	dmbaturin	(Another problem of that school building is overly narrow corridors. Especially challenging for people with large instruments like double bass, lol)

2016-10-29 05:04:03	holstein	mise: they are just audio files, on some level.. so, id say, the short answer is, yes
2016-10-29 05:04:07	mrwick	testing can be good, but sometimes it's impossible to scale to production if you are in a large enough organisation
2016-10-29 05:04:34	holstein	maybe, not possible within the specific limitations..
2016-10-29 05:04:46	holstein	but, scaling, is just that.. scaling.. if the resources are there, it scales..
2016-10-29 05:04:48	dmbaturin	mrwick: Even if it does scale, it's hard to simulate things that are not under your control.

2016-10-29 05:09:21	holstein	one nice way to go, if the workflow permits.. in hydrogen, one can set it to multiple outputs, per drum.. not just stereo.. then, you can record *each* drum, into ardour, as an audio track, from hydrogen, and mix more like they are acoustic drums..
2016-10-29 05:10:34	mise	holstein: I often do this but I like the idea of using the built in soundfont player in ardour for tracking, then later to do what you are talking about so I can benefit from separate tracks, but i'd like an all in one solution for tracking

2016-10-29 07:04:40	blotchy	well not a dedicated usb-controller -- a yam p-105, midi capabably but that's not it purpose
2016-10-29 07:05:00	blotchy	i just figured i could copy how it's splitting its tones with another keyboard
2016-10-29 07:05:10	blotchy	not having figured out how to do it with the maudio
2016-10-29 07:05:45	holstein	maybe, you can figure out how to do that, with something in between the controllers, generally, in jack.. that does this "splitting" in software.. that you can route either controller to
2016-10-29 07:06:30	holstein	layers, is the term we are looking for? with midi, correct?
2016-10-29 07:06:38	blotchy	ah a more elegant solution, but i'd settle for basics at this point
2016-10-29 07:07:06	blotchy	i'm figuring the CCs are all fairly standard and someone can tell me which would generally work everywhere
2016-10-29 07:07:15	blotchy	of course i could just go research, ha ha
2016-10-29 07:07:27	holstein	both controllers should just be talking midi
2016-10-29 07:07:32	blotchy	someone mentinoed midiroute before, but that seemed complicated
2016-10-29 07:07:45	holstein	id look for a simple piece of software, via jack.. yup, midiroute
2016-10-29 07:07:51	blotchy	oh they are, but i don't have a magic sequence on the other one to split the tones
2016-10-29 07:07:58	holstein	then, i could attach *any* and all controllers, and make them do what i need
2016-10-29 07:08:16	holstein	it'll be the software that will be doing that magic splitting sequence, in any case
2016-10-29 07:08:42	blotchy	yea, some automation would be ideal, then i could customize split points etc for different tunes
2016-10-29 07:08:52	holstein	yup. that will let you "automate" this..

2016-10-29 07:09:42	holstein	i dont think you need an API, though..
2016-10-29 07:10:07	holstein	id just look at some existing pieces of software, that you can use, via jack, that you connect *any* controller to, and set those split points, etc.. whatever you need..

2016-10-29 09:05:22	romare	are sennheiser hd25s good for production?
2016-10-29 09:08:47	holstein	lol
2016-10-29 09:09:02	holstein	"good" is always a matter of opinion, and context..
2016-10-29 09:09:31	holstein	id say, you can get more "bang for the buck" for sure
2016-10-29 09:09:41	holstein	i like some of those sub $50 audio technica's

2016-10-29 09:10:40	holstein	i took mine to a guitar center, years back.. though, i think most would say, you shouldnt be using headphones in "production"
2016-10-29 09:10:50	romare	I know

2016-10-29 09:10:54	holstein	i say, if they work, they work. and one should *know* the gear they have
2016-10-29 09:11:10	holstein	like the pro's say, it really doesnt matter so much *what* the gear is.. its more about knowing the gear you have
2016-10-29 09:11:21	romare	true that
2016-10-29 09:11:36	holstein	sennheiser has a good reputation, and im sure they are "good" at what they do
2016-10-29 09:11:41	romare	I just asked if those cups are balanced enough for mixing/mastering
2016-10-29 09:11:54	holstein	right. and "balanced enough" will, again, depend on many things
2016-10-29 09:12:01	romare	you're right
2016-10-29 09:12:03	holstein	mostly, if one wants to get to know them, and use them
2016-10-29 09:12:23	holstein	me? i think i can get some that are "balanced enough" for all the mixing and mastering i would want to be doing in headphones, for $50
2016-10-29 09:15:37	contrapunctus	holstein: and how much mixing and mastering would that be? :D
2016-10-29 09:16:11	holstein	well, i'll use them, in mixing.. for sure
2016-10-29 09:16:22	holstein	when im working with audio, i'll use a lot of different sources
2016-10-29 09:16:32	contrapunctus	(and pardon a production-ignorant person's question, I thought there was no such thing as "transparent" speakers or headphones? What does "balanced enough" mean, then?)
2016-10-29 09:16:41	holstein	for me, its not about finding that "perfect" one thing that does it all.. you never know what folks are going to be listening back on
2016-10-29 09:16:56	holstein	ideally? we would all hhave the same systems.. and, it would just sound like it sounds
2016-10-29 09:17:24	holstein	but, mastering? in many cases, is not about making things sound better, or the best. but, more about finding that comfortable compromise, for every case, as much as possible
2016-10-29 09:17:30	holstein	and, that is based on opinion, and context, as well
2016-10-29 09:18:03	holstein	thats the issue.. there wont really be a "balanced enough".. if there were, you would just be able to order up the "mastering grade" units, and get to work
2016-10-29 09:18:06	rghvdberg	checkout the Samson SR 850 or S950 .. pretty cheap , pretty good. Someone at lm forums mentioned these
2016-10-29 09:18:12	holstein	the reason we dont have that, is because, its quite relative..
2016-10-29 09:18:22	rghvdberg	I got the 850 (open) very happy with them
2016-10-29 09:18:39	holstein	yeah.. i have had decent luck with other samson gear.. nothing that i would avoid , for sure..

2016-10-29 09:39:58	pifie	I to this day don't understand why compiling stuff is not automatic
2016-10-29 09:40:08	holstein	its not?
2016-10-29 09:40:15	pifie	After all, all the actions you take on are automatic, there's no free will

2016-10-29 09:40:24	pifie	I don't get the joke
2016-10-29 09:40:54	holstein	its not a very good one.. just that, *i* dont compile stuff.. as if, it *is* automatic.. since, it is for me
2016-10-29 09:41:10	pifie	I don't understand what you just said
2016-10-29 09:41:31	holstein	well, you were saying, software compiling should be automatic
2016-10-29 09:41:44	holstein	im saying, its automatically compiled for me, in my distro's repos..
2016-10-29 09:42:06	contrapunctus	err
2016-10-29 09:42:13	contrapunctus	it IS compiled automatically
2016-10-29 09:42:19	contrapunctus	the program which does the task is called a compiler.
2016-10-29 09:42:20	contrapunctus	:D
2016-10-29 09:42:37	holstein	:)
2016-10-29 09:42:55	keybox	lol sorry to interrupt this very important terminological discussion, maybe someone can help me? I installed the kxstudio repos on debian and I am experiencing some dificulties. when trying to use apt dist-upgrade I get this message "Warning: apt-key should not be used in scripts (called from postinst maintainerscript of the package kxstudio-repos)" and then something about gpg creating a keybox.
2016-10-29 09:42:58	contrapunctus	manually compiling (i.e. sitting down to read the code and translate it into your native machine code) would be a utter pain, urgh.
2016-10-29 09:43:16	keybox	and then apt just hangs
2016-10-29 09:43:24	holstein	keybox: apt what hangs?
2016-10-29 09:43:41	holstein	anyways.. try "sudo apt-get update" and you can paste the exact errors
2016-10-29 09:43:44	keybox	the command was apt dist-upgrade
2016-10-29 09:43:48	holstein	right..
2016-10-29 09:43:56	keybox	AND what really hangs I believe is this:
2016-10-29 09:43:58	holstein	keybox: dont do that..  do "sudo apt-get update" and share the ouput

2016-10-29 09:45:27	keybox	so it was probably the add repo part
2016-10-29 09:45:35	holstein	either the source is added, or not
2016-10-29 09:45:49	holstein	anyways.. get "sudo apt-get update" to report cleanly, *before* moving on
2016-10-29 09:45:56	holstein	you are just adding sources to your debian system..
2016-10-29 09:46:22	keybox	ok apt update finished
2016-10-29 09:46:26	keybox	no errors
2016-10-29 09:46:30	holstein	that can cause problems.. and its not trivial.. but, falktx does great with those sources.. to make them stand alone, etc

2016-10-29 09:47:20	holstein	keybox: sure.. so, i would look and see that i have the sources i want.. and go from there

2016-10-29 09:48:39	holstein	cool. then, i would look in my sources for something specific to kxstudio
2016-10-29 09:48:53	holstein	like "apt-cache search kxstudio" and see if i get results i expect
2016-10-29 09:49:01	pifie	contrapunctus: not completely automatic
2016-10-29 09:49:06	holstein	then, i would move on with "sudo apt--get dist-upgrade"
2016-10-29 09:49:14	holstein	its *completely* automatic, here :)
2016-10-29 09:49:14	pifie	for example, it's not automatic for your mother with a freshly installed ubuntu to install ardour 5

2016-10-29 09:51:59	holstein	but, a person doesnt *have* to compile it, in every case.. thats all im saying..
2016-10-29 09:52:16	holstein	there are PPA's, etc.. lots of other options.. the pre-built binary :)
2016-10-29 09:52:17	pifie	I didn't say in every case

2016-10-29 09:52:37	holstein	and all im speaking to, is *my* specific case.. where, its *always* automatic :)

2016-10-29 09:53:51	holstein	i have very rarely compiled or built for myself..
2016-10-29 09:54:00	pifie	holstein: that 'sometimes', are precisely the times I'm not referring to at all
2016-10-29 09:54:09	pifie	So that 'sometimes' are completely out of the question
2016-10-29 09:54:13	 *	contrapunctus comes to wonder why we've named the term "compiling" for something humans do as well, e.g. "I'm trying to compile program A", when no human clearly ever compiles any program o_O
2016-10-29 09:54:20	holstein	but, if one wants, thats *great*.. i have no problems with that. i was just joking that, in my little universe? it can seem to me, like its *completely* automatic
2016-10-29 09:54:26	pifie	It's like me saying 'Hey, my head burns!!', and you saying "WEll, my head doesn't, so it's ok"
2016-10-29 09:54:29	holstein	then, i liked the other joke that the compiler does it ;)
2016-10-29 09:54:30	contrapunctus	rghvdberg: lol
2016-10-29 09:54:55	pifie	exactly, in the doesn't-matter-for-the-question universe, it doesn't matter
2016-10-29 09:54:55		[09:54]
2016-10-29 09:55:11	pifie	neither does that fact mattter for the question
2016-10-29 09:55:15	rghvdberg	I met (online) someone who never heard of Gimp ...
2016-10-29 09:55:18	holstein	it would be like you saying "i burned my head on my stove, stoves should be allowed to burn heads". and i say "i dont have a stove".. so its not a problem
2016-10-29 09:55:18	contrapunctus	pifie: if an uneducated-user needs to compile from source, the distro has already failed.
2016-10-29 09:55:30	pifie	contrapunctus: forget the 'needs', and the 'distro'
2016-10-29 09:55:32	contrapunctus	pifie: but yeah, build systems and package managers could be way better.
2016-10-29 09:55:33	pifie	I'm not talking about that
2016-10-29 09:55:42	pifie	I'm talking about other cases out of that
2016-10-29 09:55:56	pifie	Suppose you want to install shittyprogram which has no binary avaiable
2016-10-29 09:56:09	holstein	i think you are getting me confused with making an argument that folks shouldnt compile. and i was just casually making a joke that is *seems* very automatic to me, since, i dont do it ;)
2016-10-29 09:56:10	holstein	thats all
2016-10-29 09:56:10	pifie	To get that to compile, you go about doing automatic actions
2016-10-29 09:56:12	contrapunctus	pifie: no binary available = bad distro
2016-10-29 09:56:16	pifie	So, why isn't that already automated
2016-10-29 09:56:28	pifie	I didn't say that folks shouldn't compile, holstein
2016-10-29 09:56:30	holstein	if i just *dont* compile, i dont compile.. having shitty program doesnt happen
2016-10-29 09:56:32	contrapunctus	or, unworthy-of-being-in-a-distro program.
2016-10-29 09:56:42	holstein	pifie: lol.. and i didnt say you said that ;)
2016-10-29 09:56:45	pifie	holstein: of course, I, too, ate rice today. That's as having to do with the question as what you said
2016-10-29 09:56:52	pifie	contrapunctus: that doesn't matter
2016-10-29 09:56:57	pifie	at all
2016-10-29 09:57:12	pifie	all that cases are out of the question, if some distros are good or not, or the program
2016-10-29 09:57:15	rghvdberg	or ... brand new that I really really needed at that moment (vopa plugin)
2016-10-29 09:57:17	pifie	that is completely independent of the question
2016-10-29 09:57:34	holstein	yup
2016-10-29 09:57:35	holstein	completely
2016-10-29 09:57:41	pifie	anyway, gonna go secure my food for tomorrow's biking
2016-10-29 09:57:59	pifie	BUT, why there are no auto-compilers for whatever program you want to?
2016-10-29 09:58:02	rghvdberg	motor biking ? or cycling ?
2016-10-29 09:58:06	pifie	Like, downloading missing packages
2016-10-29 09:58:07	pifie	cycling
2016-10-29 09:58:09	pifie	some 120km
2016-10-29 09:58:11	rghvdberg	kool
2016-10-29 09:58:23	holstein	i dont need one ;) i just use the stuff in my repos.. which is *magically* pre-compiled :)
2016-10-29 09:58:39	rghvdberg	used to cycle in my younger days
2016-10-29 09:58:39	pifie	holstein: yes, and I don't need compiling for making paper airplanes either!
2016-10-29 09:58:46	holstein	anyways.. i think what contrapunctus was saying was, that a compiler *is* an auto-compiler..
2016-10-29 09:58:49	pifie	I used to cycle in my younger days too
2016-10-29 09:59:11	pifie	holstein: does it get all the dependencies? What you do by compiling is not automatic in a way?
2016-10-29 09:59:25	rghvdberg	love cycling in the mountains .. for a Dutchman like me, rather difficult ;-)
2016-10-29 09:59:27	pifie	THOSE are the questions, not the other completely independent stuff
2016-10-29 09:59:39	pifie	I'm from the plains of southamerica, mostly no mountains here

2016-10-29 10:01:13	rghvdberg	no normal user should compile i.e. I'm not normal
2016-10-29 10:01:17	pifie	and by compiling it yourself you are working as a program, doing automatic tasks, so why is it not automated? Is  there a good reason?
2016-10-29 10:01:27	pifie	The question is independent from normalcy
2016-10-29 10:01:28	holstein	package managers do a lot of what you are talking about, "automatically".. and thats what i was talking about me using
2016-10-29 10:01:34	contrapunctus	pifie: [2016-10-30T01:27:11+0530] <contrapunctus> pifie: there are distros which automatically compile, AFAIK...but I don't know how user-friendly they are or how automated it is (i.e. maybe there's a human required somewhere in the middle after all) [2016-10-30T01:28:29+0530] <contrapunctus> e.g. gentoo and its recipes (not sure what those are called)...I've never used Gentoo, but even there, I think, there's no such thing as '
2016-10-29 10:01:35	contrapunctus	new program compilable without any human intervention' (gentoo users correct me if I'm wrong :\)
2016-10-29 10:01:44	rghvdberg	? gentoo ?
2016-10-29 10:01:46	pifie	holstein: You are AGAIN citing stuff OUT of the question.
2016-10-29 10:01:52	holstein	id say, the differences in the systems, is why it cant easily be automated..
2016-10-29 10:02:08	holstein	pifie: im actually not.. ;) im not "citing" anything. im just talking, friend
2016-10-29 10:02:16	pifie	-L-
2016-10-29 10:02:21	holstein	the software *automatically* shows up, in my package manager ;)
2016-10-29 10:02:23	pifie	contrapunctus: alright, only in gentoo
2016-10-29 10:02:31	rghvdberg	holstein: it's magic !!
2016-10-29 10:02:33	pifie	holstein: yes, in all the case that doesn't matter, software automatically shows up
2016-10-29 10:02:43	pifie	*cases, *don't
2016-10-29 10:02:48	holstein	that was the "joke" part, that i feel, was somehow lost, in the begining.. that got us off in a ditch, conversationally
2016-10-29 10:02:58	contrapunctus	pifie: the BSDs seem to have something which sounded similar, as well
2016-10-29 10:03:03	rghvdberg	this is fun (grabs popcorn)
2016-10-29 10:03:17	pifie	But my question is serious, why is there not something automatic, if there is no free will involved in the thing?
2016-10-29 10:03:20	holstein	and, i was additionally commenting that, *if* i wanted a more automated build process? i would consider just using a package manger, since, thats kind of what they are doing
2016-10-29 10:03:28	contrapunctus	pifie: and also Arch and derivatives
2016-10-29 10:03:30	pifie	I mean, just "download whatever necessary, install it, make configure"
2016-10-29 10:03:34	contrapunctus	JazzyEagle: you about?
2016-10-29 10:03:52	pifie	contrapunctus: I don't know about that
2016-10-29 10:03:59	contrapunctus	pifie: somebody needs to define the "whatever necessary", and at that point you have Gentoo, I think
2016-10-29 10:04:14	pifie	contrapunctus: well, when you try to compile, warnings pop up telling you what is necessary
2016-10-29 10:04:27	contrapunctus	pifie: define in machine readable form lol
2016-10-29 10:04:28	pifie	and I suppose code has the dependent packages written down somewhere
2016-10-29 10:04:40	pifie	'fail: you need X thing"
2016-10-29 10:04:44	contrapunctus	lemme ask an arch user
2016-10-29 10:04:48	rghvdberg	would be nice to for a config script to ask "you miss this package : install [y/n]
2016-10-29 10:04:48	pifie	"-> download X thing"
2016-10-29 10:04:52	pifie	"try to compile again"
2016-10-29 10:04:57	pifie	"failed: you need Y thing"
2016-10-29 10:04:58	pifie	repeat
2016-10-29 10:05:16	rghvdberg	pifie: for me this is usually the config phase
2016-10-29 10:05:17	contrapunctus	pifie: build systems track dependencies, but every build system has different ways of specifying it
2016-10-29 10:05:40	pifie	anyway, my patience has been depleted anyway

2016-10-29 10:36:39	rghvdberg	That's how I come up with things to add. It's the way my head works. If I hear a part of a song on the radio I finish it in my head ..
2016-10-29 10:37:21	rghvdberg	When I have a global idea how the song should continue I mix/record/edit a bit.
2016-10-29 10:37:29	rghvdberg	put it away .. etc etc
2016-10-29 10:37:53	gcrk	putting it away and start again is not my strength :/
2016-10-29 10:39:30	gcrk	and the moment i do it this way: i take the looper, play some chords until i think this could be nice. next is bass line, i just try what sounds good, but i never have an idea before. i just play random (in the right scale of course) and see what comes up
2016-10-29 10:40:00	gcrk	when i have an idea before i try so long to get it played right i got hardly frustrated :(
2016-10-29 10:41:10	rghvdberg	I'm cheating because I use midi only .. just click and drag and quantize .. it's perfect
2016-10-29 10:41:49	rghvdberg	not hindered by my live playing skills ! (which aren't great, but good enough for me)
2016-10-29 10:41:49		[10:41]
2016-10-29 10:42:26	gcrk	its not about timing, its also about the notes i play
2016-10-29 10:43:00	rghvdberg	oh well ..
2016-10-29 10:43:12	rghvdberg	just drag it around till it sounds right

2016-10-29 10:43:37	gcrk	i think if you played a instrument for yearsyou get to this point when you know how to play what you have in mind. but i started maybe 4 months ago to play a piano again and before i had 8 years of classic boring note playing piano lessons
2016-10-29 10:43:40	rghvdberg	I do that sometimes with chords, because when I play chords I 'voice' to my piano habits
2016-10-29 10:44:09	rghvdberg	well .. you have a great journey ahead of you then
2016-10-29 10:44:46	rghvdberg	you had the wrong teacher my friend
2016-10-29 10:46:05	rghvdberg	I teach piano/keyboard too. Making music should be fun. But the truth is, sometimes you just gotta 'make kilometers' we say here.
2016-10-29 10:47:26	rghvdberg	Most students aren't that serious about it. They just wanna learn a song. I keep reminding myself that not everyone has to be a 'pro' musician.
2016-10-29 10:48:22	rghvdberg	I don't feel like a pro either btw, although I kinda make a living with music
2016-10-29 10:48:32	gcrk	my aim would be to go to a jam session and just play with them. not perfectly timed, not the craziest jazz stuff, just not asking all the time "what chords do you play??"
2016-10-29 10:49:03	rghvdberg	that takes a lot of time to get there
2016-10-29 10:49:50	contrapunctus	rghvdberg: mine will either read it off a sheet, or play one by ear, or they won't stay my students xD
2016-10-29 10:50:04	contrapunctus	(naturally I don't have many :p)
2016-10-29 10:50:10	gcrk	i know, its a lot of different stuff to learn. knowing all the chords, the scales, play them, hear what others play.
2016-10-29 10:50:41	gcrk	contrapunctus: well, i wouldn't be more than 5 minutes :(
2016-10-29 10:50:44	rghvdberg	I learned a lot from playing chord patterns (II-V-I)

2016-10-29 10:56:27	rghvdberg	and play a lot of blues. helps you with structure / phrasing

2016-10-29 18:39:20	gcrk	[20:48:32] my aim would be to go to a jam session and just play with them. not perfectly timed, not the craziest jazz stuff, just not asking all the time "what chords do you play??" [20:48:32]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	rghvdberg	[20:49:03] that takes a lot of time to get there [20:49:03]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	contrapunctus	[20:49:50] rghvdberg: mine will either read it off a sheet, or play one by ear, or they won't stay my students xD [20:49:50]

2016-10-29 18:39:20	gcrk	[20:50:10] i know, its a lot of different stuff to learn. knowing all the chords, the scales, play them, hear what others play. [20:50:10]

2016-10-29 18:39:20	rghvdberg	[20:55:00] I played scales for 40 min a day [20:55:00]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	rghvdberg	[20:55:05] it does help .. [20:55:05]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	rghvdberg	[20:56:27] and play a lot of blues. helps you with structure / phrasing [20:56:27]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	gcrk	[20:58:38] rghvdberg: good idea, need some more input but i think you give me the right keywords to use google ;) [20:58:38]

2016-10-29 18:39:20	rghvdberg	[21:04:47] play first, learn theory later [21:04:47]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	rghvdberg	[21:05:44] music theory means nothing if you haven't heard the music it's describing [21:05:44]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	gcrk	[21:10:28] well, maybe i learned in this 40 minutes of discussion more than in 5 years of piano lessons. thank you rghvdberg! [21:10:28]

2016-10-30 01:24:02	bluebell	Is the sensor part of the battery?

2016-10-30 01:28:14	NeoFrontier	hi
2016-10-30 01:29:19	NeoFrontier	Bluebell, it is an Android program (app) which will display temperature readings either by using the device's ambient temperature sensor ( room temperature sensor ) or the sensor which is built into every lithium battery.
2016-10-30 01:29:54	NeoFrontier	When the program starts it will try find the room temperature sensor, if none is present it is going to use the battery temperature sensor to take readings from.
2016-10-30 01:31:29	NeoFrontier	In which case the user must be notified about. Now it is the start of that notification message I am trying to translate.
2016-10-30 01:31:57	bluebell	I see
2016-10-30 01:32:10	bluebell	So it's not a sensor mounted on the wall
2016-10-30 01:32:21	NeoFrontier	nope
2016-10-30 01:32:27	NeoFrontier	heh

2016-10-30 01:42:57	bluebell	gcrk: no, thet's not the difference. It's the archaic position within the sentence.
2016-10-30 01:43:08	bluebell	gcrk: "Temperatursensor des Akkus" is genitiv as well
2016-10-30 01:43:27	bluebell	NeoFrontier: yep, that's best. It will trend on Twitter! \o/

2016-10-30 01:45:37	bluebell	But isn't it perverted that in Latin America they don't speak Latin?
2016-10-30 01:45:46	gcrk	and that would be soo hard...
2016-10-30 01:45:57	gcrk	JazzyEagle: hi!
2016-10-30 01:46:04	JazzyEagle	Heya, gcrk.
2016-10-30 01:46:37	JazzyEagle	bluebell: Spanish originated from the Latin language, as did Portuguese.  That's close enough in my book.
2016-10-30 01:46:42	rghvdberg	"homo sapiens non urinat ante vedem" - thinking man doesn't pee against the wind
2016-10-30 01:47:06	rghvdberg	(I don't think it's really latin)
2016-10-30 01:47:08	NeoFrontier	The US has more spanish speakers than spain.
2016-10-30 01:47:11	JazzyEagle	And I think the fact that there's both Spanish and Portuguese, they said Latin America as it was the closest denominator lingually speaking, if you will.
2016-10-30 01:49:03	JazzyEagle	NeoFrontier: Quite possibly.  After all, Spain is roughly the size of one, maybe two U.S. States.
2016-10-30 01:49:13	bluebell	And Qtractor is a Portugues word meaning "the program that brings you world domination"
2016-10-30 01:49:28	JazzyEagle	Per capita, though, to even the playing field, I would think it'd be significantly less.
2016-10-30 01:49:37	NeoFrontier	Yeah, and I see here that Spanish is the second largest language in the world.
2016-10-30 01:49:45	JazzyEagle	bluebell: I don't think that's quite accurate, but definitely funny.  :)

2016-10-30 02:15:55	NeoFrontier	or should it rather be: Treffen Sie Vorkehrungen, damit Sie nicht ungenauen Temperaturmesswerte erhalten

2016-10-30 03:03:53	NeoFrontier	In my Country most people can at least understand English.
2016-10-30 03:08:16	NeoFrontier	I am totally puzzled by something: India is an active app download country on Google Play. According to research about 12% of them can speak English. Their main language is Hindi. Yet the Hindi language never pops up in any of my stats. There is suppose to be about 400 million Hindi speakers in the world.
2016-10-30 03:08:16		[03:08]
2016-10-30 03:08:54	NeoFrontier	I have many downloads from India. But it seems they have their Google settings on English.
2016-10-30 03:08:55	bluebell	I don't know if there is one "Hindi" or many dialects
2016-10-30 03:09:21	NeoFrontier	yet it is said only 12% of them can speak English ?
2016-10-30 03:11:31	NeoFrontier	Not a lot of Dialects but some.
2016-10-30 03:13:08	NeoFrontier	Maybe they understand English just fine like 80% of them.
2016-10-30 03:13:22	NeoFrontier	But only 12% can actually speak it fluently or something.

Honestly I don't see how that'll work in this day and age, would I be too biased and presumptuous to insist that he works with other people more often to develop more himself? I.E. me? :D

2016-10-31 02:17:45	holstein	sirriffsalothp: whats your long question?

2016-10-31 02:18:28	holstein	ah. yeah, you'll have to ask him that..
2016-10-31 02:18:51	sirriffsalothp	But at that point it's been said :P Don't wanna get his underwear in a tangle
2016-10-31 02:18:51	holstein	i wouldnt lead with "i dont think you'll be able to achieve your hopes and dreams"..
2016-10-31 02:19:19	holstein	i mean, try hiring him, if you want
2016-10-31 02:19:33	sirriffsalothp	But I don't get it.. why on earth don't you wanna be a traveling musician playing in front of people? Cooped up in a room doing videos and theoretical songs.. I guess I just can't see past it
2016-10-31 02:19:36	holstein	you can swap time, or see what his rates are, etc..
2016-10-31 02:19:57	holstein	well, as a "travelling musician"? its a pain in the ass, or can be
2016-10-31 02:20:09	sirriffsalothp	He's a year older than me lol, hiring him? He's here to work with others, that what this course is about
2016-10-31 02:20:22	sirriffsalothp	But sure I'll open with that "So what are your rates?"
2016-10-31 02:20:50	holstein	paying for travel, and gear.. mostly, breaking even. not being at home.. eating on the road.. showing up in new towns, which can be cool, but, if you dont know the place, and you have sound check at 4, and show at 8, and the show tomorrow is a 6 hour drive away.. etc
2016-10-31 02:21:26	holstein	you can share the project with him sometime, and see what he says
2016-10-31 02:21:35	holstein	he may *offer* playing on it..
2016-10-31 02:21:53	holstein	have the session at your place, and just ask "can i play you a project im working on?" and go from there
2016-10-31 02:21:57	sirriffsalothp	I really just wanna borrow his drum skills and overall production skills on some of my songs to see how it turns out, but don't wanna push him too far
2016-10-31 02:21:58	holstein	he may *offer*
2016-10-31 02:22:08	sirriffsalothp	Done that already, he hasn't offered, but he does agree to keep working on stuff
2016-10-31 02:22:14	holstein	cool
2016-10-31 02:22:18	sirriffsalothp	Still unsure if he's just being kind though :P
2016-10-31 02:22:25	holstein	who cares
2016-10-31 02:22:36	holstein	i work on *lots* of stuff that is not my stuff
2016-10-31 02:22:49	holstein	its really good stuff.. but that doesnt mean i like it, or want to be doing it
2016-10-31 02:23:00	holstein	i help professionally realize the vision
2016-10-31 02:24:15	sirriffsalothp	And this is the definition of a recording artist?

2016-10-31 02:27:38	holstein	sirriffsalothp: for me? a "definition" of an artist generally, can be challenging to defing
2016-10-31 02:27:40	holstein	define*
2016-10-31 02:28:03	holstein	basically , if you wake up, and make art? you are an artist.. all of those points can be defined, and argued further, for sure
2016-10-31 02:28:20	holstein	so, a person that wakes up, and makes art through recording it.. thats a recording artist, to me
2016-10-31 02:28:39	holstein	i think, one thing to consider is.. is a studio musician *also* a recording artist?
2016-10-31 02:28:59	holstein	is a person with fruity loops, clicking and dragging premade samples around a canvas? also a recording artist?
2016-10-31 02:29:20	holstein	im not interesting in answering those questions.. i just think that speaks to the scope of what that term can mean..
2016-10-31 02:31:13	dmbaturin	I would like to give studio musician job a try, some day. Sight read and play absolutely unfamiliar literature from the first or second attempt and get it right, that's a real challenge!

2016-10-31 02:49:48	dmbaturin	holstein: Now that I think of it, now when I have studied with a person who sight reads with me, for me, and apparently even for his own amusement for a while, I have no negative feeling towards it anymore. In the school where I went as a teen, it was more of a sadistic exercise that people imposed on students but hardly did it at will.
2016-10-31 02:51:24	holstein	sirriffsalothp: i can certainly identify with that.. and agree.. though, im trying to be open to it more..

2016-10-31 06:43:09	holstein	i think that can actually be worse than a new user.. it took my a few years to realize, but, this was basically my narrative.. i used windows, for about 15 + years, casually learning how to do professional tasks, adding gear, and software.. then, one day, i literally installed linux, and expect to know how to replace *all* that work flow that i had spend 15 or more years learning in windows

2016-10-31 07:13:11	dmbaturin	contrapunctus: Not sure really. A lot of baroque keyboard literature was written for harpsichord and old pipe organ with dynamic range of on and off, and any use of dynamic contrasts would be, technically, against composer's own interpretation. It doesn't make them bad piano pieces though.

2016-10-31 07:32:35	kristian_on_linu	so that people (in theory) could type it in and listen to it at home. This is a wink to the diskzine days, and it's quite fitting for the overall tone of the project.
2016-10-31 07:32:46	dmbaturin	Well, it's fine if you can't afford to pay. You still can hope that someone likes the project enough to put effort into it for the sake of it. And to widen the pool of people who may be interested, you'd better describe it in public.
2016-10-31 07:33:21	dmbaturin	We refer to the "code" as "score". ;)

2016-10-31 07:57:49	holstein	i know.. guitar is so much easier..
2016-10-31 07:58:04	holstein	like, you have to do some research, to approach spending $50 US on a set of strings ;)
2016-10-31 07:58:14	JazzyEagle	Can't you like buy a brand new bass for $800?  hehe
2016-10-31 07:58:18	holstein	the ones i like, are like 12 bucks, at any guitar center..
2016-10-31 07:58:30	holstein	well, you can get a nice sideways bass for that

2016-10-31 07:59:49	JazzyEagle	holstein: Buy the $800 strings once.  If you like 'em, record enough of each note to convert the whole thing into an .SFZ file.  Play your "bass" on a keyboard forevermore.
2016-10-31 07:59:51	JazzyEagle	Problem solved.
2016-10-31 08:00:12	holstein	the ones i like, are going through a bad quality control phase
2016-10-31 08:00:38	holstein	anyways.. im trying a $60 g string, and i'll be able to get by with getting that D string, from that set, if i like it, and use the current E and A i have
2016-10-31 08:00:42	holstein	that'll do for a year or so.

2016-10-31 08:01:05	JazzyEagle	At least they last for a good long time.
2016-10-31 08:01:07	holstein	then, i can do some research, and see where the $800 strings are.. etc
2016-10-31 08:01:16	holstein	you can get bass strings that can last for years
2016-10-31 08:01:28	holstein	folks keep them on for like 4 + years.. 10, ive heard
2016-10-31 08:01:33	holstein	but, they are all metal. i dont like the feel of them
2016-10-31 08:01:43	holstein	they are sub $200, as well
2016-10-31 08:01:56	holstein	they sound kind of twangy, and feel tight..
2016-10-31 08:03:43	dmbaturin	JazzyEagle: I'll go with it as long as it's flatwound. But, if we consider how much more common roundwound strings are, I guess it counts as being picky. ;)
2016-10-31 08:03:58	JazzyEagle	hehe
2016-10-31 08:04:08	 *	JazzyEagle isn't sure he ever tried flatwound...
2016-10-31 08:06:53	holstein	i got an electric bass i barely play with some have rounds
2016-10-31 08:07:04	holstein	pressure wounds? whatever those are that are like "both" flat and roundish
2016-10-31 08:07:16	holstein	i like flat chromes on the archtop..
2016-10-31 08:07:41	holstein	the upright strings are mostly flat.. though, the ones ive been using are roundish. and bronze wound. i think the $800 are like that, as well
2016-10-31 08:08:15	holstein	though, for $800 strings? you have to email a guy, get a link to a server where you download a partially informative PDF with sketchy details about everything but the price ;)

I do know that /usr/local/bin/lame would indicate a non-standard install. if you do not get any good output from the command "$ which lame" then you still need to install it and either change it in the settings or link to /usr/local/bin/lame [20:33:52]

2016-10-31 16:21:04	mrwick	[20:33:52] delest: I have never used Tracktion at all. I do know that /usr/local/bin/lame would indicate a non-standard install. if you do not get any good output from the command "$ which lame" then you still need to install it and either change it in the settings or link to /usr/local/bin/lame [20:33:52]
2016-10-31 16:21:04	mrwick	[20:35:55] anything going into a path containing `local´ means under control by the user and not the system. hence local [20:35:55]

2016-10-31 20:53:15	BTRider	I'm always amazed that Halloween isn't celebrated more around the world ..... it's a really good holiday for adults it's not just for little kids and the candy crap
2016-10-31 20:53:43	BTRider	I think that's because most foreigners learn about the USA based on movies and i dont think there are any movies that cover the adult side of halloween ironically
2016-10-31 20:54:20	BTRider	Saw some sexy tron and austin power costumes...the tron chick had a perfect ass wanted to grab it but was with my wife :(
2016-10-31 20:54:29	dmbaturin	BTRider: Not long ago I've had a conversation with a person on this subject, and his point was that people are celebrating it without understanding its original meaning in the celtic pagan culture.
2016-10-31 20:56:25	dmbaturin	Whether lost cultural context is that much of a bad thing is debatable of course, and it's the same issue with people celebrating say christmas or easter without understanding or remembering their meaning in christianity.
2016-10-31 20:58:07	BTRider	Halloween is NOT a pagan celtic holiday!
2016-10-31 20:58:13	BTRider	it's a mexican holiday!
2016-10-31 20:58:20	BTRider	what do the celts have to do with mexico?
2016-10-31 20:59:10	dmbaturin	Originally it was, AFAIR. Then the catholic church tried to override it with something about saints.
2016-10-31 20:59:21	BTRider	and us americans don't care about the mexican version we have a fun holiday, Halloween, and it's fun and sexy and everyone should get into it not try to analyze it
2016-10-31 20:59:26	dmbaturin	Didn't really work out, as we can see.
2016-10-31 20:59:28	BTRider	well it has nothing to do wtih celts
2016-10-31 20:59:48	BTRider	it has to do with Mexicans and the Day of the Dead (Dia de los Muertos)
2016-10-31 21:00:10	dmbaturin	Then, why aren't you remembering the dead?
2016-10-31 21:00:23	BTRider	scroll up?

2016-10-31 21:01:10	dmbaturin	Does a ritual without cultural, social, or spiritual content make any sense and should it be observed, that's the question.
2016-10-31 21:01:13	BTRider	and noone else has to either! It's fun to dress up and get drunk and haec wild sex
2016-10-31 21:01:21	BTRider	yes it makes sense and it should be observed
2016-10-31 21:01:35	BTRider	it has cultural content it's all about culture

2016-10-31 21:02:34	BTRider	in many circles, halloween is MUCH more important and followed than easter, christmas, or new years
2016-10-31 21:02:42	BTRider	it is THE holiday
2016-10-31 21:02:48	dmbaturin	BTRider: Well, do you think it's normal to observe the thanksgiving rituals without understanding what it's all about?
2016-10-31 21:03:23	BTRider	Yes, to a point, everyone should have some holiday where they are thankful for something, they don't have to be american to do that, or even eat turkey
2016-10-31 21:04:20	BTRider	Halloween fucking rocks it's fun it's so strange talking to people like you that never dress up, never went to a haunted house, etc, you are just prejudiced against it because it's an american holiday or whatever
2016-10-31 21:04:23	dmbaturin	Someone who has no idea about its context may think it's all about turkeys, but it's not the case, and it's not what it means to americans (ok, I bet for some it IS about turkeys, that's not my point).

2016-10-31 21:06:03	BTRider	and Halloween the girls can dress like sluts and the guys can dress like whatever movie characters it's fun
2016-10-31 21:07:35	BTRider	I mean, shit, you've got a holiday where girls dress up like sluts, everyone dresses up like movie characters, movies are the top US export, and yet, the uptake of the halloween export is zero, makes no sense

2016-10-31 21:08:07	BTRider	what do the europeans have as a holiday that is remotely similar or as fun? soccer matches?
2016-10-31 21:08:13	dmbaturin	I still think once a ritual stripped off its meaning loses all its purpose and isn't worth observing. It becomes... fake, in a sense.
2016-10-31 21:08:34	dmbaturin	Dead, if you will.
2016-10-31 21:08:46	BTRider	No the ritual hasn't lost it's purpose...the ritual is to dress up and have fun and that's what everyone does
2016-10-31 21:09:01	BTRider	You don't know anything about it and you are pontificating on why halloween is dead lol
2016-10-31 21:09:39	BTRider	Christmas is the most manufactured holiday, the one that WAS stolen from the celts solstice festival yet you falsely accuse halloween of being that one
2016-10-31 21:10:11	BTRider	anyway....a good holiday would be lost on the dour euro's anyway
2016-10-31 21:11:07	dmbaturin	I think with christmas, both the solstice and the Jesus' birthday versions are dead to most people, lol.
2016-10-31 21:11:36	BTRider	I don't give a rats ass about christmas and I never have
2016-10-31 21:13:31	dmbaturin	Remembrance Day is a good example of a ritual that isn't dead yet (though I can see it coming).
2016-10-31 21:13:43	BTRider	which is too bad, because my wife is japanese, and in japan, christmas is more like valentines day
2016-10-31 21:14:10	BTRider	so she thinks xmas is like valentines day, i'm jewish and don't care about xmas
2016-10-31 21:14:31	BTRider	you want some piny rememberance day..how generic..remember what?
2016-10-31 21:14:35	dmbaturin	Though, I have to admit, with all those people yelling about "cultural appropriation", I think willing to share your culture is a big deal.

2016-10-31 21:18:13	BTRider	anyway halloween is free for the taking no appropriation needed it's the ultimate pop culture celebrations

2016-10-31 21:20:04	dmbaturin	Yeah, sorry for the typo. // Well, I'm not saying dreadlocks and fake jamaican accent aren't stupid, they are. It's just that if "western" folk cultures are free to use for everyone, so should be all other, and no one in the world thinks they are not.

I'm not quite a supporter of the soviet communist party, but, well, under the tsarist regime, the jews could only live in certain regions and the laws essentially didn't apply to the nobles... I guess ending it was a good thing after all.

2016-10-31 21:36:45	BTRider	that's like torrenting right?
2016-10-31 21:37:19	dmbaturin	It's a place where you used to go instead of the internet if you need some information, and there was a good chance that it's just not there. But it may be in some other library, and they could get it for a week maybe, if you are lucky.
2016-10-31 21:37:53	BTRider	did they have porn there?
2016-10-31 21:38:13	dmbaturin	Usually not, though it depeds on your definition of porn.

2016-10-31 21:40:53	BTRider	when i started using the internet it was all colleges and military, nothing else, and that is why SMTP had no security because you didn't neeed it (back then)

You can take all relevant courses on edX, but it won't give you a paper that gives you rights to work in a healthcare system, anywhere in the world. If healthcare system allows fake doctors who are indian, that once fence will not work for american ones either.
2016-10-31 22:08:21	dmbaturin	That's a perfectly real problem with healthcare systems and not only in the US, I'm not arguing with that. It just has nothing to do with nationality. Russian healthcare is full of native fakes.

2016-11-01 04:01:14	inahd	so i guess i broke my manjaro linux install (again), thinking to load something a bit more reliable for music making... any suggestions?

2016-11-01 04:03:09	inahd	hmm i was thinking kx, except i have been avoiding ubuntu derivatives
2016-11-01 04:03:32	JazzyEagle	inahd: I'm an Arch guy, currently using Parabola.
2016-11-01 04:03:39	JazzyEagle	Fedora has a Spin for Pro Audio as well..
2016-11-01 04:04:01	JazzyEagle	And if you're really up for some torture, Gentoo has Gentoo Studio...
2016-11-01 04:05:15	JazzyEagle	inahd: I know there are others out there as well, though I'm less sure if the others are Debian/Ubuntu derivatives or not.
2016-11-01 04:05:21	inahd	right
2016-11-01 04:05:42	JazzyEagle	(Oh, and for the record, KX Studio is built w/ Debian, not Ubuntu any longer, though now that falktx has a full time job, it's not as well maintained as it was before)
2016-11-01 04:05:55	inahd	is parabola preloaded with audio software though?
2016-11-01 04:05:57	JazzyEagle	He still gets to things, but he's a bit slower than he used to be.  :)
2016-11-01 04:06:14	falktx	dang it, people are noticing it...
2016-11-01 04:06:15	JazzyEagle	inahd: Like Arch, it's not preloaded with anything other than the base system.  You build it up the way you want it to be built up.
2016-11-01 04:06:21	JazzyEagle	lol @ falktx

2016-11-01 04:06:36	JazzyEagle	It's quite alright.  Being that you're working on Mod, I don't think there are too many that are THAT upset at you for it.  :)
2016-11-01 04:06:39	inahd	i seem to break things when i build them up too much :/
2016-11-01 04:07:09	JazzyEagle	inahd: Yes, but learning how to fix the broken things is what makes someone a great Linux user.
2016-11-01 04:07:41	JazzyEagle	I sucked at it at first, but I've gotten pretty decent, and the Arch wiki (which also works for Parabola) is really good and clear with step by step instructions on getting things to work, and usually even has troubleshooting items.
2016-11-01 04:07:51	inahd	JazzyEagle, i must admit its true; though not necessarily a good musician
2016-11-01 04:08:01	JazzyEagle	If you go with Arch directly, you can also go onto the #archlinux channel on IRC for help, Parabola would be #parabola
2016-11-01 04:08:17	JazzyEagle	Music is easy...  Learn the rules, then break them.
2016-11-01 04:08:18	JazzyEagle	;)

2016-11-01 04:08:46	JazzyEagle	That happened to me at first, too.
2016-11-01 04:09:13	JazzyEagle	As you encounter problems and learn how to fix them, you learn how to either avoid them or fix them quicker later on.
2016-11-01 04:09:13	inahd	i am working on ways to penetrate the music scene with free software, its quite difficult...
2016-11-01 04:09:14	JazzyEagle	:)
2016-11-01 04:09:34	inahd	though i believe i have a tentative strategy
2016-11-01 04:10:36	JazzyEagle	inahd: I will say this...  On the Arch User Repository, you can download the KX Studio software (the cadence package), which helps with the configuration of JACK.  That way, you can get the tools of KX Studio without the Debian/Ubuntu derivative.  You don't get all the various audio packages that way, just the KX Studio specific software.
2016-11-01 04:10:51	JazzyEagle	But all of the rest of the software is available in the repos.  Just have to install what you want individually.
2016-11-01 04:10:53	inahd	jack is dead to me
2016-11-01 04:10:57	JazzyEagle	I think that's possible on Gentoo as well.
2016-11-01 04:11:16	JazzyEagle	JACK is the tool in which all good software collaboration flows.
2016-11-01 04:11:31	inahd	it loads eventually, but the screen is transparent...
2016-11-01 04:11:33	JazzyEagle	Resurrect JACK, and it will open up all kinds of possibilities for you.  :)
2016-11-01 04:11:39	JazzyEagle	That's...  odd.
2016-11-01 04:12:06	inahd	am on the 4.8 kernel currently, maybe has something to do with it?
2016-11-01 04:12:18	inahd	(rt)
2016-11-01 04:12:28	JazzyEagle	Not sure...

2016-11-01 04:13:15	JazzyEagle	Looks like I may need ot upgrade.

2016-11-01 04:14:18	JazzyEagle	that's alright.
2016-11-01 04:14:27	JazzyEagle	I think Ardour can be used with ALSA directly as well...
2016-11-01 04:14:36	JazzyEagle	So long as you stick to what Ardour can do, you should be alright.
2016-11-01 04:14:49	JazzyEagle	Or even LMMS (if it's more loop oriented music you're working on)
2016-11-01 04:15:00	inahd	too many broken things its time for a change methinks.
2016-11-01 04:15:33	JazzyEagle	:)
2016-11-01 04:16:12	JazzyEagle	Well, feel free, since you already have virtualbox set up, to download a couple of different distros and give them a try on VMs before making the final decision.
2016-11-01 04:16:29	inahd	i did want to open up discussion for a certain initiative of mine; as i am connected with some pretty well respected music promoters in multiple regions.
2016-11-01 04:16:54	JazzyEagle	Please remember, though, that actual Pro Audio in a VM is ill advised, as there is additional latency between the main machine and the VM.
2016-11-01 04:17:09	inahd	totally!
2016-11-01 04:17:16	JazzyEagle	The recommendation is more to get a feel for the distro itself...  its package manager, what comes pre-installed, etc.

2016-11-01 04:19:21	JazzyEagle	holstein: That's true, too, but I figured VMs would be a lot less computer rebooting...  :)

2016-11-01 04:20:52	inahd	all the people are promoting with facebook and twitter, and its disheartening.
2016-11-01 04:21:20	 *	JazzyEagle isn't really promoting anything...  Just use Facebook to keep in touch with friends.
2016-11-01 04:21:39	JazzyEagle	I have a Twitter account.  Haven't opened it up in like a year or something, and been way longer than that since I actually posted anything.
2016-11-01 04:22:13	inahd	yeah... see the problem is attracting individuals to use diaspora is hard cause their community already uses facebook
2016-11-01 04:23:00	inahd	so if i can work with the music promoters to encourage people to use diaspora there may be some hope
2016-11-01 04:23:02	JazzyEagle	That is definitely a hard thing, yes.  Most people have also never heard of diaspora and thus are skeptical.
2016-11-01 04:23:21	JazzyEagle	Diaspora... The new MySpace!!
2016-11-01 04:23:23	JazzyEagle	;)
2016-11-01 04:23:37	inahd	OurSpace
2016-11-01 04:24:37	inahd	i was thinking that there might even be some way to make diaspora more appropriate for use in media promotion, as myspace has done
2016-11-01 04:25:29	inahd	and that if the promoters could offer some incentives to their customer base to sign in and use diaspora, they will certainly do it
2016-11-01 04:26:09	JazzyEagle	There would have to be some value to the promoters for doing so.

2016-11-01 04:26:58	JazzyEagle	Well, musicians and music promoters are not always the same people.
2016-11-01 04:27:05	inahd	some are
2016-11-01 04:27:37	inahd	and one very real value might be in the burgeoning community that is being created
2016-11-01 04:27:41	JazzyEagle	Of course, hence the usage of the word "always"

2016-11-01 04:32:08	JazzyEagle	Yeah, but it needs to be attractive and effective for the music promoters as well, not just their audience.
2016-11-01 04:32:49	inahd	very truo
2016-11-01 04:33:36	inahd	so i am meditating how that might be. i know facebook becomes ever more restrictive and invasive... even charging for stuff?
2016-11-01 04:34:25	JazzyEagle	It charges pages to promote their posts beyond those already following their pages.  I know that much for sure.
2016-11-01 04:34:33	holstein	well, they charge for ads..
2016-11-01 04:34:49	JazzyEagle	Yeah, ads too
2016-11-01 04:34:50	holstein	facebook is what it is.. but, its impossible to beat, with something new
2016-11-01 04:34:59	holstein	like youtube.. you cant really compete with youtube..
2016-11-01 04:35:16	holstein	such a built in "social" network, and market.. and its not a product ;)
2016-11-01 04:36:18	inahd	its sort of true of course. still we have to have some vision that success could be possible.
2016-11-01 04:37:18	holstein	sure.. but, what is that looking like?
2016-11-01 04:37:27	holstein	and, success for whom.. etc
2016-11-01 04:38:06	inahd	the vision is still fuzzy for sure

2016-11-01 04:41:39	inahd	definitely of all the communities, the music lovers seem most likely to appreciate the value in doing something like this.
2016-11-01 04:42:35	holstein	not sure if "music lovers" are paying anyones bills, though
2016-11-01 04:45:03	inahd	yeah i mean its hard to say really. i have seen that the musicians put themselves out there regularly and represent one of the least capitalistic in general
2016-11-01 04:45:03		[04:45]
2016-11-01 04:50:12	inahd	its hard to encourage people to switch audio editing software, cause they are so invested in their methods, switching (or adding really) outlets should at least be more hopeful

2016-11-01 04:51:23	holstein	its one way to do it.. vendor lock in.. etc.. im not even saying that "bad".. its one way to do it
2016-11-01 04:51:32	holstein	but, thats why folks have a hard time leaving what they are doing..
2016-11-01 04:51:38	inahd	totally
2016-11-01 04:52:13	holstein	as for the artists? it can be a bit tricky
2016-11-01 04:52:29	holstein	i was talking about why my site is not up to date, and my media "issues" etc
2016-11-01 04:52:34	holstein	but, i dont make income that way
2016-11-01 04:52:55	holstein	for me, i dont need my audio files, i create, to make my income.. that could be *very* different for a person that is more of a recording artist
2016-11-01 04:53:06	holstein	again.. not that either is better. or one is good or bad..
2016-11-01 04:53:36	holstein	i recently started teaching at reverb lessons.. and it was interesting to see how some of the feedback can be generated..
2016-11-01 04:53:55	holstein	i only taught one lesson.. and the student *specifically* asked for only a lesson or 2. which, im fine with
2016-11-01 04:54:27	holstein	but, "retention of students" is a metric, in the system. and understandably so.. but, that doesnt really mean anything about the education
2016-11-01 04:55:00	holstein	its more about, getting money flowing, at the top priority.. which is fine.. but, *i* dont mind just teaching one off's.. and i think that *could* be a selling feature as well
2016-11-01 04:55:19	holstein	but, in the traditional model, you want money flowing in a weekly lesson..
2016-11-01 04:55:54	holstein	this can be similar for the person recording their own music.. its like, we may be *used* to the way money is flowing.. or want that to be the model. but ,it may not be the only way

2016-11-01 05:05:18	inahd	profitability is not love though ;)
2016-11-01 05:06:00	holstein	making money, from art, generally.. can be challenging.. for lots of reasons
2016-11-01 05:06:27	holstein	getting in the middle? and making money from making someone else like someone else's art? tricky..
2016-11-01 05:06:47	inahd	yeah its messy business no doubt
2016-11-01 05:06:56	holstein	not that "making money" has to be a goal. but, it has to be sustainable..
2016-11-01 05:08:26	inahd	yeah i mean ideally the transition should bear fruits, beyond the esoteric.
2016-11-01 05:08:40	inahd	so i am meditating on this as well

2016-11-01 07:39:11	holstein	yeah.. i never needed to mess with it.. i poked at it, and it seemed over my head..
2016-11-01 07:39:29	holstein	still, its a *great* idea..
2016-11-01 07:39:54	holstein	if its not being used, or able to be used, though... thats a different story
2016-11-01 07:40:05	dmbaturin	I speak from experience, we used it. It's great, but hard to service. Jenkins is more general purpose, and needs some hand-crafted scripts, but it's easy to setup and low maintenance.
2016-11-01 07:41:05	holstein	i wouldnt know anything about the specifics.. i just think there is a need, for those developers that are thinking ubuntu is linux
2016-11-01 07:41:16	holstein	i mean.. *one* argument is, they RTFM..
2016-11-01 07:41:56	dmbaturin	Yeah, the most popular OSes are Windows 7, Windows 8, and Ubuntu. ;)
2016-11-01 07:41:57	holstein	*if* the problem is, linux is kind of a fractured landscape, with lots of options.. i think for most of us, we see that as a positive.. and its all open
2016-11-01 07:42:35	holstein	we dont really need to, as a community "fix" that problem, necessarily. though, i think the argument is, for it to gain adoption, i'll need some kind of universal thing like that
2016-11-01 07:42:51	holstein	like. folks have *no* problems writing "software" for android.. which is linux..
2016-11-01 07:42:51		[07:42]

2016-11-01 07:43:40	holstein	it is what it is.. and im in no way saying its something "linux" should emulate.. just that, that did happen, where, linux was adopted by users and develpers.. basically overnight
2016-11-01 07:44:01	holstein	i think folks are looking at that model, and the other models, and trying to figure out what the issue is.. and how to "fix" something that may just not be broken..

2016-11-01 09:38:56	catbadger	but I'm at work
2016-11-01 09:39:20	catbadger	i can't share. i think it's just an eq issue, but is there a trick to tracking that I should know
2016-11-01 09:40:57	holstein	yup
2016-11-01 09:41:00	holstein	gold in, gold ou

2016-11-01 09:41:14	catbadger	haha
2016-11-01 09:41:17	holstein	but, i'll just have to hear what you are talking about, when you get a chance
2016-11-01 09:41:32	holstein	try and make sure you are getting what you want, when you are tracking
2016-11-01 09:41:41	catbadger	is there a trick to that?
2016-11-01 09:41:48	catbadger	I'm tracking with audacity
2016-11-01 09:41:57	holstein	none of that, really matters
2016-11-01 09:42:10	holstein	its about making sure, what you are hearing, when you record, is what you want to have recorded
2016-11-01 09:42:23	holstein	dont always expect to "save" it with an EQ trick or tweak..
2016-11-01 09:42:35	holstein	take the time, when you are tracking, to get the sound you want..

2016-11-01 11:01:05	holstein	jack, with ardour, will give you more options
2016-11-01 11:01:17	holstein	you can export what you have, and use those tools, there
2016-11-01 11:01:18	catbadger	ardour won't run.

2016-11-01 11:01:31	holstein	cool
2016-11-01 11:01:44	holstein	its really *the* tool for what you are doing, though
2016-11-01 11:01:48	catbadger	ardour also goes silent for free, doesn't it?
2016-11-01 11:01:55	holstein	no

2016-11-01 21:44:02	l33nux	it is strange,i am doing things and i have no clue what i am doing, but it works, and as we are success oriented people, i guess, it is okay for me
2016-11-01 21:45:12	l33nux	i would like to find out what caused the problems, because the same kernel that probably caused problems is also installed on two other machines, though i guess i willupdate today on all machines
2016-11-01 21:45:47	l33nux	good to see, how fast development of the realtime patsh is coming along

2016-11-02 00:56:15	catbadger	[19:51:49] thanks for your time as always holstein [19:51:49]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	catbadger	[19:54:00] omg. i know exactly what went wrong. [19:54:00]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	catbadger	[19:54:25] listening to it on my phone cleared it up. I mixed on headphones and didn't test the mix on bigger speakers. it sounds ok in my headphones. [19:54:25]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	 *	catbadger [19:56:17] derped really hard [19:56:17]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	catbadger	[20:59:14] so I'm looking for a vst master eq for audacity. preferably something that is Linux Native [20:59:14]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	catbadger	[20:59:29] also looking for autotune for audacity. Any suggestions? [20:59:29]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	holstein	[21:01:05] jack, with ardour, will give you more options [21:01:05]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	holstein	[21:01:17] you can export what you have, and use those tools, there [21:01:17]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	catbadger	[21:01:18] ardour won't run. [21:01:18]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	catbadger	[21:01:28] got tired of trying to get ardour to work [21:01:28]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	holstein	[21:01:31] cool [21:01:31]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	holstein	[21:01:44] its really *the* tool for what you are doing, though [21:01:44]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	catbadger	[21:01:48] ardour also goes silent for free, doesn't it? [21:01:48]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	holstein	[21:01:55] no [21:01:55]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	holstein	[21:02:15] you can download AVlinux, and use the included ardour, live, without changing your system [21:02:15]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	catbadger	[21:08:09] k [21:08:09]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	catbadger	[21:35:00] so now that i need to learn a whole new piece of software, where should I start? [21:35:00]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	catbadger	[21:35:08] :/ [21:35:08]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	holstein	[21:36:50] need to? you get to! :) [21:36:50]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	holstein	[21:37:06] anyways.. start by checking out some of the EQ's you were looking for.. [21:37:06]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	yyntx	[23:25:28] bluebell: hi [23:25:28]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	yyntx	[23:26:23] what is the correct way to record from a midi track into an audio track in qtractor? [23:26:23]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	inahd	[03:33:14] well, avlinux is not as full featured as it once was [03:33:14]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	inahd	[03:33:37] kinda reminds me of ubuntustudio as far as that goes [03:33:37]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	l33nux	[07:42:42] yesterday one laptop had huge problems, this one, then i ve installed the latest, rt kernel, and now everything is fine again [07:42:42]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	l33nux	[07:44:02] it is strange,i am doing things and i have no clue what i am doing, but it works, and as we are success oriented people, i guess, it is okay for me [07:44:02]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	l33nux	[07:45:12] i would like to find out what caused the problems, because the same kernel that probably caused problems is also installed on two other machines, though i guess i willupdate today on all machines [07:45:12]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	l33nux	[07:45:47] good to see, how fast development of the realtime patsh is coming along [07:45:47]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	l33nux	[07:46:04] everything is on it's way... [07:46:04]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	l33nux	[08:41:20] so so [08:41:20]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	dmbaturin	[08:43:37]  /usr/lib/l33nux.so [08:43:37]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	l33nux	[08:43:54] exactly ;) [08:43:54]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	falktx	[09:00:16] no symbols [09:00:16]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	l33nux	[09:03:49] hello falktx [09:03:49]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	l33nux	[09:14:27] mmmmh, i dont see any plugin support in the natuve version of reaper,...ni lv2, no native vst and no windows vst...no plugins at all,except the reaper plugins.... [09:14:27]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	l33nux	[09:20:52] reaper looks good, it is stable and promising, but without working plugin support not ready to use, yet [09:20:52]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	bomb	[09:46:07] I'm the only one who feels LMMS is underrated? [09:46:07]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	dmbaturin	[10:01:35] bomb: I guess it depends on your workflow. [10:01:35]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	dmbaturin	[10:02:44] It doesn't fit mine, for instance. Not that it's bad. [10:02:44]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	bomb	[10:04:16] dmbaturin: Can you please elaborate? [10:04:16]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	dmbaturin	[10:11:55] bomb: In short, I don't sequence. A program focused on sequencing is of no use for me. [10:11:55]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	dmbaturin	[10:12:29] I bet for those who do, it may be a great tool. [10:12:29]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	bomb	[10:20:03] dmbaturin: Oh you record performances only? [10:20:03]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	dmbaturin	[10:20:18] Yep. [10:20:18]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	bomb	[10:20:28] What's a good tool for that? Ardour? [10:20:28]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	dmbaturin	[10:21:15] I use ardour. Some use qtractor (which also can be used for some sequencing, so it may be a good tool for those who do both). [10:21:15]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	l33nux	[10:36:28] so, i stumbled upon a rpm package on my cursade of the holy native vst plugin [10:36:28]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	l33nux	[10:36:47] the maintainer is a mister ...edogawa hehehe... [10:36:47]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	l33nux	[10:37:34] many questions rising up which i have to answer myself: can i install rpm packages on arch linuc witout leaving comfort zone [10:37:34]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	l33nux	[10:40:03] does it makes sense...will i be able to get the plugins running i was not able to get running here, before... [10:40:03]

2016-11-02 02:30:50	sirriffsalothp	Yo!
2016-11-02 02:31:58	JazzyEagle	How goes it, sirriffsalothp?
2016-11-02 02:33:22	sirriffsalothp	JazzyEagle: it goes well, working out a lot of what I feel to be good stuff here in this school *thumbs up* Also a good producer-type here in my class that I'm working with a bit, I imagine a blend between my stuff and his might turn out really good
2016-11-02 02:33:35	sirriffsalothp	https://www.youtube.com/user/cucumberdwarfs
2016-11-02 02:34:42	JazzyEagle	Listening to his song Time Machine now...
2016-11-02 02:36:04	JazzyEagle	sirriffsalothp: He seems pretty good.
2016-11-02 02:36:33	sirriffsalothp	Production-wise sure, his stuff doesn't reach far in for me but it's a skill I just haven't worked on at all, the panache you know?
2016-11-02 02:36:59	sirriffsalothp	He has a very producer-esque overview in music that I don't, he wants to be a recording artist though he says
2016-11-02 02:37:01	JazzyEagle	I think so, yeah.
2016-11-02 02:37:50	sirriffsalothp	The idea of touring isn't tempting for him and I get why, but oh well. I'll hound him this whole year, holstein gave me a few suggestions on how to approach him correctly as a producer at any rate
2016-11-02 02:38:02	sirriffsalothp	So I'm excited :) How goes it over the atlantic?
2016-11-02 02:38:19	JazzyEagle	Really busy with work and work and family life, but I'm sneaking in a little programming time.
2016-11-02 02:38:27	sirriffsalothp	In other news I've ordered an Erhu and intend to learn how to play it decently
2016-11-02 02:38:37	JazzyEagle	Nice.
2016-11-02 02:38:40	sirriffsalothp	JazzyEagle: but no playing? :(
2016-11-02 02:39:20	JazzyEagle	A little bit of that too, but I haven't been recording.
2016-11-02 02:39:20		[02:39]
2016-11-02 02:39:52	JazzyEagle	Maybe I'll try to start recording scratch tracks for my ideas as a way to at least start them, then I can go back and start adding in tracks as time allows.
2016-11-02 02:40:07	JazzyEagle	I've been wanting to do that for a long time, but there's just not enough time to do much these days.
2016-11-02 02:42:44	JazzyEagle	sirriffsalothp: I like this guy's music quite a bit.  :)
2016-11-02 02:43:42	sirriffsalothp	Find the time, it is crucial! :D
2016-11-02 02:43:52	sirriffsalothp	I like his Loaded Guns and Apathy
2016-11-02 02:44:02	JazzyEagle	lol
2016-11-02 02:44:12	JazzyEagle	Ok, maybe I can sneak in a scratch track today.
2016-11-02 02:44:24	sirriffsalothp	That's the spirit
2016-11-02 02:45:36	sirriffsalothp	Also been turned onto ambient music by this sweet girl here... Carbon Based Lifeforms - Interloper.. that album is a masterpiece imo
2016-11-02 02:49:04	JazzyEagle	Ambient music is not my thing.

2016-11-02 02:49:25	 *	JazzyEagle is going to have to figure out what's going on with that.
2016-11-02 02:49:32	sirriffsalothp	Oh give it a chance, you might just like it :D
2016-11-02 02:49:39	sirriffsalothp	What's going on with what?
2016-11-02 02:49:49	JazzyEagle	sirriffsalothp: I had issues restarting the osmpbot
2016-11-02 02:50:11	sirriffsalothp	oH
2016-11-02 02:50:16	sirriffsalothp	Oh*
2016-11-02 02:50:31	JazzyEagle	I did give ambient music a try.  Some of it is ok, but most of it is just boring to me.
2016-11-02 02:54:17	dmbaturin	Isn't ambient a euphemism for boring? :)
2016-11-02 02:54:46	dmbaturin	Anyway, the person who wrote fallout 1 and 2 soundtracks did a great job.
2016-11-02 02:54:46		[02:54]
2016-11-02 02:54:55	JazzyEagle	lol
2016-11-02 02:55:54	sirriffsalothp	Nah, euphamisms try to cover up something, ambient means exactly what it says. Not suppose to be rivoting
2016-11-02 02:56:00	sirriffsalothp	But that album sure is nice anyhow
2016-11-02 02:59:25	sirriffsalothp	Any suggestions on a good pair of studio headphones for long hours of recording and early mixing into the night?
2016-11-02 03:00:54	sirriffsalothp	Hum, mixing shouldn't really take place with headphones too much anyway, would it be better to inves in closed track headphones instead then?
2016-11-02 03:01:44	JazzyEagle	sirriffsalothp: I'm assuming nearfields are not suitable for some reason?
2016-11-02 03:02:05	sirriffsalothp	We have studio monitors already
2016-11-02 03:02:21	sirriffsalothp	But I can't record in my room with speakers etc, need a good pair of headphones
2016-11-02 03:02:31	 *	holycrunchitz got ardour starting, but there's no instruments... sigh more isht i gotta do to get this music made
2016-11-02 03:04:44	JazzyEagle	sirriffsalothp: Gotcha.  Sorry, I use el cheapo earphones myself, usually, if not my $20 Logitech desktop speakers.
2016-11-02 03:05:03	sirriffsalothp	Oh :O
2016-11-02 03:05:39	JazzyEagle	sirriffsalothp: I hardly have any time, and I'm working two jobs to meet the bills.  I don't have money for the good stuff.  It ain't like I don't want 'em, but responsibilities come first.
2016-11-02 03:05:49	dmbaturin	Provided most people will listen through cheap speakers, listening to the mix through a bunch of different cheap speakers is a sensible thing to do. :)
2016-11-02 03:05:59	at0m	closed headphones are heavy and put pressure on your ears. great for recording to avoid crossbleed back to the microphone, not so great for longtime wearing like for mixing
2016-11-02 03:06:15	at0m	dmbaturin: doesn't mean you should actually mix on them :D
2016-11-02 03:06:23	sirriffsalothp	at0m: is there a good in-between set of headphones? :D
2016-11-02 03:06:27	at0m	listen for reference, ye
2016-11-02 03:06:34	JazzyEagle	If I do eventually get new gear, the first thing will be a good amp/amp head for my electric guitar, so I can finally get the sound I've been wanting.

2016-11-02 03:08:22	at0m	great for long wearing, but they bleed some. don't have them too loud when recording eh

2016-11-02 04:27:12	inahd	that makes sense
2016-11-02 04:27:36	dmbaturin	A lot of it just can't be relicensed, because of that third-party code that was given under a non-transferrable license.

2016-11-02 04:45:40	holstein	when, *i*, am using something like, arch? and not really understanding what im copy/pasting in, and breaking? and not taking the time to research? and learn? then, i dont think its really helpful to just sit there with  a broken system, in hopes of learning some magical lesson
2016-11-02 04:45:54	holstein	but, no doubt, theres more than one way to get there..
2016-11-02 04:45:56	leebre	right

2016-11-02 04:47:47	leebre	that can happen one day, that harddisk will fail, but probably not, i guess, first you would see, i guess, that next fsck say something on boot up...

2016-11-02 04:52:52	gcrk	hey guys... little question:
2016-11-02 04:53:06	gcrk	the latency in qjackctl is just the software latency, right?
2016-11-02 04:53:11	leebre	i played much bass there and , in the beginning it sounds well balanced, now, yes, ive found my sound and i canstart producing again...
2016-11-02 04:53:57	holstein	gcrk: i think thats a good question.. but, its not the "bottleneck" so to speak
2016-11-02 04:54:05	leebre	yes
2016-11-02 04:54:08	holstein	there will be some kind of "limit", that the hardware can produce..
2016-11-02 04:54:25	holstein	we can tweak around that, and get lower, for certain tasks, that are not taking so much "resources", so to speak
2016-11-02 04:54:41	gcrk	so the hole latency is soundcard input + loftware latency + hardware output latency?
2016-11-02 04:55:00	holstein	as in, if you were recording one track, you may be able to push the system a bit harder, at a certain configuration, with latency settings, where, if you were tracking 8 tracks, that would not work as well.. xruns..
2016-11-02 04:55:26	holstein	the disk needs to keep up.. the CPU processing whatever is going on
2016-11-02 04:55:38	holstein	it can be more relative to the task, than just a simple equation..
2016-11-02 04:55:57	gcrk	well, yesterday i was on a jam and feeled some latency, even when qjackctl said its just 5ms, i think i could not feel 5ms
2016-11-02 04:56:15	gcrk	so i am wondering where the rest came from...
2016-11-02 04:56:22	holstein	sure. but "feel" is a good way to think about it
2016-11-02 04:57:10	gcrk	so, next question: why is the latency lower on higher samplerate?
2016-11-02 04:57:55	leebre	because its part of essential but relatively easy to understand wave model theory
2016-11-02 04:58:15	leebre	its physics
2016-11-02 04:59:10	leebre	or?
2016-11-02 04:59:19	holstein	if you take an electric guitar.. playing it, live.. with *no* computers, or jack, or linux.. or RT kernels or configs around. and you go out to the lip of the stage, and take a solo, about 20 feet from the amp.. *that*, is not quite 20ms latency.. but, its in the realm of latency that one can "feel"..
2016-11-02 04:59:50	HerrZen	init 11
2016-11-02 05:00:11	holstein	so, when we think about configuring the computer, for latency, and "feel" like this. its really just for 2 cases.. live effects processing.. like on an electric guitar, into an amp.. or, live sample instruments, synths.. etc

2016-11-02 05:00:34	holstein	when im mixing, in linux, it matters not, if i press play, to hear my mix, and it takes the computer 90ms to play back that information
2016-11-02 05:00:53	gcrk	leebre: my thought is: higher sample rate => more samples => more work => more latency
2016-11-02 05:01:11	holstein	gcrk: it gets more into the "size" of things..
2016-11-02 05:01:13	gcrk	holstein: but i talk about a live setup, so it matters ;)
2016-11-02 05:01:57	leebre	why more work, more latency ? opposite, the cpu gets clocked faster when the work starts and then you get also probably lesser latency there, which somehow interefers with the audio latency for sure
2016-11-02 05:02:07	holstein	gcrk: its not quite analogous, but, its similar to the idea where, one can compress or uncompress data, for example, faster in some cases.. if, for example, the CPU can do the math on the compression faster than the disk can read/write the larger file

2016-11-02 05:02:43	holstein	we would say "well, compression of files always has overhead".. which is true, but, if that overhead processing can be done *faster* on the CPU size, that can actually speed up reading a file..
2016-11-02 05:03:08	holstein	its a bit like that with the sample size.. if its just larger chunks, basically.. it *seems* like things are happening faster
2016-11-02 05:03:32	holstein	there would be a limit, where, nothing actually magical is going on, that is getting more performance from the disk, or CPU
2016-11-02 05:03:32		[05:03]
2016-11-02 05:03:40	gcrk	okay, so next time i try higher sample rate. if its not enogh i need to do the monitoring externally
2016-11-02 05:04:06	holstein	i find, for live, im fine, in the 10,11,12ms
2016-11-02 05:04:11	holstein	5ms is quite low..
2016-11-02 05:04:50	leebre	i am producing right now with the lowest possible latency ...and it works...sure, if i want to "overproduce", endless tracks, instruments and effects, sure, as said before, there will be a limit
2016-11-02 05:05:05	holstein	and, when you think about sound travelling through air.. whats the difference in 5ms and 12? how far away,  in space, as far as sound moving in air, is 7ms?..

2016-11-02 05:12:07	holstein	i mean, i linked a cover, i did for another channel
2016-11-02 05:12:13	holstein	i have lots of "mistakes" in the solo part..
2016-11-02 05:12:49	leebre	i must try to make music, follow the musical rules, i know, sure...trying to make it a lil more srious
2016-11-02 05:13:03	leebre	a lil less fun for me, a lil more pleasure for the audience
2016-11-02 05:13:26	holstein	but, this is more like letting someone look at a sketchbook

2016-11-02 05:13:27	osmpbot	[URL] kohdHOLSTEIN - Clyp
2016-11-02 05:14:05	holstein	i worked on the arrangment concept, and made sure i could find the melody elements, and i specifically left the solo section, to be fleshed out, in this recording
2016-11-02 05:14:20	holstein	and, after the solo? i have some missed elements from the arrangment
2016-11-02 05:14:32	dmbaturin	One could say that I avoid too many notes actually.
2016-11-02 05:14:33	holstein	and the chords on the way out, dont really speak the way i expected them to
2016-11-02 05:15:05	dmbaturin	Well, I myself think I avoid too many notes, just because can't use them properly yet.
2016-11-02 05:15:23	holstein	i found some interesting parallel chord motion, at the end of the solo, basically, by making a mistake.. the first few movements of it, are not ideal.. but, its part of the process
2016-11-02 05:15:47	holstein	again.. its more of a sketchbook, fleshout, than a "look at what i crafted, meticulously"..
2016-11-02 05:15:52	leebre	just listening
2016-11-02 05:15:54	<--	ahellquist_wrk (~aht@109-124-147-131.customer.t3.se) has quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
2016-11-02 05:16:09	leebre	wow
2016-11-02 05:16:09	-->	catbadger (~catbadger@office.timetrex.com) has joined #opensourcemusicians
2016-11-02 05:16:13	leebre	fast heheh
2016-11-02 05:16:24	catbadger	hey
2016-11-02 05:16:28	holstein	and, its not about the recording quality, either.. i didnt take time to fire up the studio.. etc
2016-11-02 05:16:34	holstein	i just used the laptop
2016-11-02 05:16:41	catbadger	holstien i got jack working and ardour booted. lol no instruments
2016-11-02 05:16:45	catbadger	;)
2016-11-02 05:16:58	catbadger	ardour looks awesome, it's just so much work to get it working
2016-11-02 05:17:09	dmbaturin	It works out of the box for me.
2016-11-02 05:17:30	holstein	catbadger: yup.. its a learning curve. think of each of these tools as professional devices that have a learning curve.. and try not to take on a bunch at one timme
2016-11-02 05:17:31	dmbaturin	Maybe I'm lucky that it does, but it does.
2016-11-02 05:17:43	holstein	try and just record a simple audio track, *not* a production track, into ardour
2016-11-02 05:17:55	holstein	like. dont fire up linux, and get jack running, and then start making an album
2016-11-02 05:18:23	leebre	yeah, this sound more like jazz, what you just showed me hehehe
2016-11-02 05:18:25	holstein	setup, nice simple learning steps.. check the level, make an audio track that you will *never* use for anything but learning.. and apply some effects. try an export.. etc
2016-11-02 05:18:46	dmbaturin	On a side note, the head of Beautiful Love makes a perfect clarinet etude. It has most of the annoying fingerings and phrases that don't work if you start with a wrong pinky.
2016-11-02 05:18:46		[05:18]
2016-11-02 05:18:51	holstein	leebre: its improvisation.. with specific errors i can speak to, because i made them
2016-11-02 05:19:05	dmbaturin	* in concert F
2016-11-02 05:19:22	holstein	leebre: all im talking about, is thinking about it less about playing the right notes.. etc.. its more about being intentional with a concept, and my ideas
2016-11-02 05:19:52	holstein	i know, from listening to that, what i meant to do.. what i would prefer to have done, and what i would do differently next time, et
2016-11-02 05:19:58	leebre	yeah, i hav to get focused
2016-11-02 05:20:05	leebre	serious and focused
2016-11-02 05:20:06	holstein	but, that time is over.. and  it had a conversational arc to it, that i appreicate
2016-11-02 05:20:19	holstein	and i cant re-visit that *specifically* again
2016-11-02 05:20:29	leebre	which is stupid frommy childish view because a hobby should make fun
2016-11-02 05:20:34	holstein	its not about that.. thats not what the miles band was about.. it was more about always having a sketch book
2016-11-02 05:20:50	leebre	right
2016-11-02 05:20:58	holstein	and, learning ones language, and vocabulary, so that, one is speaking more closely to what one means, intentionally
2016-11-02 05:21:04	holstein	not just playing "right notes"..
2016-11-02 05:21:12	leebre	and having luck hehehe
2016-11-02 05:21:18	holstein	i dont want you to think im saying 'hey, you have a lot of wrong notes there
2016-11-02 05:21:26	leebre	because the tune is  so open fromt he scale hehehe
2016-11-02 05:21:35	holstein	there are no wrong notes. there are just notes that you and i know, you didnt mean to, or want to play
2016-11-02 05:21:50	holstein	and, you'll have to get honest with yourself, about that, and sort out getting more intentional
2016-11-02 05:21:57	leebre	yes
2016-11-02 05:22:09	leebre	i trained myself what you now are just saying
2016-11-02 05:22:24	leebre	i mean i tried for a long time to play wrong notes intentionally hehehe
2016-11-02 05:22:42	leebre	by not trying to follow any"musical rule"
2016-11-02 05:23:03	leebre	but i tried to put all my power in the sound
2016-11-02 05:23:20	holstein	now, in contrast. with a piece like this, from bass, where i am much more comfortable. https://holstein.bandcamp.com/track/breath
2016-11-02 05:23:22	osmpbot	[URL] breath | holstein
2016-11-02 05:23:30	leebre	in the sound of the played note, with how much power and intention i can play, with feeling for sure
2016-11-02 05:23:36	catbadger	holstien that's actually my plan thank you again for all your input
2016-11-02 05:23:53	holstein	i was able to quickly conceptualize that arrangement, and then, just press record, and make that track, with the improvisation being mostly what i intended..
2016-11-02 05:24:09	holstein	without any editing, or multiple takes, etc..
2016-11-02 05:24:24	catbadger	ooh
2016-11-02 05:24:32	catbadger	cool start
2016-11-02 05:24:51	holstein	but, thats with *lots* of study, and work with that particular instrument, and improvisation.. and, just a fun idea that i specifically left to flesh out while improvising on
2016-11-02 05:24:59	catbadger	I love the harmony
2016-11-02 05:25:15	holstein	thanks..
2016-11-02 05:25:26	holstein	also, that idea of having the bass be self accompanied..
2016-11-02 05:25:29	leebre	wow
2016-11-02 05:25:45	holstein	and with "living", i didnt want to edit anything.. so, i left things kind of rough
2016-11-02 05:25:47	leebre	thebow sound can be nice, too
2016-11-02 05:25:56	holstein	with "open", i edited..
2016-11-02 05:26:17	leebre	gipsy scale hehehe
2016-11-02 05:26:19	holstein	i would splice takes, etc.. to get "good" ones.. but, i like both ways.. its like, some things in the sketch book look nice, you know?
2016-11-02 05:27:01	leebre	k
2016-11-02 05:27:05	holstein	but, no overdubs on either..
2016-11-02 05:27:10	leebre	still listening...
2016-11-02 05:27:20	holstein	has to be acoustically possible, from the bass.. so, lots of open strings, etc..
2016-11-02 05:27:59	leebre	i like first take concept, and sometimes i am doing 2 bars, sometimes more..or less...i dont car ehehehe
2016-11-02 05:28:13	catbadger	so this was done 100% with a reall cello?
2016-11-02 05:28:23	leebre	great, i like the second one too, very impressive
2016-11-02 05:28:44	dmbaturin	catbadger: No cellos were harmed. ;)
2016-11-02 05:28:48	holstein	catbadger: thats a bass..
2016-11-02 05:29:19	holstein	"breath" is my fav, from both projects.. it just happened, so nicely
2016-11-02 05:29:25	catbadger	what???
2016-11-02 05:29:29	catbadger	you bowed a bass?
2016-11-02 05:29:32	catbadger	beautiful
2016-11-02 05:29:37	holstein	catbadger: cheers..
2016-11-02 05:29:46	catbadger	like a stand up tho, right? not a fender standard?
2016-11-02 05:29:58	catbadger	my ears say its a huge hollowbody
2016-11-02 05:29:59	dmbaturin	In classical, _everyone_ bows a bass.
2016-11-02 05:30:01	holstein	its an acoustic upright bass
2016-11-02 05:30:17	catbadger	k. Sorry I'm a rocker, and my bass friends all pluck or pick
2016-11-02 05:30:29	holstein	right.. i "rock" if i want, as well
2016-11-02 05:30:30	dmbaturin	I wish more people did it in jazz too.
2016-11-02 05:30:37	holstein	i just dont wait for a fender bass to show up, to do so
2016-11-02 05:30:41	catbadger	rock and hiphop is my lane so far.
2016-11-02 05:30:53	catbadger	it's really cool man
2016-11-02 05:31:08	catbadger	I hope I can get some decently tracked work to share soon
2016-11-02 05:31:23	holstein	not that is "rock".. but, you can hear more of a percussive thing here https://holstein.bandcamp.com/track/in-the-clear
2016-11-02 05:31:24	osmpbot	[URL] in the clear | holstein
2016-11-02 05:32:42	holstein	https://holstein.bandcamp.com/track/side-out is more "rock" ish.. in nature..
2016-11-02 05:32:43	osmpbot	[URL] side-out | holstein
2016-11-02 05:32:52	dmbaturin	catbadger: There's a video with Native Threads piece played on two basses, ask holstein for a link.
2016-11-02 05:33:16	holstein	anyways..  the p
2016-11-02 05:33:23	leebre	second please
2016-11-02 05:33:44	leebre	you are pasting now faster then i canhear hehehe, joking, sorry
2016-11-02 05:33:45	holstein	"process" for both of these, was.. conceptualize the piece.. press record, and work with it as quick as possible.. and move on..
2016-11-02 05:34:42	holstein	with "breath" that happened so quickly, and organically.. with "side-out", as well.. but, i remember being so excited about getting "breath" recorded..
2016-11-02 05:34:42		[05:34]
2016-11-02 05:35:25	leebre	great, nice, yeah, i canhear that you really made diferent parts with different ideas
2016-11-02 05:35:41	holstein	it was like, it came in, fully formed, and i wanted to get it down, while i still had it in mind.. i have a few tunes like that, where, the "composing" of the tune, comes in pretty much fully formed. and it takes about 3 times longer to  listen than it did to get the idea :)
2016-11-02 05:36:21	holstein	i did want to bother, at the time, but, i should have, and will, in the future, take video.. since, folks are always assuming its overdubbed stuff
2016-11-02 05:37:55	holstein	leebre: anyways.. specifically getting back to https://clyp.it/kwzd4brq you can hear at 2:20.. i have the "wrong" chords moving chromatically.. and it takes about 10 seconds for me to flesh out the idea im having..
2016-11-02 05:37:56	osmpbot	[URL] kohdHOLSTEIN - Clyp
2016-11-02 05:38:22	holstein	this is more because im still getting comfortable on guitar, and it just takes 10 seconds for that to happen.. where, on bass, that may be more instant..
2016-11-02 05:39:23	leebre	i amunderstanding, hehehe, thats because you want to follow the rules and dont want to break anything
2016-11-02 05:39:33	leebre	the chord progressions
2016-11-02 05:40:28	leebre	i have to think a lil bit, ..do i want to make music to have fun and hardly find any one to listento it....mmm
2016-11-02 05:41:00	leebre	or trying to make it serious, following the rules...mmm sure, ....
2016-11-02 05:41:14	inahd	whose rules?
2016-11-02 05:41:18	leebre	i thinki am allready trying but i cant hehehe
2016-11-02 05:41:29	leebre	allof us, ...hearing habbits
2016-11-02 05:41:49	leebre	these hearing habbits are reflected by those musical rules
2016-11-02 05:42:02	holstein	leebre: yeah.. its more about not having rules for "right" notes, like that
2016-11-02 05:42:08	inahd	i listen to classical indian music, different rules :P
2016-11-02 05:42:09	holstein	there are no, implicitly, right or wrong notes
2016-11-02 05:42:18	holstein	its more about having a concept, and making that work
2016-11-02 05:42:36	holstein	just like any language. there are many ways to say the same things.. or different ways to convey ideas
2016-11-02 05:42:50	holstein	its the idea, that is the focus.. and, the language supports that idea
2016-11-02 05:42:51	leebre	i know some one who said, after the first thre notes are played, the whole song is done, because its a , somehow its an algorithm
2016-11-02 05:42:59	holstein	right
2016-11-02 05:43:00	holstein	its not
2016-11-02 05:43:03	holstein	its art..
2016-11-02 05:43:17	holstein	if it were an algorithm, it would prolly be easier ;)
2016-11-02 05:43:27	holstein	but if it helps to think of it that way? go for it
2016-11-02 05:43:29	leebre	i am just starting to get insecure, i dont know, as i said i think i have to overthink everything , for the first time serious
2016-11-02 05:43:39	holstein	yup
2016-11-02 05:43:44	holstein	and, theres no room for that
2016-11-02 05:43:48	holstein	its just like talking
2016-11-02 05:44:02	leebre	there are some rules
2016-11-02 05:44:02	holstein	if you walk up to a group, and start being insecure.. and studdering.. etc.. thats not ideal
2016-11-02 05:44:06	holstein	its not clear communication
2016-11-02 05:44:08	leebre	i dont know, sure its art
2016-11-02 05:44:18	leebre	but beside hearing habbits
2016-11-02 05:44:20	holstein	leebre: the point is, the rules? are not about the words.. or the notes..
2016-11-02 05:44:33	leebre	like the rytrhm being mostly 4/4
2016-11-02 05:44:35	holstein	the rules are about that conversation. and the concepts. the ideas..
2016-11-02 05:44:43	holstein	its not about learning the "good" notes, or the "right" things to say..
2016-11-02 05:45:21	dmbaturin	leebre: https://dmbaturin.bandcamp.com/track/silly-dream This thing has not enough "wrong" notes.
2016-11-02 05:45:22	osmpbot	[URL] Silly Dream | Daniil Baturin
2016-11-02 05:45:27	holstein	hehe
2016-11-02 05:46:18	holstein	i mean, if it *were* a simple algorithm, and we can just program a computer to play the right notes. that would be one thing.. and, maybe that can happen, at some point.. where, a computer can converse with humans, etc.. and make art
2016-11-02 05:46:32	holstein	but, til then, we have the market cornered on this super high level processing
2016-11-02 05:47:06	holstein	taking thoughts, and feelings, and concepts, and abstracting those things out in different languages, and media.. its complex, and simple, at the same time.
2016-11-02 05:47:08	catbadger	sorry I'm slow
2016-11-02 05:47:09	catbadger	I'm at work
2016-11-02 05:47:40	catbadger	thank you guys!
2016-11-02 05:47:46	holstein	elegantly simple ,where, one just needs to say or play what is good to them. but, that discernment is a lifetime study..
2016-11-02 05:47:52	leebre	hehehe
2016-11-02 05:47:59	leebre	just listening...
2016-11-02 05:48:03	leebre	nice tune, too
2016-11-02 05:48:12	holstein	what is "good" to me? what am i trying to say? how can i say it more clearly? etc.. thats all we can really do, and judge.
2016-11-02 05:48:34	holstein	the rest is just language rules, that, are just that.. breakable in art, in many ways..
2016-11-02 05:49:08	holstein	if you look at poetry, as an analog.. taking our spoken language, that we are all comfortable using.. you can see how folks break these rules to say things.. using what we would call the "wrong" or "bad" words..
2016-11-02 05:49:42	holstein	but, it makes something greater than the sum of its parts.. that goes beyond choosing the right words or notes.. you choose *intentional* language that conveys the idea
2016-11-02 05:49:42		[05:49]
2016-11-02 05:49:57	leebre	as i said, i am insecure and i have o think first before sayin something, that is intend to be serious, because i think , when seeing music as art, then still, many questions are rising up, ...i guess some different ways of thinking about  freedommaybe
2016-11-02 05:50:13	holstein	think what you want.. this is not really about *not* thinking..
2016-11-02 05:50:26	holstein	but, is that thinking helping you? or constructive? in making your art?
2016-11-02 05:50:31	leebre	was great too
2016-11-02 05:50:40	leebre	still
2016-11-02 05:51:09	leebre	thats my idea, we are ruke sby subconciousnes and that itsself is somehow predetermined
2016-11-02 05:51:22	leebre	ruled
2016-11-02 05:51:24	holstein	folks argue that, sometimes. "im afraid" or "i overthink it".. i say, if that helps? use it.. but, its likely more in the way.. more baggage
2016-11-02 05:51:28	leebre	and that includes music
2016-11-02 05:51:36	holstein	i think its good to question *every* and *all* processes..
2016-11-02 05:51:52	holstein	trying other things, all the time, and seeing what is constructive, and how..
2016-11-02 05:51:54	leebre	specially when doing music alone hehehe
2016-11-02 05:52:35	holstein	but, lets say, we *are* ruled by that? and my thinking is all predetermined
2016-11-02 05:52:40	leebre	yeah, having fun or joy is surely not the right idea, but feeling comfortable and thous secure and intentional because of being serious somehow
2016-11-02 05:52:52	holstein	outside of that model, im sure i could see that. and be like "oh, im just a rat in the cage, man"
2016-11-02 05:53:01	holstein	but, inside the model? it feels like i have choice
2016-11-02 05:53:12	holstein	so, i have to deal with my reality, as it is..
2016-11-02 05:53:27	leebre	yes
2016-11-02 05:53:37	holstein	if i want to think, and go along with "its all predetermined" and that helps me create art? great.. if not? im going to explore other processes..
2016-11-02 05:53:49	leebre	mmhh....
2016-11-02 05:53:55	holstein	if that is true, or not.. really doesnt matter, if my end goal is making art
2016-11-02 05:54:06	holstein	im not trying to solve the "am i a rat in a cage' question
2016-11-02 05:54:24	leebre	i am free when being in kin of a trance, not a drug induced one, but if i am not being thinking about the next interval being too far away maybe
2016-11-02 05:54:30	holstein	i literally couldnt care less about that.. as long as im becoming a better version of the artist im working toward being..
2016-11-02 05:54:54	leebre	so, ratio, some kind of not being ruled by subconcioness  is not bringing us forward
2016-11-02 05:55:21	holstein	sure.. but *all* of that new needs questioned
2016-11-02 05:55:24	holstein	forward where?
2016-11-02 05:55:29	holstein	and forward in relation to what?
2016-11-02 05:55:33	holstein	by what metric?
2016-11-02 05:55:38	holstein	is forward good? or bad?
2016-11-02 05:55:47	holstein	maybe i dont want or need to go forward to get where im going.. etc
2016-11-02 05:55:59	leebre	progress, is the same meaning , time moves forward but things evolve, and as you said, good or bad is sometimes just an idea , too
2016-11-02 05:56:06	holstein	so many of these things are just not easily solved with a simple statement..
2016-11-02 05:56:15	holstein	*does* time move forward?
2016-11-02 05:56:24	leebre	mmmh
2016-11-02 05:56:25	holstein	or, is that just how i perceive it?
2016-11-02 05:56:26	leebre	yes
2016-11-02 05:56:44	leebre	it moves with the expansion of the universe
2016-11-02 05:56:48	holstein	if im the rat in the cage, maybe its all already happened, and thats just how im being given time..
2016-11-02 05:56:51	leebre	but time is an idea
2016-11-02 05:56:56	holstein	and, *is* the universe expanding?
2016-11-02 05:57:10	holstein	or, is it shrinking on the outside of that reality? that we cant perceive? etc..
2016-11-02 05:57:17	holstein	these are not given variables..
2016-11-02 05:57:21	leebre	it probably is, as the scinetist are sayin
2016-11-02 05:57:28	holstein	sure.. and probably is just that
2016-11-02 05:57:30	leebre	at onepoint it will get smaller
2016-11-02 05:57:42	holstein	lol
2016-11-02 05:57:47	catbadger	deeeeeeep
2016-11-02 05:57:49	leebre	but time can only exist in a universe , something that is not an empty room
2016-11-02 05:57:53	holstein	at one point its *assumed* it *may* shrink
2016-11-02 05:58:03	holstein	but, what shrinks? and is that bad? etc.. bad by what metric..
2016-11-02 05:58:23	leebre	that is not the point, i think we should all fear science
2016-11-02 05:58:29	holstein	right and i say fuck that
2016-11-02 05:58:37	leebre	because they are doing thing in the laborytories that we dont wanr
2016-11-02 05:58:40	holstein	i dont want to fear anything, specifically, just for fear's sake
2016-11-02 05:58:51	holstein	*question* everything, and accept that fear is a human emotion..
2016-11-02 05:59:09	holstein	fear is what has helped us make choices that keep us alive. but, its *not* always *good*, in every case
2016-11-02 05:59:15	leebre	yes
2016-11-02 05:59:20	holstein	"they" are not doing things in labs
2016-11-02 05:59:25	holstein	thats *we*
2016-11-02 05:59:30	holstein	*we* are doing that..
2016-11-02 05:59:33	holstein	there is no us and them

2016-11-02 06:00:21	holstein	and, "we" choose to do that? mostly out of fear.. thats when you see lots of things happen that are scary like that
2016-11-02 06:00:33	holstein	"fear the chinese, they are searching for aliens"
2016-11-02 06:00:34	leebre	building huge telescopes, wasting huge of money

2016-11-02 06:02:51	leebre	youare right, but that is what is frightening me now
2016-11-02 06:02:53	holstein	one day, they may just wipe us out.. or, they may come and help us tremendously.. or, they may never come.. or, maybe they are already here..
2016-11-02 06:03:15	holstein	"fear" is what it is.. and is not always bad.. but, you dont have to freeze up like a squirrel..
2016-11-02 06:03:17	leebre	you have to compare to worstest
2016-11-02 06:03:18	dmbaturin	Anyway, there are no single-purpose telescopes.

2016-11-02 06:03:44	leebre	thats what i read in newspaper, that its part o seti
2016-11-02 06:04:03	leebre	and seti is searching for life in space (and that includes intelligentlife )
2016-11-02 06:04:07	holstein	dmbaturin: i like that.. *we* are also the aliens :)
2016-11-02 06:04:15	holstein	its all just *us*, again.. i like that

2016-11-02 06:04:26	leebre	we are startdust, we are golden
2016-11-02 06:04:53	leebre	yet, we are killing our ownbrothers and sisters, i dont think we would get along with any kind of intelligent alien

2016-11-02 06:05:16	catbadger	this chat is amazing
2016-11-02 06:05:31	leebre	if they find us, they are smarter then we are, then they will leave as fast as they can
2016-11-02 06:05:51	holstein	leebre: lol.. its *all* us, man
2016-11-02 06:05:53	catbadger	This is the best vain entertainment I could provide for my brains entrainment.
2016-11-02 06:06:03	catbadger	so thank you
2016-11-02 06:06:04	catbadger	:)
2016-11-02 06:06:16	holstein	leebre: and again. thats just the *one* scenario, that you happen to arbitrarily choose to fear
2016-11-02 06:06:24	dmbaturin	Still, you may think something like Chandra or, worse, Radioastron is waste of money... But, that GPS thingy in your phone relies in findings made witht those, too.
2016-11-02 06:06:29	holstein	leebre: could be? aliens are *already* here..  etc..
2016-11-02 06:06:37	holstein	lots of reason to fear, and not get out of be in the mornings..
2016-11-02 06:06:39	leebre	who knows
2016-11-02 06:06:39	holstein	but,  fuck that..
2016-11-02 06:06:47	leebre	yes
2016-11-02 06:06:58	holstein	leebre: right.. so, why freeze up like the squirrel on the highway? you are smarter than that..
2016-11-02 06:07:22	holstein	it is what it is. we are all in this together.. the future overloarding aliens, or, if its "just us" or whatever..
2016-11-02 06:07:52	dmbaturin	There are things now in space that are absolutely vital for GPS, but what exactly they do, it's nearly impossible to explain to "taxpayers".
2016-11-02 06:08:15	dmbaturin	Telescopes are easy, they make pretty pictures at least. ;)
2016-11-02 06:08:47	catbadger	Man all the aliens are just going to want to move here.
2016-11-02 06:08:49	catbadger	;)
2016-11-02 06:08:49	dmbaturin	Those frame dragging experiments produce just lots of numbers.
2016-11-02 06:08:57	holstein	yeah.. taking all our jobs!
2016-11-02 06:09:05	catbadger	they're going to come to earth in droves and take our jobs!

2016-11-02 06:10:03	leebre	i have choclate, vegan rice choclate :)
2016-11-02 06:10:09	holstein	cheap-o, freeshipping, amazon thing..
2016-11-02 06:10:14	holstein	i mean, ebay..
2016-11-02 06:10:14	leebre	hehehe
2016-11-02 06:10:20	dmbaturin	Those people no one on earth likes, maybe aliens have different tastes and they finally get a chance. ;)
2016-11-02 06:10:26	leebre	they are probably building it after you ordered hehehe
2016-11-02 06:10:46	holstein	hey.. cheap, fast and good.. pick 2..
2016-11-02 06:11:00	holstein	i know already its cheap.. we'll see if its good, since, its not fast :)
2016-11-02 06:11:25	dmbaturin	holstein: Whatever I buy, it will have a delivery range of like a month. And, depending on shipping method I choose, not always 100% chance of arriving in one piece, or at all. :)
2016-11-02 06:11:36	holstein	dmbaturin: :/
2016-11-02 06:11:59	holstein	this is a small switch, for a guitar pedal.. hopefully, it'll ship safely
2016-11-02 06:12:06	dmbaturin	USPS provides amazing service in this regard.
2016-11-02 06:12:11	holstein	the freeze pedal is *so* loud..
2016-11-02 06:12:15	holstein	the switch
2016-11-02 06:12:26	catbadger	so I'm using a d880 in the studio, and some of my highs are super "presency" and others sound ok, is that just my moving around while tracking them? It's gotta be somthing unconcscious i'm doing
2016-11-02 06:12:27	holstein	we'll see if i can swap it out, without breaking anything..
2016-11-02 06:12:49	catbadger	they've had exactly the same eq and normalization applied
2016-11-02 06:12:57	holstein	catbadger: you can share, and i could give a opinion
2016-11-02 06:13:06	holstein	proximity can certainly be a factor
2016-11-02 06:13:07	dmbaturin	leebre: That chocolate is made of rice and no cocoa? ;)
2016-11-02 06:13:17	holstein	catbadger: what mic is it?
2016-11-02 06:13:44	holstein	is the d880 the mic?

2016-11-02 06:14:20	leebre	its cacao with rice milk instead of normal milk, its some kind of milk choclate
2016-11-02 06:14:22	holstein	anyways.. i would expect proximity to matter, with that mic..
2016-11-02 06:14:45	holstein	you may be able to get back from it and crank it up a bit, and get more consistency..
2016-11-02 06:15:39	holstein	you can sometimes, take the internal wind screens out of that kind of mic, and use panty hose, and a coathanger to make a pop filter, and get back from it a bit, and get "better" results for vocals..

2016-11-02 06:22:05	catbadger	XD
2016-11-02 06:22:19	catbadger	yes the d880 is the mic
2016-11-02 06:22:48	catbadger	ooh i've been thinking about building my own pop filter as the mic sounds sibilant
2016-11-02 06:23:13	catbadger	it's really old and beat up. it's been my stage mic for most of my performing years
2016-11-02 06:23:39	dmbaturin	There are inexpensive pop filters though. Not sure if they are any good, never tried.
2016-11-02 06:24:00	dmbaturin	I can't sing for life anyway.
2016-11-02 06:24:36	catbadger	I am mostly a vocalist. I'm always dissappointed with how things sound in the studio vs my stage sound.
2016-11-02 06:24:39	holstein	they all pretty much do what they do
2016-11-02 06:24:46	holstein	stop spit from getting over on the mic
2016-11-02 06:24:57	holstein	but, a mic like that? has foam in the cap
2016-11-02 06:25:03	holstein	you can screw it off, and see it.
2016-11-02 06:25:09	holstein	so, you dont need *both*
2016-11-02 06:25:24	holstein	but, one nice thing about the pop filter, is, it give the singer something to aim for..
2016-11-02 06:26:08	holstein	catbadger: you can elaborate.. in *every* studio? what mics have you tried? what are you dissapointed with? the sound while you are tracking? or listening back?
2016-11-02 06:26:32	holstein	on "stage" you get more the sound that the room gets.. but in studio, we can be doing things that compromise that sound, to get better recording quality
2016-11-02 06:26:38	holstein	liike, simply wearing headphones
2016-11-02 06:26:55	holstein	or, tracking "dry", as in, no reverb..
2016-11-02 06:27:01	-->	gianMOD (~gianMOD@185.19.197.52) has joined #opensourcemusicians
2016-11-02 06:27:13	holstein	but, one can track dry, or wet and dry ,and have reverb in the monitor, that is either going to tape, or not
2016-11-02 06:27:43	holstein	anyways.. this kind of thing *can* be looked at more scientifically,..
2016-11-02 06:28:28	holstein	theory.. im moving around on my vocal mic, and thats causing problems with my high end being consistent.. so, we put on some headphones, and listen, as we record a track, while moving around, and singing
2016-11-02 06:28:35	holstein	we listen back, and see what is happening..
2016-11-02 06:29:12	holstein	if thats the case, then, you can plan on addressing it.. if not,  then, you can look at other theories.. "when i track vocals, sometimes i think i leave the door to the hallway open"
2016-11-02 06:29:27	catbadger	very scientific
2016-11-02 06:29:28	holstein	again, you just go press record, and sing, and open and close the door
2016-11-02 06:29:41	holstein	its *very* relative, and specific to the space, and the specific tools

2016-11-02 12:00:58	holstein	[18:19:44] trying to look at ways to "practice" those changes, is key [18:19:44]

2016-11-02 12:00:58	holstein	[18:20:19] i like how they say "i will face my fears, and let them flow through me" or whatever [18:20:19]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	holstein	[18:20:28] its not about ignoring the fear.. [18:20:28]

2016-11-02 13:41:31	catbadger	people are weird. they are so often into wrecking the world in the name of their diety of choice than actually helping people which is the point of religion in general.

2016-11-02 23:27:10	catbadger	[23:41:31] people are weird. they are so often into wrecking the world in the name of their diety of choice than actually helping people which is the point of religion in general. [23:41:31]
2016-11-02 23:27:10	catbadger	[23:41:43] that sentence sucks [23:41:43]

2016-11-03 03:35:13	sirriffsalothp	Hi lads
2016-11-03 03:35:46	JazzyEagle	Hey, sirriffsalothp :)
2016-11-03 03:36:01	delest	my question no too close to Traction: I try to clik on "open containing folder" after that the Firefox opening with the 'path', not the windows manager (mine is nemo)
2016-11-03 03:36:14	sirriffsalothp	I was in the rehearsal-room the other day with a drummer who doesn't do heavy music exactly but he's touched upon it in the past. I wanted to try some drums on my riffs.. When I showed the little practice session to someone else after he suggested I start reading music theory *facepalm* To make it easier for the drummer..
2016-11-03 03:36:44	sirriffsalothp	Gonna slap up the little session here, I wonder if you guys have any input on why the drummer has trouble and what's going on. Zequence I'm sure could handle the durmming on this

2016-11-03 03:38:48	sirriffsalothp	Because, with this particular riff, if I make it straight forward it loses it's spark for some reason, I even play it more slavishly in one section to show that I CAN make it "easier"

2016-11-03 03:42:23	sirriffsalothp	In the middle he does say he could probably do it if he has the beat-measures in front of him etc, so is it really just a question of sitting down with it and being thorough?

2016-11-03 03:45:01	sirriffsalothp	JazzyEagle: really? It's not the most straight-forward riffing I've ever heard, I thought it was a thing in between straight-forward and complicated :P
2016-11-03 03:45:28	JazzyEagle	sirriffsalothp: Another thing you could try is to find a song that's kind of similar to the riff you're having and the drum beat you want.  It sounds to me kind of like Sevendust's Alpha.
2016-11-03 03:45:55	sirriffsalothp	Never heard that, hang on :O
2016-11-03 03:46:25	JazzyEagle	Yeah, a clip of it.

2016-11-03 03:48:30	sirriffsalothp	JazzyEagle: I honestly can't hear much similarity on that first one :S
2016-11-03 03:48:47	JazzyEagle	You can't hear it?
2016-11-03 03:49:01	sirriffsalothp	It's not as complex at all really...

2016-11-03 03:49:25	sirriffsalothp	Towards the end it's kinda like it but meh, don't really hear it helping me figure it out :)
2016-11-03 03:49:37	sirriffsalothp	Lemme check out the live one
2016-11-03 03:50:03	JazzyEagle	Ok.
2016-11-03 03:50:21	JazzyEagle	It also sounds like you want a different type of drumbeat, as I'm listening further into your recording.

2016-11-03 03:52:27	sirriffsalothp	pifie: the drummer is actually the Randler Music guy, he used to fiddle with heavy stuff on guitar but never on drums much. He just said he'd give it a go, he thought it sounded sweet though
2016-11-03 03:52:36	JazzyEagle	Personally, I feel what the drummer is trying to do is too complex.  I think it needs a more straightforward beat.
2016-11-03 03:52:50	pifie	oh, then, I'd say that if you want to play it live, it depends on the drummer mostly
2016-11-03 03:53:20	JazzyEagle	Some of the stuff he's trying to do sounds like it'd be good as drum fills or to break up the beat a tad, but I don't think it should be the main beat.
2016-11-03 03:53:32	pifie	the drummer I 'worked with' has a very good musical mind so to go for the same side, accents and all
2016-11-03 03:54:13	pifie	JazzyEagle: just think of your riff as accents, as bass drum and snare
2016-11-03 03:54:30	sirriffsalothp	Drums aside, any thoughts on the riff in general?
2016-11-03 03:54:33	pifie	make the simplest drumline you can think of by such, for example, thinking of the high notes with accents as snares
2016-11-03 03:54:39	pifie	and the lowest as bass drums
2016-11-03 03:54:50	pifie	sirriffsalothp: It's okay, very violin-like
2016-11-03 03:54:57	JazzyEagle	sirriffsalothp: I love it.
2016-11-03 03:54:58	pifie	could be a cello
2016-11-03 03:55:10	JazzyEagle	I wish I could write riffs like that, but they never come to me.
2016-11-03 03:55:29	pifie	I like that it's a long riff, but I find the drone mute thing a bit tiring
2016-11-03 03:57:06	pifie	I wouldn't repeat it more than 4 times in a row
2016-11-03 03:59:09	pifie	the drummer is trying to make the drums 'function' properly, making them somehow stable. I don't think you can get away with it, in particular in the last bit where the pedal note changes

2016-11-03 04:02:56	sirriffsalothp	pifie: never tried it with a cello... there's a cello-player in the school, might as her to try those two phrases just for the lols
2016-11-03 04:03:40	sirriffsalothp	pifie: the palm-mute thing I'm with you on, I actually have it recorded properly without it, it's just there I was so accustommed to it that's what came out

2016-11-03 04:04:19	holycrunchitz	guess it won't hurt to try
2016-11-03 04:04:28	sirriffsalothp	pifie: I guess this goes to show that it's not so much about learning music theory as just doing the work more thoroughly
2016-11-03 04:09:25	pifie	holycrunchitz: anger stems from supposing your wishes have to do with reality
2016-11-03 04:09:48	pifie	sirriffsalothp: not really. I think your palm muting is out of the feeling of having no bass there
2016-11-03 04:10:03	pifie	If a bass is already filling that up, you won't need it
2016-11-03 04:10:37	pifie	BUT, make your drummer program drums, and think about the accents on your guitar playing, so that you can tradeoff accents and all between drums and guitar for the benefit of music
2016-11-03 04:11:50	pifie	sirriffsalothp: for example, pay attention to this drummer. I suppose you know the song even if you don't like it, but check how the accents of the voice are supported by the accents of the drums https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8YDMdMXtmI

2016-11-03 15:04:42	blotchy	having fun with the calf effects, but i have to startup ardour to wire the stuff correctly (instead of just fluidsynth and qjackctl)
2016-11-03 15:05:01	blotchy	there must be a way to drop ardour when i'm not interested in recording
2016-11-03 15:06:22	blotchy	seems like i need the keyboard to go into fluidsynth (left to right), then fluidsynth to calf, but fluidsynth doesn't show up on the left

2016-11-03 15:25:44	blotchy	yea, i guess an effects host
2016-11-03 15:25:49	blotchy	haven't looked at Carla
2016-11-03 15:26:01	blotchy	started playing with jack rack though, that seems very helpful
2016-11-03 15:26:31	Stuzz	I would expect to see audio outs from fluidsynth 'on the left'
2016-11-03 15:26:31	blotchy	i'd rather not use a studio thing -- i should have everything i need on fedora (i think)
2016-11-03 15:26:43	blotchy	Stuzz, ok, that's helpful
2016-11-03 15:26:56	Stuzz	You don't have to use KX for carla
2016-11-03 15:26:58	blotchy	maybe it's a setting on fluidsynth i'm missing
2016-11-03 15:27:02	Stuzz	That's just who wrote it is all
2016-11-03 15:27:35	blotchy	i'll look at carla, i've seen plenty of talk about it, but didn't understand what it got me
2016-11-03 15:27:50	Stuzz	Your not looking in the MIDI tab for fluidsynth outs are you?
2016-11-03 15:28:13	blotchy	no nothing's under midi
2016-11-03 15:28:16	Stuzz	I haven't used Carla, and also don't know what it gets you :)
2016-11-03 15:28:26	blotchy	but that did occur to me -- that i had to use midi pass thru or somesuch
2016-11-03 15:28:28	Stuzz	Yep..  so fluidsynth doesn't output MIDI
2016-11-03 15:28:39	blotchy	right
2016-11-03 15:28:43	Stuzz	You don't want to send MIDI to Calf anyway - it wants audio
2016-11-03 15:28:48	blotchy	right
2016-11-03 15:29:05	holstein	midi to synth to calf :)
2016-11-03 15:29:09	blotchy	that's why when i use ardour -- and i have that all working -- i feed fluidsynth to calf

2016-11-03 15:30:24	blotchy	holstein, agreed, but it should be doable with qjackctl alone instead of ardour (i think)
2016-11-03 15:31:08	Stuzz	Well..  you hear fluidsynth don't you?
2016-11-03 15:31:17	Stuzz	So it's audio outs are going to your speakers
2016-11-03 15:31:21	holstein	yup..
2016-11-03 15:31:25	holstein	well.. with jack
2016-11-03 15:31:41	Stuzz	I'd guess what you don't have is Calf on the right
2016-11-03 15:31:55	blotchy	yea it's all working with ardour -- just don't know how to cut ardour out (and i can just use ardour to setup the cxn, don't even need tracks to be added)
2016-11-03 15:32:22	blotchy	i think calf is on the right, but it's getting fluidsynth on the left
2016-11-03 15:32:22		[15:32]
2016-11-03 15:32:31	holstein	however you want to or need to route.. sometimes, its a matter of alsa midi vs jack midi.. a2jmidid helped me in those cases
2016-11-03 15:32:33	blotchy	well if it's doable, i'll keep monkying with it
2016-11-03 15:32:47	blotchy	right, haven't played with a2jmidi either
2016-11-03 15:32:54	Stuzz	but but... if you can hear fluidsynth it must be on the left, no?
2016-11-03 15:33:18	blotchy	no, because the keyboard on left to fluidsynth on right (w/o calf)
2016-11-03 15:33:23	blotchy	that works fine
2016-11-03 15:33:33	Stuzz	What about the Audio tab?
2016-11-03 15:34:07	blotchy	i think it has nothing, but i mix that up with the alsa tab
2016-11-03 15:34:17	blotchy	have to go look ;)
2016-11-03 15:34:24	holstein	you'll route your controller, to the sound module you want, to the effects you want, to the output of your card.. however that ends up looking in whatever connections manager you are using
2016-11-03 15:34:29	Stuzz	I think what you need is keyboard ->midi->fluidsynth->audio->calf->audio->speakers
2016-11-03 15:34:39	holstein	yup ^
2016-11-03 15:35:09	Stuzz	At the moment you have all that without calf in the middle assuming you can hear fluidsynth
2016-11-03 15:35:43	holstein	if thats true, then, you'll put the efffects in the chain, in the audio tab area
2016-11-03 15:35:46	blotchy	yea, only playing with alsa tab, audio has nothing
2016-11-03 15:35:47	Stuzz	AFAIK, Calf isn't standalone, so will need a host of some type (ardour/carla) to host it
2016-11-03 15:35:50	holstein	post fluidsynth
2016-11-03 15:36:07	Stuzz	to host it... and see it on the right
2016-11-03 15:36:21	blotchy	i've been playing with a "jack" calf, while there' s also a dssi (?) calf
2016-11-03 15:36:21	holstein	you have fluidsynth routed, in the audio tab.. you'll basically interrupt that with that effects host
2016-11-03 15:36:40	holstein	i just use whatever i can get to show up where i need
2016-11-03 15:37:01	Stuzz	"audio has nothing" rly?
2016-11-03 15:37:04	blotchy	ok, maybe i should be seeing something in the audio tab
2016-11-03 15:37:14	holstein	yeah.. if audio tab has nothing? thats a problem
2016-11-03 15:37:26	blotchy	right, all of the stuff i've been usinng is in the alsa tab
2016-11-03 15:37:27	holstein	its something you are applying to the audio
2016-11-03 15:37:37	blotchy	maybe it's my jack args
2016-11-03 15:37:43	holstein	yup.. that wont add what you need.., AFAIK
2016-11-03 15:37:58	Stuzz	Audio SHOULD have anything with audio outs on the left (fluidsynth), and anything with audio in on the right (your system's output to speakers)
2016-11-03 15:38:08	holstein	agreed ^
2016-11-03 15:38:36	holstein	and, be able to basically reroute that r and l outs of fluidsynth into whatever plugin host, and add effects to the path
2016-11-03 15:38:46	blotchy	interesting, ok -- well just with no calf, i can feed keyboard to fluidsynth all on alsa tab, and it works
2016-11-03 15:39:00	Stuzz	plugin host should be on both the left and right in the Audio tab
2016-11-03 15:39:06	holstein	yup
2016-11-03 15:39:12	holstein	blotchy: thats midi, though
2016-11-03 15:39:12	blotchy	ok, i'll look more at the missing audio stuff, thats certainly interesting
2016-11-03 15:39:26	Stuzz	Can Calf be stand-alone?
2016-11-03 15:39:48	holstein	blotchy: you are "feeding" your controller, that is midi, to the midi input of the sound module, fluid synth.. in the alsa midi tab..
2016-11-03 15:39:59	blotchy	not sure, i bring up a little GUI calf, but i pick between a jack and DSSI one
2016-11-03 15:40:11	holstein	*after* that is happening, you can add an effect, with calf.. but, not to midi data.. you'll do it *post* fluid synth
2016-11-03 15:40:11	blotchy	yes, that's what i'm doing
2016-11-03 15:40:18	holstein	with some host, that will show up in the audio tab
2016-11-03 15:40:22	blotchy	right, i understand that
2016-11-03 15:40:42	blotchy	i mean about the midi being converted to audio by the synth and all
2016-11-03 15:40:55	Stuzz	host or no host, the input of your speakers should be on the right in the audio tab
2016-11-03 15:40:59	blotchy	the fact that i can do it all with ardour lets me know i now have a clue
2016-11-03 15:40:59	holstein	yup ^
2016-11-03 15:41:06	holstein	you  should have *something* in the audio tab..
2016-11-03 15:41:10	blotchy	ok
2016-11-03 15:41:11	Stuzz	I dunno how that doesn't happen :)
2016-11-03 15:41:25	blotchy	i'll look more for that answer
2016-11-03 15:41:26	holstein	ardour is just  doing this for you
2016-11-03 15:41:42	holstein	taking your midi channel, and sticking the plugin in the audio side, where it needs to go
2016-11-03 15:41:57	blotchy	thanks for you patience guys, it's hard to know where to start with these questions
2016-11-03 15:42:05	blotchy	even if i've come a long way, ha ha
2016-11-03 15:42:06	Stuzz	Carla might do all that too
2016-11-03 15:42:13	blotchy	i'll look at that too
2016-11-03 15:42:16	Stuzz	(but I haven't used it to know)
2016-11-03 15:42:44	Stuzz	I normally find it's good to have Ardour open anyway, so when I've got something to record, I'm ready to go
2016-11-03 15:42:46	--	sR780k is now known as sR709k_
2016-11-03 15:43:06	holstein	yeah.. doensnt hurt to just use ardour..
2016-11-03 15:44:02	Stuzz	If you connect all correctly outside of Ardour, you'll need to reconnect everything if you want to use Ardour
2016-11-03 15:44:21	Stuzz	Well..  maybe not everything, but more than nothing
2016-11-03 15:44:35	blotchy	right for the home situation but where i need to setup quickly with others i might want to skip it
2016-11-03 15:45:07	blotchy	i've been playingi quite a bit with recording as well, but hey, the focus is always changing
2016-11-03 15:45:34	blotchy	starting with some reggae guys after doing jazz for a while -- with jazz i just stuck with the piano sound all the time
2016-11-03 15:45:53	blotchy	now suddenly i want a good command over effects, which are mostly new to me :)
2016-11-03 15:47:28	blotchy	now i need to figure out a nice way to hang the little netbook off the keyboard, but that's a puzzle for tomorrow, haha
2016-11-03 15:47:28		[15:47]
2016-11-03 15:49:00	holstein	i used a tiered stand... also, just another stand, with a board.. or a card table. or, velcro.. gaff tape.. the floor.. the top of the amp..
2016-11-03 15:49:50	blotchy	i was wondering about a sling or somesuch
2016-11-03 15:50:13	blotchy	mght end up with the doubel stand as well, to have 2 sounds w/o splitting one keyboard
2016-11-03 15:51:05	blotchy	hmm, board, i like that idea, esp. if it would just lay down inside the stand

2016-11-03 22:49:41	Stuzz	[01:37:01] "audio has nothing" rly? [01:37:01]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:37:04] ok, maybe i should be seeing something in the audio tab [01:37:04]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	holstein	[01:37:14] yeah.. if audio tab has nothing? thats a problem [01:37:14]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:37:26] right, all of the stuff i've been usinng is in the alsa tab [01:37:26]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	holstein	[01:37:27] its something you are applying to the audio [01:37:27]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:37:37] maybe it's my jack args [01:37:37]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	holstein	[01:37:43] yup.. that wont add what you need.., AFAIK [01:37:43]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	Stuzz	[01:37:58] Audio SHOULD have anything with audio outs on the left (fluidsynth), and anything with audio in on the right (your system's output to speakers) [01:37:58]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	holstein	[01:38:08] agreed ^ [01:38:08]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	holstein	[01:38:36] and, be able to basically reroute that r and l outs of fluidsynth into whatever plugin host, and add effects to the path [01:38:36]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:38:46] interesting, ok -- well just with no calf, i can feed keyboard to fluidsynth all on alsa tab, and it works [01:38:46]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	Stuzz	[01:39:00] plugin host should be on both the left and right in the Audio tab [01:39:00]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	holstein	[01:39:06] yup [01:39:06]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	holstein	[01:39:12] blotchy: thats midi, though [01:39:12]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:39:12] ok, i'll look more at the missing audio stuff, thats certainly interesting [01:39:12]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	Stuzz	[01:39:26] Can Calf be stand-alone? [01:39:26]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	holstein	[01:39:48] blotchy: you are "feeding" your controller, that is midi, to the midi input of the sound module, fluid synth.. in the alsa midi tab.. [01:39:48]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:39:59] not sure, i bring up a little GUI calf, but i pick between a jack and DSSI one [01:39:59]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	holstein	[01:40:11] *after* that is happening, you can add an effect, with calf.. but, not to midi data.. you'll do it *post* fluid synth [01:40:11]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:40:11] yes, that's what i'm doing [01:40:11]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	holstein	[01:40:18] with some host, that will show up in the audio tab [01:40:18]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:40:22] right, i understand that [01:40:22]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:40:42] i mean about the midi being converted to audio by the synth and all [01:40:42]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	Stuzz	[01:40:55] host or no host, the input of your speakers should be on the right in the audio tab [01:40:55]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:40:59] the fact that i can do it all with ardour lets me know i now have a clue [01:40:59]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	holstein	[01:40:59] yup ^ [01:40:59]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	holstein	[01:41:05] you  should have *something* in the audio tab.. [01:41:05]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:41:10] ok [01:41:10]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	Stuzz	[01:41:11] I dunno how that doesn't happen :) [01:41:11]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:41:25] i'll look more for that answer [01:41:25]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	holstein	[01:41:26] ardour is just  doing this for you [01:41:26]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	holstein	[01:41:42] taking your midi channel, and sticking the plugin in the audio side, where it needs to go [01:41:42]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:41:57] thanks for you patience guys, it's hard to know where to start with these questions [01:41:57]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:42:05] even if i've come a long way, ha ha [01:42:05]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	Stuzz	[01:42:06] Carla might do all that too [01:42:06]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:42:13] i'll look at that too [01:42:13]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	Stuzz	[01:42:16] (but I haven't used it to know) [01:42:16]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	Stuzz	[01:42:44] I normally find it's good to have Ardour open anyway, so when I've got something to record, I'm ready to go [01:42:44]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	holstein	[01:43:06] yeah.. doensnt hurt to just use ardour.. [01:43:06]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	Stuzz	[01:44:02] If you connect all correctly outside of Ardour, you'll need to reconnect everything if you want to use Ardour [01:44:02]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	Stuzz	[01:44:21] Well..  maybe not everything, but more than nothing [01:44:21]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:44:35] right for the home situation but where i need to setup quickly with others i might want to skip it [01:44:35]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:45:07] i've been playingi quite a bit with recording as well, but hey, the focus is always changing [01:45:07]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:45:34] starting with some reggae guys after doing jazz for a while -- with jazz i just stuck with the piano sound all the time [01:45:34]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:45:53] now suddenly i want a good command over effects, which are mostly new to me :) [01:45:53]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:47:28] now i need to figure out a nice way to hang the little netbook off the keyboard, but that's a puzzle for tomorrow, haha [01:47:28]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	holstein	[01:49:00] i used a tiered stand... also, just another stand, with a board.. or a card table. or, velcro.. gaff tape.. the floor.. the top of the amp.. [01:49:00]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:49:50] i was wondering about a sling or somesuch [01:49:50]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:50:13] mght end up with the doubel stand as well, to have 2 sounds w/o splitting one keyboard [01:50:13]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	blotchy	[01:51:05] hmm, board, i like that idea, esp. if it would just lay down inside the stand [01:51:05]

2016-11-04 07:13:41	delest_	The Hungarian language goes far back. It developed in a very particular manner and its structure reaches back to times, when most of the now spoken European languages did not even exist. It is a language which developed steadily and firmly in itself, and in which there is logic and mathematics with the adaptability and malleability of strength and chords. The Englishmen should be proud that his language indicates an epic of
2016-11-04 07:13:41	delest_	human history. One can show forth its origin; and alien layers can be distinguished in it, which gathered together during the contacts with different nations. Whereas the Hungarian language is like a rubble-stone; consisting of only one piece, on which the storms of time left not a scratch. It's not a calendar that adjusts to the changes of the ages. It needs no one, it doesn't borrow, does no buckstering, and doesn't give or
2016-11-04 07:13:42	delest_	take from anyone. This language is the oldest and most glorious monument of a national sovereignty and a mental independence. What scholars cannot solve, they ignore. In philosophy it's the same way as archeology. The floors of the old Egyptian temples, which were made out of only one rock, can't be explained. No one knows where they came from, or from which mountain the wonderous mass was taken. How they were transported and
2016-11-04 07:13:49	delest_	lifted to the top of the temples. The genuineness of the Hungarian language is a phenomenon much more wonderous than this. He who solves it shall be analyzing the Divine secret; in fact the first thesis of this secret: “In the beginning there was Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

2016-11-04 15:15:41	onehundred	[01:12:04] and the knowledge about mix mastering etc are related with the nature [01:12:04]
2016-11-04 15:15:41	brainspoil	[01:12:54] it helps watching youtube vids where they discuss basics, Mixin and mastering are quite different animals to tame [01:12:54]

2016-11-04 15:15:41	brainspoil	[01:13:33] you wanna keep enough headroom in your mixes to give the mastering guy some leeway [01:13:33]
2016-11-04 15:15:41	onehundred	[01:14:19] i have a laptop and a technics headphone hence i guess that have got a good mix is odissey [01:14:19]

2016-11-05 04:22:29	onehundred	a ok i see
2016-11-05 04:23:09	gcrk	but my aim is to use a daw behind luppp to do some extra stuff. effects, mixing and something like this
2016-11-05 04:23:09	onehundred	i thought that you will use the midi controller, for controller some daw
2016-11-05 04:23:40	gcrk	i have another one to do this ;)
2016-11-05 04:23:59	gcrk	btw if you dont have much money but need a controller, think about building one on your own...
2016-11-05 04:24:17	onehundred	yeah i seee midibox or arduino
2016-11-05 04:24:26	onehundred	but it's very hard for me
2016-11-05 04:25:12	onehundred	i guess that learn about building a midi controller is very tedius for me
2016-11-05 04:25:28	gcrk	arduino should be the cheaper one... about 2,50€ für one arduino nano from china, plus some analog inputs in a old cookie jar
2016-11-05 04:25:30	onehundred	i like make music etc
2016-11-05 04:26:34	onehundred	yeah it's very cheaper but programing, and build etc
2016-11-05 04:26:57	onehundred	i think that is necessary a electronics  tool for make a  circuit
2016-11-05 04:28:52	gcrk	you can use a breadbord so you dont need to solder anything. but its extra cost...
2016-11-05 04:28:55	gcrk	*breadboard
2016-11-05 04:29:44	onehundred	i see some video in youtube, seems cool too

2016-11-05 04:33:03	gcrk	arduino is really pretty easy, i guess everyone can "learn" it. you dont even have to learn it, you just need to read the tutorials and do it the same
2016-11-05 04:34:00	onehundred	i don't know about arduino anyway
2016-11-05 04:34:12	onehundred	sound interesting
2016-11-05 04:34:34	onehundred	maybe i will investigate in the future
2016-11-05 04:34:37	dmbaturin	gcrk: Well... You can learn to do things from tutorials by reading tutorials and nothing else, unless you take time to learn the details of those GPIO library at least.
2016-11-05 04:35:42	gcrk	dmbaturin: what i mean was: you dont need to understand whats going on, you can just rebuild what others did.
2016-11-05 04:37:04	dmbaturin	I've seen people getting started with it, one step beyond the tutorial and they were helpless. Some gave up, those who didn't essentially became real MC programmers. :)
2016-11-05 04:37:04		[04:37]
2016-11-05 04:38:30	gcrk	it wasnt about getting real mc programmers, but about building a midi controller ;)
2016-11-05 04:39:30	onehundred	anyway i am interesting in synthezer, music, sound design etc
2016-11-05 04:40:05	onehundred	but investigate about other thing is interesting too
2016-11-05 04:42:16	onehundred	i have to leave, bye everyone. Regards

2016-11-05 04:58:31	dmbaturin	My personal issue with things that are supposed to make MC programming easier like arduino is that I have no idea what to do with them. Or, I do of course, but I'm too much of an engineer to make things that only work under certain conditions, especilly when it comes to home automation etc.
2016-11-05 04:59:31	gcrk	dmbaturin: its not for people who know to do stuff with a real microcontroller
2016-11-05 04:59:48	gcrk	but for eg me, its great. i just want thinks work...
2016-11-05 05:00:36	dmbaturin	Me too. So, I don't make things for which exact boundaries of when they work are not verified. :)
2016-11-05 05:05:59	dmbaturin	Well, the real issue of course is that I don't exactly need or want anything that is forgiving enough to ignore the proper engineering entirely. I bet some do have tasks like that (myself, I'd rather know my MIDI controller doesn't randomly fail or produce gargage too).
