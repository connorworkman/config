2016-10-17 14:21:53	holstein	yeah, i think the way it was *actually* said, was. "it *deserves* to be destroyed by the truth"
2016-10-17 14:22:04	holstein	thats a bit different, than the command that is "must" be..
2016-10-17 14:22:46	holstein	much more evocative.. i think.. to think that, because something can have truth tear it down, that it *deserves* to be torn down..

2016-10-17 16:31:39	holstein	and, i would like to actually steer it into speaking constructively about what we could do to address the issues that im sure we could all agree on..
2016-10-17 16:32:03	holstein	or, just *not* see the spam in here, anymore, since, ive asked that it not be linked..
2016-10-17 16:32:04	Stuzz	That's difficult when your talking to someone not listening to you
2016-10-17 16:32:23	holstein	yup..
2016-10-17 16:32:50	holstein	its so ironic.. when you poke at any of these links, and they start looking like fraud ;)
2016-10-17 16:33:02	holstein	its just hillary-ous
2016-10-17 16:33:05	Stuzz	Just don't poke

2016-10-17 16:39:42	holstein	like, you can "delete" emails, in this day and age ;)
2016-10-17 16:41:10	holstein	Stuzz: see what im saying? though? how hard it is?
2016-10-17 16:41:17	holstein	i mean.. thats reddit ;)
2016-10-17 16:41:41	holstein	its like shooting fish in a barrel.. when someone uses reddit sources? to legitimize some facts ?

2016-10-17 16:42:56	Stuzz	Yeah, well...  klopsi-u3 is a wild and crazy guy.  I'm happy for him to be so.
2016-10-17 16:43:32	Stuzz	I'm not klopsi-u3, so s'all good.
2016-10-17 16:44:24	Stuzz	If I wanted to be entertained I might click on a link or two, but I have little other reason to do so
2016-10-17 16:44:28	holstein	yeah.. im sure i'll learn to be better about it.. but reddit? you know? ;)

2016-10-17 16:45:26	holstein	she stated that, in the debate..
2016-10-17 16:45:44	Stuzz	I see no harm when there's no other talk in here (unless there's new folks being scared away).
2016-10-17 16:46:07	holstein	id rather see it go to a politics channel
2016-10-17 16:46:23	holstein	since, it can be quite divisive, and
2016-10-17 16:46:23		[16:46]
2016-10-17 16:46:49	holstein	there are those places here, that i want folks to have access to.. i mean, thats why we support freenode.. so *anyone* can talk about whatever they want
2016-10-17 16:47:10	holstein	but, i can /ignore.. and thats fine.. occasionally, i just get caught up in the irony, and cant help it
2016-10-17 16:47:44	holstein	i mean, i literally heard her state that, first hand, in the debate.. for example. we dont really need a wiki leaks entry about that. since, she just said it, first hand ;)

2016-10-17 16:52:24	Stuzz	holstein: As a (I assume) voting 'merican...  Do you get anything useful out of the debates?
2016-10-17 16:53:25	holstein	nah
2016-10-17 16:53:35	holstein	i mean, i watched them..
2016-10-17 16:53:46	holstein	but, i think folks are pretty much set...
2016-10-17 16:53:56	holstein	i think, its more of a ratings grab, these days
2016-10-17 16:54:17	holstein	its more of a random show, like some reality TV thing.. where, its allowed to get "off the rails"..
2016-10-17 16:54:43	holstein	thats entertaining, rather than,  facilitating a "good" debate..
2016-10-17 16:55:24	Stuzz	Was it hosted by Jerry Springer?
2016-10-17 16:55:32	holstein	i know, right?!
2016-10-17 16:55:36	Stuzz	:)
2016-10-17 16:55:42	holstein	the last one was just allowed to be such a mess
2016-10-17 16:55:51	Stuzz	I didn't watch 'em
2016-10-17 16:55:58	holstein	you just stop the debate. its easy
2016-10-17 16:56:06	holstein	"we are going to stop if you talk over each other"
2016-10-17 16:56:09	holstein	and you stop that shit
2016-10-17 16:56:10	Stuzz	I actually closed my IRC client 'cause I didn't want to even see anything about it
2016-10-17 16:56:43	Stuzz	I know I can't affect anything related to it, so it simply has no worth for me
2016-10-17 16:56:55	holstein	and we say, to the US public.. "the debates stopped because the adults we have chosen as candidates couldnt communicate respectfully within the parameters of the debate"
2016-10-17 16:57:29	holstein	yeah.. and, im not sure i can affect anything about it.. but, id like to talk about how to constructively do so...
2016-10-17 16:57:42	Stuzz	Well...  you can vote
2016-10-17 16:57:50	holstein	what would it take to elect a 3rd party candidate?
2016-10-17 16:58:08	holstein	how do we stop this "career politician" problem?
2016-10-17 16:58:22	holstein	its supposed to be *representatives* of us.. the fucking actual people
2016-10-17 16:58:30	holstein	if it were? it wouldnt be as much of a problem for sure
2016-10-17 16:58:46	holstein	there would be skin in the game, so to speak
2016-10-17 16:59:01	holstein	im actually not a conspiracy theorist. i think this is just people, doing things people do..
2016-10-17 16:59:07	Stuzz	Representatives, as selected by who?
2016-10-17 16:59:23	holstein	they are out of touch, and greedy, and busy... and not realistic representatives of us
2016-10-17 16:59:36	Stuzz	As far as I can tell, the system doesn't really work as it is.  But, I don't have another one.
2016-10-17 16:59:40	holstein	Stuzz: it was intended to be normal folks, rotating in..
2016-10-17 16:59:53	Stuzz	But I really don't know much 'bout politics (or anything) at all
2016-10-17 16:59:59	holstein	Stuzz: yup. but, the system? as it is? is not really implemented 100% as intended
2016-10-17 17:00:14	Stuzz	No?
2016-10-17 17:00:17	holstein	i think, if one couldnt make a career of this, that would be a good start

2016-10-17 17:00:43	holstein	right. its literally the term.. representatives.. delegates.. but, they are not really normal folks..
2016-10-17 17:01:07	holstein	it should be, we *all* take a turn there.. and, then, the collective has more say.
2016-10-17 17:01:36	holstein	its a mess, all the way up to the presidential canidates, though.. where, they are chosen more for who can when the popularity contest.. or who knows..
2016-10-17 17:01:36		[17:01]
2016-10-17 17:02:13	holstein	again.. i agree with you Stuzz.. i dont have a "better" solution, necessarily.. but, i do think this simple thing would be a nice start.. and address this corporate greed
2016-10-17 17:02:26	Stuzz	Do y'all have city/state elections too?
2016-10-17 17:02:56	holstein	if it were just normal folks? taking 6 month turns? saying "oh shit, i have to go back and live in that town.. im not going to make that bad decision, just because it helps me in this career path to senate" or whatever
2016-10-17 17:03:15	holstein	Stuzz: yup. local elections..
2016-10-17 17:03:22	Stuzz	k
2016-10-17 17:03:50	Stuzz	What's Obama get to do afterwards?
2016-10-17 17:03:58	holstein	who knows..
2016-10-17 17:04:04	holstein	relax, im sure..
2016-10-17 17:04:14	holstein	he looks like he's aged like 20 years..
