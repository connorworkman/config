2016-09-09 06:22:48	xeorex	Looking at the Roland DJ Controller. Seems like they did like on the MCX8000, the major complain is mirrored desk
2016-09-09 06:27:30	@phusion	*sigh* I don't think I'm going to play my set this weekend
2016-09-09 06:27:39	@phusion	I've been playing once a month for like three years
2016-09-09 06:28:12	@phusion	but the old promoter guy alienated like everyone, I work full time and even if I did have time to put posters up everywhere, no one wants to come to that bar anymore
2016-09-09 06:29:50	@phusion	and last time the sound guy took half my pay (I get 15% of the bar) because he had to mess with the levels a lot, admittedly, since none of my DJ friends will play there anymore, I have to dip into some older, downloaded (not ripped) tracks that aren't mastered well to fill 4.5 fucking hours
2016-09-09 06:30:15	toastercookie	lol aww
2016-09-09 06:36:00		[06:30]

2016-09-09 06:41:56	@phusion	so I'm pretty sure they replaced me for next month anyway
2016-09-09 06:42:02	@phusion	so not playing this month, meh, whatever
2016-09-09 06:42:20	@phusion	had a good run, but no one wants to play there anymore, I only get randoms
2016-09-09 06:42:38	toastercookie	yea for me its not rly worth it unless its fun
