2016-10-17 12:33:54	CalamityVic	very interesting

2016-10-17 12:51:21	Ycros	CalamityVic: how is the SMR? It's something I've been pondering about for a while, but at the same time a lot of times I've seen it used it seems a bit meh
2016-10-17 12:51:24	raz	have you never been to a titty bar?
2016-10-17 12:51:46	CalamityVic	Ycros: it's... well... it's very powerful if you need a resonator
2016-10-17 12:52:01	Estr	Yes I live there
2016-10-17 12:52:20	CalamityVic	it can really bring out interesting textures in an audio landscape though, and it's fantastic in getting CV from audio
2016-10-17 12:52:37	Ycros	aha, that's an interesting use
2016-10-17 12:52:42	CalamityVic	also the chords it makes is great, and it tracks 1v oct
2016-10-17 12:53:11	CalamityVic	It's a resonator powerhouse, it's fun, but I honestly rarely use it
2016-10-17 12:53:22	Ycros	I ponder the rainmaker as well
