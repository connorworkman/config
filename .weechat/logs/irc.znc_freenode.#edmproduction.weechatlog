2016-10-17 12:31:55	raz	no, but i'm adding elasticity like never befoaaaar
2016-10-17 12:32:05	Ycros	oh neat you can chain 2 of bastl's popcorn sequencers to get a bigger sequencer
2016-10-17 12:32:38	CalamityVic	Popcorn is triggers only right?
2016-10-17 12:33:06	CalamityVic	Oh sorry that's the knit rider
2016-10-17 12:33:19	CalamityVic	Ycros, tell me about the CV Trinity
2016-10-17 12:33:21	CalamityVic	what does it do
2016-10-17 12:33:24	Ycros	yeah. Popcorn does cv, you can use it as a quantizer
2016-10-17 12:33:34	Ycros	trinity is 6 lfos/envs/step-recorders
2016-10-17 12:33:54	CalamityVic	very interesting
2016-10-17 12:34:10	Ycros	it's a lot of modulation in a small package

2016-10-17 12:51:21	Ycros	CalamityVic: how is the SMR? It's something I've been pondering about for a while, but at the same time a lot of times I've seen it used it seems a bit meh
2016-10-17 12:51:24	raz	have you never been to a titty bar?
2016-10-17 12:51:46	CalamityVic	Ycros: it's... well... it's very powerful if you need a resonator
2016-10-17 12:52:01	Estr	Yes I live there
2016-10-17 12:52:20	CalamityVic	it can really bring out interesting textures in an audio landscape though, and it's fantastic in getting CV from audio
2016-10-17 12:52:37	Ycros	aha, that's an interesting use
2016-10-17 12:52:42	CalamityVic	also the chords it makes is great, and it tracks 1v oct
2016-10-17 12:53:11	CalamityVic	It's a resonator powerhouse, it's fun, but I honestly rarely use it
2016-10-17 12:53:22	Ycros	I ponder the rainmaker as well
2016-10-17 12:54:49	CalamityVic	rainmaker seems very cool but I don't have use for it I think
2016-10-17 12:54:49		[12:54]
2016-10-17 12:55:07	CalamityVic	I need an inspiring sequencer I think

2016-10-17 13:11:42	MSHMTX	hey guys what a good counterpart to serum
2016-10-17 13:11:50	MSHMTX	aka does the kind of sounds serum isnt really good at
2016-10-17 13:14:06	wrl	aalto or kaivo
2016-10-17 13:17:18	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'd have to say diva
2016-10-17 13:18:07	MSHMTX	yea?
2016-10-17 13:18:14	MSHMTX	diva kills my cpu meter hard lol
2016-10-17 13:18:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	falcon worth looking in to too
2016-10-17 13:18:19	wrl	diva's good
2016-10-17 13:18:20	MSHMTX	and i hate the interface
2016-10-17 13:18:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	falcon _definitely_ covers areas that serum does not
2016-10-17 13:18:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	and it's still very synthy despite being a sampler
2016-10-17 13:18:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	MSHMTX: well, bazille or diva really... they're kinda interchangeable in this context
2016-10-17 13:19:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	but falcon is definitely worth a look if you're trying to shore up serum weaknesses
2016-10-17 13:19:33	MSHMTX	Bazille looks interesting
2016-10-17 13:19:40	MSHMTX	thx
2016-10-17 13:19:48	MSHMTX	maybe ill dive into Diva a bit more
2016-10-17 13:20:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	you can probably recreate most things diva does in serum if you were really going to take the time
2016-10-17 13:20:22		[13:20]
2016-10-17 13:20:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	same for bazille
2016-10-17 13:20:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	but it'd involve some ridiculous wavetable fuckery
2016-10-17 13:20:42	raz	diva is a cpu eating cunt
2016-10-17 13:20:45	raz	but she sounds so ohsom
2016-10-17 13:23:25	Ycros	so delicious
2016-10-17 13:23:42	Ycros	diva <3
2016-10-17 13:24:17	wrl	bazille is a more interesting synth tho
2016-10-17 13:24:26	wrl	also it's like
2016-10-17 13:24:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	yeah, I'm a bazille man.
2016-10-17 13:24:36	wrl	you can find weirder stuff even than diva
2016-10-17 13:24:41	wrl	i'd really give the madrona stuff a look
2016-10-17 13:24:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	diva isn't weird at all though
2016-10-17 13:24:48	wrl	yeah, exactly
2016-10-17 13:24:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	like... it's about as standard as you can get
2016-10-17 13:24:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	just done really, really fucking well
2016-10-17 13:25:02	wrl	aalto and kaivo are worth a look. they can do some weird stuff.
2016-10-17 13:26:25	Nahck	FM8
2016-10-17 13:27:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	pretty sure serum can pretty easily cover FM8's sound palette pretty well
2016-10-17 13:27:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	pretty
2016-10-17 13:27:16	Ycros	yeah bazille is great
2016-10-17 13:27:53	Ycros	diva is a great set of emulations of a bunch of old synths
2016-10-17 13:33:00		[13:27]
2016-10-17 13:39:14	MSHMTX	yeah FM8 is not what im lookin fo
