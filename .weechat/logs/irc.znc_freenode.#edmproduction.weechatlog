2016-10-17 12:32:05	Ycros	oh neat you can chain 2 of bastl's popcorn sequencers to get a bigger sequencer
2016-10-17 12:32:38	CalamityVic	Popcorn is triggers only right?
2016-10-17 12:33:06	CalamityVic	Oh sorry that's the knit rider
2016-10-17 12:33:19	CalamityVic	Ycros, tell me about the CV Trinity
2016-10-17 12:33:21	CalamityVic	what does it do
2016-10-17 12:33:24	Ycros	yeah. Popcorn does cv, you can use it as a quantizer
2016-10-17 12:33:34	Ycros	trinity is 6 lfos/envs/step-recorders
2016-10-17 12:33:54	CalamityVic	very interesting
2016-10-17 12:34:10	Ycros	it's a lot of modulation in a small package

2016-10-17 12:51:24	raz	have you never been to a titty bar?
2016-10-17 12:51:46	CalamityVic	Ycros: it's... well... it's very powerful if you need a resonator
2016-10-17 12:52:01	Estr	Yes I live there
2016-10-17 12:52:20	CalamityVic	it can really bring out interesting textures in an audio landscape though, and it's fantastic in getting CV from audio
2016-10-17 12:52:37	Ycros	aha, that's an interesting use
2016-10-17 12:52:42	CalamityVic	also the chords it makes is great, and it tracks 1v oct
2016-10-17 12:53:11	CalamityVic	It's a resonator powerhouse, it's fun, but I honestly rarely use it
2016-10-17 12:53:22	Ycros	I ponder the rainmaker as well
2016-10-17 12:54:49	CalamityVic	rainmaker seems very cool but I don't have use for it I think

2016-10-17 13:11:42	MSHMTX	hey guys what a good counterpart to serum
2016-10-17 13:11:50	MSHMTX	aka does the kind of sounds serum isnt really good at
2016-10-17 13:14:06	wrl	aalto or kaivo
2016-10-17 13:17:18	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'd have to say diva
2016-10-17 13:18:07	MSHMTX	yea?
2016-10-17 13:18:14	MSHMTX	diva kills my cpu meter hard lol
2016-10-17 13:18:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	falcon worth looking in to too
2016-10-17 13:18:19	wrl	diva's good
2016-10-17 13:18:20	MSHMTX	and i hate the interface
2016-10-17 13:18:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	falcon _definitely_ covers areas that serum does not
2016-10-17 13:18:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	and it's still very synthy despite being a sampler
2016-10-17 13:18:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	MSHMTX: well, bazille or diva really... they're kinda interchangeable in this context
2016-10-17 13:19:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	but falcon is definitely worth a look if you're trying to shore up serum weaknesses
2016-10-17 13:19:33	MSHMTX	Bazille looks interesting
2016-10-17 13:19:40	MSHMTX	thx
2016-10-17 13:19:48	MSHMTX	maybe ill dive into Diva a bit more
2016-10-17 13:20:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	you can probably recreate most things diva does in serum if you were really going to take the time
2016-10-17 13:20:22		[13:20]
2016-10-17 13:20:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	same for bazille
2016-10-17 13:20:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	but it'd involve some ridiculous wavetable fuckery
2016-10-17 13:20:42	raz	diva is a cpu eating cunt
2016-10-17 13:20:45	raz	but she sounds so ohsom
2016-10-17 13:23:25	Ycros	so delicious
2016-10-17 13:23:42	Ycros	diva <3
2016-10-17 13:24:17	wrl	bazille is a more interesting synth tho
2016-10-17 13:24:26	wrl	also it's like
2016-10-17 13:24:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	yeah, I'm a bazille man.
2016-10-17 13:24:36	wrl	you can find weirder stuff even than diva
2016-10-17 13:24:41	wrl	i'd really give the madrona stuff a look
2016-10-17 13:24:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	diva isn't weird at all though
2016-10-17 13:24:48	wrl	yeah, exactly
2016-10-17 13:24:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	like... it's about as standard as you can get
2016-10-17 13:24:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	just done really, really fucking well
2016-10-17 13:25:02	wrl	aalto and kaivo are worth a look. they can do some weird stuff.
2016-10-17 13:26:25	Nahck	FM8
2016-10-17 13:27:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	pretty sure serum can pretty easily cover FM8's sound palette pretty well
2016-10-17 13:27:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	pretty
2016-10-17 13:27:16	Ycros	yeah bazille is great
2016-10-17 13:27:53	Ycros	diva is a great set of emulations of a bunch of old synths
2016-10-17 13:33:00		[13:27]
2016-10-17 13:39:14	MSHMTX	yeah FM8 is not what im lookin fo

2016-10-17 15:32:11	Roller	really happy with the sounds i have, just need to chip it out more
2016-10-17 15:32:46	Volterock	sweet
2016-10-17 15:33:15	Volterock	Do you ever wake up with song ideas? like from a dream
2016-10-17 15:33:27	Roller	nah forget them ahah
2016-10-17 15:33:47	Volterock	I can never remember mine either lol
2016-10-17 15:33:51	Roller	can't say i've ever directly used an idea from a dream but i've experienced music in dreams sure
2016-10-17 15:34:08	Volterock	Maybe we should ask in the subreddit, what is the best bed to get for dream song ideas
2016-10-17 15:34:23	Roller	haha you think you could get a special mattress?
2016-10-17 15:34:51	Roller	i get sick ideas in dreams but never ever recall even more than vaguely after i wake up for like 20 seconds max lol
2016-10-17 15:35:02	Volterock	yes, and I'm thinking "memory" foam would be best so we can remember our songs
2016-10-17 15:35:10	Roller	ahahah
2016-10-17 15:35:57	Roller	it's cool though sometimes i hear complex stuff in dreams and it makes me think about artistic potential and stuff like that
2016-10-17 15:36:22	Volterock	ah that's the worst when you barely remember just enough that you had something cool but then forget it right away
2016-10-17 15:36:35	Roller	happens everytime :P
2016-10-17 15:36:56	Roller	sometimes i've even thought about leaving a recorder by the bed so i can hum it or some shit
2016-10-17 15:37:10	Roller	well beatbox all the sounds badly lol
2016-10-17 15:37:31	Volterock	yeah, even if we can't remember we can be like, "yeah, I had this hit banger once. It's in a dream. Still there... couldn't get it out"
2016-10-17 15:38:04	Volterock	that's a great idea! just hum it right away when you're awaking
2016-10-17 15:39:05	Roller	could work
2016-10-17 15:39:24	--	Frisky-Kat is now known as FriskyKat
2016-10-17 15:39:25	Volterock	then import the wav recording and convert to midi for endless sleepspiration jams
2016-10-17 15:40:04	Roller	exactly, pull the groove and you will have some inspiration at least to work towards that banger
2016-10-17 15:40:28	Roller	i've heard alot of creatives use that technique
2016-10-17 15:40:37	Roller	tv writers often say they wake up with an idea
2016-10-17 15:40:40	Roller	shower is another one ahah
2016-10-17 15:40:43	Volterock	FriskyKat, y u frisky?
2016-10-17 15:41:04	Roller	have a pad by the side of the bed kinda thing
2016-10-17 15:41:10	Volterock	really? that should be explored more. Ah yes, the shower!
2016-10-17 15:41:42	Volterock	My memory is in my butt cause I remember everything when I sit down
2016-10-17 15:42:01	Volterock	like a paper pad? or midi controller pad?
2016-10-17 15:42:04	Roller	ahah i am fairly the same if you mean you always remember stuff at inopportne times
2016-10-17 15:42:31	Roller	just saying i heard that some writers keep a pad by their bed for the same reason
2016-10-17 15:42:42	Roller	i'd use a recorder myself
2016-10-17 15:42:56	Roller	wake up and quickly try to make noises of what i remember ahah
2016-10-17 15:43:45	Volterock	I'm going to start doing that now
2016-10-17 15:43:45		[15:43]
2016-10-17 15:44:12	Volterock	or even if you don't get a song idea, you can have your lips do an interpretive dance of the dream you had which might lead to an interesting song
2016-10-17 15:44:37	Roller	exactly, end of the day it's going to give you ideas to work with and hopefully inspiration which is always good in my mind
2016-10-17 15:46:08	Volterock	Hey, is there a weekly meetup still for song feedback? I know there was one on plug.dj like two times a week
2016-10-17 15:46:26	Roller	myself, i don't know someone else might
2016-10-17 15:48:47	Volterock	I remember them moving it to a different site when plug.dj went down, but I think it's back now

2016-10-17 16:05:59	Roller	it's just a little bit bare maybe, some variation in percussion for example, little different motifs to keep interest

2016-10-18 04:40:10	jnav	is aftertouch worth it? I kinda suck at playing piano
2016-10-18 04:40:21	jnav	the keyboard I bought doesn't have aftertouch (though it supports it via MIDI in)
2016-10-18 04:40:50	CalamityVic	What aftertouch is about is having a way to control your sound - it can be achieved in a multitude of ways
2016-10-18 04:41:12	CalamityVic	it's just....nice? feels good to just dig into the keys and have it reflect in your sound
2016-10-18 04:41:29	CalamityVic	wheels or joysticks get boring - never tried foot pedals tho
2016-10-18 04:41:30	jnav	ah
2016-10-18 04:41:54	jnav	I'll live with the wheel for now, I guess... it is an 80s synth after all
2016-10-18 04:42:08	CalamityVic	what synth?
2016-10-18 04:42:27	jnav	Ensoniq ESQ-1
2016-10-18 04:42:32	CalamityVic	very good choice

2016-10-18 04:43:02	jnav	it's got a lot of modulation options that I get to experiment with
2016-10-18 04:43:09	jnav	also it was C H E A P: $350
2016-10-18 04:43:18	CalamityVic	whoa, great price
2016-10-18 04:43:30	jnav	some guy trying to expand his modular synth was trying to dump it on Craiglist

2016-10-18 04:44:08	jnav	have you ever used a synth's internal sequencer? is it worth learning?
2016-10-18 04:44:19	jnav	I'm extremely comfortable in a DAW, so
2016-10-18 04:44:21	CalamityVic	I used the ESQ and it's very powerful

2016-10-18 04:44:40	jnav	yeah that was kinda my thought
2016-10-18 04:44:45	Nahck	heh i built a pedal board outta excess gear lying around
2016-10-18 04:45:04	Nahck	plugged it in and it started to smell like electricity

2016-10-18 04:45:43	jnav	pitched noise also seems kinda interesting
2016-10-18 04:45:58	jnav	also that goddamn "kick" wave

2016-10-18 04:46:44	CalamityVic	jnav: I would program stuff with tons of ring mod and stuff, the formants were cool to modulate with but they aren't very rich

2016-10-18 05:11:21	jnav	I set up a craigslist email alert to find slick deals
2016-10-18 05:11:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	that's like being up to 150mg of cocaine a sniff and not being sure if you're in to it yet
2016-10-18 05:11:32	heyheywoah	should i not have said a shit ton?
2016-10-18 05:11:38	heyheywoah	well,
2016-10-18 05:11:40	jnav	heyheywoah: what music do you make? like, wouldn't it make sense to consider your workflow before buying stuff?
2016-10-18 05:11:57	heyheywoah	i've been producing for 7 years. i know i like making music.
2016-10-18 05:12:07	heyheywoah	so, i wanted to try making music out of the box.
2016-10-18 05:12:17	Nahck	experimenting with different gear is worth money
2016-10-18 05:12:23	heyheywoah	jnav all kinds of music. rock, pop, electronic
2016-10-18 05:12:47	heyheywoah	i want to be able to go out and gig with my stuff
2016-10-18 05:12:55	jnav	fair nuff
2016-10-18 05:12:56	heyheywoah	i can't go out and gig with just an OB-6
2016-10-18 05:13:00	heyheywoah	well,
2016-10-18 05:13:03	heyheywoah	that's debatable.

2016-10-18 05:15:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	jnav: the whole rig was very neatly wired, everything was fixed in place and I made a hard case for it with wheels
2016-10-18 05:15:37	AdmiralBumbleBee	jnav: it literally took 45 seconds to unpack and plug-in
2016-10-18 05:15:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	abotu 2 minutes to pack up

2016-10-18 05:15:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	you can see how neat everything is in the picture
2016-10-18 05:16:04	jnav	I'd certainly be incapable of maintaining that kind of live setup
2016-10-18 05:16:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	I did about 120 shows with that shit, mostly experimental/ambient stuff
2016-10-18 05:16:19	heyheywoah	Nahck yeah i think i want to start with just some effects to run my volcas through
2016-10-18 05:16:25	Nahck	AdmiralBumbleBee: i was going to ask u abouth synths and guitar pedals earlier today
2016-10-18 05:16:31	heyheywoah	AdmiralBumbleBee super cool
2016-10-18 05:16:33	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: dude... I have SO MANY FUCKING PEDALS
2016-10-18 05:16:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	not so many synths any more, but I've owned a shitload :\
2016-10-18 05:16:49	Nahck	what do u think about the impedances and shit
2016-10-18 05:16:59	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: depends on the pedal and routing
2016-10-18 05:17:09	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: and if/what/how many buffers you have in your flow
2016-10-18 05:17:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	and what your thoughts on buffers are
2016-10-18 05:17:36	heyheywoah	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJoCpJnnLWQ this was the first thing i recorded with my "live" setup
2016-10-18 05:17:40	polyvox	^ SHXRWOOD - Korg Volca Beats, Sample, Bass, Keys, FM - Techno Improv Jam 01 [YouTube]
2016-10-18 05:17:40	Nahck	for synths especially. have u been using attenuators and di boxes?
2016-10-18 05:18:02	heyheywoah	and i guess the reason why i'm leaning toward modular,
2016-10-18 05:18:11	heyheywoah	is because doing that is kind of hard
2016-10-18 05:18:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: with synths I use a re-amp box I made myself
2016-10-18 05:18:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: basically just a transformer and some bits
2016-10-18 05:19:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: and last thing in the chain is always an eventide box (space, time factor or pitch factor)
2016-10-18 05:19:10	Nahck	AdmiralBumbleBee: and wat are ur fav pedals with synths
2016-10-18 05:19:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	since they have switchable line/guitar out
2016-10-18 05:19:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: everything.
2016-10-18 05:19:26	Nahck	oh eventide nice
2016-10-18 05:19:30	AdmiralBumbleBee	I have a modded echolution phi that is fucking insane

2016-10-18 05:19:44	heyheywoah	AdmiralBumbleBee what's your opinion on strymon stuff?
2016-10-18 05:19:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	but my favorite pedal of all time is still either a circuit-bent dd-5 or my de7
2016-10-18 05:19:53	Nahck	know any good schematic for a reamp box?
2016-10-18 05:20:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: yeah, sec let me look it up
2016-10-18 05:20:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	heyheywoah: cool shit

2016-10-18 05:20:26	heyheywoah	ah
2016-10-18 05:21:04	heyheywoah	everyone says they love the big sky, so i put that on my wishlist radar
2016-10-18 05:21:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: look up 'line2amp'... I can't get a link to the schematic because google is being retarded
2016-10-18 05:21:41	Nahck	i like my digitech polara with the jx3p
2016-10-18 05:21:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: it's very similar to what I did, but I have a different transformer
2016-10-18 05:22:01	Nahck	transformers mhmhm
2016-10-18 05:22:24	heyheywoah	AdmiralBumbleBee do you think buying volcas was a bad idea then? should i have started somewhere else?
2016-10-18 05:22:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	heyheywoah: does it even matter?
2016-10-18 05:22:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	I think you know what I think...
2016-10-18 05:22:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	but what do you think?

2016-10-18 05:24:13	Nahck	you can sample the vocas and do some cool shit

2016-10-18 05:44:49	subsignal	maybe 1 hour instead
2016-10-18 05:44:58	subsignal	better then loosing 4
2016-10-18 05:45:09	raz	does it say how fix the strange letter thing?
2016-10-18 05:45:23	raz	i'm indeed thinking this may be related to an updated... when it started i got this weird "auto updates?" pop up for the first time
2016-10-18 05:45:30	raz	and then it doesn't load the set... I/O error... fucking cunt
2016-10-18 05:45:45	subsignal	joys of dawing
2016-10-18 05:45:50	Nahck	raz, dunno try google
2016-10-18 05:45:55	Roller	you can unfold the project in the explorer in ableton
2016-10-18 05:46:02	Roller	it should have all the audio..midi
2016-10-18 05:46:23	Roller	at least i think that's how i did it, just saying you can recover :)
2016-10-18 05:46:35	raz	ye..trying that now
2016-10-18 05:46:48	subsignal	interesting
2016-10-18 05:47:14	Nahck	or if the earlier version of ableton is still there u can try opening the project with it
2016-10-18 05:47:39	Roller	yeah it's not a lost cause definitely

2016-10-18 05:47:42	subsignal	does fl have that recover feature
2016-10-18 05:47:43	subsignal	hmm
2016-10-18 05:48:23	Roller	not sure, i don't even remember exactly how i did it but i remember you just expand it somehow in the explorer and ableton has bounced out your stems from the latest save as it goes along
2016-10-18 05:48:25	Roller	pretty neat
2016-10-18 05:48:29	raz	nope, can't unfold it either... parse error
2016-10-18 05:48:31	Roller	ahh shit
2016-10-18 05:48:41	raz	must have been a short write or something...  the file is suspiciously small too
2016-10-18 05:48:42	subsignal	sheeet
2016-10-18 05:48:45	Roller	manually drag stuff out the project file is all i can suggest :/
2016-10-18 05:49:02	subsignal	get some alcohol and cry a bit
2016-10-18 05:49:06	Roller	or that ahah
2016-10-18 05:49:21	raz	the only thing i can access is the samples... and the version from 4h ago... :X
2016-10-18 05:49:31	Roller	yeah i just checked it's only samples isn't it :(
2016-10-18 05:49:40	subsignal	rip
2016-10-18 05:49:40		[05:49]
2016-10-18 05:49:43	Roller	previous ver you can try to unpack?
2016-10-18 05:49:52	subsignal	u must rebuild stronger then last time
2016-10-18 05:49:56	Roller	faster, bassier
2016-10-18 05:50:19	raz	yeh.. it wasn't even great anyway..
2016-10-18 05:50:25	raz	but this is scary.. ugh
2016-10-18 05:50:35	Roller	who knows when it may strike again
2016-10-18 05:50:43	subsignal	thats why i save new versions all the time
2016-10-18 05:51:03	Roller	it's a good habit to get into
2016-10-18 05:51:13	raz	yea.. piece of shit ableton should do that automatically
2016-10-18 05:51:16	subsignal	saves tears and deadlines
2016-10-18 05:51:26	subsignal	yea im not sure why there isnt a save new version auto save..
2016-10-18 05:51:27	subsignal	so dumb
2016-10-18 05:51:32	XMPPwocky	my renoise is set to save a copy every 15 minutes
2016-10-18 05:51:40	subsignal	renoise for the win
2016-10-18 05:51:42	subsignal	they got it right
2016-10-18 05:51:47	Roller	does it consolidate all the files into the new copy?
2016-10-18 05:51:52	Roller	or is it just the project data
2016-10-18 05:51:55	subsignal	just the project
2016-10-18 05:51:59	XMPPwocky	works great (also you can pull those backups out and go back to them)
2016-10-18 05:52:29	Roller	i try to save a ver everytime i feel i've hit a 'checkpoint'...make sure i save all the files with it aswell
2016-10-18 05:52:29	XMPPwocky	a renoise project file contains all samples, plugin data, etc. they're self-contained except for your actual vsts
2016-10-18 05:52:34	Roller	ahh okay cool
2016-10-18 05:52:35	Roller	thats' handy
2016-10-18 05:54:00	subsignal	XMPPwocky: so if u save a new version its copying everything to the new project file?
2016-10-18 05:54:17	subsignal	it doesn't references files ?
2016-10-18 05:54:32	XMPPwocky	copying everything to the old file, the original file still stays there

2016-10-18 05:54:46	subsignal	interesting approach
2016-10-18 05:54:47	Nahck	i didnt even know theresan auto saein aleton
2016-10-18 05:54:55	Roller	Collect all and sav
2016-10-18 05:54:58	XMPPwocky	saving when you have big samples takes a while
2016-10-18 05:55:01	Nahck	auto save fuck it
2016-10-18 05:55:03	XMPPwocky	which is the only real downside
2016-10-18 05:55:08	subsignal	yea thats what i was thinking
2016-10-18 05:55:15	subsignal	more hardrive space
2016-10-18 05:55:15	Roller	nahck save a new version of the project, then just hit collect all and save
2016-10-18 05:55:17	XMPPwocky	but it's in the background
2016-10-18 05:55:18	subsignal	but i guess its worth it
2016-10-18 05:55:29	Roller	it'll consolidate it all into the new save your on
2016-10-18 05:55:41	XMPPwocky	and you can have it wait to save until you stop playing so you don't get surprise cpu spikes
2016-10-18 05:55:42	Roller	uses up hd space
2016-10-18 05:55:56	Nahck	AdmiralBumbleBee: what kind of a transformer would you recommend for a reamp?
2016-10-18 05:56:24	Roller	I used a shitty guitar amp when i tried to replicate it at home if thats what you mean by a transformer?
2016-10-18 05:56:30	Nahck	for synth stuff. im probably too lazy to ever reamp a guitar
2016-10-18 05:57:02	XMPPwocky	like impedance transformer?
2016-10-18 05:57:13	Nahck	reamp as in building a reamp box yeah
2016-10-18 05:57:22	Roller	i used a guitar amp and some pedals
2016-10-18 05:57:30	Roller	it was effective but the cone was shit and it hissed and blahh
2016-10-18 05:57:48	Roller	oh the box?
2016-10-18 05:57:52	Nahck	sounds like a fun project plus the actual commercial things are expensive as fuck
2016-10-18 05:58:13	Roller	i did it without a box
2016-10-18 05:58:28	Nahck	the pigtronix keymaster looks interesting tho
2016-10-18 05:58:45	Roller	headphone out of my soundcard into the input on the amp
2016-10-18 05:58:59	Roller	but then you can't monitor properly etc you do really need the reamp box
2016-10-18 05:59:13	Roller	but if you just want to play around with it... it works
2016-10-18 06:00:14	Nahck	not going to reamp anything just want to play around with line level signals and guitar pedals

2016-10-18 07:48:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: it was 15k, not 50

2016-10-18 07:48:44	fScatxycle	thanks, yeah my orchestral library is becoming more complete and thus allows me to really go all out
2016-10-18 07:48:55	Nahck	but there was an interesting read on them @ tapeops
2016-10-18 07:49:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	I have a 15k:500
2016-10-18 07:49:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	600 would work fine
2016-10-18 07:49:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	slight high-end loss with the 15k:500, inconsequential for a guitar re-amp
2016-10-18 07:50:38	fScatxycle	I think I may have too much going on tho for normal epic proportions
2016-10-18 07:51:06	fScatxycle	epic orchestra often has a lot of ostinatos going on, but ostinatos generally don't serve as harmonic function. Most of my different things going on are harmonic functions which kinda clutter it up

2016-10-18 07:52:58	fScatxycle	also mural strings aren't that fantastic, but the horns I have are. The horns are doubled an octave below the strings and it makes them sound amazing

2016-10-18 11:48:21	indiechill	well i tried that but the synth in the first clip is different
2016-10-18 11:48:39	indiechill	so impossible right
2016-10-18 11:48:39	Roller	if you invert the phase they will cancel eachother out as the sine will basically upsidedown
2016-10-18 11:49:25	Roller	so the wave forms cancel eachothero ut
2016-10-18 11:49:30	Roller	but you need to be very exact
2016-10-18 11:49:36	indiechill	well lets say you have a saw and kick drum sample and the same thing just with a square and the same kick drum sample, can i extract the kick sample then
2016-10-18 11:49:42	Roller	no
2016-10-18 11:49:52	Roller	unless you do some very creative eqing
