2016-10-17 12:32:05	Ycros	oh neat you can chain 2 of bastl's popcorn sequencers to get a bigger sequencer
2016-10-17 12:32:38	CalamityVic	Popcorn is triggers only right?
2016-10-17 12:33:06	CalamityVic	Oh sorry that's the knit rider
2016-10-17 12:33:19	CalamityVic	Ycros, tell me about the CV Trinity
2016-10-17 12:33:21	CalamityVic	what does it do
2016-10-17 12:33:24	Ycros	yeah. Popcorn does cv, you can use it as a quantizer
2016-10-17 12:33:34	Ycros	trinity is 6 lfos/envs/step-recorders
2016-10-17 12:33:54	CalamityVic	very interesting
2016-10-17 12:34:10	Ycros	it's a lot of modulation in a small package

2016-10-17 12:51:24	raz	have you never been to a titty bar?
2016-10-17 12:51:46	CalamityVic	Ycros: it's... well... it's very powerful if you need a resonator
2016-10-17 12:52:01	Estr	Yes I live there
2016-10-17 12:52:20	CalamityVic	it can really bring out interesting textures in an audio landscape though, and it's fantastic in getting CV from audio
2016-10-17 12:52:37	Ycros	aha, that's an interesting use
2016-10-17 12:52:42	CalamityVic	also the chords it makes is great, and it tracks 1v oct
2016-10-17 12:53:11	CalamityVic	It's a resonator powerhouse, it's fun, but I honestly rarely use it
2016-10-17 12:53:22	Ycros	I ponder the rainmaker as well
2016-10-17 12:54:49	CalamityVic	rainmaker seems very cool but I don't have use for it I think

2016-10-17 13:11:42	MSHMTX	hey guys what a good counterpart to serum
2016-10-17 13:11:50	MSHMTX	aka does the kind of sounds serum isnt really good at
2016-10-17 13:14:06	wrl	aalto or kaivo
2016-10-17 13:17:18	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'd have to say diva
2016-10-17 13:18:07	MSHMTX	yea?
2016-10-17 13:18:14	MSHMTX	diva kills my cpu meter hard lol
2016-10-17 13:18:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	falcon worth looking in to too
2016-10-17 13:18:19	wrl	diva's good
2016-10-17 13:18:20	MSHMTX	and i hate the interface
2016-10-17 13:18:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	falcon _definitely_ covers areas that serum does not
2016-10-17 13:18:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	and it's still very synthy despite being a sampler
2016-10-17 13:18:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	MSHMTX: well, bazille or diva really... they're kinda interchangeable in this context
2016-10-17 13:19:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	but falcon is definitely worth a look if you're trying to shore up serum weaknesses
2016-10-17 13:19:33	MSHMTX	Bazille looks interesting
2016-10-17 13:19:40	MSHMTX	thx
2016-10-17 13:19:48	MSHMTX	maybe ill dive into Diva a bit more
2016-10-17 13:20:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	you can probably recreate most things diva does in serum if you were really going to take the time
2016-10-17 13:20:22		[13:20]
2016-10-17 13:20:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	same for bazille
2016-10-17 13:20:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	but it'd involve some ridiculous wavetable fuckery
2016-10-17 13:20:42	raz	diva is a cpu eating cunt
2016-10-17 13:20:45	raz	but she sounds so ohsom
2016-10-17 13:23:25	Ycros	so delicious
2016-10-17 13:23:42	Ycros	diva <3
2016-10-17 13:24:17	wrl	bazille is a more interesting synth tho
2016-10-17 13:24:26	wrl	also it's like
2016-10-17 13:24:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	yeah, I'm a bazille man.
2016-10-17 13:24:36	wrl	you can find weirder stuff even than diva
2016-10-17 13:24:41	wrl	i'd really give the madrona stuff a look
2016-10-17 13:24:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	diva isn't weird at all though
2016-10-17 13:24:48	wrl	yeah, exactly
2016-10-17 13:24:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	like... it's about as standard as you can get
2016-10-17 13:24:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	just done really, really fucking well
2016-10-17 13:25:02	wrl	aalto and kaivo are worth a look. they can do some weird stuff.
2016-10-17 13:26:25	Nahck	FM8
2016-10-17 13:27:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	pretty sure serum can pretty easily cover FM8's sound palette pretty well
2016-10-17 13:27:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	pretty
2016-10-17 13:27:16	Ycros	yeah bazille is great
2016-10-17 13:27:53	Ycros	diva is a great set of emulations of a bunch of old synths
2016-10-17 13:33:00		[13:27]
2016-10-17 13:39:14	MSHMTX	yeah FM8 is not what im lookin fo

2016-10-17 15:32:11	Roller	really happy with the sounds i have, just need to chip it out more
2016-10-17 15:32:46	Volterock	sweet
2016-10-17 15:33:15	Volterock	Do you ever wake up with song ideas? like from a dream
2016-10-17 15:33:27	Roller	nah forget them ahah
2016-10-17 15:33:47	Volterock	I can never remember mine either lol
2016-10-17 15:33:51	Roller	can't say i've ever directly used an idea from a dream but i've experienced music in dreams sure
2016-10-17 15:34:08	Volterock	Maybe we should ask in the subreddit, what is the best bed to get for dream song ideas
2016-10-17 15:34:23	Roller	haha you think you could get a special mattress?
2016-10-17 15:34:51	Roller	i get sick ideas in dreams but never ever recall even more than vaguely after i wake up for like 20 seconds max lol
2016-10-17 15:35:02	Volterock	yes, and I'm thinking "memory" foam would be best so we can remember our songs
2016-10-17 15:35:10	Roller	ahahah
2016-10-17 15:35:57	Roller	it's cool though sometimes i hear complex stuff in dreams and it makes me think about artistic potential and stuff like that
2016-10-17 15:36:22	Volterock	ah that's the worst when you barely remember just enough that you had something cool but then forget it right away
2016-10-17 15:36:35	Roller	happens everytime :P
2016-10-17 15:36:56	Roller	sometimes i've even thought about leaving a recorder by the bed so i can hum it or some shit
2016-10-17 15:37:10	Roller	well beatbox all the sounds badly lol
2016-10-17 15:37:31	Volterock	yeah, even if we can't remember we can be like, "yeah, I had this hit banger once. It's in a dream. Still there... couldn't get it out"
2016-10-17 15:38:04	Volterock	that's a great idea! just hum it right away when you're awaking
2016-10-17 15:39:05	Roller	could work
2016-10-17 15:39:24	--	Frisky-Kat is now known as FriskyKat
2016-10-17 15:39:25	Volterock	then import the wav recording and convert to midi for endless sleepspiration jams
2016-10-17 15:40:04	Roller	exactly, pull the groove and you will have some inspiration at least to work towards that banger
2016-10-17 15:40:28	Roller	i've heard alot of creatives use that technique
2016-10-17 15:40:37	Roller	tv writers often say they wake up with an idea
2016-10-17 15:40:40	Roller	shower is another one ahah
2016-10-17 15:40:43	Volterock	FriskyKat, y u frisky?
2016-10-17 15:41:04	Roller	have a pad by the side of the bed kinda thing
2016-10-17 15:41:10	Volterock	really? that should be explored more. Ah yes, the shower!
2016-10-17 15:41:42	Volterock	My memory is in my butt cause I remember everything when I sit down
2016-10-17 15:42:01	Volterock	like a paper pad? or midi controller pad?
2016-10-17 15:42:04	Roller	ahah i am fairly the same if you mean you always remember stuff at inopportne times
2016-10-17 15:42:31	Roller	just saying i heard that some writers keep a pad by their bed for the same reason
2016-10-17 15:42:42	Roller	i'd use a recorder myself
2016-10-17 15:42:56	Roller	wake up and quickly try to make noises of what i remember ahah
2016-10-17 15:43:45	Volterock	I'm going to start doing that now
2016-10-17 15:43:45		[15:43]
2016-10-17 15:44:12	Volterock	or even if you don't get a song idea, you can have your lips do an interpretive dance of the dream you had which might lead to an interesting song
2016-10-17 15:44:37	Roller	exactly, end of the day it's going to give you ideas to work with and hopefully inspiration which is always good in my mind
2016-10-17 15:46:08	Volterock	Hey, is there a weekly meetup still for song feedback? I know there was one on plug.dj like two times a week
2016-10-17 15:46:26	Roller	myself, i don't know someone else might
2016-10-17 15:48:47	Volterock	I remember them moving it to a different site when plug.dj went down, but I think it's back now

2016-10-17 16:05:59	Roller	it's just a little bit bare maybe, some variation in percussion for example, little different motifs to keep interest
