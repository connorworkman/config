2016-10-17 12:32:05	Ycros	oh neat you can chain 2 of bastl's popcorn sequencers to get a bigger sequencer
2016-10-17 12:32:38	CalamityVic	Popcorn is triggers only right?
2016-10-17 12:33:06	CalamityVic	Oh sorry that's the knit rider
2016-10-17 12:33:19	CalamityVic	Ycros, tell me about the CV Trinity
2016-10-17 12:33:21	CalamityVic	what does it do
2016-10-17 12:33:24	Ycros	yeah. Popcorn does cv, you can use it as a quantizer
2016-10-17 12:33:34	Ycros	trinity is 6 lfos/envs/step-recorders
2016-10-17 12:33:54	CalamityVic	very interesting
2016-10-17 12:34:10	Ycros	it's a lot of modulation in a small package

2016-10-17 12:51:24	raz	have you never been to a titty bar?
2016-10-17 12:51:46	CalamityVic	Ycros: it's... well... it's very powerful if you need a resonator
2016-10-17 12:52:01	Estr	Yes I live there
2016-10-17 12:52:20	CalamityVic	it can really bring out interesting textures in an audio landscape though, and it's fantastic in getting CV from audio
2016-10-17 12:52:37	Ycros	aha, that's an interesting use
2016-10-17 12:52:42	CalamityVic	also the chords it makes is great, and it tracks 1v oct
2016-10-17 12:53:11	CalamityVic	It's a resonator powerhouse, it's fun, but I honestly rarely use it
2016-10-17 12:53:22	Ycros	I ponder the rainmaker as well
2016-10-17 12:54:49	CalamityVic	rainmaker seems very cool but I don't have use for it I think

2016-10-17 13:11:42	MSHMTX	hey guys what a good counterpart to serum
2016-10-17 13:11:50	MSHMTX	aka does the kind of sounds serum isnt really good at
2016-10-17 13:14:06	wrl	aalto or kaivo
2016-10-17 13:17:18	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'd have to say diva
2016-10-17 13:18:07	MSHMTX	yea?
2016-10-17 13:18:14	MSHMTX	diva kills my cpu meter hard lol
2016-10-17 13:18:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	falcon worth looking in to too
2016-10-17 13:18:19	wrl	diva's good
2016-10-17 13:18:20	MSHMTX	and i hate the interface
2016-10-17 13:18:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	falcon _definitely_ covers areas that serum does not
2016-10-17 13:18:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	and it's still very synthy despite being a sampler
2016-10-17 13:18:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	MSHMTX: well, bazille or diva really... they're kinda interchangeable in this context
2016-10-17 13:19:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	but falcon is definitely worth a look if you're trying to shore up serum weaknesses
2016-10-17 13:19:33	MSHMTX	Bazille looks interesting
2016-10-17 13:19:40	MSHMTX	thx
2016-10-17 13:19:48	MSHMTX	maybe ill dive into Diva a bit more
2016-10-17 13:20:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	you can probably recreate most things diva does in serum if you were really going to take the time
2016-10-17 13:20:22		[13:20]
2016-10-17 13:20:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	same for bazille
2016-10-17 13:20:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	but it'd involve some ridiculous wavetable fuckery
2016-10-17 13:20:42	raz	diva is a cpu eating cunt
2016-10-17 13:20:45	raz	but she sounds so ohsom
2016-10-17 13:23:25	Ycros	so delicious
2016-10-17 13:23:42	Ycros	diva <3
2016-10-17 13:24:17	wrl	bazille is a more interesting synth tho
2016-10-17 13:24:26	wrl	also it's like
2016-10-17 13:24:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	yeah, I'm a bazille man.
2016-10-17 13:24:36	wrl	you can find weirder stuff even than diva
2016-10-17 13:24:41	wrl	i'd really give the madrona stuff a look
2016-10-17 13:24:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	diva isn't weird at all though
2016-10-17 13:24:48	wrl	yeah, exactly
2016-10-17 13:24:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	like... it's about as standard as you can get
2016-10-17 13:24:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	just done really, really fucking well
2016-10-17 13:25:02	wrl	aalto and kaivo are worth a look. they can do some weird stuff.
2016-10-17 13:26:25	Nahck	FM8
2016-10-17 13:27:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	pretty sure serum can pretty easily cover FM8's sound palette pretty well
2016-10-17 13:27:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	pretty
2016-10-17 13:27:16	Ycros	yeah bazille is great
2016-10-17 13:27:53	Ycros	diva is a great set of emulations of a bunch of old synths
2016-10-17 13:33:00		[13:27]
2016-10-17 13:39:14	MSHMTX	yeah FM8 is not what im lookin fo

2016-10-17 15:32:11	Roller	really happy with the sounds i have, just need to chip it out more
2016-10-17 15:32:46	Volterock	sweet
2016-10-17 15:33:15	Volterock	Do you ever wake up with song ideas? like from a dream
2016-10-17 15:33:27	Roller	nah forget them ahah
2016-10-17 15:33:47	Volterock	I can never remember mine either lol
2016-10-17 15:33:51	Roller	can't say i've ever directly used an idea from a dream but i've experienced music in dreams sure
2016-10-17 15:34:08	Volterock	Maybe we should ask in the subreddit, what is the best bed to get for dream song ideas
2016-10-17 15:34:23	Roller	haha you think you could get a special mattress?
2016-10-17 15:34:51	Roller	i get sick ideas in dreams but never ever recall even more than vaguely after i wake up for like 20 seconds max lol
2016-10-17 15:35:02	Volterock	yes, and I'm thinking "memory" foam would be best so we can remember our songs
2016-10-17 15:35:10	Roller	ahahah
2016-10-17 15:35:57	Roller	it's cool though sometimes i hear complex stuff in dreams and it makes me think about artistic potential and stuff like that
2016-10-17 15:36:22	Volterock	ah that's the worst when you barely remember just enough that you had something cool but then forget it right away
2016-10-17 15:36:35	Roller	happens everytime :P
2016-10-17 15:36:56	Roller	sometimes i've even thought about leaving a recorder by the bed so i can hum it or some shit
2016-10-17 15:37:10	Roller	well beatbox all the sounds badly lol
2016-10-17 15:37:31	Volterock	yeah, even if we can't remember we can be like, "yeah, I had this hit banger once. It's in a dream. Still there... couldn't get it out"
2016-10-17 15:38:04	Volterock	that's a great idea! just hum it right away when you're awaking
2016-10-17 15:39:05	Roller	could work
2016-10-17 15:39:24	--	Frisky-Kat is now known as FriskyKat
2016-10-17 15:39:25	Volterock	then import the wav recording and convert to midi for endless sleepspiration jams
2016-10-17 15:40:04	Roller	exactly, pull the groove and you will have some inspiration at least to work towards that banger
2016-10-17 15:40:28	Roller	i've heard alot of creatives use that technique
2016-10-17 15:40:37	Roller	tv writers often say they wake up with an idea
2016-10-17 15:40:40	Roller	shower is another one ahah
2016-10-17 15:40:43	Volterock	FriskyKat, y u frisky?
2016-10-17 15:41:04	Roller	have a pad by the side of the bed kinda thing
2016-10-17 15:41:10	Volterock	really? that should be explored more. Ah yes, the shower!
2016-10-17 15:41:42	Volterock	My memory is in my butt cause I remember everything when I sit down
2016-10-17 15:42:01	Volterock	like a paper pad? or midi controller pad?
2016-10-17 15:42:04	Roller	ahah i am fairly the same if you mean you always remember stuff at inopportne times
2016-10-17 15:42:31	Roller	just saying i heard that some writers keep a pad by their bed for the same reason
2016-10-17 15:42:42	Roller	i'd use a recorder myself
2016-10-17 15:42:56	Roller	wake up and quickly try to make noises of what i remember ahah
2016-10-17 15:43:45	Volterock	I'm going to start doing that now
2016-10-17 15:43:45		[15:43]
2016-10-17 15:44:12	Volterock	or even if you don't get a song idea, you can have your lips do an interpretive dance of the dream you had which might lead to an interesting song
2016-10-17 15:44:37	Roller	exactly, end of the day it's going to give you ideas to work with and hopefully inspiration which is always good in my mind
2016-10-17 15:46:08	Volterock	Hey, is there a weekly meetup still for song feedback? I know there was one on plug.dj like two times a week
2016-10-17 15:46:26	Roller	myself, i don't know someone else might
2016-10-17 15:48:47	Volterock	I remember them moving it to a different site when plug.dj went down, but I think it's back now

2016-10-17 16:05:59	Roller	it's just a little bit bare maybe, some variation in percussion for example, little different motifs to keep interest

2016-10-18 04:40:10	jnav	is aftertouch worth it? I kinda suck at playing piano
2016-10-18 04:40:21	jnav	the keyboard I bought doesn't have aftertouch (though it supports it via MIDI in)
2016-10-18 04:40:50	CalamityVic	What aftertouch is about is having a way to control your sound - it can be achieved in a multitude of ways
2016-10-18 04:41:12	CalamityVic	it's just....nice? feels good to just dig into the keys and have it reflect in your sound
2016-10-18 04:41:29	CalamityVic	wheels or joysticks get boring - never tried foot pedals tho
2016-10-18 04:41:30	jnav	ah
2016-10-18 04:41:54	jnav	I'll live with the wheel for now, I guess... it is an 80s synth after all
2016-10-18 04:42:08	CalamityVic	what synth?
2016-10-18 04:42:27	jnav	Ensoniq ESQ-1
2016-10-18 04:42:32	CalamityVic	very good choice

2016-10-18 04:43:02	jnav	it's got a lot of modulation options that I get to experiment with
2016-10-18 04:43:09	jnav	also it was C H E A P: $350
2016-10-18 04:43:18	CalamityVic	whoa, great price
2016-10-18 04:43:30	jnav	some guy trying to expand his modular synth was trying to dump it on Craiglist

2016-10-18 04:44:08	jnav	have you ever used a synth's internal sequencer? is it worth learning?
2016-10-18 04:44:19	jnav	I'm extremely comfortable in a DAW, so
2016-10-18 04:44:21	CalamityVic	I used the ESQ and it's very powerful

2016-10-18 04:44:40	jnav	yeah that was kinda my thought
2016-10-18 04:44:45	Nahck	heh i built a pedal board outta excess gear lying around
2016-10-18 04:45:04	Nahck	plugged it in and it started to smell like electricity

2016-10-18 04:45:43	jnav	pitched noise also seems kinda interesting
2016-10-18 04:45:58	jnav	also that goddamn "kick" wave

2016-10-18 04:46:44	CalamityVic	jnav: I would program stuff with tons of ring mod and stuff, the formants were cool to modulate with but they aren't very rich

2016-10-18 05:11:21	jnav	I set up a craigslist email alert to find slick deals
2016-10-18 05:11:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	that's like being up to 150mg of cocaine a sniff and not being sure if you're in to it yet
2016-10-18 05:11:32	heyheywoah	should i not have said a shit ton?
2016-10-18 05:11:38	heyheywoah	well,
2016-10-18 05:11:40	jnav	heyheywoah: what music do you make? like, wouldn't it make sense to consider your workflow before buying stuff?
2016-10-18 05:11:57	heyheywoah	i've been producing for 7 years. i know i like making music.
2016-10-18 05:12:07	heyheywoah	so, i wanted to try making music out of the box.
2016-10-18 05:12:17	Nahck	experimenting with different gear is worth money
2016-10-18 05:12:23	heyheywoah	jnav all kinds of music. rock, pop, electronic
2016-10-18 05:12:47	heyheywoah	i want to be able to go out and gig with my stuff
2016-10-18 05:12:55	jnav	fair nuff
2016-10-18 05:12:56	heyheywoah	i can't go out and gig with just an OB-6
2016-10-18 05:13:00	heyheywoah	well,
2016-10-18 05:13:03	heyheywoah	that's debatable.

2016-10-18 05:15:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	jnav: the whole rig was very neatly wired, everything was fixed in place and I made a hard case for it with wheels
2016-10-18 05:15:37	AdmiralBumbleBee	jnav: it literally took 45 seconds to unpack and plug-in
2016-10-18 05:15:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	abotu 2 minutes to pack up

2016-10-18 05:15:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	you can see how neat everything is in the picture
2016-10-18 05:16:04	jnav	I'd certainly be incapable of maintaining that kind of live setup
2016-10-18 05:16:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	I did about 120 shows with that shit, mostly experimental/ambient stuff
2016-10-18 05:16:19	heyheywoah	Nahck yeah i think i want to start with just some effects to run my volcas through
2016-10-18 05:16:25	Nahck	AdmiralBumbleBee: i was going to ask u abouth synths and guitar pedals earlier today
2016-10-18 05:16:31	heyheywoah	AdmiralBumbleBee super cool
2016-10-18 05:16:33	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: dude... I have SO MANY FUCKING PEDALS
2016-10-18 05:16:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	not so many synths any more, but I've owned a shitload :\
2016-10-18 05:16:49	Nahck	what do u think about the impedances and shit
2016-10-18 05:16:59	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: depends on the pedal and routing
2016-10-18 05:17:09	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: and if/what/how many buffers you have in your flow
2016-10-18 05:17:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	and what your thoughts on buffers are
2016-10-18 05:17:36	heyheywoah	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJoCpJnnLWQ this was the first thing i recorded with my "live" setup
2016-10-18 05:17:40	polyvox	^ SHXRWOOD - Korg Volca Beats, Sample, Bass, Keys, FM - Techno Improv Jam 01 [YouTube]
2016-10-18 05:17:40	Nahck	for synths especially. have u been using attenuators and di boxes?
2016-10-18 05:18:02	heyheywoah	and i guess the reason why i'm leaning toward modular,
2016-10-18 05:18:11	heyheywoah	is because doing that is kind of hard
2016-10-18 05:18:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: with synths I use a re-amp box I made myself
2016-10-18 05:18:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: basically just a transformer and some bits
2016-10-18 05:19:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: and last thing in the chain is always an eventide box (space, time factor or pitch factor)
2016-10-18 05:19:10	Nahck	AdmiralBumbleBee: and wat are ur fav pedals with synths
2016-10-18 05:19:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	since they have switchable line/guitar out
2016-10-18 05:19:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: everything.
2016-10-18 05:19:26	Nahck	oh eventide nice
2016-10-18 05:19:30	AdmiralBumbleBee	I have a modded echolution phi that is fucking insane

2016-10-18 05:19:44	heyheywoah	AdmiralBumbleBee what's your opinion on strymon stuff?
2016-10-18 05:19:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	but my favorite pedal of all time is still either a circuit-bent dd-5 or my de7
2016-10-18 05:19:53	Nahck	know any good schematic for a reamp box?
2016-10-18 05:20:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: yeah, sec let me look it up
2016-10-18 05:20:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	heyheywoah: cool shit

2016-10-18 05:20:26	heyheywoah	ah
2016-10-18 05:21:04	heyheywoah	everyone says they love the big sky, so i put that on my wishlist radar
2016-10-18 05:21:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: look up 'line2amp'... I can't get a link to the schematic because google is being retarded
2016-10-18 05:21:41	Nahck	i like my digitech polara with the jx3p
2016-10-18 05:21:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: it's very similar to what I did, but I have a different transformer
2016-10-18 05:22:01	Nahck	transformers mhmhm
2016-10-18 05:22:24	heyheywoah	AdmiralBumbleBee do you think buying volcas was a bad idea then? should i have started somewhere else?
2016-10-18 05:22:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	heyheywoah: does it even matter?
2016-10-18 05:22:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	I think you know what I think...
2016-10-18 05:22:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	but what do you think?

2016-10-18 05:24:13	Nahck	you can sample the vocas and do some cool shit

2016-10-18 05:44:49	subsignal	maybe 1 hour instead
2016-10-18 05:44:58	subsignal	better then loosing 4
2016-10-18 05:45:09	raz	does it say how fix the strange letter thing?
2016-10-18 05:45:23	raz	i'm indeed thinking this may be related to an updated... when it started i got this weird "auto updates?" pop up for the first time
2016-10-18 05:45:30	raz	and then it doesn't load the set... I/O error... fucking cunt
2016-10-18 05:45:45	subsignal	joys of dawing
2016-10-18 05:45:50	Nahck	raz, dunno try google
2016-10-18 05:45:55	Roller	you can unfold the project in the explorer in ableton
2016-10-18 05:46:02	Roller	it should have all the audio..midi
2016-10-18 05:46:23	Roller	at least i think that's how i did it, just saying you can recover :)
2016-10-18 05:46:35	raz	ye..trying that now
2016-10-18 05:46:48	subsignal	interesting
2016-10-18 05:47:14	Nahck	or if the earlier version of ableton is still there u can try opening the project with it
2016-10-18 05:47:39	Roller	yeah it's not a lost cause definitely

2016-10-18 05:47:42	subsignal	does fl have that recover feature
2016-10-18 05:47:43	subsignal	hmm
2016-10-18 05:48:23	Roller	not sure, i don't even remember exactly how i did it but i remember you just expand it somehow in the explorer and ableton has bounced out your stems from the latest save as it goes along
2016-10-18 05:48:25	Roller	pretty neat
2016-10-18 05:48:29	raz	nope, can't unfold it either... parse error
2016-10-18 05:48:31	Roller	ahh shit
2016-10-18 05:48:41	raz	must have been a short write or something...  the file is suspiciously small too
2016-10-18 05:48:42	subsignal	sheeet
2016-10-18 05:48:45	Roller	manually drag stuff out the project file is all i can suggest :/
2016-10-18 05:49:02	subsignal	get some alcohol and cry a bit
2016-10-18 05:49:06	Roller	or that ahah
2016-10-18 05:49:21	raz	the only thing i can access is the samples... and the version from 4h ago... :X
2016-10-18 05:49:31	Roller	yeah i just checked it's only samples isn't it :(
2016-10-18 05:49:40	subsignal	rip
2016-10-18 05:49:40		[05:49]
2016-10-18 05:49:43	Roller	previous ver you can try to unpack?
2016-10-18 05:49:52	subsignal	u must rebuild stronger then last time
2016-10-18 05:49:56	Roller	faster, bassier
2016-10-18 05:50:19	raz	yeh.. it wasn't even great anyway..
2016-10-18 05:50:25	raz	but this is scary.. ugh
2016-10-18 05:50:35	Roller	who knows when it may strike again
2016-10-18 05:50:43	subsignal	thats why i save new versions all the time
2016-10-18 05:51:03	Roller	it's a good habit to get into
2016-10-18 05:51:13	raz	yea.. piece of shit ableton should do that automatically
2016-10-18 05:51:16	subsignal	saves tears and deadlines
2016-10-18 05:51:26	subsignal	yea im not sure why there isnt a save new version auto save..
2016-10-18 05:51:27	subsignal	so dumb
2016-10-18 05:51:32	XMPPwocky	my renoise is set to save a copy every 15 minutes
2016-10-18 05:51:40	subsignal	renoise for the win
2016-10-18 05:51:42	subsignal	they got it right
2016-10-18 05:51:47	Roller	does it consolidate all the files into the new copy?
2016-10-18 05:51:52	Roller	or is it just the project data
2016-10-18 05:51:55	subsignal	just the project
2016-10-18 05:51:59	XMPPwocky	works great (also you can pull those backups out and go back to them)
2016-10-18 05:52:29	Roller	i try to save a ver everytime i feel i've hit a 'checkpoint'...make sure i save all the files with it aswell
2016-10-18 05:52:29	XMPPwocky	a renoise project file contains all samples, plugin data, etc. they're self-contained except for your actual vsts
2016-10-18 05:52:34	Roller	ahh okay cool
2016-10-18 05:52:35	Roller	thats' handy
2016-10-18 05:54:00	subsignal	XMPPwocky: so if u save a new version its copying everything to the new project file?
2016-10-18 05:54:17	subsignal	it doesn't references files ?
2016-10-18 05:54:32	XMPPwocky	copying everything to the old file, the original file still stays there

2016-10-18 05:54:46	subsignal	interesting approach
2016-10-18 05:54:47	Nahck	i didnt even know theresan auto saein aleton
2016-10-18 05:54:55	Roller	Collect all and sav
2016-10-18 05:54:58	XMPPwocky	saving when you have big samples takes a while
2016-10-18 05:55:01	Nahck	auto save fuck it
2016-10-18 05:55:03	XMPPwocky	which is the only real downside
2016-10-18 05:55:08	subsignal	yea thats what i was thinking
2016-10-18 05:55:15	subsignal	more hardrive space
2016-10-18 05:55:15	Roller	nahck save a new version of the project, then just hit collect all and save
2016-10-18 05:55:17	XMPPwocky	but it's in the background
2016-10-18 05:55:18	subsignal	but i guess its worth it
2016-10-18 05:55:29	Roller	it'll consolidate it all into the new save your on
2016-10-18 05:55:41	XMPPwocky	and you can have it wait to save until you stop playing so you don't get surprise cpu spikes
2016-10-18 05:55:42	Roller	uses up hd space
2016-10-18 05:55:56	Nahck	AdmiralBumbleBee: what kind of a transformer would you recommend for a reamp?
2016-10-18 05:56:24	Roller	I used a shitty guitar amp when i tried to replicate it at home if thats what you mean by a transformer?
2016-10-18 05:56:30	Nahck	for synth stuff. im probably too lazy to ever reamp a guitar
2016-10-18 05:57:02	XMPPwocky	like impedance transformer?
2016-10-18 05:57:13	Nahck	reamp as in building a reamp box yeah
2016-10-18 05:57:22	Roller	i used a guitar amp and some pedals
2016-10-18 05:57:30	Roller	it was effective but the cone was shit and it hissed and blahh
2016-10-18 05:57:48	Roller	oh the box?
2016-10-18 05:57:52	Nahck	sounds like a fun project plus the actual commercial things are expensive as fuck
2016-10-18 05:58:13	Roller	i did it without a box
2016-10-18 05:58:28	Nahck	the pigtronix keymaster looks interesting tho
2016-10-18 05:58:45	Roller	headphone out of my soundcard into the input on the amp
2016-10-18 05:58:59	Roller	but then you can't monitor properly etc you do really need the reamp box
2016-10-18 05:59:13	Roller	but if you just want to play around with it... it works
2016-10-18 06:00:14	Nahck	not going to reamp anything just want to play around with line level signals and guitar pedals

2016-10-18 07:48:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: it was 15k, not 50

2016-10-18 07:48:44	fScatxycle	thanks, yeah my orchestral library is becoming more complete and thus allows me to really go all out
2016-10-18 07:48:55	Nahck	but there was an interesting read on them @ tapeops
2016-10-18 07:49:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	I have a 15k:500
2016-10-18 07:49:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	600 would work fine
2016-10-18 07:49:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	slight high-end loss with the 15k:500, inconsequential for a guitar re-amp
2016-10-18 07:50:38	fScatxycle	I think I may have too much going on tho for normal epic proportions
2016-10-18 07:51:06	fScatxycle	epic orchestra often has a lot of ostinatos going on, but ostinatos generally don't serve as harmonic function. Most of my different things going on are harmonic functions which kinda clutter it up

2016-10-18 07:52:58	fScatxycle	also mural strings aren't that fantastic, but the horns I have are. The horns are doubled an octave below the strings and it makes them sound amazing

2016-10-18 11:48:21	indiechill	well i tried that but the synth in the first clip is different
2016-10-18 11:48:39	indiechill	so impossible right
2016-10-18 11:48:39	Roller	if you invert the phase they will cancel eachother out as the sine will basically upsidedown
2016-10-18 11:49:25	Roller	so the wave forms cancel eachothero ut
2016-10-18 11:49:30	Roller	but you need to be very exact
2016-10-18 11:49:36	indiechill	well lets say you have a saw and kick drum sample and the same thing just with a square and the same kick drum sample, can i extract the kick sample then
2016-10-18 11:49:42	Roller	no
2016-10-18 11:49:52	Roller	unless you do some very creative eqing

2016-10-19 04:28:33	AdmiralBumbleBee	there is an optin for that in FL
2016-10-19 04:28:34	bd-	or maybe i'm thinking of the cubase option that releases the driver when the window isn't focused
2016-10-19 04:28:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	or is there
2016-10-19 04:29:30	Kimryd	can't you just go to the sound settings > speaker properties and disable exclusive mode
2016-10-19 04:29:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	does that affect asio4all?
2016-10-19 04:30:06	Kimryd	dunno
2016-10-19 04:30:07	HorrrmonaLisa	i think there is an option
2016-10-19 04:30:10	HorrrmonaLisa	let me try
2016-10-19 04:30:35	bd-	you could try wsapi instead of asio, can get similarly low latencies on realtek shit
2016-10-19 04:30:59	HorrrmonaLisa	ah so simple
2016-10-19 04:31:22	HorrrmonaLisa	next to the audio driver i can select "auto close"

2016-10-19 05:25:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	that's what I suggested before

2016-10-19 05:25:31	adq	you pasted the link too

2016-10-19 05:27:33	wrl	fuk
2016-10-19 05:27:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	wrl: you could do it in a day
2016-10-19 05:27:37	AdmiralBumbleBee	seriously
2016-10-19 05:27:38	wrl	i could
2016-10-19 05:27:43	wrl	AdmiralBumbleBee: so here's a different idea
2016-10-19 05:27:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	go look at the shit that's won in the past
2016-10-19 05:27:53	wrl	i was thinking of building a circuit model of the 808 kickdrum for trap basslines
2016-10-19 05:27:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's fucking garbage like 50% of the ime
2016-10-19 05:28:01	wrl	there's a paper on it
2016-10-19 05:28:13	wrl	and then dropping some tasteful non-linearities in the circuit in weird places to dirty the whole thing up
2016-10-19 05:28:18	wrl	and then map the frequency across the kbd
2016-10-19 05:28:27	 *	kerrang should get back into audiodev
2016-10-19 05:28:28	wrl	straightforward and to the point
2016-10-19 05:28:32	wrl	AdmiralBumbleBee: thoughts on that one?
2016-10-19 05:28:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	wrl: do you wanna win, or you wanna make an 808 kickdrum synth?
2016-10-19 05:28:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's a great idea
2016-10-19 05:28:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	but no one will give a shit
2016-10-19 05:29:09	subsignal	get carnage to back it insta win
2016-10-19 05:29:28	wrl	subsignal: knobs labelled "STRENGTH" and "THUMP"
2016-10-19 05:29:36	subsignal	win
2016-10-19 05:29:46	wrl	AdmiralBumbleBee: my concern with yr suggestion is "the actual plug-in / application / sound library should be a new, original creation, not just an obviously cut-down subset of a program you have already written."
2016-10-19 05:29:46		[05:29]
2016-10-19 05:30:05	kerrang	but the superset program is new
2016-10-19 05:30:17	subsignal	how they gonna know haha
2016-10-19 05:30:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	wrl: you can build a new product based on your submission though...
2016-10-19 05:30:27	kerrang	so by the transitive property the submodule would be new (and original) too
2016-10-19 05:30:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	and what kerrang said
2016-10-19 05:30:36	wrl	i mean the other thing
2016-10-19 05:30:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	wrl: do you really think people are all making shit from scratch?
2016-10-19 05:30:56	kerrang	now if you release camphor/panther before and then take a module from that and enter, that would be unfair
2016-10-19 05:30:56	wrl	historically, stuff that has won has been cool little almost-utility plugs
2016-10-19 05:31:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	a bunch of them, I know for a fact, were submodules based on shit in the works
2016-10-19 05:31:18	wrl	ferrictds, thrillseekerxts or whatever
2016-10-19 05:31:44	wrl	so if i nail the 808 kick it could fit into the same spot
2016-10-19 05:31:45	subsignal	yea i think its fine since the code isnt used in production
2016-10-19 05:31:51	wrl	but yeah y'all raising a good point here
2016-10-19 05:32:11	subsignal	but Kick 2
2016-10-19 05:32:20	subsignal	isnt that already boss enough for a kick
2016-10-19 05:33:17	wrl	it could be
2016-10-19 05:33:18	wrl	hmnh.
2016-10-19 05:33:24	wrl	alright yeah i'll think about this
2016-10-19 05:34:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	how many people need an 808 kick compared to how many need an EQ or a chorus or whatever
2016-10-19 05:34:26	subsignal	yea if people cant make 808 in a synth => outta here
2016-10-19 05:34:57	subsignal	not to crush ur 808 dreams
2016-10-19 05:34:59	WarriorBob	Call it "Admiral Ackbar" and just really double down on the saturation options

2016-10-20 06:56:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	different culture though ;)
2016-10-20 06:56:18	subsignal	oh this is just a pic of the meal

2016-10-20 06:58:56	arty_knots	adq: is it possible to measure speed with google pixels focus thing?
2016-10-20 06:59:08	adq	what speed?
2016-10-20 06:59:23	adq	or which speed?
2016-10-20 06:59:44	arty_knots	of something it focuses to
2016-10-20 06:59:54	arty_knots	like a speed radar thingy
2016-10-20 06:59:55	adq	arty_knots, basic formula for measure speed is speed = distance / time
2016-10-20 07:00:21	adq	if you have distance and time, you can know the speed
2016-10-20 07:00:21		[07:00]
2016-10-20 07:00:43	adq	if you have the acceleration, you can use the derivative too i think

2016-10-20 07:01:08	adq	i have no idea for speed radar, usually they use a lazer which rebonds
2016-10-20 07:01:20	adq	and they measure the time it took to rebonds and they know its speed (speed of light)
2016-10-20 07:01:36	arty_knots	i heard pixel has laser something
2016-10-20 07:01:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	adq: too bad cameras and flashes don't use light
2016-10-20 07:01:37	adq	and with 2 quick shots, you know the speed of a car for example
2016-10-20 07:01:40	AdmiralBumbleBee	;)
2016-10-20 07:02:13	adq	lol
2016-10-20 07:02:29	arty_knots	i dont know if you can access that data in an app

2016-10-20 07:02:49	arty_knots	just some showerthoughts
2016-10-20 07:02:57	adq	i think you don't really know what is your problem, what are the solutions, what you need to solve the problem and what you can have
2016-10-20 07:03:26	adq	in all case, using a video camera won't help you much and will, in best cases, give you a bad accuracy
2016-10-20 07:03:48	arty_knots	laser focus thing
2016-10-20 07:04:11	adq	don't they use phase detection for fast auto-focus?
2016-10-20 07:04:17	arty_knots	i need to research more
2016-10-20 07:04:37	adq	even if it has a lazer, it's not like you will know when it has shot and when it cames back
2016-10-20 07:04:45	arty_knots	i heard someone say it has laser focus something
2016-10-20 07:04:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	adq: “If you look on the back, you’ll see two little holes next to the microphone,” says Knight. “One is a laser emitter, and one is a laser receiver. It sends out a cone of IR light which reflects off the subject and bounces back. It’s a time-of-flight laser, which means it uses the phase of the receive light to very accurately figure out how far away the subject is.”
2016-10-20 07:04:57	adq	and due to the short distance, the incridble speed, you need high precision (order of nanosecond probably)
2016-10-20 07:04:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	I think arty_knots may be on to something.
2016-10-20 07:05:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'm sure there will be an app for it
2016-10-20 07:05:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	eventually
2016-10-20 07:05:24	subsignal	oh wo
2016-10-20 07:05:27	adq	ah good AdmiralBumbleBee
2016-10-20 07:05:32	subsignal	thats pretty bad ass
2016-10-20 07:05:39	subsignal	wonder how far it can go
2016-10-20 07:05:46	adq	but still, i'm pretty sure he will never get accurate timing
2016-10-20 07:05:48	arty_knots	no idea
2016-10-20 07:06:04	adq	and you need at least 2 shot
2016-10-20 07:06:07	adq	not one ;)
2016-10-20 07:06:17	arty_knots	what if you take multiple
2016-10-20 07:07:02	adq	you still believe you will have very precise timestamp for before the shot and after the shot, and you won't
2016-10-20 07:07:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	subsignal: foh, you're not allowed to say anything about the pixel is good
2016-10-20 07:07:50	adq	it's interesting anyway arty_knots
2016-10-20 07:08:16	arty_knots	pixel is also said to have a very short delay between pressing the shutter and actually taking the shot
2016-10-20 07:08:29	arty_knots	but again, just showerthoughts
2016-10-20 07:08:31	adq	yes, and the delay is short because nothing is exposed i believe, no overhead ;)
2016-10-20 07:08:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	arty_knots: that's not saying much... all cameras do :P
2016-10-20 07:08:45	subsignal	haha

2016-10-20 11:39:53	_Hex_	to play devil's advocate.. i think it is very well mixed..it's just improvements have been made in terms of sonics..much more high/low extension and capabilities
2016-10-20 11:39:59	_Hex_	but it was certainly very well balanced

2016-10-20 11:41:15	jnav	Beatles stereo mixes are garbage
2016-10-20 11:41:27	fqtw	i thought about inferring routing by sending sine pulses, when the user presses a "infer routing" button (when the song isnt playing)
2016-10-20 11:41:49	fqtw	so each isntance sends a sine pulse at a unique freq
2016-10-20 11:42:01	fqtw	and other instances recognize them from the input

2016-10-20 12:11:19	fqtw	lets say there are two tracks, going into the master. after the instances know the routing, the "master instance" creates two buffers for the two other instances to write to. when the host calls process(), it will call it on the two instances on the two tracks first. they write their output to the two internally shared buffers. then the master instance's process() is called. it sums the two buffers and outputs that
2016-10-20 12:11:36	fqtw	similarly for busses between tracks and master
2016-10-20 12:11:53	fqtw	assuming the host calls them in the order of signal flow

2016-10-20 14:48:14	wrl	so it gives width because of that
2016-10-20 14:48:15	Estr	wrl, watch the thing I linked
2016-10-20 14:48:18	Estr	PersonaSound, watch the thing I linked
2016-10-20 14:48:25	PersonaSound	so there stereo comes from basically the recording
2016-10-20 14:48:28	PersonaSound	the*
2016-10-20 14:48:32	wrl	checking
2016-10-20 14:48:39	wrl	PersonaSound: well, it comes from panning two recordings that are different
2016-10-20 14:48:47	Ycros	PersonaSound: yep, inconsistencies between two takes
2016-10-20 14:48:49	wrl	so you can get the same effect by doing roughly the same things with a synth
2016-10-20 14:48:54	wrl	right, you can emulate that
2016-10-20 14:48:55	wrl	think about it...
2016-10-20 14:49:00	wrl	two guitar parts, what's going to differ?
2016-10-20 14:49:00	PersonaSound	inderadsting
2016-10-20 14:49:11	wrl	the timing, mostly, the dynamics of the notes, and hence the timbre
2016-10-20 14:49:26	wrl	so you can do the same sort of thing
2016-10-20 14:49:38	wrl	take a sequencer channel and the corresponding synth and effect chain, and just clone it
2016-10-20 14:49:39	PersonaSound	i think i have an idea of what you mean
2016-10-20 14:49:42	Ycros	you'll also get similar same results out of slightly drifty analogish synths. Or you can explicitly tweak your synth params to enhance the effect
2016-10-20 14:49:45	kerrang	stereo is hard for me to follow
2016-10-20 14:49:47	wrl	then make the two sequences and make them different
2016-10-20 14:49:52	adq	you have to talk in PersonaSound language
2016-10-20 14:50:00	wrl	you can use the "humanise" function to add randomness to the timing of the notes
2016-10-20 14:50:02	kerrang	sways
2016-10-20 14:50:06	Estr	reese
2016-10-20 14:50:10	Estr	secret of the reese

2016-10-20 14:50:12	adq	PersonaSound, you make one reese, you put it on left, you make another reese slightly different, you put in on right channel
2016-10-20 14:50:14	adq	profit
2016-10-20 14:50:15	wrl	yeah
2016-10-20 14:50:17	wrl	easy
2016-10-20 14:50:17	wrl	done
2016-10-20 14:50:22	PersonaSound	thanks adq
2016-10-20 14:50:24	Estr	LOL
2016-10-20 14:50:25	adq	:')
2016-10-20 14:50:32	PersonaSound	i actually fully now understood what wrl was saying
2016-10-20 14:50:38	wrl	cool
2016-10-20 14:50:43	wrl	so that's a fun way of doing stereo things
2016-10-20 14:51:03	wrl	also the trick of doubling and panning hard r/l goes back basically to the advent of stereo recording
2016-10-20 14:51:09	wrl	we're talking more than half a century here
2016-10-20 14:51:13	wrl	so it's not particularly novel
2016-10-20 14:51:25	wrl	but once you start listening for it you'll hear it everywhere
2016-10-20 14:51:27	PersonaSound	so i think ill have 3 copies of a bass, 2 panned and 1 of the original recording but lowpassed as a sub
2016-10-20 14:51:38	PersonaSound	original patch*
2016-10-20 14:51:47	wrl	yeah you could do that
2016-10-20 14:51:50	wrl	i do that type of shit
2016-10-20 14:51:51	adq	they knew phase cancellation before electricity i believe, in cathedral and other sacred temple where the acoustic matter(ed)
2016-10-20 14:52:00	Ycros	I don't mind hard panned solo things, though given that most people today listen to music via 'phones, I can see why it's not as popular
2016-10-20 14:52:10	wrl	yeah agreed
2016-10-20 14:52:28	wrl	i've been meaning to do like
2016-10-20 14:52:45	Ycros	but hey, if you want to do that, its your stylistic choice
2016-10-20 14:52:53	Estr	no it should be illegal
2016-10-20 14:53:05	kerrang	i was gonna say, hard panning is good in all but it's not helpful for mono-compatability
2016-10-20 14:53:09	wrl	a "corkscrew thing" where i have an ascending melody line and a descending melody line and they kinda "swirl" around the stereo space
2016-10-20 14:53:12	adq	i do the contrary, i let it go wild, then cutoff below like a range from 300 to 700 (mileage varies), and put anything under mono
2016-10-20 14:53:23	kerrang	but then you could just have a centered, third element that's eq'ed well to fit in the mix
2016-10-20 14:53:32	wrl	kerrang: yes!
2016-10-20 14:53:51	PersonaSound	i keep mono compatability when i make my basses
2016-10-20 14:53:53	kerrang	man, i forget to do laying this way
2016-10-20 14:54:06	kerrang	i had gotten into it a while ago, but just kinda stopped
2016-10-20 14:54:10	PersonaSound	the sub is mono but i'm concered about phase issues in the mids and highs
2016-10-20 14:54:11	adq	i put a stereo imager to keep mono compat on _all_ tracks
2016-10-20 14:54:19	wrl	PersonaSound: then just listen in mono to make sure
2016-10-20 14:54:22	adq	and filter almost always before signal enter reverb in same way too
2016-10-20 14:54:27	PersonaSound	i do lol
2016-10-20 14:54:28	Ycros	in some ways, fuck mono compatability :P
2016-10-20 14:54:32	kerrang	^
2016-10-20 14:54:33	kerrang	that too
2016-10-20 14:54:38	Ycros	it's another choice
2016-10-20 14:54:41	adq	ahah yeah
2016-10-20 14:54:42	wrl	yeah agreed
2016-10-20 14:54:45	wrl	Ycros is right
2016-10-20 14:54:48	adq	with headphones it's always crazy
2016-10-20 14:54:50	wrl	i've wanted to do like
2016-10-20 14:54:51	kerrang	mono copmat is really more for if you're making club bangers
2016-10-20 14:54:57	wrl	out of phase hard-panned basses before tbh
2016-10-20 14:54:57	Ycros	just consider what you're making music for, who you're making it for
2016-10-20 14:55:01	kerrang	w/e that means
2016-10-20 14:55:08	PersonaSound	i know, i want my music to be club music
2016-10-20 14:55:11	wrl	like that could be really cool
2016-10-20 14:55:28	wrl	distorted sines, panned hard r/l, one tuned up +10c, one down -10c

2016-10-20 14:57:02	wrl	and this mexican dude who was renting me the sub was like "yeah he wanted the subs in the back run phase reversed. you know, 180 degrees n' shit. dude it was nuts. fools was gettin sucked *up*!"

2016-10-21 09:14:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	:P
2016-10-21 09:15:20	prim3r	im always in anxiety mode, my heart rate is always high
2016-10-21 09:15:21	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's co-morbid to the pure autonomic failure I have, which causes irregular vagal response (leading to panic attacks)
2016-10-21 09:15:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	ah, well
2016-10-21 09:15:30	AdmiralBumbleBee	my HR is very low
2016-10-21 09:15:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	and bp
2016-10-21 09:15:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	so I got that going for me... I guess?
2016-10-21 09:16:03	prim3r	vagal is the vagus nerve?
2016-10-21 09:16:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	basically, yes
2016-10-21 09:16:37	prim3r	I have heart palpitations every day, im thinking its because of the vagus nerve ive read about
2016-10-21 09:16:47	prim3r	but the doctors i've talked to dismiss it
2016-10-21 09:17:05	AdmiralBumbleBee	well it probably is because of vagal interaction, but that doesn't mean much
2016-10-21 09:17:15	AdmiralBumbleBee	that's like saying "I choked yesterday, I think it's because I have a throat"
2016-10-21 09:17:43	prim3r	I think my stomach touches it something
2016-10-21 09:17:52	prim3r	I dont know

2016-10-21 09:17:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	esophagus
2016-10-21 09:18:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	there's significant autonomic branching in the esophagus
2016-10-21 09:18:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	as well as considering that your enteric nervous system is extermely important to vascular and cardiac response
2016-10-21 09:19:18	prim3r	there are days I barely move from my place, my heart must be weakened somehow
2016-10-21 09:20:11	prim3r	I did many ecg's and an ultrasound, they dont find anything wrong with it per say
2016-10-21 09:20:17	prim3r	except for a right axial deviation
2016-10-21 09:20:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	which is pretty common
2016-10-21 09:21:15	prim3r	i do believe all my problems are anxiety relates, at intense levels
2016-10-21 09:22:08	prim3r	I did find something that stops me having elevated panic episodes, it might be coincidence
2016-10-21 09:22:17	prim3r	st john's wort tea
2016-10-21 09:22:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	well that shit definitely does stuff.
2016-10-21 09:22:32	prim3r	I find if I dont consume it for about 1.5-2weeks I'll have elevated anxiety
2016-10-21 09:22:38	AdmiralBumbleBee	and you have to be very careful with it
2016-10-21 09:22:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	it interacts with a number of medications
2016-10-21 09:22:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	specifically certain anti-depressants
2016-10-21 09:22:53	prim3r	I dont take any meds, but it does give me migranes sometimes

2016-10-21 09:59:05	_Hex_	where does it access those streaming channels?
2016-10-21 09:59:07	prim3r	they slowed down the production of these brand name boxes, a while ago nexus player, shield, fire stick all boomed

2016-10-21 10:01:27	_Hex_	so you just install the apk?
2016-10-21 10:01:28	adq	i think you have to suscribe to streaming services, they won't offer you netflix

2016-10-21 10:04:03	adq	but it can be very convinient on regular android

2016-10-21 17:07:21	kerrang	Kimryd: ok maybe it's bitwigs the one i have a problem with. i said both becuase i know they use the same library for time-stretching algos
2016-10-21 17:08:15	Kimryd	Live has more types though
2016-10-21 17:08:47	Kimryd	And tbh, I kind of like Bitwig's, it certainly isn't shit to my ears and when you use extreme pitch values with extreme stretching, you can get really neat stuff
2016-10-21 17:09:08	Kimryd	I love granular modes like bitwig's because you can get nice rhythms by accident

2016-10-21 18:51:25	Kimryd	caps
2016-10-21 18:52:16	sourhello	Hey Kimryd thanks for being here today. Just let me start by asking, where do you get your ideas from?
2016-10-21 18:52:31	Kimryd	Can you be more specific?
2016-10-21 18:52:36	Kimryd	What ideas for what
2016-10-21 18:53:50	sourhello	What do YOU think is good music? Who are some of your inspirations? What can we expect from you in the future?
2016-10-21 18:54:10	Kimryd	Well
2016-10-21 18:54:31	Kimryd	My inspirations are the IDM and Breakcore guys. Aphex Twin, Autechre, Boards of Canada, Venetian snares
2016-10-21 18:54:46	Kimryd	I never really hear anything and then go "oh shit this has me inspired"
2016-10-21 18:55:03	Kimryd	The only time I've done that is when I realized that the majick resolution for snare rolls is 64th notes
2016-10-21 18:55:11	Kimryd	(that was a glorious discovery)
2016-10-21 18:55:24	Kimryd	I don't know what you can expect other than more Kimcore
2016-10-21 18:57:56	sourhello	Well hot damn, I love me some BOC
2016-10-21 18:58:13	sourhello	but I like them for their.... less IDM stuff I guess?
2016-10-21 18:58:19	sourhello	as odd as that sounds
2016-10-21 18:58:38	Kimryd	Nah I think I feel
2016-10-21 18:58:49	Kimryd	BoC are lesss IDMey than, say, Autechre, who are, like
2016-10-21 18:58:51	Kimryd	IDM af
2016-10-21 18:59:22	sourhello	Yeah definitely, I don't even know what to call most of BOCs stuff
2016-10-21 19:00:05	Kimryd	I just call em IDM and am done with it

2016-10-21 19:00:29	sourhello	i have no clue but it brings a tear to me eye
2016-10-21 19:00:52	prim3r	I havent listened to boc in years

2016-10-21 19:11:55	sourhello	man the lead in that reminds me of a freeware synth from awhile ago, cant remember its name
2016-10-21 19:12:14	sourhello	it was meant for ambient sounds but you could tune it into leads and shit
2016-10-21 19:13:03	Kimryd	I wouldn't know, I use pretty much no free stuff

2016-10-21 19:23:15	sourhello	one of my favorite things to do is use some shitty old freeware plug for every synth part in a song
2016-10-21 19:23:37	sourhello	and see if I can "un-shittify" it :D

2016-10-21 19:29:41	Kimryd	I don't want to spend the money just to not make good, or full use of my stuff

2016-10-21 22:48:48	Kiicki	I kinda have a question about CPU's for music production. I kinda want to get into gaming so I want to build a gaming PC. I want a budget PC though and usually a i3 or i5 is usually good enough, but how do they hold up to Fl studio? I don't want the project to studder
2016-10-21 22:49:07	Kiicki	I mean, if people can use Macbook pro's, I guess it should be fine right?

2016-10-21 22:49:36	XMPPwocky	i3 vs i5 vs i7 isn't that significant
2016-10-21 22:50:11	XMPPwocky	there's all sorts of things those could refer to. Different generations, different numbers of cores, cache sizes, clock speeds...
2016-10-21 22:50:26	XMPPwocky	maybe  you'll have a fast CPU but get throttled by the BIOS or CPU microcode when you use it for over 20 seconds
2016-10-21 22:53:58	Kiicki	For example the i5 4460. That's a popular CPU for gaming. Would it be also good for Fl studio?

2016-10-22 07:48:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	more portable

2016-10-22 07:51:30	Kimryd	And it'll perform better than if reading of my hdd?

2016-10-22 08:37:23	Shad0w	my folks named me after the patron saint of my country
2016-10-22 08:37:28	Shad0w	so it could be worse
2016-10-22 08:37:37	AdmiralBumbleBee	Shad0w: nothing is worse than patriotism and religion mixed
2016-10-22 08:37:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	nationalism*
2016-10-22 08:37:48	adq	you have to choose an ethnie first, do you want a black guetto french name, an oldschool ghetto french name, a muslim ghetto french name, etc?

2016-10-22 08:39:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	what is ghetto about it?
2016-10-22 08:39:26	adq	a raoul can be a very deprecated guy, watching tv and drinking a beer with his shirt a bit up so you can see his belly
2016-10-22 08:39:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	best I can see is that it's a relatively common spanish name
2016-10-22 08:39:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	which explains why so many cubans are named 'raul'
2016-10-22 08:39:58	adq	i don't have stats of name across time, but i'm sure it's rarely used here anymore
2016-10-22 08:40:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	pronounced the same
2016-10-22 08:40:16	adq	yep probably

2016-10-22 14:54:15	CultLeader	honestly if you need something like this, try Ableton
2016-10-22 14:54:21	AdmiralBumbleBee	I have ableton
2016-10-22 14:54:22	CultLeader	everything you're trying just works there.
2016-10-22 14:54:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	it drives me bonkers
2016-10-22 14:54:29	CultLeader	lol why
2016-10-22 14:54:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	ptsd mostly.
2016-10-22 14:54:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	from using it heavily in v6/7 when it was absolute dogshit
2016-10-22 14:55:03	CultLeader	from not knowing what you were doing when you first got started with it?
2016-10-22 14:55:05	CultLeader	yea
2016-10-22 14:55:12	CultLeader	its fine now, mostly
2016-10-22 14:55:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	and it still has the monitor ADC shit
2016-10-22 14:55:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	where if you monitor a track, it's not delay compensated
2016-10-22 14:55:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's offset by the buffer value
2016-10-22 14:55:28	CultLeader	u mean pdc
2016-10-22 14:55:30	AdmiralBumbleBee	no
2016-10-22 14:55:34	AdmiralBumbleBee	I mean ADC, no plugins involved
2016-10-22 14:55:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	if you record audio while monitoring, it's offset by the buffer value
2016-10-22 14:55:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	if you record with NO monitoring, it's compensated
2016-10-22 14:55:59	CultLeader	what?
2016-10-22 14:56:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	if you change buffer sizes, the offset changes
2016-10-22 14:56:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	this is intended behaviour in v9
2016-10-22 14:56:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	I've confirmed it with ableton on the beta forums
2016-10-22 14:56:16	CultLeader	yeah i dont see the problem
2016-10-22 14:56:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	that is HOW THEY WANT IT TO WORK
2016-10-22 14:56:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	the problem is I start my tracks with drums and usually I can get away with 32samples
2016-10-22 14:56:45	CultLeader	what is the difference between "it's offset by the buffer value" and "it's compensated?"
2016-10-22 14:56:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	CultLeader: when monitoring, the track will be late by the buffer value
2016-10-22 14:57:10	CultLeader	yes, unless you do direct monitoring
2016-10-22 14:57:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	CultLeader: when you have monitoring off, ableton shifts it back to compensate instead.
2016-10-22 14:57:28	CultLeader	sounds like a good idea to me
2016-10-22 14:57:34	AdmiralBumbleBee	NO OTHER DAW does it like that.
2016-10-22 14:57:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	none. at all.
2016-10-22 14:57:39	CultLeader	the name of the program is called "Ableton LIVE"
2016-10-22 14:57:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	all of them always compensate
2016-10-22 14:57:44	CultLeader	not "Ableton STUDIO"
2016-10-22 14:57:55	CultLeader	this is intentional behavior for doing live loops and overdubs
2016-10-22 14:58:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'm aware
2016-10-22 14:58:06	CultLeader	and needing to hear and record at same time
2016-10-22 14:58:15	CultLeader	thus, its a proper design decision
2016-10-22 14:58:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	however, it sucks for me.
2016-10-22 14:58:26	kerrang	but no one would change buffers live, so why not compensate?
2016-10-22 14:58:35	CultLeader	ofc they might
2016-10-22 14:58:43	CultLeader	esp if they start overloading and getting clicks
2016-10-22 14:58:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	if you do shit in logic, stuff always lines up with what you hear
2016-10-22 14:58:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	if you play exactly when you hear something
2016-10-22 14:58:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's recorded that way
2016-10-22 14:59:02	CultLeader	nah
2016-10-22 14:59:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	in ableton, it's offset by a buffer if you have monitoring on
2016-10-22 14:59:09	CultLeader	oh you mean, its shifted left
2016-10-22 14:59:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	if monitoring is OFF, it works like logic for instance

2016-10-22 15:00:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	CultLeader: no
2016-10-22 15:00:56	CultLeader	robotika, because digital paradigm needs buffers

2016-10-22 15:04:05	CultLeader	When playing back my audio recording, the timing is suddenly off.
2016-10-22 15:04:05	CultLeader	If you record audio in a track whose Monitoring is set to "Off", Live will move back the recorded audio a value of time corresponding to the overall latency. This setting makes sense if you are monitoring the signals via an audio mixer or via your audio interface's direct out.  However, when recording while monitoring the signals via Live itself, you should make sure that monitoring is
2016-10-22 15:04:05	CultLeader	set to either "In" or "Auto".

2016-10-22 15:17:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	Kimryd: can you split all those clips at once though?
2016-10-22 15:17:52	Kimryd	yes I just tried
2016-10-22 15:18:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	at just 1 place?
2016-10-22 15:18:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	not begin end of the selction
2016-10-22 15:18:29	Kimryd	yeah, I selected a random amount of time, ctrl + e, all 4 clips were split
2016-10-22 15:18:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	wtf
2016-10-22 15:18:42	Kimryd	its just extremely  finnickity about where it wants you to highlight the clios
2016-10-22 15:18:48	Kimryd	clips
2016-10-22 15:19:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	ohhh
2016-10-22 15:19:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	you have to click  and drag over everything
2016-10-22 15:19:24	Kimryd	tbh I never do edit multiple audio clips at a time :{ I don't think bitwig is really geared towards thaat
2016-10-22 15:19:25	Kimryd	Yeah
2016-10-22 15:19:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	you can't just set the seleciton
2016-10-22 15:19:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	ok that's confusing as shit
2016-10-22 15:19:37	Kimryd	Yes, it is indeed lol
2016-10-22 15:19:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	I think I'm sitting here with only these clips selected in this view
2016-10-22 15:19:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	so anything I do will be on the shit I already selected once
2016-10-22 15:20:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	however...
2016-10-22 15:20:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	it snaps to warp markers too, so that's very helpful
2016-10-22 15:20:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	and they appear to be placed slightly better than live's

2016-10-22 15:22:38	Kimryd	If you want to measure distance, I have not found any tooltip or whatever that says "your selection is x bars"
2016-10-22 15:23:00	Kimryd	you can set it to loop your selection, then ctrl + shift + b, click "loop region"
2016-10-22 15:23:03	Kimryd	there it will tell you
2016-10-22 15:23:07	Kimryd	Otherwise, I do not know

2016-10-22 15:23:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	thanks
2016-10-22 15:23:20	Kimryd	shortcut for loop is ctrl + L
2016-10-22 15:23:26	Kimryd	all the ableton live shortcuts work in bitwig
2016-10-22 15:23:59	AdmiralBumbleBee	sends work rather interesting
2016-10-22 15:24:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	strange, but interesting
2016-10-22 15:24:20	Kimryd	How so?
2016-10-22 15:24:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	the way you send shit to a send?
2016-10-22 15:24:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	at laest from the send editor page
2016-10-22 15:25:14	Kimryd	You're using the inspector?
2016-10-22 15:26:10	Kimryd	You can use the "mix" view for stuff like that, its very flexible
2016-10-22 15:26:39	kerrang	i completely forgot you can use sends in the inspector
2016-10-22 15:26:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	I was using the device editor for the send
2016-10-22 15:26:51	Kimryd	http://puu.sh/rSiwL/13c2d69921.png
2016-10-22 15:26:56	kerrang	plus it looks like it lets you select pre or post there (can't do that in the device editor)
2016-10-22 15:27:02	Kimryd	hit tab for the mix view, the circled icons open / close controls
2016-10-22 15:28:00	Kimryd	Oh and if you group stuff, you can only open / close the group by clicking on the folder icon

2016-10-22 15:28:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	shagia: yes
2016-10-22 15:28:35	Kimryd	I just send via the mix view
2016-10-22 15:28:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	Kimryd: it's pretty cool actually
2016-10-22 15:28:41	shagia	OH YES
2016-10-22 15:29:23	Kimryd	u geetting turned on shagia ?
2016-10-22 15:29:29	Kimryd	I know bitwig is sexy, but come on now
2016-10-22 15:29:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	hmm
2016-10-22 15:29:31	shagia	............maybe
2016-10-22 15:29:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	so can you re-categorize plugins?
2016-10-22 15:29:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	cause I have shit in 'unknown' that is not unknown
2016-10-22 15:30:21	AdmiralBumbleBee	dragging doesn't do shit
2016-10-22 15:30:38	Kimryd	You can change the filters, or create a customer "collection" folder for your plugins via right click
2016-10-22 15:30:42	Kimryd	That's what you meant?
2016-10-22 15:30:48	AdmiralBumbleBee	I guess?
2016-10-22 15:30:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	like pro-q2 is listed as 'unknown'
2016-10-22 15:30:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	not in EQ/filter
2016-10-22 15:31:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	so I have to make all my own categories for everything?
2016-10-22 15:31:27	Kimryd	ooh, I don't think that's something you can change. I personally just type in "pro" and it shows me err'thang in the browser
2016-10-22 15:31:33	Kimryd	btw the shortcut for the browser is b
2016-10-22 15:31:37	shagia	probably just for the unknown stuff, I thought metadata editing worked though
2016-10-22 15:31:52	Kimryd	I've never bothered so I just don't know
2016-10-22 15:31:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	where do you edit the metadata?
2016-10-22 15:32:04	Kimryd	I also don't know what is "smart" about the smart collections
2016-10-22 15:32:35	Kimryd	yeah I can't see to find any metadata editor
2016-10-22 15:32:52	shagia	oh im actually trying now and it only applies to stock stuff it looks like
2016-10-22 15:32:54	shagia	nvm lol
2016-10-22 15:33:38	shagia	yeah you just open the browser and right click but it looks like only the stock stuff shows the option to edit metadata, guess it's for something completely different
2016-10-22 15:33:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	hmm
2016-10-22 15:34:22	Kimryd	I don't know where it gets its info for the grouping to  begin with
2016-10-22 15:34:36	kerrang	so i think that's done by collections
2016-10-22 15:34:42	CultLeader	need an html based DAW
2016-10-22 15:34:49	CultLeader	so you can do all your custom layouts n shit
2016-10-22 15:34:49	shagia	i thought VSTs usually ship with metadata about them
2016-10-22 15:34:57	kerrang	but i'm trying to see if you can organize it yourself
2016-10-22 15:34:57	shagia	which is why DAWs like FL and Bitwig toss them in collections
2016-10-22 15:35:06	kerrang	shagia: yeah but not all plugins implement them
2016-10-22 15:35:10	shagia	ahh

2016-10-23 04:53:12	CultLeader	or making a tune
2016-10-23 04:53:19	CultLeader	i got an idea for a synth yesterday
2016-10-23 04:54:10	Kimryd	can you imagine the out of the box thinking required to come up with the concept of a new synthesis method? Like how did the guy who came up with PD even figure that out..
2016-10-23 04:54:52	kerrang	pure data?
2016-10-23 04:54:59	Nahck	i dont dev synths or make tunes
2016-10-23 04:55:02	kerrang	dafaq you talking about
2016-10-23 04:55:08	Kimryd	Phase distortion
2016-10-23 04:55:46	Kimryd	I was going to use wavetables as an example, but they aren't very outlandish in terms of concepts I guess
2016-10-23 04:56:09	CultLeader	no, wavetables are actually basic digital synthesis
2016-10-23 04:57:01	Kimryd	Yeah that's why  I just mentioned that they aren't very outlandish
2016-10-23 04:57:11	kerrang	oh phase distortion is a form of sythesis
2016-10-23 04:57:34	Kimryd	I don't understand it really, I just know I can make nice pads and stabs with it
2016-10-23 04:58:00	kerrang	man i'd love to try some more synthesisers that aren't fm or subtractive
2016-10-23 04:58:00		[04:58]

2016-10-23 05:00:18	wrl	CultLeader: what's your idea for a synth
2016-10-23 05:01:23	CultLeader	phase distortion is not a synthesis method, though.
2016-10-23 05:01:25	CultLeader	Kimryd
2016-10-23 05:01:36	CultLeader	wrl - you gonna steal it if I tell you?
2016-10-23 05:01:47	wrl	CultLeader: probably not
2016-10-23 05:01:52	wrl	also phase distortion is a synthesis method
2016-10-23 05:02:26	Kimryd	y ping me
2016-10-23 05:02:44	wrl	moreso than in a lot of things, audio algorithm ideas are fun but the devil is in making them work
2016-10-23 05:02:46	kerrang	huh pd is kinda coo
2016-10-23 05:02:51	kerrang	cool
2016-10-23 05:02:56	wrl	kerrang: it's what camphor uses
2016-10-23 05:02:59	CultLeader	how is phase distortion a synthesis method?
2016-10-23 05:03:09	CultLeader	its an effect
2016-10-23 05:03:21	kerrang	wrl: wait, for like everything?
2016-10-23 05:03:25	wrl	CultLeader: traditionally, you take a cosine wave and "bend" the trough toward the beginning or the end of the cycle
2016-10-23 05:03:38	wrl	CultLeader: so e.g. you turn a sine into a rising or falling sawtooth
2016-10-23 05:03:43	wrl	kerrang: for the oscillators  yeah
2016-10-23 05:03:47	CultLeader	thats waveshaping
2016-10-23 05:03:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	I think I could agree with CultLeader...
2016-10-23 05:04:02	CultLeader	also, what you just said, has no inherent phase distortion
2016-10-23 05:04:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	since with PD, you have to start with a synthesized waveform then yo modify it
2016-10-23 05:04:06	CultLeader	unless you change the period
2016-10-23 05:04:15	CultLeader	but if you change the period, you're just changing the frequency
2016-10-23 05:04:19	wrl	CultLeader: no, waveshaping is when you take the actual wave output and run it through a transfer function
2016-10-23 05:04:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	but it's a pretty silly difference to poke at
2016-10-23 05:04:26	CultLeader	so it falls under algorithmic waveshaping
2016-10-23 05:04:32	kerrang	wrl: man release camphor already so i can throw money at you
2016-10-23 05:04:41	CultLeader	wrl, "bending the trough" is a transfer function
2016-10-23 05:04:43	wrl	PD is a transfer function on the oscillator phase
2016-10-23 05:04:44	wrl	well yes
2016-10-23 05:04:46	kerrang	i get excited when the details are talked about for that thing
2016-10-23 05:04:49	wrl	but not a transfer function on the wave
2016-10-23 05:04:51	CultLeader	i win
2016-10-23 05:05:01	wrl	ok let's call it phaseshaping then
2016-10-23 05:05:04	wrl	not waveshaping
2016-10-23 05:05:22	CultLeader	are you saying you change the phase within the period?
2016-10-23 05:05:25	wrl	yes
2016-10-23 05:05:31	wrl	it's a transfer function on the phase
2016-10-23 05:05:35	kerrang	#PhaseShaping #NextStepInSynthesis
2016-10-23 05:05:50	CultLeader	That sounds inaudible
2016-10-23 05:05:59	CultLeader	nobody hears phase differences at audio levels
2016-10-23 05:06:20	wrl	well ok first of all
2016-10-23 05:06:44	wrl	when you shape the phase enough to change the waveshape, it's *very* audible
2016-10-23 05:07:02	kerrang	deja vu
2016-10-23 05:07:04	CultLeader	On normal music or speech signals phase distortion appears not to be generally [emphasis by the authors] audible
2016-10-23 05:07:17	CultLeader	wrl then you're just waveshaping
2016-10-23 05:07:21	CultLeader	theres no actual difference
2016-10-23 05:07:27	CultLeader	until you start self-cancellation
2016-10-23 05:07:38	CultLeader	and then proceed thru that to 3rd harminic
2016-10-23 05:07:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	CultLeader: you're confusing phase distortion synthesis, and distortion of phase
2016-10-23 05:07:45	CultLeader	but then you're waveshaping
2016-10-23 05:07:59	wrl	well, i'm not waveshaping, because i'm not applying any shaping function on the output wave
2016-10-23 05:08:05	CultLeader	AdmiralBumbleBee no, phase distortion in a *mix* is quite audible
2016-10-23 05:08:16	CultLeader	but that's not occurring at acoustic levels
2016-10-23 05:08:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	that has nothing to do with what I just said...
2016-10-23 05:08:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	wrl: good luck
2016-10-23 05:08:21	CultLeader	its LFO levels.
2016-10-23 05:08:33	wrl	i'm applying it on the oscillator phase (which goes from 0.0 to 1.0) before looking up the relevant sample in the wavetable
2016-10-23 05:08:41	CultLeader	wrl - input is cosine?
2016-10-23 05:08:47	CultLeader	output is distorted cosine?
2016-10-23 05:08:52	wrl	CultLeader: input is a phase accumulator which goes from 0.0 to 1.0
2016-10-23 05:09:00	wrl	output is also a phase from 0.0 to 1.0
2016-10-23 05:09:07	wrl	used as an input to a cosine wavetable lookup
2016-10-23 05:09:08	CultLeader	thats just phase modulation!
2016-10-23 05:09:11	CultLeader	LOL
2016-10-23 05:09:21	CultLeader	thats how all the early Yamahas do FM synthesis

2016-10-23 05:09:33	wrl	no, phase modulation is when you *add* to the phase, not use a transfer function
2016-10-23 05:09:35	CultLeader	they just modify the phase integral on their way to the wavetable
2016-10-23 05:10:01	CultLeader	so if I add to the phase on half the cycle, then dont add anything for the other half
2016-10-23 05:10:12	CultLeader	you still consider that not to be a transfer function :D
2016-10-23 05:10:27	CultLeader	I consider this a disunity of our terms, personally :)
2016-10-23 05:10:36	wrl	name me one phase modulation synth that implements PM like that
2016-10-23 05:10:51	wrl	besides the one i'm writing
2016-10-23 05:11:38	wrl	i mean yeah there are differences in terminology here, and there's a lot of overlap in these terms, but the industry and community have generally decided on what these terms mean
2016-10-23 05:12:03	wrl	"phase distortion synthesis" makes sense from a terminology perspective but it's also "just what the casio CZ synths did"

2016-10-23 05:24:23	CultLeader	I accept your commentary, wrl, and read your page.  I guess I just have a much wider view of what constitutes FM and PM synthesis.  In my world, I can feed any signal any other signal, modulate them, and come out with an FM-synthesized sound.  This includes "phase distortions" as diagrammed, because anything can be fed to the phase integral.
2016-10-23 05:27:15	wrl	CultLeader: yeah i agree with that. your view isn't wrong, but the pushback you got from me is just a misalignment of terms
2016-10-23 05:27:53	CultLeader	yup

2016-10-23 05:29:08	wrl	when the phase "slips [...] every few seconds" it won't be audible, sure
2016-10-23 05:29:17	wrl	but in PD synthesis it's basically slipping every sample
2016-10-23 05:29:20	CultLeader	yeah to me, thats when I define it more as an LFO

2016-10-23 07:40:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	fairly sure that's solved in vst3
2016-10-23 07:40:37	AdmiralBumbleBee	and I know it's not an issue in aax
2016-10-23 07:40:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	fairly sure au sends actual values too?
2016-10-23 07:41:25	kerrang	i'll do a quick search on that, if that's the case i'd rather not store my parameters as normalized floats
2016-10-23 07:41:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	I know that's one of the perks of vst3 and aax
2016-10-23 07:41:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'd have to check au
2016-10-23 07:42:09	kerrang	i was initially planning to do a param abstraction that does the noramlization itself, but hten i'd need 3 more arguments just to create a parameter
2016-10-23 07:42:19	kerrang	shitty dev experience right there
2016-10-23 07:43:45	adq	i have no idea about vst in particular for knob range, but at some point i have to deal with that and ended up to make any knob ranging from 0 to 1 with double precision
2016-10-23 07:44:00	adq	and few mapping functions to make it range from any min to any max
2016-10-23 07:44:14	adq	including a logmapping function too in case i don't want linear (for volume or frequency for example)
2016-10-23 07:44:22	adq	and now it's not a problem anymore

2016-10-23 07:44:47	wrl	other plugin formats are more flexible
2016-10-23 07:46:33	adq	also a stepped mapping function
2016-10-23 07:46:40	kerrang	yeah, i'd rather have the noramlization be constrained to the vst_wrapper rather than the parameter then. just gotta think how i'd do this
2016-10-23 07:46:55	adq	just follow the spec if any, but stay flexible
2016-10-23 07:47:10	adq	hardcoding min & max sounds terrible
2016-10-23 07:47:27	kerrang	there isn't any afaik, i had always just based it on my work with juce
2016-10-23 07:47:30	adq	my next step was to precompute a lookup table to avoid computation costs when moving the knob (which is ridiculous but still something)
2016-10-23 07:47:33	adq	and it's still in the TODO
2016-10-23 07:48:01	adq	also think of if someday you want to automate param
2016-10-23 07:48:11	adq	what will you automate

2016-10-23 07:51:23	kerrang	but actually that reminds me i need to think of the type of parameter value being worked with, just been dancing around floats for the time being
2016-10-23 07:51:50	adq	indeed i am
2016-10-23 07:53:39	adq	in some vst doc from steinberg, it starts very early with:
2016-10-23 07:53:41	adq	" This value like all VST parameters is declared as
2016-10-23 07:53:41	adq	a float with a inclusive range of 0.0 to 1.0."
2016-10-23 07:54:13	adq	Parameter values are limited to the range 0.0 to 1.0

2016-10-23 07:55:46	adq	host, are 32 bit floating-point numbers. They must always range from 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive,
2016-10-23 07:55:46	adq	regardless of their internal or external representation.

2016-10-23 07:59:41	adq	that's cool
2016-10-23 07:59:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	then you onyl have to build the scalar in to your algo

2016-10-23 08:03:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	leave parameter as float

2016-10-23 08:03:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	you'll still be left with shit you have to scale each process cycle, but you can reduce it drastically
2016-10-23 08:04:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	and usually you can macro that shit
2016-10-23 08:04:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	so the code is still easy to read

2016-10-23 08:25:40	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: it's just an option
2016-10-23 08:25:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	but yes
2016-10-23 08:26:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	to me, it's usually easier to grok what's going on in most algos anyway
2016-10-23 08:26:28	AdmiralBumbleBee	since trigonometric functions ARE scalars (percentages) anyway
2016-10-23 08:26:38	AdmiralBumbleBee	and they fit nicely in to a floating point box
2016-10-23 08:27:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	so most of the time what's actually happening is people are trying to change the topography of their algo to match the display, rather than the other way around
2016-10-23 08:27:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	there's exceptions
2016-10-23 08:27:33	AdmiralBumbleBee	but I think it's a good general view
2016-10-23 08:28:19	kerrang	yeah it's been a bit since i've had to look at any dsp algos, or even math
2016-10-23 08:28:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	I was explaining this to someone else a few months ago

2016-10-23 08:29:25	kerrang	but there's still a gap between how rust operates and mimicing c++ inheritance and polymorphism

2016-10-23 12:09:00	skubi_	its not "house"

2016-10-23 12:09:10	skubi_	or "dubstep"

2016-10-23 12:17:48	skubi_	i havent ever paid attention to it
2016-10-23 12:18:29	enche	skubi_, one thing i dislike with EDM is the emphasis on creating something technically demanding and complex
2016-10-23 12:18:37	skubi_	i mean yeah
2016-10-23 12:18:40	enche	you can't make something that comes from the heart
2016-10-23 12:19:12	enche	you have to have huge epic buildup and crazy arps
2016-10-23 12:19:27	enche	and it has to sound all polished
2016-10-23 12:19:41	enche	sometimes the best music is just disco run through a lowpass filter
2016-10-23 12:20:01	enche	or a good acid line over tr909 drums

2016-10-24 03:02:41	tehsma	not for novelty, not for functionality
2016-10-24 03:02:42	tehsma	just usefulness
2016-10-24 03:02:47	elemeno	right on
2016-10-24 03:02:57	elemeno	Never really spent much time with VSTs
2016-10-24 03:03:03	tehsma	its old as fuck, its a basic subtractive synth
2016-10-24 03:03:05	elemeno	I hear the new 303 one isn't bad
2016-10-24 03:03:07	tehsma	but its got a solid modulation matrix
2016-10-24 03:03:35	hulappa_	for some reason i enjoy logics retro synth as well. just a simple subtractive synth that sounds good
2016-10-24 03:03:38	elemeno	I think I need to look into using a new daw
2016-10-24 03:03:41	hulappa_	you cant really do anything special with it
2016-10-24 03:03:50	tehsma	es2 is old as fuck
2016-10-24 03:04:11	tehsma	in theory i should have replaced it with something else. and really, zebra2 would probably the be logical replacement
2016-10-24 03:04:19	tehsma	which i use as well
2016-10-24 03:04:31	elemeno	you have me furiously googling
2016-10-24 03:04:38	tehsma	serum is the new hotness these days
2016-10-24 03:04:56	tehsma	but even serum lacks the 'two main filters' aspect which i think is FUNDAMENTAL to patch design
2016-10-24 03:05:08	tehsma	i mean, yeah you have more than one fitler, if you count the filters in the FX chain
2016-10-24 03:05:14	tehsma	but that is not hte same thing
2016-10-24 03:05:21	elemeno	yeah, a friend of mine rewrote boards of canada into a few serum machines
2016-10-24 03:05:31	elemeno	sent me the midi to route to some ext synths
2016-10-24 03:05:33	tehsma	wavetable synths are cool tho
2016-10-24 03:05:36	elemeno	to see how close it sounded
2016-10-24 03:05:51	tehsma	one of the few hardware synths i have is a wavetable synth, the waldorf Q
2016-10-24 03:05:59	tehsma	its the synth massive is more-or-less based on
2016-10-24 03:06:00	tehsma	its great
2016-10-24 03:06:12	elemeno	I've heard great things
2016-10-24 03:06:32	elemeno	like, greattt things
2016-10-24 03:06:36	tehsma	when u talk about DIGITAL hardware synths, the thing has to bring a degree of novelty to separate it from the 9 billion vsts
2016-10-24 03:06:47	elemeno	WC Olo garb has a video on it
2016-10-24 03:06:51	tehsma	oh yeah

2016-10-24 03:07:15	tehsma	that is IMO one of the most underrated hardware (digital synths)
2016-10-24 03:07:19	elemeno	his DX7 video made me go out and buy one the next day
2016-10-24 03:07:21	hulappa_	teshma, digital hardware is all right if it has good knobs to play around with
2016-10-24 03:07:23	tehsma	my friend had one

2016-10-24 03:08:22	tehsma	physical modeling, FM, subtractive, insane FX and distortion, you wonder why the fuck nobody is hyping this thing up
2016-10-24 03:08:24	tehsma	it really is insane
2016-10-24 03:08:36	elemeno	it gets some love

2016-10-24 03:09:35	elemeno	I'm not much into EDM music per se
2016-10-24 03:09:36	tehsma	its like the "film scoring" guys showing their setups and templates
2016-10-24 03:09:46	tehsma	(which is of particular interest to me)
2016-10-24 03:09:51	elemeno	but there tends to be a lot of bleed-over into things I like
2016-10-24 03:10:15	tehsma	yeah lately ive been pursuing orchestral-type stuff (faux orchestra of course)
2016-10-24 03:10:26	elemeno	I'm more of an IDM guy

2016-10-24 09:31:15	skubi	i just saw ectomorph there last month
2016-10-24 09:31:28	skubi	literally drove from columbus, partied my ass off in pittsburgh with my gf and drove right back ahaha
2016-10-24 09:31:33	jnav	word
2016-10-24 09:31:50	skubi	yeah hot mass is everything sweatbox techno parties should be
2016-10-24 09:31:51	jnav	I wasn't fully prepared the one time I went, lol

2016-10-24 09:32:12	skubi	what did you not bring enough jungle juice?
2016-10-24 09:32:26	jnav	yea :\ I got too drunk, not knowing how to party, and had to go home too early

2016-10-24 09:33:04	jnav	it was my first techno party and I was all by myself so
2016-10-24 09:33:10	skubi	yeah
2016-10-24 09:33:21	skubi	and if youre from the jungle side youre probably used to people getting MAD fucked up
2016-10-24 09:33:21	jnav	these days I drink beer just for the calories
2016-10-24 09:33:32	jnav	meh, not rly, I was 21 so I just hadn't gone out at all
2016-10-24 09:33:43	skubi	oh i see
2016-10-24 09:33:50	jnav	I like jungle but I barely ever got out to see it
2016-10-24 09:33:50	skubi	theres that too ive done that
2016-10-24 09:33:58	jnav	most drum n bass shows in the area were old, like, people in the late 30s/40s
2016-10-24 09:34:03	skubi	i used to party to jungle a lot when i lived in dayton.
2016-10-24 09:34:06	skubi	yeah
2016-10-24 09:34:12	skubi	and burnt out from doing so much speed in their youth
2016-10-24 09:34:20	skubi	least here they are
2016-10-24 09:34:22	jnav	exactly, so they kinda wobble around and tell stories
2016-10-24 09:35:16	jnav	I'm honestly not much of a party animal, I just like the music and like getting out to dance once or twice a month
2016-10-24 09:35:36	skubi	yeah
2016-10-24 09:35:45	skubi	thats good though that youre going to the right parties
2016-10-24 09:36:06	skubi	dvs1 is a bad man

2016-10-24 09:36:16	jnav	the promoters for the DVS1 show always do a good job
2016-10-24 09:36:23	skubi	although ive heard its very pretentious
2016-10-24 09:36:26	jnav	The Bunker is good, DVS1 is here thru Unter

2016-10-24 09:38:04	jnav	never partied in Detroit
2016-10-24 09:38:19	jnav	also I dunno, my only experience is Unter x The Bunker which a lot of my friends went to and said was awesome

2016-10-24 09:38:43	jnav	The Bunker throws a lot of stuff at The Good Room which honestly has one of the most pretentious AND least engaged crowds I've seen

2016-10-24 09:46:07	jnav	honestly I've never been to VIA, I don't like festival vibe, but some folks I know-ish were involved in organizing it

2016-10-24 09:52:23	jnav	I'm really strongly guessing jungle will be back in within the next 5-10 years
2016-10-24 09:52:23	jnav	but
2016-10-24 09:52:26	skubi	and the young folks were the same kind of people who listen to hiphop. just kinda super many dudes

2016-10-24 09:55:38	jnav	awwww

2016-10-24 09:57:12	Shad0w	up here in my little corner of NE scotland
2016-10-24 09:57:31	jnav	Shad0w: word! I went to fabric before it closed and the grime room was the most intense crowd I've seen at an electronic music show
2016-10-24 09:57:40	skubi	i hear that about NYC a lot i have a friend who threw punk shows there all the time in a DIY space
2016-10-24 09:57:54	skubi	and the cops regularly came and threatened to lock up everyone on the spot
2016-10-24 09:58:06	jnav	skubi: tbh I haven't heard of it happening for a while... so this weekend is kinda unfortunate
2016-10-24 09:58:14	skubi	like going around all the men and getting up in the womens faces with threats and shit
2016-10-24 09:58:23	jnav	sounds like the NYPD :\
2016-10-24 09:58:27	skubi	yeah
2016-10-24 09:58:40	skubi	if i ever move out there imma just throw shows in newark or jersey city
2016-10-24 09:58:46	skubi	or some shitty industrial spot
2016-10-24 09:58:57	skubi	idk i guess id have to learn the lay of the land and how shit works huh
2016-10-24 09:58:59	jnav	sure but folks wont come out for 'em
2016-10-24 09:59:21	jnav	there are lots of shitty industrial spots in Brooklyn that are usually totally OK
2016-10-24 09:59:37	skubi	oh right on
2016-10-24 09:59:40	skubi	thats good then
2016-10-24 09:59:46	skubi	yeah idk how shit works out there
2016-10-24 10:00:01	jnav	property is stupid expensive :|
2016-10-24 10:00:12	skubi	cops fucking hate raves here but they know what grey areas we operate in you know?
2016-10-24 10:00:32	skubi	we dobnt sell alcohol
2016-10-24 10:00:34	jnav	yeah. I think it's similar here... cops typically wont bust something up if it's not bothering ppl
2016-10-24 10:00:50	skubi	thats something that fucked us hard in the last spot
2016-10-24 10:00:53	jnav	the alcohol thing is a tough point
2016-10-24 10:00:59	skubi	alcohol for donations
2016-10-24 10:01:01	jnav	yea some pretty major venue Market Hotel got fucked for that
2016-10-24 10:01:13	skubi	which it turns out is illegal as fuck
2016-10-24 10:01:26	skubi	we just sell water and yerba now
2016-10-24 10:01:28	jnav	pretty much just HAVING alcohol is illegal
2016-10-24 10:01:36	skubi	and everyone just does ecstasy and acid and poppers
2016-10-24 10:01:38	skubi	lmao
2016-10-24 10:01:52	jnav	lol, one venue for NYE had an XXX punch laced w MDMA
2016-10-24 10:02:12	skubi	and theres casual drinking you know but its nice that people dont get really drunk too
2016-10-24 10:02:16	skubi	NICE
2016-10-24 10:02:18	jnav	I don't like to roll too often, I'll just dance sober and still have a good time
2016-10-24 10:02:30	jnav	id probably do some poppers tho if there was a chill room
2016-10-24 10:02:39	skubi	yeah for me its adderall just to stay awake
2016-10-24 10:02:49	jnav	word. I also prefer that. Red Bull is my go-to tho just because I don't know anyone who sells lol

2016-10-24 10:02:55	skubi	yeah

2016-10-24 10:03:22	jnav	this weekend is 2 AM - 10 AM, so I'll probably sleep 11-2 and show up b/w 3 and 4, dance till 8 or 9
2016-10-24 10:03:24	skubi	poppers are honestly better for hard dark techno imo but thats just me
2016-10-24 10:03:30	skubi	yeah fuck yeah!
2016-10-24 10:03:42	jnav	never DANCED with poppers but they're nice to chill with
2016-10-24 10:04:23	skubi	dude poppers make me wanna dance more than anything else

2016-10-25 03:59:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	having to move your hand that far?!
2016-10-25 04:00:03	elemeno	seems to be a bit more cross-platform than ctrl+c and ctrl+v
2016-10-25 04:00:11	elemeno	where else would your hand be?
2016-10-25 04:00:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	not all the way on the right side of the fucking keyboard
2016-10-25 04:00:23	elemeno	doesn't work well if you're in the middle of a jack sesh
2016-10-25 04:00:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	you know... on the home row?
2016-10-25 04:00:23	jnav	you have two hands
2016-10-25 04:00:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	fuck that, that's awfully inefficient
2016-10-25 04:00:38	jnav	it's faster than mouse
2016-10-25 04:00:40	jnav	probab
2016-10-25 04:00:44	elemeno	totally is
2016-10-25 04:00:52	elemeno	works in most CLI too
2016-10-25 04:00:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	c/v/x are way faster
2016-10-25 04:00:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	or y/p
2016-10-25 04:01:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	(or just cua)
2016-10-25 04:01:16	elemeno	ctrl+c is an escape signal in most CLIs
2016-10-25 04:01:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	not in bsd or os x
2016-10-25 04:01:40	elemeno	bsd eh?
2016-10-25 04:01:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	use alt-c/v/x
2016-10-25 04:01:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	not ctrl
2016-10-25 04:01:48	AdmiralBumbleBee	or cmd
2016-10-25 04:01:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	or whatever you've setup
2016-10-25 04:02:03	elemeno	do you use bsd?
2016-10-25 04:02:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	yes
2016-10-25 04:02:18	elemeno	I work with a guy who swears by it
2016-10-25 04:02:39	elemeno	he also invented the internet
2016-10-25 04:03:45	jnav	I've had so many bad experiences handling audio on Linux boxes
2016-10-25 04:03:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	linux is awful
2016-10-25 04:04:17	jnav	BSD handles audio better?
2016-10-25 04:04:20	elemeno	ehh, I've never had any issues over the years
2016-10-25 04:04:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	no
2016-10-25 04:04:40	AdmiralBumbleBee	well, technically yes
2016-10-25 04:04:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	since I am using dawin for audio
2016-10-25 04:04:48	AdmiralBumbleBee	darwin
2016-10-25 04:05:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	freebsd for most other shit
2016-10-25 04:05:40	jnav	eh, I'm tethered to Windows, thx fl studio...
2016-10-25 04:05:45	elemeno	haha
2016-10-25 04:05:47	elemeno	no hate
2016-10-25 04:05:53	jnav	sw development on Linux is nice
2016-10-25 04:05:57	elemeno	I'm also tethered to windows at home
2016-10-25 04:06:03	elemeno	counterstrike
2016-10-25 04:06:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	I rather use windows than linux any day
2016-10-25 04:06:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	at least shit works in windows sometimes
2016-10-25 04:07:01	elemeno	windows+cygwin is my main workflow @ work
2016-10-25 04:07:01		[04:07]
2016-10-25 04:07:16	elemeno	and tmux
2016-10-25 04:07:17	jnav	if I'm developing a server-side program or something, Linux is way snappier, better tooling, less magic-ey
2016-10-25 04:07:23	elemeno	which is just greatr
2016-10-25 04:07:26	elemeno	great*
2016-10-25 04:07:54	elemeno	I don't do any large scale coding, so VIM works fine
2016-10-25 04:07:54	jnav	I like using i3 and some kind of nice terminal emulator, but if I only have a textual link I'll do tmux or screen or just emacs lol
2016-10-25 04:08:05	jnav	one can do large scale coding with vim or emacs
2016-10-25 04:08:18	jnav	I will say having Visual Studio at work is nice, it has some decent addons that make life pretty easy
2016-10-25 04:08:27	elemeno	exactly
2016-10-25 04:08:45	elemeno	it can be done... but there're better ways
2016-10-25 04:08:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	elemeno: depends on what you're doing
2016-10-25 04:09:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	definitely wouldn't want to do a large lisp project in visual studio or xcode
2016-10-25 04:09:58	elemeno	i'd use an IDE for Java
2016-10-25 04:10:03	elemeno	as much as I hate Java
2016-10-25 04:10:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	I use vim for basically everything text related... except java
2016-10-25 04:10:52	AdmiralBumbleBee	for which I use netbeans
2016-10-25 04:11:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	I've tried intellij, and it's just slow as fuck
2016-10-25 04:11:19	elemeno	eclipse isn't awful if you know exactly how to use it
2016-10-25 04:11:37	wrl	linux is fine for audio, abb is just a curmudgeon
2016-10-25 04:11:42	elemeno	lol
2016-10-25 04:12:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	wrl: yeah, because on other platforms people have to ask 'how do I use a vst?'

2016-10-25 04:12:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	let's be clear

2016-10-25 04:12:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	but in our hate of windows, we are united
2016-10-25 04:13:24	CultLeader	thats weird
2016-10-25 04:13:39	CultLeader	my windows os plays multiple applications
2016-10-25 04:13:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	CultLeader: it's driver dependent
2016-10-25 04:14:48	CultLeader	i thought it was windows audio endpoint builder
2016-10-25 04:15:09	CultLeader	absent before w7, iirc
2016-10-25 04:15:11	wrl	AdmiralBumbleBee: i'm generally on your side in the linux vs BSD discussion ftr
2016-10-25 04:15:18	wrl	i try not to use linux on my servers
2016-10-25 04:15:34	wrl	but by the same token freebsd is also just not there. there are a bunch of small things it does weirdly
2016-10-25 04:15:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	linux would be totally fine for audio...
2016-10-25 04:15:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	if people didn't try to shoe-horn in all sorts of retarded shit
2016-10-25 04:15:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	like windows vsts, or vst in general
2016-10-25 04:16:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	or having multiple competing audio systems
2016-10-25 04:16:03	wrl	native vsts work pretty well tbh
2016-10-25 04:16:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	and they're fairly rare
2016-10-25 04:16:28	wrl	from commercial devs, no, but from opensource devs yes
2016-10-25 04:16:43	wrl	we don't have the reach that osx and windows have, that's no secret
2016-10-25 04:16:46	CultLeader	developers often imagine that they are selling software to other developers
2016-10-25 04:16:53	CultLeader	instead of end users
2016-10-25 04:16:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	the issue I take with it... is there's a ridiculous amount of pre-requisite knowledge to build and maintain a working linux audio environment
2016-10-25 04:17:11	CultLeader	with this mistake, it's easy to see forcing people to program their own synths as "normal"
2016-10-25 04:17:28	Nahck	mmmmmm..... tuned kicks.... mmmmmm <3
2016-10-25 04:17:33	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'm sure I could actually be pretty happy on linux... more so than I am on OS X
2016-10-25 04:17:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	but the effort required for the minimal improvement in QoL
2016-10-25 04:17:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	not worth it
2016-10-25 04:17:47	CultLeader	with LADSPA or ALSA?
2016-10-25 04:17:50	wrl	i mean, I buy that, but getting windows systems working properly isn't a cakewalk either. not when companies can say "we don't install extra shit stock" as a marketing tactic
2016-10-25 04:18:05	AdmiralBumbleBee	wrl: oh no... windows is garbage for maintenance too
2016-10-25 04:18:07	wrl	there's just a whole industry built around it
2016-10-25 04:18:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	but at least there's resources that don't suck
2016-10-25 04:18:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	I know plenty of people with stable windows boxes
2016-10-25 04:18:33	CultLeader	what sort of maintenance?
2016-10-25 04:18:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	but I encounter WAY more pepole that just have to wipe their shit and start over every 6 months
2016-10-25 04:18:44	CultLeader	you mean running chkdsk?
2016-10-25 04:18:57	wrl	at this point i think windows and linux are close to on par wrt the amount of work needed to go from "not installed" to "installed and working like i want it", but there's an entire industry built around the windows concerns

2016-10-25 04:19:31	CultLeader	thats like saying Linux requires you to reinstall just because your dumb ass didnt know what "rm -rf" meant
2016-10-25 04:19:33	AdmiralBumbleBee	wrl: same amount of typing/mouse moving sure...
2016-10-25 04:19:35	CultLeader	and you typed it into a box
2016-10-25 04:19:39	CultLeader	and now your shit is gone :)

2016-10-25 04:19:54	wrl	CultLeader: i'm saying that if you wanted to reinstall windows on a laptop you need a substantial amount of effort. gotta get the drivers (if you can't find your manufacturer OS reinstall CD)
2016-10-25 04:19:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	wrl: linux... some reading is required
2016-10-25 04:20:08	CultLeader	not really
2016-10-25 04:20:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	even for me... I'm pretty solid working on bsd platforms
2016-10-25 04:20:16	wrl	oh has it gotten better?
2016-10-25 04:20:19	CultLeader	modern BIOSes have network stacks

2016-10-25 04:21:22	CultLeader	if you bought a laptop, it came with motherboard drivers
2016-10-25 04:21:22	wrl	AdmiralBumbleBee: linux having the drivers in the kernel is a major leg up over windows
2016-10-25 04:21:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	linux definitely supports more stuff 'out of the box'
2016-10-25 04:21:26	CultLeader	on a CD probably
2016-10-25 04:21:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	but when shit doesn't work in linux... holy fuck is it a PITA.
2016-10-25 04:21:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	with windows if something isn't working, you probably just need to google a driver
2016-10-25 04:21:45	wrl	CultLeader: yeah but you install that and then spend your time stripping out all the bullshit that comes bundled
2016-10-25 04:21:55	CultLeader	why?
2016-10-25 04:22:07	wrl	AdmiralBumbleBee: right, but that can be difficult when it's the display driver and you've only got an 800x600 resolution

2016-10-25 04:27:47	wrl	the overlap between "producer" and "computer technician" is less great than you'd think. in professional studios they have IT people to handle that and even in that case the IT folk will prioritise stability day over day

2016-10-25 10:46:40	hello	oh wait no, its cuz you gotta dc mothafucka jumping in on the signal
2016-10-25 10:46:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	enche: resistors.
2016-10-25 10:46:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's that simple
2016-10-25 10:47:02	enche	really?
2016-10-25 10:47:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	simply 1 serial with input
2016-10-25 10:47:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	one parallel with i/o
2016-10-25 10:47:18	enche	just a bigass resistor
2016-10-25 10:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	and your transistor
2016-10-25 10:47:25	enche	1m ohms or something
2016-10-25 10:47:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	except all this shit is in a network of resistors in your package
2016-10-25 10:47:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	sec
2016-10-25 10:47:32	enche	yeah
2016-10-25 10:48:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	enche: https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-17cf0e386d2f518f77cef11055c63561?convert_to_webp=true
2016-10-25 10:48:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	basically that... but in a network of shit
2016-10-25 10:49:22	enche	AdmiralBumbleBee, but isn't that in itself an opamp?
2016-10-25 10:49:22		[10:49]
2016-10-25 10:49:33	enche	opamps are made of smaller opamps?
2016-10-25 10:50:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	enche: actually, kinda yes.
2016-10-25 10:50:26	enche	thats cool
2016-10-25 10:50:28	jnav	transistors
2016-10-25 10:50:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	jnav: well yeah, but the circuit I posted is a basic opamp
2016-10-25 10:50:45	jnav	sure
2016-10-25 10:50:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	which obviously has a transistor
2016-10-25 10:50:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	but opamps are in essence a bunch of opamp circuits
2016-10-25 10:51:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	most of them at least

2016-10-25 10:51:30	jnav	it's been a few years

2016-10-25 10:53:57	jnav	I'm glad I didn't pursue EE
2016-10-25 10:54:16	MultiTrack	EE? Electrical Engineering?
2016-10-25 10:54:25	jnav	yeah.
2016-10-25 10:54:52	MultiTrack	I lot of the students I work with in robotics are considering EE. I don't know if it's something I'd want to study myself.
2016-10-25 10:55:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'm glad I totally wasted my fucking time doing music
2016-10-25 10:55:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	rather than something useful, like getting an mba
2016-10-25 10:55:22	MultiTrack	ha
2016-10-25 10:55:25	MultiTrack	useful - mba
2016-10-25 10:55:25	MultiTrack	ha
2016-10-25 10:55:47	MultiTrack	MBA's are okay if you already have a decent amount of liquid capital.
2016-10-25 10:55:49	enche	the running up that hill pitch bent cello synth
2016-10-25 10:55:55	enche	is the coolest sound ever
2016-10-25 10:56:01	MultiTrack	But mostly they;re only good for getting in to mid-upper level corporate management.
2016-10-25 10:56:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	MultiTrack: I'm more so commenting on music education, not business education
2016-10-25 10:56:35	MultiTrack	Yeah, I get that, I'm just saying that an MBA is not neccesarily a good choice for business education
2016-10-25 10:56:46	MultiTrack	It's more like a certificate of proof that you have a good amount of capital.
2016-10-25 10:56:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	we agree...
2016-10-25 10:56:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	and yet I think it's better than having done music
2016-10-25 10:57:04	MultiTrack	Perhaps, yeah.
2016-10-25 10:57:33	MultiTrack	I'm not sure what the job market is for people with degrees in music fields though.
2016-10-25 10:57:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	MultiTrack: do you want fries with that?
2016-10-25 10:58:06	jnav	Computer Science was a good pick for me
2016-10-25 10:58:11	MultiTrack	I mean like, I don't know if it's a prereq for higher salaried positions in education, or if they don't actually care.
2016-10-25 10:58:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	either you're a teacher (like 90%of the people I went to school with) or you're a session player (about 1%)
2016-10-25 10:58:33	AdmiralBumbleBee	the rest all have 'another job'
2016-10-25 10:59:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	unsurprisingly, bartender and waiter seem to be very popular among my peers.
2016-10-25 10:59:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	sad fucks
2016-10-25 10:59:14	MultiTrack	More and more degrees are becoming like that these days, it seems. Even in more technical fields I get asked more about my certs than any degree.

2016-10-25 11:02:40	AdmiralBumbleBee	I was turned down after school though
2016-10-25 11:02:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	after someone found out I was a recent graduate (despite already calling me based on word of mouth)
2016-10-25 11:03:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	they hired someone else
2016-10-25 11:03:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	just because 'they don't deal with school kids'
2016-10-25 11:03:13	MultiTrack	For what kind of position?

2016-10-25 11:03:30	MultiTrack	That's fucking stupid.

2016-10-25 11:04:21	AdmiralBumbleBee	they wouldn't take me BECAUSE I had a degree

2016-10-25 11:05:12	MultiTrack	but I think the vets just need to get the hell over it.
2016-10-25 11:05:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	I don't think it's so bad with music now
2016-10-25 11:05:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	I've been told by some really old guys that it was even worse in the 60s/70s
2016-10-25 11:06:22	MultiTrack	That doesn't really surprise me.
2016-10-25 11:06:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	I graduated in the 90s and it only happened once, maybe twice (speculation)
2016-10-25 11:06:40	MultiTrack	It's usually people from that generation that just have an age issue in the first place, from my experience.
2016-10-25 11:07:10	MultiTrack	Not grad, undergrad, too recent a grad, etc. They always come up with some reason that boils down to "I was here first."
2016-10-25 11:07:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	eh
2016-10-25 11:07:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	I dunno
2016-10-25 11:07:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	most college grads are fucking morons
2016-10-25 11:07:38	AdmiralBumbleBee	and don't know enough to get an apprentice position, let alone do actual work
2016-10-25 11:07:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	so I can understand the bias
2016-10-25 11:07:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	definitely different with music usually though, since many programs are merit based
2016-10-25 11:08:18	AdmiralBumbleBee	if you get in to a decent program, you're probably already an ok musician
2016-10-25 11:09:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	the program I was in, you couldn't even start unless you could demonstrate strong sight reading skills and intermediate piano proficiency
2016-10-25 11:09:20	MultiTrack	I'll probably go the rest of my life as a hobbyist. I play in a few bands - mostly jazz trombone or piano, but I don't imagine myself ever trying to make money from it.
2016-10-25 11:09:33	AdmiralBumbleBee	most cs, ee, medical etc... shit
2016-10-25 11:09:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	anyone can get in by just doing pre-reqs
2016-10-25 11:09:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	which is fine
2016-10-25 11:10:35	MultiTrack	Yeah, well, there's the whole thesis thing, too...which is an attempt at meritocratical oversight. It doesn't really work too well though, imo. They usually end up just really obscure so they can be technically inventive.

2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[20:58:33] the rest all have 'another job' [20:58:33]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[20:59:01] unsurprisingly, bartender and waiter seem to be very popular among my peers. [20:59:01]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[20:59:07] sad fucks [20:59:07]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	MultiTrack	[20:59:14] More and more degrees are becoming like that these days, it seems. Even in more technical fields I get asked more about my certs than any degree. [20:59:14]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	MultiTrack	[20:59:33] I've never had a client ask if I had a degree, but I've listed certs on resumes frequently. [20:59:33]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	MultiTrack	[21:01:42] I do like music education though - like, not as a step towards a career, but sometimes picking up an elective can be nice. [21:01:42]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	MultiTrack	[21:01:59] Often times you can find some localish seminars too. [21:01:59]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:02:16] O [21:02:16]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:02:22] I've never had someone ask if I have a degree [21:02:22]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	MultiTrack	[21:02:24] I've never really seen any that are geared towards EDM, though. [21:02:24]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:02:40] I was turned down after school though [21:02:40]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:02:57] after someone found out I was a recent graduate (despite already calling me based on word of mouth) [21:02:57]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:03:01] they hired someone else [21:03:01]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:03:08] just because 'they don't deal with school kids' [21:03:08]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	MultiTrack	[21:03:13] For what kind of position? [21:03:13]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:03:18] session work [21:03:18]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	MultiTrack	[21:03:30] That's fucking stupid. [21:03:30]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:03:38] it is [21:03:38]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:03:45] seems to be less common now [21:03:45]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	MultiTrack	[21:03:49] "Oh, you need to pay tens of thousands of dollars before you're a hirable adult" [21:03:49]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:04:05] no [21:04:05]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:04:09] it was the opposite [21:04:09]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	MultiTrack	[21:04:11] Oh wait, we still don't think you're an adult [21:04:11]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:04:21] they wouldn't take me BECAUSE I had a degree [21:04:21]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:04:33] just because of all the little shits that come out of school thinking they know everything they need to know [21:04:33]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:04:40] and question every fucking thing in the room [21:04:40]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	MultiTrack	[21:05:04] Right...I know a lot of engineers who steer clear of recent grads too [21:05:04]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	MultiTrack	[21:05:12] but I think the vets just need to get the hell over it. [21:05:12]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:05:29] I don't think it's so bad with music now [21:05:29]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:05:57] I've been told by some really old guys that it was even worse in the 60s/70s [21:05:57]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	MultiTrack	[21:06:22] That doesn't really surprise me. [21:06:22]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:06:29] I graduated in the 90s and it only happened once, maybe twice (speculation) [21:06:29]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	MultiTrack	[21:06:40] It's usually people from that generation that just have an age issue in the first place, from my experience. [21:06:40]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	MultiTrack	[21:07:10] Not grad, undergrad, too recent a grad, etc. They always come up with some reason that boils down to "I was here first." [21:07:10]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:07:19] eh [21:07:19]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:07:20] I dunno [21:07:20]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:07:25] most college grads are fucking morons [21:07:25]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:07:38] and don't know enough to get an apprentice position, let alone do actual work [21:07:38]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:07:42] so I can understand the bias [21:07:42]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:07:56] definitely different with music usually though, since many programs are merit based [21:07:56]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:08:18] if you get in to a decent program, you're probably already an ok musician [21:08:18]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:09:19] the program I was in, you couldn't even start unless you could demonstrate strong sight reading skills and intermediate piano proficiency [21:09:19]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	MultiTrack	[21:09:20] I'll probably go the rest of my life as a hobbyist. I play in a few bands - mostly jazz trombone or piano, but I don't imagine myself ever trying to make money from it. [21:09:20]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:09:33] most cs, ee, medical etc... shit [21:09:33]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:09:41] anyone can get in by just doing pre-reqs [21:09:41]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:09:49] which is fine [21:09:49]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	MultiTrack	[21:10:35] Yeah, well, there's the whole thesis thing, too...which is an attempt at meritocratical oversight. It doesn't really work too well though, imo. They usually end up just really obscure so they can be technically inventive. [21:10:35]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:11:12] no thesis for us [21:11:12]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:11:16] just a shitload of juries [21:11:16]
2016-10-25 11:47:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	[21:11:18] ugh :( [21:11:18]

2016-10-25 13:38:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	so you can draw shit and it adds to it, divids by it, offsets by it, divides it etc..

2016-10-25 13:43:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	and you have a very powerful environment
2016-10-25 13:43:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	(DP has basically the same shit, but cubase's shows the idea better)
2016-10-25 13:44:03	kerrang	i've mentioned it before, but someday i will take time to move to dp or cubase
2016-10-25 13:44:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	or you could move to a tracker
2016-10-25 13:44:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	then you basically work in an event list :)
2016-10-25 13:45:02	kerrang	heh, i was also planning on buying that renoise sampler
2016-10-25 13:45:10	kerrang	basically have a tracker-based sampler plugin
2016-10-25 13:45:19	kerrang	good price too

2016-10-25 13:49:46	kerrang	[23:38:21] ho shit i want a draw key for velocity editing [23:38:21]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	[23:38:37] kerrang: it also has add/divide/mult modes too [23:38:37]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	[23:38:39] not just 'set' [23:38:39]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	[23:38:55] so you can draw shit and it adds to it, divids by it, offsets by it, divides it etc.. [23:38:55]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	[23:39:06] so you can mix shapes with various scaling [23:39:06]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	kerrang	[23:39:07] nnnnnnngh [23:39:07]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	[23:39:18] that's one of the less cool features of dp ;) [23:39:18]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	kerrang	[23:39:54] one thing i wish bitwig did was at least provide a line spanning the velocity editing window when i change values [23:39:54]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	kerrang	[23:40:15] because sometimes i cannot fucking tell how large the difference is between two note velocites when they arent adjacent [23:40:15]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	[23:40:44] what you really need is an event list [23:40:44]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	[23:40:53] (or a tracker) [23:40:53]

2016-10-25 13:49:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	[23:40:59] makes that sort of shit super, super, easy [23:40:59]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	[23:41:48] you should look at cubase's event list [23:41:48]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	[23:41:50] it's really neat [23:41:50]

2016-10-25 13:49:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	[23:42:20] maybe you can get an idea from that [23:42:20]

2016-10-26 12:34:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	logic seems alright to me
2016-10-26 12:34:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	but I'm not much of a fan of the single-platform nature of it

2016-10-26 13:16:22	wrl	i'd take most of what BT says with a grain of solt
2016-10-26 13:16:23	wrl	salt
2016-10-26 13:16:29	wrl	he was an all-ableton dude for a while
2016-10-26 13:17:24	wrl	and ABB's right -- people become millionaires off of FL studio productions these days. use whatever you want and shut up.
2016-10-26 13:18:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	unless it's reaper
2016-10-26 13:18:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	if it's reaper, you're a fucking idiot
2016-10-26 13:18:11	wrl	lol
2016-10-26 13:18:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
2016-10-26 13:18:19	wrl	reaper's alright. y'could do worse.
2016-10-26 13:18:37	AdmiralBumbleBee	well yeah, but getting a twig jammed in your urethrae is pretty rare
2016-10-26 13:18:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	so you won't do worse very often
2016-10-26 13:18:45	robotika	i'm not into BT, but he was a logic dude back in the day
2016-10-26 13:18:47	Estr	can I render all these on by one without doing it manually somehow? 6eeb8fc2132945c45fad890b944453bc
2016-10-26 13:18:55	wrl	reaper is exactly what you'd expect from the people who developed it
2016-10-26 13:18:56	 *	robotika and hex bond over how apple fucked logic
2016-10-26 13:19:08	robotika	which is the only reason i mentioned it
2016-10-26 13:19:15	wrl	yeah
2016-10-26 13:19:16	robotika	i use a 4 track tape player atm!
2016-10-26 13:19:22	wrl	so, BT factoid here that I love recounting
2016-10-26 13:19:26	wrl	remember "this binary universe"?
2016-10-26 13:19:39	robotika	i heard it once maybe
2016-10-26 13:19:44	wrl	his like...experimental IDM opus or whatever
2016-10-26 13:20:02	wrl	he's on record as saying that he produced the entirety of the first track in csound
2016-10-26 13:20:13	wrl	and richard boulanger is mentioned specifically in the liner notes
2016-10-26 13:20:42	wrl	couple of years ago, i ran into the dude who co-produced that album (brian trifon of trifonic) and asked him about that
2016-10-26 13:20:56	wrl	and he was like "oh hell no, brian did the bells in csound but we produced the whole thing in logic"
2016-10-26 13:21:42	robotika	well, not a total lie
2016-10-26 13:21:51	robotika	i'm sure it wasn't mastered in csound either
2016-10-26 13:21:59	wrl	true
2016-10-26 13:22:01	wrl	csound is fun tho tbh
2016-10-26 13:22:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	wrl: googling it, it seems he only claims one track was made in csound though?
2016-10-26 13:22:36	wrl	AdmiralBumbleBee: yeah but this is the one track i'm talking about
2016-10-26 13:22:53	wrl	i was just curious because i've done full-csound tracks before and i wanted to hear how he did it

2016-10-26 15:14:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	I submitted a bunch of fixes and tracked down some issues, and even then the consensus was 'Nobody comes and complains about this stuff'
2016-10-26 15:14:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	so they have no reason to expend effort on it
2016-10-26 15:16:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	but I've also learned that a lot of people don't notice these seemingly obvious things at all

2016-10-27 07:59:35	adq	$300 iirc
2016-10-27 07:59:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	really can't say that the surface looks that great, but this new macbook is definitely magnitudes more retarded

2016-10-27 07:59:57	_Hex_	surface looks pretty awesome IMO
2016-10-27 07:59:59	adq	ahh then no
2016-10-27 08:00:05	subsigna_	yea im digging the surface
2016-10-27 08:00:06	adq	i thought it was a pack with mini 3D printer
2016-10-27 08:00:15	adq	maybe not the same thing idk i will look
2016-10-27 08:00:26	_Hex_	oh..i don't knoe about their 3d printer thing
2016-10-27 08:00:31	adq	their VR stuff (hololens) is prohibitiv for me atm: $3000

2016-10-27 08:02:39	Mikarin_	I have A&H ZEDi-10FX and the instrument/pad channels give a nasty feedback when I plug something into them.
2016-10-27 08:02:39		[08:02]
2016-10-27 08:02:42	Mikarin_	Other channels are fine
2016-10-27 08:03:02	Mikarin_	sorry no
2016-10-27 08:03:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	Mikarin_: is it actually feedback, or just some sort of noise
2016-10-27 08:03:07	Mikarin_	noise
2016-10-27 08:03:08	_Hex_	feedback or distortion?
2016-10-27 08:03:08	Mikarin_	sorry
2016-10-27 08:03:41	Mikarin_	just noise
2016-10-27 08:03:56	_Hex_	and what sort of input are you plugging into them?
2016-10-27 08:04:16	Mikarin_	Just a standard mono 6.3mm cable
2016-10-27 08:04:16	Mikarin_	http://www.allen-heath.com/media/ZEDi-10FX_Top1.jpg
2016-10-27 08:04:22	Mikarin_	channels M1 and M2 are the ones
2016-10-27 08:04:28	_Hex_	yeah..but from what source?
2016-10-27 08:04:38	Mikarin_	Ah Electribe or A4
2016-10-27 08:04:48	Mikarin_	They work fine with other channels
2016-10-27 08:05:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	Mikarin_: does it do the same thing if you have the instrument selector flipped
2016-10-27 08:05:25	wrl	alright fuckers let's see the logic pro demo
2016-10-27 08:05:35	_Hex_	right..so you're plugging a line level input into something that's expecting an instrument level input
2016-10-27 08:05:40	Mikarin_	AdmiralBumbleBee: then there is no sound
2016-10-27 08:05:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	Mikarin_: then you need to turn of the gain on the device, and the mixer
2016-10-27 08:05:56	Mikarin_	_Hex_: there is a switch
2016-10-27 08:05:58	wrl	lmao not logic pro ok
2016-10-27 08:06:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	Mikarin_: the mixer should be in 'line' mode for the a4 and electribe, NOT instrument mode
2016-10-27 08:06:30	Mikarin_	yeas, I'm aware of this
2016-10-27 08:06:31	adq	lol

2016-10-27 08:11:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	Mikarin_: do the devices work on the line-only channels?
2016-10-27 08:11:25	Mikarin_	Yes
2016-10-27 08:11:38	AdmiralBumbleBee	then you need to read the manual and figure this out, or your mixer is broken
2016-10-27 08:11:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	Mikarin_: perhaps there's some PFL switch or routing switch or something that's on
2016-10-27 08:12:15	Mikarin_	mm
2016-10-27 08:12:26	_Hex_	i just skimmed the manual..no reason it shouldn't work if you've done what i suggested
2016-10-27 08:13:01	Mikarin_	Well I don't have it here atm, I have to check again but I'm pretty sure I've checked everything
2016-10-27 08:13:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	if you did, then the mixer is broken
2016-10-27 08:13:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	but you should definitely re-check

2016-10-27 08:13:44	Mikarin_	It's pretty new and I have never moved it after I took it out from the box
2016-10-27 08:14:09	_Hex_	i'm guessing user error here
2016-10-27 08:14:51	Mikarin_	Could it be electricity?
2016-10-27 08:14:57	Mikarin_	Everything is on the same socket
2016-10-27 08:15:22	_Hex_	if it works on the other channels
2016-10-27 08:15:22	_Hex_	then no
2016-10-27 08:15:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	that would not explain why the line-mode isn't giving sound
2016-10-27 08:15:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	the only thing that'd explain that is some switch that changes routing, a pad or it's broken
2016-10-27 08:15:44	_Hex_	it's probably just the gain pot down
2016-10-27 08:15:50	_Hex_	or routing as you say
2016-10-27 08:15:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	he did say the gain was the same as the other channels that work though?
2016-10-27 08:16:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	"<Mikarin_>	gain is the same as with the line only channels"
2016-10-27 08:17:23	_Hex_	got a mic to test the inputs on them?

2016-10-27 08:20:29	subsigna_	oh i see
2016-10-27 08:20:59	Mikarin_	Actually might be the gain too since I always have my master fader so low
2016-10-27 08:21:56	Mikarin_	I have the master usually sub -20db
2016-10-27 08:22:04	_Hex_	leave master fader at unity if using it as a master fader and use your phones out or whatever to adjust what you're hearing

2016-10-27 10:44:21	_Hex_	if you know what you're doing..i think alloy is more powerful at this point

2016-10-28 06:45:40	jnav	i wonder if they tried a logarithmic fit

2016-10-28 17:01:53	MSHMTX	are supersaws really that hard though like i swear everyone gets excited about supersaws its easy as fuck lol
2016-10-28 17:02:05	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's not easy to do an authentic supersaw
2016-10-28 17:02:10	jnav	its harder on an 80s synth
2016-10-28 17:02:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	in fact it's rather difficult
2016-10-28 17:02:23	jnav	i had to do some layering stuff involving voice stealing
2016-10-28 17:02:25	MSHMTX	its far from the holy grail of sound design though
2016-10-28 17:02:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	MSHMTX: that kinda depends on the person though
2016-10-28 17:02:45	jnav	there's no such thing as a holy grail of sound design
2016-10-28 17:02:51	MSHMTX	but yeah i guess on an old low voice # analogue
2016-10-28 17:03:16	jnav	ESQ-1 is 3x OSCs with 8 voices, and you can layer 2 patches for 6x OSC with 4 voices
2016-10-28 17:03:19	MSHMTX	thats wrong too what about synthesizing a realistic sounding instrument, i bet thatd be considered the holy grail
2016-10-28 17:03:23	MSHMTX	im not trying to diminish you
2016-10-28 17:03:29	jnav	the hard part is the two patches are separate, so you need to make sure the envelopes are exactly the same and whatnot
2016-10-28 17:03:32	MSHMTX	i just wonder whats so exciting about supersaws
2016-10-28 17:03:46	jnav	they sound exciting, they are inherently an exciting synth
2016-10-28 17:03:51	jnav	lots of high frequency motion
2016-10-28 17:04:00	jnav	Korg M1 will do real instrument synthesis better than my ESQ-1
2016-10-28 17:04:09	jnav	its not built for that purpose
2016-10-28 17:04:37	MSHMTX	i could make a supersaw in serum in like 10 seconds lol
2016-10-28 17:04:49	MSHMTX	no i got you
2016-10-28 17:04:52	MSHMTX	sorry

2016-10-28 17:08:24	MSHMTX	like i said i imagine it is hard with older synths and was quite an achievement back in the 80s and 90s
2016-10-28 17:08:57	jnav	I wouldn't call it an "achievement" but it's kind-of a pain

2016-10-29 18:39:19	sR780k	[02:00:34] im curious about what you would recommend [02:00:34]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:00:58] sR780k: budget and room size are important [02:00:58]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:01:36] sR780k: in the same category, you can get a pair of tannoy reveals [02:01:36]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:01:39] which are far better [02:01:39]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	sR780k	[02:02:19] 25-30m2 and around that price, but that'd be 2nd hand [02:02:19]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	kerrang	[02:03:38] dammit, i would forget a measurement i need [02:03:38]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	sR780k	[02:04:46] AdmiralBumbleBee you have a few others that are better in the same category? [02:04:46]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	sR780k	[02:20:50] what you think about the JBL LSR305 ? [02:20:50]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:21:37] sR780k: those are decent too [02:21:37]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	sR780k	[02:22:36] as you seem to be the admiral here, can you grade them? [02:22:36]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	sR780k	[02:22:36] :> [02:22:36]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	kerrang	[02:23:19] bad joke is bad [02:23:19]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	 *	sR780k [02:23:38] is ashamed in the corner [02:23:38]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	kerrang	[02:24:47] crap now i'm looking at monitors and wondering what i'd buy [02:24:47]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	sR780k	[02:24:57] yamaha hs5? [02:24:57]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	sR780k	[02:26:36] im making a list so i am prepared when i see a audioshop, tumble in there like yall got any of those maybe? [02:26:36]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	sR780k	[02:26:36] think thatd be the plan [02:26:36]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:28:55] sR780k: honestly, it wont' matter much if your room is shit. [02:28:55]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:29:00] so don't fret over it too much [02:29:00]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	sR780k	[02:29:42] i built two diffusers, workin on some basstraps and looking at a new diffuser [02:29:42]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	sR780k	[02:31:34] but have an actual listen to the different speakers obviously should happen first to make a decision, at least an informed one [02:31:34]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:35:57] sR780k: I think if you avoid krk and any company that makes interfaces [02:35:57]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:36:11] sR780k: and stay under 150mm woofers [02:36:11]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:36:13] you should be fine [02:36:13]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	sR780k	[02:36:56] cant afford to top that anyway :p [02:36:56]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	[02:37:18] the yamaha stuff is usually ok, but I don't know about their latest line perosnally [02:37:18]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	Shad0w	[02:48:02] i kinda want a set of second hand mackies [02:48:02]
