2016-10-08 11:35:36	MetaNova	it's asking you to provide the fingerprint for the variable irc.server.BNC.ssl_fingerprint
2016-10-08 11:35:50	MetaNova	the command displayed is what you put into your terminal to get the fingerprint
2016-10-08 11:36:06	MetaNova	not really anything more to explain
2016-10-08 11:36:20	MetaNova	if you're still confused, I might suggest using a client which doesn't expect as much
2016-10-08 11:36:36	MetaNova	maybe something with buttons you can click on
