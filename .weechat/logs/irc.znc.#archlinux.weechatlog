2016-09-15 22:10:53	TheAnachron	how can you compare a tool like systemd which grows and replaces a lot of other tools with other tools when its one of a kind? There are not a lot of other libraries which grow in this rate
2016-09-15 22:11:04	MrElendig	eg stringing together 40 binaries using bash script and fragile string parsing/manipulation is anything but KISS
2016-09-15 22:11:19	MrElendig	but at the same time people claim that sysvinit is KISS and systemd is horrible

2016-09-16 08:27:54	MrNeon	Gaffel, the routers answers to DNS but I'm using Google's DNS with "server=8.8.8.8" on dnsmasq.conf, I thought that "server=//192.168.1.1" would redirect dotless domains to the router.
2016-09-16 08:28:11	MacGyver	It should.
2016-09-16 08:28:23	Gaffel	If your router responds, use it as your DNS
2016-09-16 08:28:38	Gaffel	If your router can't resolve it, it will forward the lookup.
2016-09-16 08:28:57	MrNeon	It will answer to some domains with a legal notice.
2016-09-16 08:29:07	MacGyver	Gaffel: Except forwarding the lookup is exactly what he doesn't want to do because the router will forward to the ISP's DNS server, not Google's.
2016-09-16 08:29:11	sypher	MrNeon: You have a fundamental misunderstanding of how DNS works. You need to pass a DNS domain/DNS suffix to your clients through DHCP, and use the router for ALL DNS lookups. Configure the router to forward to your desired DNS host.
2016-09-16 08:29:24	MacGyver	MrNeon: I take it the router isn't configurable to ignore your ISP's DHCP-provided DNS server?
2016-09-16 08:29:37	MacGyver	sypher: No, he does not.
2016-09-16 08:29:38	Gaffel	Can't you specify forwarderes manually in your router?
2016-09-16 08:29:41	MrNeon	It's an ISP router, I can't touch anything pretty much.
2016-09-16 08:30:02	Gaffel	I see
2016-09-16 08:30:19	MacGyver	He's configuring the *local* resolver to distinguish between qualified domainnames and local names. Local names go to server A, qualified names to server B.
2016-09-16 08:30:28	grazzolini	MrNeon: why not skip your router altogether?
2016-09-16 08:30:33	MacGyver	This should work fine, and usually does, and is supported by dnsmasq.
2016-09-16 08:30:48	Gaffel	So, a local DNS on the machine that splits the resolving into stub zones.
2016-09-16 08:30:49	MacGyver	grazzolini: Local DHCP-based DNS lookups a la dyndns.

What this does is forwards all client traffic through the vpn, so if I connect to 8.8.8.8 from my client, it first goes through the vpn server and then to 8.8.8.8.

I want to be able to run some operation in pacman that will not touch packages ahead of the mirror and only touch those behind. You're telling me that's not possible. Understood.
2016-09-16 12:05:59	PragmaticAnarchy	hello, i need some help with telepathy for lastest plasma 5, it let me config the google account but when i go to the icon on the task bar it says i have no account configured. When i open the account manager google is there.
2016-09-16 12:06:13	eris	Fucking hell.  Idiots.
2016-09-16 12:06:25	alyptik	teprrr: i messed with it a bit when i had ddwrt still, now i have asuswrt so haven't touched it in a while
2016-09-16 12:06:53	Boohbah	DarkFeather: Read again what -U does.
2016-09-16 12:07:09	eris	DarkFeather: You fucking told pacman to install the newest version of the package, that's the polar fucking oposite of "running some operation in pacman that will not touch packages ahead of the mirror".
2016-09-16 12:07:30	eris	So stop running `-Su opensmtpd`.
2016-09-16 12:07:36	eris	When that's clearly not what  you want.
2016-09-16 12:07:37	DarkFeather	OK
2016-09-16 12:07:46	teprrr	alyptik: yup. I'm always somehow mistaking those too, haven't configured them often enough :)

2016-09-17 11:44:35	Namarrgon	not sure but i thought it only affected the blob
2016-09-17 11:44:41	fishbulb	what blob
2016-09-17 11:44:48	fishbulb	you mean using them as one giant monitor?
2016-09-17 11:44:49	Namarrgon	unless they disabled it in the firmware too
2016-09-17 11:45:08	MacGyver	So, in principle, it should be doable with nouveau, but then you get into xinerama-fuckery-territory.
2016-09-17 11:45:14	fishbulb	as far as I can tell it's completely disabled any way you try to do it
2016-09-17 11:45:20	Namarrgon	blob == proprietary driver

2016-09-17 14:43:37	Gaffel	underyx, with UEFI, the bootloader can be on one drive and the operatingsystem on a completely different drive. You're free to place the bootloader where ever you want as long as the firmware knows where it is and the filesystem where it's located is supported.

2016-09-17 16:43:08	\z\z\z	alright, I am back again with the same issue which is an intermittent buzzing in my 3.5mm headphones. it is hard to explain the issue but when focusing some applications there is a constant buzz. I have tried changing the cable out on the headphones with no change. earlier today wiggling the cable a bit (on the pc side) seemed to change the intensity of the buzz but now there is no effect. killing
2016-09-17 16:43:09	\z\z\z	pulseaudio to run only also also changed nothing. for some reason running compton makes buzzing 5x worse

2016-09-17 19:17:55	Trashlord	starship_trooper: I switched to the LTS kernel and the problem has been significantly reduced.
2016-09-17 19:18:19	Trashlord	it still happens sometimes, though
2016-09-17 19:18:21	starship_trooper	Trashlord: I have it every time I suspend
2016-09-17 19:18:29	Hwkiller	my wife's laptop has issues with that sometimes; seems to be related to video driver for her
2016-09-17 19:18:32	Hwkiller	she's on mint though
2016-09-17 19:18:33	Trashlord	starship_trooper: try switching to the LTSkernel
2016-09-17 19:19:02	Hwkiller	and yeah, it was some weird problem with her video driver (nouveau) on the newer kernels. switched her to lts and seemed to work better
2016-09-17 19:19:17	Trashlord	I installed Arch on this laptop back in March. Initially things were fine, everything ran smoothly. Then around June I started experiencing these freeze-ups when resuming from suspend
2016-09-17 19:19:31	starship_trooper	Trashlord: I have no expeience of switching to a new kernel
2016-09-17 19:19:45	starship_trooper	Hwkiller: I have INtel + AMD. 
2016-09-17 19:19:49	Trashlord	after I switched to the LTS kernel, it reduced the problem significantly. It still happens sometimes, but is more rare for me now
2016-09-17 19:19:58	Trashlord	starship_trooper: download linux-lts
2016-09-17 19:20:22	Hwkiller	starship_trooper: it's easy. pacman -Syu linux-lts. update your bootloader. reboot and select the lts kernel
2016-09-17 19:20:50	starship_trooper	Trashlord: I know which packages i need to download. I use rEFInd so i cant find much about defing a menuentry

2016-09-17 19:23:13	starship_trooper	Trashlord: I read that. The problem is my $ESP is mounted at /boot/efi and the linux kernel image will be in /boot. So what address do I need to enter?
2016-09-17 19:24:09	Trashlord	starship_trooper: I have no experience with rEFInd. But I guess you should just enter the full path to the image
2016-09-17 19:24:29	Hwkiller	starship_trooper: look at the arch wiki for rEFInd, under configuration
2016-09-17 19:25:06	starship_trooper	refind-mkrlconf should do it I guess, Trashlord Hwkiller
2016-09-17 19:25:24	Trashlord	sure

2016-09-17 19:25:36	starship_trooper	Also i should download linux-lts-headers right?
2016-09-17 19:26:21	Hwkiller	may not need to? only needed if you build kernel drivers I think
2016-09-17 19:26:24	Trashlord	I don't think it's absolutely necessary
2016-09-17 19:26:30	ParkerR	Huh that's weird. Compiled 4.8 from git and tried on my tablet. For some reason my mmc bevices moved uo a number but there's not two devices. It went from mmcblk0pX to mmcblk1pX
2016-09-17 19:26:40	ParkerR	*devices
2016-09-17 19:27:12	sheep	there's probably some sort of race condition happening
2016-09-17 19:27:46	sheep	you shouldn't expect nodes like /dev/mmcblk0pX that depend on some ordering to work since the ordering isn't entirely predictable

2016-09-17 19:47:50	ParkerR	sheep, Suspend/GPIO buttons/Camera (On the I2C bus)/Brightness all have non-support. WiFi has been stable for a while (Despite being Broadcom SDIO...). Touchscreen actually works great but touch response is really lacking (Gnome is very slow with it) Multitouch zoom actually works in Chromium even outside of Gnome. Battery works as of late.

The window that was active at the time where it crashed remains usable via keyboard, but I can't use a mouse. A reboot or a pkill X and startx again solves it for a while.

2016-09-18 00:11:38	\ottizen	Hi everyone. After yesterday's system upgrade (pacman -Syu), I cannot use my computer any longer. The screen resolution seems to have gone *very* low (it's a 4k, 28" screen) and neither the keyboard nor the mouse seem to respond. The keyboard backlight, however, is lit, and keyboard interaction works in the boot loader. Here is a picture of the screen -- what should I do?

2016-09-18 03:48:21	gulzar	I have a doubt. We can/do add few settings like laptop lid close action, screen brightness etc in some files, and then DE also allows use to change these settings via GUI. In my experience DE UI settings are used but in i3 or openbox file settings are used. So do DE UI overtake the settings , is/are there any conflicts ?

2016-09-18 08:13:50	spider-mario	sorry for the useless advice, then
2016-09-18 08:13:57	grawity	maybe someone's custom app launcher does use .desktop files
2016-09-18 08:14:02	ywecur[m]	grawity (IRC): How do you make dmenu run a different command then?
2016-09-18 08:14:03	grawity	like the one I'm about to write
2016-09-18 08:14:06	spider-mario	maybe try the .pam_environment approach, then?
2016-09-18 08:14:19	grawity	ywecur[m]: a) you put ~/bin in $PATH, and make a wrapper script ~/bin/steam or such
2016-09-18 08:14:24	grawity	ywecur[m]: or b) yes, set the env globally.
2016-09-18 08:14:27	grawity	or in your .xinitrc for example
2016-09-18 08:14:29	Earnestly	dmenu_path is used by dmenu_run to generate a list of executables in PATH displayed by dmenu
2016-09-18 08:14:49	ywecur[m]	grawity (IRC): By setting it globally you mean in my .bashrc?
2016-09-18 08:15:04	spider-mario	no, dmenu likely won’t read that either
2016-09-18 08:15:12	grawity	no, I mean .profile or .xinitrc or .pam_environment
2016-09-18 08:15:19	Earnestly	ywecur[m]: Environment variables are configured normally in the shell profile

2016-09-18 09:13:49	deltasquared	[18:54:46] tortib: you can pass -n to remove backup configs when you do a pacman -R [18:54:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	tortib	[18:54:55] k thx [18:54:55]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	deltasquared	[18:55:02] there are also -s and -c for depends and dependents, but be careful with those [18:55:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	deltasquared	[18:55:31] I almost always pacman -Rscn but I scrutinise the output carefully before confirming [18:55:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	tortib	[18:55:46] Error constructing proxy for org.gnome.Terminal:/org/gnome/Terminal/Factory0: The connection is closed [18:55:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Earnestly	[18:55:49] deltasquared: -Rs is enough to reverse -S [18:55:49]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Earnestly	[18:56:05] deltasquared: As the manual syas [18:56:05]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Earnestly	[18:56:08] says* [18:56:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	deltasquared	[18:56:25] Earnestly: I like to see what would be taken out with it as well [18:56:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	zatanas	[18:56:30] anyone here familiar with setting up Sonarr? [18:56:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	deltasquared	[18:56:43] tortib: well. that's not supposed to happen [18:56:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	deltasquared	[18:56:50] do other term emus work? [18:56:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	deltasquared	[18:57:05] I assume yes considering you managed to paste the error [18:57:05]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	tortib	[18:57:07] yeah termite does [18:57:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Earnestly	[18:57:26] deltasquared: Nothing you or I have said does anything to increase or reduce 'see what' [18:57:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	deltasquared	[18:57:36] any particular reason for using gnome-terminal: LXTerminal works good and it integrates with the themes too [18:57:36]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Earnestly	[18:58:00] If you want an overview of what will be changed, enable VerbosePkgLists [18:58:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Quicken2k	[19:01:13] I have the gstreamer0.10-plugins installed and the gst ones but I can't play mp3 why?. What did I miss? [19:01:13]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Earnestly	[19:01:24] lame? [19:01:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Namarrgon	[19:01:55] which player? [19:01:55]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Quicken2k	[19:01:56] No, I have it [19:01:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Earnestly	[19:02:02] That said, gst bad probably covers mpeg [19:02:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	deltasquared	[19:03:51] Earnestly: if mpeg is in bad, what does ugly cover? I shudder to think [19:03:51]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Earnestly	[19:04:08] deltasquared: Ugly revers to code quality [19:04:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Earnestly	[19:04:21] Maybe it's the other way around, I can't remember [19:04:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Earnestly	[19:04:33] One is for shitty licenses/patents, one is for code [19:04:33]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	deltasquared	[19:04:36] Earnestly: huh, I thought it referred to how much of a patent mindfield the covered codecs were [19:04:36]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Earnestly	[19:04:39] Probably bad is for the code one [19:04:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Earnestly	[19:04:59] refers**** [19:04:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	deltasquared	[19:05:00] it'd figure that ugly would be said patent mines :P [19:05:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	deltasquared	[19:05:19] That being said, I wonder how the libre codecs are doing these days [19:05:19]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	deltasquared	[19:05:22] I'm not up to date with those [19:05:22]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Earnestly	[19:05:50] Yeah I'm right, bad = shitty code, ugly = distribution problems [19:05:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	xogium	[19:06:03] opus codec ftw [19:06:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Quicken2k	[19:06:04] Maybe it's just Nightingale not working leme see [19:06:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Earnestly	[19:06:15] deltasquared: opus and ogg beat everything for audio [19:06:15]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Earnestly	[19:06:21] vp9 is a thing [19:06:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	deltasquared	[19:06:37] Earnestly: well I'll always go DL patent encumbered stuff anyway, fuck the police, libdvdcss comes to mind [19:06:37]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Earnestly	[19:06:42] av1 is supposed to be royalty free, and daala still ... is stuff [19:06:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	deltasquared	[19:08:30] Earnestly: what about this Theora thing? I'm staring at a wiki page [19:08:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Earnestly	[19:08:39] It's not as good [19:08:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	BrainDamage	[19:09:10] your best bet is vp8/9 [19:09:10]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	BrainDamage	[19:09:28] which is surprisingly actually supported by a decent set of gpu [19:09:28]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Earnestly	[19:09:42] BrainDamage: The codec alliance or whatever, cisco and co. are going av1 iirc [19:09:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	deltasquared	[19:09:42] I found it interesting that the BBC opened up Dirac, but that's for stupidly high res stuff [19:09:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	deltasquared	[19:10:17] I have a question, is video decode parellisable enough to be run on GPGPU compute without tailored decoder silicon? [19:10:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	deltasquared	[19:10:28] I guess it depends on the codecs [19:10:28]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Quicken2k	[19:10:36] Yeah, just Nightingale issue [19:10:36]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	BrainDamage	[19:10:47] generally they are intentionally designed so that they are [19:10:47]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	deltasquared	[19:10:51] IIRC VP8 had stages that could only be run in a strictly serial manner [19:10:51]

(c) most gui applications/moving gui applications around the screen with mouse seem to cause buzzing. mpd for some reason does not buzz.

2016-09-18 13:24:35	NapoleonWils0n	[22:24:34] so it cats a text file with a video url [22:24:34]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Earnestly	[22:24:52] I know why you're doing this [22:24:52]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	NapoleonWils0n	[22:25:23] make sense [22:25:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	NapoleonWils0n	[22:26:02] thanks for the feedback will take it all onboard [22:26:02]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Earnestly	[22:26:49] NapoleonWils0n: Please, see bashguide and try to get assistence from #bash.  Just because something appears to work in a limited, fairly controlled environment, doesn't make it good, maintainable or understandable [22:26:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Earnestly	[22:27:07] But then again, maybe you can understand what this stuff does months down the road, I couldn't [22:27:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	TrentP	[22:27:33] trying to figure out how to get ip addr on Linode using systemd-networkd without dhcpcd.service [22:27:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	NapoleonWils0n	[22:27:51] it actually makes perfect sense to me, my brain must be wired up differently [22:27:51]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	NapoleonWils0n	[22:28:04] shellcheck looks great [22:28:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	NapoleonWils0n	[22:28:19] will give it a whirl [22:28:19]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Earnestly	[22:39:42] teraflops: (Idk why he didn't make ffmpeg stuff a function with the common options including error handling, and just calling that function with the additional arguments) [22:39:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	grawity	[22:40:14] TrentP: conveniently, Linode's "Network Helper" generates a systemd-networkd config for you [22:40:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	teraflops	[22:41:23] Earnestly: to be honest I tried to understand those scripts time ago I even had real troubles to get them running  [22:41:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Earnestly	[22:42:03] teraflops: Yeah, I've tried to hold my tongue on it.  He seems so enthusiastic, I wish he'd just advance beyond expert beginner [22:42:03]

2016-09-18 13:24:35	Earnestly	[22:45:35] a lot* [22:45:35]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	teraflops	[22:52:46] oh expert beginner is a dead end [22:52:46]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	TrentP	[22:53:49] grawity: yeah, turns out I just forgot about simply describing eth0 in /etc/systemd/network/*network file..............works fine now with dhcpcd not enabled [22:53:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Enverex	[22:54:12] Is there a proper command line program for Bluetooth? bluetoothctl doesn't seem particually well thought out as you can't pass it commands, you have to hackily echo commands in to it and it doesn't seem to handle issues or errors at all, just claims things worked even if they didn't. [22:54:12]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	 *	Earnestly [22:54:20] was confused by how linode was involved [22:54:20]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Earnestly	[22:54:50] Enverex: "Everything is fine"? :P [22:54:50]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Enverex	[22:55:39] It just seems like such a crap piece of software. I have no idea how it became the core of Bluetooth, especially as it seems like a step back. [22:55:39]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Enverex	[22:56:17] If I run the same commands again later, it connects. Thing is, it should have connected the first time, but gives no errors or reasons why it didn't work. [22:56:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	TrentP	[22:56:43] Earnestly: because the default configuration on Linode has both dhcpcd and systemd-networkd enabled [22:56:43]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Earnestly	[22:57:04] TrentP: Odd [22:57:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	teraflops	[22:57:27] Enverex: oh I guess is bluetooth fault not bluez5 itself [22:57:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Earnestly	[22:57:55] Enverex: It looks like bluetoothctl is a repl [22:57:55]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	Enverex	[22:57:55] teraflops: Maybe. It's a major pain either way. [22:57:55]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	teraflops	[22:58:03] sure [22:58:03]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	TrentP	[22:58:23] Earnestly: which apparently is not the ideal set up when you want to play with systemd-nspawn containers? [22:58:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	Earnestly	[22:58:54] TrentP: Well two dhcp 'cd's doesn't really make sense at all unless they're running on difference interfaces [22:58:54]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	Earnestly	[22:59:08] You'd get racy conflicts or so [22:59:08]

2016-09-18 23:17:41	Sapphirus	This way, you can use PCI-E passthrough to practically pass the same network adapter, into multiple virtual machines, while keeping the real one available to the host.

2016-09-19 01:16:31	Bluewind	also that's about NOPL emulation which that particular cpu requires if you run i686
2016-09-19 01:16:52	Bluewind	if you have a real i686 cpu NOPL is supported and doesn't need to be emulated
2016-09-19 01:17:17	Bluewind	I think the emulation actually works by trapping the illegal instruction signal and then doing a simple NOP

2016-09-19 02:43:52	teraflops	[12:17:28] neovim! [12:17:28]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	kosan|laptop	[12:17:37] But wouldn't that cause more than just my music to mute teraflops ? [12:17:37]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	BrainDamage	[12:17:38] nvim makes vim obsolete [12:17:38]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	teraflops	[12:17:47] kosan|laptop: why? [12:17:47]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	kosan|laptop	[12:17:53] Also having issues with nvim plugins, but I'll figure that one out myself :p [12:17:53]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	Boobuigi	[12:18:12] BrainDamage: How so? [12:18:12]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	BrainDamage	[12:18:34] has all the features vim has, even before vim got them [12:18:34]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	BrainDamage	[12:18:43] and has a sane(r) arch [12:18:43]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	teraflops	[12:18:53] kosan|laptop: take a look at pavucontrol to check if your playback is using alsa or pulseaudio [12:18:53]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	Boobuigi	[12:19:03] So neovim makes vim obsolete by being the same thing? [12:19:03]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	BrainDamage	[12:19:16] no, by having more features [12:19:16]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	teraflops	[12:19:40] and being saner not a culsterfuck [12:19:40]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	BrainDamage	[12:20:05] as i said for the audio, it's likely the module role cork [12:20:05]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	BrainDamage	[12:20:17] high prio streams will mute multimedia ones [12:20:17]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	kosan|laptop	[12:20:44] Huh. So that would just be in the default.pa settings then? [12:20:44]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	BrainDamage	[12:20:57] yes [12:20:57]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	kosan|laptop	[12:20:58] Last time I had full-system audio, I did it all through ALSA, so PA is a bit new to me. [12:20:58]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	BrainDamage	[12:21:35] role cork is like flat volumes, a stupid "feature" that gets in the way and it's quite unintuitive [12:21:35]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	BrainDamage	[12:21:46] and i have no idea why it's default [12:21:46]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	Lartza	[12:21:52] Just disable cork yeah it causes issues with Mumble etc too [12:21:52]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	kosan|laptop	[12:21:57] Kinda like Windows 'incoming call' feature -.- [12:21:57]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	Lartza	[12:21:59] And I see no problems without it [12:21:59]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	kosan|laptop	[12:23:10] BrainDamage: You are a huge lifesaver. Answers like this need to be higher on the google results -.- [12:23:10]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	Boobuigi	[12:23:25] BrainDamage: The only feature I see neovim touting over vim is a built-in terminal emulator.  Everything else amounts to "the code is purrrdy." [12:23:25]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	kosan|laptop	[12:23:31] Now to figure out why YCM won't handle Rust auto-completion like it's supposed to >.> [12:23:31]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	kosan|laptop	[12:23:55] Boobuigi: It had concurency before vim, and from what I've hard, arguably better implemented. [12:23:55]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	Namarrgon	[12:25:26] dump your vims, emacs 25.1 is out [12:25:26]
2016-09-19 02:43:52	teraflops	[12:26:12] !glare [12:26:12]

2016-09-19 02:43:53	Boobuigi	[12:27:04] Hehe.  Both in the same week.  The New York Times should have made a headline about it. [12:27:04]
2016-09-19 02:43:53	teraflops	[12:27:46] oh to be honest idk if I have role cork module unloaded [12:27:46]

So I've tested out a few more things and here is what is known so far: (a) Main pair of headphones in computer's 3.5mm port buzz, spare headphones in 3.5mm port do not buzz, usb headset does not buzz. (b) Main (buzzing) headphones do not buzz when connected to other sound sources (c) booted up in linux mint livecd, buzzing headphones did not buzz
2016-09-19 09:58:04	\z\z\z	on the livecd (d) completely dissabling pulseaudio and running only alsa does not seem to effect buzzing any noticable amount (e) previously jiggling cable inside the pc's 3.5mm port change intensity of the buzzing. (f) buzzing did not change depending on what cable i plugged main headphones in with (g) some applications that buzz: urxvt, firefox, ioquake3 [worst], etc. shaking windows with mouse also

2016-09-20 06:35:02	d_garbage	or perhaps update your list whenever a new mirrorlist comes out if your mirrors tend to change where you are

2016-09-20 06:36:51	Earnestly	There's nothing inherently bad about enabling a bunch of mirrors that act as fallbacks if one fails.  The main issue is that not all mirrors are synchronised with each other all the time
2016-09-20 06:37:17	d_garbage	yeah, so if the first mirror is crap it gets used anyway as long as it is contactable

Basically, if your newly built package depends on libc version 6 but the rest of the software depends on version 5, it'll pull in version 6, removing version 5, but all other software that hasn't been updated still depends on version 5, so that cannot run anymore.

2016-09-20 15:26:42	phrik	When it's ready.
2016-09-20 15:27:02	Girafferson	I'm gonna have to say that it's only an issue with mech keyboards. It normally happens 1-2 times a sentence but haven't had it happen with this keyboard yet
2016-09-20 15:27:04	notadrop	makes sense
2016-09-20 15:27:35	notadrop	Firefox is normally in extra, not core. So I'm assuming the devs think there's a chance the update will break something...?

2016-09-20 19:13:38	sheep	in that case, each user should have their own VM

2016-09-20 20:21:43	steelcowboy	I have a weird issue. For some reason when Arch boots the text stays big like the "Starting version ..." message, and then it goes on to automatically log me in to the virtual console and tries to start X and fails

2016-09-20 21:17:01	notadrop	parabola is arch with non-free packages removed, but yes
2016-09-20 21:17:03	ngkaho1234	dont do this... you may risk borking your os

2016-09-20 21:17:24	notadrop	and if I do, whatever.

2016-09-21 06:54:33	grazzolini	ZnarqXrant: like every machine has a serial port, right?
2016-09-21 06:54:55	Tazmain	MacGyver, as I said direct hdmi to hdmi works. , and on another pc the hdmi to vga works. 
2016-09-21 06:54:56	grazzolini	Tazmain: first of all, try booting without quiet and vga=normal
2016-09-21 06:54:59	MacGyver	Tazmain: in my experience, graphics cards can be finnicky about which outputs they actually output their initial console on.

2016-09-21 06:57:35	MacGyver	Since the HDMI signal is digital, and the VGA signal is analog, the card doesn't really have anything to do with what ends up at the VGA end.
2016-09-21 06:57:42	MacGyver	It's the adapter.

2016-09-21 06:59:19	MacGyver	But to do that, a passive adapter draws power from the card whereas an active adapter is externally powered, is the distinction I know.

2016-09-21 10:15:02	Earnestly	d_garbage: At least that's what it means in the context of mankind, to my mind
2016-09-21 10:15:03	grazzolini	Hi-Angel: asp is you the AUR
2016-09-21 10:15:15	grazzolini	Hi-Angel: and it is preferable of abs.
2016-09-21 10:15:22	Hi-Angel	why?
2016-09-21 10:15:29	oneau_	I tried instead journalctl -b -o verbose and that gave me a lot (although a lot of noise obviously since I am unable to filter only on the btkd.service for some reason)
2016-09-21 10:15:40	grazzolini	Hi-Angel: speed, space, git, take your pick
2016-09-21 10:15:58	SolidSaltySwan	opposite issue sometimes, d_garbage. Forget I'm wearing headphones. Hear weird noises from a stream or video and think it's coming from my apartment somewhere

2016-09-21 10:16:53	grazzolini	Hi-Angel: don't mix abs the tool with abs - arch build system
2016-09-21 10:16:55	Smasher816	alright, so I have an arch linux server at home running multiple things (nginx,plex,openvpn,etc). Some services are accessable from the outside world, but others are not. ssh and openvpn work, http{,s} does not. All relavent ports have been opened on the router (I've even tried DMZing it). Disabling ufw does not help. If I connect with openvpn than I am able to access the webpage via the local ip address, so nginx is working
2016-09-21 10:16:56	oneau_	Hmm I could be wrong but this looks suspicous... btkd.service "Cant get device info: No such device" and then a few ms later: "Bluetooth: HCI device and connection manager initialized" - I would guess btkd.service needs to run *after* that has been initialized?

2016-09-21 10:26:18	Elv1313	poisonby: Ok, to really answer your question. The Awesome core cannot be ported to Wayland, just as all the other WMs. It need a new C core, probably based on WLC, the basis of sway and most other Wayland WM.

2016-09-21 10:29:31	Earnestly	BrainDamage: Xmonad is a good example iirc, since most of the code is just xlib bindings
2016-09-21 10:29:31		[10:29]
2016-09-21 10:29:32	Elv1313	BrainDamage: it is not really the same situation. Awesome is a 2 layer project. It has a C core that expose a WM API to a lua layer. The C part has to go and be rewritten from scratch. However, if the WM API is exposed on top of the new core, it will "just work". Aweosme has very good APIs, tons of unit tests and many users with custom code
2016-09-21 10:29:39	Earnestly	BrainDamage: xmonad itself is like 200 lines of code
2016-09-21 10:29:48	Elv1313	The LUA APIs are not tied to X
2016-09-21 10:29:50	lilleman	It seems my problem with two finger scrolling and two finger right click is due to Librem touchpad does not support it? When I list-props it says only edge scrolling is available. I guess this is a kernel issue?
