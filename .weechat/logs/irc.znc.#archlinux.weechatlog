2016-09-15 22:10:53	TheAnachron	how can you compare a tool like systemd which grows and replaces a lot of other tools with other tools when its one of a kind? There are not a lot of other libraries which grow in this rate
2016-09-15 22:11:04	MrElendig	eg stringing together 40 binaries using bash script and fragile string parsing/manipulation is anything but KISS
2016-09-15 22:11:19	MrElendig	but at the same time people claim that sysvinit is KISS and systemd is horrible

2016-09-16 08:27:54	MrNeon	Gaffel, the routers answers to DNS but I'm using Google's DNS with "server=8.8.8.8" on dnsmasq.conf, I thought that "server=//192.168.1.1" would redirect dotless domains to the router.
2016-09-16 08:28:11	MacGyver	It should.
2016-09-16 08:28:23	Gaffel	If your router responds, use it as your DNS
2016-09-16 08:28:38	Gaffel	If your router can't resolve it, it will forward the lookup.
2016-09-16 08:28:57	MrNeon	It will answer to some domains with a legal notice.
2016-09-16 08:29:07	MacGyver	Gaffel: Except forwarding the lookup is exactly what he doesn't want to do because the router will forward to the ISP's DNS server, not Google's.
2016-09-16 08:29:11	sypher	MrNeon: You have a fundamental misunderstanding of how DNS works. You need to pass a DNS domain/DNS suffix to your clients through DHCP, and use the router for ALL DNS lookups. Configure the router to forward to your desired DNS host.
2016-09-16 08:29:24	MacGyver	MrNeon: I take it the router isn't configurable to ignore your ISP's DHCP-provided DNS server?
2016-09-16 08:29:37	MacGyver	sypher: No, he does not.
2016-09-16 08:29:38	Gaffel	Can't you specify forwarderes manually in your router?
2016-09-16 08:29:41	MrNeon	It's an ISP router, I can't touch anything pretty much.
2016-09-16 08:30:02	Gaffel	I see
2016-09-16 08:30:19	MacGyver	He's configuring the *local* resolver to distinguish between qualified domainnames and local names. Local names go to server A, qualified names to server B.
2016-09-16 08:30:28	grazzolini	MrNeon: why not skip your router altogether?
2016-09-16 08:30:33	MacGyver	This should work fine, and usually does, and is supported by dnsmasq.
2016-09-16 08:30:48	Gaffel	So, a local DNS on the machine that splits the resolving into stub zones.
2016-09-16 08:30:49	MacGyver	grazzolini: Local DHCP-based DNS lookups a la dyndns.

What this does is forwards all client traffic through the vpn, so if I connect to 8.8.8.8 from my client, it first goes through the vpn server and then to 8.8.8.8.

2016-09-16 12:05:37	teprrr	I'm using snat for my tinc network. my router is translating source to its tinc addr, which is static. masquerade is very useful when you are on a dial-up or so with changing IP
2016-09-16 12:05:54	DarkFeather	Boohbah: it downgrades, as shown in the paste. I ran pacman -U <opensmtpd tar>. That version is ahead of mirrors. I want to be able to run some operation in pacman that will not touch packages ahead of the mirror and only touch those behind. You're telling me that's not possible. Understood.
2016-09-16 12:05:59	PragmaticAnarchy	hello, i need some help with telepathy for lastest plasma 5, it let me config the google account but when i go to the icon on the task bar it says i have no account configured. When i open the account manager google is there.
2016-09-16 12:06:13	eris	Fucking hell.  Idiots.
2016-09-16 12:06:25	alyptik	teprrr: i messed with it a bit when i had ddwrt still, now i have asuswrt so haven't touched it in a while
2016-09-16 12:06:53	Boohbah	DarkFeather: Read again what -U does.
2016-09-16 12:07:09	eris	DarkFeather: You fucking told pacman to install the newest version of the package, that's the polar fucking oposite of "running some operation in pacman that will not touch packages ahead of the mirror".
2016-09-16 12:07:30	eris	So stop running `-Su opensmtpd`.
2016-09-16 12:07:36	eris	When that's clearly not what  you want.
2016-09-16 12:07:37	DarkFeather	OK
2016-09-16 12:07:46	teprrr	alyptik: yup. I'm always somehow mistaking those too, haven't configured them often enough :)
