2016-09-15 19:35:24	jflory7	[19:33:32] tlamer: I'm going to Boston for MIT's annual hackathon as a Fedora Ambassador. I don't know how much time I will have to explore, but it will be my first time in Boston.
2016-09-15 19:35:24	tlamer	[19:34:33] jflory7: Yeah I'm using fedora on my work computer... I work at Red Hat so at work with RHEL and on my girlfriends computer I've installed Debian few weeks ago... :D

2016-09-15 19:37:53	tlamer	jflory7: So you're Fedora Ambassador? How can one become an ambassador?
2016-09-15 19:38:26	jflory7	tlamer: What region of the world are you in?
2016-09-15 19:38:57	tlamer	jflory7: right now Slovakia, but I work and live in Czech Republic

2016-09-15 19:39:26	jflory7	tlamer: I still need to give Arch a spin. A lot of people in my LUG are big fans, but I've just never had much time to get around to playing with it myself. I hang out here anyways because I enjoy the community. :)
2016-09-15 19:39:50	jflory7	tlamer: Ah, okay! So, this might be a little off-topic for this channel, but if you want to hop in #fedora-ambassadors, I'd be happy to give you the quick rundown :)

2016-09-16 10:42:33	@fsckd	what is a cantenna?
2016-09-16 10:42:48	+meskarune	to make one I'd need a tall can that is about 3 inches across and a usb wifi dongle
2016-09-16 10:43:21	+meskarune	a cantenna increases the distrance you can connect to wifi networks
2016-09-16 10:43:44	+meskarune	with a large antenna you can connect to places like 1/2 mile away or longer depending
2016-09-16 10:43:55	@fsckd	sweet
2016-09-16 10:43:59	Mikaela	Are they legal?
2016-09-16 10:44:35	ng0	there are antennas which can go several kilometers if no interferences are in the way.
2016-09-16 10:44:52	ng0	legal of course :)
2016-09-16 10:47:56	+meskarune	fsckd: cantenna's are just the diy version that is cheap to make
2016-09-16 10:48:04	+meskarune	you just need a usb dongle and a can
2016-09-16 10:48:30	@fsckd	ahh, like a usb wifi adapter?

2016-09-18 09:13:49	MrElendig	[16:57:07] *if* it is true it should be handled trough the legal ways, not going on a shittrowing fest and naming people with no proof given [16:57:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	MrElendig	[17:00:58] it just adds fuel for the other side and turns the whole thing into a troll/flamefest instead of the possibility of a constructive discussion around the problem [17:00:58]

2016-09-18 09:32:13	+tigrmesh	i bet the last bit is my identifier
2016-09-18 09:37:10	turbo64	i never really liked sites like codecademy
2016-09-18 09:37:10		[09:37]
2016-09-18 09:37:39	turbo64	i think you're better off just going out and getting a book on whatever language you want to learn
2016-09-18 09:43:00		[09:37]
2016-09-18 09:45:49	turbo64	the most valuable learning experience is just messing around with stuff and sites like codecademy don't let you do that, you're just answering a series of quiz questions
2016-09-18 09:51:00		[09:45]
2016-09-18 09:51:32	halosghost	imho, finding a knowledgeable mentor who can help you learn is irreplaceable
2016-09-18 09:51:51	turbo64	yeah thats true
2016-09-18 09:51:58	turbo64	if you can afford going to college then thats the best option
2016-09-18 09:52:08	halosghost	I don't know that I would agree with that
2016-09-18 09:52:19	turbo64	otherwise the only affirmation you have that you did something right is that the code compiled and ran correctly
2016-09-18 09:52:21	halosghost	most collegiate comp-sci programs appear to be woefully inadequate
2016-09-18 09:53:10	turbo64	i only know from my own experience
2016-09-18 09:54:02	turbo64	ive taken a bunch of programming classes and had the same teacher in most of them, and she is quite competent and was a programmer for ibm for like 20 years
2016-09-18 09:54:39	turbo64	i had some bad ones too though, who just gave you A if your code compiled without errors
2016-09-18 09:55:01	turbo64	and didnt actually read through it and point out any dumb things you did that would lead to catastrophic failure later on
2016-09-18 09:55:30	+meskarune	I can't really learn that well from books, so I'd rather have step by step excersizes or a project to work on and reading man pages/documentaton
2016-09-18 09:55:41	+meskarune	or learn in a class with a group
2016-09-18 09:57:01	+meskarune	tigrmesh: I haven't heard of sololearn, good to know about more options
2016-09-18 09:57:05	turbo64	group assignments are ok if everyone in the group cares about what theyre doing
2016-09-18 09:57:58	turbo64	but usually the people in my group were just slackers who wanted someone else to do all the work for them and didn't care about actually learning anything
2016-09-18 09:58:04	spider-mario	meskarune: isn’t that what a good book would be like?
2016-09-18 09:58:37	+meskarune	idk, I've never read a programming book that I didn't get bored with quickly
2016-09-18 09:59:27	turbo64	if you don't like reading a lot of boring text then programming probably isn't for you

2016-09-18 10:13:02	halosghost	reading lots of code for understanding isn't the same thing as reading really try text that's trying to describe code
2016-09-18 10:16:37	halosghost	s/try/dry/
2016-09-18 10:16:41	@fsckd	a wet book is kind of hard to use. the pages all stick together and tear easily.
2016-09-18 10:16:52	halosghost	heh
2016-09-18 10:17:55	turbo64	i mean there are books that try to make it "fun" like heads first java, but i find that extremely annoying
2016-09-18 10:17:56	+meskarune	turbo64: I program just fine lol
2016-09-18 10:18:10	+meskarune	so obviously programming is for me
2016-09-18 10:18:48	+meskarune	I like reading other people's code and reading man pages and documentation for code, and writing small projects to learn
2016-09-18 10:19:17	@fsckd	meskarune: what gets you bored of programming books?
2016-09-18 10:19:26	+meskarune	I'd rather learn by reading through someone's github project history I guess, or by writing things and ifguring it out on the fly
2016-09-18 10:19:31	+tigrmesh	i've only every learned languages in classes.  the book is for reference
2016-09-18 10:20:46	+meskarune	fsckd: I think just how wordy they are. often I just need like one line of info. "how do I use a list" and an example of ways to use a list. Not long descriptions of lists and every single use case and feature of them
2016-09-18 10:21:14	+meskarune	sorta like how a man page just gives flags, a short description for what tehy do and some examples
2016-09-18 10:21:20	+meskarune	and then I can use that to do things
2016-09-18 10:21:27	@fsckd	meskarune: i guess you prefer reference books rather than books which teach a concept?
2016-09-18 10:21:35	turbo64	when i started programming, i learned everything from reading moldy old books from my local library and messing around with qbasic and turbo pascal and turbo c++
2016-09-18 10:22:01	+meskarune	fsckd: yeah, I would say thats probably right. I also like reading dictionaries when learning a lang vs. reading a book about a language
2016-09-18 10:22:01		[10:22]
2016-09-18 10:22:18	turbo64	i couldnt ask for help on the internet or look at anyone else's source code
2016-09-18 10:23:01	@fsckd	turbo64: i sort of went your direction
2016-09-18 10:23:03	turbo64	the books are just the starting point to learn the fundamentals
2016-09-18 10:23:26	turbo64	then the real learning is just practice and solving the problems you run into when writing your projects
2016-09-18 10:23:49	+meskarune	turbo64: the point is that everyone learns in different ways :P
2016-09-18 10:24:06	+meskarune	there is no one good / best way to learn how to program
2016-09-18 10:24:30	+meskarune	like the reason I often ask people to look at their code is so I can learn
2016-09-18 10:24:57	@fsckd	i learn best by playing around with the concepts in my mind
2016-09-18 10:24:58	@fsckd	<- math person
2016-09-18 10:25:32	halosghost	I will say there's a lot of benefit in learning the fundamentals; having a solid foundation tends to radically improve code quality
2016-09-18 10:25:45	halosghost	but how you learn the fundamentals can be very different person-to-person
2016-09-18 10:26:00	@fsckd	so i can learn without a computer, as long as i have good books to guide me :)

2016-09-18 10:26:36	turbo64	ive found the best tutorials are the ones that explain how to do a certain thing, like say, a tutorial on writing a card game or something
2016-09-18 10:27:08	turbo64	as opposed to just tutorials that tell you how to write hello world and tell you how to make an array, etc.
2016-09-18 10:27:16	+meskarune	I get bored by that lol
2016-09-18 10:27:30	+meskarune	I just want all the code at once so I can change it and play with it and  see what happens
2016-09-18 10:27:50	+meskarune	I don't want to read about the steps someone took to make something

2016-09-18 10:28:04	+meskarune	but I also like to take apart electronics to see how they work
2016-09-18 10:28:17	+meskarune	and then put them back together or take the pieces and make new things
2016-09-18 10:29:37	+meskarune	I like reading manuals for stuff like motorcycle engines or convection ovens
2016-09-18 10:30:04	+meskarune	they are concise, tell you what you need, and then you can play with the thing in question
2016-09-18 10:31:39	turbo64	over the years ive become kind of against the whole idea of high level "learning languages"
2016-09-18 10:32:06	halosghost	turbo64: ?

2016-09-18 10:33:25	halosghost	I can't really recommend python for anything
2016-09-18 10:33:29	@fsckd	meskarune: you'll probably find assembly very easy to get into. get tables of opcodes and manuals from Intel and grab examples.
2016-09-18 10:33:32	turbo64	but i think you would be better off just learning c++
2016-09-18 10:33:45	halosghost	turbo64: well that makes no sense to me, but okay :)
2016-09-18 10:33:59	halosghost	meskarune: actually x64 ASM is pretty simple
2016-09-18 10:36:42	turbo64	when you start off learning some "easy" language, you end up being frustrated and disillusioned by languages that don't hold your hand and prevent you from doing dumb things

2016-09-18 10:38:27	turbo64	well programming languages arent ice cream flavors
2016-09-18 10:39:14	halosghost	sure they are
2016-09-18 10:39:25	turbo64	you don't pick one based on your personal preference, you choose one that is widely used and will have the most practical application
2016-09-18 10:39:50	turbo64	unless you are just interested in programming theory
2016-09-18 10:39:50	halosghost	turbo64: even if that were true; it wouldn't lead you to pick C++ :)
2016-09-18 10:40:26	turbo64	most applications are still written in c++
2016-09-18 10:40:34	halosghost	that's wildly inaccurate
2016-09-18 10:41:02	turbo64	at least on the desktop
2016-09-18 10:41:17	halosghost	if, by desktop, you mean “Windows”, then sure
2016-09-18 10:41:46	halosghost	though still, not really
2016-09-18 10:43:20	spider-mario	I like C++

2016-09-18 10:47:20	halosghost	fsckd: I suppose my affinity for C and Haskell/Agda probably push me over the line

2016-09-18 10:50:50	turbo64	and if you want to write desktop applications and work with other people on writing applications, then c++ would be a good language to learn
2016-09-18 10:51:14	@fsckd	Best tool for the job.
2016-09-18 10:51:18	spider-mario	GNOME even created Vala so that they wouldn’t have to write their apps in C anymore

2016-09-18 11:13:05	+meskarune	sounds like learning it on a few cpu types would be really interesting
2016-09-18 11:13:23	halosghost	probably :)
2016-09-18 11:13:34	halosghost	I'm planning to get my feet wet in ARM asm pretty soon here

2016-09-18 11:16:49	spider-mario	I’m kind of sad about that, actually
2016-09-18 11:16:50	+meskarune	its already happening in large warehouses
2016-09-18 11:16:52	spider-mario	I enjoy driving
2016-09-18 11:17:08	+meskarune	I can't drive, so I would love to have a car that could drive me when I wanted

2016-09-18 11:18:29	+meskarune	I mean, you could do that, but then you get just other bills :P
2016-09-18 11:19:38	halosghost	cheaper ones though
2016-09-18 11:20:04	+meskarune	idk, public transit and taxi's can still be pretty expensive :(
2016-09-18 11:20:10	halosghost	meskarune: I know
2016-09-18 11:20:39	halosghost	but if you factor in gas, tax on the plates and insurance, for me, uber might actually be cheaper overall
2016-09-18 11:21:16	spider-mario	tax on the plates?
2016-09-18 11:21:27	+meskarune	you could try it for a month and see as an experiment halosghost

2016-09-18 11:22:06	halosghost	sudokode: oh?
2016-09-18 11:22:12	+meskarune	I think the main downside is time. It takes way more time to use public transit and street cars
2016-09-18 11:22:15	sudokode	you just don't get to pick where we go
2016-09-18 11:22:23	halosghost	ahh

2016-09-18 11:23:45	halosghost	if so, I'd seriously consider it
2016-09-18 11:23:59	sudokode	are you good at sealing boxes or driving a forklift?
2016-09-18 11:24:03	sudokode	they have lots of those jobs
2016-09-18 11:24:13	halosghost	I mean, maybe; but I'm not terribly interested in that
2016-09-18 11:24:23	sudokode	really though, can you count and/or read? because our warehouse staff is not the best
2016-09-18 11:24:40	sudokode	I dunno if we have any desk jobs available now though
2016-09-18 11:25:06	halosghost	mm
2016-09-18 11:25:13	spider-mario	here, what’s expensive is the parking spot more than the taxes
2016-09-18 11:25:20	sudokode	though unless you have experience, I think it's $9 an hour starting out
2016-09-18 11:25:26	sudokode	not optimal even around here
2016-09-18 11:28:07	halosghost	spider-mario: luckily, I don't need to deal with that, but that can be a huge problem for other places
2016-09-18 11:28:07		[11:28]
2016-09-18 11:28:08	sudokode	spider-mario: only places with meters around here are where the tourists park
2016-09-18 11:29:36	spider-mario	here, you can park as much as you want in the “blue zones” of your postcode as long as you have a Parkkarte, which costs approximately $300/year
2016-09-18 11:29:43	spider-mario	but it can be very hard to find a spot
2016-09-18 11:30:22	spider-mario	I intend to start renting a private spot soon because I am afraid of leaving my current blue one

2016-09-18 11:32:47	sudokode	what happens if you park in the white zones?
2016-09-18 11:32:54	spider-mario	when I say that I am fear leaving the spot on which my car is currently parked, I mean because it will be taken when I get back :p
2016-09-18 11:32:55	sudokode	or do they not model the parking after the coat of arms?

2016-09-18 12:51:21	halosghost	there are far simpler ones than the templating engines in Ruby et al

2016-09-20 15:18:19	APNG	hi libbies 
2016-09-20 15:18:36	halosghost	APNG: I still use firefox, so my browser still supports you
2016-09-20 15:19:00	halosghost	I know the PNG made MNG, but I've always preferred you since you have a lot of really handy things
2016-09-20 15:19:06	halosghost	not gonna lie though, FLIF is awesome

2016-09-20 15:20:02	APNG	hi halosghost 
2016-09-20 15:20:08	APNG	tbh FLIF sucks
2016-09-20 15:20:30	halosghost	APNG: How Dare You‽
2016-09-20 15:20:38	APNG	did you know FLIF *sucks* for animating spritesheets? especially when different parts of the image have different loop points
2016-09-20 15:20:48	halosghost	¯\ʕ·ᴥ·ʔ/¯
2016-09-20 15:20:54	APNG	(e.g. one half loops every 5 seconds and the other half loops every 7 seconds)
2016-09-20 15:21:14	libbies	o_o
2016-09-20 15:21:15	APNG	(you actually have to store enough frames for mmc(5,7) seconds)
2016-09-20 15:21:22	APNG	uh
2016-09-20 15:21:24	APNG	not mmc

2016-09-20 15:23:25	APNG	I can literally point out at least one flaw in every single image and/or video format in existence or in development
2016-09-20 15:23:37	halosghost	APNG: Daala?
2016-09-20 15:24:14	halosghost	(other than that it's not really a format anymore, but rather ta test bed)
2016-09-20 15:24:45	APNG	halosghost, uh yeah sure, how do you store a static image with that?
2016-09-20 15:25:23	APNG	also, it doesn't seem to support coroutines...
2016-09-20 15:25:57	halosghost	you said “and/or video format”
2016-09-20 15:26:23	APNG	yeah I know I was being silly :P but the previous formats you mentioned were all image formats
2016-09-20 15:26:28	APNG	except mng
2016-09-20 15:26:29	halosghost	indeed
2016-09-20 15:26:31	halosghost	well
2016-09-20 15:26:33	APNG	which's a beast format
2016-09-20 15:26:35	halosghost	hehe
2016-09-20 15:26:57	APNG	I think mng does support coroutines tho
2016-09-20 15:27:11	APNG	just maybe
2016-09-20 15:28:55	APNG	yeah uh sorta
2016-09-20 15:29:08	APNG	god mng is worse than I thought O_O
2016-09-20 15:29:43	APNG	instead of putting whole MNGs inside MNGs, they decided to literally add ints everywhere specifying nesting
2016-09-20 15:29:51	APNG	I just... why ;_;
2016-09-20 15:30:28	APNG	but yes, it seems to support coroutines/animated spritesheets quite nicely
2016-09-20 15:33:20	APNG	uh
2016-09-20 15:33:20		[15:33]
2016-09-20 15:33:28	APNG	the MNG spec is not very clear on interpolation
2016-09-20 15:33:41	APNG	which's something FLIF does support
2016-09-20 15:36:00	halosghost	I just love FLIF's quality and progressiveness for its file size
2016-09-20 15:36:08	halosghost	the animation is a kicker benefit
2016-09-20 15:38:14	APNG	but it sucks for spritesheets
2016-09-20 15:38:25	APNG	I can find flaws in everything :/
2016-09-20 15:38:48	halosghost	nothing can be perfect for all use cases
2016-09-20 15:44:00		[15:38]
2016-09-20 15:53:05	APNG	but uh as I was asking how can I numb myself for the week? :/
2016-09-20 15:57:35	libbies	avoidance coping is a maladaptive coping mechanism, and probably shouldn't be used in the long term :/
2016-09-20 15:59:35	APNG	it's probably better than raging at bi ppl for invalidating me
2016-09-20 15:59:35		[15:59]
2016-09-20 16:00:08	APNG	altho that might get them to block me so that's good I guess
2016-09-20 16:06:00		[16:00]
2016-09-20 16:09:59	APNG	also have I mentioned that ppl can be 0% male 0% female and 100% something else?
2016-09-20 16:10:05	APNG	well now I have

2016-09-20 18:53:15	halosghost	[01:26:29] indeed [01:26:29]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	halosghost	[01:26:31] well [01:26:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:26:33] which's a beast format [01:26:33]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	halosghost	[01:26:35] hehe [01:26:35]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:26:57] I think mng does support coroutines tho [01:26:57]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:27:11] just maybe [01:27:11]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:28:55] yeah uh sorta [01:28:55]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:29:08] god mng is worse than I thought O_O [01:29:08]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:29:43] instead of putting whole MNGs inside MNGs, they decided to literally add ints everywhere specifying nesting [01:29:43]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:29:51] I just... why ;_; [01:29:51]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:30:28] but yes, it seems to support coroutines/animated spritesheets quite nicely [01:30:28]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:33:20] uh [01:33:20]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:33:28] the MNG spec is not very clear on interpolation [01:33:28]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:33:41] which's something FLIF does support [01:33:41]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	halosghost	[01:36:00] I just love FLIF's quality and progressiveness for its file size [01:36:00]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	halosghost	[01:36:08] the animation is a kicker benefit [01:36:08]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:38:14] but it sucks for spritesheets [01:38:14]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:38:25] I can find flaws in everything :/ [01:38:25]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	halosghost	[01:38:48] nothing can be perfect for all use cases [01:38:48]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:53:04] but uh as I was asking how can I numb myself for the week? :/ [01:53:04]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	libbies	[01:57:35] avoidance coping is a maladaptive coping mechanism, and probably shouldn't be used in the long term :/ [01:57:35]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:59:35] it's probably better than raging at bi ppl for invalidating me [01:59:35]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[02:00:08] altho that might get them to block me so that's good I guess [02:00:08]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[02:09:59] also have I mentioned that ppl can be 0% male 0% female and 100% something else? [02:09:59]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[02:10:05] well now I have [02:10:05]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[02:10:21] good night o/ [02:10:21]
