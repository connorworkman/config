2016-09-15 19:35:24	jflory7	[19:33:32] tlamer: I'm going to Boston for MIT's annual hackathon as a Fedora Ambassador. I don't know how much time I will have to explore, but it will be my first time in Boston.
2016-09-15 19:35:24	tlamer	[19:34:33] jflory7: Yeah I'm using fedora on my work computer... I work at Red Hat so at work with RHEL and on my girlfriends computer I've installed Debian few weeks ago... :D

2016-09-15 19:37:53	tlamer	jflory7: So you're Fedora Ambassador? How can one become an ambassador?
2016-09-15 19:38:26	jflory7	tlamer: What region of the world are you in?
2016-09-15 19:38:57	tlamer	jflory7: right now Slovakia, but I work and live in Czech Republic

2016-09-15 19:39:26	jflory7	tlamer: I still need to give Arch a spin. A lot of people in my LUG are big fans, but I've just never had much time to get around to playing with it myself. I hang out here anyways because I enjoy the community. :)
2016-09-15 19:39:50	jflory7	tlamer: Ah, okay! So, this might be a little off-topic for this channel, but if you want to hop in #fedora-ambassadors, I'd be happy to give you the quick rundown :)

2016-09-16 10:42:33	@fsckd	what is a cantenna?
2016-09-16 10:42:48	+meskarune	to make one I'd need a tall can that is about 3 inches across and a usb wifi dongle
2016-09-16 10:43:21	+meskarune	a cantenna increases the distrance you can connect to wifi networks
2016-09-16 10:43:44	+meskarune	with a large antenna you can connect to places like 1/2 mile away or longer depending
2016-09-16 10:43:55	@fsckd	sweet
2016-09-16 10:43:59	Mikaela	Are they legal?
2016-09-16 10:44:35	ng0	there are antennas which can go several kilometers if no interferences are in the way.
2016-09-16 10:44:52	ng0	legal of course :)
2016-09-16 10:47:56	+meskarune	fsckd: cantenna's are just the diy version that is cheap to make
2016-09-16 10:48:04	+meskarune	you just need a usb dongle and a can
2016-09-16 10:48:30	@fsckd	ahh, like a usb wifi adapter?

2016-09-18 09:13:49	MrElendig	[16:57:07] *if* it is true it should be handled trough the legal ways, not going on a shittrowing fest and naming people with no proof given [16:57:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	MrElendig	[17:00:58] it just adds fuel for the other side and turns the whole thing into a troll/flamefest instead of the possibility of a constructive discussion around the problem [17:00:58]

2016-09-18 09:32:13	+tigrmesh	i bet the last bit is my identifier
2016-09-18 09:37:10	turbo64	i never really liked sites like codecademy
2016-09-18 09:37:10		[09:37]
2016-09-18 09:37:39	turbo64	i think you're better off just going out and getting a book on whatever language you want to learn
2016-09-18 09:43:00		[09:37]
2016-09-18 09:45:49	turbo64	the most valuable learning experience is just messing around with stuff and sites like codecademy don't let you do that, you're just answering a series of quiz questions
2016-09-18 09:51:00		[09:45]
2016-09-18 09:51:32	halosghost	imho, finding a knowledgeable mentor who can help you learn is irreplaceable
2016-09-18 09:51:51	turbo64	yeah thats true
2016-09-18 09:51:58	turbo64	if you can afford going to college then thats the best option
2016-09-18 09:52:08	halosghost	I don't know that I would agree with that
2016-09-18 09:52:19	turbo64	otherwise the only affirmation you have that you did something right is that the code compiled and ran correctly
2016-09-18 09:52:21	halosghost	most collegiate comp-sci programs appear to be woefully inadequate
2016-09-18 09:53:10	turbo64	i only know from my own experience
2016-09-18 09:54:02	turbo64	ive taken a bunch of programming classes and had the same teacher in most of them, and she is quite competent and was a programmer for ibm for like 20 years
2016-09-18 09:54:39	turbo64	i had some bad ones too though, who just gave you A if your code compiled without errors
2016-09-18 09:55:01	turbo64	and didnt actually read through it and point out any dumb things you did that would lead to catastrophic failure later on
2016-09-18 09:55:30	+meskarune	I can't really learn that well from books, so I'd rather have step by step excersizes or a project to work on and reading man pages/documentaton
2016-09-18 09:55:41	+meskarune	or learn in a class with a group
2016-09-18 09:57:01	+meskarune	tigrmesh: I haven't heard of sololearn, good to know about more options
2016-09-18 09:57:05	turbo64	group assignments are ok if everyone in the group cares about what theyre doing
2016-09-18 09:57:58	turbo64	but usually the people in my group were just slackers who wanted someone else to do all the work for them and didn't care about actually learning anything
2016-09-18 09:58:04	spider-mario	meskarune: isn’t that what a good book would be like?
2016-09-18 09:58:37	+meskarune	idk, I've never read a programming book that I didn't get bored with quickly
2016-09-18 09:59:27	turbo64	if you don't like reading a lot of boring text then programming probably isn't for you

2016-09-18 10:13:02	halosghost	reading lots of code for understanding isn't the same thing as reading really try text that's trying to describe code
2016-09-18 10:16:37	halosghost	s/try/dry/
2016-09-18 10:16:41	@fsckd	a wet book is kind of hard to use. the pages all stick together and tear easily.
2016-09-18 10:16:52	halosghost	heh
2016-09-18 10:17:55	turbo64	i mean there are books that try to make it "fun" like heads first java, but i find that extremely annoying
2016-09-18 10:17:56	+meskarune	turbo64: I program just fine lol
2016-09-18 10:18:10	+meskarune	so obviously programming is for me
2016-09-18 10:18:48	+meskarune	I like reading other people's code and reading man pages and documentation for code, and writing small projects to learn
2016-09-18 10:19:17	@fsckd	meskarune: what gets you bored of programming books?
2016-09-18 10:19:26	+meskarune	I'd rather learn by reading through someone's github project history I guess, or by writing things and ifguring it out on the fly
2016-09-18 10:19:31	+tigrmesh	i've only every learned languages in classes.  the book is for reference
2016-09-18 10:20:46	+meskarune	fsckd: I think just how wordy they are. often I just need like one line of info. "how do I use a list" and an example of ways to use a list. Not long descriptions of lists and every single use case and feature of them
2016-09-18 10:21:14	+meskarune	sorta like how a man page just gives flags, a short description for what tehy do and some examples
2016-09-18 10:21:20	+meskarune	and then I can use that to do things
2016-09-18 10:21:27	@fsckd	meskarune: i guess you prefer reference books rather than books which teach a concept?
2016-09-18 10:21:35	turbo64	when i started programming, i learned everything from reading moldy old books from my local library and messing around with qbasic and turbo pascal and turbo c++
2016-09-18 10:22:01	+meskarune	fsckd: yeah, I would say thats probably right. I also like reading dictionaries when learning a lang vs. reading a book about a language
2016-09-18 10:22:01		[10:22]
2016-09-18 10:22:18	turbo64	i couldnt ask for help on the internet or look at anyone else's source code
2016-09-18 10:23:01	@fsckd	turbo64: i sort of went your direction
2016-09-18 10:23:03	turbo64	the books are just the starting point to learn the fundamentals
2016-09-18 10:23:26	turbo64	then the real learning is just practice and solving the problems you run into when writing your projects
2016-09-18 10:23:49	+meskarune	turbo64: the point is that everyone learns in different ways :P
2016-09-18 10:24:06	+meskarune	there is no one good / best way to learn how to program
2016-09-18 10:24:30	+meskarune	like the reason I often ask people to look at their code is so I can learn
2016-09-18 10:24:57	@fsckd	i learn best by playing around with the concepts in my mind
2016-09-18 10:24:58	@fsckd	<- math person
2016-09-18 10:25:32	halosghost	I will say there's a lot of benefit in learning the fundamentals; having a solid foundation tends to radically improve code quality
2016-09-18 10:25:45	halosghost	but how you learn the fundamentals can be very different person-to-person
2016-09-18 10:26:00	@fsckd	so i can learn without a computer, as long as i have good books to guide me :)

2016-09-18 10:26:36	turbo64	ive found the best tutorials are the ones that explain how to do a certain thing, like say, a tutorial on writing a card game or something
2016-09-18 10:27:08	turbo64	as opposed to just tutorials that tell you how to write hello world and tell you how to make an array, etc.
2016-09-18 10:27:16	+meskarune	I get bored by that lol
2016-09-18 10:27:30	+meskarune	I just want all the code at once so I can change it and play with it and  see what happens
2016-09-18 10:27:50	+meskarune	I don't want to read about the steps someone took to make something

2016-09-18 10:28:04	+meskarune	but I also like to take apart electronics to see how they work
2016-09-18 10:28:17	+meskarune	and then put them back together or take the pieces and make new things
2016-09-18 10:29:37	+meskarune	I like reading manuals for stuff like motorcycle engines or convection ovens
2016-09-18 10:30:04	+meskarune	they are concise, tell you what you need, and then you can play with the thing in question
2016-09-18 10:31:39	turbo64	over the years ive become kind of against the whole idea of high level "learning languages"
2016-09-18 10:32:06	halosghost	turbo64: ?

2016-09-18 10:33:25	halosghost	I can't really recommend python for anything
2016-09-18 10:33:29	@fsckd	meskarune: you'll probably find assembly very easy to get into. get tables of opcodes and manuals from Intel and grab examples.
2016-09-18 10:33:32	turbo64	but i think you would be better off just learning c++
2016-09-18 10:33:45	halosghost	turbo64: well that makes no sense to me, but okay :)
2016-09-18 10:33:59	halosghost	meskarune: actually x64 ASM is pretty simple
2016-09-18 10:36:42	turbo64	when you start off learning some "easy" language, you end up being frustrated and disillusioned by languages that don't hold your hand and prevent you from doing dumb things

2016-09-18 10:38:27	turbo64	well programming languages arent ice cream flavors
2016-09-18 10:39:14	halosghost	sure they are
2016-09-18 10:39:25	turbo64	you don't pick one based on your personal preference, you choose one that is widely used and will have the most practical application
2016-09-18 10:39:50	turbo64	unless you are just interested in programming theory
2016-09-18 10:39:50	halosghost	turbo64: even if that were true; it wouldn't lead you to pick C++ :)
2016-09-18 10:40:26	turbo64	most applications are still written in c++
2016-09-18 10:40:34	halosghost	that's wildly inaccurate
2016-09-18 10:41:02	turbo64	at least on the desktop
2016-09-18 10:41:17	halosghost	if, by desktop, you mean “Windows”, then sure
2016-09-18 10:41:46	halosghost	though still, not really
2016-09-18 10:43:20	spider-mario	I like C++

2016-09-18 10:47:20	halosghost	fsckd: I suppose my affinity for C and Haskell/Agda probably push me over the line

2016-09-18 10:50:50	turbo64	and if you want to write desktop applications and work with other people on writing applications, then c++ would be a good language to learn
2016-09-18 10:51:14	@fsckd	Best tool for the job.
2016-09-18 10:51:18	spider-mario	GNOME even created Vala so that they wouldn’t have to write their apps in C anymore

2016-09-18 11:13:05	+meskarune	sounds like learning it on a few cpu types would be really interesting
2016-09-18 11:13:23	halosghost	probably :)
2016-09-18 11:13:34	halosghost	I'm planning to get my feet wet in ARM asm pretty soon here

2016-09-18 11:16:49	spider-mario	I’m kind of sad about that, actually
2016-09-18 11:16:50	+meskarune	its already happening in large warehouses
2016-09-18 11:16:52	spider-mario	I enjoy driving
2016-09-18 11:17:08	+meskarune	I can't drive, so I would love to have a car that could drive me when I wanted

2016-09-18 11:18:29	+meskarune	I mean, you could do that, but then you get just other bills :P
2016-09-18 11:19:38	halosghost	cheaper ones though
2016-09-18 11:20:04	+meskarune	idk, public transit and taxi's can still be pretty expensive :(
2016-09-18 11:20:10	halosghost	meskarune: I know
2016-09-18 11:20:39	halosghost	but if you factor in gas, tax on the plates and insurance, for me, uber might actually be cheaper overall
2016-09-18 11:21:16	spider-mario	tax on the plates?
2016-09-18 11:21:27	+meskarune	you could try it for a month and see as an experiment halosghost

2016-09-18 11:22:06	halosghost	sudokode: oh?
2016-09-18 11:22:12	+meskarune	I think the main downside is time. It takes way more time to use public transit and street cars
2016-09-18 11:22:15	sudokode	you just don't get to pick where we go
2016-09-18 11:22:23	halosghost	ahh

2016-09-18 11:23:45	halosghost	if so, I'd seriously consider it
2016-09-18 11:23:59	sudokode	are you good at sealing boxes or driving a forklift?
2016-09-18 11:24:03	sudokode	they have lots of those jobs
2016-09-18 11:24:13	halosghost	I mean, maybe; but I'm not terribly interested in that
2016-09-18 11:24:23	sudokode	really though, can you count and/or read? because our warehouse staff is not the best
2016-09-18 11:24:40	sudokode	I dunno if we have any desk jobs available now though
2016-09-18 11:25:06	halosghost	mm
2016-09-18 11:25:13	spider-mario	here, what’s expensive is the parking spot more than the taxes
2016-09-18 11:25:20	sudokode	though unless you have experience, I think it's $9 an hour starting out
2016-09-18 11:25:26	sudokode	not optimal even around here
2016-09-18 11:28:07	halosghost	spider-mario: luckily, I don't need to deal with that, but that can be a huge problem for other places
2016-09-18 11:28:07		[11:28]
2016-09-18 11:28:08	sudokode	spider-mario: only places with meters around here are where the tourists park
2016-09-18 11:29:36	spider-mario	here, you can park as much as you want in the “blue zones” of your postcode as long as you have a Parkkarte, which costs approximately $300/year
2016-09-18 11:29:43	spider-mario	but it can be very hard to find a spot
2016-09-18 11:30:22	spider-mario	I intend to start renting a private spot soon because I am afraid of leaving my current blue one

2016-09-18 11:32:47	sudokode	what happens if you park in the white zones?
2016-09-18 11:32:54	spider-mario	when I say that I am fear leaving the spot on which my car is currently parked, I mean because it will be taken when I get back :p
2016-09-18 11:32:55	sudokode	or do they not model the parking after the coat of arms?

2016-09-18 12:51:21	halosghost	there are far simpler ones than the templating engines in Ruby et al

2016-09-20 15:18:19	APNG	hi libbies 
2016-09-20 15:18:36	halosghost	APNG: I still use firefox, so my browser still supports you
2016-09-20 15:19:00	halosghost	I know the PNG made MNG, but I've always preferred you since you have a lot of really handy things
2016-09-20 15:19:06	halosghost	not gonna lie though, FLIF is awesome

2016-09-20 15:20:02	APNG	hi halosghost 
2016-09-20 15:20:08	APNG	tbh FLIF sucks
2016-09-20 15:20:30	halosghost	APNG: How Dare You‽
2016-09-20 15:20:38	APNG	did you know FLIF *sucks* for animating spritesheets? especially when different parts of the image have different loop points
2016-09-20 15:20:48	halosghost	¯\ʕ·ᴥ·ʔ/¯
2016-09-20 15:20:54	APNG	(e.g. one half loops every 5 seconds and the other half loops every 7 seconds)
2016-09-20 15:21:14	libbies	o_o
2016-09-20 15:21:15	APNG	(you actually have to store enough frames for mmc(5,7) seconds)
2016-09-20 15:21:22	APNG	uh
2016-09-20 15:21:24	APNG	not mmc

2016-09-20 15:23:25	APNG	I can literally point out at least one flaw in every single image and/or video format in existence or in development
2016-09-20 15:23:37	halosghost	APNG: Daala?
2016-09-20 15:24:14	halosghost	(other than that it's not really a format anymore, but rather ta test bed)
2016-09-20 15:24:45	APNG	halosghost, uh yeah sure, how do you store a static image with that?
2016-09-20 15:25:23	APNG	also, it doesn't seem to support coroutines...
2016-09-20 15:25:57	halosghost	you said “and/or video format”
2016-09-20 15:26:23	APNG	yeah I know I was being silly :P but the previous formats you mentioned were all image formats
2016-09-20 15:26:28	APNG	except mng
2016-09-20 15:26:29	halosghost	indeed
2016-09-20 15:26:31	halosghost	well
2016-09-20 15:26:33	APNG	which's a beast format
2016-09-20 15:26:35	halosghost	hehe
2016-09-20 15:26:57	APNG	I think mng does support coroutines tho
2016-09-20 15:27:11	APNG	just maybe
2016-09-20 15:28:55	APNG	yeah uh sorta
2016-09-20 15:29:08	APNG	god mng is worse than I thought O_O
2016-09-20 15:29:43	APNG	instead of putting whole MNGs inside MNGs, they decided to literally add ints everywhere specifying nesting
2016-09-20 15:29:51	APNG	I just... why ;_;
2016-09-20 15:30:28	APNG	but yes, it seems to support coroutines/animated spritesheets quite nicely
2016-09-20 15:33:20	APNG	uh
2016-09-20 15:33:20		[15:33]
2016-09-20 15:33:28	APNG	the MNG spec is not very clear on interpolation
2016-09-20 15:33:41	APNG	which's something FLIF does support
2016-09-20 15:36:00	halosghost	I just love FLIF's quality and progressiveness for its file size
2016-09-20 15:36:08	halosghost	the animation is a kicker benefit
2016-09-20 15:38:14	APNG	but it sucks for spritesheets
2016-09-20 15:38:25	APNG	I can find flaws in everything :/
2016-09-20 15:38:48	halosghost	nothing can be perfect for all use cases
2016-09-20 15:44:00		[15:38]
2016-09-20 15:53:05	APNG	but uh as I was asking how can I numb myself for the week? :/
2016-09-20 15:57:35	libbies	avoidance coping is a maladaptive coping mechanism, and probably shouldn't be used in the long term :/
2016-09-20 15:59:35	APNG	it's probably better than raging at bi ppl for invalidating me
2016-09-20 15:59:35		[15:59]
2016-09-20 16:00:08	APNG	altho that might get them to block me so that's good I guess
2016-09-20 16:06:00		[16:00]
2016-09-20 16:09:59	APNG	also have I mentioned that ppl can be 0% male 0% female and 100% something else?
2016-09-20 16:10:05	APNG	well now I have

2016-09-20 18:53:15	halosghost	[01:26:29] indeed [01:26:29]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	halosghost	[01:26:31] well [01:26:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:26:33] which's a beast format [01:26:33]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	halosghost	[01:26:35] hehe [01:26:35]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:26:57] I think mng does support coroutines tho [01:26:57]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:27:11] just maybe [01:27:11]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:28:55] yeah uh sorta [01:28:55]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:29:08] god mng is worse than I thought O_O [01:29:08]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:29:43] instead of putting whole MNGs inside MNGs, they decided to literally add ints everywhere specifying nesting [01:29:43]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:29:51] I just... why ;_; [01:29:51]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:30:28] but yes, it seems to support coroutines/animated spritesheets quite nicely [01:30:28]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:33:20] uh [01:33:20]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:33:28] the MNG spec is not very clear on interpolation [01:33:28]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:33:41] which's something FLIF does support [01:33:41]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	halosghost	[01:36:00] I just love FLIF's quality and progressiveness for its file size [01:36:00]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	halosghost	[01:36:08] the animation is a kicker benefit [01:36:08]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:38:14] but it sucks for spritesheets [01:38:14]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:38:25] I can find flaws in everything :/ [01:38:25]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	halosghost	[01:38:48] nothing can be perfect for all use cases [01:38:48]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:53:04] but uh as I was asking how can I numb myself for the week? :/ [01:53:04]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	libbies	[01:57:35] avoidance coping is a maladaptive coping mechanism, and probably shouldn't be used in the long term :/ [01:57:35]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[01:59:35] it's probably better than raging at bi ppl for invalidating me [01:59:35]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[02:00:08] altho that might get them to block me so that's good I guess [02:00:08]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[02:09:59] also have I mentioned that ppl can be 0% male 0% female and 100% something else? [02:09:59]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[02:10:05] well now I have [02:10:05]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	APNG	[02:10:21] good night o/ [02:10:21]

2016-09-22 03:31:53	+tigrmesh	if i may jump on my soapbox for a moment.  this demonstrates the need for and power of having common formats for exchanging files and data
2016-09-22 03:32:43	halosghost	tigrmesh: ++
2016-09-22 03:33:03	halosghost	personally, I would lobby for sqlite databases for this kind of thing
2016-09-22 03:33:17	+tigrmesh	not sure if exchanging is the right term.  but i love that i could fire up my win xp desktop, and read that in excel 2002
2016-09-22 03:33:19	halosghost	but if plain-text is a must, then at least TSV above CSV
2016-09-22 03:33:41	+tigrmesh	tsv is my fave.  so much more readable
2016-09-22 03:34:05	halosghost	and also so much simpler to {en,de}code
2016-09-22 03:34:10	+tigrmesh	but there have been times where csv has been the better choice
2016-09-22 03:34:18	halosghost	tigrmesh: oh?
2016-09-22 03:36:23	halosghost	I've not heard of a case where CSV is preferred for technical reasons as opposed to “people are more familiar with CSV” even though TSV is just as well supported
2016-09-22 03:38:02	+tigrmesh	tsv is tab separated values, right?
2016-09-22 03:38:02		[03:38]
2016-09-22 03:40:01	@fsckd	totoro separated values. in between fields stands a totoro guarding the crops... err data.

2016-09-22 03:46:39	+tigrmesh	one problem with csv is that you can have fields that don't have quotes. so if that field actually has a comma in it (like a formatted number!  gasp!  you'd *never* have those!), it gets split
2016-09-22 03:48:17	+tigrmesh	halosghost: i think there must have been something that had tabs in it
2016-09-22 03:49:04	halosghost	tigrmesh: yes, but encoding tabs in TSV is really easy: \t
2016-09-22 03:49:26	halosghost	that's one of the great things about TSV, it actually has a simple answer for embedding values which include the separator in them
2016-09-22 03:49:30	halosghost	CSV completely fails at that
2016-09-22 03:49:42	@fsckd	what if you want a literal \t ?
2016-09-22 03:50:48	+tigrmesh	if you have sufficient knowledge and control over what is going to accept the input
2016-09-22 03:51:01	+tigrmesh	and know it will parse that correcctly
2016-09-22 03:51:14	halosghost	fsckd: \\t
2016-09-22 03:51:25	halosghost	tigrmesh: oh, definitely
2016-09-22 03:51:46	halosghost	but then it's not arbitrary CSV; it's controlled input
2016-09-22 03:51:47	halosghost	which is fine
2016-09-22 03:51:59	halosghost	doesn't mean that CSV is ever preferable over TSV :)
2016-09-22 03:54:42	+tigrmesh	i prefer readable

2016-09-22 03:55:40	@fsckd	dsv, dinosaur separated values, are almost never preferred. they either try to eat the data or eat the users, depending on the kind of dinosaur separating the fields.
2016-09-22 03:55:46	+tigrmesh	hehe
2016-09-22 03:56:17	+tigrmesh	and the file size, even when compressed...

2016-09-22 08:39:24	+meskarune	its also against their TOS to have a gender only channel :P
2016-09-22 08:39:40	APNG	meskarune, ok, glad we agree that I can send a linux source code .zip over channel DCC
2016-09-22 08:39:56	libbies	don't fucking do that APNG 
2016-09-22 08:40:00	APNG	I won't
2016-09-22 08:40:05	APNG	but it's fine by the TOS
2016-09-22 08:40:23	+meskarune	you are rules lawyering
2016-09-22 08:40:31	+meskarune	but you need to realize they don't cover every single thing
2016-09-22 08:40:39	+meskarune	I'm pretty sure more people on freenode get banned if they do that
2016-09-22 08:40:43	+meskarune	*most
2016-09-22 08:40:45	APNG	well I'll ask then
2016-09-22 08:40:52	APNG	but I use DCC chat all the time
2016-09-22 08:40:54	APNG	with OTR on top
2016-09-22 08:40:57	+meskarune	its probably considered spam
2016-09-22 08:41:10	APNG	so DCC is definitely allowed
2016-09-22 08:41:16	+meskarune	APNG: I mean, if you want that probably efnet or undernet would be better
2016-09-22 08:41:16		[08:41]
2016-09-22 08:41:27	+meskarune	for mass sharing of files
2016-09-22 08:42:36	ng0	also, no means no, yes means yes. I don't even know why we are talking about something where people would be affected who did not give their consent to recieving files.
2016-09-22 08:42:50	libbies	^
2016-09-22 08:42:57	libbies	consent is the bottom line here
2016-09-22 08:43:08	libbies	you *must* obtain consent from people before you send them files
2016-09-22 08:43:21	libbies	and doing that in a channel full of people who are idling/away isn't possible
2016-09-22 08:43:47	APNG	say that to ad services sometime :/
2016-09-22 08:43:47	libbies	besides, it's blocked in here anyway
2016-09-22 08:44:15	APNG	I say "no I don't wanna see your ads" but they still send me their ads :/
2016-09-22 08:44:40	ng0	o.O
2016-09-22 08:45:01	ng0	that's like comparing apples and pizza.
2016-09-22 08:45:09	APNG	no, ads are files
2016-09-22 08:45:29	libbies	where are these 'ads' being distributed?
2016-09-22 08:45:31	APNG	oh also say that to those 2MB 4k images they put on web news nowadays
2016-09-22 08:45:47	libbies	the web is not irc, and irc is not the web
2016-09-22 08:46:08	libbies	topical irc channels are topical; this is not a general purpose irc channel for you to spam random shit in
2016-09-22 08:47:10	APNG	you know, it bugs me that even tho I said "ok" when you said "no", you're still accusing me of not listening to your "no" >.>
2016-09-22 08:48:14	libbies	your 'ok' was followed by rules-lawyering :|
2016-09-22 08:48:46	APNG	uh no not really
2016-09-22 08:48:56	APNG	my "ok" was followed by me telling you it doesn't violate freenode's TOS
2016-09-22 08:49:02	APNG	which's not the same as channel rules >.>
2016-09-22 08:49:43	ng0	it read like you were looking for a reason, for me who's not following this closely.
2016-09-22 08:51:11	APNG	ppl usually make me feel like they're intentionally misunderstanding everything I'm saying :/
2016-09-22 08:52:39	ng0	the clear message could have been: okay, i understand this and won't do this here. But unrelated I want to discuss about this now
2016-09-22 08:53:14	APNG	<libbies> please don't send random files to people
2016-09-22 08:53:14	APNG	<APNG> ok
2016-09-22 08:56:47	ng0	:) my/our gentoo overlay move to gnunet.org is now complete. now I only need to wait until the patch gets merged at upstream gentoo and I can cancel my server contract.

2016-09-22 10:06:10		[10:06]
2016-09-22 10:06:41	halosghost	I'm familiar with the white and black varieties; never heard of greylisting before though
2016-09-22 10:10:18	ng0	new email address / host needs to pass some kind of validy / recognition before mail comes through .. can be seen when you sign up for a list on gnu.org for the first time i think
2016-09-22 10:10:52	libbies	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylisting
2016-09-22 10:10:53	phrik	Title: Greylisting - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
2016-09-22 10:11:10	libbies	the idea is to send a "server too busy" to any incoming email
2016-09-22 10:11:28	libbies	legitimate mail clients will retry after 15 minutes or whatever (and then it gets added to the whitelist)
2016-09-22 10:11:38	libbies	spammers generally don't bother with retries, they just move on

2016-09-23 12:20:59	libbies	[18:43:21] and doing that in a channel full of people who are idling/away isn't possible [18:43:21]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	APNG	[18:43:47] say that to ad services sometime :/ [18:43:47]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	libbies	[18:43:47] besides, it's blocked in here anyway [18:43:47]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	APNG	[18:44:15] I say "no I don't wanna see your ads" but they still send me their ads :/ [18:44:15]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	ng0	[18:44:40] o.O [18:44:40]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	ng0	[18:45:01] that's like comparing apples and pizza. [18:45:01]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	APNG	[18:45:09] no, ads are files [18:45:09]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	libbies	[18:45:29] where are these 'ads' being distributed? [18:45:29]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	APNG	[18:45:31] oh also say that to those 2MB 4k images they put on web news nowadays [18:45:31]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	libbies	[18:45:47] the web is not irc, and irc is not the web [18:45:47]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	libbies	[18:46:08] topical irc channels are topical; this is not a general purpose irc channel for you to spam random shit in [18:46:08]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	APNG	[18:47:10] you know, it bugs me that even tho I said "ok" when you said "no", you're still accusing me of not listening to your "no" >.> [18:47:10]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	libbies	[18:48:14] your 'ok' was followed by rules-lawyering :| [18:48:14]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	APNG	[18:48:46] uh no not really [18:48:46]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	APNG	[18:48:56] my "ok" was followed by me telling you it doesn't violate freenode's TOS [18:48:56]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	APNG	[18:49:02] which's not the same as channel rules >.> [18:49:02]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	ng0	[18:49:43] it read like you were looking for a reason, for me who's not following this closely. [18:49:43]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	APNG	[18:51:11] ppl usually make me feel like they're intentionally misunderstanding everything I'm saying :/ [18:51:11]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	ng0	[18:52:39] the clear message could have been: okay, i understand this and won't do this here. But unrelated I want to discuss about this now [18:52:39]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	APNG	[18:53:14] <libbies> please don't send random files to people [18:53:14]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	APNG	[18:53:14] <APNG> ok [18:53:14]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	ng0	[18:56:47] :) my/our gentoo overlay move to gnunet.org is now complete. now I only need to wait until the patch gets merged at upstream gentoo and I can cancel my server contract. [18:56:47]

2016-09-23 12:20:59	@fsckd	[19:18:50] As a yahoo user... [19:18:50]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	libbies	[19:23:16] i logged into my yahoo mail for the first time in years and i have a thousand emails <_< [19:23:16]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	ng0	[19:23:46] that sounds like 3 regular months of my email x.x [19:23:46]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	APNG	[19:24:53] I once had yahoo mail [19:24:53]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	APNG	[19:25:02] what's yahoo mail good for? [19:25:02]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	libbies	[19:25:08] my regular email has greylisting so i don't get too much spam [19:25:08]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	halosghost	[20:06:10] what's greylisting? [20:06:10]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	halosghost	[20:06:41] I'm familiar with the white and black varieties; never heard of greylisting before though [20:06:41]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	ng0	[20:10:18] new email address / host needs to pass some kind of validy / recognition before mail comes through .. can be seen when you sign up for a list on gnu.org for the first time i think [20:10:18]

2016-09-23 12:20:59	libbies	[20:11:10] the idea is to send a "server too busy" to any incoming email [20:11:10]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	libbies	[20:11:28] legitimate mail clients will retry after 15 minutes or whatever (and then it gets added to the whitelist) [20:11:28]
2016-09-23 12:20:59	libbies	[20:11:38] spammers generally don't bother with retries, they just move on [20:11:38]

2016-09-23 17:13:16	+meskarune	or something like that
2016-09-23 17:13:51	@fsckd	that works on the server
2016-09-23 17:15:43	+meskarune	APNG: gender is a social and cultural construct. There are cultures where more than 2 genders have been the standard for a long time for example.
2016-09-23 17:15:43		[17:15]
2016-09-23 17:16:35	APNG	meskarune, because I personally don't. well uh, technically I can't. I'm 0% male 0% female 100% something else, so saying there is a two-gender spectrum invalidates me and is the most stupid thing in the world because the outside world has said multiple times that yes there are things beyond a two-gender spectrum.
2016-09-23 17:16:42	+meskarune	but in the US they have traditionally had a 2 gender binary
2016-09-23 17:17:11	+meskarune	APNG: but anyways, bisexual generally means a person who is attracted to males and females
2016-09-23 17:17:14	APNG	well I wanna set anyone who says bi has anything to do with a two-gender spectrum on fire.
2016-09-23 17:17:26	+meskarune	and there are pansexuals who are attracted to people
2016-09-23 17:17:30	+meskarune	all types of people
2016-09-23 17:17:30	APNG	because, according to bi ppl that's what I should do
2016-09-23 17:17:59	APNG	what about polysexuals?
2016-09-23 17:18:07	+meskarune	idk, what about them?
2016-09-23 17:18:31	APNG	I mean "polysexual" is an umbrella term that includes bi and pan (and tri and so on) right?
2016-09-23 17:18:32	+meskarune	you asked what bisexual is, and I gave the generally accepted definition of it
2016-09-23 17:19:29	@fsckd	going to test disabling server.use-ipv6
2016-09-23 17:19:52	APNG	meskarune, I've seen so many definitions that I just wanna set anyone who uses "bi" on fire
2016-09-23 17:20:00	APNG	simply because it's too ambiguous
2016-09-23 17:20:09	+meskarune	I get taht
2016-09-23 17:20:15	APNG	I literally have to ask "what kind of bi do you mean?" to be sure >.>
2016-09-23 17:21:21	+meskarune	yeah, sounds frustraiting
2016-09-23 17:21:30	@fsckd	disabling server.use-ipv6 works
2016-09-23 17:21:31	+meskarune	but I mean, people use the labels they most identify with
2016-09-23 17:21:35	+meskarune	fsckd: oh ok
2016-09-23 17:21:44	+meskarune	fsckd: maybe something in how the config works chanaged
2016-09-23 17:21:50	+meskarune	did lighttpd update?
2016-09-23 17:21:58	@fsckd	one moment, checking
2016-09-23 17:22:55	APNG	some ppl just make you wanna set the whole world on fire sometimes
2016-09-23 17:23:12	@fsckd	meskarune: yes, 1.4.40-1 to 1.4.41-2
2016-09-23 17:23:46	+meskarune	oh ok
2016-09-23 17:24:19	+meskarune	ipv6 not working isn't a disaster
2016-09-23 17:24:31	+meskarune	it can get fixed up later heh
2016-09-23 17:24:43	+meskarune	APNG: s/some/all/
2016-09-23 17:24:44	+meskarune	lol
2016-09-23 17:25:17	APNG	meskarune, yeah, except the ones who can't communicate
2016-09-23 17:25:18	@fsckd	i can't directly access ipv6 from home
2016-09-23 17:25:58	+meskarune	APNG: I mean, if someone can't communicate with you the way you want, maybe don't hang out with them
2016-09-23 17:26:16	@fsckd	so i can't check how affected anyone would be with that option disabled
2016-09-23 17:26:22	+meskarune	or you could change how you interact I suppose. It depends on your priorities
2016-09-23 17:26:33	APNG	if someone literally can't (or won't) communicate with you, then they can't make you wanna set the world on fire
2016-09-23 17:26:55	+meskarune	APNG: I'm sure bisexual folks identify that way for a reason, and its not to be confusing to other people.
2016-09-23 17:27:13	@fsckd	is archwomen.org accessible on ipv6?
2016-09-23 17:27:15	+meskarune	it just has meaning for them and thats the label they use
2016-09-23 17:27:40	+meskarune	fsckd: It can be if lighttpd is setup to use ipv6
2016-09-23 17:28:34	+meskarune	APNG: did something happen to make you suddenly want to talk about this?
2016-09-23 17:28:42	APNG	yeah
2016-09-23 17:28:44	APNG	bi week
2016-09-23 17:28:47	APNG	dysphoria
2016-09-23 17:29:07	APNG	doesn't help that I'm autistic I guess, but w/e
2016-09-23 17:30:16	@fsckd	meskarune: do we care about people who are ipv6 only?
2016-09-23 17:31:19	+meskarune	I mean, I do because IPv6 is what everyone should be switching to :P
2016-09-23 17:31:19		[17:31]
2016-09-23 17:31:35	+meskarune	but its not an essential must get done right now type of thing
2016-09-23 17:32:04	+meskarune	APNG: do you have someone you can talk with? I don't experience dysphoria so its hard for me to fully grasp it
2016-09-23 17:33:11	+meskarune	bisexuals are often sorta invisible so bi week is suppose to help make them and their issues more visible

2016-09-24 00:33:55	@fsckd	[03:30:16] meskarune: do we care about people who are ipv6 only? [03:30:16]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	@meskarune	[03:31:18] I mean, I do because IPv6 is what everyone should be switching to :P [03:31:18]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	@meskarune	[03:31:34] but its not an essential must get done right now type of thing [03:31:34]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	@meskarune	[03:32:03] APNG: do you have someone you can talk with? I don't experience dysphoria so its hard for me to fully grasp it [03:32:03]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	@meskarune	[03:33:10] bisexuals are often sorta invisible so bi week is suppose to help make them and their issues more visible [03:33:10]

2016-09-24 00:33:55	@meskarune	[03:56:51] fsckd: the front page should be gunicorn :P [03:56:51]

2016-09-24 06:50:08	ng0	so letsencrypt is effective... there is this german speaking goth dating community, and for a reallllyyy long time it was all cleartext, now some days ago they installed an TLS cert. I did not bother to poke the admins from outside, quit long ago, because they had the written policy to not make demands about the service
2016-09-24 06:50:08		[06:50]
2016-09-24 06:50:30	ng0	there goes my hope to proof their bad system by hacking them one day.
2016-09-24 06:50:52	ng0	at least that part is a tiny bit safer now.
2016-09-24 06:51:10	ng0	not that tls safes the world, but i had to laugh when I saw this
2016-09-24 06:56:13	@meskarune	heh
2016-09-24 06:56:26	@meskarune	I mean, by this time they could have their passwords already hacked
2016-09-24 06:56:33	@meskarune	since people have been sending them clear text
2016-09-24 06:57:41	ng0	at least 13+ years without ssl.

2016-09-24 07:16:01	@meskarune	they should force everyone to change their passwords
2016-09-24 07:18:51	ng0	if i was in charge.... but I don't care. their loss.

2016-09-24 13:49:02	APNG	I think?
2016-09-24 13:52:10	demize	APNG: What would the ext4 interpreter even do?
2016-09-24 13:53:18	APNG	demize, it'd follow hardlinks
2016-09-24 13:53:53	demize	Huh?
2016-09-24 13:54:20	APNG	no wait... let me think... it'd execute the "command" file in the current dir...
2016-09-24 13:54:58	APNG	or something...
2016-09-24 13:55:13	APNG	then it'd follow the "next" hardlink... I think...
2016-09-24 13:55:32	demize	Well, you don't really follow hardlinks, once they exist, they just point to the data.
2016-09-24 13:55:42	APNG	the "next" hardlink must be a dir
2016-09-24 13:55:54	APNG	so uh
2016-09-24 13:56:17	APNG	execute "command" and follow "next" then execute "command" and follow "next" and so on
2016-09-24 13:56:17	demize	Hardlinks to directories are an abomination that most filesystems rightfully do not allow! :p
2016-09-24 13:56:43	demize	Hmm, are there filesystems that allow hardlinks to dirs?
2016-09-24 13:56:47	APNG	but if there's no command then execute "condition" and follow "left" or "right" based on whether it returned success or failure
2016-09-24 13:57:14	APNG	demize, hardlink to directories are the best think in the world because star/graph directories are much better than trees, at least for autistic ppl (e.g. me)
2016-09-24 13:58:21	demize	The only modern OS that supports hardlinks to directories that I know is is OSX, and even then it's a single special-case for TimeMachine.
2016-09-24 13:58:54	demize	Because pretty much nothing is written to handle filesystem loops, because they shouldn't happen. ;p

2016-09-24 14:33:33	APNG	I used them once
2016-09-24 14:34:41	APNG	also if you wanna try it, remember to use a graph/web view instead of a tree view
2016-09-24 14:34:58	APNG	also
2016-09-24 14:35:05	APNG	ext4 supports hardlinks to dirs
2016-09-24 14:35:08	APNG	so you can just use that
2016-09-24 14:35:25	APNG	(it's a side effect of having dirs as normal files, really)

2016-09-24 14:42:46	APNG	I don't understand why the ppl who created file systems in the first place didn't do them with proper graphs (in the mathematical sense) in mind

2016-09-24 14:53:15	demize	ext4 doesn't support hardlinks to dirs?..
2016-09-24 14:53:44	APNG	uh I'm pretty sure it does
2016-09-24 14:53:51	demize	Nope.
2016-09-24 14:54:11	APNG	why do you say "nope"?
2016-09-24 14:54:28	demize	I'm disagreeing with you, affirming what I said about it not supporting them.
2016-09-24 14:54:35	APNG	uh
2016-09-24 14:54:41	APNG	aren't hardlinks just pointers to inodes?
2016-09-24 14:54:53	APNG	and can't inodes be either files or dirs?
2016-09-24 14:55:20	demize	They can be, ext4 still doesn't support it.
2016-09-24 14:55:50	APNG	wouldn't that mean that ext4 does support it, it's just that the system has to support it too?
2016-09-24 14:56:40	libbies	what does that even mean
2016-09-24 14:56:49	demize	ext4 doesn't support them, something using the same datastructures could in theory support it.
2016-09-24 14:57:34	APNG	what do you mean with "ext4 doesn't support them" if the ext4 structures clearly support it?
2016-09-24 14:57:39	APNG	the driver doesn't support them?

2016-09-24 14:59:30	demize	The driver counts as the filesystem.  The data structures underlying the filesystem does not define what the filesystem itself is.
2016-09-24 15:00:02	APNG	ok so an ext4 driver supporting them would mean the filesystem supports them.
2016-09-24 15:01:11	demize	For that specific implementation you could say it, yes, but you can only really say that ext4 supports it if the upstream ext4 driver does.
2016-09-24 15:02:02	demize	Just as Linux doesn't support PE32 binaries.  It's all bits in memory, and you could in theory add support for them, but it doesn't.
2016-09-24 15:03:15	APNG	the raw ext4 filesystem supports them just fine, the linux ext4 driver and the linux OS don't
2016-09-24 15:03:15		[15:03]
2016-09-24 15:03:25	demize	There's no "raw ext4 filesystem".
2016-09-24 15:03:40	demize	The Linux ext4 driver *is* ext4.
2016-09-24 15:03:49	demize	There's no other standard, there's just that driver.
2016-09-24 15:03:57	demize	And what that driver supports is what ext4 supports.

2016-09-24 15:05:34	APNG	hardlinks to dirs are fucking awesome and everyone should try them
2016-09-24 15:05:43	libbies	lol

2016-09-24 15:06:13	libbies	loooool
2016-09-24 15:06:23	demize	So you don't actually use them then.
2016-09-24 15:06:24	APNG	technically I didn't use hardlinks to dirs, just graph-based file storage
2016-09-24 15:06:48	APNG	but graph-based file storage *is* hardlinks to dirs

2016-09-24 15:07:06	APNG	libbies, ...for?
2016-09-24 15:09:25	demize	Anyway, allowing hardlinks to directories in tree-based filesystems would break things.
2016-09-24 15:10:07	demize	Not only is literally nothing written to handle them, including fsck, they would also make it so that you'd end up with garbage data that would never be freed due to reference cycles.
2016-09-24 15:11:02	fsckd	i can handle graphs
2016-09-24 15:11:13	 *	fsckd is superior!

2016-09-24 15:12:22	demize	Anyway, yay, DAGs.
2016-09-24 15:12:33	demize	APNG: It would confuse most people.
2016-09-24 15:12:34	APNG	DAGs are ew
2016-09-24 15:12:44	APNG	ok fine
2016-09-24 15:12:47	APNG	it's better for autistic ppl
2016-09-24 15:12:53	APNG	which are the only ppl that matter
2016-09-24 15:13:31	+meskarune	autistic people are just as diverse a population as anyone else :P
2016-09-24 15:13:42	demize	So we should implement completely new filesystems that we would have to reimplement almost every tool that deals with files for, because a small subset of people might find it "better".
2016-09-24 15:13:48	+meskarune	my squash is almost done baking
2016-09-24 15:14:04	demize	I know quite a few autistic people, and I'm certain most of them would dislike it.
2016-09-24 15:14:11	APNG	demize, I'd like ppl to try it at least once...
2016-09-24 15:14:11	+meskarune	demize: to be fair, I think that is the reason behind most forks, someone wants to make it match what they want :P
2016-09-24 15:14:30	APNG	actually uh
2016-09-24 15:14:39	APNG	let's talk about how most ppl use proper graphs
2016-09-24 15:14:51	APNG	the internet is a proper graph
2016-09-24 15:15:03	demize	APNG: Then get people to pay attention to a system that does it then, just making vague references in an obscure channel will do absolutely nothing.
2016-09-24 15:15:09	APNG	and most mobile apps have proper graphs in them
2016-09-24 15:15:14	demize	meskarune: Sure.
2016-09-24 15:15:21	APNG	e.g. kik
2016-09-24 15:15:26	demize	meskarune: This is forking the whole environment though. ;p
2016-09-24 15:15:32	+meskarune	yeah, honestly I'm a little confused why you are talking about this here APNG
2016-09-24 15:15:44	+meskarune	demize: haha
2016-09-24 15:15:56	demize	Err, what?  What exactly does kik have to do with graphs?
2016-09-24 15:15:59	APNG	there are many ways to get from screen A to screen B on kik, just like there are many ways to get from website A to website B on the internet
2016-09-24 15:16:03	+meskarune	I wish I could fork my life and turn into a magical unicorn treehouse island
2016-09-24 15:16:12	demize	Oh, eh.
2016-09-24 15:16:17	demize	That's really just symlinks.
2016-09-24 15:16:17	APNG	but with a file system, you usually have 1 way to get from directory A to directory B
2016-09-24 15:16:39	+meskarune	what is kik?
2016-09-24 15:16:47	APNG	meskarune, messaging app
2016-09-24 15:16:49	fsckd	A messaging app
2016-09-24 15:16:51	+meskarune	oh
2016-09-24 15:17:08	APNG	also I thought this was an archlinux channel...

2016-09-24 15:28:58	jy2wong	21:12 <APNG> it's better for autistic ppl21:12 <APNG> which are the only ppl that matter
2016-09-24 15:30:00	jy2wong	anyway have y'all seen the kerfuffle about installing linux on recent thinkpads?
2016-09-24 15:33:04	libbies	the thing where they're locked to windows 10, right?
2016-09-24 15:33:10	APNG	uh I mean no not really it's just like... I often get frustrated by ppl attempting to cure autism and stuff, and so I pretty much act like "I only care about autistic ppl" (altho I personally prefer dating autistic ppl over neurotypicals)
2016-09-24 15:33:22	APNG	but yeah, "anyway"

2016-09-24 15:41:50	libbies	there are other manufacturers that use trackpoints
2016-09-24 15:42:28	jy2wong	yeah but I don't like dell's

2016-09-24 15:45:22	libbies	but fujitsu is expensive and i would not recommend them for that reason
2016-09-24 15:46:41	jy2wong	I will throw arbitrary amounts of money at a laptop that has good linux support, user-serviceability, a good keyboard and a good trackpoint
2016-09-24 15:46:48	APNG	meskarune, I wasn't being serious about the "autistic ppl are the only ppl that matter" part, altho I wouldn't call it sarcasm...
2016-09-24 15:46:59	libbies	i don't think fujitsu currently has any models that has one though

2016-09-24 15:47:50	APNG	not really
2016-09-24 15:47:58	fsckd	No track point
2016-09-24 15:48:08	APNG	well uh do security exploits count as problems in this context?
2016-09-24 15:48:14	+meskarune	oh, you mentioned being worried about other arch chanenls, so thats why I was wondering
2016-09-24 15:48:25	+meskarune	APNG: I mean issues with discrimination or harassment

2016-09-24 15:49:23	+meskarune	I've seen people use "autistic" as an insult before online. :(
2016-09-24 15:49:40	APNG	(do they still have "pay no attention to APNG" on the topic?)
2016-09-24 15:49:52	+meskarune	idk I'm not in that channel
2016-09-24 15:49:58	+meskarune	all the programming chans on freenode are horrible
2016-09-24 15:50:34	libbies	APNG: it's sensible advice though
2016-09-24 15:51:02	APNG	meskarune, uh what did you say about harrassment again?
2016-09-24 15:51:04	libbies	i'm pretty sure I'm morally obligated to tell people to /ignore you because of some of the really fucked up shit you've sent me over the past few years ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-09-24 15:52:40	APNG	libbies, well sorry for all the times I was ambiguous and all the times I used an insult as a compliment .-.
2016-09-24 15:56:18	+meskarune	uh... maybe y'all can like, /ignore each other
2016-09-24 15:56:20	APNG	you know I've been called "insane" so many times that I tbh see it as more of a compliment than an insult myself
2016-09-24 15:57:08	+meskarune	idk what history there is but I don't want any drama here, so everyone just needs to follow the code of conduct, channel rules and contact an OP if there is a conflict
2016-09-24 15:57:29	+meskarune	and if you don't personally like a person put them on ignore

2016-09-24 15:58:43	APNG	and I'm ok with being insane

2016-09-27 04:06:03	libbies	i don't know where i'd find time to *make* clothing

2016-09-27 04:33:05	+tigrmesh	would take pre planning
2016-09-27 04:33:23	+tigrmesh	you'd only be able to do the hand sewing bits
2016-09-27 04:34:55	libbies	i'm sure TSA would take away my needles :P
2016-09-27 04:35:03	+tigrmesh	bit if the first thing you did was something knitted or crocheted, which you can take on a plane, or morphing a t-shirt into something else
2016-09-27 04:35:14	+meskarune	for me sewing helps to save a bit of money since I can fix ripped seams or holes, but it takes a while for me to do
2016-09-27 04:35:32	libbies	meskarune: yeah
2016-09-27 04:37:55	+tigrmesh	i'm gooing to separate those quotes because i think they're important

2016-09-27 04:41:51	+meskarune	a while ago people used to always have clothes that were sewn just for them
2016-09-27 04:42:29	+meskarune	sorta interesting to think now the only people who do either pay a ton of money for tailored clothes or sew their own
2016-09-27 04:48:00		[04:42]
2016-09-27 04:48:13	+tigrmesh	yeah
2016-09-27 04:53:08	+tigrmesh	i'm going to compress some paragraphs into one or two
2016-09-27 04:53:09	+tigrmesh	'one basic tenet of wearables: that it is difficult to build things for squishy meat bodies. A lot of engineering practices are founded on the idea that you want predictable, repeatable motions with very little mechanical slop. You want things to line up, and you want precision tolerances.'
2016-09-27 04:53:09	+tigrmesh	''If you’re interested in learning more about this, a particularly epic historical struggle on this topic, “Fashioning Apollo” here is a book about the culture clash between NASA, who basically can’t build anything that hasn’t been rendered in isometric three times over, and the bra seamstresses at Playtex and Warner that they commissioned to make the Apollo spacesuits, which were the first
2016-09-27 04:53:09	+tigrmesh	soft space suits to be made. It’s a good book.'
2016-09-27 04:53:19	+tigrmesh	(transcript at the bottom)
2016-09-27 04:53:20	+meskarune	haha, I like that, squishy bodies
2016-09-27 04:54:05	+meskarune	I think it would be nice to have loose robes, but I guess I can see how they can be annoying, getting caught on things or ripping or needing more time to make sure they won't fall off
2016-09-27 04:54:31	+tigrmesh	the video is judging from the transcript, the video is full of great stuff
2016-09-27 04:57:03	+tigrmesh	if you had the money to control your environment sufficiently that you had wide doors and didn't interact with things like stove
2016-09-27 04:57:05	+tigrmesh	s
2016-09-27 04:57:09	+tigrmesh	or wind
2016-09-27 04:58:00	+meskarune	at my college there were some really old buildings that were made with wide halls, and the halls were made like that so 2 women in large crinoline skirts could walk past each other in the hall
2016-09-27 04:58:52	+meskarune	so each hallway was like at least 12ft wide even for short low traffic areas
2016-09-27 04:58:53	+tigrmesh	how wide were the doors into the classrooms?
2016-09-27 04:59:02	+meskarune	they were wider as well
2016-09-27 04:59:20	 *	libbies is squishy
2016-09-27 04:59:24	+meskarune	its funny that fashion actually dictated building structure

2016-09-27 05:17:46	@fsckd	the coats men wore in the 18th century seem nice
2016-09-27 05:18:38	@fsckd	i guess they're called frockcoat
2016-09-27 05:23:49	@fsckd	modern frock coats look silly
2016-09-27 05:23:49		[05:23]
2016-09-27 05:26:14	+meskarune	yeah, I think the clothes men could wear used to be more variant than they are now
2016-09-27 05:26:56	+meskarune	in the US guys get shorts, pants, and tank tops, t-shirts, and long sleeve shirts
2016-09-27 05:27:00	+meskarune	thats pretty much it

2016-09-28 04:15:35	libbies	meskarune: i used to do 14+ shots of espresso a day \o/
2016-09-28 04:15:53	+meskarune	yeah, I was really bad when I worked as a barrista
2016-09-28 04:16:02	libbies	:3
2016-09-28 04:16:06	+meskarune	I got up to 2 pots of coffee a day becuase it was free
2016-09-28 04:16:20	+meskarune	I'm down now to like 16oz
2016-09-28 04:16:24	+meskarune	but I'm trying to get to 8
2016-09-28 04:17:03	libbies	i was comped drinks all the time at the starbucks i was a regular at, and it was hard to resist <_<
2016-09-28 04:18:00	+meskarune	I stopped drinking for like 2 years, and then unfortuantly lived next to a coffee shop
2016-09-28 04:18:07	+meskarune	and the smell got to me
2016-09-28 04:18:11	+meskarune	and I was sucked back in
2016-09-28 04:19:22	+meskarune	i tried switching to tea for a while, and I don't mind decafe tea actually
2016-09-28 04:19:32	+meskarune	but there is nothing like the taste of coffee
2016-09-28 04:19:59	+meskarune	makes me feel like a druggie lol
2016-09-28 04:20:50	+meskarune	I'm not even supposed to have caffiene at all because of my heart being messed up
2016-09-28 04:21:02	libbies	i'm kinda jonesing for a gingerbread latte right now
2016-09-28 04:21:41	libbies	meskarune: what about decaf coffee? or half-caf?
2016-09-28 04:21:51	+meskarune	I have the taste of decafe coffee
2016-09-28 04:22:03	+meskarune	tea tastes fine to me, but the decaf coffee tastes awful
2016-09-28 04:22:13	+meskarune	I think I need to just cut down to like 6oz a day and drink tea
2016-09-28 04:22:24	libbies	half-caf?
2016-09-28 04:22:31	+meskarune	idk, I've never had that type
2016-09-28 04:22:44	+meskarune	I need to research coffees that are naturually lower in caffiene too
2016-09-28 04:23:05	+meskarune	its like, 90% taste for me, and only a little bit about the waking up parts
2016-09-28 04:23:36	+meskarune	I feel like my brain doesn't totally boot until after I have some coffee

2016-09-28 10:22:00	+meskarune	I'm sure one day we will figure out how to prevent all sorts of genetic diseases
2016-09-28 10:22:16	libbies	genetic engineering~
2016-09-28 10:22:42	+meskarune	its possible we could also really fuck up and create some super prion disease though
2016-09-28 10:23:40	+meskarune	more research to understand and find treatments for those kinds of diseases seems like a good thing to me though
2016-09-28 10:26:30	j605	that is where regulation is actually important. It might slow the progress down but we need some safeguards too ...
2016-09-28 10:28:21	APNG	when in doubt, use flames

2016-09-28 10:31:14	libbies	i once had a cisco router burst into flames \o/
2016-09-28 10:31:32	APNG	good
2016-09-28 10:31:44	APNG	why were you using a cisco router?
2016-09-28 10:31:56	libbies	in a work context
2016-09-28 10:32:04	APNG	yes
2016-09-28 10:32:14	libbies	um, why not?
2016-09-28 10:32:26	libbies	a router is a router is a router is a router is a router
2016-09-28 10:32:37	APNG	yes but you know what you should be using?
2016-09-28 10:32:44	APNG	1 sec let me look it up
2016-09-28 10:33:27	libbies	lol
2016-09-28 10:33:34	APNG	uh meh too lazy to look it up
2016-09-28 10:33:44	libbies	a router is a router is a router is a router is a router
2016-09-28 10:33:55	APNG	but basically you should be using 4-port ethernet cards. a whole bunch of them.
2016-09-28 10:34:10	libbies	lol?
2016-09-28 10:34:27	libbies	we have 40+ ports on some of our routers
2016-09-28 10:34:46	APNG	yes, then use 10+ ethernet cards on a server mobo designed for 10+ cards
2016-09-28 10:34:56	libbies	why?
2016-09-28 10:35:05	libbies	how is that at all better?
2016-09-28 10:35:31	APNG	because then you can use a proper xeon instead of the shitty pentium 3s that comes with most routers
2016-09-28 10:35:47	libbies	nexuses don't come with p3s lol
2016-09-28 10:35:51	libbies	they have asics for packet routing
2016-09-28 10:36:12	APNG	I'm joking about the pentium 3s :P
2016-09-28 10:36:14	libbies	like practically all modern network gear uses asics and not processors
2016-09-28 10:36:21	libbies	still
2016-09-28 10:36:49	APNG	well xeons don't just randomly burst into flames at least
2016-09-28 10:36:57	APNG	right?
2016-09-28 10:37:17	libbies	the cisco did not randomly burst into the flames
2016-09-28 10:37:46	APNG	oh? you plugged an etherkiller into it?
2016-09-28 10:37:50	libbies	there was an environmental issue that caused that to happen (to be exact, the overhead air conditioning unit failed, and the drip tray overfilled, and dripped onto the cisco device)
2016-09-28 10:38:08	APNG	oh
2016-09-28 10:38:53	libbies	that said, i've seen servers burst into flames too :P
2016-09-28 10:39:06	libbies	i miss working in datacentres sometimes
2016-09-28 10:39:08	APNG	how?
2016-09-28 10:40:15	libbies	faulty power supplies, faulty power management modules, etc.
2016-09-28 10:40:26	APNG	ah
2016-09-28 10:40:37	APNG	so not really the CPU?
2016-09-28 10:42:20	libbies	i've had a HP processor power module fail spectacularly, and that killed the processor, but the only time i recall a processor burn up is because the heatsink came undone, which really shouldn't ever happen with a server
2016-09-28 10:43:27	APNG	so as I said, <APNG> well xeons don't just randomly burst into flames at least

2016-09-28 10:44:15	libbies	generally hardware of all shades shouldn't
2016-09-28 10:44:17	libbies	not just xeons
2016-09-28 10:45:37	APNG	well, chinese hardware should always burst into flames, preferably before being installed, but that's just my opinion
2016-09-28 10:45:47	libbies	that sounds racist :P
2016-09-28 10:45:59	libbies	you know i'm ethnically chinese right :P
2016-09-28 10:46:21	APNG	not made in china hardware, just chinese knockoffs
2016-09-28 10:47:22	libbies	why didn't you say that in the first place? :P
2016-09-28 10:47:30	libbies	why qualify 'chinese' at all?
2016-09-28 10:47:38	libbies	why not 'all knockoffs'?
2016-09-28 10:47:48	APNG	because most of the world runs on china
2016-09-28 10:48:06	APNG	also, I don't think I've ever seen non-chinese knockoffs...
2016-09-28 10:48:53	fsckd	IBM PC clones :P
2016-09-28 10:49:19	fsckd	there were Mac clones but Apple killed them
2016-09-28 10:49:35	libbies	compaq :P
2016-09-28 10:49:37	APNG	hmm I mean I guess there were those explosive samsung batteries... I heard they were USA knockoffs of chinese batteries

2016-09-28 11:02:21	ng0	I think I'm learning how to organize, out of necessity that I would drown otherwise.. but the downside is it is only in the coding related part of my life so far x.x
2016-09-28 11:07:04	fsckd	Mac clones too*
2016-09-28 11:08:06	spider-mario	if only I could organize my browsing tabs
2016-09-28 11:08:09	spider-mario	I have too many of them

2016-09-28 11:08:22	spider-mario	(we have a lot of internal web tools)
2016-09-28 11:08:56	APNG	I love bookmarks
2016-09-28 11:09:30	APNG	I keep a single tab open and keep everything in bookmarks
2016-09-28 11:09:51	APNG	lowest RAM usage
2016-09-28 11:10:24	spider-mario	RAM is not my concern here
2016-09-28 11:10:42	APNG	uh
2016-09-28 11:10:42	spider-mario	it’s just a bit overwhelming to have so many tabs
2016-09-28 11:10:49	APNG	you can also tag your bookmarks
2016-09-28 11:10:52	APNG	at least I can
2016-09-28 11:11:12	APNG	so I can just go through the tags
2016-09-28 11:11:33	APNG	(would be interesting to have a browser where the tab bar is more like a filesystem)
2016-09-28 11:14:13	spider-mario	I like Tree Style Tab (a firefox extension)

2016-09-29 00:46:12	APNG	[20:37:46] oh? you plugged an etherkiller into it? [20:37:46]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	libbies	[20:37:49] there was an environmental issue that caused that to happen (to be exact, the overhead air conditioning unit failed, and the drip tray overfilled, and dripped onto the cisco device) [20:37:49]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	APNG	[20:38:08] oh [20:38:08]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	libbies	[20:38:52] that said, i've seen servers burst into flames too :P [20:38:52]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	libbies	[20:39:06] i miss working in datacentres sometimes [20:39:06]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	APNG	[20:39:07] how? [20:39:07]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	libbies	[20:40:14] faulty power supplies, faulty power management modules, etc. [20:40:14]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	APNG	[20:40:25] ah [20:40:25]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	APNG	[20:40:36] so not really the CPU? [20:40:36]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	libbies	[20:42:19] i've had a HP processor power module fail spectacularly, and that killed the processor, but the only time i recall a processor burn up is because the heatsink came undone, which really shouldn't ever happen with a server [20:42:19]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	APNG	[20:43:26] so as I said, <APNG> well xeons don't just randomly burst into flames at least [20:43:26]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	APNG	[20:43:56] :P [20:43:56]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	libbies	[20:44:14] generally hardware of all shades shouldn't [20:44:14]

2016-09-29 09:17:54	APNG	why not just be lazy and ban everyone involved? .-.
2016-09-29 09:17:54		[09:17]
2016-09-29 09:19:53	Peng	APNG: If you want to be an incompetent, destructive op, the laziest option is to do nothing and ban no one.
2016-09-29 09:21:03	APNG	Peng, the idea of banning everyone involved is to exploit fear as a way to avoid arguments
2016-09-29 09:21:13	APNG	you're scared of getting banned, thus you don't argue
2016-09-29 09:21:40	halosghost	deterrence doesn't work
2016-09-29 09:21:43	halosghost	the only solution is to ban *
2016-09-29 09:22:05	APNG	the social interactions that never lead to arugments are the ones that aren't
2016-09-29 09:22:27	APNG	right?
2016-09-29 09:22:39	APNG	just like the fastest code is the code that never runs?
2016-09-29 09:23:39	halosghost	that's not always true though

2016-09-29 09:24:03	halosghost	but eh
2016-09-29 09:28:08	libbies	deterrence only works with rational actors
2016-09-29 09:29:15	APNG	eh, most of my experience with bans is channel ops misunderstanding me while channel members understand me correctly :/ (in which case the op should be demoted instead of banned, but still)
2016-09-29 09:29:23	libbies	hm, halting-problem is available as a nick :o

2016-09-29 09:29:38	libbies	nah, it's not for me
2016-09-29 09:29:39	halosghost	APNG: ops can ban for whatever reason they want
2016-09-29 09:29:56	halosghost	APNG: my personal favorite reason to ban people in the channels I op is “it's Wednesday.”
2016-09-29 09:29:59	APNG	halosghost, they can, we're not arguing "can" we're arguing "should"
2016-09-29 09:30:07	halosghost	s/can/should/
2016-09-29 09:30:09	halosghost	:)
2016-09-29 09:31:15	APNG	I think we both disagree that they should
2016-09-29 09:31:40	APNG	should ops ban gay ppl just because they're gay, for example?
2016-09-29 09:32:04	APNG	(can they? sure, but I don't think they should)
2016-09-29 09:33:43	@fsckd	i have seen channels where the ops are abusive. i avoid those places.

2016-09-29 09:37:32	+meskarune	APNG: people are free to debate things, we all don't agree on everything. As long as someone follows the channel rules they should be fine.
2016-09-29 09:38:15	+meskarune	APNG: in the case of previous bans here, we are under a raid from people who have no interest in actually helping the project
2016-09-29 09:38:19	+meskarune	so there is no reason for them to be here
2016-09-29 09:39:04	+meskarune	if you are freinds with someone who is trolling in multiple other channels and then you both join here, we will ban you and the friend both
2016-09-29 09:39:21	APNG	uh I mean
2016-09-29 09:39:26	APNG	I was talking about this <jflory7> Removing toxic people from communities isn't fun, but it's satisfying when others in the community feel more comfortable and open when the toxic person is removed
2016-09-29 09:39:57	+meskarune	I mean, toxic is deffinited as people who aren't following the CoC and community standards and not being helpful
2016-09-29 09:40:11	+meskarune	*defined
2016-09-29 09:40:40	+meskarune	we also give warnings and ask people to leave
2016-09-29 09:40:47	APNG	uh, well, I don't know the full context...
2016-09-29 09:40:49	+meskarune	but with raids we just ban outright to avoid wasting time
2016-09-29 09:40:58	APNG	actually, that seemed kinda out of context...
2016-09-29 09:41:37	+meskarune	idk, if you have a specific issues with MOD actions in here, maybe PM someone about it
2016-09-29 09:41:57	+meskarune	otherwise I don't see where this conversation is going

2016-09-29 12:02:36	jflory7	APNG: In this case, it was an issue with a single person passive-aggressively harassing others in the community. The community was a group of volunteers from a conference that ended this past week, which included the individual. I didn't interact with him during the event but started to after
2016-09-29 12:02:36		[12:02]
2016-09-29 12:03:16	jflory7	It's gray because there is no CoC or even community rules because it's such a small group, and if there were an official policy, it would be from the conference organizers, I guess - but they're hands-off from our small group community
2016-09-29 12:03:33	@fsckd	:(
2016-09-29 12:04:11	jflory7	I just enforced what I thought was right, which is always a super gray area. My concern now though is usually with some kind of backlash from an individual when enforcing action

2016-09-30 00:48:23	halosghost	[19:23:39] that's not always true though [19:23:39]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	halosghost	[19:23:41] interestingly [19:23:41]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	halosghost	[19:24:03] but eh [19:24:03]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	libbies	[19:28:07] deterrence only works with rational actors [19:28:07]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	APNG	[19:29:15] eh, most of my experience with bans is channel ops misunderstanding me while channel members understand me correctly :/ (in which case the op should be demoted instead of banned, but still) [19:29:15]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	libbies	[19:29:23] hm, halting-problem is available as a nick :o [19:29:23]

2016-09-30 00:48:23	libbies	[19:29:37] nah, it's not for me [19:29:37]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	halosghost	[19:29:39] APNG: ops can ban for whatever reason they want [19:29:39]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	halosghost	[19:29:56] APNG: my personal favorite reason to ban people in the channels I op is “it's Wednesday.” [19:29:56]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	APNG	[19:29:59] halosghost, they can, we're not arguing "can" we're arguing "should" [19:29:59]

2016-09-30 00:48:23	halosghost	[19:30:08] :) [19:30:08]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	APNG	[19:31:14] I think we both disagree that they should [19:31:14]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	APNG	[19:31:39] should ops ban gay ppl just because they're gay, for example? [19:31:39]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	APNG	[19:32:03] (can they? sure, but I don't think they should) [19:32:03]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	fsckd	[19:33:42] i have seen channels where the ops are abusive. i avoid those places. [19:33:42]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	fsckd	[19:33:59] even though some of them would have interested me otherwise. [19:33:59]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	Mikaela	[19:34:13] what now? -.- [19:34:13]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	 *	Mikaela [19:34:40] is quite assured of the world ending tonight [19:34:40]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	Peng	[19:36:53] Oh no! I just got new deodorant [19:36:53]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	+meskarune	[19:37:32] APNG: people are free to debate things, we all don't agree on everything. As long as someone follows the channel rules they should be fine. [19:37:32]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	+meskarune	[19:38:14] APNG: in the case of previous bans here, we are under a raid from people who have no interest in actually helping the project [19:38:14]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	+meskarune	[19:38:19] so there is no reason for them to be here [19:38:19]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	+meskarune	[19:39:03] if you are freinds with someone who is trolling in multiple other channels and then you both join here, we will ban you and the friend both [19:39:03]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	APNG	[19:39:20] uh I mean [19:39:20]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	APNG	[19:39:26] I was talking about this <jflory7> Removing toxic people from communities isn't fun, but it's satisfying when others in the community feel more comfortable and open when the toxic person is removed [19:39:26]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	+meskarune	[19:39:57] I mean, toxic is deffinited as people who aren't following the CoC and community standards and not being helpful [19:39:57]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	+meskarune	[19:40:11] *defined [19:40:11]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	+meskarune	[19:40:40] we also give warnings and ask people to leave [19:40:40]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	APNG	[19:40:47] uh, well, I don't know the full context... [19:40:47]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	+meskarune	[19:40:49] but with raids we just ban outright to avoid wasting time [19:40:49]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	APNG	[19:40:58] actually, that seemed kinda out of context... [19:40:58]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	+meskarune	[19:41:37] idk, if you have a specific issues with MOD actions in here, maybe PM someone about it [19:41:37]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	+meskarune	[19:41:57] otherwise I don't see where this conversation is going [19:41:57]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	APNG	[19:42:36] I was just replying to that message, nothing specific to this channel [19:42:36]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	APNG	[19:43:10] and as I said I'm not sure what that message was referring to, as it seemed out of context and stuff [19:43:10]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	fsckd	[19:44:37] oh, they're an op in some other channels some of us are in. i don't think i'm in the channel they banned in recently, so i can't describe the specific situation. [19:44:37]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	APNG	[19:45:25] ah, ok [19:45:25]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	jflory7	[22:02:36] APNG: In this case, it was an issue with a single person passive-aggressively harassing others in the community. The community was a group of volunteers from a conference that ended this past week, which included the individual. I didn't interact with him during the event but started to after [22:02:36]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	jflory7	[22:03:15] It's gray because there is no CoC or even community rules because it's such a small group, and if there were an official policy, it would be from the conference organizers, I guess - but they're hands-off from our small group community [22:03:15]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	fsckd	[22:03:32] :( [22:03:32]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	jflory7	[22:04:11] I just enforced what I thought was right, which is always a super gray area. My concern now though is usually with some kind of backlash from an individual when enforcing action [22:04:11]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	jflory7	[22:04:25] So far nothing, and hopefully it will remain that way [22:04:25]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	APNG	[01:47:09] jflory7, ah, sorry [01:47:09]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	APNG	[01:48:56] anyway good night o/ [01:48:56]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	jflory7	[01:58:33] No worries :) [01:58:33]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	jflory7	[01:58:36] APNG: Good night! [01:58:36]

2016-09-30 03:18:11	Mikaela	tigrmesh: I am connected from lakka.kapsi.fi, Ciblia from vardiera.mikaela.info, Riotela from Riot.im from my point of view, but it uses the Matrix IRC Bridge and it cannot be used without Matrix account
2016-09-30 03:19:03	demize	(And you cannot set the ident yourself through the matrix.org IRC bridge.)
2016-09-30 03:19:29	+tigrmesh	why are you in here with 3 connections
2016-09-30 03:19:31	+tigrmesh	?
2016-09-30 03:19:46	demize	I assume it's in case the other ones die for whatever reason.
2016-09-30 03:19:52	+tigrmesh	like web gateways
2016-09-30 03:19:54	Mikaela	tigrmesh: I would encourage you to try it, https://riot.im/. Much more mobile and eye friendly and easier notification settings (loud, all notifications, none)

2016-09-30 03:22:03	Mikaela	tigrmesh: Ciblia is here as I keep its channels synced with this one for backup and as I said, this is unstable version of both ZNC and WeeChat. Riotela was here as this is one of the channels which I care about and want to follow. 
2016-09-30 03:22:46	Mikaela	demize: I have the same issue, Weechat

2016-09-30 03:36:40	Mikaela	No one asked, but Riotela isn't identified because the bridge doesn't use SSL yet and I don't want to send password in plain text 
2016-09-30 03:37:29	Mikaela	fsckd: you can watch since Matrix groups without joining, but that doesn't apply to any room with IRC Bridge

2016-09-30 03:41:08	Mikaela	That link is outdated though, when you kicked me, I was thrown out from Matrix too, but you can see it's from 2015
2016-09-30 03:47:00		[03:41]
2016-09-30 04:09:09	+elky	When I checked matrix.org last night I was getting fed logs of #freenode without being in #freenode yet.
2016-09-30 04:09:09		[04:09]
2016-09-30 04:09:34	libbies	i noticed that behaviour as well
2016-09-30 04:10:02	libbies	i think there's a way to get administrative access to a channel though in matrix
2016-09-30 04:10:09	libbies	and then you could block people from joining within in
2016-09-30 04:14:08	+elky	It will also happily feed you a who list for channels it never joins you to
2016-09-30 04:15:22	Peng	>_< Sounds lovely for channels that don't worry about trolls
2016-09-30 04:18:08	+elky	I can think of at least one troll who regularly sent people in to a channel I op to check for the presence of their victim. He'd love it.
2016-09-30 04:24:00		[04:18]
2016-09-30 05:57:45	@fsckd	elky: does it join as a single user or just has really bad internal security?
2016-09-30 05:57:45		[05:57]
2016-09-30 06:00:09	libbies	from what i've seen: each matrix user has their own session (and connection to irc), but it preloads historic messages based on other people who have joined from matrix
2016-09-30 06:00:26	@fsckd	oh
2016-09-30 06:00:48	libbies	so it shows channel history from anyone else logged in from matrix
2016-09-30 06:01:53	@fsckd	and can show that history for channels you've not joined?
2016-09-30 06:02:18	libbies	if no other matrix user is in a channel, you won't get anything back from it
2016-09-30 06:02:32	libbies	if you're the first matrix user to try to join, it'll join you, and it'll only show messages that you see
2016-09-30 06:02:56	libbies	and then subsequent matrix users will see channel history based on your history
2016-09-30 06:06:54	@fsckd	I see, so effectively publicly logs the channel even if the channel is not normally publicly logged.
2016-09-30 06:07:09	libbies	yup.
2016-09-30 06:07:23	Peng	Good feature for public channels, but...
2016-09-30 06:07:28	libbies	that said, there seems to be administrative settings available in matrix, so you can lock other people out of the channel
2016-09-30 06:07:36	libbies	but i haven't figured out how to get access to any of those yet
2016-09-30 06:07:49	libbies	and i'm hoping peng could do that for the other channels we're in :P
2016-09-30 06:08:03	libbies	or at least, figure it out, i mean
2016-09-30 06:10:17	Peng	I'm half-inclined to just join #matrix and ask
2016-09-30 06:12:03	libbies	oh the #matrix folks might be able to tell you how to disable logging for a channel too
2016-09-30 06:18:00		[06:12]
2016-09-30 06:21:54	Peng	I don't use Matrix or understand it but...
2016-09-30 06:22:01	Peng	I think public logging is off by default, or should be.
2016-09-30 06:22:01	APNG	I like the idea of P2P log sharing...
2016-09-30 06:22:07	APNG	could be implemented with CTCP I guess...
2016-09-30 06:22:38	Peng	I asked #matrix about the scrollback thing, and they said that it should be carefully designed and off by default? I think?
2016-09-30 06:22:41	 *	Peng glances at libbies
2016-09-30 06:23:01	APNG	why do y'all not like P2P log sharing?
2016-09-30 06:23:26	libbies	Peng: i know elky got logs for #freenode
2016-09-30 06:23:53	libbies	APNG: leaks sensitive data; this channel explicitly disallows public logging
2016-09-30 06:24:03	APNG	libbies, public logging is one thing
2016-09-30 06:24:09	APNG	sharing your logs with channel members is another
2016-09-30 06:24:24	APNG	P2P log sharing is the latter, not the former
2016-09-30 06:24:27	libbies	if anyone can join your channel then it's effectively public
2016-09-30 06:24:35	Peng	APNG: Some "channel members" are trolls who are about to be banned.
2016-09-30 06:25:23	APNG	if your channel is public then why does it matter?
2016-09-30 06:25:47	Peng	APNG: There are degrees of public. It's not more public than necessary to trolls.
2016-09-30 06:26:06	Peng	("It" being... whatever.)
2016-09-30 06:26:50	Peng	Could someone who knows more than me join #matrix ? They seem to care about privacy, and if there are issues, they'd like to know. And I'm just relaying what I half-understand.
2016-09-30 06:26:52	APNG	what's the difference between the IRCd replaying old messages and the users P2P-sharing old messages, for example?
2016-09-30 06:27:40	libbies	Peng: probably need elky, but if it needs to be configured on a per-channel basis by an admin, we're probably okay?
2016-09-30 06:27:59	@fsckd	APNG: freenode doesn't replay old messages
2016-09-30 06:28:13	libbies	and, the IRCd that allow that, allow it to be disabled
2016-09-30 06:28:31	libbies	it's hard to undo P2P once it's out there.
2016-09-30 06:28:32	APNG	libbies, and some ppl leave it enabled but complain about p2p log sharing
2016-09-30 06:28:45	Peng	libbies: AIUI, for bridged channels, whatever that means, a channel op has to explicitly tell the Matrix bot that public logs are okay.
2016-09-30 06:28:51	libbies	APNG: a matter of access?
2016-09-30 06:28:57	APNG	well
2016-09-30 06:29:02	APNG	can also do a simple trust mechanism
2016-09-30 06:29:02	libbies	APNG: people still have to join the channel to see logs, and you can still ban them
2016-09-30 06:29:15	libbies	while, with p2p, how do you ban effectively?
2016-09-30 06:29:16	APNG	1 line of reverse backlog per second
2016-09-30 06:29:37	libbies	i'm not a fan of additional complexity
2016-09-30 06:29:45	APNG	libbies, banned ppl can still see local logs anyway
2016-09-30 06:29:59	libbies	sorry?
2016-09-30 06:30:31	APNG	libbies, the act of banning someone doesn't magically wipe their filesystem
2016-09-30 06:30:55	libbies	yeah and?
2016-09-30 06:31:02	APNG	how's it any different for p2p?
2016-09-30 06:31:08	APNG	you ban someone, they lose access to new logs
2016-09-30 06:31:09	libbies	if you get banned from here
2016-09-30 06:31:10	APNG	they keep their logs
2016-09-30 06:31:33	libbies	if you get banned from here right now, you'll still have your historic logs. fine. but, the point of banning you isn't to remove those, it's to prevent your future access to logs in this channel
2016-09-30 06:31:43	APNG	yes
2016-09-30 06:31:48	libbies	until the point that you're banned, the logs you have are fine for you to have
2016-09-30 06:32:03	APNG	and after you're banned, you're still allowed to keep your logs
2016-09-30 06:32:06	libbies	after you are banned, we would want to retain control to access to any logs from this channel as  tightly as possible
2016-09-30 06:32:07	APNG	you just can't get new logs
2016-09-30 06:32:19	libbies	P2P allows sharing of logs post-ban
2016-09-30 06:32:30	APNG	not if you do it right >.>
2016-09-30 06:32:51	Peng	APNG: The whole point of this conversation is 'doing it wrong'. :-/
2016-09-30 06:32:53	APNG	I'm not saying a distributed logging framework
2016-09-30 06:33:03	APNG	I'm saying syncing your logs to ppl who join the channel
2016-09-30 06:33:03		[06:33]
2016-09-30 06:33:09	@fsckd	doesn't sound like matrix is doing it right
2016-09-30 06:33:17	APNG	and only those who actually join it
2016-09-30 06:33:43	Peng	I think they *want* to do it right. If there are bugs, they want to know.
2016-09-30 06:34:05	libbies	Peng: i think everything is okay, if an op is needed to enable history?
2016-09-30 06:34:17	libbies	which means #freenode probably enabled it at some point in the past
2016-09-30 06:34:24	@fsckd	Peng: so it is off by default unless we tell them to turn it on?
2016-09-30 06:34:28	APNG	Peng, well, I guess I'll add it to CTCP-S, but done right
2016-09-30 06:34:30	libbies	seems so
2016-09-30 06:34:35	Peng	fsckd: Probably! ;-D

2016-09-30 06:35:23	Peng	a Matrix person said that it *used* to be on in #freenode, a long time ago, because the older version of the software wasn't as good. elky *could* have had some really old scrollback dumped. If it was new scrollback, either I'm misunderstanding something essential, or there's a bug.
2016-09-30 06:36:04	libbies	Peng: to me, it still seems pretty terrible, given how long it took to join and part the other channel :P
2016-09-30 06:36:28	@fsckd	it sounds like a nice feature but should be optional for channels which don't want it.

2016-10-01 04:15:25	ng0	propaganda panda is now my twitter header picture :D
2016-10-01 04:19:06	ng0	I really hope the funding works out.. even when it will not be the full amount, getting funding would really relief me of some pressure I have on other fronts
2016-10-01 04:19:37	ng0	and depending on how much, i could invest in arm and mips hardware for the system to build on for a later phase
2016-10-01 04:21:29	+meskarune	yeah, I hope that you get approved
2016-10-01 04:26:35	ng0	the outside situation just keeps getting worse while I keep getting better. I mean, I now have a 6 months approval by the jobcenter that I'm unfit for work (previously I had to send in the doctors letters every month),
2016-10-01 04:26:35		[04:26]
2016-10-01 04:26:35	ng0	 *but* the doctor (psychiatrists) at their end who reviewed my case is involved in 'territorial pissings': legaly in this case psychiatrists and psychologists are equal, but the letter
2016-10-01 04:26:35	ng0	does not even acknowledge the existence of my psychologist -.-
2016-10-01 04:27:12	ng0	and has the 'maybe' stamp that after 6 months they can just throw me in whatever direction they see as *healthy* for me
2016-10-01 04:27:57	ng0	so I'll also look into financing university etc..
2016-10-01 04:28:18	ng0	because I know i'll only get worse in some situation where I get forced in
2016-10-01 04:29:30	ng0	I know even 20 hours/week university will be difficult and there's the risk with money, but it's still better than adding the weight of control and pressure of an agency who is not interested in your recovery
2016-10-01 04:30:04	ng0	I try very hard not to think about this most of the time, that's a desperations cycle.
2016-10-01 04:31:16	+tigrmesh	desperation cycle.  good term for it
2016-10-01 04:35:52	ng0	I have some relatively small items to work on left for this phase of the project, and afterwards I need to slow down and disconnect for a bit, learn more about
2016-10-01 04:35:52	ng0	guile to understand the core of guix and how to extend it the way i want to.
2016-10-01 04:35:52	ng0	one bigger phase I have for my project is to work towards a model of fully distributed package (as in software, guix package, guix publish, etc) updates.
2016-10-01 04:35:52	ng0	I think this can be something I can use in university as well.. my optimistic estimation is summer / autumn 2017 I'm done with that phase, but I almost fear it
2016-10-01 04:35:52	ng0	is too optimistic :D

2016-10-01 07:05:12	Peng	I'm not sure what the current state is. I *think* they turned off lazy joins, or otherwise tightened up the security issues.
2016-10-01 07:05:20	Peng	despite reverting back to IPv4
2016-10-01 07:06:08	Mikaela	the lazy joins were on at least at 2016-10-01 19:52:31+0300 < *mynicks> * Riotela (cibliamatr@gateway/shell/matrix.org/x-kjafnhedsgslvqmr) joins #matrix
2016-10-01 07:06:29	Peng	That is unfortunate
2016-10-01 07:06:35	Peng	Damn. D:
2016-10-01 07:07:11	Mikaela	and I think moving to IPv6 involves restarting the bridge which was done last night judging by "they tried it last night, but everything exploded" or however Yaniel said itin that first link
2016-10-01 07:09:10	Mikaela	if you are Matrix user, #irc:matrix.org is the room for "IRC Matrix Bridges". They said now that freenode decided to give them IPv6 I-line for 100 connections instead of the 5 000 they need and haven't fixed it.

2016-10-01 07:11:18	APNG	Mikaela, IRCv3 is stupid and doesn't support anything involving client-side-only stuff
2016-10-01 07:11:38	APNG	IRCv3 is literally anti-p2p and they're proud of that

2016-10-01 07:12:04	@fsckd	Mikaela: Riotela can't speak in here because we have all unidentified quieted. had to do that because of trolls. :(
2016-10-01 07:12:07	APNG	well
2016-10-01 07:12:21	APNG	why should an experimental feature get major client approval before it's out of the experimental phase?

2016-10-01 07:13:11	Mikaela	fsckd: I will be identifying Riotela when the IRC bridge starts using SSL (I have understood it had some problem with freenode/IPv4/idents)

2016-10-01 07:14:19	@fsckd	Mikaela: Ok, just wanted to be sure you knew why Riotela couldn't speak. At least one chanop remians unidentified and can't speak. So you aren't the only one.
2016-10-01 07:14:22	Mikaela	until that I guess I can use WeeChat Android or WeeChat if they want to work, WeeChat Android seems to have a problem with development and sometimes dying and not being able to reconnect before disconnected and told to connect again
2016-10-01 07:14:57	Mikaela	oh, I guessed that or that there was Matrix quiet (which was unlikely as quiet would do nothing to the concerns)
2016-10-01 07:16:44	+meskarune	so now I'm wondering though, if matrix was able to get around those sorts of things, couldn't someone code a bot that gets info from channels doing that on purpose?
2016-10-01 07:17:40	Mikaela	it's FOSS, so I guess it would be possible, but they couldn't be sure of the bot not being visible at IRC especially with channels like this which have two Matrix users
2016-10-01 07:18:46	Peng	meskarune: Up until they fix it, I guess so. Though other Matrix users in the channel would notice.
2016-10-01 07:18:46		[07:18]
2016-10-01 07:18:59	+meskarune	yeeah, I see
2016-10-01 07:19:13	+tigrmesh	how many matrix users are there on freenode?
2016-10-01 07:23:44	Mikaela	They say they need 5 000 I-lines which is probably a little higher than the current count and #matrix:matrix.org has 4508 users, but that includes users from #matrix too and it would need long counting to see which are from Matrix and which from IRC and there might be duplicates too
2016-10-01 07:29:00		[07:23]
2016-10-01 07:33:14	@fsckd	what is an I-lines
2016-10-01 07:33:54	@fsckd	s/is an/are/
2016-10-01 07:35:57	Mikaela	usually you can have maximum of X connections to IRC network, the I-line gives you a higher limit
2016-10-01 07:36:33	@fsckd	i see
2016-10-01 07:37:47	Mikaela	there are also network specific details such as running identd giving higher limit at freenode and most of networks checking for ident requiring it for I-lines and Matrix had some issue with their identd not working with IPv6 or something related to ident and IPv6 (I cannot think directly what other issue there could be given words "problem ident ipv6"
2016-10-01 07:39:29	Peng	Mikaela: AIUI, their identd setup doesn't support IPv6 at all, since they don't need it when each user has a unique IPv6 IP.
2016-10-01 07:41:26	Mikaela	But they are in same address range which networks generally care about? 
2016-10-01 07:44:50	Peng	Probably. And apparently Freenode's i:line for their range was configured to require identd. Whoops.

2016-10-01 10:38:24	+tigrmesh	windows/windows explorer doesn't have a lot of support for other compressed file types.  iirc, gnome comes with an un archive program preinstalled
2016-10-01 10:38:43	+tigrmesh	windows has zip. and that might be relatively new
2016-10-01 10:38:49	ng0	If i still were in contact with my parents, I would refuse any tech related work for them. this year my mother found it acceptable that her school paid me 250 euro for 24 hours (workinghours, stretched to several days) work.
2016-10-01 10:38:51	spider-mario	not on Arch, I believe
2016-10-01 10:38:53	spider-mario	:p
2016-10-01 10:38:54	+tigrmesh	*zip or similar
2016-10-01 10:39:04	+tigrmesh	gnome extra doesn't have it?
2016-10-01 10:39:16	ng0	i don't do free work for people who exploit me.
2016-10-01 10:39:23	spider-mario	isn’t it file-roller?
2016-10-01 10:39:44	ng0	windows has zip since windows 98 at least
2016-10-01 10:39:50	+tigrmesh	i don't remember.  i haven't used gnome in a while
2016-10-01 10:40:13	spider-mario	in any case, that’s not really “preinstalled”, is it?
2016-10-01 10:40:28	ng0	zip on windows 98? it's built in.
2016-10-01 10:40:30	+tigrmesh	ahh
2016-10-01 10:40:41	spider-mario	ng0: no, I mean file-roller in GNOME
2016-10-01 10:40:59	spider-mario	more specifically in Arch
2016-10-01 10:41:09	+tigrmesh	spider-mario: you are right.  i misspoke. 
2016-10-01 10:41:27	ng0	dunno.. haven't used arch in years :)
2016-10-01 10:41:31	+tigrmesh	s/preinstalled//
2016-10-01 10:41:41	spider-mario	ng0: what do you use these days?
2016-10-01 10:41:51	ng0	i build my own system.
2016-10-01 10:41:57	spider-mario	I’m actually running Chrome OS right now. :p
2016-10-01 10:42:17	ng0	the long version is:
2016-10-01 10:42:27	+meskarune	I should try out chrome OS one day
2016-10-01 10:43:40	jflory7	we had some discussion about Chrome OS in my local LUG on Friday, with regards to running Linux on it
2016-10-01 10:43:56	jflory7	Seems like a tricky bit of maneuvering
2016-10-01 10:44:09	ng0	I maintain, package and develop for GNUnet and Secushare using/for Guix and Gentoo and I'm slowly checking out Nix development.. I currently focus on Guix. The live-system I create is at first aiming to be GuixSD based, but I consider other alternatives later just in case.
2016-10-01 10:45:16	ng0	i wrote create my own system, because the amount of work i put into Guix and still need to put into it to extend it to the point where I want it, is similar to creating half a system from 0.
2016-10-01 10:45:16		[10:45]
2016-10-01 10:45:46	libbies	honestly i wouldn't send anyone an attachment in this day and age <_<
2016-10-01 10:45:59	libbies	easier to send someone a link to an album
2016-10-01 10:46:35	ng0	I would not trust attorneys who do not provide any form of encrypted messaging.. but that's an entire different story.
2016-10-01 10:47:51	ng0	I'm only dealing with them directly because my friend who's usually doing it is in austria for a semester.
2016-10-01 10:48:01	spider-mario	jflory7: to be honest, I don’t really see the point of buying chrome hardware specifically to run something else on it
2016-10-01 10:48:18	jflory7	spider-mario: I think it's mostly the cost + weight appeal
2016-10-01 10:48:35	jflory7	I was considering a Chromebook for a while to run Linux with, just because of how light it is
2016-10-01 10:48:42	jflory7	e.g. for classes / easy carrying around
2016-10-01 10:48:45	spider-mario	is it?
2016-10-01 10:48:50	spider-mario	what specific model did you have in mind?
2016-10-01 10:48:59	ng0	chromeOS is gentoo.. i don't see how it can be locked. and their bios is coreboot usually
2016-10-01 10:49:01	+meskarune	I have a chromebook I think
2016-10-01 10:49:05	+meskarune	but its running arch
2016-10-01 10:49:15	jflory7	Well, most of them are pretty light. I can't remember the ones I was looking at before (was around October / November of last year I was looking), but I think it was a Samsung?
2016-10-01 10:49:16	jflory7	Maybe?
2016-10-01 10:49:43	+meskarune	wierdly the wireless card support is really
2016-10-01 10:49:45	+meskarune	really ba
2016-10-01 10:49:47	+meskarune	d
2016-10-01 10:49:50	+meskarune	woops lag
2016-10-01 10:49:56	spider-mario	the pixel 2 I have for work is heavier than the macbook air it replaced
2016-10-01 10:50:03	spider-mario	(but I still like it more)
2016-10-01 10:50:14	+meskarune	my computer is so light I forget I'm even carrying with me
2016-10-01 10:50:27	ng0	I need to invest in novena board and asus c201 or something at some point, to build on those architectures.. but that'll be around 950 USD
2016-10-01 10:50:36	spider-mario	now, I’ve bought a chromebox for when I visit my parents
2016-10-01 10:50:55	spider-mario	so that I don’t have to worry about downloading 2GB of updates everytime I come
2016-10-01 10:51:16	spider-mario	and having to reboot because, of course, the kernel will be out-of-date
2016-10-01 10:51:26	jflory7	meskarune: What do you have? Wish I had something that light
2016-10-01 10:51:55	+meskarune	its an acer e3 111 cowa
2016-10-01 10:53:27	+meskarune	it doesn't have fans so it cools passively, and its very thin and light
2016-10-01 10:53:28	spider-mario	oh, I have a similar netbook
2016-10-01 10:53:41	spider-mario	ow, mine does have fans
2016-10-01 10:53:51	spider-mario	and since I got it in 2012, it has gotten a bit noisy
2016-10-01 10:54:08	spider-mario	it’s an acer aspire 756
2016-10-01 10:54:27	ng0	I think if I calculate what my consumer hardware desktop pc running almost 24/7 on 100% cpu uses in electricity, I should consider getting a server again.. it's just compiling anyway..
2016-10-01 10:57:33	+meskarune	heh
2016-10-01 11:00:34	ng0	it just won't break down.. I've sold one computer to my parents, trashed one which was no longer working i think, and then there are 4 more disassembled boards.. oO 
2016-10-01 11:00:34		[11:00]
2016-10-01 11:01:14	ng0	oh. ooh. I have an i686 board. I hope it's still working, then i can build for i686 :)
2016-10-01 11:01:21	ng0	but all the dust oO
2016-10-01 11:02:04	ng0	and it was one of those where they used super glue to attach some things, in the late 90s.
2016-10-01 11:03:40	ng0	that's just the pc speakers.. i should check it out.
2016-10-01 11:05:22	+meskarune	hehe
2016-10-01 11:05:27	+meskarune	I'd like to upgrade the ram in my netbook
2016-10-01 11:05:39	+meskarune	I think its supposed to support up to 8GB ddr3
2016-10-01 11:06:22	ng0	i used to have 128 MB ram until 2009 or something.. well no, i bought 512 MB ram in addition to that before i moved out
2016-10-01 11:06:37	spider-mario	meskarune: that’s what its specs seem to say
2016-10-01 11:06:41	spider-mario	or maybe DDR3L
2016-10-01 11:06:45	ng0	and then everything became so much cheaper so i could upgrade to $now
2016-10-01 11:06:46	spider-mario	(the low-voltage variant)
2016-10-01 11:07:04	+meskarune	right now I have 2GB of ram
2016-10-01 11:07:18	+meskarune	but I hit the limit pretty often with just a web browser open
2016-10-01 11:07:20	spider-mario	a bit tight these days, isn’t it? :|
2016-10-01 11:07:21	+meskarune	and I'm using a tiler
2016-10-01 11:07:39	+meskarune	yeah, sometimes the computer just crashes from lack of ram
2016-10-01 11:07:45	+meskarune	even 4GB would be helpful
2016-10-01 11:08:02	+meskarune	I can't complain too much though, I got this computer free
2016-10-01 11:08:28	+meskarune	and its my only working one

2016-10-01 11:08:58	+meskarune	I'm not sure, I think this computer's HD was replaced with an SSD
2016-10-01 11:09:06	+meskarune	by the previous owner
2016-10-01 11:09:14	@fsckd	Nice 
2016-10-01 11:09:25	spider-mario	the spec page on acer’s website mentions 500GB
2016-10-01 11:09:29	+meskarune	it takes a regular laptop drive though
2016-10-01 11:09:32	+meskarune	and those are very cheap
2016-10-01 11:09:50	+meskarune	I have 80GB SSD
2016-10-01 11:09:55	+meskarune	it boots very fast
2016-10-01 11:09:57	@fsckd	My netbook has 1GB of RAM.
2016-10-01 11:10:00	+meskarune	but I run out of space really often
2016-10-01 11:10:10	@fsckd	Eep
2016-10-01 11:10:18	+meskarune	fsckd: if it can be upgraded, I might have ram you could use
2016-10-01 11:10:39	ng0	i was mocked for the very slow boot time at lan parties back then :D...
2016-10-01 11:10:45	+meskarune	heh
2016-10-01 11:10:50	@fsckd	meskarune: Up to two gigabytes
2016-10-01 11:11:12	+meskarune	I think I might have an extra 2GB card from my old broken netbook
2016-10-01 11:11:27	ng0	fascinating, no on-board ethernet..
2016-10-01 11:14:14	j605	I had to unfollow all the news orgs on twitter to get a meaningful feed
2016-10-01 11:16:47	ng0	looking at this old computer:
2016-10-01 11:16:47		[11:16]
2016-10-01 11:16:47	ng0	oh my god it's full of dust!

2016-10-01 11:17:43	+meskarune	she lived on an island with all women
2016-10-01 11:18:11	+meskarune	some of them probably dated each other lol
2016-10-01 11:18:36	+meskarune	ng0: I need to clean my computers
2016-10-01 11:18:41	+meskarune	ok I going to head home I think
2016-10-01 11:18:47	+meskarune	its foggy and dark out
2016-10-01 11:18:50	+meskarune	\o
2016-10-01 11:20:17	ng0	i like laptops, i don't see the dust until i need to see it.
2016-10-01 11:21:44	spider-mario	I like being able to have the keyboard lower than the screen
2016-10-01 11:22:12	spider-mario	so that I don’t have to either type on an elevated surface or look down
2016-10-01 11:23:45	j605	Given the heating issues with my laptop I would love to have a desktop. I carry around a book just elevate my laptop and give the fans a fighting chance in cooling the laptop
2016-10-01 11:24:47	ng0	I think eoma68 or what it was is going in the right direction
2016-10-01 11:25:12	ng0	i hate the incredible amount of wasted resources i have lying around here

2016-10-02 16:02:48	+meskarune	I want to ask everyone
2016-10-02 16:02:49	+meskarune	what would you prefer as a way to submit blog posts?
2016-10-02 16:03:12	+meskarune	emailing us a text file, using git, or using a webform
2016-10-02 16:04:03	+meskarune	how do you prefer to write blogs
2016-10-02 16:04:03	+meskarune	the posts are markdown
2016-10-02 16:06:44	halosghost	personally, I'd write them in rst
2016-10-02 16:08:03	halosghost	like mdown, but better
2016-10-02 16:08:43	+meskarune	I mean, the flask site supports rst, but all the pages are simple paragaphs and links, so markdown seems fine to me
2016-10-02 16:09:06	+meskarune	and markdown has a nice code highlight support plugin
2016-10-02 16:09:16	+meskarune	so it works well with pygments
2016-10-02 16:09:44	+meskarune	I could maybe figure out how to get pygments workign with rst
2016-10-02 16:09:58	+meskarune	but I'm asking specifically about how to submit rather than formate
2016-10-02 16:10:04	halosghost	oh
2016-10-02 16:10:04		[16:10]
2016-10-02 16:10:08	+meskarune	its easy enough to use pandoc to convert
2016-10-02 16:10:18	+meskarune	so people could send me a word doc for all I care
2016-10-02 16:10:21	halosghost	yeah, I'd do email attachment

2016-10-02 16:11:55	halosghost	pygments should support rst just fine
2016-10-02 16:11:56	+meskarune	slightly broken
2016-10-02 16:12:01	halosghost	by the way
2016-10-02 16:13:09	+meskarune	halosghost: I like rst more than markdown personally, but more people know markdown, we aren't doing anything fancy with posts/pages, and markdown already works >.>
2016-10-02 16:13:19	+meskarune	I got rst to html rendering working
2016-10-02 16:13:29	+meskarune	I think it uses doc-utils or something
2016-10-02 16:13:31	halosghost	sure
2016-10-02 16:13:40	+meskarune	but I haven't tried to get pygments support yet
2016-10-02 16:13:53	+meskarune	I can do that at some point
2016-10-02 16:16:34	+meskarune	halosghost: what is the advantage to using rst for text -> html ?
2016-10-02 16:16:56	+meskarune	as far as I know, markdown and rst both handle paragraphs in the same way
2016-10-02 16:17:06	halosghost	for me, it's just a standardization thing
2016-10-02 16:17:25	halosghost	there are about 043198021943021750281940321 flavors of markdown and they all do things a little differently
2016-10-02 16:19:13	+meskarune	oh I see. ATM we just use vanilla
2016-10-02 16:20:11	halosghost	vanilla?
2016-10-02 16:20:16	+meskarune	I suppose I could add in extentions for math or whatever
2016-10-02 16:20:17	halosghost	you mean the original?
2016-10-02 16:20:20	halosghost	there's not specification for it

2016-10-02 16:23:00	+meskarune	I don't have a problem using rst, and I even already added some support for it
2016-10-02 16:23:11	halosghost	I mean, it's whatever
2016-10-02 16:23:12	+meskarune	but I think markdown is more wellknown
2016-10-02 16:23:16	halosghost	if mdown is easier, then have it be mdown
2016-10-02 16:23:29	+meskarune	its literally just plain text to html
2016-10-02 16:23:36	+meskarune	anything else I would def use rst

2016-10-03 04:53:19	+meskarune	[02:13:19] I got rst to html rendering working [02:13:19]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	+meskarune	[02:13:29] I think it uses doc-utils or something [02:13:29]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	halosghost	[02:13:31] sure [02:13:31]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	+meskarune	[02:13:40] but I haven't tried to get pygments support yet [02:13:40]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	+meskarune	[02:13:53] I can do that at some point [02:13:53]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	+meskarune	[02:16:34] halosghost: what is the advantage to using rst for text -> html ? [02:16:34]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	+meskarune	[02:16:56] as far as I know, markdown and rst both handle paragraphs in the same way [02:16:56]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	halosghost	[02:17:06] for me, it's just a standardization thing [02:17:06]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	halosghost	[02:17:25] there are about 043198021943021750281940321 flavors of markdown and they all do things a little differently [02:17:25]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	+meskarune	[02:19:13] oh I see. ATM we just use vanilla [02:19:13]

2016-10-03 04:53:19	+meskarune	[02:20:16] I suppose I could add in extentions for math or whatever [02:20:16]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	halosghost	[02:20:17] you mean the original? [02:20:17]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	halosghost	[02:20:20] there's not specification for it [02:20:20]

2016-10-03 15:48:54	 *	jflory7 can't remember fsckd's timezone :P
2016-10-03 15:49:19	fsckd	i think i'm in the same timezone as you :P
2016-10-03 15:49:29	fsckd	and it goes well :)
2016-10-03 15:49:34	fsckd	you?
2016-10-03 15:53:20	jflory7	Ah, US EST then, okay. :)
2016-10-03 15:54:32	fsckd	EDT still :P
2016-10-03 15:54:32	jflory7	I'm pretty excited, hoping to get different streams to cross soon. Hoping to help organize a virtual meetup the local Women in Computing group on my campus with the women of Open Labs Albania and FOSS Wave India in the coming month. Should be fun, hoping to iron out details soon.
2016-10-03 15:54:56	jflory7	Ahhh, the whole EST/EDT thing always gets me

2016-10-03 15:55:01	jflory7	:P
2016-10-03 15:55:01	fsckd	wow, that sounds fun and impressive
2016-10-03 15:56:06	jflory7	Hoping we can do the time zone dance to find some time that works. Lots of awesome people getting to meet each other. :D
2016-10-03 15:56:48	jflory7	Open Labs Albania is one of my favorite examples of gender diversity too
2016-10-03 15:57:06	fsckd	haven't heard of them

2016-10-03 15:58:11	jflory7	They do so many awesome things there, and nobody would ever expect it because it's a small country in an obscure part of the world - but they're doing really awesome things. :D

2016-10-04 08:11:13	Rhea	I know fourth way to succeed at work as a woman. Also there is no such thing as wage gap :]
2016-10-04 08:11:32	halosghost	…
2016-10-04 08:11:41	Rhea	I'm paid more than 90% of male population and I do what makes me happy. As a woman. :D
2016-10-04 08:12:22	APNG	I know a way to do it too, it's called manipulation
2016-10-04 08:12:23	Rhea	My way to success is: Enjoy what you're doing!
2016-10-04 08:12:26	libbies	Rhea: the wage gap is across populations, not individuals
2016-10-04 08:12:32	APNG	just because it can be done doesn't mean you should do it
2016-10-04 08:12:32	libbies	that is, women as a group
2016-10-04 08:12:36	libbies	rather than any individual person
2016-10-04 08:12:40	Rhea	APNG: I work from home, and never use webcam.
2016-10-04 08:12:59	Rhea	If that's what you're refering to...
2016-10-04 08:13:46	libbies	saying that the wage gap doesn't exist, belittles other women who make less than you do, and still make less than what men (as a group) make.
2016-10-04 08:13:51	APNG	no, I'm talking about what ppl actually do
2016-10-04 08:14:40	libbies	that said, i'm totally for manipulating management to get paid more, because fuck capitalism ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Men simply take up more scientific positions and technical positions which are better paid, while women take up on the humanitarian stuff more than men, and stuff like fashion... which pays less.
2016-10-04 08:15:34	Rhea	Hence, yes, women are generally paid less, cause they take a job that pays less.
2016-10-04 08:15:38	Rhea	Has nothing to do with gender.
2016-10-04 08:15:50	Rhea	Male teacher has just as crappy salary as female teacher.
2016-10-04 08:16:01	Rhea	Female programmer (me) has just as good salary, as male programmer.
2016-10-04 08:16:08	APNG	it also doesn't account for gender distribution within positions

2016-10-04 08:16:43	Rhea	Okay well then i would like to see your numbers.
2016-10-04 08:16:53	libbies	>> Women, on average, earn less than men in virtually every single occupation for which there is sufficient earnings data for both men and women to calculate an earnings ratio.
2016-10-04 08:17:25	libbies	it's not on a disparate-job-vs-completely-different-job basis, women compared to men doing the same work
2016-10-04 08:17:38	Rhea	Yeah it seems to be just that.

2016-10-04 08:20:50	fsckd	APNG: sure, though i may be slow to respond
2016-10-04 08:22:35	Rhea	Citing one of those links:
2016-10-04 08:22:57	Rhea	The ratio of women’s and men’s median annual earnings was 79.6 percent for full-time/year-round workers in 2015. This means the gender wage gap for full-time/year-round workers is 20.4 percent. The ratio of women’s and men’s median annual earnings did not improve significantly during the last year, and has not seen a statistically significant annual increase since 2007. If the pace of change
2016-10-04 08:22:58	Rhea	in the annual earnings ratio continues at the same rate as it has since 1960, it will take another 45 years, until 2059, for men and women to reach parity. Women’s median annual earnings in 2015 were $40,742 compared with $51,212 for men; both women’s and men’s full-time year-round earnings increased significantly between 2014 and 2015 (by 2.7 and 1.5 percent respectively).
2016-10-04 08:23:19	Rhea	Based on that it says it's comparing just average female earnings to average male earnings.
2016-10-04 08:23:34	Rhea	Does not account for different field of science for example.
2016-10-04 08:24:27	libbies	...
2016-10-04 08:24:34	Rhea	I think that I fell into some feminist trap here, i'm sorry but this is not what I was looking for in technology. I think that i'll be scared of it now...
2016-10-04 08:24:40	libbies	ok bye then
2016-10-04 08:24:41	Rhea	Why do you dot me, I did not say anything wrong.

2016-10-04 08:28:05	demize	I mean, they are sort of right, the average earnings overall aren't that interesting.
2016-10-04 08:28:21	jy2wong	I do not have time to get sucked in to this but I think a lot of the gender gap in wages comes post children
2016-10-04 08:29:19	libbies	i'm pretty sure it's just straight up systemic/institutionalized discrimination/misogyny
2016-10-04 08:29:27	jy2wong	and also I think it is worth considering why we as a society value things like fashion and nursing less than ~science~
2016-10-04 08:29:52	libbies	but again, the gender wage gap exists between women and men doing the exact same jobs, not just across jobs

2016-10-04 11:18:20	+meskarune	"The American Association of University Women (AAUW) is the nation’s leading voice promoting equity and education for women and girls."
2016-10-04 11:18:41	+meskarune	so the study was done by a feminist group,and found that on average the pay gap was more like 5-7 cents
2016-10-04 11:19:00	+meskarune	but that is for white collar work and college grads
2016-10-04 11:19:11	+meskarune	its really dependant on place, class and industry
2016-10-04 11:19:21	libbies	the wsj article i link discusses that
2016-10-04 11:19:25	+meskarune	there are many industries where the gap doesn't exist
2016-10-04 11:19:32	+meskarune	but there are plenty where it does
2016-10-04 11:19:56	+meskarune	and I think there is too much focus on white collar work
2016-10-04 11:20:03	demize	Also interesting to look into not just the industry, but also the general job groups.
2016-10-04 11:20:30	+meskarune	personally I wish people would also do more research into blue collar because more women in the US have part time or min-wage jobs
2016-10-04 11:20:40	demize	In my field women often have higher wages, though many of those happen to be bosses as well which skews the stats.
2016-10-04 11:21:15	+meskarune	idk, the point is just that its more complicated than just "there is a wage gap for all women" because there isn't actually, it is really dependant on what place/industry you can talking about
2016-10-04 11:21:35	+meskarune	s/can/are/
2016-10-04 11:22:00	demize	Definitely.
2016-10-04 11:23:02	APNG	and the wage gap doesn't necessarily manifest itself that way
2016-10-04 11:23:13	APNG	"In fact, research looking at pay changes over decades has shown that when more women enter a traditionally male field, pay within that field begins to decline."
2016-10-04 11:23:52	+meskarune	its also complicated by women leaveing the workforce for a while when they have kids
2016-10-04 11:23:59	+meskarune	and they take a hit to their careers
2016-10-04 11:24:08	+meskarune	which is a huge problem that needs to be fixed honestly

2016-10-05 00:50:31	ng0	writing my own one in some years only because I want more than lispf4 gives me, because i actually need SIEMENS-INTERLISP for this book from 1985 I have is a high goal :D

2016-10-05 00:58:17	ng0	if halosghost drops by: the reason pbpst has not reached master yet is because there's a bug with curl which also affects my recent darcs package and others. and also because starting today or tomorrow I will spent this month on priority tasks on my roadmap :)
2016-10-05 01:04:00		[00:58]
2016-10-05 01:08:43	ng0	in any case if you want to do a new release, I can test on a copy of my gentoo vm that the current version works as intended?

2016-10-05 02:49:57	tlamer	Does anybody know if there is a way to track all children of a process? Somthing like a list with PID, commands, start time, stop time...
2016-10-05 02:50:08	tlamer	?
2016-10-05 02:50:41	ng0	like what htop does with tree view?
2016-10-05 02:51:17	tlamer	ng0: but it's shows only current view...
2016-10-05 02:51:29	tlamer	ng0: I'd like to have like a history of all children...
2016-10-05 02:52:19	ng0	you could try and patch htop and upstream the patch?
2016-10-05 02:52:33	APNG	strace?
2016-10-05 02:52:44	APNG	(and parse its output?)
2016-10-05 02:53:03	tlamer	APNG: that could be an answer
2016-10-05 02:53:15	tlamer	ng0: that would be a way too
2016-10-05 02:53:19	APNG	sounds painful tho
2016-10-05 02:53:53	tlamer	I don't have time for any of that right now... But I'll think of it in the future...
2016-10-05 02:53:55	APNG	I don't think the kernel keeps track of that, so you'd have to use something like strace
2016-10-05 02:54:21	ng0	or search for a smimilar project and try to get involved. better than the forking like rabbits..
2016-10-05 02:54:21		[02:54]
2016-10-05 02:55:02	ng0	sorry, i meant forking like google chrome :)
2016-10-05 02:56:18	APNG	lol?
2016-10-05 02:57:51	ng0	have you looked at what google chrome bundles? then you'll get what I mean with 'forking like google chrome' :) I think forking is terrible when yo can fix / upstream what you have.
2016-10-05 02:58:35	Peng	soon: systemd-chrome
2016-10-05 03:00:01	Peng	bad joke <_<

2016-10-05 03:03:23	ng0	Google Chrome, not to be confused with ChromeOS
2016-10-05 03:09:00		[03:03]
2016-10-05 03:11:47	APNG	ng0, well I usually hear "google chrome is a ram hog" not "google chrome is a fork bomb"
2016-10-05 03:12:57	ng0	use the source :)
2016-10-05 03:13:56	ng0	for packaging inox, or gi ving someone a base to ocntinue on that path, I had to load 60 modules for this one package.. and you can not unbundle everything, which why fedora forked chromium iirc
2016-10-05 03:18:29	APNG	ng0, I mean, you are right that google chrome forks every time you open a new tab, and the browser UI itself is yet another fork, and every menu is another fork, and so on...
2016-10-05 03:18:41	APNG	also are we talking about 2 different kinds of forking?
2016-10-05 03:18:47	APNG	because we might be
2016-10-05 03:18:59	ng0	no
2016-10-05 03:19:15	ng0	and my sentence was clear about that.. but it's not that important.
2016-10-05 03:19:38	ng0	actually it was notclear
2016-10-05 03:19:58	APNG	are we talking about fork(3) or are we talking about github fork?
2016-10-05 03:20:21	ng0	everytime google chrome team wants to code on something, they fork it, include it in their source and just forget about it ot maybe upstream it some day
2016-10-05 03:20:27	ng0	that kind of fork.
2016-10-05 03:20:48	ng0	so google forks the world.
2016-10-05 03:21:04	APNG	ah ok
2016-10-05 03:23:14	ng0	all these forks can be confusing :) /me spoons uclibc-ng.

2016-10-08 03:17:55	jflory7	[03:58:10] Is as cold there as it is here? [03:58:10]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	jflory7	[03:58:16] We're in the 60°s [03:58:16]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	+meskarune	[04:01:52] oh, it was 70F today [04:01:52]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	+meskarune	[04:01:57] not too cold [04:01:57]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	jflory7	[04:06:33] Sounds very nice. I'm probably a little biased, almost everything up north feels cold to me after living in the south for so long. [04:06:33]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	+meskarune	[04:07:52] I feel the same heh [04:07:52]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	ng0	[16:31:36] So I am waiting for backups to finish. And while this is happening, I put 2 laptops back together, and with one I have found out I have magical grey-wizzard-hat powers. there was a magical combo I had to punch and it came back to life [16:31:36]

2016-10-08 03:17:55	alad	[16:38:39] I don't get it [16:38:39]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	alad	[16:39:22] maybe it's just me, but that table looks so backwards :/ [16:39:22]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	ng0	[16:39:55] i don't know.. i just found this magazine. i like none of them, but it's funny how the only 'pro' for iexplorer is speed... [16:39:55]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	ng0	[16:40:32] iexplorer: speed through lack of features and failures. [16:40:32]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	ng0	[16:41:20] too much pointless reading.. /me makes noodles [16:41:20]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	alad	[16:43:23] it seems to me that separating things like "speed" and "standards adherence" is arbitrary, and all the stranger how chrome points in extensibility but firefox not [16:43:23]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	ng0	[16:43:57] yup [16:43:57]

2016-10-08 03:17:55	alad	[17:04:03] it used 1.5GB for 4-5 tabs for me [17:04:03]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	alad	[17:04:10] it just gets worse by the day [17:04:10]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	APNG	[17:04:24] yes, firefox uses 1.5GB for 15 tabs for me [17:04:24]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	alad	[17:04:39] I found some gtk2 build for firefox in a repo, so I'm using that now [17:04:39]

2016-10-08 03:17:55	APNG	[20:10:48] as I found out, being an asshole protects me from, well, assholes... [20:10:48]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	APNG	[20:11:16] but I need to use it carefully. I can't be an asshole to anyone, I need to pick who I should be an asshole to [20:11:16]

2016-10-08 03:17:55	APNG	[00:20:16] right after potential food poisoning... it's always like this isn't it, you get better then you get a flu or something :P [00:20:16]

2016-10-08 07:12:14	fsckd	The meeting notes are in https://pad.riseup.net/p/aw-oct-2016.
2016-10-08 07:12:16	phrik	Title: Riseup Pad (at pad.riseup.net)
2016-10-08 07:12:20	fsckd	First, a couple of announcements.
2016-10-08 07:13:46	fsckd	We have a manual to-do system on the wiki. We're replacing that with something we clal activities.
2016-10-08 07:14:51	fsckd	The to-do system was tedious, trying to simulate a conventional issue system. Which can't be done manually. :P
2016-10-08 07:16:14	fsckd	All we need is simple tracking of what is done and what still needs work. And a place to keep notes on plans, proposals, and things to accomplish.
2016-10-08 07:17:16	fsckd	The wiki is a good place for keeping shared notes. The new activities stuff is documented here: https://archwomen.org/wiki/wiki:activities
2016-10-08 07:17:17	phrik	Title: Activities [Arch Women Wiki] (at archwomen.org)
2016-10-08 07:18:03	fsckd	(We may use one of DokuWiki's many to-do plugins for fine grained assignments. That hasn't been decided yet.)
2016-10-08 07:18:27	halosghost	cool
2016-10-08 07:19:43	fsckd	The next announcement is wiki administrators now have a tool for renaming pages. It also edits backlinks (albeit slowly). https://archwomen.org/wiki/aw-tech:dokuwiki#move_plugin
2016-10-08 07:19:44	phrik	Title: Dokuwiki [Arch Women Wiki] (at archwomen.org)
2016-10-08 07:23:00	fsckd	As announced in the August meeting, the flask site is up.
2016-10-08 07:23:28	fsckd	Need to set up git automation for deployment.
2016-10-08 07:23:42	fsckd	I think meskarune is going to do that.
2016-10-08 07:24:26	+meskarune	yeah
2016-10-08 07:24:33	+meskarune	I can this month sometime
2016-10-08 07:24:36	+meskarune	I need reminders :)
2016-10-08 07:24:55	+meskarune	we had a mini-meeting on how everything will get setup in -dev
2016-10-08 07:25:20	fsckd	yeah, ok, i'll try to remind you :)
2016-10-08 07:25:26	+meskarune	and also doing some cleanup of the git repos  like combining notes and logs from meetings into one thing
2016-10-08 07:27:05	fsckd	Sounds good.
2016-10-08 07:27:05		[07:27]
2016-10-08 07:27:17	fsckd	meskarune: you will also do that?
2016-10-08 07:28:18	+meskarune	I think I can
2016-10-08 07:28:32	+meskarune	I have a lot going on with the gov atm, but I think that is something quick
2016-10-08 07:28:44	+meskarune	I'd like to get more volunteers to help with things
2016-10-08 07:29:09	fsckd	ok, i'll put it down for you and me. if you can't do it, i'll try to.
2016-10-08 07:29:59	fsckd	meskarune: I don't understand the next agenda item. It merely says, "Events feed?"
2016-10-08 07:31:46	Mikaela	 I interpreted it as either RSS feeds describing some events or more likely ical including events like meetings and possibly other AW or anydistro-women related events which people could throw into their digital calendars and be always aware of them
2016-10-08 07:32:29	fsckd	oh, hmm, that would be nice
2016-10-08 07:33:25	<--	erdic (~erdic@unaffiliated/motley) has quit (Quit: leaving)
2016-10-08 07:33:55	+meskarune	we used to have an events list of meetings from us and other groups
2016-10-08 07:34:09	+meskarune	and things like install days or bug days or wiki cleanups
2016-10-08 07:34:39	fsckd	RSS feed?
2016-10-08 07:36:18	-->	erdic (~erdic@unaffiliated/motley) has joined #archlinux-women
2016-10-08 07:36:18	+meskarune	well the php site was using an ical file
2016-10-08 07:36:35	+meskarune	basically its a calendar and you can make them using thunderbird or any other calendar client
2016-10-08 07:36:48	+meskarune	I think there is a python module for calendars
2016-10-08 07:37:03	+meskarune	I basically just need to get a list of events for a given time period
2016-10-08 07:37:10	fsckd	Oh, so host an iCal file or display on the website?
2016-10-08 07:37:23	+meskarune	we already host an ical file
2016-10-08 07:37:36	+meskarune	on the php site we had an events list that updated using the data from the ical
2016-10-08 07:37:39	Mikaela	I think common way to handle that is registering to Google Calendar and making the calendar public and embedding it somewhere where people then copy links when it's not especially avoided. At least Ubuntu, Pirate Party Finland and HeSeta (Helsinki Seta (LGBT* organization)) do that
2016-10-08 07:37:58	+meskarune	yeah, but we don't use any google services
2016-10-08 07:38:16	fsckd	meskarune: so make an RSS feed from the iCal file?
2016-10-08 07:38:27	+meskarune	fsckd: no, just use python to make an html list
2016-10-08 07:38:41	fsckd	oh ok
2016-10-08 07:38:48	+meskarune	I mean, it might be possible to code an rss feed, but I just want to stick a list on the front page
2016-10-08 07:39:17	fsckd	ok, so a list of upcoming events on the front page
2016-10-08 07:40:13	+meskarune	yeah, and maybe a link to an ical file so people can subscribe or add to their desktop calendar
2016-10-08 07:41:36	Mikaela	would you mind linking that ical file now?
2016-10-08 07:42:05	+meskarune	I can but it is out of date
2016-10-08 07:42:05		[07:42]
2016-10-08 07:42:15	+meskarune	I used thunderbird to create it
2016-10-08 07:42:30	+meskarune	basically added ubuntu women meeings and linux chix and arch women meeting times
2016-10-08 07:42:38	Mikaela	oh, I will wait then unless the address is going to stay as the same
2016-10-08 07:46:12	+meskarune	https://archwomen.org/media/archwomen.ics
2016-10-08 07:46:16	+meskarune	thats the old file
2016-10-08 07:47:09	+meskarune	previously I just manually exported it from a desktop calendar app
2016-10-08 07:47:13	fsckd	meskarune: i want the meeting notes to be actionable. so i am marking these as TODO but i know you are busy so i am not assigning them to you. will try to find an activity to add them too. either an activity for specifically them or something more generic. i'll get back to you on that. though if you have an idea where to put them, let me know.
2016-10-08 07:47:13	+meskarune	and then parsed with php
2016-10-08 07:47:46	Mikaela	will the new file appear at same location?
2016-10-08 07:49:12	+meskarune	I have no idea
2016-10-08 07:49:32	+meskarune	but its possible. It will either be there or in /static
2016-10-08 07:49:38	Mikaela	I hope it will so if I add that now, calendar will update it and people already subscribing it will get the updates
2016-10-08 07:49:42	+meskarune	but it depends on how the flask stuff is made
2016-10-08 07:50:17	+meskarune	Mikaela: yeah, I mean, thats why I want to use calendar files, so other people can add to their own calendars
2016-10-08 07:50:38	+meskarune	but in any case when the events feed is created, it will have a link to the calendar file for people
2016-10-08 07:54:14	fsckd	cool
2016-10-08 07:54:36	fsckd	Next on the agenda is classroom. :)
2016-10-08 07:55:16	fsckd	A lot of meeting items today are for meskarune. :P
2016-10-08 07:55:40	fsckd	So there is a new PKGBUILD class being drafted.
2016-10-08 07:55:45	fsckd	https://pad.riseup.net/p/al-pkgbuild-class
2016-10-08 07:55:47	phrik	Title: Riseup Pad (at pad.riseup.net)
2016-10-08 07:56:40	fsckd	Those are the notes. Please take a look and note your suggestions or comments.
2016-10-08 07:59:23	+meskarune	yeah, we had a meeting a little while ago and got those togther
2016-10-08 07:59:23		[07:59]
2016-10-08 07:59:32	+meskarune	they need editing and suggestions
2016-10-08 07:59:40	+meskarune	the class is an intro to PKGBUILDs
2016-10-08 08:00:04	alad	I made a meaningful contribution to the draft!
2016-10-08 08:00:07	 *	alad added "emacs"
2016-10-08 08:00:11	fsckd	\o/
2016-10-08 08:02:36	fsckd	There's also been a proposal for a bash/zsh prompt class. We need someone to help coordinate that. meskarune does not have the time, and sadly neither do I.
2016-10-08 08:02:53	alad	how do you mean, "prompt class" ?
2016-10-08 08:02:57	fsckd	meskarune: did someone volunteer to teach a bash/zsh prompt class?
2016-10-08 08:03:00	ng0	I think automatic trusting an openpg key defeats the purpose of trust..
2016-10-08 08:03:13	alad	ng0: at the least they should use a long ID from upstream
2016-10-08 08:03:15	ng0	that's what the class suggest atm
2016-10-08 08:03:31	fsckd	it does?
2016-10-08 08:03:36	 *	fsckd looks
2016-10-08 08:03:40	alad	oh yeah, it might link to that kernel bug on long vs. short ids
2016-10-08 08:04:01	ng0	you might suggest using the new tofu model of gnupg
2016-10-08 08:04:31	ng0	I never trust keys of developers I just use t overify software packages from
2016-10-08 08:06:09	ng0	wait. i'm out of the loop of archlinux for years. what I said refers to manual verification of files.. and the section reads like that
2016-10-08 08:06:45	ng0	I would add something, but I don't know 2016 archlinux
2016-10-08 08:07:08	ng0	I know ~2005ish archlinux
2016-10-08 08:07:56	+meskarune	fsckd: yes, I have been emailing them, but I need someone else to keep up with it because I keep replying slowly
2016-10-08 08:08:06	fsckd	ok
2016-10-08 08:08:18	fsckd	what help do they need?
2016-10-08 08:08:23	+meskarune	alad: a class on customizing the prompt
2016-10-08 08:08:40	+meskarune	fsckd: mostly answering questions and help with the class notes
2016-10-08 08:08:48	fsckd	ahh
2016-10-08 08:10:30	alad	oh, that sounds nice
2016-10-08 08:10:42	alad	meskarune: I have 0 clue on that stuff ._.
2016-10-08 08:10:45	+meskarune	heh
2016-10-08 08:11:10	+meskarune	polyzen, CalimeroTeknik, halosghost and jy2wong have all taught classes previously
2016-10-08 08:11:15	+meskarune	and who else?
2016-10-08 08:11:32	fsckd	you :P
2016-10-08 08:11:57	ng0	damn clipboard 
2016-10-08 08:11:59	fsckd	ng0: PKGBUILDs used to verify source files using only checksums. now they can verify using GPG too. so now, checksums for verifying no error in transmission and gpg signatures for countering malicious MITM. something like that. the user building the package would have to import the key for it verify. the PKGBUILD only has the key ID to use.
2016-10-08 08:12:53	fsckd	and a url to the signature
2016-10-08 08:13:07	fsckd	example is int he PKGBUILD of cower
2016-10-08 08:13:13	fsckd	in the*
2016-10-08 08:13:25	+meskarune	you should add that stuff to the class notes
2016-10-08 08:13:32	+meskarune	;D
2016-10-08 08:14:05	+meskarune	but anways, I need to find someone to help with class coordination and specifically to talk with the person who wants to teach a prompt customization class
2016-10-08 08:14:35	ng0	so what I added is without knowing how pkgbuilds 2016 work.
2016-10-08 08:14:35		[08:14]
2016-10-08 08:14:37	+meskarune	and we have the notes for the PKGBUILD class, should be set another meeting for that?
2016-10-08 08:15:24	fsckd	may be run the notes by Allan
2016-10-08 08:15:30	CalimeroTeknik	also about keys and PKGBUILDs, the validpgpkeys=() array doesn't suffice for me, it still fails so I just --skippgpcheck
2016-10-08 08:16:19	alad	please lets not have any mention of flags like that - teach people to fix issues rather than sweep them under rug
2016-10-08 08:18:01	ntfx	think all flags should be mentioned no?
2016-10-08 08:18:40	ng0	all flags can be found in the man pages I assume.
2016-10-08 08:18:54	ntfx	think if i followed the a-z of linux admin procedures id have chucked towel in years ago
2016-10-08 08:19:15	ng0	or whereever arch keeps the documentation for pkgbuild.
2016-10-08 08:19:25	fsckd	man page and wiki :P
2016-10-08 08:19:35	fsckd	man PKGBUILD
2016-10-08 08:19:44	fsckd	and man makepkg
2016-10-08 08:20:24	fsckd	but --skippgpcheck for the user building the package, not for the person making the PKGBUILD
2016-10-08 08:20:35	fsckd	so is sort of out of scope for the class
2016-10-08 08:26:00		[08:20]
2016-10-08 08:28:01	alad	that too
2016-10-08 08:28:27	fsckd	Anything more on either of the two classes or anything related to classroom?
2016-10-08 08:31:32	alad	with the draft now having a tribute to St. Ignucius, there's no complaints from me
2016-10-08 08:32:21	fsckd	lmao
2016-10-08 08:35:08	fsckd	Okay, moving on.
2016-10-08 08:36:40	fsckd	Slowly working on styles and conventions for the Arch Women Wiki. https://archwomen.org/wiki/wiki:conventions
2016-10-08 08:36:41	phrik	Title: Conventions for Wiki Structure and Content [Arch Women Wiki] (at archwomen.org)
2016-10-08 08:37:35	fsckd	So I have a question. What should be the rules for capitalization of page titles and headers?
2016-10-08 08:37:59	fsckd	Can have something like book titles where more of the words are capitalized.
2016-10-08 08:38:55	fsckd	Or can have sentence capitalization where only the first word and words that are normally cpaitalized. e.g., like on the Arch Linux Wiki.
2016-10-08 08:39:27	fsckd	(Can also have separate rules for page titles and headers like what wikipedia does.)
2016-10-08 08:39:38	fsckd	Any suggestions?
2016-10-08 08:39:42	alad	whatever you do don't make it complicated
2016-10-08 08:39:51	alad	I'd just use regular sentence case where possible
2016-10-08 08:43:21	fsckd	Yeah, I'm leaning towards sentence case too, not sure if it is because i'm so used to it form everywhere else. :P
2016-10-08 08:43:21		[08:43]
2016-10-08 08:48:36	+meskarune	yeah, we can just do what the arch wiki does
2016-10-08 08:48:42	+meskarune	and make it easy on ourselves
2016-10-08 08:49:09	fsckd	ok
2016-10-08 08:49:19	fsckd	so sentence case
2016-10-08 08:49:40	fsckd	for both page titles and section headers?
2016-10-08 08:49:59	+meskarune	yeah, seems fine to me
2016-10-08 08:50:06	fsckd	ok
2016-10-08 08:51:30	fsckd	The next item on the agenda was going to be to start a page on styles but as I mentioned, that already happened. https://archwomen.org/wiki/wiki:conventions
2016-10-08 08:51:31	phrik	Title: Conventions for Wiki Structure and Content [Arch Women Wiki] (at archwomen.org)
2016-10-08 08:52:07	fsckd	That brings to the last items of the meeting.
2016-10-08 08:53:29	fsckd	For mentorship, make an email address mentor@archwomen.org.  I think meskarune can do that? Also, what will the email be used for?
2016-10-08 08:54:00	+meskarune	for people to contact us about getting a mentor
2016-10-08 08:54:42	fsckd	Ok, who has access to it?
2016-10-08 09:00:00		[08:54]
2016-10-08 09:02:00	fsckd	Ok, may be can discuss that at a later date. The important thing is to note that an email for contact is to be made.
2016-10-08 09:02:33	fsckd	Next is creating a signup page for mentors and mentees.
2016-10-08 09:03:13	<--	AllieCat (~AllieCat@cpe-174-109-245-150.nc.res.rr.com) has quit (Quit: Mew? =^^=)
2016-10-08 09:03:46	alad	I probably lost my account again <.<
2016-10-08 09:03:52	fsckd	I think meskarune will need help for that, considering limits on time.
2016-10-08 09:04:18	fsckd	If anyone would like to volunteer, please contact her.
2016-10-08 09:05:28	fsckd	We'll need to decide what information we'll get from potential mentors and mentees. I was to post an email about that. I've been a little distracted. I have a draft which I'll work on. I'll try to get it out this next week.
2016-10-08 09:05:37	fsckd	May be start an activity page for it.
2016-10-08 09:06:50	ng0	did I miss the ending? else I'll just keep this laptop running and use the other for the thing I have to do now
2016-10-08 09:06:59	fsckd	Almost over.
2016-10-08 09:07:14	fsckd	That was the last item on the meeting agenda.
2016-10-08 09:07:31	fsckd	Now any final comments, concerns, questions?
2016-10-08 09:07:53	alad	Allan broke it.
2016-10-08 09:07:55	alad	otherwise, none
2016-10-08 09:07:59	fsckd	lol

2016-10-08 09:09:58	fsckd	Ok, I guess that's it.

2016-10-08 09:19:41	fsckd	alad: smart filter doesn't affect logs
2016-10-08 09:19:48	alad	well, that sucks
2016-10-08 09:19:57	ng0	smart filter is 100 levels above what I use
2016-10-08 09:20:17	alad	fsckd: I guess Alt+L should still work ?
2016-10-08 09:20:44	ng0	that would require the presence of weechat I assume.

2016-10-08 09:27:31	APNG	or w/e
2016-10-08 09:27:37	APNG	I guess you need to escape that #
2016-10-08 09:30:34	ng0	I'd like an application where all is in one view, more or less, and you can just /j to channels to speak, or even address them directly by just writing them.. more or less similar to some basic features of what I have when I use psyced with telnet
2016-10-08 09:31:54	 *	ng0 hi
2016-10-08 09:32:04	ng0	no idea..
2016-10-08 09:32:34	ng0	problem, i can't even distinguish a failed ACTION from just a written ACTION :D

2016-10-08 09:36:25	APNG	or /me ACTIONHERE?
2016-10-08 09:37:02	fsckd	ii only sends privmsgs? cna you send a notice to the channel?
2016-10-08 09:37:27	ng0	I find "/" bad.. I like :me from telnet..
2016-10-08 09:37:33	APNG	fsckd, maybe with /notice or /raw or something
2016-10-08 09:37:53	APNG	ng0, ":me"...

2016-10-08 09:38:07	--	Notice(alad): foo bar baz bing bong boom
2016-10-08 09:39:01	ng0	idk... in theory every raw irc command works, but privmsg + channel communication are /j and then echo blaaaa >> in

2016-10-08 09:55:53	ng0	but that's not idn.. outside of spoken language it's also used in maths etc.. so I think it should just work as it is.

2016-10-08 13:42:11	ng0	so i am almost constantly thinking about what I work on, reviewing it, getting smaller and more defined roadmap goals
2016-10-08 13:42:11	ng0	.. and I think I should make my system/project more independent from secushare.. I mean it already is, but should be more usable to everyone.
2016-10-08 13:42:11	ng0	interchange the applications it should ship with, etc. not just the system integration of a limited set of applications I happen to work in at the moment.
2016-10-08 13:44:48	ng0	I mean I hope now that they reflected on overperfectionism and a change of plans, that there will happen more work around secushare,
2016-10-08 13:44:48	ng0	but I also know that the development team must grow.

2016-10-09 00:27:18	ntfx	[20:22:05] thats me [20:22:05]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ng0	[20:42:18] :O 54 USD for patches and stickers because of shipping.. hrm. but there are presents I found included. difficult :D [20:42:18]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ntfx	[20:44:20] expensive [20:44:20]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ng0	[20:45:58] but but cute stickers and patches for friends and especially for my friend who will be here in some months again :) but we don't like material stuff etc, but occasionally this is fun :) [20:45:58]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ng0	[20:46:48] I will question this decision again when it arrives here I guess. sometimes you just have to do weird selfcare. semi-impulsively buy stuff because oh, look a cute panda :) [20:46:48]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ntfx	[20:48:02] yeah, treats are always fun, they do look cool [20:48:02]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ng0	[20:50:23] US dollar got stronger.. it's almost 1:1 today [20:50:23]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ntfx	[20:50:39] you looked online for closer purchase of the patches? [20:50:39]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ng0	[20:51:18] looks like a very US centric thing. it's okay for me [20:51:18]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ng0	[20:52:18] I mean, if I wanted to print batches of 100 or 1000, I could let them be re-created here locally. [20:52:18]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ng0	[20:52:38] but that's more than 50 euro then :D [20:52:38]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ntfx	[20:53:49] iv only used euros once lol [20:53:49]

2016-10-09 00:27:18	spider-mario	[20:59:01] ha ha ::D [20:59:01]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	spider-mario	[20:59:10] hm, just one : will do [20:59:10]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	spider-mario	[20:59:11] :D [20:59:11]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	jflory7	[21:23:27] spider-mario: The scariest thing to me is when people try to justify it [21:23:27]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	jflory7	[21:23:45] Wake me up after November [21:23:45]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	fsckd	[21:28:23] jflory7: no worries, you can comment on any topic from the meeting at any time :) [21:28:23]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ng0	[21:30:42] If you're a Tor user then you've probably seen enough Cloudflare CAPTCHA to last you a lifetime. To help remedy this, you can access my website using this onion address [21:30:42]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ng0	[21:30:43] so true, so true.... :D [21:30:43]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	jflory7	[21:33:48] fsckd: Thanks - going to try catching up on the logs soon. [21:33:48]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ng0	[22:28:28] so letsencrypt.. not even this 16 years without ssl goth dating platform has it now, even ccc.de uses it now.. ccc had a certificate, [22:28:28]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ng0	[22:28:28]  but the admins were probably a team of lazy pandas all the years. [22:28:28]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ntfx	[22:34:23] goth dating [22:34:23]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	APNG	[22:43:35] I take it they're using md5 at best [22:43:35]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	APNG	[22:43:39] but probably plaintext [22:43:39]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	APNG	[22:43:53] not that it matters - it's already being sent as plaintext [22:43:53]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ng0	[22:50:44] iirc their security policy was don't ask, don't request, don't bother us, just be silent [22:50:44]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ng0	[22:50:52] I'm not making that up. [22:50:52]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	demize	[22:54:33] fsckd: If you wanted to emphasize the "very much" part you could say "jätte mycket", but that works as is. [22:54:33]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	 *	demize [22:54:49] just got home [22:54:49]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	fsckd	[23:07:05] demize: oh thanks, so "Tack så jätte mycket!" ? [23:07:05]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	demize	[23:07:47] Actually "Tack så jättemycket!", but yeah. [23:07:47]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	fsckd	[23:08:02] ahh thanks [23:08:02]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	demize	[23:08:09] It works with just mycket too, but then it's not "very much". [23:08:09]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	demize	[23:08:11] ❤ [23:08:11]

CDU is a conservative-christian right party always very close to the political right, not just recently. [23:21:46]

2016-10-09 00:27:18	ng0	[23:22:28] one right too much though: conservative-christian. [23:22:28]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	APNG	[23:34:07] ng0, we need to pass a law forcing everyone to publicly disclose their password hashing [23:34:07]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ng0	[23:42:11] so i am almost constantly thinking about what I work on, reviewing it, getting smaller and more defined roadmap goals [23:42:11]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ng0	[23:42:11] .. and I think I should make my system/project more independent from secushare.. I mean it already is, but should be more usable to everyone. [23:42:11]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ng0	[23:42:11] interchange the applications it should ship with, etc. not just the system integration of a limited set of applications I happen to work in at the moment. [23:42:11]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ng0	[23:44:48] I mean I hope now that they reflected on overperfectionism and a change of plans, that there will happen more work around secushare, [23:44:48]
2016-10-09 00:27:18	ng0	[23:44:48] but I also know that the development team must grow. [23:44:48]

2016-10-09 17:39:17	ntfx	[20:22:05] thats me [20:22:05]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	ng0	[20:42:18] :O 54 USD for patches and stickers because of shipping.. hrm. but there are presents I found included. difficult :D [20:42:18]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	ntfx	[20:44:20] expensive [20:44:20]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	ng0	[20:45:58] but but cute stickers and patches for friends and especially for my friend who will be here in some months again :) but we don't like material stuff etc, but occasionally this is fun :) [20:45:58]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	ng0	[20:46:48] I will question this decision again when it arrives here I guess. sometimes you just have to do weird selfcare. semi-impulsively buy stuff because oh, look a cute panda :) [20:46:48]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	ntfx	[20:48:02] yeah, treats are always fun, they do look cool [20:48:02]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	ng0	[20:50:23] US dollar got stronger.. it's almost 1:1 today [20:50:23]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	ntfx	[20:50:39] you looked online for closer purchase of the patches? [20:50:39]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	ng0	[20:51:18] looks like a very US centric thing. it's okay for me [20:51:18]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	ng0	[20:52:18] I mean, if I wanted to print batches of 100 or 1000, I could let them be re-created here locally. [20:52:18]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	ng0	[20:52:38] but that's more than 50 euro then :D [20:52:38]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	ntfx	[20:53:49] iv only used euros once lol [20:53:49]

2016-10-09 17:39:17	ng0	[21:30:43] so true, so true.... :D [21:30:43]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	jflory7	[21:33:48] fsckd: Thanks - going to try catching up on the logs soon. [21:33:48]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	ng0	[22:28:28] so letsencrypt.. not even this 16 years without ssl goth dating platform has it now, even ccc.de uses it now.. ccc had a certificate, [22:28:28]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	ng0	[22:28:28]  but the admins were probably a team of lazy pandas all the years. [22:28:28]

2016-10-09 17:39:17	APNG	[22:43:35] I take it they're using md5 at best [22:43:35]

2016-10-09 17:39:17	APNG	[22:43:53] not that it matters - it's already being sent as plaintext [22:43:53]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	ng0	[22:50:44] iirc their security policy was don't ask, don't request, don't bother us, just be silent [22:50:44]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	ng0	[22:50:52] I'm not making that up. [22:50:52]

2016-10-09 17:39:17	demize	[23:07:47] Actually "Tack så jättemycket!", but yeah. [23:07:47]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	fsckd	[23:08:02] ahh thanks [23:08:02]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	demize	[23:08:09] It works with just mycket too, but then it's not "very much". [23:08:09]

2016-10-09 17:39:17	ng0	[23:42:11] .. and I think I should make my system/project more independent from secushare.. I mean it already is, but should be more usable to everyone. [23:42:11]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	ng0	[23:42:11] interchange the applications it should ship with, etc. not just the system integration of a limited set of applications I happen to work in at the moment. [23:42:11]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	ng0	[23:44:48] I mean I hope now that they reflected on overperfectionism and a change of plans, that there will happen more work around secushare, [23:44:48]
2016-10-09 17:39:17	ng0	[23:44:48] but I also know that the development team must grow. [23:44:48]

2016-10-10 01:19:59	ntfx	[20:50:39] you looked online for closer purchase of the patches? [20:50:39]
2016-10-10 01:19:59	ng0	[20:51:18] looks like a very US centric thing. it's okay for me [20:51:18]
2016-10-10 01:19:59	ng0	[20:52:18] I mean, if I wanted to print batches of 100 or 1000, I could let them be re-created here locally. [20:52:18]
2016-10-10 01:19:59	ng0	[20:52:38] but that's more than 50 euro then :D [20:52:38]

2016-10-10 01:19:59	jflory7	[21:23:45] Wake me up after November [21:23:45]
2016-10-10 01:19:59	fsckd	[21:28:23] jflory7: no worries, you can comment on any topic from the meeting at any time :) [21:28:23]

2016-10-10 01:19:59	ng0	[21:30:43] so true, so true.... :D [21:30:43]
2016-10-10 01:19:59	jflory7	[21:33:48] fsckd: Thanks - going to try catching up on the logs soon. [21:33:48]
2016-10-10 01:19:59	ng0	[22:28:28] so letsencrypt.. not even this 16 years without ssl goth dating platform has it now, even ccc.de uses it now.. ccc had a certificate, [22:28:28]
2016-10-10 01:19:59	ng0	[22:28:28]  but the admins were probably a team of lazy pandas all the years. [22:28:28]

2016-10-10 01:19:59	APNG	[22:43:35] I take it they're using md5 at best [22:43:35]

2016-10-10 01:19:59	APNG	[22:43:53] not that it matters - it's already being sent as plaintext [22:43:53]
2016-10-10 01:19:59	ng0	[22:50:44] iirc their security policy was don't ask, don't request, don't bother us, just be silent [22:50:44]
2016-10-10 01:19:59	ng0	[22:50:52] I'm not making that up. [22:50:52]
2016-10-10 01:19:59	demize	[22:54:33] fsckd: If you wanted to emphasize the "very much" part you could say "jätte mycket", but that works as is. [22:54:33]

2016-10-10 01:19:59	demize	[23:07:47] Actually "Tack så jättemycket!", but yeah. [23:07:47]
2016-10-10 01:19:59	fsckd	[23:08:02] ahh thanks [23:08:02]
2016-10-10 01:19:59	demize	[23:08:09] It works with just mycket too, but then it's not "very much". [23:08:09]

CDU is a conservative-christian right party always very close to the political right, not just recently. [23:21:46]

2016-10-10 01:19:59	APNG	[23:34:07] ng0, we need to pass a law forcing everyone to publicly disclose their password hashing [23:34:07]
2016-10-10 01:19:59	ng0	[23:42:11] so i am almost constantly thinking about what I work on, reviewing it, getting smaller and more defined roadmap goals [23:42:11]
2016-10-10 01:19:59	ng0	[23:42:11] .. and I think I should make my system/project more independent from secushare.. I mean it already is, but should be more usable to everyone. [23:42:11]
2016-10-10 01:19:59	ng0	[23:42:11] interchange the applications it should ship with, etc. not just the system integration of a limited set of applications I happen to work in at the moment. [23:42:11]
2016-10-10 01:19:59	ng0	[23:44:48] I mean I hope now that they reflected on overperfectionism and a change of plans, that there will happen more work around secushare, [23:44:48]
2016-10-10 01:19:59	ng0	[23:44:48] but I also know that the development team must grow. [23:44:48]

2016-10-10 04:55:49	ng0	[14:33:20] so sdf.... I would not recommend trying to get anything done with them, in communication. I've taken the last payment to paypal and even then the reaction was 'account deleted' [14:33:20]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	ng0	[14:34:43] for guix I had one font hosted there because upstream is broken.. but.. what the... who does that. that's like, my car is broken. oh... now my car exploded because you didn't mention the unspoken dynamite. well it solves the problem. the problem is now completely gone [14:34:43]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	ng0	[14:36:52] who are they, the napoleon dynamite of problem solvers? [14:36:52]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	fsckd	[14:38:34] i saw really bad behaviour from sdf-eu a decade ago. they were more interested in getting money and creating petty drama than giving a good service. i do not recommend them to anyone. [14:38:34]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	ng0	[14:43:22] well I don't see a way to get the previously paid 35 usd back, but the 10 usd now will be solved by paypal I hope. [14:43:22]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	ng0	[14:44:12] It's not like I created drama, I was polite all the time and also wrote that there's software mirrored at that account. [14:44:12]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	ng0	[14:44:40] guess some projects age terribly when they are run by just a tiny power-hungry admin team :) [14:44:40]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	fsckd	[14:45:45] i didn't mean you made drama. the guy who ran the place then, i forget his name, would bad mouth people behind their back [14:45:45]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	ng0	[14:46:39] I understood that [14:46:39]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	fsckd	[14:46:54] oh, sorry  [14:46:54]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	ng0	[14:47:37] that seems to be quiet common at mostly-power-hungry teams. I was told the same at gentoo when I was trying to communicate and get information. [14:47:37]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	fsckd	[14:48:05] yikes :( [14:48:05]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	ng0	[14:49:10] well I was angry, ranted much about gentoo, but the fact that we are now inofficially in gentoo and officially serving the gnunet related ebuilds via a gnunet.org hosted overlay/repository is something I consider 'done' for the moment. [14:49:10]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	fsckd	[14:49:38] cool [14:49:38]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	ng0	[14:50:07] no one has taken my offer to get in touch with me with a polite developer and let me work the way I want (collectively, not one-person-maintainership).. so this is official for me. [14:50:07]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	ng0	[14:52:05] I reflected and discussed about some things in the last days.. yesterday I decided I need to start again with music. do it 50:50 with the other projects, because I really miss that. music project went dormant with the unfinished guitar tracks, now I want to explore coded music, generated music, and electronic hardware etc.. [14:52:05]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	fsckd	[14:53:27] sorry that you lost money with sdf. :/ [14:53:27]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	ng0	[14:53:30] I found this new york monthly music hackathon, and in the plenum/meeting in some hours I'll suggest this for the hackerspace I started going to. there is a repeating saturday we have the location for but there's no programm [14:53:30]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	fsckd	[14:53:36] what kind of generated music? [14:53:36]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	fsckd	[14:54:45] i think some people in here are into music like noise and drone [14:54:45]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	ng0	[14:55:00] it's all new grounds for me :) when it comes to electronic music, I'm into a broad range of soundscapes, but mostly drone, ambient, noise, that kind of thing [14:55:00]
2016-10-10 04:55:49	fsckd	[14:55:11] oh nice [14:55:11]

2016-10-10 04:56:35	ng0	[14:33:20] so sdf.... I would not recommend trying to get anything done with them, in communication. I've taken the last payment to paypal and even then the reaction was 'account deleted' [14:33:20]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	ng0	[14:34:43] for guix I had one font hosted there because upstream is broken.. but.. what the... who does that. that's like, my car is broken. oh... now my car exploded because you didn't mention the unspoken dynamite. well it solves the problem. the problem is now completely gone [14:34:43]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	ng0	[14:36:52] who are they, the napoleon dynamite of problem solvers? [14:36:52]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	fsckd	[14:38:34] i saw really bad behaviour from sdf-eu a decade ago. they were more interested in getting money and creating petty drama than giving a good service. i do not recommend them to anyone. [14:38:34]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	ng0	[14:43:22] well I don't see a way to get the previously paid 35 usd back, but the 10 usd now will be solved by paypal I hope. [14:43:22]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	ng0	[14:44:12] It's not like I created drama, I was polite all the time and also wrote that there's software mirrored at that account. [14:44:12]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	ng0	[14:44:40] guess some projects age terribly when they are run by just a tiny power-hungry admin team :) [14:44:40]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	fsckd	[14:45:45] i didn't mean you made drama. the guy who ran the place then, i forget his name, would bad mouth people behind their back [14:45:45]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	ng0	[14:46:39] I understood that [14:46:39]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	fsckd	[14:46:54] oh, sorry  [14:46:54]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	ng0	[14:47:37] that seems to be quiet common at mostly-power-hungry teams. I was told the same at gentoo when I was trying to communicate and get information. [14:47:37]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	fsckd	[14:48:05] yikes :( [14:48:05]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	ng0	[14:49:10] well I was angry, ranted much about gentoo, but the fact that we are now inofficially in gentoo and officially serving the gnunet related ebuilds via a gnunet.org hosted overlay/repository is something I consider 'done' for the moment. [14:49:10]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	fsckd	[14:49:38] cool [14:49:38]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	ng0	[14:50:07] no one has taken my offer to get in touch with me with a polite developer and let me work the way I want (collectively, not one-person-maintainership).. so this is official for me. [14:50:07]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	ng0	[14:52:05] I reflected and discussed about some things in the last days.. yesterday I decided I need to start again with music. do it 50:50 with the other projects, because I really miss that. music project went dormant with the unfinished guitar tracks, now I want to explore coded music, generated music, and electronic hardware etc.. [14:52:05]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	fsckd	[14:53:27] sorry that you lost money with sdf. :/ [14:53:27]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	ng0	[14:53:30] I found this new york monthly music hackathon, and in the plenum/meeting in some hours I'll suggest this for the hackerspace I started going to. there is a repeating saturday we have the location for but there's no programm [14:53:30]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	fsckd	[14:53:36] what kind of generated music? [14:53:36]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	fsckd	[14:54:45] i think some people in here are into music like noise and drone [14:54:45]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	ng0	[14:55:00] it's all new grounds for me :) when it comes to electronic music, I'm into a broad range of soundscapes, but mostly drone, ambient, noise, that kind of thing [14:55:00]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	fsckd	[14:55:11] oh nice [14:55:11]
2016-10-10 04:56:35	***	Playback Complete.
2016-10-10 04:57:10	ng0	my guitar tracks I left were like these 15 - 20 minute songs similar to 'the angelic process', 'cult of luna', sun o etc.. if we wouldn't have chosen that path, and just explored the meditative raw drone stuff we did for 6 month, that would've worked out I think

2016-10-10 21:19:43	alad	[19:46:38] hi - what broke [19:46:38]

2016-10-10 21:19:43	fsckd	[19:46:52] :P [19:46:52]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	jflory7	[19:49:42] fsckd: How goes your day? Or evening... or maybe morning... [19:49:42]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	fsckd	[19:50:28] 3:50 here, so still afternoon. ;) [19:50:28]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	fsckd	[19:51:37] i am taking care of someone who is not well. just finished a late lunch. i have my laptop on  the couch and i'm stitting on the floor. am about to go and do some more stuff in the kitchen. [19:51:37]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	fsckd	[19:51:39] you? [19:51:39]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	jflory7	[19:51:47] fsckd: Oh, we're in the same time zone. I feel like there's a high ratio of people in this channel that are US EST. That, or that's always the people I'm talking to. [19:51:47]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	jflory7	[19:52:34] fsckd: Hope your friend gets to feeling better soon. I'm in my quiet spot at a local coffee shop to do some work this afternoon. Going to make the most out of the rest of today! [19:52:34]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	fsckd	[19:53:45] thanks. :D [19:53:45]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	fsckd	[19:54:00] sounds like you have a relaxing place to do work :D [19:54:00]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	jflory7	[20:04:56] fsckd: Yes, it's my favorite place in Rochester... took me forever to find this place, but it's the best coffee I've had on the entire US east coast hands-down [20:04:56]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	jflory7	[20:05:23] And coming from me, that's a compliment I'm not so easily giving of. :) [20:05:23]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	fsckd	[20:08:43] haha, awesome. enjoy, im afkish. :) [20:08:43]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	ng0	[22:08:54] hi [22:08:54]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	alad	[22:09:04] o/ [22:09:04]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	ng0	[22:13:36] I know I'm talking about secushare and gnunet much, but if someone is looking to join a team to hack on, I've talked to one of the developers of happyhydro today at the hackerspace, nice project but they also need support, funding and more people to work on it :) [22:13:36]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	ng0	[22:14:45] http://www.happyhydro.org/ website needs to be renew though, hopefully it'll happen soon. broken links in the blog, presentations aren't uploaded yet etc [22:14:45]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	phrik	[22:14:47] Title: HappyHydro » Startseite (at www.happyhydro.org) [22:14:47]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	ng0	[22:15:06] i just noticed it's german only too [22:15:06]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	ng0	[22:15:51] but.. well, use google translate. nice project for distributed social applications. no source release yet as they split up some code and move to libraries etc [22:15:51]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	alad	[22:17:36] sounds like you'd need some solid qualifications [22:17:36]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	ng0	[22:18:25] written in C as far as I remember my chat with the dev [22:18:25]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	ng0	[22:20:40] but yeah that's just the language.. there's also scrypt, libgcrypt etc involved [22:20:40]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	ng0	[22:20:54] possibly easier to ask in email :) [22:20:54]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	ng0	[22:27:48] I mean gnunet looks very solid demanding too (and the employees are in general post-master/doctor degree), but you can still get lowlevel tasks done and fixed :) [22:27:48]
2016-10-10 21:19:43	ng0	[22:28:32] published source would help.. I hope next time the developer is there again so I can give them feedback [22:28:32]

2016-10-11 22:28:41	+meskarune	[02:36:36] it sounds like a constipation drug to me ¯\_(シ)_/¯ [02:36:36]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	+meskarune	[02:37:00] but a lot of words sound weird when you say them out loud and remove context [02:37:00]

2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:34:32] Hello there! I've tried to install arch yesterday but without succsess... [07:34:32]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:34:53] The setup I wanted to have: [07:34:53]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:35:03] UEFI boot, LVM on top of LUKS [07:35:03]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:35:18] The installation went fine... [07:35:18]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:35:29] I've added encrypt and lvm2 hooks [07:35:29]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:35:46] added cryptdevice into /etc/default/grub [07:35:46]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:35:56] regenerated initramfs, grub.cfg [07:35:56]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:36:05] after reboot [07:36:05]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:36:35] Grub showed up, and after trying to boot into system It got stuck just after Loading initramfs... [07:36:35]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:36:45] I tried that several times [07:36:45]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:37:08] I mean to install the system. Without luks and lvm everything went fine and system has booted... [07:37:08]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:37:20] I tried that even on a different machine and was succesful [07:37:20]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:37:31] So I suspect the problem is in my machine [07:37:31]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:37:43] It's Lenovo T430s [07:37:43]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:37:53] with discrete intel graphics [07:37:53]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:38:53] Any ideas what could went wrong? [07:38:53]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:43:10] I can't figure it out... As I said I even tried the same installation steps (with lvm on luks) on a different machine and there it worked... [07:43:10]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:43:51] Partitioning looked like this: [07:43:51]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:44:15] sda1 /boot/efi [07:44:15]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:44:19] sda2 /boot [07:44:19]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:44:45] sda3 LUKS and LVM physical volume [07:44:45]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:45:05] logical volumes: swap, /root, /var, home [07:45:05]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:45:55] I also tried similar configuration with fedora 24 and it worked without problems... [07:45:55]
2016-10-11 22:28:41	tlamer	[07:46:04] What did I miss? [07:46:04]

2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:34:32] Hello there! I've tried to install arch yesterday but without succsess... [07:34:32]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:34:53] The setup I wanted to have: [07:34:53]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:35:03] UEFI boot, LVM on top of LUKS [07:35:03]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:35:18] The installation went fine... [07:35:18]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:35:29] I've added encrypt and lvm2 hooks [07:35:29]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:35:46] added cryptdevice into /etc/default/grub [07:35:46]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:35:56] regenerated initramfs, grub.cfg [07:35:56]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:36:05] after reboot [07:36:05]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:36:35] Grub showed up, and after trying to boot into system It got stuck just after Loading initramfs... [07:36:35]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:36:45] I tried that several times [07:36:45]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:37:08] I mean to install the system. Without luks and lvm everything went fine and system has booted... [07:37:08]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:37:20] I tried that even on a different machine and was succesful [07:37:20]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:37:31] So I suspect the problem is in my machine [07:37:31]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:37:43] It's Lenovo T430s [07:37:43]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:37:53] with discrete intel graphics [07:37:53]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:38:53] Any ideas what could went wrong? [07:38:53]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:43:10] I can't figure it out... As I said I even tried the same installation steps (with lvm on luks) on a different machine and there it worked... [07:43:10]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:43:51] Partitioning looked like this: [07:43:51]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:44:15] sda1 /boot/efi [07:44:15]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:44:19] sda2 /boot [07:44:19]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:44:45] sda3 LUKS and LVM physical volume [07:44:45]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:45:05] logical volumes: swap, /root, /var, home [07:45:05]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:45:55] I also tried similar configuration with fedora 24 and it worked without problems... [07:45:55]
2016-10-11 23:19:29	tlamer	[07:46:04] What did I miss? [07:46:04]

2016-10-12 14:44:18	libbies	[19:44:48] in fact, i strongly suspect it can only make things worse [19:44:48]
2016-10-12 14:44:18	APNG	[19:44:54] uh... [19:44:54]
2016-10-12 14:44:18	Peng	[19:45:06] for one thing it's probably on an FBI watchlist [19:45:06]
2016-10-12 14:44:18	APNG	[19:45:10] guess I'm the only person who likes to annoy annoying ppl... [19:45:10]
2016-10-12 14:44:18	libbies	[19:45:17] yeah don't do that [19:45:17]
2016-10-12 14:44:18	libbies	[19:45:31] in practice, that only escalates things [19:45:31]

2016-10-12 14:44:18	ng0	[19:49:34] I just feel like I need to correct something.. because I gave 0 bleeps about their discussion on cp, I just wanted to add another example. and this person replied to just a tiny paragraph. [19:49:34]
2016-10-12 14:44:18	ng0	[19:51:26] but that's probably also what he wants me to do, no matter the 'this is not the right place to discuss this.' addition in his answer [19:51:26]
2016-10-12 14:44:18	APNG	[19:51:29] (I usually do it to protect ppl from trolls, I mean) [19:51:29]
2016-10-12 14:44:18	ng0	[19:54:24] I think the best way is to see if there will come more in the future.. if so I can discuss it in private with the person in charge of the mailinglist. I won't answer, which more or less is what he wanted too. -.- [19:54:24]
2016-10-12 14:44:18	ng0	[19:56:55] oh deity.. i think i've found a profile and know why i got this reply.. no, this person is just flat out too boring to engage in any sort of discussion with... [19:56:55]
2016-10-12 14:44:18	APNG	[19:57:22] I should go eat [19:57:22]

2016-10-12 16:07:12	ng0	[19:40:29] that's all. [19:40:29]
2016-10-12 16:07:12	alad	[19:41:11] ng0: >in a project I'm in [19:41:11]
2016-10-12 16:07:12	APNG	[19:41:15] ng0, send them this way: https://reallifevslogic.tumblr.com/ [19:41:15]
2016-10-12 16:07:12	alad	[19:41:15] ng0: so that means you can ban them, right ? [19:41:15]

2016-10-12 16:07:12	APNG	[19:41:24] (don't click it) [19:41:24]
2016-10-12 16:07:12	ng0	[19:41:40] you will see the limitations of free speech when you are served a court order on a particular paragraph in germany. [19:41:40]
2016-10-12 16:07:12	Peng	[19:42:05] ...I clicked it already [19:42:05]
2016-10-12 16:07:12	APNG	[19:42:25] Peng, don't engage them, then [19:42:25]
2016-10-12 16:07:12	alad	[19:43:01] ng0: considering that particular paragraph incites to violence it probably makes sense [19:43:01]
2016-10-12 16:07:12	ng0	[19:43:07] no. it's the public help list.. and this was addressed at myself and they took a very small section of an reply I gave independent from almost everything which happened between OP and the ones afterwards [19:43:07]
2016-10-12 16:07:12	libbies	[19:43:11] APNG: o_O [19:43:11]
2016-10-12 16:07:12	alad	[19:44:03] I guess I'm guessing on the particular paragraph you mean [19:44:03]
2016-10-12 16:07:12	libbies	[19:44:11] APNG: i strongly disagree with the spirit of some of those posts [19:44:11]
2016-10-12 16:07:12	APNG	[19:44:20] it's a good resource to have to send to ppl you dislike... [19:44:20]
2016-10-12 16:07:12	libbies	[19:44:38] i don't see how [19:44:38]

2016-10-12 16:07:12	libbies	[19:44:48] in fact, i strongly suspect it can only make things worse [19:44:48]
2016-10-12 16:07:12	APNG	[19:44:54] uh... [19:44:54]
2016-10-12 16:07:12	Peng	[19:45:06] for one thing it's probably on an FBI watchlist [19:45:06]
2016-10-12 16:07:12	APNG	[19:45:10] guess I'm the only person who likes to annoy annoying ppl... [19:45:10]
2016-10-12 16:07:12	libbies	[19:45:17] yeah don't do that [19:45:17]

2016-10-13 14:31:03	ng0	[22:41:06] thanks for trying [22:41:06]
2016-10-13 14:31:03	ng0	[23:00:07] when I start using the new gnupg key which I possibly will create on 31.10, I should add an uid containing 'this is deprecated' to the ones found on the keyserver.. just got another one to my rsa key.. sigh [23:00:07]
2016-10-13 14:31:03	APNG	[23:03:22] "another one"? [23:03:22]

2016-10-13 14:31:03	ng0	[23:06:33] a message.. I think trying to be backwards compatible was a mistake. I have ec and rsa keys provided, but everyone is stuck on rsa... no, I still need it for conversations sadly. people using debian and slackware. but I think I'll do the next release of gnurl with just a new key, no more rsa. [23:06:33]
2016-10-13 14:31:03	ng0	[23:08:07] so now I can't read this email... I hate gnupg. [23:08:07]

2016-10-13 14:31:03	ng0	[23:15:49] I could try to extract the openpg part from the message.. apple mail adds some lines before [23:15:49]

2016-10-13 14:31:03	ng0	[23:22:52] that's also what the mails in a conversation with someone else are showing [23:22:52]
2016-10-13 14:31:03	ng0	[23:22:58] and I can decrypt those [23:22:58]
2016-10-13 14:31:03	ng0	[23:23:02] so i blame crapple [23:23:02]
2016-10-13 14:31:03	ng0	[23:25:53] but there is no rush to anwer this email, so I think I should just ask the gnupg-users list [23:25:53]

2016-10-14 17:25:54	ng0	[23:41:19] I'm still looking for orientation..

2016-10-14 17:25:54	APNG	[23:43:43] ng0, cool I think [23:43:43]
2016-10-14 17:25:54	ng0	[23:43:45] I tend to think more towards beatless, low frequencies noise/drone/experimental music because finding musicians to play with tuned out to be very hard last time [23:43:45]
2016-10-14 17:25:54	APNG	[23:43:55] what you said, at least - didn't watch the video [23:43:55]
2016-10-14 17:25:54	ng0	[23:45:32] I'll still not be able to sell my old amplifier(s) and boxes.. tried for years, they might still be out there somewhere for offer, but no one is interested in analogue anymore. it's all digital now. [23:45:32]
2016-10-14 17:25:54	ng0	[23:46:16] even a local shop didn't want them for commision because my price did not suit their expectations [23:46:16]

2016-10-14 17:25:54	ng0	[00:00:55] I think I'd really like to stop doing the gentoo ebuilds.. but if I stop, it just stops altogether [00:00:55]
2016-10-14 17:25:54	ng0	[00:00:59] which is awful [00:00:59]

2016-10-15 08:11:09	@meskarune	ng0: yeah, I think people should do what they are comfortable with
2016-10-15 08:11:27	@meskarune	I just personally try and be open not just for me, but to benifit others who feel they can't speak out
2016-10-15 08:13:28	ng0	I feel like this is a society where I could express myself freely but am afraid to express myself freely because of the parts of society which are amplified by media .. that's one part. then there are issues in my past I am not comfortable speaking about among people who would use it against me or who would not understand it
2016-10-15 08:13:58	@meskarune	yeah, thats understandable
2016-10-15 08:14:13	@meskarune	I'm not going to lie, I get a lot of shit online or otherwise
2016-10-15 08:14:29	@meskarune	I have had people not beleive me, think I exagerate or that I'm trying to get attention
2016-10-15 08:14:51	@meskarune	but then there are the people who feel less alone because they know they aren't the only one
2016-10-15 08:14:57	@meskarune	even if they never say a word
2016-10-15 08:15:15	@meskarune	I don't get easily bothered by strangers on the internet so I don't mind taking the hits
2016-10-15 08:15:20	ng0	I am happy that I know the friends I have.. otherwise I'd continue to live in an uncomfortable box
2016-10-15 08:17:48	ng0	to some degree I've tried expressing a bit more, and know that on the outside I look so confident that most people do not dare to question what I do or do not care at all what others do (normal city life),but selfconfidence through repetition is hard :)
2016-10-15 08:17:48		[08:17]
2016-10-15 08:22:37	ng0	you are expected to be strong. to get over whatever. to learn to live with it. to just move on. look strong and confident. when you have the wrong kind of friends even they repeat this pattern to you when something bad happens. so you inhale it like a mantra, generation by generation.. and if you break the cycle people are alienated by life.
2016-10-15 08:24:03	ng0	I had 'friends' whose definition of friendship was just party.
2016-10-15 08:24:34	ng0	it's really resourceful if you find people you can talk to
2016-10-15 08:24:49	ng0	break the pattern and silence
2016-10-15 08:26:50	@meskarune	yeah, having a support system in life is really important for everyone
2016-10-15 08:26:59	@meskarune	none of use lives in a void
2016-10-15 08:27:42	@meskarune	probably one of the bests reasons why arch women exists ;)
2016-10-15 08:27:58	@meskarune	women working together to contribute to tech and support each other
2016-10-15 08:28:48	ng0	I find tranquility in sound and music... the years I could not (or only in difficult forms) talk about what is/was going on with me or happened to me, I made a broad range of music my support system
2016-10-15 08:30:40	ng0	projects like this are important even if repetive told otherwise in other places :)

2016-10-15 08:41:14	@meskarune	there is no argument you can make against that lol
2016-10-15 08:42:47	ng0	:)
2016-10-15 08:44:12	ng0	early rammstein is really simple.. i don't know if they still are, but the melodies and structure aren't that complex.. I don't know why I keep paying attention to the music which is running, I search for gear and setups of soundgeneration etc xD
2016-10-15 08:45:29	alad	ng0: omg, same here :P
2016-10-15 08:47:00	ng0	why do people complain about ultra low sound / sonic warfare weapons just now? I see news as early as 1999 and possibly before that
2016-10-15 08:47:34	ng0	I was searching for really low frequencies, and this overlaps -.-
2016-10-15 08:52:29	spider-mario	apparently, while recording Phaedra, Tangerine Dream damaged their speakers because of the unusually low frequencies generated by their synths

2016-10-15 09:07:29	@meskarune	so my grandmother had huge tits
2016-10-15 09:07:29		[09:07]
2016-10-15 09:07:38	@meskarune	and she was short and they sorta hung down
2016-10-15 09:07:48	@meskarune	and when I was really little and wanted her attention
2016-10-15 09:07:52	@meskarune	I would yank on them
2016-10-15 09:07:58	ng0	oh
2016-10-15 09:08:08	@meskarune	its like when a child yanks on their mom's skirt for attention
2016-10-15 09:08:11	ng0	that's funny.. and mean.. :D
2016-10-15 09:08:11	@meskarune	but it was her boobs
2016-10-15 09:08:30	@meskarune	my grandma never cared lol
2016-10-15 09:09:13	@meskarune	but idk, all the grandkids did that
2016-10-15 09:09:50	@meskarune	either yanked on them or patted them to get her attention, and we'd all sleep on them or cry on them or whatever, and she never gave a fuck
2016-10-15 09:10:17	@meskarune	but they were big enough that you couldn't really reach any other part of her without running into them
2016-10-15 09:10:27	@meskarune	its not like the kids could tap on her shoulder
2016-10-15 09:11:45	@meskarune	I never thought of boobs as being anything even removely sexual until I was way older, but even know I feel like they are probably over sexualized
2016-10-15 09:12:40	ng0	yep
2016-10-15 09:13:10	ng0	but some people are very sensitive and it hurts them

2016-10-15 09:19:56	ng0	crap. I remember most of this EP... maybe because because it's one of those CDs I bought before I had access to people who knew certain people or before I otherwise could dive into new music

I wondered where these wolf sounds came from he sampled at the last gig I saw him playing
2016-10-15 09:41:12	ng0	there was this artist some years back who performed in a location here, and they swallowed contact mics and made music with that.. extreme levels of experimentation :)
