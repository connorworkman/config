2016-09-15 19:35:24	jflory7	[19:33:32] tlamer: I'm going to Boston for MIT's annual hackathon as a Fedora Ambassador. I don't know how much time I will have to explore, but it will be my first time in Boston.
2016-09-15 19:35:24	tlamer	[19:34:33] jflory7: Yeah I'm using fedora on my work computer... I work at Red Hat so at work with RHEL and on my girlfriends computer I've installed Debian few weeks ago... :D

2016-09-15 19:35:59	tlamer	But I have my personal computer pending for reinstallation and I'll install arch there :)
2016-09-15 19:37:53	tlamer	jflory7: So you're Fedora Ambassador? How can one become an ambassador?
2016-09-15 19:38:26	jflory7	tlamer: What region of the world are you in?
2016-09-15 19:38:57	tlamer	jflory7: right now Slovakia, but I work and live in Czech Republic
2016-09-15 19:39:12	tlamer	jflory7: central Europe :)
2016-09-15 19:39:26	jflory7	tlamer: I still need to give Arch a spin. A lot of people in my LUG are big fans, but I've just never had much time to get around to playing with it myself. I hang out here anyways because I enjoy the community. :)
2016-09-15 19:39:50	jflory7	tlamer: Ah, okay! So, this might be a little off-topic for this channel, but if you want to hop in #fedora-ambassadors, I'd be happy to give you the quick rundown :)

2016-09-16 10:42:33	@fsckd	what is a cantenna?
2016-09-16 10:42:48	+meskarune	to make one I'd need a tall can that is about 3 inches across and a usb wifi dongle
2016-09-16 10:43:21	+meskarune	a cantenna increases the distrance you can connect to wifi networks
2016-09-16 10:43:44	+meskarune	with a large antenna you can connect to places like 1/2 mile away or longer depending
2016-09-16 10:43:55	@fsckd	sweet
2016-09-16 10:43:59	Mikaela	Are they legal?
2016-09-16 10:44:35	ng0	there are antennas which can go several kilometers if no interferences are in the way.
2016-09-16 10:44:52	ng0	legal of course :)
2016-09-16 10:47:56	+meskarune	fsckd: cantenna's are just the diy version that is cheap to make
2016-09-16 10:48:04	+meskarune	you just need a usb dongle and a can
2016-09-16 10:48:30	@fsckd	ahh, like a usb wifi adapter?
2016-09-16 10:50:53	+meskarune	yeah
