2016-10-17 15:18:40	nshp	and the firmware is up to the vendor I think
2016-10-17 15:19:21	nshp	they have large bootloaders/firmware similar to UEFI, sort of
2016-10-17 15:19:34	nshp	usually u-boot or something similar
2016-10-17 15:19:50	blueblur112198	and said bootloader/firmware happens to really really suck on most android phones?

2016-10-17 15:20:35	nshp	they're usually locked down by the carrier if you get them on contract
2016-10-17 15:20:48	nshp	or in the case of samsung, they're just fuck you bootloaders

2016-10-17 15:21:19	nshp	but samsung's chromebooks running arch can be pretty sweet

2016-10-17 15:24:11	blueblur112198	you mean it takes a partition from an external drive and moves it to an internal drive?

2016-10-17 15:24:42	alyptik	yeah it can either be /storage/emulated/0 or /data

2016-10-18 00:14:23	mar77i	[10:09:20] the only thing you'll ever need to write in assembly is a c compiler. [10:09:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	NextHendrix	[10:09:39] or an assembler [10:09:39]

2016-10-18 00:14:23	mar77i	[10:11:10] oh those exist already, as unused compiler flag on a compiler you haven't heard of [10:11:10]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	mar77i	[10:11:32] (which also breaks your code because you depend on your compiler's specific UB) [10:11:32]

2016-10-18 03:17:06	Kirito	until I sat in front of a 120hz TV. Though those work by artificially increasing framerates
2016-10-18 03:17:15	Kirito	in high action scenes
2016-10-18 03:17:26	Kirito	because nothing is recorded in 120fps
2016-10-18 03:18:44	Namarrgon	the only display that provide more than 60Hz are usually those that support gsync or freesync
2016-10-18 03:18:50	Kirito	though actually I'm not sure to what extent this TV does do that, because TV is never 60fps either
2016-10-18 03:19:09	@demize	Well, some things are recorded at high frame rates, but generally because you're recording things for slo-mo. :p

2016-10-18 03:20:22	@demize	In practice, no movie and such is recorded in higher than 48Hz.

2016-10-18 03:20:35	@demize	And The Hobbit was the first to be recorded in 48Hz.

2016-10-18 03:24:02	Kirito	You could add a lot more computational power into the process by pre-encoding instead of doing it on the fly
2016-10-18 03:24:10	Kirito	so theoretically the quality could be better

2016-10-18 04:43:49	Kirito	lol, can't you just check Chromium out without history though?
2016-10-18 04:44:01	alyptik	hm?
2016-10-18 04:44:04	Kirito	It took me a while to realize that too
2016-10-18 04:44:08	alyptik	what do you mean check out

2016-10-18 04:47:28	BL4DE	well I installed windows 7 and used the DazLoader but now it wont boot. thing is grub suggest using that command but Im afraid ALL might destroy arch / partition but idk?
2016-10-18 04:48:05	alyptik	from a complete guess
2016-10-18 04:48:22	alyptik	it fixes a bootsector (idk what nt60 is) --force

2016-10-18 06:43:47	BL4DE	mpan: I mean the worst DRM is always connected. local DRMs like steams drm for singleplayer games never stopped warez groups. but in any case pirated games are usually unplayable online unless theres a LAN mode with which you can use Hamachi, Tunggle and whatnot to simulate LAN on actual internet connection
2016-10-18 06:44:44	mk-fg	But people want online multiplayer

2016-10-18 06:48:17	mpan	BL4DE: I don’t say that DRM itself is what halts cracking Denuvo-restricted games. But I doubt that mere obfuscation or complex tricks (this is what typical anticrack soft uses) alone would work. In combination with DRM techs, they can.
2016-10-18 06:48:18	BL4DE	tomb raider, doom have been cracked
2016-10-18 06:48:37	NextHendrix	wont be long before games require a usb licenser

2016-10-18 06:49:12	NextHendrix	they do it for all the music production stuff
2016-10-18 06:49:18	BL4DE	sangy: but just cause 3 hasnt been cracked yet. it sucks anyway. also metal gear solid uses some sort of bypass
2016-10-18 06:49:32	mk-fg	Yeah, CAD stuff usually also comes with smartcards
2016-10-18 06:49:35	NextHendrix	if you're planning on doing music prod legally, you better hope you've got 5+ usb ports for all the damn usb licensers

2016-10-18 06:53:41	NextHendrix	or even stream
2016-10-18 06:53:51	Kirito	streaming games over the net has existed for years now

2016-10-18 06:55:30	BL4DE	I guess problem with Denuvo it will take significantly longer than before. Less games will be cracked. Remember the days when games used to get cracked before launching on steam. tho guess it's fair for game companies to have headstart for couple of months to not get hit
2016-10-18 06:56:06	mar77i	hmm, don't they get the experience and reactiveness up by saving bandwidth using at least a bit compression?
2016-10-18 06:56:50	NextHendrix	that drm on arma 2 was pretty annoying
2016-10-18 06:57:00	NextHendrix	FADE i think it was called

2016-10-18 06:57:36	NextHendrix	hows steam in home streaming doing these days
2016-10-18 06:57:50	NextHendrix	haven't tried it in ages, has it improved since release?
2016-10-18 06:57:58	Kirito	Steam link is a bit flaky and annoying to set up, but it seems to work well otherwise

2016-10-18 06:59:02	sangy	mpan: fully homomorphic encryption will make drm really interesting, but we'll have to wait a little for that
2016-10-18 06:59:22	NextHendrix	BL4DE: ive never tried 3
2016-10-18 06:59:45	Kirito	I haven't pirated video games since I was a minor.
2016-10-18 06:59:46	NextHendrix	no GPU in my desktop at the minute, heavily abused 7870XT died a while back
2016-10-18 06:59:59	NextHendrix	had no fan at all for about 2 years
2016-10-18 07:00:09	Kirito	because I got a job and started paying for games
2016-10-18 07:00:36	BL4DE	NextHendrix: virtual programming made eon linux and mac ports of arma 3 but unfortunately its always lagging 1-2 releases behind windows. probably when they stop developing arma 3. linux client will be compatible with windows playerbase
2016-10-18 07:00:41	Kirito	especially today with Steam Sales, Humble Bundle's and so on
2016-10-18 07:01:12	NextHendrix	i barely play games at all these days
2016-10-18 07:01:34	NextHendrix	played some TIS-100 the other day
2016-10-18 07:01:38	Kirito	neither do I honestly
2016-10-18 07:01:39	NextHendrix	not sure if that even really counts
2016-10-18 07:01:55	NextHendrix	felt more productive than what i stopped doing to play it
2016-10-18 07:01:58	Kirito	I've got probably 100 games on Steam I got during summer sales and such I still haven't played, haha

2016-10-18 07:04:39	BL4DE	but yeah I also lost interest in gaming. especially AAA games where devs are selling early alphas that never get finished or sell games in pieces with DLC bullshit. gaming industry is shit. had 3 games on windows partition. arma 3, red orchestra 2 and swat4. thats it

2016-10-18 07:06:23	BL4DE	NextHendrix: hehe played arma for nearly 16 years since operation flashpoint: cold war crisis

2016-10-18 07:06:40	BL4DE	which is now renamed cold war assault
2016-10-18 07:06:54	NextHendrix	i had red river on 360
2016-10-18 07:07:15	NextHendrix	i remember first booting it up after about 3 hours on cod4, and I was like what in the fuck is this shit
2016-10-18 07:07:21	BL4DE	NextHendrix: basically codemasters released dragon rising and red river. nothing to do with arma
2016-10-18 07:07:34	NextHendrix	ive got a ton of hours on arm II though
2016-10-18 07:07:39	NextHendrix	muh dayz
2016-10-18 07:07:50	NextHendrix	never played the campaigns

2016-10-18 07:08:14	NextHendrix	BL4DE: are they worth doing?
2016-10-18 07:08:18	BL4DE	NextHendrix: cause of legal issues bohemia had to rename the first operation flashpoint cause they had rights to engine just not the name. scammy codemasters later released cod clone under a milsim name of operation flashpoint
2016-10-18 07:08:20	NextHendrix	i just like flying the helicoptters
2016-10-18 07:09:50	BL4DE	NextHendrix: Id recommend arma3. it has dayz like mods which are more complete than actual dayz standalone
2016-10-18 07:10:12	NextHendrix	never played the standalone
2016-10-18 07:10:19	Kirito	I was severely addicted to BF2: Modern Combat on the PS2 and Xbox 360 when it was re-released, hah
2016-10-18 07:10:19	NextHendrix	last time i checked it was totally broken

2016-10-18 07:12:03	BL4DE	NextHendrix: well arma 3 definately improved over arma 2 in many ways. not as clunky, has basic physics, underwater, many engine improvements too much shit to name. but regardless real virtuality engine is always broken no matter how polished the turd is
2016-10-18 07:13:42	NextHendrix	clunky is definitely the word for arma II
2016-10-18 07:13:58	BL4DE	NextHendrix: if you dont mind playing ancient arma cold war assault. it has a good "Resistance" campaign. arma 2 campaigns were meh. harvest red had missions were you had to find and arrest a single guy "war criminal" in 250 square KM map
2016-10-18 07:14:37	NextHendrix	the barracks mode on arma II was awesome, especially with all the expansions
2016-10-18 07:14:41	BL4DE	NextHendrix: but it did have it's moments during campaing. also eagle wing is a nice short campaign.
2016-10-18 07:14:50	NextHendrix	many a weekend wasted stoned doing chicken missions and whatnot
2016-10-18 07:15:02	BL4DE	NextHendrix: you mean armory :D
2016-10-18 07:15:10	NextHendrix	yeah, that shit was decent

2016-10-18 23:59:27	bokchoi	Ugh, I want to build my system as an X99 one because futureproof, but even choosing the 5820K as my CPU doesn't end up much cheaper than A 6800K ._.

2016-10-19 05:27:46	Chais	a read/write test on the host achieved good results

2016-10-19 11:15:35	Paddy_NI	I fix computers for a living and encounter very few
2016-10-19 11:15:39	GaivsIvlivs	1080p has been out quite a few years, in electronics relative years
2016-10-19 11:15:58	kbdkode	my high res small screen laptop is 1920x1080. The screen size really isn't that big
2016-10-19 11:16:03	Paddy_NI	1366x768 still has the majority on laptops I would say

2016-10-20 14:39:02	mpan	1) wrong arg type (should be size_t). 2) unsafe calling style (returning resource instead of passing it by ref). 3) `ptr` is of type `int*` instead of `void*`. While this is still syntactically valid, this explicitly opens possibility of invalid access. 4) `exit(whatever)` instead of `abort`. 5) crashing the application because mere allocation has failed¹. | ¹ Note: under Linux this test is 
2016-10-20 14:39:08	mpan	also always false, as memory allocation can’t fail under Linux kernel.

But any program that would succeed would be immiedietly killed by OOM killer anyway. 2) I recall there was some strange situation related to `malloc` being interrupted. Dunno if it’s still happening.

2016-10-21 04:07:53	Reventlov	How can such a request be accepted ?
2016-10-21 04:08:02	voidead	jelle› honestly I think this is an issue with xterm since that happens with a few other xterm terminals as well
2016-10-21 04:08:18	voidead	but ST isn't xterm
2016-10-21 04:08:23	voidead	so I guess thats why it doesn't do that

2016-10-21 04:08:54	jelle	what?

2016-10-21 04:09:12	jelle	it's boat :D

2016-10-21 04:09:50	jelle	lolwut
2016-10-21 04:10:13	Reventlov	yesterday, one of my package was deleted without a warning (ok, it was on aur-requests) cause the source was 404'ing.
2016-10-21 04:10:21	voidead	just Ctrl+l of course refreshes it and fixes the issue.. but I have to Ctrl+l all the time since multiple windows (buffers in weechat) will have random emojis like that which fuck up the text alignment
2016-10-21 04:10:26	Reventlov	not a single comment on the package page, not a single message to me.

2016-10-21 04:54:11	deltasquared	I swear, when I tested it I was hexdump'ing the dev node (I forget if it was keyboard or mouse), after suspend it error'd with "no such device"

2016-10-21 05:26:23	MrElendig	if something have 100% bogus traffic but only accounts for 0.2% of your total traffic it would still make sense to block it
2016-10-21 05:26:53	vidje	anyway, what's new in archlinux
2016-10-21 05:27:07	vidje	i'm planning to buy another ssd for linux boot so i can arch again

2016-10-21 05:27:21	mpan	MrElendig: then block whole Russia by default on any servers you run. Actually whole central-east Europe would be even better ;).
2016-10-21 05:27:23	vidje	yarrrrch
2016-10-21 05:27:35	vidje	mpan, why? 
2016-10-21 05:27:46	MrElendig	the % is much lower from there
2016-10-21 05:27:52	vidje	there's below 10% of malicious traffic coming from those countries
2016-10-21 05:27:57	vidje	while there's above 90% coming from tor
2016-10-21 05:28:01	vidje	:D

2016-10-21 05:28:55	vidje	don't see the logic in that
2016-10-21 05:29:01	vidje	i never supported tor and never will

2016-10-21 05:29:20	Sapphirus	Not my fault you choose to browse through tor
2016-10-21 05:29:21	vidje	people who have privacy issues and resort to tor should seek a psychiatrist or stop doing illegal shit
2016-10-21 05:29:47	MrElendig	there are some valid usage of tor but sadly it is the minority

2016-10-21 05:29:53	mpan	Sapphirus: please read. I’m not browsing through tor. kthx
2016-10-21 05:30:01	deltasquared	haha, best advice I'v read in a paper thus far: "Having someone to share your frustrations with can also be achieved without pair programming.  You usually get frustrated when you are due for a break. In this situation you should relax, take your mind off the project and do something that will help you unwind. For example, going for a walk, have a quick snack, make a cup of tea or play a game; we would personally recommend 
2016-10-21 05:30:01	deltasquared	“GTA Vice City” as you can vent your anger and frustrations on innocent bystanders."
2016-10-21 05:30:02	vidje	Sapphirus, it's not like government can't track you through it either
2016-10-21 05:30:07	Sapphirus	mpan: Then you wouldn't have been 403'd by my web server.
2016-10-21 05:30:20	Sapphirus	Every single ip in that blacklist is a tor exit-node.
2016-10-21 05:30:32	Sapphirus	And I could verify it with my logs
2016-10-21 05:30:34	vidje	there's a whole lot different & better ways to stay 'safe' on line than to use tor :D
2016-10-21 05:30:35	mpan	Sapphirus: I wouldn’t if you could at least understand a bit what you’re doing… but hey, cargo cult administrating is so fun!

2016-10-21 05:51:31	mpan	vidje: then let me surprise you, it’s true. And, by the way, about the doctors: in PL they’re legally allowed to refuse help to people based on ideological beliefs.
2016-10-21 05:51:39	vidje	that's the kind of argument you're providing basically
2016-10-21 05:51:43	voidead	its not about whether someone is using TOR or not.. its about knowing how to secure your machine (or machines) properly using the right  steps needed for your purposes etc..
2016-10-21 05:52:03	deltasquared	voidead: if he gets pwned, his fault
2016-10-21 05:52:05	deltasquared	leave him to it
2016-10-21 05:52:14	Sapphirus	vidje, if it was a publicly usable service, I would only block tor users from uploading shit.
2016-10-21 05:52:19	voidead	if you are poking around in shit infested places on the internet.. you are asking for trouble.. unless you know how to secure your shit beforehand
2016-10-21 05:52:23	vidje	mpan, whole world should just convert to catholicism anyway.
2016-10-21 05:52:30	deltasquared	!debate
2016-10-21 05:52:32	vidje	so doctors would accept everyone

2016-10-21 05:52:41	vidje	:D
2016-10-21 05:52:41	Sapphirus	But that would also be assuming, I have the infrastructure in place to deal with rouge traffic at a decent scale
2016-10-21 05:52:45	mpan	vidje: actually it’s about catholic views… :D
2016-10-21 05:52:58	vidje	mpan, roman catholicism is the only true faith. rest is mickey mouse bullshit
2016-10-21 05:53:05	deltasquared	Sapphirus: let cloudflare handle it for you
2016-10-21 05:53:05	vidje	:D
2016-10-21 05:53:19	mpan	deltasquared: not the best advice, as cloudflare blocks tor for no reason too ;)
2016-10-21 05:53:20	Sapphirus	deltasquared, cloudflare will only go so far unless you're paying them thousands per month.
2016-10-21 05:53:31	deltasquared	Sapphirus: eh, just $RANDIDEA
2016-10-21 05:53:51	deltasquared	disclaimer: I don't count any of my advice as sound
2016-10-21 05:53:59	Sapphirus	Plus, this site right now, is intended as a personal image hosting service.
2016-10-21 05:54:21	Sapphirus	So, it isn't like I'm a 'business' or anything, like mpam's analogy would make you believe.
2016-10-21 05:54:28	Sapphirus	mpan's*
2016-10-21 05:54:42	vidje	can't believe whole argument started over something as worthless as tor
2016-10-21 05:54:48	voidead	TOR is used for legal purposes all the time.. TOR isn't just for scumbags.. its also for people who simply want a secure connection without some asshole corporation(s) snooping in on everything you do or say
2016-10-21 05:54:50	mpan	vidje: ok, this turns into a talk that is not serious enough :P
2016-10-21 05:54:50	Sapphirus	vidje, me neither.
2016-10-21 05:55:13	vidje	voidead, point is that such people are vast minority of tor users
2016-10-21 05:55:15	mpan	voidead: actually this would not be my argument. I run it exclusively because it can be used for illegal purposes ;).
2016-10-21 05:55:17	deltasquared	can we all just call it a day and bash M$ instead? that'd be fun
2016-10-21 05:55:27	Sapphirus	voidead, Out of how many people which use the service for illegitimate purposes?
2016-10-21 05:55:33	mpan	deltasquared: don’t we bash Microsoft® every day?

2016-10-21 05:56:39	mpan	The problem is not really tor. It’s about doing pointless things that harm others under a belief that this helps in some way. Or under pure lazyness.
2016-10-21 05:56:42	deltasquared	voidead: yep, let us all be clueless and provide amusement to onlookers :P
2016-10-21 05:56:47	voidead	just throw around "TOR exit node" like you know what it means
2016-10-21 05:56:56	Sapphirus	mpan: and if people are sending rouge dns requests via your node, and so are you; if you *ever* got caught, you could just say: "Not me, I'm the operator of a tor exit-node."
2016-10-21 05:57:13	mpan	Sapphirus: sure. Do you run a DNS service on this server? :>
2016-10-21 05:57:31	Sapphirus	and since you do run a tor exit-node, the liability would be diverted to the anons using your node.

These then become prey for fish. Phytoplankton also suck carbon dioxide out of the air, helping to limit global warming.

2016-10-22 00:13:45	minimalism	Americans are crazy and can't be trusted with them.
2016-10-22 00:13:52	vrmxm	We need to entice people off the road
2016-10-22 00:14:05	polyzen	and into the Church
2016-10-22 00:14:22	vrmxm	*Viable* public transportation, ride sharing, maybe even some sort of tax rewards for zero-car families
2016-10-22 00:14:41	minimalism	And those damn job things. Leading cause of house abandonment. I'm just conveniently leaving out the fact that it's only for on average 8 hours.
2016-10-22 00:15:05	MrElendig	the accident statistics of the US do show that something is seriously wrong
2016-10-22 00:15:11	MrElendig	when it comes to cars
2016-10-22 00:16:29	vrmxm	Americans seem to have (among others) the issue of "I'm above that statistic" or "I can do what I want" etc

2016-10-22 00:16:49	mkoskar	minimalism: and also a lot of sarcasm might kill you
2016-10-22 00:16:54	MrElendig	vrmxm: also you are allowed to drive a car without having had any schooling done by a proffessional teacher
2016-10-22 00:16:56	vrmxm	Gun safety? Pff. That's for liberal fargits.
2016-10-22 00:17:21	MrElendig	and a driving test not much harder than the old indian one :p
2016-10-22 00:17:45	vrmxm	Pyro-what license? Commie scum, I blow things up on the 4th of July and you should too!
2016-10-22 00:18:37	MrElendig	vrmxm: btw: you are more likely to die from fireworks than terrorists :p
2016-10-22 00:18:44	vrmxm	I believe it
2016-10-22 00:18:50	MrElendig	but somehow terrorists warrants turning the country into a police state
2016-10-22 00:19:06	vrmxm	I've seen what these crazy Appalachian mofos do on/around the 4th
2016-10-22 00:19:16	MrElendig	vrmxm: an order of magnitude more likely even to die from fireworks
2016-10-22 00:19:53	vrmxm	I think in my case I'm most likely to die from caffeine overdose, but eh
2016-10-22 00:20:02	MrElendig	1:700000 vs 1:8000000
2016-10-22 00:20:07	MrElendig	or something in that ballpark
2016-10-22 00:21:14	vrmxm	Those are some retarded odds, if they're right
2016-10-22 00:21:27	vrmxm	All those preppers would have better luck with the lottery
2016-10-22 00:21:30	minimalism	systemd has a 1:4 chance of pissing someone off.
2016-10-22 00:21:52	MrElendig	vrmxm: and lottery is "tax on stupid" :D
2016-10-22 00:22:19	vrmxm	No, lottery is a tax on people who never took statistics
2016-10-22 00:26:57	MrElendig	http://www.businessinsider.com/fox-news-lottery-tickets-2016-1?r=US&IR=T&IR=T
2016-10-22 00:26:59	voidead	minimalism: especially if they are incapable of understanding how it works.. much less the pid1 bullshit (apologies pid1)

2016-10-22 14:22:18	bokchoi	It's been done before

2016-10-22 14:23:42	KKKrx	and you can have different setups, for example
2016-10-22 14:23:48	KKKrx	colect all roots of unity!

2016-10-22 14:25:30	KKKrx	I was thinking reaper because reap = to collect and you're trying to reap as many cards as possible
2016-10-22 14:25:55	bokchoi	probably in your head
2016-10-22 14:26:29	polyzen	wow didn't expect the new mpv to be so different

2016-10-22 23:33:03	Lehvyn	I buy in bulk if buying said product doesn't go bad quickly
2016-10-22 23:33:11	bokchoi	Yeah, it makes sense
2016-10-22 23:33:18	bokchoi	Assuming you have the room for it
2016-10-22 23:33:27	Lehvyn	I also pay bills in advance if I know it's not going to change
2016-10-22 23:33:37	bokchoi	The Smart Thing To Do™
2016-10-22 23:33:42	Lehvyn	rent/mortgage/insurance/etc, years worth at the beginning of the year
2016-10-22 23:34:09	bokchoi	A lot of companies offer not a late penalty, but an early payment "discount"
2016-10-22 23:34:16	bokchoi	Here, that is
2016-10-22 23:34:40	bokchoi	So they basically up their prices by an amount equivalent to a late penalty, and treat the removal of said fee like a discount
2016-10-22 23:35:38	bokchoi	It's all about mindset, and I find myself, without regret, falling for it
2016-10-22 23:36:13	bokchoi	I coudln't afford  to pay rent in one yearly sum
2016-10-22 23:36:18	Lehvyn	all the bills I pay in advance are the same if I paid by month
2016-10-22 23:36:28	Lehvyn	no fees, no discounts, etc
2016-10-22 23:36:38	bokchoi	Oh nice
2016-10-22 23:36:45	bokchoi	Gets it out of the way I guess
2016-10-22 23:36:57	bokchoi	I do pay insurance etc yearly though
2016-10-22 23:37:12	bokchoi	Since I only have to insure my car and that's pretty much it
2016-10-22 23:37:39	Lehvyn	Yup. Don't have to wonder if you have enough money for rent in april, or if your cable/phone will be cut off in october, or if your insurance/car payment/etc will be due in august - it's all paid for

2016-10-22 23:40:16	bokchoi	ha
2016-10-22 23:40:18	Lehvyn	not rich, but not poor. lol
2016-10-22 23:40:56	mk-fg	If I had money to throw away like that and don't care, would be easy to always pay in advance
2016-10-22 23:41:33	bokchoi	paying monthly is better assuming inflation continues and the bill stays the same ;)
2016-10-22 23:42:06	bokchoi	Might save 0.002% or something, who knows!
2016-10-22 23:42:11	mk-fg	Worst-case it keeps money around in case of other unforseen expenses
2016-10-22 23:42:28	mk-fg	Instead of being locked-up for the future payments
2016-10-22 23:42:35	Lehvyn	not that I don't care.. it's just that for some reason I thought bill was closer to $300 for some reason. I round up to the closest $10.
2016-10-22 23:44:17	bokchoi	It'll mean you wont pay for a while \o/

2016-10-23 07:36:43	sudokode	"According to Andrew Niccol, the filmmakers worked with actual gunrunners in the making of the film. The tanks lined up for sale were real and belonged to a Czech arms dealer who had to have them back to sell to another country. They used a real stockpile of over 3,000 AK-47s because it was cheaper than getting prop guns."

2016-10-23 08:49:33	tigrmesh	i've done the same, btw
2016-10-23 08:51:05	tigrmesh	there's probably a more elegant way, but useful would be to vimdiff the default tmux config and your current config and compare the two
2016-10-23 08:51:12	tigrmesh	*current tmux
2016-10-23 08:52:30	Paddy_NI	tigrmesh, In retrospect that would have been a wonderful idea

2016-10-23 09:28:00	mpan	I was initially thinking that this may be some sort of mahjong tiles. The original source describes this as “tiles for a game”, the period agrees, the number of tiles is only slighly off and many characters appearing on the tiles agree with these used in mahjong.

But the way things are described and displayed is a tragedy :(. A great opportunity for make a good educational exhibition has been missed.

2016-10-23 15:50:09	du5tball	by the way, does anyone know if there are med resistance tests?
2016-10-23 15:51:36	minimalism	well, I could throw a bottle of Tylenol at your head and see how you fare
2016-10-23 15:52:16	du5tball	tylenol actually still does something
2016-10-23 15:52:24	du5tball	i seem to develop resistances to meds left and right
2016-10-23 15:52:40	du5tball	benzodiazepines lost their effectiveness, as did zolpidem for example
2016-10-23 15:52:48	du5tball	can eat both like smarties
2016-10-23 15:52:50	minimalism	that's why I don't take anything
2016-10-23 15:53:31	du5tball	i took both only twice or thrice
2016-10-23 15:54:10	minimalism	I'm supposed to be on some anti-ocd meds which are really just anti-deps .. which they don't even understand how or why they "help" ocd
2016-10-23 15:54:22	minimalism	and even they'll admit  without saying it directly that an immunity will be built
2016-10-23 15:54:28	minimalism	it's like chasing the dragon
2016-10-23 15:56:32	du5tball	true but it usually takes a while
2016-10-23 15:58:20	du5tball	and i mean years
2016-10-23 15:58:20		[15:58]
2016-10-23 15:58:40	minimalism	well it'll be too late by the time "Crawling In My Skin" starts playing in your head
2016-10-23 15:58:47	minimalism	and you still have many years of life after that
2016-10-23 15:58:54	du5tball	you'll just get new meds then
2016-10-23 15:59:09	minimalism	then the eventual suicide because nothing will work anymore, and you're more upset than ever

2016-10-24 01:53:44	mkoskar	what I don't get is that in osc.lua they use some completely separate OSD drawing, which is then rendered on top of regular OSD like when you change volume and so, I don't use OSC, but did nice simple playlist UI yesterday and took some code from it

2016-10-24 01:57:39	@demize	Ark is not a proper pronunciation, and is another Linux distro.
2016-10-24 01:57:40	mkoskar	demize: I was thinking about that yes, although I like that I can ctrl+` to get older notifications, but in the process I would probably want to migrate to smt. different than xmobar, but all that would take much time I guess

2016-10-24 02:01:41	mkoskar	demize: no I mean I like dunst functionality, actions on entries although I don't use them often, ... I've thought you mean I shouldn't use dunst but some other notification daemon integrated with bar? ... xmobar has CommandReader so doing a simple notification daemon shouldn't be that hard

2016-10-24 04:01:57	mpan	An empty set is half of a smiley (mpan’s conjecture, 2016).
2016-10-24 04:02:42	@demize	Technically it's either ⅓ or ⅔
2016-10-24 04:05:51	mpan	Not really, as “⊆” can’t be considered equally important as “∅”. Also I see no ordering that would put “∅” behind or before “⊆”, so it’s an open question and a new entry in the great unsolved questions of the mathematics.
2016-10-24 04:11:00		[04:05]
2016-10-24 04:11:06	mpan	Oh, I found the answer. In Unicode “∅” has a codepoint 2205, “⊆” has 2282. So the latter is ~3.5% more. Hence the empty set is ~ 32.(9497907)% of the smiley (revised mpan’s conjecture).

2016-10-24 04:12:40	@demize	Never been that interested in it, honestly.
2016-10-24 04:13:21	mpan	Approximately 3295/10000, and 3295 is a divisor of 12²⁸-1.
2016-10-24 04:14:34	mpan	mar77i: because mere existence of nothing in everything doesn’t imply that other things, including anything, don’t exist. Something may exist in everything, and that something may be anything.
2016-10-24 04:15:15	dunz0r	ekkelett: I might wait for the dollar to drop a little bit before I jump on it... it's quite a lot of money for something I don't really need :)

2016-10-24 19:24:26	mpan	No, I doubt that. If our former national post can still do it for $3 (and for letter-sized, unregistered things it’s $0.50), then door-to-door isn’t the obstacle.

If the postman is lazy and just leave me a note that I was absent (they didn’t checked if of course), I can take the package not earlier than the next day. With a delivery point I got a SMS/e-mail that the package is waiting for me and can fetch it seconds later.

2016-10-24 23:43:28	phillid	So I suppose it's a synonym in Arch circles
2016-10-24 23:43:31	mpan	phillid: yes, I know. And I know that it was pushed to i686 and the support for older architectures was dropped. But to what would you move from i686? Is there any benefit on dropping support for it and moving futher?

2016-10-24 23:45:06	mpan	Moving from i586 to i686? Fine, maybe there was some benefit in terms of performance. But is there a serious benefit of moving at Pentium4?

2016-10-24 23:47:08	mpan	In my case it was Duron. So no way of running 64b on it.
2016-10-24 23:47:36	phillid	mk-fg, what's the benefit of rolling-release - apply that mindset to hardware
2016-10-24 23:47:37	mk-fg	Seem to make more sense with rolling-release to me, as you never get that "new release, might as well switch arch" kick

2016-10-24 23:50:32	mpan	mk-fg: but some people has no other use for that. They just need a cheap platform for running few things. I would opposte developing new solutions using non 64b PCs/servers, but if someone still has old one in their basement… why not?
2016-10-24 23:51:02	mk-fg	Why not indeed
2016-10-24 23:51:20	mk-fg	If there are enough of these, would make sense to keep 32-bit around, I guess

2016-10-24 23:51:27	phillid	Get an ARM or MIPS box
2016-10-24 23:51:38	mpan	Yeah, I know that RPi is now cheaper than old PC, and 3rd one provides 64b. But this has appeared only recently.
2016-10-24 23:52:00	mk-fg	They aren't eager to even port new features to x86 when it's non-free
2016-10-24 23:52:11	mpan	Plus still some people need extensions (like few ethernet ports) that aren’t available in any decent way on SoC.
2016-10-24 23:52:21	mk-fg	Which also makes sense - people still running that stuff probably don't care much about "new" anyway
2016-10-24 23:52:58	mk-fg	RPi3 doesn't really provide aarch64 ;)
2016-10-24 23:53:17	mk-fg	But maybe will with mainline kernel

2016-10-25 00:10:45	mpan	“real” time is what I was noting, as the test was meant to include the actual timings that would occur.
2016-10-25 00:11:08	mk-fg	Also not sure why you bother with 224 and 384 - they're just truncated 256/512, no?

2016-10-25 00:11:41	phillid	o wait no
2016-10-25 00:12:29	mpan	mk-fg: a long story. Ok, maybe not *that* long. Initially it was done because I needed a counterargument against people who would consider SHA512 to be “too slow” compared to other SHA2 functions. Later the idea which gave basis for these tests died, but since I’ve already had considerable amount of results, I’ve continued for curiosity.
2016-10-25 00:13:05	mpan	mk-fg: and yes, 224 and 384 are truncated versions of 256 and 512, but just for test completness I tested them too. “Just in case”. You know… someone could always say that they believe that 384 is faster than 512.
2016-10-25 00:13:30	mk-fg	Is it really worth "proving" stuff to people who argue that?

2016-10-25 00:14:23	mpan	phillid: coreutils doesn’t use GPU. It’s not about how fast you can hash, but if calculating these hashes would take long time in a typical scenario. Hence the choice of coreutils (openssl has the same results, btw), and measuring real time instead of user time.
2016-10-25 00:14:59	mpan	mk-fg: unfortunately if they may stand in your way, you have to get rid of them too.
2016-10-25 00:15:02	phillid	yeah I realised it wpuldnt be appropriate to capculate onr hash across a grid amyway ha
2016-10-25 00:15:57	mpan	phillid: yeah… average user will not hash their things on grid. I could probably run this on some scientific supercomputer too with hardly imaginable power, but this is not what I was after ;)
2016-10-25 00:16:33	phillid	I nearly ran password cracking on one of my own forgotten passwords on this grid 😛
2016-10-25 00:16:43	mpan	The outcome is what was expected: there is no performance-based reason to use any function other than SHA512 if we talk about SHA2 family.

2016-10-25 00:17:19	mk-fg	E.g. hashing small stuff that's just a bit larger than 32B
2016-10-25 00:18:02	mpan	On 64b it’s the fastest. On 32b it’s 2× slower, but 32b is getting obsolete and if someone uses 32b machine than the time of hashing is probably least of their performance problems. Also these times are for 1G… usual data chunks would be much smaller.

2016-10-25 08:22:30	mk-fg	FF, i.e. addon that'd - upon seeing yt video url - would close tab and open mpv
2016-10-25 08:22:35	mk-fg	*open it in mpv
2016-10-25 08:22:53	mk-fg	Same as for downloads, basically
2016-10-25 08:23:29	AlexIL	i see

2016-10-25 08:23:43	dagle	I made a extension that can open yt with mpv... then I never used it.
2016-10-25 08:23:55	dagle	Tbh, the real use case was something else.
2016-10-25 08:23:55	AlexIL	do you suggest any specific version based on firefox?
2016-10-25 08:24:17	mk-fg	Version of what?
2016-10-25 08:24:32	mk-fg	If FF itself - latest stable should be fine, I think
2016-10-25 08:24:41	mk-fg	It's still threaded for me
2016-10-25 08:25:00	mk-fg	Dunno if it'll get worse with separate pids for tabs, maybe not if done smartly

2016-10-25 08:25:16	mk-fg	But then again, it's the web, "smart" there means something different

2016-10-25 10:15:01	nshp	my experience is: docker is unintuitive and slow, layers are wonky and don't work as described, there's a lot of overcomplicated and inconsistent tooling, and most of the people who use it only do so as a bad excuse to avoid having a grown-up build system
2016-10-25 10:15:41	nshp	and: if I needed containers, I'd be better off managing them all by myself (the horror)

2016-10-25 10:20:36	mar77i	more important than encryption, imho, is that you're shitting real, actual, English words through an unencrypted network.
2016-10-25 10:20:40	grazzolini	Kirito: gmail supports end to end encryption. it's called gpg

2016-10-25 10:21:40	@demize	grazzolini: GMail doesn't support it, GMail supports MIME encoded emails, which might contain PGP encrypted parts.

2016-10-25 10:22:08	Kirito	partially from stupid users, partially the app is just poorly designed, so not sure what to think ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-10-25 10:22:31	@demize	grazzolini: You did not make it obvious at all, instead you just looked dumb to people who know you're wrong, and like you were telling the truth to people who don't.
2016-10-25 10:23:05	mar77i	nshp: the question is, as bash is not a programming language that is supposed to be readable, whether the line works. if it does and your other tool complains, then your other tool clearly is as it says on the package, a tool.
2016-10-25 10:23:34	mar77i	nshp: imho though, you should report that stuff as a bug upstream and get this sorted out.
2016-10-25 10:23:39	Kirito	also lol that fucking video, I just watched it

2016-10-25 15:33:48	polyzen	[01:25:38] what's the capacity [01:25:38]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	phillid	[01:25:40] I once accidentally blew the quota by ~36 fold one day [01:25:40]

2016-10-25 15:36:03	polyzen	!ddg zswap
2016-10-25 15:36:05	phrik	polyzen: zswap is a Linux kernel feature that provides a compressed write-back cache for swapped pages, as a form of virtual memory compression. Instead of moving memory pages to a swap device when they are to be swapped out, zswap performs their compression and then stores them into a memory pool dynamically allocated in the system RAM. Later writeback to the actual swap device is deferred (1 more message)
2016-10-25 15:36:11	phillid	alyptik, why?

2016-10-25 16:36:24	phillid	I don't know what it is, but it sounds like a fancy toolchain which is good at compiling and optimising stuff for intel's CPUs
2016-10-25 16:36:29	Kirito	I tried to get that once before
2016-10-25 16:36:34	alyptik	nshp said it is like $1500 for a corporate license
2016-10-25 16:36:39	alyptik	so i jumped on it

2016-10-25 16:36:48	Kirito	The last time I researched it, it seems like it may be less relevant today

2016-10-25 16:36:58	alyptik	kirito yeah it is i think
2016-10-25 16:36:59	polyzen	!papajohns
2016-10-25 16:37:00	Kirito	But, it seems to be a huge "it depends"
2016-10-25 16:37:16	alyptik	not sure on modern relevance though
2016-10-25 16:37:17	Kirito	Also, the intel compiler supposedly generates significantly larger binaries (?) I believe
2016-10-25 16:37:28	phillid	But faster
2016-10-25 16:37:46	phillid	I wonder how good GCC is at using SSE and all that fancy vector foo
2016-10-25 16:37:48	Kirito	Yeah, theoretically. Again, I think it depends. Some applications run faster, others may not
2016-10-25 16:38:04	alyptik	well intel did make the processor
2016-10-25 16:38:11	alyptik	so i can believe it
2016-10-25 16:38:36	Kirito	I can to, but
2016-10-25 16:38:46	Kirito	There is so little information out there on it, for obvious reasons
2016-10-25 16:38:49	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-25 16:38:55	Kirito	And what little information there is, is most often from 2010 or earlier
2016-10-25 16:38:56	alyptik	snake oilz bruh

2016-10-25 16:40:33	Kirito	I've seen benchmarks that show potentially major performance improvements with MySQL when utilizing profile guided optimization

2016-10-25 16:40:48	Kirito	Even small gains with PHP

2016-10-25 16:41:00	Kirito	lol
2016-10-25 16:41:08	phillid	I'm unsure how beneficial profile guided optimisation is for something like a language or sql database
2016-10-25 16:41:09	alyptik	well i can recompile my aur packages i guess
2016-10-25 16:41:09	alyptik	hah
2016-10-25 16:41:38	phillid	Something with that much variability in user input would surely not always benefit from profile-guided optimisation, but I dunno
2016-10-25 16:41:40	phillid	I am pleb
2016-10-25 16:41:43	Kirito	I haven't actually attempted to benchmark it myself. In theory if you're profiling against the kind of actual workload you will be using in production
2016-10-25 16:41:44	Kirito	Maybe?
2016-10-25 16:41:50	phillid	Well yeah
2016-10-25 16:41:58	Kirito	But, that seems hard to really balance out

2016-10-25 18:58:27	Kirito__	and setting reminders
2016-10-25 18:58:37	polyzen	does that mean applying labels?
2016-10-25 18:58:57	Kirito__	I used labels in thunderbird
2016-10-25 18:59:10	Kirito__	all that fucking does is result in 1000 labelled e-mails getting buried 
2016-10-25 18:59:49	Kirito__	I have ADD and am disorganized as hell
2016-10-25 19:00:17	Kirito__	So just having an e-mail client that doesn't make it a pain in the ass to sort e-mails and mark things I need to reply to or take care of later is an immense help
2016-10-25 19:00:25	alyptik	i am organized when it comes to useless things like my screen hardstatusline

2016-10-25 20:01:58	phillid	Maybe it's the shitty linking

2016-10-25 20:04:54	alyptik	at least my pleb brain assumes
2016-10-25 20:05:26	phillid	Might be some huge amount of boilerplate code they use or something

2016-10-25 20:06:02	phillid	lol
2016-10-25 20:06:42	phillid	Do autoconf's logs give any useful insight into why it thinks icc doesn't work?
2016-10-25 20:06:51	phillid	the internets seems to think it's as simple as setting CC
2016-10-25 20:08:00	alyptik	seems like something to do with options it feeds to CC
2016-10-25 20:08:25	alyptik	CC=icc breaks pretty much everything CXX=icc works sometimes but the linking always fails
2016-10-25 20:08:31	phillid	Are your cflags supported by icc?
2016-10-25 20:08:46	alyptik	-march=haswell -O2 -pipe
2016-10-25 20:08:48	alyptik	pretty basic
2016-10-25 20:08:58	phillid	Check they're supported I guess
2016-10-25 20:09:03	phillid	Also, you're using makepkg right

2016-10-25 20:29:04	alyptik	it can do Maildir over IMAP i am pretty sure

2016-10-25 23:40:39	@demize	I always had problem with it seemingly hanging for up to a minute even with header caching enabled.
2016-10-25 23:40:49	Pantsu	sadly most email clients were designed in the days before people had large mailboxes :/
2016-10-25 23:41:05	Pantsu	silly having the whole thing block just because you are moving a few mails or applying filters
2016-10-25 23:41:42	@demize	Though I've been thinking about replacing mutt overall, because it's too slow without notmuch, and the notmuch integration is buggy and sometimes just doesn't show certain messages, even when doing the same search directly to notmuch shows it.
2016-10-25 23:42:10	@demize	Though I should probably start doing yearly archiving..

2016-10-25 23:46:03	phillid	Right, after getting iptables to actually log the packets it dropped, I find mutt is doing what is likely DNS
2016-10-25 23:46:22	phillid	I will look at my local dns server's logs to see which name it tries to resolve
2016-10-25 23:46:28	Pantsu	so mutt-kz is getting most of the bugfixes from neomutt and the other way around
2016-10-25 23:46:34	phillid	Unless I don't have logging that verbose, then I'll just wireshark it
2016-10-25 23:46:50	grawity	in most cases, -j DROP is silly

2016-10-25 23:47:12	@demize	Anyway, I doubt neomutt would make opening my mailboxes much faster though.
2016-10-25 23:47:20	grawity	that's also silly
2016-10-25 23:47:24	phillid	grawity, why
2016-10-25 23:47:35	grawity	because it still drops stuff instead of properly telling the source to fuck off

2016-10-26 11:53:37	pulec	its just wat
2016-10-26 11:53:51	roukoswarf	C is basic, has few rules, very little actual syntax
2016-10-26 11:53:57	roukoswarf	cpp is shit on windows
2016-10-26 11:54:04	pulec	everybody who is trying to learn something should learn by doing it
2016-10-26 11:54:10	alyptik	roukoswarf› ++
2016-10-26 11:54:11	conmanworknor	lol hello world in c++ on windows
2016-10-26 11:54:15	conmanworknor	like 500 lines
2016-10-26 11:54:16	pulec	unless its learning some useless bullshit that is
2016-10-26 11:54:29	roukoswarf	conmanworknor: uuhh, what are you smoking?
2016-10-26 11:54:40	pulec	for UE4 its great, the code same on linux or windows
2016-10-26 11:54:41	conmanworknor	again, drugs
2016-10-26 11:54:47	alyptik	i want some

2016-10-26 11:55:01	roukoswarf	pulec: if you use any windows libs, youll have windows cpp problems.
2016-10-26 11:55:09	roukoswarf	example, even string.h is shit on windows
2016-10-26 11:55:14	alyptik	dll lel
2016-10-26 11:55:18	pulec	I tried doing hello world, didn't work
2016-10-26 11:55:27	roukoswarf	then you should not be making a game.
2016-10-26 11:55:30	roukoswarf	learn more.
2016-10-26 11:55:37	conmanworknor	nah don't learn anything
2016-10-26 11:55:38	pulec	but what about c++ on linux?
2016-10-26 11:55:43	conmanworknor	learn out of frustration after uve tried
2016-10-26 11:55:44	pcspkr	I've got 99 problems but a windows c++ problem ain't one
2016-10-26 11:56:01	alyptik	c++ on linux is fine?
2016-10-26 11:56:01	chee	use unity

2016-10-26 11:56:06	phrik	<Holomorph> No, You Did
2016-10-26 11:56:07	roukoswarf	c++ on linux is a bit more consistent, but still c++

2016-10-26 11:56:16	pulec	kernel is c no?
2016-10-26 11:56:27	roukoswarf	kernel is whatever you want it to be
2016-10-26 11:56:32	conmanworknor	write your game in ML
2016-10-26 11:56:33	roukoswarf	binary is binary
2016-10-26 11:56:35	pulec	chee, unity is C# no?
2016-10-26 11:56:43	alyptik	c++ is OOp C mostly with lots of silly thing like function overloading
2016-10-26 11:56:47	pulec	!kernel

2016-10-26 11:56:54	conmanworknor	smart pointers 
2016-10-26 11:57:04	chee	it lets you use C# or a typed ecmascript variation that they call javascript but that is really unityscript
2016-10-26 11:57:30	chee	it's basically just es5 + types
2016-10-26 11:57:43	pulec	id like to make some rts or something like that, I would still like to use unreal rather then unity
2016-10-26 11:58:09	pulec	heh just finished playing A story of my Uncle on UE3 and Starting Valley made in Unity
2016-10-26 11:58:19	pulec	great running games, lots of velocity
2016-10-26 11:58:31	alyptik	icc hates me
2016-10-26 11:58:33	alyptik	checking whether the C compiler works... no
2016-10-26 11:58:35	roukoswarf	when amateur programmers try and make games i cry a little.
2016-10-26 11:58:51	roukoswarf	games are some of the most painful code you can write
2016-10-26 11:58:58	roukoswarf	dont be that guy
2016-10-26 11:59:02	roukoswarf	that guy is a cunt

2016-10-26 11:59:17	pcspkr	yea I don't know why people even want to write games
2016-10-26 11:59:24	roukoswarf	did i say a bad word?
2016-10-26 11:59:34	roukoswarf	the rules here on bad words are pretty random.
2016-10-26 11:59:35	conmanworknor	Is there a repo anywhere with all the old ncc and gcc versions?
2016-10-26 11:59:50	pcspkr	roukoswarf: some classes are more protected than others
2016-10-26 11:59:50	pulec	making a good game is crazy task
2016-10-26 12:00:00	pulec	I am just enjoying the prototyping now
2016-10-26 12:00:21	roukoswarf	conmanworknor: you can get source from the repos and build it
2016-10-26 12:00:25	roukoswarf	gcc has many mirrors

2016-10-26 13:46:29	sudokode	that's what I narrowed it down to and I couldn't find any docs on how to properly specify a list
2016-10-26 13:46:49	sudokode	aside from some mapping shit, but it wouldn't work for ports. so I just went back to iptables
2016-10-26 13:47:26	alyptik	i pretty much just use it because i can remember the commands offhand hah
2016-10-26 13:47:32	alyptik	i always fuck up iptables
2016-10-26 13:48:09	sudokode	meh.. it's been a while. I was interested in nftables when it first came out, and I used it enough to start the wiki page
2016-10-26 13:48:25	alyptik	i dont masq and stuff much
2016-10-26 13:48:28	alyptik	not sure how well that is handled
2016-10-26 13:48:58	sudokode	back then, atomic rule loading wasn't even possible. you had to flush each chain, then each table, then load the new rules
2016-10-26 13:49:05	sudokode	what a pita
2016-10-26 13:49:11	sudokode	then flush ruleset came out
2016-10-26 13:49:28	sudokode	or got documented probably
2016-10-26 13:50:16	alyptik	oh yeah i jumped on train way after atomic
2016-10-26 13:50:21	alyptik	was the main pull for me tbh
2016-10-26 13:50:58	polyzen	que eso
2016-10-26 13:52:00	mnrmnaugh	you have to many letters, its qeuso
2016-10-26 13:52:04	alyptik	oh and the log and counter are cool as hell
2016-10-26 13:52:16	mnrmnaugh	er. yeah.. 
2016-10-26 13:52:35	sudokode	alyptik: I mean.. iptables has all those features...
2016-10-26 13:52:47	sudokode	nftables maybes the counters a little more useful
2016-10-26 13:52:50	sudokode	makes
2016-10-26 13:52:58	alyptik	is counter in iptables?
2016-10-26 13:53:05	alyptik	i know log is
2016-10-26 13:53:26	polyzen	I just use Comodo Firewall
2016-10-26 13:53:54	alyptik	but something like something like `limit rate 1/second counter accept`

2016-10-26 13:54:29	alyptik	yeah this is why i shied away from iptables hah
2016-10-26 13:54:46	alyptik	i ended up blindly following tuts like this way back
2016-10-26 13:54:55	alyptik	nowadays makes more sense but i am tired of manopages
2016-10-26 13:55:27	alyptik	tbh not even sure why i run nftables on my local machine with no WAN
2016-10-26 13:55:28	sudokode	alyptik: counters are enabled by default in iptables. you just have to enable them in nftables..
2016-10-26 13:55:33	sudokode	pretty much the only difference
2016-10-26 13:55:37	alyptik	oh didn't know that
2016-10-26 13:56:30	sudokode	alyptik: yeah, so basically just iptables -vL to see them

2016-10-26 20:46:37	alyptik	algebra,trig, and calc not so much unless you are doing math stuff
2016-10-26 20:46:48	alyptik	ap0c› what part of game design
2016-10-26 20:46:50	ap0c	so I figured I would just go back at it
2016-10-26 20:46:55	alyptik	there are like a billion jobs
2016-10-26 20:47:03	ap0c	not job, making my own 2d games etc.
2016-10-26 20:47:11	alyptik	oh
2016-10-26 20:47:24	alyptik	bruh no need math for that unless you want like HL phys
2016-10-26 20:47:40	alyptik	if you know what hex binary and octal are you are good

2016-10-26 20:49:18	alyptik	you are great then
2016-10-26 20:49:25	alyptik	the hard part is the graphics engine

2016-10-26 20:50:26	ap0c	I am learning Python at the moment, Think Python was getting a little heavy for me on the exercises (draw turtle pies, make function for each letter in alphabet to draw each letter with turtle, etc.) 
2016-10-26 20:50:43	alyptik	not sure if games + python work
2016-10-26 20:50:54	ap0c	for 2d games it's fine

2016-10-27 04:17:14	voidead	so what do you guys think.. someone was bitching about the minor discrepancy of having a website with not http:// redirect to https:// is a redirect necessary? Or is it better to just have your site be accessible only via https:// and have the HSTS policy cache from the https version

2016-10-27 04:19:13	conmanworknor	I think the best practice is a redirect
2016-10-27 04:19:42	voidead	change "not" to "no"

2016-10-27 04:20:09	dunz0r	You could MITM the redirect.

2016-10-27 04:21:08	meskarune	voidead: so like, it depends on what browsers you want to support, and if you will ever use non-https
2016-10-27 04:21:24	dunz0r	And how anal you want to be about security.
2016-10-27 04:21:26	voidead	well I have a site which I just happened to only configure for https:// I wasn't really concerned with the http:// section.. little did I know it would attract a bunch of pendantic assholes who bitched and complained about no redirect for a few hours..

2016-10-27 04:22:26	conmanworknor	cookbook, playbook, module, can we just stick to one word
2016-10-27 04:22:26	meskarune	voidead: most people do the redirect, and I do as well simply because at this point users expect it, but some might consider that dumb 
2016-10-27 04:22:42	meskarune	since everything should be https and it should be pushed always
2016-10-27 04:22:51	voidead	of course.. my friend typed in the http:// in qutebrowser and was like "holy shit your site doesn't work WHY only https://" blah blah
2016-10-27 04:23:09	conmanworknor	did he type in www. too
2016-10-27 04:23:13	voidead	lol
2016-10-27 04:23:16	voidead	well anyways
2016-10-27 04:23:22	voidead	it was an annoying conversation
2016-10-27 04:23:25	meskarune	voidead: well, a redirect is easy enough to add
2016-10-27 04:23:31	voidead	but I'd rather ask an expert on the matter
2016-10-27 04:23:32	meskarune	and it supports all older browsers
2016-10-27 04:23:53	meskarune	and most browsers will also remember that people use https and then automagically do that
2016-10-27 04:24:03	voidead	meskarune› but yeah I think I will add a redirect.. but ultimately I am not concerned with visitors to the site at all since its my own personal site
2016-10-27 04:24:13	conmanworknor	are ssl certs free?

2016-10-27 04:24:22	meskarune	so I actually use redirects on my own sites because of the wider browser support and its a behaviore that users expect
2016-10-27 04:24:23	voidead	yes

2016-10-27 04:24:52	voidead	mine are free.. I made them via letsencrypt
2016-10-27 04:25:02	demize	voidead: Problem is that most browsers don't try https first and then fall back to http.
2016-10-27 04:25:09	voidead	demize› true
2016-10-27 04:25:10	meskarune	but if you wanted to do the HSTS policy, I think its totally valid to tell people to fuck off who complain lol
2016-10-27 04:25:10	dunz0r	Although, there's this one site that doesn't... I should fix that.
2016-10-27 04:25:16	meskarune	becuase everything should be https
2016-10-27 04:25:18	meskarune	by default
2016-10-27 04:25:25	demize	voidead: Meaning that for most users it would just seem to be down.

2016-10-27 04:26:20	meskarune	voidead: if you are hosting your resume or have a site making money though... def do the redirect
2016-10-27 04:26:43	voidead	meskarune› the reason I was annoyed was because they were under the impression that there _must_ be a redirect otherwise the site is a "piece of shit" which I find pretty stupid and counter-intuitive.. the whole reason I focused on https:// in the first place was because I was concerned with security.. my site has an A+ rating from the ssl test.. so *shrugs* I sort of don't give a fuck

2016-10-27 04:32:18	demize	It's unlikely that http will every vanish, because it's still the simplest choice for simple one-off tests and such.

2016-10-27 04:33:34	meskarune	demize: I actually do know of quite a few apps that don't support https, but only becuase the dev is lazy and hasn't added in a wrapper for it

2016-10-27 04:33:50	voidead	I know mpd will only stream via http:// but that can be fixed or worked around
2016-10-27 04:33:53	meskarune	plenty of scripts don't
2016-10-27 04:34:43	meskarune	it *is* more work to write code for the hand shake 
2016-10-27 04:34:49	minimalism	by the time https is everywhere and plain http is not used at all, we'll probably have Ultra or Super SSL with secure:// or something
2016-10-27 04:34:52	meskarune	but like, still
2016-10-27 04:34:56	minimalism	and then https will be a lame terrible thing like http is now

2016-10-27 04:35:52	voidead	thats what I was referring to
2016-10-27 04:36:02	voidead	you can get around it
2016-10-27 04:36:16	voidead	its still sort of awkward that it doesn't use https
2016-10-27 04:36:29	voidead	in fact.. one of the devs for mpd HATES that it can stream
2016-10-27 04:36:35	voidead	and wants it gone
2016-10-27 04:37:00	voidead	but the consensus is that people like mpd's streaming capability
2016-10-27 04:37:01	meskarune	I can sorta understand that
2016-10-27 04:37:02	minimalism	I know that I use it locally only, but isn't streaming almost its entire purpose?

2016-10-27 18:30:02	phillid	I initially thought grawity had lagged, causing it, but I was the one who lagged
2016-10-27 18:30:03	grawity	[the flood detection algorithm was taken from atheme, by the way]
2016-10-27 18:30:17	phillid	Out of curiosity, does it account for lag in itself?
2016-10-27 18:30:38	phillid	Or will it blitz everyone if it lags badly one day?
2016-10-27 18:33:32	grawity	hmm
2016-10-27 18:34:29	grawity	bad lag usually means either messages just delayed (but with the same relative times), or buffered (until a single burst at the end)
2016-10-27 18:34:49	grawity	in the latter case, I'm not sure
2016-10-27 18:35:15	phillid	I was thinking evilgrawity may perceive the latter case as a bunch of people flooding
2016-10-27 18:35:37	phillid	It would be amusing to witness though
2016-10-27 18:36:54	grawity	speaking of which, I wonder if there's a way to make cacti/rrdtool ignore spikes in traffic
2016-10-27 18:38:26	grawity	like, when the average is ~20 Mbps but then there's a short LAN transfer at ~300 Mbps, it scales the whole graph down to a thin line

2016-10-27 23:35:12	Desu	phrillid: because people want both 2.4 and 5ghz

2016-10-27 23:37:41	icebal	not a fan of the consumer spider routers
2016-10-27 23:37:58	Desu	Ubiquiti is the IoT of routers/ap
2016-10-27 23:38:09	icebal	how so?
2016-10-27 23:38:43	Desu	ancient unpatched kernels, epic security fails every other week, overpriced and overhyped, windows only giant java mess to control it etc
2016-10-27 23:39:04	icebal	windows...only...java
2016-10-27 23:39:13	Desu	and more buzzwords than a "cloud" company
2016-10-27 23:39:17	icebal	mine is running in a linux docker man

2016-10-27 23:39:50	Jeffrey81	What do you mean windows only?
2016-10-27 23:39:59	icebal	never seen any management app, only the controller that is java based
2016-10-27 23:40:03	Jeffrey81	I'm controlling it from arch
2016-10-27 23:40:05	icebal	and is controlled via web
2016-10-27 23:40:21	Desu	icebal: not the toy one, the propper "enteprise" one
2016-10-27 23:40:25	icebal	price for the AP is deliciously low
2016-10-27 23:40:49	Desu	for the performance the price is pretty bad
2016-10-27 23:41:28	Desu	200€ for a ap with crappy internal antennas that only does single channel
2016-10-27 23:41:33	Desu	not impressed
2016-10-27 23:41:56	icebal	when was the last time you looked at these?
2016-10-27 23:42:04	Desu	about 10 sec ago
2016-10-27 23:42:34	Desu	cheapest price for the uap-pro here in norway: 220€ including cat
2016-10-27 23:42:35	Desu	vat*
2016-10-27 23:42:38	icebal	also, price definitely differs, here in the US they are about the same price as a upper middle tier router
2016-10-27 23:43:06	Desu	~100€ for the 2.4ghz only one
2016-10-27 23:43:08	icebal	i ahve the ap-lr, performance has never waivered, and the strength of the signal is amazing
2016-10-27 23:43:17	Desu	icebal: 2.4GHz only == fail
2016-10-27 23:43:41	icebal	wired house with only a laptop, cell phone, and chromecast == win
2016-10-27 23:43:46	Desu	unless you live in the middle of nowhere where there isn't a congestion on the 2.4GHz band
2016-10-27 23:44:01	Desu	and don't mind slow speeds
2016-10-27 23:44:07	grawity	Desu: which one is the 'enterprise' app?
2016-10-27 23:44:24	icebal	i have had 0 issues in the last year and a half with it. no downtime, no issues, no lag or anything
2016-10-27 23:44:28	grawity	as far as I could find, there's only one kind of Unifi controller
2016-10-27 23:44:36	grawity	#linode: <putty> How many IP addresses can we have on a cloud?
2016-10-27 23:44:37	Desu	can't remember what the thing is called, it is for their carrier grade stuff
2016-10-27 23:44:43	Desu	not the prosumer gear
2016-10-27 23:45:03	icebal	will the switches, routers and APs all use the same controller
2016-10-27 23:45:13	icebal	same with the video sidde

2016-10-27 23:49:06	Desu	the server bundle that did accounting, interconnect with the backbone etc was sold as blackbox, couldn't even pick your own hardware
2016-10-27 23:49:15	icebal	thats the only thing ive not liked about it so far, and even then, the controller was made correctly so none of the usual java dirtyness
2016-10-27 23:49:40	icebal	Desu, what AP would you recommend then that isnt cisco?
2016-10-27 23:49:47	jelle	ok git pre commit grunt hook is fun except for fixups

2016-10-27 23:51:14	Desu	icebal: at work we got most from a local company that basicly made their own
2016-10-27 23:51:23	icebal	i will say ubiquiti used to be complete crap, but today its the best bang for its buck
2016-10-27 23:51:54	Desu	icebal: design based on the microtic devices but with a different wifi chip and power circuit, and with a much better case
2016-10-27 23:52:13	icebal	that doesnt either 1. need rebooting every once in a while, 2. doesnt use as much electriciy as my server, or 3. cisco tax
2016-10-27 23:52:46	icebal	microtik does routers tho, not APs AFAIK
2016-10-27 23:53:12	demize	They do both.
2016-10-27 23:53:13	Desu	icebal: hid the router itself over dropdown celings etc and used external antennas
2016-10-27 23:53:43	icebal	now zebra APs, those might be good. havent had a chance to look into them
2016-10-27 23:53:54	Desu	external antenna support is a godsent when doing wifi in older buildings and industrial sites
2016-10-27 23:53:56	icebal	our enviroment is split Zebra and Cisco

2016-10-28 04:27:36	jelle	eto: hmm?
2016-10-28 04:27:46	eto	jelle: since i started messing with php at lower level, i learning it leaks suprisingly low amount of mem

2016-10-28 04:28:05	eto	jelle: certainly less than firefox

2016-10-28 04:30:17	eto	so let's say it's php standard - after all zval change was rather drastic. at first i thought it's cosmetic but man i was so wrong

2016-10-28 06:27:59	deltasquared	I've never really seen the use in refactoring tools, what would be the coolest thing I could do with it that sed/grep couldnae do?
2016-10-28 06:28:15	deltasquared	like, say, renaming a class and modifying all consumers to match it
2016-10-28 06:28:21	alyptik	i was mostly just under the impression it was not feasible in vim
2016-10-28 06:28:25	Boohbah	I think they're just for people that didn't bother to learn how to use the real tools.
2016-10-28 06:28:39	deltasquared	I wouldn't trust auto-generated refactorings to produce OO patterns for example

2016-10-28 14:13:33	mpan	It’s all about the cost. All crypto algos are in theory easily broken. Just it’s too expensive to do so. For example it’s not possible to brute force a 256-bit key, according to physics (the minimum amount energy needed for that is larger than the amount energy to be expected to be in whole observable universe, including energy we could get from converting matter to energy).
2016-10-28 14:13:39	Max-P	Yeah just read the page, that's about what I thought about it already. Still a quite good read tho! I always use /dev/urandom myself anyway. The only times I ever bother with /dev/random is when really want to reseed as much as possible, but that's definitely just as overkill as the key sizes I generate with it
2016-10-28 14:14:27	alyptik	mpan› and yet people use 2048-bit shit; that is an interesting fact

2016-10-28 14:15:42	mpan	They use 2048b or bigger keys not because they’re afraid someone will bruteforce a 256-bit key, but because attacks exists (non-bruteforce) that allow finding out the smaller keys.

2016-10-28 14:17:18	alyptik	gg me
2016-10-28 14:17:38	sheep	even with a bruteforce attack against RSA, you only need to factor one prime

2016-10-28 14:17:43	mpan	alyptik: but while it’s a cert protocol, it’s used for assymetric encryption.

2016-10-28 14:18:00	sheep	at least one of the primes must be less than or equal to the square root of the modulus
2016-10-28 14:18:30	Max-P	alyptik: to take the cert you set up earlier for example, this is what I got when connected to it: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
2016-10-28 14:18:33	sheep	so, instead of 2^2048 possible primes to search, you only have to search sqrt(2^2048) or 2^1024
2016-10-28 14:18:38	mpan	Square root means just, approximately, half of the bit length ;)
2016-10-28 14:19:04	sheep	there are also fast primality tests, so the number of primes is less than Li(2^(bits/2))
2016-10-28 14:19:13	sheep	where Li is the logarithmic integral
2016-10-28 14:20:05	alyptik	i feel like i am in ##math again where i am wikipedia'ing every other word 
2016-10-28 14:20:17	Max-P	there's several algorithms used there as part of the TLS protocol. In that example, RSA is used for the exchange of the symmetric keys for the AES-GCM algorithm, and things are hashed with sha384 for some other purposes
2016-10-28 14:20:28	mpan	That’s good. Let your brain fetch some fresh knowledge!
2016-10-28 14:20:37	Max-P	And (I think) the keys for RSA come from the ECDHE exchange
2016-10-28 14:21:09	sheep	no the RSA keys don't
2016-10-28 14:21:11	Max-P	so, overall, I don't touch crypto with a 10 feet pole.
2016-10-28 14:21:14	mpan	Max-P: but since DH is MitM-able, you need a certificate to prove that the key actually comes from the other side.
2016-10-28 14:21:23	sheep	if you use ECDHE, then TLS only uses ECDHE to get the master secret
2016-10-28 14:21:57	sheep	it will use the signing algorithm (usually RSA) to sign the public part of its ephemeral ECDHE key
2016-10-28 14:22:17	Max-P	Ah, so I had it backwards then
2016-10-28 14:23:03	alyptik	lol at http://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom/structure-no.png vs http://www.2uo.de/myths-about-urandom/structure-yes.png
2016-10-28 14:23:24	alyptik	i have been thinking of first one for as long as i first knew about /dev/random
2016-10-28 14:23:35	mpan	Everyone did… :D
2016-10-28 14:24:47	Max-P	Hence why the best crypto advice is: if you don't know how it works, don't even consider touching it and just use existing, well known and reviewed libraries!
2016-10-28 14:25:27	sheep	or "if you're not a professional cryptographer, don't make cryptography"
2016-10-28 14:25:34	mpan	For example: Bernstein’s NaCl.
2016-10-28 14:26:02	sheep	"if you are a professional cryptographer, make sure at least a dozen others check out what you wrote before it goes into production"
2016-10-28 14:26:02		[14:26]
2016-10-28 14:26:05	Max-P	reminds me the time I used xor as crypto and thought it was clever. Yeah.
2016-10-28 14:26:23	sheep	xor is great if you have a one-time pad
2016-10-28 14:26:24	mpan	Max-P: xor is a good way to crypto. It is actually widely used.
2016-10-28 14:26:49	sheep	the problem is that one-time pads have to be truly random and have to be the same size as the plaintext
2016-10-28 14:27:14	javaisnom	"unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "murrine", RIP skype
2016-10-28 14:27:19	mpan	sheep: xor is good with any scheme. AES encryption is actually using simple xor.
2016-10-28 14:27:33	sheep	but it also uses a bunch of other stuff
2016-10-28 14:27:34	Max-P	So, definitely not a plaintext password in a loop with partly known contents
2016-10-28 14:27:38	mpan	I can barely think now of any popular algorithm which doesn’t.
2016-10-28 14:27:43	mpan	Max-P: yes.
2016-10-28 14:27:46	alyptik	so pretty much random is used as some sort of super paranoid future proofing?
2016-10-28 14:27:52	alyptik	vs urandom
2016-10-28 14:28:10	mpan	sheep: not really. AES is just a CSPRNG that has its output XORed with paintext.
2016-10-28 14:28:39	sheep	isn't that more applicable to stream ciphers than block ciphers?
2016-10-28 14:28:43	mpan	sheep: in various block modes output of the previous stage is feed into that generator, but that’s all.
2016-10-28 14:28:53	mpan	*various stream modes
2016-10-28 14:29:07	alyptik	'Such an attack is not known in “unclassified literature”, but the NSA certainly has one in store, right? And if you're really concerned about this (you should!), please use /dev/random, and all your problems are solved.'
2016-10-28 14:29:10	alyptik	They are in my head
2016-10-28 14:29:15	sheep	not CBC
2016-10-28 14:30:10	mpan	alyptik: unfortunately we can only guess what state players can do. But it’s more probable that they have broken encryption algorithm itself.

2016-10-28 14:33:40	mpan	sheep: ok, it uses it for decryption in straightforward way. Indeed (just checked on Wiki) for encryption XOR is used first and then it is used to produce both ciphertext and value for the next step. But I would say it’s just a non-obvious way of XORing plaintext.

2016-10-28 16:45:28	mpan	We should switch to a 1-hour clock and express time of a day as floats. There would be no am/pm problem then.

2016-10-28 16:52:36	conmanworknor	mpan: not having ntp on your car's clock
2016-10-28 16:52:39	camelid	some are annoying and will only increment, so you have to increment 11 hours
2016-10-28 16:52:45	camelid	but most will let you use the dial to just go back one
2016-10-28 16:52:45	mpan	camelid: cars — no. But I have better things to do than setting time with one-button interface.
2016-10-28 16:52:51	camelid	lol, fair

2016-10-28 17:14:06	mpan	flash is deprecated since it has been conceived.

2016-10-28 17:14:26	alyptik	when i say need i mean you can't get this service unless you have flash
2016-10-28 17:14:34	conmanworknor	Apple killed flash
2016-10-28 17:14:35	alyptik	netflix has lots of other ways to acess it
2016-10-28 17:14:38	conmanworknor	thats the only reason i like flash
2016-10-28 17:15:04	tbo	html5 killed flash
2016-10-28 17:15:04		[17:15]
2016-10-28 17:15:12	conmanworknor	nah flash was dead before that
2016-10-28 17:15:35	mpan	It was a stillborn.

2016-10-28 17:15:54	conmanworknor	kinda an anti-arch stance to take
2016-10-28 17:15:57	conmanworknor	but it worked
2016-10-28 17:16:11	alyptik	it's not that, it's just so bloated for what you get
2016-10-28 17:16:13	tbo	conmanworknor: because it comes with widevine
2016-10-28 17:16:36	alyptik	for example xorg is bloat but welp you get moneys worth at least

2016-10-28 17:16:56	conmanworknor	X11 anyway
2016-10-28 17:16:59	alyptik	but it is fat
2016-10-28 17:17:06	tbo	alyptik: I hope in ten years X11 will be a distant memory, like Mir.

2016-10-28 17:27:22	mpan	Enter key has to be big, because it takes the most of the pressure during intense discussions on teh net!
2016-10-28 17:27:45	Ipsilon	my friend got 5 nixie tubs from one of the lab equipments they were throwing out. They are pretty cool
2016-10-28 17:28:13	rfleming	only place you can really get new nixie tubes is out of russia...
2016-10-28 17:28:18	conmanworknor	yup

2016-10-28 17:59:49	alyptik	i lost count 
2016-10-28 17:59:55	phrillid	I never used to use numbers in vim, then I tried it
2016-10-28 18:00:03	meskarune	o_O
2016-10-28 18:00:05	conmanworknor	im torn on it honestly
2016-10-28 18:00:08	meskarune	how do you live without line numbers
2016-10-28 18:00:10	phrillid	It was disgusting at first, but I was forced and then it felt good
2016-10-28 18:00:13	alyptik	set rnu for maximum lag
2016-10-28 18:00:14	meskarune	you can jump around with :N
2016-10-28 18:00:25	conmanworknor	it doesnt work well with copy paste outside of vim registers
2016-10-28 18:00:38	alyptik	huh
2016-10-28 18:00:38		[18:00]
2016-10-28 18:00:41	phrillid	Yeah I knew the current line number from the status line
2016-10-28 18:00:44	phrillid	meskarune, ^
2016-10-28 18:00:57	meskarune	but you would still need other line numbers
2016-10-28 18:01:09	phrillid	lol alyptik 
2016-10-28 18:01:15	alyptik	use clipboard unnamed plus for clipboard stuff
2016-10-28 18:01:19	meskarune	like if you wanted to jump to line 234 you type ":234"
2016-10-28 18:01:24	conmanworknor	^

2016-10-28 18:01:51	alyptik	LOL
2016-10-28 18:01:55	phrillid	gg234 doesn't work for me
2016-10-28 18:02:00	meskarune	vim is a beautiful diaster
2016-10-28 18:02:01	alyptik	huh
2016-10-28 18:02:03	phrillid	It just goes to the start of file, because gg
2016-10-28 18:02:07	alyptik	it does for me
2016-10-28 18:02:07	nshp	234G is where it's at
2016-10-28 18:02:12	alyptik	da fuq

2016-10-28 18:02:22	phrillid	til
2016-10-28 18:02:26	phrillid	One question
2016-10-28 18:02:30	phrillid	But why, vim?
2016-10-28 18:02:40	conmanworknor	as opposed to vi?
2016-10-28 18:02:43	phrillid	alyptik, rnu is my new arch enemy, thanks
2016-10-28 18:02:50	alyptik	because notepad is windows only 
2016-10-28 18:02:50	meskarune	I use it because I am too used to it now
2016-10-28 18:02:58	phrillid	Same
2016-10-28 18:02:58	conmanworknor	lol not even notepad++
2016-10-28 18:03:01	conmanworknor	just regular notepad
2016-10-28 18:03:02	meskarune	so I can't even use anything else
2016-10-28 18:03:03	alyptik	and vi is for when you need maximum speed
2016-10-28 18:03:07	meskarune	I'm like an old person
2016-10-28 18:03:09	phrillid	I used to use nano like all sensible people
2016-10-28 18:03:10	meskarune	who can't change
2016-10-28 18:03:16	conmanworknor	!vomit
2016-10-28 18:03:18	phrik	BAAARRRRRRFFFFF!!!
2016-10-28 18:03:18	alyptik	s/vi/ed
2016-10-28 18:03:19	meskarune	because I already spent too much time on one thing
2016-10-28 18:03:27	meskarune	and now its just too late for me
2016-10-28 18:03:56	conmanworknor	i used to be super intimidated by vim
2016-10-28 18:03:56	nshp	s/ed/rappel
2016-10-28 18:04:06	conmanworknor	its honestly just more productive
2016-10-28 18:04:12	conmanworknor	get in and out quick
2016-10-28 18:04:16	conmanworknor	do your thing
2016-10-28 18:04:20	phrillid	According to my uni colleagues I fit the stereotype of a hardcore graybeard
2016-10-28 18:04:32	alyptik	greybeard*
2016-10-28 18:04:43	conmanworknor	uni colleagues are 90% macfags in my exp
2016-10-28 18:05:00	conmanworknor	so i dont understand the problem
2016-10-28 18:05:13	phrillid	No, mac users take commerce
2016-10-28 18:05:20	phrillid	I am in Engineering
2016-10-28 18:05:34	phrillid	Probably 80% windows 10% linux 10% mac
2016-10-28 18:05:40	conmanworknor	yeah my school had 90% macbookpros in CS major
2016-10-28 18:05:49	conmanworknor	it was a tough few years
2016-10-28 18:05:49	phrillid	Oh that's weird
2016-10-28 18:05:53	phrillid	!hipster
2016-10-28 18:05:54	phrik	I liked systemd before it was cool.
2016-10-28 18:06:01	conmanworknor	the teachers of course were all mac haters
2016-10-28 18:06:05	phrillid	kek

2016-10-28 18:06:40	phrillid	sysvinit is like my ex that dumped me
2016-10-28 18:06:52	alyptik	!grab phrillid
2016-10-28 18:06:53	phrik	alyptik: Tada!
2016-10-28 18:06:54	conmanworknor	i've had to get used to it
2016-10-28 18:06:58	conmanworknor	since my work uses amazon linux
2016-10-28 18:07:04	phrillid	Good.
2016-10-28 18:07:09	conmanworknor	it is absurd, dude
2016-10-28 18:07:24	phrillid	I like a well-rounded user
2016-10-28 18:07:45	phrillid	They're easier to coerce into being exclusive to the things I agree with, compared to people who already made their mind up
2016-10-28 18:07:51	phrillid	☺
2016-10-28 18:08:06	camelid	lol
2016-10-28 18:08:08	conmanworknor	i was totally willing to believe it was superior
2016-10-28 18:08:27	conmanworknor	then i had to write an init.d/ entry
2016-10-28 18:08:34	phrillid	Which did you use first, out of interest?
2016-10-28 18:08:42	conmanworknor	systemd
2016-10-28 18:08:48	phrillid	Righto
2016-10-28 18:09:05	camelid	conmanworknor: did you linux before systemd was a thing?
2016-10-28 18:09:12	<--	admin_001 (~admin_001@180.190.89.19) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2016-10-28 18:09:49	conmanworknor	lol yes
2016-10-28 18:10:48	conmanworknor	but to be fair i didn't arch until systemd was a thing

2016-10-28 18:18:28	phrillid	lol alyptik 
2016-10-28 18:18:35	phrillid	All of the core range is pretty solid
2016-10-28 18:18:37	conmanworknor	my work gave me a macbookpro, so far the only thing it's good for is feeling like i'm about to get robbed on the subway
2016-10-28 18:18:39	phrillid	*Core
2016-10-28 18:19:05	camelid	yeah, i decided i'd rather have the Core line and less cores than go AMD with more cores
2016-10-28 18:19:10	camelid	because more != better
2016-10-28 18:19:20	phrillid	Especially with AMD's outdated range
2016-10-28 18:19:41	phrillid	I mean, they're not *bad* for desktop processors
2016-10-28 18:19:50	phrillid	But Intel is "better" at the moment
2016-10-28 18:19:56	conmanworknor	fuckit, AMD is cheaper than dirt
2016-10-28 18:19:59	conmanworknor	never change
2016-10-28 18:20:29	phrillid	I was gonna go AMD when I was looking at a more basic build, but it's only the CPU and RAM that's cheaper (DDR3)
2016-10-28 18:20:44	phrillid	Everything else was the same or more, so it nearly balanced out
2016-10-28 18:20:53	nshp	MBPs are so bad at life
2016-10-28 18:20:55	camelid	plus, AMDs use more power in general
2016-10-28 18:20:57	camelid	and run hotter
2016-10-28 18:21:10	phrillid	I was looking at an 8350, but 220 watt TDP iirc
2016-10-28 18:21:12	phrillid	Or is that the 9590?
2016-10-28 18:21:14	phrillid	Or both?
2016-10-28 18:21:19	conmanworknor	i would have given them back my mbp if they let me use my mempad

2016-10-29 01:02:51	du5tball	the only reason constant interrupts don't happen is because of design choices. nobody would want an HID that blocks anything else
2016-10-29 01:04:03	alyptik	well realtime means fully pre-emptible so if 3 ports are all running realtime and trying to send interrupts that seems like it is my issue maybe?
2016-10-29 01:04:20	alyptik	and yes it is an rt kernel

2016-10-29 01:06:23	du5tball	alyptik: usb is a bad choice for this
2016-10-29 01:06:30	alyptik	i have no other option
2016-10-29 01:06:30	du5tball	alyptik: you need a mixer
2016-10-29 01:06:32	mk-fg	And kernel talks to usb anyway
2016-10-29 01:06:34	alyptik	i have a mixer
2016-10-29 01:06:45	du5tball	yeah on your DIY rt system
2016-10-29 01:06:55	alyptik	control signal in to A/B controls the respective deck
2016-10-29 01:07:04	alyptik	A/B/C are diff outs
2016-10-29 01:07:15	alyptik	all into a mixer
2016-10-29 01:07:22	du5tball	you probably only have one usb controller, which has to handle all three inputs
2016-10-29 01:07:37	alyptik	the HID yeah
2016-10-29 01:07:39	du5tball	what you actually need is something with three controllers
2016-10-29 01:07:41	mk-fg	Sounds legit for sound card traffic though
2016-10-29 01:07:52	mk-fg	Shouldn't be that much
2016-10-29 01:07:53	alyptik	three controllers?
2016-10-29 01:07:59	du5tball	usb-controllers
2016-10-29 01:08:04	alyptik	i have 1 usb3.0 port
2016-10-29 01:08:09	du5tball	yeah, port
2016-10-29 01:08:09		[01:08]
2016-10-29 01:08:23	du5tball	but most of your ports go into a single chip that handles usb-stuffs
2016-10-29 01:08:25	alyptik	that is whole reason i am using hub heh
2016-10-29 01:08:38	alyptik	so what do you mean
2016-10-29 01:08:38	du5tball	yeeaaaah... the hub is like a network hub
2016-10-29 01:08:50	alyptik	3 usb hubs?
2016-10-29 01:08:57	du5tball	not exactly
2016-10-29 01:08:59	mk-fg	Old network hubs, that didn't buffer
2016-10-29 01:09:29	alyptik	i need a new fuckin laptop is what i need lmao
2016-10-29 01:09:37	du5tball	alyptik: the hub slices time as well, so it sends 1-2-3-1-2-3
2016-10-29 01:09:45	du5tball	you need it mixed in the hub, and then sent
2016-10-29 01:09:55	alyptik	hubs can do that?
2016-10-29 01:10:08	alyptik	wait mixed what do you mean
2016-10-29 01:10:08	du5tball	special hubs, yes
2016-10-29 01:10:35	alyptik	the signals can't be processed at all before it reaches mixxx
2016-10-29 01:10:38	du5tball	alyptik: your signals go in, and they come out one after another, in the order they came in
2016-10-29 01:10:39	alyptik	they are atimecode signals
2016-10-29 01:10:45	du5tball	alyptik: that is your issue
2016-10-29 01:10:50	alyptik	yea
2016-10-29 01:10:52	alyptik	:[
2016-10-29 01:10:55	du5tball	you'd need a special sound usb hub
2016-10-29 01:11:05	alyptik	that sounds plausible
2016-10-29 01:11:08	alyptik	what name should i google
2016-10-29 01:11:18	du5tball	basically your stuff mixes too late
2016-10-29 01:11:25	alyptik	unbuffered?
2016-10-29 01:11:53	du5tball	For this reason it’s always best to connect a soundcard or controllers with built in sound cards (Kontrol S2/S4) to a USB port on the computer. Then connect the USB hub to the other open port. You could always get a sound card with a USB hub built in, like the Novation Audiohub.
2016-10-29 01:12:06	alyptik	it definitely would be ideal
2016-10-29 01:12:31	alyptik	can't be a controller likea dj controller though

2016-10-29 01:14:23	alyptik	lol
2016-10-29 01:14:39	du5tball	geez. i only understood how isochronous sending works and know some things can send interrupts on usb. i made all the other shit up on the spot, and was right
2016-10-29 01:14:46	mk-fg	You probably have megs of buffer on your sound card

2016-10-29 01:15:49	mk-fg	And even if it did, pids that block on usb run kernel code, and also have nothing to do with that too
2016-10-29 01:16:09	du5tball	true. niceness only says what the kernel schedules. by the time niceness kicks in, it's too late

2016-10-29 01:17:02	mk-fg	It would get a bit more time-share, if needed
2016-10-29 01:17:33	mk-fg	Proper realtime is when pid hogs entire core and makes no syscalls
2016-10-29 01:17:41	mk-fg	As syscalls = run kernel code

2016-10-29 01:18:51	mk-fg	Wonder if it's possble in non -rt kernel these days too, probably not...
2016-10-29 01:19:11	alyptik	before i patched -rt in i would xrun with <40ms buffer
2016-10-29 01:19:19	alyptik	now i can do 10ms

2016-10-29 01:20:03	mk-fg	Don't you need to setup some cores to be rt-only then

2016-10-29 01:25:19	mk-fg	Allow to control time-slices way more sanely
2016-10-29 01:25:33	mk-fg	I.e. say "600ms/1s for this, and rest for whatever else"
2016-10-29 01:25:43	alyptik	oh i did setup cgroups, but didnt make any rules yet
2016-10-29 01:25:45	mk-fg	But that's not about RT anyway

2016-10-29 02:11:39	alyptik	NeoHendrix› for some reason i've always connected more without showing off the producers hard work to other than making my own. the digging for music and shit is like an itch. probably why i find audio mastering way more fun than mixing too

2016-10-29 02:12:56	alyptik	so like fusion-ish stuff?
2016-10-29 02:12:58	javaisnom	almost thought I had my OSX vm working
2016-10-29 02:13:02	NeoHendrix	im meant to be recording a cover of the monkey island theme for hackerhercules but i still havent got round to it
2016-10-29 02:13:03	alyptik	not sure exactly what it's called
2016-10-29 02:13:30	alyptik	that is awesome; songs like that are what i enjoy playing the most
2016-10-29 02:13:45	alyptik	creativeness goes a long way
2016-10-29 02:14:13	NeoHendrix	alyptik: no just a random mix of different genres. ie a random blues track, then a random shred track, then maybe a semi improv version of another random song
2016-10-29 02:14:26	NeoHendrix	bit of jazz here and there
2016-10-29 02:14:35	alyptik	yeah that is what i call"fusion"
2016-10-29 02:14:38	alyptik	prob not the right word
2016-10-29 02:14:53	NeoHendrix	well fusion would be doing that all at the same time
2016-10-29 02:15:14	alyptik	ah i see
2016-10-29 02:15:24	alyptik	so more genre jumping
2016-10-29 02:15:40	NeoHendrix	yeah
2016-10-29 02:15:43	alyptik	same vein imo
2016-10-29 02:15:49	alyptik	mixing genres is really fucking hard
2016-10-29 02:16:46	NeoHendrix	i also have my keyboard hooked up to ad2 and massive, so if i get bored of pissing about on the guitar i can spend a few minutes honking out filthy basslines at maximum volume
2016-10-29 02:16:48	alyptik	NeoHendrix› you have a soundcloud or similar?

2016-10-29 12:33:11	Lehvyn	testbench = outside of a case, basically
2016-10-29 12:33:44	Lehvyn	all the key components put together outside of the case to make sure they all work properly

2016-10-29 12:34:12	Lehvyn	that was more or less your test bench

2016-10-30 01:52:25	deltasquared	like compilers - how'd they write the first one?
2016-10-30 01:52:32	deltasquared	in assembler? so where was the first assembler?
2016-10-30 01:52:38	deltasquared	hand-crafted machine code most likely
2016-10-30 01:52:53	deltasquared	real men write their own machine code :P
2016-10-30 01:53:07	mpan	deltasquared: my father was a compiler in his youth
2016-10-30 01:53:29	deltasquared	mpan: you mean he wrote his own machine code? or just assembler level
2016-10-30 01:53:32	mpan	Yes, you read this properly: he was a compiler. He was translating programs into codes on punch cards
2016-10-30 01:53:59	deltasquared	I salute to this veteran of computing
2016-10-30 01:54:23	du5tball	deltasquared: assembler is machine code, more or less. it's just a more readable version of it
2016-10-30 01:54:48	mpan	Veteran? Let me show you veterans: http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/isa06_7.jpg
2016-10-30 01:54:48	deltasquared	did they have any structured programming back then? not syntatic programming languages like today of course, but I wonder if they had to draw diagrams
2016-10-30 01:55:06	mpan	These women are programming ENIAC.
2016-10-30 01:55:06	deltasquared	then again, back then if the program needed diagramming it was probably too complex and too large
2016-10-30 01:55:12	dunz0r	mpan: Did he make beep boop sounds while he was doing it?:P
2016-10-30 01:55:33	mpan	dunz0r: dunno :P. Certainly the puncher for the cards was doing some irritating sound :P
2016-10-30 01:55:51	 *	dunz0r would make beep boop noises and talk like a robot if he was a compiler
2016-10-30 01:56:23	mpan	But don’t forget that back then you had to put code manually into memory first, using switches (or, like with ENIAC, cables). Seem Imsai computer for example.

2016-10-30 01:58:05	mpan	I don’t remember if Imsai was capable of having punch card reader, but if it was, you had to first write a program that will later driver punch cards reader :P
2016-10-30 01:58:20	hintss	pretty sure the altair could have a punch tape reader
2016-10-30 01:58:30	deltasquared	mpan: but surely the reader was simple enough to make out of hardwired circuits?
2016-10-30 01:58:59	alyptik	ugh just looking at intel 64bit asm manual
2016-10-30 01:59:13	alyptik	your dad was prodigy 
2016-10-30 01:59:18	mpan	deltasquared: no, you were puting code using switches into memory, then the code has been run.
2016-10-30 01:59:46	deltasquared	alyptik: don't learn assembler on x86 like I tried to :/
2016-10-30 01:59:59	mpan	alyptik: back then processors were not that complex and their instruction sets didn’t required few bricks of paper for just a brief description.
2016-10-30 02:00:13	alyptik	lol I gave up on asm already sana what i need for gdb
2016-10-30 02:00:22	alyptik	sans*
2016-10-30 02:00:41	deltasquared	eh, I can generally figure out what it's doing, I just can't program on it
2016-10-30 02:00:45	alyptik	mpan: still
2016-10-30 02:00:54	deltasquared	compilers for x86 tend to not use the more esoteric instructions
2016-10-30 02:00:58	deltasquared	YMMV
2016-10-30 02:01:06	mpan	alyptik: also, you may see Cosmac 1802 for a simple instruction set. I was learning it for fun to have something to do on lectures in college. The code is so simple that for most popular opcodes I was reading them right from the hex-encoded program.
2016-10-30 02:01:33	deltasquared	I get more frustrated when I write code that is plainly vectorisable and I *don't* see AVX instructions pop out
2016-10-30 02:01:34	mpan	AVR8 family is another one with pretty simple instruction set, and it’s still used in practice.
2016-10-30 02:01:36	alyptik	x86_64 asm even has string insructions lol

2016-10-30 02:03:16	mpan	x86_64 have instructions that are more complex than many programs written 40 years ago… ;)
2016-10-30 02:03:35	alyptik	i know pokemon was written in asm
2016-10-30 02:03:40	alyptik	blows my mind 
2016-10-30 02:04:06	deltasquared	mpan: precisely. I believe RISC-V has ~40 instructions for the base "G" ISA variant, which includes integer ops (+ multiply/divide), single and double floats, and atomics
2016-10-30 02:04:54	alyptik	guh
2016-10-30 02:05:05	mpan	I don’t really get writting anything in assembly languages, at least not for bigger platforms. For microcontrollers — maybe, but not for PC/server CPUs. There may be a dozen or so people on the world now who could outperform modern compilers in this task.
2016-10-30 02:05:11	alyptik	i have troubls building a full adder sheesh
2016-10-30 02:05:24	alyptik	trouble 
2016-10-30 02:05:35	deltasquared	mpan: perhaps, except GCC and Clang don't vectorise and don't tell me why they're not with this raytracer thing I was doing
2016-10-30 02:05:54	deltasquared	so in some cases...
2016-10-30 02:05:57	mpan	deltasquared: ok, there are *some* use cases. But in general humans tend to write awful low-level code.
2016-10-30 02:06:06	deltasquared	mpan: yep, can confirm :/
2016-10-30 02:06:09	alyptik	100110
2016-10-30 02:06:22	alyptik	i just blew up a house somewhere
2016-10-30 02:06:36	deltasquared	it's a case of resorting to crappy human code when the compiler won't do at all in those cases
2016-10-30 02:06:56	mpan	What saddens me is that I still, in 2016, meet people who believe in `x << 2` is faster than `x * 4` :(.
2016-10-30 02:07:13	deltasquared	mpan: tell them about compiler passes that look for those things
2016-10-30 02:07:19	deltasquared	they'll do it anyway
2016-10-30 02:07:38	deltasquared	and the compiler will still try to use a bitshift anyway for a power of two mult
2016-10-30 02:07:56	alyptik	lol
2016-10-30 02:08:06	deltasquared	compilers these days are a case of figuring out how to reduce our abstract programs to their simplest form
2016-10-30 02:08:06	mpan	They haven’t checked what compiler does in such case. For most platforms compilers replace both `x << 1` and `x * 2` with… `x + x`, which is equally fast, but smaller.
2016-10-30 02:08:11	deltasquared	case in point: fricking templates
2016-10-30 02:08:34	deltasquared	mpan: so addl %eax, %eax?
2016-10-30 02:08:35	mpan	deltasquared: nope, it wont. For x86 and x86_64 compilers will use the swiss army knife of arithmetic: LEA.
2016-10-30 02:08:58	deltasquared	load effective address?
2016-10-30 02:09:02	deltasquared	huh.
2016-10-30 02:09:02	mpan	Ye
2016-10-30 02:09:11	alyptik	hah lea
2016-10-30 02:09:13	deltasquared	I thought that was just used for array indexing
2016-10-30 02:09:17	mpan	It does multiplication and two additions in one cycle.
2016-10-30 02:09:22	deltasquared	oh.
2016-10-30 02:09:25	deltasquared	wait but but
2016-10-30 02:09:25	alyptik	the one instruction i always remember 
2016-10-30 02:09:47	deltasquared	I guess the out-of-order engine in the CPU would figure it out anyway, but I guess the one instruction is denser
2016-10-30 02:09:57	deltasquared	instruction cache and such
2016-10-30 02:10:11	mpan	For many conditionals compilers will avoid using any conditional operations and will resort to some bitshift/bitwise/addition/multiplication magic to achieve the same result, to avoid dealing with branch prediction.
2016-10-30 02:11:20	mpan	In other words: they usually do tricks that no human would think about, based on so many factors that taking them into account manually would take too much time.

2016-10-30 02:13:18	alyptik	this spaghetti must be magic
2016-10-30 02:13:25	deltasquared	so, lea variants take a base offset and scale, lik the indirect memory address mode does?

2016-10-30 02:13:46	mpan	Yes

2016-10-30 02:25:20	mpan	Oh, I see a third one, who can’t install Arch for 2 days, 72 attempts. Strange… I did it while lying under dialisis, using LTE dongle only for accessing web (and no second computer, obviously).
2016-10-30 02:25:23	SopaXorzTaker	I need help reprogramming an Asus battery via SMBus
2016-10-30 02:25:24	deltasquared	mpan: it's a case of an incorrect layout I suspect, he can't type the "national" chars

2016-10-30 02:26:24	alyptik	i put a duracell in a rechargable dock once
2016-10-30 02:26:29	alyptik	hilarity did not ensue
2016-10-30 02:27:12	deltasquared	note to self: don't buy batteries from alyptik
2016-10-30 02:27:17	alyptik	lol'
2016-10-30 02:27:33	alyptik	it for all intent and purposes actually exploded
2016-10-30 02:27:55	deltasquared	"and we will burn him in acid!"
2016-10-30 02:28:04	deltasquared	I can't imagine a blown up battery was fun
2016-10-30 02:28:13	deltasquared	was this intentional?
2016-10-30 02:28:16	alyptik	well i was thankfully not in the room
2016-10-30 02:28:21	alyptik	i know it would break
2016-10-30 02:28:23	alyptik	didnt think explode
2016-10-30 02:28:30	alyptik	yeah to see what would happen
2016-10-30 02:28:56	deltasquared	alyptik: well like with Li-ion, you've got all that energy in a small place, what did you think would happen?
2016-10-30 02:29:05	alyptik	batteries are basically bombs i learned  that does
2016-10-30 02:29:08	alyptik	day*
2016-10-30 02:29:17	dunz0r	Woo ebay. Like 1 eur for a wall clock movement thingie
2016-10-30 02:29:18	deltasquared	case in point: recent galaxy note models
2016-10-30 02:29:29	mpan	The only thing that ever exploded for me was a bc547 (I believe it’s like 2n3904, for US folks). Or, more precisely, it vaporized.
2016-10-30 02:29:32	alyptik	deltasquared› yeah i hear it it actually ridiculous dangrous
2016-10-30 02:29:37	alyptik	like could kill you
2016-10-30 02:30:03	alyptik	damn vaporized?

2016-10-30 02:30:37	deltasquared	alyptik: lithium could be denser than it is, but the early portable phones using it also caught fire
2016-10-30 02:30:38	alyptik	image not working; keep imagining star trek
2016-10-30 02:30:42	alyptik	try another verb
2016-10-30 02:30:55	mpan	alyptik: ye… forget one resistor and it got voltage over its rating, straight from a transformer capable of delivering 250W…
2016-10-30 02:31:03	alyptik	jesus
2016-10-30 02:31:05	alyptik	that is a lot
2016-10-30 02:31:12	dunz0r	Oh. I should write a program that generates the clock-face!
2016-10-30 02:31:23	deltasquared	so what was the voltage? you only said power, not voltage/amps
2016-10-30 02:31:34	alyptik	isn't watts both?
2016-10-30 02:31:42	deltasquared	alyptik: yes, but it hides the ratio
2016-10-30 02:31:44	alyptik	ah

2016-10-30 02:32:05	mpan	deltasquared: I think it was like 50V+
2016-10-30 02:32:21	deltasquared	alyptik: a tranformer keeps constant power but transforms voltage up/down trading current down/up, respectively
2016-10-30 02:32:33	deltasquared	incidently, the way it works requires AC I believe
2016-10-30 02:32:41	deltasquared	if we're talking actual transformer coils
2016-10-30 02:32:41		[02:32]
2016-10-30 02:32:42	mpan	deltasquared: but it’s not very important after the breakdown happens, since if it happens, the current goes straight through the transistor… only the power delivered counts then.
2016-10-30 02:32:59	mpan	And this was pretty stiff transformer, so there could really be 250W delivered to such a tiny component
2016-10-30 02:33:04	alyptik	i know a bit about things like oscilattors because i like sound producution
2016-10-30 02:33:13	alyptik	but fuck if i could tell you how a transistor works
2016-10-30 02:33:19	deltasquared	mpan: magic smoke much?

2016-10-30 02:33:42	alyptik	something silicon eletrons P

2016-10-30 02:35:04	mpan	But I’m certain that the magic smoke has leaked, as the “container” ceased to exist after the incident. Only legs left.

2016-10-30 02:35:20	mpan	Well… legs and a bit melted breadboard. I have it until now :P

2016-10-30 08:25:46	sudokode	mpan: the components that consume the most power also have the best power management already..
2016-10-30 08:25:54	sudokode	CPU, GPU, monitor...
2016-10-30 08:26:09	sudokode	if the drivers don't suck

2016-10-30 20:10:56	i3_Arch	Whats the ABV of it again?
2016-10-30 20:11:00	phillid	like 11 or 12
2016-10-30 20:11:04	i3_Arch	hmm
2016-10-30 20:11:07	phillid	You can up or down it with the amount of sugar you add
2016-10-30 20:11:14	phillid	But you need a real champ of a yeast to hack it
2016-10-30 20:11:21	phillid	Like EC-1118 or something similar
2016-10-30 20:11:22	dmc	alright
2016-10-30 20:11:37	i3_Arch	Hows the taste with 11 or 12.. Not trying to go crazy or anything
2016-10-30 20:11:41	phillid	And some good nutrients, since apples are fairly devoid of yeast food aside from sugar
2016-10-30 20:11:55	phillid	It gets you in the nose like wine for sure
2016-10-30 20:12:09	i3_Arch	I honestly don't recall a cider I've tasted
2016-10-30 20:12:14	phillid	You have to be very careful with it too

2016-10-30 22:00:40	dmc	grawity, do you use Thunderbird only for NNTP?
2016-10-30 22:00:48	grawity	also for IMAP, sometimes
2016-10-30 22:01:04	grawity	and for newsfeeds
2016-10-30 22:01:11	grawity	i.e. getting the latest animes

2016-10-30 22:01:25	grawity	it's a shitty feed reader compared to *actual* feed readers
2016-10-30 22:01:30	grawity	but it's good enough for this purpose
2016-10-30 22:02:03	grawity	in fact it's probably better for this purpose than actual feed readers – doesn't overwhelm actual news
2016-10-30 22:03:55	dmc	grawity, so do you get actual news from a different source?
2016-10-30 22:03:57	alyptik	imagine if you had to parse XML by hand for a living

2016-10-31 13:00:13	mar77i	<mk-fg> so what did you break?
2016-10-31 13:00:17	mar77i	the space key!
2016-10-31 13:00:27	mk-fg	Nah, I use tabs
2016-10-31 13:00:47	mar77i	me too. but none of my coworkers need to know because git is awesome like that

2016-10-31 13:01:15	minimalism	people who use spaces.. savages
2016-10-31 13:01:26	mar77i	meh
2016-10-31 13:01:35	dmc	\o/
2016-10-31 13:01:42	mk-fg	And even more so when they mess up constantly and mix the two
2016-10-31 13:01:48	mk-fg	Which is rather common ;(
2016-10-31 13:01:55	minimalism	mixed-indent warnings are annoying
2016-10-31 13:01:57	mar77i	there are rules and there are traditions. I used to indent continuations of if/while half, but pylint wants me to double up
2016-10-31 13:01:59	dmc	haven't had that problem

2016-10-31 13:02:36	dmc	he's going places
2016-10-31 13:02:43	mar77i	mk-fg: there's expand and unexpand and a combination of both fixes everything but visually at least
2016-10-31 13:02:53	phillid	He seems thorough in other places of his coding
2016-10-31 13:02:53		[13:02]
2016-10-31 13:03:09	phillid	Just whitespace and other anal style points he's not hot on
2016-10-31 13:03:38	mar77i	meh, programs are at least machine readable.
2016-10-31 13:03:44	phillid	Like he doesn't care about `if (asdf) {` versus `if( asdf ){` or anything
2016-10-31 13:03:53	mar77i	lel
2016-10-31 13:03:58	phillid	Which, I'm not 100% anal on, but I at least try to keep my stuff consistent
2016-10-31 13:03:58	mk-fg	But whole point of code is to be human-readable
2016-10-31 13:04:05	phillid	mk-fg, very true

2016-10-31 13:05:24	phillid	mk-fg, I'm confused now; are you for or against style rules?
2016-10-31 13:05:26	phillid	Oh
2016-10-31 13:05:28	phillid	I see

2016-10-31 13:06:18	mar77i	I found one of those places today. I couldn't bear the ugly and made a cleanup commit for three different kinds of fucky
2016-10-31 13:06:39	mk-fg	Not the point of them, probably
2016-10-31 13:06:43	mk-fg	Just a nice extra
2016-10-31 13:06:48	mk-fg	For a grave price
2016-10-31 13:06:52	phillid	The problem is that some people will not accept style-fixing patches because they're butthurt about losing git blame contributions

2016-10-31 13:07:49	phillid	edgy style patches for edgy teens
2016-10-31 13:08:03	mar77i	phillid: it's not like you do *useful* things there.
2016-10-31 13:08:09	mk-fg	It almost never makes sense to accept "style-fixes"
2016-10-31 13:08:10	phillid	Well
2016-10-31 13:08:19	phillid	I fixed a bug in sent
2016-10-31 13:08:22	mk-fg	You add maintenance burden without anything useful
2016-10-31 13:08:27	phillid	Because they forgot how to fork
2016-10-31 13:08:44	mk-fg	So totally net negative for actual devs who're fine with current style

2016-10-31 13:09:01	phillid	I just think style should be done right in the first place, so I won't bother with style patches either
2016-10-31 13:09:14	mar77i	phillid: the inconsistency of suckless is the most thorough I've seen in a while.
2016-10-31 13:09:20	mk-fg	Heh, yeah, and so is everyone else ;)
2016-10-31 13:09:26	phillid	It's the most consistent inconsistency
2016-10-31 13:09:37	mk-fg	As in, "done right" in their own little way
2016-10-31 13:09:37	phillid	mar77i, did you see pickfire's wank in news@?
2016-10-31 13:10:02	mar77i	no
2016-10-31 13:10:03	phillid	So long as it's consistent across one projet
2016-10-31 13:10:06	phillid	project*
2016-10-31 13:10:35	mk-fg	Unless it's rather modular "project"
2016-10-31 13:10:38	phillid	Some of the style points I'm not too concerned about being different across projects, like the typedef thing set out in the suckess style
2016-10-31 13:10:42	phillid	mk-fg, true
2016-10-31 13:10:55	mar77i	phillid: you triggered me with fork
2016-10-31 13:11:02	phillid	mar77i, how so?
2016-10-31 13:11:18	mk-fg	Ever had fork stuck up yer bum?
2016-10-31 13:11:22	phillid	No sir
2016-10-31 13:11:26	mk-fg	Good
2016-10-31 13:11:43	mk-fg	That tends to trigger people
2016-10-31 13:11:45	phillid	There's the opportunity for a first time for everything
2016-10-31 13:11:47	mar77i	because the general absence to relevant interface aspects, structural integrity and all is just bleh
2016-10-31 13:11:53	phillid	But not a necessity
2016-10-31 13:12:05	mar77i	phillid: I once summed it up for suckless and told them.
2016-10-31 13:12:12	phillid	mar77i, fork is sexy for spawning one child
2016-10-31 13:12:14	phillid	Wow
2016-10-31 13:12:25	phillid	That felt weird, using "sexy" and "child
2016-10-31 13:12:28	phillid	in one go
2016-10-31 13:12:54	phillid	But I can agree with you on the lack of structure
2016-10-31 13:15:12	phillid	It is "less sucky" than using pthreads sometimes

2016-10-31 13:52:20	alyptik	valgrind i assume? haven't played with that much
2016-10-31 13:52:26	phillid	Nah llvm
2016-10-31 13:52:43	alyptik	oh that neither heh
2016-10-31 13:52:46	phillid	Trying to statically analyse this code, but it uses calls to die() on malloc failure
2016-10-31 13:52:56	alyptik	what does die do
2016-10-31 13:53:04	phillid	so scan-build thinks that there can still be a null-pointer dereference
2016-10-31 13:53:13	phillid	die exits the program
2016-10-31 13:53:18	phillid	Normally with an error message
2016-10-31 13:53:26	alyptik	but not like an assert
2016-10-31 13:53:30	phillid	No
2016-10-31 13:53:36	phillid	It comes from Perl
2016-10-31 13:53:42	alyptik	ah
2016-10-31 13:54:07	phillid	if (!(myfoo = malloc(1337))){die("failed to allocate muh shite!\n");}
2016-10-31 13:54:17	phillid	Normally that sort of syntax is how people implement die
2016-10-31 13:54:57	phillid	But most flow-control analyses will not dive into the function to see what happens there; they assume the function call can return
2016-10-31 13:55:42	phillid	and if die() can return, then the pointer that has nothing allocated to it can be dereferenced
2016-10-31 13:56:13	phillid	I'll just plaster `return;` after all these die()s
2016-10-31 13:56:16	phillid	temporarily
2016-10-31 13:56:21	alyptik	that is such a weird way to handle mallac error to me
2016-10-31 13:56:37	alyptik	cause i have never used perl
2016-10-31 13:56:39	alyptik	prob
2016-10-31 13:56:49	alyptik	s/llac /lloc 
2016-10-31 13:57:10	phillid	How would you handle it?
2016-10-31 13:57:10		[13:57]
2016-10-31 13:57:28	phillid	If perl had memory alloc, it would be weirder syntax

2016-10-31 13:57:45	phillid	die "Failed to foo: $!\n" unless foo();
2016-10-31 13:57:57	phillid	or foo() or die "failed to foo: $!\n";
2016-10-31 13:58:12	phillid	Or about 17 other different ways to express the same thing
2016-10-31 13:58:30	phillid	That's what I love about perl
2016-10-31 13:58:40	alyptik	if (myfoo=malloc(wee) == NUll) or something like that is what i usually do
2016-10-31 13:58:53	phillid	Same diff
2016-10-31 13:59:01	phillid	NULL is falsey in C
2016-10-31 13:59:27	phillid	So you can omit the == NULL and replace with a boolean negation
2016-10-31 13:59:34	phillid	But both are equally valid
2016-10-31 13:59:39	alyptik	so what is llvm's problem exactly
2016-10-31 13:59:46	alyptik	only die?
2016-10-31 13:59:49	phillid	Yeah
2016-10-31 13:59:55	phillid	Because die is not standard
2016-10-31 14:00:05	alyptik	yeah just replace with return i guess
2016-10-31 14:00:15	phillid	die has been implemented in this code as a wrapper around fputs and exit
2016-10-31 14:00:21	phillid	Mm
2016-10-31 14:00:43	phillid	Hackish though, I wish you could tell scan-build to treat function `foo` as ending the program flow for that function
2016-10-31 14:00:54	phillid	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-10-31 14:01:12	phillid	I might go ask in ##workingset or something
2016-10-31 14:01:16	alyptik	not sure how llvm works but that would basically just be a #DEFINE right
2016-10-31 14:01:22	phillid	not quite
2016-10-31 14:01:23	alyptik	doesn't seem like it would be too hard to do
2016-10-31 14:01:49	phillid	Oh I could rename die to die and then just write a wrapper macro
2016-10-31 14:02:00	phillid	I assume scan-build will be okay with that

2016-10-31 14:04:52	phillid	Not all functions have the same return type

2016-10-31 18:00:55	mpan	alyptik: on a concert I was taking photos and, for like 2 hours, used a box near the scene to support my head and camera. Only after the concert I’ve realized I was laying my head on a loudspeaker. Most probably I have the voice of my favourite band literally burned in the ears.
2016-10-31 18:00:56	Halfwit	I hope you fucking break your phone on the wall tomorrow, for having an app like that :p

2016-10-31 18:03:00	mpan	alyptik, BL4DE: this compensation is not always good. See sound engineers, who after some time just no longer hear that something is wrong with the sound. Or DJs who, after few hours behind the deck, start to make music louder and louder, because their hearing gets used to the sound level.
2016-10-31 18:03:01	Halfwit	conmanworknor: "no1" calls anyone with nearly the same frequency that they did 10 years ago.

2016-10-31 18:05:18	mpan	alyptik: still I’ve already seen too many examples of totally messed up sound on concerts. Few times I was literally looking at the person and showing them, if they don’t fukken hear that they start to overdrive the speakers or there is a constant small (but noticeable) feedback :(
2016-10-31 18:05:30	Halfwit	sudokode: I got the new x220, and the thing has a dock; which charges the thing (the plug in doesn't work) so now I have a laptop with the screen torn off, plugged in to my monitor

2016-10-31 20:48:20	phillid	It's all AUR, so I'd have to get an aur helper and that goes against my religion

2016-10-31 20:49:15	BL4DE	lately these couple last weeks there's been crazy amount of updates. guess cause of gnome 3.22 and 4.8 kernel?
2016-10-31 20:49:40	phillid	Maybe it's the northern autumn
2016-10-31 20:49:51	phillid	Everyone's writing their software before the snow
2016-10-31 20:50:00	phillid	So they can hibernate
2016-10-31 20:50:07	Halfwit	phillid: I just used custom scripts to makepkg, log errors, then didn't install automagically (and cower to fetch and search things)
2016-10-31 20:50:09	alyptik	phillid› how do you update your aur packages?
2016-10-31 20:50:13	alyptik	you manually rebuild?
2016-10-31 20:50:16	BL4DE	phillid: huh makes sense
2016-10-31 20:50:25	phillid	Halfwit, do you run runit?
2016-10-31 20:50:43	Halfwit	phillid: then they'd gen a repo with repose, and finally if they all built fine, i'd do an update. Took a bit more than an "aur helper", but it was much, much safer in the end
2016-10-31 20:50:48	Halfwit	yeah I do now

2016-10-31 20:52:10	Halfwit	It's not... I mean things are all compiled for Arch with systemd in mind, so really all you're sparing is the package manager, and the binaries that aren't anything to do with systemd, once you make your chain
2016-10-31 20:52:12	phillid	alyptik, but 32 threads

2016-10-31 20:52:34	Halfwit	So it's not much gained from staying on Arch, unless someone drops an alternate repo with the runit-based stuff.

2016-10-31 22:20:14	phillid	Why do we need official signature, just splort your own key into the BIOS somehow
2016-10-31 22:20:20	phillid	Oh wait people dual boot nvm
2016-10-31 22:20:31	BKC	you can put your own key in there... just saying

2016-10-31 22:20:52	alyptik	you can't boot without official sig or a proxy like shim
2016-10-31 22:21:01	alyptik	it doesn't work period
2016-10-31 22:21:18	BKC	I can...
2016-10-31 22:21:27	alyptik	BKC› yeah that's what i do, was talking more on a distro level
2016-10-31 22:21:48	alyptik	distro can't change everyone keys
2016-10-31 22:21:56	alyptik	would be horrible if you could
2016-10-31 22:21:56	BKC	put key on iso, have people inject it before install
2016-10-31 22:22:11	alyptik	put what key?
2016-10-31 22:22:25	phillid	Some arch key
2016-10-31 22:22:26	BKC	even better, make it generate (usb-keys are WRITABLE!) on install, have people inject it _after_ install :d
2016-10-31 22:22:40	phillid	But like I said, people dual-boot so it ought to be optional
2016-10-31 22:22:41	alyptik	like a shim?
2016-10-31 22:22:59	alyptik	the prebootloader thing worked fairly well, idk why it broke
2016-10-31 22:23:05	phillid	!why
2016-10-31 22:23:06	phrik	Because you touch yourself at night.
2016-10-31 22:23:09	alyptik	o
2016-10-31 22:23:18	mar77i	put key on iso, encrypt iso with key, congrats you just lost your key encrypting your shit.
2016-10-31 22:23:25	alyptik	lol
2016-10-31 22:23:42	mar77i	well, it's safer that way.
2016-10-31 22:24:40	alyptik	oh i remember why we dont use shim
2016-10-31 22:24:54	alyptik	you cant boot unsigned kernels
