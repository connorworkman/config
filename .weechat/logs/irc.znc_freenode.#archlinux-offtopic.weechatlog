2016-10-17 15:18:40	nshp	and the firmware is up to the vendor I think
2016-10-17 15:19:21	nshp	they have large bootloaders/firmware similar to UEFI, sort of
2016-10-17 15:19:34	nshp	usually u-boot or something similar
2016-10-17 15:19:50	blueblur112198	and said bootloader/firmware happens to really really suck on most android phones?

2016-10-17 15:20:35	nshp	they're usually locked down by the carrier if you get them on contract
2016-10-17 15:20:48	nshp	or in the case of samsung, they're just fuck you bootloaders

2016-10-17 15:21:19	nshp	but samsung's chromebooks running arch can be pretty sweet

2016-10-17 15:24:11	blueblur112198	you mean it takes a partition from an external drive and moves it to an internal drive?

2016-10-17 15:24:42	alyptik	yeah it can either be /storage/emulated/0 or /data

2016-10-18 00:14:23	mar77i	[10:09:20] the only thing you'll ever need to write in assembly is a c compiler. [10:09:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	NextHendrix	[10:09:39] or an assembler [10:09:39]

2016-10-18 00:14:23	mar77i	[10:11:10] oh those exist already, as unused compiler flag on a compiler you haven't heard of [10:11:10]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	mar77i	[10:11:32] (which also breaks your code because you depend on your compiler's specific UB) [10:11:32]

2016-10-18 03:17:06	Kirito	until I sat in front of a 120hz TV. Though those work by artificially increasing framerates
2016-10-18 03:17:15	Kirito	in high action scenes
2016-10-18 03:17:26	Kirito	because nothing is recorded in 120fps
2016-10-18 03:18:44	Namarrgon	the only display that provide more than 60Hz are usually those that support gsync or freesync
2016-10-18 03:18:50	Kirito	though actually I'm not sure to what extent this TV does do that, because TV is never 60fps either
2016-10-18 03:19:09	@demize	Well, some things are recorded at high frame rates, but generally because you're recording things for slo-mo. :p

2016-10-18 03:20:22	@demize	In practice, no movie and such is recorded in higher than 48Hz.

2016-10-18 03:20:35	@demize	And The Hobbit was the first to be recorded in 48Hz.

2016-10-18 03:24:02	Kirito	You could add a lot more computational power into the process by pre-encoding instead of doing it on the fly
2016-10-18 03:24:10	Kirito	so theoretically the quality could be better

2016-10-18 04:43:49	Kirito	lol, can't you just check Chromium out without history though?
2016-10-18 04:44:01	alyptik	hm?
2016-10-18 04:44:04	Kirito	It took me a while to realize that too
2016-10-18 04:44:08	alyptik	what do you mean check out

2016-10-18 04:47:28	BL4DE	well I installed windows 7 and used the DazLoader but now it wont boot. thing is grub suggest using that command but Im afraid ALL might destroy arch / partition but idk?
2016-10-18 04:48:05	alyptik	from a complete guess
2016-10-18 04:48:22	alyptik	it fixes a bootsector (idk what nt60 is) --force

2016-10-18 06:43:47	BL4DE	mpan: I mean the worst DRM is always connected. local DRMs like steams drm for singleplayer games never stopped warez groups. but in any case pirated games are usually unplayable online unless theres a LAN mode with which you can use Hamachi, Tunggle and whatnot to simulate LAN on actual internet connection
2016-10-18 06:44:44	mk-fg	But people want online multiplayer

2016-10-18 06:48:17	mpan	BL4DE: I don’t say that DRM itself is what halts cracking Denuvo-restricted games. But I doubt that mere obfuscation or complex tricks (this is what typical anticrack soft uses) alone would work. In combination with DRM techs, they can.
2016-10-18 06:48:18	BL4DE	tomb raider, doom have been cracked
2016-10-18 06:48:37	NextHendrix	wont be long before games require a usb licenser

2016-10-18 06:49:12	NextHendrix	they do it for all the music production stuff
2016-10-18 06:49:18	BL4DE	sangy: but just cause 3 hasnt been cracked yet. it sucks anyway. also metal gear solid uses some sort of bypass
2016-10-18 06:49:32	mk-fg	Yeah, CAD stuff usually also comes with smartcards
2016-10-18 06:49:35	NextHendrix	if you're planning on doing music prod legally, you better hope you've got 5+ usb ports for all the damn usb licensers

2016-10-18 06:53:41	NextHendrix	or even stream
2016-10-18 06:53:51	Kirito	streaming games over the net has existed for years now

2016-10-18 06:55:30	BL4DE	I guess problem with Denuvo it will take significantly longer than before. Less games will be cracked. Remember the days when games used to get cracked before launching on steam. tho guess it's fair for game companies to have headstart for couple of months to not get hit
2016-10-18 06:56:06	mar77i	hmm, don't they get the experience and reactiveness up by saving bandwidth using at least a bit compression?
2016-10-18 06:56:50	NextHendrix	that drm on arma 2 was pretty annoying
2016-10-18 06:57:00	NextHendrix	FADE i think it was called

2016-10-18 06:57:36	NextHendrix	hows steam in home streaming doing these days
2016-10-18 06:57:50	NextHendrix	haven't tried it in ages, has it improved since release?
2016-10-18 06:57:58	Kirito	Steam link is a bit flaky and annoying to set up, but it seems to work well otherwise

2016-10-18 06:59:02	sangy	mpan: fully homomorphic encryption will make drm really interesting, but we'll have to wait a little for that
2016-10-18 06:59:22	NextHendrix	BL4DE: ive never tried 3
2016-10-18 06:59:45	Kirito	I haven't pirated video games since I was a minor.
2016-10-18 06:59:46	NextHendrix	no GPU in my desktop at the minute, heavily abused 7870XT died a while back
2016-10-18 06:59:59	NextHendrix	had no fan at all for about 2 years
2016-10-18 07:00:09	Kirito	because I got a job and started paying for games
2016-10-18 07:00:36	BL4DE	NextHendrix: virtual programming made eon linux and mac ports of arma 3 but unfortunately its always lagging 1-2 releases behind windows. probably when they stop developing arma 3. linux client will be compatible with windows playerbase
2016-10-18 07:00:41	Kirito	especially today with Steam Sales, Humble Bundle's and so on
2016-10-18 07:01:12	NextHendrix	i barely play games at all these days
2016-10-18 07:01:34	NextHendrix	played some TIS-100 the other day
2016-10-18 07:01:38	Kirito	neither do I honestly
2016-10-18 07:01:39	NextHendrix	not sure if that even really counts
2016-10-18 07:01:55	NextHendrix	felt more productive than what i stopped doing to play it
2016-10-18 07:01:58	Kirito	I've got probably 100 games on Steam I got during summer sales and such I still haven't played, haha

2016-10-18 07:04:39	BL4DE	but yeah I also lost interest in gaming. especially AAA games where devs are selling early alphas that never get finished or sell games in pieces with DLC bullshit. gaming industry is shit. had 3 games on windows partition. arma 3, red orchestra 2 and swat4. thats it

2016-10-18 07:06:23	BL4DE	NextHendrix: hehe played arma for nearly 16 years since operation flashpoint: cold war crisis

2016-10-18 07:06:40	BL4DE	which is now renamed cold war assault
2016-10-18 07:06:54	NextHendrix	i had red river on 360
2016-10-18 07:07:15	NextHendrix	i remember first booting it up after about 3 hours on cod4, and I was like what in the fuck is this shit
2016-10-18 07:07:21	BL4DE	NextHendrix: basically codemasters released dragon rising and red river. nothing to do with arma
2016-10-18 07:07:34	NextHendrix	ive got a ton of hours on arm II though
2016-10-18 07:07:39	NextHendrix	muh dayz
2016-10-18 07:07:50	NextHendrix	never played the campaigns

2016-10-18 07:08:14	NextHendrix	BL4DE: are they worth doing?
2016-10-18 07:08:18	BL4DE	NextHendrix: cause of legal issues bohemia had to rename the first operation flashpoint cause they had rights to engine just not the name. scammy codemasters later released cod clone under a milsim name of operation flashpoint
2016-10-18 07:08:20	NextHendrix	i just like flying the helicoptters
2016-10-18 07:09:50	BL4DE	NextHendrix: Id recommend arma3. it has dayz like mods which are more complete than actual dayz standalone
2016-10-18 07:10:12	NextHendrix	never played the standalone
2016-10-18 07:10:19	Kirito	I was severely addicted to BF2: Modern Combat on the PS2 and Xbox 360 when it was re-released, hah
2016-10-18 07:10:19	NextHendrix	last time i checked it was totally broken

2016-10-18 07:12:03	BL4DE	NextHendrix: well arma 3 definately improved over arma 2 in many ways. not as clunky, has basic physics, underwater, many engine improvements too much shit to name. but regardless real virtuality engine is always broken no matter how polished the turd is
2016-10-18 07:13:42	NextHendrix	clunky is definitely the word for arma II
2016-10-18 07:13:58	BL4DE	NextHendrix: if you dont mind playing ancient arma cold war assault. it has a good "Resistance" campaign. arma 2 campaigns were meh. harvest red had missions were you had to find and arrest a single guy "war criminal" in 250 square KM map
2016-10-18 07:14:37	NextHendrix	the barracks mode on arma II was awesome, especially with all the expansions
2016-10-18 07:14:41	BL4DE	NextHendrix: but it did have it's moments during campaing. also eagle wing is a nice short campaign.
2016-10-18 07:14:50	NextHendrix	many a weekend wasted stoned doing chicken missions and whatnot
2016-10-18 07:15:02	BL4DE	NextHendrix: you mean armory :D
2016-10-18 07:15:10	NextHendrix	yeah, that shit was decent

2016-10-18 23:59:27	bokchoi	Ugh, I want to build my system as an X99 one because futureproof, but even choosing the 5820K as my CPU doesn't end up much cheaper than A 6800K ._.

2016-10-19 05:27:46	Chais	a read/write test on the host achieved good results

2016-10-19 11:15:35	Paddy_NI	I fix computers for a living and encounter very few
2016-10-19 11:15:39	GaivsIvlivs	1080p has been out quite a few years, in electronics relative years
2016-10-19 11:15:58	kbdkode	my high res small screen laptop is 1920x1080. The screen size really isn't that big
2016-10-19 11:16:03	Paddy_NI	1366x768 still has the majority on laptops I would say

2016-10-20 14:39:02	mpan	1) wrong arg type (should be size_t). 2) unsafe calling style (returning resource instead of passing it by ref). 3) `ptr` is of type `int*` instead of `void*`. While this is still syntactically valid, this explicitly opens possibility of invalid access. 4) `exit(whatever)` instead of `abort`. 5) crashing the application because mere allocation has failed¹. | ¹ Note: under Linux this test is 
2016-10-20 14:39:08	mpan	also always false, as memory allocation can’t fail under Linux kernel.

But any program that would succeed would be immiedietly killed by OOM killer anyway. 2) I recall there was some strange situation related to `malloc` being interrupted. Dunno if it’s still happening.

2016-10-21 04:07:53	Reventlov	How can such a request be accepted ?
2016-10-21 04:08:02	voidead	jelle› honestly I think this is an issue with xterm since that happens with a few other xterm terminals as well
2016-10-21 04:08:18	voidead	but ST isn't xterm
2016-10-21 04:08:23	voidead	so I guess thats why it doesn't do that

2016-10-21 04:08:54	jelle	what?

2016-10-21 04:09:12	jelle	it's boat :D

2016-10-21 04:09:50	jelle	lolwut
2016-10-21 04:10:13	Reventlov	yesterday, one of my package was deleted without a warning (ok, it was on aur-requests) cause the source was 404'ing.
2016-10-21 04:10:21	voidead	just Ctrl+l of course refreshes it and fixes the issue.. but I have to Ctrl+l all the time since multiple windows (buffers in weechat) will have random emojis like that which fuck up the text alignment
2016-10-21 04:10:26	Reventlov	not a single comment on the package page, not a single message to me.

2016-10-21 04:54:11	deltasquared	I swear, when I tested it I was hexdump'ing the dev node (I forget if it was keyboard or mouse), after suspend it error'd with "no such device"

2016-10-21 05:26:23	MrElendig	if something have 100% bogus traffic but only accounts for 0.2% of your total traffic it would still make sense to block it
2016-10-21 05:26:53	vidje	anyway, what's new in archlinux
2016-10-21 05:27:07	vidje	i'm planning to buy another ssd for linux boot so i can arch again

2016-10-21 05:27:21	mpan	MrElendig: then block whole Russia by default on any servers you run. Actually whole central-east Europe would be even better ;).
2016-10-21 05:27:23	vidje	yarrrrch
2016-10-21 05:27:35	vidje	mpan, why? 
2016-10-21 05:27:46	MrElendig	the % is much lower from there
2016-10-21 05:27:52	vidje	there's below 10% of malicious traffic coming from those countries
2016-10-21 05:27:57	vidje	while there's above 90% coming from tor
2016-10-21 05:28:01	vidje	:D

2016-10-21 05:28:55	vidje	don't see the logic in that
2016-10-21 05:29:01	vidje	i never supported tor and never will

2016-10-21 05:29:20	Sapphirus	Not my fault you choose to browse through tor
2016-10-21 05:29:21	vidje	people who have privacy issues and resort to tor should seek a psychiatrist or stop doing illegal shit
2016-10-21 05:29:47	MrElendig	there are some valid usage of tor but sadly it is the minority

2016-10-21 05:29:53	mpan	Sapphirus: please read. I’m not browsing through tor. kthx
2016-10-21 05:30:01	deltasquared	haha, best advice I'v read in a paper thus far: "Having someone to share your frustrations with can also be achieved without pair programming.  You usually get frustrated when you are due for a break. In this situation you should relax, take your mind off the project and do something that will help you unwind. For example, going for a walk, have a quick snack, make a cup of tea or play a game; we would personally recommend 
2016-10-21 05:30:01	deltasquared	“GTA Vice City” as you can vent your anger and frustrations on innocent bystanders."
2016-10-21 05:30:02	vidje	Sapphirus, it's not like government can't track you through it either
2016-10-21 05:30:07	Sapphirus	mpan: Then you wouldn't have been 403'd by my web server.
2016-10-21 05:30:20	Sapphirus	Every single ip in that blacklist is a tor exit-node.
2016-10-21 05:30:32	Sapphirus	And I could verify it with my logs
2016-10-21 05:30:34	vidje	there's a whole lot different & better ways to stay 'safe' on line than to use tor :D
2016-10-21 05:30:35	mpan	Sapphirus: I wouldn’t if you could at least understand a bit what you’re doing… but hey, cargo cult administrating is so fun!

2016-10-21 05:51:31	mpan	vidje: then let me surprise you, it’s true. And, by the way, about the doctors: in PL they’re legally allowed to refuse help to people based on ideological beliefs.
2016-10-21 05:51:39	vidje	that's the kind of argument you're providing basically
2016-10-21 05:51:43	voidead	its not about whether someone is using TOR or not.. its about knowing how to secure your machine (or machines) properly using the right  steps needed for your purposes etc..
2016-10-21 05:52:03	deltasquared	voidead: if he gets pwned, his fault
2016-10-21 05:52:05	deltasquared	leave him to it
2016-10-21 05:52:14	Sapphirus	vidje, if it was a publicly usable service, I would only block tor users from uploading shit.
2016-10-21 05:52:19	voidead	if you are poking around in shit infested places on the internet.. you are asking for trouble.. unless you know how to secure your shit beforehand
2016-10-21 05:52:23	vidje	mpan, whole world should just convert to catholicism anyway.
2016-10-21 05:52:30	deltasquared	!debate
2016-10-21 05:52:32	vidje	so doctors would accept everyone

2016-10-21 05:52:41	vidje	:D
2016-10-21 05:52:41	Sapphirus	But that would also be assuming, I have the infrastructure in place to deal with rouge traffic at a decent scale
2016-10-21 05:52:45	mpan	vidje: actually it’s about catholic views… :D
2016-10-21 05:52:58	vidje	mpan, roman catholicism is the only true faith. rest is mickey mouse bullshit
2016-10-21 05:53:05	deltasquared	Sapphirus: let cloudflare handle it for you
2016-10-21 05:53:05	vidje	:D
2016-10-21 05:53:19	mpan	deltasquared: not the best advice, as cloudflare blocks tor for no reason too ;)
2016-10-21 05:53:20	Sapphirus	deltasquared, cloudflare will only go so far unless you're paying them thousands per month.
2016-10-21 05:53:31	deltasquared	Sapphirus: eh, just $RANDIDEA
2016-10-21 05:53:51	deltasquared	disclaimer: I don't count any of my advice as sound
2016-10-21 05:53:59	Sapphirus	Plus, this site right now, is intended as a personal image hosting service.
2016-10-21 05:54:21	Sapphirus	So, it isn't like I'm a 'business' or anything, like mpam's analogy would make you believe.
2016-10-21 05:54:28	Sapphirus	mpan's*
2016-10-21 05:54:42	vidje	can't believe whole argument started over something as worthless as tor
2016-10-21 05:54:48	voidead	TOR is used for legal purposes all the time.. TOR isn't just for scumbags.. its also for people who simply want a secure connection without some asshole corporation(s) snooping in on everything you do or say
2016-10-21 05:54:50	mpan	vidje: ok, this turns into a talk that is not serious enough :P
2016-10-21 05:54:50	Sapphirus	vidje, me neither.
2016-10-21 05:55:13	vidje	voidead, point is that such people are vast minority of tor users
2016-10-21 05:55:15	mpan	voidead: actually this would not be my argument. I run it exclusively because it can be used for illegal purposes ;).
2016-10-21 05:55:17	deltasquared	can we all just call it a day and bash M$ instead? that'd be fun
2016-10-21 05:55:27	Sapphirus	voidead, Out of how many people which use the service for illegitimate purposes?
2016-10-21 05:55:33	mpan	deltasquared: don’t we bash Microsoft® every day?

2016-10-21 05:56:39	mpan	The problem is not really tor. It’s about doing pointless things that harm others under a belief that this helps in some way. Or under pure lazyness.
2016-10-21 05:56:42	deltasquared	voidead: yep, let us all be clueless and provide amusement to onlookers :P
2016-10-21 05:56:47	voidead	just throw around "TOR exit node" like you know what it means
2016-10-21 05:56:56	Sapphirus	mpan: and if people are sending rouge dns requests via your node, and so are you; if you *ever* got caught, you could just say: "Not me, I'm the operator of a tor exit-node."
2016-10-21 05:57:13	mpan	Sapphirus: sure. Do you run a DNS service on this server? :>
2016-10-21 05:57:31	Sapphirus	and since you do run a tor exit-node, the liability would be diverted to the anons using your node.

These then become prey for fish. Phytoplankton also suck carbon dioxide out of the air, helping to limit global warming.

2016-10-22 00:13:45	minimalism	Americans are crazy and can't be trusted with them.
2016-10-22 00:13:52	vrmxm	We need to entice people off the road
2016-10-22 00:14:05	polyzen	and into the Church
2016-10-22 00:14:22	vrmxm	*Viable* public transportation, ride sharing, maybe even some sort of tax rewards for zero-car families
2016-10-22 00:14:41	minimalism	And those damn job things. Leading cause of house abandonment. I'm just conveniently leaving out the fact that it's only for on average 8 hours.
2016-10-22 00:15:05	MrElendig	the accident statistics of the US do show that something is seriously wrong
2016-10-22 00:15:11	MrElendig	when it comes to cars
2016-10-22 00:16:29	vrmxm	Americans seem to have (among others) the issue of "I'm above that statistic" or "I can do what I want" etc

2016-10-22 00:16:49	mkoskar	minimalism: and also a lot of sarcasm might kill you
2016-10-22 00:16:54	MrElendig	vrmxm: also you are allowed to drive a car without having had any schooling done by a proffessional teacher
2016-10-22 00:16:56	vrmxm	Gun safety? Pff. That's for liberal fargits.
2016-10-22 00:17:21	MrElendig	and a driving test not much harder than the old indian one :p
2016-10-22 00:17:45	vrmxm	Pyro-what license? Commie scum, I blow things up on the 4th of July and you should too!
2016-10-22 00:18:37	MrElendig	vrmxm: btw: you are more likely to die from fireworks than terrorists :p
2016-10-22 00:18:44	vrmxm	I believe it
2016-10-22 00:18:50	MrElendig	but somehow terrorists warrants turning the country into a police state
2016-10-22 00:19:06	vrmxm	I've seen what these crazy Appalachian mofos do on/around the 4th
2016-10-22 00:19:16	MrElendig	vrmxm: an order of magnitude more likely even to die from fireworks
2016-10-22 00:19:53	vrmxm	I think in my case I'm most likely to die from caffeine overdose, but eh
2016-10-22 00:20:02	MrElendig	1:700000 vs 1:8000000
2016-10-22 00:20:07	MrElendig	or something in that ballpark
2016-10-22 00:21:14	vrmxm	Those are some retarded odds, if they're right
2016-10-22 00:21:27	vrmxm	All those preppers would have better luck with the lottery
2016-10-22 00:21:30	minimalism	systemd has a 1:4 chance of pissing someone off.
2016-10-22 00:21:52	MrElendig	vrmxm: and lottery is "tax on stupid" :D
2016-10-22 00:22:19	vrmxm	No, lottery is a tax on people who never took statistics
2016-10-22 00:26:57	MrElendig	http://www.businessinsider.com/fox-news-lottery-tickets-2016-1?r=US&IR=T&IR=T
2016-10-22 00:26:59	voidead	minimalism: especially if they are incapable of understanding how it works.. much less the pid1 bullshit (apologies pid1)

2016-10-22 14:22:18	bokchoi	It's been done before

2016-10-22 14:23:42	KKKrx	and you can have different setups, for example
2016-10-22 14:23:48	KKKrx	colect all roots of unity!

2016-10-22 14:25:30	KKKrx	I was thinking reaper because reap = to collect and you're trying to reap as many cards as possible
2016-10-22 14:25:55	bokchoi	probably in your head
2016-10-22 14:26:29	polyzen	wow didn't expect the new mpv to be so different

2016-10-22 23:33:03	Lehvyn	I buy in bulk if buying said product doesn't go bad quickly
2016-10-22 23:33:11	bokchoi	Yeah, it makes sense
2016-10-22 23:33:18	bokchoi	Assuming you have the room for it
2016-10-22 23:33:27	Lehvyn	I also pay bills in advance if I know it's not going to change
2016-10-22 23:33:37	bokchoi	The Smart Thing To Do™
2016-10-22 23:33:42	Lehvyn	rent/mortgage/insurance/etc, years worth at the beginning of the year
2016-10-22 23:34:09	bokchoi	A lot of companies offer not a late penalty, but an early payment "discount"
2016-10-22 23:34:16	bokchoi	Here, that is
2016-10-22 23:34:40	bokchoi	So they basically up their prices by an amount equivalent to a late penalty, and treat the removal of said fee like a discount
2016-10-22 23:35:38	bokchoi	It's all about mindset, and I find myself, without regret, falling for it
2016-10-22 23:36:13	bokchoi	I coudln't afford  to pay rent in one yearly sum
2016-10-22 23:36:18	Lehvyn	all the bills I pay in advance are the same if I paid by month
2016-10-22 23:36:28	Lehvyn	no fees, no discounts, etc
2016-10-22 23:36:38	bokchoi	Oh nice
2016-10-22 23:36:45	bokchoi	Gets it out of the way I guess
2016-10-22 23:36:57	bokchoi	I do pay insurance etc yearly though
2016-10-22 23:37:12	bokchoi	Since I only have to insure my car and that's pretty much it
2016-10-22 23:37:39	Lehvyn	Yup. Don't have to wonder if you have enough money for rent in april, or if your cable/phone will be cut off in october, or if your insurance/car payment/etc will be due in august - it's all paid for

2016-10-22 23:40:16	bokchoi	ha
2016-10-22 23:40:18	Lehvyn	not rich, but not poor. lol
2016-10-22 23:40:56	mk-fg	If I had money to throw away like that and don't care, would be easy to always pay in advance
2016-10-22 23:41:33	bokchoi	paying monthly is better assuming inflation continues and the bill stays the same ;)
2016-10-22 23:42:06	bokchoi	Might save 0.002% or something, who knows!
2016-10-22 23:42:11	mk-fg	Worst-case it keeps money around in case of other unforseen expenses
2016-10-22 23:42:28	mk-fg	Instead of being locked-up for the future payments
2016-10-22 23:42:35	Lehvyn	not that I don't care.. it's just that for some reason I thought bill was closer to $300 for some reason. I round up to the closest $10.
2016-10-22 23:44:17	bokchoi	It'll mean you wont pay for a while \o/

2016-10-23 07:36:43	sudokode	"According to Andrew Niccol, the filmmakers worked with actual gunrunners in the making of the film. The tanks lined up for sale were real and belonged to a Czech arms dealer who had to have them back to sell to another country. They used a real stockpile of over 3,000 AK-47s because it was cheaper than getting prop guns."

2016-10-23 08:49:33	tigrmesh	i've done the same, btw
2016-10-23 08:51:05	tigrmesh	there's probably a more elegant way, but useful would be to vimdiff the default tmux config and your current config and compare the two
2016-10-23 08:51:12	tigrmesh	*current tmux
2016-10-23 08:52:30	Paddy_NI	tigrmesh, In retrospect that would have been a wonderful idea

2016-10-23 09:28:00	mpan	I was initially thinking that this may be some sort of mahjong tiles. The original source describes this as “tiles for a game”, the period agrees, the number of tiles is only slighly off and many characters appearing on the tiles agree with these used in mahjong.

But the way things are described and displayed is a tragedy :(. A great opportunity for make a good educational exhibition has been missed.

2016-10-23 15:50:09	du5tball	by the way, does anyone know if there are med resistance tests?
2016-10-23 15:51:36	minimalism	well, I could throw a bottle of Tylenol at your head and see how you fare
2016-10-23 15:52:16	du5tball	tylenol actually still does something
2016-10-23 15:52:24	du5tball	i seem to develop resistances to meds left and right
2016-10-23 15:52:40	du5tball	benzodiazepines lost their effectiveness, as did zolpidem for example
2016-10-23 15:52:48	du5tball	can eat both like smarties
2016-10-23 15:52:50	minimalism	that's why I don't take anything
2016-10-23 15:53:31	du5tball	i took both only twice or thrice
2016-10-23 15:54:10	minimalism	I'm supposed to be on some anti-ocd meds which are really just anti-deps .. which they don't even understand how or why they "help" ocd
2016-10-23 15:54:22	minimalism	and even they'll admit  without saying it directly that an immunity will be built
2016-10-23 15:54:28	minimalism	it's like chasing the dragon
2016-10-23 15:56:32	du5tball	true but it usually takes a while
2016-10-23 15:58:20	du5tball	and i mean years
2016-10-23 15:58:20		[15:58]
2016-10-23 15:58:40	minimalism	well it'll be too late by the time "Crawling In My Skin" starts playing in your head
2016-10-23 15:58:47	minimalism	and you still have many years of life after that
2016-10-23 15:58:54	du5tball	you'll just get new meds then
2016-10-23 15:59:09	minimalism	then the eventual suicide because nothing will work anymore, and you're more upset than ever

2016-10-24 01:53:44	mkoskar	what I don't get is that in osc.lua they use some completely separate OSD drawing, which is then rendered on top of regular OSD like when you change volume and so, I don't use OSC, but did nice simple playlist UI yesterday and took some code from it

2016-10-24 01:57:39	@demize	Ark is not a proper pronunciation, and is another Linux distro.
2016-10-24 01:57:40	mkoskar	demize: I was thinking about that yes, although I like that I can ctrl+` to get older notifications, but in the process I would probably want to migrate to smt. different than xmobar, but all that would take much time I guess

2016-10-24 02:01:41	mkoskar	demize: no I mean I like dunst functionality, actions on entries although I don't use them often, ... I've thought you mean I shouldn't use dunst but some other notification daemon integrated with bar? ... xmobar has CommandReader so doing a simple notification daemon shouldn't be that hard

2016-10-24 04:01:57	mpan	An empty set is half of a smiley (mpan’s conjecture, 2016).
2016-10-24 04:02:42	@demize	Technically it's either ⅓ or ⅔
2016-10-24 04:05:51	mpan	Not really, as “⊆” can’t be considered equally important as “∅”. Also I see no ordering that would put “∅” behind or before “⊆”, so it’s an open question and a new entry in the great unsolved questions of the mathematics.
2016-10-24 04:11:00		[04:05]
2016-10-24 04:11:06	mpan	Oh, I found the answer. In Unicode “∅” has a codepoint 2205, “⊆” has 2282. So the latter is ~3.5% more. Hence the empty set is ~ 32.(9497907)% of the smiley (revised mpan’s conjecture).

2016-10-24 04:12:40	@demize	Never been that interested in it, honestly.
2016-10-24 04:13:21	mpan	Approximately 3295/10000, and 3295 is a divisor of 12²⁸-1.
2016-10-24 04:14:34	mpan	mar77i: because mere existence of nothing in everything doesn’t imply that other things, including anything, don’t exist. Something may exist in everything, and that something may be anything.
2016-10-24 04:15:15	dunz0r	ekkelett: I might wait for the dollar to drop a little bit before I jump on it... it's quite a lot of money for something I don't really need :)

2016-10-24 18:10:14	klekowskii	same stuff, with scholarships and country agreements 
2016-10-24 18:10:37	dmc	wonder what a feed of my FB statuses would look like
2016-10-24 18:10:59	klekowskii	there is a movie called "L'auberge espagnole", that is about erasmus 
2016-10-24 18:11:34	minimalism	dmc: Quite similar to the data files your corporate overlords have on you, I would assume.
2016-10-24 18:11:54	mpan	dmc: they would start with: “-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----”? ;)
2016-10-24 18:12:32	viscera	evolution is so... ugly
2016-10-24 18:12:51	klekowskii	how is ugly viscera ?
2016-10-24 18:13:06	mpan	viscera: it’s not ugly. It just happens. It’s neither ugly or beautiful, nor it has any purpose or goal. It’s just a phenomenon in the nature >_>
2016-10-24 18:14:32	dmc	you guys remember the day when the FB feed was a real feed
2016-10-24 18:14:34	mpan	Also how can you call “ugly” seeing that some eyes (human for example) are inside-out? It has some unintended humor, this is beautiful!
2016-10-24 18:14:39	klekowskii	I agree with mpan , also, it happens even if you don't know how it is called ,IMHO is inherent to being alive 
2016-10-24 18:15:00	dmc	feel so lost with it now
2016-10-24 18:15:24	dmc	mpan, do you only know people that are familiar with PGP?
2016-10-24 18:15:45	viscera	i mean the mail client :)

2016-10-24 18:17:07	mpan	dmc: on FB? No. I don’t have a personal FB account, hence I don’t keep connections with any face bookers [;)] — be it PGP users or not.

2016-10-24 18:21:17	TPA	LPT: dont text ur crush cause once u find out how wonderful she is its hard to stop thinking about it
2016-10-24 18:21:28	javaisnom	TIL hence is socially unacceptable ot say?
2016-10-24 18:21:39	TPA	:P
2016-10-24 18:21:58	TPA	has anyone tried FB PGP?
2016-10-24 18:21:59	javaisnom	I read that as "once you find out how wonderful she is hard"
2016-10-24 18:22:02	TPA	It seems pointless to me..
2016-10-24 18:22:17	TPA	?

2016-10-24 18:22:32	TPA	that was unncessary and turned the topic disgusting
2016-10-24 18:22:44	javaisnom	yw
2016-10-24 18:22:45	mpan	TPA: dunno, search it on facebook. You may also search for base64-encoded posts, which would indicate encryption ;
2016-10-24 18:22:46	TPA	now im grossed out :(
2016-10-24 18:22:48	chowbok	I do it just because none of my friends are technical enough to send me PGP messages
2016-10-24 18:23:02	javaisnom	that's what I'm here foor~
2016-10-24 18:23:02	chowbok	So if Facebook didn't do it, nobody would

2016-10-24 18:23:14	TPA	its stupid
2016-10-24 18:23:23	TPA	wait
2016-10-24 18:23:23	chowbok	And what's the point of having a PGP key if nobody uses it?
2016-10-24 18:23:30	mpan	chowbok: we may become friends just to send PGP-signed facebook messages!
2016-10-24 18:23:31	TPA	is the FB pgp MITM or PTP?
2016-10-24 18:23:44	TPA	o wait
2016-10-24 18:23:45	chowbok	Uh
2016-10-24 18:23:47	TPA	nvm
2016-10-24 18:23:50	TPA	bad question
2016-10-24 18:24:02	TPA	whats the point of PGP signing my fb messages
2016-10-24 18:24:14	TPA	i mean its not like some hacker is gonna steal my fb
2016-10-24 18:24:20	minimalism	to stop fb from reading them
2016-10-24 18:24:26	TPA	what?
2016-10-24 18:24:33	mpan	minimalism: signing doesn’t prevent reading. Wake up, wake up…
2016-10-24 18:24:34	TPA	fb messaging supports peer to peer encryption?
2016-10-24 18:24:36	chowbok	It's not signing
2016-10-24 18:24:49	 *	mpan drops a bucket of cold water on minimalism’s head
2016-10-24 18:24:50	chowbok	It's encrypting the messages it e-mails to me.
2016-10-24 18:24:52	TPA	I thought it was just pgp signingn to verify who wrote it?
2016-10-24 18:25:05	chowbok	Well, I guess it signs them too, but that's not really the point
2016-10-24 18:25:08	TPA	chowbok: so you have to manually curl/decrypt?
2016-10-24 18:25:24	chowbok	Well, I would if I didn't use Enigmail
2016-10-24 18:25:34	TPA	Enigmail?
2016-10-24 18:25:37	TPA	I just use protonmail...
2016-10-24 18:25:50	chowbok	I dunno what that is
2016-10-24 18:25:59	chowbok	Enigmail is a Thunderbird plugin
2016-10-24 18:26:01	TPA	its a mail service
2016-10-24 18:26:06	TPA	protonmail
