2016-10-17 15:18:40	nshp	and the firmware is up to the vendor I think
2016-10-17 15:19:21	nshp	they have large bootloaders/firmware similar to UEFI, sort of
2016-10-17 15:19:34	nshp	usually u-boot or something similar
2016-10-17 15:19:50	blueblur112198	and said bootloader/firmware happens to really really suck on most android phones?

2016-10-17 15:20:35	nshp	they're usually locked down by the carrier if you get them on contract
2016-10-17 15:20:48	nshp	or in the case of samsung, they're just fuck you bootloaders

2016-10-17 15:21:19	nshp	but samsung's chromebooks running arch can be pretty sweet

2016-10-17 15:24:11	blueblur112198	you mean it takes a partition from an external drive and moves it to an internal drive?

2016-10-17 15:24:42	alyptik	yeah it can either be /storage/emulated/0 or /data

2016-10-18 00:14:23	mar77i	[10:09:20] the only thing you'll ever need to write in assembly is a c compiler. [10:09:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	NextHendrix	[10:09:39] or an assembler [10:09:39]

2016-10-18 00:14:23	mar77i	[10:11:10] oh those exist already, as unused compiler flag on a compiler you haven't heard of [10:11:10]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	mar77i	[10:11:32] (which also breaks your code because you depend on your compiler's specific UB) [10:11:32]

2016-10-18 03:17:06	Kirito	until I sat in front of a 120hz TV. Though those work by artificially increasing framerates
2016-10-18 03:17:15	Kirito	in high action scenes
2016-10-18 03:17:26	Kirito	because nothing is recorded in 120fps
2016-10-18 03:18:44	Namarrgon	the only display that provide more than 60Hz are usually those that support gsync or freesync
2016-10-18 03:18:50	Kirito	though actually I'm not sure to what extent this TV does do that, because TV is never 60fps either
2016-10-18 03:19:09	@demize	Well, some things are recorded at high frame rates, but generally because you're recording things for slo-mo. :p

2016-10-18 03:20:22	@demize	In practice, no movie and such is recorded in higher than 48Hz.

2016-10-18 03:20:35	@demize	And The Hobbit was the first to be recorded in 48Hz.

2016-10-18 03:24:02	Kirito	You could add a lot more computational power into the process by pre-encoding instead of doing it on the fly
2016-10-18 03:24:10	Kirito	so theoretically the quality could be better

2016-10-18 04:43:49	Kirito	lol, can't you just check Chromium out without history though?
2016-10-18 04:44:01	alyptik	hm?
2016-10-18 04:44:04	Kirito	It took me a while to realize that too
2016-10-18 04:44:08	alyptik	what do you mean check out

2016-10-18 04:47:28	BL4DE	well I installed windows 7 and used the DazLoader but now it wont boot. thing is grub suggest using that command but Im afraid ALL might destroy arch / partition but idk?
2016-10-18 04:48:05	alyptik	from a complete guess
2016-10-18 04:48:22	alyptik	it fixes a bootsector (idk what nt60 is) --force

2016-10-18 06:43:47	BL4DE	mpan: I mean the worst DRM is always connected. local DRMs like steams drm for singleplayer games never stopped warez groups. but in any case pirated games are usually unplayable online unless theres a LAN mode with which you can use Hamachi, Tunggle and whatnot to simulate LAN on actual internet connection
2016-10-18 06:44:44	mk-fg	But people want online multiplayer

2016-10-18 06:48:17	mpan	BL4DE: I don’t say that DRM itself is what halts cracking Denuvo-restricted games. But I doubt that mere obfuscation or complex tricks (this is what typical anticrack soft uses) alone would work. In combination with DRM techs, they can.
2016-10-18 06:48:18	BL4DE	tomb raider, doom have been cracked
2016-10-18 06:48:37	NextHendrix	wont be long before games require a usb licenser

2016-10-18 06:49:12	NextHendrix	they do it for all the music production stuff
2016-10-18 06:49:18	BL4DE	sangy: but just cause 3 hasnt been cracked yet. it sucks anyway. also metal gear solid uses some sort of bypass
2016-10-18 06:49:32	mk-fg	Yeah, CAD stuff usually also comes with smartcards
2016-10-18 06:49:35	NextHendrix	if you're planning on doing music prod legally, you better hope you've got 5+ usb ports for all the damn usb licensers

2016-10-18 06:53:41	NextHendrix	or even stream
2016-10-18 06:53:51	Kirito	streaming games over the net has existed for years now

2016-10-18 06:55:30	BL4DE	I guess problem with Denuvo it will take significantly longer than before. Less games will be cracked. Remember the days when games used to get cracked before launching on steam. tho guess it's fair for game companies to have headstart for couple of months to not get hit
2016-10-18 06:56:06	mar77i	hmm, don't they get the experience and reactiveness up by saving bandwidth using at least a bit compression?
2016-10-18 06:56:50	NextHendrix	that drm on arma 2 was pretty annoying
2016-10-18 06:57:00	NextHendrix	FADE i think it was called

2016-10-18 06:57:36	NextHendrix	hows steam in home streaming doing these days
2016-10-18 06:57:50	NextHendrix	haven't tried it in ages, has it improved since release?
2016-10-18 06:57:58	Kirito	Steam link is a bit flaky and annoying to set up, but it seems to work well otherwise

2016-10-18 06:59:02	sangy	mpan: fully homomorphic encryption will make drm really interesting, but we'll have to wait a little for that
2016-10-18 06:59:22	NextHendrix	BL4DE: ive never tried 3
2016-10-18 06:59:45	Kirito	I haven't pirated video games since I was a minor.
2016-10-18 06:59:46	NextHendrix	no GPU in my desktop at the minute, heavily abused 7870XT died a while back
2016-10-18 06:59:59	NextHendrix	had no fan at all for about 2 years
2016-10-18 07:00:09	Kirito	because I got a job and started paying for games
2016-10-18 07:00:36	BL4DE	NextHendrix: virtual programming made eon linux and mac ports of arma 3 but unfortunately its always lagging 1-2 releases behind windows. probably when they stop developing arma 3. linux client will be compatible with windows playerbase
2016-10-18 07:00:41	Kirito	especially today with Steam Sales, Humble Bundle's and so on
2016-10-18 07:01:12	NextHendrix	i barely play games at all these days
2016-10-18 07:01:34	NextHendrix	played some TIS-100 the other day
2016-10-18 07:01:38	Kirito	neither do I honestly
2016-10-18 07:01:39	NextHendrix	not sure if that even really counts
2016-10-18 07:01:55	NextHendrix	felt more productive than what i stopped doing to play it
2016-10-18 07:01:58	Kirito	I've got probably 100 games on Steam I got during summer sales and such I still haven't played, haha

2016-10-18 07:04:39	BL4DE	but yeah I also lost interest in gaming. especially AAA games where devs are selling early alphas that never get finished or sell games in pieces with DLC bullshit. gaming industry is shit. had 3 games on windows partition. arma 3, red orchestra 2 and swat4. thats it

2016-10-18 07:06:23	BL4DE	NextHendrix: hehe played arma for nearly 16 years since operation flashpoint: cold war crisis

2016-10-18 07:06:40	BL4DE	which is now renamed cold war assault
2016-10-18 07:06:54	NextHendrix	i had red river on 360
2016-10-18 07:07:15	NextHendrix	i remember first booting it up after about 3 hours on cod4, and I was like what in the fuck is this shit
2016-10-18 07:07:21	BL4DE	NextHendrix: basically codemasters released dragon rising and red river. nothing to do with arma
2016-10-18 07:07:34	NextHendrix	ive got a ton of hours on arm II though
2016-10-18 07:07:39	NextHendrix	muh dayz
2016-10-18 07:07:50	NextHendrix	never played the campaigns

2016-10-18 07:08:14	NextHendrix	BL4DE: are they worth doing?
2016-10-18 07:08:18	BL4DE	NextHendrix: cause of legal issues bohemia had to rename the first operation flashpoint cause they had rights to engine just not the name. scammy codemasters later released cod clone under a milsim name of operation flashpoint
2016-10-18 07:08:20	NextHendrix	i just like flying the helicoptters
2016-10-18 07:09:50	BL4DE	NextHendrix: Id recommend arma3. it has dayz like mods which are more complete than actual dayz standalone
2016-10-18 07:10:12	NextHendrix	never played the standalone
2016-10-18 07:10:19	Kirito	I was severely addicted to BF2: Modern Combat on the PS2 and Xbox 360 when it was re-released, hah
2016-10-18 07:10:19	NextHendrix	last time i checked it was totally broken

2016-10-18 07:12:03	BL4DE	NextHendrix: well arma 3 definately improved over arma 2 in many ways. not as clunky, has basic physics, underwater, many engine improvements too much shit to name. but regardless real virtuality engine is always broken no matter how polished the turd is
2016-10-18 07:13:42	NextHendrix	clunky is definitely the word for arma II
2016-10-18 07:13:58	BL4DE	NextHendrix: if you dont mind playing ancient arma cold war assault. it has a good "Resistance" campaign. arma 2 campaigns were meh. harvest red had missions were you had to find and arrest a single guy "war criminal" in 250 square KM map
2016-10-18 07:14:37	NextHendrix	the barracks mode on arma II was awesome, especially with all the expansions
2016-10-18 07:14:41	BL4DE	NextHendrix: but it did have it's moments during campaing. also eagle wing is a nice short campaign.
2016-10-18 07:14:50	NextHendrix	many a weekend wasted stoned doing chicken missions and whatnot
2016-10-18 07:15:02	BL4DE	NextHendrix: you mean armory :D
2016-10-18 07:15:10	NextHendrix	yeah, that shit was decent
