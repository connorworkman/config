2016-10-17 15:18:40	nshp	and the firmware is up to the vendor I think
2016-10-17 15:19:21	nshp	they have large bootloaders/firmware similar to UEFI, sort of
2016-10-17 15:19:34	nshp	usually u-boot or something similar
2016-10-17 15:19:50	blueblur112198	and said bootloader/firmware happens to really really suck on most android phones?

2016-10-17 15:20:31	blueblur112198	idk why it can't just be simple
2016-10-17 15:20:35	nshp	they're usually locked down by the carrier if you get them on contract
2016-10-17 15:20:48	nshp	or in the case of samsung, they're just fuck you bootloaders

2016-10-17 15:21:19	nshp	but samsung's chromebooks running arch can be pretty sweet

2016-10-17 15:24:11	blueblur112198	you mean it takes a partition from an external drive and moves it to an internal drive?

2016-10-17 15:24:42	alyptik	yeah it can either be /storage/emulated/0 or /data
