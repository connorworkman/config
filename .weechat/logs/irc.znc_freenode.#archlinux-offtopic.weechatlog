2016-10-17 12:36:04	mnrmnaugh	wots ccache even so far as... just use a massive swap? :D
2016-10-17 12:36:12	bokchoi	But more like 'so' rather than 'my'
2016-10-17 12:36:21	alyptik	mnrmnaugh› it caches compiling results
2016-10-17 12:36:32	bokchoi	ccache will store between compiles
2016-10-17 12:36:34	alyptik	so if there is a lot of objects you have already compiled such as with a kernel;
2016-10-17 12:36:41	Boohbah	alyptik: Nice.
2016-10-17 12:36:56	alyptik	bokchoi› oh ok gotcha; suh kids these days

2016-10-17 12:38:29	Boohbah	alyptik: It's like you find a working version and a non-working one and try a version halfway in between each until you narrow it down.
2016-10-17 12:38:37	alyptik	at least we are not alone in 4.9 breaking
2016-10-17 12:38:45	alyptik	oh so like a debug branch

2016-10-17 12:39:12	Boohbah	No. You just try versions and mark them working or non-working until you find the one commit that introduced the bug.
2016-10-17 12:39:28	mnrmnaugh	grumble. time to go. goodbye alyptik, Boohbah, dmc, and other freinds <3

2016-10-17 12:40:33	alyptik	seems like maybe it has something to do with new PREEMPT code from these mailing list archives
2016-10-17 12:40:43	Boohbah	alyptik: I'm trying to checkout before that commit but makepkg is making a non-working pkgver.
2016-10-17 12:41:17	alyptik	non working?

2016-10-17 12:42:48	Boohbah	And this commit that was bisected is about exporting symbols.
