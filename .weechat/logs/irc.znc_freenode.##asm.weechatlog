2016-10-17 20:37:49	Freze	The only problem is I'm working on implementing elementary math functions, so I can't sterilize the input

2016-10-17 20:39:01	Freze	the second approach being leave them till the end of the code
2016-10-17 20:39:13	vulture	if you're expecting exceptions then you should probably exit as early as possible (performing ops on exception values is often *incredibly* slow)

2016-10-17 21:03:33	Freze	[06:59:40] vulture, for the main computational loop why would it matter ? Branch and exit for the exceptional cases early, and then do the computational loop (which will take advantage of simd). For scalar inputs that is. [06:59:40]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:00:00] simd prefers determinism [07:00:00]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:00:14] you cant branch one 'data' but not another [07:00:14]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:00:30] but you can do masks and conditional moves and such [07:00:30]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:00:46] rather, you dont use control constructs to branch 'data' :P [07:00:46]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:01:48] some platforms (e.g. cuda) provide a bit to enable or disable instruction writeback for individual data parts of a simd operation [07:01:48]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:01:53] many dont [07:01:53]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:02:04] and require you to manually use masks etc [07:02:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:02:33] in both cases, though, code divergence is a big impact on SIMD performance [07:02:33]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	Freze	[07:03:19] For vector inputs, (i.e. sin(x) of  a vector x) I see the advantage of first making sure your input contains no excpetional cases and then plowing through the a branchless version for the computations [07:03:19]

2016-10-17 21:04:15	Freze	For scalar inputs, the branch versions win in terms of speed

2016-10-17 21:04:50	vulture	also, dealing with exceptions is pretty useless in floating point code
2016-10-17 21:04:58	vulture	if you're hitting exceptions, you've already completely failed
2016-10-17 21:05:13	vulture	I understand this is general library code but general libraries are awful too :P~
2016-10-17 21:05:44	Freze	I agree, but people will hang me if I don't deal with them "correctly"
2016-10-17 21:06:00	Freze	It's a pain, esp. subnormals
2016-10-17 21:06:15	zid	x86 has a flag to force subnormals to 0 doesn't it
2016-10-17 21:06:35	zid	it speeds up code that deals with them in exhcange for slowing down the rest slightly or something?
2016-10-17 21:06:47	boru	Probably. CISCs tend to have instructions for making toast.
2016-10-17 21:06:54	zid	mmmm toast

2016-10-17 21:07:23	vulture	Doing floating-point math with the x87 FPU on NaNs or infinities numbers caused a 900 times slowdown on Pentium 4 processors
2016-10-17 21:07:23	vulture	Core 2 processors the worst-case I have measured is a 175 times slowdown, on SSE addition and multiplication
2016-10-17 21:08:23	vulture	which is why, especially if you're doing scalar functions, you should do early exits
2016-10-17 21:08:49	vulture	otoh, you shouldnt have any exception values in the first place or you're a bad person, and it will only be slow if you've already broken it
2016-10-17 21:09:04	Freze	Ok thanks,
2016-10-17 21:10:28	vulture	in any case, the context and implementation details were very important for choosing one or the other :P
2016-10-17 21:10:55	Freze	Right. My conclusions are that for vectors of large size one would need a custom code anyways for max perf.
2016-10-17 21:11:45	Freze	For scalars best to stick with branches and early exits
2016-10-17 21:11:53	Freze	as conventional mlibs
2016-10-17 21:12:37	Freze	In any case, I wont' probably get to the vector implementations for a while
2016-10-17 21:13:13	bcos_	Erm. Using "Ye Olde FPU" is probably faster than everything you've got there..
2016-10-17 21:14:20	bcos_	..and more precise (80-bit if you're in the mood for that)
2016-10-17 21:14:41	Freze	(For the vector stuff my current thinking is that I'll need to adapt the scalar code by trying to eliminate as many branches, checking inputs for NaN/Infs first, then hitting up the main computational loops)
2016-10-17 21:14:44	zid	I'd have just done fexp and been done with it
2016-10-17 21:15:34	Freze	zid, ?

2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:50:06] what you're describing is a process [08:50:06]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:50:07] :P [08:50:07]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	bcos_	[08:51:04]  If you want, you can think of it as "processes that share half their virtual address space" [08:51:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:51:16] aka processes [08:51:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:51:21] with shared memory [08:51:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	bcos_	[08:52:05] Sort of "processes with shared memory, that share things like file handles, permissions, etc too" [08:52:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:52:43] processes can share handles [08:52:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	zid	[08:52:45] bcos_: again, that is already how fork works [08:52:45]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	bcos_	[08:52:48] ..but much easier to think of it as "threads that belong to the same process (that have thread specific storage)" [08:52:48]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	bcos_	[08:53:08] "fork()" is for deluded *nix wannabees [08:53:08]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	zid	[08:53:27] why are you implementing fork then [08:53:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	bcos_	[08:53:29] ..and no; it's not how fork works [08:53:29]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	zid	[08:53:34] yea, that's exactly how fork works [08:53:34]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:53:50] windows allows you to spawn a process inheriting handles of the parent as well [08:53:50]

2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:56:12] well, you're the one coming up with a new term that sounds almost verbally identical to an existing term which is well defined, and then declaring an opposite definition which already exists as a completely different name :P [08:56:12]

2016-10-18 00:14:19	zid	[08:58:55] bcos_: how is shared data and unshared data different from shared data and unshared data. [08:58:55]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:58:56] the distinction of threads within a process is that resources are shared. other than that, processes dont even get 'scheduled' on windows, only threads do [08:58:56]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[09:00:25] you can set ACL's on thread security descriptors but afaik you cant map thread-private memory within the same process. to exclude memory you need to use an OS construct that is a non-shared environment by default which is a process [09:00:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[09:00:46] consequently, this is why chrome spawns 235987235 processes [09:00:46]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	zid	[09:01:15] The only difference between two processes with shared memory and your thing will be the api calls made to achieve it, the result will be identical [09:01:15]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	boru	[09:01:24] They're resorted to ad hominems; probably no point continuing the discussion. [09:01:24]

2016-10-18 01:09:52	asla	not sure what packing method is used
2016-10-18 01:09:54	ryonaloli	i mean you could even just unpack it in memory to patch it
2016-10-18 01:10:00	asla	seems proprietary
2016-10-18 01:10:02	ryonaloli	well that's not a difficult problem
2016-10-18 01:10:19	ryonaloli	then it's probably based on something existing
2016-10-18 01:10:27	OxFEEDBACC	unpacking is likely one of the first function that program executes...
2016-10-18 01:10:30	Coldseeker	indeed, you -- by definition --have a copy of the unpacker.

2016-10-18 06:58:42	Jester01	and a global is not usable because?
2016-10-18 06:59:27	OxFEEDBACC	1) because i don't know the connection descriptor beforehand, 2) that wouldn't properly work with multiple connections...
2016-10-18 06:59:54	Jester01	sure would, just make a table.

2016-10-18 07:00:29	Jester01	and you will eventually need to know that descriptor before calling the poll_for_event so just fill it in then
2016-10-18 07:00:29	OxFEEDBACC	and which index do i chose? just the file descriptor?
2016-10-18 07:00:40	Jester01	yeah look up by fd
2016-10-18 07:00:55	OxFEEDBACC	well, it's improbable that i have a couple hundred connections at the same time, but...
2016-10-18 07:01:16	Jester01	and even if you do, a couple of hundred bytes is not much :)

2016-10-18 07:02:44	Jester01	note that even with your approach you'd have to store the descriptor so the memory requirement is there.
2016-10-18 07:03:28	OxFEEDBACC	but i don't need a (possibly sparse) array...
2016-10-18 07:03:44	OxFEEDBACC	sure, 100 mallocs have some overhead as well... well...
2016-10-18 07:04:07	OxFEEDBACC	well, did i tell you that i'm just about to invent a new malloc? :-D (not seriously)

2016-10-18 07:19:10	Jester01	anyway, doesn't xcb give you a fd-to-connection function?

2016-10-18 09:20:24	oeao	in the usual 64-bit Linux ABI (System V), is it ok to call a function that returns a 64-bit integer by calling it as if it returned nothing, and ignoring the return in the RAX register?

2016-10-18 09:25:16	Freze	I was auditing base library and this is how the check for Infs vs. my  implementation : http://pastebin.com/L730KHj4
2016-10-18 09:25:36	GeDaMo	RAX always contains a value, if you don't care about it, you can always overwrite it
2016-10-18 09:25:42	Freze	How can I audit performance : should I use IACA ?
2016-10-18 09:25:59	vulture	write a benchmark
2016-10-18 09:26:00	Freze	benchmarking is kinda useless since these are in the nanosecond range
2016-10-18 09:26:10	Freze	so I basically get that they are the same speed

2016-10-18 09:29:50	hawes	so looking at the references real fast
2016-10-18 09:31:20	hawes	I am looking at the flags. The SF flag was 0 and the of flag was also 0 and when I hit the

2016-10-18 09:31:20	hawes	jl      <random place to jump to>  // At this place the of and sf flags were still zero
2016-10-18 09:31:20	hawes	So since those flags were still zero we just didnt jump however if the sf flag was 1 we should of then jumped correct?

2016-10-18 10:10:20	hawes	So Since eax is zero and it's doing test eax,eax  it does a bitwise and operation and 0,0 is 0 so then the ZF flag is set to ZF=1 and then it hits the jl and since jl in this case
2016-10-18 10:10:20	hawes	as you said with the
2016-10-18 10:10:20	hawes	if(eax < 0) goto lable
2016-10-18 10:10:20	hawes	that will be false and not run since eax,eax cant be less then it's self?
2016-10-18 10:12:07	GeDaMo	jl jumps if SF != OF
2016-10-18 10:12:23	GeDaMo	ZF is irrelevant
2016-10-18 10:12:41	hawes	how ever if we had eax = 0 and esi = 12

2016-10-18 10:12:41	hawes	jl      <some random address>
2016-10-18 10:12:41	hawes	as you all stated it will perform a bitwise and operation and it will again be 0 so the ZF flag is set to ZF=1 and since eax is in fact less then esi it will jmp?
2016-10-18 10:12:43	hawes	ohhh
2016-10-18 10:13:40	GeDaMo	SF will be 1 if the most significant bit is set i.e. the value is negative
2016-10-18 10:14:58	hawes	I gotcha now GeDaMo =)
2016-10-18 10:19:21	GeDaMo	And test will set OF to 0

2016-10-18 13:52:19	heelpmeplz	I have an assignment where I receive a start and end time as user input, for example 2:30pm would be input as "1430".  I'm supposed to subtract one time from another and then display the hour and minute.  It seems the easiest way to do this is to divide by 100, with the quotient being the hour and the remainder being the minutes.  However, we are instructed to do this using a constant that represents the number of minutes in an
2016-10-18 13:52:19	heelpmeplz	hour.  I don't see where this could come into play in the calculation.  Maybe this isn't exactly an ASM question, but does anyone have any ideas?
2016-10-18 13:54:24	Jester01	I guess you have text input, so convert the first two digits into number, multiply by your constant (60) then convert the next two digits and add it
2016-10-18 13:54:24		[13:54]
2016-10-18 13:55:51	Jester01	repeat for the other input, do the subtraction, then do a division by your constant and print the quotient and the remainder
2016-10-18 13:56:29	heelpmeplz	that makes as much sense as anything, I suppose
2016-10-18 13:57:17	toothe	This file must be statically linked, I can't seem to get anything to freeze on ReadFile or ReadFileEx

2016-10-18 13:58:22	toothe	ohh! I must have used the wrong file. I didn't. Let me check.
2016-10-18 14:00:15	toothe	same deal.
2016-10-18 14:00:18	toothe	Doesn't stop at NtReadFile.
2016-10-18 14:01:25	toothe	hm...so, there's no import of CreateFile or ReadFile.
2016-10-18 14:01:44	toothe	Is there a way to say "Break if this data is utilized" ?
2016-10-18 14:01:46	vulture	you dont really need an import to be able to import it

2016-10-18 14:02:14	vulture	you could try breakpointing DeviceIoControl as well, that's less likely than ReadFile but who knows
2016-10-18 14:02:34	vulture	also you could try running procmon and filter that process
2016-10-18 14:02:39	vulture	and see if it catches obvious stuff

2016-10-18 14:07:52	vulture	just highlight the address

2016-10-18 14:14:05	toothe	i clicked on the string in HexView, went to debugger, breakpoints, add break point.
2016-10-18 14:14:37	toothe	Nothing changes in HexView...
2016-10-18 14:14:50	vulture	looks fine
2016-10-18 14:16:19	vulture	of course, if the breakpoint occurs while the kernel has control, you might not get it to fire
2016-10-18 14:16:34	toothe	you know....I just changed that string from "Communication" to "Commaaaaaa"
2016-10-18 14:16:37	toothe	just to see if anything would change
2016-10-18 14:16:38	toothe	nope...
2016-10-18 14:16:47	toothe	so somehow that memory address isn't accessed at all.
