2016-10-17 20:37:49	Freze	The only problem is I'm working on implementing elementary math functions, so I can't sterilize the input

2016-10-17 20:39:01	Freze	the second approach being leave them till the end of the code
2016-10-17 20:39:13	vulture	if you're expecting exceptions then you should probably exit as early as possible (performing ops on exception values is often *incredibly* slow)

2016-10-17 21:03:33	Freze	[06:59:40] vulture, for the main computational loop why would it matter ? Branch and exit for the exceptional cases early, and then do the computational loop (which will take advantage of simd). For scalar inputs that is. [06:59:40]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:00:00] simd prefers determinism [07:00:00]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:00:14] you cant branch one 'data' but not another [07:00:14]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:00:30] but you can do masks and conditional moves and such [07:00:30]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:00:46] rather, you dont use control constructs to branch 'data' :P [07:00:46]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:01:48] some platforms (e.g. cuda) provide a bit to enable or disable instruction writeback for individual data parts of a simd operation [07:01:48]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:01:53] many dont [07:01:53]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:02:04] and require you to manually use masks etc [07:02:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:02:33] in both cases, though, code divergence is a big impact on SIMD performance [07:02:33]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	Freze	[07:03:19] For vector inputs, (i.e. sin(x) of  a vector x) I see the advantage of first making sure your input contains no excpetional cases and then plowing through the a branchless version for the computations [07:03:19]

2016-10-17 21:04:15	Freze	For scalar inputs, the branch versions win in terms of speed

2016-10-17 21:04:50	vulture	also, dealing with exceptions is pretty useless in floating point code
2016-10-17 21:04:58	vulture	if you're hitting exceptions, you've already completely failed
2016-10-17 21:05:13	vulture	I understand this is general library code but general libraries are awful too :P~
2016-10-17 21:05:44	Freze	I agree, but people will hang me if I don't deal with them "correctly"
2016-10-17 21:06:00	Freze	It's a pain, esp. subnormals
2016-10-17 21:06:15	zid	x86 has a flag to force subnormals to 0 doesn't it
2016-10-17 21:06:35	zid	it speeds up code that deals with them in exhcange for slowing down the rest slightly or something?
2016-10-17 21:06:47	boru	Probably. CISCs tend to have instructions for making toast.
2016-10-17 21:06:54	zid	mmmm toast

2016-10-17 21:07:23	vulture	Doing floating-point math with the x87 FPU on NaNs or infinities numbers caused a 900 times slowdown on Pentium 4 processors
2016-10-17 21:07:23	vulture	Core 2 processors the worst-case I have measured is a 175 times slowdown, on SSE addition and multiplication
2016-10-17 21:08:23	vulture	which is why, especially if you're doing scalar functions, you should do early exits
2016-10-17 21:08:49	vulture	otoh, you shouldnt have any exception values in the first place or you're a bad person, and it will only be slow if you've already broken it
2016-10-17 21:09:04	Freze	Ok thanks,
2016-10-17 21:10:28	vulture	in any case, the context and implementation details were very important for choosing one or the other :P
2016-10-17 21:10:55	Freze	Right. My conclusions are that for vectors of large size one would need a custom code anyways for max perf.
2016-10-17 21:11:45	Freze	For scalars best to stick with branches and early exits
2016-10-17 21:11:53	Freze	as conventional mlibs
2016-10-17 21:12:37	Freze	In any case, I wont' probably get to the vector implementations for a while
2016-10-17 21:13:13	bcos_	Erm. Using "Ye Olde FPU" is probably faster than everything you've got there..
2016-10-17 21:14:20	bcos_	..and more precise (80-bit if you're in the mood for that)
2016-10-17 21:14:41	Freze	(For the vector stuff my current thinking is that I'll need to adapt the scalar code by trying to eliminate as many branches, checking inputs for NaN/Infs first, then hitting up the main computational loops)
2016-10-17 21:14:44	zid	I'd have just done fexp and been done with it
2016-10-17 21:15:34	Freze	zid, ?

2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:50:06] what you're describing is a process [08:50:06]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:50:07] :P [08:50:07]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	bcos_	[08:51:04]  If you want, you can think of it as "processes that share half their virtual address space" [08:51:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:51:16] aka processes [08:51:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:51:21] with shared memory [08:51:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	bcos_	[08:52:05] Sort of "processes with shared memory, that share things like file handles, permissions, etc too" [08:52:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:52:43] processes can share handles [08:52:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	zid	[08:52:45] bcos_: again, that is already how fork works [08:52:45]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	bcos_	[08:52:48] ..but much easier to think of it as "threads that belong to the same process (that have thread specific storage)" [08:52:48]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	bcos_	[08:53:08] "fork()" is for deluded *nix wannabees [08:53:08]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	zid	[08:53:27] why are you implementing fork then [08:53:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	bcos_	[08:53:29] ..and no; it's not how fork works [08:53:29]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	zid	[08:53:34] yea, that's exactly how fork works [08:53:34]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:53:50] windows allows you to spawn a process inheriting handles of the parent as well [08:53:50]

2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:56:12] well, you're the one coming up with a new term that sounds almost verbally identical to an existing term which is well defined, and then declaring an opposite definition which already exists as a completely different name :P [08:56:12]

2016-10-18 00:14:19	zid	[08:58:55] bcos_: how is shared data and unshared data different from shared data and unshared data. [08:58:55]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:58:56] the distinction of threads within a process is that resources are shared. other than that, processes dont even get 'scheduled' on windows, only threads do [08:58:56]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[09:00:25] you can set ACL's on thread security descriptors but afaik you cant map thread-private memory within the same process. to exclude memory you need to use an OS construct that is a non-shared environment by default which is a process [09:00:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[09:00:46] consequently, this is why chrome spawns 235987235 processes [09:00:46]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	zid	[09:01:15] The only difference between two processes with shared memory and your thing will be the api calls made to achieve it, the result will be identical [09:01:15]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	boru	[09:01:24] They're resorted to ad hominems; probably no point continuing the discussion. [09:01:24]

2016-10-18 01:09:52	asla	not sure what packing method is used
2016-10-18 01:09:54	ryonaloli	i mean you could even just unpack it in memory to patch it
2016-10-18 01:10:00	asla	seems proprietary
2016-10-18 01:10:02	ryonaloli	well that's not a difficult problem
2016-10-18 01:10:19	ryonaloli	then it's probably based on something existing
2016-10-18 01:10:27	OxFEEDBACC	unpacking is likely one of the first function that program executes...
2016-10-18 01:10:30	Coldseeker	indeed, you -- by definition --have a copy of the unpacker.

2016-10-18 06:58:42	Jester01	and a global is not usable because?
2016-10-18 06:59:27	OxFEEDBACC	1) because i don't know the connection descriptor beforehand, 2) that wouldn't properly work with multiple connections...
2016-10-18 06:59:54	Jester01	sure would, just make a table.

2016-10-18 07:00:29	Jester01	and you will eventually need to know that descriptor before calling the poll_for_event so just fill it in then
2016-10-18 07:00:29	OxFEEDBACC	and which index do i chose? just the file descriptor?
2016-10-18 07:00:40	Jester01	yeah look up by fd
2016-10-18 07:00:55	OxFEEDBACC	well, it's improbable that i have a couple hundred connections at the same time, but...
2016-10-18 07:01:16	Jester01	and even if you do, a couple of hundred bytes is not much :)

2016-10-18 07:02:44	Jester01	note that even with your approach you'd have to store the descriptor so the memory requirement is there.
2016-10-18 07:03:28	OxFEEDBACC	but i don't need a (possibly sparse) array...
2016-10-18 07:03:44	OxFEEDBACC	sure, 100 mallocs have some overhead as well... well...
2016-10-18 07:04:07	OxFEEDBACC	well, did i tell you that i'm just about to invent a new malloc? :-D (not seriously)

2016-10-18 07:19:10	Jester01	anyway, doesn't xcb give you a fd-to-connection function?

2016-10-18 09:20:24	oeao	in the usual 64-bit Linux ABI (System V), is it ok to call a function that returns a 64-bit integer by calling it as if it returned nothing, and ignoring the return in the RAX register?

2016-10-18 09:25:16	Freze	I was auditing base library and this is how the check for Infs vs. my  implementation : http://pastebin.com/L730KHj4
2016-10-18 09:25:36	GeDaMo	RAX always contains a value, if you don't care about it, you can always overwrite it
2016-10-18 09:25:42	Freze	How can I audit performance : should I use IACA ?
2016-10-18 09:25:59	vulture	write a benchmark
2016-10-18 09:26:00	Freze	benchmarking is kinda useless since these are in the nanosecond range
2016-10-18 09:26:10	Freze	so I basically get that they are the same speed

2016-10-18 09:29:50	hawes	so looking at the references real fast
2016-10-18 09:31:20	hawes	I am looking at the flags. The SF flag was 0 and the of flag was also 0 and when I hit the

2016-10-18 09:31:20	hawes	jl      <random place to jump to>  // At this place the of and sf flags were still zero
2016-10-18 09:31:20	hawes	So since those flags were still zero we just didnt jump however if the sf flag was 1 we should of then jumped correct?

2016-10-18 10:10:20	hawes	So Since eax is zero and it's doing test eax,eax  it does a bitwise and operation and 0,0 is 0 so then the ZF flag is set to ZF=1 and then it hits the jl and since jl in this case
2016-10-18 10:10:20	hawes	as you said with the
2016-10-18 10:10:20	hawes	if(eax < 0) goto lable
2016-10-18 10:10:20	hawes	that will be false and not run since eax,eax cant be less then it's self?
2016-10-18 10:12:07	GeDaMo	jl jumps if SF != OF
2016-10-18 10:12:23	GeDaMo	ZF is irrelevant
2016-10-18 10:12:41	hawes	how ever if we had eax = 0 and esi = 12

2016-10-18 10:12:41	hawes	jl      <some random address>
2016-10-18 10:12:41	hawes	as you all stated it will perform a bitwise and operation and it will again be 0 so the ZF flag is set to ZF=1 and since eax is in fact less then esi it will jmp?
2016-10-18 10:12:43	hawes	ohhh
2016-10-18 10:13:40	GeDaMo	SF will be 1 if the most significant bit is set i.e. the value is negative
2016-10-18 10:14:58	hawes	I gotcha now GeDaMo =)
2016-10-18 10:19:21	GeDaMo	And test will set OF to 0

2016-10-18 13:52:19	heelpmeplz	I have an assignment where I receive a start and end time as user input, for example 2:30pm would be input as "1430".  I'm supposed to subtract one time from another and then display the hour and minute.  It seems the easiest way to do this is to divide by 100, with the quotient being the hour and the remainder being the minutes.  However, we are instructed to do this using a constant that represents the number of minutes in an
2016-10-18 13:52:19	heelpmeplz	hour.  I don't see where this could come into play in the calculation.  Maybe this isn't exactly an ASM question, but does anyone have any ideas?
2016-10-18 13:54:24	Jester01	I guess you have text input, so convert the first two digits into number, multiply by your constant (60) then convert the next two digits and add it
2016-10-18 13:54:24		[13:54]
2016-10-18 13:55:51	Jester01	repeat for the other input, do the subtraction, then do a division by your constant and print the quotient and the remainder
2016-10-18 13:56:29	heelpmeplz	that makes as much sense as anything, I suppose
2016-10-18 13:57:17	toothe	This file must be statically linked, I can't seem to get anything to freeze on ReadFile or ReadFileEx

2016-10-18 14:00:18	toothe	Doesn't stop at NtReadFile.
2016-10-18 14:01:25	toothe	hm...so, there's no import of CreateFile or ReadFile.
2016-10-18 14:01:44	toothe	Is there a way to say "Break if this data is utilized" ?

2016-10-18 14:02:14	vulture	you could try breakpointing DeviceIoControl as well, that's less likely than ReadFile but who knows
2016-10-18 14:02:34	vulture	also you could try running procmon and filter that process

2016-10-18 19:16:37		[19:16]
2016-10-18 19:16:50	harrisi	it's part of a quiz question
2016-10-18 19:17:08	harrisi	the full quiz question is many more instructions, and the question has nothing to do with those three, really.
2016-10-18 19:17:21	harrisi	I just found those three lines odd.
2016-10-18 19:17:58	OxFEEDBACC	maybe the question _has_ to do with it, and it's just hard to see...
2016-10-18 19:18:44	harrisi	possibly. I think I can get the answer without knowing exactly what those three movs do, though.
2016-10-18 19:19:06	OxFEEDBACC	okay...
2016-10-18 19:20:18	harrisi	they're like part of the "preamble" (pushing %ebp, storing %esp in %ebp, etc.) and the question is more about understanding whether this function (30 instructions) does one of four things (summing arguments, product of arguments, etc.)
2016-10-18 19:21:05	harrisi	but! I fully respect not wanting to give answers to a student taking a quiz, so I'll work on it alone. :)

2016-10-18 23:55:20	vulture	[00:35:33] in the modules list [00:35:33]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	vulture	[00:35:44] right click on the modules you see in your stack trace, and click load debug symbols [00:35:44]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	vulture	[00:36:00] toothe: ^ [00:36:00]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	vulture	[00:36:43] I dont know how you've disabled default symbol loading, but maybe that's something ida changed to speed up load times where my config file is from and older time where they didnt do that [00:36:43]

2016-10-18 23:55:20	xtra_	[04:15:58] but are x's given because the variables are placed under the code [04:15:58]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	xtra_	[04:16:10] rather than should be placed before the code [04:16:10]

2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[04:51:42] what would the purpose of those instructions one after another be? [04:51:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[04:52:14] doesn't it just zero out %eax and 0xfffffff4(%ebp)? I don't get the use for the third mov. [04:52:14]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	OxFEEDBACC	[05:16:37] harrisi: where did you find it? [05:16:37]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[05:16:50] it's part of a quiz question [05:16:50]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[05:17:08] the full quiz question is many more instructions, and the question has nothing to do with those three, really. [05:17:08]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[05:17:21] I just found those three lines odd. [05:17:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	OxFEEDBACC	[05:17:58] maybe the question _has_ to do with it, and it's just hard to see... [05:17:58]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[05:18:44] possibly. I think I can get the answer without knowing exactly what those three movs do, though. [05:18:44]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	OxFEEDBACC	[05:19:06] okay... [05:19:06]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[05:20:18] they're like part of the "preamble" (pushing %ebp, storing %esp in %ebp, etc.) and the question is more about understanding whether this function (30 instructions) does one of four things (summing arguments, product of arguments, etc.) [05:20:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[05:21:05] but! I fully respect not wanting to give answers to a student taking a quiz, so I'll work on it alone. :) [05:21:05]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[05:35:21] okay, I know this is a quiz, but this is certainly not right.. mov %eax,(%esp,1) [05:35:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[05:35:46] that's not valid, right? [05:35:46]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	OxFEEDBACC	[05:37:33] translates to | 67 89 04 24 | --- | mov %eax,(%esp) | [05:37:33]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[05:37:55] hm.. okay. thanks. [05:37:55]

2016-10-19 03:17:40	OxFEEDBACC	x87, iirc, has a subnormals-to-zero mode too, but when the ABI specifies a defined state on each function entry, a compiler can rely on that... (not that the defined state is guaranteed to be active, depending on 3rd party code that you may interoperate with)

2016-10-19 10:15:32	zid	and for some reason you're failing to understand it
2016-10-19 10:15:40	zid	it's all very clearly written
2016-10-19 10:17:35	xtra_	so the value of AGE is $50, LAST1 is 2, save is c008, array is c000, weight is c003, entry is c00F

2016-10-19 10:19:26	xtra_	...
2016-10-19 10:19:27	zid	what's the address of the bra Entry
2016-10-19 10:19:48	xtra_	its eitehr
2016-10-19 10:19:50	xtra_	c00f or c000
2016-10-19 10:19:56	zid	well the latter is wrong as shit
2016-10-19 10:20:07	zid	because as we agreed, C000 is ldx #array
2016-10-19 10:20:16	zid	and C000 + F is C00F, not C000
2016-10-19 10:20:34	zid	So considering C00F is the bra Entry, can anything else be at C00F?
2016-10-19 10:20:34	xtra_	ok

2016-10-19 10:22:37	xtra_	ahh

2016-10-19 10:24:00	xtra_	so age is right, last1 is right
2016-10-19 10:24:02	xtra_	and entry is right
2016-10-19 10:24:09	GeDaMo	No, Entry is wrong

2016-10-19 10:38:58	GeDaMo	weight is a label which is translated to an address, $C0 is the value stored at that address
2016-10-19 10:39:06	zid	do you want to know where the array is, or do I want you to know the value of the first of the 40 billion bytes?
2016-10-19 10:39:36	xtra_	te array
2016-10-19 10:39:40	xtra_	ok gedamo
2016-10-19 10:39:46	xtra_	in that case
2016-10-19 10:40:02	xtra_	the answer is $C0
2016-10-19 10:40:12	GeDaMo	The answer to what?
2016-10-19 10:40:18	xtra_	the question
2016-10-19 10:40:26	zid	xtra_: weight being on Const isn't actually practical, but array being in it is
2016-10-19 10:40:27	xtra_	it says find the value of "weight"
2016-10-19 10:40:32	GeDaMo	The question is looking for the value of the symbols
2016-10-19 10:40:35	zid	weight could easily be an equ instead
2016-10-19 10:40:43	zid	but it isn't
2016-10-19 10:40:50	xtra_	oh
2016-10-19 10:40:52	xtra_	there we go zid
2016-10-19 10:40:56	xtra_	so if it isnt equ
2016-10-19 10:41:02	xtra_	u need to show the array

2016-10-19 10:45:34	xtra_	err yeah
2016-10-19 10:45:35	GeDaMo	Yeah, array should be C011

2016-10-19 10:46:53	zid	I will check your answers
2016-10-19 10:47:00	xtra_	but what summed it all up is that if it is not EQU, then the value is the addres

Could anyone point me in the right direction? Ive tried movw movb movl movq and get the same results with all… I’m guessing
2016-10-19 16:26:20	protoCall7	did something wrong in the input template?  I asked in ##C and was directed towards this channel (even though I kind of believe this to be a C issue, not necessarily an ASM issue)

Could anyone point me in the right direction? Ive tried movw movb movl movq and get the same results with all… I’m guessing [02:26:20]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	protoCall7	[02:26:20] did something wrong in the input template?  I asked in ##C and was directed towards this channel (even though I kind of believe this to be a C issue, not necessarily an ASM issue) [02:26:20]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	protoCall7	[02:37:38] Thanks to anyone who would have looked, I figured out what I was doing wrong (didn’t need to movq %0 because the input operand was already stuffing %0 into %rdi for me) [02:37:38]

2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:14:08] The part that facilitates pre-executing instructions in paralell & such [07:14:08]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:15:01] dansan: At any rate: Modern operating systems do all their context switches in software entirely because its faster, easier to do and more flexible. [07:15:01]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:15:33] makes perfect sense. But the CPUs all still ship with support for these features that nobody uses so that they keep their transistor count high? :) [07:15:33]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:15:54] dminuoso_: Thanks for the info btw! :) [07:15:54]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:15:54] dansan: x86 has a long standing tradition of always keeping downwards compatible. [07:15:54]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:16:05] yeah, I know [07:16:05]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:16:10] dansan: This is to ensure regardless of what bizarre mechanism you use, a chip upgrade will still run your software. [07:16:10]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:16:18] That has upsides and downsides of course [07:16:18]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:16:24] dansan: Look at the A20 gate for example. Intel didn't remove that silly hack for 30 (!) years. [07:16:24]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:16:49] Forcing all bootloader and bare metal developers to access keyboard controllers and other strange parts to enable half the memory during boot. [07:16:49]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:17:02] lol!! [07:17:02]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:17:56] All because there was some developers that relied on memory wraparound from the 8086/8088 days [07:17:56]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:18:00] Which is super crazy enough. [07:18:00]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:18:03] omg! [07:18:03]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:18:25] So yeah, x86 doesn't just remove features. ;-) [07:18:25]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:18:57] I can understand that from a business/marketing standpoint [07:18:57]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:19:25] You set your customer's expectations and don't let them down [07:19:25]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:19:30] dansan: With things such as the A20 aside, a modern Core i7 processor will still run 40 year old software that ran on the 8086. [07:19:30]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:19:39] For good or worse. [07:19:39]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:20:36] Maybe we'll get to the point where virtualization will give them more room to really remove old stuff. [07:20:36]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:20:48] Virtualization has nothing to do with this. [07:20:48]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:20:52] Because if you really need it then you can emulate it [07:20:52]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:20:58] Virtualization is not emulation. [07:20:58]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:21:02] This is a very important distinction. [07:21:02]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:21:08] Yes, good point [07:21:08]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:21:24] Emulation is a very cost intensive process. Virtualization with some hardware support comes with little to no penalty at all. [07:21:24]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:21:40] And virtualization does not change the underlying hardware characteristics either [07:21:40]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:21:45] But, I mean that feature where you can emulate execution and if the guest happens to be also x86 then it executes all instructions that it can nativly (iiuc) [07:21:45]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:22:06] Well crap, then I'm probably using the wrong word [07:22:06]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:26:08] wb! [07:26:08]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso1	[07:46:02] wtf is this. [07:46:02]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso1	[07:46:33] GAS is so strange. [07:46:33]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	Coldseeker	[07:46:49] dminuoso1: you've got a numeral stuck to you name. [07:46:49]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso1	[07:48:19] Coldseeker: I know. I set up this ZNC a while ago, but keep forgetting that my work laptop does not have my perosnal 1password - so Im stuck having both dminuoso and dminuoso1 / dminuoso_ around. :| [07:48:19]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	archivist	[07:48:23] GAS is strange because it is a one size fits all assembler [07:48:23]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso1	[07:48:46] archivist: It's intel syntax is almost entirely, but not quite, unlike intel. [07:48:46]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[08:45:25] Is there a way to dynamically create a label in a macro? [08:45:25]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[08:45:37] (In GAS) [08:45:37]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[08:46:39] I basically want to do something along the lines of: .macro isr vector; isr_\vector\: .endm [08:46:39]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[08:47:09] Or do I really have to write out the 50 ISRs I intend to use? :( [08:47:09]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	vulture	[08:52:21] dminuoso: use the C preprocessor ? [08:52:21]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[08:57:33] vulture: Ohh, I think I figured it out: https://gist.github.com/dminuoso/6e917966e38c660509ee294172b7574f [08:57:33]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[08:57:52] (I think I have a few too many \() in there, but meh. [08:57:52]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	enso	[10:20:22] (more about gates than assembly) when you can use an 8-1 mux or an 4-1 mux to do the same task, is there an advantage of picking one over the other? [10:20:22]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	zid	[10:21:06] one is smaller? [10:21:06]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	archivist	[10:21:27] one probably has two in the box [10:21:27]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	zid	[10:21:43] I'd say one has 5 more pins than the other [10:21:43]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	archivist	[10:21:44] use the right tool for the job [10:21:44]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	enso	[10:24:06] yeah, but in order to use the 4-1 mux, you need to map the boolean functions to the input, whereas for the other one you can just map one input and maybe a few 1 or 0s [10:24:06]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	enso	[10:25:06] I see arguments in both favors, I just don't know which is best [10:25:06]

2016-10-20 00:55:47	dminuoso_	Im just majorly amazed how GCC re-orders volatile assembly. It even moves volatile inline assembly across control flow (say jumps) at times - there is no way to simply say "this assembly must happen right there".
2016-10-20 00:55:57	dminuoso_	So yeah, I get how you feel if your tools decide to optimize.
2016-10-20 00:59:19	GeDaMo	Optimizers aren't intelligent, sometimes they get things wrong; the assembler is where you get to say "do exactly what I tell you"
2016-10-20 01:01:27	dminuoso_	GeDaMo: The issue is just if your assembly has side effects for the code that follows, then you need to unpack your trick bag und use fake variables, add fake dependencies just so GCC does not move the volatile assembly around however it pleases.
2016-10-20 01:01:40	dminuoso_	So inline assembly is "do exactly what I tell you when you feel like it"

2016-10-20 22:15:31	boru	Seems reasonable that the data is loaded to SRAM from somewhere, and the game downloads it from there and writes it; either for debugging, or as you say, factory reset.
2016-10-20 22:16:05	zid	It just controls whether it bothers to see if sram already exists

2016-10-20 22:18:22	dansan	On x86_64 with a Linux kernel, is it safe to restore (add to) the SP and then access data beyond it or is that just asking for an illegal access?
2016-10-20 22:18:25	zid	the files are just 16 byte headers that are 4 ints xor blended and md5'd
2016-10-20 22:18:46	zid	dansan: adding to SP is equivalent to allocating memory
2016-10-20 22:18:59	zid	think of it like a piece of tape maybe
2016-10-20 22:19:05	dansan	zid: umm, I mean is stack-grows-down...
2016-10-20 22:19:16	zid	oh right, x86
2016-10-20 22:19:18	dansan	So I sub it to get use more stack

2016-10-20 22:19:42	dansan	yeah, but I'm just curious if I'm playing with fire to attempt it
2016-10-20 22:19:47	dansan	I'm guessing so
2016-10-20 22:19:50	zid	everything does it, constantly
2016-10-20 22:19:55	zid	to free shit from the stack
2016-10-20 22:20:15	dansan	but I mean to essentially "free" from the stack and then access that memory anyway
2016-10-20 22:21:16	zid	it's not deleted, it's still there, unless something like a userspacey interrupt happens and overwrites it, linux has kernel stacks for hardware interrupts I think that doesn't apply?
2016-10-20 22:21:23	zid	maybe pthreads or coroutines or something will care
2016-10-20 22:21:23	dansan	On a Linux kernel, I know that it would have already mmaped that memory once I used it *after* having allocated (decremented RSP). I guess my question is one for the LInux kernel then -- when do those pages get ummapped
2016-10-20 22:21:39	dansan	Well, the kernel uses it's own stack
2016-10-20 22:21:41	zid	probably never, there's a limt to how much stack you're allowed
2016-10-20 22:21:44	dansan	ahh! good point!
2016-10-20 22:22:11	dansan	Well yeah, but it's not really the stack "allocation", as much as it is the memory being mmapped and I guess "comitted"
2016-10-20 22:22:31	zid	it'd be hard to check that the stack is a lot smaller than it used to be honestly
2016-10-20 22:22:37	zid	you'd need some periodic check
2016-10-20 22:22:46	zid	just to free a couple of pages every few years
2016-10-20 22:22:50	dansan	lol!!!
2016-10-20 22:23:02	zid	huh?
2016-10-20 22:23:08	zid	did I tell a side splitting joke accidently?
2016-10-20 22:23:12	dansan	Well, being that this is for a gcc patch, probably better to be safe
2016-10-20 22:23:18	dansan	yeah :)

2016-10-20 22:38:22	dansan	iiuc, that is a stack frame when you are using a hard frame pointer
2016-10-20 22:38:47	klys	also the "enter" and "leave" instructions, I am told, do the same thing.
2016-10-20 22:38:55	dansan	oh yes! :)
2016-10-20 22:39:04	dansan	I learned that a week or two ago as well
2016-10-20 22:39:54	dansan	On x86_64, a hard frame pointer isn't needed for effective debugging, so (at least on gcc) the default with -O is to disable it (I think -O1 and above)

2016-10-22 01:20:17	devonrevenge	is it feasable to get am arm chip - add electronic modules like sd card holders and esp8266 type wifi modules -  program in asm to make it all work
2016-10-22 01:20:23	devonrevenge	and all in the same month
2016-10-22 01:20:32	devonrevenge	- this is for uni -
2016-10-22 01:20:50	devonrevenge	and is it possible with entry level scope?
2016-10-22 01:21:59	GeDaMo	devonrevenge: http://www.abstrusegoose.com/249
2016-10-22 01:22:37	zid	You might get a prototype working in a month if it was already something you were good at
2016-10-22 01:23:09	devonrevenge	thanks - i need to be aware of the scope of a project without finding out the hardway
2016-10-22 01:23:21	devonrevenge	because time is pretty valuable
2016-10-22 01:23:22	archivist	and if you found the right appnotes,libraries and OS for the parts
2016-10-22 01:23:37	devonrevenge	yeah too much can go wrong and its too important
2016-10-22 01:24:01	devonrevenge	I can do what I want with a teensy but then im not doing a computer science project my idea will turn into wearables

2016-10-22 01:24:26	zid	That's why I estimate my project will be done in 2040
2016-10-22 01:24:31	devonrevenge	then I will have to have one of the mac wielding web development supervisors mark my project
2016-10-22 01:24:41	devonrevenge	and I have invasive thoughts about murdering them
2016-10-22 01:24:46	archivist	ew
2016-10-22 01:25:13	archivist	removal of mac js web coders is ok by me
2016-10-22 01:25:53	GeDaMo	devonrevenge: what's the objective of your project?
2016-10-22 01:25:56	devonrevenge	yeah this crowd hype peoples ideas up into things they cant manage and mark them down for not doing it as they imagined
2016-10-22 01:26:20	devonrevenge	well im pretty free and have ideas coming out my ears - you guys might like this too
2016-10-22 01:26:44	archivist	often people join the dots by using pre written libraries and call that science
2016-10-22 01:26:50	devonrevenge	one of my ideas is to create a piece of wearable tech that contains your RSA algorithms or sutchlike
2016-10-22 01:27:11	devonrevenge	it has other forms of encryption for communicating localy
2016-10-22 01:27:17	GeDaMo	Cryptowallet
2016-10-22 01:27:24	devonrevenge	almost
2016-10-22 01:27:29	archivist	but....that exists methinks
2016-10-22 01:27:36	devonrevenge	this think is to make normal
2016-10-22 01:27:38	devonrevenge	thing
2016-10-22 01:28:07	archivist	er banks give out free keys for users to keep with them now
2016-10-22 01:28:12	devonrevenge	is to make normal people use encryption - so long as they are near their comp an option to encrypt or not will appear in a dropdown list
2016-10-22 01:28:31	devonrevenge	so if your device is paired - you can encrypt a file
2016-10-22 01:28:39	devonrevenge	or decrypt
2016-10-22 01:29:09	devonrevenge	also maybe slotting in an sd will encrypt it
2016-10-22 01:29:36	devonrevenge	-my plan is to make having encryption create the same mental space as using house keys-

2016-10-22 02:58:53	devonrevenge	so I have digressed
2016-10-22 02:58:57	zid	vulture_: or a pkcs 11 dongle, also everywhere
2016-10-22 02:58:58	devonrevenge	um
2016-10-22 02:59:01	zid	and all the tech already exists
2016-10-22 02:59:24	devonrevenge	it will allready exist im not making something too new - my idea doesnt quite exist
2016-10-22 02:59:36	devonrevenge	and the other thing is im making something that exists better
2016-10-22 03:00:16	devonrevenge	so imagine this, so long as your dongle is switched on when you right click a file - the extra option to decrypt or encrypt is available
2016-10-22 03:00:39	vulture_	what makes that more secure than just doing it on your laptop
2016-10-22 03:00:46	devonrevenge	or, on your phone, if you have shared a public key by rubbing your dongle/watch
2016-10-22 03:00:51	devonrevenge	you can send encrypted data
2016-10-22 03:00:52	vulture_	dongles are dumb
2016-10-22 03:00:58	vulture_	people just leave them in because they are ultra annoying
2016-10-22 03:01:00	devonrevenge	what makes you more secure is this -
2016-10-22 03:01:04	vulture_	so they are about as useful as not using them
2016-10-22 03:01:23	devonrevenge	you can send or store encrypted data - if its taken from you - ie your nude selfies
2016-10-22 03:01:32	devonrevenge	no one can see them
2016-10-22 03:01:47	vulture_	if someone takes your laptop (with dongle attached) then they can still decrypt
2016-10-22 03:01:50	devonrevenge	yeah so thats why an encryption watch is better
2016-10-22 03:01:59	devonrevenge	especially if it has an attractive UI
2016-10-22 03:02:10	vulture_	that's why people use phones for 2fa/mfa
2016-10-22 03:02:26	vulture_	they arent exactly the best, but, it's a physically/virtually separated device
2016-10-22 03:02:30	devonrevenge	2fa/mfa?
2016-10-22 03:02:31	vulture_	so you would need to compromise both
2016-10-22 03:02:47	devonrevenge	I wanted to make it as normal for people as carying keys
2016-10-22 03:02:58	devonrevenge	so mentally yo ulock your door - you lock your files

2016-10-22 03:04:21	zid	instead of typing passwords all day
2016-10-22 03:05:05	vulture_	pff, just store a master key on the disk or network, encrypted
2016-10-22 03:05:05		[03:05]

2016-10-22 03:05:46	vulture_	password more secure though unless you're bad @ password
2016-10-22 03:06:06	zid	not sure if sarcasm or retarded
2016-10-22 03:06:21	vulture_	are you saying you want to use proximity as opposed to physically plug?
2016-10-22 03:06:30	devonrevenge	addressing the design flaws and finding the best architecture isnt the same project
2016-10-22 03:06:30	vulture_	do you need to pair the devices?
2016-10-22 03:06:43	vulture_	or can people just jack authentication as you just by being near you
2016-10-22 03:06:56	devonrevenge	im saying that you use proximity as your means to encrypt things with your public key
2016-10-22 03:06:58	zid	pkcs is RSA, for reference
2016-10-22 03:07:08	zid	with your public key? I hope not
2016-10-22 03:07:25	vulture_	who cares about public keys
2016-10-22 03:07:27	devonrevenge	well they wont because the server program is communicating with its own 4 way handshake
2016-10-22 03:07:48	vulture_	public keys should be as public as possible
2016-10-22 03:08:04	vulture_	stronger authentication :D
2016-10-22 03:08:08	devonrevenge	and the large primes private key stays on the watch

2016-10-22 03:08:24	zid	devonrevenge*
2016-10-22 03:08:33	devonrevenge	yeah I do
2016-10-22 03:08:44	devonrevenge	I made a server and client
2016-10-22 03:08:49	zid	would you like to correct anything you just said then?
2016-10-22 03:08:53	devonrevenge	so you encryptify and decryptify
2016-10-22 03:09:03	devonrevenge	just if you encryptify and sendify
2016-10-22 03:09:13	devonrevenge	you do it with their public keys
2016-10-22 03:09:24	devonrevenge	that you rubbed your dongle on

2016-10-22 03:09:46	zid	I am, and that's why I can confidently say he has it inside out.
2016-10-22 03:10:00	vulture_	more inside out than goatse?
2016-10-22 03:10:03	devonrevenge	if you want to keep stuff encrypted then the file is uploaded to your watch and then downloaded at the same time in a stream like fasion
2016-10-22 03:10:42	archivist	rofl at gigabyte files to and from a watch
2016-10-22 03:10:45	devonrevenge	but theres too many specifities - the project idea is a good design tech project
2016-10-22 03:10:49	vulture_	meanwhile, I'm in the cubicle next to you, stealing your documents, cuz proximity
2016-10-22 03:10:54	devonrevenge	no
2016-10-22 03:11:06	devonrevenge	because theres a random pad on both my comp and the watch
2016-10-22 03:11:16	devonrevenge	so them bites are flipped

2016-10-22 03:15:56	vulture_	you can do that with software
2016-10-22 03:16:00	devonrevenge	so long as they turn their watch on
2016-10-22 03:16:01	vulture_	and without the hardware
2016-10-22 03:16:08	vulture_	I have like
2016-10-22 03:16:12	vulture_	8 security tokens
2016-10-22 03:16:15	vulture_	it's annoying to carry around

2016-10-22 03:16:18	devonrevenge	yeah but if your comps nicked the answer is in the question
2016-10-22 03:16:48	devonrevenge	if you have the option to decrypt something and encrypt it just because you are near when you are not near
2016-10-22 03:16:53	devonrevenge	then its safe
2016-10-22 03:17:05	devonrevenge	say someone creeps in to peekify
2016-10-22 03:17:11	devonrevenge	wait it could be real time :D
2016-10-22 03:17:20	archivist	and a lost device is a disaster

2016-10-22 03:18:36	vulture_	my point is just that, you could do everything you're saying, except without the custom device, and have it be more secure
2016-10-22 03:18:47	vulture_	what you're proposing is just convenience, at the cost of security
2016-10-22 03:18:52	vulture_	which is probably fine for a lot of people
2016-10-22 03:19:12	devonrevenge	well its not convenient if its not secure
2016-10-22 03:19:27	vulture_	sure it is
2016-10-22 03:19:27	zid	it's not secure in the slightest
2016-10-22 03:19:28	devonrevenge	if it is convenient and the purpose is security then it is more secure
2016-10-22 03:19:36	zid	so all you have going for you is convenient
2016-10-22 03:19:42	vulture_	what you're proposing is less secure, straight up
2016-10-22 03:19:46	vulture_	so it can only be for convenience
2016-10-22 03:19:56	devonrevenge	unless it doesnt transmit files in plain code
2016-10-22 03:19:58	--	vulture_ is now known as vulture
2016-10-22 03:20:06	vulture	that's completely irrelevant
2016-10-22 03:20:06		[03:20]
2016-10-22 03:20:08	vulture	to everything

2016-10-22 03:20:38	devonrevenge	whats the point of something if the point is convenience at the cost of making its purpose less convenient its more inconvenient
2016-10-22 03:21:03	vulture	you're not making it less convenient, you're making it less secure, but more convenient
2016-10-22 03:21:12	zid	devonrevenge: Imagine a house key with 400 teeth
2016-10-22 03:21:26	zid	it's easier to put a key with 5 teeth in your pocket, despite being less secure
2016-10-22 03:21:30	devonrevenge	its still the same as an object you posses on the condition that the information only applies to things your in control of
2016-10-22 03:21:32	zid	we have decided as people that this is a worthwhile tradeoff
2016-10-22 03:21:51	devonrevenge	if your car keys are stolen then thats less convenient for you but thats not supposed to happen
2016-10-22 03:22:26	devonrevenge	so im creating a key that people use

2016-10-22 03:22:42	devonrevenge	the problem with pgp is that people should use it but you need crypto parties
2016-10-22 03:22:46	devonrevenge	yeah
2016-10-22 03:23:15	zid	so you are aware that it is possible to sacrifice security for convenicence You trying to redefine what both of those words mean isn't tricking us
2016-10-22 03:23:17	devonrevenge	one slows down the thief the other is more of a garauntee they would smaash a window
2016-10-22 03:23:34	devonrevenge	no but its a security device is it not
2016-10-22 03:23:41	zid	so is a key
2016-10-22 03:23:48	devonrevenge	so wheres the convenience if its more insecure
2016-10-22 03:23:58	vulture	convenience != security
2016-10-22 03:24:06	vulture	you can have more or less of one independent of the other

2016-10-22 03:24:19	devonrevenge	so im better off leaving my house door open?
2016-10-22 03:24:31	vulture	zid: it's not really inconvenient, that's how long my pants are anyway
2016-10-22 03:24:43	zid	vulture: Mine are filled with penis so there's no room for extra big keys
2016-10-22 03:24:43	devonrevenge	because the range is only as good as useing the computer
2016-10-22 03:25:00	devonrevenge	so its as good as plugging the device in

2016-10-22 03:25:08	zid	instead of attempting to talk over everybody

2016-10-22 03:25:57	zid	No, you've spent the past 10 minutes trying to redefine what the word convenient means
2016-10-22 03:26:03	zid	nothing to do with some magic device
2016-10-22 03:26:16	vulture	also, potentially less convenient since now I have a 9th device I need to carry around with me everywhere ;)
2016-10-22 03:26:19	zid	devonrevenge: Iss a house key that is 40 feet long convenient?
2016-10-22 03:27:09	devonrevenge	the range is not a problem as the information can be useless unless your sitting infront of the comp so no - a key 40 long isnt convenient
2016-10-22 03:27:16	zid	wow you did it again
2016-10-22 03:27:26	zid	you managed to answer a yes/no question with a paragraph of waffle about some device
2016-10-22 03:27:36	devonrevenge	well no
2016-10-22 03:27:36	vulture	it's like talking to a wall, with a parrot in the wall
2016-10-22 03:27:42	devonrevenge	but the question is nothing to do with magic device

2016-10-22 03:31:42	vulture	unless you have a secure pairing protocol, proximity is an extremely insecure basis for security
2016-10-22 03:31:59	vulture	and if you have a secure pairing protocol, yuo might as well just use a smartphone, cuz they're ubiquitous and convenient
2016-10-22 03:32:16	zid	Fairy: I don't think I could bring enough hotdogs for how hard he'd get roasted trying to talk over everybody and saying simple questions are insulting

2016-10-22 04:44:04	hackal	Was thinking more about "real world" example. Looking at wiki now I understand "shifting left is equivalent to multiplication by powers of 2"
2016-10-22 04:45:21	SlashLife	hackal: You can do that, but it is more related to bitwise operations.

2016-10-22 04:46:44	SlashLife	For example if you have an unsigned 32 bit integer representing an IP address, and you want the class C network address for if (x.y.z.0), you can AND it with (~0) (that's all bits set to 1) << 8
2016-10-22 04:48:35	SlashLife	hackal: Well - more related if you look at it on a higher level.
2016-10-22 04:48:35		[04:48]
2016-10-22 04:49:18	hackal	I think I should revise data representation first
2016-10-22 04:49:48	SlashLife	Even if you look at a language like C, if you want to multiply, you should use *, if you want to move bits around, you should use <<; even if the result would be the same, just to communicate your intentions to the next person reading the code.
2016-10-22 04:50:35	SlashLife	A bit shift will likely execute faster than the equivalent multiplication, but the compiler is smart enough to figure out whether it can use SHL or needs to use MUL.
2016-10-22 04:51:42	SlashLife	In assembly - yes, okay. Use bit shifts for multiplication with powers of 2, but as I said: Semantically a bit shift (as the name actually says) is rather to move around bits.
2016-10-22 04:52:09	ggole	Particularly since multiplication and shift are not the same for signed quantities

2016-10-22 09:50:19	Jester01	in the sense the question was asked, that's a NO
2016-10-22 09:50:50	Jester01	beq is a goto, not a function call

2016-10-22 09:52:21	zid	because the bne always bgoes to numDiff
2016-10-22 09:52:27	Jester01	you should do something to come back from there

2016-10-22 09:55:07	Jester01	as I said above
2016-10-22 09:55:27	Jester01	add code to go back to line 14

2016-10-22 09:55:32	Jester01	or just copy the exit syscall there
2016-10-22 09:55:34	kaos	zid: what is 0 in mips asm?

2016-10-22 09:56:28	hackal	Ok, but what if I want to continue the main code. Right now bne on line 10 jumps to numDiff, so I guess it needs to jump back right?

For example  *(_DWORD *)&a1->dword8 = 0; and dword8 is defined as bool but IDA doesn't recognize 0 as false. Is there anyway to define that 0 as false in this case so there is no cast. mostly for readability purposes.
2016-10-22 12:00:01	zid	you could add a false enum and tell it's an enum could you not?

2016-10-22 12:01:28	Guest66171	i would like to do that because that would eliminate showing the *(_DWord )&a1 cast. so it woudl show just a1->dword8 = false; ida already knows about the bool variable it seems
2016-10-22 12:01:42	zid	0 is already a dword though
2016-10-22 12:01:46	Guest66171	adding a falser enum might work
2016-10-22 12:02:15	Guest66171	false* but would not work for true when it is not 1
2016-10-22 12:02:32	Guest66171	yes but a1-> doword is defined as bool

2016-10-22 12:03:10	Guest66171	struct struct_a1 {   _DWORD len;   _DWORD total_len;   bool dword8;   LPVOID dwArray; };
2016-10-22 12:03:14	Guest66171	here is the struct for a1
2016-10-22 12:03:19	Guest66171	defined in ida
2016-10-22 12:04:19	zid	so change it to dword
2016-10-22 12:04:19	zid	like it should be
2016-10-22 12:04:19	zid	and then if you want to change what 0 means you can do that, but the fact of the matter is, it was compiled as a dword, regardless of the typedefs in play in the original struct
2016-10-22 12:06:39	Guest66171	oky. thx.

2016-10-23 05:35:57	Jester01	surely you can
2016-10-23 05:36:34	Jester01	you can stick the instructions into a test program, or even just do it on paper ... it's a couple of instructions, you would already be done with it
2016-10-23 05:36:42	zid	or just use windows calc
2016-10-23 05:36:59	zid	or wolfram alpha
2016-10-23 05:37:11	zid	it's just c = (a*b)%2^32
2016-10-23 05:37:16	asm272	Where can I find some information about 8051 memory location types? I'd like to know what type of memory (data, idata, sfr, xdata or code) is used when I execute an instruction
2016-10-23 05:37:20	zid	should give some solutions
2016-10-23 05:37:51	messy	thats what I was looking for thanks zid
2016-10-23 05:38:32	Jester01	that's not always the case, usually you also have some shifts
2016-10-23 05:38:52	Jester01	anyway, just do what the instructions say to do :)
2016-10-23 05:38:52	ggole	You could also compile a few C functions that divide by common divisors and see if they match
2016-10-23 05:39:05	zid	or bruteforce it
2016-10-23 05:39:09	Jester01	or google the magic number used :)

2016-10-23 10:12:11	DearVolt	Hello everyone :D I'm manipulating bitmaps using Intel x64 asm. I've managed to get other functions working, but this one is baffling me. I am basically setting a mask and then ORing every pixel. In GDB I can see the changes taking effect, but the image that is saved is the original. Anyone have any ideas? The source is at http://pastebin.com/ihaZrLtE - Particularly lines 96 - 102.

2016-10-23 10:36:19	DearVolt	@Jester01: I always feel so stupid when I ask and then spot it 15 minutes later xD
2016-10-23 10:36:33	DearVolt	May I ask a bit of a logic question? Not specifically asm related.
2016-10-23 10:37:00	Jester01	sure
2016-10-23 10:38:19	DearVolt	I'm trying to change the colour intensity of an 8-bit colour-depth bitmap. So depending on which colour I want to maximise, I set the bitmask to have that colour set to all 1s and then OR every pixel with the mask. The colours are coming out pretty funky though - The red intensity makes the image blue. Is my logic wrong?

2016-10-23 10:43:17	Jester01	in that case apply your logic to the color table instead
2016-10-23 10:43:38	DearVolt	Okay, awesome, thank you! I'll give that a try and be back in a few minutes.

2016-10-23 10:59:16	DearVolt	Funny enough, the gap between the last header entry and the pixel array is huge.
2016-10-23 10:59:51	DearVolt	So is my previous logic correct? Because the images are coming out discoloured, but definitely not the right colour intensity. I can upload examples?

2016-10-23 11:05:23	Jester01	sure
2016-10-23 11:05:46	Jester01	I understand that's how the original looks but I wanted the bmp to look at the headers and stuff

2016-10-23 11:16:21	DearVolt	Is that the wrong way to do it?
2016-10-23 11:16:51	Jester01	with a color table you can't generally know what changing the index will do
2016-10-23 11:17:15	Jester01	yes 0x3c has 0x80 not sure what you are trying to say

2016-10-23 11:18:29	DearVolt	Ah, what I meant was where did you find the number of colours in the colour table? Because where I think it should be, there are just 0s.
2016-10-23 11:19:09	DearVolt	And I swapped the bitmasks to use BBGGGRRR instead of RRRGGGBB and the intensities are now right, even though I'm masking every pixel.
2016-10-23 11:19:36	Jester01	that's accidental due to how the color table is set up

2016-10-23 20:56:05	AverageJ0e	sort of. more like making it so that way your code is called when a certain function's name or address is called
2016-10-23 20:56:36	AverageJ0e	you "hook" it by replacing the first 5 bytes of the function's prolog to perform a long jump to your own code.
2016-10-23 20:56:56	AverageJ0e	or it can be the epilog too

2016-10-23 20:58:21	AverageJ0e	an example would be to "hook" a function like strcmp() and check if one of the arguments is greater than 10, then print "cock" or something. this would be done via pin or dlsym or some hooking library
2016-10-23 21:02:29	-->	kbw (~KeyboardW@104-178-145-79.lightspeed.tukrga.sbcglobal.net) has joined ##asm
2016-10-23 21:02:47	soulisson	AverageJ0e: thank you, is modifying the IAT also a function hooking method?
2016-10-23 21:03:10	AverageJ0e	not always.
2016-10-23 21:04:24	soulisson	AverageJ0e: so if I change a function address with my function, it's not considered function hooking?
2016-10-23 21:04:44	AverageJ0e	virus writers and shellcode writers learned a long time ago that fucking with the IAT is a pain in the ass. its much easier to dynamically call the code you want via the use of loadlibary / getprocaddress on windows, or dlopen / dlsym on linux
2016-10-23 21:06:12	AverageJ0e	i'd say its borderline patching

2016-10-23 23:46:36	dminuoso_	zid: Yeah, after which I did not understand the difference from a plain uop cache.
2016-10-23 23:46:38	zid	It just caches decoded opcodes (into micro-ops) in a list somewhere as part of its speculation
2016-10-23 23:46:39	zid	there ya go
2016-10-23 23:47:53	zid	It's just a speculative version of normal ucache by the reading of it
2016-10-23 23:48:07	dminuoso_	zid: Im reading some technical details on how the trace cache works on Willamette, it seems crazily complicated.
2016-10-23 23:48:12	zid	it can be thrown away, or there can be multiple versions depending on whether a jump is actually taken or not etc

2016-10-23 23:49:52	dminuoso_	zid: Well the complicated bit comes from building those traces, so the architecture seems to have two distinct modes ("segment build mode" and "execution mode") based on what I'm reading.
2016-10-23 23:50:05	zid	well yea, it'd have to
2016-10-23 23:50:12	zid	you can't get any work done if you never execute anything
2016-10-23 23:50:17	dminuoso_	Yeah.
2016-10-23 23:50:20	zid	and you don't have trace cache if you don't build the traces
2016-10-23 23:50:34	zid	that's a hugely simple implication
2016-10-23 23:50:39	zid	why is it complicated
2016-10-23 23:51:08	dminuoso_	It seems like this could be one of the factors that made the P4 pipeline so incredibly long.

2016-10-23 23:51:25	zid	That's more like a fix
2016-10-23 23:51:34	zid	because the pipeline is so long you need crap like that to help avoid starving the cpu
2016-10-23 23:51:45	zid	decode both sides of every branch to reduce the latency of a mispredict
2016-10-23 23:51:59	dminuoso_	Mhm, with some steep penalties. Over 20 cycles penalty for a branch misprediction that turns into a trace segment build mode is hefty.
2016-10-23 23:52:16	zid	but without the trace segment available, it'd be 20 cycles in EVERY branch
2016-10-23 23:52:19	zid	that's the point of it

2016-10-23 23:56:22	dminuoso_	zid: Very interesting stuff - I guess the benefits are highest when there's lots of local hotspots such as tight loops so that the CPU can remain in execution mode for as long as possible.
2016-10-23 23:56:33	dminuoso_	(Which I guess applies to most caches)
2016-10-23 23:57:01	zid	The benefits are highest when a branch is mis-predicted but the decode of it is already cached
2016-10-23 23:57:58	dminuoso_	It seems like a plain uop cache offers the same benefits but with far less complexity.
2016-10-23 23:58:15	zid	except those are only for /one/ block
2016-10-23 23:58:28	zid	the point of a trace cache is that it could be the 6 possible blocks starting from 0xDEAD0000
2016-10-23 23:58:41	zid	and you have them ALL in cache, no matter what the actual state of execution is when you get there
2016-10-23 23:59:08	zid	because if you land there and state 4 is the real one, and you predicted only state 1 and decoded that (traditional cache) you're fucked
2016-10-23 23:59:47	zid	Okay let's go with an example,  you ready?

2016-10-24 00:03:13	zid	ready, steady, go! Answer:
2016-10-24 00:03:16	dminuoso_	It will have the uops for all instructions (which will be add/test/jnz and some call/jnz ready)
2016-10-24 00:03:20	zid	right, nothing
2016-10-24 00:03:22	dminuoso_	in its cache - hot.
2016-10-24 00:03:29	zid	so the decode cache is bored as fuck
2016-10-24 00:03:34	dminuoso_	Right.
2016-10-24 00:03:43	dminuoso_	It will have them cached after the first pass.
2016-10-24 00:03:54	zid	so why not.. make it do something, and speculatively decode a few ways in which the state could be after the loop ends?
2016-10-24 00:04:13	zid	decode the i == 0 case where some hypothetical jump is taken, and also the i != 0 case where it is
2016-10-24 00:04:22	zid	so now no matter how the loop ends, you've got everything already decoded
2016-10-24 00:04:51	zid	you could invent some type of cache to store a few of these decoded blocks
2016-10-24 00:04:57	zid	maybe give it a cool name, like trace cache
2016-10-24 00:05:02	zid	and make some patents

2016-10-24 00:05:39	dminuoso_	zid: But why would the CPU predict that the branch was taken?
2016-10-24 00:05:45	zid	dminuoso: because it's *bored*
2016-10-24 00:05:56	boru	'Stacked on-die' is redundant.
2016-10-24 00:05:57	dminuoso_	zid: What kind of branch predictor is that?
2016-10-24 00:06:02	dminuoso_	"boredom predictor" ?
2016-10-24 00:06:06	zid	we're not talking about the branch predictor
2016-10-24 00:06:29	zid	we're talking about branch premonition
2016-10-24 00:06:47	zid	Who cares if you get the prediction wrong if you've *already figured out what happens on both sides of the branch*
2016-10-24 00:07:46	zid	while(big fucking loop) trace[0] = left_side; trace[1] = right_side;  when(loop ends) OH LOOK I ALREADY HAVE BOTH SIDES FINISHED, SWEET
2016-10-24 00:07:50	dminuoso_	zid: Ahh, so in the trace segment build mode, the processor maps out possible traces and caches them - so that in execution mode it can go either way
2016-10-24 00:07:56	zid	right
2016-10-24 00:08:00	dminuoso_	all possible traces for the local code region
2016-10-24 00:08:07	zid	rather than only having the singular trace
2016-10-24 00:08:11	zid	which is what normal decode cache is
2016-10-24 00:08:14	zid	it's just parallel decode cache
2016-10-24 00:08:21	zid	and you just use the one that ended up being the right one
2016-10-24 00:08:26	dminuoso_	Right, and indexed by a "trace" rather than pure IP
2016-10-24 00:09:09	zid	in some cases though, after the loop ends, the state will be so complicated you only had enough cache to decode 4 of the 8 possible cases
2016-10-24 00:09:18	zid	if you hit one you didn't have the trace for, THAT is where your 20 cycles hits
2016-10-24 00:09:36	zid	if you only have 1 trace cache (normal decode cache) 7 of the 8 would have the 20 cycle penalty
2016-10-24 00:09:52	zid	but we reduced it to 4 by making the decode cache do stuff while it was waiting for the loop to end

2016-10-24 00:38:06	dminuoso_	zid: Well, I would have expected the "volatile" to be enough to prevent GCC from reordering it.
2016-10-24 00:38:23	dminuoso_	But the volatile just prevents GCC from optimizing the assembly away in some cases I think

2016-10-24 00:38:50	zid	GCC's optimizers sometimes discard asm statements if they determine there is no need for the output variables. Also, the optimizers may move code out of loops if they believe that the code will always return the same result (i.e. none of its input values change between calls). Using the volatile qualifier disables these optimizations. asm statements that have no output operands, including asm
2016-10-24 00:38:50	zid	goto statements, are implicitly volatile.
2016-10-24 00:39:01	zid	amazing, it's written in the manual

2016-10-24 00:39:57	dminuoso_	zid: The sad thing is, the manual even mentions this trick with fake output variables - its just super silly.
2016-10-24 00:40:05	zid	The compiler may move the addition back before the volatile asm. To make it work as expected, add an artificial dependency to the asm by referencing a variable in the subsequent code, for example:
2016-10-24 00:40:07	zid	yep
2016-10-24 00:40:11	zid	it's not silly at all
2016-10-24 00:40:17	zid	gcc *cannot look inside assembly blocks*
2016-10-24 00:40:25	zid	that's what gas does, gcc is a C compiler
2016-10-24 00:40:35	dminuoso_	I just feel that GCC should not reorder volatile assembly.

2016-10-24 03:50:31	zid	l1 is unshared, l2 is shared, roughly
2016-10-24 03:50:37	bcos	xux: Sharing is nice to ensure cache coherency
2016-10-24 03:50:44	GeDaMo	So if the main memory changes the cache has to be updated
2016-10-24 03:50:51	zid	and they push their l1 into the pooled l2, and the other cores get notified their l1 is stale, etc
2016-10-24 03:50:55	zid	it's fairly complicated
2016-10-24 03:50:56	xux	GeDaMo: oh, so it's accessing the main memory needlessly?
2016-10-24 03:51:09	GeDaMo	It's needed because the cache is out of date
2016-10-24 03:51:33	bcos	L1 might be "per core", L2 might be shared by 2 cores, L3 might be shared by all cores in the chip (but not cores in other chips)..
2016-10-24 03:51:41	GeDaMo	Ideally, you keep thread specific data on separate cache lines
2016-10-24 03:52:00	xux	this isn't a problem if you have different processes not sharing anything, right?

2016-10-24 03:53:40	bcos	..you'd want the opposite - processes that do share data running on CPUs that share cache, to maximise the benefits of sharing

2016-10-24 06:47:49	vulture	also your algorithm is incredibly insecure
2016-10-24 06:48:41	vulture	if I know the first MD5_DIGEST_SIZE bytes of your file (which is fairly easy, cuz file headers are a thing), then I can compute MD5(a^2); and from there, I can decrypt all the other bytes of your file

2016-10-24 10:37:29	vulture	toothe: function pointer (C++?)
2016-10-24 10:38:06	vulture	yeah, C++
2016-10-24 10:38:49	vulture	esi caches the 'this' object. when doing a __thiscall, you put the this object in ecx, thus the mov ecx,esi
2016-10-24 10:39:06	vulture	the first slot in an object that has a vtbl, contains the vtbl pointer
2016-10-24 10:39:12	vulture	so [esi] has that pointer
2016-10-24 10:39:21	vulture	mov eax,[esi] grabs the vtbl pointer and sticks in eax
2016-10-24 10:39:42	vulture	then [eax+38h] is whatever the 38h/4(+1?)'th virtual function is for that object
2016-10-24 10:41:57	toothe	ahh...
2016-10-24 10:42:05	toothe	so, stupid question - is there an offset to that?

2016-10-24 10:42:57	GeDaMo	Offset to what?
2016-10-24 10:43:29	toothe	meaning, 38h/4 = 14
2016-10-24 10:43:39	toothe	so, jump to the function pointer at 14? I don't get it?
2016-10-24 10:43:48	vulture	function pointer is at eax+38h
2016-10-24 10:43:49	GeDaMo	[eax+38h]
2016-10-24 10:44:01	vulture	say you have a C++ object with 4 virtual functions
2016-10-24 10:44:13	vulture	if it were e.g. [eax+8] then that's the 3rd virtual function
2016-10-24 10:44:14	toothe	im just not sure how to arrive at that...
2016-10-24 10:44:21	vulture	because 8/4+1 = 3
2016-10-24 10:44:25	vulture	first is at eax+0
2016-10-24 10:44:26	vulture	second at eax+4
2016-10-24 10:44:29	vulture	third at eax+8
2016-10-24 10:44:30	vulture	etc
2016-10-24 10:44:35	toothe	right, but what is eax....
2016-10-24 10:44:39	toothe	i don't know how to figure that out.
2016-10-24 10:44:41	vulture	[15.39.30] <vulture> mov eax,[esi] grabs the vtbl pointer and sticks in eax
2016-10-24 10:44:50	toothe	err...yes...
2016-10-24 10:45:17	toothe	i don't know what that value is though?
2016-10-24 10:45:17		[10:45]
2016-10-24 10:45:36	vulture	when you compile C++ with polymorphic objects, what happens is for every possible configuration of a polymorphic object, there is a unique vtbl (which is just an array of function pointers in memory) that lists out absolutely every virtual function
2016-10-24 10:46:01	vulture	when you instantiate a polymorphic object, you decide which vtbl you will use for that object
2016-10-24 10:46:04	toothe	makes sense.
2016-10-24 10:46:09	vulture	and put that as the first pointer in the object
2016-10-24 10:46:29	toothe	so, this is why people hate C++?
2016-10-24 10:46:47	vulture	ehh
2016-10-24 10:46:56	vulture	it's why virtual functions are slow :P
2016-10-24 10:47:05	toothe	yeah, the compiler was odd here.
2016-10-24 10:47:12	toothe	even the way it did switch cases was confusing heh
2016-10-24 10:47:12	vulture	which is why "proper" (polymorphic) C++ is slow
2016-10-24 10:47:14	toothe	took me time to figure it out.
2016-10-24 10:47:25	vulture	could be worse
2016-10-24 10:47:28	vulture	could be python
2016-10-24 10:47:33	toothe	!!!
2016-10-24 10:47:34	toothe	i love python!
2016-10-24 10:47:55	GeDaMo	It's hashtables all the way down :P
2016-10-24 10:48:15	toothe	trying to see if the vtbl value is anywhere in this code.
2016-10-24 10:48:17	toothe	ida pro 5.0
2016-10-24 10:48:23	toothe	i can't figure out how to search lol
2016-10-24 10:48:25	vulture	have you got a breakpoint?
2016-10-24 10:48:29	toothe	no.
2016-10-24 10:48:31	vulture	just set a breakpoint when it reads it

2016-10-24 10:49:11	vulture	you could search for vtbl initializers though

2016-10-24 10:49:25	vulture	and then if you go to dword_xxxxxxxx

2016-10-24 11:23:39	vulture	wow I buy AverageJ0e a drink once and now he's buying everyone else drinks
2016-10-24 11:23:49	toothe	let me step out for a bit...going to go home.
2016-10-24 11:23:56	AverageJ0e	that's right doc
2016-10-24 11:23:59	toothe	will have to conintue this. But again, I am pretty much lost at this point.
2016-10-24 11:24:07	toothe	but that's how you learn.
2016-10-24 11:24:17	vulture	doing it in a debugger helps
2016-10-24 11:24:23	vulture	because you can see actual data flowing around :P
2016-10-24 11:24:31	toothe	IdaPro 5.0 not good?
2016-10-24 11:24:56	AverageJ0e	write what you want in C first, then take the output the compiler shits out and use that with your assembler.
2016-10-24 11:25:53	vulture	I think we determined that 5.0 was from 1876
2016-10-24 11:26:03	vulture	in celebration of the centennial
2016-10-24 11:26:33	AverageJ0e	what about binary ninja? anyone use that yet?

2016-10-24 22:59:37	heelpmeplz	[03:11:16] When does IMUL set the overflow flag? [03:11:16]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	heelpmeplz	[03:11:25] MUL and IMUL [03:11:25]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	Random832	[03:13:31] http://x86.renejeschke.de/html/file_module_x86_id_138.html The CF and OF flags are set when significant bit (including the sign bit) are carried into the upper half of the result. The CF and OF flags are cleared when the result (including the sign bit) fits exactly in the lower half of the result. [03:13:31]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	Random832	[03:14:49] the key thing to remember is that multiply has a double-sized result, in edx:eax [etc] [03:14:49]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	heelpmeplz	[03:17:53] thank you [03:17:53]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	Random832	[03:18:28] but the flags are based on the regular sized result since the larger one can't overflow [03:18:28]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	heelpmeplz	[03:48:09] could movsx be considered a substitute for mov ax, myVar  ;  cwd [03:48:09]

2016-10-24 22:59:37	heelpmeplz	[04:08:08] is what I'm asking [04:08:08]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	Random832	[04:09:37] well, what is myVar, and what operands are you talking about passing to movsx [04:09:37]

2016-10-25 01:04:08	ThatDude	Hello Wizards of the ASM Lands.... I am trying to understand this line of code *(_QWORD *)&result = (unsigned __int128)_mm_or_pd(_mm_andn_pd(v10, v9), _mm_and_pd(v7, v10));
2016-10-25 01:04:17	ThatDude	ARM64 ios
2016-10-25 01:05:41	ThatDude	the v's are Floats.... I could paste the pure assembly too if that helps

2016-10-25 01:05:50	GeDaMo	I think
2016-10-25 01:06:37	ThatDude	ok , I just wonder whats the semantics of this but yeah I can use that info, thanks !
2016-10-25 01:07:18	GeDaMo	It may be v10 which is inverted in the first part instead of v9, I'm not sure
2016-10-25 01:07:24	Jester02	are you sure v10 isn't a bitmask?
2016-10-25 01:07:52	ThatDude	 v10 = _mm_cmpunord_sd(v6, v6);
2016-10-25 01:08:02	Jester02	yeah that's a mask.

2016-10-25 01:12:39	ThatDude	ok so i will use that formula u gave me
2016-10-25 01:12:41	ThatDude	thx !
2016-10-25 01:12:59	Jester02	v6 is a division
2016-10-25 01:13:12	Jester02	so that check is basically for a division by zero
2016-10-25 01:13:17	Jester02	or maybe overflow too
2016-10-25 01:14:20	ThatDude	so  the result is basicaly fmin(v6,v7)

2016-10-25 01:23:24	ThatDude	btw what IDE are u binary masters use these days ?
2016-10-25 01:23:50	Love4Boobies	Real mean use power editors, like Vim or Emacs, not silly IDEs. Those are for girls. :P

2016-10-25 01:24:16	ThatDude	:D
2016-10-25 01:24:26	ThatDude	so vim it is
2016-10-25 01:25:17	Love4Boobies	There's a learning curive but if you do a lot of editing, they are very powerful and flexible. They move most of the editing work from the user to the computer, where it belongs.

2016-10-25 07:31:46	damien	So there's a solution in a problem for my assembly that asks to use a mux for a 4 var boolean function. It asks for the smallest mux, but the solution uses a 8 to 1 mux. However, couldn't you use a 4 to one mux to do the same (and it would be a smaller mux)?

2016-10-25 07:35:58	damien	Yeah, I remember him saying that in class though, but don't see how it's the smallest mux. Maybe he means that the total sum of gates is smaller? I should count the to make sure

2016-10-25 07:42:00	vulture_	depends on what the actual question is since you didnt actually explain what the problem is (a function is not something you mux, so your explanation doesnt really make any sense)
2016-10-25 07:45:11	damien	vulture_: a mux is a universal gate (i.e. you can implement any boolean function using a mux). Basically we're making a 1-bit alu with 4 different boolean functions
2016-10-25 07:45:35	damien	which is a function in of itself
2016-10-25 07:45:36	zid	that's not what a mux is in my universe
2016-10-25 07:45:51	GeDaMo	That sounds like a 4-bit lookup table
2016-10-25 07:46:00	GeDaMo	E.g. as part of an FPGA
2016-10-25 07:46:55	vulture_	what do you mean implement a boolean function using a mux
2016-10-25 07:47:11	vulture_	why not implement a boolean function as not-a-mux
2016-10-25 07:47:17	vulture_	it would be smaller and more direct :P
2016-10-25 07:47:43	boru	Yeah, don't forget to paint that bikeshed green!
2016-10-25 07:48:01	damien	well I used the two selector bits to choose what inputs (different alu functions) to map to the output
2016-10-25 07:48:06	vulture_	if you are constrained by the rules of e.g. an fpga like GeDaMo said, then it could be a LUT
2016-10-25 07:48:20	damien	I didn't make the problem and this is the terminology use in the class
2016-10-25 07:48:22	zid	boru: but it should be red
2016-10-25 07:48:54	zid	damien: Your mistake was not taking a class that was taking place on earth
2016-10-25 07:50:16	damien	It's being taught by a math professor. So he doesn't really care about the details. Hence why it's so theoretical
2016-10-25 07:50:30	damien	and not using specific terminology
2016-10-25 07:52:25	damien	It's an intro class too and most people struggle to just grasp how to do the gate logic, so maybe he dials it down a bit too
2016-10-25 07:53:39	damien	Do you guys know of any books where I could learn how it's actually implemented in the real world?

2016-10-25 07:58:06	damien	Like I know how specific gates are contructed with cmos. How you make an FPGA would be interesting
2016-10-25 07:59:20	vulture_	everything on a high level (logic) just gets compiled down to a specific low level that is very specific to your hardware (cmos, mosfets, nands, LUTs, pick your poison)
2016-10-25 07:59:26	vulture_	fpga is typically LUTs
2016-10-25 07:59:47	vulture_	(although the LUTs are obviously implemented with something else on a lower level, you compile your high level logic down to LUTs)

2016-10-25 08:08:49	damien	Sorry connection sketched. Thing is that it's not for a concrete application. The teacher was just testing weather we knew how to do it with a mux based lookup table
2016-10-25 08:09:59	zid	[19:02] <damien> Turns out the LUT is usually implemented using a combination of a multiplexer and sram

2016-10-25 08:38:36	xux	when you try to decompose images and then reconstruct them in alternated ways, you're generally just scrambling them around. What you're doing may make sense computationally, but the end result may not make any sense to a human being, so you have to code for the human visual and not for some kind of correct information theory model.

2016-10-25 11:42:04	GeDaMo	[17:45:51] That sounds like a 4-bit lookup table [17:45:51]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	GeDaMo	[17:46:00] E.g. as part of an FPGA [17:46:00]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	vulture_	[17:46:55] what do you mean implement a boolean function using a mux [17:46:55]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	vulture_	[17:47:11] why not implement a boolean function as not-a-mux [17:47:11]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	vulture_	[17:47:17] it would be smaller and more direct :P [17:47:17]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	boru	[17:47:43] Yeah, don't forget to paint that bikeshed green! [17:47:43]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[17:48:01] well I used the two selector bits to choose what inputs (different alu functions) to map to the output [17:48:01]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	vulture_	[17:48:06] if you are constrained by the rules of e.g. an fpga like GeDaMo said, then it could be a LUT [17:48:06]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[17:48:20] I didn't make the problem and this is the terminology use in the class [17:48:20]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	zid	[17:48:22] boru: but it should be red [17:48:22]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	zid	[17:48:54] damien: Your mistake was not taking a class that was taking place on earth [17:48:54]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[17:50:16] It's being taught by a math professor. So he doesn't really care about the details. Hence why it's so theoretical [17:50:16]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[17:50:30] and not using specific terminology [17:50:30]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[17:52:25] It's an intro class too and most people struggle to just grasp how to do the gate logic, so maybe he dials it down a bit too [17:52:25]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[17:53:39] Do you guys know of any books where I could learn how it's actually implemented in the real world? [17:53:39]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	GeDaMo	[17:54:35] How what is implemented? [17:54:35]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	vulture_	[17:54:57] what, like NAND CMOS ? :P [17:54:57]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[17:56:42] I guess just Computer Architecture in general [17:56:42]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[17:58:06] Like I know how specific gates are contructed with cmos. How you make an FPGA would be interesting [17:58:06]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	vulture_	[17:59:20] everything on a high level (logic) just gets compiled down to a specific low level that is very specific to your hardware (cmos, mosfets, nands, LUTs, pick your poison) [17:59:20]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	vulture_	[17:59:26] fpga is typically LUTs [17:59:26]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	vulture_	[17:59:47] (although the LUTs are obviously implemented with something else on a lower level, you compile your high level logic down to LUTs) [17:59:47]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[18:02:48] Turns out the LUT is usually implemented using a combination of a multiplexer and sram [18:02:48]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[18:03:10] according to electronics.stackexchange [18:03:10]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	zid	[18:03:30] the lut in /what/ though [18:03:30]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	zid	[18:03:36] multiple people asked you what the context is [18:03:36]

2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[18:10:15] I meant some LUTs [18:10:15]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	zid	[18:10:21] right, what type [18:10:21]

2016-10-25 11:42:04	vulture_	[18:10:42] correct [18:10:42]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[18:11:16] The question addressed LUT in FPGA [18:11:16]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	xux	[18:38:36] when you try to decompose images and then reconstruct them in alternated ways, you're generally just scrambling them around. What you're doing may make sense computationally, but the end result may not make any sense to a human being, so you have to code for the human visual and not for some kind of correct information theory model.

2016-10-25 11:47:14	GeDaMo	[17:45:51] That sounds like a 4-bit lookup table [17:45:51]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	GeDaMo	[17:46:00] E.g. as part of an FPGA [17:46:00]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	vulture_	[17:46:55] what do you mean implement a boolean function using a mux [17:46:55]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	vulture_	[17:47:11] why not implement a boolean function as not-a-mux [17:47:11]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	vulture_	[17:47:17] it would be smaller and more direct :P [17:47:17]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	boru	[17:47:43] Yeah, don't forget to paint that bikeshed green! [17:47:43]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	damien	[17:48:01] well I used the two selector bits to choose what inputs (different alu functions) to map to the output [17:48:01]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	vulture_	[17:48:06] if you are constrained by the rules of e.g. an fpga like GeDaMo said, then it could be a LUT [17:48:06]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	damien	[17:48:20] I didn't make the problem and this is the terminology use in the class [17:48:20]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	zid	[17:48:22] boru: but it should be red [17:48:22]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	zid	[17:48:54] damien: Your mistake was not taking a class that was taking place on earth [17:48:54]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	damien	[17:50:16] It's being taught by a math professor. So he doesn't really care about the details. Hence why it's so theoretical [17:50:16]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	damien	[17:50:30] and not using specific terminology [17:50:30]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	damien	[17:52:25] It's an intro class too and most people struggle to just grasp how to do the gate logic, so maybe he dials it down a bit too [17:52:25]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	damien	[17:53:39] Do you guys know of any books where I could learn how it's actually implemented in the real world? [17:53:39]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	GeDaMo	[17:54:35] How what is implemented? [17:54:35]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	vulture_	[17:54:57] what, like NAND CMOS ? :P [17:54:57]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	damien	[17:56:42] I guess just Computer Architecture in general [17:56:42]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	damien	[17:58:06] Like I know how specific gates are contructed with cmos. How you make an FPGA would be interesting [17:58:06]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	vulture_	[17:59:20] everything on a high level (logic) just gets compiled down to a specific low level that is very specific to your hardware (cmos, mosfets, nands, LUTs, pick your poison) [17:59:20]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	vulture_	[17:59:26] fpga is typically LUTs [17:59:26]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	vulture_	[17:59:47] (although the LUTs are obviously implemented with something else on a lower level, you compile your high level logic down to LUTs) [17:59:47]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	damien	[18:02:48] Turns out the LUT is usually implemented using a combination of a multiplexer and sram [18:02:48]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	damien	[18:03:10] according to electronics.stackexchange [18:03:10]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	zid	[18:03:30] the lut in /what/ though [18:03:30]

2016-10-25 13:49:43	GeDaMo	[17:45:51] That sounds like a 4-bit lookup table [17:45:51]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	GeDaMo	[17:46:00] E.g. as part of an FPGA [17:46:00]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	vulture_	[17:46:55] what do you mean implement a boolean function using a mux [17:46:55]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	vulture_	[17:47:11] why not implement a boolean function as not-a-mux [17:47:11]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	vulture_	[17:47:17] it would be smaller and more direct :P [17:47:17]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	boru	[17:47:43] Yeah, don't forget to paint that bikeshed green! [17:47:43]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[17:48:01] well I used the two selector bits to choose what inputs (different alu functions) to map to the output [17:48:01]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	vulture_	[17:48:06] if you are constrained by the rules of e.g. an fpga like GeDaMo said, then it could be a LUT [17:48:06]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[17:48:20] I didn't make the problem and this is the terminology use in the class [17:48:20]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[17:48:22] boru: but it should be red [17:48:22]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[17:48:54] damien: Your mistake was not taking a class that was taking place on earth [17:48:54]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[17:50:16] It's being taught by a math professor. So he doesn't really care about the details. Hence why it's so theoretical [17:50:16]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[17:50:30] and not using specific terminology [17:50:30]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[17:52:25] It's an intro class too and most people struggle to just grasp how to do the gate logic, so maybe he dials it down a bit too [17:52:25]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[17:53:39] Do you guys know of any books where I could learn how it's actually implemented in the real world? [17:53:39]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	GeDaMo	[17:54:35] How what is implemented? [17:54:35]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	vulture_	[17:54:57] what, like NAND CMOS ? :P [17:54:57]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[17:56:42] I guess just Computer Architecture in general [17:56:42]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[17:58:06] Like I know how specific gates are contructed with cmos. How you make an FPGA would be interesting [17:58:06]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	vulture_	[17:59:20] everything on a high level (logic) just gets compiled down to a specific low level that is very specific to your hardware (cmos, mosfets, nands, LUTs, pick your poison) [17:59:20]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	vulture_	[17:59:26] fpga is typically LUTs [17:59:26]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	vulture_	[17:59:47] (although the LUTs are obviously implemented with something else on a lower level, you compile your high level logic down to LUTs) [17:59:47]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[18:02:48] Turns out the LUT is usually implemented using a combination of a multiplexer and sram [18:02:48]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[18:03:10] according to electronics.stackexchange [18:03:10]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:03:30] the lut in /what/ though [18:03:30]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:03:36] multiple people asked you what the context is [18:03:36]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:03:45] cus in cmos and ttl and stuff you'd just use regular gates [18:03:45]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:03:47] not a muxer and sram [18:03:47]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[18:08:49] Sorry connection sketched. Thing is that it's not for a concrete application. The teacher was just testing weather we knew how to do it with a mux based lookup table [18:08:49]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:09:59] [19:02] <damien> Turns out the LUT is usually implemented using a combination of a multiplexer and sram [18:09:59]

2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[18:10:15] I meant some LUTs [18:10:15]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:10:21] right, what type [18:10:21]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:10:23] what situation [18:10:23]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:10:35] someone obviously had one in mind when they answered on stack overflow [18:10:35]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:10:40] this is like pulling teeth [18:10:40]

2016-10-25 13:49:43	vulture_	[18:10:42] correct [18:10:42]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[18:11:16] The question addressed LUT in FPGA [18:11:16]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	xux	[18:38:36] when you try to decompose images and then reconstruct them in alternated ways, you're generally just scrambling them around. What you're doing may make sense computationally, but the end result may not make any sense to a human being, so you have to code for the human visual and not for some kind of correct information theory model. [18:38:36]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:40:01] take your meds [18:40:01]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	ararob	[18:40:48] lol [18:40:48]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	boru	[18:41:02] Is that a fact bot? [18:41:02]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	GeDaMo	[18:41:18] Probably a misfenestration [18:41:18]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	boru	[18:41:33] Quite. [18:41:33]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	Jester02	[18:41:54] lol [18:41:54]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:42:12] looks like some intro to jpeg [18:42:12]

2016-10-25 16:43:04	hackal	MIPS
2016-10-25 16:43:23	hackal	Is MIPS an architecture?
2016-10-25 16:44:55	Random832	i'd say try it - immediate operands are 16 bits, so it'll get zero-extended, but the real question is whether the assembler accepts character literals
2016-10-25 16:45:07	hackal	I am having hard time figuring out how to get words out of string. I can loop byte by byte of the string but not sure what to do next. I am trying to figure out the delimiters of the words.

2016-10-25 16:50:51	hackal	I am not sure I can "help" with the architecture. I am just learning using MIPS and MARS editor
2016-10-25 16:51:36	Random832	also is this required to be a full subroutine, rather than just a section of your other function and you jump where you need to be in the other function if there is / is not a delimiter?
2016-10-25 16:53:23	Random832	i'd probably at least make it a "find next delimiter" subroutine
2016-10-25 16:53:23		[16:53]
2016-10-25 16:53:24	hackal	It doesn't need to be subroutine

2016-10-25 16:57:15	Random832	anyway you're doing a lot of comparisons in each loop, it might be worthwhile to explore if there's better performance if you can check if bit 0x40 [which is set for all letters, and clear for all delimiters other than _] is clear

2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[02:51:36] also is this required to be a full subroutine, rather than just a section of your other function and you jump where you need to be in the other function if there is / is not a delimiter? [02:51:36]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[02:53:23] i'd probably at least make it a "find next delimiter" subroutine [02:53:23]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	hackal	[02:53:24] It doesn't need to be subroutine [02:53:24]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[02:57:15] anyway you're doing a lot of comparisons in each loop, it might be worthwhile to explore if there's better performance if you can check if bit 0x40 [which is set for all letters, and clear for all delimiters other than _] is clear [02:57:15]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[02:58:09] or use a bitmap [02:58:09]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	hackal	[03:01:01] I am basically translating this https://gist.github.com/hackal/6a05e5cfffaccc41f44b84a2cb329082 C program to MIPS [03:01:01]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	hackal	[03:02:28] unfortunate is I do not undestand everything in the C code, however I know what it is supposed to do [03:02:28]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:02:29] ok if this is for an assignment probably don't get too fancy [03:02:29]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:03:38] i'd probably use li to set $v1 but otherwise that looks like a reasonable translation of the is_delimiting_char subroutine [03:03:38]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	hackal	[03:04:25] Also, is '\n' considered as a byte? [03:04:25]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:05:13] yes [03:05:13]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	hackal	[03:05:49] And I was thinking if there is a way to "instantiate" a empty string and appending it. Not really sure how to that. [03:05:49]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:09:43] doing it dynamically is probably a bit advanced for your course level - the C code they gave you just creates a static array. you just need to create a zero-initialized area of the appropriate bytes, which i don't know the syntax in your assembler to do it but you probably learned it in class [03:09:43]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:15:29] looks like you want "input_sentence: .space 1001" and "word: .space 51" [03:15:29]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:15:39] in the .data section [03:15:39]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	hackal	[03:16:32] this is my current code https://gist.github.com/hackal/e193a0a0049470d144010a6b42869ae1 but its garbage at the moment. I am rewriting it. [03:16:32]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	hackal	[03:17:02] However I am not sure how to store the single bytes in a word defined in .data [03:17:02]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:18:15] load the address into a register, then use sb [03:18:15]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:22:28] or the index [03:22:28]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:23:56] i.e. you can use sb $AA, word($BB) to store byte $AA in index $BB of the word array, so you need both the byte and the index in registers [03:23:56]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:24:51] or just put the address itself in register $BB and use ($BB) alone [03:24:51]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:24:55] hackal: ^ [03:24:55]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	hackal	[03:25:56] I see, so does this "word: .space 51" instantiates an array of unknown length but with fixed length for each element? [03:25:56]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:31:58] no [03:31:58]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:32:14] it "instantiates" 51 bytes. [03:32:14]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:33:12] used in this context for an array of 51 one-byte elements [and with an odd size, an odd size preceding it, and no align statement, not useful for much else] [03:33:12]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	hackal	[03:34:25] Random832: thanks for help and advice, you helped me alot. I need to go now. [03:34:25]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:34:56] ok [03:34:56]
