2016-10-17 20:37:49	Freze	The only problem is I'm working on implementing elementary math functions, so I can't sterilize the input

2016-10-17 20:39:01	Freze	the second approach being leave them till the end of the code
2016-10-17 20:39:13	vulture	if you're expecting exceptions then you should probably exit as early as possible (performing ops on exception values is often *incredibly* slow)

2016-10-17 21:03:33	Freze	[06:59:40] vulture, for the main computational loop why would it matter ? Branch and exit for the exceptional cases early, and then do the computational loop (which will take advantage of simd). For scalar inputs that is. [06:59:40]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:00:00] simd prefers determinism [07:00:00]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:00:14] you cant branch one 'data' but not another [07:00:14]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:00:30] but you can do masks and conditional moves and such [07:00:30]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:00:46] rather, you dont use control constructs to branch 'data' :P [07:00:46]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:01:48] some platforms (e.g. cuda) provide a bit to enable or disable instruction writeback for individual data parts of a simd operation [07:01:48]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:01:53] many dont [07:01:53]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:02:04] and require you to manually use masks etc [07:02:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	vulture	[07:02:33] in both cases, though, code divergence is a big impact on SIMD performance [07:02:33]
2016-10-17 21:03:33	Freze	[07:03:19] For vector inputs, (i.e. sin(x) of  a vector x) I see the advantage of first making sure your input contains no excpetional cases and then plowing through the a branchless version for the computations [07:03:19]

2016-10-17 21:04:15	Freze	For scalar inputs, the branch versions win in terms of speed

2016-10-17 21:04:50	vulture	also, dealing with exceptions is pretty useless in floating point code
2016-10-17 21:04:58	vulture	if you're hitting exceptions, you've already completely failed
2016-10-17 21:05:13	vulture	I understand this is general library code but general libraries are awful too :P~
2016-10-17 21:05:44	Freze	I agree, but people will hang me if I don't deal with them "correctly"
2016-10-17 21:06:00	Freze	It's a pain, esp. subnormals
2016-10-17 21:06:15	zid	x86 has a flag to force subnormals to 0 doesn't it
2016-10-17 21:06:35	zid	it speeds up code that deals with them in exhcange for slowing down the rest slightly or something?
2016-10-17 21:06:47	boru	Probably. CISCs tend to have instructions for making toast.
2016-10-17 21:06:54	zid	mmmm toast

2016-10-17 21:07:23	vulture	Doing floating-point math with the x87 FPU on NaNs or infinities numbers caused a 900 times slowdown on Pentium 4 processors
2016-10-17 21:07:23	vulture	Core 2 processors the worst-case I have measured is a 175 times slowdown, on SSE addition and multiplication
2016-10-17 21:08:23	vulture	which is why, especially if you're doing scalar functions, you should do early exits
2016-10-17 21:08:49	vulture	otoh, you shouldnt have any exception values in the first place or you're a bad person, and it will only be slow if you've already broken it
2016-10-17 21:09:04	Freze	Ok thanks,
2016-10-17 21:10:28	vulture	in any case, the context and implementation details were very important for choosing one or the other :P
2016-10-17 21:10:55	Freze	Right. My conclusions are that for vectors of large size one would need a custom code anyways for max perf.
2016-10-17 21:11:45	Freze	For scalars best to stick with branches and early exits
2016-10-17 21:11:53	Freze	as conventional mlibs
2016-10-17 21:12:37	Freze	In any case, I wont' probably get to the vector implementations for a while
2016-10-17 21:13:13	bcos_	Erm. Using "Ye Olde FPU" is probably faster than everything you've got there..
2016-10-17 21:14:20	bcos_	..and more precise (80-bit if you're in the mood for that)
2016-10-17 21:14:41	Freze	(For the vector stuff my current thinking is that I'll need to adapt the scalar code by trying to eliminate as many branches, checking inputs for NaN/Infs first, then hitting up the main computational loops)
2016-10-17 21:14:44	zid	I'd have just done fexp and been done with it
2016-10-17 21:15:34	Freze	zid, ?

2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:50:06] what you're describing is a process [08:50:06]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:50:07] :P [08:50:07]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	bcos_	[08:51:04]  If you want, you can think of it as "processes that share half their virtual address space" [08:51:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:51:16] aka processes [08:51:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:51:21] with shared memory [08:51:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	bcos_	[08:52:05] Sort of "processes with shared memory, that share things like file handles, permissions, etc too" [08:52:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:52:43] processes can share handles [08:52:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	zid	[08:52:45] bcos_: again, that is already how fork works [08:52:45]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	bcos_	[08:52:48] ..but much easier to think of it as "threads that belong to the same process (that have thread specific storage)" [08:52:48]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	bcos_	[08:53:08] "fork()" is for deluded *nix wannabees [08:53:08]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	zid	[08:53:27] why are you implementing fork then [08:53:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	bcos_	[08:53:29] ..and no; it's not how fork works [08:53:29]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	zid	[08:53:34] yea, that's exactly how fork works [08:53:34]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:53:50] windows allows you to spawn a process inheriting handles of the parent as well [08:53:50]

2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:56:12] well, you're the one coming up with a new term that sounds almost verbally identical to an existing term which is well defined, and then declaring an opposite definition which already exists as a completely different name :P [08:56:12]

2016-10-18 00:14:19	zid	[08:58:55] bcos_: how is shared data and unshared data different from shared data and unshared data. [08:58:55]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[08:58:56] the distinction of threads within a process is that resources are shared. other than that, processes dont even get 'scheduled' on windows, only threads do [08:58:56]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[09:00:25] you can set ACL's on thread security descriptors but afaik you cant map thread-private memory within the same process. to exclude memory you need to use an OS construct that is a non-shared environment by default which is a process [09:00:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	vulture	[09:00:46] consequently, this is why chrome spawns 235987235 processes [09:00:46]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	zid	[09:01:15] The only difference between two processes with shared memory and your thing will be the api calls made to achieve it, the result will be identical [09:01:15]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	boru	[09:01:24] They're resorted to ad hominems; probably no point continuing the discussion. [09:01:24]

2016-10-18 01:09:52	asla	not sure what packing method is used
2016-10-18 01:09:54	ryonaloli	i mean you could even just unpack it in memory to patch it
2016-10-18 01:10:00	asla	seems proprietary
2016-10-18 01:10:02	ryonaloli	well that's not a difficult problem
2016-10-18 01:10:19	ryonaloli	then it's probably based on something existing
2016-10-18 01:10:27	OxFEEDBACC	unpacking is likely one of the first function that program executes...
2016-10-18 01:10:30	Coldseeker	indeed, you -- by definition --have a copy of the unpacker.

2016-10-18 06:58:42	Jester01	and a global is not usable because?
2016-10-18 06:59:27	OxFEEDBACC	1) because i don't know the connection descriptor beforehand, 2) that wouldn't properly work with multiple connections...
2016-10-18 06:59:54	Jester01	sure would, just make a table.

2016-10-18 07:00:29	Jester01	and you will eventually need to know that descriptor before calling the poll_for_event so just fill it in then
2016-10-18 07:00:29	OxFEEDBACC	and which index do i chose? just the file descriptor?
2016-10-18 07:00:40	Jester01	yeah look up by fd
2016-10-18 07:00:55	OxFEEDBACC	well, it's improbable that i have a couple hundred connections at the same time, but...
2016-10-18 07:01:16	Jester01	and even if you do, a couple of hundred bytes is not much :)

2016-10-18 07:02:44	Jester01	note that even with your approach you'd have to store the descriptor so the memory requirement is there.
2016-10-18 07:03:28	OxFEEDBACC	but i don't need a (possibly sparse) array...
2016-10-18 07:03:44	OxFEEDBACC	sure, 100 mallocs have some overhead as well... well...
2016-10-18 07:04:07	OxFEEDBACC	well, did i tell you that i'm just about to invent a new malloc? :-D (not seriously)

2016-10-18 07:19:10	Jester01	anyway, doesn't xcb give you a fd-to-connection function?

2016-10-18 09:20:24	oeao	in the usual 64-bit Linux ABI (System V), is it ok to call a function that returns a 64-bit integer by calling it as if it returned nothing, and ignoring the return in the RAX register?

2016-10-18 09:25:16	Freze	I was auditing base library and this is how the check for Infs vs. my  implementation : http://pastebin.com/L730KHj4
2016-10-18 09:25:36	GeDaMo	RAX always contains a value, if you don't care about it, you can always overwrite it
2016-10-18 09:25:42	Freze	How can I audit performance : should I use IACA ?
2016-10-18 09:25:59	vulture	write a benchmark
2016-10-18 09:26:00	Freze	benchmarking is kinda useless since these are in the nanosecond range
2016-10-18 09:26:10	Freze	so I basically get that they are the same speed

2016-10-18 09:29:50	hawes	so looking at the references real fast
2016-10-18 09:31:20	hawes	I am looking at the flags. The SF flag was 0 and the of flag was also 0 and when I hit the

2016-10-18 09:31:20	hawes	jl      <random place to jump to>  // At this place the of and sf flags were still zero
2016-10-18 09:31:20	hawes	So since those flags were still zero we just didnt jump however if the sf flag was 1 we should of then jumped correct?

2016-10-18 10:10:20	hawes	So Since eax is zero and it's doing test eax,eax  it does a bitwise and operation and 0,0 is 0 so then the ZF flag is set to ZF=1 and then it hits the jl and since jl in this case
2016-10-18 10:10:20	hawes	as you said with the
2016-10-18 10:10:20	hawes	if(eax < 0) goto lable
2016-10-18 10:10:20	hawes	that will be false and not run since eax,eax cant be less then it's self?
2016-10-18 10:12:07	GeDaMo	jl jumps if SF != OF
2016-10-18 10:12:23	GeDaMo	ZF is irrelevant
2016-10-18 10:12:41	hawes	how ever if we had eax = 0 and esi = 12

2016-10-18 10:12:41	hawes	jl      <some random address>
2016-10-18 10:12:41	hawes	as you all stated it will perform a bitwise and operation and it will again be 0 so the ZF flag is set to ZF=1 and since eax is in fact less then esi it will jmp?
2016-10-18 10:12:43	hawes	ohhh
2016-10-18 10:13:40	GeDaMo	SF will be 1 if the most significant bit is set i.e. the value is negative
2016-10-18 10:14:58	hawes	I gotcha now GeDaMo =)
2016-10-18 10:19:21	GeDaMo	And test will set OF to 0

2016-10-18 13:52:19	heelpmeplz	I have an assignment where I receive a start and end time as user input, for example 2:30pm would be input as "1430".  I'm supposed to subtract one time from another and then display the hour and minute.  It seems the easiest way to do this is to divide by 100, with the quotient being the hour and the remainder being the minutes.  However, we are instructed to do this using a constant that represents the number of minutes in an
2016-10-18 13:52:19	heelpmeplz	hour.  I don't see where this could come into play in the calculation.  Maybe this isn't exactly an ASM question, but does anyone have any ideas?
2016-10-18 13:54:24	Jester01	I guess you have text input, so convert the first two digits into number, multiply by your constant (60) then convert the next two digits and add it
2016-10-18 13:54:24		[13:54]
2016-10-18 13:55:51	Jester01	repeat for the other input, do the subtraction, then do a division by your constant and print the quotient and the remainder
2016-10-18 13:56:29	heelpmeplz	that makes as much sense as anything, I suppose
2016-10-18 13:57:17	toothe	This file must be statically linked, I can't seem to get anything to freeze on ReadFile or ReadFileEx

2016-10-18 14:00:18	toothe	Doesn't stop at NtReadFile.
2016-10-18 14:01:25	toothe	hm...so, there's no import of CreateFile or ReadFile.
2016-10-18 14:01:44	toothe	Is there a way to say "Break if this data is utilized" ?

2016-10-18 14:02:14	vulture	you could try breakpointing DeviceIoControl as well, that's less likely than ReadFile but who knows
2016-10-18 14:02:34	vulture	also you could try running procmon and filter that process

2016-10-18 19:16:37		[19:16]
2016-10-18 19:16:50	harrisi	it's part of a quiz question
2016-10-18 19:17:08	harrisi	the full quiz question is many more instructions, and the question has nothing to do with those three, really.
2016-10-18 19:17:21	harrisi	I just found those three lines odd.
2016-10-18 19:17:58	OxFEEDBACC	maybe the question _has_ to do with it, and it's just hard to see...
2016-10-18 19:18:44	harrisi	possibly. I think I can get the answer without knowing exactly what those three movs do, though.
2016-10-18 19:19:06	OxFEEDBACC	okay...
2016-10-18 19:20:18	harrisi	they're like part of the "preamble" (pushing %ebp, storing %esp in %ebp, etc.) and the question is more about understanding whether this function (30 instructions) does one of four things (summing arguments, product of arguments, etc.)
2016-10-18 19:21:05	harrisi	but! I fully respect not wanting to give answers to a student taking a quiz, so I'll work on it alone. :)

2016-10-18 23:55:20	vulture	[00:35:33] in the modules list [00:35:33]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	vulture	[00:35:44] right click on the modules you see in your stack trace, and click load debug symbols [00:35:44]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	vulture	[00:36:00] toothe: ^ [00:36:00]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	vulture	[00:36:43] I dont know how you've disabled default symbol loading, but maybe that's something ida changed to speed up load times where my config file is from and older time where they didnt do that [00:36:43]

2016-10-18 23:55:20	xtra_	[04:15:58] but are x's given because the variables are placed under the code [04:15:58]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	xtra_	[04:16:10] rather than should be placed before the code [04:16:10]

2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[04:51:42] what would the purpose of those instructions one after another be? [04:51:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[04:52:14] doesn't it just zero out %eax and 0xfffffff4(%ebp)? I don't get the use for the third mov. [04:52:14]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	OxFEEDBACC	[05:16:37] harrisi: where did you find it? [05:16:37]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[05:16:50] it's part of a quiz question [05:16:50]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[05:17:08] the full quiz question is many more instructions, and the question has nothing to do with those three, really. [05:17:08]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[05:17:21] I just found those three lines odd. [05:17:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	OxFEEDBACC	[05:17:58] maybe the question _has_ to do with it, and it's just hard to see... [05:17:58]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[05:18:44] possibly. I think I can get the answer without knowing exactly what those three movs do, though. [05:18:44]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	OxFEEDBACC	[05:19:06] okay... [05:19:06]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[05:20:18] they're like part of the "preamble" (pushing %ebp, storing %esp in %ebp, etc.) and the question is more about understanding whether this function (30 instructions) does one of four things (summing arguments, product of arguments, etc.) [05:20:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[05:21:05] but! I fully respect not wanting to give answers to a student taking a quiz, so I'll work on it alone. :) [05:21:05]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[05:35:21] okay, I know this is a quiz, but this is certainly not right.. mov %eax,(%esp,1) [05:35:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[05:35:46] that's not valid, right? [05:35:46]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	OxFEEDBACC	[05:37:33] translates to | 67 89 04 24 | --- | mov %eax,(%esp) | [05:37:33]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	harrisi	[05:37:55] hm.. okay. thanks. [05:37:55]

2016-10-19 03:17:40	OxFEEDBACC	x87, iirc, has a subnormals-to-zero mode too, but when the ABI specifies a defined state on each function entry, a compiler can rely on that... (not that the defined state is guaranteed to be active, depending on 3rd party code that you may interoperate with)

2016-10-19 10:15:32	zid	and for some reason you're failing to understand it
2016-10-19 10:15:40	zid	it's all very clearly written
2016-10-19 10:17:35	xtra_	so the value of AGE is $50, LAST1 is 2, save is c008, array is c000, weight is c003, entry is c00F

2016-10-19 10:19:26	xtra_	...
2016-10-19 10:19:27	zid	what's the address of the bra Entry
2016-10-19 10:19:48	xtra_	its eitehr
2016-10-19 10:19:50	xtra_	c00f or c000
2016-10-19 10:19:56	zid	well the latter is wrong as shit
2016-10-19 10:20:07	zid	because as we agreed, C000 is ldx #array
2016-10-19 10:20:16	zid	and C000 + F is C00F, not C000
2016-10-19 10:20:34	zid	So considering C00F is the bra Entry, can anything else be at C00F?
2016-10-19 10:20:34	xtra_	ok

2016-10-19 10:22:37	xtra_	ahh

2016-10-19 10:24:00	xtra_	so age is right, last1 is right
2016-10-19 10:24:02	xtra_	and entry is right
2016-10-19 10:24:09	GeDaMo	No, Entry is wrong

2016-10-19 10:38:58	GeDaMo	weight is a label which is translated to an address, $C0 is the value stored at that address
2016-10-19 10:39:06	zid	do you want to know where the array is, or do I want you to know the value of the first of the 40 billion bytes?
2016-10-19 10:39:36	xtra_	te array
2016-10-19 10:39:40	xtra_	ok gedamo
2016-10-19 10:39:46	xtra_	in that case
2016-10-19 10:40:02	xtra_	the answer is $C0
2016-10-19 10:40:12	GeDaMo	The answer to what?
2016-10-19 10:40:18	xtra_	the question
2016-10-19 10:40:26	zid	xtra_: weight being on Const isn't actually practical, but array being in it is
2016-10-19 10:40:27	xtra_	it says find the value of "weight"
2016-10-19 10:40:32	GeDaMo	The question is looking for the value of the symbols
2016-10-19 10:40:35	zid	weight could easily be an equ instead
2016-10-19 10:40:43	zid	but it isn't
2016-10-19 10:40:50	xtra_	oh
2016-10-19 10:40:52	xtra_	there we go zid
2016-10-19 10:40:56	xtra_	so if it isnt equ
2016-10-19 10:41:02	xtra_	u need to show the array

2016-10-19 10:45:34	xtra_	err yeah
2016-10-19 10:45:35	GeDaMo	Yeah, array should be C011

2016-10-19 10:46:53	zid	I will check your answers
2016-10-19 10:47:00	xtra_	but what summed it all up is that if it is not EQU, then the value is the addres

Could anyone point me in the right direction? Ive tried movw movb movl movq and get the same results with all… I’m guessing
2016-10-19 16:26:20	protoCall7	did something wrong in the input template?  I asked in ##C and was directed towards this channel (even though I kind of believe this to be a C issue, not necessarily an ASM issue)

Could anyone point me in the right direction? Ive tried movw movb movl movq and get the same results with all… I’m guessing [02:26:20]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	protoCall7	[02:26:20] did something wrong in the input template?  I asked in ##C and was directed towards this channel (even though I kind of believe this to be a C issue, not necessarily an ASM issue) [02:26:20]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	protoCall7	[02:37:38] Thanks to anyone who would have looked, I figured out what I was doing wrong (didn’t need to movq %0 because the input operand was already stuffing %0 into %rdi for me) [02:37:38]

2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:14:08] The part that facilitates pre-executing instructions in paralell & such [07:14:08]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:15:01] dansan: At any rate: Modern operating systems do all their context switches in software entirely because its faster, easier to do and more flexible. [07:15:01]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:15:33] makes perfect sense. But the CPUs all still ship with support for these features that nobody uses so that they keep their transistor count high? :) [07:15:33]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:15:54] dminuoso_: Thanks for the info btw! :) [07:15:54]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:15:54] dansan: x86 has a long standing tradition of always keeping downwards compatible. [07:15:54]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:16:05] yeah, I know [07:16:05]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:16:10] dansan: This is to ensure regardless of what bizarre mechanism you use, a chip upgrade will still run your software. [07:16:10]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:16:18] That has upsides and downsides of course [07:16:18]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:16:24] dansan: Look at the A20 gate for example. Intel didn't remove that silly hack for 30 (!) years. [07:16:24]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:16:49] Forcing all bootloader and bare metal developers to access keyboard controllers and other strange parts to enable half the memory during boot. [07:16:49]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:17:02] lol!! [07:17:02]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:17:56] All because there was some developers that relied on memory wraparound from the 8086/8088 days [07:17:56]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:18:00] Which is super crazy enough. [07:18:00]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:18:03] omg! [07:18:03]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:18:25] So yeah, x86 doesn't just remove features. ;-) [07:18:25]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:18:57] I can understand that from a business/marketing standpoint [07:18:57]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:19:25] You set your customer's expectations and don't let them down [07:19:25]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:19:30] dansan: With things such as the A20 aside, a modern Core i7 processor will still run 40 year old software that ran on the 8086. [07:19:30]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:19:39] For good or worse. [07:19:39]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:20:36] Maybe we'll get to the point where virtualization will give them more room to really remove old stuff. [07:20:36]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:20:48] Virtualization has nothing to do with this. [07:20:48]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:20:52] Because if you really need it then you can emulate it [07:20:52]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:20:58] Virtualization is not emulation. [07:20:58]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:21:02] This is a very important distinction. [07:21:02]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:21:08] Yes, good point [07:21:08]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:21:24] Emulation is a very cost intensive process. Virtualization with some hardware support comes with little to no penalty at all. [07:21:24]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[07:21:40] And virtualization does not change the underlying hardware characteristics either [07:21:40]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:21:45] But, I mean that feature where you can emulate execution and if the guest happens to be also x86 then it executes all instructions that it can nativly (iiuc) [07:21:45]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:22:06] Well crap, then I'm probably using the wrong word [07:22:06]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dansan	[07:26:08] wb! [07:26:08]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso1	[07:46:02] wtf is this. [07:46:02]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso1	[07:46:33] GAS is so strange. [07:46:33]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	Coldseeker	[07:46:49] dminuoso1: you've got a numeral stuck to you name. [07:46:49]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso1	[07:48:19] Coldseeker: I know. I set up this ZNC a while ago, but keep forgetting that my work laptop does not have my perosnal 1password - so Im stuck having both dminuoso and dminuoso1 / dminuoso_ around. :| [07:48:19]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	archivist	[07:48:23] GAS is strange because it is a one size fits all assembler [07:48:23]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso1	[07:48:46] archivist: It's intel syntax is almost entirely, but not quite, unlike intel. [07:48:46]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[08:45:25] Is there a way to dynamically create a label in a macro? [08:45:25]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[08:45:37] (In GAS) [08:45:37]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[08:46:39] I basically want to do something along the lines of: .macro isr vector; isr_\vector\: .endm [08:46:39]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[08:47:09] Or do I really have to write out the 50 ISRs I intend to use? :( [08:47:09]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	vulture	[08:52:21] dminuoso: use the C preprocessor ? [08:52:21]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[08:57:33] vulture: Ohh, I think I figured it out: https://gist.github.com/dminuoso/6e917966e38c660509ee294172b7574f [08:57:33]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	dminuoso_	[08:57:52] (I think I have a few too many \() in there, but meh. [08:57:52]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	enso	[10:20:22] (more about gates than assembly) when you can use an 8-1 mux or an 4-1 mux to do the same task, is there an advantage of picking one over the other? [10:20:22]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	zid	[10:21:06] one is smaller? [10:21:06]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	archivist	[10:21:27] one probably has two in the box [10:21:27]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	zid	[10:21:43] I'd say one has 5 more pins than the other [10:21:43]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	archivist	[10:21:44] use the right tool for the job [10:21:44]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	enso	[10:24:06] yeah, but in order to use the 4-1 mux, you need to map the boolean functions to the input, whereas for the other one you can just map one input and maybe a few 1 or 0s [10:24:06]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	enso	[10:25:06] I see arguments in both favors, I just don't know which is best [10:25:06]

2016-10-20 00:55:47	dminuoso_	Im just majorly amazed how GCC re-orders volatile assembly. It even moves volatile inline assembly across control flow (say jumps) at times - there is no way to simply say "this assembly must happen right there".
2016-10-20 00:55:57	dminuoso_	So yeah, I get how you feel if your tools decide to optimize.
2016-10-20 00:59:19	GeDaMo	Optimizers aren't intelligent, sometimes they get things wrong; the assembler is where you get to say "do exactly what I tell you"
2016-10-20 01:01:27	dminuoso_	GeDaMo: The issue is just if your assembly has side effects for the code that follows, then you need to unpack your trick bag und use fake variables, add fake dependencies just so GCC does not move the volatile assembly around however it pleases.
2016-10-20 01:01:40	dminuoso_	So inline assembly is "do exactly what I tell you when you feel like it"

2016-10-20 22:15:31	boru	Seems reasonable that the data is loaded to SRAM from somewhere, and the game downloads it from there and writes it; either for debugging, or as you say, factory reset.
2016-10-20 22:16:05	zid	It just controls whether it bothers to see if sram already exists

2016-10-20 22:18:22	dansan	On x86_64 with a Linux kernel, is it safe to restore (add to) the SP and then access data beyond it or is that just asking for an illegal access?
2016-10-20 22:18:25	zid	the files are just 16 byte headers that are 4 ints xor blended and md5'd
2016-10-20 22:18:46	zid	dansan: adding to SP is equivalent to allocating memory
2016-10-20 22:18:59	zid	think of it like a piece of tape maybe
2016-10-20 22:19:05	dansan	zid: umm, I mean is stack-grows-down...
2016-10-20 22:19:16	zid	oh right, x86
2016-10-20 22:19:18	dansan	So I sub it to get use more stack

2016-10-20 22:19:42	dansan	yeah, but I'm just curious if I'm playing with fire to attempt it
2016-10-20 22:19:47	dansan	I'm guessing so
2016-10-20 22:19:50	zid	everything does it, constantly
2016-10-20 22:19:55	zid	to free shit from the stack
2016-10-20 22:20:15	dansan	but I mean to essentially "free" from the stack and then access that memory anyway
2016-10-20 22:21:16	zid	it's not deleted, it's still there, unless something like a userspacey interrupt happens and overwrites it, linux has kernel stacks for hardware interrupts I think that doesn't apply?
2016-10-20 22:21:23	zid	maybe pthreads or coroutines or something will care
2016-10-20 22:21:23	dansan	On a Linux kernel, I know that it would have already mmaped that memory once I used it *after* having allocated (decremented RSP). I guess my question is one for the LInux kernel then -- when do those pages get ummapped
2016-10-20 22:21:39	dansan	Well, the kernel uses it's own stack
2016-10-20 22:21:41	zid	probably never, there's a limt to how much stack you're allowed
2016-10-20 22:21:44	dansan	ahh! good point!
2016-10-20 22:22:11	dansan	Well yeah, but it's not really the stack "allocation", as much as it is the memory being mmapped and I guess "comitted"
2016-10-20 22:22:31	zid	it'd be hard to check that the stack is a lot smaller than it used to be honestly
2016-10-20 22:22:37	zid	you'd need some periodic check
2016-10-20 22:22:46	zid	just to free a couple of pages every few years
2016-10-20 22:22:50	dansan	lol!!!
2016-10-20 22:23:02	zid	huh?
2016-10-20 22:23:08	zid	did I tell a side splitting joke accidently?
2016-10-20 22:23:12	dansan	Well, being that this is for a gcc patch, probably better to be safe
2016-10-20 22:23:18	dansan	yeah :)

2016-10-20 22:38:22	dansan	iiuc, that is a stack frame when you are using a hard frame pointer
2016-10-20 22:38:47	klys	also the "enter" and "leave" instructions, I am told, do the same thing.
2016-10-20 22:38:55	dansan	oh yes! :)
2016-10-20 22:39:04	dansan	I learned that a week or two ago as well
2016-10-20 22:39:54	dansan	On x86_64, a hard frame pointer isn't needed for effective debugging, so (at least on gcc) the default with -O is to disable it (I think -O1 and above)

2016-10-22 01:20:17	devonrevenge	is it feasable to get am arm chip - add electronic modules like sd card holders and esp8266 type wifi modules -  program in asm to make it all work
2016-10-22 01:20:23	devonrevenge	and all in the same month
2016-10-22 01:20:32	devonrevenge	- this is for uni -
2016-10-22 01:20:50	devonrevenge	and is it possible with entry level scope?
2016-10-22 01:21:59	GeDaMo	devonrevenge: http://www.abstrusegoose.com/249
2016-10-22 01:22:37	zid	You might get a prototype working in a month if it was already something you were good at
2016-10-22 01:23:09	devonrevenge	thanks - i need to be aware of the scope of a project without finding out the hardway
2016-10-22 01:23:21	devonrevenge	because time is pretty valuable
2016-10-22 01:23:22	archivist	and if you found the right appnotes,libraries and OS for the parts
2016-10-22 01:23:37	devonrevenge	yeah too much can go wrong and its too important
2016-10-22 01:24:01	devonrevenge	I can do what I want with a teensy but then im not doing a computer science project my idea will turn into wearables

2016-10-22 01:24:26	zid	That's why I estimate my project will be done in 2040
2016-10-22 01:24:31	devonrevenge	then I will have to have one of the mac wielding web development supervisors mark my project
2016-10-22 01:24:41	devonrevenge	and I have invasive thoughts about murdering them
2016-10-22 01:24:46	archivist	ew
2016-10-22 01:25:13	archivist	removal of mac js web coders is ok by me
2016-10-22 01:25:53	GeDaMo	devonrevenge: what's the objective of your project?
2016-10-22 01:25:56	devonrevenge	yeah this crowd hype peoples ideas up into things they cant manage and mark them down for not doing it as they imagined
2016-10-22 01:26:20	devonrevenge	well im pretty free and have ideas coming out my ears - you guys might like this too
2016-10-22 01:26:44	archivist	often people join the dots by using pre written libraries and call that science
2016-10-22 01:26:50	devonrevenge	one of my ideas is to create a piece of wearable tech that contains your RSA algorithms or sutchlike
2016-10-22 01:27:11	devonrevenge	it has other forms of encryption for communicating localy
2016-10-22 01:27:17	GeDaMo	Cryptowallet
2016-10-22 01:27:24	devonrevenge	almost
2016-10-22 01:27:29	archivist	but....that exists methinks
2016-10-22 01:27:36	devonrevenge	this think is to make normal
2016-10-22 01:27:38	devonrevenge	thing
2016-10-22 01:28:07	archivist	er banks give out free keys for users to keep with them now
2016-10-22 01:28:12	devonrevenge	is to make normal people use encryption - so long as they are near their comp an option to encrypt or not will appear in a dropdown list
2016-10-22 01:28:31	devonrevenge	so if your device is paired - you can encrypt a file
2016-10-22 01:28:39	devonrevenge	or decrypt
2016-10-22 01:29:09	devonrevenge	also maybe slotting in an sd will encrypt it
2016-10-22 01:29:36	devonrevenge	-my plan is to make having encryption create the same mental space as using house keys-

2016-10-22 02:58:53	devonrevenge	so I have digressed
2016-10-22 02:58:57	zid	vulture_: or a pkcs 11 dongle, also everywhere
2016-10-22 02:58:58	devonrevenge	um
2016-10-22 02:59:01	zid	and all the tech already exists
2016-10-22 02:59:24	devonrevenge	it will allready exist im not making something too new - my idea doesnt quite exist
2016-10-22 02:59:36	devonrevenge	and the other thing is im making something that exists better
2016-10-22 03:00:16	devonrevenge	so imagine this, so long as your dongle is switched on when you right click a file - the extra option to decrypt or encrypt is available
2016-10-22 03:00:39	vulture_	what makes that more secure than just doing it on your laptop
2016-10-22 03:00:46	devonrevenge	or, on your phone, if you have shared a public key by rubbing your dongle/watch
2016-10-22 03:00:51	devonrevenge	you can send encrypted data
2016-10-22 03:00:52	vulture_	dongles are dumb
2016-10-22 03:00:58	vulture_	people just leave them in because they are ultra annoying
2016-10-22 03:01:00	devonrevenge	what makes you more secure is this -
2016-10-22 03:01:04	vulture_	so they are about as useful as not using them
2016-10-22 03:01:23	devonrevenge	you can send or store encrypted data - if its taken from you - ie your nude selfies
2016-10-22 03:01:32	devonrevenge	no one can see them
2016-10-22 03:01:47	vulture_	if someone takes your laptop (with dongle attached) then they can still decrypt
2016-10-22 03:01:50	devonrevenge	yeah so thats why an encryption watch is better
2016-10-22 03:01:59	devonrevenge	especially if it has an attractive UI
2016-10-22 03:02:10	vulture_	that's why people use phones for 2fa/mfa
2016-10-22 03:02:26	vulture_	they arent exactly the best, but, it's a physically/virtually separated device
2016-10-22 03:02:30	devonrevenge	2fa/mfa?
2016-10-22 03:02:31	vulture_	so you would need to compromise both
2016-10-22 03:02:47	devonrevenge	I wanted to make it as normal for people as carying keys
2016-10-22 03:02:58	devonrevenge	so mentally yo ulock your door - you lock your files

2016-10-22 03:04:21	zid	instead of typing passwords all day
2016-10-22 03:05:05	vulture_	pff, just store a master key on the disk or network, encrypted
2016-10-22 03:05:05		[03:05]

2016-10-22 03:05:46	vulture_	password more secure though unless you're bad @ password
2016-10-22 03:06:06	zid	not sure if sarcasm or retarded
2016-10-22 03:06:21	vulture_	are you saying you want to use proximity as opposed to physically plug?
2016-10-22 03:06:30	devonrevenge	addressing the design flaws and finding the best architecture isnt the same project
2016-10-22 03:06:30	vulture_	do you need to pair the devices?
2016-10-22 03:06:43	vulture_	or can people just jack authentication as you just by being near you
2016-10-22 03:06:56	devonrevenge	im saying that you use proximity as your means to encrypt things with your public key
2016-10-22 03:06:58	zid	pkcs is RSA, for reference
2016-10-22 03:07:08	zid	with your public key? I hope not
2016-10-22 03:07:25	vulture_	who cares about public keys
2016-10-22 03:07:27	devonrevenge	well they wont because the server program is communicating with its own 4 way handshake
2016-10-22 03:07:48	vulture_	public keys should be as public as possible
2016-10-22 03:08:04	vulture_	stronger authentication :D
2016-10-22 03:08:08	devonrevenge	and the large primes private key stays on the watch

2016-10-22 03:08:24	zid	devonrevenge*
2016-10-22 03:08:33	devonrevenge	yeah I do
2016-10-22 03:08:44	devonrevenge	I made a server and client
2016-10-22 03:08:49	zid	would you like to correct anything you just said then?
2016-10-22 03:08:53	devonrevenge	so you encryptify and decryptify
2016-10-22 03:09:03	devonrevenge	just if you encryptify and sendify
2016-10-22 03:09:13	devonrevenge	you do it with their public keys
2016-10-22 03:09:24	devonrevenge	that you rubbed your dongle on

2016-10-22 03:09:46	zid	I am, and that's why I can confidently say he has it inside out.
2016-10-22 03:10:00	vulture_	more inside out than goatse?
2016-10-22 03:10:03	devonrevenge	if you want to keep stuff encrypted then the file is uploaded to your watch and then downloaded at the same time in a stream like fasion
2016-10-22 03:10:42	archivist	rofl at gigabyte files to and from a watch
2016-10-22 03:10:45	devonrevenge	but theres too many specifities - the project idea is a good design tech project
2016-10-22 03:10:49	vulture_	meanwhile, I'm in the cubicle next to you, stealing your documents, cuz proximity
2016-10-22 03:10:54	devonrevenge	no
2016-10-22 03:11:06	devonrevenge	because theres a random pad on both my comp and the watch
2016-10-22 03:11:16	devonrevenge	so them bites are flipped

2016-10-22 03:15:56	vulture_	you can do that with software
2016-10-22 03:16:00	devonrevenge	so long as they turn their watch on
2016-10-22 03:16:01	vulture_	and without the hardware
2016-10-22 03:16:08	vulture_	I have like
2016-10-22 03:16:12	vulture_	8 security tokens
2016-10-22 03:16:15	vulture_	it's annoying to carry around

2016-10-22 03:16:18	devonrevenge	yeah but if your comps nicked the answer is in the question
2016-10-22 03:16:48	devonrevenge	if you have the option to decrypt something and encrypt it just because you are near when you are not near
2016-10-22 03:16:53	devonrevenge	then its safe
2016-10-22 03:17:05	devonrevenge	say someone creeps in to peekify
2016-10-22 03:17:11	devonrevenge	wait it could be real time :D
2016-10-22 03:17:20	archivist	and a lost device is a disaster

2016-10-22 03:18:36	vulture_	my point is just that, you could do everything you're saying, except without the custom device, and have it be more secure
2016-10-22 03:18:47	vulture_	what you're proposing is just convenience, at the cost of security
2016-10-22 03:18:52	vulture_	which is probably fine for a lot of people
2016-10-22 03:19:12	devonrevenge	well its not convenient if its not secure
2016-10-22 03:19:27	vulture_	sure it is
2016-10-22 03:19:27	zid	it's not secure in the slightest
2016-10-22 03:19:28	devonrevenge	if it is convenient and the purpose is security then it is more secure
2016-10-22 03:19:36	zid	so all you have going for you is convenient
2016-10-22 03:19:42	vulture_	what you're proposing is less secure, straight up
2016-10-22 03:19:46	vulture_	so it can only be for convenience
2016-10-22 03:19:56	devonrevenge	unless it doesnt transmit files in plain code
2016-10-22 03:19:58	--	vulture_ is now known as vulture
2016-10-22 03:20:06	vulture	that's completely irrelevant
2016-10-22 03:20:06		[03:20]
2016-10-22 03:20:08	vulture	to everything

2016-10-22 03:20:38	devonrevenge	whats the point of something if the point is convenience at the cost of making its purpose less convenient its more inconvenient
2016-10-22 03:21:03	vulture	you're not making it less convenient, you're making it less secure, but more convenient
2016-10-22 03:21:12	zid	devonrevenge: Imagine a house key with 400 teeth
2016-10-22 03:21:26	zid	it's easier to put a key with 5 teeth in your pocket, despite being less secure
2016-10-22 03:21:30	devonrevenge	its still the same as an object you posses on the condition that the information only applies to things your in control of
2016-10-22 03:21:32	zid	we have decided as people that this is a worthwhile tradeoff
2016-10-22 03:21:51	devonrevenge	if your car keys are stolen then thats less convenient for you but thats not supposed to happen
2016-10-22 03:22:26	devonrevenge	so im creating a key that people use

2016-10-22 03:22:42	devonrevenge	the problem with pgp is that people should use it but you need crypto parties
2016-10-22 03:22:46	devonrevenge	yeah
2016-10-22 03:23:15	zid	so you are aware that it is possible to sacrifice security for convenicence You trying to redefine what both of those words mean isn't tricking us
2016-10-22 03:23:17	devonrevenge	one slows down the thief the other is more of a garauntee they would smaash a window
2016-10-22 03:23:34	devonrevenge	no but its a security device is it not
2016-10-22 03:23:41	zid	so is a key
2016-10-22 03:23:48	devonrevenge	so wheres the convenience if its more insecure
2016-10-22 03:23:58	vulture	convenience != security
2016-10-22 03:24:06	vulture	you can have more or less of one independent of the other

2016-10-22 03:24:19	devonrevenge	so im better off leaving my house door open?
2016-10-22 03:24:31	vulture	zid: it's not really inconvenient, that's how long my pants are anyway
2016-10-22 03:24:43	zid	vulture: Mine are filled with penis so there's no room for extra big keys
2016-10-22 03:24:43	devonrevenge	because the range is only as good as useing the computer
2016-10-22 03:25:00	devonrevenge	so its as good as plugging the device in

2016-10-22 03:25:08	zid	instead of attempting to talk over everybody

2016-10-22 03:25:57	zid	No, you've spent the past 10 minutes trying to redefine what the word convenient means
2016-10-22 03:26:03	zid	nothing to do with some magic device
2016-10-22 03:26:16	vulture	also, potentially less convenient since now I have a 9th device I need to carry around with me everywhere ;)
2016-10-22 03:26:19	zid	devonrevenge: Iss a house key that is 40 feet long convenient?
2016-10-22 03:27:09	devonrevenge	the range is not a problem as the information can be useless unless your sitting infront of the comp so no - a key 40 long isnt convenient
2016-10-22 03:27:16	zid	wow you did it again
2016-10-22 03:27:26	zid	you managed to answer a yes/no question with a paragraph of waffle about some device
2016-10-22 03:27:36	devonrevenge	well no
2016-10-22 03:27:36	vulture	it's like talking to a wall, with a parrot in the wall
2016-10-22 03:27:42	devonrevenge	but the question is nothing to do with magic device

2016-10-22 03:31:42	vulture	unless you have a secure pairing protocol, proximity is an extremely insecure basis for security
2016-10-22 03:31:59	vulture	and if you have a secure pairing protocol, yuo might as well just use a smartphone, cuz they're ubiquitous and convenient
2016-10-22 03:32:16	zid	Fairy: I don't think I could bring enough hotdogs for how hard he'd get roasted trying to talk over everybody and saying simple questions are insulting

2016-10-22 04:44:04	hackal	Was thinking more about "real world" example. Looking at wiki now I understand "shifting left is equivalent to multiplication by powers of 2"
2016-10-22 04:45:21	SlashLife	hackal: You can do that, but it is more related to bitwise operations.

2016-10-22 04:46:44	SlashLife	For example if you have an unsigned 32 bit integer representing an IP address, and you want the class C network address for if (x.y.z.0), you can AND it with (~0) (that's all bits set to 1) << 8
2016-10-22 04:48:35	SlashLife	hackal: Well - more related if you look at it on a higher level.
2016-10-22 04:48:35		[04:48]
2016-10-22 04:49:18	hackal	I think I should revise data representation first
2016-10-22 04:49:48	SlashLife	Even if you look at a language like C, if you want to multiply, you should use *, if you want to move bits around, you should use <<; even if the result would be the same, just to communicate your intentions to the next person reading the code.
2016-10-22 04:50:35	SlashLife	A bit shift will likely execute faster than the equivalent multiplication, but the compiler is smart enough to figure out whether it can use SHL or needs to use MUL.
2016-10-22 04:51:42	SlashLife	In assembly - yes, okay. Use bit shifts for multiplication with powers of 2, but as I said: Semantically a bit shift (as the name actually says) is rather to move around bits.
2016-10-22 04:52:09	ggole	Particularly since multiplication and shift are not the same for signed quantities

2016-10-22 09:50:19	Jester01	in the sense the question was asked, that's a NO
2016-10-22 09:50:50	Jester01	beq is a goto, not a function call

2016-10-22 09:52:21	zid	because the bne always bgoes to numDiff
2016-10-22 09:52:27	Jester01	you should do something to come back from there

2016-10-22 09:55:07	Jester01	as I said above
2016-10-22 09:55:27	Jester01	add code to go back to line 14

2016-10-22 09:55:32	Jester01	or just copy the exit syscall there
2016-10-22 09:55:34	kaos	zid: what is 0 in mips asm?

2016-10-22 09:56:28	hackal	Ok, but what if I want to continue the main code. Right now bne on line 10 jumps to numDiff, so I guess it needs to jump back right?

For example  *(_DWORD *)&a1->dword8 = 0; and dword8 is defined as bool but IDA doesn't recognize 0 as false. Is there anyway to define that 0 as false in this case so there is no cast. mostly for readability purposes.
2016-10-22 12:00:01	zid	you could add a false enum and tell it's an enum could you not?

2016-10-22 12:01:28	Guest66171	i would like to do that because that would eliminate showing the *(_DWord )&a1 cast. so it woudl show just a1->dword8 = false; ida already knows about the bool variable it seems
2016-10-22 12:01:42	zid	0 is already a dword though
2016-10-22 12:01:46	Guest66171	adding a falser enum might work
2016-10-22 12:02:15	Guest66171	false* but would not work for true when it is not 1
2016-10-22 12:02:32	Guest66171	yes but a1-> doword is defined as bool

2016-10-22 12:03:10	Guest66171	struct struct_a1 {   _DWORD len;   _DWORD total_len;   bool dword8;   LPVOID dwArray; };
2016-10-22 12:03:14	Guest66171	here is the struct for a1
2016-10-22 12:03:19	Guest66171	defined in ida
2016-10-22 12:04:19	zid	so change it to dword
2016-10-22 12:04:19	zid	like it should be
2016-10-22 12:04:19	zid	and then if you want to change what 0 means you can do that, but the fact of the matter is, it was compiled as a dword, regardless of the typedefs in play in the original struct
2016-10-22 12:06:39	Guest66171	oky. thx.

2016-10-23 05:35:57	Jester01	surely you can
2016-10-23 05:36:34	Jester01	you can stick the instructions into a test program, or even just do it on paper ... it's a couple of instructions, you would already be done with it
2016-10-23 05:36:42	zid	or just use windows calc
2016-10-23 05:36:59	zid	or wolfram alpha
2016-10-23 05:37:11	zid	it's just c = (a*b)%2^32
2016-10-23 05:37:16	asm272	Where can I find some information about 8051 memory location types? I'd like to know what type of memory (data, idata, sfr, xdata or code) is used when I execute an instruction
2016-10-23 05:37:20	zid	should give some solutions
2016-10-23 05:37:51	messy	thats what I was looking for thanks zid
2016-10-23 05:38:32	Jester01	that's not always the case, usually you also have some shifts
2016-10-23 05:38:52	Jester01	anyway, just do what the instructions say to do :)
2016-10-23 05:38:52	ggole	You could also compile a few C functions that divide by common divisors and see if they match
2016-10-23 05:39:05	zid	or bruteforce it
2016-10-23 05:39:09	Jester01	or google the magic number used :)

2016-10-23 10:12:11	DearVolt	Hello everyone :D I'm manipulating bitmaps using Intel x64 asm. I've managed to get other functions working, but this one is baffling me. I am basically setting a mask and then ORing every pixel. In GDB I can see the changes taking effect, but the image that is saved is the original. Anyone have any ideas? The source is at http://pastebin.com/ihaZrLtE - Particularly lines 96 - 102.

2016-10-23 10:36:19	DearVolt	@Jester01: I always feel so stupid when I ask and then spot it 15 minutes later xD
2016-10-23 10:36:33	DearVolt	May I ask a bit of a logic question? Not specifically asm related.
2016-10-23 10:37:00	Jester01	sure
2016-10-23 10:38:19	DearVolt	I'm trying to change the colour intensity of an 8-bit colour-depth bitmap. So depending on which colour I want to maximise, I set the bitmask to have that colour set to all 1s and then OR every pixel with the mask. The colours are coming out pretty funky though - The red intensity makes the image blue. Is my logic wrong?

2016-10-23 10:43:17	Jester01	in that case apply your logic to the color table instead
2016-10-23 10:43:38	DearVolt	Okay, awesome, thank you! I'll give that a try and be back in a few minutes.

2016-10-23 10:59:16	DearVolt	Funny enough, the gap between the last header entry and the pixel array is huge.
2016-10-23 10:59:51	DearVolt	So is my previous logic correct? Because the images are coming out discoloured, but definitely not the right colour intensity. I can upload examples?

2016-10-23 11:05:23	Jester01	sure
2016-10-23 11:05:46	Jester01	I understand that's how the original looks but I wanted the bmp to look at the headers and stuff

2016-10-23 11:16:21	DearVolt	Is that the wrong way to do it?
2016-10-23 11:16:51	Jester01	with a color table you can't generally know what changing the index will do
2016-10-23 11:17:15	Jester01	yes 0x3c has 0x80 not sure what you are trying to say

2016-10-23 11:18:29	DearVolt	Ah, what I meant was where did you find the number of colours in the colour table? Because where I think it should be, there are just 0s.
2016-10-23 11:19:09	DearVolt	And I swapped the bitmasks to use BBGGGRRR instead of RRRGGGBB and the intensities are now right, even though I'm masking every pixel.
2016-10-23 11:19:36	Jester01	that's accidental due to how the color table is set up

2016-10-23 20:56:05	AverageJ0e	sort of. more like making it so that way your code is called when a certain function's name or address is called
2016-10-23 20:56:36	AverageJ0e	you "hook" it by replacing the first 5 bytes of the function's prolog to perform a long jump to your own code.
2016-10-23 20:56:56	AverageJ0e	or it can be the epilog too

2016-10-23 20:58:21	AverageJ0e	an example would be to "hook" a function like strcmp() and check if one of the arguments is greater than 10, then print "cock" or something. this would be done via pin or dlsym or some hooking library
2016-10-23 21:02:29	-->	kbw (~KeyboardW@104-178-145-79.lightspeed.tukrga.sbcglobal.net) has joined ##asm
2016-10-23 21:02:47	soulisson	AverageJ0e: thank you, is modifying the IAT also a function hooking method?
2016-10-23 21:03:10	AverageJ0e	not always.
2016-10-23 21:04:24	soulisson	AverageJ0e: so if I change a function address with my function, it's not considered function hooking?
2016-10-23 21:04:44	AverageJ0e	virus writers and shellcode writers learned a long time ago that fucking with the IAT is a pain in the ass. its much easier to dynamically call the code you want via the use of loadlibary / getprocaddress on windows, or dlopen / dlsym on linux
2016-10-23 21:06:12	AverageJ0e	i'd say its borderline patching

2016-10-23 23:46:36	dminuoso_	zid: Yeah, after which I did not understand the difference from a plain uop cache.
2016-10-23 23:46:38	zid	It just caches decoded opcodes (into micro-ops) in a list somewhere as part of its speculation
2016-10-23 23:46:39	zid	there ya go
2016-10-23 23:47:53	zid	It's just a speculative version of normal ucache by the reading of it
2016-10-23 23:48:07	dminuoso_	zid: Im reading some technical details on how the trace cache works on Willamette, it seems crazily complicated.
2016-10-23 23:48:12	zid	it can be thrown away, or there can be multiple versions depending on whether a jump is actually taken or not etc

2016-10-23 23:49:52	dminuoso_	zid: Well the complicated bit comes from building those traces, so the architecture seems to have two distinct modes ("segment build mode" and "execution mode") based on what I'm reading.
2016-10-23 23:50:05	zid	well yea, it'd have to
2016-10-23 23:50:12	zid	you can't get any work done if you never execute anything
2016-10-23 23:50:17	dminuoso_	Yeah.
2016-10-23 23:50:20	zid	and you don't have trace cache if you don't build the traces
2016-10-23 23:50:34	zid	that's a hugely simple implication
2016-10-23 23:50:39	zid	why is it complicated
2016-10-23 23:51:08	dminuoso_	It seems like this could be one of the factors that made the P4 pipeline so incredibly long.

2016-10-23 23:51:25	zid	That's more like a fix
2016-10-23 23:51:34	zid	because the pipeline is so long you need crap like that to help avoid starving the cpu
2016-10-23 23:51:45	zid	decode both sides of every branch to reduce the latency of a mispredict
2016-10-23 23:51:59	dminuoso_	Mhm, with some steep penalties. Over 20 cycles penalty for a branch misprediction that turns into a trace segment build mode is hefty.
2016-10-23 23:52:16	zid	but without the trace segment available, it'd be 20 cycles in EVERY branch
2016-10-23 23:52:19	zid	that's the point of it

2016-10-23 23:56:22	dminuoso_	zid: Very interesting stuff - I guess the benefits are highest when there's lots of local hotspots such as tight loops so that the CPU can remain in execution mode for as long as possible.
2016-10-23 23:56:33	dminuoso_	(Which I guess applies to most caches)
2016-10-23 23:57:01	zid	The benefits are highest when a branch is mis-predicted but the decode of it is already cached
2016-10-23 23:57:58	dminuoso_	It seems like a plain uop cache offers the same benefits but with far less complexity.
2016-10-23 23:58:15	zid	except those are only for /one/ block
2016-10-23 23:58:28	zid	the point of a trace cache is that it could be the 6 possible blocks starting from 0xDEAD0000
2016-10-23 23:58:41	zid	and you have them ALL in cache, no matter what the actual state of execution is when you get there
2016-10-23 23:59:08	zid	because if you land there and state 4 is the real one, and you predicted only state 1 and decoded that (traditional cache) you're fucked
2016-10-23 23:59:47	zid	Okay let's go with an example,  you ready?

2016-10-24 00:03:13	zid	ready, steady, go! Answer:
2016-10-24 00:03:16	dminuoso_	It will have the uops for all instructions (which will be add/test/jnz and some call/jnz ready)
2016-10-24 00:03:20	zid	right, nothing
2016-10-24 00:03:22	dminuoso_	in its cache - hot.
2016-10-24 00:03:29	zid	so the decode cache is bored as fuck
2016-10-24 00:03:34	dminuoso_	Right.
2016-10-24 00:03:43	dminuoso_	It will have them cached after the first pass.
2016-10-24 00:03:54	zid	so why not.. make it do something, and speculatively decode a few ways in which the state could be after the loop ends?
2016-10-24 00:04:13	zid	decode the i == 0 case where some hypothetical jump is taken, and also the i != 0 case where it is
2016-10-24 00:04:22	zid	so now no matter how the loop ends, you've got everything already decoded
2016-10-24 00:04:51	zid	you could invent some type of cache to store a few of these decoded blocks
2016-10-24 00:04:57	zid	maybe give it a cool name, like trace cache
2016-10-24 00:05:02	zid	and make some patents

2016-10-24 00:05:39	dminuoso_	zid: But why would the CPU predict that the branch was taken?
2016-10-24 00:05:45	zid	dminuoso: because it's *bored*
2016-10-24 00:05:56	boru	'Stacked on-die' is redundant.
2016-10-24 00:05:57	dminuoso_	zid: What kind of branch predictor is that?
2016-10-24 00:06:02	dminuoso_	"boredom predictor" ?
2016-10-24 00:06:06	zid	we're not talking about the branch predictor
2016-10-24 00:06:29	zid	we're talking about branch premonition
2016-10-24 00:06:47	zid	Who cares if you get the prediction wrong if you've *already figured out what happens on both sides of the branch*
2016-10-24 00:07:46	zid	while(big fucking loop) trace[0] = left_side; trace[1] = right_side;  when(loop ends) OH LOOK I ALREADY HAVE BOTH SIDES FINISHED, SWEET
2016-10-24 00:07:50	dminuoso_	zid: Ahh, so in the trace segment build mode, the processor maps out possible traces and caches them - so that in execution mode it can go either way
2016-10-24 00:07:56	zid	right
2016-10-24 00:08:00	dminuoso_	all possible traces for the local code region
2016-10-24 00:08:07	zid	rather than only having the singular trace
2016-10-24 00:08:11	zid	which is what normal decode cache is
2016-10-24 00:08:14	zid	it's just parallel decode cache
2016-10-24 00:08:21	zid	and you just use the one that ended up being the right one
2016-10-24 00:08:26	dminuoso_	Right, and indexed by a "trace" rather than pure IP
2016-10-24 00:09:09	zid	in some cases though, after the loop ends, the state will be so complicated you only had enough cache to decode 4 of the 8 possible cases
2016-10-24 00:09:18	zid	if you hit one you didn't have the trace for, THAT is where your 20 cycles hits
2016-10-24 00:09:36	zid	if you only have 1 trace cache (normal decode cache) 7 of the 8 would have the 20 cycle penalty
2016-10-24 00:09:52	zid	but we reduced it to 4 by making the decode cache do stuff while it was waiting for the loop to end

2016-10-24 00:38:06	dminuoso_	zid: Well, I would have expected the "volatile" to be enough to prevent GCC from reordering it.
2016-10-24 00:38:23	dminuoso_	But the volatile just prevents GCC from optimizing the assembly away in some cases I think

2016-10-24 00:38:50	zid	GCC's optimizers sometimes discard asm statements if they determine there is no need for the output variables. Also, the optimizers may move code out of loops if they believe that the code will always return the same result (i.e. none of its input values change between calls). Using the volatile qualifier disables these optimizations. asm statements that have no output operands, including asm
2016-10-24 00:38:50	zid	goto statements, are implicitly volatile.
2016-10-24 00:39:01	zid	amazing, it's written in the manual

2016-10-24 00:39:57	dminuoso_	zid: The sad thing is, the manual even mentions this trick with fake output variables - its just super silly.
2016-10-24 00:40:05	zid	The compiler may move the addition back before the volatile asm. To make it work as expected, add an artificial dependency to the asm by referencing a variable in the subsequent code, for example:
2016-10-24 00:40:07	zid	yep
2016-10-24 00:40:11	zid	it's not silly at all
2016-10-24 00:40:17	zid	gcc *cannot look inside assembly blocks*
2016-10-24 00:40:25	zid	that's what gas does, gcc is a C compiler
2016-10-24 00:40:35	dminuoso_	I just feel that GCC should not reorder volatile assembly.

2016-10-24 03:50:31	zid	l1 is unshared, l2 is shared, roughly
2016-10-24 03:50:37	bcos	xux: Sharing is nice to ensure cache coherency
2016-10-24 03:50:44	GeDaMo	So if the main memory changes the cache has to be updated
2016-10-24 03:50:51	zid	and they push their l1 into the pooled l2, and the other cores get notified their l1 is stale, etc
2016-10-24 03:50:55	zid	it's fairly complicated
2016-10-24 03:50:56	xux	GeDaMo: oh, so it's accessing the main memory needlessly?
2016-10-24 03:51:09	GeDaMo	It's needed because the cache is out of date
2016-10-24 03:51:33	bcos	L1 might be "per core", L2 might be shared by 2 cores, L3 might be shared by all cores in the chip (but not cores in other chips)..
2016-10-24 03:51:41	GeDaMo	Ideally, you keep thread specific data on separate cache lines
2016-10-24 03:52:00	xux	this isn't a problem if you have different processes not sharing anything, right?

2016-10-24 03:53:40	bcos	..you'd want the opposite - processes that do share data running on CPUs that share cache, to maximise the benefits of sharing

2016-10-24 06:47:49	vulture	also your algorithm is incredibly insecure
2016-10-24 06:48:41	vulture	if I know the first MD5_DIGEST_SIZE bytes of your file (which is fairly easy, cuz file headers are a thing), then I can compute MD5(a^2); and from there, I can decrypt all the other bytes of your file

2016-10-24 10:37:29	vulture	toothe: function pointer (C++?)
2016-10-24 10:38:06	vulture	yeah, C++
2016-10-24 10:38:49	vulture	esi caches the 'this' object. when doing a __thiscall, you put the this object in ecx, thus the mov ecx,esi
2016-10-24 10:39:06	vulture	the first slot in an object that has a vtbl, contains the vtbl pointer
2016-10-24 10:39:12	vulture	so [esi] has that pointer
2016-10-24 10:39:21	vulture	mov eax,[esi] grabs the vtbl pointer and sticks in eax
2016-10-24 10:39:42	vulture	then [eax+38h] is whatever the 38h/4(+1?)'th virtual function is for that object
2016-10-24 10:41:57	toothe	ahh...
2016-10-24 10:42:05	toothe	so, stupid question - is there an offset to that?

2016-10-24 10:42:57	GeDaMo	Offset to what?
2016-10-24 10:43:29	toothe	meaning, 38h/4 = 14
2016-10-24 10:43:39	toothe	so, jump to the function pointer at 14? I don't get it?
2016-10-24 10:43:48	vulture	function pointer is at eax+38h
2016-10-24 10:43:49	GeDaMo	[eax+38h]
2016-10-24 10:44:01	vulture	say you have a C++ object with 4 virtual functions
2016-10-24 10:44:13	vulture	if it were e.g. [eax+8] then that's the 3rd virtual function
2016-10-24 10:44:14	toothe	im just not sure how to arrive at that...
2016-10-24 10:44:21	vulture	because 8/4+1 = 3
2016-10-24 10:44:25	vulture	first is at eax+0
2016-10-24 10:44:26	vulture	second at eax+4
2016-10-24 10:44:29	vulture	third at eax+8
2016-10-24 10:44:30	vulture	etc
2016-10-24 10:44:35	toothe	right, but what is eax....
2016-10-24 10:44:39	toothe	i don't know how to figure that out.
2016-10-24 10:44:41	vulture	[15.39.30] <vulture> mov eax,[esi] grabs the vtbl pointer and sticks in eax
2016-10-24 10:44:50	toothe	err...yes...
2016-10-24 10:45:17	toothe	i don't know what that value is though?
2016-10-24 10:45:17		[10:45]
2016-10-24 10:45:36	vulture	when you compile C++ with polymorphic objects, what happens is for every possible configuration of a polymorphic object, there is a unique vtbl (which is just an array of function pointers in memory) that lists out absolutely every virtual function
2016-10-24 10:46:01	vulture	when you instantiate a polymorphic object, you decide which vtbl you will use for that object
2016-10-24 10:46:04	toothe	makes sense.
2016-10-24 10:46:09	vulture	and put that as the first pointer in the object
2016-10-24 10:46:29	toothe	so, this is why people hate C++?
2016-10-24 10:46:47	vulture	ehh
2016-10-24 10:46:56	vulture	it's why virtual functions are slow :P
2016-10-24 10:47:05	toothe	yeah, the compiler was odd here.
2016-10-24 10:47:12	toothe	even the way it did switch cases was confusing heh
2016-10-24 10:47:12	vulture	which is why "proper" (polymorphic) C++ is slow
2016-10-24 10:47:14	toothe	took me time to figure it out.
2016-10-24 10:47:25	vulture	could be worse
2016-10-24 10:47:28	vulture	could be python
2016-10-24 10:47:33	toothe	!!!
2016-10-24 10:47:34	toothe	i love python!
2016-10-24 10:47:55	GeDaMo	It's hashtables all the way down :P
2016-10-24 10:48:15	toothe	trying to see if the vtbl value is anywhere in this code.
2016-10-24 10:48:17	toothe	ida pro 5.0
2016-10-24 10:48:23	toothe	i can't figure out how to search lol
2016-10-24 10:48:25	vulture	have you got a breakpoint?
2016-10-24 10:48:29	toothe	no.
2016-10-24 10:48:31	vulture	just set a breakpoint when it reads it

2016-10-24 10:49:11	vulture	you could search for vtbl initializers though

2016-10-24 10:49:25	vulture	and then if you go to dword_xxxxxxxx

2016-10-24 11:23:39	vulture	wow I buy AverageJ0e a drink once and now he's buying everyone else drinks
2016-10-24 11:23:49	toothe	let me step out for a bit...going to go home.
2016-10-24 11:23:56	AverageJ0e	that's right doc
2016-10-24 11:23:59	toothe	will have to conintue this. But again, I am pretty much lost at this point.
2016-10-24 11:24:07	toothe	but that's how you learn.
2016-10-24 11:24:17	vulture	doing it in a debugger helps
2016-10-24 11:24:23	vulture	because you can see actual data flowing around :P
2016-10-24 11:24:31	toothe	IdaPro 5.0 not good?
2016-10-24 11:24:56	AverageJ0e	write what you want in C first, then take the output the compiler shits out and use that with your assembler.
2016-10-24 11:25:53	vulture	I think we determined that 5.0 was from 1876
2016-10-24 11:26:03	vulture	in celebration of the centennial
2016-10-24 11:26:33	AverageJ0e	what about binary ninja? anyone use that yet?

2016-10-24 22:59:37	heelpmeplz	[03:11:16] When does IMUL set the overflow flag? [03:11:16]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	heelpmeplz	[03:11:25] MUL and IMUL [03:11:25]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	Random832	[03:13:31] http://x86.renejeschke.de/html/file_module_x86_id_138.html The CF and OF flags are set when significant bit (including the sign bit) are carried into the upper half of the result. The CF and OF flags are cleared when the result (including the sign bit) fits exactly in the lower half of the result. [03:13:31]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	Random832	[03:14:49] the key thing to remember is that multiply has a double-sized result, in edx:eax [etc] [03:14:49]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	heelpmeplz	[03:17:53] thank you [03:17:53]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	Random832	[03:18:28] but the flags are based on the regular sized result since the larger one can't overflow [03:18:28]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	heelpmeplz	[03:48:09] could movsx be considered a substitute for mov ax, myVar  ;  cwd [03:48:09]

2016-10-24 22:59:37	heelpmeplz	[04:08:08] is what I'm asking [04:08:08]
2016-10-24 22:59:37	Random832	[04:09:37] well, what is myVar, and what operands are you talking about passing to movsx [04:09:37]

2016-10-25 01:04:08	ThatDude	Hello Wizards of the ASM Lands.... I am trying to understand this line of code *(_QWORD *)&result = (unsigned __int128)_mm_or_pd(_mm_andn_pd(v10, v9), _mm_and_pd(v7, v10));
2016-10-25 01:04:17	ThatDude	ARM64 ios
2016-10-25 01:05:41	ThatDude	the v's are Floats.... I could paste the pure assembly too if that helps

2016-10-25 01:05:50	GeDaMo	I think
2016-10-25 01:06:37	ThatDude	ok , I just wonder whats the semantics of this but yeah I can use that info, thanks !
2016-10-25 01:07:18	GeDaMo	It may be v10 which is inverted in the first part instead of v9, I'm not sure
2016-10-25 01:07:24	Jester02	are you sure v10 isn't a bitmask?
2016-10-25 01:07:52	ThatDude	 v10 = _mm_cmpunord_sd(v6, v6);
2016-10-25 01:08:02	Jester02	yeah that's a mask.

2016-10-25 01:12:39	ThatDude	ok so i will use that formula u gave me
2016-10-25 01:12:41	ThatDude	thx !
2016-10-25 01:12:59	Jester02	v6 is a division
2016-10-25 01:13:12	Jester02	so that check is basically for a division by zero
2016-10-25 01:13:17	Jester02	or maybe overflow too
2016-10-25 01:14:20	ThatDude	so  the result is basicaly fmin(v6,v7)

2016-10-25 01:23:24	ThatDude	btw what IDE are u binary masters use these days ?
2016-10-25 01:23:50	Love4Boobies	Real mean use power editors, like Vim or Emacs, not silly IDEs. Those are for girls. :P

2016-10-25 01:24:16	ThatDude	:D
2016-10-25 01:24:26	ThatDude	so vim it is
2016-10-25 01:25:17	Love4Boobies	There's a learning curive but if you do a lot of editing, they are very powerful and flexible. They move most of the editing work from the user to the computer, where it belongs.

2016-10-25 07:31:46	damien	So there's a solution in a problem for my assembly that asks to use a mux for a 4 var boolean function. It asks for the smallest mux, but the solution uses a 8 to 1 mux. However, couldn't you use a 4 to one mux to do the same (and it would be a smaller mux)?

2016-10-25 07:35:58	damien	Yeah, I remember him saying that in class though, but don't see how it's the smallest mux. Maybe he means that the total sum of gates is smaller? I should count the to make sure

2016-10-25 07:42:00	vulture_	depends on what the actual question is since you didnt actually explain what the problem is (a function is not something you mux, so your explanation doesnt really make any sense)
2016-10-25 07:45:11	damien	vulture_: a mux is a universal gate (i.e. you can implement any boolean function using a mux). Basically we're making a 1-bit alu with 4 different boolean functions
2016-10-25 07:45:35	damien	which is a function in of itself
2016-10-25 07:45:36	zid	that's not what a mux is in my universe
2016-10-25 07:45:51	GeDaMo	That sounds like a 4-bit lookup table
2016-10-25 07:46:00	GeDaMo	E.g. as part of an FPGA
2016-10-25 07:46:55	vulture_	what do you mean implement a boolean function using a mux
2016-10-25 07:47:11	vulture_	why not implement a boolean function as not-a-mux
2016-10-25 07:47:17	vulture_	it would be smaller and more direct :P
2016-10-25 07:47:43	boru	Yeah, don't forget to paint that bikeshed green!
2016-10-25 07:48:01	damien	well I used the two selector bits to choose what inputs (different alu functions) to map to the output
2016-10-25 07:48:06	vulture_	if you are constrained by the rules of e.g. an fpga like GeDaMo said, then it could be a LUT
2016-10-25 07:48:20	damien	I didn't make the problem and this is the terminology use in the class
2016-10-25 07:48:22	zid	boru: but it should be red
2016-10-25 07:48:54	zid	damien: Your mistake was not taking a class that was taking place on earth
2016-10-25 07:50:16	damien	It's being taught by a math professor. So he doesn't really care about the details. Hence why it's so theoretical
2016-10-25 07:50:30	damien	and not using specific terminology
2016-10-25 07:52:25	damien	It's an intro class too and most people struggle to just grasp how to do the gate logic, so maybe he dials it down a bit too
2016-10-25 07:53:39	damien	Do you guys know of any books where I could learn how it's actually implemented in the real world?

2016-10-25 07:58:06	damien	Like I know how specific gates are contructed with cmos. How you make an FPGA would be interesting
2016-10-25 07:59:20	vulture_	everything on a high level (logic) just gets compiled down to a specific low level that is very specific to your hardware (cmos, mosfets, nands, LUTs, pick your poison)
2016-10-25 07:59:26	vulture_	fpga is typically LUTs
2016-10-25 07:59:47	vulture_	(although the LUTs are obviously implemented with something else on a lower level, you compile your high level logic down to LUTs)

2016-10-25 08:08:49	damien	Sorry connection sketched. Thing is that it's not for a concrete application. The teacher was just testing weather we knew how to do it with a mux based lookup table
2016-10-25 08:09:59	zid	[19:02] <damien> Turns out the LUT is usually implemented using a combination of a multiplexer and sram

2016-10-25 08:38:36	xux	when you try to decompose images and then reconstruct them in alternated ways, you're generally just scrambling them around. What you're doing may make sense computationally, but the end result may not make any sense to a human being, so you have to code for the human visual and not for some kind of correct information theory model.

2016-10-25 11:42:04	GeDaMo	[17:45:51] That sounds like a 4-bit lookup table [17:45:51]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	GeDaMo	[17:46:00] E.g. as part of an FPGA [17:46:00]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	vulture_	[17:46:55] what do you mean implement a boolean function using a mux [17:46:55]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	vulture_	[17:47:11] why not implement a boolean function as not-a-mux [17:47:11]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	vulture_	[17:47:17] it would be smaller and more direct :P [17:47:17]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	boru	[17:47:43] Yeah, don't forget to paint that bikeshed green! [17:47:43]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[17:48:01] well I used the two selector bits to choose what inputs (different alu functions) to map to the output [17:48:01]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	vulture_	[17:48:06] if you are constrained by the rules of e.g. an fpga like GeDaMo said, then it could be a LUT [17:48:06]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[17:48:20] I didn't make the problem and this is the terminology use in the class [17:48:20]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	zid	[17:48:22] boru: but it should be red [17:48:22]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	zid	[17:48:54] damien: Your mistake was not taking a class that was taking place on earth [17:48:54]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[17:50:16] It's being taught by a math professor. So he doesn't really care about the details. Hence why it's so theoretical [17:50:16]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[17:50:30] and not using specific terminology [17:50:30]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[17:52:25] It's an intro class too and most people struggle to just grasp how to do the gate logic, so maybe he dials it down a bit too [17:52:25]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[17:53:39] Do you guys know of any books where I could learn how it's actually implemented in the real world? [17:53:39]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	GeDaMo	[17:54:35] How what is implemented? [17:54:35]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	vulture_	[17:54:57] what, like NAND CMOS ? :P [17:54:57]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[17:56:42] I guess just Computer Architecture in general [17:56:42]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[17:58:06] Like I know how specific gates are contructed with cmos. How you make an FPGA would be interesting [17:58:06]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	vulture_	[17:59:20] everything on a high level (logic) just gets compiled down to a specific low level that is very specific to your hardware (cmos, mosfets, nands, LUTs, pick your poison) [17:59:20]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	vulture_	[17:59:26] fpga is typically LUTs [17:59:26]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	vulture_	[17:59:47] (although the LUTs are obviously implemented with something else on a lower level, you compile your high level logic down to LUTs) [17:59:47]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[18:02:48] Turns out the LUT is usually implemented using a combination of a multiplexer and sram [18:02:48]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[18:03:10] according to electronics.stackexchange [18:03:10]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	zid	[18:03:30] the lut in /what/ though [18:03:30]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	zid	[18:03:36] multiple people asked you what the context is [18:03:36]

2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[18:10:15] I meant some LUTs [18:10:15]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	zid	[18:10:21] right, what type [18:10:21]

2016-10-25 11:42:04	vulture_	[18:10:42] correct [18:10:42]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	damien	[18:11:16] The question addressed LUT in FPGA [18:11:16]
2016-10-25 11:42:04	xux	[18:38:36] when you try to decompose images and then reconstruct them in alternated ways, you're generally just scrambling them around. What you're doing may make sense computationally, but the end result may not make any sense to a human being, so you have to code for the human visual and not for some kind of correct information theory model.

2016-10-25 11:47:14	GeDaMo	[17:45:51] That sounds like a 4-bit lookup table [17:45:51]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	GeDaMo	[17:46:00] E.g. as part of an FPGA [17:46:00]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	vulture_	[17:46:55] what do you mean implement a boolean function using a mux [17:46:55]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	vulture_	[17:47:11] why not implement a boolean function as not-a-mux [17:47:11]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	vulture_	[17:47:17] it would be smaller and more direct :P [17:47:17]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	boru	[17:47:43] Yeah, don't forget to paint that bikeshed green! [17:47:43]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	damien	[17:48:01] well I used the two selector bits to choose what inputs (different alu functions) to map to the output [17:48:01]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	vulture_	[17:48:06] if you are constrained by the rules of e.g. an fpga like GeDaMo said, then it could be a LUT [17:48:06]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	damien	[17:48:20] I didn't make the problem and this is the terminology use in the class [17:48:20]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	zid	[17:48:22] boru: but it should be red [17:48:22]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	zid	[17:48:54] damien: Your mistake was not taking a class that was taking place on earth [17:48:54]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	damien	[17:50:16] It's being taught by a math professor. So he doesn't really care about the details. Hence why it's so theoretical [17:50:16]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	damien	[17:50:30] and not using specific terminology [17:50:30]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	damien	[17:52:25] It's an intro class too and most people struggle to just grasp how to do the gate logic, so maybe he dials it down a bit too [17:52:25]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	damien	[17:53:39] Do you guys know of any books where I could learn how it's actually implemented in the real world? [17:53:39]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	GeDaMo	[17:54:35] How what is implemented? [17:54:35]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	vulture_	[17:54:57] what, like NAND CMOS ? :P [17:54:57]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	damien	[17:56:42] I guess just Computer Architecture in general [17:56:42]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	damien	[17:58:06] Like I know how specific gates are contructed with cmos. How you make an FPGA would be interesting [17:58:06]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	vulture_	[17:59:20] everything on a high level (logic) just gets compiled down to a specific low level that is very specific to your hardware (cmos, mosfets, nands, LUTs, pick your poison) [17:59:20]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	vulture_	[17:59:26] fpga is typically LUTs [17:59:26]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	vulture_	[17:59:47] (although the LUTs are obviously implemented with something else on a lower level, you compile your high level logic down to LUTs) [17:59:47]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	damien	[18:02:48] Turns out the LUT is usually implemented using a combination of a multiplexer and sram [18:02:48]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	damien	[18:03:10] according to electronics.stackexchange [18:03:10]
2016-10-25 11:47:14	zid	[18:03:30] the lut in /what/ though [18:03:30]

2016-10-25 13:49:43	GeDaMo	[17:45:51] That sounds like a 4-bit lookup table [17:45:51]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	GeDaMo	[17:46:00] E.g. as part of an FPGA [17:46:00]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	vulture_	[17:46:55] what do you mean implement a boolean function using a mux [17:46:55]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	vulture_	[17:47:11] why not implement a boolean function as not-a-mux [17:47:11]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	vulture_	[17:47:17] it would be smaller and more direct :P [17:47:17]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	boru	[17:47:43] Yeah, don't forget to paint that bikeshed green! [17:47:43]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[17:48:01] well I used the two selector bits to choose what inputs (different alu functions) to map to the output [17:48:01]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	vulture_	[17:48:06] if you are constrained by the rules of e.g. an fpga like GeDaMo said, then it could be a LUT [17:48:06]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[17:48:20] I didn't make the problem and this is the terminology use in the class [17:48:20]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[17:48:22] boru: but it should be red [17:48:22]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[17:48:54] damien: Your mistake was not taking a class that was taking place on earth [17:48:54]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[17:50:16] It's being taught by a math professor. So he doesn't really care about the details. Hence why it's so theoretical [17:50:16]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[17:50:30] and not using specific terminology [17:50:30]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[17:52:25] It's an intro class too and most people struggle to just grasp how to do the gate logic, so maybe he dials it down a bit too [17:52:25]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[17:53:39] Do you guys know of any books where I could learn how it's actually implemented in the real world? [17:53:39]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	GeDaMo	[17:54:35] How what is implemented? [17:54:35]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	vulture_	[17:54:57] what, like NAND CMOS ? :P [17:54:57]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[17:56:42] I guess just Computer Architecture in general [17:56:42]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[17:58:06] Like I know how specific gates are contructed with cmos. How you make an FPGA would be interesting [17:58:06]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	vulture_	[17:59:20] everything on a high level (logic) just gets compiled down to a specific low level that is very specific to your hardware (cmos, mosfets, nands, LUTs, pick your poison) [17:59:20]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	vulture_	[17:59:26] fpga is typically LUTs [17:59:26]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	vulture_	[17:59:47] (although the LUTs are obviously implemented with something else on a lower level, you compile your high level logic down to LUTs) [17:59:47]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[18:02:48] Turns out the LUT is usually implemented using a combination of a multiplexer and sram [18:02:48]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[18:03:10] according to electronics.stackexchange [18:03:10]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:03:30] the lut in /what/ though [18:03:30]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:03:36] multiple people asked you what the context is [18:03:36]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:03:45] cus in cmos and ttl and stuff you'd just use regular gates [18:03:45]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:03:47] not a muxer and sram [18:03:47]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[18:08:49] Sorry connection sketched. Thing is that it's not for a concrete application. The teacher was just testing weather we knew how to do it with a mux based lookup table [18:08:49]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:09:59] [19:02] <damien> Turns out the LUT is usually implemented using a combination of a multiplexer and sram [18:09:59]

2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[18:10:15] I meant some LUTs [18:10:15]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:10:21] right, what type [18:10:21]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:10:23] what situation [18:10:23]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:10:35] someone obviously had one in mind when they answered on stack overflow [18:10:35]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:10:40] this is like pulling teeth [18:10:40]

2016-10-25 13:49:43	vulture_	[18:10:42] correct [18:10:42]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	damien	[18:11:16] The question addressed LUT in FPGA [18:11:16]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	xux	[18:38:36] when you try to decompose images and then reconstruct them in alternated ways, you're generally just scrambling them around. What you're doing may make sense computationally, but the end result may not make any sense to a human being, so you have to code for the human visual and not for some kind of correct information theory model. [18:38:36]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:40:01] take your meds [18:40:01]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	ararob	[18:40:48] lol [18:40:48]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	boru	[18:41:02] Is that a fact bot? [18:41:02]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	GeDaMo	[18:41:18] Probably a misfenestration [18:41:18]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	boru	[18:41:33] Quite. [18:41:33]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	Jester02	[18:41:54] lol [18:41:54]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	zid	[18:42:12] looks like some intro to jpeg [18:42:12]

2016-10-25 16:43:04	hackal	MIPS
2016-10-25 16:43:23	hackal	Is MIPS an architecture?
2016-10-25 16:44:55	Random832	i'd say try it - immediate operands are 16 bits, so it'll get zero-extended, but the real question is whether the assembler accepts character literals
2016-10-25 16:45:07	hackal	I am having hard time figuring out how to get words out of string. I can loop byte by byte of the string but not sure what to do next. I am trying to figure out the delimiters of the words.

2016-10-25 16:50:51	hackal	I am not sure I can "help" with the architecture. I am just learning using MIPS and MARS editor
2016-10-25 16:51:36	Random832	also is this required to be a full subroutine, rather than just a section of your other function and you jump where you need to be in the other function if there is / is not a delimiter?
2016-10-25 16:53:23	Random832	i'd probably at least make it a "find next delimiter" subroutine
2016-10-25 16:53:23		[16:53]
2016-10-25 16:53:24	hackal	It doesn't need to be subroutine

2016-10-25 16:57:15	Random832	anyway you're doing a lot of comparisons in each loop, it might be worthwhile to explore if there's better performance if you can check if bit 0x40 [which is set for all letters, and clear for all delimiters other than _] is clear

2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[02:51:36] also is this required to be a full subroutine, rather than just a section of your other function and you jump where you need to be in the other function if there is / is not a delimiter? [02:51:36]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[02:53:23] i'd probably at least make it a "find next delimiter" subroutine [02:53:23]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	hackal	[02:53:24] It doesn't need to be subroutine [02:53:24]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[02:57:15] anyway you're doing a lot of comparisons in each loop, it might be worthwhile to explore if there's better performance if you can check if bit 0x40 [which is set for all letters, and clear for all delimiters other than _] is clear [02:57:15]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[02:58:09] or use a bitmap [02:58:09]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	hackal	[03:01:01] I am basically translating this https://gist.github.com/hackal/6a05e5cfffaccc41f44b84a2cb329082 C program to MIPS [03:01:01]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	hackal	[03:02:28] unfortunate is I do not undestand everything in the C code, however I know what it is supposed to do [03:02:28]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:02:29] ok if this is for an assignment probably don't get too fancy [03:02:29]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:03:38] i'd probably use li to set $v1 but otherwise that looks like a reasonable translation of the is_delimiting_char subroutine [03:03:38]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	hackal	[03:04:25] Also, is '\n' considered as a byte? [03:04:25]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:05:13] yes [03:05:13]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	hackal	[03:05:49] And I was thinking if there is a way to "instantiate" a empty string and appending it. Not really sure how to that. [03:05:49]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:09:43] doing it dynamically is probably a bit advanced for your course level - the C code they gave you just creates a static array. you just need to create a zero-initialized area of the appropriate bytes, which i don't know the syntax in your assembler to do it but you probably learned it in class [03:09:43]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:15:29] looks like you want "input_sentence: .space 1001" and "word: .space 51" [03:15:29]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:15:39] in the .data section [03:15:39]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	hackal	[03:16:32] this is my current code https://gist.github.com/hackal/e193a0a0049470d144010a6b42869ae1 but its garbage at the moment. I am rewriting it. [03:16:32]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	hackal	[03:17:02] However I am not sure how to store the single bytes in a word defined in .data [03:17:02]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:18:15] load the address into a register, then use sb [03:18:15]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:22:28] or the index [03:22:28]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:23:56] i.e. you can use sb $AA, word($BB) to store byte $AA in index $BB of the word array, so you need both the byte and the index in registers [03:23:56]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:24:51] or just put the address itself in register $BB and use ($BB) alone [03:24:51]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:24:55] hackal: ^ [03:24:55]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	hackal	[03:25:56] I see, so does this "word: .space 51" instantiates an array of unknown length but with fixed length for each element? [03:25:56]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:31:58] no [03:31:58]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:32:14] it "instantiates" 51 bytes. [03:32:14]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:33:12] used in this context for an array of 51 one-byte elements [and with an odd size, an odd size preceding it, and no align statement, not useful for much else] [03:33:12]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	hackal	[03:34:25] Random832: thanks for help and advice, you helped me alot. I need to go now. [03:34:25]
2016-10-25 17:57:00	Random832	[03:34:56] ok [03:34:56]

2016-10-26 05:42:32	ds0	quick question about assembly (it's for improving my sec knowledge) - on the prolog, EBP (the Frame Pointer) is pushed on the stack, then ESP is copied into EBP making the new Frame Pointer.  So when people refer to the saved frame pointer (SFP) do they mean the EBP that was first pushed on the stack or the new Frame Pointer?

2016-10-26 05:47:47	vulture	I've not heard this acronym (SFP) before so that's probably a bad sign
2016-10-26 05:48:10	vulture	saved usually means a register value you wrote to the stack to save it so that you can overwrite the register
2016-10-26 05:48:17	vulture	so that is a pretty reasonable educated guess :P
2016-10-26 05:49:10	ds0	vulture yeah i thought so thanks, it's from the classic "smashing the stack for fun and profit" phrack article - http://phrack.org/issues/49/14.html#article
2016-10-26 05:49:15	chr1s	that would be my interpretation too
2016-10-26 05:49:36	chr1s	saved = on the stack
2016-10-26 05:50:38	ds0	does anyone here know of an acronym that references the esp from the previous frame that has been saved on the stack?
2016-10-26 05:50:38		[05:50]
2016-10-26 05:51:08	vulture	frame pointer ?
2016-10-26 05:51:16	vulture	(since in your scenario it gets moved to ebp)
2016-10-26 05:51:44	vulture	(side note: saving the frame pointer in ebp is an antiquated practice that is often avoided these days, cuz optimization)
2016-10-26 05:52:08	ds0	ah i see so there's no term for the previous frame pointer? it's just literally this is the FP for function_1, this is the FP for function_2?
2016-10-26 05:52:15	zid	parent fp?
2016-10-26 05:52:33	vulture	what you said was not previous frame pointer
2016-10-26 05:52:35	ds0	vulture: yeah it's from '96 so i expected stuff to be different now
2016-10-26 05:52:37	vulture	what you said was esp
2016-10-26 05:52:45	vulture	esp isnt really the frame pointer
2016-10-26 05:52:57	ds0	opps meant EBP
2016-10-26 05:52:58	vulture	ebp used like that is technically the frame pointer
2016-10-26 05:53:10	ds0	me being an idiot sorry
2016-10-26 05:53:12	vulture	:D
2016-10-26 05:53:46	vulture	well, you just have an array or a stack of stack frames
2016-10-26 05:53:53	vulture	and those may or may not have these saved frame pointers
2016-10-26 05:54:11	vulture	so whatever you want to call that, it doesnt really matter
2016-10-26 05:55:05	ds0	okay cheers for the help :)

2016-10-26 09:43:37	fizzie	[12:53:03] You could write a macro for byte-swapping (with <<, >>, &, |), and use that with dw, dd. (A little questionable if that's worth it.) [12:53:03]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	control	[13:04:42] Good, thanks. [13:04:42]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	hackal	[13:18:36] GeDaMo: is it the same with store byte instruction? The incrementing [13:18:36]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	GeDaMo	[13:18:50] hackal: yes [13:18:50]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	hackal	[13:18:52] sb $t2, 0($s0) [13:18:52]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	GeDaMo	[13:19:11] Normally you would make the constant the base address of the string / buffer [13:19:11]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	hackal	[13:19:16] next time I want to store something in $s0 I just increment it right? [13:19:16]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	GeDaMo	[13:19:30] The register would start at 0 and you'd increment it [13:19:30]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	traceur920	[13:24:43] Hello, I've written some code to make a shift light that receive as input a square wave with a period of 23 to 5 ms and reacts lighting up two LEDs when conditions are met. I'm quite new at this, first time with an AVR (attiny13a), second with assembly, and can't understand why LED keeps flickering instead of just be on or off [13:24:43]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	traceur920	[13:24:55] this is the code http://pastebin.com/2ZU697M9 [13:24:55]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	GeDaMo	[13:27:55] traceur920: you seem to be jumping back to loop instead of returning from the interrupts [13:27:55]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	traceur920	[13:29:05] yes, i know, but i manually enable global interrupt later, so, even being horrible, should work (i suppose) [13:29:05]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	GeDaMo	[13:29:34] I would have though you were overflowing the stack [13:29:34]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	GeDaMo	[13:29:37] ^thought [13:29:37]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	traceur920	[13:31:41] Ah, but for avr putting PC to stack doesn't have to be done manually ? so that, if you don't do it, it just lose the previous position? [13:31:41]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	GeDaMo	[13:32:32] Traditionally interrupts save the current state on the stack, I'll admit I don't know if AVR does that [13:32:32]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	traceur920	[13:34:07] I'm not sure, but will try putting RETI at the end instead of RJMP [13:34:07]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	traceur920	[13:36:55] Another contextual (dumb) question: when in sleep and an interrupt occurs, does PC start from its vector respective memory address or just go on from last sleep request? [13:36:55]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	archivist	[13:37:32] whatever the manual states [13:37:32]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	traceur920	[13:53:44] Ok, as i can understand from datasheet of the tiny13 it seems to jump back to predefined vector memory address. While simulating with AVR Studio it does not. Actually it doesn't even wait for pin level changes to exit from "sleep". It just goes on [13:53:44]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	roxfan	[14:08:08] iirc there's #avr channel, you could try that [14:08:08]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	roxfan	[14:08:35] it's quite possible the emulator doesn't handle sleep stuff [14:08:35]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	traceur920	[14:09:23] sure, thank you anyway! [14:09:23]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	ds0	[15:42:32] quick question about assembly (it's for improving my sec knowledge) - on the prolog, EBP (the Frame Pointer) is pushed on the stack, then ESP is copied into EBP making the new Frame Pointer.  So when people refer to the saved frame pointer (SFP) do they mean the EBP that was first pushed on the stack or the new Frame Pointer? [15:42:32]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	ds0	[15:46:40] I'm assuming it's the one that was pushed on the stack? because after prolog the esp register contains the value for the current stack? [15:46:40]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	vulture	[15:47:28] ds0: probably the old one (i.e. the one that was saved) [15:47:28]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	vulture	[15:47:47] I've not heard this acronym (SFP) before so that's probably a bad sign [15:47:47]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	vulture	[15:48:10] saved usually means a register value you wrote to the stack to save it so that you can overwrite the register [15:48:10]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	vulture	[15:48:17] so that is a pretty reasonable educated guess :P [15:48:17]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	ds0	[15:49:10] vulture yeah i thought so thanks, it's from the classic "smashing the stack for fun and profit" phrack article - http://phrack.org/issues/49/14.html#article [15:49:10]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	chr1s	[15:49:15] that would be my interpretation too [15:49:15]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	chr1s	[15:49:36] saved = on the stack [15:49:36]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	ds0	[15:50:38] does anyone here know of an acronym that references the esp from the previous frame that has been saved on the stack? [15:50:38]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	vulture	[15:51:07] frame pointer ? [15:51:07]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	vulture	[15:51:16] (since in your scenario it gets moved to ebp) [15:51:16]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	vulture	[15:51:44] (side note: saving the frame pointer in ebp is an antiquated practice that is often avoided these days, cuz optimization) [15:51:44]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	ds0	[15:52:08] ah i see so there's no term for the previous frame pointer? it's just literally this is the FP for function_1, this is the FP for function_2? [15:52:08]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	zid	[15:52:15] parent fp? [15:52:15]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	vulture	[15:52:33] what you said was not previous frame pointer [15:52:33]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	ds0	[15:52:35] vulture: yeah it's from '96 so i expected stuff to be different now [15:52:35]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	vulture	[15:52:37] what you said was esp [15:52:37]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	vulture	[15:52:45] esp isnt really the frame pointer [15:52:45]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	ds0	[15:52:57] opps meant EBP [15:52:57]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	vulture	[15:52:58] ebp used like that is technically the frame pointer [15:52:58]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	ds0	[15:53:10] me being an idiot sorry [15:53:10]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	vulture	[15:53:12] :D [15:53:12]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	vulture	[15:53:46] well, you just have an array or a stack of stack frames [15:53:46]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	vulture	[15:53:53] and those may or may not have these saved frame pointers [15:53:53]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	vulture	[15:54:11] so whatever you want to call that, it doesnt really matter [15:54:11]
2016-10-26 09:43:37	ds0	[15:55:05] okay cheers for the help :) [15:55:05]

2016-10-26 12:54:15	GeDaMo	[13:19:30] The register would start at 0 and you'd increment it [13:19:30]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	traceur920	[13:24:43] Hello, I've written some code to make a shift light that receive as input a square wave with a period of 23 to 5 ms and reacts lighting up two LEDs when conditions are met. I'm quite new at this, first time with an AVR (attiny13a), second with assembly, and can't understand why LED keeps flickering instead of just be on or off [13:24:43]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	traceur920	[13:24:55] this is the code http://pastebin.com/2ZU697M9 [13:24:55]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	GeDaMo	[13:27:55] traceur920: you seem to be jumping back to loop instead of returning from the interrupts [13:27:55]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	traceur920	[13:29:05] yes, i know, but i manually enable global interrupt later, so, even being horrible, should work (i suppose) [13:29:05]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	GeDaMo	[13:29:34] I would have though you were overflowing the stack [13:29:34]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	GeDaMo	[13:29:37] ^thought [13:29:37]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	traceur920	[13:31:41] Ah, but for avr putting PC to stack doesn't have to be done manually ? so that, if you don't do it, it just lose the previous position? [13:31:41]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	GeDaMo	[13:32:32] Traditionally interrupts save the current state on the stack, I'll admit I don't know if AVR does that [13:32:32]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	traceur920	[13:34:07] I'm not sure, but will try putting RETI at the end instead of RJMP [13:34:07]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	traceur920	[13:36:55] Another contextual (dumb) question: when in sleep and an interrupt occurs, does PC start from its vector respective memory address or just go on from last sleep request? [13:36:55]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	archivist	[13:37:32] whatever the manual states [13:37:32]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	traceur920	[13:53:44] Ok, as i can understand from datasheet of the tiny13 it seems to jump back to predefined vector memory address. While simulating with AVR Studio it does not. Actually it doesn't even wait for pin level changes to exit from "sleep". It just goes on [13:53:44]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	roxfan	[14:08:08] iirc there's #avr channel, you could try that [14:08:08]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	roxfan	[14:08:35] it's quite possible the emulator doesn't handle sleep stuff [14:08:35]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	traceur920	[14:09:23] sure, thank you anyway! [14:09:23]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	ds0	[15:42:32] quick question about assembly (it's for improving my sec knowledge) - on the prolog, EBP (the Frame Pointer) is pushed on the stack, then ESP is copied into EBP making the new Frame Pointer.  So when people refer to the saved frame pointer (SFP) do they mean the EBP that was first pushed on the stack or the new Frame Pointer? [15:42:32]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	ds0	[15:46:40] I'm assuming it's the one that was pushed on the stack? because after prolog the esp register contains the value for the current stack? [15:46:40]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	vulture	[15:47:28] ds0: probably the old one (i.e. the one that was saved) [15:47:28]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	vulture	[15:47:47] I've not heard this acronym (SFP) before so that's probably a bad sign [15:47:47]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	vulture	[15:48:10] saved usually means a register value you wrote to the stack to save it so that you can overwrite the register [15:48:10]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	vulture	[15:48:17] so that is a pretty reasonable educated guess :P [15:48:17]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	ds0	[15:49:10] vulture yeah i thought so thanks, it's from the classic "smashing the stack for fun and profit" phrack article - http://phrack.org/issues/49/14.html#article [15:49:10]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	chr1s	[15:49:15] that would be my interpretation too [15:49:15]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	chr1s	[15:49:36] saved = on the stack [15:49:36]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	ds0	[15:50:38] does anyone here know of an acronym that references the esp from the previous frame that has been saved on the stack? [15:50:38]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	vulture	[15:51:07] frame pointer ? [15:51:07]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	vulture	[15:51:16] (since in your scenario it gets moved to ebp) [15:51:16]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	vulture	[15:51:44] (side note: saving the frame pointer in ebp is an antiquated practice that is often avoided these days, cuz optimization) [15:51:44]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	ds0	[15:52:08] ah i see so there's no term for the previous frame pointer? it's just literally this is the FP for function_1, this is the FP for function_2? [15:52:08]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	zid	[15:52:15] parent fp? [15:52:15]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	vulture	[15:52:33] what you said was not previous frame pointer [15:52:33]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	ds0	[15:52:35] vulture: yeah it's from '96 so i expected stuff to be different now [15:52:35]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	vulture	[15:52:37] what you said was esp [15:52:37]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	vulture	[15:52:45] esp isnt really the frame pointer [15:52:45]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	ds0	[15:52:57] opps meant EBP [15:52:57]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	vulture	[15:52:58] ebp used like that is technically the frame pointer [15:52:58]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	ds0	[15:53:10] me being an idiot sorry [15:53:10]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	vulture	[15:53:12] :D [15:53:12]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	vulture	[15:53:46] well, you just have an array or a stack of stack frames [15:53:46]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	vulture	[15:53:53] and those may or may not have these saved frame pointers [15:53:53]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	vulture	[15:54:11] so whatever you want to call that, it doesnt really matter [15:54:11]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	ds0	[15:55:05] okay cheers for the help :) [15:55:05]
2016-10-26 12:54:15	CharlesN	[22:36:29] is there a mov instruction that only moves 1 byte  ? for x86 [22:36:29]

2016-10-27 17:07:20	kaos	[20:31:30] mlep [20:31:30]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	dminuoso	[20:43:55] So why does intel want me to write "ptr" in "qword ptr" for example... :| [20:43:55]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	dminuoso	[20:43:58] It's like.. why? [20:43:58]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	vulture_	[20:50:13] dminuoso: use nasm and stop QQing [20:50:13]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	dminuoso	[20:50:30] :o [20:50:30]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	dminuoso	[20:50:32] oh. [20:50:32]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	dminuoso	[20:50:43] vulture, I actually did not realize.. [20:50:43]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	vulture	[20:54:21] the reason older assemblers used 'ptr' is because 'ptr' is an operator to modify the 'qword' with the thing on the right of it [20:54:21]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	asla	[02:43:44] hello, silly question, not sure if anyone's here. i'm reading program memory but not sure how tell sections apart [02:43:44]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	L4B	[02:46:23] asla: The sections needn't be loaded contiguously. It's the OS loader that knows where it put them. [02:46:23]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	L4B	[02:46:58] Similarly, how do you tell variables apart just by looking at memory. Well, you know where they are a priori. [02:46:58]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	asla	[02:47:40] Okay, say I have identified the main module base address and would like identify the virtual address at which the .text section is loaded [02:47:40]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	asla	[02:47:53] is that possible ? [02:47:53]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	L4B	[02:50:25] What OS is this? [02:50:25]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	asla	[02:50:34] windows 8 [02:50:34]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	L4B	[02:51:20] I believe the default virtual address of processes on Windows is 0x004000000. [02:51:20]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	L4B	[02:51:49] (Each process can have the same, sincee it's virtual.) [02:51:49]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	L4B	[02:52:41] I'm not sure, though. I don't really use Windows. [02:52:41]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	asla	[02:53:11] Yeah, that correct [02:53:11]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	asla	[02:54:37] i'm trying to inject code and patch something so I have to search for a certain pattern then patch it [02:54:37]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	asla	[02:55:05] i need to search .text section only otherwise i risk patching irrelevant things [02:55:05]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	asla	[02:56:13] I have a program dumper (Process-Dump) which seems to dump the sections correctly but i'm just not sure how it's working [02:56:13]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	L4B	[02:57:16] asla: Have you tried objdump --headers ? [02:57:16]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	asla	[02:59:22] i don't think that's gonna work - program is packed [02:59:22]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	asla	[02:59:40] I need to dump it from memory after it unpacks [02:59:40]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	L4B	[03:06:21] I'm sorry, I'm at work and can't really pay attention to IRC. [03:06:21]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	L4B	[03:06:37] brb 30 mins [03:06:37]
2016-10-27 17:07:20	L4B	[03:06:40] Sorry. [03:06:40]

2016-10-27 22:29:45	vulture_	[19:20:13] but [19:20:13]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	vulture_	[19:20:22] does that provide some way to inject somehow [19:20:22]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	vulture_	[19:20:30] how do I get from A to B [19:20:30]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	vulture_	[19:21:26] maybe some app that takes a WM that runs shit I throw at it past UIPI ? [19:21:26]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	AverageJ0e	[19:22:36] github to the rescue [19:22:36]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	vulture_	[19:23:35] did you find something [19:23:35]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	AverageJ0e	[19:25:44] Sorry, but here's everything there is to know about UIPI http://www.coseinc.com/en/index.php?rt=download&act=publication&file=Vista_UIPI.ppt.pdf [19:25:44]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	AverageJ0e	[19:26:54] if i could remember the name of the thing, i could send you an md5 [19:26:54]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	AverageJ0e	[19:27:09] look it up and download it offa VT for reversing [19:27:09]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	vulture_	[19:29:29] hmm, WM_TIMER maybe? not sure that would work for all apps tho [19:29:29]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	vulture_	[19:37:51] doesnt really explain anything unfortunately :( [19:37:51]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	vulture_	[19:37:58] rather, doesnt suggest any attacks [19:37:58]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	vulture_	[19:50:42] oh, did that shithead antares guy finally get K:lined? Lol [19:50:42]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	vulture_	[19:50:53] took freenode long enough [19:50:53]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	vulture_	[19:51:02] think I reportde that like a month or two ago [19:51:02]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	AverageJ0e	[19:56:43] who [19:56:43]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	vulture_	[19:57:16] some spammer that never gets banned frmo here or freenode [19:57:16]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	vulture_	[19:57:22] pastes urls then leaves [19:57:22]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	kaos	[20:31:30] mlep [20:31:30]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	dminuoso	[20:43:55] So why does intel want me to write "ptr" in "qword ptr" for example... :| [20:43:55]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	dminuoso	[20:43:58] It's like.. why? [20:43:58]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	vulture_	[20:50:13] dminuoso: use nasm and stop QQing [20:50:13]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	dminuoso	[20:50:30] :o [20:50:30]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	dminuoso	[20:50:32] oh. [20:50:32]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	dminuoso	[20:50:43] vulture, I actually did not realize.. [20:50:43]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	vulture	[20:54:21] the reason older assemblers used 'ptr' is because 'ptr' is an operator to modify the 'qword' with the thing on the right of it [20:54:21]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	asla	[02:43:44] hello, silly question, not sure if anyone's here. i'm reading program memory but not sure how tell sections apart [02:43:44]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	L4B	[02:46:23] asla: The sections needn't be loaded contiguously. It's the OS loader that knows where it put them. [02:46:23]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	L4B	[02:46:58] Similarly, how do you tell variables apart just by looking at memory. Well, you know where they are a priori. [02:46:58]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	asla	[02:47:40] Okay, say I have identified the main module base address and would like identify the virtual address at which the .text section is loaded [02:47:40]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	asla	[02:47:53] is that possible ? [02:47:53]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	L4B	[02:50:25] What OS is this? [02:50:25]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	asla	[02:50:34] windows 8 [02:50:34]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	L4B	[02:51:20] I believe the default virtual address of processes on Windows is 0x004000000. [02:51:20]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	L4B	[02:51:49] (Each process can have the same, sincee it's virtual.) [02:51:49]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	L4B	[02:52:41] I'm not sure, though. I don't really use Windows. [02:52:41]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	asla	[02:53:11] Yeah, that correct [02:53:11]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	asla	[02:54:37] i'm trying to inject code and patch something so I have to search for a certain pattern then patch it [02:54:37]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	asla	[02:55:05] i need to search .text section only otherwise i risk patching irrelevant things [02:55:05]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	asla	[02:56:13] I have a program dumper (Process-Dump) which seems to dump the sections correctly but i'm just not sure how it's working [02:56:13]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	L4B	[02:57:16] asla: Have you tried objdump --headers ? [02:57:16]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	asla	[02:59:22] i don't think that's gonna work - program is packed [02:59:22]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	asla	[02:59:40] I need to dump it from memory after it unpacks [02:59:40]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	L4B	[03:06:21] I'm sorry, I'm at work and can't really pay attention to IRC. [03:06:21]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	L4B	[03:06:37] brb 30 mins [03:06:37]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	L4B	[03:06:40] Sorry. [03:06:40]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	Demon_Fox	[07:16:06] Out of curiosity, how does threading mess up caching? [07:16:06]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	archivist	[07:17:21] think about it, who is doing the threading and who/what the caching [07:17:21]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	Demon_Fox	[07:17:56] Honestly, I'm not exactly sure how smart modern OS's are [07:17:56]
2016-10-27 22:29:45	Demon_Fox	[07:27:42] Plus, how different things factor in [07:27:42]

2016-10-28 04:45:34	zid	to subtraction?
2016-10-28 04:45:38	vulture	are you talking about c or asm
2016-10-28 04:45:41	vulture	or something else
2016-10-28 04:46:09	vulture	and if you have a dll, you could just inject the dll, or the sections relevant
2016-10-28 04:47:09	asla	i'm trying to use CreateRemoteThread
2016-10-28 04:47:26	asla	So, i copy the data and the code then execute

2016-10-28 04:51:32	vulture	then most bets are off unless you inject the whole dll

2016-10-28 04:52:34	vulture	your easiest avenues are to inject the whole dll, or make a stub with asm (convert to a char array in C) that you inject just the stub and run that
2016-10-28 04:54:05	asla	i guess i'll try injecting a whole dll first
2016-10-28 04:55:22	vulture	there are a dozen ways to do that, hopefully you pick one of the working ways ;)

2016-10-28 05:20:05	asla	Yeah, i thought so too
2016-10-28 05:20:05	vulture	I mean, you can, potentially, if you're really careful
2016-10-28 05:20:12	vulture	but there are so many reasons why you shouldnt
2016-10-28 05:20:22	asla	like ?
2016-10-28 05:21:03	vulture	e.g. if you're injecting, to hook a function. maybe someone else plans to hook the same function. but you hooked it. so they hook YOU, thinking it's that other function. now you're hooked. if you unload yourself, then you've broken the hook chain and can cause crashes in the process
2016-10-28 05:21:48	asla	right

2016-10-28 11:26:16	asla	[14:50:14] haven't figured out that yet [14:50:14]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	vulture	[14:51:01] [09.42.28] <vulture> asla: what's the problem, end-start = size :P [14:51:01]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	vulture	[14:51:04] [09.45.41] <vulture> are you talking about c or asm [14:51:04]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	vulture	[14:51:10] didnt get an answer [14:51:10]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	asla	[14:51:16] sorry, c [14:51:16]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	vulture	[14:51:32] then most bets are off unless you inject the whole dll [14:51:32]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	vulture	[14:51:46] especially if using modern c compiler features [14:51:46]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	asla	[14:51:58] hmm, okay, thanks [14:51:58]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	vulture	[14:52:34] your easiest avenues are to inject the whole dll, or make a stub with asm (convert to a char array in C) that you inject just the stub and run that [14:52:34]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	asla	[14:54:05] i guess i'll try injecting a whole dll first [14:54:05]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	vulture	[14:55:22] there are a dozen ways to do that, hopefully you pick one of the working ways ;) [14:55:22]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	asla	[15:11:33] i think it's gonna take me some time to research vulture ;-p but i've got this somewhere and it looks decent http://pastie.org/10951780 [15:11:33]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	boru	[15:12:06] Many have tried, and failed, to research vulture. [15:12:06]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	zid	[15:12:37] good news, I only crashed IDA twice trying to make an 11kB struct [15:12:37]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	boru	[15:13:35] Conspiracy. [15:13:35]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	zid	[15:13:52] I think I'm du e for some kind of special sticker and a trip to mcdonalds [15:13:52]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	vulture	[15:19:53] asla: good enough. dont bother unloading your dll though. it will cause problems [15:19:53]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	asla	[15:20:05] Yeah, i thought so too [15:20:05]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	vulture	[15:20:05] I mean, you can, potentially, if you're really careful [15:20:05]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	vulture	[15:20:12] but there are so many reasons why you shouldnt [15:20:12]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	asla	[15:20:22] like ? [15:20:22]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	vulture	[15:21:03] e.g. if you're injecting, to hook a function. maybe someone else plans to hook the same function. but you hooked it. so they hook YOU, thinking it's that other function. now you're hooked. if you unload yourself, then you've broken the hook chain and can cause crashes in the process [15:21:03]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	asla	[15:21:48] right [15:21:48]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	vulture	[15:22:02] here's a good read on a very similar topic (window hooking) https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20031111-00/?p=41883 [15:22:02]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	vulture	[15:22:41] specifically, the second meaty paragraph with the bold words [15:22:41]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	asla	[15:26:57] thanks vulture [15:26:57]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	asla	[15:27:10] and zid, i'm quite new to patching, thanks for asking ;-p [15:27:10]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	hackal_	[15:31:36] Hi, is there a way to test assembly code? Test in a way you would for example test java code. [15:31:36]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	vulture	[15:31:43] run it? [15:31:43]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	vulture	[15:31:55] yes it works the same way as any unit test [15:31:55]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	vulture	[15:32:01] throw inputs at it, test outputs [15:32:01]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	L4B	[15:35:41] That was a weird question. [15:35:41]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	zid	[15:36:01] L4B: almost all of them here are [15:36:01]

2016-10-28 11:26:16	vulture	[15:37:42] sup boggs [15:37:42]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	hackal_	[15:38:48] sorry, for weird question. I am new to assembly and I am just generally curious, I might have more stupid questions but don't want to look like a retard. [15:38:48]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	Love4Boobies	[15:40:09] Not much. How are you? [15:40:09]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	kaos	[20:59:01] its possible to set the 8253 chip to generate sinusodial waves... aaah [20:59:01]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	kaos	[20:59:10] does that even make sense? [20:59:10]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	kaos	[20:59:24] (it is used to drive the irq0) [20:59:24]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	zid	[20:59:36] the pit? I doubt it [20:59:36]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	zid	[20:59:48] You could put a capacitor or two in front of it probably though [20:59:48]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	zid	[20:59:54] make yourself a ghetto sine [20:59:54]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	kaos	[20:59:59] haha [20:59:59]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	kaos	[21:01:35] i found my old web page that i wrote when i was a teenager. i found a note there that implied that it was possible to generate other waves than square ones. and i have a faint memory of that being true [21:01:35]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	zid	[21:02:39] It has a square wave mode [21:02:39]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	zid	[21:02:45] throw a little cap on that should do it [21:02:45]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	kaos	[21:04:25] i like to think that IBM made their original PC from scrap parts they found in other projects, and that one of those parts were a programmable wave-generator, that could do a bit more than what was needed [21:04:25]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	kaos	[21:04:39] whatever [21:04:39]
2016-10-28 11:26:16	kaos	[21:05:23] i am/was probably wrong [21:05:23]

2016-10-28 12:28:09	vulture	[15:21:03] e.g. if you're injecting, to hook a function. maybe someone else plans to hook the same function. but you hooked it. so they hook YOU, thinking it's that other function. now you're hooked. if you unload yourself, then you've broken the hook chain and can cause crashes in the process [15:21:03]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	asla	[15:21:48] right [15:21:48]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	vulture	[15:22:02] here's a good read on a very similar topic (window hooking) https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20031111-00/?p=41883 [15:22:02]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	vulture	[15:22:41] specifically, the second meaty paragraph with the bold words [15:22:41]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	asla	[15:26:57] thanks vulture [15:26:57]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	asla	[15:27:10] and zid, i'm quite new to patching, thanks for asking ;-p [15:27:10]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	hackal_	[15:31:36] Hi, is there a way to test assembly code? Test in a way you would for example test java code. [15:31:36]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	vulture	[15:31:43] run it? [15:31:43]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	vulture	[15:31:55] yes it works the same way as any unit test [15:31:55]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	vulture	[15:32:01] throw inputs at it, test outputs [15:32:01]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	L4B	[15:35:41] That was a weird question. [15:35:41]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	zid	[15:36:01] L4B: almost all of them here are [15:36:01]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	 *	Love4Boobies [15:36:26] shrugs. [15:36:26]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	vulture	[15:37:42] sup boggs [15:37:42]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	hackal_	[15:38:48] sorry, for weird question. I am new to assembly and I am just generally curious, I might have more stupid questions but don't want to look like a retard. [15:38:48]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	Love4Boobies	[15:40:09] Not much. How are you? [15:40:09]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	kaos	[20:59:01] its possible to set the 8253 chip to generate sinusodial waves... aaah [20:59:01]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	kaos	[20:59:10] does that even make sense? [20:59:10]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	kaos	[20:59:24] (it is used to drive the irq0) [20:59:24]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	zid	[20:59:36] the pit? I doubt it [20:59:36]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	zid	[20:59:48] You could put a capacitor or two in front of it probably though [20:59:48]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	zid	[20:59:54] make yourself a ghetto sine [20:59:54]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	kaos	[20:59:59] haha [20:59:59]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	kaos	[21:01:35] i found my old web page that i wrote when i was a teenager. i found a note there that implied that it was possible to generate other waves than square ones. and i have a faint memory of that being true [21:01:35]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	zid	[21:02:39] It has a square wave mode [21:02:39]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	zid	[21:02:45] throw a little cap on that should do it [21:02:45]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	kaos	[21:04:25] i like to think that IBM made their original PC from scrap parts they found in other projects, and that one of those parts were a programmable wave-generator, that could do a bit more than what was needed [21:04:25]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	kaos	[21:04:39] whatever [21:04:39]
2016-10-28 12:28:09	kaos	[21:05:23] i am/was probably wrong [21:05:23]

2016-10-28 22:16:37	vulture	[14:51:32] then most bets are off unless you inject the whole dll [14:51:32]
2016-10-28 22:16:37	vulture	[14:51:46] especially if using modern c compiler features [14:51:46]
2016-10-28 22:16:37	asla	[14:51:58] hmm, okay, thanks [14:51:58]
2016-10-28 22:16:37	vulture	[14:52:34] your easiest avenues are to inject the whole dll, or make a stub with asm (convert to a char array in C) that you inject just the stub and run that [14:52:34]
2016-10-28 22:16:37	asla	[14:54:05] i guess i'll try injecting a whole dll first [14:54:05]
2016-10-28 22:16:37	vulture	[14:55:22] there are a dozen ways to do that, hopefully you pick one of the working ways ;) [14:55:22]
2016-10-28 22:16:37	asla	[15:11:33] i think it's gonna take me some time to research vulture ;-p but i've got this somewhere and it looks decent http://pastie.org/10951780 [15:11:33]
2016-10-28 22:16:37	boru	[15:12:06] Many have tried, and failed, to research vulture. [15:12:06]
2016-10-28 22:16:37	zid	[15:12:37] good news, I only crashed IDA twice trying to make an 11kB struct [15:12:37]
2016-10-28 22:16:37	boru	[15:13:35] Conspiracy. [15:13:35]
2016-10-28 22:16:37	zid	[15:13:52] I think I'm du e for some kind of special sticker and a trip to mcdonalds [15:13:52]
2016-10-28 22:16:37	vulture	[15:19:53] asla: good enough. dont bother unloading your dll though. it will cause problems [15:19:53]
2016-10-28 22:16:37	asla	[15:20:05] Yeah, i thought so too [15:20:05]
2016-10-28 22:16:37	vulture	[15:20:05] I mean, you can, potentially, if you're really careful [15:20:05]
2016-10-28 22:16:37	vulture	[15:20:12] but there are so many reasons why you shouldnt [15:20:12]
2016-10-28 22:16:37	asla	[15:20:22] like ? [15:20:22]

2016-10-28 22:29:29	vulture	[14:52:34] your easiest avenues are to inject the whole dll, or make a stub with asm (convert to a char array in C) that you inject just the stub and run that [14:52:34]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	asla	[14:54:05] i guess i'll try injecting a whole dll first [14:54:05]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	vulture	[14:55:22] there are a dozen ways to do that, hopefully you pick one of the working ways ;) [14:55:22]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	asla	[15:11:33] i think it's gonna take me some time to research vulture ;-p but i've got this somewhere and it looks decent http://pastie.org/10951780 [15:11:33]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	boru	[15:12:06] Many have tried, and failed, to research vulture. [15:12:06]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	zid	[15:12:37] good news, I only crashed IDA twice trying to make an 11kB struct [15:12:37]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	boru	[15:13:35] Conspiracy. [15:13:35]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	zid	[15:13:52] I think I'm du e for some kind of special sticker and a trip to mcdonalds [15:13:52]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	vulture	[15:19:53] asla: good enough. dont bother unloading your dll though. it will cause problems [15:19:53]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	asla	[15:20:05] Yeah, i thought so too [15:20:05]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	vulture	[15:20:05] I mean, you can, potentially, if you're really careful [15:20:05]
2016-10-28 22:29:29	vulture	[15:20:12] but there are so many reasons why you shouldnt [15:20:12]

2016-10-29 05:21:47	_sfiguser	hello all, i programmed in the past in assembly for 8051 and some other processors... i want to learn about x86 and x86_64 assembly with gnu as assembly where can i start ?  and does the syntax change if i use Nasm instead of gnu as  ?

2016-10-29 05:26:19	Jester02	and a debugger :)
2016-10-29 05:26:48	Jester02	then start writing small programs

2016-10-29 05:54:06	vulture	I feel more like masm is designed for machine output (one of the same reasons I hate at&t :P) and it uses archaic syntax which is also nonsense, like how brackets have nothing to do with memory vs immediate (liked that feature to distinguish them), and how cl's .asm output doesnt "just work" with masm sometimes for whatever reason(??)

2016-10-29 11:17:30	emihir0	hello, on one of my courses we make a java compiler for C, that is, we take a subset of C code, tokenise/parse it, name analyse it, type check it and finally we are supposed to transform it into MIPS instructions. I have trouble with one task, hopefully you guys can help me out. One of the built in functions is: void print_s(const char* s) which basically is supposed to print out a string.
2016-10-29 11:17:30		[11:17]
2016-10-29 11:18:03	emihir0	Other functions are: void print_i(int i) and void print_c(char c), I have implemented the 3 (not sure if right) and so here is the code:

2016-10-29 11:19:31	emihir0	this works fine for print_c and print_i, but I have trouble thinking of a way to make it also work for print_s. Basically the only argument I want to pass on is a pointer to a char array

2016-10-29 11:20:10	emihir0	but inside my actual print_s implementation, I also need "size" or "length" argument, ie. to know when to stop the loop. How can I do this? ie. find the length from the pointer itself?
2016-10-29 11:20:52	Jester02	strings are usually zero terminated

2016-10-29 11:23:34	emihir0	and of course, move the pointer
2016-10-29 11:23:59	Jester02	exactly
2016-10-29 11:24:09	emihir0	but then, when I call print_s, I pass the pointer into $a0, but print_c also expect the arg to be in $a0

2016-10-29 11:24:42	emihir0	so when i enter print_s i should move the $a0 to a temp register?
2016-10-29 11:24:50	emihir0	and then $a0 will hold the actual char for print_c?
2016-10-29 11:25:09	Jester02	yes (except you need to make sure your temp register is not clobbered by print_c)
2016-10-29 11:25:30	Jester02	you seem to understand everything so why isn't it done yet :D
2016-10-29 11:26:02	emihir0	... it helps to write the thoughts out :d
2016-10-29 11:26:47	emihir0	well, in my compiler I have a "stack" of available registers (ie. temp ones), so once I'm done with print_s, at the very end i can "free" (ie. push it back to the stack of free registers) the temp one i used there
2016-10-29 11:26:56	emihir0	whenever i need a register i just pop one from the stack...
2016-10-29 11:27:08	hackal	Or you could use $a0 but at the start of print_c save the $a0 to stack and at the end load it back, what do you think about that?

2016-10-29 18:39:15	Jester02	[21:44:50] line 21 should be just unconditional back [21:44:50]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[21:45:04] yes, the check is not needed now [21:45:04]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[21:45:17] as it's already checked in 18, makes sense [21:45:17]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[21:47:20] the problem is that when now I call beqz	$a0, exit [21:47:20]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[21:47:22] it goes: [21:47:22]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[21:47:26] exit: jr	$ra [21:47:26]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[21:47:33] but this exit just exits the loop [21:47:33]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[21:47:35] not actual print_s [21:47:35]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	Jester02	[21:47:35] yeah [21:47:35]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	Jester02	[21:47:41] you need to save $ra [21:47:41]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	Jester02	[21:47:58] because jal overwrites it [21:47:58]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[21:48:14] hmm, makes sense [21:48:14]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[21:48:45] hmm, is it a "good practise" to actually call print_c? i mean, we could just replicate the print_c exact behaviour inside the print_s [21:48:45]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[21:48:50] that way print_c woulnd' thave to be called [21:48:50]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	Jester02	[21:48:52] sure [21:48:52]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	Jester02	[21:49:06] but in general you should know how to write non-leaf functions :) [21:49:06]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[21:49:24] non-leaf? [21:49:24]

2016-10-29 18:39:15	Jester02	[21:49:50] hey emihir0 do you know mips?:D [21:49:50]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[21:50:22] I mean, technically no [21:50:22]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[21:50:36] practically, I am a fast learner :D [21:50:36]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[21:52:53] I mean, I did this at the begining of print_s (just where I also saved $a0 to $t1) - la	$t2, ($ra), then at exit label I called jr $t2 instead of jr $ra [21:52:53]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[21:53:11] it works now, but I don't know if I did it in the proper (best practises) way [21:53:11]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	Jester02	[21:55:06] well in general you need to use the stack [21:55:06]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	Jester02	[21:56:36] you typically follow a calling convention that says which registers are caller and callee saved [21:56:36]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[22:28:20] Jester02 - kind of unrelated to asm, but maybe you can help me out. When I tokenise my C file, and I encounter something like '\n' - I make this a literal new line token (ie. when printed, it prints new line, not \n). However, now when I am turning tokens into MIPS, I want to print '\n' instead of '<new line>'. Any idea on how I can check if a given char is escaped char, and if it is, escape it? [22:28:20]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[22:28:29] ie. so I turn literal new line back to \n [22:28:29]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	Jester02	[22:39:52] not sure what causes you problem with that [22:39:52]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	Jester02	[22:39:55] many ways to do it [22:39:55]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[23:02:40] Jester02 I mean, I can make a big table containing all the combinations, but that's kinda "hackish" solution I think? Surely there must be a way to determine whether a character is escaped or not within java... [23:02:40]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	Jester02	[23:03:13] there wasn't a single mention of "java" in your question ;) [23:03:13]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[23:03:36] oh, my bad =) [23:03:36]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[23:05:50] basically, we have C code string, e.g. "abc\n", this I turn into StringToken, which when printed (toString()), it prints abc and a literal new line, e.g. if it were "a\nb", the b would be on a new line. This was part of our requirement (to make it behave this way...) [23:05:50]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	zid	[23:06:21] so it's.. a string [23:06:21]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[23:06:27] now however, when I want to use this string in mips, I want it back to the original form, ie. "abc\n" (or rather, this would relate only to chars, so '\n')... but I'm not sure what's the best way to do it [23:06:27]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	zid	[23:06:36] you want to escape a string, then [23:06:36]
2016-10-29 18:39:15	emihir0	[23:06:39] yes, it's a string that has some escaped chars [23:06:39]

2016-10-29 20:52:10	ctxz	I know the 8259A Is a bit dated by now, but I've gotten seriously into interrupts, specifically Hardware Interrupts and I can't seem to get one thing clear. AFAIK the 8259A can handle multiple interrupt requests (8 to be precise if there is no slave). Now what I don't get is 1. How exactly does data inside the ISR look like after passing the priority resolver, and 2. If there are multiple interrupts, the most

2016-10-29 23:10:09	Jester02	[23:03:13] there wasn't a single mention of "java" in your question ;) [23:03:13]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	emihir0	[23:03:36] oh, my bad =) [23:03:36]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	emihir0	[23:05:50] basically, we have C code string, e.g. "abc\n", this I turn into StringToken, which when printed (toString()), it prints abc and a literal new line, e.g. if it were "a\nb", the b would be on a new line. This was part of our requirement (to make it behave this way...) [23:05:50]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	zid	[23:06:21] so it's.. a string [23:06:21]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	emihir0	[23:06:27] now however, when I want to use this string in mips, I want it back to the original form, ie. "abc\n" (or rather, this would relate only to chars, so '\n')... but I'm not sure what's the best way to do it [23:06:27]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	zid	[23:06:36] you want to escape a string, then [23:06:36]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	emihir0	[23:06:39] yes, it's a string that has some escaped chars [23:06:39]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	zid	[23:06:52] https://www.google.co.uk/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=fisVWP2-Ccrv8Af10LagCA#q=java+escape+string [23:06:52]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	kaos	[23:07:49] how is this asm [23:07:49]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	Jester02	[23:08:28] he added an "off topic" disclaimer :) [23:08:28]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	emihir0	[23:08:30] ... sorry, I got carried away and explained a problem to more detail than I should have (in an asm chat) :P [23:08:30]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	emihir0	[23:08:50] thanks btw @zid, had no idea about that library [23:08:50]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	zid	[23:09:03] google is a library? [23:09:03]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	emihir0	[23:09:40] no, I meant the specific class StringEscapeUtils [23:09:40]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	emihir0	[23:10:20] I was trying to google it before mentioning it here, trust me, I was just googling wrong phrases... [23:10:20]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	zid	[23:10:58] I recommend "offtopic, but can someone please tell me what the word is for turning literal characters into things like \n" [23:10:58]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	Amun_Ra	[02:07:18] zid: escaping characters? [02:07:18]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	KidBeta	[05:17:31] does anyone know a good tut / guide for reverse engineering Objective C OSX applications im kinda okay at Windows C++/C apps but im stuck on how some of the more advanced stuff in Objective-C works under the covers at the ASM layer, I know this is only tangentially related to ASM but the guys in #RE are kinda take the whole silence thing seriously. [05:17:31]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	klys	[05:21:12] kidbeta, would clang/llvm's assembler have something like binutils' objdump -d ? [05:21:12]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	KidBeta	[05:21:56] im using hopper at the moment (which is like a poor mans IDA for OSX) and I get some of the stuff its just stuff like msgsend is breaking my brain. Ill have a look at see if I can make more sense of it using objdump [05:21:56]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	klys	[05:22:28] it's just a disassembly listing [05:22:28]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	KidBeta	[05:24:29] ive got the disassembly what im having trouble with is tracking down a function and specifically working out what one does [05:24:29]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	KidBeta	[05:24:52] luckily ObjC has very descriptive function names (at least in this case) but the function doesnt seem to do anything ? [05:24:52]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	KidBeta	[05:27:53] http://pastebin.com/uHY5M27W is the function, the random leave halfway through the function is kinda tripping me out [05:27:53]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	klys	[05:37:22] kidbeta, you know the value is returned in eax right, and you know what imul does? [05:37:22]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	KidBeta	[06:16:45] klys yeah man :) its just that i kinda expected a lot more code for a function thats meant to flash the firmware on a HDD. [06:16:45]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	klys	[06:17:29] kidbeta, I'm sure the function that does that is somewhere else [06:17:29]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	KidBeta	[06:17:41] That was my suspicion too once I saw it [06:17:41]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	KidBeta	[06:18:05] Theres a couple others that look like they might but I cant see anything that seems to issue commands that would do something like flash firmware [06:18:05]
2016-10-29 23:10:09	KidBeta	[06:20:12] http://pastebin.com/DPtVSVxz was my other thought for what did the actual update, the only problem is I have no idea how to follow the sendmsg calls to find the actual functions its using. [06:20:12]

2016-10-30 01:42:33	DearVolt	Hello everyone :) I'm feeling a little hopeless at this point so hoping someone could please help me. Syntax: Intel x64. Code: main.c http://pastebin.com/m4nfAKJT linkNodes.asm http://pastebin.com/MAHVQMCq and finally the problem: I'm implementing a graph and everything seems to work fine except for some crazy corner case. If I change main.c:37 to iterate one less time everything works great except for that one missing edge. If I leave
2016-10-30 01:42:33	DearVolt	it as is, I get a seg fault. It seems like my one edge is overwriting the other but I have single stepped through the program (GDB) and checked that all is fine.
2016-10-30 01:44:32	DearVolt	linkNodes.asm lines 73-100 are basically a copy of lines 40 - 67. The source with a makefile can be downloaded at http://noekie.com/source.zip - If I add the edge (link) to one node instead of both then it works fine. It seems to be just that one edge A->C.

2016-10-30 01:46:40	DearVolt	There's something wrong with the array of edges, links.

2016-10-30 02:13:14	DearVolt	Yes, that one. It behaves correctly in most function calls. What do you think is wrong? Perhaps r9 (The offset into the array) isn't the correct size? I've tried checking that when single stepping though.
2016-10-30 02:13:57	edcba	anyway nrOfLinks shouldn't be size_t

2016-10-30 02:24:57	zid	dminuoso: It's easier to perform the check
2016-10-30 02:25:20	dminuoso_	zid: As long as you dont do x >= 0 checks you are fine.
2016-10-30 02:25:23	zid	DearVolt: The basic issue is that your link count goes out of sync with your link array, at some point
2016-10-30 02:25:24	DearVolt	zid: Could you please tell me on which function call it crashed for you?
2016-10-30 02:25:37	zid	a to D
2016-10-30 02:25:45	DearVolt	Yes, I figured as much. Having trouble identifying where/how though. And thank you!
2016-10-30 02:25:54	edcba	dminuoso: just semantically a count and a size isn't the same
2016-10-30 02:25:58	DearVolt	You worded it very well though.
2016-10-30 02:26:17	GeDaMo	I still think you shouldn't rely on r9 being unchanged by the call to realloc
2016-10-30 02:26:43	DearVolt	Okay, I'll change that as well GeDaMo. Thank you :)
2016-10-30 02:26:44	edcba	but i didn't know there was no more appropriate type than size_t :(

2016-10-30 02:27:05	zid	it isn't fucked internally at least, your code just does a thing wrong
2016-10-30 02:27:29	dminuoso_	DearVolt: rbx, rsp, rbp, r12, r13, r14, and r15 are the registers System V ABI guarantees to be preserved.
2016-10-30 02:27:37	dminuoso_	DearVolt: All others can be freely clobbered.
2016-10-30 02:27:42	DearVolt	Yes, D is overwriting C.
2016-10-30 02:27:55	zid	that's not good.
2016-10-30 02:28:20	zid	yea shouldn't A's 2nd link be 2.1 not 3.3
2016-10-30 02:28:36	zid	so yea, something is writing something wrong somewhere.
2016-10-30 02:28:53	zid	also you're using realloc wrong.
2016-10-30 02:28:54	zid	still.
2016-10-30 02:29:10	DearVolt	Yes. So my r9 value is incorrect in that function call. Let me change to a memory location and see if it's being clobbered.
2016-10-30 02:29:33	DearVolt	What am I doing wrong with realloc?
2016-10-30 02:29:41	DearVolt	Not checking for failure?

2016-10-30 02:30:29	zid	I've not read the code carefully, because I can't be bothered, but memory corruption + calling realloc almost always means you used realloc wrong. Specifically, realloc can return a different pointer to the one you gave it. so every place that pointer is used needs updating
2016-10-30 02:30:34	zid	which may cause your links to point to stale data.
2016-10-30 02:30:47	DearVolt	That was it!
2016-10-30 02:31:01	zid	and you're definitely not error checking it, so I'd wager you're also not consistency checking it
2016-10-30 02:31:33	DearVolt	But I do update the place that pointer is used, zid. What do you mean by the memory corruption part?
2016-10-30 02:32:08	zid	I mean this causes a lot of memory corrpution.
2016-10-30 02:32:08	DearVolt	Thank you so much GeDaMo, dminuoso and zid. I've definitely learnt to stick to those registers preserved across function calls.
2016-10-30 02:32:17	zid	both just by looking at the output, and memory check tools
2016-10-30 02:32:18	DearVolt	And edcba :)
2016-10-30 02:32:26	GeDaMo	DearVolt: what was the problem?
2016-10-30 02:32:55	DearVolt	Like Valgrind? It was r9 not being preserved, GeDaMo. But only for one function call. I guess that's why it can't be guaranteed,
2016-10-30 02:33:03	GeDaMo	Ah
2016-10-30 02:33:15	zid	http://codepad.org/uQYTILV5
2016-10-30 02:33:31	Jester02	also note that they are not just preserved for you, you must also preserve them for your caller (haven't checked the code)
2016-10-30 02:33:49	edcba	hehe
2016-10-30 02:33:49	zid	That's a pretty good number of errors for a small snippet of code, gj :P
2016-10-30 02:34:09	edcba	there are all the same, structs aren't initialized
2016-10-30 02:34:33	zid	so the part he didn't post had issues too? grand.
2016-10-30 02:34:42	DearVolt	Wow, that output is quite intimidating. And yes, I leave the memory I allocate for the structs as all zeroes. Is that bad? I don't really have default values.
2016-10-30 02:34:52	zid	you can't "leave" memory zeros
2016-10-30 02:34:56	zid	you have to SET it to zeros.
2016-10-30 02:35:09	zid	that's why calloc and memset exist
2016-10-30 02:35:11	edcba	yeah you should really initialize them yourself
2016-10-30 02:35:41	zid	although for pointers even that isn't enough technically (in practice it will be, though)
2016-10-30 02:35:46	DearVolt	Ah, my bad. I thought I read on the man pages it's all zeroes. It was telling me that at compile time at a stage as well.

2016-10-30 02:36:12	DearVolt	And Jester01, I'm sorry, but I'm not quite sure I understand? You mean pushing those register values onto the stack before calling any other functions?
2016-10-30 02:36:19	DearVolt	*Jester02
2016-10-30 02:36:26	zid	DearVolt: If it's your first call to malloc it'll probably be zeros, because the OS gives you zero'd memory, but if you free() something then malloc() again, you'll almost always get the memory you just freed back again
2016-10-30 02:36:45	zid	which will be full of whatever you filled it with before you freed it
2016-10-30 02:36:57	dminuoso_	^- the only guarantee you can draw from this, is that its impossible to leak "memory" into other processes.
2016-10-30 02:37:08	zid	which, in your case, will be valid but incorrect data, meaning you'll end up with fucked up links or names or something
2016-10-30 02:37:14	zid	which is why "Use after free" exploits are so dangerous
2016-10-30 02:37:16	DearVolt	Ah, I see. I rely on that in the code though. So I don't need to malloc a bigger array, memcpy and then free.
2016-10-30 02:37:30	zid	they almost always cause phantom but valid data to reappear
2016-10-30 02:37:33	Jester02	I mean, if you want to use a callee-saved register because its value is preserved by a function you call, you must also preserve it for your caller, you can't just use it
2016-10-30 02:38:31	DearVolt	Ah I see, makes sense. Wow, I'm learning a lot! Assembly has been fun but there's so much stuff I still have to learn, it's a little overwhelming.

2016-10-30 02:47:19	edcba	no
2016-10-30 02:47:22	zid	and then compare the binary

2016-10-30 02:52:27	DearVolt	I get the hashing part. Not too sure about inside the if? Seems like it's checking the columns of a 2D bucket before removing them?
2016-10-30 02:52:34	zid	err that should be *pb not pb on the conditional
2016-10-30 02:53:00	edcba	i would strcmp in condition of for loop
2016-10-30 02:53:13	zid	DearVolt: It's doing a->b->c  ->   a->c, free(b)

2016-10-30 03:01:35	zid	I'd use calloc
2016-10-30 03:02:09	edcba	you didn't free anything anyway
2016-10-30 03:02:30	zid	realloc might though, is the point, you can't replace realloc with malloc
2016-10-30 03:02:34	zid	it has to be with free and malloc
2016-10-30 03:03:00	edcba	you didn't call some "deallocateNode"
2016-10-30 03:03:21	zid	edcba: he does call realloc though, which is malloc(); memcpy(); free90:
2016-10-30 03:03:46	edcba	f the new size of the memory object would require movement of the object, the space for the previous instantiation of the object is freed.
2016-10-30 03:04:06	DearVolt	In the C they give us, they don't call any of our code after the output, so I can't free it anywhere. I was thinking realloc would do what zid just said so I shouldn't have memory leaks other than the nodes themselves not being deallocated.
2016-10-30 03:04:30	DearVolt	So calloc, memcpy and free, zid?
2016-10-30 03:04:46	zid	if you want to reimplement realloc yourself, yea. Or you could just call realloc.
2016-10-30 03:06:01	GeDaMo	Maybe they expect you to free all your memory before exiting
2016-10-30 03:06:06	DearVolt	So leave it as it? I have absolutely no idea why I'm getting 0. My code works for their test case and some of mine.
2016-10-30 03:06:12	edcba	anyway calling allocation in asm is stupid
2016-10-30 03:06:15	zid	'some of mine' :P
2016-10-30 03:06:25	edcba	but it's homework...
2016-10-30 03:06:28	DearVolt	@GeDaMo: They don't call any of our code before exiting though. So I can't free anywhere after the output.
2016-10-30 03:06:55	DearVolt	All of mine I mean hahaha. But there's only a bit (2 different graphs), so some.
2016-10-30 03:07:12	DearVolt	"One further note on marks, Fitchfork will test if you dynamically grow your link arrays

2016-10-30 03:08:04	zid	testing for lost memory, presumably
2016-10-30 03:08:22	edcba	yeah they just want at end of main same memory than at start
2016-10-30 03:08:54	zid	DearVolt: Given that the struct declaration is part of the interface, they should be capable of freeing it themselves.
2016-10-30 03:09:19	edcba	yeah that's why it's again a stupid exercise
2016-10-30 03:09:19		[03:09]
2016-10-30 03:09:23	DearVolt	I think they meant they don't want you leaving stray allocated memory when growing your links array.
2016-10-30 03:09:39	DearVolt	Which I'm sure I avoided with realloc.
2016-10-30 03:10:00	edcba	you still should unalloc at end
2016-10-30 03:10:04	zid	He can't.
2016-10-30 03:10:10	edcba	links
2016-10-30 03:10:14	edcba	not nodes

2016-10-30 03:10:35	edcba	he need not the end he needs the start
2016-10-30 03:10:51	DearVolt	Yeah, my functions are called before the output that uses those structs and arrays, so I can't deallocate before they are used.
2016-10-30 03:10:51	zid	Freeing his links at the start is no good :P
2016-10-30 03:11:08	edcba	why ? it's a calloced ptr

2016-10-30 03:12:43	edcba	first time it realloc(null)

2016-10-30 03:13:09	zid	what's a "those" and who is "it"
2016-10-30 03:13:13	DearVolt	I do alloc nodes. But I'm not able to free anything after the printfs since the main doesn't call any of my functions.

2016-10-30 03:15:37	DearVolt	It's slightly more complicated than just stdout, but still not very advanced. Was developed by students a few years ago. No one likes it.
2016-10-30 03:15:50	edcba	just detect the main caller in stack and hook it to free everything :p
2016-10-30 03:16:54	zid	edcba: You'd have to be able to leak the tests back to yourself
2016-10-30 03:16:59	zid	which may not be possible
2016-10-30 03:17:51	DearVolt	I think I'll have to resort to emailing the lecturer. I still have another 11 upload attempts, but I'm all out of ideas on why I could be getting 0.

2016-10-30 03:24:01	dirar	I know it goes through a string (eax) but i don't know what it does after.

2016-10-30 10:23:12	bkboggy	In MIPS, a jump instruction, j, uses word addressing.  So, if we say j 2000, it's jumping to address 8000.  Why is that load word, lw, and store word, sw, do not do the same?  Those two use byte addressing, so to get the 4th element of an array, for example, I'd have to do something like lw $t0, 16($s0) where $s0 is the beginning address of an array.  Since we're loading a word, wouldn't it make sense for it to be lw $t0, 4($s0)
2016-10-30 10:23:26	bkboggy	Not very consistent, it seems.
2016-10-30 10:23:38	Jester02	instructions are fixed word size

2016-10-30 10:23:54	Jester02	it makes sense to not waste storing the two low bits that are known zero
2016-10-30 10:24:02	bkboggy	But if we're loading a word, it would be four bytes as well.
2016-10-30 10:24:05	Jester02	data however is byte granular
2016-10-30 10:24:38	bkboggy	Or are they giving us freedom in deciding where those 4 bytes start?
2016-10-30 10:24:43	Jester02	yes
2016-10-30 10:24:53	bkboggy	So, if I want to be stupid, I could do lw $t0, 15($s0)
2016-10-30 10:25:04	Jester02	that's not necessarily stupid
2016-10-30 10:25:10	Jester02	depending on what's in $s0
2016-10-30 10:25:24	bkboggy	$s0 is the starting address of an array.
2016-10-30 10:25:33	bkboggy	And we know we're loading words, since we're using lw
2016-10-30 10:25:33	Jester02	yes, I mean, it can be byte granular too
2016-10-30 10:25:39	Jester02	1+3=4
2016-10-30 10:25:41	Jester02	for example ;)
2016-10-30 10:26:04	Jester02	furthermore, the lw is part of an instruction family that uses the same encoding
2016-10-30 10:26:09	zid	If all addresses had to be aligned then all opcodes would do it
2016-10-30 10:26:12	bkboggy	I mean, they have load byte..
2016-10-30 10:26:21	Jester02	yes and lb uses the same encoding
2016-10-30 10:26:32	bkboggy	Right, but it makes sense to do byte addressing when you're loading a byte.
2016-10-30 10:26:36	Jester02	yes
2016-10-30 10:26:45	Jester02	but since it's the same encoding, lw inherits that too
2016-10-30 10:26:45	bkboggy	But when you're loading a word, it seems that it's expected that you would address it in words.

2016-10-30 10:57:45	_sfiguser	hello all, i'm reading the gas assembly docs here https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/ but i cannot find a bare minimum example for x86 arch and x86_64 architecture... i mean a simple hello world... how can one read the docs and cannot write a simple pgm ?
2016-10-30 10:58:08	zid	because it's an assembler, a tool
2016-10-30 10:58:16	zid	the manual for a keyboard doesn't teach you english.
2016-10-30 10:58:19	Holonium	Hello
2016-10-30 10:59:38	Jester02	also it depends on OS/environment
2016-10-30 10:59:42	Holonium	I was wondering if anybody could provide some resources to learn x64 fasm syntax?
2016-10-30 11:00:27	Holonium	It is an Intel C2D CPU
2016-10-30 11:00:43	zid	don't use fasm
2016-10-30 11:00:55	Holonium	what should I use
2016-10-30 11:01:02	zid	a real assembler? nasm for example

2016-10-30 11:01:27	zid	nasm uses mostly the same syntax as the manual for your cpu does
2016-10-30 11:01:43	Holonium	where do i find a manual for my cpu
2016-10-30 11:01:51	zid	intel.com instruction set reference A and B
2016-10-30 11:03:02	Holonium	do i download the zip file
2016-10-30 11:03:18	zid	what the fuck has intel done to its website
2016-10-30 11:03:45	zid	http://www.intel.co.uk/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-manual-325462.pdf
2016-10-30 11:03:58	Holonium	no, do i download the nasm rcl zip or the win 64 file
2016-10-30 11:04:26	zid	I don't know what you're talking about.
2016-10-30 11:04:37	Holonium	on the nasm download page
2016-10-30 11:04:44	zid	nasm.us? sourceforge?
2016-10-30 11:05:11	zid	http://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.12.02/
2016-10-30 11:05:15	zid	that looks good.
2016-10-30 11:05:29	Holonium	i did not realize that it was on sourceforge
2016-10-30 11:05:44	Holonium	i have it now
2016-10-30 11:07:08	Holonium	thanks for the help. if i understand correctly it uses the intel reference syntax
2016-10-30 11:07:25	zid	yea you an omit the ptrs and stuff though
2016-10-30 11:07:32	zid	and just use dword [eax]
2016-10-30 11:08:06	Holonium	thanks for all the help. i have been trying to learn for some time now.

2016-10-30 12:21:16	boru	zid; QED.
2016-10-30 12:21:23	dr_pepper	I just need help on how to use the cmp command

2016-10-30 12:22:15	dr_pepper	when I do " CMP R4, 'a' " it doesnt work
2016-10-30 12:22:30	dr_pepper	I am trying to compare register 4 with the letter A
2016-10-30 12:23:01	dr_pepper	but when i do that an error says "Error: immediate expression requires a # prefix -- `cmp R4,10'"
2016-10-30 12:23:12	zid	have you considered giving the immediate expression a # prefix
2016-10-30 12:23:19	boru	What's ARM? Never heard of it.
2016-10-30 12:23:26	dr_pepper	does that mean I can just put a # and the ascii value of the letter a?
2016-10-30 12:23:44	dr_pepper	But wouldnt it just compare it with the integer 10?
2016-10-30 12:24:00	dr_pepper	im sorry, not 10, 97
2016-10-30 12:24:05	zid	that's.. what you wanted to do

2016-10-30 12:24:26	dr_pepper	i want to compare it with a character
2016-10-30 12:24:33	zid	you might want to consider how character sets work
2016-10-30 12:25:18	dr_pepper	will just going " CMP R4, #97 " work?
2016-10-30 12:29:26	dr_pepper	I was thinking i would have to go " CMP R4, $a " and then going " .equ a, 'a' "

2016-10-30 12:30:45	zid	if you're not dealing with ascii, your values won't match of course
2016-10-30 12:30:59	zid	which is why you may wish to use 'a' over 97, so your source is more portable

2016-10-30 15:50:11	_sfiguser	to me it's not clear what actyally happens in the linking phase... i mean... i have as input the object file, which represent the raw machine instruction which i should give to the CPU, but here what happends ?  how can i reference libraries ?
2016-10-30 15:52:15	vulture	object file isnt raw machine instructions
2016-10-30 15:52:40	vulture	it's a bunch of symbols, maybe some raw code, but mostly symbols and references that will get glued together at the linker stage
2016-10-30 15:53:39	vulture	for example, mov eax,symbol  ==> b8 <32 bit symbol>  (rather than being resolved already)  and then linker translates that into a more resolved version (note: maybe not actually be resolved until runtime)

2016-10-30 15:59:00	zid	So it really generates 'call <MessageBoxA's address>' in the .o file, and the linker, while producing the final output, performs all the relocations, organizes what is going to live where in memory, maybe does a final optimization step (throwing away duplicate copies of functions, etc), and generates the .exe/elf/whatever

2016-10-31 00:22:50	Broken|PC	[02:51:55] hey guys , anyone want to make hacker group whitehat with us , come on in ##shellcoder [02:51:55]
2016-10-31 00:22:50	heelpmeplz	[05:36:01] With the Irvine32 library, does anyone know I can validate the result of ReadHex, to ensure the input was not larger than 32 bits? [05:36:01]
2016-10-31 00:22:50	bcos_	[05:53:13] heelpmeplz: It's easier to just assume the source code is shit; but if you're bored you should be able to check the source code to guarantee it's shit [05:53:13]
2016-10-31 00:22:50	bcos_	[05:56:25] heelpmeplz: https://sourceforge.net/p/along32/code/ci/master/tree/src/Along32.asm#l952 [05:56:25]
2016-10-31 00:22:50	bcos_	[05:56:42] ^ if that's it, then it's worse than shit [05:56:42]
2016-10-31 00:22:50	heelpmeplz	[05:56:52] pretty sure that's not it [05:56:52]
2016-10-31 00:22:50	bcos_	[05:57:19] (that's supposed to be a Linux port of the Irvine32 library) [05:57:19]
2016-10-31 00:22:50	heelpmeplz	[05:57:24] oh [05:57:24]
2016-10-31 00:22:50	heelpmeplz	[05:57:42] well, I'm not an expert.  I'm trying to do an assignment but I don't know how to do that. [05:57:42]
2016-10-31 00:22:50	bcos_	[05:57:56] Hmm. [05:57:56]
2016-10-31 00:22:50	bcos_	[05:58:31] Can I assume "trying to do an assigment" implies that your code can be shit (e.g. can be code that crashes if/when result of ReadHex is not validated)? [05:58:31]
2016-10-31 00:22:50	heelpmeplz	[05:58:47] no, I have to check the result [05:58:47]
2016-10-31 00:22:50	bcos_	[05:59:14] What is the exact wording used for the assignment? [05:59:14]
2016-10-31 00:22:50	bcos_	[05:59:53] - e.g. does it say "check the result (e.g. that carry is not set)" or does it say "validate properly (e.g. that there were no overflows or invalid characters)"? [05:59:53]
2016-10-31 00:22:50	bcos_	[06:00:37] ..because [06:00:37]
2016-10-31 00:22:50	bcos_	[06:01:17] Former means a simple "jc .resultWasBad", while latter means you're probably going to need to write "pre-validation" routine that checks everything before calling "ReadHex" [06:01:17]
2016-10-31 00:22:50	bcos_	[06:01:27] (or after, I guess) [06:01:27]
2016-10-31 00:22:50	bcos_	[06:01:45] D'oh [06:01:45]
2016-10-31 00:22:50	bcos_	[06:02:43] ..and that code is so bad that it'd probably be easier to just do "validate properly (and convert to hex at the same time)" without using the lib [06:02:43]
2016-10-31 00:22:50	bcos_	[06:04:12] (e.g. if the input is "0x12a3" it will return a wrong result because of an masively stupid "character 'a' is beyond end of table" bug) [06:04:12]
2016-10-31 00:22:50	bcos_	[06:05:16] Actually... [06:05:16]

2016-10-31 01:31:05	heelpmeplz	[05:56:52] pretty sure that's not it [05:56:52]
2016-10-31 01:31:05	bcos_	[05:57:19] (that's supposed to be a Linux port of the Irvine32 library) [05:57:19]
2016-10-31 01:31:05	heelpmeplz	[05:57:24] oh [05:57:24]
2016-10-31 01:31:05	heelpmeplz	[05:57:42] well, I'm not an expert.  I'm trying to do an assignment but I don't know how to do that. [05:57:42]
2016-10-31 01:31:05	bcos_	[05:57:56] Hmm. [05:57:56]
2016-10-31 01:31:05	bcos_	[05:58:31] Can I assume "trying to do an assigment" implies that your code can be shit (e.g. can be code that crashes if/when result of ReadHex is not validated)? [05:58:31]
2016-10-31 01:31:05	heelpmeplz	[05:58:47] no, I have to check the result [05:58:47]
2016-10-31 01:31:05	bcos_	[05:59:14] What is the exact wording used for the assignment? [05:59:14]
2016-10-31 01:31:05	bcos_	[05:59:53] - e.g. does it say "check the result (e.g. that carry is not set)" or does it say "validate properly (e.g. that there were no overflows or invalid characters)"? [05:59:53]
2016-10-31 01:31:05	bcos_	[06:00:37] ..because [06:00:37]
2016-10-31 01:31:05	bcos_	[06:01:17] Former means a simple "jc .resultWasBad", while latter means you're probably going to need to write "pre-validation" routine that checks everything before calling "ReadHex" [06:01:17]
2016-10-31 01:31:05	bcos_	[06:01:27] (or after, I guess) [06:01:27]
2016-10-31 01:31:05	bcos_	[06:01:45] D'oh [06:01:45]
2016-10-31 01:31:05	bcos_	[06:02:43] ..and that code is so bad that it'd probably be easier to just do "validate properly (and convert to hex at the same time)" without using the lib [06:02:43]
2016-10-31 01:31:05	bcos_	[06:04:12] (e.g. if the input is "0x12a3" it will return a wrong result because of an masively stupid "character 'a' is beyond end of table" bug) [06:04:12]

2016-10-31 08:57:20	Random832	also the quotient's not likely to *not* be negative, it's a question of being off by one from what you were expecting, not wrong sign.

2016-10-31 09:07:25	David_	I have a signed number in a register.  I'm supposed to convert it to hex and print.  It seems to me I'm supposed to divide by 16 over and over, converting the remainder to ASCII.  Unfortunately, the remainder could be negative.  How do I handle this?
2016-10-31 09:07:59	GeDaMo	Save the sign and convert the absolute value
2016-10-31 09:08:10	zid	^
2016-10-31 09:08:19	zid	test if it's negative, print a -, invert the sign
2016-10-31 09:08:42	GeDaMo	Also dividing by a power of two can be accomplished by a right shift
2016-10-31 09:08:59	David_	is there any place I can save the sign which is not eax,ebx,ecx,edx, or di?  Can I put the sign in si?

2016-10-31 13:41:57	GeDaMo	[13:11:58] Hi Baby5 :) [13:11:58]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	Baby5	[13:16:22] hahah yo bro, im from indonesia  nice to chatt in thakss a loot [13:16:22]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	Baby5	[13:20:06] how to make looping in two sub program ? [13:20:06]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	dminuoso_	[13:20:56] Baby5: What are the control flow instructions that you know of? [13:20:56]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	zid	[13:21:19] a million ways, what are the requirements? [13:21:19]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	enso	[13:23:18] Thanks guys [13:23:18]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	David_	[18:49:39] If I idiv a negative number (say 1600) by 16, is the quotient negative, or the remainder, or both? [18:49:39]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	zid	[18:49:48] 1600 is negative today? [18:49:48]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	Jester02	[18:50:11] lol [18:50:11]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	GeDaMo	[18:50:39] Must be because it's halloween :P [18:50:39]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	Jester02	[18:51:24] "Non-integral results are truncated (chopped) towards 0. " [18:51:24]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	Jester02	[18:52:00] also, why didn't you just try it? [18:52:00]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	GeDaMo	[18:52:12] It's the only way to be sure [18:52:12]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	Random832	[18:56:40] zid: that and not a multiple of 16? the remainder isn't negative, it's zero. [18:56:40]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	Jester02	[18:57:17] apart from these, the question was fine :D [18:57:17]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	Random832	[18:57:20] also the quotient's not likely to *not* be negative, it's a question of being off by one from what you were expecting, not wrong sign. [18:57:20]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	zid	[18:57:53] Random832: maybe he bought a special ones complement intel cpu [18:57:53]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	Random832	[18:58:05] and remember that idiv has a double-sized dividend [18:58:05]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	Random832	[18:58:50] so take care of your {{e,r,}dx,ah} register [18:58:50]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	David_	[19:00:41] It was a typo, jesus, obviously I meant -1600 [19:00:41]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	David_	[19:00:45] and I got the answer [19:00:45]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	zid	[19:00:49] David_: it still has no remainder [19:00:49]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	David_	[19:00:57] ok then [19:00:57]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	David_	[19:07:25] I have a signed number in a register.  I'm supposed to convert it to hex and print.  It seems to me I'm supposed to divide by 16 over and over, converting the remainder to ASCII.  Unfortunately, the remainder could be negative.  How do I handle this? [19:07:25]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	GeDaMo	[19:07:59] Save the sign and convert the absolute value [19:07:59]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	zid	[19:08:10] ^ [19:08:10]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	zid	[19:08:19] test if it's negative, print a -, invert the sign [19:08:19]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	GeDaMo	[19:08:42] Also dividing by a power of two can be accomplished by a right shift [19:08:42]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	David_	[19:08:59] is there any place I can save the sign which is not eax,ebx,ecx,edx, or di?  Can I put the sign in si? [19:08:59]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	zid	[19:09:09] you don't need to if you do what I said [19:09:09]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	David_	[19:09:25] okay I get you [19:09:25]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	David_	[19:09:29] thx [19:09:29]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	David_	[19:14:11] I cannot just print the sign because I have other things to print before the final number is printed [19:14:11]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	David_	[19:48:49] I am running this code and getting error "A2022: instruction operands must be the same size".  I don't think I have anything with two operands where one is not a constant.  The line number on the error refers to a label, for some inexplicable reason.  Can anyone help me find this error?  http://pastebin.com/qacHZMiD [19:48:49]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	zid	[19:49:56] You might want to tell us which line [19:49:56]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	David_	[19:51:15] It's the line corresponding to the label, "M4" [19:51:15]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	David_	[19:51:22] is what the error keeps pointing at [19:51:22]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	zid	[19:51:58] I disagree [19:51:58]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	zid	[19:53:11] the line after is pretty fucked up though [19:53:11]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	David_	[19:54:06] oh I see [19:54:06]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	David_	[19:55:30] thanks lol [19:55:30]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	David_	[19:58:53] Can anyone run this and tell me if it builds?  I get this weird error with MASM:  "1>------ Build started: Project: Project, Configuration: Debug Win32 ------ [19:58:53]

2016-10-31 13:41:57	Random832	[20:33:32] David_: also, once you've done the "negative test, then print -" thing, use unsigned logic for everything else, or you're probably not gonna handle 0x80000000 correctly. [20:33:32]
2016-10-31 13:41:57	David_	[20:34:54] I appreciate all the advice.  I'm taking a break right now because I was getting frustrated, but I'll think about all of these things [20:34:54]

2016-10-31 16:21:00	GeDaMo	[19:08:42] Also dividing by a power of two can be accomplished by a right shift [19:08:42]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	David_	[19:08:59] is there any place I can save the sign which is not eax,ebx,ecx,edx, or di?  Can I put the sign in si? [19:08:59]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	zid	[19:09:09] you don't need to if you do what I said [19:09:09]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	David_	[19:09:25] okay I get you [19:09:25]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	David_	[19:09:29] thx [19:09:29]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	David_	[19:14:11] I cannot just print the sign because I have other things to print before the final number is printed [19:14:11]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	David_	[19:48:49] I am running this code and getting error "A2022: instruction operands must be the same size".  I don't think I have anything with two operands where one is not a constant.  The line number on the error refers to a label, for some inexplicable reason.  Can anyone help me find this error?  http://pastebin.com/qacHZMiD [19:48:49]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	zid	[19:49:56] You might want to tell us which line [19:49:56]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	David_	[19:51:15] It's the line corresponding to the label, "M4" [19:51:15]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	David_	[19:51:22] is what the error keeps pointing at [19:51:22]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	zid	[19:51:58] I disagree [19:51:58]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	zid	[19:53:11] the line after is pretty fucked up though [19:53:11]

2016-10-31 20:03:29	Love4Boobies	Reading an introductory book on the topic is always a good idea when you're just starting out something.
2016-10-31 20:03:42	PinkPing	yes i m starter
2016-10-31 20:03:59	Love4Boobies	Which platform are you interested in? Assembly isn't just one language---it's a family of languages.
2016-10-31 20:04:52	Love4Boobies	In particular, each architecture has its own.
2016-10-31 20:05:00	PinkPing	i use linux
2016-10-31 20:05:09	PinkPing	debian
2016-10-31 20:05:41	Love4Boobies	x86(-64), I presume?
2016-10-31 20:06:05	PinkPing	yes i use 64 bit

2016-10-31 20:15:28	Love4Boobies	PinkPing: There seem to be a few books out there that cover 64-bit assembly but I don't really know any of them so I can't vouch for them. If you want, I can recommend some on 32-bit assembly and you can work your way up from there (because the fundamentals are exactly the same; it's just the details that are different).
2016-10-31 20:16:06	PinkPing	ok then i will use 32 bit thanks
2016-10-31 20:21:27	Love4Boobies	You might want to try Professional Assembly Language by Richard Blum. Other popular books are the Art of Assembly Language, 2nd ed. by Randall Hyde (uses a high-level assembler), Introduction to 80x86 Assembly Language and Computer Architecture, 3rd ed. by Richard C. Detmer (uses Windows), and Assembly Language for x86 Processors, 7th ed. by Kip R. Irvine (uses Windows). They're all good books.

2016-10-31 20:22:04	PinkPing	thanks for help
2016-10-31 20:22:06	PinkPing	:)
2016-10-31 20:22:15	Love4Boobies	No problem.
2016-10-31 20:22:34	PinkPing	anyway there is a free booK?
2016-10-31 20:23:17	Love4Boobies	I mostly recommended the one I did out of those because (a) it's for Linux so it's less of a hassle, and (b) it uses a popular toolchain.
2016-10-31 20:23:51	Love4Boobies	The second one is good but doesn't use a popular toolchain and the rest are good but don't use Linux.
2016-10-31 20:24:14	PinkPing	first is most good?
2016-10-31 20:24:19	Love4Boobies	The second edition of the second book was free. You can still find it on the author's Web site.
2016-10-31 20:24:41	Love4Boobies	But you can probably find bootleg copies for any of them online.
2016-10-31 20:24:50	 *	Love4Boobies pretends he hasn't said anything.
2016-10-31 20:25:04	Love4Boobies	PinkPing: I'd say it's the most fit for you.

2016-10-31 22:52:27	boru	uBO and uM have made the web a bit more palatable again, but not by much, since sites seem to pull js crap from 20 different sites and break if one of them is down.
2016-10-31 22:52:38	boru	It's as if the entire web has become sourceforge.
2016-10-31 22:52:42	Love4Boobies	WebAssembly is in fact not a bad idea. It's a natural continuation for asm.js. I don't expect the advantages to sink in immediately.

2016-10-31 22:54:24	bcos	Erm. Most of this stuff (javascript, etc) fulfills an extremely important (and often under-estimated) purpose, and we'd all be screwed without it.

2016-10-31 22:57:57	Love4Boobies	At any rate, the point is that WebAssembly lets people portably execute things like C programs over the Web (and there are obvious advantages to doing that sometimes). As for JavaScript, it's actually a surprisingly useful general-purpose language.

2016-10-31 23:01:50	Love4Boobies	That way it's not the end of the world if they can't cover the costs of having a native code generator for some platform or another.
2016-10-31 23:02:07	boru	Which relies on remote resources, and foists requirements and dependencies onto the user locally.

2016-10-31 23:03:29	boru	I've had this discussion a thousand times. We're not going to agree.
2016-10-31 23:04:10	Love4Boobies	That's because you are looking to decide whether something is good or not independent of requirements/constraints.
2016-10-31 23:04:26	Love4Boobies	I think words like good or bad make no sense without them.
2016-10-31 23:04:53	boru	On the contrary, I have made my decision based on my requirements and perceived constraints.
2016-10-31 23:05:10	boru	Shoe horning the web into everything is unnecessary.
2016-10-31 23:05:24	boru	It's one-trick-pony-ism.

2016-10-31 23:06:17	boru	It seems like you're trying to convince me that shoe horning the web into everything is a good idea, no?
2016-10-31 23:06:24	archivist	I want my memory free for my use
2016-10-31 23:07:01	Love4Boobies	boru: I think you have an inability to read because I've suggested otherwise many times and even explicitly stated the opposite once.
2016-10-31 23:07:12	archivist	I want less data passed to client from the servers
2016-10-31 23:08:30	Love4Boobies	archivist: That's fair but not everything is memory-critical. For instance, if you were concerned about memory usage, you would probably never use high-level languages.
2016-10-31 23:08:50	boru	You're advocating it as being advantageous. I think you have the inability to read.
2016-10-31 23:08:52	Love4Boobies	archivist: However, you make a cost-benefit analysis. It's usually not expensive to be wasteful in certain bounds.

2016-10-31 23:09:54	boru	Sure, and as I've said, everything has its place. However, all of those web nonsense is pervasive and permeating into places it has no business being.
2016-10-31 23:10:21	Love4Boobies	Sometimes people pick the wrong solutions. The fault doesn't lie with the technology itself.
2016-10-31 23:11:17	Love4Boobies	I do think that the permeating does quite often make sense, though.
2016-10-31 23:11:23	boru	Yeah, pissing away memory, bandwidth, cycles isn't the fault of the technology...
2016-10-31 23:11:46	boru	We have lots of those these days, might as well use all of them for executing javascript corba enterprise shite!

2016-10-31 23:15:17	Love4Boobies	:)
2016-10-31 23:17:24	boru	WRT an engineer's mindset, an engineer would pick the solution which fits the requirements; there's no allgience to certain points of views on my part, just that I've never once in my life come across a problem where the best solution was web based.
2016-10-31 23:18:11	boru	I'd say the allegience is where web based technologies are all the engineer knows cf. one-trick-pony-ism above.

2016-11-01 06:24:35	paule32	like an native application that run under linux ....
2016-11-01 06:25:06	boru	If it's native, why does it require JNI at all?

2016-11-01 06:25:48	boru	Sounds like you should just get an ARMv7 development board, and install some android flavour on that, and do your testing there.
2016-11-01 06:25:49	paule32	JNI is the interface, which helps to make c/c++ programms to native ARMv7 binaries
2016-11-01 06:26:09	boru	That is not correct.

2016-11-01 14:47:13	Jester02	you have already been told the functions may be clobbering R2 and R3
2016-11-01 14:47:13		[14:47]
2016-11-01 14:47:14	moogoom	zid: did you figure anything else out?
2016-11-01 14:47:19	moogoom	how though
2016-11-01 14:47:20	Jester02	since you are not using the debugger, you can't test that
2016-11-01 14:47:27	Jester02	so just save them to be sure.
2016-11-01 14:47:33	moogoom	I know they arent
2016-11-01 14:47:44	moogoom	my proffesor tested them out himself
2016-11-01 14:47:48	zid	does it print non-zero if you put a 7 in there yourself
2016-11-01 14:47:48	Jester02	note that standard calling convention says otherwise.
2016-11-01 14:48:00	Jester02	called functions are ALLOWED to do that
2016-11-01 14:48:17	Jester02	in any case it doesn't hurt to save and restore them
2016-11-01 14:48:40	Jester02	and for the initial zeroing, it's pointless and counter-productive to do that before invoking the functions
2016-11-01 14:48:47	moogoom	i'm confused
2016-11-01 14:48:51	Jester02	so just move lines 6-9 to 15.
2016-11-01 14:49:03	Jester02	that should take care of the initial stuff

2016-11-01 14:49:16	moogoom	okay
2016-11-01 14:49:30	moogoom	what else could I do
2016-11-01 14:49:31	Jester02	at exit, just comment out the "BL stro" and see if the correct value isthen printed
2016-11-01 14:49:45	Jester02	if the stro indeed clobbers registers, that should fix it
2016-11-01 14:49:56	Jester02	other than that, you need a debugger to see where it goes wrong.
2016-11-01 14:50:07	Jester02	that's what WE would do too, except we are not gonna do it for you.
2016-11-01 14:50:16	moogoom	oh i understand
2016-11-01 14:50:25	moogoom	so
2016-11-01 14:50:34	moogoom	comment out line 53?
2016-11-01 14:50:39	Jester02	yes
2016-11-01 14:50:44	moogoom	and move lines 6-9 to after 15
2016-11-01 14:50:51	Jester02	yes
2016-11-01 14:51:00	moogoom	what will happen then
2016-11-01 14:51:08	Jester02	if nothing else is broken, that should print your number of vowels
2016-11-01 14:51:17	Jester02	without the prompt (just the number)
2016-11-01 14:51:28	moogoom	yeah
2016-11-01 14:51:47	Jester02	if THAT works, you can then save and restore the R3 register around that stro call
2016-11-01 14:52:05	moogoom	could I just do that now to save time
2016-11-01 14:52:08	moogoom	if it is the case
2016-11-01 14:52:13	Jester02	sure.

2016-11-01 14:52:51	moogoom	do i use .equ vowels, R3

2016-11-01 18:08:11	bkboggy	In regards to MIPS, according to my book, ALUOp is set to 10 for R-Type instructions, such as add.  Well... add opcode is 0, so how can ALUOp be 10, if ID_EX latch control signal portion gets it's highest 6 bits (all 0's), and ALUOp is 2 of those bits ([2 bits -> WB][3 bits -> M][1 bit -> RegDst][2 bits -> ALUOp][1 bit -> ALUSrc]
2016-11-01 18:08:22	bkboggy	Here's a table with explanation from my book: https://s13.postimg.org/9wupq35s7/Resized_20161101_210153.jpg
2016-11-01 18:09:20	bkboggy	Does control unit set it to 10 when it receives those 6 bits?

2016-11-01 18:09:46	bkboggy	Because those top 6 bits to the latch come from control unit, which gets those from the IR of the fetch stage.

2016-11-02 00:56:10	bkboggy	[04:08:11] In regards to MIPS, according to my book, ALUOp is set to 10 for R-Type instructions, such as add.  Well... add opcode is 0, so how can ALUOp be 10, if ID_EX latch control signal portion gets it's highest 6 bits (all 0's), and ALUOp is 2 of those bits ([2 bits -> WB][3 bits -> M][1 bit -> RegDst][2 bits -> ALUOp][1 bit -> ALUSrc] [04:08:11]
2016-11-02 00:56:10	bkboggy	[04:08:22] Here's a table with explanation from my book: https://s13.postimg.org/9wupq35s7/Resized_20161101_210153.jpg [04:08:22]
2016-11-02 00:56:10	bkboggy	[04:09:20] Does control unit set it to 10 when it receives those 6 bits? [04:09:20]
2016-11-02 00:56:10	bkboggy	[04:09:46] Because those top 6 bits to the latch come from control unit, which gets those from the IR of the fetch stage. [04:09:46]
2016-11-02 00:56:10	bkboggy	[04:12:04] Nevermind, it is the control unit.. [04:12:04]
2016-11-02 00:56:10	bkboggy	[04:12:13] I flippin' set it up a while ago as well.. [04:12:13]

2016-11-02 00:56:10	ndut2	[07:23:56] ? [07:23:56]
2016-11-02 00:56:10	bkboggy	[07:34:15] Would you guys consider jr $ra to use register addressing mode? (MIPS) [07:34:15]
2016-11-02 00:56:10	bkboggy	[07:34:31] Since there is only one operand and it is a register. [07:34:31]
2016-11-02 00:56:10	bkboggy	[07:34:59] Trying to figure out some examples of each addressing mode, to understand them better. [07:34:59]
2016-11-02 00:56:10	bkboggy	[07:35:27] Got a midterm tomorrow. [07:35:27]

2016-11-02 12:00:53	bkboggy	[04:08:11] In regards to MIPS, according to my book, ALUOp is set to 10 for R-Type instructions, such as add.  Well... add opcode is 0, so how can ALUOp be 10, if ID_EX latch control signal portion gets it's highest 6 bits (all 0's), and ALUOp is 2 of those bits ([2 bits -> WB][3 bits -> M][1 bit -> RegDst][2 bits -> ALUOp][1 bit -> ALUSrc] [04:08:11]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	bkboggy	[04:08:22] Here's a table with explanation from my book: https://s13.postimg.org/9wupq35s7/Resized_20161101_210153.jpg [04:08:22]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	bkboggy	[04:09:20] Does control unit set it to 10 when it receives those 6 bits? [04:09:20]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	bkboggy	[04:09:46] Because those top 6 bits to the latch come from control unit, which gets those from the IR of the fetch stage. [04:09:46]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	bkboggy	[04:12:04] Nevermind, it is the control unit.. [04:12:04]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	bkboggy	[04:12:13] I flippin' set it up a while ago as well.. [04:12:13]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	bkboggy	[04:12:18] holy cow losing my marbles today [04:12:18]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	warrshrike	[05:30:17] hey guys [05:30:17]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	warrshrike	[05:30:27] is there any irc for cpu design? [05:30:27]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	warrshrike	[05:30:31] verilog etc [05:30:31]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	 *	ndut2 [06:32:27] back [06:32:27]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	ndut2	[07:23:34] hey all [07:23:34]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	ndut2	[07:23:47] wanna discuss something in ##shellcoder [07:23:47]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	ndut2	[07:23:56] ? [07:23:56]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	bkboggy	[07:34:15] Would you guys consider jr $ra to use register addressing mode? (MIPS) [07:34:15]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	bkboggy	[07:34:31] Since there is only one operand and it is a register. [07:34:31]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	bkboggy	[07:34:59] Trying to figure out some examples of each addressing mode, to understand them better. [07:34:59]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	bkboggy	[07:35:27] Got a midterm tomorrow. [07:35:27]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	bkboggy	[07:37:06] Hmm, it would appear so.  It uses R-Format, and $ra is rs. [07:37:06]

2016-11-02 12:00:53	asla	[17:11:47] Okay, silly question, if anyone is around here, should it be possible to easily patch the cmp instruction here http://puu.sh/s4948/75a68a004c.png or should i expect the 'edi' offset to be more or less dynamic ? [17:11:47]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	Jester02	[17:16:45] patch how [17:16:45]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	Jester02	[17:17:33] the 0C20 is fixed in the instruction, that won't change if that's what you are asking [17:17:33]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	asla	[17:18:03] okay, that's what i was asking [17:18:03]
2016-11-02 12:00:53	asla	[17:18:04] thanks [17:18:04]

2016-11-02 23:26:59	ndut2	[07:23:34] hey all [07:23:34]
2016-11-02 23:26:59	ndut2	[07:23:47] wanna discuss something in ##shellcoder [07:23:47]
2016-11-02 23:26:59	ndut2	[07:23:56] ? [07:23:56]
2016-11-02 23:26:59	bkboggy	[07:34:15] Would you guys consider jr $ra to use register addressing mode? (MIPS) [07:34:15]
2016-11-02 23:26:59	bkboggy	[07:34:31] Since there is only one operand and it is a register. [07:34:31]
2016-11-02 23:26:59	bkboggy	[07:34:59] Trying to figure out some examples of each addressing mode, to understand them better. [07:34:59]
2016-11-02 23:26:59	bkboggy	[07:35:27] Got a midterm tomorrow. [07:35:27]
2016-11-02 23:26:59	bkboggy	[07:37:06] Hmm, it would appear so.  It uses R-Format, and $ra is rs. [07:37:06]

2016-11-02 23:26:59	asla	[17:11:47] Okay, silly question, if anyone is around here, should it be possible to easily patch the cmp instruction here http://puu.sh/s4948/75a68a004c.png or should i expect the 'edi' offset to be more or less dynamic ? [17:11:47]
2016-11-02 23:26:59	Jester02	[17:16:45] patch how [17:16:45]
2016-11-02 23:26:59	Jester02	[17:17:33] the 0C20 is fixed in the instruction, that won't change if that's what you are asking [17:17:33]
2016-11-02 23:26:59	asla	[17:18:03] okay, that's what i was asking [17:18:03]

2016-11-03 00:18:15	dminuoso_	So you have 0x20, 0x30, 0xc0, 0x84, etc.

2016-11-03 07:32:52	archivist	you learn nothing if someone does it for you

2016-11-03 07:39:18	fub	Hi. So in EDX I have 'flag', in EAX I have an address. Then a mov eax,edx is executed. I step into this with gdb, but the value at the address EAX points to did not change to what I have set. Why? This is the output in gdb (with peda): https://paste.pound-python.org/show/BhxP7ODLEHyoHYWuiU17/
2016-11-03 07:39:38	zid	this.. is going to tka esome reading
2016-11-03 07:39:52	carabia	zid: similar mentalities can be found within other... popu... i mean people :)
2016-11-03 07:40:09	carabia	+too
2016-11-03 07:40:46	zid	fub: eax changes from 0x80ca004 to 0x67616c66, edx contained 0x67616c66
2016-11-03 07:40:49	zid	I don't understand the problem.
2016-11-03 07:41:16	carabia	however personally i blame modern search engines for providing an easy way of cheating and not even memorizing things. And if the solution cannot be found within the first page of hits, then it's time to ask someone else to solve said problem for you.
2016-11-03 07:41:27	fub	zid, oh, I thought it's moved to the address EAX points to

2016-11-03 07:41:37	zid	no, that's why it says eax
2016-11-03 07:41:40	GeDaMo	That would be mov [eax], edx
2016-11-03 07:41:52	zid	if it meant that it would use something other than eax, like [eax] yea
2016-11-03 07:42:00	fub	oh, right
2016-11-03 07:42:10	zid	by your logic it would be doing [eax] from [edx]
2016-11-03 07:42:10	fub	I thought mov is always dereferencing (is it called like this?)
2016-11-03 07:42:22	zid	not [eax] from edx
2016-11-03 07:42:22		[07:42]
2016-11-03 07:43:05	fub	okay, so I need a "mov [eax], edx" instead of an "mov eax, edx"

2016-11-03 09:57:39	emihir0	hi, I'm doing a C compiler in Java (ie. C code is turned to MIPS - part of uni assignment) and we are provided with very few examples on stack - hence I have trouble understanding the finer details. I understand that before we call a function, we should save the variables to the stack, then call the function and then restore the stack (at least I hope I understand it correctly). But I'm a bit confused on what frame pointer is actually u
2016-11-03 09:58:02	emihir0	oh, and we also save the $ra into the stack as well (of course)

2016-11-03 10:00:11		[10:00]
2016-11-03 10:00:40	zid	it's just saving where the stack starts, can make for easier mental burden of cleaning up when the function is done (restoring esp, rather than subtracting the right amount)
2016-11-03 10:00:47	zid	and tools can follow the stack contents easier
2016-11-03 10:01:14	emihir0	I see, that makes sense
2016-11-03 10:02:05	emihir0	what about saving the return value ($v0) to the stack? at what point should it be done? e.g. say I have: int bar() { return 1;} void main() { print_i(bar()); } -- where print_i prints an integer
2016-11-03 10:02:21	zid	you don't generally save it to a stack
2016-11-03 10:02:30	emihir0	this works and prints 1 for me, obviously we don't need to worry about saving the v0 into stack here because we use only 1 function
2016-11-03 10:02:33	zid	it's almost always through a register, ax/eax/rax

2016-11-03 10:40:32	emihir0	@zid, sorry I had to go away - I don't think we can use the registers you mentioned - ie. ax/eax/rax/edx/xmm0 etc, because we use 32 registers only
2016-11-03 10:42:20	zid	those are the same register
2016-11-03 10:42:29	zid	except xmm0
2016-11-03 10:42:46	zid	xmm0 is for floating point return values, eax is for 32bit, eax:edx for 64bit
2016-11-03 10:42:47	emihir0	basically, say I have foo, foo1 and main. main wants to print foo1 and foo1 returns foo, where foo return 1. Hence main wants to put v0 (of foo1) as a0 to print_i, and foo1 wants to call foo where foo puts v0 as 1, and foo1 puts the return (ie. 1) as v0 (for main)
2016-11-03 10:43:12	emihir0	so i think it's a good idea to store the v0 to stack between the function calls?
2016-11-03 10:43:14	zid	call foo1 / push eax / call print_i
2016-11-03 10:43:31	zid	return value on stack is pretty gross, because you'll need the stack to be able to ret
2016-11-03 10:44:20	zid	if you want to implement your own stack on top you could do that, but you'll need to generate code to access that special stack, so you might as well just skip it and generate 'mov eax, retvalue'
2016-11-03 10:45:12	emihir0	but is eax etc even in MIPS? i can't find documentation for it :/
2016-11-03 10:45:20	zid	use whatever the mips equivalent is
2016-11-03 10:45:24	zid	r0 or t0 or whatever
2016-11-03 10:45:34	emihir0	so it's just a temporary register?
2016-11-03 10:45:43	emihir0	i thought it was something special
2016-11-03 10:45:44	zid	eax is the x86 'main' register, the one the alu targets

2016-11-03 10:46:54	zid	f(g(h(j(4))));
2016-11-03 10:47:11	zid	those can all just pass r0/t0/v0/whatevermipsuses to the next function along

2016-11-03 10:48:07	zid	jal
2016-11-03 10:48:31	zid	if the program needed to reuse the return value, it would save it to a temporary variable /in the C code/
2016-11-03 10:48:55	zid	otherwise it's just the rvalue of an expression and thus only needed to be computed, not stored

2016-11-03 16:08:36	zid	no.
2016-11-03 16:08:45	zid	there's no magic 4 which is different to any other 4
2016-11-03 16:09:06	zid	just because you conceptualised one of the values as being in hex or decimal or octal or dudocecimal
2016-11-03 16:09:15	zid	it's still 4, it still represnts IIII many things
2016-11-03 16:09:42	zid	whether I write it 4, or four, or 0x4 or 0o4 or 0b100
2016-11-03 16:11:12	zid	You might want to consider brushing up on place value, 128 is 1*100 + 2*10 + 8*1

2016-11-03 16:11:57	moogoom	ok i get it

2016-11-03 16:12:17	moogoom	0x80
2016-11-03 16:12:29	zid	as a sum of powers like I just did

2016-11-03 16:12:43	moogoom	+
2016-11-03 16:12:47	moogoom	0* 1
2016-11-03 16:13:20	zid	Right, so there's your answer, the only tricky part is that without a trick you'd need to know how many digits are in the number in order to know what to multiply each digit by
2016-11-03 16:14:12	zid	0x1234 is 1 * 4096 + 2 * 256 * 3 * 16 + 4,  but if you're going left to right you don't know whether to multiply the 1 by 4096, or by 256, or by 16, or by 4.3 billion or what
2016-11-03 16:14:20	moogoom	yes
2016-11-03 16:14:32	moogoom	that was how i first thought i would do it
2016-11-03 16:14:35	moogoom	but
2016-11-03 16:14:44	zid	There is a trick. Also, sentences go across and not down
2016-11-03 16:15:00	moogoom	i heard there was a trick if you just like convert it into binary and then shift it however many times right
2016-11-03 16:15:22	zid	The 'trick' is that you can treat 1234 as 123 * 10 + 4, 12345 as 1234 * 10 + 5, 123456 as 12345 * 10 + 6, etc
2016-11-03 16:15:42	zid	so you just do previous total * base + new digit, and keep feeding it digits
2016-11-03 16:16:12	zid	1, 10 + 2, 12 * 10 + 3, 123 * 10 + 4, 1234 * 10 + 5, etc
2016-11-03 16:17:40	zid	do I get paid extra for teaching you kidergarten math?
2016-11-03 16:17:47	moogoom	ok so you take all the digits besides the last one, multiply by the base (10 for decimal 16 for hex) and then add the last digit
2016-11-03 16:18:01	zid	except they are all the last digit

2016-11-03 22:49:36	moogoom	[02:36:22] http://pastebin.com/PiLcUFP8 [02:36:22]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	zid	[02:36:39] there is no such thing as a 'bit pointer' [02:36:39]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	moogoom	[02:36:56] sorry I don't know the actual term [02:36:56]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	bcos	[02:37:06] moogoom: I'm not familiar with ARM, but that looks quite wrong - e.g. you can't multiply by 10 using shifts [02:37:06]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	bcos	[02:37:12] *using one shift [02:37:12]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	zid	[02:37:16] also you're trying to do two different steps at once? [02:37:16]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	zid	[02:37:25] there's no need for two buffers to read a string as a number [02:37:25]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	moogoom	[02:38:08] bcos: shift left will multiply the number by whatever the base is in (10 if its decimal) [02:38:08]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	zid	[02:38:14] no [02:38:14]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	zid	[02:38:27] shift left will shift the bits left, which in effect, is a binary multiply by 1 [02:38:27]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	bcos	[02:38:34] Shift left works on binary, and will multiply by "powers of 2" [02:38:34]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	zid	[02:38:35] by 10* [02:38:35]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	zid	[02:38:44] 10 in decimal being.. 2 [02:38:44]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	moogoom	[02:38:47] if you shift left 10 in binary it becomes 100 [02:38:47]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	zid	[02:38:50] shifting left just doubles it [02:38:50]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	moogoom	[02:38:55] which changes it from 2 to 4 [02:38:55]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	zid	[02:39:00] but not 2 to 20 [02:39:00]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	zid	[02:39:03] which is the point [02:39:03]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	moogoom	[02:39:10] shifting left 123 in decimal changes it to 1230 [02:39:10]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	zid	[02:39:16] no, it changes it to 256 [02:39:16]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	zid	[02:39:30] "2 to 4" and "123 to 1230" do not follow the same rule [02:39:30]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	moogoom	[02:39:41] it depends on what base it is in [02:39:41]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	zid	[02:39:45] values don't have bases [02:39:45]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	zid	[02:39:48] for the 123092th time [02:39:48]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	zid	[02:40:00] <<1 is the same as multiply by 2, end of story [02:40:00]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	bcos	[02:40:04] You can multiply by 10 by doing "result = x << 3 + x << 1;     // result = x * 8 + x * 2 = x * 10" [02:40:04]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	moogoom	[02:40:05] fine [02:40:05]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	moogoom	[02:40:30] lets say its " mul R4, R4, R3 " [02:40:30]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	moogoom	[02:40:50] soryr "mul R4, R3, #10 " [02:40:50]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	moogoom	[02:40:55] sorry* [02:40:55]
2016-11-03 22:49:36	bcos	[02:48:54] moogoom: Spend some time thinking about this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/86cb795d79a8e8b5f9ff60029bdf0aec [02:48:54]

2016-11-03 22:58:03	archivist	only if you want to
2016-11-03 22:58:28	memesaregreat	if I want to get into reverse engineering (no .NET craps), ASM is a must right?
2016-11-03 22:58:36	dminuoso_	memesaregreat: It's definitely helpful in some areas, debugging in particular, but it is not a requirement at all.
2016-11-03 22:58:46	dminuoso_	memesaregreat: Yeah.

2016-11-04 06:37:01	bforte	hey there, I'm using radare2 for disassembling/reverse engineering x86_64 binaries. and I'm wanting to test out a decompiler to see what results it can produce.. now my trouble is that the ones I've looked at (radeco, snowman and boomerang) seem to "only" work for x86 assembly.
2016-11-04 06:37:22	bforte	is there an opensource decompiler for x86_64 binaries?

2016-11-04 14:10:45	zid	[02:38:14] no [02:38:14]
2016-11-04 14:10:45	zid	[02:38:27] shift left will shift the bits left, which in effect, is a binary multiply by 1 [02:38:27]
2016-11-04 14:10:45	bcos	[02:38:34] Shift left works on binary, and will multiply by "powers of 2" [02:38:34]
2016-11-04 14:10:45	zid	[02:38:35] by 10* [02:38:35]

2016-11-04 14:10:45	moogoom	[02:38:47] if you shift left 10 in binary it becomes 100 [02:38:47]
2016-11-04 14:10:45	zid	[02:38:50] shifting left just doubles it [02:38:50]
2016-11-04 14:10:45	moogoom	[02:38:55] which changes it from 2 to 4 [02:38:55]

2016-11-04 14:10:45	zid	[02:39:30] "2 to 4" and "123 to 1230" do not follow the same rule [02:39:30]
2016-11-04 14:10:45	moogoom	[02:39:41] it depends on what base it is in [02:39:41]
2016-11-04 14:10:45	zid	[02:39:45] values don't have bases [02:39:45]

2016-11-04 14:10:45	bcos	[02:40:04] You can multiply by 10 by doing "result = x << 3 + x << 1;     // result = x * 8 + x * 2 = x * 10" [02:40:04]

2016-11-04 14:10:45	dminuoso_	[08:58:36] memesaregreat: It's definitely helpful in some areas, debugging in particular, but it is not a requirement at all. [08:58:36]

[16:37:01]
2016-11-04 14:10:45	bforte	[16:37:22] is there an opensource decompiler for x86_64 binaries? [16:37:22]
2016-11-04 14:10:45	bforte	[16:49:05] wait, though it doesn't say so on github, snowman seems to be able to do that (according to derevenets.com) [16:49:05]
2016-11-04 14:10:45	bforte	[16:49:24] nvm then, will try that tomorrow. [16:49:24]

2016-11-04 16:45:19	bforte	[16:37:22] is there an opensource decompiler for x86_64 binaries? [16:37:22]
2016-11-04 16:45:19	bforte	[16:49:05] wait, though it doesn't say so on github, snowman seems to be able to do that (according to derevenets.com) [16:49:05]
2016-11-04 16:45:19	bforte	[16:49:24] nvm then, will try that tomorrow. [16:49:24]

2016-11-04 23:25:07	bforte	[16:37:01] hey there, I'm using radare2 for disassembling/reverse engineering x86_64 binaries. and I'm wanting to test out a decompiler to see what results it can produce.. now my trouble is that the ones I've looked at (radeco, snowman and boomerang) seem to "only" work for x86 assembly. [16:37:01]
2016-11-04 23:25:07	bforte	[16:37:22] is there an opensource decompiler for x86_64 binaries? [16:37:22]
2016-11-04 23:25:07	bforte	[16:49:05] wait, though it doesn't say so on github, snowman seems to be able to do that (according to derevenets.com) [16:49:05]
2016-11-04 23:25:07	bforte	[16:49:24] nvm then, will try that tomorrow. [16:49:24]
2016-11-04 23:25:07	MikeFair	[03:51:25] In xtensa assembly, if I wanted to load the topmost unsigned byte of the stack into a register, would the command be "L8UI %[my_target_reg], sp, 0;" [03:51:25]
2016-11-04 23:25:07	MikeFair	[03:52:10] I've tried offsets 0 and 1 (and even -1 which I'm assuming became 255); and all of them cause a crash [03:52:10]
2016-11-04 23:25:07	MikeFair	[03:53:58] I'm doing this isn't an asm() routine from C [03:53:58]
2016-11-04 23:25:07	MikeFair	[03:54:06] s/isn't/inside/ [03:54:06]
2016-11-04 23:25:08	MikeFair	[04:16:00] nm, figured it out; the crash was coming from a different line of code jumping to an invalid address; not the L8UI command [04:16:00]
2016-11-04 23:25:08	MikeFair	[04:19:59] Can anyone tell me more specifically what the "m" constraint is doing when inlining assembly?   As in  [m_some_byte] "m" (some_byte) [04:19:59]
2016-11-04 23:25:08	MikeFair	[04:21:09] I can't seem to use %[m_some_byte] for anything; but the value does appear as the last byte on the top of the stack (I have the entry as the list item on the inputs line); [04:21:09]
2016-11-04 23:25:08	MikeFair	[04:21:18] I was wondering if that was coincidence or by design [04:21:18]
2016-11-04 23:25:08	MikeFair	[04:21:57] Thanks [04:21:57]
2016-11-04 23:25:08	bcos	[04:43:26] MikeFair: I'd assume that "m" means that the operand is in memory, and therefore doesn't work for instructions need the operand to be in a register (and therefore doesn't work for most instructions for CPUs that have a "load/store RISC" design) [04:43:26]
2016-11-04 23:25:08	FlyingJester	[07:50:45] Usually that's explicit in the lad/store name of the instruction. RISC usually means that to/from memory is encoded in the instruction, not the addressing mdoe. [07:50:45]

2016-11-05 04:09:01	yollo	Hi all!! I'm a newbie of Intel asm and I'm tryin to compile something as introductive exercies...I have read some stuff found on the web but i'm still having some doubt
2016-11-05 04:09:46	yollo	first of all: have I to use alway DI as register to index vectors and matrix?
2016-11-05 04:11:06	yollo	for example, if I want to do MOV my_vector[BH],AX then I should replace that with MOV DI,BH and then MOV my_vector[DI],AX, right?
2016-11-05 04:11:34	yollo	thanks in advance
2016-11-05 04:15:13	roxfan	16-bit does not support all addressing modes with all registers
2016-11-05 04:15:13		[04:15]
2016-11-05 04:16:17	yollo	ok so I'm forced to use always DI as index
2016-11-05 04:16:20	roxfan	so you have to use DI,SI,BP or BX for indirect addressing
2016-11-05 04:16:36	roxfan	32-bit is a bit more flexible

2016-11-05 08:13:41	john98	Jester01: does this code support multiplying negative numbers?
2016-11-05 08:13:41	Random832	well, you get six evenly spaced values from 00 to FF: 00, 33, 66, 99, CC, FF

2016-11-05 17:58:49	zid	Presumably you mean 64bit
2016-11-05 17:58:55	zid	In which case: do it in halves and handle the carry

2016-11-05 18:24:51	heelpmeplz	I have a 64-bit word.  To multiply it by 2, you say to "do it in halves".  So I put half in, say, edx, and half in ebx, and then I multiple each by 2.  Then I add them back together, right?
2016-11-05 18:25:45	zid	no, you put them back where you found them
2016-11-05 18:25:48	zid	and you forgot the carry
2016-11-05 18:25:58	heelpmeplz	in this case I know the numbers and there is no carry

2016-11-05 18:44:24	Moose	Assuming bigData here is a location in memory :)

2016-11-06 02:50:44	L4B	Sure, it it's not too much code. If it's a lot, you might want to write it from scratch instead.
2016-11-06 02:51:36	BPL	L4B: it's this one { https://github.com/in4k/rgba_tbc_elevated_source/blob/master/src/synth.asm + https://github.com/in4k/rgba_tbc_elevated_source/blob/master/src/synth_core.nh }

2016-11-06 02:53:02	BPL	L4B: Cos the final executable has one constraint, it can't weight more than 4096 bytes to be "valid" :)
2016-11-06 02:53:49	zid	this synth.asm is about 40 bytes, so that's fine :P

2016-11-06 16:48:09	messss3	I'm trying to check to see if a memory address on the stack is equal to zero.
2016-11-06 16:50:20	Jester01	and your problem is?
2016-11-06 16:51:06	messss3	So.. What I'm doing right now...
2016-11-06 16:51:21	messss3	"movq $0, %rcx"\
2016-11-06 16:51:30	messss3	then to do the compare I do..
2016-11-06 16:51:57	messss3	"cmp (%rsp, %r11, 4), %rcx"
2016-11-06 16:52:34	Jester01	you don't need a register for that, but should work
2016-11-06 16:52:47	messss3	hmmmm
2016-11-06 16:52:55	messss3	So after I jump using "je"
2016-11-06 16:52:56	Jester01	note that since you scale by 4, chances are your data is 4 bytes too
2016-11-06 16:53:06	Jester01	hence, you should use %ecx not %rcx

2016-11-06 16:53:32	messss3	Oh...
2016-11-06 16:53:43	messss3	Perhaps if I set the scale to 8
2016-11-06 16:53:59	Jester01	well you should know what size items you have
2016-11-06 16:54:11	zid	yea there's not much point in guessing
2016-11-06 16:54:23	messss3	Well it really doesn't have to be 8 bytes..
2016-11-06 16:54:29	messss3	Its just an array with 0's or 1's
2016-11-06 16:54:47	Jester01	whatever you pick, be consistent
2016-11-06 16:54:48	zid	an array of *what* though
2016-11-06 16:55:45	messss3	zid: An array of integers I suppose.
2016-11-06 16:57:15	zid	note this contradicts your original question involving pointers
2016-11-06 16:58:04	messss3	erm... I'm not sure I used pointers...

2016-11-06 16:58:41	messss3	Oh I see what your saying
2016-11-06 16:59:15	zid	I'm not sure if you have an array on the stack, a pointer to an array on the stack, or what
2016-11-06 16:59:15		[16:59]
2016-11-06 16:59:50	messss3	I allocated some space on the stack to put an "array" of 1's and 0's onto
2016-11-06 17:00:15	zid	aha, so no addresses at all then
2016-11-06 17:00:30	messss3	meaning.. I moved the stack pointer down, and am referencing position 1, by saying (%rsp, 1, 4)
2016-11-06 17:00:46	messss3	position 2 being... (%rsp, 2, 4)
2016-11-06 17:00:48	messss3	and so on
2016-11-06 17:01:02	zid	That's an array of int, on the stack, in typical parlance
2016-11-06 17:01:27	messss3	Alright. Thank you, for the jargon help.
2016-11-06 17:01:48	zid	You allocated it by subtracting from the stack pointer, so your array elements will be at rsp-4, rsp-8 etc
2016-11-06 17:02:28	messss3	Do I have to go downwards? Or can I just say that the bottom of my stack is the beginning of my array?
2016-11-06 17:02:34	messss3	as I am doing right now
2016-11-06 17:02:53	zid	messss3: When your function starts, above you is taken by return addresses, other function's data, etc, below you is empty
2016-11-06 17:03:10	zid	you can claim some 'below' by moving the stack pointer down
2016-11-06 17:03:28	zid	if you don't move the stack pointer, you can't make any function calls without destroying your array, as rsp still points into it
2016-11-06 17:03:57	zid	your return address, and that function's allocations will end up ontop of your array

2016-11-06 22:17:28	boru	Homework questions, again?
2016-11-06 22:18:13	archivist	would a teacher ask such a silly question
2016-11-06 22:18:20	boru	Yes.
2016-11-06 22:18:43	Neslepaks	"Provide a technical comparison between Assembler, and Compiler based on certain technical issues. Your answer should include the criteria of comparison along with the related explanation "
2016-11-06 22:18:55	archivist	I know they are a bunch of dummies
2016-11-06 22:19:18	Neslepaks	I understand that an Assembler is a sort of compiler
2016-11-06 22:19:29	archivist	it is a translator
2016-11-06 22:19:51	Neslepaks	I don't really get what this question wants of me
2016-11-06 22:20:03	Neslepaks	What its asking, I mean.
2016-11-06 22:20:06	archivist	see if you understand the difference
2016-11-06 22:20:21	archivist	find out what the two actually do
2016-11-06 22:20:25	Neslepaks	How I understand it, an assembler is a sort of compuler.
2016-11-06 22:20:34	Neslepaks	compiler*
2016-11-06 22:20:44	archivist	not really a compiler at all
2016-11-06 22:21:09	Neslepaks	A compiler is a translator, transforming a code from one language to a baser language
2016-11-06 22:21:41	archivist	google a while to learn the differences
2016-11-06 22:21:41		[22:21]
2016-11-06 22:21:44	Neslepaks	An assembler is also a translator, it translates into machine code.
2016-11-06 22:21:57	dminuoso_	So.
2016-11-06 22:22:14	dminuoso_	You like asking the same questions in multiple channels and make people do your homework for you?
2016-11-06 22:22:57	archivist	that can be a kick ban offence :)
2016-11-06 22:23:13	Neslepaks	How am I supposed to learn if I don't ask?
2016-11-06 22:23:24	dminuoso_	Dont ask in multiple channels at the same time
2016-11-06 22:23:26	dminuoso_	its fucking rude.
2016-11-06 22:23:49	archivist	read some books, google
2016-11-06 22:24:08	Neslepaks	I tried asking in the past in only one channel, it sometimes would happen that there wouldn't be anyone active in the particular channel I asked my question in

2016-11-06 22:25:57	Neslepaks	A decompiler is a translator also
2016-11-06 22:26:06	Neslepaks	But it translates from baser languages to higher languages
2016-11-06 22:26:33	Neslepaks	Both a compiler and an assembler translate from higher to baser
2016-11-06 22:26:38	archivist	I see someone not reading enough
2016-11-06 22:26:57	Neslepaks	compiler = high level language (c, java, ...etc) -> assembly language

2016-11-06 22:28:10	Neslepaks	What did I get wrong?
2016-11-06 22:28:50	archivist	often compilers skip the assembly stage
2016-11-06 22:28:55	dminuoso_	The fact that you are just trying to copy what I wrote instead of understanding anything about it.
2016-11-06 22:29:13	dminuoso_	Neslepaks: A compiler is any compiler that translates code from a higher level language to a lower language. The lower language does not have to be assembly.

2016-11-06 22:29:37	dminuoso_	Neslepaks: The lower language could be an intermediate representation. It could be assembly. It could be machine code.
2016-11-06 22:29:49	dminuoso_	It could be some VM bytecode.
2016-11-06 22:29:57	dminuoso_	It could be unicorns and ponies.
2016-11-06 22:30:04	archivist	it could be pcode with an interpreter
2016-11-06 22:30:18	Neslepaks	I see. So an assembler is a subset of compilers.
2016-11-06 22:30:27	Neslepaks	Which strictly translate to machine code.
2016-11-06 22:30:38	archivist	bytecode being the new buzzword for pcode
2016-11-06 22:30:46	archivist	no
2016-11-06 22:31:05	Neslepaks	Compilers, generally, are open ended, they can translate down many levels, or fewer levels.

2016-11-07 11:33:06	Jester01	it's a duplicate!
2016-11-07 11:33:08	Jester01	oh wait :D
2016-11-07 11:33:44	Jester01	short version: you don't want to do that, use a debugger instead.
2016-11-07 11:34:34	Jester01	long version: you will probably have to write some macros that create the string

2016-11-07 11:56:50	 *	boru chuckles
2016-11-07 11:57:09	boru	It's quite well documented.

2016-11-07 11:57:47	boru	Aye, very much so.
2016-11-07 11:58:33	boru	I really ought to gather up some pertinent reference material, somewhere.
2016-11-07 11:58:34	dminuoso_	Currently I've completely ripped out my entire memory subsystem though, so this is more important than stack traces I guess..

2016-11-07 12:02:01	dminuoso_	Apparently.

2016-11-07 12:06:44	dminuoso_	boru: Linux maps basically all physical memory into virtual memory to get direct access to any page it wants
2016-11-07 12:06:58	dminuoso_	boru: with 32 bit processors it was particularly bothersome because high mem
2016-11-07 12:07:32	dminuoso_	effectively it limits you to only half the virtual address space if you have 128TB of ram
2016-11-07 12:07:35	boru	Ah, right.
2016-11-07 12:07:50	dminuoso_	which is great, because then bootstrapping your memory systems become trivial
2016-11-07 12:08:37	boru	FWIW, you couldn't always turn it off, and non-deterministic allocators are a bad idea, imho.
2016-11-07 12:09:26	boru	Perhaps not for application programmers with relatively endless resources, but in instances where you're up against the endstops, you're going to want determinism.
