2016-09-09 18:44:26	Guest32560	When I export an audio track, the track looses its sharpness and clarity, compared to when I play it from Ardour.  The only thing I can figure is that this is something to do with the fact I applied effects on the master bus?  I don't know.

2016-09-09 18:44:53	Guest32560	I've tried exporting as both .wav and .flac
2016-09-09 18:45:28	Guest32560	The track is of someone speaking japanese, so it's very important to me that it is sharp and clear.

2016-09-09 18:58:01	Guest32560	Ok, I just turned off all effects on the master buss and the audio now sounds like the export.  So it must have something to do with that.

2016-09-10 03:25:14	OvenWerks	Guest22514: you will find that Ardour does not do anything to the sound other than change the level. (multiply)
2016-09-10 03:25:36	OvenWerks	Guest22514: any other changes are left to plugins
2016-09-10 03:25:46	Guest22514	Thank you OvenWerks! But I am aware of both. The second link doesn't outline anything properly.

2016-09-10 03:26:51	Guest22514	Can you suggest what I should do if I want to make changes in GUI?

2016-09-10 03:29:35	OvenWerks	in general GUI took kits do not have widgets useful to a DAW
2016-09-10 03:29:51	OvenWerks	as such Ardour has many custom widgets.

2016-09-10 03:37:58	OvenWerks	Guest22514: I am not likely to be a lot of help with a GUI. as the_CLA_2 said las and rgareus have done most (almost all) of the GUI work.
2016-09-10 03:38:39	OvenWerks	my total GUI work has been a setup dialog for OSC controllers.
2016-09-10 03:39:24	Guest22514	Thank you the_CLA_2 and OvenWerks!
2016-09-10 03:39:33	_FrnchFrgg_	Guest22514: It's GTK mostly
2016-09-10 03:39:46	_FrnchFrgg_	Guest22514: But some widgets are "custom"
2016-09-10 03:40:14	_FrnchFrgg_	Guest22514: Still GTK widgets, but drawn completely by Ardour
2016-09-10 03:40:28	_FrnchFrgg_	Guest22514: And GTK uses cairo as a drawing system
2016-09-10 03:40:37	_FrnchFrgg_	Guest22514: Has for some time now
2016-09-10 03:41:26	Guest22514	Ok so supposing I want to understand which code does what, where should I begin? The aim is to understand the whole code.
2016-09-10 03:41:32	_FrnchFrgg_	Guest22514: The problem is that the most used custom widgets in Ardour (ArdourButton and ArdourKnob) are a bit messy and should be reimplemented with more modularity

2016-09-10 03:43:19	_FrnchFrgg_	Guest22514: Cleaning up the UI framework of Ardour is a high-cost low-benefits in the short term and the two main devs (rgareus and las) will probably prioritize audio/midi work
2016-09-10 03:43:59	_FrnchFrgg_	Guest22514: It depends on what you want to work on. If you just want to understand the Ardour UI architecture, it's in gtk2_ardour/
2016-09-10 03:44:38	_FrnchFrgg_	Guest22514: For instance you can look in gtk2_ardour/mixer_strip.{h,cc}
2016-09-10 03:45:26	Guest22514	Oh thanks that was a very helpful pointer.
2016-09-10 03:45:30	_FrnchFrgg_	Guest22514: There you'll see how a mixer strip UI is build (part of that is done in gtk2_ardour/route_ui.{h,cc} IIRC)
2016-09-10 03:45:46	_FrnchFrgg_	Guest22514: One is a subclass of the other I think
2016-09-10 03:46:11	Guest22514	Great!

2016-09-10 03:46:38	_FrnchFrgg_	Guest22514: If you want to change how Ardour looks (as in put a texture on buttons), then you'll probably have to dive into gtk2_ardour/ardour_button.*
2016-09-10 03:46:44	_FrnchFrgg_	and ardour_knob.*
2016-09-10 03:47:07	Guest22514	Okay
2016-09-10 03:47:44	_FrnchFrgg_	Guest22514: I think mixbus changes the look of knobs, maybe that part is in ardour's repository.

2016-09-10 03:49:17	_FrnchFrgg_	Guest22514: Ardour devs don't want to do a complex migration for almost no gain
2016-09-10 03:49:55	_FrnchFrgg_	Guest22514: In fact a project is to not use GTK at all, except to provide windows, text entries, and file choosers

2016-09-10 04:59:15	_FrnchFrgg_	Guest22514: Note that las wants to refactor midi storage in a relatively short term (currently it is prefetched/streamed/discarded exactly as audio is, which is complicated and not useful since midi uses so few space compared to audio; las wants to make Ardour just load the complete midi region into RAM at all times)
2016-09-10 04:59:54	_FrnchFrgg_	Guest22514: So midi might change a lot for the better, and be much simpler to understand afterwards.

2016-09-10 05:02:20	drobilla	It does anyway, effectively, since that's what the model is
2016-09-10 05:02:32	drobilla	Assuming you have an editor and want editing enabled and so on
2016-09-10 05:02:54	_FrnchFrgg_	Guest22514: All of rgareus, las, drobilla and me keep their nick at all times
2016-09-10 05:03:16	drobilla	Changing the read/write model to be all weird and different for no particular reason strikes me as a lot of work to move backwards for little if any gain (and the loss of ability to do crazy huge high rate multitrack recording for days and whatnot, which I consider a fundamental Ardourism regardless of datatype)
2016-09-10 05:03:16	_FrnchFrgg_	Guest22514: and rgareus is in fact always online (his irc client is on a server)
2016-09-10 05:03:21	drobilla	But I also haven't been paying much attention lately
2016-09-10 05:04:07	_FrnchFrgg_	drobilla: I thought that currently the read/write model is all weird, and las wants to change that to just load the file in RAM, not the contrary
2016-09-10 05:04:52	drobilla	The shitty SMF library we use *also* does this, so the design is currently pointless
2016-09-10 05:04:56	drobilla	IMO *that* is the thing to fix
2016-09-10 05:05:03	drobilla	_FrnchFrgg_: In the context of Ardour *that* is weird
2016-09-10 05:05:49	Guest22514	Thank u  _FrnchFrgg_! wil catch you later! 
2016-09-10 05:06:12	_FrnchFrgg_	drobilla: You mean that loading the whole file in RAM is weird for Ardour ?
2016-09-10 05:06:20	drobilla	Recording pretty much has to work that way regardless, but I suppose you can skip the middle man and record straight to a model and just save the whole thing when done
2016-09-10 05:06:45	drobilla	(RIP your data if something goes wrong while recording)
2016-09-10 05:07:46	drobilla	_FrnchFrgg_: Yes.  It working like audio, at least in this context, is intentional
2016-09-10 05:07:47	_FrnchFrgg_	drobilla: IIUC las wanted to be able to seek in midi, and remove all those problems with prefetching/streaming event-based sparse data (as opposed to sample-based and dense for audio)
2016-09-10 05:08:44	drobilla	Meh, fair enough.  It would make a few things easier
2016-09-10 05:09:36	_FrnchFrgg_	drobilla: las' point was that MIDI is fundamentally different from audio on that regard
2016-09-10 05:09:37	drobilla	Bit of a tinkertoy approach IMO, but I am tired of making the case that MIDI isn't inherently tinkertoy, so whatever.

2016-09-10 05:11:23	drobilla	_FrnchFrgg_: The real underlying motivation there is seeking in both directions and having all the data around for such things
2016-09-10 05:11:29	_FrnchFrgg_	drobilla: He also made the point that even some crazy composer's midi files wouldn't break ardour if loaded all in ram, and that the streaming model of Ardour for audio wasn't because it was beautiful, but because it had to be done like that for efficiency
2016-09-10 05:12:17	drobilla	Possibly.
2016-09-10 05:12:17		[05:12]
2016-09-10 05:13:26	drobilla	My biggest concern with this would be recording for 2 hours and losing everything I just played because Ardour crashed or whatever
2016-09-10 05:13:31	_FrnchFrgg_	drobilla: I'm paraphrasing and might be betraying his thoughs, but that's what I understood.
2016-09-10 05:14:29	drobilla	But whatever, I really don't care TBH.  I wrote it for streaming because that's just How Ardour Works, and towards some capabilities/scalability that clearly nobody actually gives a crap about
2016-09-10 05:14:51	_FrnchFrgg_	drobilla: midi recordings might still be written to the file as it goes, no ? I think that's not incompatible with a "all in ram" model.
2016-09-10 05:14:56	drobilla	Most of which aren't realized anyway because e.g. automation curves are always in data anyway and that's where the real size can come from
2016-09-10 05:15:23	drobilla	I imagined that actually getting all of this stuff and scrapping libsmf's non-streaming trash and making editing optional was the way forward
2016-09-10 05:15:34	_FrnchFrgg_	drobilla: I think he mentioned automation, yes
2016-09-10 05:15:35	drobilla	Just tossing the entire concept of streaming MIDI out is another one
2016-09-10 05:16:38	drobilla	_FrnchFrgg_: Kind of.  Yes, but that whole "simpler" thing rapidly starts to go out the window
2016-09-10 05:17:15	_FrnchFrgg_	drobilla: Also that no system we cared about would have problems storing insane amounts of midi data anyway
2016-09-10 05:17:24	_FrnchFrgg_	s/storing/keeping around/
2016-09-10 05:17:59	drobilla	For the record, I am biased and I know it.  I am a high performance computing person.  If your recording program can't record an arbitrary duration/amount of input, then it is crap in my universe that doesn't do its stated purpose.
2016-09-10 05:18:00	_FrnchFrgg_	drobilla: And that it would be still negligible before automation and audio data flowing
2016-09-10 05:18:32	drobilla	I fully accept that "woo I bonked a key every second or so" is the 99.99% case
2016-09-10 05:19:46	_FrnchFrgg_	drobilla: A lot of midi files I have are not on that scale (and still fit las description). I have downloaded ePiano competition midi files (very skilled pianists playing on a Disklavier).
2016-09-10 05:20:08	drobilla	_FrnchFrgg_: I actually don't care what most MIDI is
2016-09-10 05:20:13	_FrnchFrgg_	With all aftertouth glory
2016-09-10 05:20:21	drobilla	It is conceptually possible to record hundreds of events per frame with Jack
2016-09-10 05:20:29	drobilla	I see no reason not to
2016-09-10 05:20:40	_FrnchFrgg_	drobilla: I think the midi jack buffer won't allow you to do that
2016-09-10 05:21:08	drobilla	It is configurable.  Point being you can do way, way more than what SMFs you are likely to find floating around in the wild do
2016-09-10 05:21:49	_FrnchFrgg_	drobilla: Sure. But some SMF in the wild are pretty wild already and that was my point.
2016-09-10 05:21:53	drobilla	IMO we are already bad enough in scalability, if in different ways.  Notes and auto data hours and hours in the future shouldn't exist in memory at all until I scroll over there
2016-09-10 05:22:39	_FrnchFrgg_	drobilla: Anyway I don't need to be convinced. I'm not making that decision, and I don't dislike the current model.
2016-09-10 05:23:05	drobilla	Maybe we truly never care, but a redesign to fundamentally say we can never do such things strikes me as completely backwards

2016-09-10 05:46:12	drobilla	Yeah, I'm surprised anything but red ever made it in there in the first place
2016-09-10 05:48:50	cooltehno	You're right, I also has the same opinion about red color. But have no capabilities to do that without affecting the general design (I wrote about in the discription of commit).

2016-09-11 03:25:58	jmtrivial	I have to move first the region, then the control points (they are not associated.

2016-09-11 03:37:20	jmtrivial	is it correct that in http://jmtrivial.info/divers/ardour.png if the "move automation..." option is activated, when you move region 1, it should move also the green control points (part 2 of the image) ?
2016-09-11 03:37:20		[03:37]
2016-09-11 03:37:44	Headwar	If you are talking about the track automation (as in right click > automation > show all automation) I guess its not a bug but an expected behavior.
2016-09-11 03:38:21	jmtrivial	ok. then it means I'll have to move all my control points by hand
2016-09-11 03:38:24	Headwar	The automation which is moved is the one done with the Editor Mode tool, which is bound to the region itself, not the track
2016-09-11 03:38:42	jmtrivial	the one related to the gain?
2016-09-11 03:38:57	Headwar	jmtrivial, I ll try by my side to try to find an easy solution
2016-09-11 03:39:03	Headwar	yes, the gain
2016-09-11 03:39:07	jmtrivial	Ok, I see
2016-09-11 03:39:21	jmtrivial	thank you for the answer
2016-09-11 03:39:30	jmtrivial	in the documentation, it was not very clear that point
2016-09-11 03:39:55	Headwar	jmtrivial, in Editor Mode, you can box-select all your automation points and move them all at once
2016-09-11 03:40:05	jmtrivial	Yes, I've seen that
2016-09-11 03:40:22	jmtrivial	but when you box-select both control points and regions, then you cannot move them both
2016-09-11 03:40:56	jmtrivial	It means that if you have to move multiple tracks with multiple automation points, you'll have to make many moves
2016-09-11 03:41:06	Headwar	Thats true
2016-09-11 03:41:18	jmtrivial	but it's ok, I was not sure about that and wanted to find an easiest way to do

2016-09-11 03:43:27	Headwar	Its tru than an option to move all the automation points between the beginning and the and of the region moved could be usefull. Maybe a feature request on Mantis ?
2016-09-11 03:43:31	Headwar	(true)
2016-09-11 03:45:34	jmtrivial	well, it's not easy to implement I think, because when you move that, it will have possibly some "collisions" with other control points. Then will arrive the question: how to mix the two series of points...
2016-09-11 03:45:52	jmtrivial	but yes, it seems to be for me a very useful option
2016-09-11 03:46:07	avoca	jmtrivial: that option doesn't work for me either. It does in Mixbus. When "move relevant automation...." is checked, the automation in the fader-automation-lane (within the same time-span as the region being moved) moves, when you move the region.
2016-09-11 03:48:57	jmtrivial	avoca: good to know. does it means the source code is available and should be integrated in ardour easily?
2016-09-11 03:51:02	avoca	jmtrivial: umm, I don't know. The developers might be around here later on. It might be a good idea if you asked them about this.

2016-09-11 04:43:11	jmtrivial	Headwar, avoca: I checked, and in my ardour version, it seems that the gain control points are always moved when you move a region, whenever the option "move relevant automation.." is clicked or not
2016-09-11 04:43:38	Headwar	Mmmm... I dont understand the use of it, then...
2016-09-11 04:44:25	avoca	jmtrivial: same here, yep.
2016-09-11 04:45:25	Headwar	avoca, so it works with MB and not with Ardour ? Thats strange too, I dont understand why MB would have a different behaviour on this
2016-09-11 04:46:11	avoca	I think I'd consider that as expected behaviour. The issue is with moving automation data in automation lanes, when moving regions, and "Move relevant automatin when audio regions are moved" is ticked.
2016-09-11 04:46:52	Headwar	yes exactly. Why would Ardour behave differently on that point ?
2016-09-11 04:47:42	Headwar	Maybe it has something to do with MB being based on Ardour 4, maybe something in the 4->5 transition got lost ?

2016-09-11 08:30:16	tepmurt	Hi
2016-09-11 08:30:34	tepmurt	Am I right that I can't get support on building Ardour for Windows?

2016-09-11 08:35:04	Guest78576	tepmurt, I was asking about A5 Win support earlier - no response unfortunately
2016-09-11 08:35:31	Guest78576	tepmurt, I expect you'll pretty much be on your own with that
2016-09-11 08:35:48	tepmurt	ok... thats unfortunately what I expected...
2016-09-11 08:36:08	tepmurt	spend like the whole day yesterday on trying to compile Ardour...
2016-09-11 08:36:12	tepmurt	*spent
2016-09-11 08:36:33	tepmurt	managed to set up rpmbuild in a Fedora vm
2016-09-11 08:36:55	Guest78576	tepmurt, The main devs don't have anything to do with Win. I believe the bulk of Ardours Win support is as a result of Mixbus
2016-09-11 08:37:49	tepmurt	ah ok...
2016-09-11 08:38:18	tepmurt	but i'll keep on improving while trying to figure it out for myself - hopefully :)
2016-09-11 08:38:19	Guest78576	Ardour wasn't going to offically support Win until someone stepped up to support it so I'm presuming someone is supporting it now
2016-09-11 08:38:35	Guest78576	but I don't know who
2016-09-11 08:39:38	tepmurt	I have a dream ... That one day... Ardour will have a compiled Win Version available for download on their website ^^

2016-09-11 09:32:28		[09:32]
2016-09-11 09:33:42	tepmurt	that means, flac-version.src.rpm is nothing other than an rpm-packaged source-package?

2016-09-11 09:54:30	tepmurt	Put the source for a package in the SOURCES directory, then from within the SPEC directory use rpmbuild to build the RPM package
2016-09-11 09:55:11	tepmurt	That means, i extract foo-version.src.rpm so the new archive is foo-version.src?
2016-09-11 09:55:18	--	mbenson_ is now known as mbenson_away
2016-09-11 09:55:27	tepmurt	And I put foo-version.src in SOURCES folder?
2016-09-11 09:56:58	tepmurt	Or do I use rpmbuild to extract foo-version.src.rpm? This would result in the whole archive(.src.rpm) being extracted, so all the single files are extracted
2016-09-11 09:58:20	melanie__	if you have the src.rpm installed there should be somewhere the tar.gz this one you need in the SOURCES dir and the spec file under SPEC
2016-09-11 09:58:49	melanie__	mom i have allok if i find a good example tutorial
2016-09-11 10:00:01	tepmurt	I didn't install the pkg, i downloaded it using yumdownloader. But yes, I found the tar.gz and the .spec file

2016-09-11 12:51:17		[12:51]
2016-09-11 12:54:57	nocomply	If I change bit depth of some audio files used by ardour will ardour have any trouble referencing them afterwards assuming I keep filenames the same?
2016-09-11 12:58:09	tom-	nocomply: you shouldn't do that, it probably won't work
2016-09-11 12:58:47	nocomply	tom-: is it possible to change it, in batch, within ardour? 
2016-09-11 12:59:44	tom-	nocomply: not easily, with scripting maybe 
2016-09-11 13:00:02	nocomply	hmm ok thanks tom-
2016-09-11 13:00:07	tom-	ardour interally uses the same samplerate and bit depth for all audio
2016-09-11 13:00:50	tom-	so even if you change bit depth and import it to a session, it will be converted to session sr and (by default) ieee float samples
2016-09-11 13:01:31	tom-	doing that with 'sox' is easy though
2016-09-11 13:01:44	nocomply	ah I see, that makes sense. For some reason my last project defaulted to 32 bit and it's enormous
2016-09-11 13:02:15	tom-	do you want to change bit depth to reduce storage use?
2016-09-11 13:02:48	nocomply	Yes. Would it just compress to the same as 16 bit? 
2016-09-11 13:03:20	tom-	there is a setting to what the session defaults
2016-09-11 13:03:33	tom-	you'd set it to 16 wav bit there
2016-09-11 13:04:09	nocomply	tom-: I think I lost my previous preferences and forgot about that setting

2016-09-11 14:09:10	OvenWerks	tom-: there is some plugin querying left from before... but it just prints the answer to stdout... and some of it is not correct.
2016-09-11 14:09:10	tom-	OvenWerks: API in a sense of messages

2016-09-11 14:10:07	OvenWerks	tom-: the bits of plugin querying that are there are just what control ports are there (automation)
2016-09-11 14:10:08	tom-	OvenWerks: subscribe kind of like to a plugin *output* (that can be a meter or on/off toggle or float or ..)
2016-09-11 14:10:25	tom-	OvenWerks: and control inputs of course but that is possible already it think
2016-09-11 14:11:17	OvenWerks	tom-: control ports are controlable, but not queryable.
2016-09-11 14:12:16	tom-	OvenWerks: but the values are queryable?
2016-09-11 14:12:59	OvenWerks	tom-: it seems to me the most important part of a query would be port name of an index plus maybe max/min. Names are wrong for sure.
2016-09-11 14:13:27	OvenWerks	tom-: the only querying I saw outputs responce to stdout, not OSC
2016-09-11 14:13:45	tom-	OvenWerks: i see
2016-09-11 14:14:05	OvenWerks	tom-: I would like a lot more. But I have not started on that.
2016-09-11 14:14:37	OvenWerks	tom-: I would like for any stripable to ask how many plugins are there.
2016-09-11 14:14:47	OvenWerks	tom-: what are they?
2016-09-11 14:14:48	tom-	OvenWerks: yep

2016-09-11 14:15:55	OvenWerks	right
2016-09-11 14:16:00	tom-	?
2016-09-11 14:16:09	tom-	the value range?
2016-09-11 14:16:44	OvenWerks	Ya, value range of 0->1 is most helpful for controls that may control more than one thing.

2016-09-11 14:17:11	tom-	it makes a mapping from a control easy
2016-09-11 14:17:25	OvenWerks	But in the long run knowing raw min/max and actual value are nice too.
2016-09-11 14:17:38	tom-	that's the first thing
2016-09-11 14:17:44	tom-	it's bare access
2016-09-11 14:17:52	tom-	0-1 mapping is a layer in-between
2016-09-11 14:17:53	OvenWerks	tom-: For some things the name gives the actual value while adjust ing.
2016-09-11 14:18:12	tom-	it must consider if a controls is dB-style etc
2016-09-11 14:18:12		[14:18]
2016-09-11 14:18:28	OvenWerks	Most of the ones I have done are.
2016-09-11 14:18:39	tom-	that's good for most things
2016-09-11 14:18:55	tom-	plugins are special, with enums etc
2016-09-11 14:19:04	OvenWerks	Faders and sends are done that way.
2016-09-11 14:19:09	tom-	you can of course map 0-1 to an enum :)
2016-09-11 14:20:01	OvenWerks	tom-: I was doing db values for controls too, but it would not work for both Ardour and mixbus that way. 0-1 is universal.
2016-09-11 14:20:03	tom-	plus min/max are actually important information along the pram name and other properties
2016-09-11 14:21:23	tom-	to get value #3 of an enum, sending 0.x would select it
2016-09-11 14:21:37	OvenWerks	right now I have been concenrating on getting dumb controllers working... if a really (really really) dumb surface can work, then smarter ones can too.
2016-09-11 14:21:38	tom-	compare to selecting it by index or name or id
2016-09-11 14:22:41	OvenWerks	enums get mapped the same as mackie control... not very well :P
2016-09-11 14:24:17	OvenWerks	for example 0, 1, 2 and 3 are 0-.25, .25-.5, .5-.75 and .75-1.0
2016-09-11 14:25:07	OvenWerks	the only thing that uses it right now is the mixbus compressor
2016-09-11 14:26:36	OvenWerks	but that is actually easier than db->fader position mapping (or reverse mapping)
2016-09-11 14:27:16	OvenWerks	which is why faders can be controled in db as well
2016-09-11 14:29:01	tom-	control needs can differ, so having bare access to plugin controls and props of these ports, current values and outputs is vital bo be in the osc api at one time or the other
2016-09-11 14:29:28	OvenWerks	yes, it will get there.
2016-09-11 14:29:41	tom-	all smartness can be "on top" of that :)
2016-09-11 14:30:59	OvenWerks	right now, it seems making touchosc etc. work is pretty important. It seems that kind of thing is what is most common.
2016-09-11 14:31:42	tom-	you can't make that work universally without making a choice or comrpomises
2016-09-11 14:32:01	OvenWerks	In general, if it works with that, most other things can deal with it to.
2016-09-11 14:32:21	OvenWerks	I am hoping the choices can be user choices.
2016-09-11 14:32:35	OvenWerks	That is whay there is now an OSC setup GUI.
2016-09-11 14:32:36	tom-	touchosc is certainly a good example of a possible osc controller
2016-09-11 14:32:58	OvenWerks	I have had more questions about getting that work than anything else.
2016-09-11 14:33:14	tom-	it is not static so you must make a choice of how it will be used
2016-09-11 14:33:14		[14:33]
2016-09-11 14:33:49	tom-	the current api isn't designed for fully-fledged touchosc apps
2016-09-11 14:33:54	OvenWerks	However, I don't wish to allow google my financal info to get it when I don't have a use for it.
2016-09-11 14:34:24	tom-	you can make it work, for a given case
2016-09-11 14:34:43	OvenWerks	you might be surprised. It should be possible with touchosc to get pretty close to a mackie control or maybe better.
2016-09-11 14:35:11	OvenWerks	(should)
2016-09-11 14:35:24	tom-	so mackie  is the standard? lol :)
2016-09-11 14:36:08	tom-	well at least it's a standard and it works
2016-09-11 14:36:27	OvenWerks	we could try to make MPC the standard...
2016-09-11 14:36:35	tom-	but why not use mackie then, a few midi bytes iiuc
2016-09-11 14:37:15	OvenWerks	mackie is just my base line. OSC should be at least as good. Then better.
2016-09-11 14:38:03	OvenWerks	my personal setup is already better in my opinion...
2016-09-11 14:38:56	OvenWerks	but for touchosc, doing mackie control like is pushing things already (look at touchdaw for example)
2016-09-11 14:39:58	tom-	pushing things to the touchosc interface is what makes it interesting
2016-09-11 14:40:04	OvenWerks	this http://harrisonconsoles.com/site/images/mpc5/creativesound.png is just a control surface. I think there are 10 encoders per strip
2016-09-11 14:40:57	tom-	pretty nice room there ..
2016-09-11 14:41:37	tom-	is that mackie now?
2016-09-11 14:41:38	OvenWerks	it's not OSC, but I am told the controls are accessed by OSC like paths
2016-09-11 14:41:52	OvenWerks	NO

2016-09-11 23:43:06	tepmurt	basically, I want a decent DAW on Windows for free. Moreover, it'll hopefully helps me getting some informatics experience
2016-09-11 23:46:46	timbyr	tepmurt, In that case it would probably be easier with the official build scripts then using debian. You won't have to worry about building all the packages etc.

2016-09-12 03:31:49	rgareus	Headwar: how do you define idle?
2016-09-12 03:31:59	rgareus	empty session, no tracks (no plugins)
2016-09-12 03:31:59	rgareus	?
2016-09-12 03:32:14	Headwar	No, just opened a V4 version
2016-09-12 03:32:41	Headwar	I mean, not playing, and after a little while so than no plugin is loading whatsoever
2016-09-12 03:32:59	rgareus	maybe a reverb plugin
2016-09-12 03:33:06	Headwar	interesting
2016-09-12 03:33:36	rgareus	Headwar: check Preferences > Audio > Denormals 
2016-09-12 03:33:40	Headwar	i ll try disabling any. It would make little sense though, as this very session worked perfectly on my 14.04 ubuntu
2016-09-12 03:33:47	Headwar	ok, will do
2016-09-12 03:33:50	Headwar	thanks
2016-09-12 03:34:32	rgareus	if some reverb produces tiny signals (denormals) it can take 50-100x the CPU compared to processing normal audio data   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormal_number#Performance_issues
2016-09-12 03:34:32		[03:34]
2016-09-12 03:34:33	LAbot	Title: Denormal number - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
2016-09-12 03:35:08	rgareus	Headwar: you can't /disable/ plugins easily.    starting ardour in "safe-mode"    Ardour5 --disable-plugins    is one option
2016-09-12 03:35:24	rgareus	but otherwise Ardour always processes audio, and runs plugins
2016-09-12 03:36:22	rgareus	Headwar: does the problem go away when you start playing?   if so it's probably not a denormal issue
2016-09-12 03:36:37	Headwar	I can still open my session and deactivate plugins, right ?
2016-09-12 03:37:22	Headwar	no, the playback is herrendous, stuttering and playing at 1/2 the normal speed
2016-09-12 03:37:44	rgareus	Headwar: yes, but depending on the plugin, bypass  will only bypass the signal around the plugin.   the plugin may or may not run, anyway
2016-09-12 03:37:56	rgareus	Headwar: same buffersize as you've used before?
2016-09-12 03:37:58	Headwar	oh ok
2016-09-12 03:38:08	Headwar	yes, same exact jack configuration
2016-09-12 03:38:11	rgareus	mmh
2016-09-12 03:38:59	Headwar	though clicking the Pref>Audio>denormals seems to work. I need to let it play for a while to be sure
2016-09-12 03:39:18	rgareus	Headwar:  I'd check first with    Ardour5 --disable-plugins   #  if that's fine, then re-start and check bypassing plugins
2016-09-12 03:39:18	Headwar	it sometimes happens after 1 min or 2
2016-09-12 03:40:17	rgareus	ok, then it is a denormal issue then, after all.    reverb tail becoming less loud and less loud.... 
2016-09-12 03:40:37	rgareus	and reaching -300dBFS or so and then the CPU has a hard time.
2016-09-12 03:40:57	Headwar	I spoke too soon. It's back
2016-09-12 03:41:17	Headwar	I'll try --disable-plugins
2016-09-12 03:42:40	Headwar	and now that I've left Ardour, compiz takes up all my cpu 
2016-09-12 03:43:55	Headwar	how is Ardour even related to compiz ?!

2016-09-12 03:57:48	Headwar	rgareus, --disable-plugins seems to work. How can it work on the same machine in 14.04 and not in 16.04 ? Am I supposed to replace my calf-reverbs. What would you suggest ?
2016-09-12 03:59:18	rgareus	IMHO one should never ever load a calf-reverb in the first place.
2016-09-12 03:59:55	rgareus	unless you're fine to risk some speaker blasting +300dB noise on occasion :)
2016-09-12 04:00:15	rgareus	Headwar: maybe different version of calf?
2016-09-12 04:00:25	rgareus	in 14.04 and 16.04
2016-09-12 04:03:08	Headwar	That could be it, despite using Kxstudio repos. And what reverb would you recommend ?

2016-09-12 06:49:26		[06:49]
2016-09-12 06:49:27	rgareus	Guest73111: 'constrained drag'  is the term for it,  IIRC  hold  "Alt" when starting a drag
2016-09-12 06:50:02	rgareus	first direction of movement decides if the drag is constained  horiz or vertically.   at least for audio, I don't know if it applies to MIDI notes as well
2016-09-12 06:50:20	rgareus	Preferences > User Interaction    allows to customize the modifier
2016-09-12 06:50:46	rgareus	some WMs do catch  Alt + mouse drag.

2016-09-12 16:12:23	nstewart	those two points I think is what makes it plausible. 1) don't try to do it in real time. 2) assumption of domain knowledge about the instrument being processed.

2016-09-12 16:33:23	Stuzz	Perhaps in the AVLinux manual?
2016-09-12 16:33:55	Arber	maybe i don't recall it right now
2016-09-12 16:34:41	Arber	my point is i installed some dlls into the usr/bin/local/vst folder

2016-09-12 16:35:02	Arber	am i doing something wrong?

2016-09-13 00:39:24	magnetophon	everything works as it should, it's just that I'd like to route e few more tracks away from the master and on to the monitor bus.
2016-09-13 00:39:59	JL__	magnetophon: a way is to vreate an audio bus
2016-09-13 00:40:46	JL__	witj needed tracks roted to, and send this audio bus out to another physical out
2016-09-13 00:41:02	JL__	magnetophon: ^^
2016-09-13 00:42:07	JL__	magnetophon: ans sure sure " disconnect " those tracks from master
2016-09-13 00:42:30	magnetophon	JL__: that's the workaround I'm using now, but I'd like the volume  mono switch and such from the monitor section to affect those tracks
2016-09-13 00:43:15	magnetophon	s/volume  mono/volume  control and the mono/s
2016-09-13 00:43:47	avoca	magnetophon: Here, in qjackctl, I can route tracks directly to the Monitor Bus

2016-09-13 02:05:17	magnetophon	rgareus: thanks, but different use case.  the tracks in question are full mixes of the song I'm working on.  One track has all versions of my own mix layered on top of each other (I rtecord each mix version in to the session and snapshot the session with the name of that region), another track has the rough mix of the guy that recorded it.  These are all trcks that I never want to hear simultaneously with the master, let alone be mixed into

2016-09-13 02:11:16	magnetophon	Does anyone else record the mix into the session, so it's easy to compare the current state with any of the older states?  Sometimes you "go to far" in a mix, and a quick compare will often tell you.  It's also really useful to have  a snapshot of the session with the name of the mixed region, so if you discover version 3 was better, you can easily go back.
2016-09-13 02:11:16		[02:11]
2016-09-13 02:13:02	magnetophon	rgareus: as a matter of fact, if I leave the mixdown track connected to the master, ardour will complain about feedback. The monitor bus is perfect   :)
2016-09-13 02:16:53	oofus_lt	rgareus: The term Post Fader is perfectly acceptable when talking about the position of something, as is Pre Fader, so buttons should have 'Pre' and 'Post' as lables rather than single latters.

2016-09-13 06:29:30	trombada	hi, I got some great soundfont files which have great drumkit sounds, but i'd like to record each drum separetely (kick drum in one track, snare in another, hi-hat, etc)
2016-09-13 06:29:44	trombada	just like Producer Kits drums on Logic Pro
2016-09-13 06:30:01	trombada	is it possible to do this on ardour? I'm using fluidsynth
2016-09-13 06:30:31	las	trombada: you'd need an instance of fluidsynth on each track

2016-09-13 07:13:55	rgareus	the libfluidsynth bundled with libardour can share sf2 across instances. it's just that the LV2 plugin can't.
2016-09-13 07:14:27	rgareus	a lua-scripted' synth could make use of the fluidsynth cache.

2016-09-13 07:25:49	trombada	rgareus: would you have some code example on this? never scripted in lua, neither for ardour. A sample code that gets a midi note (C2 and D2) and routes them for different busses or other tracks would be great
2016-09-13 07:26:02	trombada	rgareus: are you an ardour developer?

2016-09-13 07:29:38	rgareus	trombada: a lot of the lua-API is still work in progress, as is the documentation  http://manual.ardour.org/lua-scripting/class_reference/
2016-09-13 07:30:59	rgareus	on the upside, the current ARDOUR:FluidSynth lua object does use a shared file cache automatically;   but I have not tested it.
2016-09-13 07:36:00		[07:30]
2016-09-13 07:40:47	trombada	i will try the fluidsynth one first
2016-09-13 07:41:03	trombada	share the results if i get something useful
2016-09-13 07:42:14	rgareus	trombada: the alternative is hacking a-fluidsynth.lv2  -- but it's statically linked and every instance has its own copy of libfluidsynth.  no shared cache is possible
2016-09-13 07:42:31	rgareus	that's because there are no threading guarantees for multiple plugin instances
2016-09-13 07:42:55	trombada	rgareus: yep
2016-09-13 07:43:47	rgareus	but if it's /just for you/  you can add some locks and hacks if you need to get a job done quick
2016-09-13 07:44:30	rgareus	as opposed to lua scripts it requires recompiling ardour, though

2016-09-13 09:46:55	trombada	rgareus: las: drumgizmo seems to be the plugin which is nearest of that objetive. If it could just take SF2 samples as input. Currently, it only receives quantizied wav files as input
2016-09-13 09:47:32	nstewart_	that's what I was thinking while ago
2016-09-13 09:47:47	trombada	but as you told the it's not that simple because of multi-threading limitations and the need to load library for each output
2016-09-13 09:47:48	nstewart_	I think the DG folks have some work going into making it easier to assemble kits
2016-09-13 09:47:58	trombada	cool
2016-09-13 09:48:43	nstewart_	I know I have a kit I want to sample for DG, but my mic selection wouldn't make good use of DG's capabilities
2016-09-13 09:48:54	trombada	SF2 samples are great, but if I can't mix it individually it's just a "toy"
2016-09-13 09:48:59	rgareus	trombada: sf2 is not sufficient for what DG does.
2016-09-13 09:49:41	nstewart_	I need to sample my 32" marching bass and 12x15 gut marching snare "kit". 
2016-09-13 09:49:41	rgareus	trombada: you could extract all the samples from a sf2  and then create a drumgizmo kit from them
2016-09-13 09:50:01	trombada	hmm, they already have midi filtering, if they could just read standard drumsets and cache each drum "data" 
2016-09-13 09:50:11	nstewart_	and then shove it all into storage, cause that monster takes up a lot of floor space
2016-09-13 09:50:57	trombada	rgareus: yeah, just thinking in a non-manual way to do that, becuase I would have to extract 128 wav samples for each midi note 
2016-09-13 09:51:42	rgareus	trombada: are you sure?  it's usually just 3 or 4 samples per drum,  not one for every velocity
2016-09-13 09:51:49	rgareus	trombada: swami  (is a sf2 editor)
2016-09-13 09:52:00	trombada	hmmm, nice, will take a look
2016-09-13 09:52:03	nstewart_	yeah - I think 5 levels is the most I've seen
2016-09-13 09:52:09	rgareus	you can extract with that.  or maybe synthclone
2016-09-13 09:52:20	trombada	on last instance I will try the lua scripting
2016-09-13 09:52:27	trombada	great man
2016-09-13 09:52:27	nstewart_	althought I think DG supports round robin samples so you don't stutter on repeated hits
2016-09-13 09:52:30	trombada	love you guys
2016-09-13 09:52:41	rgareus	http://libremusicproduction.com/tools/synthclone   plays all notes  on all channels..  and saves the samples
2016-09-13 09:52:42	LAbot	Title: Synthclone | Libre Music Production (at libremusicproduction.com)
2016-09-13 09:52:50	trombada	perfect

2016-09-13 09:53:21	rgareus	but if you have a .sf2 already, http://www.swamiproject.org/ is probably faster & easier
2016-09-13 09:53:22	LAbot	Title: Swami Project MIDI Instrument Designer Software (at www.swamiproject.org)
2016-09-13 09:53:44	trombada	i have a collection of huge sf2 i was grabbing from internet
2016-09-13 09:53:49	nstewart_	if you have an sf2 you could probably write a script to feed it midi and stuff it into DG format
2016-09-13 09:53:52	trombada	swami seems to be the way
2016-09-13 09:54:39	trombada	yeah, they have good docs on how to create DG patchs. I have a real drum-kit, but when composing, it's not practical to play all the instruments 
2016-09-13 09:54:58	trombada	easier to play simple drum rhythms on midi controller
2016-09-13 09:55:40	trombada	DG has good patches too, but missing some drums that SF2 has
2016-09-13 09:55:42	trombada	have*
2016-09-13 09:57:02	trombada	the only thing I couldn't replace from Logic Pro was that so far

2016-09-13 09:57:52	trombada	satisfactory*

2016-09-13 09:58:41	nstewart_	when writing, I can usually get a couple bars take that I like. Then cut n paste while working out structure
2016-09-13 09:59:13	trombada	yea, that's what i do, although, even using midi drums I like to have a good mixed result on end

2016-09-13 10:00:24	trombada	nstewart_: in Logic Pro they have all that sugary stuff for songwriters that I rarely use, but the PRoducer Kit thing is really great to get better results with synth drums

2016-09-13 10:01:26	trombada	I got surprised with Linux for music production after I started using kxstudio repos

2016-09-13 14:49:00	nstewart	yes. that's where I see that message
2016-09-13 14:49:13	las	rgareus: i couldn't really break that one apart
2016-09-13 14:49:27	las	rgareus: it required API changes all the way down the MIDI source-read stack
2016-09-13 14:49:41	las	rgareus: and the changes impacted the logic, so i felt it best to keep things together
2016-09-13 14:49:51	nstewart	whew. not mine.
2016-09-13 14:50:11	las	rgareus: the basic idea is the same in all cases though: if you're reading MIDI and are given a loop range, map all events stamped after the end of the loop back into the loop
2016-09-13 14:50:21	rgareus	las: is the loop-range is global session time?  and translated to source-time?
2016-09-13 14:50:24	las	s/reading MIDI/reading a MIDI source/
2016-09-13 14:50:27	las	rgareus: not global
2016-09-13 14:50:54	las	rgareus: set up by a MidiDiskstream that has had ::set_loop_location() called on it for seamless looping
2016-09-13 14:51:02	nstewart	ahah. Could be: "The program 'luac5.3' is currently not installed. " Might do it
2016-09-13 14:51:26	las	rgareus: my description makes no sense, by the way :(
2016-09-13 14:51:38	rgareus	nstewart: it's not really needed,  ardour includes a compiler and compiles it just in time.  
2016-09-13 14:52:02	nstewart	yeah, after I said that I realized that the other scripts load and populate the dialog.
2016-09-13 14:52:19	rgareus	nstewart: but  it comes in handy for testing ..
2016-09-13 14:52:26	nstewart	but wasn't going to call attention to my jumping to conclusions
2016-09-13 14:52:26	rgareus	nstewart:  on debian:   lua5.3 
2016-09-13 14:52:41	rgareus	las: did you test varispeed looping?
2016-09-13 14:53:06	rgareus	las: IIRC the diskstream re-maps events in that case.
2016-09-13 14:54:34	las	rgareus: seems to work
2016-09-13 14:54:46	las	(testing with some bach and arbitrarily placed loops)
2016-09-13 14:55:24	rgareus	nice
2016-09-13 14:55:33	rgareus	I'm still compiling .. 770/910
2016-09-13 15:01:00		[14:55]
2016-09-13 15:10:05	nstewart	so adding a script sucks it into the session. Probably a noble feature, but how do I make sure I'm testing what I think I'm running?
2016-09-13 15:16:00		[15:10]
2016-09-13 15:17:31	rgareus	nstewart: remove, re-add the script
2016-09-13 15:17:40	rgareus	there's no versioning, yet
2016-09-13 15:19:42	ristic	Is it possible for me to somehow export midi from Ardour along with pitch bend and modulation in the midi file?
2016-09-13 15:19:52	ristic	Does this meet the midi spec at all even?
2016-09-13 15:21:09	rgareus	since they're midi events thet should be in the .mid file in the interchange folder already.   and exporting should also write those events in the exported .mid
2016-09-13 15:21:25	ristic	One thing I've noticed so far is recording midi to a new track (to bounce a whole lot of regions into one), the modulation and pitch bend does not seem to be recorded
2016-09-13 15:22:35	ristic	Oh no wait I lie
2016-09-13 15:22:37	rgareus	mod-wheel is just a control-change, usually CC-1
2016-09-13 15:22:54	ristic	It does, just didn't show up until I stopped the recording.
2016-09-13 15:22:55	rgareus	that should be bounced and exported
2016-09-13 15:23:21	ristic	I assume reasonable synth does not handle pitch bend?
2016-09-13 15:23:57	rgareus	correct, that'd be unreasonable for a piano :)

2016-09-13 15:35:58	ristic	Is there a way to change the tempo of a midi region?
2016-09-13 15:36:11	ristic	Or meter or something along those lines.
2016-09-13 15:36:25	Stuzz	regions don't have tempos
2016-09-13 15:37:02	ristic	I opened a 4.7 Ardour project in 5.3 and the midi is half time.

2016-09-14 02:33:14	deva	I I have had a couple of "why can I not see the plugin gui when I double click it" reports. And usually it is because they didn't see/know about libsuil which was missing
2016-09-14 02:33:47	deva	Or is Ardour only depending on libsuil indirectly through lilv?

2016-09-14 02:50:56	deva	Yes, but it's not cosidered an error
2016-09-14 02:51:06	rgareus	deva: why? you can also compile ardour w/o LV2 support
2016-09-14 02:51:12	deva	I am aware that it is optional, but to most users this should be an error
2016-09-14 02:51:45	rgareus	deva: I'd argue that those users should not compile ardour, then.
2016-09-14 02:51:46	deva	I cannot think of a reason why anybody would enable lv2 without also enabling uis
2016-09-14 02:51:57	deva	why not?
2016-09-14 02:52:25	rgareus	deva: suil can depend on QT4, QT5, Gtk2, Gtk3...  we can't reasonably require it
2016-09-14 02:52:33	deva	That'
2016-09-14 02:52:36	deva	oups
2016-09-14 02:53:05	deva	That's why I suggest waf to only consider it an error unless the user explicitly tells configure not to use it
2016-09-14 02:53:47	deva	An alternative would be to print a loud and noisy warning "You will not be able to see lv2 plugin UIs because you don't have libsuil installed"
2016-09-14 02:54:03	rgareus	deva: making an optional dependency a required one IFF some other option is set sounds really wrong to me.

2016-09-14 02:58:44	Headwar	deva, it does, but according to some of your bug reports, it's not clear enough. Though rgareus is right, if you don't know what a wrench is, dont build your own car...

2016-09-14 03:30:14	deva	yes
2016-09-14 03:30:20	deva	then no, I guess ;)
2016-09-14 03:30:21	rgareus	I thought I answered those.
2016-09-14 03:30:28	rgareus	but maybe it was someone else asking
2016-09-14 03:30:31	deva	I am trying to implement something for DG
2016-09-14 03:30:45	deva	But since we are not using cairo we cannot create a cairo surface
2016-09-14 03:31:03	rgareus	deva: the inline display is a raw RGB[A] bitmap
2016-09-14 03:31:04	deva	And so far all my attempts at creating a RGBA buffer has failed
2016-09-14 03:31:41	deva	Also; whe is it allowed to reallocate the buffer?
2016-09-14 03:31:45	rgareus	pixmap = malloc (width * height * 4 /*bytes per pixel*/); 
2016-09-14 03:32:00	deva	In theory yes
2016-09-14 03:32:25	deva	But I get crashes if I reallocate on size change
2016-09-14 03:32:51	rgareus	deva: https://github.com/x42/lv2/blob/master-rg/lv2/ardour.org/ns/ext/inline-display/inline-display.h#L77
2016-09-14 03:33:00	deva	and I cannot see any changes when changing the stride parameter
2016-09-14 03:33:06	rgareus	"The data pointer is owned by the plugin and must be valid rom the first call to render until cleanup"
2016-09-14 03:33:25	deva	Hmm... ok
2016-09-14 03:33:34	rgareus	stride is  usually    width * 4
2016-09-14 03:34:08	deva	aah... stride is in bytes and not pixels....
2016-09-14 03:34:15	deva	Damn... have I really been that stupid!
2016-09-14 03:34:23	deva	That might explain a fre things
2016-09-14 03:34:29	rgareus	it's useful in case you have an odd width and want to align it to 2^N memory
2016-09-14 03:34:57	rgareus	it's very common in textures or hardware accellerated video.   I've added it mainly so that you can re-use openGL textures
2016-09-14 03:35:12	rgareus	but in your case,  just  width * 4  will do
2016-09-14 03:35:12		[03:35]
2016-09-14 03:35:15	deva	sounds like a good diea
2016-09-14 03:35:17	deva	*idea
2016-09-14 03:35:44	deva	but what if the host decides to make a bigger display area and I need to reallocate to make room for it?
2016-09-14 03:36:07	deva	Should then just store the old pointer somewhere safe and the allocate a new buffer and set that in the context?
2016-09-14 03:36:32	rgareus	deva: it's safe to call   free() and malloc ()  in  the render_method
2016-09-14 03:36:35	rgareus	and return a new pointer
2016-09-14 03:36:50	deva	That's what I tried which failed
2016-09-14 03:37:03	deva	But that might have been a sideeffect of the stride value...
2016-09-14 03:37:16	deva	I'll give it another go and let you know how it pans out

2016-09-14 03:39:12	deva	rgareus, I'm not sure yet. But the load progress would be pretty cool
2016-09-14 03:39:37	rgareus	deva: one thing you might want to investigate:   gimp can save images as  "raw RGBA"  c-header
2016-09-14 03:39:38	deva	We also joked about the gizmo head blinking it's eyes on each input node :-)
2016-09-14 03:40:22	deva	Our internal UI engine already works in RGBA so adapting the rendering to the inline display buffer shoudl be very easy for us
2016-09-14 03:40:47	rgareus	so you could just make 2 images: small kit  hit/no-hit  and then copy relevant areas.   scaling the image might be a bit tricky though.
2016-09-14 03:41:18	deva	We have scaling as well :-)
2016-09-14 03:41:53	deva	I never cease to be amazed at how little of the code in a plugin is actually doing audio stuff :-p
2016-09-14 03:42:44	rgareus	not only plugins
2016-09-14 03:43:11	rgareus	pretty much every application I've worked on (incl. web-apps)  the GUI dominates by far.
2016-09-14 03:43:12	deva	Aah, you mean hosts as well?
2016-09-14 03:43:32	rgareus	in ardour, the vast complexity is in the GUI and code as well
2016-09-14 03:43:50	deva	I guess the UI is the window into to inner algorithms, so bad ui makes bad program, no matter how well written the inner algorithms might be
2016-09-14 03:44:58	deva	rgareus, It works: http://aasimon.org/public/dg-embedded.png

2016-09-14 05:13:29	Alby_Fox	it seems asinine
2016-09-14 05:14:37	rgareus	Alby_Fox: there should be a dialog in this case
2016-09-14 05:14:52	Alby_Fox	was there a little checkbox that I didn't see?
2016-09-14 05:14:54	rgareus	Alby_Fox: "cannot save session, quit anyway?"  or something along those lines
2016-09-14 05:15:12	rgareus	maybe that dialog shows up behind the main window or on some other screen?  (KDE?)
2016-09-14 05:15:22	Alby_Fox	mine says that sessions can't be loaded or unloaded when not connected to a backend, and then it freezes and has to be killed, so maybe it's a distro build thing
2016-09-14 05:15:35	Alby_Fox	and it is separate from the save or do not save window
2016-09-14 05:15:45	Alby_Fox	which is irrelevant because I can neither save nor not save

2016-09-14 05:24:39	Alby_Fox	it is my policy with a user friendly distro to always stick to the supplied package management repositories whenever possible

2016-09-14 05:48:55	Alby_Fox	A system, to me, is an ecosystem, and compilation is a less safe operation inside of that ecosystem than using binaries with the stamp of approval of the distro. There's no telling what offshoot of an offshoot of something got installed at some time and unexpectedly impacted some other thing, and nobody on the whole of the internet has ever had the problem you are having - and that is greatly compounded by constantly modifying aspects of a system to meet 
2016-09-14 05:48:55	Alby_Fox	every prerequisite of every ./configure - though they may be entirely innocuous from the perspective of the development of a single piece of software, as a gestalt, for me, for what I do and how I am, compilation of source files from the maker of the software is the last thing I want to try in order to get something to work because it is the most dangerous to the software ecosystem

2016-09-14 06:28:31	rgareus	almost back to normal here
2016-09-14 06:30:25	tom-	i suppose that was the move
2016-09-14 06:30:25		[06:30]
2016-09-14 06:30:57	tom-	rgareus: maybe you have a hint on how to read plugin output port values from a script
2016-09-14 06:33:49	tom-	rgareus: scenario: some plugin sets it's output to 1 or 0. another plugin does stuff based on the output state of the first plugin
2016-09-14 06:34:16	tom-	rgareus: 2nd plugin should be able to (easily) read state of first plugin
2016-09-14 06:34:40	rgareus	tom-: just   CtrlPorts:array ()    should do it
2016-09-14 06:35:14	tom-	rgareus: that will get the ones from "self"
2016-09-14 06:35:34	rgareus	oh wait. there's a bug.
2016-09-14 06:35:35	tom-	rgareus: if im plugin a, i'd like to ask output of plugin b
2016-09-14 06:36:01	tom-	just one (left)? :) 
2016-09-14 06:36:49	tom-	rgareus: what a bug?
2016-09-14 06:36:57	rgareus	reading the data in the inline display
2016-09-14 06:37:13	rgareus	of the same plugin
2016-09-14 06:37:22	tom-	that seems to work
2016-09-14 06:38:00	rgareus	yeah, except you get the "shadow data" from the previous cycle.
2016-09-14 06:38:13	rgareus	tom-:  scripts/s_plugin_automation.lua  has an example how to get plugin port data in general
2016-09-14 06:38:50	rgareus	get the track/bus that has the plugin   then     local al, cl, pd = ARDOUR.LuaAPI.plugin_automation (r:nth_plugin (NNN), PPP)
2016-09-14 06:39:17	tom-	rgareus: yes, but isn't that just for input ports, automating them?
2016-09-14 06:39:44	rgareus	the complete example, yes
2016-09-14 06:40:17	tom-	rgareus: i'd like to get just one value (no automation involved), from out *output* port, as is left from the plugin after process()
2016-09-14 06:40:46	tom-	rgareus: first thing is to know if that's possible. if yes, i'd have to look further
2016-09-14 06:41:25	rgareus	ARDOUR.LuaAPI.plugin_automation is just a convenience wrapper.  to get all 3 relevant objects.  in your case the ControlList will suffice
2016-09-14 06:41:52	rgareus	tom-: http://manual.ardour.org/lua-scripting/brain_dump/  has a piecewise example near the end
2016-09-14 06:42:07	rgareus	tom-: search  "read/set/describe a plugin parameter"
2016-09-14 06:42:52	rgareus	the ardour internal API is rather elaborate.   PluginInsert -> Plugin -> ParameterDesc -> Parameter 
2016-09-14 06:43:06	rgareus	which kinda sucks, and hence I've added a   ARDOUR.LuaAPI.plugin_automation  wrapper
2016-09-14 06:43:57	rgareus	I suppose I should also add a  get_processor_param() call
2016-09-14 06:44:35	tom-	ARDOUR.LuaAPI.set_processor_param (proc, 2, 1.0)
2016-09-14 06:44:56	tom-	rgareus: i'd use a ARDOUR.LuaAPI.get_processor_param (proc, 2) -- if there would be one :)
2016-09-14 06:45:21	tom-	rather ARDOUR.LuaAPI.set_processor_param_value (proc, 2)
2016-09-14 06:45:24	tom-	em
2016-09-14 06:45:29	tom-	rather ARDOUR.LuaAPI.get_processor_param_value (proc, 2)
2016-09-14 06:45:29		[06:45]
2016-09-14 06:46:10	tom-	ARDOUR.LuaAPI.set_processor_param (proc, 2, 1.0) --already exists, is easy enough to use
2016-09-14 06:47:26	tom-	rgareus: that would either return the current value set on an input or output port
2016-09-14 06:47:34	tom-	what do you think?
2016-09-14 06:48:14	Headwar	las, about your last mail in the mailing list, "if a loop begins in the middle of a note..." : As a perfect solution would be CPU intensive, maybe the 1st time the lopp is played, all the "note off" (without a "note on" before) events could be collected so that the 2nd and later playing of the loop *do* play those notes ? Or (if you're buffering the midi prior to playing it) we could look into that buffer and see 
2016-09-14 06:48:14	Headwar	what orphans "note off" events happen and play them from the start ? That obviously doesn't take into account the notes that start before the loop and end after it, or in the second case the notes that are outside of the buffer, but it's very light in computations and encompasses a majority of use cases imho. 
2016-09-14 06:48:14	tom-	rgareus: ah.. i overlooked your last msg. yes!

2016-09-14 06:50:09	las	Headwar: that's a clever idea
2016-09-14 06:51:19	Headwar	:) Is there a case where a note off happens and there is no note on before ?
2016-09-14 06:52:04	Headwar	I read too that sometimes a note on with a velocity=0 sould be considered a note off
2016-09-14 06:52:18	rgareus	that is correct
2016-09-14 06:52:19	Alby_Fox	There's nothing int he rulebook that says a dog can't play midi noteoff events without first playing a noteon
2016-09-14 06:52:21	tom-	i think there are many edge-cases if you want to be smart on note-on /off at (loop) boundaries
2016-09-14 06:52:21	nstewart__	can I specifiy a command line option for the backend? --name appears to be something else. 
2016-09-14 06:52:34	las	Headwar: if a loop (or any playback) begins in the middle of a note, there will be a note off event with no preceding note on
2016-09-14 06:52:48	las	Headwar: we internally normalize note_on+velocity=0 into note_off
2016-09-14 06:52:52	tom-	take a note, that's beginning from frame 0, ending at session end. put a loop onto it, what should it do?
2016-09-14 06:53:29	tom-	should it a) not play anything
2016-09-14 06:53:34	rgareus	las: the state-tracker should eat that note-off  (if there wasn't a note-on), won't it?
2016-09-14 06:53:40	tom-	b) begin playing at start of loop, stop at end
2016-09-14 06:53:42	Headwar	tom, obviously in a perfect world, it should play but it would be very cpu intensive to look for every note on/off prior to the start of the loop. Hence a non-perfect solution
2016-09-14 06:53:58	tom-	etc etc. it can't do the right thing sound-wise
2016-09-14 06:54:16	rgareus	in a perfect world, MIDI would not exist in the first place.
2016-09-14 06:54:37	las	rgareus: define "eat"
2016-09-14 06:54:40	tom-	i'm happy it exists
2016-09-14 06:54:55	tom-	it was good enough decades ago and still works
2016-09-14 06:55:02	las	Headwar: actually, in real world scenarios, it isn't *that* expensive to look at all events from the beginning of time
2016-09-14 06:55:13	rgareus	las: the event should be dropped / ignored

2016-09-14 06:55:28	tom-	if edge-cases can't be solved (for problem x), it's hard to be smart imho
2016-09-14 06:56:24	tom-	Headwar: i'm not sure i fully understand what would be different with that non-perfect solution
2016-09-14 06:56:42	rgareus	ie. if a note is already on (velocity > 0)  don't send another note-on.   and likewise with note-off.
2016-09-14 06:56:50	tom-	Headwar: sound-wise. would it play note-off from notes that started (but not ended) at the right side loop boundary?
2016-09-14 06:57:01	las	rgareus: the tracker certainly won't do anything with the note off
2016-09-14 06:57:22	rgareus	las: it should :)
2016-09-14 06:57:34	Headwar	With my (unperfect) solution, we wouldn't have to programmatically loop through all the midi events prior to the musical loop to find all the possible notes started before
2016-09-14 06:57:35	las	rgareus: when there is no record of the note being on
2016-09-14 06:57:38	tom-	rgareus: why not? it could be the same note but another velocity
2016-09-14 06:58:04	rgareus	tom-: you have 2 optionsin that case:  ignore the new note-on, or insert a note-off 
2016-09-14 06:58:07	tom-	rgareus:  a receiver shouldn't care about a 2nd note-on if there is no note-off imho
2016-09-14 06:58:23	rgareus	note-on  -> note-on  -> note-off -> note-off    makes no sense
2016-09-14 06:58:24	tom-	rgareus: re-issue the note-on
2016-09-14 06:58:30	tom-	rgareus: is imho the right thing to do
2016-09-14 06:58:42	las	rgareus: i just realized what i was originally thinking about for the MIDI I/O simplification (re: yesterday's discussion about it)
2016-09-14 06:59:06	tom-	rgareus: note-on -> note-on -> note-off
2016-09-14 06:59:13	rgareus	tom-: try it on a keyboard.
2016-09-14 06:59:20	las	rgareus: i think that ignoring (for a moment) the actual cost, the ideal scenario is something that flattens an entire playlist into an efficient linear sequence of bytes
2016-09-14 06:59:41	las	rgareus: or at least, iterable
2016-09-14 07:00:03	rgareus	las: at every change?
2016-09-14 07:00:13	tom-	rgareus: case a) note-on -> note-on: the note is retriggered (with a possibly new velocity)
2016-09-14 07:00:21	las	rgareus: this would require that edits happen at the region level (preferably where each region uses the same structure as the playlist)
2016-09-14 07:00:24	las	rgareus: and then cause the playlist level version to change also
2016-09-14 07:00:28	las	rgareus: yes, at every change
2016-09-14 07:00:35	tom-	rgareus: case b) note-off -> note-off -> the second note off (if there is one) is just ignored

2016-09-14 07:01:33	rgareus	tom-: there is after-touch
2016-09-14 07:02:33	rgareus	las: even with a couple of Philip Glass sequences, just flatting the sequence internally (not GUI) should be fast
2016-09-14 07:03:12	las	rgareus: that was my feeling too
2016-09-14 07:03:27	rgareus	las: and it'll only need to be updated when the sequence changes.  and modern CPUs are good at counting to 1M or more :)
2016-09-14 07:03:29	tom-	rgareus: yes, and that works totally independent iirc
2016-09-14 07:03:57	rgareus	las: just don't use a std::something that allocates memory for every event :)  those are slooooow.
2016-09-14 07:04:43	las	rgareus: this way, the midi diskstream would really just be the owner of this flattened representation, and all playback would happen using it, rather than going to the playlist
2016-09-14 07:04:44	rgareus	tom-: I don't see how   note on,  note on    makes sense.   there might be a few odd synths that can cope with it..
2016-09-14 07:04:59	las	rgareus: you cannot play note on+note on for the same note on any known device
2016-09-14 07:05:05	tom-	rgareus: well it would be a product of a side-effect in the first place
2016-09-14 07:05:23	las	rgareus: you can only create it on a computer, which is why Ardour offers 5 options for how to resolve the situation when this occurs due to an edit
2016-09-14 07:05:23	tom-	rgareus: i.e. two midistream playing the same synth or similar
2016-09-14 07:06:19	nstewart__	thanks rgareus - finally got it logging something. now to try ripping through the list of selected regions
2016-09-14 07:06:29	las	rgareus: semantically, there is a semi-sensible interpretation, but yes, i doubt that many synths would support it
2016-09-14 07:06:34	tom-	rgareus: but the behaviour in that case should be deterministic and one option is to say "if we get a second on for an already on note, we just retrigger it like we did for the first note on. if we receive a note-off for a note that is not currently on, we ignore it".
2016-09-14 07:06:55	tom-	rgareus: that should catch every case i guess
2016-09-14 07:07:04	las	rgareus: basically just playing a "chord" with the same note ... added dynamics envelope of the 2nd note superimposed on the first ... 
2016-09-14 07:07:16	las	rgareus: it is so far in the corner that it may as well be in the next galaxy

2016-09-14 07:08:47	tom-	rgareus: actually what i said could be problematic (no note-off), since it could effectively trigger a note a second time thus overlay
2016-09-14 07:12:12	tom-	so the facit remains being smart is hard. doing precisely what the loop or midi input would suggest is one other option (no smartness, hanging notes if loop set so)

2016-09-14 07:14:10	tom-	i think i depends on the sound generator if it does trigger an already on note a second time or not
2016-09-14 07:16:13	tom-	it could easily be tested. input a sends on, input b sends on, input a sends off, input b sends off (to a hardware synth). if at all times only one note is playing, it could work to retrigger on and forget about superfluous off

2016-09-14 07:49:52	nstewart__	just thinking out loud, probably stupid but:  you could create 127 linked lists of note on/offs. so at any given playhead drop / edit you could determine what was on/off at that point.

2016-09-14 15:10:09	nstewart_	ok, step back from scripting howto and into my problem space for a moment.  I'm letting Rhythm Ferret do my note detection for me. So I'm assuming I'm operating on a list of regions. Presumably on the same track.
2016-09-14 15:11:38	nstewart_	I'm not sure if I care about where they come from. so I have a list of selected regions. I don't really need the track for each region, or playlists from that track do i? I already have the regions
2016-09-14 15:14:08	nstewart_	  *   e.g. Don't allow the script to construct a "Track" Object directly  *   but do allow to create a "BBT_TIME" object
2016-09-14 15:14:31	nstewart_	hmm - but I want to, or think I do.

2016-09-14 15:37:18	nstewart_	once I have a track from the Editor::selection, how do I tell if it's audio or MIDI?
2016-09-14 15:37:54	nstewart_	rabbiteat: nursing bunnies?
2016-09-14 15:38:49	rabbiteat	affirmative 
2016-09-14 15:41:54	las	nstewart_: should be a type method
2016-09-14 15:42:09	las	nstewart_: don't plan on that being future-compatible though
2016-09-14 15:42:18	las	nstewart_: why do you need to know?
2016-09-14 15:42:35	las	nstewart_: future tracks may contains multiple types of data
2016-09-14 15:43:23	nstewart_	for right now - I saw I shouldn't create a new track directly, wasn't sure how to do differently, and decided to fall back to selecting one audio track and one midi track intended to hold the output
2016-09-14 15:44:19	nstewart_	so I was planning to kick it off with the two tracks selected, grab all the regions in the audio track, and then stick carefully calculated crap in the MIDI track.
2016-09-14 15:45:08	nstewart_	right now this is pure experimentation
2016-09-14 15:45:13	las	nstewart_: what are you actually trying to do?
2016-09-14 15:45:44	nstewart_	trying to do an offline (limited polyphonic) audio to midi script.
2016-09-14 15:46:09	nstewart_	not exactly note tracking, but should be able to bang out block chords based on 2 or 3 note guitar input.
2016-09-14 15:46:15	nstewart_	even if it misses octaves
2016-09-14 15:46:26	las	nstewart_: Track.data_type()

2016-09-15 02:43:00	falktx|work	don't know enough dbus to do it all myself, although it would still work as maintaince mode..
2016-09-15 02:43:03	falktx|work	maybe a branch
2016-09-15 02:43:33	falktx|work	now that ingen has smp, perhaps mod can change to it. and then change to jack1 too

2016-09-15 02:46:35	rgareus	be careful what you wish for :)
2016-09-15 02:47:12	rgareus	well, I'll stick with jack2 until jack1 has a proper dbus control API to switch devices on the fly anyway.

2016-09-15 04:32:00	UnixMan	Hi everybody. I've noticed a possible bug in Ardour, regarding automation of "Trim".

2016-09-15 04:35:16		[04:35]
2016-09-15 04:35:22	rgareus	UnixMan: can you be more specific?
2016-09-15 04:35:37	UnixMan	Create such an automation and try to set a point value using "edit" (directly entering a dB value via keyboard): in many cases I don't get the value I've entered, but a completely different one (usually I get the max or min possible value). Does this happen only to me? Am I doing something wrong? Tnx for your attention.
2016-09-15 04:36:34	rgareus	UnixMan: which version of Ardour is that?
2016-09-15 04:37:11	UnixMan	Verified on 4.x and 5.x up to 5.1
2016-09-15 04:37:11	rgareus	There have been some issues with coefficient vs dB in 4.x, but I thought they were fixed
2016-09-15 04:37:29	rgareus	5.1 is close enough.
2016-09-15 04:37:30	UnixMan	...not yet tryed on latest 5.3
2016-09-15 04:37:42	rgareus	there have not been changes there since 5.1
2016-09-15 04:37:47	UnixMan	But I can try it now...
2016-09-15 04:38:10	UnixMan	ok.
2016-09-15 04:38:19	UnixMan	so I guess it's still there...
2016-09-15 04:40:34	UnixMan	Yes... it is. Just tried on latest version from "kxstudio": “Ardour 5.3.4 "Music for Films" (rev 5.3-4-gb7e8d6f) Intel 64-bit”.
2016-09-15 04:40:56	rgareus	numeric entry on the fader itself (track-header) is /not wrong/ it's just gain-factor (not dB).   but right click on a node in the automation timeline -> Edit  is indeed b0rked
2016-09-15 04:41:04	UnixMan	Entered "2.0", got 14.
2016-09-15 04:41:52	UnixMan	Yes, that's what I mean :)
2016-09-15 04:42:18	rgareus	Control Point edit .. I can't make any sense of it either.
2016-09-15 04:42:24	the_CLA	Interesting. It's working fine here.
2016-09-15 04:43:25	rgareus	the_CLA: really?  right click -> edit on a node for Trim automation?
2016-09-15 04:44:23	the_CLA	Ah, trim... I confused that with "touch" enabled - only tried on the fader. 
2016-09-15 04:45:44	the_CLA	Ok, on "trim" it's broken here as well.
2016-09-15 04:47:08	the_CLA	I guess it's scaling the value on the canvas as if it was a track fader.

2016-09-15 04:49:35	the_CLA	Nope. And I guess this confusion could possibly exist with other controls as well.
2016-09-15 04:49:38	rgareus	UnixMan: would you mind filing a bug-report on tracker.ardour.org ?
2016-09-15 04:50:08	rgareus	the_CLA: maybe, but Trim and Fader automation lanes are special cased
2016-09-15 04:50:10	UnixMan	Lol, I was about to ask if I should... :D
2016-09-15 04:51:12	rgareus	UnixMan: thanks.   I won't be able to look into this right now and IRC does forget, the tracker does not.

2016-09-15 04:51:51	UnixMan	OK, I'll do that. Thank you, and keep up!
2016-09-15 04:51:52	the_CLA	rgareus: Ah, I see. I just tried with the gain of a-eq and it seems to work fine with that. So maybe indeed a problem with the special case.

2016-09-15 07:56:44	paas44	Hi all, I´m new here. I have a question about debugging ardour using gdb
2016-09-15 07:57:09	paas44	Currently I´m working on implementing support for Steinberg´s CC121 controller.
2016-09-15 07:58:13	paas44	For now I´ve basically copied the code from FaderPort and added a timer to send a heartbeat to the controller to keep it active
2016-09-15 07:59:55	paas44	This works but next I want to getting the buttons to respond. For this I would like to set a breakpoint in gdb and see when it hits my CC121::button_handler function
2016-09-15 08:01:14	paas44	When I start ardour5 with the --gdb option I can set a breakpoint in main but not in my button_handler. Once ardour runs I can not stop it anymore to set the breakpoint. Where is a good place to break?
2016-09-15 08:01:14		[08:01]
2016-09-15 08:02:21	paas44	Do you guys have any tips on debugging ardour using gdb? Also how do I enable the DEBUG_TRACE output? Thanks in advance and thanks for all your work!

2016-09-15 08:03:56	nstewart_	I usually use gdb -p `pidof ardour-5.x.y` once its running
2016-09-15 08:04:29	paas44	ok I will try that
2016-09-15 08:06:20	las	paas44: (as the author of the faderport code and a lot of ardour) ... i rarely use gdb for this stuff
2016-09-15 08:06:45	las	paas44: i find adding debug statements more efficient. DEBUG_TRACE also makes it possible to debug things in the future when they go wrong
2016-09-15 08:08:02	las	paas44: you can't set the breakpoint because the shared library containing the code is loaded on demand by the application; gdb doesn't know this is coming
2016-09-15 08:09:35	paas44	yes but when I tell it to set the breakpoint when the library is loaded it still does not hit it. What do you use for debug instead of gdb?

2016-09-15 10:07:54	tom-	the_CLA: hm.. oddly enough range selection delete on midi region works here
2016-09-15 10:07:54	the_CLA	nstewart_: Would be nice if you could put a little effort to report it when you notice such things. Parts of it are serious regressions from version 4.
2016-09-15 10:08:18	the_CLA	tom-: Recent version of A5?
2016-09-15 10:08:26	tom-	the_CLA: yes
2016-09-15 10:08:36	nstewart_	like I said - I just assumed that one was me not knowing how the rest of the world expected it to work. I'll try again when I get home and open a bug if there's not already one
2016-09-15 10:08:47	tom-	the_CLA: i range select in the mids of a midi region and hit "del"
2016-09-15 10:09:00	nstewart_	that was a few weeks ago when I noticed it - may not be the case now
2016-09-15 10:09:07	nstewart_	after the major rewrite of midi handling
2016-09-15 10:09:09	tom-	the_CLA: same outcome as doing two cuts and removing the middle part (as for how it does it here)

2016-09-15 10:09:51	tom-	the_CLA: the 3rd part looks like the first
2016-09-15 10:09:52	the_CLA	tom-: Also resizing the track height might display those "ghost notes".
2016-09-15 10:10:23	las	nstewart_: the "auto-increment" is expected
2016-09-15 10:10:23	tom-	ah.. indeed! :)
2016-09-15 10:10:27	the_CLA	nstewart_: I'm using the latest git version. So it's still present.
2016-09-15 10:10:35	tom-	the_CLA: it's quite borked. just the range select case
2016-09-15 10:10:56	the_CLA	tom-: Undoing cuts was borked here as well.

2016-09-15 10:11:30	yottanami	I just added Calf Floidsynth in Ardour as a Plugin for my MIDI line but when I click on Floidsynth in plugins it does not open calf floidsyth. How can I access the Calf Floidsynth GUI?
2016-09-15 10:11:41	tom-	the_CLA: confirmed too
2016-09-15 10:12:23	tom-	while hunting bugs, could any of you guys checkout that (weird) case here? http://trellis.ch/lowres/a3/a5_note_on_off_storms.ogv
2016-09-15 10:12:37	las	yottanami: you probably used a-fluidsynth instead
2016-09-15 10:12:58	las	yottanami: which uses the same engine as the CALF plugin, but isn't a CALF plugin and doesn't have a custom GUI
2016-09-15 10:14:14	nstewart_	the_CLA: I do try to report bugs with good info once I have an idea that I'm not just saying 'hey they thing over there doesn't do something or other like I want."
2016-09-15 10:14:22	yottanami	las: I select it from Calf Gear category and the name is "Calf Floidsynth"
2016-09-15 10:14:34	las	yottanami: no idea then
2016-09-15 10:15:41	nstewart_	bbl
2016-09-15 10:16:09	nstewart_	is x42 anyone here?
2016-09-15 10:16:38	tom-	the_CLA: "I just always wondering why there are no actual MIDI users  taking that little effort to track such things down.
2016-09-15 10:16:41	the_CLA	nstewart_: If in doubt you might discuss here first, but just don't take things that you feel are wierd for granted. ;)
2016-09-15 10:16:41	tom-	" 
2016-09-15 10:17:06	tom-	the_CLA: there is simply nobody on the dev side that could or would care to the needed degree i speculate
2016-09-15 10:17:21	tom-	but then again, midi in a daw is essential to work well
2016-09-15 10:17:24	the_CLA	tom-: So in your video midi note events are multiplied after copying the region to a different track?
2016-09-15 10:17:53	tom-	the_CLA: yes
2016-09-15 10:18:10	tom-	the_CLA: i also think part of midi weaknesses come from misunderstood usecases
2016-09-15 10:18:26	tom-	the_CLA: i'm a bit afraid that could happen with "ableton"-like trigger tracks or whatever again
2016-09-15 10:18:32	the_CLA	tom-: In regards that some of those things seem to have been broken by the tempo ramps merge I'd hope that nick_m will care a little - at least for the regressions.
2016-09-15 10:18:46	tom-	the_CLA: suddenly it will be there and bork other stuff
2016-09-15 10:20:03	tom-	the_CLA: we should take care to not blame everyting on tempo ramp / timeline changes
2016-09-15 10:20:11	nstewart_	editor action scripts - I suspect my bug reported might have something to do with running from the src-dir. Now I wonder if that should even be in the search path. Doesn't exist for installed users unless they built, 
2016-09-15 10:20:14	tom-	the_CLA: it could well be a good portion but i speculate not everything

2016-09-15 10:21:41	tom-	it's more important to hire a web dev than putting efforts to midi, that's a simplification sure
2016-09-15 10:21:59	the_CLA	tom-: Of course not, but as some of the things didn't happen in A4 it might well be the case. Git bisecting that stuff might be extremely tedious, but nick_m might be able to judge if this could have happened because of some tempo ramp changes.
2016-09-15 10:22:33	tom-	the_CLA: let's hope nick_m or someone else will have oversight and do the right things
2016-09-15 10:23:04	tom-	loop working, that's one step in a good direction

2016-09-15 10:25:45	yottanami	las: I just want to use sound fonts in Ardour should I use qsynth? because I can not find it in plugins but there is linux sampler
2016-09-15 10:26:42	las	yottanami: my point is just that at this point, CALF misbehaviour is basically a given
2016-09-15 10:26:53	las	yottanami: is this ardour from ardour.org or a distro build?

2016-09-15 10:29:04	tom-	the_CLA: it would be realtively easy to say what's missing and not, what should be changed and how, for midi, as a user. but that alone doesn't make it happen :|
2016-09-15 10:30:18	tom-	an active benevolent midi dictator is missing
2016-09-15 10:30:25	yottanami	las: I am not sure, I think I install it from my distro repo
2016-09-15 10:30:38	the_CLA	tom-: I don't talk about new/missing features, but about serious regressions from A4 - and maybe about some other serious issues.
2016-09-15 10:31:22	las	yottanami: check a demo from ardour.org ...
2016-09-15 10:31:53	tom-	the_CLA: what are regressions anyway. it's about bugs that are in current git, no matter if already in 4.0 or otherwise ;)

2016-09-15 10:40:46	rgareus	by default jack2 is asynchronous and click-free (unless you specify --sync or -S)

2016-09-15 10:43:32	tom-	could -t5000 be problematic? this is all set by qjackctl
2016-09-15 10:46:38	tom-	it's not a click, but a small period of silence, in 3 of 4 connect/disconnect cases
2016-09-15 10:49:03	tom-	hm. the same happens when starting an lv2 plugin, so not ardour related 
2016-09-15 10:52:54	tom-	rgareus: it might interest you or not, stock x42-plugins on ubuntu 16.04 can't be started with jalv and don't appear hear in ardour neither (and that's a pitty)
2016-09-15 10:54:02	tom-	it can still be some local strangeness if you don't hear that more often
2016-09-15 10:55:15	tom-	i wanted to see if the gap is in relation to a period size with sisco
2016-09-15 10:55:15		[10:55]
2016-09-15 10:57:24	rgareus	tom-: does lv2ls see them?

2016-09-15 10:58:51	tom-	rgareus: i list them before copy pasting the url to use with jalv (in a outside-ardour scenario)
2016-09-15 10:59:14	rgareus	tom-: can you pastebin how  jalv.gtk <..>    fails?
2016-09-15 10:59:24	tom-	rgareus: it doesn't fail
2016-09-15 10:59:35	rgareus	"can't be started with jalv" ?
2016-09-15 10:59:36	tom-	rgareus: the window doesn't come up
2016-09-15 10:59:50	tom-	rgareus: it's a question-mark window
2016-09-15 11:00:11	tom-	rgareus: last time i looked it was depending on the controls used in the plugins
2016-09-15 11:00:29	tom-	rgareus: i.e. midi filter: if the first param is a drop-down -> puff
2016-09-15 11:00:31	rgareus	the meters are externalUI (jalv does not support it).   x42-eq should work though
2016-09-15 11:00:33	tom-	rgareus: i think
2016-09-15 11:01:01	tom-	strange though that i don't even get sisco listed in ardour if lv2ls sees them
2016-09-15 11:01:12	rgareus	oh well. Ubuntu does not care about pro audio. news at 11.
2016-09-15 11:01:45	tom-	:)
2016-09-15 11:02:14	rgareus	knowing how often Ub broke jackd, I take it as a compliment that they finally include x42-plugins in the pro-audio things to break :)
2016-09-15 11:02:55	tom-	now you're "in the club" ;)
2016-09-15 11:03:22	tom-	ok that means doing all over again by hand. i should make a script for that one time
2016-09-15 11:03:53	tom-	i guess it will work using official newest release tarballs

2016-09-15 11:33:25	tom-	for now, good enough to know & is choice
2016-09-15 11:35:20	rgareus	in C++ prefer references over pointers  -- google to learn the difference.  but for the case at hand  pointers are not an option, anyway.
2016-09-15 11:35:54	rgareus	in lua, functions are closures.  you can't use a fn pointer as return.
2016-09-15 11:36:14	rgareus	the same is true for other functional programming langs
2016-09-15 11:37:08	tom-	rgareus: if ok=false: i can return value 0.0 safely
2016-09-15 11:37:16	tom-	?
2016-09-15 11:37:20	rgareus	yes
2016-09-15 11:37:47	rgareus	a /hack/ would be to return NaN or Infinity. -- but that's not really clean
2016-09-15 11:38:14	rgareus	if ok is false, the caller is to ignore the value
2016-09-15 11:38:35	rgareus	and  0.0 is reasonable in any case
2016-09-15 11:40:44	tom-	rgareus: before i commit -> http://pastebin.com/raw/xBdvcMbT could this work?

2016-10-01 14:33:45	tom-	rgareus: ARDOUR.LuaOSC doesn't seem to work in dsp_init
2016-10-01 14:34:10	rgareus	of course not.  dsp_init is in realtime context
2016-10-01 14:34:41	rgareus	the GUI interpreter does not call it
2016-10-01 14:35:57	tom-	there could be non-rt_init() or similar
2016-10-01 14:36:27	tom-	the thing would be to init the server there with the port number
2016-10-01 14:36:55	rgareus	you don't need a dedicated init.
2016-10-01 14:36:58	tom-	another method could be sort of "on destroy"

2016-10-01 14:37:17	rgareus	for DSP it's required because init can do non-realtime setup.
2016-10-01 14:37:30	rgareus	in the GUI check, just check if the variable is set.
2016-10-01 14:37:37	rgareus	and if not, initialize it

2016-10-01 14:38:12	rgareus	destruction must always be implicit.  (lifetime must not be managed my lua in the first place)
2016-10-01 14:38:16	tom-	init can do non-realtime setup?
2016-10-01 14:38:28	rgareus	no, it's a different interpeter
2016-10-01 14:38:42	rgareus	aah. sorry. I misunderstood the Q.
2016-10-01 14:39:03	rgareus	dsp_init () can do non-realtime work.  processing won't start before dsp_init returns
2016-10-01 14:39:17	Ricardus	new ubuntu. las and rgareus favorite!
2016-10-01 14:39:51	tom-	so that luaosc could work there
2016-10-01 14:39:59	rgareus	tom-: no.
2016-10-01 14:40:05	rgareus	tom-: you can allocate memory
2016-10-01 14:40:29	tom-	rgareus: is there another one-time called method to do non-rt things once?

2016-10-01 14:41:26	rgareus	tom-: there's   dsp_configure()  but that must be rt-safe  and it's called every time the channel-count changes
2016-10-01 14:42:32	tom-	i see
2016-10-01 14:42:54	tom-	rgareus: so checking in the gui if a variable is set
2016-10-01 14:43:21	rgareus	tom-: scripts/HiAndLowPass.lua is an example for that
2016-10-01 14:43:32	rgareus	line 48...

2016-10-01 14:46:44	tom-	l 181
2016-10-01 14:46:58	tom-	i think. good to know thanks
2016-10-01 14:47:26	tom-	rgareus: everything that happens inside render_inline (where osc can be sent) will not work in a headless environment, is that true?
2016-10-01 14:48:25	tom-	or can it be run from dsp_runmap() too? i guess not
2016-10-01 14:49:00	rgareus	correct
2016-10-01 14:49:14	rgareus	also if the inline display is hidden, it won't run
2016-10-01 14:49:29	rgareus	you should not send osc from there. really.
2016-10-01 14:49:40	tom-	yep :)
2016-10-01 14:49:45	rgareus	but whatever.
2016-10-01 14:49:56	tom-	sending osc is thus only possible if there is effectively a gui around iiuc
2016-10-01 14:52:25	rgareus	on LV2 you could use a dedicated thread to send LV2 and decouple it with a ringbuffer.
2016-10-01 14:53:21	rgareus	there are also existing LADSPA plugins to send OSC on some event (automation).  can be handy for some hacks to trigger things.
2016-10-01 14:54:22	tom-	if lv2 can, could ardour also use a ringbuffer for this .. 
2016-10-01 14:54:25	tom-	?
2016-10-01 14:54:39	rgareus	you can't launch a thread
2016-10-01 14:55:17	rgareus	anyway, the idea is not to to use scripting to  supersede plugin standards.  LV2 rocks
2016-10-01 14:57:51	tom-	now the inline gui thread sees the server variable
2016-10-01 14:58:06	tom-	so that worked :)

2016-10-02 08:47:10	gianluca_r	can't start jackd at 192k when using the m-audio audiophile 2496, steps: make sure no jackd procs are running, start it with `jackd -d alsa -d hw:2 -r 192000` then check with jack_samplerate and it's always at 44100, what am I missing?
2016-10-02 08:47:48	gianluca_r	hw:2 is the m-audio card as I read it from alsamixer
2016-10-02 08:51:26	c3r1c3_Win	gianluca_r: I thought that the maudio was called the 2496 because it could do UPTO 24-bit audio at 96Khz?
2016-10-02 08:51:59	gianluca_r	c3r1c3_Win: me too, so should that explain?
2016-10-02 08:53:01	c3r1c3_Win	That would pretty much explain your issue. Don't try to run hardware at stuff it's not designed to.

2016-10-02 10:49:02	avlinux	rgareus, No I don't have a key for it, but I guess it does demo-mode now right?
2016-10-02 10:49:31	rgareus	yeah.. 30 sec even (every time you re-open it)
2016-10-02 10:49:44	rgareus	or 20 sec. I forget.
2016-10-02 10:50:04	rgareus	and worst-case: the generic UI.. forever.
2016-10-02 10:50:24	avlinux	rgareus, lol that's about the length of time to find that actual parameter you want to adjust... then it goes away
2016-10-02 10:51:06	rgareus	depends if you 'know' the plugin
2016-10-02 10:51:15	avlinux	rgareus, Yes true :)
2016-10-02 10:51:24	rgareus	it's basically 2 EQs  one for the onset.  and one for the tail.
2016-10-02 10:51:35	rgareus	works very well on snares.
2016-10-02 10:51:44	avlinux	rgareus, your work?
2016-10-02 10:51:55	rgareus	harrison's work.
2016-10-02 10:52:08	rgareus	I was involved in parts
2016-10-02 10:53:14	avlinux	rgareus, I'll have to give it a try I guess, I keep forgetting the demos are in Ardour now
2016-10-02 10:54:57	avlinux	rgareus, Here's the mix, there is only EQ on the kick and snare, no Reverbs at all. The bass has a-Compressor only on it: http://bandshed.net/music/RB_EP_Next/StraightUp-RC2_session.mp3
2016-10-02 10:54:57		[10:54]
2016-10-02 10:56:47	avlinux	rgareus, NOT a final mix.. :) All reverb is room + an ambient stairwell mic
2016-10-02 10:58:12	rgareus	avlinux: sorry, can't listen at the moment.. (watching a movie) but I'll do that later
2016-10-02 10:58:48	avlinux	rgreaus, lol well I'll stop jabbering then! Enjoy the movie!

2016-10-03 02:23:42	NoCode	I'm using Cadence.
2016-10-03 02:25:50	the_CLA_2	NoCode: Not familiar with that. For jack you have to select a Midi driver, so that Midi interfaces show up as Jack-Midi connections.
2016-10-03 02:26:22	the_CLA_2	So check if there is some Midi-Driver setting available in Cadence.
2016-10-03 02:27:29	NoCode	I think that might be it! I just looked into my JACK settings and it suggests "Midi Driver: None". "ALSA sequences", and "ALSA RAW-MIDI" are the options

2016-10-03 02:30:18	the_CLA_2	Not sure right now wich driver is better - both should work though. And there is also the 3rd option of using ajmidid instead of that driver in Jack. IIRC it also depends on the jack version wich is best. rgareus might know better.

2016-10-03 03:19:35	rgareus	son0p: since Vamp is a plugin-API, it can't make any guarantees on what the plugin DSP does.
2016-10-03 03:20:29	rgareus	the vamp API itself allows for  "live" chunked processing.
