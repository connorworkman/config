2016-09-09 00:09:05	demize	oh right, forgot to re-start my gale-tmux session after rebooting theos.
2016-09-09 00:09:21	Tear	a 500GB hdd is enough to house almost all music libraries anyone could have in flac, and a 32/64GB sd card is enough to house those libraries in a lossy format
2016-09-09 00:09:25	Kirito	I have a 256GB SD card in my phone

2016-09-09 00:11:07	demize	Hmm, I only have 12G of music on my media laptop's storage disk, though I never actually play that though, just use spotify the rare times I actually play music.
2016-09-09 00:11:10	grawity	(multiple RAID disks began dying)
2016-09-09 00:11:31	Tear	i can understand not really caring about that if music isn't a big part of your life
2016-09-09 00:11:38	demize	Mmmm, somehow I have a felling that they were all rather ancient disks.
2016-09-09 00:11:56	Tear	i guess that's the kind of person streaming services are targetting

2016-09-09 06:16:06	L0g4nAd4ms	is it just my own impression or is the configuration for systemd boot muuuuch easier than the grub config ?
2016-09-09 06:16:39	MK_FG	Depends on whether you use grub.cfg or something generating it
2016-09-09 06:16:55	MK_FG	grub.cfg is dead-simple, all the stuff on top is hard
2016-09-09 06:18:12	L0g4nAd4ms	BTW, about LUKS. If i understand it right its a kinda interface for filesystems to support encryption right ?
2016-09-09 06:18:46	L0g4nAd4ms	So the whole "encryption thing" is not natively done in the FS but handeled by LUKS ?
2016-09-09 06:19:17	MemesOfMagic	afaik, it's a filesystem container, with the right key it'll let you inside
2016-09-09 06:19:27	MK_FG	Something like a standard for how to store crypto keys, I think
2016-09-09 06:19:43	MK_FG	As in "here's the LUKS header format, here's how to generate it"

2016-09-09 06:20:16	MK_FG	"not natively done in the FS" - true, LUKS is used by dm-crypt to create extra block device layer
2016-09-09 06:20:37	MK_FG	But some FS'es support encryption, zfs I think and f2fs
2016-09-09 06:21:01	MK_FG	Probably don't use LUKS to store keys though
2016-09-09 06:21:04	L0g4nAd4ms	yeah it would be really good if btrfs supports encryption

2016-09-09 06:22:05	MK_FG	Idk, dm-crypt seem to work
2016-09-09 06:22:17	MK_FG	Though yeah, actually, it'd allow authenticated encryption
2016-09-09 06:22:26	MK_FG	Not just some AES-CBC crap
2016-09-09 06:23:44	L0g4nAd4ms	and ZFS on linux is pain in the ass to set up
2016-09-09 06:23:52	MK_FG	But then again, if someone can tamper with hw to mess with malleable crypto, nothing will save your data anyway ;)

2016-09-09 06:32:21	L0g4nAd4ms	think i read some time ago in the linux subreddit in a post that was about that AMD is not going to open up its microcode for devices; some guy said that in theory there could be backdoors included, so if the gpu has shared memory with the cpu it can monitor whats going on without the knowledge of the cpu 
2016-09-09 06:32:49	SolidSaltySwan	yeah, amd is no better than intel
2016-09-09 06:33:02	MK_FG	Oh, right, even ext4 supports fs encryption these days

2016-09-09 06:34:20	SolidSaltySwan	no, I don't think these backdoors are being used very often, if at all

2016-09-09 13:04:08	Max-P	libvirt is really neat on paper but in practice it really is more trouble than it's worth
2016-09-09 13:04:30	mankypirate	http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Management_Tools apparently everything uses it
2016-09-09 13:04:32	phrik	Title: Management Tools - KVM (at www.linux-kvm.org)
2016-09-09 13:04:38	mankypirate	so in essence kvm sucks then
2016-09-09 13:05:42	Max-P	KVM is great, as I said if you just start a VM in qemu it pretty much just works, and quite reliably
2016-09-09 13:06:24	Max-P	It's just libvirt, a wrapper over every emulation platform, that suffers a lot because it tries to abstract away everything
2016-09-09 13:07:04	Max-P	For my qemu machines I just throw a run.sh script in a folder along with my disk image(s) and it just runs.
2016-09-09 13:08:16	Max-P	In libvirt you have to define a storage pool just so you can load your ISO from it or create a hard drive, then you also have to configure a virtual network to be able to connect machines to it. Pretty much had to uninstall NetworkManager on my laptop so it wouldn't conflict with libvirt's own network manager
2016-09-09 13:09:04	Max-P	then everything is hidden behind needlessly confused name, such as "destroy" to poweroff a VM (no, it doesn't delete anything, it just powers it off)
2016-09-09 13:10:04	Max-P	it's a gigantic clusterfuck of everyone adding whatever part they felt like they needed and none of them actually works properly
2016-09-09 13:13:08	Max-P	And don't even dare updating your box once libvirt is working, your VMs will start failing for retarded nonsense reasons such as libvirt insisting on adding virtual hardware you didn't ask for and then complaining that said hardware is not available for the container you are configuring

2016-09-09 20:27:41	LambdaComplex	like...it's just so unreadable

2016-09-09 20:28:44	minimalism	there's a USE flag mishap somewhere
2016-09-09 20:28:50	LambdaComplex	quite possibly
2016-09-09 20:28:57	LambdaComplex	i figured using genkernel would avoid that though

2016-09-09 20:29:13	minimalism	I did manual config, but I'm pretty sure the issue is USE

2016-09-09 20:29:40	LambdaComplex	nope, desktop
2016-09-09 20:29:42	LambdaComplex	wired interface
2016-09-09 20:29:55	minimalism	Oh, well it's just symlinking the interface provided to net.lo
2016-09-09 20:30:00	minimalism	installing dhcpcd etc.
2016-09-09 20:30:03	minimalism	running the service
2016-09-09 20:30:34	minimalism	maybe also install openresolv for good measure
2016-09-09 20:30:41	Max-P	If you don't even see the interface, you'll have to build a kernel that supports it
2016-09-09 20:30:48	LambdaComplex	^this
2016-09-09 20:30:56	LambdaComplex	''ip a'' doesn't even show the interface

2016-09-10 00:19:43	andrewSC	consumerism is dumb
2016-09-10 00:20:23	MK_FG	Dunno if it's consumerism if you can't and don't really intend to buy them
2016-09-10 00:21:03	MK_FG	Just good to know that there's something that covers stuff that previously there was nothing for
2016-09-10 00:21:18	MK_FG	Though that rarely applies to anything apple does ;)

2016-09-10 00:30:37	BL4DE	I hate it when people offer me to listen to their music by handing my their waxy earphone
2016-09-10 00:33:36	minimalism	BL4DE: You listen to that sketchy 128mbps mp3 with gross bad headphones and you like it.
2016-09-10 00:33:36		[00:33]
2016-09-10 00:37:36	MK_FG	Why aren't we all using ogg yet?
2016-09-10 00:37:46	MK_FG	Or vorbis, rather
2016-09-10 00:38:45	mar77i	uh
2016-09-10 00:38:46	BL4DE	minimalism: I use these. https://www.amazon.co.uk/V-Moda-Crossfade-Over-Ear-Noise-Isolating-Headphones-Black/dp/B00A39PPDK Very comfy and sounds great. They are 32Ω so everything can drive them. They also don't look stupid to wear in public and very well built with metal frame etc.
2016-09-10 00:39:45	minimalism	MK_FG: We're using them. We're just using them for the web since it creates a great sound with low file size. FLAC is still king for local files.
2016-09-10 00:40:50	MK_FG	Most things I tend to see are still mp3, and I think it's aac in movies/youtubes and such?
2016-09-10 00:40:55	BL4DE	And audio jacks for both sides. So interchangeable cables. You could even mix with them if you wanted
2016-09-10 00:41:30	minimalism	MK_FG: I think a lot of x265 encodes are using vorbis
2016-09-10 00:42:07	MK_FG	Hm, guess it's coming then, haven't seen many h265s, maybe 2017 will be the year of vorbis
2016-09-10 00:42:22	minimalism	I think each codec has its place.. except mp3
2016-09-10 00:42:25	minimalism	mp3 can fuck off completely
2016-09-10 00:42:33	MK_FG	I like opus
2016-09-10 00:42:52	MK_FG	Low-latency, zero-config, freakin fast
2016-09-10 00:43:25	minimalism	I'd be fine with hearing anything right now. Can't get ALSA working on gentoo.
2016-09-10 00:43:43	BL4DE	Space is cheap these days? What about flac?

2016-09-10 00:47:47	MK_FG	Suspect it'd probably require at least proper headphones and decent audio setup in general
2016-09-10 00:48:13	MK_FG	As in, PSU or audio hw that doesn't produce buzzsaw sounds when nothing plays ;)

2016-09-10 04:27:18	alyptik	Phryq: anything is as secure as you are
2016-09-10 04:27:18	SolidSaltySwan	Phryq: if you want a "secure" OS you first need to decide what exactly you're trying to secure it from. 
2016-09-10 04:27:21	alyptik	no pun intended
2016-09-10 04:27:27	Tom^	you might aswell ask a car dealer if this car is reliable

2016-09-10 04:57:13	Phryq	and for example, suppose I want to run a Windows 10 VM. It really makes no difference which distro is used as host? E.G. Fedora, even though it develops the KVM software, doesn't really have anything Arch or Ubuntu doesn't have for that?
2016-09-10 04:57:32	Tom^	Phryq: nope
2016-09-10 04:57:51	jelle	Phryq: I'd suggest moar research ;-)
2016-09-10 04:58:01	Tom^	and even if they applied custom patches its still a simple pkgbuild and makepkg away.
2016-09-10 04:58:08	Phryq	I've been researching for months literally, and can't get straight answers
2016-09-10 04:58:15	Tom^	i just gave you one.
2016-09-10 04:58:35	jelle	KVM is developped by RedHat which develops it as an opensource product
2016-09-10 04:58:38	jelle	meh
2016-09-10 04:58:41	jelle	KVM is developed by more peole
2016-09-10 04:58:44	jelle	*people
2016-09-10 04:58:58	Phryq	So in that case I should run Fedora
2016-09-10 04:59:03	jelle	what
2016-09-10 04:59:10	Phryq	Fedora is just Red Hat
2016-09-10 04:59:16	jelle	no it's not
2016-09-10 04:59:20	mankypirate	just use manjaro bro
2016-09-10 05:00:06	Phryq	well, what I mean is that Fedora should have the same functionality for running VMs that Red Hat does, minus the paid support

2016-09-10 05:00:36	SolidSaltySwan	almost every single distro has qemu in the official repos anyway
2016-09-10 05:00:49	jelle	it so happens that RedHat makes it devs also work on fedora
2016-09-10 05:01:02	nshp	what is "the KVM software"? the linux kernel?
2016-09-10 05:01:50	onetwo_	Tom^: nah m8, like a phoenix from the ashes
2016-09-10 05:02:01	SysGhost	KVM=Kernel-based Virtual Machine
2016-09-10 05:02:04	Phryq	Fedora is supposed to be the testing grounds for RHEL, so functionality will be in fedora first
2016-09-10 05:02:38	jelle	Phryq: doesn't mean that arch can incorporate the same technology..
2016-09-10 05:02:45	nshp	SysGhost: I know, but it's a mainline set of kernel modules
2016-09-10 05:02:47	Phryq	I shouldn't get any KVM functionality in RHEL that wouldn't be in Fedora
2016-09-10 05:02:55	nshp	sounded like it was being described as an application
2016-09-10 05:03:12	SysGhost	nshp: http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page

2016-09-10 05:03:25	Phryq	right, so that was my question; each OS will run KVM differently, and give different functionality. So if I'm going for that Fedora would actually be better
2016-09-10 05:03:26	nshp	y u link this
2016-09-10 05:03:30	SysGhost	In short. A bunch of modules
2016-09-10 05:03:39	jelle	you can even use KVM without qemu
2016-09-10 05:03:41	nshp	I am not confused what it is, I am confused by you people :P

2016-09-10 05:04:04	jelle	niceee
2016-09-10 05:04:06	Phryq	or is it possible that Arch would have some KVM functionality not in Fedora, simply because Arch is more bleeding edge?
2016-09-10 05:04:19	SysGhost	nshp: I'm confused by your questions. ;)
2016-09-10 05:04:22	jelle	fedora is almost as bleeding edge Phryq 
2016-09-10 05:04:34	nshp	Phryq: KVM is entirely in the Linux kernel
2016-09-10 05:04:43	nshp	they all run the linux kernel, there's no difference

2016-09-10 05:05:05	Phryq	nshp; does KVM being in the kernel mean it will run the same way regardless of the distro?
2016-09-10 05:05:14	nshp	yes
2016-09-10 05:05:18	nshp	there is only one
2016-09-10 05:05:22	Phryq	because I'd rather *not* run Fedora, but will if it'll possible do KVM better
2016-09-10 05:05:36	jelle	KVM won't matter much
2016-09-10 05:06:04	SysGhost	when it comes to kvm, no distro does it "better" than the other.
2016-09-10 05:06:24	Phryq	so if my USB doesn't pass through in Ubuntu, it won't pass through in Fedora
2016-09-10 05:06:24		[05:06]
2016-09-10 05:06:30	grawity	that depends
2016-09-10 05:06:39	Phryq	what's it depend on?
2016-09-10 05:06:42	grawity	kvm being in-kernel means it depends on the kernel version the distro offers
2016-09-10 05:06:55	Phryq	so in that case a newer kernel is better
2016-09-10 05:07:04	nshp	usually
2016-09-10 05:07:05	Phryq	and I should go with Arch
2016-09-10 05:07:37	SolidSaltySwan	man, you're all over the place
2016-09-10 05:07:56	SysGhost	If you're the kind that thinks "it's better done if one does it by oneself." then yes.
2016-09-10 05:08:34	nshp	Phryq: I think the real answer is you should TIAS, because making up imaginary problems isn't going to help anything
2016-09-10 05:09:11	Tom^	nshp: thats based on the assumption you are actually in a real world.
2016-09-10 05:09:13	Phryq	I just want it to work. Once I know if works, I'll play around and do a proper Arch install, but at first I would just do an Arch-anywhere or Manjaro or some other blasphemy because I just want KVM to work
2016-09-10 05:09:16	nshp	:O

2016-09-10 06:53:59	polyzen	lib32-freetype2 is required by lib32-harfbuzz which requires lib32-freetype2.. and apparently nothing else on my system require them
2016-09-10 06:54:08	demize	Though after a bit of that you might want to consider trying something like gsn out, which lets you run actual cisco routers/switches.
2016-09-10 06:54:27	deltasquared	polyzen: wow, which distro is this that has a circular dependency? :/
2016-09-10 06:54:32	grawity	deltasquared: Arch.
2016-09-10 06:54:33	polyzen	oh

2016-09-10 06:54:49	deltasquared	how did I not guess
2016-09-10 06:54:53	grawity	polyzen: I think pacman-git got a fix to properly clean up circular deps

2016-09-10 06:55:04	omp	hi
2016-09-10 06:55:04	deltasquared	shouldn't that be a bug or something though?
2016-09-10 06:55:08	polyzen	grawity, nice
2016-09-10 06:55:17	deltasquared	I wonder what the reason for the circular dep is in the first place
2016-09-10 06:55:22	grawity	deltasquared: they both do in fact require each other
2016-09-10 06:55:24	grawity	misdesign I guess
2016-09-10 06:55:25	deltasquared	hmm.
2016-09-10 06:55:43	deltasquared	if they need each other, why not just merge the packages?
2016-09-10 06:55:57	deltasquared	then again it'd break existing packages
2016-09-10 06:55:58	grawity	because they do different things and are maintained by different people
2016-09-10 06:56:11	grawity	they have separate releases and so on

2016-09-10 07:02:41	deltasquared	well, you could always hunt for an SSH binary for use with the terminal emulator
2016-09-10 07:03:32	deltasquared	lucky me, CyanogenMod came with an SSH binary

2016-09-10 07:06:56	MK_FG	Usual way is to add them all to ssh-agent, I think
2016-09-10 07:06:57	choki	i would know of
2016-09-10 07:07:04	i3_Arch	just give me your priv key and pass plox
2016-09-10 07:07:05	du5tball	you'd need to exchange the key everywhere then
2016-09-10 07:07:15	MK_FG	But you can do "ssh -i ~/.ssh/mykey ..." too
2016-09-10 07:07:19	deltasquared	there are several layers of nope here someway...

2016-09-10 07:07:35	du5tball	choki: best practice is one key per machine, with different passwds

2016-09-10 07:08:28	MK_FG	Ah, yeah, makes more sense that way
2016-09-10 07:08:31	deltasquared	choki I guess in security it's easier (too easy?) to think there is an objective idea of "best"
2016-09-10 07:08:42	choki	there is no best

2016-09-10 07:09:23	deltasquared	it's too easy to slip into the "I'm objectively right" mindset
2016-09-10 07:09:30	deltasquared	and I acknowledge this flaw
2016-09-10 07:09:31	du5tball	choki: say you have the same key everywhere and you lose your laptop, you need to change your key everywhere immediately. if it was only one key you lost, you'd just need to exchange / disable the compromised pubkey

2016-09-10 11:39:45	du5tball	fer750: well by default, the swappiness is 60. it means the system swaps when you reach 40% of your ram. ten is useful for a desktop machine. 0 and 1 are REALLY aggressive for non-swapping. though i can't tell from the top of my head

2016-09-10 19:36:04	phillid	I should dig out my old bot

2016-09-10 19:36:35	phillid	Just did page titles and some simple commands
2016-09-10 19:36:40	phillid	Or, link titles
2016-09-10 19:36:41	mnrmnaugh	one day i will make an awkbot

2016-09-10 20:07:40	Kirito	I've considered setting up something like that actually

2016-09-10 20:08:14	Kirito	and so on.
2016-09-10 20:08:30	polyzen	that works too
2016-09-10 20:08:46	Kirito	unfortunately wildcard aliases make you very spam prone
2016-09-10 20:08:50	Kirito	so your idea is actually better

2016-09-10 20:10:47	Kirito	e.g. scanning attachments. Any time someone sends an e-mail with a malicious attachment, the server will block them, look up the sending host, and send an automated abuse report to the ISP

2016-09-11 01:53:30	du5tball	though... comparing to one or two years ago, it's not really much
2016-09-11 01:53:35	du5tball	Tom^: thanks
2016-09-11 01:53:42	Tom^	du5tball: so yea in games? doesnt matter. :p
2016-09-11 01:54:00	du5tball	Tom^: what does the ram clocking then matter for?
2016-09-11 01:54:06	Tom^	no idea
2016-09-11 01:54:12	du5tball	ah
2016-09-11 01:54:23	Tom^	tmpfs makepkg?
2016-09-11 01:54:24	Tom^	=D
2016-09-11 01:54:44	MrElendig	depends on what you are doung
2016-09-11 01:54:45	MrElendig	doing*
2016-09-11 01:54:59	MrElendig	faster ddr4 makes a noticable difference on igp performance
2016-09-11 01:55:15	Tom^	that is true, since IGP uses ram as vram it might matter
2016-09-11 01:55:16	MrElendig	and for laptops the lower power usage obviously helps
2016-09-11 01:55:30	MrElendig	some heavy calculations can be significantly faster too
2016-09-11 01:55:55	du5tball	this has an additional nvidia card as well
2016-09-11 01:55:58	du5tball	so meh
2016-09-11 01:56:10	Tom^	du5tball: so yea, wont matter much in games. you might see benefits elsewhere tho
2016-09-11 01:56:14	Tom^	but where i dont know
2016-09-11 01:56:14		[01:56]
2016-09-11 01:56:16	MrElendig	ofcourse if you do ddr3-2133 vs ddr4-2133 there won't be much difference
2016-09-11 01:57:08	MrElendig	one of the advantages of ddr4 that makes a real difference is the larger capasity though

2016-09-11 04:25:20	ekkelett	Depends on the sort. In terms of Internet I just know that Norway would end up on the last place due to how crappy it is in remote places.

2016-09-11 06:02:51	ekkelett	choki: there's regexes to validate an email, but all you can validate is that it has valid form.

2016-09-11 06:12:57	MK_FG	Like don't allow doing some stuff until you validate mail, so you do it eventually
2016-09-11 06:13:32	demize	Unless they actually require the email address for something, they should go to hell.

2016-09-11 06:15:08	mankypirate	and there's one other thing to consider which I hadn't thought of before
2016-09-11 06:15:29	mankypirate	you need to do some normalization to the email address if you use it as the account identifier
2016-09-11 06:15:36	demize	Why?
2016-09-11 06:15:59	mankypirate	google actually ignores dots so first.last and firstlast are the same account
2016-09-11 06:15:59		[06:15]
2016-09-11 06:16:11	mankypirate	you can create duplicate accounts
2016-09-11 06:16:20	mankypirate	etc. etc.
2016-09-11 06:16:25	demize	And you can create duplicate accounts with other email addresses as well.
2016-09-11 06:16:56	demize	Just because GMail ignores dots doesn't mean that it's reasonable to just randomly remove dots from the given email.

2016-09-11 15:02:03	BL4DE	anyways was thinking about the gpu passthrough thingy. 2 high end GPUs seem expensive, wonder what desktop resolution can intel graphics drive?
2016-09-11 15:02:09	nshp	oh, P is power in watts
2016-09-11 15:02:09	tigrmesh	100C is the temp that water boils
2016-09-11 15:02:18	alyptik	BL4DE: mine run 2160x1440 fine
2016-09-11 15:02:26	nshp	so max tcase is 92
2016-09-11 15:02:27	tigrmesh	that's where my laptops shut down
2016-09-11 15:02:50	alyptik	i dunno why alienware made laptops that run that hot
2016-09-11 15:02:55	alyptik	everything was stock; no OC
2016-09-11 15:03:19	nshp	my alienware laptop idles around 40C, never gets anywhere near that hot
2016-09-11 15:03:32	nshp	the temperature actually goes down under load
2016-09-11 15:03:41	BL4DE	gtx285 runs at 90c on some games. use to run at 102C for a year till I cleaned it
2016-09-11 15:04:03	BL4DE	105 is max :P
2016-09-11 15:04:30	nshp	it was probably underclocking to stay below that too :P
2016-09-11 15:04:51	BL4DE	im surprised this pc is still alive. 7 year old HDD, chieftiec 700w psu
2016-09-11 15:05:01	alyptik	i turned my alienware into a server
2016-09-11 15:05:06	alyptik	it's cpu has retired
2016-09-11 15:05:08	nshp	7 years on an HDD is impressive
2016-09-11 15:05:11	alyptik	its*
2016-09-11 15:06:00	BL4DE	nshp: the best thing is that PC was on 24/7 most of the times. except for rare ocasions when I went on holidays away from home for a few weeks
2016-09-11 15:06:13	nshp	my laptops used to chew through roughly one HDD per year until I started putting SDDs in them
2016-09-11 15:06:34	alyptik	lol
2016-09-11 15:06:44	alyptik	pretty sure m11xrs is an hdd; still going strong
2016-09-11 15:07:25	nshp	I put a 1TB 850 evo in my m14x
2016-09-11 15:07:31	BL4DE	I leave it running mostly to seed torrents cause private tracker heh
2016-09-11 15:07:56	nshp	I treat it like a workstation with a builtin UPS, it just lives at my desk most of the time
2016-09-11 15:08:29	alyptik	laptop is just a small desktop with the best UPS
2016-09-11 15:09:36	nshp	I'd like a chromebook for actually using like a laptop, but not sure I have that much use for it right now
2016-09-11 15:10:26	vevais	Does Arch work fine on them?
2016-09-11 15:10:48	alyptik	vevais: yup, arch with postfix/dovecot/apache works beautiful
2016-09-11 15:10:54	nshp	either arch or alarm should be fine on most of them

2016-09-11 19:46:28	grawity	alyptik: you get 100% when you throw away a bunch of parsing code and replace it with one memcpy call, that's how
2016-09-11 19:46:45	alyptik	what is the memcpy significance though?
2016-09-11 19:46:52	e5_229	"hello today we are going to write 120% of the code" 
2016-09-11 19:47:09	mar77i	grawity: that whole "some of these things need to run for years on the same battery"... uh, what the fuck should that be? mars rovers?
2016-09-11 19:47:24	grawity	alyptik: none, other than calling memcpy is like 2-3 instructions and parsing ASN.1 certificates is in the thousands

2016-09-12 10:58:32	polyzen	o ok The pfSense project is a free network firewall distribution, based on the FreeBSD operating system with a custom kernel and including third party free software packages for additional functionality.
2016-09-12 10:58:57	dunz0r	polyzen: Pfsense can handle ~10 clients if you don't have too complex rule-chains.
2016-09-12 10:59:19	dunz0r	I used to have an old P4 running Pfsense, it couldn't handle a lot of traffic because my rules were too complex :(
2016-09-12 10:59:26	mnrmnaugh	i would think theyd work like that, but. ehm i dunno. i fail to see your point. i meant like, if the manufacturer added some fanciness and firmware. yer still SOL
2016-09-12 10:59:34	dagle	dunz0r: A lot of firewalls doesn't allow full sets of rules to be ran on hardware. Pretty sure the fortigate 60B doesn't either.
2016-09-12 10:59:50	dunz0r	dagle: Not a full set, but quite a lot of rules are ASIC-implemented.

2016-09-12 11:00:28	dunz0r	I'm just making qualified guesses though. So don't take my word for it.
2016-09-12 11:01:11	dunz0r	I'm quite certain that the firewalls at work wouldn't be able to have the throughput they have with the amount of sessions/clients/rules if there weren't any ASICs in them.
2016-09-12 11:01:13	dagle	A $150 router can do asic routing these days.
2016-09-12 11:01:24	dunz0r	We're talking like ~500 000 sessions and thousands of rules
2016-09-12 11:03:38	dagle	Also, you limit yourself a lot with ASIC.

2016-09-13 00:58:13	phillid	choki, if you use the keyboard to move to some window, the mouse pointer will locate on that window
2016-09-13 00:58:19	phillid	So you don't have to move it as far
2016-09-13 00:58:25	dunz0r	phillid: I don't use it a lot, but without mousewarping I have to use it quite a lot
2016-09-13 00:58:25	choki	phillid: lol :D
2016-09-13 00:58:33	phillid	And so it doesn't lose focus when you go to use the mouse

2016-09-13 13:02:42	BKC	Max-P: fucking unusable...
2016-09-13 13:03:48	Max-P	Yeah. Applicable to pretty much all remote filesystems. Ended up mounting an ext4 disk image over NFS for my backups because it's orders of magnitude faster than rsync'ing directly to the NFS share my host provides
2016-09-13 13:05:10	BKC	tar cf - local_dir | ssh remote "tar -C remote_dir -xf -" :D
2016-09-13 13:05:22	BKC	soooo much faster than rsync ^.^
2016-09-13 13:06:36	Max-P	well that depends, I use rsync because I actually need to synchronize a folder and I don't want to retransfer GBs of untouched data
2016-09-13 13:06:57	Max-P	And I don't have SSH access to that backup server, otherwise I would have just used native rsync on both ends :P
2016-09-13 13:10:24	Max-P	The big killer is listing all directories and then stat()'ing all the files in them. That's why rsync over SSH spawns a daemon on the other end: so both sides can scan the directories on their own and then just share the list, diff it and then push all files at once

2016-09-13 17:58:26	Justice	but what scares me is that the hackers/hacker had access to PHP folder on C:\ and Apache2 and even created aspx files in sub folders where the IIS server runs its websites.

2016-09-14 01:28:35	MK_FG	alyptik, With any kind of inductive load (coils, motors, etc), you have to have a bunch of additional circuitry to drain voltage, e.g. flyback diodes
2016-09-14 01:29:00	phillid	There will still be a large current kick when the motor starts
2016-09-14 01:29:09	MK_FG	Because when you cut the power from the thing, EM induces voltage spike there, which will fry unprotected usb ports

2016-09-14 05:01:53	MemesOfMagic	tigrmesh: "from"... I think the consensus is that they were phrases in use before, but shakespeare was the first time they were written in a work
2016-09-14 05:02:30	tigrmesh	we wouldn't be quoting them if they hadn't been written down.  
2016-09-14 05:02:38	MemesOfMagic	they get passed down

2016-09-14 13:02:18	phillid	Does it actually make the #define "local" to the scope of the struct?

2016-09-15 03:50:20	ZnarqXrant	just plain ethernet and ip with a real mtu. maybe even jumbo frames
2016-09-15 03:55:57	ZnarqXrant	anyways, i started with crappy euro-isdn at 64Kb/s with optional channel bundling to 128Kb/s. so from that point in time compared to now i'm already living in cyberspace :)

2016-09-15 05:04:25	dunz0r	skope: I've most certainly payed for mine :)
2016-09-15 05:04:28	andrewSC	basic income or w/e the buzz word of today is, isn't meant to put you up in a penthouse downtown
2016-09-15 05:04:30	dunz0r	IT-salary and all that
2016-09-15 05:04:33	ZnarqXrant	what are "proper merits"? in germany we have a wording called "Papiertiger", which means someone is a real tiger, as long as he can wave with his papers/credentials/whatnot. and mostly it is just bullshit bingo 
2016-09-15 05:04:37	andrewSC	it's supposed to get you fed and housed
2016-09-15 05:04:53	skope	andrewSC: yeah?
2016-09-15 05:04:54	chee	dunz0r: is mental illness a good reason to be longterm unemployed

2016-09-15 05:05:53	dunz0r	ZnarqXrant: There's a difference between having a bunch of merits and being unemployed for several years.

2016-09-15 05:08:33	chee	what if the person has been mentally ill and that's why they were unemployed, but they don't want to say so in the interview because there is a stigma
2016-09-15 05:08:55	dunz0r	chee: Then the person needs to get over the stigma :}
2016-09-15 05:08:56	voidead	then the government takes care of them

2016-09-15 05:11:48	MrElendig	like one woman in norway that had applied for over 100 jobs, usually didn't even get a interview
2016-09-15 05:11:58	MrElendig	changed name, got a job pretty much instantly
2016-09-15 05:12:16	MK_FG	And then they laugh at chinese social credit system
2016-09-15 05:12:23	MrElendig	just because she had a "immigrant" name, even though she was a second generation norwegian
2016-09-15 05:12:27	dandels_	If you don't hire people for being depressed, you're creating a negative feedback loop where depression profilerates
2016-09-15 05:12:37	ZnarqXrant	all these ramblings lead to nothing. because they are rooted in protestantic work ethics, which is all about jobs, which just doesn't apply anymore in an industrialized society, and this will become even more troubling the more time goes by.
2016-09-15 05:12:40	skope	dandels_: hahah
2016-09-15 05:12:45	ZnarqXrant	get that in you heads!
2016-09-15 05:12:48	ZnarqXrant	damn it!
2016-09-15 05:12:54	dandels_	a lot of people would get at least partially better just by having a job in the first place
2016-09-15 05:12:56	skope	yeah, soon we don't have to work
2016-09-15 05:13:22	ZnarqXrant	btw. there is basic income

2016-09-15 05:13:35	skope	where?
2016-09-15 05:13:38	ZnarqXrant	for rich ppl who inherited the money
2016-09-15 05:13:38	dunz0r	skope: When I've built my robot army, no one will have to work
2016-09-15 05:13:45	dandels_	ZnarqXrant, that's not "basic income"
2016-09-15 05:13:45	skope	dunz0r: please hurry
2016-09-15 05:13:48	ZnarqXrant	and anything too big too fail

2016-09-15 05:14:10	MK_FG	dandels_, Might also push depressed people to actually get better and seek help for their condition, instead of being useless all day
2016-09-15 05:14:14	dunz0r	Maybe more... need to count
2016-09-15 05:14:24	MK_FG	If not, what's the point of even having them around
2016-09-15 05:14:29	ZnarqXrant	dandels_: of course it is. they get more money for already having money, while the poor rest gets less and less :)
2016-09-15 05:14:33	dandels_	MK_FG, ever been to a mental health professional?
2016-09-15 05:14:57	MK_FG	Once, I think
2016-09-15 05:15:06	MK_FG	They're so useless
2016-09-15 05:15:16	skope	MrElendig: useless?
2016-09-15 05:15:20	skope	sorry MK_FG*
2016-09-15 05:15:54	MrElendig	MK_FG: fyi well over 70% of us will have a depression at some point in our lifes
2016-09-15 05:16:00	MrElendig	and that is a conservative estimate
2016-09-15 05:16:15	MK_FG	Yeah, I think they're there just to scam people
2016-09-15 05:16:15	MrElendig	but then again that just means that pretty much all humans are useless, which is correct
2016-09-15 05:16:16	MrElendig	:D
2016-09-15 05:16:22	skope	i've had semi-hard depression, therapist helped
2016-09-15 05:16:28	MK_FG	(mental health "pros")
2016-09-15 05:16:35	MrElendig	MK_FG: they are not
2016-09-15 05:16:44	skope	MK_FG: you got any mental health issues?
2016-09-15 05:16:45	MK_FG	Then so is homeopathy
2016-09-15 05:16:46	dandels_	MK_FG, They're useless is my point. You'll spend a bunch of time and effort that you could spend on *actually improving* instead of trying a bunch of therapeuts for what's probably years, after which you get given medication that either doesn't work and half the time fucks you up more.
2016-09-15 05:16:49	MrElendig	atleast not in norway, since they can't really scam anyone

2016-09-15 05:20:54	skope	and depression is depressed peoples own fault

2016-09-15 10:33:42	koffeekbd	oh hm maybe <C-(c-v,c-[)[C>
2016-09-15 10:33:44	koffeekbd	lol
2016-09-15 10:33:46	fer750	and figure how your terminal have the keys for that
2016-09-15 10:34:00	koffeekbd	where (c-v,c-[) is ctrl+v, ctrl+[ when in insert mode
2016-09-15 10:34:31	fer750	yeah and switching modes have to do the same thing
2016-09-15 10:34:49	koffeekbd	or just map <Left> and <Right> ;)

2016-09-15 10:37:21	mkoskar	actually urxvt and tmux already sends special C-Arrow sequence, hmm
2016-09-15 10:41:23	koffeekbd	fer750​» I figured it out http://pastebin.com/PNr1WgmY
2016-09-15 10:41:24	phrik	Title: map <ESC>[5D <C-Left> map <ESC>[5C <C-Right> map! <ESC>[5D <C-Left> map! <ESC - Pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)

2016-09-15 10:44:33	koffeekbd	I think I mapped C-Left to the wrong one and C-Right to the wrong one
2016-09-15 10:44:38	koffeekbd	just swap em
2016-09-15 10:44:43	mkoskar	koffeekbd: I think you might want to do smt. like "set <C-Right>=\eOC" and then regular "map <C-Right> smt"
2016-09-15 10:45:13	mkoskar	\eOC is <C-Right> in tmux inside tmux here
2016-09-15 10:46:05	koffeekbd	hm. Im in tmux and it worked for me. I literally just did map ctrl+v,vtrl+<left> <C-Left>  then I replaced the escape with <ESC>
2016-09-15 10:46:24	koffeekbd	I also run tmux -2
2016-09-15 10:46:30	koffeekbd	not sure if that changes anything
2016-09-15 10:47:20	koffeekbd	oh no the pastebin maps the right things to the left/right
2016-09-15 10:47:20		[10:47]
2016-09-15 10:47:28	mkoskar	it might work, but from my experience it might cause timing issues, because mapping are read differently than keycodes, that's why you set "set <C-Right> ..."

2016-09-15 10:49:06	koffeekbd	and I didn't see any timing issues but I believe you
2016-09-15 10:49:21	mkoskar	yes, just replace \eOC with what your terminal send, e.g., run $ cat in terminal and press keycombo
2016-09-15 10:49:42	mkoskar	anyway, my 2 cents :)
2016-09-15 10:50:06	koffeekbd	same thing as <insert>ctrl+v,ctrl+<key>

2016-09-15 11:01:42	koffeekbd	idk fer works here. Maybe try whatever mkoskar was saying. in insert mode if you type ctrl+v,ctrl+<left> you'll get the escape sequence that vim sees when you are in normal mode and hit ctrl+<left>
2016-09-15 11:02:22	koffeekbd	plus fer750 you can run :tab all

2016-09-15 14:53:49	xogium	well that depends on some things... if you want to be able to use it with braille input also, some have braille keyboard
2016-09-15 14:54:01	xogium	mine does
2016-09-15 14:54:01		[14:54]
2016-09-15 14:54:40	NextHendrix	is it faster than voice control
2016-09-15 14:55:51	xogium	which reminds me, I really need to send it to repair... before it makes me do a big blunder, like formatting the wrong hard drive / partition because I missread the number or letter. yes I know someone who had that... with time dust gets stuck in the braille cells so sometimes the dot get stuck in, so you missread
2016-09-15 14:56:21	xogium	I find it faster personally
2016-09-15 14:56:50	 *	NextHendrix learns about braille
2016-09-15 14:57:00	xogium	if I'm without braille, I'm disoriented, and I avoid doing risky stuff, because reviewing character by character with the speech is slower
2016-09-15 14:57:18	minimalism	Output from a computer is readable on a keyboard that displays Braille?

2016-09-15 14:58:28	xogium	if it's not true, yes that could be a bit evil. but if it is, you'd be glad to know it XD
2016-09-15 14:59:29	NextHendrix	wow braille is pretty extensive, i always thought it was just individual letters
2016-09-15 15:00:20	xogium	I know there were some studies made on the brain of blind people... in one of them they perturbed the visual cortex of someone that was reading braille. as soon as it was perturbed, the person was no longer able to read... they investigated more and concluded that the visual cortex is what give the boost to the 4 senses you have left when you can't see

2016-09-15 15:05:00	xogium	imo a braille display is essential. the bad thing about them is the price
2016-09-15 15:06:48	xogium	less expensive one is about $2000, and the most expensive is $14000. and that's without speaking of the commonly used screen reader on windows... $2000 there as well. they sell a sd card with tutorials on how to use it. 10 hours of tutorial, $800
2016-09-15 15:07:14	NextHendrix	wow thats rough

2016-09-15 15:12:27	xogium	NextHendrix: there's 20, 40, and 80 cells. for the software, I don't know much, beside the fact that it uses a driver
2016-09-15 15:14:58	xogium	that's the driver that interpret the signals the display sends, and it can also send those, it's like that the buttons on the side allow you to move one line up or down for example
2016-09-15 15:15:35	xogium	but there's probably a software inside it
2016-09-15 15:15:52	xogium	to allow you to configure options in the menu

The song is the seventh track on the band's third album, Flood. It has become one of the band's most popular songs, despite never having been released as a single. John Linnell and John Flansburgh performed the song, backed by a metronome, for their 1990 Flood promotional video. (1 more message)

2016-10-02 03:08:48	deltasquared	as in, something akin to how android uses XML layout files.

2016-10-02 03:11:41	deltasquared	that's essentially how I did android apps during my module on it, except it wasn't HTML
2016-10-02 03:12:00	deltasquared	maybe just me but it felt so natural

2016-10-02 04:17:54	deltasquared	tbo: I toyed with the idea of either a kernel module or a upower plugin, hardware wise it's a bit like those UPSs that talk over serial

2016-10-02 04:18:49	deltasquared	so maybe I should clock down that i5 core I was going for :P

2016-10-02 04:27:56	deltasquared	isn't the current state that we can get boards where everything but the GPU is open driver wise?

2016-10-02 04:31:35	deltasquared	kernel wise
2016-10-02 04:31:55	deltasquared	shame we don't have an upstream kernel on most android devices yet
2016-10-02 04:32:10	deltasquared	I believe one of the Nexus line had it at some point
2016-10-02 04:32:14	MK_FG	Um, blobs in rpi and such aren't modules, I think

2016-10-02 04:37:29	deltasquared	Let's see then, some random thoughts into my head
2016-10-02 04:37:58	deltasquared	switching regs apparently need about half a volt overhead on their input before they cut off
2016-10-02 04:38:09	deltasquared	so I'd probably want 6V on input
2016-10-02 04:38:28	deltasquared	for an SoC that runs off USB power and other USB peripherals
2016-10-02 04:38:46	deltasquared	Where is that battery I had earlier
2016-10-02 04:40:18	deltasquared	apparently I can get about 1.5V out of a single AA, so I would need 4 in series to get to 6V (or maybe 5 as they don't operate at full voltage all the time)
2016-10-02 04:40:18		[04:40]
2016-10-02 04:40:34	deltasquared	now, where are those mAH ratings
2016-10-02 04:41:22	deltasquared	hmm, 2000mAH seems about right for the higher ones

2016-10-02 04:41:46	deltasquared	so let's say 5 in a row would get me 2AH at a stable 5V
2016-10-02 04:42:32	deltasquared	I'm going to be generous with the current draw, I've got a peak 3A USB hub here and then there is the SoC itself, whatever it be
2016-10-02 04:42:38	deltasquared	let's make it 5 amps.
2016-10-02 04:43:16	deltasquared	so, I'd need 5 rows to get 2 hours at 5 amps
2016-10-02 04:43:27	deltasquared	bearing in mind that's absolute max power draw
2016-10-02 04:43:43	deltasquared	that kinda puts it in line with the life of smartphones time-wise

2016-10-02 05:09:03	tbo	just monitor scaling is still an issue with wayland
2016-10-02 05:09:15	deltasquared	tbo: you have a 4K display?

2016-10-02 05:09:37	minimalism	Just found out Mir is by Canonical
2016-10-02 05:09:40	Kirito	I look forward to the day when my desktop is consistently buttery smooth on Linux
2016-10-02 05:09:43	minimalism	Wayland it is
2016-10-02 05:09:44	tbo	deltasquared: 1:1 is extremely small
2016-10-02 05:09:45	gtmanfred	mir is trash
2016-10-02 05:09:45	deltasquared	tbo: oh damn. that's like my laptop size
2016-10-02 05:09:52	iamawesome	Kirito: How can DE development on Linux be limited, there are many gui application for linux.
2016-10-02 05:09:52	gtmanfred	fuck them
2016-10-02 05:09:54	tbo	deltasquared: it is a laptop
2016-10-02 05:09:58	gtmanfred	they were giant dick holes about mir
2016-10-02 05:10:08	deltasquared	tbo: why is it that only mobile OSes have DPI scaling right?
2016-10-02 05:10:09	Kirito	iamawesome, those two statements don't really have anything to do with each other
2016-10-02 05:10:11	tbo	deltasquared: 1:1.5 works very well
2016-10-02 05:10:17	tbo	deltasquared: no idea
2016-10-02 05:10:22	Kirito	gtmanfred, How so? o_O
2016-10-02 05:10:26	deltasquared	oh that's right, they have one true toolkit that everyone uses

2016-10-02 05:10:35	iamawesome	Kirito: What did you mean by this: "its performance is crap and it apparently has an atrocious API, which is why DE  development on Linux is kind of limited
2016-10-02 05:11:02	Kirito	iamawesome, I mean there aren't really many actually good DE's available on Linux and extremely few people have any interest in developing anything new
2016-10-02 05:11:03	minimalism	How many X programs can actually run in Wayland?
2016-10-02 05:11:11	iamawesome	minimalism: What did you mean by this: " fuck xorg, gtk3, qt5, GNOME, KDE, and every other runaway project that is clearly overdone" ? are you against graphical applications?
2016-10-02 05:11:12	gtmanfred	Kirito: they used to be working on wayland, and then just stopped without saying anything for 6 months, then announced mir one day, and put up a big article on their home page with a bunch of FUD and non truths about wayland, and the wayland group just tore them apart
2016-10-02 05:11:14	tbo	minimalism: all, through Xwayland

2016-10-02 05:11:31	deltasquared	I would know
2016-10-02 05:11:44	tbo	Kirito: GNOME works well, KDE will soon
2016-10-02 05:11:52	minimalism	iamawesome: I'm saying all of it's unnecessary and over the top.
2016-10-02 05:11:55	minimalism	They don't know when to stop.
2016-10-02 05:12:00	Kirito	gtmanfred, o.O link please?
2016-10-02 05:12:07	iamawesome	Kirito: Gnome,KDE are good desktop environment, xfce4 and lxde are also good, many people use those.
2016-10-02 05:12:08	Kirito	to the tearing them apart I mean
2016-10-02 05:12:08	gtmanfred	Kirito: it was back several years ago
2016-10-02 05:12:21	gtmanfred	Kirito: they have removed the false statements from the mir webpage
2016-10-02 05:12:21	Kirito	hmm, meh
2016-10-02 05:12:22	deltasquared	minimalism: aside from the pre-made widgets, what do you think of Java's Swing toolkit?
2016-10-02 05:12:23	tbo	iamawesome: lxqt ;-)
2016-10-02 05:12:26	gtmanfred	and I don't have my logs from #wayland that day
2016-10-02 05:12:33	deltasquared	I think it's nice and clean in concept
2016-10-02 05:12:35	minimalism	deltasquared: No opinion, but I don't care for java to begin with.
2016-10-02 05:12:40	Kirito	Yeah, I know the page you are talking about, but I haven't seen anything contest it
2016-10-02 05:12:42	gtmanfred	where some dick from Mir project came in and said 'It is our turn to pull a systemd'
2016-10-02 05:12:45	minimalism	I use a program that uses swing and I hate it though..
2016-10-02 05:12:56	deltasquared	minimalism: it is themeable I believe
2016-10-02 05:13:00	iamawesome	minimalism: Do you use only terminal/console ?
2016-10-02 05:13:02	Kirito	I'm open to seeing the opposing argument though
2016-10-02 05:13:04	gtmanfred	Kirito: it used to say false stuff about waylands input stack being vulnerably when it wasn't

2016-10-02 05:13:12	Kirito	Oh, I didn't see that bit
2016-10-02 05:13:14	iamawesome	minimalism: Why do you hate swing?
2016-10-02 05:13:16	Kirito	or maybe I did
2016-10-02 05:13:20	Kirito	I don't remember
2016-10-02 05:13:24	gtmanfred	it was only on the first 2 days after mir was announced
2016-10-02 05:13:24	tbo	I already use libinput
2016-10-02 05:13:26	minimalism	iamawesome: I said I use a program that uses swing, and I hate it
2016-10-02 05:13:42	tbo	and mir isn't even finished
2016-10-02 05:13:43	deltasquared	minimalism: care to share? :P
2016-10-02 05:13:50	iamawesome	minimalism: So you hate the program, not swing, right?
2016-10-02 05:13:54	minimalism	it's some image watermarker
2016-10-02 05:13:55	Kirito	I currently use Unity though, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-10-02 05:13:59	jelle	wut
2016-10-02 05:14:01	Kirito	I'm mostly neutral to Canonical
2016-10-02 05:14:02	tbo	it won't come with 16.10, maybe with 17.04 or .10
2016-10-02 05:14:11	deltasquared	I'm going to refrain from commenting about Mir, I don't know enough.
2016-10-02 05:14:16	gtmanfred	i did like that the mir team said fuck it, we are going to use c++11, but then they were dicks and like every canonical project, you have to accept their CLA to be able to compile it with the ubuntu cc
2016-10-02 05:14:19	iamawesome	I didn't like the Applications menu of gnome-3 , or is it called unity?
2016-10-02 05:14:31	jelle	gtmanfred: wat
2016-10-02 05:14:33	Kirito	though I do think Linux getting more corporate / company backing is a good thing in general
2016-10-02 05:14:41	iamawesome	gtmanfred: What is that mir team?
2016-10-02 05:14:48	Kirito	I'm not sure whether Canonical is the ideal example of that
2016-10-02 05:14:52	Kirito	but still
2016-10-02 05:14:56	gtmanfred	jelle: did they fix that, it used to be you couldn't compile mir unless you accepted some extra licensing agreement, and used their compiler
2016-10-02 05:14:58	minimalism	Kirito: I don't like distributions being corporate. It's only good when corporations sponsor development.
2016-10-02 05:15:04	deltasquared	Kirito: I sometimes wonder how much we should be thanking Valve for pushing our 3D graphics forward
2016-10-02 05:15:06	jelle	gtmanfred: LOL
2016-10-02 05:15:10	jelle	gtmanfred: I have no interest in miir

2016-10-02 05:15:36	Kirito	SLI support in Linux is still archaic as fuck

2016-10-02 05:16:01	deltasquared	Reventlov: WSUS?
2016-10-02 05:16:07	deltasquared	MK_FG: I can do.
2016-10-02 05:16:08	gtmanfred	i don't have a linux desktop/laptop anymore :( only servers, so i don't use xorg or wayland at all
2016-10-02 05:16:09	Kirito	like the only games SLI improves performance in on Linux are DOOM era games

2016-10-02 05:16:21	jelle	gtmanfred: is saltstack this eviil
2016-10-02 05:16:25	Reventlov	minimalism: sway
2016-10-02 05:16:25	Kirito	It hurts performance with literally everything else
2016-10-02 05:16:29	Reventlov	a drop-in replacement for i3
2016-10-02 05:16:38	Reventlov	but, I use it in tabbed mode always maximized
2016-10-02 05:16:43	gtmanfred	jelle: i just use macOS, it works and I just install all the gnu tools using brew

2016-10-02 05:17:11	Kirito	RHEL is a good example of a corporate distro
2016-10-02 05:17:15	Kirito	I'm not sure about Ubuntu though
2016-10-02 05:17:18	gtmanfred	yes it is
2016-10-02 05:17:24	tbo	iamawesome: nano I think
2016-10-02 05:17:29	gtmanfred	ubuntu is 100% corporate
2016-10-02 05:17:41	Kirito	I guess we're talking enterprise vs. consumer here though
2016-10-02 05:17:49	minimalism	Kirito: yes
2016-10-02 05:18:15	gtmanfred	go work at a hosting company, they want $20 per instance that uses ubuntu, because it uses their 'ubuntu' trademark, but want to also charge you for official support

2016-10-02 05:18:24	Kirito	I think it's a good thing as long as it's contributing back to the community and sponsoring development
2016-10-02 05:18:31	Kirito	which.. I don't know.
2016-10-02 05:18:34	gtmanfred	iamawesome: unless you need support for patches
2016-10-02 05:18:36	iamawesome	Debian looks good for server too.
2016-10-02 05:18:52	minimalism	Kirito: If anything, Debian and Ubuntu are keeping the rest of us in the stone age.
2016-10-02 05:18:53	Kirito	Ubuntu's freetype patches for example, they are publicly available but they aren't actually merged with freetype for whatever reason
2016-10-02 05:18:59	gtmanfred	redhat definitely contributes back, ubuntu is a bunch of babies and mostly hold their patches in the packages seperate and rarely contribute upstream
2016-10-02 05:19:02	Kirito	I don't know if that's because of licensing or not
2016-10-02 05:19:07	gtmanfred	it wasn't
2016-10-02 05:19:08	minimalism	Until they both go away, these web hosts will keep slacking and offering only those.
2016-10-02 05:19:10	gtmanfred	it was because lazy

2016-10-02 05:19:54	Kirito	When was that?
2016-10-02 05:19:56	gtmanfred	but ubuntu didn't do that
2016-10-02 05:20:00	Kirito	ah
2016-10-02 05:20:19	gtmanfred	fuck if i know, like a year ago
2016-10-02 05:20:36	gtmanfred	i just remember the ubuntu freetype aur packages getting nuked cause the patch sets were merged
2016-10-02 05:20:40	Kirito	oh, I guess that was right around the time I switched my laptop to Ubuntu
2016-10-02 05:20:45	Kirito	ah

2016-10-02 05:23:30	deltasquared	I have a question: does Canonical have any justification for Mir? as in the ones they talk about, asides them wanted to own a piece of the stack
2016-10-02 05:23:36	gtmanfred	IUS existed way before SCL

2016-10-02 05:24:55	gtmanfred	jelle: both of the guys who work at rackspace and package for IUS are arch users, so they package like arch does, the newest stable without extra patches unless a major bug is found

2016-10-02 06:17:08	mpan	They’ve introduced an option that allows people, on their free will, to enable feature that will slow down your downloads unless you have ratio of at least 2:1.

2016-10-02 06:22:28	deltasquared	GCC and Clang manage to fuck up and fall back to an unrolled loop
2016-10-02 06:22:29	mpan	The problem I see is that if people will start using this, then actually we may end up with less full copies in the swarm, which will affect everyone :(
2016-10-02 06:22:43	jelle	unroll them looks!
2016-10-02 06:22:51	deltasquared	mpan: so in other words the developer may have just shot everyone in the foot?
2016-10-02 06:22:58	mpan	This is what I believe.
2016-10-02 06:23:12	mpan	Honest intentions, but lack of analysis of the outcomes.
2016-10-02 06:23:26	deltasquared	the weird part is, the individual stages are all vectorisable, but when combined... no dice.
2016-10-02 06:23:40	deltasquared	mpan: that sounds like the crypto kind of mistakes too
2016-10-02 06:24:49	mpan	“crypto kind of mistakes” — are you refering to things like “todo fail” or the latest OpenSSL bugfix that have introduced RCE?
2016-10-02 06:25:58	deltasquared	mpan: I'm more referring to when people try to do things in crypto that they didn't realise were mistakes, I guess those could count

2016-10-02 06:27:18	deltasquared	I hope never to have to write crypto code...
2016-10-02 06:27:36	deltasquared	I'll just use a lib that decodes to/from an FD for SSL connections and be done with it.
2016-10-02 06:27:47	mpan	Well… I hope that if I will, someone will be there to overview my code.
2016-10-02 06:27:53	deltasquared	mpan: indeed.
2016-10-02 06:29:41	mpan	And for µT: I hope not many people will use it. Some will of course: to increase their self-esteem (you know: “Hey, look! I’m so cool, I keep my ratio high with this!” kids).
2016-10-02 06:29:57	deltasquared	mpan: ehh, I just keep the thing open
2016-10-02 06:29:59	mpan	But let us hope there isn’t many of them.
2016-10-02 06:30:02	deltasquared	I have a better metric.
2016-10-02 06:30:10	deltasquared	I acquire shows sometime...
2016-10-02 06:30:28	deltasquared	when I watch them, I always have transmission open seeding.
2016-10-02 06:30:29	deltasquared	there.
2016-10-02 06:30:39	deltasquared	easy 2:1 ratio before the end of the first series.
2016-10-02 06:30:42	mpan	Well… same here. I just keep things open at least until 3.0 or until I back them up and remove from HDD.

2016-10-05 15:56:31	DarkFeather	Same partition? Yeah, you're not really protecting yourself from disk failure. Second disk? Better idea if you're not going to RAID.
2016-10-05 15:56:38	Boohbah	KKKrx: Kind of useless if your disk fails.
2016-10-05 15:56:56	DarkFeather	You could also keep an encrypted gzipped tarball on a secondary disk of all your config and special files, KKKrx

2016-10-05 15:59:45	alyptik	it runs but never copies adata
2016-10-05 15:59:48	Boohbah	Is it a USB flash drive or a HDD? That could be why it's really slow.

2016-10-05 17:40:22	Boohbah	But you can do it if you want to. I don't see a benefit for what I normally use sshd for.

2016-10-26 10:04:42	conmanworknor	wont let me set up my own workstation
2016-10-26 10:04:47	bug2000	mar77i, Just like that?
2016-10-26 10:04:51	alyptik	been trying to figure out for hours

2016-10-26 10:05:15	nshp	alyptik: there's a C++ compiler in there somewhere, I forget what they called it
2016-10-26 10:05:25	alyptik	what about gcc ?
2016-10-26 10:05:43	bug2000	alyptik, You should alias gcc to clang :)
2016-10-26 10:05:47	nshp	yes, icc works as a drop-in for gcc
2016-10-26 10:05:51	alyptik	do I need Intel linker or something? I only get segfaults
2016-10-26 10:05:54	mar77i	bug2000: I started end of sep, and only recently got a graphics card so I can use all four monitors on my desk

2016-10-26 10:06:35	conmanworknor	mar77i, they gave you 4 monitors?
2016-10-26 10:06:43	alyptik	I guess I will suck it up and gdb 
2016-10-26 10:06:45	bug2000	mar77i, How much do you need to move the mouse? (or alt+tab or whatever)
2016-10-26 10:06:51	nshp	I have 4 monitors and 2 laptops on my desk
2016-10-26 10:06:53	mar77i	bug2000: one for email and private stuff. one for st, one for geany and one for browsering-dev
2016-10-26 10:06:55	nshp	and 4 workstations

2016-10-26 10:09:03	bug2000	mar77i, Sounds saner than me running eclipse, pycharm and vim.
2016-10-26 10:09:23	conmanworknor	i found my first "because we hate ourselves" comment in my work codebase today
2016-10-26 10:09:24	mar77i	geany is great btw, and mostly an editor instead of an ide.

2016-10-26 10:10:07	bug2000	conmanworknor, What was it?
2016-10-26 10:10:12	mar77i	I must admit have a thorough hatred on IDEs. eclipse, atom or the sublime bullshit coworkers use is just too much for my tastes.
2016-10-26 10:10:25	alyptik	vim is the only ide i have stuck with
2016-10-26 10:10:36	bug2000	mar77i, Are you using qutebrowser? I found myself running two different browsers to split the nonsense.
2016-10-26 10:10:43	alyptik	everything else feels fat

2016-10-26 10:11:23	bug2000	mar77i, I use Firefox for the most part as well. Though I found it easier to have qutebrowser for all my programming related searches. It simplifies my browsing.
2016-10-26 10:11:24	alyptik	I do

2016-10-26 10:13:44	alyptik	no idea how to even do that in eclipse lmao
2016-10-26 10:13:47	mar77i	well php is as idiotic as it could get.

2016-10-26 10:15:37	mar77i	MANY of the functions you start reimplementing on top of the not very extensive standard library you will do because you'll find that the stdlib just screws up in too many places.
2016-10-26 10:15:37	bug2000	alyptik, Real story. Happened to me with PHP.
2016-10-26 10:16:03	mar77i	strpos/strstr in php are the most surprising features I ever read about in any programming language
2016-10-26 10:16:30	alyptik	string str*?

2016-10-26 11:58:33	alyptik	checking whether the C compiler works... no
2016-10-26 11:58:35	roukoswarf	when amateur programmers try and make games i cry a little.
2016-10-26 11:58:51	roukoswarf	games are some of the most painful code you can write
2016-10-26 11:58:58	roukoswarf	dont be that guy
2016-10-26 11:59:02	roukoswarf	that guy is a cunt
2016-10-26 11:59:07	chee	uh oh

2016-10-26 11:59:17	pcspkr	yea I don't know why people even want to write games
2016-10-26 11:59:24	roukoswarf	did i say a bad word?
2016-10-26 11:59:34	roukoswarf	the rules here on bad words are pretty random.
2016-10-26 11:59:35	conmanworknor	Is there a repo anywhere with all the old ncc and gcc versions?
2016-10-26 11:59:50	pcspkr	roukoswarf: some classes are more protected than others
2016-10-26 11:59:50	pulec	making a good game is crazy task
2016-10-26 12:00:00	pulec	I am just enjoying the prototyping now
2016-10-26 12:00:20	roukoswarf	conmanworknor: you can get source from the repos and build it
2016-10-26 12:00:25	roukoswarf	gcc has many mirrors

2016-10-26 12:00:44	pulec	and I have some idea about big open project, not focused on making money as a indie game
2016-10-26 12:01:03	roukoswarf	"big open project" + amateur programmer
2016-10-26 12:01:08	roukoswarf	you keep making funny words
2016-10-26 12:01:10	roukoswarf	keep saying words
2016-10-26 12:01:11	tigrmesh	you're going to have to find another insult, roukoswarf.  i mean, come on.  have some imagination
2016-10-26 12:01:24	alyptik	the plot thickens
2016-10-26 12:01:24	pulec	I am stoner, I have dreams, let me have them
2016-10-26 12:01:26	conmanworknor	I don't think nes c compiler can be found anymore
2016-10-26 12:01:29	conmanworknor	old versions anyway
2016-10-26 12:01:30	pcspkr	tigrmesh: what's wrong with the classics tho
