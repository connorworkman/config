2016-09-28 14:35:25	wallbroken	now i can ping 10.0.0.0
2016-09-28 14:35:54	@danhunsaker	OK.  You don't have to mention me if we're the only ones talking, by the way.

2016-09-28 14:41:26	dcarmich	@danhunsaker: I've just updated my personal FreeBSD server from 10.3-RELEASE to 11.0-RELEASE, and every other service on it works fine other than my OpenVPN. The VPN connection is properly established from the endpoint to the server, but no traffic passes out of the server from the VPN client. Would it be best to ask on the FreeBSD forums?
2016-09-28 14:42:10	@danhunsaker	Sounds like either firewall or routing to me.
2016-09-28 14:42:42	@danhunsaker	But others may be more knowledgeable.
2016-09-28 14:44:07	dcarmich	Here are my ipfw rules and netstat -r: http://pastebin.com/TCJFG87P
2016-09-28 14:45:01	@danhunsaker	wallbroken: If you need my attention specifically, it's OK to mention me.  Didn't mean to imply I don't want people talking to me ever.  Just that you risk only talking to me, and having others (who may know the answer faster) skip your comments because they're addressed to me specifically.  (Plus, if we're the only ones actively talking, there isn't really
2016-09-28 14:45:01	@danhunsaker	anyone else you'd be addressing anyway, so by default all your comments would be directed at me.)
2016-09-28 14:45:58	wallbroken	i was mentioning you just because to get you answer faster. that's all
2016-09-28 14:46:31	dcarmich	Any clues there?

2016-09-28 14:48:08	@danhunsaker	wallbroken: While I understand that, it *is* a little rude...  :-\
2016-09-28 14:49:01	@danhunsaker	dcarmich: Your routes are ... unusual.  The fact 10.8.0.1 and 10.8.0.2 are both routed to the lo device is also unusual.
2016-09-28 14:49:57	@danhunsaker	The firewall rules don't seem to match up with the routes, either.  You have a route for 10.8.0.0/24, and a NAT rule for 10.8.0.0/16...
2016-09-28 14:50:49	dcarmich	My hosting provider has their backup server on 10.12.44.0, and in the default image added a static route to the 10.0.0.0 network with '10.12.44.225' ... should I remove that?
2016-09-28 14:50:55	dcarmich	(I'm not doing any routing-table stuff manually.)
2016-09-28 14:52:15	@danhunsaker	That one shouldn't be causing any issues, here, as the 10.8.0.0/24 is more specific.

2016-09-28 15:27:43	@danhunsaker	I'd dial back your verbosity to no greater than 4.  5 is mostly extraneous unless your issue really requires something only visible there.  Also, all the 'push' lines will only work on the server side.
2016-09-28 15:28:12	@danhunsaker	And of course, as the /topic says, Patience is a virtue.  I don't live in IRC.  :P
2016-09-28 15:29:24	@danhunsaker	But yeah, if that's your server config, the 'push' lines seem OK.

2016-09-28 18:17:56	@krzee	rustic: do you know the servers you will connect to using irssi?
2016-09-28 18:17:56		[18:17]
2016-09-28 18:18:26	@krzee	because openvpn doesnt work by app, but it works by routing table, so you can have it only route traffic to the irc servers over the vpn
2016-09-28 18:19:04	rustic	cool
2016-09-28 18:19:16	@krzee	of course you can do a very advanced setup and actually do it by app
2016-09-28 18:19:32	rustic	the irc servers may change but I could make an irssi plugin to set router if you point me at documentation for how to do it
2016-09-28 18:19:43	@krzee	in that case you would add a second routing table, then in your firewall you would mark packets as they go out to hit the other routing table
2016-09-28 18:19:43	rustic	I did try an advanced setup but lxc containers don't like to set namespaces
2016-09-28 18:20:11	rustic	i would be more interested in your second solution

2016-09-28 18:20:57	@krzee	but its way easier to just add some routes
2016-09-28 18:21:07	rustic	can you show me that documentation as well
2016-09-28 18:21:18	rustic	did i mention how much you rock?
2016-09-28 18:21:35	@krzee	in which case you would treat it like a !redirect setup, but dont add --redirect-gateway, instead just add --route <ip_of_ircserver> 255.255.255.255
2016-09-28 18:22:01	@krzee	which you can add many of
2016-09-28 18:22:15	rustic	would that require restarting the instance of openvpn everytime i add a server or can it rehash the config?

2016-09-28 19:55:35	@krzee	unless the ping works, in which case say so and we'll continue from there
2016-09-28 19:57:12	dcarmich	yes
2016-09-28 19:57:13	dcarmich	the ping worked
2016-09-28 19:57:42	dcarmich	(With the commented-out bits.)
2016-09-28 19:58:11	@krzee	ok great
2016-09-28 19:58:59	@krzee	now show me the up and down scripts
2016-09-28 19:59:16	@krzee	then ill give you another config to try
2016-09-28 19:59:59	@krzee	i like that paste.ee
2016-09-28 20:00:04	@krzee	!paste
2016-09-28 20:00:05	@vpnHelper	"paste" is "pastebin" is (#1) please paste anything with more than 5 lines into a pastebin site or (#2) https://gist.github.com is recommended for fewest ads; try fpaste.org or paste.kde.org as backups or (#3) If you're pasting config files, see !configs for grep syntax to remove comments or (#4) gist allows multiple files per paste, useful if you have several files to show
2016-09-28 20:00:25	@krzee	!learn paste as paste.ee is also nice

2016-09-28 20:01:30	@krzee	oh ok cool
2016-09-28 20:02:32	@krzee	may i make an unrelated suggestion?
2016-09-28 20:03:21	@krzee	i think it's always best to put redirect-gateway in the client configs instead of the server config, because then each client can choose for themselves
2016-09-28 20:03:31	@krzee	since you're currently your only client, doesnt matter
2016-09-28 20:03:40	dcarmich	I see.
2016-09-28 20:04:01	@krzee	https://paste.ee/p/0vjVx    <--- try that
2016-09-28 20:04:03	@krzee	same ping test
2016-09-28 20:07:10	dcarmich	Just doing it.. ping 10.8.0.1 works.

2016-09-29 01:40:51	Gaffel	And I've replied.
2016-09-29 01:41:01	Gaffel	You need a tool that creates certificates.
2016-09-29 01:41:09	Gaffel	OpenSSL has the tool for that.
2016-09-29 01:41:13	wallbroken	when you install openvpn, there are components list to be checked to install
2016-09-29 01:41:30	Gaffel	Okay, yes.
2016-09-29 01:41:36	wallbroken	one of thet is "OpenSSL utilities"
2016-09-29 01:41:43	wallbroken	is that i need to create certs?
2016-09-29 01:41:46	Gaffel	Yes
2016-09-29 01:41:53	Gaffel	You claimed that you question was clear, it wasn't.

2016-09-29 01:42:15	Gaffel	You never said that you were looking at the OpenVPN for Windows.
2016-09-29 01:42:27	Gaffel	So your claim that your question was clear is FALSE.
2016-09-29 01:42:36	Gaffel	No, easyrsa is not required but it makes it easier.
2016-09-29 01:43:53	wallbroken	Gaffel, so i need "openSSL utilities" on openvpn installation?
2016-09-29 01:44:11	Gaffel	I answered Yes.
2016-09-29 01:44:36	wallbroken	there are also "Openvpn rsa certificate management script", this is easyrsa?

2016-09-29 02:30:26	@dazo	okay, then you need proper SNI which OpenVPN cannot do
2016-09-29 02:31:22	wallbroken	ok, i solved with iptables -F FORWARD before rules
2016-09-29 02:31:33	wallbroken	i think you need to fix openvpn documentation

2016-09-29 02:48:03	BtbN	A /64 is quite excessive for OpenVPN though
2016-09-29 02:48:15	BtbN	it's not like you'll ever have a couple trillion of clients
2016-09-29 02:48:42	mexx	/128 ?
2016-09-29 02:49:11	BtbN	That'd leave you with exactly one client!
2016-09-29 02:49:23	mexx	:)
2016-09-29 02:49:31	BtbN	I usually use a /112
2016-09-29 02:49:41	BtbN	so 65k clients, still plenty
2016-09-29 02:49:41	mexx	I actually already have  server-ipv6 /64 in my conf
2016-09-29 02:50:09	BtbN	you also want a propper IPv6 firewall and forwarding, of course.
2016-09-29 02:50:34	mexx	and something like radvd ?
2016-09-29 02:50:38	BtbN	no
2016-09-29 02:50:53	BtbN	there is no layer2 with OpenVPN unless you use tap VPN, which is a bad idea in 99% of the cases.
2016-09-29 02:51:14	mexx	so how can I distribute addresses ?
2016-09-29 02:51:19	mexx	dhcpv6 ?

2016-09-29 02:56:09	BtbN	why wouldn't you?
2016-09-29 02:56:41	BtbN	you can just set the default route over the VPN, as you probably don't have a native connection.
2016-09-29 02:58:14	mexx	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_local_address, says "They are not routable in the global IPv6 Internet"

2016-09-29 03:02:42	@dazo	mexx: good ... then you need to ensure you have IPv6 forwarding enabled ... and that your firewall allows IPv6 traffic to pass from VPN to wherever

2016-09-29 03:07:23	@dazo	mexx: okay ... so you then need a separate /64 on your LAN which is then routed via the VPN /112 (or /64) subnet ... your LAN can use radvd to quickly get a stateless autoconfig setup running
2016-09-29 03:08:46	@dazo	(as I said: "the rest is tackled by normal TCP/IP routing")
2016-09-29 03:10:50	mexx	but then I can only go as far as the openvpn server ?

2016-09-29 03:15:01	mexx	but since there's no nat like mechanism, how do I route private addresses once I get on the vpn server ?
2016-09-29 03:15:24	BtbN	what private addresses?
2016-09-29 03:15:35	@dazo	why can you not use a /64 segment of your public pool?
2016-09-29 03:15:57	mexx	oh
2016-09-29 03:16:04	@dazo	you just declare for yourself that *this* /64 belongs to the LAN behind your VPN client

2016-09-29 11:36:35	@dazo	ahh, right
2016-09-29 11:36:38	Gaffel	Set policy to DROP
2016-09-29 11:36:54	Gaffel	Then that generic established/related acceptance.
2016-09-29 11:37:04	Gaffel	Then you put strict rules below that.
2016-09-29 11:37:12	wallbroken	-A FORWARD -s 10.0.0.0/24 -i tun0 -j ACCEPT
2016-09-29 11:37:18	wallbroken	-A FORWARD -o tun0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
2016-09-29 11:37:26	wallbroken	that's an old deprecated way?
2016-09-29 11:37:31	@dazo	yes
2016-09-29 11:38:06	@dazo	 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW   //    -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED
2016-09-29 11:38:17	@dazo	that's what you need
2016-09-29 11:38:31	Gaffel	-A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
2016-09-29 11:38:41	wallbroken	yes, even if i just tried both the way, and both are working
2016-09-29 11:38:51	Gaffel	Yup
2016-09-29 11:39:04	Gaffel	It will break too much if it's removed completely.
2016-09-29 11:39:17	Gaffel	iptables is planned to be deprecated as a whole anyway, so no rush.
2016-09-29 11:39:29	@danhunsaker	But the conntrack module is not only loads better than the state module, it'll also still be around in a few versions.
2016-09-29 11:39:49	@danhunsaker	I.E., when iptables itself evaporates.
2016-09-29 11:40:03	Gaffel	The successor, nftables, uses conntrack.
2016-09-29 11:40:13	@dazo	yupp
2016-09-29 11:40:14	wallbroken	another thing: i enabled a static routing rule over the router, instead of using nat
2016-09-29 11:40:16	@danhunsaker	Indeed.
2016-09-29 11:40:21	wallbroken	it's good than nat?
2016-09-29 11:40:28	wallbroken	*better
2016-09-29 11:40:28	Gaffel	I prefer nftables.

2016-09-29 11:40:49	Gaffel	Routing is better.
2016-09-29 11:40:54	@dazo	wallbroken: NAT is a pure hack to avoid depletion of IPv4 addresses during the 1990s
2016-09-29 11:41:15	wallbroken	i said the router: when you get packet with destination network 10.0.0.0, forward them to: 192.168.1.100 (which is openvpn server into the lan)
2016-09-29 11:41:15		[11:41]
2016-09-29 11:41:35	wallbroken	router is the default gateway
2016-09-29 11:41:59	wallbroken	so, when an host doesn't know anything about a NET, it will forward to default GW
2016-09-29 11:42:08	@dazo	correct
2016-09-29 11:42:17	@dazo	!tcpip
2016-09-29 11:42:18	@vpnHelper	"tcpip" is http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/gg243376.pdf See chapter 3.1 for useful basic TCP/IP networking knowledge you should probably know
2016-09-29 11:42:32	wallbroken	dazo, i studied it at university
2016-09-29 11:43:00	@dazo	wallbroken: so did my wife, I stopped after 6 months ... but I know networking, she doesn't
2016-09-29 11:43:04	Gaffel	Then you'll become familiar with iptables really quick.
2016-09-29 11:43:10	@dazo	lol
2016-09-29 11:44:35	@dazo	Gaffel: which distro have you installed nftables on?
2016-09-29 11:44:35	wallbroken	and i do know what NAT does, it's changing source and destination address to make multiplation of  local IP streams over a single public IP
2016-09-29 11:44:48	Gaffel	dazo, nothing by default as far as I know.
2016-09-29 11:44:57	wallbroken	but as far i know, nat will be destroyed when ipv6 will come up
2016-09-29 11:45:18	@dazo	Gaffel: compiled yourself and installed?  which distro are you on?
2016-09-29 11:45:19	Gaffel	It's non-existant in CentOS (but vailible from the elep-release repo, but broken)
2016-09-29 11:45:26	Gaffel	I use Arch
2016-09-29 11:45:40	wallbroken	dazo, iptables works also with ipv6?
2016-09-29 11:45:48	Gaffel	No, but ip6tables
2016-09-29 11:46:28	wallbroken	so, i don't need to learn something will be no more useful in a couple of time?
2016-09-29 11:46:42	@dazo	wallbroken: there are NAT66 and NAT64 ..... but there's a lot of NAT66 controversies .... NAT64 can be quite useful to access IPv4 nets over a pure IPv6 net - but quite a job to configure correctly (need DNS64 too)
2016-09-29 11:47:13	Gaffel	Once you need to switch to nftables, you'll learn it really quick. It's more readable.
2016-09-29 11:47:30	wallbroken	dazo, IP has something called "PROTO 41" which allows to encapsulate ipv6 frame over an ipv4
2016-09-29 11:47:31	@dazo	the concept is basically the same between iptables and ip6tables ... the biggest challenge is that while IPv4 have ARP, IPv6 depends on ICMPv6 packets to do the same - which can be firewalled
2016-09-29 11:48:12	@dazo	wallbroken: the IPv6 encapsulation is something different again
2016-09-29 11:48:36	@dazo	protocol 41 *is* the IPv6 protocol
2016-09-29 11:49:05	wallbroken	protocol 41 is not the way to make "ipv6 tunnels" ?
2016-09-29 11:49:10	@dazo	nope

2016-09-29 11:59:13	Gaffel	The deployment of IPv6 is so slow that it should be a crime.
2016-09-29 11:59:34	@danhunsaker	Looking forward to when we have enough devices that we start looking seriously at NATting v6-only networks...
2016-09-29 11:59:39	Gaffel	It's criminally slow.

2016-09-29 12:00:47	wallbroken	dazo, about the past thing: -o eth0, in "iptables -I FORWARD -i tun0 -o eth0 -s 10.8.0.0/24 -d 192.168.0.0/24 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT" is needed or not needed?
2016-09-29 12:01:35	@dazo	danhunsaker: hehehe .... considering the "amazing" adoption speed of IPv6, it's good that NAT66 specs have been worked on already :-P
2016-09-29 12:02:27	@dazo	wallbroken: -o in that one is hardening your setup ... to ensure that traffic going to 192.168.0.0/24 will only be allowed if it is routed to eth0
2016-09-29 12:02:58	@dazo	if it is needed, is entirely up to how strict you want your setup

2016-09-29 12:12:01	@dazo	wallbroken: yes ... but iptables are just the user-space tools which configures the kernel .... so if you do that you can't change the netfilter config already set in the kernel
2016-09-29 12:12:31	@dazo	if you're netfilter config is clean/empty ... then it will be an unprotected/not firewalled box
