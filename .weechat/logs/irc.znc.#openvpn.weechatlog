2016-09-28 14:35:25	wallbroken	now i can ping 10.0.0.0
2016-09-28 14:35:54	@danhunsaker	OK.  You don't have to mention me if we're the only ones talking, by the way.

2016-09-28 14:41:26	dcarmich	@danhunsaker: I've just updated my personal FreeBSD server from 10.3-RELEASE to 11.0-RELEASE, and every other service on it works fine other than my OpenVPN. The VPN connection is properly established from the endpoint to the server, but no traffic passes out of the server from the VPN client. Would it be best to ask on the FreeBSD forums?
2016-09-28 14:42:10	@danhunsaker	Sounds like either firewall or routing to me.
2016-09-28 14:42:42	@danhunsaker	But others may be more knowledgeable.
2016-09-28 14:44:07	dcarmich	Here are my ipfw rules and netstat -r: http://pastebin.com/TCJFG87P
2016-09-28 14:45:01	@danhunsaker	wallbroken: If you need my attention specifically, it's OK to mention me.  Didn't mean to imply I don't want people talking to me ever.  Just that you risk only talking to me, and having others (who may know the answer faster) skip your comments because they're addressed to me specifically.  (Plus, if we're the only ones actively talking, there isn't really
2016-09-28 14:45:01	@danhunsaker	anyone else you'd be addressing anyway, so by default all your comments would be directed at me.)
2016-09-28 14:45:58	wallbroken	i was mentioning you just because to get you answer faster. that's all
2016-09-28 14:46:31	dcarmich	Any clues there?

2016-09-28 14:48:08	@danhunsaker	wallbroken: While I understand that, it *is* a little rude...  :-\
2016-09-28 14:49:01	@danhunsaker	dcarmich: Your routes are ... unusual.  The fact 10.8.0.1 and 10.8.0.2 are both routed to the lo device is also unusual.
2016-09-28 14:49:57	@danhunsaker	The firewall rules don't seem to match up with the routes, either.  You have a route for 10.8.0.0/24, and a NAT rule for 10.8.0.0/16...
2016-09-28 14:50:49	dcarmich	My hosting provider has their backup server on 10.12.44.0, and in the default image added a static route to the 10.0.0.0 network with '10.12.44.225' ... should I remove that?
2016-09-28 14:50:55	dcarmich	(I'm not doing any routing-table stuff manually.)
2016-09-28 14:52:15	@danhunsaker	That one shouldn't be causing any issues, here, as the 10.8.0.0/24 is more specific.

2016-09-28 15:27:43	@danhunsaker	I'd dial back your verbosity to no greater than 4.  5 is mostly extraneous unless your issue really requires something only visible there.  Also, all the 'push' lines will only work on the server side.
2016-09-28 15:28:12	@danhunsaker	And of course, as the /topic says, Patience is a virtue.  I don't live in IRC.  :P
2016-09-28 15:29:24	@danhunsaker	But yeah, if that's your server config, the 'push' lines seem OK.

2016-09-28 18:17:56	@krzee	rustic: do you know the servers you will connect to using irssi?
2016-09-28 18:17:56		[18:17]
2016-09-28 18:18:26	@krzee	because openvpn doesnt work by app, but it works by routing table, so you can have it only route traffic to the irc servers over the vpn
2016-09-28 18:19:04	rustic	cool
2016-09-28 18:19:16	@krzee	of course you can do a very advanced setup and actually do it by app
2016-09-28 18:19:32	rustic	the irc servers may change but I could make an irssi plugin to set router if you point me at documentation for how to do it
2016-09-28 18:19:43	@krzee	in that case you would add a second routing table, then in your firewall you would mark packets as they go out to hit the other routing table
2016-09-28 18:19:43	rustic	I did try an advanced setup but lxc containers don't like to set namespaces
2016-09-28 18:20:11	rustic	i would be more interested in your second solution

2016-09-28 18:20:57	@krzee	but its way easier to just add some routes
2016-09-28 18:21:07	rustic	can you show me that documentation as well
2016-09-28 18:21:18	rustic	did i mention how much you rock?
2016-09-28 18:21:35	@krzee	in which case you would treat it like a !redirect setup, but dont add --redirect-gateway, instead just add --route <ip_of_ircserver> 255.255.255.255
2016-09-28 18:22:01	@krzee	which you can add many of
2016-09-28 18:22:15	rustic	would that require restarting the instance of openvpn everytime i add a server or can it rehash the config?

2016-09-28 19:55:35	@krzee	unless the ping works, in which case say so and we'll continue from there
2016-09-28 19:57:12	dcarmich	yes
2016-09-28 19:57:13	dcarmich	the ping worked
2016-09-28 19:57:42	dcarmich	(With the commented-out bits.)
2016-09-28 19:58:11	@krzee	ok great
2016-09-28 19:58:59	@krzee	now show me the up and down scripts
2016-09-28 19:59:16	@krzee	then ill give you another config to try
2016-09-28 19:59:59	@krzee	i like that paste.ee
2016-09-28 20:00:04	@krzee	!paste
2016-09-28 20:00:05	@vpnHelper	"paste" is "pastebin" is (#1) please paste anything with more than 5 lines into a pastebin site or (#2) https://gist.github.com is recommended for fewest ads; try fpaste.org or paste.kde.org as backups or (#3) If you're pasting config files, see !configs for grep syntax to remove comments or (#4) gist allows multiple files per paste, useful if you have several files to show
2016-09-28 20:00:25	@krzee	!learn paste as paste.ee is also nice

2016-09-28 20:01:30	@krzee	oh ok cool
2016-09-28 20:02:32	@krzee	may i make an unrelated suggestion?
2016-09-28 20:03:21	@krzee	i think it's always best to put redirect-gateway in the client configs instead of the server config, because then each client can choose for themselves
2016-09-28 20:03:31	@krzee	since you're currently your only client, doesnt matter
2016-09-28 20:03:40	dcarmich	I see.
2016-09-28 20:04:01	@krzee	https://paste.ee/p/0vjVx    <--- try that
2016-09-28 20:04:03	@krzee	same ping test
2016-09-28 20:07:10	dcarmich	Just doing it.. ping 10.8.0.1 works.

2016-09-29 01:40:51	Gaffel	And I've replied.
2016-09-29 01:41:01	Gaffel	You need a tool that creates certificates.
2016-09-29 01:41:09	Gaffel	OpenSSL has the tool for that.
2016-09-29 01:41:13	wallbroken	when you install openvpn, there are components list to be checked to install
2016-09-29 01:41:30	Gaffel	Okay, yes.
2016-09-29 01:41:36	wallbroken	one of thet is "OpenSSL utilities"
2016-09-29 01:41:43	wallbroken	is that i need to create certs?
2016-09-29 01:41:46	Gaffel	Yes
2016-09-29 01:41:53	Gaffel	You claimed that you question was clear, it wasn't.

2016-09-29 01:42:15	Gaffel	You never said that you were looking at the OpenVPN for Windows.
2016-09-29 01:42:27	Gaffel	So your claim that your question was clear is FALSE.
2016-09-29 01:42:36	Gaffel	No, easyrsa is not required but it makes it easier.
2016-09-29 01:43:53	wallbroken	Gaffel, so i need "openSSL utilities" on openvpn installation?
2016-09-29 01:44:11	Gaffel	I answered Yes.
2016-09-29 01:44:36	wallbroken	there are also "Openvpn rsa certificate management script", this is easyrsa?

2016-09-29 02:30:26	@dazo	okay, then you need proper SNI which OpenVPN cannot do
2016-09-29 02:31:22	wallbroken	ok, i solved with iptables -F FORWARD before rules
2016-09-29 02:31:33	wallbroken	i think you need to fix openvpn documentation

2016-09-29 02:48:03	BtbN	A /64 is quite excessive for OpenVPN though
2016-09-29 02:48:15	BtbN	it's not like you'll ever have a couple trillion of clients
2016-09-29 02:48:42	mexx	/128 ?
2016-09-29 02:49:11	BtbN	That'd leave you with exactly one client!
2016-09-29 02:49:23	mexx	:)
2016-09-29 02:49:31	BtbN	I usually use a /112
2016-09-29 02:49:41	BtbN	so 65k clients, still plenty
2016-09-29 02:49:41	mexx	I actually already have  server-ipv6 /64 in my conf
2016-09-29 02:50:09	BtbN	you also want a propper IPv6 firewall and forwarding, of course.
2016-09-29 02:50:34	mexx	and something like radvd ?
2016-09-29 02:50:38	BtbN	no
2016-09-29 02:50:53	BtbN	there is no layer2 with OpenVPN unless you use tap VPN, which is a bad idea in 99% of the cases.
2016-09-29 02:51:14	mexx	so how can I distribute addresses ?
2016-09-29 02:51:19	mexx	dhcpv6 ?

2016-09-29 02:56:09	BtbN	why wouldn't you?
2016-09-29 02:56:41	BtbN	you can just set the default route over the VPN, as you probably don't have a native connection.
2016-09-29 02:58:14	mexx	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_local_address, says "They are not routable in the global IPv6 Internet"

2016-09-29 03:02:42	@dazo	mexx: good ... then you need to ensure you have IPv6 forwarding enabled ... and that your firewall allows IPv6 traffic to pass from VPN to wherever

2016-09-29 03:07:23	@dazo	mexx: okay ... so you then need a separate /64 on your LAN which is then routed via the VPN /112 (or /64) subnet ... your LAN can use radvd to quickly get a stateless autoconfig setup running
2016-09-29 03:08:46	@dazo	(as I said: "the rest is tackled by normal TCP/IP routing")
2016-09-29 03:10:50	mexx	but then I can only go as far as the openvpn server ?

2016-09-29 03:15:01	mexx	but since there's no nat like mechanism, how do I route private addresses once I get on the vpn server ?
2016-09-29 03:15:24	BtbN	what private addresses?
2016-09-29 03:15:35	@dazo	why can you not use a /64 segment of your public pool?
2016-09-29 03:15:57	mexx	oh
2016-09-29 03:16:04	@dazo	you just declare for yourself that *this* /64 belongs to the LAN behind your VPN client

2016-09-29 11:36:35	@dazo	ahh, right
2016-09-29 11:36:38	Gaffel	Set policy to DROP
2016-09-29 11:36:54	Gaffel	Then that generic established/related acceptance.
2016-09-29 11:37:04	Gaffel	Then you put strict rules below that.
2016-09-29 11:37:12	wallbroken	-A FORWARD -s 10.0.0.0/24 -i tun0 -j ACCEPT
2016-09-29 11:37:18	wallbroken	-A FORWARD -o tun0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
2016-09-29 11:37:26	wallbroken	that's an old deprecated way?
2016-09-29 11:37:31	@dazo	yes
2016-09-29 11:38:06	@dazo	 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW   //    -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED
2016-09-29 11:38:17	@dazo	that's what you need
2016-09-29 11:38:31	Gaffel	-A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
2016-09-29 11:38:41	wallbroken	yes, even if i just tried both the way, and both are working
2016-09-29 11:38:51	Gaffel	Yup
2016-09-29 11:39:04	Gaffel	It will break too much if it's removed completely.
2016-09-29 11:39:17	Gaffel	iptables is planned to be deprecated as a whole anyway, so no rush.
2016-09-29 11:39:29	@danhunsaker	But the conntrack module is not only loads better than the state module, it'll also still be around in a few versions.
2016-09-29 11:39:49	@danhunsaker	I.E., when iptables itself evaporates.
2016-09-29 11:40:03	Gaffel	The successor, nftables, uses conntrack.
2016-09-29 11:40:13	@dazo	yupp
2016-09-29 11:40:14	wallbroken	another thing: i enabled a static routing rule over the router, instead of using nat
2016-09-29 11:40:16	@danhunsaker	Indeed.
2016-09-29 11:40:21	wallbroken	it's good than nat?

2016-09-29 11:40:28	Gaffel	I prefer nftables.

2016-09-29 11:40:49	Gaffel	Routing is better.
2016-09-29 11:40:54	@dazo	wallbroken: NAT is a pure hack to avoid depletion of IPv4 addresses during the 1990s
2016-09-29 11:41:15	wallbroken	i said the router: when you get packet with destination network 10.0.0.0, forward them to: 192.168.1.100 (which is openvpn server into the lan)
2016-09-29 11:41:15		[11:41]
2016-09-29 11:41:35	wallbroken	router is the default gateway
2016-09-29 11:41:59	wallbroken	so, when an host doesn't know anything about a NET, it will forward to default GW
2016-09-29 11:42:08	@dazo	correct
2016-09-29 11:42:17	@dazo	!tcpip
2016-09-29 11:42:18	@vpnHelper	"tcpip" is http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/gg243376.pdf See chapter 3.1 for useful basic TCP/IP networking knowledge you should probably know
2016-09-29 11:42:32	wallbroken	dazo, i studied it at university
2016-09-29 11:43:00	@dazo	wallbroken: so did my wife, I stopped after 6 months ... but I know networking, she doesn't
2016-09-29 11:43:04	Gaffel	Then you'll become familiar with iptables really quick.
2016-09-29 11:43:10	@dazo	lol
2016-09-29 11:44:35	@dazo	Gaffel: which distro have you installed nftables on?
2016-09-29 11:44:35	wallbroken	and i do know what NAT does, it's changing source and destination address to make multiplation of  local IP streams over a single public IP
2016-09-29 11:44:48	Gaffel	dazo, nothing by default as far as I know.
2016-09-29 11:44:57	wallbroken	but as far i know, nat will be destroyed when ipv6 will come up
2016-09-29 11:45:18	@dazo	Gaffel: compiled yourself and installed?  which distro are you on?
2016-09-29 11:45:19	Gaffel	It's non-existant in CentOS (but vailible from the elep-release repo, but broken)
2016-09-29 11:45:26	Gaffel	I use Arch
2016-09-29 11:45:40	wallbroken	dazo, iptables works also with ipv6?
2016-09-29 11:45:48	Gaffel	No, but ip6tables
2016-09-29 11:46:28	wallbroken	so, i don't need to learn something will be no more useful in a couple of time?
2016-09-29 11:46:42	@dazo	wallbroken: there are NAT66 and NAT64 ..... but there's a lot of NAT66 controversies .... NAT64 can be quite useful to access IPv4 nets over a pure IPv6 net - but quite a job to configure correctly (need DNS64 too)
2016-09-29 11:47:13	Gaffel	Once you need to switch to nftables, you'll learn it really quick. It's more readable.
2016-09-29 11:47:30	wallbroken	dazo, IP has something called "PROTO 41" which allows to encapsulate ipv6 frame over an ipv4
2016-09-29 11:47:31	@dazo	the concept is basically the same between iptables and ip6tables ... the biggest challenge is that while IPv4 have ARP, IPv6 depends on ICMPv6 packets to do the same - which can be firewalled
2016-09-29 11:48:12	@dazo	wallbroken: the IPv6 encapsulation is something different again
2016-09-29 11:48:36	@dazo	protocol 41 *is* the IPv6 protocol
2016-09-29 11:49:05	wallbroken	protocol 41 is not the way to make "ipv6 tunnels" ?

2016-09-29 13:03:07	@krzie	its all up to your os, openvpn just sets the routing table to route you over the vpn
2016-09-29 13:03:28	@krzie	if you set the rule, you can set it to log and answer your own question
2016-09-29 13:03:37	@krzie	if it blocks stuff, see what it blocked ;]
2016-09-29 13:04:57	wknapik	with the routes and a proper resolv.conf i'm safe. so what i'm asking is - other than an intentional explicit shutdown - what could cause those routes to be removed / resolv.conf to be reverted, even for a moment ?
2016-09-29 13:05:06	zoredache	It is a more complex setup but when I am paranoid, I remove all routes other then those provided by the VPN, and a static route for the VPN server.  And when I am really paranoid, I stand up a VM and do my browsing within the VM within the VM, and then firewall things so the VM can only communicate with the VPN server.
2016-09-29 13:05:47	@krzie	the routes wont get removed while the tunnel is up, but maybe something sends out the old route for some reason, established connection or something... all i know is the proper answer to your question is use a firewall if you care.

2016-09-29 13:07:37	wknapik	krzee if i use an up/down script to set the firewall rules, can the "down" execution happen without me killing openvpn intentionally ?

2016-09-29 13:09:21	@krzee	depends on your settings, but assuming you have keepalives and retries and stuff, it shouldnt die without being asked to

2016-09-29 13:19:14	wallbroken	no
2016-09-29 13:19:15	@krzee	!commonsubnet
2016-09-29 13:19:18	@krzee	!subnet
2016-09-29 13:19:19	@vpnHelper	"subnet" is (#1) http://www.subnet-calculator.com/ or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork, or (#2) Want a random subnet generator? See: !randomsubnet, or (#3) You may be looking for !toplogy
2016-09-29 13:19:33	wallbroken	10.0.0.1 host have 2 interfaces
2016-09-29 13:19:43	wallbroken	tun0 which has 10.0.0.0/24
2016-09-29 13:19:58	wallbroken	and eth0 which has 192.168.1.0/24
2016-09-29 13:19:59	wallbroken	ok?
2016-09-29 13:20:10	@krzee	whats the eth0 ip?
2016-09-29 13:20:20	wallbroken	192.168.1.8
2016-09-29 13:20:28	@krzee	ok, so what is 192.168.1.1?
2016-09-29 13:20:37	wallbroken	192.168.1.1 is another host of the lan
2016-09-29 13:20:46	@krzee	is it the default gateway for the lan?
2016-09-29 13:20:46	wallbroken	it doesn't know anything about openvpn
2016-09-29 13:21:00	wallbroken	yes
2016-09-29 13:21:06	@krzee	you need to add a route to it for all subnets it doesnt know about but should
2016-09-29 13:21:10	@krzee	so the vpn subnet for sure
2016-09-29 13:21:23	@krzee	and if you have any lans behind clients that you want routing to, you need routes for those too
2016-09-29 13:21:27	@krzee	!route_outside_ovpn
2016-09-29 13:21:28	@vpnHelper	"route_outside_ovpn" is "route_outside_openvpn" is (#1) If your server is not the default gateway for the LAN, you will need to add routes to your gateway. See ROUTES TO ADD OUTSIDE OPENVPN in !route or (#2) Here are 2 diagrams that explain how this works: http://www.secure-computing.net/wiki/index.php/Graph http://i.imgur.com/BM9r1.png
2016-09-29 13:21:37	wallbroken	krzee, i did it
2016-09-29 13:21:44	wallbroken	i added a static route on the router
2016-09-29 13:21:55	@krzee	ok, so you probably didnt do this:
2016-09-29 13:21:56	@krzee	oops
2016-09-29 13:22:07	@krzee	<wallbroken> it doesn't know anything about openvpn
2016-09-29 13:22:46	wallbroken	wait i'm trying to reconstruct the trace of the packet
2016-09-29 13:23:05	@krzee	at every hop, find the next hop by looking in the routing table
2016-09-29 13:23:13	@krzee	most specific route wins
2016-09-29 13:23:13		[13:23]
2016-09-29 13:23:23	@krzee	if theres nothing specific, it goes to default
2016-09-29 13:23:26	wallbroken	once the packet arrives to host which hosts openvpn server, it said: this packet has 10.0.0.2 as source, 192.168.1.1 as destination
2016-09-29 13:23:27	wallbroken	ok?
2016-09-29 13:23:41	@krzee	huh?
2016-09-29 13:23:49	@krzee	no it doesnt change src / dst
2016-09-29 13:23:56	@krzee	unless you are NATing, which you shouldnt be
2016-09-29 13:23:59	wallbroken	the host said: ok, i know 192.168.1.0/24 in my routing table

2016-09-29 13:28:38	zoredache	wknapik: Because openvpn is a generic vpn creation tool, and isn't focused purely on the personal privacy aspects.

2016-09-29 13:29:36	wknapik	zoredache no, that argument doesn't work. there's functionality *in* openvpn itself to prevent dns leaks, so the problem has been acknowledged as relevant to the project.
2016-09-29 13:30:49	zoredache	There is functionality to prevent dns leaks?  Or is there is functionality to update client DNS settings as required by some configurations that might include privacy.

2016-09-29 13:36:56	@danhunsaker	wknapik: OpenVPN is designed to provide o secure connection.  Most of the mechanisms for securing the endpoints are outside its control, because most of them are in the firewall.  There are certainly things it can simplify, but it's not designed for privacy - it's designed for a secure connection over insecure networks.
2016-09-29 13:36:58	zoredache	wknapik: ah, that is a new feature apparently released in the last year.  It hasn't tricked down into packaged version
2016-09-29 13:38:14	@danhunsaker	The DNS leak protection feature is actually meant to ensure users get DNS results that will connect over that secure connection, not for privacy purposes.

2016-09-29 13:41:21	wknapik	danhunsaker not designed for privacy ? can't agree, but anyway, the demand is there, even more so these days. all i'm asking for is a wiki page with a PoC. based on up/down scripts or something, whatever... anything not vpn-provider-specific.
2016-09-29 13:41:47	@danhunsaker	Feel free to write one.  :)
2016-09-29 13:42:00	wknapik	i might
2016-09-29 13:42:07	wknapik	just started with all this today
2016-09-29 13:42:25	@danhunsaker	That said, whether you agree or not is beside the point.  We as a company aren't building a privacy tool.
2016-09-29 13:42:52	@danhunsaker	That it can be used as part of a suite of tools for improving privacy is great, but it's not our purpose.
2016-09-29 13:43:09	wknapik	danhunsaker that's something to reconsider. all my friends, people who have never thought of using a vpn, do it today, for the privacy benefits
2016-09-29 13:43:21	wknapik	danhunsaker that's a huge chunk of the market
2016-09-29 13:43:53	@danhunsaker	Perhaps.  Would you purchase our commercial offering if we added more priavcy controls to it?
2016-09-29 13:44:23	@danhunsaker	Your perception of "the market" isn't the same as our target audience.
2016-09-29 13:44:30	wknapik	i don't even know what your commercial offerings are today. i based my choice of provider on the privacy features offered.

2016-09-29 13:45:48	wknapik	yep

2016-09-29 13:46:34	@danhunsaker	(And even that's an oversimplification.)
2016-09-29 13:46:57	zoredache	wknapik: What you are asking for is also a far more complex problem.  Being certain that every potential supported OS and application that might use a VPN doesn't screw up and leak can be very challenging.  Can  you be certain something in your browser hasn't figured out your IP at some point before the vpn was established and saved in a cookie for sharing later?
2016-09-29 13:47:27	wknapik	zoredache that's another level and truely out of scope
2016-09-29 13:47:41	@danhunsaker	The point is that it's *all* out of scope.
2016-09-29 13:48:08	@danhunsaker	OpenVPN provides the secure link between networks and computers.  Other tools provide the other aspects.
2016-09-29 13:48:13	wknapik	danhunsaker that's why i'm asking for 20 lines of text on a wiki page, not a feature

2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[23:49:19] 17:43:10 <wknapik> danhunsaker that's something to reconsider. all my friends, people who have never thought of using a vpn, do it today, for the privacy benefits [23:49:19]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	wknapik	[23:49:23] i don't care if you choose to cater to those looking to improve their privacy. i'm just saying many vpn users are looking for exactly that. [23:49:23]

2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[06:59:19] Hamy: MRU? [06:59:19]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Hamy	[07:00:25] danhunsaker: maximum receiving unit. the maximum packet size that can be received on a link [07:00:25]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[07:04:14] Ah, right, of course.  Nearly bed time. [07:04:14]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Hamy	[07:04:36] :) [07:04:36]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[07:06:23] It *should* be negotiating an MTU that fits the MTU *and* MRU of the entire link (that is, the smallest value of every hop), for the given direction.  Of course, if you want it to adjust one, it makes sense to set both sides to the same value, because they're usually the same both directions. [07:06:23]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[07:06:57] Pretty unusual to have an MTU and an MRU on a single device with different values... [07:06:57]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[07:08:04] Possible, I guess, but I'm not sure what benefit it would provide. [07:08:04]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Hamy	[07:16:16] i agree that it's not usual. but i am on one right now. my MTU is 1480 while my MRU is 1492 . if on this link, i specify 'fragment' , with the value of 1452(1480-28), it works just fine. however, if i also specify mssfix of 1452, it adjusts both MSS values of receiving AND sending SYN packets. which in turn makes it not possible to utilize my MRU completely [07:16:16]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Hamy	[07:16:56] i admit that this is a little complex. but it makes sense, doesn't it? [07:16:56]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[07:35:42] There are still the other hops to consider.  Their MTU and MRU values aren't likely to match your own. [07:35:42]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[07:36:51] On the other hand, you're setting these values manually. [07:36:51]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[07:38:21] I wonder what causes your link to have asymmetric message unit sizes... [07:38:21]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[07:44:26] I wonder this because it's possible there's a problem with the underlying interface, either in the software layer (driver/kernel) or the hardware. [07:44:26]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Hamy	[07:46:50] sure, there are other hops. and i have tested the maximum transferable packet size between them before trying to adjust the values. the difference between my MTU/MRU, i believe, is set by my provider. i have observed the pppoe negotiation and it actively pushes the MRU value [07:46:50]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Hamy	[07:49:27] while silently rejecting any packet more than 1480 bytes, it happily sends up to 1492 packet size back to me even when DF flag is set [07:49:27]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[07:52:44] So the issue, then, is with the PPPoE provider.  Gotcha.  PPP is ... dated.  So that's less surprising that it should be. [07:52:44]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[07:56:20] Alas, I'm not aware of any workarounds besides living with it.  Unless you haven't already tried an --mssfix at 1464 and mtu at 1452... [07:56:20]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Hamy	[07:56:30] yes. i believe so. well, its not really an issue by itself if you're not picky enough about not utilizing th extra 12 bytes [07:56:30]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Hamy	[07:57:41] i *think* there should be another workaround. setting the right MSS values by netfilter and not relying on openvpn. though i have to consider the encryption overhead [07:57:41]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Hamy	[07:58:04] it would have been easier if i could adjust it within openvpn though [07:58:04]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[07:58:14] 12 bytes isn't much by itself, but 12/packet can make a big difference in speed with packets/second values also taken into account. [07:58:14]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Hamy	[07:58:34] exactly [07:58:34]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[07:58:38] Well, yes.  I meant workarounds *within* OpenVPN. [07:58:38]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Hamy	[07:59:07] thanks for the help :) [07:59:07]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[07:59:37] But if --mssfix applies to both directions, while fragment only applies to one, maybe you can set --mssfix to the higher value? [07:59:37]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[08:00:20] (I generally see an option talked about that has MTU in its same, so you might eyeball that, too...) [08:00:20]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[08:00:33] *its name [08:00:33]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Hamy	[08:01:13] yes, it works. i could even completly disable mssfix, by providing the value of 0. however, as the manual points out, it would be more efficient to do it at the IP level than relying only on 'fragment' [08:01:13]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Hamy	[08:04:06] i *think* you mean link-mtu and tun-mtu . frankly, i couldn't make them work correctly. not quite sure why [08:04:06]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[08:37:04] Those are the ones, yeah. [08:37:04]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Hamy	[08:40:08] i'll give them another try. maybe this time i could figure out why they didn't work. thanks for the help. i appreciate it :) [08:40:08]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[08:40:28] At any rate, without dropping down to other tools, those are the only options I'm aware of. Other tools will almost always be more efficient for things the kernel controls, through. [08:40:28]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[08:40:50] Of course.  :-) [08:40:50]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	@danhunsaker	[08:40:57] *though [08:40:57]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Hamy	[08:42:31] i'll keep that in mind. thanks [08:42:31]

2016-09-30 03:44:32	@dazo	hmmm ... okay, this might be more tricky ... when systemd starts a unit file and don't have tty access (which sudo most likely removes in this use case), it expects username/passwords to be passed via the systemd-tty-ask-password-agent
2016-09-30 03:45:31	@dazo	that agent mostly have to be kicked off manually, and needs the same privileges as when systemctl was used
2016-09-30 03:46:23	@dazo	*when* systemctl have access to the tty ... it kicks off that agent automatically
2016-09-30 03:48:03	scottder	Ahhh ok, I see now. Hrrmmm that does complicate things
2016-09-30 03:48:15	scottder	Thanks dazo
2016-09-30 03:49:11	scottder	I was so focused on the openvpn side I hadn't thought of this
2016-09-30 03:49:22	@dazo	scottder: it might be possible to enable a controlling tty via sudo, check out the sudoers config .... or consider to use pkexec (policy kit execute), which have even better security controls than sudo

2016-09-30 04:40:11	wknapik	EHLO
2016-09-30 04:41:02	wknapik	is there a way to get the automatic route setup via --redirect-gateway, but skip the automatic removal on tunnel tear down ?
2016-09-30 04:42:04	wknapik	i know i could set up routes manually (skip --redirect-gateway entirely) and keep them around, but that's reimplementing existing openvpn functionality for no benefit...
2016-09-30 04:44:53	XSalsaTequila	why would you keep the routes while the tun doesn't exist
2016-09-30 04:46:26	wknapik	to prevent ip leaks until the user explicitly says that's what they want. a failsafe. i tried using mktun thinking the existence of the device would be enough to prevent route removal, but that doesn't seem to work...

2016-09-30 04:48:12	wknapik	so the idea is that if the user starts up the vpn, all traffic goes through it, no matter what (timeouts, processes being killed, etc.), until the user says "ok, now i want to go back to the previous state"
2016-09-30 04:48:30	egonsen	hi. when i connect to an open vpn server via tcp/ip, are the tcp checks and handshakes always done twice? once for the "outer" ip packet and once for the inner one?

2016-09-30 05:47:21	jchiu	I have a point to point set up between AWS and my DC. My issue is that sometimes I lose momentary connectivity when the client does a TLS soft reset. This does not seem to happen on a regular basis. I have already up'ed my tran-window, but that doesn't seem to have helped. Almost everything else is default from the example configs. Any advice on ways to keep the connection a little more stable?

2016-09-30 10:14:51	ducktape	and yes I know its not recommended to use tap but the Netgear router only support tap for non-mobile devices
2016-09-30 10:15:34	@danhunsaker	Interesting that it thinks there's a meaningful difference.
2016-09-30 10:16:40	ducktape	beats me, but if i enable tun based server, I cannot connect via OS X/Windoze clients using a tun device
2016-09-30 10:17:11	@danhunsaker	My guess is poorly made client configs on the router's part.
2016-09-30 10:17:26	ducktape	and Netgear support forced me to use tap and I can connect from OS X and windoze clients
2016-09-30 10:17:33	ducktape	but linux clients all fail
2016-09-30 10:17:46	ducktape	danhunsaker, agreed
2016-09-30 10:18:01	@danhunsaker	Because Netgear doesn't actually know what they're doing...  *sigh*
2016-09-30 10:18:31	ducktape	I was going to re flash the netgear with a more open router firmware but that will open up other cans of worms I am sure
2016-09-30 10:19:10	@danhunsaker	Depends on the firmware.  Some would actually be *more* secure.
2016-09-30 10:19:32	@danhunsaker	I wonder how well pfSense would handle a Netgear device...
2016-09-30 10:19:38	ducktape	but since this setup is working with OS X & windows clients i am wondering if this something linux client specific that i can tweak in the linux client config file
2016-09-30 10:20:48	ducktape	coz on FC23/centos 7 i had to "export OPENSSL_ENABLE_MD5_VERIFY=1; export NSS_HASH_ALG_SUPPORT=+MD5"

2016-09-30 10:43:18	@danhunsaker	But I'd guess it's wired to hand out 12974 to Mac/Win configs, regardless of the server settings.

2016-10-01 14:06:34	@krzee	[20:53:25] well i had a user in here where viscosity was his problem [20:53:25]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	@krzee	[20:53:33] just the other night [20:53:33]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	@krzee	[20:53:46] switching to tunnelblick fixed everything [20:53:46]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	@krzee	[20:54:08] netgear may not be to blame, maybe his setup on osx is [20:54:08]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	ducktape	[20:55:48] krzee, if I use tun from OS X /windows it does not work [20:55:48]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	ducktape	[20:56:27] krzee, and now with tap OS X, windows works fine but  linux does not [20:56:27]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	ducktape	[20:56:48] krzee, I am using tunnelblick on OS X [20:56:48]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	@krzee	[20:56:55] when in tun grab me verb 5 logs from both sides [20:56:55]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	ducktape	[20:57:37] krzee, my problem is I cannot get logs from Netgear [20:57:37]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	@krzee	[20:57:50] cant get logs!? [20:57:50]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	ducktape	[20:57:55] I can give you log from the client side with tun and on OS X [20:57:55]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	@krzee	[20:59:05] probably not enough, but ill take a verb 5 linux client log with both sides on tun [20:59:05]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	ducktape	[20:59:08] krzee, the Netgear 6900 does not expose the VPN logs [20:59:08]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	@krzee	[20:59:19] that's horrible, get openwrt :-p [20:59:19]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	ducktape	[21:00:02] I am going to on the R8000 but R6900 does not have a alternate firmware, i don't think [21:00:02]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	@krzee	[21:00:34] even if you get it working, do you want a server where you cant see your logs? [21:00:34]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	@krzee	[21:00:43] personally i wouldnt want that even if i got it working [21:00:43]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	ducktape	[21:03:11] krzee, agreed, I am going to figure out an alternative [21:03:11]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	wallbroken	[00:52:25] danhunsaker, you were the first one banned me since two year i join here [00:52:25]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	@danhunsaker	[02:09:29] wallbroken: Less drastic measures hadn't been effective. I hoped a day away would help provide perspective. [02:09:29]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	XATRIX	[06:20:38] HI guys, i've made an OVPN connecting between my mobile device and my server, but i can't ping my private address 10.8.0.6 from my server , any idea ? [06:20:38]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	XATRIX	[06:20:58] I have connection esablished on my logs [06:20:58]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	XATRIX	[06:21:16] also, i disabled firewall as for now [06:21:16]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	XATRIX	[06:21:31] So, nothing should be blocking ICMP [06:21:31]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	XATRIX	[06:27:09] Ok, i can ping 10.8.0.1 (my VPN host) from my client, but i can't do it vice vers [06:27:09]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	XATRIX	[06:45:49] fixed it [06:45:49]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	Fr3DBr_w_q	[13:19:12] How can I set the tun/tap network interface in windows, as default route for the whole network traffic, while keeping the regular ethernet interface default gateway there as well ? [13:19:12]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	monsterco	[13:22:50] Hi everyone; everytime my Windows 2012 server restart and I try to run Openvpn it complains that the network card is not available so I have to disable the network card and then re-enable it [13:22:50]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	monsterco	[13:23:03] and then press Connect on openvpn; how can i prevent this? [13:23:03]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	monsterco	[13:35:06] anyone? [13:35:06]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	ChrisWarrick	[17:43:47] How do I edit a config file on Android? [17:43:47]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	@danhunsaker	[17:45:27] Any text editor will do. [17:45:27]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	ChrisWarrick	[17:45:42] The question was more like “where do I find the file” [17:45:42]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	ChrisWarrick	[17:45:45] and the answer is /data/data/net.openvpn.openvpn/files [17:45:45]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	@danhunsaker	[17:47:10] That much depends on which OpenVPN client you're using. [17:47:10]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	monsterco	[18:10:04] how can I run openvpn at Windows startup and have it connect automatically as well? is it possible? [18:10:04]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	ChrisWarrick	[18:25:49] On Android using OpenVPN Connect, my traffic still is not routed through the VPN. How do I fix that? [18:25:49]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	ChrisWarrick	[18:28:24] push "redirect-gateway def1" [18:28:24]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	ChrisWarrick	[18:29:19] So, just got rid of PPTP VPN for good. Much nicer. [18:29:19]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	ChrisWarrick	[18:29:37] And it actually works, unlike IPSec/L2TP. [18:29:37]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	ratatine	[18:44:02] Anyone know if there is a parameter in the config that will log failed logins when using pam modules? Right now it seems that openvpn will only log successful usernames. Otherwise it just logs IP addresses with the same message as connections that do not attempt to authenticate. [18:44:02]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	ratatine	[18:46:01] I've tried upping verb but that didn't seem to help. [18:46:01]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	ratatine	[19:04:51] It looks like the code doesn't include it. I just made a patch that changes the log message. In src/openvpn/ssl_verify.c line 1200, the log message only says "TLS Auth Error: Auth Username/Password verification failed for peer". [19:04:51]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	@danhunsaker	[19:08:43] ratatine: That's generally handled in PAM itself... [19:08:43]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	@danhunsaker	[19:09:15] That said, you might consider a PR. [19:09:15]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	sunrunner20	[19:19:14] any openvpn driver developer's in the channel? [19:19:14]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	sunrunner20	[19:19:46] I need to know if theres anything that should be different between a openVPN connection inside a VM and an openVPn connection on a physical host [19:19:46]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	sunrunner20	[19:19:56] at the driver level [19:19:56]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	sunrunner20	[19:20:35] I have a torrent client + VPN provider combo that works fine on my win10 desktop [19:20:35]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	sunrunner20	[19:21:25] but as soon as I load a torrent, say xubuntu 14.10.x, my pings to google go from 70ms to 500-2000ms-timeout [19:21:25]

2016-10-02 13:17:58	dyce	danhunsaker: or a NAT can be setup for clients of Site B (remote) to avoid setting routes?
2016-10-02 13:18:40	@danhunsaker	You'll probably want some NAT, too, but the local server still needs to know where to send the packets.
2016-10-02 13:20:02	@danhunsaker	(Routes are way less overhead than firewall rules; if you can use a route to accomplish something, that's vastly preferred.)
2016-10-02 13:20:29	dyce	i see so a traceroute works from clients of the remote router to local router. ping doesn't because local route sees an IP from something that isn't 192.168.1.0/24 and doesn't know where to send the packet?
2016-10-02 13:20:40	dyce	local router*
2016-10-02 13:20:50	@danhunsaker	Indeed so.
2016-10-02 13:21:07	@danhunsaker	That's the whole point of routes - telling routers (or servers, or whatever) where to send packtes.

2016-10-03 05:19:36	@danhunsaker	[23:21:07] That's the whole point of routes - telling routers (or servers, or whatever) where to send packtes. [23:21:07]

When the vm successfully connects I am no longer able to ping/access the vm from a client on a different subnet 10.0.0.0/24. Is there a way to allow such connections? I have tried iptables/ufw but nothing works. Dont know if that matters but when the vm connects it has a 10.3.1.x ip address

2016-10-03 07:58:39	wknapik	weirdly, all the routes (except the one to my --remote) do get removed before openvpn exits, despite multiple "operataion not permitted" error messages...

When the vm successfully connects I am no longer able to ping/access the vm from a client on a different subnet 10.0.0.0/24. Is there a way to allow such connections? I have tried iptables/ufw but nothing works. Dont know if that matters but when the vm connects it has a 10.3.1.x ip address

2016-10-03 21:40:42	bjoernv	I have an interesting problem with OpenVPN 2.3.12 on Linux:
2016-10-03 21:43:10	bjoernv	the remote OpenVPN server should be resolved with DNS. The DNS server itself is in VPN and can only be accessed within VPN. The initial connection works. But reconnection hangs forever, because the OpenVPN client can not resolve the Remote DNS address again. Currently I use the following work-arounds: 1) IP address instead of DNS name; 2) avoid "persist-tun": this restores the original DNS entries in /etc/resolv.conf
2016-10-03 21:43:18	bjoernv	are there better solutions?

2016-10-04 06:36:10	@dazo	then grab the openvpn git tree and try building that (it is fairly simple to build, and produces a single openvpn binary which can overwrite the already installed openvpn binary)

2016-10-04 06:41:11	kot2	okay, thanks
2016-10-04 06:42:49	@dazo	kot2: if I'm not mistaken, both F-Secure Freedome and the Astaro (Sophos?) UFW products already use much of the git versions in their production/products ... and I know "OpenVPN for Android" have used the git version for a very long time too
2016-10-04 06:43:23	kot2	the problem is in end users who don't have access to master
2016-10-04 06:43:36	kot2	I cant update the server but not the clietns

2016-10-04 06:44:37	@dazo	Actually, with 2.4/git master you can update the server quite fine ... and when you start rolling out clients they will negotiate ciphers to a AES-GCM cipher for the data channel
2016-10-04 06:45:27	@dazo	2.3 and older clients will use the cipher as defined in the client config
2016-10-04 06:45:27	kot2	*I can update the server but not the clients
2016-10-04 06:46:12	kot2	alright, thanks for help

2016-10-04 06:50:04	@dazo	!logs
2016-10-04 06:50:05	@vpnHelper	"logs" is (#1) please pastebin your logfiles from both client and server with verb set to 4 (only use 5 if asked), or (#2) In the Windows client(OpenVPN-GUI) right-click the status icon and pick View Log, or (#3) In the OS X client(Tunnelblick) right-click it and select Copy log text to clipboard, or (#4) if you dont know how to find your logs, see !logfile

2016-10-04 06:50:53	EricaJoy	Hi! I would like to run 'easy-rsa/build-key' as a user other than root, but that has root privs. Is that possible?
2016-10-04 06:52:00	@dazo	EricaJoy: yes .... as root run: chown -Rc $UID: easy-rsa/*   (be careful with that one!!!) ... Replace $UID with the username you prefer
2016-10-04 06:52:24	EricaJoy	bangorang, thanks dazo!
2016-10-04 06:52:37	@dazo	EricaJoy: but!  the easy-rsa files should ideally be stored on an media which is offline most of the time, only to be activated when you want to issue new certificates
2016-10-04 06:53:57	@dazo	and these files should NEVER be stored on an openvpn server ... the server only needs ca.crt, server.key, server.crt and dh*.pem
2016-10-04 06:54:12	@dazo	plus the config file, naturally
2016-10-04 06:55:20	ExoUNX	is easy-rssa openssl alternative when it comes to generation ?
2016-10-04 06:56:02	@dazo	ExoUNX: easy-rsa is a set of scripts simplifying the openssl operations .... easy-rsa uses openssl under the hood
2016-10-04 06:56:22	ExoUNX	durra, I'
2016-10-04 06:56:38	ExoUNX	durr, I forgot, I should have realized that
2016-10-04 06:56:59	ExoUNX	even though it's pretty easy with OpenSSL already, wonder what the need is for EasyRSA
2016-10-04 06:57:43	@dazo	it's not *that* easy with openssl, and with easy-rsa3, things are getting even easier than with easy-rsa2
2016-10-04 06:58:41	@dazo	openssl requires to have an openssl.cnf prepared and quite some massive command line arguments to do both generation of CSRs and signing them
2016-10-04 06:59:05	ExoUNX	init-config is handy :P

2016-10-05 08:35:12	zoredache	you seem to have trying to have 'lab' but 'lab' isn't in your hosts file, and I doubt you have setup lab to resolve on your dns hosts.
2016-10-05 08:36:15	zoredache	Btw, I doubt your hostname file being broken has anything to do with openvpn.

2016-10-05 08:39:55	zoredache	Well disable the vpn.  Tix the hostname file, reboot and verify.  Once you have verified everything is working, connect again, see if it breaks.  Then figure out why your config is breaking things.
2016-10-05 08:40:30	zoredache	The open source openvpn client certainly wouldn't do that, unless you used some badly written `up` scripts.

2016-10-05 09:18:17	patcable	is there a way to update openvpn's server.conf without killing existing connections?
2016-10-05 09:18:46	patcable	can i sighup it?
2016-10-05 09:20:04	patcable	doesnt look like it based on the man page, but
2016-10-05 09:26:00		[09:20]
2016-10-05 09:27:52	zoredache	Don't think so. There might be some thing you could do if you enabled the management port.  What kind of config change are you hoping to make without restarting though?
2016-10-05 09:29:58	zoredache	One thing I kinda wish you could do, and it sure seems like you should be able to do without a restart is change the 'global' stuff that is pushed to the client.  You can change the ccd files live, so it sure seems like it should be possible to change the global stuff that is pushed also.

2016-10-05 23:51:50	cyyber	hello
2016-10-05 23:52:28	cyyber	I have made an open VPN server. Now I have connected one of the client with the server. I am able to access files of the client from my server and I am also able to ping client from my server.
2016-10-05 23:52:38	cyyber	But I am unable to access websever hosted in my client from server.
2016-10-05 23:52:47	cyyber	Can anyone help?
2016-10-05 23:56:46	cyyber	My Server OS is windows 2012 r2 and client OS is windows 7
2016-10-06 00:00:58	Smurphy	Windows is not a Server OS ;)
2016-10-06 00:01:28	Smurphy	Did you check the proxy-settings of your Windows Server, or the Antivirus policy/scaning behavior? They tend to prevent all kind of things under Windows.

2016-10-06 03:24:09	leonidas_o	Hello, I've used the build-key script from easy-rsa to create  the keys and certificates for a user. Now when looking at the client1.crt, I see there are some human readable information like "Signature Algorithm:" "Issuer", "Name", "Validity" etc. followed by the "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----"..."-----END CERTIFICATE---". So when I now create the single .ovpn conf file for each client, I would place the conf settings, the
2016-10-06 03:24:09	leonidas_o	<ca> part, the <tls-auth> part, the <cert> part and the <key> part into the one .ovpn file. My concerns are about the now human readable <cert> part. Should I strip all information provided by the client1.crt and just put the "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----" ... "-----END CERTIFICATE-----" part into the <cert> part of the clients .ovpn file, or can I leave the human readable stuff inside? Are there any concerns of not stripp
2016-10-06 03:24:09	leonidas_o	ing it out?

2016-10-06 03:36:11	leonidas_o	@plaisthos so there is no extra attacking vector or any breach possible if a client "looses" his .ovpn file? Of course I would revoke it, but examining the stolen .ovpn file, the attacker wouldn't have any extra benefit compared to a stripped out .ovpn?

2016-10-06 11:28:40	@danhunsaker	lion4407: Unless you're connecting to the VPN server from the router itself, there's no reason it would affect the router at all.  If you are connecting from the router itself, it *might* be tripping some internal "sanity checks" the router does, if you're using the VPN in ways the router wasn't designed to handle.  That said, the symptoms you're reporting
2016-10-06 11:28:40	@danhunsaker	are generally indicative more of a faulty/dying router than anything else.

2016-10-06 23:33:09	Smurphy	[19:47:35] Error message is: 1 TLS Error: TLS key negotiation failed to occur within 60 seconds (check your network connectivity) [19:47:35]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	Smurphy	[19:47:41] It has worked before??? [19:47:41]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	Smurphy	[19:48:10] Could it be that the update uses ciphers that the clients (Android 5.0) can't use? [19:48:10]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	@dazo	[19:58:33] Smurphy: most likely your phone cannot access your server ... that is the most common issue with that error [19:58:33]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	lion4407	[20:18:21] has anyone had an issue with using openvpn with a vpn and it causing your router to reboot? Its possible my router is rebooting for another reason and I have noticed it before rebooting but it seems to be happening more lately like once a day. [20:18:21]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	@danhunsaker	[21:28:40] lion4407: Unless you're connecting to the VPN server from the router itself, there's no reason it would affect the router at all.  If you are connecting from the router itself, it *might* be tripping some internal "sanity checks" the router does, if you're using the VPN in ways the router wasn't designed to handle.  That said, the symptoms you're reporting [21:28:40]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	@danhunsaker	[21:28:40] are generally indicative more of a faulty/dying router than anything else. [21:28:40]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	lion4407	[21:29:34] thanks for the reponse that does make sense [21:29:34]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	alex88	[01:31:54] Hi there, I'm trying to connect an android device to my home router which runs openvpn, on android I get "option 'route-gateway- must have at least 2 arguments" [01:31:54]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	alex88	[01:32:02] is it an error on the server or client config? [01:32:02]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	alex88	[01:32:19] searching online I find just https://community.netgear.com/t5/Nighthawk-WiFi-Routers/R7500v2-VPN-Not-Working-Properly/td-p/1138912 [01:32:19]

2016-10-06 23:33:09	retrojeff	[05:58:15] is openvpn still in active development ? [05:58:15]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	@danhunsaker	[06:31:43] retrojeff: Very much so, yes. [06:31:43]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	Smurphy	[07:18:41] @dazo: I see the error message on my server's openvpn log? So the phone can access it... [07:18:41]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	yzT	[08:30:52] how do I load the config file on Windows' client? [08:30:52]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	yzT	[08:31:22] there is no option on settings, and drag & drop doesn't work either [08:31:22]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	yzT	[08:44:01] nvm found it [08:44:01]

2016-10-07 04:42:55	Marcucci	[11:26:19] i have an openvpn server, but when i execute the command "load-stats" it shows nclients=0 but it have clients connected, anyone know why? [11:26:19]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	eoli3n	[12:10:31] Hi [12:10:31]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	eoli3n	[12:11:08] is it possible to make openvpn works with client certification (without manual authentication) without ta.key file ? [12:11:08]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	eoli3n	[12:11:12] the problem is [12:11:12]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	eoli3n	[12:11:40] i want to modify an existant openvpn srv, which auth without client certification, on ldap authentication [12:11:40]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	eoli3n	[12:11:54] i want to keep ldap authentication, but setup client.key for me [12:11:54]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	eoli3n	[12:12:22] so i ./build-key client1 [12:12:22]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	eoli3n	[12:12:56] then mv client1.key and client1.crt at the top level ,where ca.crt is [12:12:56]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	eoli3n	[12:13:53] srv use those option to make it works with ldap : http://sprunge.us/ZMEL [12:13:53]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	eoli3n	[12:14:37] can i let "client-cert-not-required" to make it work with ldap AND easy-rsa keys ? [12:14:37]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	eoli3n	[12:14:50] second problem is that, i have an error on the client [12:14:50]

2016-10-07 04:42:55	eoli3n	[12:22:11] so this isnt the problem [12:22:11]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	@plaisthos	[12:22:19] eoli3n: client and server need to have the same ta.key [12:22:19]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	eoli3n	[12:22:26] yep i just did it [12:22:26]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	eoli3n	[12:22:29] it dont works more [12:22:29]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	@plaisthos	[12:22:30] or both have no tls-auth [12:22:30]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	eoli3n	[12:25:31] i dont understand why srv is working with ldap authentication, and not with keys [12:25:31]

2016-10-07 04:42:55	MacGyver	[12:48:16] Aiui that's not possible in a single server instance. [12:48:16]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	MacGyver	[12:48:46] But! I may very well be wrong about that. [12:48:46]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	eoli3n	[12:53:34] no problem, we are only two users for now [12:53:34]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	eoli3n	[12:53:40] i will generate another key ^^ [12:53:40]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	eoli3n	[12:53:57] another question, i see that with openvpn linux client we need to use update-resolv-conf [12:53:57]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	eoli3n	[12:54:07] to let pushing DNS srv to client [12:54:07]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	eoli3n	[12:54:39] but when i connect to openvpn, i have a strange error : /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf: line 56: -x: command not found [12:54:39]

2016-10-07 05:39:26	Marcucci	[11:23:47] Hi [11:23:47]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	Marcucci	[11:26:19] i have an openvpn server, but when i execute the command "load-stats" it shows nclients=0 but it have clients connected, anyone know why? [11:26:19]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	eoli3n	[12:10:31] Hi [12:10:31]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	eoli3n	[12:11:08] is it possible to make openvpn works with client certification (without manual authentication) without ta.key file ? [12:11:08]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	eoli3n	[12:11:12] the problem is [12:11:12]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	eoli3n	[12:11:40] i want to modify an existant openvpn srv, which auth without client certification, on ldap authentication [12:11:40]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	eoli3n	[12:11:54] i want to keep ldap authentication, but setup client.key for me [12:11:54]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	eoli3n	[12:12:22] so i ./build-key client1 [12:12:22]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	eoli3n	[12:12:56] then mv client1.key and client1.crt at the top level ,where ca.crt is [12:12:56]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	eoli3n	[12:13:53] srv use those option to make it works with ldap : http://sprunge.us/ZMEL [12:13:53]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	eoli3n	[12:14:37] can i let "client-cert-not-required" to make it work with ldap AND easy-rsa keys ? [12:14:37]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	eoli3n	[12:14:50] second problem is that, i have an error on the client [12:14:50]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	eoli3n	[12:15:08] http://sprunge.us/QCVX [12:15:08]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	eoli3n	[12:15:30] i see in examples configurations that it needs "tls-auth ta.key 0" on srv and "tls-auth ta.key 1" on client [12:15:30]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	eoli3n	[12:15:36] but i dont find this file on the rev [12:15:36]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	eoli3n	[12:15:39] s/rev/srv [12:15:39]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	@plaisthos	[12:16:46] tls-auth is optional [12:16:46]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	@plaisthos	[12:17:33] !tls-auth [12:17:33]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	@vpnHelper	[12:17:34] "tls-auth" is "hmac" is (#1) The tls-auth directive adds an additional HMAC signature to all SSL/TLS handshake packets for integrity verification. Any UDP packet not bearing the correct HMAC signature can be dropped without further processing. The tls-auth HMAC signature provides an additional level of security above and beyond that provided by SSL/TLS., or (#2) openvpn --genkey --secret ta.key [12:17:34]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	@vpnHelper	[12:17:35] to make the tls static key , in configs: tls-auth ta.key # , 1 for client or 0 for server in the configs [12:17:35]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	eoli3n	[12:22:00] thx plaisthos [12:22:00]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	eoli3n	[12:22:11] so this isnt the problem [12:22:11]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	@plaisthos	[12:22:19] eoli3n: client and server need to have the same ta.key [12:22:19]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	eoli3n	[12:22:26] yep i just did it [12:22:26]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	eoli3n	[12:22:29] it dont works more [12:22:29]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	@plaisthos	[12:22:30] or both have no tls-auth [12:22:30]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	eoli3n	[12:25:31] i dont understand why srv is working with ldap authentication, and not with keys [12:25:31]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	eoli3n	[12:25:43] with theses erros : http://sprunge.us/QCVX [12:25:43]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	eoli3n	[12:27:37] server side i have : TLS Error: Auth Username/Password was not provided by peer [12:27:37]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	@plaisthos	[12:31:07] !client-user-auth [12:31:07]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	@plaisthos	[12:31:16] you need client-user-auth in your client config [12:31:16]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	@plaisthos	[12:31:23] err [12:31:23]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	@plaisthos	[12:31:24] no [12:31:24]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	@plaisthos	[12:31:56] eoli3n: you want the client to authenticate via certificates instead of username/password? [12:31:56]
2016-10-07 05:39:27	@plaisthos	[12:32:01] or what is your goal? [12:32:01]

2016-10-07 12:46:35	lion4407	sometimes I used IE for streaming because I think my adblock blocks the streaming or something in firefox interferes

2016-10-07 12:47:24	lion4407	oh okay

2016-10-07 12:47:41	lion4407	lol
2016-10-07 12:47:47	@danhunsaker	IE's a train wreck inside a burning building anyway.
2016-10-07 12:47:55	lion4407	lol
2016-10-07 12:48:30	@danhunsaker	Though, yes you could use IE in Arch - it comes with Wine.  It's essentially IE6, bit it's there.
2016-10-07 12:48:37	eolien	I3 died in W10
2016-10-07 12:48:40	@danhunsaker	*but
2016-10-07 12:48:45	eolien	huhuhu
2016-10-07 12:48:49	eolien	i will never touch this again
2016-10-07 12:48:51	lion4407	at first when i was uing streaming sites to watch football games and mma I thought wow a lot of these sites don't work. then I tried one in IE and it worked and I figured out it was something to do with firefox
2016-10-07 12:48:54	eolien	it burned my fingers
2016-10-07 12:49:13	eolien	lion4407: strange
2016-10-07 12:49:18	lion4407	yea it is
2016-10-07 12:49:26	@danhunsaker	Edge is a lot better, sure, but it's similar in a lot of respects, too...
2016-10-07 12:49:27	lion4407	i think it could be the adblock maybe not sure
2016-10-07 12:50:10	@danhunsaker	lion4407: Most likely those sites were designed for IE.  The IE/standards split was enough that sites made for IE didn't work elsewhere, and vice versa.
2016-10-07 12:50:29	lion4407	im kind of suprised some of these sites are allowed to stay open
2016-10-07 12:50:37	@danhunsaker	That was one of the reasons IE was such a dumpster fire.
2016-10-07 12:50:40	lion4407	i can watch espn, cnn ufc rofl
2016-10-07 12:50:52	eolien	thx for helping, lets porn huhuhu (joke, mr robot, but it's like porn)

2016-10-07 15:26:39	@vpnHelper	[22:41:09] Title: protocol - How does Tor route DNS requests? - Tor Stack Exchange (at tor.stackexchange.com) [22:41:09]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	lion4407	[22:41:23] otherwise your isp would see your tor traffic [22:41:23]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	lion4407	[22:41:34] tor resolves dns with the exit node [22:41:34]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	lion4407	[22:42:05] unless there is some sort of conflict with openvpn im not aware of [22:42:05]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	eolien	[22:42:26] yep i read my link, you're right [22:42:26]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	eolien	[22:42:35] "You have to remember, that Tor is a PROXY. Proxies act on behalf of another, and therefore, theoretically you would only need to "resolve" the address of the first node of the circuit.

2016-10-07 15:26:39	lion4407	[22:43:14] yes the vpn can see your connecting to tor and thats about it [22:43:14]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	eolien	[22:43:30] no pb with that [22:43:30]

2016-10-07 15:26:39	eolien	[22:43:53] but i like more my solution, not tor, and safe porn at home, even connected to work vpn [22:43:53]

2016-10-07 15:26:39	eolien	[22:45:26] if i query youpor.com instead of youporn.com, first DNS should not resolv and ask to the second one [22:45:26]

2016-10-07 21:33:48	ryonaloli	[04:59:55] i'd like to patch openvpn to combine the static key functionality with sharing the key over the control channel, so the static key gets updated each time a connection is established, and the final symmetric key is based off both the key shared through the control channel, and the static key.

2016-10-07 21:47:38	ilCyx86_64	So let's say you've given OpenVPN server the range 10.8.0.0/16. Here, openvpn takes 10.8.0.1 for itself. Why, on the client does it add a route such as: "10.8.0.1/32 via 10.8.1.5 dev tun0"? Where does the .1.5 come from?
2016-10-07 21:47:38	@danhunsaker	ryonaloli: That sounds like a great question to ask the guys in #openvpn-devel

2016-10-07 21:48:53	ilCyx86_64	danhunsaker: 10.8.1.6, in this case
2016-10-07 21:50:24	@danhunsaker	Hrm...  Good question...  I'd expect it to be .1.5...
2016-10-07 21:51:11	@danhunsaker	Of course, there are a number of things that could be going on to affect the routing this way.
2016-10-07 21:51:39	@danhunsaker	Only way to know for sure is to review your config and logs for both sides.

2016-10-08 11:37:44	lion4407	[22:48:51] at first when i was uing streaming sites to watch football games and mma I thought wow a lot of these sites don't work. then I tried one in IE and it worked and I figured out it was something to do with firefox [22:48:51]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	eolien	[22:48:54] it burned my fingers [22:48:54]

2016-10-08 11:37:44	@danhunsaker	[22:49:26] Edge is a lot better, sure, but it's similar in a lot of respects, too... [22:49:26]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	lion4407	[22:49:27] i think it could be the adblock maybe not sure [22:49:27]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	@danhunsaker	[22:50:10] lion4407: Most likely those sites were designed for IE.  The IE/standards split was enough that sites made for IE didn't work elsewhere, and vice versa. [22:50:10]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	lion4407	[22:50:29] im kind of suprised some of these sites are allowed to stay open [22:50:29]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	@danhunsaker	[22:50:37] That was one of the reasons IE was such a dumpster fire. [22:50:37]

2016-10-08 11:37:44	lion4407	[22:51:24] I route through a vpn for extra protection in case the FEDS decide to go after watchers lol [22:51:24]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	ryonaloli	[04:58:43] is there any one function in openvpn which sets the master shared symmetric key? i looked through the source a bit and found several functions for setting the key. [04:58:43]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	ryonaloli	[04:59:55] i'd like to patch openvpn to combine the static key functionality with sharing the key over the control channel, so the static key gets updated each time a connection is established, and the final symmetric key is based off both the key shared through the control channel, and the static key. [04:59:55]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	ilCyx86_64	[07:47:38] So let's say you've given OpenVPN server the range 10.8.0.0/16. Here, openvpn takes 10.8.0.1 for itself. Why, on the client does it add a route such as: "10.8.0.1/32 via 10.8.1.5 dev tun0"? Where does the .1.5 come from? [07:47:38]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	@danhunsaker	[07:47:38] ryonaloli: That sounds like a great question to ask the guys in #openvpn-devel [07:47:38]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	ryonaloli	[07:48:02] danhunsaker: thanks [07:48:02]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	@danhunsaker	[07:48:20] ilCyx86_64: What IP does the client get? [07:48:20]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	@danhunsaker	[07:48:30] ryonaloli: Of course. [07:48:30]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	ilCyx86_64	[07:48:53] danhunsaker: 10.8.1.6, in this case [07:48:53]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	@danhunsaker	[07:50:24] Hrm...  Good question...  I'd expect it to be .1.5... [07:50:24]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	@danhunsaker	[07:51:11] Of course, there are a number of things that could be going on to affect the routing this way. [07:51:11]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	@danhunsaker	[07:51:39] Only way to know for sure is to review your config and logs for both sides. [07:51:39]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	@danhunsaker	[07:51:51] *configs [07:51:51]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	ilCyx86_64	[07:52:45] Server config doesn't have anything extra on it. It seems every time I connect, it adds a route to the server's address via the address with the last octet one below mine [07:52:45]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	hayenne	[08:26:56] Hi guys... probably a common question - is there a way to connect on login / reconnect automatically on Mac OS? [08:26:56]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	hayenne	[08:27:13] there is only a Windows guide on the website [08:27:13]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	speciality	[08:27:42] Hey hayenne are you using a service? [08:27:42]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	hayenne	[08:28:05] I am using the OpenVPN client [08:28:05]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	wingnut	[13:52:07] Hi .. I am trying to use --engine aesni .. I added engine aesni to my config file and started it and it loaded finbe but in the log i find 'engine = DISABLED' can anybody explain ? [13:52:07]

2016-10-08 11:37:44	@vpnHelper	[15:05:13] "welcome" is (#1) Start by stating your !goal, such as 'I would like to access the internet over my vpn', or (#2) New to IRC? see the link in !ask, or (#3) We may need you to !paste your !logs and !configs and maybe !interface to help you, or (#4) See !howto for beginners, or (#5) See !route for lans behind openvpn, or (#6) !redirect for sending inet traffic through the server, or (#7) Also [15:05:13]

2016-10-08 11:37:44	@vpnHelper	[15:05:48] "serverlan" is (#1) for a lan behind a server, the server must have ip forwarding enabled (!ipforward), the server needs to push a route for its lan to clients, and the router of the lan the server is on needs a route added to it (!route_outside_openvpn), or (#2) see !route for a better explanation, or (#3) Handy troubleshooting flowchart: http://pekster.sdf.org/misc/serverlan.png [15:05:48]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	lulz	[15:17:45] Hello does anyone know of an openvpn billing system? I found a whmcs module but I am looking for a standalone. [15:17:45]

2016-10-08 11:37:44	mete	[20:34:42] lulz: there is also a billing system for hostbill, I know, it is also not a standalone solution... [20:34:42]

2016-10-08 14:44:56	filp_phil	i've read a bit through the source code and to me, it looks like it only reads the key at initial start up, but i haven't been able to look through it well enough to be completely sure that it doesn't have routines in place to also reload the key.

2016-10-08 15:28:07	jobbe	this is the server config file
2016-10-08 15:28:45	jobbe	just thought it would be easier to embed it all into one file despite it's going on the server
2016-10-08 15:29:26	Gaffel	oh
2016-10-08 15:31:48	jobbe	i couldn't find any references so thought I'd ask
2016-10-08 15:32:57	Gaffel	I guess it would be possible to try.
2016-10-08 15:33:08	jobbe	aye
2016-10-08 15:33:14	jobbe	just not sure what tag to use in the file

2016-10-08 15:33:29	Gaffel	Yeah
