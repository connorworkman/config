2016-11-07 06:48:51	@Glamdring	Ooooh.
2016-11-07 06:49:15	@Glamdring	Maybe keep the existing PDWs.
2016-11-07 06:50:17	@Glamdring	Note this isn't necessarily a more optimal military. This one never quite got an early, effective, high calibre automatic that wouldn't jam.
2016-11-07 06:51:04	@Glamdring	So if they need a reliable sidearm, they have revolvers, and the standard automatic isn't as good as our 1911A1.
2016-11-07 06:52:16	@Glamdring	The rifle grenades are probably still chambered for 5.56, since our grenade program was wholly distinct from the other NATO states.

2016-11-07 06:53:16	@Glamdring	Definitely either shoot through or bullet capture, though.

2016-11-07 10:52:51	@FoeHammered	So, Anne just told Marilla about her imaginary friend Katie Maurice.
2016-11-07 10:54:44	@FoeHammered	She said she was so sad to leave Katie when she left Mrs. Thomas' house to live with Mrs. Hammond. See, Mrs. Thomas had half an intact bookcase with half an intact beautiful glass door on it. (The bookcase had no books.) So she had this imaginary friend who looked just like her in the glass.
2016-11-07 10:55:23	@FoeHammered	And so when she kissed Katie goodbye through the glass, Katie kissed her back, and was tearful as she was, and they of course never saw each other again, because that was the bookcase, and it's not like it came with her when she was sent away.
2016-11-07 10:55:23		[10:55]
2016-11-07 10:55:56	@FoeHammered	And Marilla says "Stop imagining things! It's like you half believe the things you imagine. It'd be well for you to get a real friend so you stop having imaginary ones."
2016-11-07 10:56:03	@FoeHammered	"Now go to the living room and memorize your prayers."
2016-11-07 10:56:35	@FoeHammered	The person with whom I'm discussing this in another channel is a very nice Christian lady, and really would not appreciate me laughing at the irony.
