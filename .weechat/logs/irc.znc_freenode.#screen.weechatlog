2016-10-22 08:40:07	Elronnd	sometimes one of my screens will freeze up and I have to ^a^k it and make a new one.  Is there a way to stop this from happenning?

2016-10-22 09:01:29	amade	Elronnd: maybe you accidentally press ^s  or ^a + s
2016-10-22 09:04:37	amade	^s can be disabled in your parent shell with stty -ixon, ^a + s needs to be unbound in screenrc
2016-10-22 09:04:52	amade	you can also manually resume with ^q or ^a + q
2016-10-22 09:05:25	amade	search for xon xoff for more info
2016-10-22 09:06:06	Elronnd	I know it wasn't ^s, because ^q didn't fix it
2016-10-22 09:06:25	Elronnd	^a s could definitely have happeened
2016-10-22 09:06:28	Elronnd	thanks

2016-10-24 22:59:42	Elronnd	[16:35:18] how can I change the command screen uses? [16:35:18]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Elronnd	[16:35:59] e.g. so I use ^m instead of ^a [16:35:59]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Soliton	[16:36:38] screen -e ^Mm [16:36:38]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Elronnd	[16:37:43] can I set it in the config? [16:37:43]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Soliton	[16:38:18] sure, see the escape command. [16:38:18]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Elronnd	[16:38:33] oh, huh [16:38:33]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Elronnd	[16:38:48] apparently ^m is enter [16:38:48]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Elronnd	[16:38:52] damn [16:38:52]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	amade	[16:40:01] yea, I use it all the time on my laptop, which lost it's enter key [16:40:01]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Elronnd	[18:40:07] sometimes one of my screens will freeze up and I have to ^a^k it and make a new one.  Is there a way to stop this from happenning? [18:40:07]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	amade	[19:01:29] Elronnd: maybe you accidentally press ^s  or ^a + s [19:01:29]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	amade	[19:04:36] ^s can be disabled in your parent shell with stty -ixon, ^a + s needs to be unbound in screenrc [19:04:36]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	amade	[19:04:52] you can also manually resume with ^q or ^a + q [19:04:52]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	amade	[19:05:25] search for xon xoff for more info [19:05:25]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Elronnd	[19:06:06] I know it wasn't ^s, because ^q didn't fix it [19:06:06]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Elronnd	[19:06:25] ^a s could definitely have happeened [19:06:25]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Elronnd	[19:06:28] thanks [19:06:28]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	amade	[19:06:44] yeah, that's screen equivalent [19:06:44]

2016-10-24 23:19:19	Elronnd	[16:38:48] apparently ^m is enter [16:38:48]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	Elronnd	[16:38:52] damn [16:38:52]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	amade	[16:40:01] yea, I use it all the time on my laptop, which lost it's enter key [16:40:01]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	Elronnd	[18:40:07] sometimes one of my screens will freeze up and I have to ^a^k it and make a new one.  Is there a way to stop this from happenning? [18:40:07]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	amade	[19:01:29] Elronnd: maybe you accidentally press ^s  or ^a + s [19:01:29]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	amade	[19:04:36] ^s can be disabled in your parent shell with stty -ixon, ^a + s needs to be unbound in screenrc [19:04:36]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	amade	[19:04:52] you can also manually resume with ^q or ^a + q [19:04:52]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	amade	[19:05:25] search for xon xoff for more info [19:05:25]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	Elronnd	[19:06:06] I know it wasn't ^s, because ^q didn't fix it [19:06:06]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	Elronnd	[19:06:25] ^a s could definitely have happeened [19:06:25]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	Elronnd	[19:06:28] thanks [19:06:28]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	amade	[19:06:44] yeah, that's screen equivalent [19:06:44]

2016-10-25 11:42:09	then4116	[16:56:02] brainwash: found out that screen -X or -Q failing because of the password does not result in a non-zero exit value (which is what I need), but results in a message displayed within screen (which is what I don't want) [16:56:02]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	skered	[13:12:42] Can you make to so external programs can't update the screen title? [13:12:42]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	ski	[14:03:44] the window title (aka) ? the (window) hardstatus line ? [14:03:44]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	skered	[15:05:20] window title [15:05:20]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	skered	[15:05:37] er sorry yeah the window title in the hardstatus line [15:05:37]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	skered	[15:05:52] What gets updated with <esc>:title name [15:05:52]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	skered	[15:22:52] RHEL7 likes to do this. [15:22:52]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	skered	[15:23:14] I'm sure it can be fixed on the system but would rather disable it screen [15:23:14]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	amade	[15:27:43] will add some switch, also was annoyed by this few times [15:27:43]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	amade	[15:28:23] something like dynamictitle, so you can enable/disable it for one window and defdynamictitle for global setting [15:28:23]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	ski	[15:31:05] skered : remove `%t' from your hardstatus line format ? [15:31:05]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	amade	[15:31:38] I don't think that stops title from being changed? [15:31:38]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	 *	ski [15:31:50] supposes skered wants to see the user-set titles [15:31:50]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	 *	ski [15:33:00] idly wonders which programs (knows about and) changes the Screen window title [15:33:00]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	skered	[15:33:00] Yeah, that isn't the best solution becaues I want to see the title [15:33:00]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	skered	[15:33:41] But I don't want screen to react to escape sequences that would update titles [15:33:41]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	skered	[15:33:58] ski: There's a lot... and almost anything can. [15:33:58]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	 *	ski [15:34:32] can't remember any [15:34:32]

2016-10-25 11:42:09	Elronnd	[16:35:18] how can I change the command screen uses? [16:35:18]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	Elronnd	[16:35:59] e.g. so I use ^m instead of ^a [16:35:59]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	Soliton	[16:36:38] screen -e ^Mm [16:36:38]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	Elronnd	[16:37:43] can I set it in the config? [16:37:43]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	Soliton	[16:38:18] sure, see the escape command. [16:38:18]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	Elronnd	[16:38:33] oh, huh [16:38:33]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	Elronnd	[16:38:48] apparently ^m is enter [16:38:48]

2016-10-25 11:47:22	then4116	[16:56:02] brainwash: found out that screen -X or -Q failing because of the password does not result in a non-zero exit value (which is what I need), but results in a message displayed within screen (which is what I don't want) [16:56:02]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	skered	[13:12:42] Can you make to so external programs can't update the screen title? [13:12:42]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	ski	[14:03:44] the window title (aka) ? the (window) hardstatus line ? [14:03:44]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	skered	[15:05:20] window title [15:05:20]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	skered	[15:05:37] er sorry yeah the window title in the hardstatus line [15:05:37]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	skered	[15:05:52] What gets updated with <esc>:title name [15:05:52]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	skered	[15:22:52] RHEL7 likes to do this. [15:22:52]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	skered	[15:23:14] I'm sure it can be fixed on the system but would rather disable it screen [15:23:14]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	amade	[15:27:43] will add some switch, also was annoyed by this few times [15:27:43]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	amade	[15:28:23] something like dynamictitle, so you can enable/disable it for one window and defdynamictitle for global setting [15:28:23]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	ski	[15:31:05] skered : remove `%t' from your hardstatus line format ? [15:31:05]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	amade	[15:31:38] I don't think that stops title from being changed? [15:31:38]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	 *	ski [15:31:50] supposes skered wants to see the user-set titles [15:31:50]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	 *	ski [15:33:00] idly wonders which programs (knows about and) changes the Screen window title [15:33:00]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	skered	[15:33:00] Yeah, that isn't the best solution becaues I want to see the title [15:33:00]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	skered	[15:33:41] But I don't want screen to react to escape sequences that would update titles [15:33:41]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	skered	[15:33:58] ski: There's a lot... and almost anything can. [15:33:58]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	 *	ski [15:34:32] can't remember any [15:34:32]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	ski	[15:34:46] (i've noticed some change the hardstatus line, though) [15:34:46]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	amade	[16:27:13] skered: http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/screen.git/commit/?h=screen-v4&id=84f65b5a70d0c3de1b87590a8fb5610d183a45b3  will be in next release [16:27:13]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	Elronnd	[16:35:18] how can I change the command screen uses? [16:35:18]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	Elronnd	[16:35:59] e.g. so I use ^m instead of ^a [16:35:59]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	Soliton	[16:36:38] screen -e ^Mm [16:36:38]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	Elronnd	[16:37:43] can I set it in the config? [16:37:43]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	Soliton	[16:38:18] sure, see the escape command. [16:38:18]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	Elronnd	[16:38:33] oh, huh [16:38:33]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	Elronnd	[16:38:48] apparently ^m is enter [16:38:48]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	Elronnd	[16:38:52] damn [16:38:52]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	amade	[16:40:01] yea, I use it all the time on my laptop, which lost it's enter key [16:40:01]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	Elronnd	[18:40:07] sometimes one of my screens will freeze up and I have to ^a^k it and make a new one.  Is there a way to stop this from happenning? [18:40:07]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	amade	[19:01:29] Elronnd: maybe you accidentally press ^s  or ^a + s [19:01:29]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	amade	[19:04:36] ^s can be disabled in your parent shell with stty -ixon, ^a + s needs to be unbound in screenrc [19:04:36]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	amade	[19:04:52] you can also manually resume with ^q or ^a + q [19:04:52]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	amade	[19:05:25] search for xon xoff for more info [19:05:25]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	Elronnd	[19:06:06] I know it wasn't ^s, because ^q didn't fix it [19:06:06]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	Elronnd	[19:06:25] ^a s could definitely have happeened [19:06:25]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	Elronnd	[19:06:28] thanks [19:06:28]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	amade	[19:06:44] yeah, that's screen equivalent [19:06:44]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	sloth	[10:54:46] armageddon was a better movie than deep impact, discuss [10:54:46]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	Elronnd	[18:29:07] request: < + 3 as a digraph for ♥ [18:29:07]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	amade	[18:43:11] Elronnd: well, plan is to allow users to define their own digraphs [18:43:11]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	Elronnd	[18:43:48] yes, but how likely is that to actually happen? [18:43:48]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	amade	[18:44:45] well it's not that hard to implement, only problem as with everything is time :) [18:44:45]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	Elronnd	[18:45:03] do it, then! [18:45:03]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	ayee_	[21:12:09] Cannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/0' - please check. [21:12:09]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	ayee_	[21:12:27] I have a user I don't want to be able to ssh in as, but I want them to be able to use screen [21:12:27]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	ayee_	[21:12:35] How can I give this user permissions to use screen? [21:12:35]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	ayee_	[21:24:25] I can see in my ps output, /dev/pt/0 and 2 don't have permissions for this user, they're owned by another user [21:24:25]

2016-10-25 15:33:50	skered	[15:22:52] RHEL7 likes to do this. [15:22:52]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	skered	[15:23:14] I'm sure it can be fixed on the system but would rather disable it screen [15:23:14]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[15:27:43] will add some switch, also was annoyed by this few times [15:27:43]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[15:28:23] something like dynamictitle, so you can enable/disable it for one window and defdynamictitle for global setting [15:28:23]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	ski	[15:31:05] skered : remove `%t' from your hardstatus line format ? [15:31:05]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[15:31:38] I don't think that stops title from being changed? [15:31:38]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	 *	ski [15:31:50] supposes skered wants to see the user-set titles [15:31:50]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	 *	ski [15:33:00] idly wonders which programs (knows about and) changes the Screen window title [15:33:00]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	skered	[15:33:00] Yeah, that isn't the best solution becaues I want to see the title [15:33:00]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	skered	[15:33:41] But I don't want screen to react to escape sequences that would update titles [15:33:41]

2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[16:35:18] how can I change the command screen uses? [16:35:18]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[16:35:59] e.g. so I use ^m instead of ^a [16:35:59]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Soliton	[16:36:38] screen -e ^Mm [16:36:38]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[16:37:43] can I set it in the config? [16:37:43]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Soliton	[16:38:18] sure, see the escape command. [16:38:18]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[16:38:33] oh, huh [16:38:33]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[16:38:48] apparently ^m is enter [16:38:48]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[16:38:52] damn [16:38:52]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[16:40:01] yea, I use it all the time on my laptop, which lost it's enter key [16:40:01]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[18:40:07] sometimes one of my screens will freeze up and I have to ^a^k it and make a new one.  Is there a way to stop this from happenning? [18:40:07]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[19:01:29] Elronnd: maybe you accidentally press ^s  or ^a + s [19:01:29]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[19:04:36] ^s can be disabled in your parent shell with stty -ixon, ^a + s needs to be unbound in screenrc [19:04:36]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[19:04:52] you can also manually resume with ^q or ^a + q [19:04:52]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[19:05:25] search for xon xoff for more info [19:05:25]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[19:06:06] I know it wasn't ^s, because ^q didn't fix it [19:06:06]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[19:06:25] ^a s could definitely have happeened [19:06:25]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[19:06:28] thanks [19:06:28]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[19:06:44] yeah, that's screen equivalent [19:06:44]

2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[18:43:11] Elronnd: well, plan is to allow users to define their own digraphs [18:43:11]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[18:43:48] yes, but how likely is that to actually happen? [18:43:48]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[18:44:45] well it's not that hard to implement, only problem as with everything is time :) [18:44:45]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[18:45:03] do it, then! [18:45:03]

2016-10-25 15:33:50	ayee_	[21:12:35] How can I give this user permissions to use screen? [21:12:35]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	ayee_	[21:24:25] I can see in my ps output, /dev/pt/0 and 2 don't have permissions for this user, they're owned by another user [21:24:25]

2016-10-26 09:43:43	Elronnd	[16:35:59] e.g. so I use ^m instead of ^a [16:35:59]

2016-10-26 09:43:43	amade	[16:40:01] yea, I use it all the time on my laptop, which lost it's enter key [16:40:01]

2016-10-26 09:43:43	ayee_	[21:12:27] I have a user I don't want to be able to ssh in as, but I want them to be able to use screen [21:12:27]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	ayee_	[21:12:35] How can I give this user permissions to use screen? [21:12:35]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	ayee_	[21:24:25] I can see in my ps output, /dev/pt/0 and 2 don't have permissions for this user, they're owned by another user [21:24:25]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	peeps[lappy]	[02:51:21] hello, what determines if nested screens display their window bar at the bottom.  i run screen, ssh into another box, run screen on that, and i could have sworn there was a bar at the bottom for each, but just now I tried it and the inner screen has no bar [02:51:21]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	peeps[lappy]	[02:52:35] the outer screen is technically byobu [02:52:35]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	peeps[lappy]	[02:55:39] inner screen: Screen version 4.01.00devel (GNU) 2-May-06 [02:55:39]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	peeps[lappy]	[02:58:26] its running on a beaglebone board (armv7l), running debian wheezy 7.11 [02:58:26]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	peeps[lappy]	[03:00:51] oh, anyways, byobu -v reports the same screen version after it's own version#, on a separate line: "byobu version 5.74", "Screen version 4.01.00devel (GNU) 2-May-06" [03:00:51]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	peeps[lappy]	[03:01:37] thats on my laptop, x86 [03:01:37]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	peeps[lappy]	[03:10:41] also, on the beaglebone, using ps i can see a process that i thought i started in screen, but it has no window. is there some way it could have been "orphaned" and is there a way to connect to that process to see its stdout etc. [03:10:41]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	peeps[lappy]	[03:11:45] there is no other screen to detach or resume [03:11:45]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	peeps[lappy]	[03:45:22] wow, nevermind.  i just realized i had called byobu previously on the beaglebone, not realizing that it uses a tmux backend on that system.  i had no idea some byobu used tmux sometimes.  anyways i was able to reattach, so problem solved [03:45:22]

2016-10-26 12:54:20	peeps[lappy]	[02:51:21] hello, what determines if nested screens display their window bar at the bottom.  i run screen, ssh into another box, run screen on that, and i could have sworn there was a bar at the bottom for each, but just now I tried it and the inner screen has no bar [02:51:21]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	peeps[lappy]	[02:52:35] the outer screen is technically byobu [02:52:35]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	peeps[lappy]	[02:55:39] inner screen: Screen version 4.01.00devel (GNU) 2-May-06 [02:55:39]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	peeps[lappy]	[02:58:26] its running on a beaglebone board (armv7l), running debian wheezy 7.11 [02:58:26]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	peeps[lappy]	[03:00:51] oh, anyways, byobu -v reports the same screen version after it's own version#, on a separate line: "byobu version 5.74", "Screen version 4.01.00devel (GNU) 2-May-06" [03:00:51]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	peeps[lappy]	[03:01:37] thats on my laptop, x86 [03:01:37]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	peeps[lappy]	[03:10:41] also, on the beaglebone, using ps i can see a process that i thought i started in screen, but it has no window. is there some way it could have been "orphaned" and is there a way to connect to that process to see its stdout etc. [03:10:41]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	peeps[lappy]	[03:11:45] there is no other screen to detach or resume [03:11:45]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	peeps[lappy]	[03:45:22] wow, nevermind.  i just realized i had called byobu previously on the beaglebone, not realizing that it uses a tmux backend on that system.  i had no idea some byobu used tmux sometimes.  anyways i was able to reattach, so problem solved [03:45:22]

2016-10-27 17:07:26	skered	[15:23:14] I'm sure it can be fixed on the system but would rather disable it screen [15:23:14]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[15:27:43] will add some switch, also was annoyed by this few times [15:27:43]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[15:28:23] something like dynamictitle, so you can enable/disable it for one window and defdynamictitle for global setting [15:28:23]

2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[15:31:38] I don't think that stops title from being changed? [15:31:38]

2016-10-27 17:07:26	skered	[15:33:00] Yeah, that isn't the best solution becaues I want to see the title [15:33:00]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	skered	[15:33:41] But I don't want screen to react to escape sequences that would update titles [15:33:41]

2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[16:35:59] e.g. so I use ^m instead of ^a [16:35:59]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Soliton	[16:36:38] screen -e ^Mm [16:36:38]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[16:37:43] can I set it in the config? [16:37:43]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Soliton	[16:38:18] sure, see the escape command. [16:38:18]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[16:38:33] oh, huh [16:38:33]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[16:38:48] apparently ^m is enter [16:38:48]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[16:38:52] damn [16:38:52]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[16:40:01] yea, I use it all the time on my laptop, which lost it's enter key [16:40:01]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[18:40:07] sometimes one of my screens will freeze up and I have to ^a^k it and make a new one.  Is there a way to stop this from happenning? [18:40:07]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[19:01:29] Elronnd: maybe you accidentally press ^s  or ^a + s [19:01:29]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[19:04:36] ^s can be disabled in your parent shell with stty -ixon, ^a + s needs to be unbound in screenrc [19:04:36]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[19:04:52] you can also manually resume with ^q or ^a + q [19:04:52]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[19:05:25] search for xon xoff for more info [19:05:25]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[19:06:06] I know it wasn't ^s, because ^q didn't fix it [19:06:06]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[19:06:25] ^a s could definitely have happeened [19:06:25]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[19:06:28] thanks [19:06:28]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[19:06:44] yeah, that's screen equivalent [19:06:44]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	sloth	[10:54:46] armageddon was a better movie than deep impact, discuss [10:54:46]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[18:29:07] request: < + 3 as a digraph for ♥ [18:29:07]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[18:43:11] Elronnd: well, plan is to allow users to define their own digraphs [18:43:11]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[18:43:48] yes, but how likely is that to actually happen? [18:43:48]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[18:44:45] well it's not that hard to implement, only problem as with everything is time :) [18:44:45]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[18:45:03] do it, then! [18:45:03]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	ayee_	[21:12:09] Cannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/0' - please check. [21:12:09]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	ayee_	[21:12:27] I have a user I don't want to be able to ssh in as, but I want them to be able to use screen [21:12:27]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	ayee_	[21:12:35] How can I give this user permissions to use screen? [21:12:35]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	ayee_	[21:24:25] I can see in my ps output, /dev/pt/0 and 2 don't have permissions for this user, they're owned by another user [21:24:25]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	peeps[lappy]	[02:51:21] hello, what determines if nested screens display their window bar at the bottom.  i run screen, ssh into another box, run screen on that, and i could have sworn there was a bar at the bottom for each, but just now I tried it and the inner screen has no bar [02:51:21]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	peeps[lappy]	[02:52:35] the outer screen is technically byobu [02:52:35]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	peeps[lappy]	[02:55:39] inner screen: Screen version 4.01.00devel (GNU) 2-May-06 [02:55:39]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	peeps[lappy]	[02:58:26] its running on a beaglebone board (armv7l), running debian wheezy 7.11 [02:58:26]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	peeps[lappy]	[03:00:51] oh, anyways, byobu -v reports the same screen version after it's own version#, on a separate line: "byobu version 5.74", "Screen version 4.01.00devel (GNU) 2-May-06" [03:00:51]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	peeps[lappy]	[03:01:37] thats on my laptop, x86 [03:01:37]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	peeps[lappy]	[03:10:41] also, on the beaglebone, using ps i can see a process that i thought i started in screen, but it has no window. is there some way it could have been "orphaned" and is there a way to connect to that process to see its stdout etc. [03:10:41]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	peeps[lappy]	[03:11:45] there is no other screen to detach or resume [03:11:45]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	peeps[lappy]	[03:45:22] wow, nevermind.  i just realized i had called byobu previously on the beaglebone, not realizing that it uses a tmux backend on that system.  i had no idea some byobu used tmux sometimes.  anyways i was able to reattach, so problem solved [03:45:22]

2016-10-27 22:29:50	ski	[15:31:05] skered : remove `%t' from your hardstatus line format ? [15:31:05]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	amade	[15:31:38] I don't think that stops title from being changed? [15:31:38]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	 *	ski [15:31:50] supposes skered wants to see the user-set titles [15:31:50]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	 *	ski [15:33:00] idly wonders which programs (knows about and) changes the Screen window title [15:33:00]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	skered	[15:33:00] Yeah, that isn't the best solution becaues I want to see the title [15:33:00]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	skered	[15:33:41] But I don't want screen to react to escape sequences that would update titles [15:33:41]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	skered	[15:33:58] ski: There's a lot... and almost anything can. [15:33:58]

2016-10-27 22:29:50	Elronnd	[16:35:18] how can I change the command screen uses? [16:35:18]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Elronnd	[16:35:59] e.g. so I use ^m instead of ^a [16:35:59]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Soliton	[16:36:38] screen -e ^Mm [16:36:38]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Elronnd	[16:37:43] can I set it in the config? [16:37:43]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Soliton	[16:38:18] sure, see the escape command. [16:38:18]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Elronnd	[16:38:33] oh, huh [16:38:33]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Elronnd	[16:38:48] apparently ^m is enter [16:38:48]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Elronnd	[16:38:52] damn [16:38:52]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	amade	[16:40:01] yea, I use it all the time on my laptop, which lost it's enter key [16:40:01]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Elronnd	[18:40:07] sometimes one of my screens will freeze up and I have to ^a^k it and make a new one.  Is there a way to stop this from happenning? [18:40:07]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	amade	[19:01:29] Elronnd: maybe you accidentally press ^s  or ^a + s [19:01:29]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	amade	[19:04:36] ^s can be disabled in your parent shell with stty -ixon, ^a + s needs to be unbound in screenrc [19:04:36]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	amade	[19:04:52] you can also manually resume with ^q or ^a + q [19:04:52]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	amade	[19:05:25] search for xon xoff for more info [19:05:25]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Elronnd	[19:06:06] I know it wasn't ^s, because ^q didn't fix it [19:06:06]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Elronnd	[19:06:25] ^a s could definitely have happeened [19:06:25]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Elronnd	[19:06:28] thanks [19:06:28]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	amade	[19:06:44] yeah, that's screen equivalent [19:06:44]

2016-10-28 11:26:21	peeps[lappy]	[03:45:22] wow, nevermind.  i just realized i had called byobu previously on the beaglebone, not realizing that it uses a tmux backend on that system.  i had no idea some byobu used tmux sometimes.  anyways i was able to reattach, so problem solved [03:45:22]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[07:26:51] is there a way to run a subprocess on a detached screen? i.e. if I were attached to a serial screen, I might ^a : and then type "exec !! sx file.txt" to send a file.  [07:26:51]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[07:26:56] If I wanted to just send some text to a detached screen I would do somethign like screen -S detachedScreen -p 0 -X stuff "sometext" [07:26:56]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[07:27:08] I'd like to do somethign like screen -S detachedScreen -p 0 -X exec !! sx txFile [07:27:08]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[08:48:22] what prevents you from doing that? [08:48:22]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	labelette	[09:09:29] hi, I have an issue with mutt into gnuscreen,I read some other related topic but unable to make it work. mutt gets confuse when scrolling into email and my sidebar gets overwritten&black,another thing is on the message list the selection color (blue in my case) doesnt select all the line but only the words any idea?(using term xterm-256color in my screenrc I tried screen-256color-s but not better) [09:09:29]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[14:00:11] Soliton: I've tried that (screen -S detachedScreen -p 0 -X exec !! sx txFile) but as far as I can make out, the command doesn't get executed. i.e. attaching to the screen I see no evidence of it trying to send the file, and of couse no evidence of a file being received on the other end. [14:00:11]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:43:24] gnac: looks like you need to explicitely select a window if you've never attached. there is no current window on a never attached screen and exec only works for the current window. [19:43:24]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:44:43] gnac: i suppose one could argue that -p not working as expected here is a bug. [19:44:43]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:45:35] Soliton: I escaped the !! so \!\! and that worked better, but then I received a message in my receiver terminal about exec sx not existing or some such. [19:45:35]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:46:27] The goal is to be able to script sending a file. I had been successful gettign screen to send it using exec !! sx .. while attached. Now I'm trying to see if I can do it while detached. [19:46:27]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:46:32] if the shell you issued the command from has history expansion on you need to escape !, yeah. [19:46:32]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:47:09] Yeah, that explained the weirdness I was seeing in the exection.  [19:47:09]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:48:20] exec sx not existing sounds like a quoting error. [19:48:20]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:48:49] Should I try quoting the entire thing? or just sx? [19:48:49]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:49:11] what is the command you have now? [19:49:11]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:50:07] I"ve tried screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \\!\\! sx txFile and screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx txFile [19:50:07]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:50:42] the latter looks good. [19:50:42]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:51:02] -p0 is not doing anything though. [19:51:02]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:51:29] (not that it matters much for your use case.) [19:51:29]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:51:49] the latter gives me "Cannot exec '\!\!': No such file or directory" in the sending screen when I reattach to check status [19:51:49]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:52:50] as does -X exec \!\! "sx txFile" [19:52:50]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:52:57] works fine here. [19:52:57]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:53:38] really, wth [19:53:38]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:53:38] that one is wrong. it'll try executing "sx txFile". [19:53:38]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	amade	[19:53:41] um, doesn't exec expect actual binary? [19:53:41]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:53:53] sx is a binary, no? [19:53:53]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	amade	[19:54:02] but first argument is \!\! [19:54:02]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:54:12] that's the argument to exec. [19:54:12]

2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:54:57] hm, good question, Didn't think about it. txFile is text, I could try a binary. [19:54:57]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:55:07] i mean that is the fdpat part in: exec [[fdpat] newcommand [args …]] [19:55:07]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	amade	[19:55:25] yea, there seems to be something like this [19:55:25]

2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:56:03] works! [19:56:03]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:57:03] seems to be the same as  screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx txFile  from before. ;-) [19:57:03]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:57:22] actually works now with a text file too. Well I haven't compared the resuls yet [19:57:22]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:57:59] not sure what else I did different, but great now that I can repeat it  [19:57:59]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:58:48] So, can I do the same thing on the other side? eg screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx binFile [19:58:48]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:58:54] but with rx?  [19:58:54]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:59:46] one way to find out. [19:59:46]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[20:00:31] yep, sure does! I'm very happy. Thanks for your help [20:00:31]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[20:01:24] hmm, i cannot reproduce the issue with an unattached screen i had before. [20:01:24]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[20:03:58] one more thing, how to I close the detached session? i.e. ^a \ while detached? [20:03:58]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[20:05:25] terminate the screen session? -X quit [20:05:25]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[20:05:42] or kill whatever is running inside. [20:05:42]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[20:10:57] both, but I expect -X quit will also kill anything running inside, correct? [20:10:57]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[20:12:13] yes. [20:12:13]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[20:12:22] thanks! [20:12:22]

2016-10-28 12:28:14	peeps[lappy]	[03:45:22] wow, nevermind.  i just realized i had called byobu previously on the beaglebone, not realizing that it uses a tmux backend on that system.  i had no idea some byobu used tmux sometimes.  anyways i was able to reattach, so problem solved [03:45:22]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[07:26:51] is there a way to run a subprocess on a detached screen? i.e. if I were attached to a serial screen, I might ^a : and then type "exec !! sx file.txt" to send a file.  [07:26:51]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[07:26:56] If I wanted to just send some text to a detached screen I would do somethign like screen -S detachedScreen -p 0 -X stuff "sometext" [07:26:56]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[07:27:08] I'd like to do somethign like screen -S detachedScreen -p 0 -X exec !! sx txFile [07:27:08]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[08:48:22] what prevents you from doing that? [08:48:22]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	labelette	[09:09:29] hi, I have an issue with mutt into gnuscreen,I read some other related topic but unable to make it work. mutt gets confuse when scrolling into email and my sidebar gets overwritten&black,another thing is on the message list the selection color (blue in my case) doesnt select all the line but only the words any idea?(using term xterm-256color in my screenrc I tried screen-256color-s but not better) [09:09:29]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[14:00:11] Soliton: I've tried that (screen -S detachedScreen -p 0 -X exec !! sx txFile) but as far as I can make out, the command doesn't get executed. i.e. attaching to the screen I see no evidence of it trying to send the file, and of couse no evidence of a file being received on the other end. [14:00:11]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:43:24] gnac: looks like you need to explicitely select a window if you've never attached. there is no current window on a never attached screen and exec only works for the current window. [19:43:24]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:44:43] gnac: i suppose one could argue that -p not working as expected here is a bug. [19:44:43]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[19:45:35] Soliton: I escaped the !! so \!\! and that worked better, but then I received a message in my receiver terminal about exec sx not existing or some such. [19:45:35]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[19:46:27] The goal is to be able to script sending a file. I had been successful gettign screen to send it using exec !! sx .. while attached. Now I'm trying to see if I can do it while detached. [19:46:27]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:46:32] if the shell you issued the command from has history expansion on you need to escape !, yeah. [19:46:32]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[19:47:09] Yeah, that explained the weirdness I was seeing in the exection.  [19:47:09]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:48:20] exec sx not existing sounds like a quoting error. [19:48:20]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[19:48:49] Should I try quoting the entire thing? or just sx? [19:48:49]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:49:11] what is the command you have now? [19:49:11]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[19:50:07] I"ve tried screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \\!\\! sx txFile and screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx txFile [19:50:07]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:50:42] the latter looks good. [19:50:42]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:51:02] -p0 is not doing anything though. [19:51:02]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:51:29] (not that it matters much for your use case.) [19:51:29]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[19:51:49] the latter gives me "Cannot exec '\!\!': No such file or directory" in the sending screen when I reattach to check status [19:51:49]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[19:52:50] as does -X exec \!\! "sx txFile" [19:52:50]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:52:57] works fine here. [19:52:57]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[19:53:38] really, wth [19:53:38]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:53:38] that one is wrong. it'll try executing "sx txFile". [19:53:38]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	amade	[19:53:41] um, doesn't exec expect actual binary? [19:53:41]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:53:53] sx is a binary, no? [19:53:53]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	amade	[19:54:02] but first argument is \!\! [19:54:02]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:54:12] that's the argument to exec. [19:54:12]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	amade	[19:54:20] so it tried to run \!\! [19:54:20]

2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[19:52:50] as does -X exec \!\! "sx txFile" [19:52:50]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[19:52:57] works fine here. [19:52:57]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[19:53:38] really, wth [19:53:38]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[19:53:38] that one is wrong. it'll try executing "sx txFile". [19:53:38]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	amade	[19:53:41] um, doesn't exec expect actual binary? [19:53:41]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[19:53:53] sx is a binary, no? [19:53:53]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	amade	[19:54:02] but first argument is \!\! [19:54:02]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[19:54:12] that's the argument to exec. [19:54:12]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	amade	[19:54:20] so it tried to run \!\! [19:54:20]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[19:54:57] hm, good question, Didn't think about it. txFile is text, I could try a binary. [19:54:57]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[19:55:07] i mean that is the fdpat part in: exec [[fdpat] newcommand [args …]] [19:55:07]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	amade	[19:55:25] yea, there seems to be something like this [19:55:25]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[19:55:37] (which is optional as you can see there.) [19:55:37]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[19:56:01] screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx binFile [19:56:01]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[19:56:03] works! [19:56:03]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[19:57:03] seems to be the same as  screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx txFile  from before. ;-) [19:57:03]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[19:57:22] actually works now with a text file too. Well I haven't compared the resuls yet [19:57:22]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[19:57:59] not sure what else I did different, but great now that I can repeat it  [19:57:59]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[19:58:48] So, can I do the same thing on the other side? eg screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx binFile [19:58:48]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[19:58:54] but with rx?  [19:58:54]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[19:59:46] one way to find out. [19:59:46]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[20:00:31] yep, sure does! I'm very happy. Thanks for your help [20:00:31]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[20:01:24] hmm, i cannot reproduce the issue with an unattached screen i had before. [20:01:24]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[20:03:58] one more thing, how to I close the detached session? i.e. ^a \ while detached? [20:03:58]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[20:05:25] terminate the screen session? -X quit [20:05:25]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[20:05:42] or kill whatever is running inside. [20:05:42]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[20:10:57] both, but I expect -X quit will also kill anything running inside, correct? [20:10:57]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[20:12:13] yes. [20:12:13]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[20:12:22] thanks! [20:12:22]

2016-10-28 22:29:33	peeps[lappy]	[03:45:22] wow, nevermind.  i just realized i had called byobu previously on the beaglebone, not realizing that it uses a tmux backend on that system.  i had no idea some byobu used tmux sometimes.  anyways i was able to reattach, so problem solved [03:45:22]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	gnac	[07:26:51] is there a way to run a subprocess on a detached screen? i.e. if I were attached to a serial screen, I might ^a : and then type "exec !! sx file.txt" to send a file. [07:26:51]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	gnac	[07:26:56] If I wanted to just send some text to a detached screen I would do somethign like screen -S detachedScreen -p 0 -X stuff "sometext" [07:26:56]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	gnac	[07:27:08] I'd like to do somethign like screen -S detachedScreen -p 0 -X exec !! sx txFile [07:27:08]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	Soliton	[08:48:22] what prevents you from doing that? [08:48:22]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	labelette	[09:09:29] hi, I have an issue with mutt into gnuscreen,I read some other related topic but unable to make it work. mutt gets confuse when scrolling into email and my sidebar gets overwritten&black,another thing is on the message list the selection color (blue in my case) doesnt select all the line but only the words any idea?(using term xterm-256color in my screenrc I tried screen-256color-s but not better) [09:09:29]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	gnac	[14:00:11] Soliton: I've tried that (screen -S detachedScreen -p 0 -X exec !! sx txFile) but as far as I can make out, the command doesn't get executed. i.e. attaching to the screen I see no evidence of it trying to send the file, and of couse no evidence of a file being received on the other end. [14:00:11]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	Soliton	[19:43:24] gnac: looks like you need to explicitely select a window if you've never attached. there is no current window on a never attached screen and exec only works for the current window. [19:43:24]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	Soliton	[19:44:43] gnac: i suppose one could argue that -p not working as expected here is a bug. [19:44:43]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	gnac	[19:45:35] Soliton: I escaped the !! so \!\! and that worked better, but then I received a message in my receiver terminal about exec sx not existing or some such. [19:45:35]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	gnac	[19:46:27] The goal is to be able to script sending a file. I had been successful gettign screen to send it using exec !! sx .. while attached. Now I'm trying to see if I can do it while detached. [19:46:27]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	Soliton	[19:46:32] if the shell you issued the command from has history expansion on you need to escape !, yeah. [19:46:32]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	gnac	[19:47:09] Yeah, that explained the weirdness I was seeing in the exection. [19:47:09]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	Soliton	[19:48:20] exec sx not existing sounds like a quoting error. [19:48:20]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	gnac	[19:48:49] Should I try quoting the entire thing? or just sx? [19:48:49]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	Soliton	[19:49:11] what is the command you have now? [19:49:11]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	gnac	[19:50:07] I"ve tried screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \\!\\! sx txFile and screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx txFile [19:50:07]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	Soliton	[19:50:42] the latter looks good. [19:50:42]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	Soliton	[19:51:02] -p0 is not doing anything though. [19:51:02]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	Soliton	[19:51:29] (not that it matters much for your use case.) [19:51:29]

2016-10-29 12:25:07	Soliton	[19:48:20] exec sx not existing sounds like a quoting error. [19:48:20]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	gnac	[19:48:49] Should I try quoting the entire thing? or just sx? [19:48:49]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	Soliton	[19:49:11] what is the command you have now? [19:49:11]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	gnac	[19:50:07] I"ve tried screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \\!\\! sx txFile and screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx txFile [19:50:07]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:50:42] the latter looks good. [19:50:42]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:51:02] -p0 is not doing anything though. [19:51:02]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:51:29] (not that it matters much for your use case.) [19:51:29]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[19:51:49] the latter gives me "Cannot exec '\!\!': No such file or directory" in the sending screen when I reattach to check status [19:51:49]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[19:52:50] as does -X exec \!\! "sx txFile" [19:52:50]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:52:57] works fine here. [19:52:57]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[19:53:38] really, wth [19:53:38]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:53:38] that one is wrong. it'll try executing "sx txFile". [19:53:38]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	amade	[19:53:41] um, doesn't exec expect actual binary? [19:53:41]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:53:53] sx is a binary, no? [19:53:53]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	amade	[19:54:02] but first argument is \!\! [19:54:02]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:54:12] that's the argument to exec. [19:54:12]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	amade	[19:54:20] so it tried to run \!\! [19:54:20]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[19:54:57] hm, good question, Didn't think about it. txFile is text, I could try a binary. [19:54:57]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:55:07] i mean that is the fdpat part in: exec [[fdpat] newcommand [args …]] [19:55:07]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	amade	[19:55:25] yea, there seems to be something like this [19:55:25]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:55:37] (which is optional as you can see there.) [19:55:37]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[19:56:01] screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx binFile [19:56:01]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[19:56:03] works! [19:56:03]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:57:03] seems to be the same as  screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx txFile  from before. ;-) [19:57:03]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[19:57:22] actually works now with a text file too. Well I haven't compared the resuls yet [19:57:22]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[19:57:59] not sure what else I did different, but great now that I can repeat it [19:57:59]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[19:58:48] So, can I do the same thing on the other side? eg screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx binFile [19:58:48]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[19:58:54] but with rx? [19:58:54]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:59:46] one way to find out. [19:59:46]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[20:00:31] yep, sure does! I'm very happy. Thanks for your help [20:00:31]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[20:01:24] hmm, i cannot reproduce the issue with an unattached screen i had before. [20:01:24]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[20:03:58] one more thing, how to I close the detached session? i.e. ^a \ while detached? [20:03:58]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[20:05:25] terminate the screen session? -X quit [20:05:25]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[20:05:42] or kill whatever is running inside. [20:05:42]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[20:10:57] both, but I expect -X quit will also kill anything running inside, correct? [20:10:57]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[20:12:13] yes. [20:12:13]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[20:12:22] thanks! [20:12:22]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	labelette	[09:40:08] is there a way to make C-e, C-down, C-up work with screen ? All of theses shortcut are my binding for mutt and running under screen theses keys combination are not recognized anymore :( [09:40:08]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	brainwash	[09:46:10] labelette: unbind them I'd guss [09:46:10]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	brainwash	[09:46:19] bind e [09:46:19]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	brainwash	[09:46:43] oh wait [09:46:43]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	labelette	[10:23:13] brainwash: you think it is as simple ? should I unbind it? [10:23:13]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	brainwash	[10:24:19] labelette: it should be actually like this in your case: bindkey ^e [10:24:19]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	brainwash	[10:24:32] but does screen even bind C-e? [10:24:32]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	labelette	[10:31:45] brainwash : this is what I thought this is strange has I don't think screen is using/binding it... it is like it does'nt pass the instruction to mutt [10:31:45]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	labelette	[10:32:27] any idea of the command should I try after bindkey ^e ?  [10:32:27]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	brainwash	[10:34:21] didn't bindkey ^e help? [10:34:21]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	brainwash	[10:34:50] I guess no [10:34:50]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	brainwash	[10:35:30] labelette: did you ask in the mutt channel? I assume that quite a few people run it inside screen [10:35:30]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	labelette	[10:37:57] brainwash: I will good suggestion [10:37:57]

2016-10-29 23:10:15	Soliton	[19:48:20] exec sx not existing sounds like a quoting error. [19:48:20]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	gnac	[19:48:49] Should I try quoting the entire thing? or just sx? [19:48:49]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	Soliton	[19:49:11] what is the command you have now? [19:49:11]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	gnac	[19:50:07] I"ve tried screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \\!\\! sx txFile and screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx txFile [19:50:07]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	Soliton	[19:50:42] the latter looks good. [19:50:42]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	Soliton	[19:51:02] -p0 is not doing anything though. [19:51:02]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	Soliton	[19:51:29] (not that it matters much for your use case.) [19:51:29]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	gnac	[19:51:49] the latter gives me "Cannot exec '\!\!': No such file or directory" in the sending screen when I reattach to check status [19:51:49]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	gnac	[19:52:50] as does -X exec \!\! "sx txFile" [19:52:50]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	Soliton	[19:52:57] works fine here. [19:52:57]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	gnac	[19:53:38] really, wth [19:53:38]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	Soliton	[19:53:38] that one is wrong. it'll try executing "sx txFile". [19:53:38]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	amade	[19:53:41] um, doesn't exec expect actual binary? [19:53:41]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	Soliton	[19:53:53] sx is a binary, no? [19:53:53]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	amade	[19:54:02] but first argument is \!\! [19:54:02]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	Soliton	[19:54:12] that's the argument to exec. [19:54:12]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	amade	[19:54:20] so it tried to run \!\! [19:54:20]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	gnac	[19:54:57] hm, good question, Didn't think about it. txFile is text, I could try a binary. [19:54:57]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	Soliton	[19:55:07] i mean that is the fdpat part in: exec [[fdpat] newcommand [args …]] [19:55:07]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	amade	[19:55:25] yea, there seems to be something like this [19:55:25]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	Soliton	[19:55:37] (which is optional as you can see there.) [19:55:37]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	gnac	[19:56:01] screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx binFile [19:56:01]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	gnac	[19:56:03] works! [19:56:03]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	Soliton	[19:57:03] seems to be the same as  screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx txFile  from before. ;-) [19:57:03]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	gnac	[19:57:22] actually works now with a text file too. Well I haven't compared the resuls yet [19:57:22]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	gnac	[19:57:59] not sure what else I did different, but great now that I can repeat it [19:57:59]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	gnac	[19:58:48] So, can I do the same thing on the other side? eg screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx binFile [19:58:48]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	gnac	[19:58:54] but with rx? [19:58:54]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	Soliton	[19:59:46] one way to find out. [19:59:46]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	gnac	[20:00:31] yep, sure does! I'm very happy. Thanks for your help [20:00:31]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	Soliton	[20:01:24] hmm, i cannot reproduce the issue with an unattached screen i had before. [20:01:24]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	gnac	[20:03:58] one more thing, how to I close the detached session? i.e. ^a \ while detached? [20:03:58]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	Soliton	[20:05:25] terminate the screen session? -X quit [20:05:25]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	Soliton	[20:05:42] or kill whatever is running inside. [20:05:42]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	gnac	[20:10:57] both, but I expect -X quit will also kill anything running inside, correct? [20:10:57]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	Soliton	[20:12:13] yes. [20:12:13]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	gnac	[20:12:22] thanks! [20:12:22]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	labelette	[09:40:08] is there a way to make C-e, C-down, C-up work with screen ? All of theses shortcut are my binding for mutt and running under screen theses keys combination are not recognized anymore :( [09:40:08]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	brainwash	[09:46:10] labelette: unbind them I'd guss [09:46:10]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	brainwash	[09:46:19] bind e [09:46:19]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	brainwash	[09:46:43] oh wait [09:46:43]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	labelette	[10:23:13] brainwash: you think it is as simple ? should I unbind it? [10:23:13]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	brainwash	[10:24:19] labelette: it should be actually like this in your case: bindkey ^e [10:24:19]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	brainwash	[10:24:32] but does screen even bind C-e? [10:24:32]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	labelette	[10:31:45] brainwash : this is what I thought this is strange has I don't think screen is using/binding it... it is like it does'nt pass the instruction to mutt [10:31:45]

2016-10-31 00:23:15	Soliton	[19:51:02] -p0 is not doing anything though. [19:51:02]

2016-10-31 00:23:15	gnac	[19:51:49] the latter gives me "Cannot exec '\!\!': No such file or directory" in the sending screen when I reattach to check status [19:51:49]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	gnac	[19:52:50] as does -X exec \!\! "sx txFile" [19:52:50]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	Soliton	[19:52:57] works fine here. [19:52:57]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	gnac	[19:53:38] really, wth [19:53:38]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	Soliton	[19:53:38] that one is wrong. it'll try executing "sx txFile". [19:53:38]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	amade	[19:53:41] um, doesn't exec expect actual binary? [19:53:41]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	Soliton	[19:53:53] sx is a binary, no? [19:53:53]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	amade	[19:54:02] but first argument is \!\! [19:54:02]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	Soliton	[19:54:12] that's the argument to exec. [19:54:12]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	amade	[19:54:20] so it tried to run \!\! [19:54:20]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	gnac	[19:54:57] hm, good question, Didn't think about it. txFile is text, I could try a binary. [19:54:57]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	Soliton	[19:55:07] i mean that is the fdpat part in: exec [[fdpat] newcommand [args …]] [19:55:07]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	amade	[19:55:25] yea, there seems to be something like this [19:55:25]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	Soliton	[19:55:37] (which is optional as you can see there.) [19:55:37]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	gnac	[19:56:01] screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx binFile [19:56:01]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	gnac	[19:56:03] works! [19:56:03]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	Soliton	[19:57:03] seems to be the same as  screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx txFile  from before. ;-) [19:57:03]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	gnac	[19:57:22] actually works now with a text file too. Well I haven't compared the resuls yet [19:57:22]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	gnac	[19:57:59] not sure what else I did different, but great now that I can repeat it [19:57:59]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	gnac	[19:58:48] So, can I do the same thing on the other side? eg screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx binFile [19:58:48]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	gnac	[19:58:54] but with rx? [19:58:54]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	Soliton	[19:59:46] one way to find out. [19:59:46]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	gnac	[20:00:31] yep, sure does! I'm very happy. Thanks for your help [20:00:31]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	Soliton	[20:01:24] hmm, i cannot reproduce the issue with an unattached screen i had before. [20:01:24]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	gnac	[20:03:58] one more thing, how to I close the detached session? i.e. ^a \ while detached? [20:03:58]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	Soliton	[20:05:25] terminate the screen session? -X quit [20:05:25]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	Soliton	[20:05:42] or kill whatever is running inside. [20:05:42]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	gnac	[20:10:57] both, but I expect -X quit will also kill anything running inside, correct? [20:10:57]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	Soliton	[20:12:13] yes. [20:12:13]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	gnac	[20:12:22] thanks! [20:12:22]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	labelette	[09:40:08] is there a way to make C-e, C-down, C-up work with screen ? All of theses shortcut are my binding for mutt and running under screen theses keys combination are not recognized anymore :( [09:40:08]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	brainwash	[09:46:10] labelette: unbind them I'd guss [09:46:10]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	brainwash	[09:46:19] bind e [09:46:19]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	brainwash	[09:46:43] oh wait [09:46:43]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	labelette	[10:23:13] brainwash: you think it is as simple ? should I unbind it? [10:23:13]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	brainwash	[10:24:19] labelette: it should be actually like this in your case: bindkey ^e [10:24:19]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	brainwash	[10:24:32] but does screen even bind C-e? [10:24:32]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	labelette	[10:31:45] brainwash : this is what I thought this is strange has I don't think screen is using/binding it... it is like it does'nt pass the instruction to mutt [10:31:45]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	labelette	[10:32:27] any idea of the command should I try after bindkey ^e ?  [10:32:27]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	brainwash	[10:34:21] didn't bindkey ^e help? [10:34:21]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	brainwash	[10:34:50] I guess no [10:34:50]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	brainwash	[10:35:30] labelette: did you ask in the mutt channel? I assume that quite a few people run it inside screen [10:35:30]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	labelette	[10:37:57] brainwash: I will good suggestion [10:37:57]

2016-10-31 13:42:04	Soliton	[19:53:38] that one is wrong. it'll try executing "sx txFile". [19:53:38]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	amade	[19:53:41] um, doesn't exec expect actual binary? [19:53:41]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	Soliton	[19:53:53] sx is a binary, no? [19:53:53]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	amade	[19:54:02] but first argument is \!\! [19:54:02]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	Soliton	[19:54:12] that's the argument to exec. [19:54:12]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	amade	[19:54:20] so it tried to run \!\! [19:54:20]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	gnac	[19:54:57] hm, good question, Didn't think about it. txFile is text, I could try a binary. [19:54:57]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	Soliton	[19:55:07] i mean that is the fdpat part in: exec [[fdpat] newcommand [args …]] [19:55:07]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	amade	[19:55:25] yea, there seems to be something like this [19:55:25]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	Soliton	[19:55:37] (which is optional as you can see there.) [19:55:37]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	gnac	[19:56:01] screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx binFile [19:56:01]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	gnac	[19:56:03] works! [19:56:03]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	Soliton	[19:57:03] seems to be the same as  screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx txFile  from before. ;-) [19:57:03]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	gnac	[19:57:22] actually works now with a text file too. Well I haven't compared the resuls yet [19:57:22]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	gnac	[19:57:59] not sure what else I did different, but great now that I can repeat it [19:57:59]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	gnac	[19:58:48] So, can I do the same thing on the other side? eg screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx binFile [19:58:48]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	gnac	[19:58:54] but with rx? [19:58:54]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	Soliton	[19:59:46] one way to find out. [19:59:46]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	gnac	[20:00:31] yep, sure does! I'm very happy. Thanks for your help [20:00:31]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	Soliton	[20:01:24] hmm, i cannot reproduce the issue with an unattached screen i had before. [20:01:24]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	gnac	[20:03:58] one more thing, how to I close the detached session? i.e. ^a \ while detached? [20:03:58]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	Soliton	[20:05:25] terminate the screen session? -X quit [20:05:25]

2016-10-31 16:21:05	Soliton	[19:53:38] that one is wrong. it'll try executing "sx txFile". [19:53:38]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	amade	[19:53:41] um, doesn't exec expect actual binary? [19:53:41]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	Soliton	[19:53:53] sx is a binary, no? [19:53:53]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	amade	[19:54:02] but first argument is \!\! [19:54:02]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	Soliton	[19:54:12] that's the argument to exec. [19:54:12]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	amade	[19:54:20] so it tried to run \!\! [19:54:20]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	gnac	[19:54:57] hm, good question, Didn't think about it. txFile is text, I could try a binary. [19:54:57]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	Soliton	[19:55:07] i mean that is the fdpat part in: exec [[fdpat] newcommand [args …]] [19:55:07]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	amade	[19:55:25] yea, there seems to be something like this [19:55:25]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	Soliton	[19:55:37] (which is optional as you can see there.) [19:55:37]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	gnac	[19:56:01] screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx binFile [19:56:01]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	gnac	[19:56:03] works! [19:56:03]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	Soliton	[19:57:03] seems to be the same as  screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx txFile  from before. ;-) [19:57:03]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	gnac	[19:57:22] actually works now with a text file too. Well I haven't compared the resuls yet [19:57:22]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	gnac	[19:57:59] not sure what else I did different, but great now that I can repeat it [19:57:59]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	gnac	[19:58:48] So, can I do the same thing on the other side? eg screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx binFile [19:58:48]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	gnac	[19:58:54] but with rx? [19:58:54]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	Soliton	[19:59:46] one way to find out. [19:59:46]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	gnac	[20:00:31] yep, sure does! I'm very happy. Thanks for your help [20:00:31]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	Soliton	[20:01:24] hmm, i cannot reproduce the issue with an unattached screen i had before. [20:01:24]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	gnac	[20:03:58] one more thing, how to I close the detached session? i.e. ^a \ while detached? [20:03:58]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	Soliton	[20:05:25] terminate the screen session? -X quit [20:05:25]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	Soliton	[20:05:42] or kill whatever is running inside. [20:05:42]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	gnac	[20:10:57] both, but I expect -X quit will also kill anything running inside, correct? [20:10:57]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	Soliton	[20:12:13] yes. [20:12:13]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	gnac	[20:12:22] thanks! [20:12:22]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	labelette	[09:40:08] is there a way to make C-e, C-down, C-up work with screen ? All of theses shortcut are my binding for mutt and running under screen theses keys combination are not recognized anymore :( [09:40:08]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	brainwash	[09:46:10] labelette: unbind them I'd guss [09:46:10]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	brainwash	[09:46:19] bind e [09:46:19]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	brainwash	[09:46:43] oh wait [09:46:43]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	labelette	[10:23:13] brainwash: you think it is as simple ? should I unbind it? [10:23:13]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	brainwash	[10:24:19] labelette: it should be actually like this in your case: bindkey ^e [10:24:19]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	brainwash	[10:24:32] but does screen even bind C-e? [10:24:32]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	labelette	[10:31:45] brainwash : this is what I thought this is strange has I don't think screen is using/binding it... it is like it does'nt pass the instruction to mutt [10:31:45]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	labelette	[10:32:27] any idea of the command should I try after bindkey ^e ?  [10:32:27]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	brainwash	[10:34:21] didn't bindkey ^e help? [10:34:21]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	brainwash	[10:34:50] I guess no [10:34:50]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	brainwash	[10:35:30] labelette: did you ask in the mutt channel? I assume that quite a few people run it inside screen [10:35:30]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	labelette	[10:37:57] brainwash: I will good suggestion [10:37:57]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	snfgf	[16:53:19] hello guys how do i log output from /dev/ttyUSB0? [16:53:19]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	rudi_s	[18:55:28] Log? screen /dev/ttyUSB0 $speed to attach, then log as usual. [18:55:28]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	rudi_s	[18:55:37] ^a H [18:55:37]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	two_oes	[09:56:38] Hi , does anyone knows a good tutorial for entering screen upon login ? [09:56:38]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	two_oes	[09:57:07] I need to setup screen to start as soon as the user login  [09:57:07]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	rudi_s	[10:26:12] two_oes: For another user or for yourself. You can put it in the shell config so it triggers on interactive logins (over SSH). Or you could set screen as user shell. [10:26:12]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	two_oes	[13:04:48] do you have an example for the screen config ? becuase you do need to set a few parameters [13:04:48]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	rudi_s	[13:05:16] two_oes: What parameters do you think you need? It should work even without any config. [13:05:16]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	two_oes	[13:07:26] setting it to run with logs for example [13:07:26]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	two_oes	[13:10:23] or checking to see if there is a session running and if there is connect to it  [13:10:23]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	rudi_s	[13:14:22] two_oes: man screen - and search for log. - The second can't be done in screenrc, you need to set that in the shell config. [13:14:22]

2016-11-01 11:35:24	labelette	hi, is there a way to get 'real' 256 colors in screen ? I realized that starting screen from my terminal in X is showing me all the colors but doing the same from virtual consoles (no X) no... I have term screen-256color in my screenrc but I must miss something ?
2016-11-01 11:36:27	-->	Darcidride (~Darcidrid@158.69.114.146) has joined #screen
2016-11-01 11:39:37	amade	labelette: afaik consoles only support 16 colors, they seem however to map 256 colors onto those 16
2016-11-01 11:40:50	labelette	amade: thank for your reply, do you know if there is a way to change console to 256 colors ?  (like changing the default term from linux to screen-256 for example?)
2016-11-01 11:42:37	amade	I don't think so
2016-11-01 11:43:00	amade	unless you use some other application to draw it
2016-11-01 11:43:29	amade	iirc some, like mlterm support console versions, but I haven;t tried those on consoles
2016-11-01 11:43:55	amade	you may also try to search internet for 'fbterm' as they seem t have some kind of private escape sequence
2016-11-01 11:44:15	amade	or kmscon
2016-11-01 11:45:22	labelette	amade: yep I saw something regarding fbterm but I don't catch yet how to do it
2016-11-01 11:45:22		[11:45]
2016-11-01 11:45:43	amade	kmscon seems like better idea to me
2016-11-01 11:46:46	labelette	amade : https://gist.github.com/dylon/5281572
2016-11-01 11:46:51	labelette	found something like this or similar
2016-11-01 11:48:17	amade	yeah, if it your shell detects login on any tty it just runs fbterm
2016-11-01 11:49:26	labelette	I am looking to your kmscon suggestion but I dont see 256colors support?
2016-11-01 11:49:54	amade	https://github.com/dvdhrm/kmscon/issues/94
2016-11-01 11:53:47	labelette	thanks but I am reading xterm compatible do you think the 256colors rendering is only on X ?

2016-11-01 11:55:31	amade	xterm compatible, means that it uses same escape codes
2016-11-01 11:56:38	labelette	ha ok!
2016-11-01 11:57:05	labelette	doyou have an idea of the diff between kmscon & fbterm?
2016-11-01 11:57:33	amade	nope

2016-11-02 00:56:16	brainwash	[09:46:43] oh wait [09:46:43]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	labelette	[10:23:13] brainwash: you think it is as simple ? should I unbind it? [10:23:13]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	brainwash	[10:24:19] labelette: it should be actually like this in your case: bindkey ^e [10:24:19]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	brainwash	[10:24:32] but does screen even bind C-e? [10:24:32]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	labelette	[10:31:45] brainwash : this is what I thought this is strange has I don't think screen is using/binding it... it is like it does'nt pass the instruction to mutt [10:31:45]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	labelette	[10:32:27] any idea of the command should I try after bindkey ^e ?  [10:32:27]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	brainwash	[10:34:21] didn't bindkey ^e help? [10:34:21]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	brainwash	[10:34:50] I guess no [10:34:50]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	brainwash	[10:35:30] labelette: did you ask in the mutt channel? I assume that quite a few people run it inside screen [10:35:30]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	labelette	[10:37:57] brainwash: I will good suggestion [10:37:57]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	snfgf	[16:53:19] hello guys how do i log output from /dev/ttyUSB0? [16:53:19]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	rudi_s	[18:55:28] Log? screen /dev/ttyUSB0 $speed to attach, then log as usual. [18:55:28]

2016-11-02 00:56:16	two_oes	[09:56:38] Hi , does anyone knows a good tutorial for entering screen upon login ? [09:56:38]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	two_oes	[09:57:07] I need to setup screen to start as soon as the user login  [09:57:07]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	rudi_s	[10:26:12] two_oes: For another user or for yourself. You can put it in the shell config so it triggers on interactive logins (over SSH). Or you could set screen as user shell. [10:26:12]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	two_oes	[13:04:48] do you have an example for the screen config ? becuase you do need to set a few parameters [13:04:48]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	rudi_s	[13:05:16] two_oes: What parameters do you think you need? It should work even without any config. [13:05:16]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	two_oes	[13:07:26] setting it to run with logs for example [13:07:26]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	two_oes	[13:10:23] or checking to see if there is a session running and if there is connect to it  [13:10:23]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	rudi_s	[13:14:22] two_oes: man screen - and search for log. - The second can't be done in screenrc, you need to set that in the shell config. [13:14:22]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	Tortoise	[21:10:52] Please stop fighting [21:10:52]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	labelette	[21:35:24] hi, is there a way to get 'real' 256 colors in screen ? I realized that starting screen from my terminal in X is showing me all the colors but doing the same from virtual consoles (no X) no... I have term screen-256color in my screenrc but I must miss something ? [21:35:24]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	amade	[21:39:37] labelette: afaik consoles only support 16 colors, they seem however to map 256 colors onto those 16 [21:39:37]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	labelette	[21:40:50] amade: thank for your reply, do you know if there is a way to change console to 256 colors ?  (like changing the default term from linux to screen-256 for example?) [21:40:50]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	amade	[21:42:37] I don't think so [21:42:37]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	amade	[21:43:00] unless you use some other application to draw it [21:43:00]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	amade	[21:43:29] iirc some, like mlterm support console versions, but I haven;t tried those on consoles [21:43:29]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	amade	[21:43:55] you may also try to search internet for 'fbterm' as they seem t have some kind of private escape sequence [21:43:55]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	amade	[21:44:15] or kmscon [21:44:15]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	labelette	[21:45:22] amade: yep I saw something regarding fbterm but I don't catch yet how to do it [21:45:22]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	amade	[21:45:43] kmscon seems like better idea to me [21:45:43]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	labelette	[21:46:46] amade : https://gist.github.com/dylon/5281572 [21:46:46]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	labelette	[21:46:51] found something like this or similar [21:46:51]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	amade	[21:48:17] yeah, if it your shell detects login on any tty it just runs fbterm [21:48:17]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	labelette	[21:49:26] I am looking to your kmscon suggestion but I dont see 256colors support? [21:49:26]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	amade	[21:49:54] https://github.com/dvdhrm/kmscon/issues/94 [21:49:54]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	labelette	[21:53:47] thanks but I am reading xterm compatible do you think the 256colors rendering is only on X ? [21:53:47]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	amade	[21:55:31] xterm compatible, means that it uses same escape codes [21:55:31]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	labelette	[21:56:38] ha ok! [21:56:38]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	labelette	[21:57:05] doyou have an idea of the diff between kmscon & fbterm? [21:57:05]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	amade	[21:57:33] nope [21:57:33]

2016-11-02 05:18:52	angry_vincent	does screen searching for screen.term, then screen, then vt100 for termcap?
2016-11-02 05:19:12	angry_vincent	where .term is taken from $TERM
2016-11-02 05:19:19	angry_vincent	if yes
2016-11-02 05:19:42	angry_vincent	how do i change this search order to make screen trying 'screen' first and only then screen.term
2016-11-02 05:19:48	angry_vincent	a problem is:
2016-11-02 05:20:27	angry_vincent	connecting to old boxes (like centos) which does not understand screen.* breaking ssh connections
2016-11-02 05:22:20	angry_vincent	i.e when connecting from box it takes $TERM from coneecting box

2016-11-02 12:00:59	angry_vincent	[15:18:52] does screen searching for screen.term, then screen, then vt100 for termcap? [15:18:52]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	angry_vincent	[15:19:12] where .term is taken from $TERM [15:19:12]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	angry_vincent	[15:19:19] if yes [15:19:19]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	angry_vincent	[15:19:42] how do i change this search order to make screen trying 'screen' first and only then screen.term [15:19:42]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	angry_vincent	[15:19:48] a problem is: [15:19:48]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	angry_vincent	[15:20:27] connecting to old boxes (like centos) which does not understand screen.* breaking ssh connections [15:20:27]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	angry_vincent	[15:22:20] i.e when connecting from box it takes $TERM from coneecting box [15:22:20]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	labelette	[16:55:28] brainwash : thanks for your comment [16:55:28]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	labelette	[16:56:03] brainwash: I have install it and it is working very well then as you said not sure if it is a good alternative if the project is dead... [16:56:03]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	labelette	[16:56:25] brainwash: I have been able to make 256colors work in pure terminal without X [16:56:25]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	brainwash	[16:56:50] labelette: I guess someone could take over kmscon, or already did that [16:56:50]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	brainwash	[16:57:22] well, I'll give it a try then [16:57:22]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	labelette	[16:57:26] brainwash: do you think fbterm is a better alternative? [16:57:26]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	brainwash	[16:57:51] I've used fbterm before [16:57:51]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	brainwash	[16:58:13] but not anymore [16:58:13]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	brainwash	[16:58:24] probably due to some bug or limitation [16:58:24]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	brainwash	[16:58:43] fbterm is not maintained anymore also I think [16:58:43]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	labelette	[16:58:56] the reason why I choose kmscom over fbterm is that I have been able to make it work in a minute but not fbterm [16:58:56]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	brainwash	[16:59:53] make it work? [16:59:53]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	brainwash	[17:00:10] you basically just start it [17:00:10]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	brainwash	[17:00:49] I don't recall applying any magic or so [17:00:49]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	brainwash	[17:00:52] :D [17:00:52]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	labelette	[17:01:11] I meant for fbterm to work with my systemd and work automatically and put all the virtual console correctly at the boot time [17:01:11]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	labelette	[17:01:15] ;) [17:01:15]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	brainwash	[17:01:24] ah [17:01:24]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	labelette	[17:01:47] and I found kmscon easy on this side [17:01:47]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	labelette	[17:02:13] (working with systemd and moving from getty to kmscon) [17:02:13]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	brainwash	[17:03:05] cool [17:03:05]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	brainwash	[17:03:30] kmscon has still not been packaged for debian/ubuntu [17:03:30]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	brainwash	[17:04:00] but now with it being a dead project it probably won't be packaged anymore [17:04:00]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	labelette	[17:09:23] it is bad as I found it work very well ! [17:09:23]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	labelette	[17:09:58] I have set my parabola to only use 3x tty with kmscon and no getty anymore [17:09:58]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	labelette	[17:10:34] I only got a remaining issue but not screen related I realized it is related of terminal in X vs. not in X very strange [17:10:34]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	labelette	[17:10:37] ... [17:10:37]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	labelette	[17:11:12] on xterm in X I can use arrow keys, Fn arrow keys and cntrl arrow key, for example up key is ^[[A fn up key is ^[[5~ and ctrl up key is ^[[1;5A but on terminal without X the fn up key is the same as X but up key and ctrl up key share the same ^[[A [17:11:12]

2016-11-03 22:49:42	brainwash	[09:00:36] labelette: "Latest commit 0b34527 on Jul 8, 2014" [09:00:36]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	angry_vincent	[15:18:02] hiya [15:18:02]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	angry_vincent	[15:18:52] does screen searching for screen.term, then screen, then vt100 for termcap? [15:18:52]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	angry_vincent	[15:19:12] where .term is taken from $TERM [15:19:12]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	angry_vincent	[15:19:19] if yes [15:19:19]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	angry_vincent	[15:19:42] how do i change this search order to make screen trying 'screen' first and only then screen.term [15:19:42]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	angry_vincent	[15:19:48] a problem is: [15:19:48]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	angry_vincent	[15:20:27] connecting to old boxes (like centos) which does not understand screen.* breaking ssh connections [15:20:27]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	angry_vincent	[15:22:20] i.e when connecting from box it takes $TERM from coneecting box [15:22:20]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	labelette	[16:55:28] brainwash : thanks for your comment [16:55:28]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	labelette	[16:56:03] brainwash: I have install it and it is working very well then as you said not sure if it is a good alternative if the project is dead... [16:56:03]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	labelette	[16:56:25] brainwash: I have been able to make 256colors work in pure terminal without X [16:56:25]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	brainwash	[16:56:50] labelette: I guess someone could take over kmscon, or already did that [16:56:50]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	brainwash	[16:57:22] well, I'll give it a try then [16:57:22]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	labelette	[16:57:26] brainwash: do you think fbterm is a better alternative? [16:57:26]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	brainwash	[16:57:51] I've used fbterm before [16:57:51]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	brainwash	[16:58:13] but not anymore [16:58:13]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	brainwash	[16:58:24] probably due to some bug or limitation [16:58:24]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	brainwash	[16:58:43] fbterm is not maintained anymore also I think [16:58:43]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	labelette	[16:58:56] the reason why I choose kmscom over fbterm is that I have been able to make it work in a minute but not fbterm [16:58:56]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	brainwash	[16:59:53] make it work? [16:59:53]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	brainwash	[17:00:10] you basically just start it [17:00:10]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	brainwash	[17:00:49] I don't recall applying any magic or so [17:00:49]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	brainwash	[17:00:52] :D [17:00:52]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	labelette	[17:01:11] I meant for fbterm to work with my systemd and work automatically and put all the virtual console correctly at the boot time [17:01:11]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	labelette	[17:01:15] ;) [17:01:15]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	brainwash	[17:01:24] ah [17:01:24]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	labelette	[17:01:47] and I found kmscon easy on this side [17:01:47]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	labelette	[17:02:13] (working with systemd and moving from getty to kmscon) [17:02:13]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	brainwash	[17:03:05] cool [17:03:05]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	brainwash	[17:03:30] kmscon has still not been packaged for debian/ubuntu [17:03:30]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	brainwash	[17:04:00] but now with it being a dead project it probably won't be packaged anymore [17:04:00]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	labelette	[17:09:23] it is bad as I found it work very well ! [17:09:23]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	labelette	[17:09:58] I have set my parabola to only use 3x tty with kmscon and no getty anymore [17:09:58]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	labelette	[17:10:34] I only got a remaining issue but not screen related I realized it is related of terminal in X vs. not in X very strange [17:10:34]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	labelette	[17:10:37] ... [17:10:37]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	labelette	[17:11:12] on xterm in X I can use arrow keys, Fn arrow keys and cntrl arrow key, for example up key is ^[[A fn up key is ^[[5~ and ctrl up key is ^[[1;5A but on terminal without X the fn up key is the same as X but up key and ctrl up key share the same ^[[A [17:11:12]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	zrts	[02:56:36] hi, is anyone here? [02:56:36]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	Necrosporus	[05:32:54] I want to connect two sessions on one computer in a way that when something typed in one side it appears in another and vice versa. I would like to use /dev/pts/ptmx. But in order to use virtual terminal, new file in /dev/pts/N must be unlocked first from master side. How to do it in screen? [05:32:54]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	Soliton	[09:29:33] just connect to the same screen session twice with -x? [09:29:33]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	Necrosporus	[09:35:12] It is possible but I actually want to work with program which expects a serial port [09:35:12]

2016-11-04 07:05:23	wq	I've used Screen version 4.00.03jw4 (FAU) 2-May-06 for many years but modern linux distros contain another versions that have a problem with a title: midnight commander and other programs overwrite the title. Is this solvable? Is this fixed in the most recent version ?

2016-11-04 07:15:48	RadoQ	You might make screen ignore title-requests-sequences.
2016-11-04 07:16:35	amade	problem with app changing title?
2016-11-04 07:16:46	amade	there will be option for that in next release

2016-11-04 07:17:15	RadoQ	Couldn't you just remove the termcap value for title-ing?
2016-11-04 07:18:31	amade	well, I find it more useful this way
2016-11-04 07:18:55	amade	usually what I want is to know what's running in windows, but sometimes you want to lock title
2016-11-04 07:19:47	amade	also, I don't think that removing sequence from terminfo would make it instantly ignored
2016-11-04 07:20:25	amade	most of them are hardcoded in ansi.c
2016-11-04 07:20:25		[07:20]
2016-11-04 07:21:23	amade	changing stuff in terminfo would only work for some things, where app may decide what kind of information to send to screen, or for screen to decide if it should pass it up to terminal emulator
2016-11-04 07:27:00		[07:21]
2016-11-04 07:28:15	wq	amade: I'm not sure this is exactly what I want. This is how I set Konsole title: "hardstatus string '[%H: %w] %h'". So MC shows current directory via %h. I just want to keep this behaviour.
2016-11-04 07:32:53	wq	like this Konsole title:
2016-11-04 07:32:55	wq	[wqlaptop: 0 bash 1 irssi 2* logs] mc [wq@wqlaptop]:/var/log - Konsole
2016-11-04 07:38:00		[07:32]

2016-11-04 07:44:00		[07:38]
2016-11-04 07:45:19	wq	my title becomes:
2016-11-04 07:45:25	wq	mc [wq@wqlaptop]:/var/log - Konsole
2016-11-04 07:46:15	wq	btw, if i press C-a C-a, it becomes "screen - Konsole"
2016-11-04 07:46:38	amade	oh... yes, it might be overwritten by escape sequence from app...
2016-11-04 07:48:38	amade	which version of screen do you have?
2016-11-04 07:49:11	amade	and what system?
2016-11-04 07:50:52	amade	although second one seems somewhat correct, so I'm bit confused
2016-11-04 07:51:15	amade	what's your TERM valu inside and outside screen?
2016-11-04 07:57:00		[07:51]
2016-11-04 07:58:06	wq	1. I want '[%H: %w] ' part not to be changed ever. (Except changes in %w, like new windows, etc).
2016-11-04 07:58:14	wq	2. TERM=screen
2016-11-04 07:58:31	wq	3. TERM=xterm
2016-11-04 07:59:12	wq	4. Good behaviour is in Ubuntu 12.04. Not good is in Ubuntu 16.04.
2016-11-04 07:59:55	wq	actually it was broken in 14.04 too, I can't remember if there's any difference from 16.04
2016-11-04 08:00:14	amade	ubuntu... well it has a lot of additional stuff in bashrc, so it may mess with titles
2016-11-04 08:00:33	wq	you mean /etc/bashrc ?
2016-11-04 08:00:45	amade	also you can try setting TERM to konsole
2016-11-04 08:01:15	amade	ye... from what I know on ubuntu it takes stuff from prompt to put it into title
2016-11-04 08:01:58	wq	I'll try simple value of PS1
2016-11-04 08:02:42	wq	well it doesn't seem complicated: PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ '
2016-11-04 08:04:55	wq	hmm. it was complicated in 12.04
2016-11-04 08:08:11	amade	can you paste /etc/bashrc somewhere? I don't have ubuntu system at hand right now
2016-11-04 08:09:10	amade	also, have you tried with some other terminal emulator apart from konsole?
2016-11-04 08:10:33	wq	Anyway. I don't understand, why the title becomes "screen - Konsole". It is definitely behaviour of screen itself and it is not '[%H: %w] %h'
2016-11-04 08:10:39	wq	http://termbin.com/csg7 is /etc/bash.bashrc
2016-11-04 08:11:11	wq	on 16.04.1

2016-11-04 14:11:04	wq	[18:15:36] just in case, I use konsole in ubuntu 14.04, not 16.04. My 16.04 doesn't have X yet. [18:15:36]
2016-11-04 14:11:04	amade	[18:16:08] well seems to work fine in my konsole... [18:16:08]
2016-11-04 14:11:04	wq	[18:18:29] Tab title format: %w [18:18:29]

2016-11-04 14:11:04	amade	[18:19:05] but it seems to be for tabs, not whole window? [18:19:05]
2016-11-04 14:11:04	amade	[18:19:48] whole window option seems to be in Settings > Configure konsole... [18:19:48]
2016-11-04 14:11:05	amade	[18:20:10] there is 'show window title on the titlebar' option [18:20:10]

2016-11-04 14:11:05	wq	[18:27:56] what is your distro and what is your preferrable terminal program? [18:27:56]
2016-11-04 14:11:05	amade	[18:28:02] seems like they moved from version 4 straight to 14 [18:28:02]

2016-11-04 14:11:05	amade	[18:30:05] in 2 years they could've changed lots of stuff, so it may explain why it works in my version [18:30:05]
2016-11-04 14:11:05	amade	[18:31:15] anyway it seems more like problem with konsole, not screen [18:31:15]
2016-11-04 14:11:05	amade	[18:32:02] maybe try some other characters instead of [] [18:32:02]

2016-11-04 14:11:05	canvon	[18:34:30] Or this: ( /bin/bash) [18:34:30]
2016-11-04 14:11:05	canvon	[18:34:32] seems wrong? [18:34:32]

2016-11-04 14:11:05	amade	[18:36:28] most windows by default are bash [18:36:28]
2016-11-04 14:11:05	canvon	[18:36:31] it begins with a space, and has no space between command name and argument [18:36:31]
2016-11-04 14:11:05	amade	[18:36:52] oh [18:36:52]

2016-11-04 14:11:06	canvon	[18:42:44] yeah [18:42:44]
2016-11-04 14:11:06	canvon	[18:43:35] are you screen upstream? will you make the change? [18:43:35]

2016-11-04 16:45:24	amade	[18:11:56] - Konsole part is added by konsole [18:11:56]
2016-11-04 16:45:24	amade	[18:12:04] you can disable it somewhere in settings [18:12:04]

2016-11-04 16:45:24	wq	[18:13:20] Wow. It works well in PuTTY. [18:13:20]

2016-11-04 16:45:24	wq	[18:15:36] just in case, I use konsole in ubuntu 14.04, not 16.04. My 16.04 doesn't have X yet. [18:15:36]
2016-11-04 16:45:24	amade	[18:16:08] well seems to work fine in my konsole... [18:16:08]

2016-11-05 00:17:24	wq	[18:11:28] i'll try PuTTY [18:11:28]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	amade	[18:11:56] - Konsole part is added by konsole [18:11:56]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	amade	[18:12:04] you can disable it somewhere in settings [18:12:04]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	amade	[18:12:29] but yea, problem is screen part [18:12:29]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	wq	[18:13:20] Wow. It works well in PuTTY. [18:13:20]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	wq	[18:14:06] even though TERM=xterm in PuTTY too. [18:14:06]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	amade	[18:14:21] hm... right it also didn't seem that broken in xterm [18:14:21]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	amade	[18:14:32] finished installing konsole, so let's check [18:14:32]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	wq	[18:15:36] just in case, I use konsole in ubuntu 14.04, not 16.04. My 16.04 doesn't have X yet. [18:15:36]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	amade	[18:16:08] well seems to work fine in my konsole... [18:16:08]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	wq	[18:18:29] Tab title format: %w [18:18:29]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	wq	[18:18:29] Remote tab title format: %w [18:18:29]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	amade	[18:18:48] %d : %n [18:18:48]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	amade	[18:18:52] (%u) %H [18:18:52]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	amade	[18:19:05] but it seems to be for tabs, not whole window? [18:19:05]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	amade	[18:19:48] whole window option seems to be in Settings > Configure konsole... [18:19:48]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	amade	[18:20:10] there is 'show window title on the titlebar' option [18:20:10]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	amade	[18:22:24] my konsole is: Version 16.08.2 [18:22:24]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	wq	[18:23:07] ??? my is 2.13.2 [18:23:07]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	wq	[18:24:15] though the version of the package is 4:4.13.3-0ubuntu0.1 [18:24:15]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	amade	[18:26:02] hm... well I'm not sure what kind of versioning system they use ;) [18:26:02]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	wq	[18:27:56] what is your distro and what is your preferrable terminal program? [18:27:56]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	amade	[18:28:02] seems like they moved from version 4 straight to 14 [18:28:02]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	amade	[18:28:16] https://quickgit.kde.org/?p=konsole.git&a=tags [18:28:16]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	amade	[18:30:05] in 2 years they could've changed lots of stuff, so it may explain why it works in my version [18:30:05]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	amade	[18:31:15] anyway it seems more like problem with konsole, not screen [18:31:15]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	amade	[18:32:02] maybe try some other characters instead of [] [18:32:02]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	canvon	[18:34:12] As a result of reading this here, I'm experimenting with screen escapes for caption (last line) and hardstatus (terminal emulator window title), again. [18:34:12]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	canvon	[18:34:18] But this: (%x) [18:34:18]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	canvon	[18:34:23] Gives this: ( sshvm-initia) [18:34:23]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	canvon	[18:34:30] Or this: ( /bin/bash) [18:34:30]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	canvon	[18:34:32] seems wrong? [18:34:32]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	canvon	[18:35:04] Screen version 4.04.00 (GNU) 19-Jun-16  (Debian 4.4.0-4) [18:35:04]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	amade	[18:36:16] canvon: what is wrong with it? according to manpage:  x      the executed command including arguments running in this windows [18:36:16]
2016-11-05 00:17:24	amade	[18:36:28] most windows by default are bash [18:36:28]
