2016-10-22 08:40:07	Elronnd	sometimes one of my screens will freeze up and I have to ^a^k it and make a new one.  Is there a way to stop this from happenning?

2016-10-22 09:01:29	amade	Elronnd: maybe you accidentally press ^s  or ^a + s
2016-10-22 09:04:37	amade	^s can be disabled in your parent shell with stty -ixon, ^a + s needs to be unbound in screenrc
2016-10-22 09:04:52	amade	you can also manually resume with ^q or ^a + q
2016-10-22 09:05:25	amade	search for xon xoff for more info
2016-10-22 09:06:06	Elronnd	I know it wasn't ^s, because ^q didn't fix it
2016-10-22 09:06:25	Elronnd	^a s could definitely have happeened
2016-10-22 09:06:28	Elronnd	thanks

2016-10-24 22:59:42	Elronnd	[16:35:18] how can I change the command screen uses? [16:35:18]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Elronnd	[16:35:59] e.g. so I use ^m instead of ^a [16:35:59]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Soliton	[16:36:38] screen -e ^Mm [16:36:38]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Elronnd	[16:37:43] can I set it in the config? [16:37:43]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Soliton	[16:38:18] sure, see the escape command. [16:38:18]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Elronnd	[16:38:33] oh, huh [16:38:33]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Elronnd	[16:38:48] apparently ^m is enter [16:38:48]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Elronnd	[16:38:52] damn [16:38:52]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	amade	[16:40:01] yea, I use it all the time on my laptop, which lost it's enter key [16:40:01]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Elronnd	[18:40:07] sometimes one of my screens will freeze up and I have to ^a^k it and make a new one.  Is there a way to stop this from happenning? [18:40:07]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	amade	[19:01:29] Elronnd: maybe you accidentally press ^s  or ^a + s [19:01:29]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	amade	[19:04:36] ^s can be disabled in your parent shell with stty -ixon, ^a + s needs to be unbound in screenrc [19:04:36]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	amade	[19:04:52] you can also manually resume with ^q or ^a + q [19:04:52]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	amade	[19:05:25] search for xon xoff for more info [19:05:25]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Elronnd	[19:06:06] I know it wasn't ^s, because ^q didn't fix it [19:06:06]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Elronnd	[19:06:25] ^a s could definitely have happeened [19:06:25]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Elronnd	[19:06:28] thanks [19:06:28]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	amade	[19:06:44] yeah, that's screen equivalent [19:06:44]

2016-10-24 23:19:19	Elronnd	[16:38:48] apparently ^m is enter [16:38:48]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	Elronnd	[16:38:52] damn [16:38:52]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	amade	[16:40:01] yea, I use it all the time on my laptop, which lost it's enter key [16:40:01]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	Elronnd	[18:40:07] sometimes one of my screens will freeze up and I have to ^a^k it and make a new one.  Is there a way to stop this from happenning? [18:40:07]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	amade	[19:01:29] Elronnd: maybe you accidentally press ^s  or ^a + s [19:01:29]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	amade	[19:04:36] ^s can be disabled in your parent shell with stty -ixon, ^a + s needs to be unbound in screenrc [19:04:36]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	amade	[19:04:52] you can also manually resume with ^q or ^a + q [19:04:52]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	amade	[19:05:25] search for xon xoff for more info [19:05:25]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	Elronnd	[19:06:06] I know it wasn't ^s, because ^q didn't fix it [19:06:06]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	Elronnd	[19:06:25] ^a s could definitely have happeened [19:06:25]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	Elronnd	[19:06:28] thanks [19:06:28]
2016-10-24 23:19:20	amade	[19:06:44] yeah, that's screen equivalent [19:06:44]

2016-10-25 11:42:09	then4116	[16:56:02] brainwash: found out that screen -X or -Q failing because of the password does not result in a non-zero exit value (which is what I need), but results in a message displayed within screen (which is what I don't want) [16:56:02]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	skered	[13:12:42] Can you make to so external programs can't update the screen title? [13:12:42]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	ski	[14:03:44] the window title (aka) ? the (window) hardstatus line ? [14:03:44]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	skered	[15:05:20] window title [15:05:20]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	skered	[15:05:37] er sorry yeah the window title in the hardstatus line [15:05:37]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	skered	[15:05:52] What gets updated with <esc>:title name [15:05:52]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	skered	[15:22:52] RHEL7 likes to do this. [15:22:52]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	skered	[15:23:14] I'm sure it can be fixed on the system but would rather disable it screen [15:23:14]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	amade	[15:27:43] will add some switch, also was annoyed by this few times [15:27:43]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	amade	[15:28:23] something like dynamictitle, so you can enable/disable it for one window and defdynamictitle for global setting [15:28:23]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	ski	[15:31:05] skered : remove `%t' from your hardstatus line format ? [15:31:05]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	amade	[15:31:38] I don't think that stops title from being changed? [15:31:38]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	 *	ski [15:31:50] supposes skered wants to see the user-set titles [15:31:50]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	 *	ski [15:33:00] idly wonders which programs (knows about and) changes the Screen window title [15:33:00]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	skered	[15:33:00] Yeah, that isn't the best solution becaues I want to see the title [15:33:00]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	skered	[15:33:41] But I don't want screen to react to escape sequences that would update titles [15:33:41]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	skered	[15:33:58] ski: There's a lot... and almost anything can. [15:33:58]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	 *	ski [15:34:32] can't remember any [15:34:32]

2016-10-25 11:42:09	Elronnd	[16:35:18] how can I change the command screen uses? [16:35:18]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	Elronnd	[16:35:59] e.g. so I use ^m instead of ^a [16:35:59]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	Soliton	[16:36:38] screen -e ^Mm [16:36:38]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	Elronnd	[16:37:43] can I set it in the config? [16:37:43]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	Soliton	[16:38:18] sure, see the escape command. [16:38:18]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	Elronnd	[16:38:33] oh, huh [16:38:33]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	Elronnd	[16:38:48] apparently ^m is enter [16:38:48]

2016-10-25 11:47:22	then4116	[16:56:02] brainwash: found out that screen -X or -Q failing because of the password does not result in a non-zero exit value (which is what I need), but results in a message displayed within screen (which is what I don't want) [16:56:02]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	skered	[13:12:42] Can you make to so external programs can't update the screen title? [13:12:42]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	ski	[14:03:44] the window title (aka) ? the (window) hardstatus line ? [14:03:44]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	skered	[15:05:20] window title [15:05:20]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	skered	[15:05:37] er sorry yeah the window title in the hardstatus line [15:05:37]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	skered	[15:05:52] What gets updated with <esc>:title name [15:05:52]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	skered	[15:22:52] RHEL7 likes to do this. [15:22:52]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	skered	[15:23:14] I'm sure it can be fixed on the system but would rather disable it screen [15:23:14]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	amade	[15:27:43] will add some switch, also was annoyed by this few times [15:27:43]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	amade	[15:28:23] something like dynamictitle, so you can enable/disable it for one window and defdynamictitle for global setting [15:28:23]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	ski	[15:31:05] skered : remove `%t' from your hardstatus line format ? [15:31:05]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	amade	[15:31:38] I don't think that stops title from being changed? [15:31:38]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	 *	ski [15:31:50] supposes skered wants to see the user-set titles [15:31:50]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	 *	ski [15:33:00] idly wonders which programs (knows about and) changes the Screen window title [15:33:00]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	skered	[15:33:00] Yeah, that isn't the best solution becaues I want to see the title [15:33:00]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	skered	[15:33:41] But I don't want screen to react to escape sequences that would update titles [15:33:41]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	skered	[15:33:58] ski: There's a lot... and almost anything can. [15:33:58]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	 *	ski [15:34:32] can't remember any [15:34:32]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	ski	[15:34:46] (i've noticed some change the hardstatus line, though) [15:34:46]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	amade	[16:27:13] skered: http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/screen.git/commit/?h=screen-v4&id=84f65b5a70d0c3de1b87590a8fb5610d183a45b3  will be in next release [16:27:13]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	Elronnd	[16:35:18] how can I change the command screen uses? [16:35:18]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	Elronnd	[16:35:59] e.g. so I use ^m instead of ^a [16:35:59]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	Soliton	[16:36:38] screen -e ^Mm [16:36:38]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	Elronnd	[16:37:43] can I set it in the config? [16:37:43]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	Soliton	[16:38:18] sure, see the escape command. [16:38:18]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	Elronnd	[16:38:33] oh, huh [16:38:33]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	Elronnd	[16:38:48] apparently ^m is enter [16:38:48]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	Elronnd	[16:38:52] damn [16:38:52]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	amade	[16:40:01] yea, I use it all the time on my laptop, which lost it's enter key [16:40:01]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	Elronnd	[18:40:07] sometimes one of my screens will freeze up and I have to ^a^k it and make a new one.  Is there a way to stop this from happenning? [18:40:07]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	amade	[19:01:29] Elronnd: maybe you accidentally press ^s  or ^a + s [19:01:29]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	amade	[19:04:36] ^s can be disabled in your parent shell with stty -ixon, ^a + s needs to be unbound in screenrc [19:04:36]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	amade	[19:04:52] you can also manually resume with ^q or ^a + q [19:04:52]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	amade	[19:05:25] search for xon xoff for more info [19:05:25]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	Elronnd	[19:06:06] I know it wasn't ^s, because ^q didn't fix it [19:06:06]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	Elronnd	[19:06:25] ^a s could definitely have happeened [19:06:25]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	Elronnd	[19:06:28] thanks [19:06:28]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	amade	[19:06:44] yeah, that's screen equivalent [19:06:44]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	sloth	[10:54:46] armageddon was a better movie than deep impact, discuss [10:54:46]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	Elronnd	[18:29:07] request: < + 3 as a digraph for ♥ [18:29:07]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	amade	[18:43:11] Elronnd: well, plan is to allow users to define their own digraphs [18:43:11]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	Elronnd	[18:43:48] yes, but how likely is that to actually happen? [18:43:48]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	amade	[18:44:45] well it's not that hard to implement, only problem as with everything is time :) [18:44:45]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	Elronnd	[18:45:03] do it, then! [18:45:03]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	ayee_	[21:12:09] Cannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/0' - please check. [21:12:09]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	ayee_	[21:12:27] I have a user I don't want to be able to ssh in as, but I want them to be able to use screen [21:12:27]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	ayee_	[21:12:35] How can I give this user permissions to use screen? [21:12:35]
2016-10-25 11:47:23	ayee_	[21:24:25] I can see in my ps output, /dev/pt/0 and 2 don't have permissions for this user, they're owned by another user [21:24:25]

2016-10-25 15:33:50	skered	[15:22:52] RHEL7 likes to do this. [15:22:52]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	skered	[15:23:14] I'm sure it can be fixed on the system but would rather disable it screen [15:23:14]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[15:27:43] will add some switch, also was annoyed by this few times [15:27:43]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[15:28:23] something like dynamictitle, so you can enable/disable it for one window and defdynamictitle for global setting [15:28:23]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	ski	[15:31:05] skered : remove `%t' from your hardstatus line format ? [15:31:05]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[15:31:38] I don't think that stops title from being changed? [15:31:38]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	 *	ski [15:31:50] supposes skered wants to see the user-set titles [15:31:50]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	 *	ski [15:33:00] idly wonders which programs (knows about and) changes the Screen window title [15:33:00]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	skered	[15:33:00] Yeah, that isn't the best solution becaues I want to see the title [15:33:00]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	skered	[15:33:41] But I don't want screen to react to escape sequences that would update titles [15:33:41]

2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[16:35:18] how can I change the command screen uses? [16:35:18]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[16:35:59] e.g. so I use ^m instead of ^a [16:35:59]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Soliton	[16:36:38] screen -e ^Mm [16:36:38]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[16:37:43] can I set it in the config? [16:37:43]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Soliton	[16:38:18] sure, see the escape command. [16:38:18]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[16:38:33] oh, huh [16:38:33]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[16:38:48] apparently ^m is enter [16:38:48]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[16:38:52] damn [16:38:52]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[16:40:01] yea, I use it all the time on my laptop, which lost it's enter key [16:40:01]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[18:40:07] sometimes one of my screens will freeze up and I have to ^a^k it and make a new one.  Is there a way to stop this from happenning? [18:40:07]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[19:01:29] Elronnd: maybe you accidentally press ^s  or ^a + s [19:01:29]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[19:04:36] ^s can be disabled in your parent shell with stty -ixon, ^a + s needs to be unbound in screenrc [19:04:36]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[19:04:52] you can also manually resume with ^q or ^a + q [19:04:52]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[19:05:25] search for xon xoff for more info [19:05:25]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[19:06:06] I know it wasn't ^s, because ^q didn't fix it [19:06:06]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[19:06:25] ^a s could definitely have happeened [19:06:25]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[19:06:28] thanks [19:06:28]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[19:06:44] yeah, that's screen equivalent [19:06:44]

2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[18:43:11] Elronnd: well, plan is to allow users to define their own digraphs [18:43:11]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[18:43:48] yes, but how likely is that to actually happen? [18:43:48]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	amade	[18:44:45] well it's not that hard to implement, only problem as with everything is time :) [18:44:45]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	Elronnd	[18:45:03] do it, then! [18:45:03]

2016-10-25 15:33:50	ayee_	[21:12:35] How can I give this user permissions to use screen? [21:12:35]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	ayee_	[21:24:25] I can see in my ps output, /dev/pt/0 and 2 don't have permissions for this user, they're owned by another user [21:24:25]

2016-10-26 09:43:43	Elronnd	[16:35:59] e.g. so I use ^m instead of ^a [16:35:59]

2016-10-26 09:43:43	amade	[16:40:01] yea, I use it all the time on my laptop, which lost it's enter key [16:40:01]

2016-10-26 09:43:43	ayee_	[21:12:27] I have a user I don't want to be able to ssh in as, but I want them to be able to use screen [21:12:27]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	ayee_	[21:12:35] How can I give this user permissions to use screen? [21:12:35]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	ayee_	[21:24:25] I can see in my ps output, /dev/pt/0 and 2 don't have permissions for this user, they're owned by another user [21:24:25]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	peeps[lappy]	[02:51:21] hello, what determines if nested screens display their window bar at the bottom.  i run screen, ssh into another box, run screen on that, and i could have sworn there was a bar at the bottom for each, but just now I tried it and the inner screen has no bar [02:51:21]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	peeps[lappy]	[02:52:35] the outer screen is technically byobu [02:52:35]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	peeps[lappy]	[02:55:39] inner screen: Screen version 4.01.00devel (GNU) 2-May-06 [02:55:39]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	peeps[lappy]	[02:58:26] its running on a beaglebone board (armv7l), running debian wheezy 7.11 [02:58:26]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	peeps[lappy]	[03:00:51] oh, anyways, byobu -v reports the same screen version after it's own version#, on a separate line: "byobu version 5.74", "Screen version 4.01.00devel (GNU) 2-May-06" [03:00:51]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	peeps[lappy]	[03:01:37] thats on my laptop, x86 [03:01:37]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	peeps[lappy]	[03:10:41] also, on the beaglebone, using ps i can see a process that i thought i started in screen, but it has no window. is there some way it could have been "orphaned" and is there a way to connect to that process to see its stdout etc. [03:10:41]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	peeps[lappy]	[03:11:45] there is no other screen to detach or resume [03:11:45]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	peeps[lappy]	[03:45:22] wow, nevermind.  i just realized i had called byobu previously on the beaglebone, not realizing that it uses a tmux backend on that system.  i had no idea some byobu used tmux sometimes.  anyways i was able to reattach, so problem solved [03:45:22]

2016-10-26 12:54:20	peeps[lappy]	[02:51:21] hello, what determines if nested screens display their window bar at the bottom.  i run screen, ssh into another box, run screen on that, and i could have sworn there was a bar at the bottom for each, but just now I tried it and the inner screen has no bar [02:51:21]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	peeps[lappy]	[02:52:35] the outer screen is technically byobu [02:52:35]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	peeps[lappy]	[02:55:39] inner screen: Screen version 4.01.00devel (GNU) 2-May-06 [02:55:39]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	peeps[lappy]	[02:58:26] its running on a beaglebone board (armv7l), running debian wheezy 7.11 [02:58:26]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	peeps[lappy]	[03:00:51] oh, anyways, byobu -v reports the same screen version after it's own version#, on a separate line: "byobu version 5.74", "Screen version 4.01.00devel (GNU) 2-May-06" [03:00:51]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	peeps[lappy]	[03:01:37] thats on my laptop, x86 [03:01:37]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	peeps[lappy]	[03:10:41] also, on the beaglebone, using ps i can see a process that i thought i started in screen, but it has no window. is there some way it could have been "orphaned" and is there a way to connect to that process to see its stdout etc. [03:10:41]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	peeps[lappy]	[03:11:45] there is no other screen to detach or resume [03:11:45]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	peeps[lappy]	[03:45:22] wow, nevermind.  i just realized i had called byobu previously on the beaglebone, not realizing that it uses a tmux backend on that system.  i had no idea some byobu used tmux sometimes.  anyways i was able to reattach, so problem solved [03:45:22]

2016-10-27 17:07:26	skered	[15:23:14] I'm sure it can be fixed on the system but would rather disable it screen [15:23:14]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[15:27:43] will add some switch, also was annoyed by this few times [15:27:43]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[15:28:23] something like dynamictitle, so you can enable/disable it for one window and defdynamictitle for global setting [15:28:23]

2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[15:31:38] I don't think that stops title from being changed? [15:31:38]

2016-10-27 17:07:26	skered	[15:33:00] Yeah, that isn't the best solution becaues I want to see the title [15:33:00]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	skered	[15:33:41] But I don't want screen to react to escape sequences that would update titles [15:33:41]

2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[16:35:59] e.g. so I use ^m instead of ^a [16:35:59]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Soliton	[16:36:38] screen -e ^Mm [16:36:38]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[16:37:43] can I set it in the config? [16:37:43]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Soliton	[16:38:18] sure, see the escape command. [16:38:18]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[16:38:33] oh, huh [16:38:33]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[16:38:48] apparently ^m is enter [16:38:48]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[16:38:52] damn [16:38:52]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[16:40:01] yea, I use it all the time on my laptop, which lost it's enter key [16:40:01]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[18:40:07] sometimes one of my screens will freeze up and I have to ^a^k it and make a new one.  Is there a way to stop this from happenning? [18:40:07]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[19:01:29] Elronnd: maybe you accidentally press ^s  or ^a + s [19:01:29]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[19:04:36] ^s can be disabled in your parent shell with stty -ixon, ^a + s needs to be unbound in screenrc [19:04:36]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[19:04:52] you can also manually resume with ^q or ^a + q [19:04:52]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[19:05:25] search for xon xoff for more info [19:05:25]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[19:06:06] I know it wasn't ^s, because ^q didn't fix it [19:06:06]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[19:06:25] ^a s could definitely have happeened [19:06:25]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[19:06:28] thanks [19:06:28]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[19:06:44] yeah, that's screen equivalent [19:06:44]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	sloth	[10:54:46] armageddon was a better movie than deep impact, discuss [10:54:46]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[18:29:07] request: < + 3 as a digraph for ♥ [18:29:07]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[18:43:11] Elronnd: well, plan is to allow users to define their own digraphs [18:43:11]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[18:43:48] yes, but how likely is that to actually happen? [18:43:48]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	amade	[18:44:45] well it's not that hard to implement, only problem as with everything is time :) [18:44:45]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	Elronnd	[18:45:03] do it, then! [18:45:03]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	ayee_	[21:12:09] Cannot open your terminal '/dev/pts/0' - please check. [21:12:09]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	ayee_	[21:12:27] I have a user I don't want to be able to ssh in as, but I want them to be able to use screen [21:12:27]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	ayee_	[21:12:35] How can I give this user permissions to use screen? [21:12:35]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	ayee_	[21:24:25] I can see in my ps output, /dev/pt/0 and 2 don't have permissions for this user, they're owned by another user [21:24:25]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	peeps[lappy]	[02:51:21] hello, what determines if nested screens display their window bar at the bottom.  i run screen, ssh into another box, run screen on that, and i could have sworn there was a bar at the bottom for each, but just now I tried it and the inner screen has no bar [02:51:21]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	peeps[lappy]	[02:52:35] the outer screen is technically byobu [02:52:35]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	peeps[lappy]	[02:55:39] inner screen: Screen version 4.01.00devel (GNU) 2-May-06 [02:55:39]
2016-10-27 17:07:26	peeps[lappy]	[02:58:26] its running on a beaglebone board (armv7l), running debian wheezy 7.11 [02:58:26]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	peeps[lappy]	[03:00:51] oh, anyways, byobu -v reports the same screen version after it's own version#, on a separate line: "byobu version 5.74", "Screen version 4.01.00devel (GNU) 2-May-06" [03:00:51]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	peeps[lappy]	[03:01:37] thats on my laptop, x86 [03:01:37]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	peeps[lappy]	[03:10:41] also, on the beaglebone, using ps i can see a process that i thought i started in screen, but it has no window. is there some way it could have been "orphaned" and is there a way to connect to that process to see its stdout etc. [03:10:41]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	peeps[lappy]	[03:11:45] there is no other screen to detach or resume [03:11:45]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	peeps[lappy]	[03:45:22] wow, nevermind.  i just realized i had called byobu previously on the beaglebone, not realizing that it uses a tmux backend on that system.  i had no idea some byobu used tmux sometimes.  anyways i was able to reattach, so problem solved [03:45:22]

2016-10-27 22:29:50	ski	[15:31:05] skered : remove `%t' from your hardstatus line format ? [15:31:05]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	amade	[15:31:38] I don't think that stops title from being changed? [15:31:38]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	 *	ski [15:31:50] supposes skered wants to see the user-set titles [15:31:50]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	 *	ski [15:33:00] idly wonders which programs (knows about and) changes the Screen window title [15:33:00]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	skered	[15:33:00] Yeah, that isn't the best solution becaues I want to see the title [15:33:00]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	skered	[15:33:41] But I don't want screen to react to escape sequences that would update titles [15:33:41]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	skered	[15:33:58] ski: There's a lot... and almost anything can. [15:33:58]

2016-10-27 22:29:50	Elronnd	[16:35:18] how can I change the command screen uses? [16:35:18]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Elronnd	[16:35:59] e.g. so I use ^m instead of ^a [16:35:59]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Soliton	[16:36:38] screen -e ^Mm [16:36:38]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Elronnd	[16:37:43] can I set it in the config? [16:37:43]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Soliton	[16:38:18] sure, see the escape command. [16:38:18]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Elronnd	[16:38:33] oh, huh [16:38:33]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Elronnd	[16:38:48] apparently ^m is enter [16:38:48]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Elronnd	[16:38:52] damn [16:38:52]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	amade	[16:40:01] yea, I use it all the time on my laptop, which lost it's enter key [16:40:01]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Elronnd	[18:40:07] sometimes one of my screens will freeze up and I have to ^a^k it and make a new one.  Is there a way to stop this from happenning? [18:40:07]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	amade	[19:01:29] Elronnd: maybe you accidentally press ^s  or ^a + s [19:01:29]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	amade	[19:04:36] ^s can be disabled in your parent shell with stty -ixon, ^a + s needs to be unbound in screenrc [19:04:36]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	amade	[19:04:52] you can also manually resume with ^q or ^a + q [19:04:52]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	amade	[19:05:25] search for xon xoff for more info [19:05:25]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Elronnd	[19:06:06] I know it wasn't ^s, because ^q didn't fix it [19:06:06]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Elronnd	[19:06:25] ^a s could definitely have happeened [19:06:25]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Elronnd	[19:06:28] thanks [19:06:28]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	amade	[19:06:44] yeah, that's screen equivalent [19:06:44]

2016-10-28 11:26:21	peeps[lappy]	[03:45:22] wow, nevermind.  i just realized i had called byobu previously on the beaglebone, not realizing that it uses a tmux backend on that system.  i had no idea some byobu used tmux sometimes.  anyways i was able to reattach, so problem solved [03:45:22]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[07:26:51] is there a way to run a subprocess on a detached screen? i.e. if I were attached to a serial screen, I might ^a : and then type "exec !! sx file.txt" to send a file.  [07:26:51]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[07:26:56] If I wanted to just send some text to a detached screen I would do somethign like screen -S detachedScreen -p 0 -X stuff "sometext" [07:26:56]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[07:27:08] I'd like to do somethign like screen -S detachedScreen -p 0 -X exec !! sx txFile [07:27:08]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[08:48:22] what prevents you from doing that? [08:48:22]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	labelette	[09:09:29] hi, I have an issue with mutt into gnuscreen,I read some other related topic but unable to make it work. mutt gets confuse when scrolling into email and my sidebar gets overwritten&black,another thing is on the message list the selection color (blue in my case) doesnt select all the line but only the words any idea?(using term xterm-256color in my screenrc I tried screen-256color-s but not better) [09:09:29]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[14:00:11] Soliton: I've tried that (screen -S detachedScreen -p 0 -X exec !! sx txFile) but as far as I can make out, the command doesn't get executed. i.e. attaching to the screen I see no evidence of it trying to send the file, and of couse no evidence of a file being received on the other end. [14:00:11]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:43:24] gnac: looks like you need to explicitely select a window if you've never attached. there is no current window on a never attached screen and exec only works for the current window. [19:43:24]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:44:43] gnac: i suppose one could argue that -p not working as expected here is a bug. [19:44:43]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:45:35] Soliton: I escaped the !! so \!\! and that worked better, but then I received a message in my receiver terminal about exec sx not existing or some such. [19:45:35]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:46:27] The goal is to be able to script sending a file. I had been successful gettign screen to send it using exec !! sx .. while attached. Now I'm trying to see if I can do it while detached. [19:46:27]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:46:32] if the shell you issued the command from has history expansion on you need to escape !, yeah. [19:46:32]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:47:09] Yeah, that explained the weirdness I was seeing in the exection.  [19:47:09]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:48:20] exec sx not existing sounds like a quoting error. [19:48:20]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:48:49] Should I try quoting the entire thing? or just sx? [19:48:49]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:49:11] what is the command you have now? [19:49:11]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:50:07] I"ve tried screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \\!\\! sx txFile and screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx txFile [19:50:07]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:50:42] the latter looks good. [19:50:42]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:51:02] -p0 is not doing anything though. [19:51:02]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:51:29] (not that it matters much for your use case.) [19:51:29]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:51:49] the latter gives me "Cannot exec '\!\!': No such file or directory" in the sending screen when I reattach to check status [19:51:49]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:52:50] as does -X exec \!\! "sx txFile" [19:52:50]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:52:57] works fine here. [19:52:57]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:53:38] really, wth [19:53:38]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:53:38] that one is wrong. it'll try executing "sx txFile". [19:53:38]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	amade	[19:53:41] um, doesn't exec expect actual binary? [19:53:41]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:53:53] sx is a binary, no? [19:53:53]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	amade	[19:54:02] but first argument is \!\! [19:54:02]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:54:12] that's the argument to exec. [19:54:12]

2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:54:57] hm, good question, Didn't think about it. txFile is text, I could try a binary. [19:54:57]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:55:07] i mean that is the fdpat part in: exec [[fdpat] newcommand [args …]] [19:55:07]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	amade	[19:55:25] yea, there seems to be something like this [19:55:25]

2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:56:03] works! [19:56:03]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:57:03] seems to be the same as  screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx txFile  from before. ;-) [19:57:03]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:57:22] actually works now with a text file too. Well I haven't compared the resuls yet [19:57:22]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:57:59] not sure what else I did different, but great now that I can repeat it  [19:57:59]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:58:48] So, can I do the same thing on the other side? eg screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx binFile [19:58:48]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[19:58:54] but with rx?  [19:58:54]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[19:59:46] one way to find out. [19:59:46]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[20:00:31] yep, sure does! I'm very happy. Thanks for your help [20:00:31]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[20:01:24] hmm, i cannot reproduce the issue with an unattached screen i had before. [20:01:24]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[20:03:58] one more thing, how to I close the detached session? i.e. ^a \ while detached? [20:03:58]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[20:05:25] terminate the screen session? -X quit [20:05:25]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[20:05:42] or kill whatever is running inside. [20:05:42]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[20:10:57] both, but I expect -X quit will also kill anything running inside, correct? [20:10:57]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	Soliton	[20:12:13] yes. [20:12:13]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	gnac	[20:12:22] thanks! [20:12:22]

2016-10-28 12:28:14	peeps[lappy]	[03:45:22] wow, nevermind.  i just realized i had called byobu previously on the beaglebone, not realizing that it uses a tmux backend on that system.  i had no idea some byobu used tmux sometimes.  anyways i was able to reattach, so problem solved [03:45:22]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[07:26:51] is there a way to run a subprocess on a detached screen? i.e. if I were attached to a serial screen, I might ^a : and then type "exec !! sx file.txt" to send a file.  [07:26:51]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[07:26:56] If I wanted to just send some text to a detached screen I would do somethign like screen -S detachedScreen -p 0 -X stuff "sometext" [07:26:56]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[07:27:08] I'd like to do somethign like screen -S detachedScreen -p 0 -X exec !! sx txFile [07:27:08]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[08:48:22] what prevents you from doing that? [08:48:22]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	labelette	[09:09:29] hi, I have an issue with mutt into gnuscreen,I read some other related topic but unable to make it work. mutt gets confuse when scrolling into email and my sidebar gets overwritten&black,another thing is on the message list the selection color (blue in my case) doesnt select all the line but only the words any idea?(using term xterm-256color in my screenrc I tried screen-256color-s but not better) [09:09:29]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[14:00:11] Soliton: I've tried that (screen -S detachedScreen -p 0 -X exec !! sx txFile) but as far as I can make out, the command doesn't get executed. i.e. attaching to the screen I see no evidence of it trying to send the file, and of couse no evidence of a file being received on the other end. [14:00:11]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:43:24] gnac: looks like you need to explicitely select a window if you've never attached. there is no current window on a never attached screen and exec only works for the current window. [19:43:24]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:44:43] gnac: i suppose one could argue that -p not working as expected here is a bug. [19:44:43]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[19:45:35] Soliton: I escaped the !! so \!\! and that worked better, but then I received a message in my receiver terminal about exec sx not existing or some such. [19:45:35]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[19:46:27] The goal is to be able to script sending a file. I had been successful gettign screen to send it using exec !! sx .. while attached. Now I'm trying to see if I can do it while detached. [19:46:27]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:46:32] if the shell you issued the command from has history expansion on you need to escape !, yeah. [19:46:32]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[19:47:09] Yeah, that explained the weirdness I was seeing in the exection.  [19:47:09]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:48:20] exec sx not existing sounds like a quoting error. [19:48:20]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[19:48:49] Should I try quoting the entire thing? or just sx? [19:48:49]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:49:11] what is the command you have now? [19:49:11]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[19:50:07] I"ve tried screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \\!\\! sx txFile and screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx txFile [19:50:07]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:50:42] the latter looks good. [19:50:42]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:51:02] -p0 is not doing anything though. [19:51:02]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:51:29] (not that it matters much for your use case.) [19:51:29]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[19:51:49] the latter gives me "Cannot exec '\!\!': No such file or directory" in the sending screen when I reattach to check status [19:51:49]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[19:52:50] as does -X exec \!\! "sx txFile" [19:52:50]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:52:57] works fine here. [19:52:57]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	gnac	[19:53:38] really, wth [19:53:38]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:53:38] that one is wrong. it'll try executing "sx txFile". [19:53:38]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	amade	[19:53:41] um, doesn't exec expect actual binary? [19:53:41]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:53:53] sx is a binary, no? [19:53:53]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	amade	[19:54:02] but first argument is \!\! [19:54:02]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	Soliton	[19:54:12] that's the argument to exec. [19:54:12]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	amade	[19:54:20] so it tried to run \!\! [19:54:20]

2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[19:52:50] as does -X exec \!\! "sx txFile" [19:52:50]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[19:52:57] works fine here. [19:52:57]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[19:53:38] really, wth [19:53:38]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[19:53:38] that one is wrong. it'll try executing "sx txFile". [19:53:38]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	amade	[19:53:41] um, doesn't exec expect actual binary? [19:53:41]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[19:53:53] sx is a binary, no? [19:53:53]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	amade	[19:54:02] but first argument is \!\! [19:54:02]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[19:54:12] that's the argument to exec. [19:54:12]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	amade	[19:54:20] so it tried to run \!\! [19:54:20]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[19:54:57] hm, good question, Didn't think about it. txFile is text, I could try a binary. [19:54:57]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[19:55:07] i mean that is the fdpat part in: exec [[fdpat] newcommand [args …]] [19:55:07]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	amade	[19:55:25] yea, there seems to be something like this [19:55:25]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[19:55:37] (which is optional as you can see there.) [19:55:37]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[19:56:01] screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx binFile [19:56:01]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[19:56:03] works! [19:56:03]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[19:57:03] seems to be the same as  screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx txFile  from before. ;-) [19:57:03]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[19:57:22] actually works now with a text file too. Well I haven't compared the resuls yet [19:57:22]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[19:57:59] not sure what else I did different, but great now that I can repeat it  [19:57:59]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[19:58:48] So, can I do the same thing on the other side? eg screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx binFile [19:58:48]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[19:58:54] but with rx?  [19:58:54]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[19:59:46] one way to find out. [19:59:46]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[20:00:31] yep, sure does! I'm very happy. Thanks for your help [20:00:31]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[20:01:24] hmm, i cannot reproduce the issue with an unattached screen i had before. [20:01:24]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[20:03:58] one more thing, how to I close the detached session? i.e. ^a \ while detached? [20:03:58]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[20:05:25] terminate the screen session? -X quit [20:05:25]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[20:05:42] or kill whatever is running inside. [20:05:42]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[20:10:57] both, but I expect -X quit will also kill anything running inside, correct? [20:10:57]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	Soliton	[20:12:13] yes. [20:12:13]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	gnac	[20:12:22] thanks! [20:12:22]

2016-10-28 22:29:33	peeps[lappy]	[03:45:22] wow, nevermind.  i just realized i had called byobu previously on the beaglebone, not realizing that it uses a tmux backend on that system.  i had no idea some byobu used tmux sometimes.  anyways i was able to reattach, so problem solved [03:45:22]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	gnac	[07:26:51] is there a way to run a subprocess on a detached screen? i.e. if I were attached to a serial screen, I might ^a : and then type "exec !! sx file.txt" to send a file. [07:26:51]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	gnac	[07:26:56] If I wanted to just send some text to a detached screen I would do somethign like screen -S detachedScreen -p 0 -X stuff "sometext" [07:26:56]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	gnac	[07:27:08] I'd like to do somethign like screen -S detachedScreen -p 0 -X exec !! sx txFile [07:27:08]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	Soliton	[08:48:22] what prevents you from doing that? [08:48:22]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	labelette	[09:09:29] hi, I have an issue with mutt into gnuscreen,I read some other related topic but unable to make it work. mutt gets confuse when scrolling into email and my sidebar gets overwritten&black,another thing is on the message list the selection color (blue in my case) doesnt select all the line but only the words any idea?(using term xterm-256color in my screenrc I tried screen-256color-s but not better) [09:09:29]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	gnac	[14:00:11] Soliton: I've tried that (screen -S detachedScreen -p 0 -X exec !! sx txFile) but as far as I can make out, the command doesn't get executed. i.e. attaching to the screen I see no evidence of it trying to send the file, and of couse no evidence of a file being received on the other end. [14:00:11]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	Soliton	[19:43:24] gnac: looks like you need to explicitely select a window if you've never attached. there is no current window on a never attached screen and exec only works for the current window. [19:43:24]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	Soliton	[19:44:43] gnac: i suppose one could argue that -p not working as expected here is a bug. [19:44:43]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	gnac	[19:45:35] Soliton: I escaped the !! so \!\! and that worked better, but then I received a message in my receiver terminal about exec sx not existing or some such. [19:45:35]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	gnac	[19:46:27] The goal is to be able to script sending a file. I had been successful gettign screen to send it using exec !! sx .. while attached. Now I'm trying to see if I can do it while detached. [19:46:27]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	Soliton	[19:46:32] if the shell you issued the command from has history expansion on you need to escape !, yeah. [19:46:32]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	gnac	[19:47:09] Yeah, that explained the weirdness I was seeing in the exection. [19:47:09]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	Soliton	[19:48:20] exec sx not existing sounds like a quoting error. [19:48:20]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	gnac	[19:48:49] Should I try quoting the entire thing? or just sx? [19:48:49]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	Soliton	[19:49:11] what is the command you have now? [19:49:11]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	gnac	[19:50:07] I"ve tried screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \\!\\! sx txFile and screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx txFile [19:50:07]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	Soliton	[19:50:42] the latter looks good. [19:50:42]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	Soliton	[19:51:02] -p0 is not doing anything though. [19:51:02]
2016-10-28 22:29:33	Soliton	[19:51:29] (not that it matters much for your use case.) [19:51:29]

2016-10-29 12:25:07	Soliton	[19:48:20] exec sx not existing sounds like a quoting error. [19:48:20]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	gnac	[19:48:49] Should I try quoting the entire thing? or just sx? [19:48:49]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	Soliton	[19:49:11] what is the command you have now? [19:49:11]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	gnac	[19:50:07] I"ve tried screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \\!\\! sx txFile and screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx txFile [19:50:07]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:50:42] the latter looks good. [19:50:42]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:51:02] -p0 is not doing anything though. [19:51:02]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:51:29] (not that it matters much for your use case.) [19:51:29]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[19:51:49] the latter gives me "Cannot exec '\!\!': No such file or directory" in the sending screen when I reattach to check status [19:51:49]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[19:52:50] as does -X exec \!\! "sx txFile" [19:52:50]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:52:57] works fine here. [19:52:57]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[19:53:38] really, wth [19:53:38]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:53:38] that one is wrong. it'll try executing "sx txFile". [19:53:38]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	amade	[19:53:41] um, doesn't exec expect actual binary? [19:53:41]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:53:53] sx is a binary, no? [19:53:53]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	amade	[19:54:02] but first argument is \!\! [19:54:02]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:54:12] that's the argument to exec. [19:54:12]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	amade	[19:54:20] so it tried to run \!\! [19:54:20]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[19:54:57] hm, good question, Didn't think about it. txFile is text, I could try a binary. [19:54:57]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:55:07] i mean that is the fdpat part in: exec [[fdpat] newcommand [args …]] [19:55:07]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	amade	[19:55:25] yea, there seems to be something like this [19:55:25]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:55:37] (which is optional as you can see there.) [19:55:37]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[19:56:01] screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx binFile [19:56:01]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[19:56:03] works! [19:56:03]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:57:03] seems to be the same as  screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx txFile  from before. ;-) [19:57:03]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[19:57:22] actually works now with a text file too. Well I haven't compared the resuls yet [19:57:22]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[19:57:59] not sure what else I did different, but great now that I can repeat it [19:57:59]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[19:58:48] So, can I do the same thing on the other side? eg screen -S sendScreen -p 0 -X exec \!\! sx binFile [19:58:48]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[19:58:54] but with rx? [19:58:54]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[19:59:46] one way to find out. [19:59:46]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[20:00:31] yep, sure does! I'm very happy. Thanks for your help [20:00:31]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[20:01:24] hmm, i cannot reproduce the issue with an unattached screen i had before. [20:01:24]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[20:03:58] one more thing, how to I close the detached session? i.e. ^a \ while detached? [20:03:58]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[20:05:25] terminate the screen session? -X quit [20:05:25]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[20:05:42] or kill whatever is running inside. [20:05:42]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[20:10:57] both, but I expect -X quit will also kill anything running inside, correct? [20:10:57]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	Soliton	[20:12:13] yes. [20:12:13]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	gnac	[20:12:22] thanks! [20:12:22]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	labelette	[09:40:08] is there a way to make C-e, C-down, C-up work with screen ? All of theses shortcut are my binding for mutt and running under screen theses keys combination are not recognized anymore :( [09:40:08]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	brainwash	[09:46:10] labelette: unbind them I'd guss [09:46:10]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	brainwash	[09:46:19] bind e [09:46:19]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	brainwash	[09:46:43] oh wait [09:46:43]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	labelette	[10:23:13] brainwash: you think it is as simple ? should I unbind it? [10:23:13]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	brainwash	[10:24:19] labelette: it should be actually like this in your case: bindkey ^e [10:24:19]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	brainwash	[10:24:32] but does screen even bind C-e? [10:24:32]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	labelette	[10:31:45] brainwash : this is what I thought this is strange has I don't think screen is using/binding it... it is like it does'nt pass the instruction to mutt [10:31:45]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	labelette	[10:32:27] any idea of the command should I try after bindkey ^e ?  [10:32:27]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	brainwash	[10:34:21] didn't bindkey ^e help? [10:34:21]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	brainwash	[10:34:50] I guess no [10:34:50]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	brainwash	[10:35:30] labelette: did you ask in the mutt channel? I assume that quite a few people run it inside screen [10:35:30]
2016-10-29 12:25:08	labelette	[10:37:57] brainwash: I will good suggestion [10:37:57]

2016-10-29 18:39:21	brainwash	[10:34:21] didn't bindkey ^e help? [10:34:21]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	brainwash	[10:34:50] I guess no [10:34:50]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	brainwash	[10:35:30] labelette: did you ask in the mutt channel? I assume that quite a few people run it inside screen [10:35:30]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	labelette	[10:37:57] brainwash: I will good suggestion [10:37:57]
