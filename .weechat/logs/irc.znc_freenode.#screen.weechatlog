2016-10-22 08:40:07	Elronnd	sometimes one of my screens will freeze up and I have to ^a^k it and make a new one.  Is there a way to stop this from happenning?

2016-10-22 09:01:29	amade	Elronnd: maybe you accidentally press ^s  or ^a + s
2016-10-22 09:04:37	amade	^s can be disabled in your parent shell with stty -ixon, ^a + s needs to be unbound in screenrc
2016-10-22 09:04:52	amade	you can also manually resume with ^q or ^a + q
2016-10-22 09:05:25	amade	search for xon xoff for more info
2016-10-22 09:06:06	Elronnd	I know it wasn't ^s, because ^q didn't fix it
2016-10-22 09:06:25	Elronnd	^a s could definitely have happeened
2016-10-22 09:06:28	Elronnd	thanks
2016-10-22 09:06:44	amade	yeah, that's screen equivalent
