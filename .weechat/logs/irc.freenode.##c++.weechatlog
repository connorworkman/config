2016-09-12 14:57:52	SlashLife	But you can write code specifically for these values to choose a cheaper route to deal with them.
2016-09-12 14:58:04	FaTony	when you move object, you just copy pointer values under the hood
2016-09-12 14:58:22	SlashLife	Say you have a vector with 10000 elements. These elements are pointed to by the vector. When you copy the vector, you need to copy all the elements.
2016-09-12 14:58:45	Akahige	pied: It doesn't always speed up code... But for objects which may have to allocate, when you move, rather than copy, you just use the old object's allocated memory.
2016-09-12 14:58:50	SlashLife	When you move it, you say that you won't need the old vector anymore, so instead of copying them, you can actually steal the allocated memory from the old vector and leave it with an empty pece.
2016-09-12 14:58:52	SlashLife	*piece
2016-09-12 14:59:00	Akahige	Since the old object wont retain the same value.
2016-09-12 14:59:13	Akahige	You could almost think of move as a destructive copy
2016-09-12 14:59:17	pied	oh yeah, that's right

2016-09-12 15:00:14	SlashLife	You're also not generically guaranteed to be allowed to do any operation on a moved from object, except of being able to destruct it.

2016-09-12 15:11:29	SlashLife	That's actually an extremely simple way to implement it.
2016-09-12 15:11:52	Akahige	However, if you decided to do something like default construct the object then swap.

2016-09-12 15:12:34	SlashLife	In most cases swap() can be implemented as noexcept.
2016-09-12 15:12:51	SlashLife	So with this you will automatically get exception safety.

2016-09-12 15:13:48	Akahige	Norno: Best guess, function takes a reference (not a const reference)
2016-09-12 15:13:50	Kaslai	Norno, it depends on what the argument type is. If the argument is a reference, then you must pass in an lvalue reference.
2016-09-12 15:13:57	SlashLife	You could implement copy assignment as swapping from a copy constructed temporary ...
2016-09-12 15:14:02	SlashLife	... but the copy constructor itself?
2016-09-12 15:14:19	pied	i mispoke

2016-09-12 17:08:12	Kaslai	You lose lexical proximity, non-alpha characters aren't always friendly for printing and sorting in many cases, and C++ is kind of like saying "C... But better" rather than "Better than C," which makes a difference when speaking about a subject. You can't build up suspense with "Plus plus... C" but you can with "C... Plus plus!" (Which admittedly is a lame excuse, but hey, people love that stuff)

2016-09-12 19:26:45	Kaslai	The thing I figure is that people will cast pointers to integers for some god-forsaken reason and expect to get a valid pointer when they cast back to an integer, so in order to make sure that such behavior doesn't get messed up, GCC complains when the pointer's might get truncated
2016-09-12 19:26:58	Kaslai	cast back from an integer*
2016-09-12 19:27:20	Kaslai	Pointer's value* yadda yadda. I can't type.
2016-09-12 19:27:47	w3z	its not just gcc, and the same issue is of course there if youre casting from a wider integer type to a shorter and back
2016-09-12 19:28:49	w3z	its kind of an arbitrary line to only check compound to integral
2016-09-12 19:29:40	w3z	and not all compounds, enums dont get the check
2016-09-12 19:29:53	Kaslai	The same issue exists, however it's generally considered a non-fatal and possibly desired error if a numeric value gets truncated. It's almost always fatal and unintended for a pointer to get truncated though.

2016-09-13 06:54:10	bringmethefish	Hi. Anyone here with really good experience in libcurl? Quick question about: https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE.html It says: "This is just treated as a request, not an order. You cannot be guaranteed to actually get the given size. " So, no guarantee  to get CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE. But can I be sure that I will not get a larger value?

2016-09-13 10:15:46	andyc	I thought perhaps a tuple, but I need the data in vertex to be packed, so it can be buffered to a gpu
2016-09-13 10:16:05	ambro718	but that means I need different macros depending on whether I'm using from a namespace or a class. I want to have  #define USING(namespace, type_name) using type_name = typename namespace::type_name;

2016-09-13 12:36:59	kstar	There is no way to enforce properties in a template right? I wonder why the std::foo algorithms that take bidirectional iterators are templates, instead of having some base class like std::bidirectional_iterator

2016-09-13 12:37:17	Kaslai	Right
2016-09-13 12:37:21	thinlizzy	furthermore, end() requires the definition of a sentinel

2016-09-13 12:41:35	thinlizzy	kstar, you can do a visiting approach indeed
2016-09-13 12:41:51	thinlizzy	that is way simpler than iterators. iterators are more adaptable, though (free std algos)

2016-09-13 12:42:52	thinlizzy	visitor is also a very overloaded term. that link refers to GoF visitor pattern, which is meant to add more functionality to existing classes

Why is this? Isn't pass by value better since the copy will then happen at the call site automatically if needed, otherwise you

2016-09-14 08:38:47	robmurrer	bsdbeard: They don't throw a lot of exceptions and neither should you :D
2016-09-14 08:39:15	bsdbeard	I guess technically they do throw a lot (since anything that can allocate memory can throw)
2016-09-14 08:40:10	robmurrer	bsdbeard: but that is the same exception in the end right?
2016-09-14 08:40:12	robmurrer	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2843820/c-standard-library-exception-list
2016-09-14 08:40:50	bsdbeard	thanks robmurrer
2016-09-14 08:41:37	bsdbeard	isocpp states "Do not use throw to indicate a coding error in usage of a function. Use assert or other mechanism to either send the process into a debugger or to crash the process", I guess I should mainly use exceptions when I fail to obtain external resources (i.e. from an external server or database even if the user supplies correct function arguments)
2016-09-14 08:42:07	thinlizzy	yup
2016-09-14 08:42:12	bsdbeard	And incorrect arguments supplied by the user shouldnt throw (i.e. like ifstream("blahblah") wont throw)
2016-09-14 08:42:41	thinlizzy	you can also throw when an object fails to construct by any reason if your design does not accommodate zombie objects
2016-09-14 08:42:57	bsdbeard	yeah good point
2016-09-14 08:43:01	thinlizzy	ifstream("blahblah") can throw if you want to
2016-09-14 08:43:11	thinlizzy	.open("blahakla")
2016-09-14 08:43:39	bsdbeard	I guess ifstream handles it well (sets fail bit, etc)
2016-09-14 08:43:54	thinlizzy	but you can enable exceptions on them
2016-09-14 08:43:59	thinlizzy	that helped me in some circumstances

2016-09-14 09:06:46	bsdbeard	Why don't you just make a standalone print_json function?
2016-09-14 09:06:54	Rickta59	this is arduino code and the Serial object is never going t oget destroyed
2016-09-14 09:07:22	Rickta59	because i'd like to use all the methods of the Serial object and maybe change at compile to point at Serial1 ..

2016-09-14 09:08:35	robmurrer	Rickta59: that style of inheritance is kind of old-hat but if it works for you go for it.  It just gets kind of messy when you just keep inheriting and adding methods and fields like that.
2016-09-14 09:09:04	bsdbeard	I also don't see any reason to do it at all, you can just call the Serial functions from a standalone function

2016-09-14 09:31:51	bsdbeard	I guess if you're doing it for yourself and overloading 8 prints is too cumbersome, then go with either a getter that returns the inner serial or your original idea (but im not sure if its safe on whatever compiler arduino uses)

2016-09-14 09:33:08	Kirrahe	static_casting to a derived class is undefined behavior if the object is not actually an instance of said derived class

2016-09-14 10:09:38	thinlizzy	and your comments are also making me sad. C++ is not java. you want something that will never happen in your code
2016-09-14 10:09:39	guillaum	forgot about the dangling pointer, the real work is allocating a copied value of A ;). Yes, I'm explicitly calling it, but in this case, there is no difference between explicitly calling the copy ctor and explicitly calling the first ctor.

2016-09-14 13:35:33	muteki	because it can't find the definition of the constructor?
2016-09-14 13:35:44	muteki	but compiler didn't complain about it
2016-09-14 13:35:58	klys	it would be a linker error
2016-09-14 13:36:16	muteki	or because I am calling constructor in the class body?
2016-09-14 13:36:44	klys	erm, not sure why you would be doing that.  perhaps you would like to paste.

2016-09-14 18:03:08	deadlyninja	i have an ostringstream, i want to pass it to a function that takes an iostream as input, how can i do that?
2016-09-14 18:03:30	yuta	s
2016-09-14 18:03:39	yuta	hello, someone can help me with c++ issue?
2016-09-14 18:03:44	Akahige	ask
2016-09-14 18:03:48	Akahige	Don't ask to asl
2016-09-14 18:04:00	Akahige	deadlyninja: streams are polymorphic, you can do it with references.
2016-09-14 18:04:18	Akahige	However, iostream inherits from ostream and istream iirc.
2016-09-14 18:04:27	Akahige	So you can't pass a parent to a child reference.
2016-09-14 18:05:25	yuta	i have a vector of objects "Client", and in my class "Server" i create a pointer that will handle a new instance of Client, how can i push_back() that pointer to my vector?
2016-09-14 18:06:24	Akahige	By, pushing it back?
2016-09-14 18:06:30	Akahige	vec.push_back(ptr);

2016-09-14 18:06:37	Akahige	I'd suggest you use smart pointers though
2016-09-14 18:07:08	deadlyninja	Akahige, is there an iostringstream i can pass as an iostream?
2016-09-14 18:07:10	irrenhaus3	yuta: you cannot push a T* into a vector<T>
2016-09-14 18:07:23	Akahige	deadlyninja: it's just called stringstream
2016-09-14 18:07:25	yuta	i did, but it says "Invalid conversion from Cliente* to int"
2016-09-14 18:07:45	Akahige	You need to have a vector or Client*
2016-09-14 18:07:45		[18:07]
2016-09-14 18:07:47	Akahige	Not int
2016-09-14 18:08:06	yuta	yes, the vector is defined right, vector<client> lista;
2016-09-14 18:08:36	Akahige	Then it's as irrenhaus3 says
2016-09-14 18:08:47	Akahige	You can't put pointers to an object into an array of objects

Even if I copy all my RegisterContainers in the first map, I need to re-bind ports to the new RegisterContainer addresses, so I think there's a big design issue in my class storage. :/

2016-09-15 04:57:51	Circuitsoft	My class is defined such that it is correct to do so.
2016-09-15 04:58:06	RokerHRO	CustosLimen: the default c'tor does a memberwise copy. is that not okay for your class?

2016-09-15 04:58:31	ubsan	but memcpy is more fun
2016-09-15 04:58:35	ubsan	:(
2016-09-15 04:58:41	thinlizzy	I would use std::copy
2016-09-15 04:58:45	ubsan	UB is way more interesting to deal with

2016-09-15 16:34:20	rangergord	Is there a simple SQL query builder for C++, so that I can write complex queries without messing with SQL strings or worrying about order of operations? For reference here's how I can use the Knex lib in Javascript: var query = db('events_table'); query.where('created_at', '>', someDate); query.whereBetween('votes', [1, 100]); query.select('field1, field2'); console.log(query.toString()); .
2016-09-15 16:34:20	rangergord	Result: select "field1, field2" from "events_table" where "created_at" > '2016-09-15 22:33:07.639' and "votes" between 1 and 100
2016-09-15 16:34:30	rangergord	I can't go back to raw SQL after this!
2016-09-15 16:34:58	rangergord	especially for an app where I let the user build complex search filters

2016-09-15 17:59:34	w3z	instantiations of the class template will generate a new class type, what that means depends on whats in the class (if anything) and how its used

2016-10-02 05:52:30	ascheel	Quick question.  I'm overloading operator++ for an iterator class (yes, this is homework) and the ++ POSTFIX operator has a parameter input of just "int" and I don't understand why.  It seems that it's "int" for any ++ postfix operator overload.  Is it always "int"?  Can someone explain why?
2016-10-02 05:53:24	va	if it did not, how would you distinguish it from prefix-type operator++?

Repeatedly yields a tuple of boost::optional<T>s where T is the type yielded by the sequences' respective iterators. Because of its boost dependency, zip_longest is not in itertools.hpp and must be included separately.

2016-10-02 11:07:00	Eelis	*an F

And I didn't say use an unsigned type - I said use size_t, because size_t is the semantic type you should be using for all sizes, lengths, counts, etc. I don't care that it's unsigned, only that it's correct.

2016-10-02 20:16:36	sn0wmonster	well, in ZNC you have profiles for connections, organized by username (lets say "bob1") and networks (lets say "default"). So i would tell ZNC to "AddServer bob1 default irc.freenode.net" and it would automatically connect. what i'd like is an additional option/field/command to "AddSocks bob1 default address.of.proxy:port" so that the individual connection can use a socks proxy
2016-10-02 20:17:26	sn0wmonster	as of right now, ZNC does not natively support proxies for connections. if it did, more people could connect their ZNC over Tor and such.

2016-10-05 18:17:06	df00z	Jeeze I am really struggling with GRPC.   One way to use it is callback based.  Found out each callback runs on it’s own thread.  Say I have 10 threads, are there any mechanisms or standard objects in C++ that would let me notify all threads of data being available to process?  Something that blocks on read.  Do I need separate queues for each thread, if each thread has to process the data?

2016-10-05 18:26:11	df00z	I sort of have a few ideas.  guess there’s something called condition_variable   That could work.  I could also maybe share a queue if all the threads keep track of like a # of the last item processed.

2016-10-05 18:29:59	df00z	Yeah, that’s easy.  I’ll have two functions, int getLastProcessedIndex(), setLastProcessedIndex(int val)     shared_lock on getLastProcessedIndex, unique on set.  Occasionally some other code will lock the shared queue and do general cleanup.
2016-10-05 18:30:03	w3z	i havent read it, but if you just dicovered something called a condition variable, any information will be helpful for you, and we wont have to listen to you prattle on
