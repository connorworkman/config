2016-10-19 06:44:34	kj_	hey guys, have you got any recommendations for a pair of headphones? I'm thinking the HD25, simply because they're so cheap atm (£109 on Amazon) but am looking for an alternative around this price point and performance, but over ear? 
2016-10-19 06:45:12	toastercookie	athm50x
2016-10-19 06:45:22	toastercookie	best under 200 headphones imo
2016-10-19 06:48:12	@phusion	I use the HD595's
2016-10-19 06:48:27	@phusion	they are fantastic, but were $250USD in '07 when I got them

2016-10-23 07:21:36	enche	i do like hard pumping techno though 
2016-10-23 07:21:39	@phusion	and by all means, rock out on your house, I just live in NorCal and if I played house-anything Id clear the room
2016-10-23 07:22:04	enche	tech house is like techno with its balls cut off
2016-10-23 07:22:15	enche	endless 909 hats and rides
