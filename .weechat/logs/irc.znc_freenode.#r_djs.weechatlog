2016-10-19 06:44:34	kj_	hey guys, have you got any recommendations for a pair of headphones? I'm thinking the HD25, simply because they're so cheap atm (£109 on Amazon) but am looking for an alternative around this price point and performance, but over ear? 
2016-10-19 06:45:12	toastercookie	athm50x
2016-10-19 06:45:22	toastercookie	best under 200 headphones imo
2016-10-19 06:48:12	@phusion	I use the HD595's
2016-10-19 06:48:27	@phusion	they are fantastic, but were $250USD in '07 when I got them

2016-10-19 14:34:41	kj_	[16:44:34] hey guys, have you got any recommendations for a pair of headphones? I'm thinking the HD25, simply because they're so cheap atm (£109 on Amazon) but am looking for an alternative around this price point and performance, but over ear?  [16:44:34]

2016-10-19 14:34:41	toastercookie	[16:45:22] best under 200 headphones imo [16:45:22]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	@phusion	[16:48:12] I use the HD595's [16:48:12]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	@phusion	[16:48:27] they are fantastic, but were $250USD in '07 when I got them [16:48:27]
