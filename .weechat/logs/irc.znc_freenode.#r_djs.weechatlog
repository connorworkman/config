2016-10-19 06:44:34	kj_	hey guys, have you got any recommendations for a pair of headphones? I'm thinking the HD25, simply because they're so cheap atm (£109 on Amazon) but am looking for an alternative around this price point and performance, but over ear? 
2016-10-19 06:45:12	toastercookie	athm50x
2016-10-19 06:45:22	toastercookie	best under 200 headphones imo
2016-10-19 06:48:12	@phusion	I use the HD595's
2016-10-19 06:48:27	@phusion	they are fantastic, but were $250USD in '07 when I got them

2016-10-26 00:25:41	strepto	Hahahaha
2016-10-26 00:25:49	strepto	What kind of music do you prefer?
2016-10-26 00:26:01	strepto	And there's nothing wrong with living in a cardboard box.
2016-10-26 00:26:11	alyptik	i flip flop around the techno/trance area
2016-10-26 00:26:17	alyptik	but mostly goa trance
2016-10-26 00:26:20	alyptik	<3 ektoplasm
2016-10-26 00:27:20	strepto	Ah, right. I've always been a trance guy, but I've spent quite a bit of time exploring new genres now. Techno and tech house is fun as well. I like working with layering, and that's not easy with Trance.
2016-10-26 00:27:53	alyptik	for sure
2016-10-26 00:28:10	alyptik	it's the main reason i don't play the newer progressive ish stuff as much 
2016-10-26 00:28:22	strepto	I don't like the progressive stuff to be honest.
2016-10-26 00:28:24	alyptik	lends itself more to quick mixes; not as much fun for me
2016-10-26 00:28:34	strepto	So much of it sounds the same.. same sounds, same stuff over and over again.
2016-10-26 00:28:43	alyptik	older cheese trance and goa are very fun to layer though
2016-10-26 00:28:50	alyptik	strepto› ++
2016-10-26 00:29:18	alyptik	i try to keep up, but it's really no fun to keep up with music you don't love
2016-10-26 00:29:24	strepto	Goa is easier, because it's more sounds and more "true" to it's genre. The way trance is going now, I don't really understand it.
2016-10-26 00:29:32	strepto	Just look at Armin. He's no longer making trance.
2016-10-26 00:29:50	alyptik	indeed
2016-10-26 00:30:08	alyptik	the only mainstream trance radio show i bother following these days is PVDs vonyc
2016-10-26 00:30:15	strepto	But I think he's decided to shift to something new, and try out new stuff. He's no longer pushing out stuff like he used to.
2016-10-26 00:30:26	alyptik	even that can get a bit too prog for my taste at times
2016-10-26 00:30:27	strepto	I like Aly and Fila too. They seem to be in the game.
2016-10-26 00:30:34	alyptik	oh they are good too
2016-10-26 00:30:47	alyptik	haven't had a chance to check uut their radio show much
2016-10-26 00:30:56	alyptik	i love their tracks though
2016-10-26 00:31:19	strepto	I need to narrow down my scope. I don't have time to engage "all over the place". I need to hammer down something that works for me.
2016-10-26 00:32:08	alyptik	i just like playing to field to keep it interesting, but i always come back to goa, or if i feel more chill straight up early 2000's cheese trance hah
2016-10-26 00:32:16	alyptik	the field*
2016-10-26 00:32:53	alyptik	sometimes tech trance is fun too, but it wears to play that days ina  row
2016-10-26 00:33:07	strepto	Tech trance?
2016-10-26 00:33:18	alyptik	like bryan kearney, simon patterson
2016-10-26 00:33:25	strepto	Oh.
2016-10-26 00:33:48	alyptik	sorta like psytance without the psy
2016-10-26 00:33:54	alyptik	if that makes any sense
2016-10-26 00:34:25	strepto	Hm.. I'm sorry, I'm not well enough travesed in the sub-genres of trance to distinguish them.
2016-10-26 00:34:53	alyptik	it is mostly tech trance, prog, uplifting, and cheese trance imo
2016-10-26 00:35:02	alyptik	then all the psy genres off to the side
2016-10-26 00:35:41	alyptik	most of the others like ibiza just aren't really popular enough for me to make a crate for them
2016-10-26 00:37:52	alyptik	genres aren't super fixed anyway, ask two people to categorize a song you will prob get 2 diff answers heh; goes for pretty much all genres really
2016-10-26 00:37:52		[00:37]
2016-10-26 00:37:55	strepto	When you say "make a crate", what exactly does that mean?
2016-10-26 00:38:00	strepto	I've heard that before.
2016-10-26 00:38:04	strepto	I'm a newbie, mind you.
2016-10-26 00:38:04	alyptik	like a serato playlist thing
2016-10-26 00:38:12	alyptik	i use mixxx, but it's pretty much the same
2016-10-26 00:38:17	strepto	Oh, right. So a virtual crate of your mix.
2016-10-26 00:38:20	strepto	*music
2016-10-26 00:38:23	alyptik	like a playlist that filters dups automatically

2016-10-26 00:50:09	alyptik	yeah i just  record every time i practice; trying to build good habits
2016-10-26 00:50:39	alyptik	not sure interested in promoting myself or anything, it's mostly up there just to share music i like
2016-10-26 00:50:56	alyptik	so there are prob a few not so great mixes in there 
2016-10-26 00:51:12	strepto	Those are usually the ones you learn the most from though.
2016-10-26 00:51:21	strepto	But I mean, you're an actual DJ. You play places.
2016-10-26 00:51:29	strepto	I'm an idiot. From Norway.

2016-10-26 00:51:38	alyptik	well not anymore hah
2016-10-26 00:51:55	alyptik	haven't played out in years, and back then i was a different genre too

2016-10-26 00:54:01	alyptik	it is hot and traffic sucks hah
2016-10-26 00:54:32	strepto	It'd raining sideways here now, and it's 6 degrees C.
2016-10-26 00:54:39	strepto	I'll take a hot traffic jam any day of the week.

2016-10-26 00:56:14	strepto	Tell me about your workflow, Aly.
2016-10-26 00:56:45	alyptik	i saved up for months and bought myself two 1200's for DVS
2016-10-26 00:56:49	alyptik	couldn't be happier
2016-10-26 00:57:00	alyptik	i am poor though so i use mixxx instead of serato
2016-10-26 00:57:06	strepto	Ah, right.
2016-10-26 00:57:13	strepto	You mix on vinyl?
2016-10-26 00:57:27	alyptik	yeah with two serato control vinyls
2016-10-26 00:57:28	strepto	I guess DVS is more like vinyl-ish?
2016-10-26 00:57:46	alyptik	i would like to play reg vinyl too but not much here sells that
2016-10-26 00:58:09	strepto	Not to mention the fact that you'd have to buy a lot of vinyl. which isn't cheap.

2016-10-26 01:28:41	strepto	Wow, that's intense. I practice when I'm in "the zone". A few times a week usually.

2016-10-26 01:29:07	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-26 01:29:20	alyptik	it takes up like 4hrs+ for me so i don't do it too often
2016-10-26 01:30:24	strepto	Oh.. What's your approach to digging?
2016-10-26 01:30:33	strepto	I just sniff around on Beatport and Juno.

2016-10-27 01:32:29	strepto	I don't think it's much different from anything else.
2016-10-27 01:32:30	alyptik	is it fun?
2016-10-27 01:32:44	strepto	Yeah, too fun. Offers a bunch of creative stuff that is too easy to push.
2016-10-27 01:32:52	strepto	.. so I'm making an effort to stay away from them.
2016-10-27 01:33:03	alyptik	most important part

2016-10-27 01:33:30	strepto	It is.
2016-10-27 01:33:35	alyptik	if it sounds good it is good
2016-10-27 01:33:42	strepto	I haven't used sync so far, because I haven't needed it.
2016-10-27 01:34:00	alyptik	i never use it because it stutters me
2016-10-27 01:34:06	alyptik	but i would appreciate if i had the option
2016-10-27 01:34:14	strepto	But yesterday I went crazy, made an 8 bar loop, loaded samples form the free RBDJ sample pack - and stood there for two hours straight just winging it with Sync.
2016-10-27 01:34:24	alyptik	i suck at loop
2016-10-27 01:34:27	strepto	You need sync when you apply creative stuff like samples, or else it's not going to work very well.
2016-10-27 01:34:29	alyptik	my achilles heel
2016-10-27 01:37:45	strepto	Loops are hard on vinyl.
2016-10-27 01:37:51	strepto	read: Impossible.
2016-10-27 01:38:03	alyptik	oh on straight vinyl? no way for me ever
2016-10-27 01:38:11	alyptik	with mixxx i have maybe 40% success

2016-10-27 06:25:09	@phusion	no amount of flyers would fix that

2016-10-27 06:30:09	@phusion	yeah, usually the clubs just want to sell booze and thats it
2016-10-27 06:30:41	@phusion	whelp, dunno, winter is not a good time for music really, but I'll try and look around
2016-10-27 06:32:21	toastercookie	i mean around here winter is prime clubbing hours
2016-10-27 06:32:26	toastercookie	theres less competition from festies and stuff

2016-10-27 13:15:42	alyptik	no one talks about 10's 30's
2016-10-27 13:15:46	alyptik	must have been boring
2016-10-27 13:16:00	alyptik	i usually troll mixcloud
2016-10-27 13:16:03	alyptik	but the app is so bad
2016-10-27 13:16:08	@djdementia	or listening to 'song radio' for other tracks i like
2016-10-27 13:16:22	@djdementia	well the 1930s was the great depression
2016-10-27 13:16:25	alyptik	ah true

2016-10-27 13:16:39	alyptik	lol
2016-10-27 13:16:54	@djdementia	part of the reason that the 20s were so great was becasue it was a 'bubble'
2016-10-27 13:16:59	@djdementia	and the bubble burst in the 30s
2016-10-27 13:17:13	@djdementia	just like the savings & loan bubbles of the 80s
2016-10-27 13:17:19	@djdementia	and mortgage bubble of the 2000s

2016-10-27 13:20:39	toastercookie	haha
2016-10-27 13:20:40	@djdementia	it's kind of interesting to hear all that stuff
2016-10-27 13:20:52	@djdementia	it gives me some perspective on pop DJing
2016-10-27 13:20:58	toastercookie	HAY GUYS I HEARD U LIKE SHINY SAW SYNTHS AND PITCHED UP VOCALS
2016-10-27 13:21:03	toastercookie	- every "future bass" producer
2016-10-27 13:21:03	@djdementia	this is essentially like a mobile/event DJ list
2016-10-27 13:21:06	alyptik	pop DJing is actually kinda hard 
2016-10-27 13:21:10	toastercookie	oh def
2016-10-27 13:21:23	toastercookie	way harder to mix songs with vocals constantly
2016-10-27 13:21:31	@djdementia	i have a nice set of mobile dj speakers and lights now
2016-10-27 13:21:39	@djdementia	i thought about maybe doing some mobile / event gigs
2016-10-27 13:21:41	alyptik	but i am also the type of person who goes mad if songs arent in a related key
2016-10-27 13:22:05	@djdementia	you just don't beatmatch
2016-10-27 13:22:17	alyptik	so fast cuts only?
2016-10-27 13:22:18	@djdementia	ever see my write up on how to dj for mixed party / pop events ?
2016-10-27 13:22:24	alyptik	i have not
2016-10-27 13:22:26	@djdementia	no, not exactly fast
2016-10-27 13:22:37	@djdementia	one day i'm going to record a YT tutorial for this
2016-10-27 13:22:43	@djdementia	it gets asked like once a month in /r/beatmatch
2016-10-27 13:23:11	alyptik	i havent looked into it too much, just tried it once, sucked, and went back to psy hah
2016-10-27 13:24:12	alyptik	also i feel like i am the only person who hates yt tutorials and loves articles
2016-10-27 13:24:15	alyptik	heh

2016-10-27 13:25:05	@djdementia	^^^^
2016-10-27 13:25:17	alyptik	oh sick
2016-10-27 13:25:27	@djdementia	although that was about mixing trap with house, this applies to any way to transition between widely different BPM and styles
2016-10-27 13:25:45	alyptik	oh you go by time
2016-10-27 13:25:47	@djdementia	you can mix Hip Hop with Pop Alternative rock using that method
2016-10-27 13:25:52	alyptik	that will be super weird for me lol
2016-10-27 13:26:03	alyptik	makes sense though
2016-10-27 13:26:04	@djdementia	that's how i started djing back in 1999 ;)
2016-10-27 13:26:21	@djdementia	didn't even have pitch control on the first setup i used
2016-10-27 13:26:25	alyptik	i have counted vinyl rings before
2016-10-27 13:26:27	alyptik	good fun
2016-10-27 13:27:17	toastercookie	trap and house are decently easy to mix together even if you are beatmatching tho
2016-10-27 13:27:17		[13:27]
2016-10-27 13:27:24	alyptik	djdementia› very creative, never would have thought of your method for pop
2016-10-27 13:27:28	toastercookie	just mix dueing buildups or whatever
2016-10-27 13:27:39	toastercookie	or breakdowns or something
2016-10-27 13:27:42	@phusion	^^
2016-10-27 13:27:46	@djdementia	thanks alyptik
2016-10-27 13:27:46	@phusion	been my method
2016-10-27 13:28:13	toastercookie	i love it when i match the builds of 2 songs exactly
2016-10-27 13:28:19	toastercookie	thats the best way to switch genres
2016-10-27 13:28:23	@djdementia	it seems like a lot of work at first alyptik but it's actually quite simple just keep a notepad near you
2016-10-27 13:28:23	toastercookie	plus crowds love it
2016-10-27 13:28:45	alyptik	i am never going to be a part of https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kP7ynMu8umFJdnL8ebACUCEfcxRafcnCojneC8G0HOQ/edit#gid=1314217352 it seems

2016-10-27 13:28:49	alyptik	is it still maintained?
2016-10-27 13:28:56	@djdementia	also what i do is anytime i end up mixing tracks using that method i usually edit the comments and type in the comments the transition times for that song so next time i am good to go
2016-10-27 13:28:56	toastercookie	lol
2016-10-27 13:29:01	toastercookie	nice
2016-10-27 13:29:51	@djdementia	so you beatmatch ~80bpm trap with ~125 bpm house toastercookie?
2016-10-27 13:29:59	toastercookie	well clearly not
2016-10-27 13:30:12	toastercookie	theres plenty of slower trap than that tho
2016-10-27 13:30:14	@djdementia	or do you mean only if you can get them lined up with like double BPM?
2016-10-27 13:30:18	toastercookie	yeah
2016-10-27 13:30:19	toastercookie	that
2016-10-27 13:30:24	@djdementia	ok yeah that's different
2016-10-27 13:30:28	alyptik	double BPM is fun to pull off
2016-10-27 13:30:42	@djdementia	i'm talking about two completely different BPMs that you can't quite match up with any sensical multiplier
2016-10-27 13:30:52	alyptik	7/8
2016-10-27 13:30:53	alyptik	hah
2016-10-27 13:30:54	toastercookie	yeah for sure
2016-10-27 13:30:56	toastercookie	i get what you are saying
2016-10-27 13:31:14	toastercookie	often i will go from like 65->130 ish
2016-10-27 13:31:20	alyptik	this is nice too because time sig is irrelevant
2016-10-27 13:31:36	@djdementia	yeah you can use this time method to completely switch genres
2016-10-27 13:31:46	@djdementia	if you found yourself at a dead end genre wise or dancefloor wise
2016-10-27 13:31:49	@djdementia	and need to do a wipe
2016-10-27 13:31:55	@djdementia	wipes are sometimes necessary
2016-10-27 13:32:03	alyptik	more creative than backspin
2016-10-27 13:32:05	toastercookie	for sure
2016-10-27 13:32:05	alyptik	rofl
2016-10-27 13:32:15	toastercookie	i will often just like filter fade out and then start the new track at a quiet part
2016-10-27 13:32:23	toastercookie	not super technical but nobody really cares but me
2016-10-27 13:32:31	alyptik	my mixer has the worst filter in the world
2016-10-27 13:32:42	alyptik	50% wet at max
2016-10-27 13:32:44	alyptik	zz

2016-10-27 22:29:50	@djdementia	[23:30:24] ok yeah that's different [23:30:24]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	alyptik	[23:30:28] double BPM is fun to pull off [23:30:28]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	@djdementia	[23:30:42] i'm talking about two completely different BPMs that you can't quite match up with any sensical multiplier [23:30:42]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	alyptik	[23:30:52] 7/8 [23:30:52]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	alyptik	[23:30:54] hah [23:30:54]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	toastercookie	[23:30:54] yeah for sure [23:30:54]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	toastercookie	[23:30:56] i get what you are saying [23:30:56]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	toastercookie	[23:31:14] often i will go from like 65->130 ish [23:31:14]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	alyptik	[23:31:20] this is nice too because time sig is irrelevant [23:31:20]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	@djdementia	[23:31:36] yeah you can use this time method to completely switch genres [23:31:36]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	@djdementia	[23:31:46] if you found yourself at a dead end genre wise or dancefloor wise [23:31:46]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	@djdementia	[23:31:49] and need to do a wipe [23:31:49]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	@djdementia	[23:31:55] wipes are sometimes necessary [23:31:55]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	alyptik	[23:32:03] more creative than backspin [23:32:03]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	toastercookie	[23:32:05] for sure [23:32:05]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	alyptik	[23:32:05] rofl [23:32:05]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	toastercookie	[23:32:15] i will often just like filter fade out and then start the new track at a quiet part [23:32:15]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	toastercookie	[23:32:23] not super technical but nobody really cares but me [23:32:23]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	alyptik	[23:32:31] my mixer has the worst filter in the world [23:32:31]

2016-10-28 22:29:33	@phusion	[20:05:49] for $550 or so [20:05:49]

2016-10-29 11:05:03	alyptik	yup :D i liked the progression a lot
2016-10-29 11:06:31	strepto	I made an attempt on layering deep house tonight, but since I lack the ability to plan my set, and just play whatever the hell I want - I fucked up on a few tracks.
2016-10-29 11:06:48	strepto	90% is good, 10% makes me want to throw myself of a cliff.

2016-10-29 11:10:31	alyptik	i do that too lol
2016-10-29 11:10:40	alyptik	it's good though, no way to can plan live anyway
2016-10-29 11:11:06	alyptik	well you can if you really wanted to i guess but meh
2016-10-29 11:14:07	strepto	I think this is my biggest flaw as a DJ, not having the patience to prepare and plan.
2016-10-29 11:14:53	strepto	I just feel like it becomes so sleek, so .. i don't know that the right word to use it. So polished. And with seamless mixes, going tune by tune, it's just another mix in the sea of mixes from wannabe-DJs (like myself).
2016-10-29 11:15:31	alyptik	the flawlessness most of the time isn't from planning; just a lot of practice
2016-10-29 11:15:41	strepto	For me, going on a whim feels like more of a challenge. You have to be able to make adjustments on the spot, and if you stray from the path of awesomenes, you have to get that fixed ASAP.
2016-10-29 11:15:42	alyptik	and knowing your music; kinda planning actually
2016-10-29 11:16:00	strepto	Also, I got the Beatport dissease.
2016-10-29 11:16:17	strepto	I've burned 400USD so far this month..
2016-10-29 11:16:24	alyptik	lol
2016-10-29 11:16:27	strepto	I'm an idiot.
2016-10-29 11:16:31	alyptik	nah
2016-10-29 11:16:32	strepto	Is what it boils down to.
2016-10-29 11:16:39	alyptik	a sucker yes
2016-10-29 11:16:41	alyptik	sucker for music
2016-10-29 11:16:45	alyptik	just like all of us
2016-10-29 11:17:19	strepto	The very first thing I did when I decided to go serious with mixing (I don't call it DJing, because I haven't earned that yet.)
2016-10-29 11:17:27	strepto	.. was to delete all my music.
2016-10-29 11:17:29	strepto	Everything.
2016-10-29 11:17:52	strepto	Didn't keep anything at all. Only exception was old dnb mixes from a friend of mine.
2016-10-29 11:18:22	alyptik	ack
2016-10-29 11:18:25	alyptik	how come?
2016-10-29 11:18:34	alyptik	copyright?
2016-10-29 11:18:45	strepto	Yes.
2016-10-29 11:18:53	alyptik	thats some dedication, heh
2016-10-29 11:19:18	strepto	I kept what I had on CD from before, and a few mixes that I just couldn't live without, and I got rid of the rest.
2016-10-29 11:19:22	strepto	I'm an idiot.
2016-10-29 11:19:24	strepto	I never start small.
2016-10-29 11:19:30	strepto	If I decide to do something, I go all in.
2016-10-29 11:19:33	alyptik	lol
2016-10-29 11:20:05	strepto	So I've been eating oatmeal for a month now, every single day, saving up money for music and DJ tutoring.
2016-10-29 11:20:05		[11:20]
2016-10-29 11:21:17	alyptik	tutoring?
2016-10-29 11:21:26	alyptik	like a mentor thing?
2016-10-29 11:25:32	strepto	Yes, I have a tutor.
2016-10-29 11:26:26	alyptik	cool
2016-10-29 11:26:48	strepto	Phil Morse
2016-10-29 11:29:42	strepto	Fuck my life. I had a track labelled as Deep House, and it's classic House.
2016-10-29 11:29:44	strepto	DEAR LORD
2016-10-29 11:29:48	strepto	Please kill me now.
2016-10-29 11:30:18	alyptik	i don't know the difference :[
2016-10-29 11:30:32	strepto	Ever been to a gay bar? That's House.
2016-10-29 11:30:38	alyptik	for trance the only real 'deep' trance is old school 13min shit
2016-10-29 11:30:42	strepto	Ever been to a cool bar? THat's Deep House.
2016-10-29 11:30:46	alyptik	the deep/classic i mean
2016-10-29 11:31:08	alyptik	oh i see
2016-10-29 11:31:11	alyptik	what about classic?
2016-10-29 11:31:19	strepto	Classic House?
2016-10-29 11:31:22	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-29 11:31:29	strepto	I'd argue that "classic" house is just .. house. 
2016-10-29 11:31:30	alyptik	does it have a sound to it
2016-10-29 11:31:35	alyptik	oh so not really
2016-10-29 11:31:37	strepto	Some would perhaps say that "classic house" is "disco"
2016-10-29 11:31:44	strepto	I don't like House.
2016-10-29 11:32:01	alyptik	i am undecided
2016-10-29 11:32:05	strepto	Classic house. The .. witty gritty happy fun House with .. .. you know.
2016-10-29 11:32:07	alyptik	i don't really understand it enough
2016-10-29 11:32:56	strepto	Basically, House music is light, "happy tunes", vocals, etc.
2016-10-29 11:33:24	alyptik	but then you hear people say electro house
2016-10-29 11:33:29	strepto	Deep House is the last stop before you hit Tech House. Next stop "down" after Tech House is Techno.
2016-10-29 11:33:32	alyptik	not really electro or house to me
2016-10-29 11:33:37	strepto	Electro house is a whole different thing.
2016-10-29 11:33:43	strepto	Let's not even go there.
2016-10-29 11:33:54	alyptik	yeah people don't understand what electro actually is
2016-10-29 11:33:58	alyptik	most would hate it
2016-10-29 11:34:26	alyptik	i am guilty of it myself; first time i heard electro i was like wdf
2016-10-29 11:34:33	alyptik	i have been labeling myself as this
2016-10-29 11:35:43	alyptik	pretty much after that was when i moved away from just playing Steve Aoki all night

2016-10-29 12:25:07	alyptik	[21:30:18] i don't know the difference :[ [21:30:18]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	strepto	[21:30:32] Ever been to a gay bar? That's House. [21:30:32]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	alyptik	[21:30:38] for trance the only real 'deep' trance is old school 13min shit [21:30:38]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	strepto	[21:30:42] Ever been to a cool bar? THat's Deep House. [21:30:42]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	alyptik	[21:30:46] the deep/classic i mean [21:30:46]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	alyptik	[21:31:08] oh i see [21:31:08]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	alyptik	[21:31:11] what about classic? [21:31:11]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	strepto	[21:31:19] Classic House? [21:31:19]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	alyptik	[21:31:22] yeah [21:31:22]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	strepto	[21:31:29] I'd argue that "classic" house is just .. house.  [21:31:29]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	alyptik	[21:31:30] does it have a sound to it [21:31:30]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	alyptik	[21:31:35] oh so not really [21:31:35]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	strepto	[21:31:37] Some would perhaps say that "classic house" is "disco" [21:31:37]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	strepto	[21:31:44] I don't like House. [21:31:44]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	alyptik	[21:32:01] i am undecided [21:32:01]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	strepto	[21:32:05] Classic house. The .. witty gritty happy fun House with .. .. you know. [21:32:05]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	alyptik	[21:32:07] i don't really understand it enough [21:32:07]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	strepto	[21:32:56] Basically, House music is light, "happy tunes", vocals, etc. [21:32:56]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	alyptik	[21:33:24] but then you hear people say electro house [21:33:24]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	strepto	[21:33:29] Deep House is the last stop before you hit Tech House. Next stop "down" after Tech House is Techno. [21:33:29]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	alyptik	[21:33:32] not really electro or house to me [21:33:32]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	strepto	[21:33:37] Electro house is a whole different thing. [21:33:37]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	strepto	[21:33:43] Let's not even go there. [21:33:43]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	alyptik	[21:33:54] yeah people don't understand what electro actually is [21:33:54]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	alyptik	[21:33:58] most would hate it [21:33:58]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	alyptik	[21:34:26] i am guilty of it myself; first time i heard electro i was like wdf [21:34:26]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	alyptik	[21:34:33] i have been labeling myself as this [21:34:33]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	alyptik	[21:35:43] pretty much after that was when i moved away from just playing Steve Aoki all night [21:35:43]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	alyptik	[21:35:54] was an auspicious day [21:35:54]

2016-10-29 23:10:15	alyptik	[21:32:07] i don't really understand it enough [21:32:07]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	strepto	[21:32:56] Basically, House music is light, "happy tunes", vocals, etc. [21:32:56]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	alyptik	[21:33:24] but then you hear people say electro house [21:33:24]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	strepto	[21:33:29] Deep House is the last stop before you hit Tech House. Next stop "down" after Tech House is Techno. [21:33:29]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	alyptik	[21:33:32] not really electro or house to me [21:33:32]

2016-10-29 23:10:15	alyptik	[21:34:26] i am guilty of it myself; first time i heard electro i was like wdf [21:34:26]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	alyptik	[21:34:33] i have been labeling myself as this [21:34:33]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	alyptik	[21:35:43] pretty much after that was when i moved away from just playing Steve Aoki all night [21:35:43]

2016-10-31 16:21:05	alyptik	[21:33:24] but then you hear people say electro house [21:33:24]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	strepto	[21:33:29] Deep House is the last stop before you hit Tech House. Next stop "down" after Tech House is Techno. [21:33:29]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	alyptik	[21:33:32] not really electro or house to me [21:33:32]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	strepto	[21:33:37] Electro house is a whole different thing. [21:33:37]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	strepto	[21:33:43] Let's not even go there. [21:33:43]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	alyptik	[21:33:54] yeah people don't understand what electro actually is [21:33:54]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	alyptik	[21:33:58] most would hate it [21:33:58]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	alyptik	[21:34:26] i am guilty of it myself; first time i heard electro i was like wdf [21:34:26]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	alyptik	[21:34:33] i have been labeling myself as this [21:34:33]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	alyptik	[21:35:43] pretty much after that was when i moved away from just playing Steve Aoki all night [21:35:43]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	alyptik	[21:35:54] was an auspicious day [21:35:54]

2016-10-31 20:52:25	d_2k	just found this IRC channel so i figured i'd pop in for a sec
2016-10-31 20:53:26	d_2k	trying to find some new tech house and figured this might be a good place to ask about where to look also
2016-10-31 20:54:06	@phusion	well
2016-10-31 20:54:22	@phusion	thank you very much for coming by, we've been here for fucking years, but for the last 16 months or so we've been really.. dead
2016-10-31 20:54:31	@phusion	we have plenty of house heads in here
2016-10-31 20:54:39	@phusion	it's just a matter of rousing them from their slumber
2016-10-31 20:54:54	@phusion	we're usually active 8-5, work hours, lots of us are in IT
2016-10-31 20:54:56	@phusion	myself included
2016-10-31 20:55:08	@phusion	I spin glitch hop and mid tempo bass music, funky stuff
2016-10-31 20:55:18	d_2k	nice nice
2016-10-31 20:55:26	@phusion	had a residency at a shitty bar for 3 years, but quit recently because of bullshit
2016-10-31 20:55:37	d_2k	i play a lot of different stuff from techno, to liquid dnb
2016-10-31 20:55:43	d_2k	ah i know how that goes
2016-10-31 20:55:46	@phusion	long story short, the guy dating the owner of the bar brought me in to replace some friends of mine who moved up the chain
2016-10-31 20:55:58	@phusion	he's an alcoholic wife beater
2016-10-31 20:56:08	@phusion	so on top of being a steller guy and hitting his gf when drunk
2016-10-31 20:56:12	d_2k	sounds like a real shithead
2016-10-31 20:56:21	@phusion	he alienated, pissed off or 86'd my friends and my supporting DJs
2016-10-31 20:56:48	@phusion	so last month I did a gig and the sound guy wanted half my pay to just fix the level on my tracks
2016-10-31 20:57:00	@phusion	and then told me I didn't promote enough (via owner)
2016-10-31 20:57:12	@phusion	yeah, sorry, I work full time and no amount of flyers will fix the collosal fuckup 
2016-10-31 20:57:18	d_2k	lol
2016-10-31 20:57:20	@phusion	the owner has since broke it off with that idiot
2016-10-31 20:57:26	@phusion	but the damage was done years ago
2016-10-31 20:57:40	@phusion	and I've been playing for randoms instead of a steady group of friends for a LONG time now
2016-10-31 20:58:03	@phusion	and nothing short of a new group of friends who don't hate the bar will fix that, so, let some other guy do it
2016-10-31 20:58:03		[20:58]
2016-10-31 20:58:12	@phusion	I'd love to keep playing, but yeah, bullshit

2016-10-31 20:58:50	d_2k	i havent played out in a few years

2016-11-02 00:56:15	d_2k	[06:56:12] sounds like a real shithead [06:56:12]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	@phusion	[06:56:21] he alienated, pissed off or 86'd my friends and my supporting DJs [06:56:21]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	@phusion	[06:56:48] so last month I did a gig and the sound guy wanted half my pay to just fix the level on my tracks [06:56:48]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	@phusion	[06:57:00] and then told me I didn't promote enough (via owner) [06:57:00]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	@phusion	[06:57:12] yeah, sorry, I work full time and no amount of flyers will fix the collosal fuckup  [06:57:12]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	d_2k	[06:57:18] lol [06:57:18]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	@phusion	[06:57:20] the owner has since broke it off with that idiot [06:57:20]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	@phusion	[06:57:26] but the damage was done years ago [06:57:26]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	@phusion	[06:57:40] and I've been playing for randoms instead of a steady group of friends for a LONG time now [06:57:40]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	@phusion	[06:58:03] and nothing short of a new group of friends who don't hate the bar will fix that, so, let some other guy do it [06:58:03]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	@phusion	[06:58:12] I'd love to keep playing, but yeah, bullshit [06:58:12]

2016-11-02 23:27:12	@djdementia	[22:01:07] on windows it works good if you have a controller with multiple outputs [22:01:07]
2016-11-02 23:27:12	@djdementia	[22:01:14] and can just route one of the outputs to your line in on your laptop [22:01:14]

2016-11-03 13:30:51	alyptik	i am use a ghetto DVS setup atm
2016-11-03 13:31:01	_rgb_	lolol
2016-11-03 13:31:04	alyptik	3 UFO202 soundcards one for each deack
2016-11-03 13:31:07	alyptik	one for cue
2016-11-03 13:31:11	alyptik	deck*
2016-11-03 13:33:16	_rgb_	i borrowed a Rane SL1 to test DVS
2016-11-03 13:33:30	alyptik	mine works pretty well considering
2016-11-03 13:33:34	alyptik	how does that SL1 fare?
2016-11-03 13:35:47	_rgb_	i was told that it wouldn't work well, but seems fine to me. the only problem i have is the pitch bend constantly fluctuating by tiny amounts. never stays on one number. i don't think that's because of the interface though.
2016-11-03 13:35:53	_rgb_	pegasus said it's normal

2016-11-03 13:36:17	_rgb_	first time trying DVS with mixxx tho
2016-11-03 13:36:29	_rgb_	so i don't have anything to compare it against
2016-11-03 13:37:05	alyptik	that is prob a turntable thing yeah
2016-11-03 13:37:05		[13:37]
2016-11-03 13:37:16	alyptik	even my technics flutter/wow at times
2016-11-03 13:37:39	alyptik	imo it is a little less accurate than serato
2016-11-03 13:37:50	alyptik	but awesome for being free and not needing a serato interface
2016-11-03 13:38:01	alyptik	RCA line in DVS is the shit
2016-11-03 13:43:59	_rgb_	mine isn't *true* DVS... i have 2 Denon S3700 CDJs with a built-in timecode mode
2016-11-03 13:44:13	_rgb_	"hybrid midi"
2016-11-03 13:44:16	alyptik	oh and it flutters still? that's kinda odd
2016-11-03 13:44:26	_rgb_	lolrite
2016-11-03 13:47:39	_rgb_	i plan to try it with actual serato CDs soon, just to see if it makes a difference. i doubt it will tho...
2016-11-03 13:48:54	toastercookie	HID mode or nothing imo
2016-11-03 13:48:58	alyptik	worth a shot since they are free anyway
2016-11-03 13:54:00		[13:48]
2016-11-03 14:06:00	_rgb_	i haven't tried midi or hid with these decks yet
2016-11-03 14:06:10	_rgb_	no existing mappings for mixxx
2016-11-03 14:06:44	_rgb_	might be the better option since they have built in audio interfaces too

2016-11-03 22:49:42	_rgb_	[23:33:16] i borrowed a Rane SL1 to test DVS [23:33:16]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	alyptik	[23:33:30] mine works pretty well considering [23:33:30]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	alyptik	[23:33:34] how does that SL1 fare? [23:33:34]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	_rgb_	[23:35:47] i was told that it wouldn't work well, but seems fine to me. the only problem i have is the pitch bend constantly fluctuating by tiny amounts. never stays on one number. i don't think that's because of the interface though. [23:35:47]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	_rgb_	[23:35:53] pegasus said it's normal [23:35:53]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	_rgb_	[23:36:17] first time trying DVS with mixxx tho [23:36:17]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	_rgb_	[23:36:29] so i don't have anything to compare it against [23:36:29]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	alyptik	[23:37:05] that is prob a turntable thing yeah [23:37:05]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	alyptik	[23:37:16] even my technics flutter/wow at times [23:37:16]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	alyptik	[23:37:39] imo it is a little less accurate than serato [23:37:39]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	alyptik	[23:37:50] but awesome for being free and not needing a serato interface [23:37:50]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	alyptik	[23:38:01] RCA line in DVS is the shit [23:38:01]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	_rgb_	[23:43:59] mine isn't *true* DVS... i have 2 Denon S3700 CDJs with a built-in timecode mode [23:43:59]

2016-11-03 22:49:42	alyptik	[23:48:58] worth a shot since they are free anyway [23:48:58]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	_rgb_	[00:06:00] i haven't tried midi or hid with these decks yet [00:06:00]

2016-11-04 14:59:32	alyptik	[23:30:51] i am use a ghetto DVS setup atm [23:30:51]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	_rgb_	[23:31:01] lolol [23:31:01]

2016-11-04 14:59:32	_rgb_	[23:33:16] i borrowed a Rane SL1 to test DVS [23:33:16]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	alyptik	[23:33:30] mine works pretty well considering [23:33:30]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	alyptik	[23:33:34] how does that SL1 fare? [23:33:34]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	_rgb_	[23:35:47] i was told that it wouldn't work well, but seems fine to me. the only problem i have is the pitch bend constantly fluctuating by tiny amounts. never stays on one number. i don't think that's because of the interface though. [23:35:47]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	_rgb_	[23:35:53] pegasus said it's normal [23:35:53]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	_rgb_	[23:36:17] first time trying DVS with mixxx tho [23:36:17]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	_rgb_	[23:36:29] so i don't have anything to compare it against [23:36:29]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	alyptik	[23:37:05] that is prob a turntable thing yeah [23:37:05]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	alyptik	[23:37:16] even my technics flutter/wow at times [23:37:16]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	alyptik	[23:37:39] imo it is a little less accurate than serato [23:37:39]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	alyptik	[23:37:50] but awesome for being free and not needing a serato interface [23:37:50]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	alyptik	[23:38:01] RCA line in DVS is the shit [23:38:01]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	_rgb_	[23:43:59] mine isn't *true* DVS... i have 2 Denon S3700 CDJs with a built-in timecode mode [23:43:59]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	_rgb_	[23:44:13] "hybrid midi" [23:44:13]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	alyptik	[23:44:16] oh and it flutters still? that's kinda odd [23:44:16]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	_rgb_	[23:44:26] lolrite [23:44:26]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	_rgb_	[23:47:39] i plan to try it with actual serato CDs soon, just to see if it makes a difference. i doubt it will tho... [23:47:39]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	toastercookie	[23:48:54] HID mode or nothing imo [23:48:54]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	alyptik	[23:48:58] worth a shot since they are free anyway [23:48:58]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	_rgb_	[00:06:00] i haven't tried midi or hid with these decks yet [00:06:00]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	_rgb_	[00:06:10] no existing mappings for mixxx [00:06:10]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	_rgb_	[00:06:44] might be the better option since they have built in audio interfaces too [00:06:44]

2016-11-04 16:45:24	_rgb_	[23:35:47] i was told that it wouldn't work well, but seems fine to me. the only problem i have is the pitch bend constantly fluctuating by tiny amounts. never stays on one number. i don't think that's because of the interface though. [23:35:47]
2016-11-04 16:45:24	_rgb_	[23:35:53] pegasus said it's normal [23:35:53]

2016-11-04 16:45:24	alyptik	[23:37:39] imo it is a little less accurate than serato [23:37:39]
2016-11-04 16:45:24	alyptik	[23:37:50] but awesome for being free and not needing a serato interface [23:37:50]
