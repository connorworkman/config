2016-09-15 20:39:17	mantra	ezio: ok I see. i think they are trying to show that the euclidean norm is indeed a norm. but they are using properties of the dot or inner product to do that

2016-09-15 20:43:11	ezio	i get that
2016-09-15 20:43:22	ezio	that's probably the easiest thing since i hit length
2016-09-15 20:43:27	mantra	this is less circular than assuming that R^n is an inner product space in order to show that it's a normed space

2016-09-15 20:44:02	ezio	so normalizing will be helpful in finding colinear vectors?

2016-09-15 22:51:08	boarders	you sort of indicate what you would like with the above but it is weird, am I taking the 8% around 3 or around 3.5
2016-09-15 22:51:54	lieven	something like |a-b|/(|a+b|/2)<0.08 perhaps if you want to be symmetric in a and b

For example finding the solution to y'' + y = t^2 + 2 with y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = -1 the LHS would be LHS = Y(s)(s^2 + 1) - s + 1 and RHS = L{t^2} + L{2} = 2/s^3 + 2/s. Setting LHS = RHS and solving for Y(s) would give me Y(s) = [2/s^3 + 2/s + s - 1] / (s^2 +1), how on earth should

IIUC it goes like this: f is analytic <=> Taylor series <=> first-order local approximation, so expanding around z0, f'(z-z0) ~ f(z0) + zf'(z0) = some complex number + an amplitwist applied to z. But z -> z* is a reflection not an amplitwist.

2016-09-16 03:14:16	fxh	doesn't f_v evaluate a linear functional?
2016-09-16 03:14:21	Millennial	yes
2016-09-16 03:14:39	Millennial	wait, isn't that their attempt at defining f_v
2016-09-16 03:14:45	Millennial	is it supposed to be something else
2016-09-16 03:15:08	fxh	f_v is defined as taking a linear functional and evaluating it at a point
2016-09-16 03:15:12	Millennial	yes
2016-09-16 03:15:21	fxh	can I send a picture?
2016-09-16 03:15:26	Millennial	sure
2016-09-16 03:15:58	meglomaniac	Millennial could you really quickly help me verify something, I promise its a really simple problem
2016-09-16 03:16:12	Millennial	meglomaniac: if it's really simple then do it yourself :I

2016-09-16 04:31:50	baxx	Indivicivet: so if i set it up as 1/2 = e^{-a*24} then I can take logs and divide through by 24 giving ( ln[1] - ln[2] )/(24) = a ... but i'm not sure how to check this answer given the exponent of the first time t = 0 is just zero

When the girl rotates around her self with the arms closed she gains rotational speed, when she opens her arms, she loses speed. You can do the experiment with a desk chair. The reason for this is due to the conservation of L. You gain distance from
2016-09-16 06:23:19	mokuso	rotational axis, you lose speed. You lose distance, you gain speed. Same happens with spining tops and rotating stars.

2016-09-16 06:27:58	hk238	hmm is it correct that you can think about it as holding a barbell in each hand, and rotating, is like the barbells have momentum that's orthogonal with respect to your position, and the tension of your arms or similar thing, pulls the barbells inward, which then curves their motion, so they're kind of like orbiting
2016-09-16 06:28:28	hk238	so when you pull your hands and the barbells closer, it's sort of like the speed of the barbells remains the same, so you end up spinning faster

2016-09-16 11:07:15	Millennial	boarders: it's like asking "compute the minimal polynomial of 2 + 2^(1/5) + 3*2^(2/5) over Q" in a galois theory exam imo
2016-09-16 11:07:17	Millennial	it's just plain stupid
2016-09-16 11:07:45	sure	its always nice to know students can do things explicitely tho
2016-09-16 11:07:47	sure	its important
2016-09-16 11:07:51	sure	but you have to choose good examples
2016-09-16 11:08:02	boarders	Millennial: I agree, especially as computers are good at doing it. If anything learning the algorithm means we should say: "cool now let's leave that to the computer"
2016-09-16 11:08:17	Millennial	well, understanding the algorithm is important
2016-09-16 11:08:18	sure	its completely useless to know bunch of theory if you don't know how to relate it to concrete computations and concrete example
2016-09-16 11:08:22	boarders	and it behooves us to come up with very symmetrical or interesting examples in exam questions
2016-09-16 11:08:24	Millennial	so i would probably say
2016-09-16 11:08:42	Millennial	"describe an algorithm to find the minimal polynomial of some element in a number field"
2016-09-16 11:08:47	boarders	like instead of computing a random determinant you should compute the determinant of the vandermonde matrix or similarly symmetrical examples
2016-09-16 11:08:52	Millennial	ya, sure
2016-09-16 11:09:06	sure	even the determinant of the vandermonde isn't easy to find
2016-09-16 11:09:08	sure	if you don't know the result
2016-09-16 11:09:16	sure	but its a nice result to know

2016-09-16 11:09:51	Millennial	boarders: you can find it without doing anything, tbh
2016-09-16 11:10:03	sure	yeah, just by noticing its a poylnomial and balblabla

2016-09-16 11:10:20	sure	this also works for cauchy-like determinant Millennial
2016-09-16 11:10:28	Millennial	sure: or for the sylvester determinant
2016-09-16 11:10:33	Millennial	in fact, i don't know another proof of that one
2016-09-16 11:10:36	sure	those are nice methofs to know too
2016-09-16 11:10:48	--	Maxdaman1us is now known as Maxdamantus
2016-09-16 11:10:51	boarders	though that is a cheat for an elementary course as you are using that you can take the determinant of a matrix with elements in a polynomial ring
2016-09-16 11:10:58	boarders	which is obvious but maybe not known to the students
2016-09-16 11:11:14	boarders	then again they do it all the time with characteristic polynomial and the world keeps spinning so whatever
2016-09-16 11:11:17	Millennial	lol
2016-09-16 11:11:42	sure	in any case

2016-09-16 11:36:09	harrynoob	is that an axiom of yours?

2016-09-16 11:49:26	tom99	and it doesn't impact the axiom system
2016-09-16 11:49:32	drdo	Most mathematics deals with unproblematic ideas that will be true in every theory that people would consider reasonable

2016-09-16 11:49:38	Millennial	you don't even need to formalize calculus to apply it to real life

2016-09-16 11:49:54	Millennial	that's not the problem here
2016-09-16 11:50:05	sure	f(e_i) is a vector of W, so it can be decomposed inside the basis {f_j}, say, f(e_i) = sum_j={1^n} F_ji f_j where F_ji are the j-th component of f(e_i)
2016-09-16 11:50:09	Millennial	the problem is that mathematicians are the ones playing this game
2016-09-16 11:50:10	boarders	well I don't think of mathematics as subservient to how engineers use it so I don't see why the axiomatic system needs justifying in those terms

2016-09-16 12:20:50	Millennial	a^(p-1) = 1 always

2016-09-16 12:21:36	bollu	no?
2016-09-16 12:21:38	Millennial	how do you show that it's always -1 for a nonsquare?
2016-09-16 12:21:48	Millennial	how do you show that it's -1 for anything at all :o
2016-09-16 12:21:52	Millennial	maybe it's just 1 for every number
2016-09-16 12:22:01	bollu	Millennial: because it's obviously a homomorphism now
2016-09-16 12:22:06	Millennial	that doesn't matter
2016-09-16 12:22:09	Millennial	it could be the trivial homomorphism
2016-09-16 12:22:10	Karlo_	Even if it's 1 for every number, it's still a homomorphism (just not onto).
2016-09-16 12:22:10	bollu	Millennial: so now we have some kernel
2016-09-16 12:22:12	boarders	Millennial: I was taking CH as the statement that a set either is countable or has same size as R
2016-09-16 12:22:13	bollu	Millennial: okay, fair
2016-09-16 12:22:21	boarders	and it is not obvious for closed sets for my definition of obvious
2016-09-16 12:22:26	Guest44317	I just created a markov chain of this channel. It is really bad.
2016-09-16 12:22:30	boarders	i.e. it follows from the Cantor-Bendixson theorem
2016-09-16 12:22:45	bollu	Millennial: hm, okay. I could show the existence of an element such that a^(p - 1)/2 = -1
2016-09-16 12:22:47	Karlo_	Oh, I guess the goal was to show that "half map to -1"
2016-09-16 12:22:48	SuperEgg	You can expand the archemedean property to integers, correct? For all a,b >0 There exists N in natural such that aN>=b.
2016-09-16 12:22:55	bollu	Millennial: then the "rest of the elements" would be forced to exist

2016-09-16 12:57:12	Karlo_	soLucien: But in my |A|=5 example, there are ten possible collisions, and you're not accounting for that at all.
2016-09-16 12:57:36	soLucien	if i have the hash function h(x) = x % 3 i would have one collision in the set {1,2,3,4}, namely 1-4

2016-09-16 13:15:13	Millennial	the quotient has order 2
2016-09-16 13:15:26	Millennial	and there's only one group of order 2
2016-09-16 13:15:31	Millennial	so the quotient must be that group

2016-09-16 13:45:34	antonfire	and keeping track of what multiples of x-1 you're subtracting off, of course.
2016-09-16 13:45:44	Simply	yeah

2016-09-16 13:50:45	antonfire	Plug in x = 1 into the polynomial at each intermediate step to figure out where.

2016-09-16 15:50:26	dalcde	This is actually the same as your original question - "you can't prove the axiom of choice if you don't accept the axiom of choice".
2016-09-16 15:50:31	StarshineSpark	anoteros: I'll do it too and then we compare the result :)
2016-09-16 15:50:40	dalcde	antonfire: Or rather easy examples in group theory.
2016-09-16 15:50:41	antonfire	e.g. Euclid's fifth axiom doesn't follow from the others, because there are models in which the others hold but Euclid's fifth does not.
2016-09-16 15:50:55	StarshineSpark	anoteros: results*
2016-09-16 15:51:01	antonfire	namely, projective geometry and hyperbolic geometry.
2016-09-16 15:51:12	a____ptr	so its more of  using some system WITHOUT the axiom of choice and see what follows?
2016-09-16 15:51:23	a____ptr	/consequences
2016-09-16 15:51:33	antonfire	"using" and "constructing a model" are different things.
2016-09-16 15:51:49	a____ptr	fair enough
2016-09-16 15:52:20	antonfire	Just using the first four of Euclid's axioms isn't the same thing as coming up with a system in which those four hold but the fifth one doesn't.

2016-09-16 15:54:34	a____ptr	oh
2016-09-16 15:55:43	antonfire	The point of actually giving an example of a system like that (e.g. hyperbolic geometry) is to convince yourself that you won't run into a contradiction if you assume the first four postulates and the negation of the fifth one.
2016-09-16 15:56:34	antonfire	If you just play around with the first four and the negation of the fifth one for a long time, you are basically just hoping that you don't run into a contradiction.

2016-09-16 16:32:29	antonfire	e.g. 3x-2 = 0 when x = 2/3, so any polynomial times (3x-2) should also evaluate to 0 at 2/3.
2016-09-16 16:32:32	Matt|home	yeah i found it weird too. there's workarounds, but this is the best option for my ass not dropping out right now

2016-09-16 16:32:55	esph	dude12312414: That was phrased incorrectly, sorry. What I want to determine is if there are a and b such that n = 3b + 5a, for some n, everything being integers.
2016-09-16 16:33:22	antonfire	Another thing you should know how to do when multiplying polynomials is to work out an individual coefficient of the product without working out all the rest, which lets you either compute or check them one by one.

2016-09-16 16:35:09	antonfire	e.g. the only way you can get a term with x^2 in it from the product (2x^3 - 3x^2 + x + 5)(3x - 2) is from multiplying x on the left with 3x on the right or from multiplying -3x^2 on the left with -2 on the right.
2016-09-16 16:35:13	dude12312414	since gcd(3, 5) = 1, it's easy to see which n can be expressed in that form

2016-09-16 16:37:22	antonfire	You can also be more systematic about how you write the terms down. When evaluating (2x^3 - 3x^2 + x + 5)(3x - 2), you could multiply out (2x^3 - 3x^2 + x + 5)(3x) on one row and multiply out (2x^3 - 3x^2 + x + 5)(-2) on the next row, but line them up so the x^3 terms are in the same column, the x^2 terms are in the same column, and so on,

2016-09-16 19:11:29	ottanta	like, given x+T, x has to be in the domain, so given a period 1, 0+1 is in the naturals, so for the naturals to be periodic by that definition, 0 would have to be in the naturals, which it either is or it isn't
2016-09-16 19:11:51	ottanta	if it is, then -1+1 = 0, -1+1 has to be in the naturals would imply, by that definition, that -1 is in the naturals, which regardless it isn't

2016-09-16 19:27:43	antonfire	They ought to tell you what kind of object A is before they ask you anything about it.
2016-09-16 19:28:02	dalcde	The kernel of A and A^T are subspaces of different spaces in general.
2016-09-16 19:28:08	mxms	Well, the assignment is on subspaces. So it's somewhat implied to be some sort of matrices
2016-09-16 19:28:23	dalcde	But to be less boring, you can consider the case where A is a square matrix, ie. an endomorphism.
2016-09-16 19:28:51	antonfire	If you want to be careful, prove the harder thing: it's not the case that for all square matrices A, N(A) = N(A^T).
2016-09-16 19:29:00	mxms	Yes, I should do that next
2016-09-16 19:29:39	mxms	Also, I don't really understand the "domain" and "range" of a matrix

2016-09-16 19:30:05	mxms	the domain is the row-space, and the range is the column space. But why is this?
2016-09-16 19:30:08	antonfire	Strictly speaking, you talk about the domain and range of a linear map associated to a matrix, not the domain and range of the matrix itself.
2016-09-16 19:30:16	mxms	I guess it makes sense if I express it as an outer product
2016-09-16 19:30:25	antonfire	So the answer is "that's the convention for associating a linear map to a matrix"
2016-09-16 19:30:27	mxms	Ok, that makes sense
2016-09-16 19:30:48	antonfire	Also, the domain isn't actually the row-space

2016-09-16 19:32:15	mxms	ok good so far
2016-09-16 19:32:22	tom99	here R^n is the cartesian product of R with itself n times which we know exists.
2016-09-16 19:32:23	antonfire	So the domain of the linear map associated to an m x n matrix is R^n, irrespective of what the rows of that matrix happen to span.

2016-09-16 19:32:58	antonfire	e.g. if M is the m x n matrix of all 0's, then the associated linear map L is still a map from R^n to R^m. Its domain is R^n, and its codomain is R^m.

2016-09-16 19:40:04	antonfire	(Strictly speaking if you're using a matrix to represent a map V -> W then the row space "lives in" V*.)

2016-09-16 19:46:19	antonfire	The usual process is you start with a matrix A, "augment it" to a bigger matrix [A | I], and do row operations to this. Doing a row operation to [X | Y] doesn't change the value of Y^-1 X. If you never have to switch rows around, doing the first bit of Gaussian elimination (without row swaps) amounts to doing row operations to [A | I] until you get it to the form [U | L]. Then you have A = L^-1 U, and

While adjoints and dual spaces are cer- tainly important topics, they are quite advanced and most applications that I know of require knowledge of Hilbert space theory. I am omitting the minimal polynomial because I do not emphasize

2016-09-16 20:11:51	l_coal	I was talking to my professor yesterday and he introduced the notion of homotopy. But his functions only ever had domain S^n
2016-09-16 20:11:54	dalcde	I have a counter example to your second claim. For any non-trivial subspace W, its intersection with itself is non-empty.

2016-09-17 00:03:45	meglomaniac	but SNN requires the professor to "flip a coin" over whether to tell A that B didn't get it versus C didn't get it

2016-09-17 00:05:40	Cale	stayKlassy: You absolutely ought to switch doors.
2016-09-17 00:05:56	int-e	meglomaniac: basically, yes, though there are holes in the analysis as yonatan points out
2016-09-17 00:06:04	Cale	stayKlassy: It's important to realise that Monty Hall won't be opening the door you picked, and he also won't be opening the door that has the prize
2016-09-17 00:06:08	stayKlassy	Cale, yeah I know that that's what statistics tell us, but to me we have a new situation and there are 2 doors now..
2016-09-17 00:06:16	meglomaniac	int-e I see, where are the holes?
2016-09-17 00:06:18	stayKlassy	hmm
2016-09-17 00:06:26	meglomaniac	int-e or where is it possible to poke holes here
2016-09-17 00:06:47	Cale	stayKlassy: So, by opening the door with a goat, he's provided you with new information about the situation which you can only take advantage of by switching doors.
2016-09-17 00:06:50	boarders	SwiftMatt: if you are familiar with any programming language it is easy to write some code that returns a Boolean for whether a number is prime e.g. easy algorithm is just to check if it is divisible by any integer up to the square root of the number
2016-09-17 00:07:04	SwiftMatt	yeah boarders
2016-09-17 00:07:09	int-e	meglomaniac: fundamentally the question is incomplete, it tells you about one singular possible outcome but you need to know about the hypothetical other outcomes and how they would be arrived at as well, otherwise probabilities are not meaningful.
2016-09-17 00:07:13	SwiftMatt	The reason I was testing was because I did write such a code
2016-09-17 00:07:18	SwiftMatt	and I just wanted to make sure it was working
2016-09-17 00:07:20	boarders	in maple you can do:

2016-09-17 00:12:14	hk238	if that's not good enough you can also think about it like this.. you choose a door (out of 100) and your probability of having chosen the correct is 1/100.. And the probability that the correct door is in other 99 doors, is 99/100
2016-09-17 00:12:15	stayKlassy	Cale, in theory im not, in reality i am

2016-09-17 00:15:11	Cale	Another way to look at it: after Monty opens the door, the probability that the prize is behind the door you originally chose has not changed: it's still 1/3 (or 1/100 in the case with more doors)
2016-09-17 00:15:24	Cale	But the probabilities have to add up to 1

2016-09-17 00:49:45	boarders	Ethoscience: here is a piecewise continuous function f(x) = x for x<0 and f(x) = sqrt(x^2) for x \geq 0
2016-09-17 00:50:00	Ethoscience	Yeah, that is a good example.
2016-09-17 00:50:07	dalcde	Well "piecewise" is not an intrinsic property of a function.
2016-09-17 00:50:16	Ethoscience	Do you mean that, in that example the constant of integration is unique, right?
2016-09-17 00:50:38	dalcde	Any continuous function on a connected domain has a unique antiderivative up to a single constant of integration.

2016-09-17 00:53:14	boarders	the value of the function you are trying to integrate will not help you
2016-09-17 00:53:33	Ethoscience	Okay, I give a particular example.
2016-09-17 00:53:46	dalcde	You are trying to find the antiderivative, right? The antiderivative, being differentiable, must be continuous. And then this continuity condition would determine the value of the function on the whole of domain.
2016-09-17 00:53:53	boarders	the point is if I apply d/dx to p(x) to get f(x) I can equally well apply it to p(x)+C for some constant C
2016-09-17 00:54:03	Ethoscience	dalcde good point
2016-09-17 00:54:18	Ethoscience	I forgot it must be continuous completely.

2016-09-17 01:45:57	pedro3005	a map between simply connected CW complexes which induces iso in homology is a homotopy equivalence
2016-09-17 01:46:00	pedro3005	that's the analogue
2016-09-17 01:46:28	dalcde	l_coal: Whitehead's theorem says weak homotopy equivalence classifies a CW complex up to homotopy equivalence. However, this does *not* imply that spaces with isomorphic homotopy groups are homotopy equivalent. The isomorphism have to be induced by a map of spaces.
2016-09-17 01:46:30	boarders	dalcde: I think you are right to say it is sort of orthogonal. You might know the homotopy groups, but they are put together in a postnikov tower by k-invariants which are cohomological

2016-09-17 02:42:44	hk238	in the case that you pick up a blue ball, the probability of drawing a blue ball from box 2, probabilities correspond to the ratio of the balls
2016-09-17 02:43:33	hk238	so you've have a chance of 5/11 are blue, or you have a chance of 4/11 are blue.. but to find out the total probability, then you need to know hjow often each of these scenarios occurs
2016-09-17 02:43:48	hk238	and that corresponds directly with the number of balls in the first box

2016-09-17 11:05:42	Z-module	That Wadim Zudilin guy (who posed the problem to his class is sort of famous: he proved that at least one of {ζ(5), ζ(7), ζ(9), ζ(11)} is irrational, as a follow-up to his ealrier paper showing that at least one of {ζ(5), ζ(7), ζ(9), ζ(11), ζ(13), ζ(15) ζ(17), ζ(19)} is irrational.

2016-09-17 13:35:15	Ozera	frogbasket, the last line in: http://math.stackexchange.com/a/1036780/365577 I was confused why they want to take the maximum |A|. If |A| is as big as possible, we get the largest total number of edges in a connected component (i.e, C(a,2) is maximized). HOWEVER, the very last line: 'when is this expression maximized', I don't understand. What are they maximizing?
2016-09-17 13:35:37	baxx	frogbasket: yeah, the triangle is the shape with the most acute angles -> the most pointy... And the circle is that with the least, therefore by adding sides the triangle will become less pointy and once it reaches a circle the problem is trivial (because all sides are tangent), therefore it should be solved with a triangle as the interior shape

2016-09-17 13:42:34	dude12312414	jennifer: I don't think there is a straightforward formula as a function of n, but basically you want maximum 'a' such that log(a!) < n * log(2). You can use some lower bounds on log(N!) to get an estimate. I don't know of easily invertible bounds for log(N!), but log(N!) = N*log(N) - N + (1/2)*log(N) + O(1), so N! needs roughly N * log_2(N) - N/log(2) + (1/2)*log_2(N) bits to represent

2016-09-17 15:39:29	PlanckWalk	The next step, after you find the maximum value for a!, woudl be asking how many bits it has.  Because that's what the question is asking!

2016-09-17 15:59:06	B3nszy	im not sure what to study
2016-09-17 15:59:08	jennifer	perhaps that factorials climb far faster than exponentials
2016-09-17 15:59:14	B3nszy	but I really like the approach of the book
2016-09-17 15:59:19	B3nszy	the topics discussed
2016-09-17 15:59:24	frogbasket	B3nszy: you should read "Godel's Proof" by Newman and Nagel
2016-09-17 15:59:24	B3nszy	and the problems it discusses
2016-09-17 15:59:37	blndidiot	PlanckWalk: Thanks.. I worked it out.  sqrt(3)/2*diameter
2016-09-17 15:59:41	antonfire	Then the thing you said about length is only valid when a2 >= a1, and in that case you might as well have just said a2-a1 rather than |a2-a1|.
2016-09-17 15:59:41	PlanckWalk	jennifer: Can you work out an upper bound on the number of bits for 64! ?

2016-09-17 15:59:48	B3nszy	yes but which subject does it fall under... math,cs, physics, cogsci, philosophy
2016-09-17 16:00:00	jennifer	that's huge
2016-09-17 16:00:01	jennifer	hm

2016-09-17 16:00:18	jennifer	PlanckWalk, 90 decimal digits
2016-09-17 16:00:20	B3nszy	which 1-2 encompass most of it
2016-09-17 16:00:22	antonfire	Anyway. now that you know what "interval" means and what "length" means, prove that the distance between two numbers that belong to an interval must be at most the length of the interval.

2016-09-17 19:22:05	Muyfret	frogbasket imagine generating random functions. and immediately deducing an algebraic expression consistent with the mappings. now imagine throwing away the ones that are equal or greater than the sequence we are trying to reduce to a function.  or as you just read from wiki, imagine skipping when you can't

2016-09-17 19:23:36	Muyfret	yeah it may be i need two different things. one to check if an algebraic expression exists for the function, and another to do the immediate deducing assuming an expression is provably available

2016-09-17 19:25:44	Muyfret	frogbasket, the idea is to decipher what's given. starting from algebraic expressions is doable. as fruity as it sounds think of it like trying to have the computer recognize all on its own.
2016-09-17 19:26:12	frogbasket	this is too cryptic for me
2016-09-17 19:26:15	Muyfret	you may not be given or it may not be given something that is expressible like we want
2016-09-17 19:27:03	Muyfret	not too confuse you. we don't want to cheat and start with an algebraic expression. we're assuming the function is possibly not reduceable to a neat algebraic expression

2016-09-17 21:38:53	B3nszy	Nope
2016-09-17 21:38:58	hk238	it makes sense to call the HS stuff algebra based on history of the term, and it makes sense to call the contents of .. algebra, abstract, due to them being abstract

2016-09-17 22:29:18	a____ptr	with the collatz conjecture, the "2-highways" really is the "1" highway
2016-09-17 22:29:27	int-e	one funny thing about the collatz function is that if you extend it to the integers, there are quite a few loops besides -2 -> -1 -> -2, for example -55,-164,-82,-41,-122,-61,-182,-91,-272,-136,-68,-34,-17,-50,-25,-74,-37,-110,-55,...

2016-09-17 22:29:34	a____ptr	any odd number has it's own "highway" doesn't it
2016-09-17 22:29:50	a____ptr	3*2^k will all trivially go down to 3

2016-09-17 22:52:18	int-e	sure: I believe a multi-pronged approach is better for teaching math. You need examples to draw from in order to motivate all the abstractions. Yes, you will revisit some topics because initially they cannot be treated with full rigor. But I don't believe that it is a waste of time per se, because even without rigor, you can build intuition that will be very useful later on.
2016-09-17 22:52:22	boarders	probably there are loads of these foundational type books and picking up any of them will do what you want

2016-09-17 22:53:14	Svitkona	i'm pretty sure we've had this exact same discussion with you more than once, B3nszy
2016-09-17 22:53:15	sure	but it works the other way around too: you teach the structure and the formalism first so people gets accustomed with it, and then find example or build example
2016-09-17 22:53:22	a____ptr	Svitkona: ++
2016-09-17 22:53:30	sure	giving vocabulary is nice too

2016-09-17 22:54:15	dalcde	I don't think we should start at formal logic. You can learn what it means to "prove" something without doing formal logic. And I think that's how it historically worked.
2016-09-17 22:54:18	B3nszy	I'm not familiar with the areas of math but I am interested in patterns
2016-09-17 22:54:22	sure	int-e: yeah, thats a real issue: it also makes student think maths is just by heart recipee, and doesn't motivate the smart student whgo doesnt know what real maths is to pursue this vocation

2016-09-17 23:15:34	boarders	I agree there are interesting examples e.g. I can take any group, I can take Vect(X) the monoid of vector bundles on a space (or similar with projective modules), I can take an idempotent monoid which is related to the theory of lattices etc
2016-09-17 23:15:50	boarders	but I think it is easier for groups to have representative examples for elementary purposes
2016-09-17 23:16:07	boarders	idk maybe you are right and I just haven't seen the textbook that makes this material reasonable at a basic level
2016-09-17 23:16:17	sure	because there isn't any

2016-09-17 23:16:49	boarders	monoids it is hard to have representative examples because the theory is too general in a way
2016-09-17 23:17:24	boarders	it is also worth noting that it is historically backwards I think
2016-09-17 23:17:31	sure	as every maths taught
2016-09-17 23:17:39	sure	its at first a big mess, then its ordered
2016-09-17 23:17:47	dalcde	I'd say the canonical example of a monoid is End(X) for X an object in a category, and the canonical example of a group is Aut(X) for X an object in a category.
2016-09-17 23:17:57	boarders	the concept of field precedes (maybe no formally) the concept of a group which precedes the concept of a monoid
2016-09-17 23:18:06	sure	yes, as every maths boarders

2016-09-17 23:45:36	hk238	by fundamental theorem of arithmetic, all numbers have a prime factorization.. which you can classify as follows: they contain a 2, all the factors are 1 mod 4, all the factors are 3 mod for, or they're mixed
2016-09-17 23:45:44	hk238	all natural nubmers I mean
2016-09-17 23:46:00	hk238	so if it has a 2 in it, then the number isn't 3 mod 4
2016-09-17 23:46:08	hk238	if the all primes are 1 mod 4, then the number is as well
2016-09-17 23:46:26	hk238	and wait I made mistake at this point :d nevermind I dont know how to do it

2016-09-17 23:47:38	hk238	so right yeah it works, if the number is 3 mod 4, then it has must have a prime factor that is 3 mod 4.. but it's not necessarily true that a prime factorization that has a 3 mod 4 prime in it, yields a number that's 3 mod 4.. so it goes just 1 way? is that correct?
2016-09-17 23:47:59	hk238	I dont know
2016-09-17 23:49:23	karl	hk238: that proves what he was asking for
2016-09-17 23:49:27	boarders	hk238: that is correct and you can even say that it must have an odd number of factors equal to 3 mod 4
2016-09-17 23:49:36	Plissken	hk238: darn it seemed so promising... google told me that since the number is 3 mod 4 all its prime factors had to be odd, can you explain to me why?

2016-09-17 23:49:41	hk238	yay ^^
2016-09-17 23:49:49	Plissken	i think the proof is about ruling out even prime factors mod 4, and then showing that there exists at least one prime factor that cant be 1 mod 4

2016-09-18 00:23:54	Vicky	boarders: So it's just an axiom to make sure the rules of operation hold together
2016-09-18 00:24:27	int-e	boarders: it can be an axiom. in (abstract) algebra it usually isn't: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_%28mathematics%29#Definition
2016-09-18 00:24:34	Vicky	But I still have to verify that nothing breaks if I introduce that axiom. How do I verify that?
2016-09-18 00:24:37	pwca	boarders is wrong.
2016-09-18 00:24:40	pwca	it's not an axiom.
2016-09-18 00:25:10	boarders	ok whatever, it is easy to show using exactly this distribuitivity argument
2016-09-18 00:25:21	pwca	which is why it's not an axiom.
2016-09-18 00:25:43	Vicky	So how do I prove -1*-1, when I only have multiplication defined in Z for all n \in Z, n >= 0?
2016-09-18 00:26:04	a____ptr	N_0
2016-09-18 00:26:05	a____ptr	?
2016-09-18 00:26:24	int-e	Vicky: in that case, -1 * -1 is undefined, and there is nothing you can say about it.
2016-09-18 00:26:31	pwca	-1 is the additive inverse of 1. so (1-1) = 0. 0 absorbs multiplication so -1*(1-1)=0 using distributivity you get (-1)*1 + (-1)*(-1) = 0 so you take +1 on both sides and get (-1)*(-1) = 1.
2016-09-18 00:26:36	pwca	there you go, Vicky.
2016-09-18 00:26:58	Vicky	I have addition defined for all n \in Z, but that doesn't seem to help me.

2016-09-18 01:07:49	sure	boarders: the difference lies in the fact that when you say that a category with one object with all arrows invertibles is a group, then you're using the "external" definition of group applied to category theory, while the "group object one" is an internal notion of group inside CT, used with the language of CT (ie objects, arrows, and composition)

2016-09-18 01:59:59	baxx	you know the interior angle of a circle is 2*pi
2016-09-18 02:00:03	baxx	so it's consistent

2016-09-18 02:03:22	hk238	tommycannady it seems to be just to get the fraction of the angle, so the central angle is 2pi in radians, the proportion to the area of the circle is angle/2pi.. so when the area has pi in it, they cancel out and it leaves just the two
2016-09-18 02:04:05	hk238	so it's actually like πr²(α/2π) for the sector and then it's simplified to (r²α)/2
2016-09-18 02:04:21	hk238	or something like that
2016-09-18 02:05:02	tommycannady	that explains it
2016-09-18 02:05:44	tommycannady	oh,is it a matter of degrees to radians ?
2016-09-18 02:06:04	tommycannady	we had to do some of that previously in a small calculation
2016-09-18 02:06:35	tommycannady	I'm only a simple robot : )

2016-09-18 02:08:06	hk238	:D
2016-09-18 02:08:12	hk238	or at least at the current moment
2016-09-18 02:08:12	tommycannady	if the world were in a simulation, somewhere in the multiverse and you figured it out there would be a 50% probability that your math would be blocked;)
2016-09-18 02:08:22	majesticc	I have asked this in another channel but I will give it a try here: If I shall solve this IVP problem by using Laplace transforms: y'' + y = u(t-3); y(0) =0, y'(0) = 1, then I could just take L^-1{y''} = s^2*Y(s) - s*0 - 1 = s^2*Y(s) - 1, then L^-1{y} = Y(s), so inserting that in the equation our LHS = Y(s)(s^2 + 1) - 1. Our RHS would then be L{u(t-3)} and we know that this should be L{u(t-3)}
2016-09-18 02:08:23	majesticc	= e^(-3s)*L{1 + 3} = e^(-3s)*4/s, alright so if we set LHS = RHS we find that Y(s) = (4e^(-3s) + s) / (s(s^2+1)), does it look alright so far?

2016-09-18 02:10:03	tommycannady	sure.. secret of mana is an snes game.. a legal clone of the game would have some math involved

2016-09-18 06:28:51	illustion	where we take partial sums here inside
2016-09-18 06:29:09	somiaj	illustion: then just use the triangle inequality to show that ||sum(x_i)|| - e <= ||x|| <= ||sum(x_i)|| + e and then you get that ||sum(x_i)|| also converges

2016-09-18 08:28:30	Millennial	if you see this on, say, a multiple choice exam, then the standard procedure for radical simplification is "rationalize the denominator and pull perfect squares out of the radical"
2016-09-18 08:28:35	frogbasket	just-now: take BsubsetA
2016-09-18 08:28:43	Millennial	but again, whether this form is actually simpler or not may depend
2016-09-18 08:28:48	Millennial	on circumstances
2016-09-18 08:28:51	frogbasket	just-now: are you asking if it is every possible?
2016-09-18 08:28:52	Indivicivet	oh yeah rationalizing the denominator also maybe quite good
2016-09-18 08:28:56	frogbasket	just-now: take A=emptyset

2016-09-18 08:29:45	just-now	frogbasket, i think it works even if A = emptyset?
2016-09-18 08:29:49	math116	OI have U = {1,2,3,4,5} and X=P(U) = set of all subsets of U. Let C = {1,3}. Define the relation rho on X by: A rho B iff A intersection C = B intersection C where A,B are sets contained in X. Show rho is an equivalence relation on X.

2016-09-18 09:13:48	frogbasket	[18:36:37] just-now: okay, if x is in A, then x is in every AUB_i, yes A is a subset of this intersection [18:36:37]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	just-now	[18:36:57] frogbasket, phew! [18:36:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	frogbasket	[18:37:15] just-now: but if A and B are disjoint, and say B_i=B for all i, then clearly A is a subset of the interseciton, and not equal [18:37:15]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	just-now	[18:38:05] frogbasket, for the moment, I'm only concerned with the x in A case [18:38:05]

2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[18:43:59] I am working on a question --> 3(c)(i): <Definition of the problem: http://i.imgur.com/sr3Niem.png > <My attempt: http://i.imgur.com/DY4Lh3d.png > can anyone check my work? [18:43:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	user123321	[18:49:58] 'morning mathematicians. [18:49:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[18:52:56] does anyone feel like helping me with probability questions? [18:52:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	mefistofeles	[18:54:20] probably [18:54:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[18:54:30] I am working on 3(c)(i) and 3(d): <Definition of the problem: http://i.imgur.com/sr3Niem.png > <3(c)(i) attempt: http://i.imgur.com/DY4Lh3d.png > [18:54:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[18:54:44] no idea how to start with 3d [18:54:44]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:01:36] Veruso, bernoulli in this case is just p(x) = a if x = 1; p(x) = 1-a if x = 0? [19:01:36]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:01:53] collin38: yes thats correct [19:01:53]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:02:22] okay so what happens when you plug in y=0 to q(y)? [19:02:22]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:02:49] according to my calculations, we get (1-a)^2 [19:02:49]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:04:00] c(p(0)p(1) + p(1)p(0)) = 2c(a(1-a)) [19:04:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:04:38] I thought you said y=0 ? [19:04:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:04:56] oh sorry [19:04:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:05:06] with I took as c p(0)p(0) [19:05:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:05:16] yeah that's right [19:05:16]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:05:24] so that's q(0) [19:05:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:05:34] so keep going and find the rest [19:05:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:05:46] I have done that for up to q(10) [19:05:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:05:56] oh sorry I didn't look at your attem [19:05:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:06:00] but its obvious that after q(3) its all zero [19:06:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:06:08] right [19:06:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:06:15] so you have the PMF then [19:06:15]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:06:29] what can I say about it? [19:06:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:06:43] I don't recognize it [19:06:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:06:50] it's the binomial distribution [19:06:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:07:04] q^2 + 2qp + p^2 [19:07:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:07:49] but q^2 is only for y = 0, 2qp for y=1 and p^2 for y=2 ? [19:07:49]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:08:04] what gives you the idea to add them together? [19:08:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:08:25] I mean you don't add them [19:08:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:08:59] I was just thinking maybe binomials looked more familiar when they were written like that [19:08:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:09:17] oh so its binomial with n=3, p = a ? [19:09:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:09:42] n=2 I believe [19:09:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:09:46] yes n = 2 [19:09:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:10:09] ok thanks - do you have any ideas for question 3(d) ? [19:10:09]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:10:40] that one isn't in the screenshot [19:10:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:11:20] oops - http://i.imgur.com/5HRnEi9.png [19:11:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:13:08] so you need an equation for the mean of Y [19:13:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:13:14] (and variance) [19:13:14]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:13:24] what's that look like [19:13:24]

2016-09-18 10:17:15	waterdrop	Basically I said that if U is a subspace of a finite dimensional vector space V, then we can just start with the empty list K = []. Then we go through all the vectors in U and for each one, if it isn't in the span of the vectors already in K, then we add it to K. The list we construct in this way is linearly independent and obviously spans U. It also must be a finite list, since it's a lin. independent list and is thus has
2016-09-18 10:17:15	waterdrop	 length smaller than or equal to every spanning list in V (and V is finite dimensional). So thus U is finite dimensional.

2016-09-18 11:55:46	Millennial	i suppose fermat's two square theorem is related, and there you can pull off a neat trick using the frobenius
2016-09-18 11:56:14	Millennial	i think you still need the fact that Z[i] is a PID, though, so perhaps this is hopeless
2016-09-18 11:56:18	Veruso	opraaa: you have sin(x)cos(x) = -1/2, so using the formula "2sin(u)cos(u)=sin(2u)", we have 2sin(x)cos(x) = -1 ==> sin(2x) = -1

I was thinking that 10 =~ 2^3 and using that... so A =~ (2^3)^{-3} and B = (2)^(-10) which has A = 2^{-9} and B = 2^{-10}, so B is smaller... but this feels *way* rough

2016-09-18 13:17:30	dalcde	So let me start. First consider the case where x = y = 0. Then x + y = 0 + 0 = 0, since 0 is the additive identity. To show that x * y = 0, we show that 0 * b = 0 in general. Indeed, we have 0 * b = (0 + 0) * b = 0 * b + 0 * b. Subtracting 0 * b from both sides, we have 0 * b = 0. So it follows that x + y = x * y = 0.

2016-09-18 14:07:32	Brainlet101	To work out the values of the coefficients, can I expand (z - (3 - i))(z - (3 + i)) and compare the coefficients?

2016-09-18 14:07:47	Indivicivet	dalcde: if a=0?
