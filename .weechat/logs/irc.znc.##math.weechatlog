2016-09-15 20:39:17	mantra	ezio: ok I see. i think they are trying to show that the euclidean norm is indeed a norm. but they are using properties of the dot or inner product to do that

2016-09-15 20:43:11	ezio	i get that
2016-09-15 20:43:22	ezio	that's probably the easiest thing since i hit length
2016-09-15 20:43:27	mantra	this is less circular than assuming that R^n is an inner product space in order to show that it's a normed space

2016-09-15 20:44:02	ezio	so normalizing will be helpful in finding colinear vectors?

2016-09-15 22:51:08	boarders	you sort of indicate what you would like with the above but it is weird, am I taking the 8% around 3 or around 3.5
2016-09-15 22:51:54	lieven	something like |a-b|/(|a+b|/2)<0.08 perhaps if you want to be symmetric in a and b

For example finding the solution to y'' + y = t^2 + 2 with y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = -1 the LHS would be LHS = Y(s)(s^2 + 1) - s + 1 and RHS = L{t^2} + L{2} = 2/s^3 + 2/s. Setting LHS = RHS and solving for Y(s) would give me Y(s) = [2/s^3 + 2/s + s - 1] / (s^2 +1), how on earth should

IIUC it goes like this: f is analytic <=> Taylor series <=> first-order local approximation, so expanding around z0, f'(z-z0) ~ f(z0) + zf'(z0) = some complex number + an amplitwist applied to z. But z -> z* is a reflection not an amplitwist.

2016-09-16 03:14:16	fxh	doesn't f_v evaluate a linear functional?
2016-09-16 03:14:21	Millennial	yes
2016-09-16 03:14:39	Millennial	wait, isn't that their attempt at defining f_v
2016-09-16 03:14:45	Millennial	is it supposed to be something else
2016-09-16 03:15:08	fxh	f_v is defined as taking a linear functional and evaluating it at a point
2016-09-16 03:15:12	Millennial	yes
2016-09-16 03:15:21	fxh	can I send a picture?
2016-09-16 03:15:26	Millennial	sure
2016-09-16 03:15:58	meglomaniac	Millennial could you really quickly help me verify something, I promise its a really simple problem
2016-09-16 03:16:12	Millennial	meglomaniac: if it's really simple then do it yourself :I

2016-09-16 04:31:50	baxx	Indivicivet: so if i set it up as 1/2 = e^{-a*24} then I can take logs and divide through by 24 giving ( ln[1] - ln[2] )/(24) = a ... but i'm not sure how to check this answer given the exponent of the first time t = 0 is just zero

When the girl rotates around her self with the arms closed she gains rotational speed, when she opens her arms, she loses speed. You can do the experiment with a desk chair. The reason for this is due to the conservation of L. You gain distance from
2016-09-16 06:23:19	mokuso	rotational axis, you lose speed. You lose distance, you gain speed. Same happens with spining tops and rotating stars.

2016-09-16 06:27:58	hk238	hmm is it correct that you can think about it as holding a barbell in each hand, and rotating, is like the barbells have momentum that's orthogonal with respect to your position, and the tension of your arms or similar thing, pulls the barbells inward, which then curves their motion, so they're kind of like orbiting
2016-09-16 06:28:28	hk238	so when you pull your hands and the barbells closer, it's sort of like the speed of the barbells remains the same, so you end up spinning faster

2016-09-16 11:07:15	Millennial	boarders: it's like asking "compute the minimal polynomial of 2 + 2^(1/5) + 3*2^(2/5) over Q" in a galois theory exam imo
2016-09-16 11:07:17	Millennial	it's just plain stupid
2016-09-16 11:07:45	sure	its always nice to know students can do things explicitely tho
2016-09-16 11:07:47	sure	its important
2016-09-16 11:07:51	sure	but you have to choose good examples
2016-09-16 11:08:02	boarders	Millennial: I agree, especially as computers are good at doing it. If anything learning the algorithm means we should say: "cool now let's leave that to the computer"
2016-09-16 11:08:17	Millennial	well, understanding the algorithm is important
2016-09-16 11:08:18	sure	its completely useless to know bunch of theory if you don't know how to relate it to concrete computations and concrete example
2016-09-16 11:08:22	boarders	and it behooves us to come up with very symmetrical or interesting examples in exam questions
2016-09-16 11:08:24	Millennial	so i would probably say
2016-09-16 11:08:42	Millennial	"describe an algorithm to find the minimal polynomial of some element in a number field"
2016-09-16 11:08:47	boarders	like instead of computing a random determinant you should compute the determinant of the vandermonde matrix or similarly symmetrical examples
2016-09-16 11:08:52	Millennial	ya, sure
2016-09-16 11:09:06	sure	even the determinant of the vandermonde isn't easy to find
2016-09-16 11:09:08	sure	if you don't know the result
2016-09-16 11:09:16	sure	but its a nice result to know

2016-09-16 11:09:51	Millennial	boarders: you can find it without doing anything, tbh
2016-09-16 11:10:03	sure	yeah, just by noticing its a poylnomial and balblabla

2016-09-16 11:10:20	sure	this also works for cauchy-like determinant Millennial
2016-09-16 11:10:28	Millennial	sure: or for the sylvester determinant
2016-09-16 11:10:33	Millennial	in fact, i don't know another proof of that one
2016-09-16 11:10:36	sure	those are nice methofs to know too
2016-09-16 11:10:48	--	Maxdaman1us is now known as Maxdamantus
2016-09-16 11:10:51	boarders	though that is a cheat for an elementary course as you are using that you can take the determinant of a matrix with elements in a polynomial ring
2016-09-16 11:10:58	boarders	which is obvious but maybe not known to the students
2016-09-16 11:11:14	boarders	then again they do it all the time with characteristic polynomial and the world keeps spinning so whatever
2016-09-16 11:11:17	Millennial	lol
2016-09-16 11:11:42	sure	in any case

2016-09-16 11:36:09	harrynoob	is that an axiom of yours?

2016-09-16 11:49:26	tom99	and it doesn't impact the axiom system
2016-09-16 11:49:32	drdo	Most mathematics deals with unproblematic ideas that will be true in every theory that people would consider reasonable

2016-09-16 11:49:38	Millennial	you don't even need to formalize calculus to apply it to real life

2016-09-16 11:49:54	Millennial	that's not the problem here
2016-09-16 11:50:05	sure	f(e_i) is a vector of W, so it can be decomposed inside the basis {f_j}, say, f(e_i) = sum_j={1^n} F_ji f_j where F_ji are the j-th component of f(e_i)
2016-09-16 11:50:09	Millennial	the problem is that mathematicians are the ones playing this game
2016-09-16 11:50:10	boarders	well I don't think of mathematics as subservient to how engineers use it so I don't see why the axiomatic system needs justifying in those terms

2016-09-16 12:20:50	Millennial	a^(p-1) = 1 always

2016-09-16 12:21:36	bollu	no?
2016-09-16 12:21:38	Millennial	how do you show that it's always -1 for a nonsquare?
2016-09-16 12:21:48	Millennial	how do you show that it's -1 for anything at all :o
2016-09-16 12:21:52	Millennial	maybe it's just 1 for every number
2016-09-16 12:22:01	bollu	Millennial: because it's obviously a homomorphism now
2016-09-16 12:22:06	Millennial	that doesn't matter
2016-09-16 12:22:09	Millennial	it could be the trivial homomorphism
2016-09-16 12:22:10	Karlo_	Even if it's 1 for every number, it's still a homomorphism (just not onto).
2016-09-16 12:22:10	bollu	Millennial: so now we have some kernel
2016-09-16 12:22:12	boarders	Millennial: I was taking CH as the statement that a set either is countable or has same size as R
2016-09-16 12:22:13	bollu	Millennial: okay, fair
2016-09-16 12:22:21	boarders	and it is not obvious for closed sets for my definition of obvious
2016-09-16 12:22:26	Guest44317	I just created a markov chain of this channel. It is really bad.
2016-09-16 12:22:30	boarders	i.e. it follows from the Cantor-Bendixson theorem
2016-09-16 12:22:45	bollu	Millennial: hm, okay. I could show the existence of an element such that a^(p - 1)/2 = -1
2016-09-16 12:22:47	Karlo_	Oh, I guess the goal was to show that "half map to -1"
2016-09-16 12:22:48	SuperEgg	You can expand the archemedean property to integers, correct? For all a,b >0 There exists N in natural such that aN>=b.
2016-09-16 12:22:55	bollu	Millennial: then the "rest of the elements" would be forced to exist

2016-09-16 12:57:12	Karlo_	soLucien: But in my |A|=5 example, there are ten possible collisions, and you're not accounting for that at all.
2016-09-16 12:57:36	soLucien	if i have the hash function h(x) = x % 3 i would have one collision in the set {1,2,3,4}, namely 1-4

2016-09-16 13:15:13	Millennial	the quotient has order 2
2016-09-16 13:15:26	Millennial	and there's only one group of order 2
2016-09-16 13:15:31	Millennial	so the quotient must be that group

2016-09-16 13:45:34	antonfire	and keeping track of what multiples of x-1 you're subtracting off, of course.
2016-09-16 13:45:44	Simply	yeah

2016-09-16 13:50:45	antonfire	Plug in x = 1 into the polynomial at each intermediate step to figure out where.

2016-09-16 15:50:26	dalcde	This is actually the same as your original question - "you can't prove the axiom of choice if you don't accept the axiom of choice".
2016-09-16 15:50:31	StarshineSpark	anoteros: I'll do it too and then we compare the result :)
2016-09-16 15:50:40	dalcde	antonfire: Or rather easy examples in group theory.
2016-09-16 15:50:41	antonfire	e.g. Euclid's fifth axiom doesn't follow from the others, because there are models in which the others hold but Euclid's fifth does not.
2016-09-16 15:50:55	StarshineSpark	anoteros: results*
2016-09-16 15:51:01	antonfire	namely, projective geometry and hyperbolic geometry.
2016-09-16 15:51:12	a____ptr	so its more of  using some system WITHOUT the axiom of choice and see what follows?
2016-09-16 15:51:23	a____ptr	/consequences
2016-09-16 15:51:33	antonfire	"using" and "constructing a model" are different things.
2016-09-16 15:51:49	a____ptr	fair enough
2016-09-16 15:52:20	antonfire	Just using the first four of Euclid's axioms isn't the same thing as coming up with a system in which those four hold but the fifth one doesn't.

2016-09-16 15:54:34	a____ptr	oh
2016-09-16 15:55:43	antonfire	The point of actually giving an example of a system like that (e.g. hyperbolic geometry) is to convince yourself that you won't run into a contradiction if you assume the first four postulates and the negation of the fifth one.
2016-09-16 15:56:34	antonfire	If you just play around with the first four and the negation of the fifth one for a long time, you are basically just hoping that you don't run into a contradiction.

2016-09-16 16:32:29	antonfire	e.g. 3x-2 = 0 when x = 2/3, so any polynomial times (3x-2) should also evaluate to 0 at 2/3.
2016-09-16 16:32:32	Matt|home	yeah i found it weird too. there's workarounds, but this is the best option for my ass not dropping out right now

2016-09-16 16:32:55	esph	dude12312414: That was phrased incorrectly, sorry. What I want to determine is if there are a and b such that n = 3b + 5a, for some n, everything being integers.
2016-09-16 16:33:22	antonfire	Another thing you should know how to do when multiplying polynomials is to work out an individual coefficient of the product without working out all the rest, which lets you either compute or check them one by one.

2016-09-16 16:35:09	antonfire	e.g. the only way you can get a term with x^2 in it from the product (2x^3 - 3x^2 + x + 5)(3x - 2) is from multiplying x on the left with 3x on the right or from multiplying -3x^2 on the left with -2 on the right.
2016-09-16 16:35:13	dude12312414	since gcd(3, 5) = 1, it's easy to see which n can be expressed in that form

2016-09-16 16:37:22	antonfire	You can also be more systematic about how you write the terms down. When evaluating (2x^3 - 3x^2 + x + 5)(3x - 2), you could multiply out (2x^3 - 3x^2 + x + 5)(3x) on one row and multiply out (2x^3 - 3x^2 + x + 5)(-2) on the next row, but line them up so the x^3 terms are in the same column, the x^2 terms are in the same column, and so on,

2016-09-16 17:24:50	Muyfret	i repeat all the original objects get an appropriate amount of clones of themselves based on their fitness. but if you randomly select from the list of objects and create copies until they are all processed, it causes the simulation to go on forever
