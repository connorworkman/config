2016-09-15 20:39:17	mantra	ezio: ok I see. i think they are trying to show that the euclidean norm is indeed a norm. but they are using properties of the dot or inner product to do that

2016-09-15 20:43:11	ezio	i get that
2016-09-15 20:43:22	ezio	that's probably the easiest thing since i hit length
2016-09-15 20:43:27	mantra	this is less circular than assuming that R^n is an inner product space in order to show that it's a normed space

2016-09-15 20:44:02	ezio	so normalizing will be helpful in finding colinear vectors?

2016-09-15 22:51:08	boarders	you sort of indicate what you would like with the above but it is weird, am I taking the 8% around 3 or around 3.5
2016-09-15 22:51:54	lieven	something like |a-b|/(|a+b|/2)<0.08 perhaps if you want to be symmetric in a and b

For example finding the solution to y'' + y = t^2 + 2 with y(0) = 1 and y'(0) = -1 the LHS would be LHS = Y(s)(s^2 + 1) - s + 1 and RHS = L{t^2} + L{2} = 2/s^3 + 2/s. Setting LHS = RHS and solving for Y(s) would give me Y(s) = [2/s^3 + 2/s + s - 1] / (s^2 +1), how on earth should

IIUC it goes like this: f is analytic <=> Taylor series <=> first-order local approximation, so expanding around z0, f'(z-z0) ~ f(z0) + zf'(z0) = some complex number + an amplitwist applied to z. But z -> z* is a reflection not an amplitwist.

2016-09-16 03:14:16	fxh	doesn't f_v evaluate a linear functional?
2016-09-16 03:14:21	Millennial	yes
2016-09-16 03:14:39	Millennial	wait, isn't that their attempt at defining f_v
2016-09-16 03:14:45	Millennial	is it supposed to be something else
2016-09-16 03:15:08	fxh	f_v is defined as taking a linear functional and evaluating it at a point
2016-09-16 03:15:12	Millennial	yes
2016-09-16 03:15:21	fxh	can I send a picture?
2016-09-16 03:15:26	Millennial	sure
2016-09-16 03:15:58	meglomaniac	Millennial could you really quickly help me verify something, I promise its a really simple problem
2016-09-16 03:16:12	Millennial	meglomaniac: if it's really simple then do it yourself :I

2016-09-16 04:31:50	baxx	Indivicivet: so if i set it up as 1/2 = e^{-a*24} then I can take logs and divide through by 24 giving ( ln[1] - ln[2] )/(24) = a ... but i'm not sure how to check this answer given the exponent of the first time t = 0 is just zero

When the girl rotates around her self with the arms closed she gains rotational speed, when she opens her arms, she loses speed. You can do the experiment with a desk chair. The reason for this is due to the conservation of L. You gain distance from
2016-09-16 06:23:19	mokuso	rotational axis, you lose speed. You lose distance, you gain speed. Same happens with spining tops and rotating stars.

2016-09-16 06:27:58	hk238	hmm is it correct that you can think about it as holding a barbell in each hand, and rotating, is like the barbells have momentum that's orthogonal with respect to your position, and the tension of your arms or similar thing, pulls the barbells inward, which then curves their motion, so they're kind of like orbiting
2016-09-16 06:28:28	hk238	so when you pull your hands and the barbells closer, it's sort of like the speed of the barbells remains the same, so you end up spinning faster

2016-09-16 11:07:15	Millennial	boarders: it's like asking "compute the minimal polynomial of 2 + 2^(1/5) + 3*2^(2/5) over Q" in a galois theory exam imo
2016-09-16 11:07:17	Millennial	it's just plain stupid
2016-09-16 11:07:45	sure	its always nice to know students can do things explicitely tho
2016-09-16 11:07:47	sure	its important
2016-09-16 11:07:51	sure	but you have to choose good examples
2016-09-16 11:08:02	boarders	Millennial: I agree, especially as computers are good at doing it. If anything learning the algorithm means we should say: "cool now let's leave that to the computer"
2016-09-16 11:08:17	Millennial	well, understanding the algorithm is important
2016-09-16 11:08:18	sure	its completely useless to know bunch of theory if you don't know how to relate it to concrete computations and concrete example
2016-09-16 11:08:22	boarders	and it behooves us to come up with very symmetrical or interesting examples in exam questions
2016-09-16 11:08:24	Millennial	so i would probably say
2016-09-16 11:08:42	Millennial	"describe an algorithm to find the minimal polynomial of some element in a number field"
2016-09-16 11:08:47	boarders	like instead of computing a random determinant you should compute the determinant of the vandermonde matrix or similarly symmetrical examples
2016-09-16 11:08:52	Millennial	ya, sure
2016-09-16 11:09:06	sure	even the determinant of the vandermonde isn't easy to find
2016-09-16 11:09:08	sure	if you don't know the result
2016-09-16 11:09:16	sure	but its a nice result to know

2016-09-16 11:09:51	Millennial	boarders: you can find it without doing anything, tbh
2016-09-16 11:10:03	sure	yeah, just by noticing its a poylnomial and balblabla

2016-09-16 11:10:20	sure	this also works for cauchy-like determinant Millennial
2016-09-16 11:10:28	Millennial	sure: or for the sylvester determinant
2016-09-16 11:10:33	Millennial	in fact, i don't know another proof of that one
2016-09-16 11:10:36	sure	those are nice methofs to know too
2016-09-16 11:10:48	--	Maxdaman1us is now known as Maxdamantus
2016-09-16 11:10:51	boarders	though that is a cheat for an elementary course as you are using that you can take the determinant of a matrix with elements in a polynomial ring
2016-09-16 11:10:58	boarders	which is obvious but maybe not known to the students
2016-09-16 11:11:14	boarders	then again they do it all the time with characteristic polynomial and the world keeps spinning so whatever
2016-09-16 11:11:17	Millennial	lol
2016-09-16 11:11:42	sure	in any case

2016-09-16 11:36:09	harrynoob	is that an axiom of yours?

2016-09-16 11:49:26	tom99	and it doesn't impact the axiom system
2016-09-16 11:49:32	drdo	Most mathematics deals with unproblematic ideas that will be true in every theory that people would consider reasonable

2016-09-16 11:49:38	Millennial	you don't even need to formalize calculus to apply it to real life

2016-09-16 11:49:54	Millennial	that's not the problem here
2016-09-16 11:50:05	sure	f(e_i) is a vector of W, so it can be decomposed inside the basis {f_j}, say, f(e_i) = sum_j={1^n} F_ji f_j where F_ji are the j-th component of f(e_i)
2016-09-16 11:50:09	Millennial	the problem is that mathematicians are the ones playing this game
2016-09-16 11:50:10	boarders	well I don't think of mathematics as subservient to how engineers use it so I don't see why the axiomatic system needs justifying in those terms

2016-09-16 12:20:50	Millennial	a^(p-1) = 1 always

2016-09-16 12:21:36	bollu	no?
2016-09-16 12:21:38	Millennial	how do you show that it's always -1 for a nonsquare?
2016-09-16 12:21:48	Millennial	how do you show that it's -1 for anything at all :o
2016-09-16 12:21:52	Millennial	maybe it's just 1 for every number
2016-09-16 12:22:01	bollu	Millennial: because it's obviously a homomorphism now
2016-09-16 12:22:06	Millennial	that doesn't matter
2016-09-16 12:22:09	Millennial	it could be the trivial homomorphism
2016-09-16 12:22:10	Karlo_	Even if it's 1 for every number, it's still a homomorphism (just not onto).
2016-09-16 12:22:10	bollu	Millennial: so now we have some kernel
2016-09-16 12:22:12	boarders	Millennial: I was taking CH as the statement that a set either is countable or has same size as R
2016-09-16 12:22:13	bollu	Millennial: okay, fair
2016-09-16 12:22:21	boarders	and it is not obvious for closed sets for my definition of obvious
2016-09-16 12:22:26	Guest44317	I just created a markov chain of this channel. It is really bad.
2016-09-16 12:22:30	boarders	i.e. it follows from the Cantor-Bendixson theorem
2016-09-16 12:22:45	bollu	Millennial: hm, okay. I could show the existence of an element such that a^(p - 1)/2 = -1
2016-09-16 12:22:47	Karlo_	Oh, I guess the goal was to show that "half map to -1"
2016-09-16 12:22:48	SuperEgg	You can expand the archemedean property to integers, correct? For all a,b >0 There exists N in natural such that aN>=b.
2016-09-16 12:22:55	bollu	Millennial: then the "rest of the elements" would be forced to exist

2016-09-16 12:57:12	Karlo_	soLucien: But in my |A|=5 example, there are ten possible collisions, and you're not accounting for that at all.
2016-09-16 12:57:36	soLucien	if i have the hash function h(x) = x % 3 i would have one collision in the set {1,2,3,4}, namely 1-4

2016-09-16 13:15:13	Millennial	the quotient has order 2
2016-09-16 13:15:26	Millennial	and there's only one group of order 2
2016-09-16 13:15:31	Millennial	so the quotient must be that group

2016-09-16 13:45:34	antonfire	and keeping track of what multiples of x-1 you're subtracting off, of course.
2016-09-16 13:45:44	Simply	yeah

2016-09-16 13:50:45	antonfire	Plug in x = 1 into the polynomial at each intermediate step to figure out where.

2016-09-16 15:50:26	dalcde	This is actually the same as your original question - "you can't prove the axiom of choice if you don't accept the axiom of choice".
2016-09-16 15:50:31	StarshineSpark	anoteros: I'll do it too and then we compare the result :)
2016-09-16 15:50:40	dalcde	antonfire: Or rather easy examples in group theory.
2016-09-16 15:50:41	antonfire	e.g. Euclid's fifth axiom doesn't follow from the others, because there are models in which the others hold but Euclid's fifth does not.
2016-09-16 15:50:55	StarshineSpark	anoteros: results*
2016-09-16 15:51:01	antonfire	namely, projective geometry and hyperbolic geometry.
2016-09-16 15:51:12	a____ptr	so its more of  using some system WITHOUT the axiom of choice and see what follows?
2016-09-16 15:51:23	a____ptr	/consequences
2016-09-16 15:51:33	antonfire	"using" and "constructing a model" are different things.
2016-09-16 15:51:49	a____ptr	fair enough
2016-09-16 15:52:20	antonfire	Just using the first four of Euclid's axioms isn't the same thing as coming up with a system in which those four hold but the fifth one doesn't.

2016-09-16 15:54:34	a____ptr	oh
2016-09-16 15:55:43	antonfire	The point of actually giving an example of a system like that (e.g. hyperbolic geometry) is to convince yourself that you won't run into a contradiction if you assume the first four postulates and the negation of the fifth one.
2016-09-16 15:56:34	antonfire	If you just play around with the first four and the negation of the fifth one for a long time, you are basically just hoping that you don't run into a contradiction.

2016-09-16 16:32:29	antonfire	e.g. 3x-2 = 0 when x = 2/3, so any polynomial times (3x-2) should also evaluate to 0 at 2/3.
2016-09-16 16:32:32	Matt|home	yeah i found it weird too. there's workarounds, but this is the best option for my ass not dropping out right now

2016-09-16 16:32:55	esph	dude12312414: That was phrased incorrectly, sorry. What I want to determine is if there are a and b such that n = 3b + 5a, for some n, everything being integers.
2016-09-16 16:33:22	antonfire	Another thing you should know how to do when multiplying polynomials is to work out an individual coefficient of the product without working out all the rest, which lets you either compute or check them one by one.

2016-09-16 16:35:09	antonfire	e.g. the only way you can get a term with x^2 in it from the product (2x^3 - 3x^2 + x + 5)(3x - 2) is from multiplying x on the left with 3x on the right or from multiplying -3x^2 on the left with -2 on the right.
2016-09-16 16:35:13	dude12312414	since gcd(3, 5) = 1, it's easy to see which n can be expressed in that form

2016-09-16 16:37:22	antonfire	You can also be more systematic about how you write the terms down. When evaluating (2x^3 - 3x^2 + x + 5)(3x - 2), you could multiply out (2x^3 - 3x^2 + x + 5)(3x) on one row and multiply out (2x^3 - 3x^2 + x + 5)(-2) on the next row, but line them up so the x^3 terms are in the same column, the x^2 terms are in the same column, and so on,

2016-09-16 19:11:29	ottanta	like, given x+T, x has to be in the domain, so given a period 1, 0+1 is in the naturals, so for the naturals to be periodic by that definition, 0 would have to be in the naturals, which it either is or it isn't
2016-09-16 19:11:51	ottanta	if it is, then -1+1 = 0, -1+1 has to be in the naturals would imply, by that definition, that -1 is in the naturals, which regardless it isn't

2016-09-16 19:27:43	antonfire	They ought to tell you what kind of object A is before they ask you anything about it.
2016-09-16 19:28:02	dalcde	The kernel of A and A^T are subspaces of different spaces in general.
2016-09-16 19:28:08	mxms	Well, the assignment is on subspaces. So it's somewhat implied to be some sort of matrices
2016-09-16 19:28:23	dalcde	But to be less boring, you can consider the case where A is a square matrix, ie. an endomorphism.
2016-09-16 19:28:51	antonfire	If you want to be careful, prove the harder thing: it's not the case that for all square matrices A, N(A) = N(A^T).
2016-09-16 19:29:00	mxms	Yes, I should do that next
2016-09-16 19:29:39	mxms	Also, I don't really understand the "domain" and "range" of a matrix

2016-09-16 19:30:05	mxms	the domain is the row-space, and the range is the column space. But why is this?
2016-09-16 19:30:08	antonfire	Strictly speaking, you talk about the domain and range of a linear map associated to a matrix, not the domain and range of the matrix itself.
2016-09-16 19:30:16	mxms	I guess it makes sense if I express it as an outer product
2016-09-16 19:30:25	antonfire	So the answer is "that's the convention for associating a linear map to a matrix"
2016-09-16 19:30:27	mxms	Ok, that makes sense
2016-09-16 19:30:48	antonfire	Also, the domain isn't actually the row-space

2016-09-16 19:32:15	mxms	ok good so far
2016-09-16 19:32:22	tom99	here R^n is the cartesian product of R with itself n times which we know exists.
2016-09-16 19:32:23	antonfire	So the domain of the linear map associated to an m x n matrix is R^n, irrespective of what the rows of that matrix happen to span.

2016-09-16 19:32:58	antonfire	e.g. if M is the m x n matrix of all 0's, then the associated linear map L is still a map from R^n to R^m. Its domain is R^n, and its codomain is R^m.

2016-09-16 19:40:04	antonfire	(Strictly speaking if you're using a matrix to represent a map V -> W then the row space "lives in" V*.)

2016-09-16 19:46:19	antonfire	The usual process is you start with a matrix A, "augment it" to a bigger matrix [A | I], and do row operations to this. Doing a row operation to [X | Y] doesn't change the value of Y^-1 X. If you never have to switch rows around, doing the first bit of Gaussian elimination (without row swaps) amounts to doing row operations to [A | I] until you get it to the form [U | L]. Then you have A = L^-1 U, and

While adjoints and dual spaces are cer- tainly important topics, they are quite advanced and most applications that I know of require knowledge of Hilbert space theory. I am omitting the minimal polynomial because I do not emphasize

2016-09-16 20:11:51	l_coal	I was talking to my professor yesterday and he introduced the notion of homotopy. But his functions only ever had domain S^n
2016-09-16 20:11:54	dalcde	I have a counter example to your second claim. For any non-trivial subspace W, its intersection with itself is non-empty.

2016-09-17 00:03:45	meglomaniac	but SNN requires the professor to "flip a coin" over whether to tell A that B didn't get it versus C didn't get it

2016-09-17 00:05:40	Cale	stayKlassy: You absolutely ought to switch doors.
2016-09-17 00:05:56	int-e	meglomaniac: basically, yes, though there are holes in the analysis as yonatan points out
2016-09-17 00:06:04	Cale	stayKlassy: It's important to realise that Monty Hall won't be opening the door you picked, and he also won't be opening the door that has the prize
2016-09-17 00:06:08	stayKlassy	Cale, yeah I know that that's what statistics tell us, but to me we have a new situation and there are 2 doors now..
2016-09-17 00:06:16	meglomaniac	int-e I see, where are the holes?
2016-09-17 00:06:18	stayKlassy	hmm
2016-09-17 00:06:26	meglomaniac	int-e or where is it possible to poke holes here
2016-09-17 00:06:47	Cale	stayKlassy: So, by opening the door with a goat, he's provided you with new information about the situation which you can only take advantage of by switching doors.
2016-09-17 00:06:50	boarders	SwiftMatt: if you are familiar with any programming language it is easy to write some code that returns a Boolean for whether a number is prime e.g. easy algorithm is just to check if it is divisible by any integer up to the square root of the number
2016-09-17 00:07:04	SwiftMatt	yeah boarders
2016-09-17 00:07:09	int-e	meglomaniac: fundamentally the question is incomplete, it tells you about one singular possible outcome but you need to know about the hypothetical other outcomes and how they would be arrived at as well, otherwise probabilities are not meaningful.
2016-09-17 00:07:13	SwiftMatt	The reason I was testing was because I did write such a code
2016-09-17 00:07:18	SwiftMatt	and I just wanted to make sure it was working
2016-09-17 00:07:20	boarders	in maple you can do:

2016-09-17 00:12:14	hk238	if that's not good enough you can also think about it like this.. you choose a door (out of 100) and your probability of having chosen the correct is 1/100.. And the probability that the correct door is in other 99 doors, is 99/100
2016-09-17 00:12:15	stayKlassy	Cale, in theory im not, in reality i am

2016-09-17 00:15:11	Cale	Another way to look at it: after Monty opens the door, the probability that the prize is behind the door you originally chose has not changed: it's still 1/3 (or 1/100 in the case with more doors)
2016-09-17 00:15:24	Cale	But the probabilities have to add up to 1

2016-09-17 00:49:45	boarders	Ethoscience: here is a piecewise continuous function f(x) = x for x<0 and f(x) = sqrt(x^2) for x \geq 0
2016-09-17 00:50:00	Ethoscience	Yeah, that is a good example.
2016-09-17 00:50:07	dalcde	Well "piecewise" is not an intrinsic property of a function.
2016-09-17 00:50:16	Ethoscience	Do you mean that, in that example the constant of integration is unique, right?
2016-09-17 00:50:38	dalcde	Any continuous function on a connected domain has a unique antiderivative up to a single constant of integration.

2016-09-17 00:53:14	boarders	the value of the function you are trying to integrate will not help you
2016-09-17 00:53:33	Ethoscience	Okay, I give a particular example.
2016-09-17 00:53:46	dalcde	You are trying to find the antiderivative, right? The antiderivative, being differentiable, must be continuous. And then this continuity condition would determine the value of the function on the whole of domain.
2016-09-17 00:53:53	boarders	the point is if I apply d/dx to p(x) to get f(x) I can equally well apply it to p(x)+C for some constant C
2016-09-17 00:54:03	Ethoscience	dalcde good point
2016-09-17 00:54:18	Ethoscience	I forgot it must be continuous completely.

2016-09-17 01:45:57	pedro3005	a map between simply connected CW complexes which induces iso in homology is a homotopy equivalence
2016-09-17 01:46:00	pedro3005	that's the analogue
2016-09-17 01:46:28	dalcde	l_coal: Whitehead's theorem says weak homotopy equivalence classifies a CW complex up to homotopy equivalence. However, this does *not* imply that spaces with isomorphic homotopy groups are homotopy equivalent. The isomorphism have to be induced by a map of spaces.
2016-09-17 01:46:30	boarders	dalcde: I think you are right to say it is sort of orthogonal. You might know the homotopy groups, but they are put together in a postnikov tower by k-invariants which are cohomological

2016-09-17 02:42:44	hk238	in the case that you pick up a blue ball, the probability of drawing a blue ball from box 2, probabilities correspond to the ratio of the balls
2016-09-17 02:43:33	hk238	so you've have a chance of 5/11 are blue, or you have a chance of 4/11 are blue.. but to find out the total probability, then you need to know hjow often each of these scenarios occurs
2016-09-17 02:43:48	hk238	and that corresponds directly with the number of balls in the first box

2016-09-17 11:05:42	Z-module	That Wadim Zudilin guy (who posed the problem to his class is sort of famous: he proved that at least one of {ζ(5), ζ(7), ζ(9), ζ(11)} is irrational, as a follow-up to his ealrier paper showing that at least one of {ζ(5), ζ(7), ζ(9), ζ(11), ζ(13), ζ(15) ζ(17), ζ(19)} is irrational.

2016-09-17 13:35:15	Ozera	frogbasket, the last line in: http://math.stackexchange.com/a/1036780/365577 I was confused why they want to take the maximum |A|. If |A| is as big as possible, we get the largest total number of edges in a connected component (i.e, C(a,2) is maximized). HOWEVER, the very last line: 'when is this expression maximized', I don't understand. What are they maximizing?
2016-09-17 13:35:37	baxx	frogbasket: yeah, the triangle is the shape with the most acute angles -> the most pointy... And the circle is that with the least, therefore by adding sides the triangle will become less pointy and once it reaches a circle the problem is trivial (because all sides are tangent), therefore it should be solved with a triangle as the interior shape

2016-09-17 13:42:34	dude12312414	jennifer: I don't think there is a straightforward formula as a function of n, but basically you want maximum 'a' such that log(a!) < n * log(2). You can use some lower bounds on log(N!) to get an estimate. I don't know of easily invertible bounds for log(N!), but log(N!) = N*log(N) - N + (1/2)*log(N) + O(1), so N! needs roughly N * log_2(N) - N/log(2) + (1/2)*log_2(N) bits to represent

2016-09-17 15:39:29	PlanckWalk	The next step, after you find the maximum value for a!, woudl be asking how many bits it has.  Because that's what the question is asking!

2016-09-17 15:59:06	B3nszy	im not sure what to study
2016-09-17 15:59:08	jennifer	perhaps that factorials climb far faster than exponentials
2016-09-17 15:59:14	B3nszy	but I really like the approach of the book
2016-09-17 15:59:19	B3nszy	the topics discussed
2016-09-17 15:59:24	frogbasket	B3nszy: you should read "Godel's Proof" by Newman and Nagel
2016-09-17 15:59:24	B3nszy	and the problems it discusses
2016-09-17 15:59:37	blndidiot	PlanckWalk: Thanks.. I worked it out.  sqrt(3)/2*diameter
2016-09-17 15:59:41	antonfire	Then the thing you said about length is only valid when a2 >= a1, and in that case you might as well have just said a2-a1 rather than |a2-a1|.
2016-09-17 15:59:41	PlanckWalk	jennifer: Can you work out an upper bound on the number of bits for 64! ?

2016-09-17 15:59:48	B3nszy	yes but which subject does it fall under... math,cs, physics, cogsci, philosophy
2016-09-17 16:00:00	jennifer	that's huge
2016-09-17 16:00:01	jennifer	hm

2016-09-17 16:00:18	jennifer	PlanckWalk, 90 decimal digits
2016-09-17 16:00:20	B3nszy	which 1-2 encompass most of it
2016-09-17 16:00:22	antonfire	Anyway. now that you know what "interval" means and what "length" means, prove that the distance between two numbers that belong to an interval must be at most the length of the interval.

2016-09-17 19:22:05	Muyfret	frogbasket imagine generating random functions. and immediately deducing an algebraic expression consistent with the mappings. now imagine throwing away the ones that are equal or greater than the sequence we are trying to reduce to a function.  or as you just read from wiki, imagine skipping when you can't

2016-09-17 19:23:36	Muyfret	yeah it may be i need two different things. one to check if an algebraic expression exists for the function, and another to do the immediate deducing assuming an expression is provably available

2016-09-17 19:25:44	Muyfret	frogbasket, the idea is to decipher what's given. starting from algebraic expressions is doable. as fruity as it sounds think of it like trying to have the computer recognize all on its own.
2016-09-17 19:26:12	frogbasket	this is too cryptic for me
2016-09-17 19:26:15	Muyfret	you may not be given or it may not be given something that is expressible like we want
2016-09-17 19:27:03	Muyfret	not too confuse you. we don't want to cheat and start with an algebraic expression. we're assuming the function is possibly not reduceable to a neat algebraic expression

2016-09-17 21:38:53	B3nszy	Nope
2016-09-17 21:38:58	hk238	it makes sense to call the HS stuff algebra based on history of the term, and it makes sense to call the contents of .. algebra, abstract, due to them being abstract

2016-09-17 22:29:18	a____ptr	with the collatz conjecture, the "2-highways" really is the "1" highway
2016-09-17 22:29:27	int-e	one funny thing about the collatz function is that if you extend it to the integers, there are quite a few loops besides -2 -> -1 -> -2, for example -55,-164,-82,-41,-122,-61,-182,-91,-272,-136,-68,-34,-17,-50,-25,-74,-37,-110,-55,...

2016-09-17 22:29:34	a____ptr	any odd number has it's own "highway" doesn't it
2016-09-17 22:29:50	a____ptr	3*2^k will all trivially go down to 3

2016-09-17 22:52:18	int-e	sure: I believe a multi-pronged approach is better for teaching math. You need examples to draw from in order to motivate all the abstractions. Yes, you will revisit some topics because initially they cannot be treated with full rigor. But I don't believe that it is a waste of time per se, because even without rigor, you can build intuition that will be very useful later on.
2016-09-17 22:52:22	boarders	probably there are loads of these foundational type books and picking up any of them will do what you want

2016-09-17 22:53:14	Svitkona	i'm pretty sure we've had this exact same discussion with you more than once, B3nszy
2016-09-17 22:53:15	sure	but it works the other way around too: you teach the structure and the formalism first so people gets accustomed with it, and then find example or build example
2016-09-17 22:53:22	a____ptr	Svitkona: ++
2016-09-17 22:53:30	sure	giving vocabulary is nice too

2016-09-17 22:54:15	dalcde	I don't think we should start at formal logic. You can learn what it means to "prove" something without doing formal logic. And I think that's how it historically worked.
2016-09-17 22:54:18	B3nszy	I'm not familiar with the areas of math but I am interested in patterns
2016-09-17 22:54:22	sure	int-e: yeah, thats a real issue: it also makes student think maths is just by heart recipee, and doesn't motivate the smart student whgo doesnt know what real maths is to pursue this vocation

2016-09-17 23:15:34	boarders	I agree there are interesting examples e.g. I can take any group, I can take Vect(X) the monoid of vector bundles on a space (or similar with projective modules), I can take an idempotent monoid which is related to the theory of lattices etc
2016-09-17 23:15:50	boarders	but I think it is easier for groups to have representative examples for elementary purposes
2016-09-17 23:16:07	boarders	idk maybe you are right and I just haven't seen the textbook that makes this material reasonable at a basic level
2016-09-17 23:16:17	sure	because there isn't any

2016-09-17 23:16:49	boarders	monoids it is hard to have representative examples because the theory is too general in a way
2016-09-17 23:17:24	boarders	it is also worth noting that it is historically backwards I think
2016-09-17 23:17:31	sure	as every maths taught
2016-09-17 23:17:39	sure	its at first a big mess, then its ordered
2016-09-17 23:17:47	dalcde	I'd say the canonical example of a monoid is End(X) for X an object in a category, and the canonical example of a group is Aut(X) for X an object in a category.
2016-09-17 23:17:57	boarders	the concept of field precedes (maybe no formally) the concept of a group which precedes the concept of a monoid
2016-09-17 23:18:06	sure	yes, as every maths boarders

2016-09-17 23:45:36	hk238	by fundamental theorem of arithmetic, all numbers have a prime factorization.. which you can classify as follows: they contain a 2, all the factors are 1 mod 4, all the factors are 3 mod for, or they're mixed
2016-09-17 23:45:44	hk238	all natural nubmers I mean
2016-09-17 23:46:00	hk238	so if it has a 2 in it, then the number isn't 3 mod 4
2016-09-17 23:46:08	hk238	if the all primes are 1 mod 4, then the number is as well
2016-09-17 23:46:26	hk238	and wait I made mistake at this point :d nevermind I dont know how to do it

2016-09-17 23:47:38	hk238	so right yeah it works, if the number is 3 mod 4, then it has must have a prime factor that is 3 mod 4.. but it's not necessarily true that a prime factorization that has a 3 mod 4 prime in it, yields a number that's 3 mod 4.. so it goes just 1 way? is that correct?
2016-09-17 23:47:59	hk238	I dont know
2016-09-17 23:49:23	karl	hk238: that proves what he was asking for
2016-09-17 23:49:27	boarders	hk238: that is correct and you can even say that it must have an odd number of factors equal to 3 mod 4
2016-09-17 23:49:36	Plissken	hk238: darn it seemed so promising... google told me that since the number is 3 mod 4 all its prime factors had to be odd, can you explain to me why?

2016-09-17 23:49:41	hk238	yay ^^
2016-09-17 23:49:49	Plissken	i think the proof is about ruling out even prime factors mod 4, and then showing that there exists at least one prime factor that cant be 1 mod 4

2016-09-18 00:23:54	Vicky	boarders: So it's just an axiom to make sure the rules of operation hold together
2016-09-18 00:24:27	int-e	boarders: it can be an axiom. in (abstract) algebra it usually isn't: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_%28mathematics%29#Definition
2016-09-18 00:24:34	Vicky	But I still have to verify that nothing breaks if I introduce that axiom. How do I verify that?
2016-09-18 00:24:37	pwca	boarders is wrong.
2016-09-18 00:24:40	pwca	it's not an axiom.
2016-09-18 00:25:10	boarders	ok whatever, it is easy to show using exactly this distribuitivity argument
2016-09-18 00:25:21	pwca	which is why it's not an axiom.
2016-09-18 00:25:43	Vicky	So how do I prove -1*-1, when I only have multiplication defined in Z for all n \in Z, n >= 0?
2016-09-18 00:26:04	a____ptr	N_0
2016-09-18 00:26:05	a____ptr	?
2016-09-18 00:26:24	int-e	Vicky: in that case, -1 * -1 is undefined, and there is nothing you can say about it.
2016-09-18 00:26:31	pwca	-1 is the additive inverse of 1. so (1-1) = 0. 0 absorbs multiplication so -1*(1-1)=0 using distributivity you get (-1)*1 + (-1)*(-1) = 0 so you take +1 on both sides and get (-1)*(-1) = 1.
2016-09-18 00:26:36	pwca	there you go, Vicky.
2016-09-18 00:26:58	Vicky	I have addition defined for all n \in Z, but that doesn't seem to help me.

2016-09-18 01:07:49	sure	boarders: the difference lies in the fact that when you say that a category with one object with all arrows invertibles is a group, then you're using the "external" definition of group applied to category theory, while the "group object one" is an internal notion of group inside CT, used with the language of CT (ie objects, arrows, and composition)

2016-09-18 01:59:59	baxx	you know the interior angle of a circle is 2*pi
2016-09-18 02:00:03	baxx	so it's consistent

2016-09-18 02:03:22	hk238	tommycannady it seems to be just to get the fraction of the angle, so the central angle is 2pi in radians, the proportion to the area of the circle is angle/2pi.. so when the area has pi in it, they cancel out and it leaves just the two
2016-09-18 02:04:05	hk238	so it's actually like πr²(α/2π) for the sector and then it's simplified to (r²α)/2
2016-09-18 02:04:21	hk238	or something like that
2016-09-18 02:05:02	tommycannady	that explains it
2016-09-18 02:05:44	tommycannady	oh,is it a matter of degrees to radians ?
2016-09-18 02:06:04	tommycannady	we had to do some of that previously in a small calculation
2016-09-18 02:06:35	tommycannady	I'm only a simple robot : )

2016-09-18 02:08:06	hk238	:D
2016-09-18 02:08:12	hk238	or at least at the current moment
2016-09-18 02:08:12	tommycannady	if the world were in a simulation, somewhere in the multiverse and you figured it out there would be a 50% probability that your math would be blocked;)
2016-09-18 02:08:22	majesticc	I have asked this in another channel but I will give it a try here: If I shall solve this IVP problem by using Laplace transforms: y'' + y = u(t-3); y(0) =0, y'(0) = 1, then I could just take L^-1{y''} = s^2*Y(s) - s*0 - 1 = s^2*Y(s) - 1, then L^-1{y} = Y(s), so inserting that in the equation our LHS = Y(s)(s^2 + 1) - 1. Our RHS would then be L{u(t-3)} and we know that this should be L{u(t-3)}
2016-09-18 02:08:23	majesticc	= e^(-3s)*L{1 + 3} = e^(-3s)*4/s, alright so if we set LHS = RHS we find that Y(s) = (4e^(-3s) + s) / (s(s^2+1)), does it look alright so far?

2016-09-18 02:10:03	tommycannady	sure.. secret of mana is an snes game.. a legal clone of the game would have some math involved

2016-09-18 06:28:51	illustion	where we take partial sums here inside
2016-09-18 06:29:09	somiaj	illustion: then just use the triangle inequality to show that ||sum(x_i)|| - e <= ||x|| <= ||sum(x_i)|| + e and then you get that ||sum(x_i)|| also converges

2016-09-18 08:28:30	Millennial	if you see this on, say, a multiple choice exam, then the standard procedure for radical simplification is "rationalize the denominator and pull perfect squares out of the radical"
2016-09-18 08:28:35	frogbasket	just-now: take BsubsetA
2016-09-18 08:28:43	Millennial	but again, whether this form is actually simpler or not may depend
2016-09-18 08:28:48	Millennial	on circumstances
2016-09-18 08:28:51	frogbasket	just-now: are you asking if it is every possible?
2016-09-18 08:28:52	Indivicivet	oh yeah rationalizing the denominator also maybe quite good
2016-09-18 08:28:56	frogbasket	just-now: take A=emptyset

2016-09-18 08:29:45	just-now	frogbasket, i think it works even if A = emptyset?
2016-09-18 08:29:49	math116	OI have U = {1,2,3,4,5} and X=P(U) = set of all subsets of U. Let C = {1,3}. Define the relation rho on X by: A rho B iff A intersection C = B intersection C where A,B are sets contained in X. Show rho is an equivalence relation on X.

2016-09-18 09:13:48	frogbasket	[18:36:37] just-now: okay, if x is in A, then x is in every AUB_i, yes A is a subset of this intersection [18:36:37]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	just-now	[18:36:57] frogbasket, phew! [18:36:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	frogbasket	[18:37:15] just-now: but if A and B are disjoint, and say B_i=B for all i, then clearly A is a subset of the interseciton, and not equal [18:37:15]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	just-now	[18:38:05] frogbasket, for the moment, I'm only concerned with the x in A case [18:38:05]

2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[18:43:59] I am working on a question --> 3(c)(i): <Definition of the problem: http://i.imgur.com/sr3Niem.png > <My attempt: http://i.imgur.com/DY4Lh3d.png > can anyone check my work? [18:43:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	user123321	[18:49:58] 'morning mathematicians. [18:49:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[18:52:56] does anyone feel like helping me with probability questions? [18:52:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	mefistofeles	[18:54:20] probably [18:54:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[18:54:30] I am working on 3(c)(i) and 3(d): <Definition of the problem: http://i.imgur.com/sr3Niem.png > <3(c)(i) attempt: http://i.imgur.com/DY4Lh3d.png > [18:54:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[18:54:44] no idea how to start with 3d [18:54:44]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:01:36] Veruso, bernoulli in this case is just p(x) = a if x = 1; p(x) = 1-a if x = 0? [19:01:36]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:01:53] collin38: yes thats correct [19:01:53]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:02:22] okay so what happens when you plug in y=0 to q(y)? [19:02:22]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:02:49] according to my calculations, we get (1-a)^2 [19:02:49]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:04:00] c(p(0)p(1) + p(1)p(0)) = 2c(a(1-a)) [19:04:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:04:38] I thought you said y=0 ? [19:04:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:04:56] oh sorry [19:04:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:05:06] with I took as c p(0)p(0) [19:05:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:05:16] yeah that's right [19:05:16]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:05:24] so that's q(0) [19:05:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:05:34] so keep going and find the rest [19:05:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:05:46] I have done that for up to q(10) [19:05:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:05:56] oh sorry I didn't look at your attem [19:05:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:06:00] but its obvious that after q(3) its all zero [19:06:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:06:08] right [19:06:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:06:15] so you have the PMF then [19:06:15]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:06:29] what can I say about it? [19:06:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:06:43] I don't recognize it [19:06:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:06:50] it's the binomial distribution [19:06:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:07:04] q^2 + 2qp + p^2 [19:07:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:07:49] but q^2 is only for y = 0, 2qp for y=1 and p^2 for y=2 ? [19:07:49]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:08:04] what gives you the idea to add them together? [19:08:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:08:25] I mean you don't add them [19:08:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:08:59] I was just thinking maybe binomials looked more familiar when they were written like that [19:08:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:09:17] oh so its binomial with n=3, p = a ? [19:09:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:09:42] n=2 I believe [19:09:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:09:46] yes n = 2 [19:09:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:10:09] ok thanks - do you have any ideas for question 3(d) ? [19:10:09]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:10:40] that one isn't in the screenshot [19:10:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Veruso	[19:11:20] oops - http://i.imgur.com/5HRnEi9.png [19:11:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:13:08] so you need an equation for the mean of Y [19:13:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:13:14] (and variance) [19:13:14]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	collin38	[19:13:24] what's that look like [19:13:24]

2016-09-18 10:17:15	waterdrop	Basically I said that if U is a subspace of a finite dimensional vector space V, then we can just start with the empty list K = []. Then we go through all the vectors in U and for each one, if it isn't in the span of the vectors already in K, then we add it to K. The list we construct in this way is linearly independent and obviously spans U. It also must be a finite list, since it's a lin. independent list and is thus has
2016-09-18 10:17:15	waterdrop	 length smaller than or equal to every spanning list in V (and V is finite dimensional). So thus U is finite dimensional.

2016-09-18 11:55:46	Millennial	i suppose fermat's two square theorem is related, and there you can pull off a neat trick using the frobenius
2016-09-18 11:56:14	Millennial	i think you still need the fact that Z[i] is a PID, though, so perhaps this is hopeless
2016-09-18 11:56:18	Veruso	opraaa: you have sin(x)cos(x) = -1/2, so using the formula "2sin(u)cos(u)=sin(2u)", we have 2sin(x)cos(x) = -1 ==> sin(2x) = -1

I was thinking that 10 =~ 2^3 and using that... so A =~ (2^3)^{-3} and B = (2)^(-10) which has A = 2^{-9} and B = 2^{-10}, so B is smaller... but this feels *way* rough

2016-09-18 13:17:30	dalcde	So let me start. First consider the case where x = y = 0. Then x + y = 0 + 0 = 0, since 0 is the additive identity. To show that x * y = 0, we show that 0 * b = 0 in general. Indeed, we have 0 * b = (0 + 0) * b = 0 * b + 0 * b. Subtracting 0 * b from both sides, we have 0 * b = 0. So it follows that x + y = x * y = 0.

2016-09-18 14:23:25	Brainlet101	Hi.
2016-09-18 14:23:28	Samian	you know how a sin function can be plotted just by plotting sin(x)
2016-09-18 14:23:41	Samian	is there something similar for the gausian function?
2016-09-18 14:23:53	Samian	is there a gaussian(x) function?
2016-09-18 14:24:03	PJBoy	yeah
2016-09-18 14:24:13	Samian	is there a gaussian(x) function that I can plug into my calculator in the same way that I can plug sin(x) into my calculator?
2016-09-18 14:24:43	PJBoy	if your calculator has a gaussian(x) function I suppose
2016-09-18 14:25:11	Brainlet101	When you compute sin(x) using that series, is it for x degrees?
2016-09-18 14:25:12	Samian	and you know how sin(x) can be computed using the taylor series
2016-09-18 14:25:17	dzack	Samian: yes, are you trying to plot something like a normal distribution?
2016-09-18 14:25:17		[14:25]
2016-09-18 14:25:21	Samian	is there some way to compute the guassian function?
2016-09-18 14:25:32	Indivicivet	Samian: uh you know the gaussian is e^-x^2 up to scaling?
2016-09-18 14:25:36	Samian	I never really understood the difference between normal districution and the gaussian function
2016-09-18 14:25:48	zHafydd	Brainlet101: unless "that series" is a non-standard one, no; it's for radians.
2016-09-18 14:25:53	Samian	Indivicivet nope didn't know that
2016-09-18 14:25:54	dzack	normal dist has scaling factors for sd and variance
2016-09-18 14:25:57	Indivicivet	Samian: the normal distribution is a probability distribution, the gaussian function is a function
2016-09-18 14:26:08	Samian	Indivicivet they always looked the same to me
2016-09-18 14:26:22	dzack	or mean, rather, not variance
2016-09-18 14:26:23	Indivicivet	Samian: essentially the difference is that for a normal/gaussian distribution, the integral is normalized to 1
2016-09-18 14:26:27	Simply_	hey can anyone help me with factoring? I've been going though it along pretty well, but I've gotten stuck at x^4-81 and dont know how to start for this one

2016-09-18 14:26:43	zHafydd	Brainlet101: and the power series is simplest when one uses radians, which is one of the reasons that we use radians in mathematics.
2016-09-18 14:26:48	Indivicivet	Samian: so e^-x^2 is a gaussian function, but it can't be a probability distribution (on R) because the probability doesn't add up to 1
2016-09-18 14:26:54	dzack	and yes you can expand it, just use the taylor series for e^x based at zero
2016-09-18 14:26:55	Samian	normal districution is not the same as gaussian districution?
2016-09-18 14:27:03	PJBoy	Simply_, you can start with the difference of two squares
2016-09-18 14:27:05	Indivicivet	Simply_: ca you do y^2-81?
2016-09-18 14:27:26	Samian	Indivicivet so it's basically e^-x^2 scaled such that the integral between -1 and 1 is 1?

So (A intersection C) = (B intersection C) and (B intersection C) = (D intersection C) implies that (A intersection C) = (D intersection C)?

2016-09-18 16:48:33	flebron	The context is I'm playing around with threads and thread queues. The task I am doing is adding the primes in some range, with the trivial algorithm which checks until sqrt(k) with modulus. I want to divide the ranges into "equal cost" tasks, meaning, a task will be adding the primes in a range [i, j], and I'd want to make these ranges cost about the same.
2016-09-18 16:48:50	flebron	I can't make them have the same size, because primality checking in the higher ranges costs more than in the lower.
2016-09-18 16:48:52	PlanckWalk	Oh, not using a sieve?
2016-09-18 16:48:59	flebron	Nah, just to play with threads.

The amount by which to increment it should depend on the expected cost of your block, such that threads have mostly equivalently costly tasks.

2016-09-18 18:14:58	mxms	ok dumb question: when solvign for the null space, suppose i have some matrix {{1,3,-5},{0,1,-1/4}}, can i just do x + 3y -5z = 0, and y - (1/4) z = 0?
2016-09-18 18:14:58		[18:14]
2016-09-18 18:15:13	mxms	or do i need to create a matrix that is 2x3 and setup 6 new variables and solve that multiplication

2016-09-18 18:15:27	meglomaniac	I managed to prove it by appealing to the fact that if such a triangle existed, the triangle formed by the three midpoints of each side of the larger triangle would be similar to the larger triangle, and would be a 90,45,45 triangle with sides 1/2 the length of the larger triangle containing the square
2016-09-18 18:15:43	mxms	the second option i stated seems most obvious, but it introduces a lot of variables to me. are they the same thing?
2016-09-18 18:15:43	meglomaniac	but i'm wondering if there is an easier solution to the problem
2016-09-18 18:15:52	MiseryMyra	It shows up all the time in math and physics, Samian
2016-09-18 18:16:12	Vornicus	meglomaniac: that looks to me to be a pretty direct approach!
2016-09-18 18:17:12	a____ptr	If 0 <= a^k, and 0 <= a^k([a^-m] * [b^m] -1), can I then get (0 <= a^k([a^-m] * [b^m] -1)?
2016-09-18 18:17:19	MiseryMyra	mxms: If you want, you can get that matrix in a nicer form
2016-09-18 18:17:20	meglomaniac	Vornicus oh ok, I actually didn't like my solution, because before i thought of this I kept thinking I need to think in terms of angles or something, and show that it's physically impossible to construct such a triangle :/

2016-09-18 18:21:02	mxms	i figured the nullspace could have matrices, not just vectors.

2016-09-18 20:43:57	B3nszy	Most people in science/math want to know the truth and are curious
2016-09-18 20:44:10	B3nszy	medicine doesn't seem to allow for any insight
2016-09-18 20:44:21	hallers	B3nszy, he has a phd in physics. he has your kind of background.

2016-09-18 20:44:33	hallers	he would do medicine all over again. it's a good combination of science and application he says.

2016-09-18 20:45:14	hallers	B3nszy, i believe his earnings went up by over 5X when he switched to medicine from physics.
2016-09-18 20:45:20	B3nszy	a____ptr: in highschool?
2016-09-18 20:45:21	a____ptr	(you still havent answered that question yet)
2016-09-18 20:45:24	hallers	plus he got to work with people instead of isolated in a lab.

2016-09-18 20:45:33	B3nszy	a____ptr: 0 I just started
2016-09-18 20:45:48	tom99	you know it's kind of remarkable that e^x/x has a minimum at x = 1
2016-09-18 20:45:54	hallers	B3nszy, plus in terms of dating women really appreciate dating physicians.
2016-09-18 20:45:59	hallers	it's considered quite desirable.
2016-09-18 20:46:02	a____ptr	B3nszy: ok then, seriously dont fret too much about plans and stuff, just focus on your first year and try and see what you enjoy
2016-09-18 20:46:08	B3nszy	hallers: Yes it's the best profession for someone who wants a happy life
2016-09-18 20:46:20	a____ptr	B3nszy: usually the choices becomes much clearer once you're done with your first year/first semester
2016-09-18 20:46:28	B3nszy	Some people are masochists though.
2016-09-18 20:46:49	a____ptr	hallers: i honestly think that no sane people should want to work as a researcher/join the academia
2016-09-18 20:46:50	B3nszy	a____ptr: I seem to be drawn to AI the most
2016-09-18 20:46:53	tom99	but actually not really because for x < 1 the fact that e^x >= x is trivially true

2016-09-18 20:47:07	hallers	B3nszy, btw, he works practically part-time hours these days and because he's a senior level anesthesiologist with his own corporation he still does over $500,000 before taxes.

2016-09-18 22:41:42	meglomaniac	the question doesn't actually specify, but I think it means sup{|xy| | x,y belong to the boundary of the region}
2016-09-18 22:42:19	_kmh_	so the largest possible distance rather than the smallest?
2016-09-18 22:42:46	meglomaniac	right, largest possible distance
2016-09-18 22:43:08	_kmh_	meglomaniac, ok so it is would be always contained in a circle then
2016-09-18 22:43:22	meglomaniac	_kmh_ how do you know that?
2016-09-18 22:43:23	cherim	Your constant sqrt(3)/2 is right. The proof indeed goes along inscribing any set of diameter <=1 in a hexagon. It's not very short.
2016-09-18 22:43:52	meglomaniac	cherim what isn't very short? the proof?
2016-09-18 22:44:19	meglomaniac	what if the region isn't convex
2016-09-18 22:44:37	meglomaniac	how do you know for sure it can be inscribed in a circle of diameter 1
2016-09-18 22:44:43	_kmh_	meglomaniac, hmm i just stated that by intuition, but i think you can proof that with a contradiction argument

2016-09-18 22:45:34	_kmh_	meglomaniac, well say you have diameter 1
2016-09-18 22:45:38	meglomaniac	_kmh_ intuitively I would try and construct the circle by choosing the midpoint of the diameter as the center of the circle
2016-09-18 22:45:49	meglomaniac	_kmh_ but I don't know if that argument actually works for all types of regions
2016-09-18 22:45:50	_kmh_	now draw a circle with that diameter
2016-09-18 22:46:49	meglomaniac	cherim wait.., surely not every planar region of diameter 1 can be inscribed in a hexagon, for example, a circle of diameter 1
2016-09-18 22:46:58	meglomaniac	cherim do you mean inscribe in a circle of diameter 1?
2016-09-18 22:47:28	meglomaniac	cherim in fact tons of planar regions of diameter 1 can't be inscribed in a hexagon
2016-09-18 22:47:40	cherim	In hexagon with which side?
2016-09-18 22:47:42	_kmh_	meglomaniac,  i don't think you need convexity, just your diameter definition
2016-09-18 22:48:07	meglomaniac	_kmh_ hmm, okay, well if I can really always inscribe it in a circle, the proof is fairly easy after that
2016-09-18 22:48:27	cherim	The circle won't do.
2016-09-18 22:48:51	meglomaniac	cherim why is that?
2016-09-18 22:49:44	meglomaniac	I don't understand how its possible to inscribe every region of diameter 1 in a regular hexagon of side 1/2
2016-09-18 22:50:39	_kmh_	meglomaniac, hmm you are right, the circle may not inscribe it
2016-09-18 22:50:57	cherim	For the circle counterexample, take a triangle with sides 1,1,1.
2016-09-18 22:51:07	_kmh_	you can consider a cross/T configuration
2016-09-18 22:51:40	meglomaniac	cherim oh of course
2016-09-18 22:51:48	meglomaniac	cherim you're right
2016-09-18 22:52:04	meglomaniac	cherim when you said "it isn't very short" , you were talking about this proof?
2016-09-18 22:53:01	cherim	The hexagon should be the one circumscribed around the circle of diameter 1. That works, and I read the proff in a book ~20 years ago...

2016-09-18 23:25:05	meglomaniac	cherim I didn't believe that, I did conjecture that the circle does though, so I guess your argument still stands
2016-09-18 23:25:19	meglomaniac	cherim its probably how I've drawn it, it doesn't seem much *bigger* than the circle
2016-09-18 23:26:44	cherim	meglomaniac: The idea of a proof is to sandwich the set between 3 pairs of parallel lines "tangent" to it, then to rotate the lines until they form a hexagon with symmetries.

2016-09-19 00:03:11	kktt	I need a 'general solution' if that's the english term
2016-09-19 00:03:31	mxms	it is, but it seems strange for x to be a function of y. x(y) x'(y) - y - x(y)^7 = 0
2016-09-19 00:03:32	kktt	I'm not sure, it just says that.
2016-09-19 00:03:32	mxms	right?
2016-09-19 00:04:59	kktt	there is also a similar: y''-2y'+y=x2+5

This is the rate of change of x with respect to y.

Alright so I know that y(x) = sum(n=0..inf, a_n * x^n). So from there we can construct the power series for y' and y''. Doing so we obtain that y''(x) = sum(n=2..inf, n(n-1)x^(n-2)). Okay so now we can just switch the index so that
2016-09-19 01:43:55	majesticc	k = n-2, then we get that y''(x) = sum(n=2..inf, (k+2)(k+1)a_(k+2)*x^k). We also switch the index for the power series of y(x) to n=k, so we have both series with index k. Inserting these two into the DE we obtain that sum(n=2..inf, (k+2)(k+1)a_(k+2)*x^k) - x^2[ sum(k=0..inf, a_k * x^k) ] = 0, but that factor x^2 bugs me very much because I cant merge these two in a nice way then, or perhaps I

2016-09-19 02:46:13	Millennial	you are making a statement about definite integrals
2016-09-19 02:46:21	Millennial	and that statement is obvious if you write down a definition of "definite integral"
2016-09-19 02:46:29	meglomaniac	ottanta WLOG there are only two cases, b>= a+T, or a<b<b+T, the first case is easy, now you just need to deal with the second
2016-09-19 02:46:32	Millennial	since you can use the intuition you get by drawing pictures
2016-09-19 02:46:48	Millennial	but you are refusing to write down a definition, and hence you are unable to solve the problem
2016-09-19 02:46:58	ottanta	the definition being area?
2016-09-19 02:47:00	ottanta	like
2016-09-19 02:47:03	meglomaniac	ottanta * a<b<a+T
2016-09-19 02:47:14	meglomaniac	lol
2016-09-19 02:47:16	ottanta	that's entirely useless from the situation where I'm trying to approach it purely algebraically
2016-09-19 02:47:25	Millennial	yes, because "area" is not a mathematical definition
2016-09-19 02:47:26	ottanta	meglomaniac: thanks

2016-09-19 02:47:47	Millennial	in fact, the definition you are supposed to give here should also give formal meaning to the concept of "area"
2016-09-19 02:47:51	ottanta	Millennial: geometry is inherently mathematical
2016-09-19 02:47:52	meglomaniac	ottanta how did your teacher/professor introduceit
2016-09-19 02:48:30	ottanta	megalomaniac I would guess that 8 or 10 years ago my professor introduced integrals as a riemann sum
2016-09-19 02:48:39	Cooler	if you have a large matrix of values, whats the most efficient way to find a smaller N x M matrix inside which has the maximum value(the sum of its elements is the highest) of all such possible matrices

2016-09-19 02:49:25	l_coal	Cooler I don't understand your question. Can you phrase it slightly differently?

2016-09-19 04:43:03	somiaj	I don't think you want to multiply by 3. You have 4 games and three players. So each player wins one game. That means only one game can be won by any player, 1*(1/3)*(1/3)*(1/3) and then remove order by multiplying by the number of ways you can reorder which games are one.
2016-09-19 04:43:04	HisShadow_	that's like the best reason you can have

2016-09-19 04:50:47	MotivicScones	and FTC requires some assumptions, like continuity -- for discontinuous functions, the indefinite integrals might not be differentiable, so they can't be antiderivatives of anything
2016-09-19 04:52:10	baxx	hmm ok... i usually think of integration as 'the area under a curve', but this is probably a pretty daft way to consider it.
2016-09-19 04:52:11	MotivicScones	an example is the function f: R -> R given by f(x) = |x|/x for all x nonzero, and f(0) = 0: this is integrable, and its indefinite integral with lower bound zero is the absolute value function, which isn't differentiable
2016-09-19 04:52:20	baxx	i mean, limiting it to that at least
2016-09-19 04:52:32	PJBoy	oooh
2016-09-19 04:52:37	PJBoy	that's not something I've ever considered
2016-09-19 04:52:42	MotivicScones	baxx: no, that's a very reasonable way: the "(signed) area under a curve" is exactly what the whole "limit of Riemann sums" thing is formalizing

But I'm given no information about the function, or it's first derivative about the point, then how am I supposed to draw that around the point? I want to say inflexion point, but that would assume the first derivative is zero right? I'm not told that.
2016-09-19 09:36:28	Z-module	you can't assume or draw anything, really
2016-09-19 09:37:09	Z-module	but it can be an inflection point without f' being 0
2016-09-19 09:37:25	Z-module	it just means the concavity of the graph changes direction at that point

2016-09-19 11:06:24	TikityTik	Hi all, I'm extremely rusty with my linear algebra. I am solving a system of linear equations and I got the matrix to be in RREF. However, the right side has non-zero numbers. Are they not supposed to be 0?
2016-09-19 11:07:02	dila	no, that is the result of multiplying the vector by the inverse

2016-09-19 11:07:32	dila	well, actually if you were to continue and do full gauss-jordan, then it would be
2016-09-19 11:07:38	TikityTik	So how would I get the x vectors if the right side is 0?
2016-09-19 11:07:50	dila	you have now the vector in some intermediate state, you can still finish off the computation using backsubstitution to obtain the solution vector

2016-09-19 11:13:45	dila	obviously, if your only purpose of computing A^-1 is to use it to find x by evaluating A^-1*y, then you might as well carry y through the computation instead of all the I columns - saving you a load of work

2016-09-19 11:15:34	Vornicus	you aim at the identity matrix because when you get it there you have the inverse (or at least the result of applying the inverse to the target vector) on the other side.

2016-09-19 12:28:26	hotbobby	the answer shows the correct graph being in quadrant three.
2016-09-19 12:29:02	hotbobby	this is literally the entire problem

2016-09-19 12:29:14	hotbobby	the graph on the bottom is what I Should Get

2016-09-19 12:29:56	antonfire	then what the fuck do you think the picture has to do with the fucking question?
2016-09-19 12:30:07	antonfire	The question is asking you something about the point (2,-3).
2016-09-19 12:30:19	antonfire	If the picture has nothing to do with that point, then the picture has nothing to do with the question.
2016-09-19 12:31:14	hotbobby	what i know about that picture is that is the plot of the point. web assign said Yes You Are Correct That Is The Plot!!!!
2016-09-19 12:31:19	hotbobby	it obviously has something to do with the question
2016-09-19 12:31:29	hotbobby	my question is why doesnt my theta, when i did all of the preceeding steps right
2016-09-19 12:31:30	antonfire	I asked you whether you think the picture is a plot of the point whose cartesian coordinates are (2,-3).
2016-09-19 12:31:33	hotbobby	match up to that grtaph
2016-09-19 12:31:35	hotbobby	no!
2016-09-19 12:31:37	hotbobby	no not at all!
2016-09-19 12:31:40	hotbobby	Not Even Slightly
2016-09-19 12:31:50	antonfire	But you know that it is "the plot of the point"?
2016-09-19 12:32:10	hotbobby	the question says
2016-09-19 12:32:13	antonfire	So it's "the plot of the point" but it's not "the plot of the point (2,-3)"?
2016-09-19 12:32:17	antonfire	that's what you thik?

2016-09-19 12:32:44	hotbobby	so i worked backwards by checking all of the graphs to see if they are right just so i know what im going to end up wiht

2016-09-19 12:33:19	hotbobby	but that graph has to be right because these are procedurally generated problems.
2016-09-19 12:33:24	hotbobby	so /i/ must be doing something wrong
2016-09-19 12:33:26	antonfire	You think that picture is "the plot of the point" but it's not "the plot of the point whose cartesian coordinates are (2,-3)"?
2016-09-19 12:33:29	antonfire	is that correct?
2016-09-19 12:33:36	hotbobby	it is not the plot of either of them
2016-09-19 12:33:37	boarders	well the 'graph' is not right, sorry
2016-09-19 12:33:59	boarders	so why are you using it to conclude which quadrant the point (2,-3) lies in?

2016-09-19 12:38:30	antonfire	fortunately, showing other people they're wrong about things is often helpful to those people, so occasionally it all works out well for everyone.

2016-09-19 12:39:34	baxx	what makes a function so that I can't integrate it? like, e^x^4 ... it's because it's non made of elementary functions?

2016-09-19 12:45:48	hotbobby	the problem says it is a polar coordinate. when i treat it like a polar coordinate, it doesnt work

2016-09-19 12:46:57	somiaj	baxx: note can't integrate is not the same thing as 'cannot write down an antiderivative as a finite combination of elementary functions'. The theorems that prove certain thigns like say antiderivatives e^(x^2) or e^(x^4) are a bit complicated if I recall.

2016-09-19 12:53:02	Millennial	for example, here's the algorithm in action with 1, 2, 3: we multiply 1 by something to make it a perfect power, i chose 2^2
2016-09-19 12:53:10	Millennial	so now our set looks like 2^2, 2^3, 3 * 2^2
2016-09-19 12:53:19	Millennial	we are in luck since 2^3 is already a perfect power, so we move on
2016-09-19 12:53:21	antonfire	why would it be cartesian coordinates, then? why would that have been the first way you interpreted the question?
2016-09-19 12:53:34	hotbobby	antonfire: because when i got the answers that you did, they were marked wrong
2016-09-19 12:53:39	Millennial	we want to make 3 * 2^2 a perfect fifth power without disturbing the other things, so we want to multiply it by a perfect sixth power

2016-09-19 12:54:42	antonfire	you tried submitting a corresponding answer and it was marked wrong, so you switched to thinking of them as cartesian coordinates instead?
2016-09-19 12:54:44	Millennial	so we multiplied by 2^2 first and 3^24 * 2^18 second, which means our b is 2^2 * (3^24 * 2^18) = 3^24 * 2^20

2016-09-19 13:46:57	boarders	e.g. if b is positive and a negative then obvious, otherwise work with -a and -b
2016-09-19 13:47:04	antonfire	mathman: generally speaking, you use a calculator if you feel you have nothing to learn from doing the computation by hand, or if you feel that learning things by doing the computation by hand isn't worth the effort.

2016-09-19 14:44:13	antonfire	a____ptr: you can prove that x<y implies x^3<y^3 by noting that y^3-x^3 = (x-y)(x^2 + xy + y^2), and x^2 + xy + y^2 is always positive. But then (a) you have to actually prove that x^2 + xy + y^2 is always positive, and (b) it isn't actually, you still have to handle x = y = 0 separately, and (c) this is probably not actually more satisfying.

2016-09-19 14:45:47	antonfire	if you propose to show it by taking derivatives or whatever, then you have to define derivatives and prove some sort of relationship between them and being monotonic and junk.

2016-09-19 14:53:51	antonfire	The point is, there's a lot of heavy machinery behind the relationship between "f'(x) > 0" and "x < y implies f(x) < f(y)"

2016-09-19 14:55:21	antonfire	it's convenient to take that heavy machinery for granted so that the phrase "f is strictly increasing" can mean either one or the other, whichever makes life easier. (And it's also convenient to ignore the issue that in fact maybe f'(x) = 0 but not for too long.)
2016-09-19 14:56:14	Indivicivet	pasturesofplenty: well first off try bounding above and below by things tht also go to 1, possibly more obviously

2016-09-19 14:56:18	Indivicivet	that should make it a bit easier
2016-09-19 14:56:36	antonfire	But when you're comparing different ways to prove that something like f(x) = x^3 is strictly increasing, you should remember that in fact the stuff about derivatives actually takes a lot of work to set up compared to something more elementary like the case by case analysis that a____ptr was doing.

2016-09-19 15:12:05	antonfire	Indivicivet: My best guess based on googling is that "use the energy balance method" means roughly the same thing as "use conservation of energy"
2016-09-19 15:12:46	Abd12345	I know that the graph is going to be circular but im unsure of how to manipulate the formula to show that

Those values are given because the definition of the unit circle is a circle which is centered at the origin of a rectangular plane with a raid of 1. Therefore, that's how you can show that x^2 + y^2 = a will always produce a

Yet it later mentions that since people usually have heartbeats between 10 and 120 times a minute, dominant frequencies are computed in the range of [0.16, 2] Hz. How is it possible to retain frequencies in the latter range after application of
2016-09-19 18:06:28	SwiftMatt	 the bandpass filter??

2016-09-19 19:58:57	llinguini	frelleck: I geuss more accurately, the question I'm trying to frame is this. Say I have a set of n nodes. I want to select m nodes at random from this set, repeatedly. I can employ two processes. 1) pick m nodes at random from N. 2) Pick k nodes at random once. Pick m nodes at random repeatedly from the k nodes.
2016-09-19 19:59:03	llinguini	Are these processes equivalent?

2016-09-20 00:39:04	Svitkona	[10:18:10] hi [10:18:10]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	dalcde	[10:18:14] mantra: I don't think that makes sense, since x - 1 is not in the domain of u_1. [10:18:14]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	dalcde	[10:18:17] (in general) [10:18:17]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	Millennial	[10:18:24] problem for the chat: let tan(x pi) = sqrt(2), determine whether x is rational or not [10:18:24]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	Millennial	[10:18:32] from the polish mathematical olympiad, apparently [10:18:32]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:18:59] dalcde: that's true [10:18:59]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	codytr	[10:18:59] Would some one please tell me the right formula for this case: if 150.66m2 is %100 than how many % is 73,82m2? [10:18:59]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	dalcde	[10:19:36] mantra: What actually is your question? [10:19:36]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:19:59] it might be easier if i ss it [10:19:59]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:20:53] https://i.imgur.com/70ePOMv.png [10:20:53]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	dalcde	[10:21:32] Yeah, but what are you supposed to do with it? [10:21:32]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	dalcde	[10:21:42] You can certainly make that definition. [10:21:42]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:22:24] right. ok so the first thing is to look at the case f(x,u)=cosu and sketch u_1-u_3 [10:22:24]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	dalcde	[10:22:43] Is that the question? [10:22:43]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	majesticc	[10:22:59] If I can manage to find any t so that my constants are 0 at the same time then the functions must be linearly independent right? For example 13) here: https://i.gyazo.com/4c3dbef7d9efed68b2aef494e573ab29.png [10:22:59]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:23:02] thats the first part yes [10:23:02]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	dalcde	[10:23:12] Can you show the question as well? [10:23:12]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:23:12] precisely thq uestion [10:23:12]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:23:16] yes [10:23:16]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:24:14] https://i.imgur.com/IEZB7Vf.png [10:24:14]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	majesticc	[10:24:44] for example c_1 * [t;3] + c_2 *[4;1] = 0, then c_1*t + c_2*4 = 0 and c_1*3 + c_2 = 0, so settin t = 0 gives me that c_2 = 0 then c_1 must be 0 so then they are linearly independent [10:24:44]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	dalcde	[10:24:46] Then you sketch it. You don't have to find the closed form solution. [10:24:46]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:26:59] so, you don't think they are after a closed form solution? [10:26:59]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:27:07] if constructing one is even feasible [10:27:07]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	dalcde	[10:27:26] They just asked you to sketch it. You can certainly try to find a closed for solution, though. [10:27:26]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	dalcde	[10:27:38] Yeah I guess you can. [10:27:38]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:28:46] well I can sketch it [10:28:46]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:29:09] but a vague comment was made about actually doing the integration [10:29:09]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	dalcde	[10:29:10] I think a closed-form solution is feasible in this case, at least for small x. [10:29:10]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	dalcde	[10:29:23] I can't really tell without actually doing it. [10:29:23]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:31:20] but isn't it u_k rather arbitrary? [10:31:20]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	dalcde	[10:31:34] Huh? [10:31:34]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:33:20] we don't know what u_k(x) so how are we supposed to integrate cos(u_k(x-1/k)) [10:33:20]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	dalcde	[10:33:42] You start with the region 0 <= x <= 1. [10:33:42]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:33:52] yes [10:33:52]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	dalcde	[10:34:09] In this region, x - 1 <= 0, so you know what value u_1 takes there. [10:34:09]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	l2ingmaths	[10:35:07] 12 - 3² x 4 + 8 x 7  can anyone show me how to lay this out? [10:35:07]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:35:44] u_1 is 0 there by definition [10:35:44]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	dalcde	[10:35:49] Indeed. [10:35:49]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:37:18] so the integral is just cos(0)x? [10:37:18]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	dalcde	[10:37:26] Yep. [10:37:26]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:37:26] er [10:37:26]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:37:27] x [10:37:27]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:37:45] that makes [10:37:45]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:37:47] a lot of sense [10:37:47]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	someone13	[10:37:57] i hate [10:37:57]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	someone13	[10:37:59] two variable [10:37:59]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	mantra	[10:38:01] god damn [10:38:01]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	someone13	[10:38:03] integrals/ functions [10:38:03]
2016-09-20 00:39:04	cherim	[10:38:07] Millenial: No, since otherwise for phi=x\pi the number y=cos(2phi)=-1/3 is a root of P_m(y)=1 for some some Chebyshev polynomial P_m, but P_m has integer coefficients and the leading coefficient a power of 2, not divisible by 3. Is there a smarter way? [10:38:07]

2016-09-20 00:54:03	--	BigO is now known as RegisteredNickna
2016-09-20 00:54:03	Boarders	e.g. if you have the natural numbers you can take the initial abelian group that the natural numbers maps into and that is the integers
2016-09-20 00:54:04	l_coal	I don't know what that is but duly noted haha
2016-09-20 00:54:04		[00:54]
2016-09-20 00:54:35	Boarders	the point being that monoids are very complicated to understand and abelian groups are potentially easier
2016-09-20 00:54:41	l_coal	Okay, so it's sort of like algebraic completion with fields but instead it's abelian groups
2016-09-20 00:55:10	RegisteredNickna	hi, does this work to prove that n is not O(n^x) for 0 < x < 1? http://mathb.in/87458
2016-09-20 00:55:10	l_coal	How is it related to K-theory? I just got your statement lol
2016-09-20 00:55:30	Boarders	and the kinds of monoids that might be of interest are Vect(X)
2016-09-20 00:55:50	Boarders	that is if X is a space then you can study the vector bundles (continuous families of vector spaces) on X
2016-09-20 00:55:59	Boarders	and under direct sum of families that is a monoid
2016-09-20 00:56:24	Boarders	the group completion of that is called K_0(X), in words "the K-theory of X"
2016-09-20 00:56:34	Boarders	and that is what people mean by the "topological K-theory"
2016-09-20 00:56:47	Boarders	it is an invariant of your space (in fact it is a generalised cohomology theory)
2016-09-20 00:57:14	Boarders	there is then an analogy which one can make into a theorem that vector bundles on a space are like projective modules over a ring
2016-09-20 00:57:29	Boarders	and so you can take a ring R and consider projective modules with direct sum
2016-09-20 00:57:42	codytr	Svitkona: I think that helps... than if 105,66 is %100, 73,82 is %69,86
2016-09-20 00:58:02	Boarders	and the group completion of that is called the algebraic k-theory (or rather the 0th algebraic k-theory group) of the ring
2016-09-20 00:58:10	codytr	73,82*100/105.66 right?

2016-09-20 01:00:18	baxx	the algebra for it seems kinda long winded.
2016-09-20 01:00:41	Boarders	e.g. K_1(R) is a ring that tells you about the extent to which row reduction is going to work for matrices over R

2016-09-20 01:03:31	majesticc	Svitkona Oh I think I shall simply see if they are linearly independent, if they are they form a fundamental solution set
2016-09-20 01:03:34	l_coal	Given any set of abelian groups is it possible to construct a space such that the algebraic K-theorys are isomorphic to that set?
2016-09-20 01:03:47	Boarders	l_coal: the higher groups don't have concrete interpretations and they are constructed via homotopy theory. There are infinitely many groups and they can be non-zero for all values.
2016-09-20 01:03:51	l_coal	l2ingmaths Keep going :)
2016-09-20 01:04:25	l_coal	boarders I see, how are they computationally?

2016-09-20 01:05:47	baxx	 If I have let y = u(x) * [v(x)]^-1 then I'm going to have (using product rule) dy/dx = u(x) * (d[v(x)^-1]/dx) + v(x) * (du/dx) This will give me a function in the form dy/dx = g(x) + h(x) then to find the second derivative I can differentiate each of those terms
2016-09-20 01:05:47	Svitkona	is linear independence enough?
2016-09-20 01:05:53	Boarders	l_coal: I am nowhere near expert on this but I think that one of the first computations was the algebraic k-theory groups of a finite field and the answer is essentially that the algebraic k-theory of F_p is the pth part of the image of J which is to do with the stable homotopy groups of spheres.
2016-09-20 01:06:14	baxx	but with the functions given this seems like its going to be quite a bit of work, so i was thinking there might be a better way
2016-09-20 01:06:18	Svitkona	i guess the solutions are in R^2

2016-09-20 01:42:56	Boarders	Franciman: the zariski topology is the topology where algebraic functions define closed sets
2016-09-20 01:43:05	dalcde	I guess the Zarski topology allows us to define sheaves of rational functions on open subsets.
2016-09-20 01:43:10	Boarders	take it as a given than open sets in this topology end up being dense
2016-09-20 01:43:45	Franciman	and their being dense is useful for what?
2016-09-20 01:44:11	Boarders	I am going to say
2016-09-20 01:44:42	Boarders	there is this idea that if we have an algebraic fact for matrices then it is enough to prove it for diagonal matrices
2016-09-20 01:44:52	Boarders	e.g. cayley--hamilton theorem
2016-09-20 01:45:05	shdhshdh	Nice answer boarders :)
2016-09-20 01:45:58	Boarders	or e.g. 'the ith coefficient in the characteristic poly is the trace of the ith tensor power' (if this is meaningless just ignore it is a generalisation of the determinant being the product of eigenvalues in some sense)

2016-09-20 01:46:42	codytr	?
2016-09-20 01:47:01	Boarders	why is that? Well we have an algebraicly defined function which take a matrix to the discriminant of its characteristic polynomial

2016-09-20 01:50:59	Boarders	What is meant by that is that for any commutative ring there is some space which is equipped with a zariski topology and the functions on that space are precisely the ring you started with

2016-09-20 01:56:28	Boarders	e.g. you have a space called spec Z and it ends up having as points the prime numbers (essentially) with a zariski type topology i.e. cofinite topology
2016-09-20 01:56:36	Boarders	ok it doesn't matter why that is for now
2016-09-20 01:57:02	Boarders	but if you have a module over a ring then you think of this as giving a bundle over your space somehow
2016-09-20 01:57:24	Boarders	so you might know this fact that Z/pZ (x) Z/qZ = 0 for p,q primes not equal
2016-09-20 01:57:33	Boarders	(fairly striaghtforward to show)
2016-09-20 01:57:56	Boarders	but in this setting it is 'obvious' in that Z/pZ is a thing living over spec Z which is only non-zero at the point p

2016-09-20 02:59:23	Pregask	Ah. I'm trying to measure the UVB emitted by a special bulb for reptiles. I get a UVI with my meter, I converted it to mW/m2 (correctly, I think), and I'm trying to convert it to microW/cm2 to check if the reptile is getting enough UVB
2016-09-20 02:59:32	FrancisBacon	Is that I_coal or 1_coal, letter I or number 1?
2016-09-20 02:59:35	ashnur	dalcde, well, if you want the full answer I have to implement something using called rank-1 constraint systems. a*b=c is a constraint in this setup. i would like to implement the ability to check inequalites. I thought maybe something more concrete than this would appreciated, that's why I tried to describe it differently before.

2016-09-20 03:00:43	FrancisBacon	The fastest spacecraft so far launched into space, the NASA-Germany Helios probes, traveled at 250,000 kilometers per hour. At that speed, it would take the probes 18,000 years to reach the nearest star to the sun.

2016-09-20 03:07:20	ashnur	but, you do understand math. so is it possible to have some kind of transformation of an equality into a multiplication? when I think about it geometrically, one is a part of a plane and the other is some kind of hyperboloid, if i could come up with an equation that flattens the hyperboloid and cuts it just the right way, it should cover the same area on a plane. but that's just naive stuff, maybe it's not possible for some reason

2016-09-20 03:45:49	int-e	Millennial: I expect the intended solution for the tan(x*pi) = sqrt(2) goes something like this: if tan(y*pi) = sqrt(2) * t then tan((x+y)*pi) = sqrt(2) * (1 + t)/(1 - 2t), so the question becomes whether iterating f(t) = (1+t)/(1-2t) starting with 0 is periodic; however, modulo 3, we f maps 0 |-> 1 |-> 1, so it's not periodic; consequently, x in tan(x*pi) = sqrt(2) is irrational. (This can be...
2016-09-20 03:45:55	int-e	...elaborated by writing t = a/b and using the map (a, b) |-> (a+b, -2a+b) instead of f. But it's definitely within reach of MO participants.)

2016-09-20 06:21:35	hseg	That is, it is the sum of a_i-a_i+1 for all a_i,a_i+1 such that a_i>a_i+1.
2016-09-20 06:22:11	hseg	Hence, the requirement that there be an even number of blocks reduces to the requirement that that sum be even.

(for nonzero integers m, m', m'', ... where no two successive numbers add to 0)  ever manage to "touch" any of the x things.

2016-09-20 08:48:23	pedro3005	yeah but if you have to use BCH to see this then it'll only be an a posteriori motivation, because you have to develop a bit of theory before being able to show that

2016-09-20 08:51:15	pedro3005	I guess the question that needs to be asked is this:
2016-09-20 08:52:08	drazak	my definition of a lie algebra was bad, it defined them as an F-algebra w/ a bracket which satisfied the jacobi identity
2016-09-20 08:52:10	pedro3005	the point of the jacobi identity is that it tells you *exactly* the algebras that come from Lie groups. so we need to go through the proof that every Lie algebra can be integrated to a Lie group and point out exactly where Jacobi is important, and hopefully it's when you're showing to-be-group you obtained is associative
2016-09-20 08:52:24	pedro3005	i'm not sure because i've never went through this proof
2016-09-20 08:52:32	pedro3005	but I know the perfect guy to ask this question

2016-09-20 09:33:47	g0th_	$x^n-x-1$ has at most one double root at each ramified prime. Consequently, all non-trivial inertia subgroups are generated by a transposition. Since $\mathbb{Q}$ has no unramified extensions, the Galois group of any polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$ is generated by its inertia subgroups, and hence we see that our $G \subset S_n$ is generated by transpositions of $S_n$. Selmer’s result implies that $G$ is also
2016-09-20 09:33:53	g0th_	transitive, and it is a standard fact (proved in every course in Galois theory) that a transitive subgroup of $S_n$ generated by transpositions must be the full $S_n$.

Assume three sets A, B, C, with cardinalities |A|=500, |B|=300, |C|=200. Assume that the cardinalities of the intersections are |A^B|=200, |A^C|=150, |B^C|=100. Does this define UNIQUELY the cardinality |A^B^C|? If so what is the formula?

2016-09-20 11:11:03	localhost00	math346: Set e^k = 1.7
2016-09-20 11:11:10	antonfire	it's not the same thing as putting a uniform mass distribution along each edge of the tetrahedron either.
2016-09-20 11:11:10	int-e	heliosaurus: hence the variable x
2016-09-20 11:11:21	antonfire	it's not the same thing as putting a uniform mass distribution on the surface of the tetrahedron.

2016-09-20 11:11:31	heliosaurus	int-e: I am now in the process of writing a computer program such that it randomly creates sets that satisfy the pair-wise values, and see if i can come up with differing values for |A^B^C|. If I do, it will mean that in fact the individual pairs do NOT uniquely define the intersection of the triple, which is enough for me as a counterexample
2016-09-20 11:11:31		[11:11]
2016-09-20 11:11:35	antonfire	For general tetrahedra, all the centers of mass of the things I just mentioned will be different.
2016-09-20 11:11:41	Vicky	Hmm. All sound equivalent to me.
2016-09-20 11:11:42	antonfire	For a regular tetrahedron, they are all the same.

2016-09-20 12:09:35	antonfire	"a matrix whose entries can be functions of t" doesn't disambiguate the question. Lots of people will call a column vector a matrix. if A is an n by n matrix, then it makes sense to talk about the ODE you wrote down when U(t) is an n by m matrix, for any value of m.
2016-09-20 12:10:21	antonfire	And the condition U(0) = I only even makes sense if m happens to be the same thing as n.
2016-09-20 12:11:35	antonfire	Which should be a sign that even if m happens to be the same thing as n in the case you're interested in, there's no magic reason you'd have to impose the condition like U(0) = I.

2016-09-20 13:36:13	Indivicivet	although nice for proofs ofc
2016-09-20 13:36:25	antonfire	This is a case where category theoretical thinking is useful, I guess. The "point" of the product topology is that the projection maps X x Y -> X and X x Y -> Y are continuous.
2016-09-20 13:36:38	sure	also, you have to remember that the only "trivial maps" you have at your disposals wen you speak of products, are injections into the products, and projections
2016-09-20 13:36:49	Indivicivet	ah, so just compose with projections I guess?
2016-09-20 13:36:50	antonfire	(and it's the coarsest topology for which that's the case.)

2016-09-20 13:39:27	dalcde	Yeah.
2016-09-20 13:39:30	antonfire	a path in XxY is essentially the same thing as a pair of paths, one in X and one in Y.
2016-09-20 13:39:47	Indivicivet	I find it hard to check things are well defined/verify what I'm not doing isn't stupid if I can't visualize/intuit it though :<
2016-09-20 13:39:48	sure	that's why you can always write gamma: I -> XxY as (gamma_1, gamma_2)
2016-09-20 13:39:54	antonfire	Which, if you actually care about what dalcde is saying, is a case of the statement of the universal property of products.

2016-09-20 14:00:22	tom99	We will need some conditions to make sure the bijection is ��natural��. Abstractly, this says that the bijection is given by a natural isomorphism of certain functors. More concretely, by the Yoneda lemma, this is equivalent to saying the bijection is ��mediated�� by some ��universal maps��, which is how universal properties are usually formulated.

2016-09-20 14:02:18	antonfire	Considering their idea of what "concrete example" means is to give the product as a concrete example of something with a universal property.
2016-09-20 14:02:36	tom99	It's talking about a correspondence betweeh maps f: X -> A x B and maps f1: X -> A and f2: X -> B
2016-09-20 14:02:47	dalcde	antonfire: The non-concrete ones are things like limits and adjoints.

2016-09-20 14:03:19	l_coal	sure The problem I think with that is that the examples used in CT are always somewhat advanced
2016-09-20 14:03:22	tom99	the correspondence, say w, is "natural" iff it respects composition so that if g: Y -> X then f o g is carried by w to maps f1 o g and f2 o g

2016-09-20 14:05:04	antonfire	I'm not saying they're wrong about products being a concrete example of things with universal properties, I'm saying the fact that that's the level of abstraction they're on means it's not a good place to actually learn about the universal property for products.
2016-09-20 14:05:04	sure	tom99: just compose with the projection

2016-09-20 14:08:30	tom99	given f in their diagram you can get f1 by composing pi_1 o f and p_2 o f, but not the reverse

2016-09-20 14:09:14	dalcde	I prefer to define the product by a natural bijection, and the fact that the projections exist is a theorem.
2016-09-20 14:09:17	sure	they are "abstract" projections
2016-09-20 14:09:28	tom99	sure: that clears up some more confusion

2016-09-20 14:09:38	sure	objects and arrows
2016-09-20 14:09:47	sure	but of course you call these maps "projections" still
2016-09-20 14:10:03	tom99	I can't visualize what it means to "abstract" a projection though
2016-09-20 14:10:13	Indivicivet	ok so, is the following correct: x ~ x' both loops in X and y ~ y' both loops in Y homotopied via Hx and Hy. the map g(pi1(x),pi1(y)) = pi1((x,y)) is well def because H(t,q) = (Hx(t,q), Hy(t,q)) is a htpy (x,y)~(x',y')
2016-09-20 14:10:16	tom99	a projection is just taking (a,b) |-> either a or b for me
2016-09-20 14:10:34	Indivicivet	if so, is there a better way to write H(t,q) = (Hx(t,q), Hy(t,q))? I guess I could just write H = (Hx,Hy) but it seems like maybe i should be drawing some diagram to make it clear
2016-09-20 14:10:49	sure	take a poset P, and form a category as follow: objects of C are elements of P, and there exists a unique arrow x -> y iff x <= y

2016-09-20 14:22:53	sure	yes, not necessrily bounded or complete for all cardinals
2016-09-20 14:22:55	boarders	one thing that is cool is that if you have a function f: B --> |R (real numbers) that satisfies f(A V B) = f(A) +f(B) - f(A /\ B) then you can show that inclusion-exclusion is true provided B is a distributive lattice
2016-09-20 14:23:42	sure	distributive lattice is a strong condition tho
2016-09-20 14:23:49	boarders	but if you think of the lattice of subspaces of a vector space then that is not distributive (exercise) and so taking f=dim: Sub(V) --> |R this does not satisfy inclusion-exclusion
2016-09-20 14:24:09	tom99	sure: I worked out the definition of inf for a product. it sort of seems tautological. esp waht it means to say "map exists f: X -> A x B"

2016-09-20 14:24:16	tom99	is that saying there exists a number that is the inf?
2016-09-20 14:24:39	sure	tom99: it says that everytime an element X is comparable to A and B, then it is comparable to AxB and is inferior to it
2016-09-20 14:24:49	sure	remember that being comparable is already something in a poset

2016-09-20 15:43:17	tom99	Sheaves arose in geometry as coefficients for cohomology and as descriptions of the functions appropriate to various kinds of manifolds. Sheaves also appear in logic as carriers for models of set theory. This text presents topos theory as it has developed from the study of sheaves. Beginning with several examples, it explains the underlying ideas of topology and sheaf theory as well as the general

2016-09-20 15:56:24	kritter	but i am neither educated enough nor connected enough to state that confidently
2016-09-20 15:56:24	dalcde	antonfire: I'm countering your counter.
2016-09-20 15:56:26	Z-module	Mandra, the set  (1,4) x [3,5] is just  {all ordered pairs (x,y) : x in the interval (1,4),  y in the interval [3,5] }. So this is a certain rectangle in the plane, with open left and right sides.
2016-09-20 15:56:49	Z-module	Mandra: it's nothing at all about multiplying real numbers together.
2016-09-20 15:56:54	jimmit	Dalcde: a set of vectors v1,v2,...,vn are linearly independent iff the only solution to the linear combination a1v1+a2v2+...+anvn is a1=a2=...=an=0
2016-09-20 15:57:00	Z-module	That was the point of my notation-rant just now.
2016-09-20 15:57:02	kritter	It's somewhat harder to study math when you ain't got no mathematicians around.
2016-09-20 15:57:09	tom99	kind of like in magic the gathering you counter their counter-card with a counter-counter card?
2016-09-20 15:57:17	a____ptr	Guys, does discrete maths has more of the abstract stuff?
2016-09-20 15:57:22	dalcde	jimmit: a1v1 + a2v2 + ... + anvn is not an equation, and thus cannot have solutions.
2016-09-20 15:57:27	kritter	a____ptr, that depends on the course
2016-09-20 15:57:31	a____ptr	Or is DM douses on applied stuffs?
2016-09-20 15:57:41	Mandra	mm I don't understand how it's a rectangle with open left and right sides, since the values in the two intervals u specified have to satisfy the inequality
2016-09-20 15:57:41	a____ptr	kritter: just the subject in general
2016-09-20 15:57:43	antonfire	dalcde: then I can only hope that it wasn't one in the first place, so the total is 0 and not 1
2016-09-20 15:57:48	kritter	In my university, it was basically "math for liberal arts majors"

2016-09-20 15:58:22	kritter	what was that book about category theory from the ground up
2016-09-20 15:58:22	Mandra	Oh nvm I think I know where you're getting at
2016-09-20 15:58:25	dalcde	jimmit: Now "a1v1 + a2v2 + ... + anvn = 0" is an equation, but not a linear combination.
2016-09-20 15:58:26	kritter	it was NOT by maclane
2016-09-20 15:58:34	dalcde	kritter: Awodey?

2016-09-20 16:00:41	antonfire	Anyway, "discrete mathematics" doesn't really refer to an actual area of math, it's just a kind of catch-all term they use in undergrad course titles.
2016-09-20 16:00:59	antonfire	The closest thing would be combinatorics.

2016-09-20 16:04:15	antonfire	in practice, meaning in research papers, people are happy enough to write about the extended reals and use them in proofs and such because people reading math papers are expected to know what they're talking about.
2016-09-20 16:04:39	Z-module	Basically, extended reals are just gigantically convenient devices.
2016-09-20 16:04:51	Mandra	Right, the coordinates I pick also have to satisfy the inequalities, right?

2016-09-20 16:18:15	SuperEgg	So inf(empty)= infinity and sup(empty)= -infinity , so inf(empty)> sup(empty). I guess that this is an implication for when take sups, and infs of empty sets

2016-09-20 16:22:15	Z-module	well, the standard way uses the (not hard) theorem that a finite nontrivial p-group always has nontrivial center, along with the lemma that for any group G, the quotient G/Z(G) can't be cyclic unless it's trivial. But for this |G| = p^2 case there's probably something shorter and simpler all together.

2016-09-20 16:57:48	kritter	b3nsuzy, some stereotypes about us are true, some are not. But my love of math is such that I would accept any criticism for studying it.
2016-09-20 16:58:16	b3nsuzy	Well yeah some are true.. I noticed people in the sciences are more happy, socially adjusted, and extroverted.

2016-09-20 17:33:28	antonfire	whether an ordered set has a maximum is, presumably, a property that's preserved by isomorphisms, though to show that you'd have to say something explicit about what you mean by "isomorphism" in this context, etc.

2016-09-20 17:46:00	antonfire	that's the "direct", "low-level" way to organize the argument, and the more "abstract", "high-level" way is to split it up into lemmas about how if two ordered sets are isomorphic and one has a maximum then so does the other, and so on and prove them separately.

2016-09-20 18:30:12	antonfire	If it's helpful, sure, but remember that if you're trying to differentiate something the relevant question is "what information can I use to find the derivative of this thing", and "what type of thing is this" is at best an auxiliary question to help answer that one.
2016-09-20 18:30:37	GeekDude	This gets my answer to be something like "S(A) is a power function. By applying the power rule and constant multiple rule to find the derivative function, we get S'(A)=(0.742644)A^(-0.158)"

[04:30:12]
2016-09-20 18:53:14	GeekDude	[04:30:37] This gets my answer to be something like "S(A) is a power function. By applying the power rule and constant multiple rule to find the derivative function, we get S'(A)=(0.742644)A^(-0.158)" [04:30:37]
2016-09-20 18:53:14	MiseryMyra	[04:33:07] GeekDude: Looks good to me [04:33:07]
2016-09-20 18:53:14	antonfire	[04:34:36] you might enjoy checking whether that's actually reasonable by looking at a plot of S and S' [04:34:36]
2016-09-20 18:53:14	antonfire	[04:34:52] e.g. is it true that when A is close to 0, the derivative of S is quite large? [04:34:52]
2016-09-20 18:53:14	antonfire	[04:35:28] does it actually look like the tangent line to the plot of S(A) at A=1 has slope around 0.74? [04:35:28]
2016-09-20 18:53:14	alzagros	[04:36:22] say that S={1,2,...,n}. is there any notation for saying "all subsets of the power set of S such that the total number of elements in them is exactly m"? [04:36:22]
2016-09-20 18:53:14	antonfire	[04:38:12] {A in P(S); |A| = m} [04:38:12]
2016-09-20 18:53:14	GeekDude	[04:38:27] Whether I'd enjoy that or not is a bit out of the question at the moment (though I imagine I would). I'm trying to get some sleep before class tomorrow and it's 12:30 AM. I'm almost done :) [04:38:27]
2016-09-20 18:53:14	alzagros	[04:47:35] antonfire: ty [04:47:35]
2016-09-20 18:53:14	GeekDude	[04:52:51] I'm done for the night. Thanks for all the help [04:52:51]

2016-09-20 19:20:00		[19:20]
2016-09-20 19:20:23	meglomaniac	I was told that by choosing points so that the distance between the points is maximized, this is true

2016-09-20 19:21:28	meglomaniac	And I was told that if the line were not perpendicular to a tangent, a longer distance can always be found, to find the longer distance, is the procedure simply to pick a point close enough to the original point ?

2016-09-20 19:23:33	meglomaniac	antonfire right, and the point needs to be sufficiently close because we wsnt the tangent to still approximate the function well enough so we can be sure we have actually found a longer distance?

2016-09-20 19:24:05	Indivicivet	if it's not perp then your tangent goes away (in one direction; towards in the other) so you "follow it away" a little bit

2016-09-20 19:25:58	meglomaniac	Indivicivet and because the tangent approximates faster than linear, but the distance along.the tangent falls st a linear speed, we can always find points that work better?

If the angle between T(x) and T(x') is positive, then the angle betwen T(x'') and T(x') is negative, so it must be zero at some point when you move from x to x''

2016-09-20 20:37:59	tom99	antonfire: maybe you're projecting your own view onto them. some people apparently DO believe their noname blog is worth reading sometimes

2016-09-20 20:49:18	antonfire	That's more or less the usual argument. You also need to argue that the additive inverse of the additive inverse of a number is just that number again. If you want to be more direct, you could unwrap that argument and apply it to your situation rather than just citing the result.

2016-09-20 20:51:26	antonfire	you can also write down a chain of equalities like --1 = --1 + 0 = --1 + (-1 + 1) = (--1 + -1) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1
2016-09-20 20:51:49	LAPTOP_	antonfire, but is this  -a2b1 - a1b2     =     -a1b2 - a2b1  right?   if      a1,b1,a2,b2 > 0  ?
2016-09-20 20:52:30	antonfire	So if you were going to use -1*-1 in place of --1 there, you would replace it everywhere, and also replace the step from (-1*-1 + -1) + 1 to 0 + 1 with the argument you just presented that -1*-1 + -1 = 0.

2016-09-20 21:41:38	Hijiri	if there's nothing to the left then the derivative is just the right derivative, I think
2016-09-20 21:41:51	antonfire	The same way it usually is, as the limit of the quotient you're familiar with.
2016-09-20 21:42:32	antonfire	You might think that limit doesn't make sense because points near a are outside the domain of f, but it makes sense, you are just taking the limit in the domain of f.
2016-09-20 21:42:42	sure	its just applying quantifiers
2016-09-20 21:42:47	meglomaniac	Right
2016-09-20 21:42:59	antonfire	e.g. if f:[0,1]->R is given by f(x) = x^2, then it's perfectly appropriate to say that f is differentiable at 0 and f'(0) = 0.
2016-09-20 21:43:36	antonfire	And that's part of what "f is differentiable" means.
2016-09-20 21:43:45	meglomaniac	Okay, so if we want the condition I talked about before to be true, could I use continuous differentiability to make it true?
2016-09-20 21:43:56	antonfire	no.
2016-09-20 21:44:31	antonfire	you have to explicitly impose the condition that r'(a) = r'(b), the same way you explicitly imposed the condition that r(a) = r(b).

2016-09-20 23:04:08	antonfire	If you like, (cos t, sin t) is the solution to the differential equation d/dt v = Av, with v(0) = (1, 0), where A is the 90-degree rotation matrix.
2016-09-20 23:04:33	antonfire	And the picture for that differential equation is a point going round-and-round around the origin
2016-09-20 23:04:53	meglomaniac	Gilly nvm, of course not , because then there is the issue of defining a tangent at an endpoint
2016-09-20 23:04:55	Gilly	meglomaniac: yeah, first of all there is no well-defined tangent at where the curve starts (or ends), and second you might be missing some tangents for some other points

2016-09-20 23:07:33	meglomaniac	Gilly oh, thats what you mean by missing tangents
2016-09-20 23:07:34	tom99	although it seems like if I ask for why the derivative of sin is cosine, and your answer is "because that's what you get by solving the differential equation", it doesn't seem that we got anywhere

2016-09-20 23:21:00	antonfire	So, like, if differential equations in higher and higher dimensions exhibited more and and more complicated behavior that you needed more and more messy shit to decompose into, you'd be justified in saying that complex numbers aren't that special.

2016-09-21 03:34:22	majesticc	Problem 5) https://i.gyazo.com/13ecd91bc17b6016e4e37cd1982cbb81.png . I know how the procedure goes. 1. Find eigen values. 2. Find eigen vectors. 3. You find x_1 and x_2. Okay so |A - rI| = 0 gives me |(-1-r, -2; 8, -1-r)| = (-1-r)^2 + 16 = 0 so r = -1 +- 4i. Now I have found the eigen values. To find the egein vectors I simply put (A - rI)*u = 0 where u is my eigen vector, lets say u = (a;b)
2016-09-21 03:34:22	majesticc	then for the first eigenvalue we get [-1-(-1+4i), -2; 8, -1-(-1+4i)][a;b] = 0 so this gives me the equations -4ia -2b = 0 and 8a - 4ib = 0 which gives me a = -2 and b = 4i. Now we have u = (-2; 4i) = (-2,4) + i(0,1), is this even a correct eigen vector?

2016-09-21 05:43:47	umib0zu	yeah so b3nsuzy, degrees are tools. in your degree, you’ll learn how to read math for the most part. any of CS (with a serious focus away from just programming), EE, physics, or math will get you enough skills to be able to read the papers.
2016-09-21 05:44:03	b3nsuzy	I understand they're tool

2016-09-21 05:44:21	Sterile	It suffices to show that the "sign" of any transposition is -1, as then the kernel of the "sign" will be precisely A4
2016-09-21 05:44:28	umib0zu	for most people, most of the value they get out of their degree will be reading papers. most people don’t even end up doing research in the field.

2016-09-21 05:47:25	Sterile	So can you see why this implies that their sign must be the same in C2?
2016-09-21 05:47:25	b3nsuzy	If I study neuroscience im going to have a hard time in those fields

2016-09-21 05:47:42	umib0zu	b3nsuzy yes but again, degrees are tools. universities produce a minimum viable product in you. they will give you lots of foundations. chaos theory is more of a focus area

2016-09-21 06:17:06	umib0zu	berndl any really. you just need a monoidal category and some added rules
2016-09-21 06:17:08	berndl	bollu: linear type theory.
2016-09-21 06:17:27	umib0zu	jasondockers check out this book http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp13/

I recently read a book on the theory of computation at the grad level, a book on SMT solvers, and a dozen or so papers on SAT / SMT-- it forced me to relearn how to learn, which was never necessary in undergrad CS. I can actually read some CS / discrete math papers now.
2016-09-21 06:24:23	opraaa	Particularly the cancellation equations and their relation to exponential
2016-09-21 06:24:40	Sterile	opraaa, they shouldn't. All you need to remember is that log is the inverse to exp

2016-09-21 06:30:34	meglomaniac	Yep
2016-09-21 06:30:35	Sterile	opraaa, well, strictly speaking, any value of a gives you a specific function a^x
2016-09-21 06:31:15	Sterile	Otherwise you have a function of two parameters (which isn't continuous at (0,0))

2016-09-21 06:33:26	opraaa	Right so what I am confused about is

2016-09-21 06:33:35	jasondockers	Sterile, of abstract algebra.
2016-09-21 06:33:37	meglomaniac	:-( its getting buried again
2016-09-21 06:33:38	opraaa	What is the purpose of them?
2016-09-21 06:33:40	pedro3005	meglomaniac, I guess you can fix an arbitrary vector v in R^2 and consider <df/dtheta, v>
2016-09-21 06:34:00	mantra	insensibleidiot: the residue of f(z) at 0 is not 0
2016-09-21 06:34:01	Sterile	jasondockers, up to chapter 5, maybe 6
2016-09-21 06:34:01	pedro3005	there are two opposite points where this is the same
2016-09-21 06:34:07	Svitkona	uh...
2016-09-21 06:34:11	pedro3005	since this is a continuous S^1 --> R function
2016-09-21 06:34:20	mantra	also you can ignore the pole at -1 since it isnt on the interior of your curve
2016-09-21 06:34:28	meglomaniac	pedro3005 I tried that but its tough to apply ivt
2016-09-21 06:34:33	Svitkona	i'm not really sure what you're asking?
2016-09-21 06:34:34	Sterile	opraaa, what do you even mean
2016-09-21 06:34:38	mantra	so its just 2pi i*res(f(z),0)
2016-09-21 06:34:46	pedro3005	meglomaniac, first prove that if you have a continuous S^1 --> R function, there are two antipodal points where it's the same
2016-09-21 06:35:15	mantra	insensibleidiot: the pole at 0 is a pole order 2 so you need to computer limz->0d/dz(e^4z/(z+1)^2)
2016-09-21 06:35:18	opraaa	Like f^-1(f(x)) = x, for x in the domain f and f(f^-1(x)) = x, for x in the range f
2016-09-21 06:35:56	Svitkona	that's the definition of inverse

2016-09-21 06:37:16	meglomaniac	pedro3005 yes
2016-09-21 06:37:24	pedro3005	yes. you start with a curve c : S^1 --> R^2. then you fix some arbitrary v in R^2 and consider <dc/dtheta, v>. this is S^1 --> R

2016-09-21 07:18:44	kaosu	Someone please tell me if my logic is flawed or not. I can take the idea that distance = rate/time and find the rate by rewriting it as rate = distance/time. Since the terms rate, speed, and velocity can loosely be the same thing I could just as easily call this the velocity. So, in terms of a circle, I would think of the distance between two points as arc length. So, given the idea that rate = distance/time I could find the speed of some point moving
2016-09-21 07:18:44	kaosu	along the arc (linear speed) by saying v = arch length/time or v=r(theta)/time. Furthermore, using the same idea of rate = distance/time, I could figure out the rate of change of theta (angular speed) by saying w = theta/time since theta can be considered the distance between the terminal and initial lines without regard to the radius of the circle.

2016-09-21 08:00:52	Gilly	but clearly if such a map stops, all points except the end points are assumed twice while the end points have its antipodal point covered

2016-09-21 08:16:19	JordiGH	AEL-H: I would argue those two symbols should mean different things, unless you're willing to define matrices as tensors, which can be done. If you go that route, the typical thing is to define matrices as 1,1 tensors (one covariant and one contravariant rank).

2016-09-21 08:16:57	JordiGH	You can define a column vector is a vector and a row vector is a covector.
2016-09-21 08:17:00	AEL-H	JordiGH: would it be wrong to consider it rank 2 as u need 2 indices to specify a value?

2016-09-21 10:50:14	Simply_	Hey everyone, My book has this part on "factoring a second degree trinomial: method of completing the square" and in it says "49/16 is the square of half of the coeffcient 7/2 of the middle term" <- I can't understand that, the middle term is (7/2)x
2016-09-21 10:50:32	Simply_	how could you get 49/16 from (7/2)x i see the 49 but not the 16
2016-09-21 10:50:47	Ploppz	so what I'm actually asking, I guess.. is what it means to integrate on a 2D domain with respect to only one variable (w). But I know this - you keep the other variable (v) constant. This results in a function that is dependent on v. And in the case of integral of 0 - a constant in w, that depends on v... So I guess we cannot tell anything about v at this point, and thus it's just a "general" function. Is this
2016-09-21 10:50:48	Ploppz	a question? I don't know, it's just that I'm slightly confused
2016-09-21 10:50:56	int-e	Dodek: (I'm looking for a fact where defining inf and sup for the empty set is actually convenient)

2016-09-21 12:41:34	PTY	[22:25:35] Can someone help me understand [22:25:35]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Simply_	[22:25:35] I was trying to factor a trinomial by completing the square imgur.com/gallery/UdoXi [22:25:35]

2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:26:03] I considered the following group action [22:26:03]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:26:24] phi : G —> S_{G/H} where we just do it via left multiplication [22:26:24]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	PTY	[22:26:29] so what is Γ ∧ Γ and how is it not 0 [22:26:29]

2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:26:49] so if the kernel = {e} then G gets embedded into S_4 [22:26:49]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Millennial	[22:26:58] (the kernel is not e) [22:26:58]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:27:21] no when the kernel is e [22:27:21]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Millennial	[22:27:22] well, it might be [22:27:22]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:27:29] this mean the map is injective right [22:27:29]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:27:48] the map G —> S_G/H is injective if kernel phi = {e} [22:27:48]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Millennial	[22:27:50] yes [22:27:50]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:28:03] so G gets embedded into S_4 [22:28:03]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Millennial	[22:28:07] yes [22:28:07]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Millennial	[22:28:15] and the only subgroup of order 12 in S_4 is A-4 [22:28:15]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Millennial	[22:28:16] A_4* [22:28:16]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:28:16] so it has an index of 2 in S_4 so this means A_4 [22:28:16]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:28:17] yeah [22:28:17]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Millennial	[22:28:20] so you would be done in that case [22:28:20]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:28:29] but what happens when kernel phi neq e [22:28:29]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:28:35] I want to prove H is norma [22:28:35]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Millennial	[22:28:40] hint: you are approaching this the wrong way [22:28:40]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Millennial	[22:28:47] assume that H is *not* normal [22:28:47]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Millennial	[22:28:58] what can you say about the number of sylow-3 subgroups in H? [22:28:58]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:29:11] I can’t use sylow theorems [22:29:11]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:29:15] but I can use that [22:29:15]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:29:24] the kernel is the largest normal subgroup that contains H [22:29:24]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:30:35] ohh yes [22:30:35]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:30:37] I got it [22:30:37]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Millennial	[22:30:56] you meant largest normal subgroup contained in H, probably [22:30:56]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:30:58] the kernel of phi is contained in H [22:30:58]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Millennial	[22:31:02] in that case, H has only two subgroups [22:31:02]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:31:03] yeah [22:31:03]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Millennial	[22:31:03] yes [22:31:03]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:31:12] so it divides the order of H [22:31:12]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Millennial	[22:31:13] so that gives your injectivity thing [22:31:13]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:31:17] since H has order 3 [22:31:17]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:31:32] and kernel phi neq {e} by assumption [22:31:32]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:31:38] then kernel of phi must be 3 [22:31:38]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:31:42] so kernel of phi = H [22:31:42]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Millennial	[22:31:52] which means H is normal [22:31:52]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:31:55] yes [22:31:55]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	illustion	[22:33:59] oke good good [22:33:59]

2016-09-21 12:45:46	Millennial	so yes, all of them are conjugate to each other

2016-09-21 12:49:33	Millennial	lagrange has nothing to do with the structure of S_p

2016-09-21 14:44:11	AlgebraIsHard	well you could store the multiple outputs in an array inside the func.
2016-09-21 14:44:12	Svitkona	the fact that an array will contain more information than just a single real number doesn't change that it's returning one thing

2016-09-21 14:46:56	NickParker	My first thought was that all bases look like triangular matrices, but I proved that wrong by considering {(0 1 1), (1 0 1), (1, 1, 0)} which is not a triangular matrix but is a basis for n = 3, p=2
2016-09-21 14:47:11	dude12312414	NickParker: you can start by determining what exactly is the definition for a basis
2016-09-21 14:47:12	NickParker	Can anyone point me in the right direction?
2016-09-21 14:47:45	NickParker	dude12312414: A linearly independent set spanning F^n?
2016-09-21 14:47:47	AlgebraIsHard	and even though that is a single entity, you could use another function to parse the first index (of which the two indexes would have two set states E.G. the first index is always positive and the second is always negative) and the second index to create a multiple output program. Svitkona
2016-09-21 14:48:30	AlgebraIsHard	ahhh I see why you were saying it cannot be a function, beacause for each input there cannot be multiple outputs
2016-09-21 14:48:51	NickParker	So I think the question is equivalent to "How many lin. indep. n x n matrices exist with elements in F?"
2016-09-21 14:48:51	AlgebraIsHard	now what would you call something like that?
2016-09-21 14:49:02	Svitkona	i'd call it a relation
2016-09-21 14:49:10	Svitkona	you could say that a function is just a special type of relation
2016-09-21 14:49:10	dude12312414	NickParker: yeah. So now consider a single vector in F^n. How many linearly independent sets of single vectors are there in F^n?

2016-09-21 19:06:59	PlanckWalk	[04:56:22] Anyway, you have two variables: the first term, and the constant difference between tem. [04:56:22]
2016-09-21 19:06:59	PlanckWalk	[04:56:45] You also have two equations (the sum of 8 terms, and the sum of 18 terms) [04:56:45]
2016-09-21 19:06:59	enthdegree	[04:58:26] x=starting term, c=difference term. now x+36c=88 and x+c*17*18/2=558 [04:58:26]

2016-09-21 19:06:59	enthdegree	[05:01:04] da7niel: an arithmetic progression is a sequence (x_1,x_2,...) where x_1 is some number, and for each k, x_{k+1}=x_k + d, [05:01:04]

2016-09-21 20:19:35	mxms	correct

2016-09-22 00:23:52	Juniper_	[09:45:34] A^-1 + B^-1 = A^(-1) (A + B) B^(-1) is the solution. Since A^-1 + B^-1 is the product of invertible matrices [09:45:34]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	l_coal	[09:47:17] Juniper_ is A + B invertible? [09:47:17]

2016-09-22 00:23:52	Juniper_	[09:47:45] It's given that A,B,(A+B) are invertible [09:47:45]

2016-09-22 00:23:52	Juniper_	[09:48:22] Np. I love this chat [09:48:22]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	anton02	[10:08:14] its weird that greens theorem is a specific case of stokes theorem but the green's theorem wikipedia page makes no mention of curl [10:08:14]

2016-09-22 00:23:52	HoloIRCUser2	[10:13:03] Hey [10:13:03]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	causative	[10:14:11] anton02, I believe green's theorem is actually a specific case of the _general_ case of stokes theorem, which makes no mention of curl either [10:14:11]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	dalcde	[10:14:54] causative: Green's theorem is also a special case of the usual 3D stoke's theorem, by embedding R^2 in R^3 in the usual way. [10:14:54]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	l_coal	[10:15:05] Hey lotry, this thing didn't notify me [10:15:05]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	dalcde	[10:17:29] Let X, Y be normed vector spaces, and B(X, Y) be the normed vector space of bounded linear functions between them. It is easy to show that if Y is complete, then B(X, Y) is complete. Is the converse true? [10:17:29]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	l_coal	[10:17:54] My professor said that Homotopy is like the Galois theory of Topology, do any of you guys know what he meant? I don't really know Galois Theory yet :/ [10:17:54]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	dalcde	[10:19:19] The fundamental theorem of Galois theory says that given a (Galois) field extension E \subset F, there is a correspondence between intermediate fields K such that E < K < F, and subgroups of the automorphism group Aut_E(F) of F over E (ie. the automorphsims of F that fix E). [10:19:19]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	dalcde	[10:20:19] There is a similar theorem saying that given a sufficiently nice (based) topological space X, there is a correspondence between subgroups pi_1(X) and (based) covering spaces of X. [10:20:19]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	Dodek	[10:20:21] dalcde: the converse clearly is true as well. consider X to be onedimensional. [10:20:21]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	dalcde	[10:20:34] Dodek: Well, for fixed X. [10:20:34]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	dalcde	[10:20:47] l_coal: That might be what your professor was talking about. [10:20:47]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	Millennial	[10:21:10] l_coal: the idea of galois theory is to reduce the study of subfields to the study of subgroups [10:21:10]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	dalcde	[10:21:11] Dodek: ie. if there is some non-trivial normed vector space X such that B(X, Y) is complete, does it follow that Y is complete? [10:21:11]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	l_coal	[10:21:18] dalcde Thanks [10:21:18]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	Millennial	[10:21:20] and we understand finite groups a lot better than we do wacky field extensions [10:21:20]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	Millennial	[10:21:39] the same thing happens in topology with homotopy groups [10:21:39]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	Dodek	[10:21:39] dalcde: it's also true. do you want hints, or solution? [10:21:39]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	l_coal	[10:21:48] Is there a reason that there is an 'analogy' between the two? [10:21:48]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	l_coal	[10:22:03] I.e. are the techniques or overarching principles similar, [10:22:03]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	dalcde	[10:22:04] Dodek: Is it "hard"? [10:22:04]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	Dodek	[10:22:07] dalcde: no. [10:22:07]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	dalcde	[10:22:13] Okay. Then I'll probably try to figure out myself. [10:22:13]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	Dodek	[10:22:14] it's easy reduction to one dimensional X [10:22:14]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	Millennial	[10:22:24] l_coal: it is similar [10:22:24]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	Millennial	[10:22:39] again, in galois theory, we associate something called a galois group to special types of field extensions [10:22:39]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	dalcde	[10:22:44] Dodek: What I've managed to get is that we can obtain a quotient map B(X, Y) -> B(R, Y) = Y. [10:22:44]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	Millennial	[10:22:46] and we study the field extension by examining the galois group [10:22:46]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	Millennial	[10:22:58] the galois group can give us a lot of information about the field extension itself [10:22:58]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	dalcde	[10:23:00] I'm not sure how useful that is. [10:23:00]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	l_coal	[10:23:06] Millennial and that's analogous to the homotopy group? [10:23:06]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	Millennial	[10:23:08] yes [10:23:08]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	Millennial	[10:23:25] the homotopy group of a space gives you useful information about a space [10:23:25]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	dalcde	[10:23:34] Perhaps I could use Hahn-Banach in some ways? [10:23:34]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	l_coal	[10:23:41] Will knowing homotopy stuff help me 'appreciate' Galois Theory more when I learn it? [10:23:41]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	dalcde	[10:23:45] No. [10:23:45]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	Dodek	[10:23:46] you can, but it's an overkill [10:23:46]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	Millennial	[10:23:47] no [10:23:47]
2016-09-22 00:23:52	***	Playback Complete.
2016-09-22 00:24:00	Millennial	it's just the idea of "associating groups to stuff" that's common
2016-09-22 00:24:00	l_coal	Millennial Concretely what does it tell us? I've had a few examples
2016-09-22 00:24:05	l_coal	Oh okay
2016-09-22 00:24:13	Millennial	and there's what we call a galois connection

2016-09-22 00:24:32	Millennial	which is named so because it first showed up in the fundamental theorem of galois theory
2016-09-22 00:24:33	Dodek	dalcde: hahn banach theorem is trivial when you extend functional defined on a finite dimensional subspace
2016-09-22 00:24:35	dalcde	(A Galois connection is a contravariant functor of posets)
2016-09-22 00:24:59	Millennial	a simple example of a galois connection is the lattice isomorphism theorem for groups, for instance
2016-09-22 00:25:00	dalcde	Dodek: How so?
2016-09-22 00:25:08	majest1c	When classifying the critical point at the origin of a given linear system, in the case where I get the roots r = 0 and r = 11, do these two roots have oppposite signs? Because when getting these two roots the book says it is a unstable saddle point which implies that these two roots are of opposite sings: https://i.gyazo.com/b5fc9d38f9c139a2669c3928cdeaaacf.png
2016-09-22 00:25:34	Dodek	dalcde: just extend it by zero outside of your subspace, it's very easy to show that it's still continuous

2016-09-22 00:28:21	Millennial	imagine the field Q(\zeta_p), where \zeta_p denotes a primitive p-th root of unity for prime p
2016-09-22 00:28:37	l_coal	Okay
2016-09-22 00:28:38	Millennial	so, if you are familiar with complex numbers, \zeta_p in this context could be e^(2*pi*i / p)
2016-09-22 00:28:58	Millennial	i want to see which rational numbers have their square roots in this field
2016-09-22 00:29:13	Millennial	for example, if p = 11, does this field contain a square root of 11?
2016-09-22 00:29:16	sdfhsdfh	Having some trouble understanding the logic in this: http://mathb.in/87821 In the first line, where does End_F(F^n) come from? Going from line 1 to 2, I see f is the matrix A, and alpha is the matrix B. For matrix multiplication to be commutative, they both have to be diagonal, but why in the third line does it have all diagonal coefficients the same value?
2016-09-22 00:29:17	Millennial	or maybe a square root of 13?
2016-09-22 00:29:38	dalcde	Dodek: So I pick a subspace W of codimension 1, and then consider the closed subspace of functionals that vanishes on W. Then this is isomorphic to B(R, Y), and then we are done.
2016-09-22 00:29:54	Millennial	if you wanted to approach this directly, you would have to write out an unwieldy expression for a generic element of Q(\zeta_p)
2016-09-22 00:29:56	Millennial	square that element
2016-09-22 00:30:04	Millennial	and see if it could be equal to 11 or 13
2016-09-22 00:30:25	Millennial	this is already very painful for even p = 5, and to reason about general p this way is just impossible

2016-09-22 00:30:59	l_coal	And Q(\zeta_p) is a cyclotomic field?
2016-09-22 00:31:04	Millennial	yes
2016-09-22 00:31:05	l_coal	Just checking definitions
2016-09-22 00:31:15	Millennial	so instead, i approach this using the fundamental theorem of galois theory
2016-09-22 00:31:33	Millennial	the galois group of Q(\zeta_p)/Q is the cyclic group of order p-1
2016-09-22 00:31:38	Millennial	a fact that i will not prove right now
2016-09-22 00:31:52	dalcde	sdfhsdfh: If a matrix commutes with *all* other matrices, then it must be a multiple of the identity.
2016-09-22 00:32:03	Millennial	but this is nice, because instead of trying to figure out square roots (quadratic subfields), now i just have to look for subgroups of index 2 in C_(p-1)
2016-09-22 00:32:15	Millennial	and i know from basic group theory that there is only one such subgroup of C_(p-1)
2016-09-22 00:32:25	Millennial	so Q(\zeta_p) can only contain one quadratic subfield
2016-09-22 00:33:16	Millennial	to figure out this subfield, i can determine the fixed field of C_(p-1), which will automatically tell me what the quadratic subfield is, and when you do this it turns out that the fixed field is Q(sqrt(p)) for p = 1 mod 4, and Q(sqrt(-p)) for p = 3 mod 4
2016-09-22 00:33:47	Millennial	so, for example, Q(\zeta_101) cannot contain a square root of, say, 91

2016-09-22 00:34:39	Millennial	which illustrates why this galois connection is so useful
2016-09-22 00:34:59	l_coal	So we just associate to each field extension a group and then use our group theory and then bring it back to the field?

2016-09-22 00:35:16	anton02	where . means dot product what is the result of ((t − 6)i + 2j).-i

2016-09-22 00:36:51	Millennial	it is a separable and normal extension, but separability is a technical condition which is always satisfied over fields of characteristic 0, in particular Q
2016-09-22 00:36:55	Millennial	so we just focus on "normal"

2016-09-22 00:37:20	Millennial	a normal extension is an extension which is the splitting field of some polynomial with rational coefficients
2016-09-22 00:37:49	Millennial	"splitting field of a polynomial" means that you are trying to find the smallest field over which your polynomial splits into linear factors
2016-09-22 00:37:52	Millennial	hence the name "splitting field"
2016-09-22 00:38:10	sdfhsdfh	dalcde: Oh, that makes sense, thanks! How do we know that all homomorphisms from F^n to F^n are in M_n(F)?
2016-09-22 00:38:18	Millennial	for example, Q(sqrt(2)) is the splitting field of x^2 - 2 over Q, since it contains all roots of x^2 - 2
2016-09-22 00:38:24	l_coal	Right
2016-09-22 00:38:30	Millennial	but Q(2^(1/3)) is not the splitting field of x^3 - 2 over Q
2016-09-22 00:38:41	Millennial	since this field is a subfield of R, and x^3 - 2 has only one root in R
2016-09-22 00:38:51	l_coal	So we take the primitive

2016-09-22 00:39:29	Millennial	Q(\zeta_p) is the splitting field of x^p - 1 over Q

2016-09-22 00:39:32	Millennial	even for p not prime
2016-09-22 00:39:35	sdfhsdfh	are linear maps the only homomorphisms?
2016-09-22 00:39:50	Millennial	since all roots of x^p - 1 are powers of the primitive root of unity, and hence all of them lie in Q(\zeta_p)

2016-09-22 00:42:36	Millennial	and it is not obvious which field i am referring to
2016-09-22 00:42:47	Millennial	since the cube roots of 2 are not algebraic conjugates over R
2016-09-22 00:43:03	l_coal	I see
2016-09-22 00:43:04	Millennial	if i am adjoining a complex cube root of 2 to R, this field is C, otherwise it's just R again
2016-09-22 00:43:44	l_coal	I always took (m)^1/n to be the positive real root
2016-09-22 00:43:57	Millennial	yes, we usually think of it that way
2016-09-22 00:44:13	Millennial	in particular, this shows the need to identify what you are adjoining in some algebraic closure so that there is no ambiguity
2016-09-22 00:44:27	Dodek	if you adjoin complex the complex cube root of 2 to R, you won't get the whole C

2016-09-22 01:16:41	Millennial	if n is squarefree and p-1 divides n-1 for all p, then since the individual factors all have exponent p-1, raising to the n-1th power kills everything

2016-09-22 01:17:31	Millennial	conversely, if raising to the n-1th power kills everything, then the exponent of each factor divides n-1, but this is impossible if one of the exponents are >= 2, since then cauchy's theorem gives you an element of order p in your group, and p does not divide n-1 since it divides n

2016-09-22 02:35:52	pedro3005	bollu, the basic idea is that D^n x S^p and S^{n - 1} x D^{p + 1} have the same boundary S^{n - 1} x S^p. so if you have a D^n x S^p sitting inside your manifold, you can remove its interior and replace it with the interior of S^{n-1} x D^{p + 1}. this has the effect of "filling in" the hole that your S^p represented.

For any subset X, call X_R  the non-empty set of R-minimals in X, and X_{RS} the non-empty set of S-minimals in X_R. The idea is that at least one of the elements in X_{RS} must be T-minimal (if we call T the resulting relation). Since if none of them is, you can construct an S-sequence that contradicts R

I'm not sure how to do this one. I know that the root is contained within my interval. So, its either as far away as possible, which means r = b in the interval [a,b], or its somewhere between [m, b] or [a,m]. So the max distance is simple b -( (b+a)/2). right?

Not too sure how to go about this problem but my instructor hinted at this sort of equation
2016-09-22 07:53:37	Indivicivet	baxx: well for example if you view it as a function R->R then your derivative is a (probs continuous) function R->R so you care about inf and sup if those exist (because you have things between by the IVT)

2016-09-22 08:02:18	Indivicivet	baxx: y = ln(1+t^2), x = t is a parameterization; the point is to make the parameterization's derivative have norm 1 (because it's only the direction that's captured; the magnitude can be changed by a reparameterization of the surface). you can do this either via rescaling t so that |(x,y)'|=1, or simply calculating deriv= (x,y)' and dividing it by |deriv| afterwards

The solution says to add 180 degrees to -68.6 and then add 90 degrees to the answer. The vector R is in quadtrant 2 and starts at the end of vector C and points to the origin at the start of vector A. Can someone explain the theory of why we add 180 then subtract 90?

2016-09-22 11:20:37	math572	Hi. I am solving a 2-d physics problem with 3 vectors and am calculating the angle (Degrees) for R however I get -68.6 degrees when the correct answer is 21.4 degrees. The solution says to add 180 degrees to -68.6 and then subtract 90 degrees to the answer. The vector R is in quadtrant 2 and starts at the end of vector C and points to the origin at the start of vector A. Can someone explain the theory of why we add 180 then subtract 90?

We express this  angle relative to the +y axis (due North) as 21.4° (= 111.4° – 90°) West of North.    Therefore, city C is 245 km at 21. 4° W of N  from the starting point.

2016-09-22 13:01:57	tom99	or are we talking averages not maxima or minima?
2016-09-22 13:02:15	B3nszy	do you ever review the material?
2016-09-22 13:02:15	B3nszy	I’ve made this complex algorithm for learning and im curious what you would think.
2016-09-22 13:02:15	B3nszy	1.Before class I review the material for the lecture (10–15min) usually do it the night before
2016-09-22 13:02:17	B3nszy	2.During class I listen to the lecture and take rough notes(it’s mostly questions that i have)
2016-09-22 13:02:19	B3nszy	3.Immediately after class I try to write what I just learned from memory onto a piece of paper.
2016-09-22 13:02:21	B3nszy	4. After that I check the chapter or subjects discussed in the lecture or the reading that needed to be done and take very neat notes with a Questions-Answer format(this is useful for later in the steps)
2016-09-22 13:02:23	B3nszy	5.After taking my neet notes for the chapter or section I place them into a filing system for review. I use the bad lecture notes as reference for what I should review … so let’s say I took the notes on the 22nd I’ll mark it for review on the 23rd. The next day ill check my filing system, see I need to do a quick review on ‘ch.4’ ill pull out my notes and quiz myself on the topics there without looking at the an
2016-09-22 13:02:25	B3nszy	swers… then move it up in the rank of the filing system so next time I review it will be 7 days… then 30…. then 90.
2016-09-22 13:02:27	B3nszy	dalcde: do you have any critique
2016-09-22 13:02:29	B3nszy	I sometimes wonder if it's overboard
2016-09-22 13:02:39	CrawfordC	B3nszy: what if you read about experiment design for a little while & then design an experiment for your different learning methods?
2016-09-22 13:02:41	dalcde	My criticism is that this is ##math, not ##studyskills.
2016-09-22 13:02:44	B3nszy	I do this in school... it seems to work since I have straight A's and remember everything
2016-09-22 13:02:53	B3nszy	but for self study I wonder if just reading and doing problems is enough
2016-09-22 13:03:00	dalcde	It's fine if you ask about this once every now and then, but *every time* you come in, you don't talk about maths.
2016-09-22 13:03:05	sure	if by reading you mean reading without a piece of paper, then no
2016-09-22 13:03:06	sure	its not
2016-09-22 13:03:20	B3nszy	Yeah I mean taking formal notes
2016-09-22 13:03:21	sure	writting the definition formally is necessary to remember them for most people
2016-09-22 13:03:23	B3nszy	to use for review later
2016-09-22 13:03:29	sure	you don't need formal notes
2016-09-22 13:03:32	sure	but you need a pen and a paper
2016-09-22 13:03:41	B3nszy	Do you review your notes?
2016-09-22 13:03:46	B3nszy	Do you have a system for review/
2016-09-22 13:03:53	sure	my notes are draft that goes int othe junk just after i wrote them
2016-09-22 13:04:02	B3nszy	ok so you never look back at them
2016-09-22 13:04:03	sure	unless there are some very nice subtleties or technical skills i want to put properly
2016-09-22 13:04:08	sure	very rarely
2016-09-22 13:04:14	B3nszy	How do you keep track of what youre learning
2016-09-22 13:04:19	sure	you have a memory
2016-09-22 13:04:21	dalcde	I TeX many of many of my notes, and store them in some obscure folder.
2016-09-22 13:04:21	B3nszy	and how do you make sure to go back and review something
2016-09-22 13:04:39	sure	i have strong confidence in my memory: if i forget something, i don't forget where to find it back
2016-09-22 13:04:51	sure	remembering where to look at is as important as remembering the stuff itself ;}
2016-09-22 13:05:01	B3nszy	I lack confidence in my memory but its surprisingly good
2016-09-22 13:05:07	B3nszy	Im going to experiment with self study
2016-09-22 13:05:09	dalcde	FACT: You are not going to remember everything you've read.
2016-09-22 13:05:11	B3nszy	and see how this method works
2016-09-22 13:05:29	sure	when you self study, it is important to go at your rythm
2016-09-22 13:05:30	B3nszy	dalcde: the point of taking notes is condensing the book into your own words witha question answer format
2016-09-22 13:05:31	sure	even if its slow
2016-09-22 13:05:37	B3nszy	so you can review it in the future and quiz yourself
2016-09-22 13:05:41	B3nszy	that's the only reason I do it
2016-09-22 13:05:41	dalcde	What even is "question answer format".
2016-09-22 13:05:49	dalcde	My plan:
2016-09-22 13:05:53	dalcde	1. Go to lectures and take notes.
2016-09-22 13:05:56	B3nszy	I write down key question about the subject.... then have the answers on the side
2016-09-22 13:05:57	sure	i think self study is actually better to learn maths, because its not too fast for you as academics is often
2016-09-22 13:06:00	dalcde	2. Go and read them when I've realized I've forgotten something.

2016-09-22 13:06:19	CrawfordC	B3nszy: there's no such thing as a system that's 100% anything in the real world...randomness exists in everything.
2016-09-22 13:06:31	dalcde	I randomly stroll on nLab and read articles.
2016-09-22 13:06:42	sure	reading wiki or nlab randomly is good yeah
2016-09-22 13:06:44	sure	for culture too
2016-09-22 13:06:52	sure	it can teach you lightly some very abstract concepts over time

I developed a fear of doing work. The optimal learning solutions isn't an extreme in any direction, but one that adapts to the context based on intuition that has to be individually cultivated by trial & error.

2016-09-22 13:24:28	B3nszy	do you ever review the material?
2016-09-22 13:24:28	B3nszy	I’ve made this complex algorithm for learning and im curious what you would think.
2016-09-22 13:24:28	B3nszy	1.Before class I review the material for the lecture (10–15min) usually do it the night before
2016-09-22 13:24:30	B3nszy	2.During class I listen to the lecture and take rough notes(it’s mostly questions that i have)
2016-09-22 13:24:32	B3nszy	3.Immediately after class I try to write what I just learned from memory onto a piece of paper.
2016-09-22 13:24:34	B3nszy	4. After that I check the chapter or subjects discussed in the lecture or the reading that needed to be done and take very neat notes with a Questions-Answer format(this is useful for later in the steps)
2016-09-22 13:24:36	B3nszy	5.After taking my neet notes for the chapter or section I place them into a filing system for review. I use the bad lecture notes as reference for what I should review … so let’s say I took the notes on the 22nd I’ll mark it for review on the 23rd. The next day ill check my filing system, see I need to do a quick review on ‘ch.4’ ill pull out my notes and quiz myself on the topics there without looking at the an
2016-09-22 13:24:38	B3nszy	swers… then move it up in the rank of the filing system so next time I review it will be 7 days… then 30…. then 90.

2016-09-22 13:51:24	CrawfordC	"should" in this context suggests there's a right way to go about things and a wrong way. There's just ways that get you directly to where you want to be and ways that get you there indirectly.

2016-09-22 14:04:43	B3nszy	so this is a common thing
2016-09-22 14:05:04	Indivicivet	xihiro: the statement "X has as many members as a proper subset of Y and X does not have as many members as Y" is the same as the same statement without the word "proper"
2016-09-22 14:05:05	l_coal	xihiro You can formalize the idea of having "less" in the idea of natural density
2016-09-22 14:05:06	physixer	Indivicivet: I think I see what the problem is. 'All points in the shape' means they have to fill that shape, no gaps, no holes. But I'm trying to find centroid using points at the boundary-only. Plus I need to make the method independent of how many points are given. Same shape should give same centroid location.
2016-09-22 14:05:49	Indivicivet	l_coal: I think he's supposed to be getting to grips with the set theoretic definition for now
2016-09-22 14:05:58	baxx	l_coal: well idk ha ... so the question is asking that for every n where n = a positive integer there exists some k where k*n will give [something].[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]... that's phrased badly.

2016-09-22 15:43:39	tom99	i guess to do differentiation it might have to be a certain format.

2016-09-22 15:43:53	tom99	any of you guys use maxima at all?

2016-09-22 20:26:56	Oramol	If you build a fence around each animal say, just define them as being on the out side
2016-09-22 20:27:00	ramp	still need to relate this to why s_n, t_n must be both bounded
2016-09-22 20:27:10	Oramol	You've enclosed like 99.9999999% of the Earth's surface with a few feet of fence then.
2016-09-22 20:27:15	Oramol	GET IT TOGETHER FFS
2016-09-22 20:27:26	koro	ramp: if x_n + y_n converges then L(x_n + y_n) does too and so L(x_n) + L(y_n) is bounded, but that means that both x_n and y_n are bounded (otherwise one of the two L(x_n) or L(y_n) would become negative at some point)

2016-09-22 23:11:50	Millennial	is it
2016-09-22 23:12:01	dalcde	Well, this is a question on my homework sheet, and the previous question asks us to show that Q is not G_delta.

2016-09-22 23:12:47	pedro3005	for each n take {x in R; there is delta > 0 such that |x - y| < delta implies |f(x) - f(y)| < 1/n}
2016-09-22 23:12:47	Millennial	pedro3005: i am pretty sure you need the BCT to see that Q is G_delta
2016-09-22 23:13:08	Millennial	isn't
2016-09-22 23:13:08	Millennial	*
2016-09-22 23:13:39	pedro3005	what does bct mean
2016-09-22 23:13:43	pedro3005	it means pussy where i'm from
2016-09-22 23:13:44	dalcde	pedro3005: I don't think that works.
2016-09-22 23:13:52	Millennial	pedro3005: baire category theorem
2016-09-22 23:13:58	dalcde	That set doesn't have to be open.
2016-09-22 23:14:05	pedro3005	ah. yeah. but the baire category thm isn't hard to prove
2016-09-22 23:14:08	pedro3005	dalcde, yes it is open
2016-09-22 23:14:38	dalcde	Hmm perhaps it is, but not obviously so.

2016-09-22 23:14:55	pedro3005	and i don't see what else to do
2016-09-22 23:15:02	dalcde	If you take {x in R: exists delta, |x - y|, |x - z| < delta implies |f(y) - f(z)| < 1/n}, then it is obviously open.

2016-09-22 23:17:05	dalcde	Yeah let f(0) = 0, f(x) = 1 if x is rational, f(x) = -1 if x is irrational.

2016-09-23 00:42:45	PlanckWalk	"Show that there exist two points where the gradient at that point is 5/13"?  Maybe "show that there exist two points on the graph such that the secant line between them has gradient 5/13"?  Or in either case, "find two points and show what they are".
2016-09-23 00:43:13	PlanckWalk	So that's four different interpretations, any of which seem reasonable.

2016-09-23 01:50:32	LightYagami	never heard of Russel Merris
2016-09-23 01:50:35	Oramol	If there's a decision with m outcomes and another that has n outcomes no matter what the first choice is, there are mn outcomes
2016-09-23 01:50:47	Oramol	AND TO THIS DAY I cannot not think of that when someone says "axiom of choice"
2016-09-23 01:51:03	LightYagami	okay
2016-09-23 01:51:04	LightYagami	well
2016-09-23 01:51:08	LightYagami	back to my question
2016-09-23 01:51:25	l_coal	pi- That's a really high quality series I enjoy
2016-09-23 01:51:32	dalcde	Oramol: That is terrifying.
2016-09-23 01:51:50	LightYagami	instead of say calculating 0000-9999 which is 10,000. how could I say figure out max combinations of say "aAaA" to 'zZzZ" since that is both 26 lowercase and uppercase charset Oramol
2016-09-23 01:52:00	LightYagami	how could I go on doing that

2016-09-23 06:47:30	Indivicivet	depends if your ring has an inverse for 2
2016-09-23 06:47:45	slavking	a function on a given interval [a,b] has the following properties:
2016-09-23 06:48:02	slavking	its a) limited b) continuous c) integrable

2016-09-23 06:48:18	antonfire	completing the square is the process of rewriting a quadratic expression of the form ax^2 + bx + c in the form A(x+B)^2 + C.
2016-09-23 06:48:34	slavking	i.e. does the limitness property of a function ensure it is integrable?

2016-09-23 07:15:23	clatures	The 6 million hoax was underpinned by 4m jews killed at Auschwitz all along by yiddish historians. Suddenly in 1989 the figure (and plaque at Auschwitz) was downgrade to 1.5 m, immediately blowing a 2.5m HOLE very easily in the 6m holohoax lie. Similarly even the rest of the 3.5m hoax may be demolished by simple logics.

2016-09-23 07:32:34	Z-module	My favorite really obscure result about Fibonacci numbers is this pseudo-uniqueness of the Zeckendorf representation. Let u_1, u_2, ... be any sequence of (not necessarily distinct, not necessarily increasing) positive integers such that:  every positive n has a unique expression as a finite sum of some u_i terms in which no two of those subsscripts are consecutive. (So, as a sum of "only non-adjacent" terms from the (u_i) sequence.)
2016-09-23 07:32:34	Z-module	Then the (u_i) sequence has to be 1,2,3,5,8,..., the distinct Fibonaccis in increasing order.

2016-09-23 09:27:14	antonfire	Part of the process of finding out a formula for the Riemann sum corresponding to n is to find out a forumla for the area of the i'th rectangle in the Riemann sum corresponding to n.

2016-09-23 10:10:41	baxx	antonfire: i think i've been pretty loose with my working (haven't done much limits) but i have the limit as 5^3 / 3 , from factoring these out from the terms in n then scrapping lower powers of n and constants from the numerator leaving 2n^2 / n^2 = 2, 2 * (5^3/6) = 5^3 / 3
2016-09-23 10:10:57	antonfire	Anyway, the set of points where f takes a jump like that is usually called a "branch cut", and there's no way to define an inverse to the squaring function on the complex numbers without a branch cut. But there's a fairly standard way to do it with a branch cut at the negative reals, and the thing you plotted is consistent with that standard way.
2016-09-23 10:11:20	baxx	which gives us b^3 / 3 (as our original limit was b=5)

2016-09-23 10:27:45	antonfire	yon: "cusp" refers to something more pointy than just a corner, usually. e.g. the weird point on the curve y = |x|^(1/2) is a cusp, but the weird point on the curve y = |x| is not.
2016-09-23 10:28:18	Z-module	better yet: f(rational m/n in lowest terms) = (-1)^n * m/n   (and f(irrational) = 0). Then f takes both positive and negative values arbitrarily close to any point.

2016-09-23 10:28:41	DMAshura	Yeah, from what I can tell, for f(x) to have a cusp at x=a, the left- and right-hand limits of f'(x) have to be infinite and opposite in sign

2016-09-23 11:02:53	antonfire	so points in your space are parametrized with coordinates of the form (x,y,z,1), and half-planes are also parametrized with coordinates of the form (a,b,c,1), and a point lies in a half-plane if and only if the corresponding vectors have a positive dot product.

2016-09-23 11:04:53	antonfire	I think with respect to this parametrization of half-spaces, the planes corresponding to a set of half-spaces all meet at a point if and only if the corresponding points in the parametrization are all coplanar.

2016-09-23 11:26:01	Z-module	tom99: well, you work with complex functions that use the field operations from C, including division. So when looking at complex differentiability, the expression   (f(a + z) - f(a))/z    is used for *complex* z that are approching the origin 0 in any way possible.  That there is a quotient of two complex values, unlike for a differentiable f on R^2 where you only work with norms (positive reals) in the two parts:   ||f(a + h) - f(a) -
2016-09-23 11:26:01	Z-module	Lh|| / ||h||
2016-09-23 11:26:06	antonfire	So if you insist on doing the general case we're taking a step backwards to correct a bunch of mistakes you introduced in the steps leading up to you writing that summation, and I'd rather not do that.
2016-09-23 11:26:14	antonfire	So please, just do the case a = 0, b = 5 first.

2016-09-23 11:47:25	baxx	but one thing that i was confused about was;
2016-09-23 11:47:26	antonfire	no.
2016-09-23 11:47:28	antonfire	you wouldn't.
2016-09-23 11:47:30	baxx	oh
2016-09-23 11:47:41	antonfire	you would write a instead of 0. You would write b instead of 5.
2016-09-23 11:47:42	baxx	oh of course
2016-09-23 11:47:46	antonfire	And you would follow along through the argument
2016-09-23 11:47:47	antonfire	step by step
2016-09-23 11:47:49	baxx	yeah sorry

2016-09-23 11:50:11	baxx	antonfire: nono that was dumb - but i have a confusion...  what I wasn't connecting was that it ended up with 5^3 / 3 as the integral where 5 = b ... and the integral of x^2 is x^3/3 , in the case of definite integration x doesn't represent the axis (like i would usually think) but it's the boundaries - i think that confused me as well

2016-09-23 12:20:52	Padawan-	[22:09:19] Well, you asked a question. I answered you a possible answer. [22:09:19]
2016-09-23 12:20:52	Orpheon	[22:09:20] but alright, I'll look into that [22:09:20]
2016-09-23 12:20:52	Orpheon	[22:09:38] yeah no, it's a fine answer, I just doubt it's the right one [22:09:38]
2016-09-23 12:20:52	Padawan-	[22:09:38] (Which is general enough to be used in other situations, so you can learn something). [22:09:38]
2016-09-23 12:20:52	Indivicivet	[22:10:12] Orpheon: factor the operator [22:10:12]
2016-09-23 12:20:52	Padawan-	[22:10:30] Yeah well (2d_x + d_y)^2 then [22:10:30]
2016-09-23 12:20:52	Indivicivet	[22:10:56] Padawan-: can you do it now? [22:10:56]
2016-09-23 12:20:52	Padawan-	[22:11:10] Do what? [22:11:10]
2016-09-23 12:20:52	Indivicivet	[22:11:29] actually maybe because it's a square it doesn't give you all solutions immediately [22:11:29]
2016-09-23 12:20:52	Indivicivet	[22:11:43] but you can solve (2d_x + d_y)u = 0 to get some solutions [22:11:43]
2016-09-23 12:20:52	Padawan-	[22:12:02] ? [22:12:02]
2016-09-23 12:20:52	Padawan-	[22:12:17] That's not the same equation. [22:12:17]
2016-09-23 12:20:52	Padawan-	[22:12:47] I mean, yes, sure, but you'll get only a very restricted view of solutions [22:12:47]
2016-09-23 12:20:52	Indivicivet	[22:12:49] Padawan-: if Lu = 0 then L^2 u =0 too [22:12:49]
2016-09-23 12:20:52	Indivicivet	[22:13:03] yeah I didn't actually realize it's a square, I forget what you do / if you can do anything in that case [22:13:03]
2016-09-23 12:20:53	antonfire	[22:13:32] I mean, after a change of coordinates, it's (d/dx)^2 u = 0, which is maybe a bit easier to think about. [22:13:32]
2016-09-23 12:20:53	Indivicivet	[22:13:34] also I just realized that you're a different person, @ Orpheon [22:13:34]

2016-09-23 12:20:53	baxx	[22:19:27] antonfire: i'm getting (b-a)^3 / 3 as the answer for the general case [22:19:27]
2016-09-23 12:20:53	pi-	[22:19:33] :] [22:19:33]
2016-09-23 12:20:53	baxx	[22:19:36] I'm letting (b-a)/n represent the width of a section, then using this in the formula for a rectangle (for the curve x^2) as (i * (b-a)/n)^2 * (b-a)n = i^2 * [(b-a)/n]^3 , then this is written in summation form and ((b-a)/n)^3 is factored out. This is multiplied by the sum of squares up to (n-1), and when the limit of n -> inf this cancels to ((b-a)^3 / 6) * 2 which is (b-a)^3/3 , rather than b^3 - a^3 / 3 . The reasoning seems sound [22:19:36]
2016-09-23 12:20:53	baxx	[22:19:36] though? [22:19:36]

2016-09-23 12:28:13	antonfire	Okay, so you're integrating a copy of f which is dilated around x by a factor of 1/epsilon against the function exp(-|y-x|^2) over a ball of radius R centered at x.

I've tried this for values and see that it's wrong, because in the case of a = 2 b = 5 I get 3^3/3 = 9 which isn't right (it's 39) , and putting in (5^3 - 2^3) / 3 gives 39... but I'm not sure which point i'm messing up at.

2016-09-23 14:08:13	antonfire	that half-space has a corresponding plane, which you shift forward by one unit and intersect it with your region. This gives you the two-dimensional version of your problem.

2016-09-23 14:09:24	antonfire	What you're getting corresponds to the fact that the convex region in the two-dimensional version of your problem doesn't contain the origin.

2016-09-23 14:11:14	antonfire	which means that maybe this reduction isn't as useful as I thought before, because that makes it a bit more annoying to consider that two-dimensional problem in terms of its dual.
2016-09-23 14:11:15	dalcde	beaky: If you are familiar with moands in Haskell, then this shouldn't be too surprising - they are just "wrappers" around the propositions.

2016-09-23 14:12:03	antonfire	You need to either select the "offset plane" differently, or you need to know how to solve the two-dimensional version of your problem without the assumption that the origin is contained in the convex region the given half-planes bound.

But to make use of that you'd have to make sure ahead of time that the half-space you use isn't

2016-09-23 15:55:40	l_coal	Thanks I'll go have a shower and start now. I'll be back in a few hours (no doubt) with stupid questions : P
2016-09-23 15:55:44	PlanckWalk	a____ptr: Are you looking only at n=2?
2016-09-23 15:55:45	a____ptr	(and add some argument about some edge cases)
2016-09-23 15:55:56	benzrf	l_coal: as i understand it myself, generally speaking, a "homology theory" is basically a functor from your category to the category of chain complexes over some abelian category
2016-09-23 15:55:57	dalcde	a____ptr: "yeah" is not an explanation for how you got the last equality.
2016-09-23 15:55:58	antonfire	vfinale: you probably mean (x-1)/|x-1|
2016-09-23 15:56:13	a____ptr	PlanckWalk: nah it works for f(1-1/n)
2016-09-23 15:56:14	antonfire	What you actually wrote means x-(1/|x-1|).
2016-09-23 15:56:21	benzrf	l_coal: then you get homology objects associated to a given structure by taking the chain complex for an object of the domain and then quotienting kernels by images
2016-09-23 15:56:32	PlanckWalk	a____ptr: it is not true that -( f(1/n) - f(1) ) = -g(1/2) for n > 2
2016-09-23 15:56:34	antonfire	anyway, you're asking whether (x-1)/|x-1| = 1 for all x?
2016-09-23 15:57:00	a____ptr	dalcde: did you get the last equality? yes. sounds that its a perfectly valid answer to me?
2016-09-23 15:57:11	antonfire	if so, you're essentially asking whether (x-1) is the same thing as |x-1|, and you probably already know that those are different, and can come up with values of x at which they evaluate to different things.
2016-09-23 15:57:15	dalcde	Oh sorry I meant to say "How did you get"
2016-09-23 15:57:17	a____ptr	PlanckWalk: oh.. right

2016-09-23 15:57:37		[15:57]
2016-09-23 15:58:03	a____ptr	dalcde: it only works for n = 2, thats how i got it
2016-09-23 15:58:38	orakel_	antonfire: I see, so I will have to figure out how to do the "go around" convex hull computation. What I was doing before with the 2d convex hull did work as well, but that's obviously not what you were thinking of, and would require some way of finding that half plane which has all the normal vectors on the same side.
2016-09-23 15:59:33	vfinale	antonfire: Yeah I'm trying to get used to limits and factoring the polynomials so so far ive factored up to ((x+2)*(x-1))/|x-1|

2016-09-23 16:00:08	antonfire	for what it's worth, finding a vector inside the region bounded by some given half-spaces is probably also a well-studied problem, and it doesn't sound like your examples are going to be "bad enough" for it to be particularly computationally expensive.

2016-09-23 16:01:13	antonfire	The main reason I brought up the one that doesn't require you to find a vector in the region is that maybe you already know that none of your half-spaces are redundant, in which case you don't have to do any extra work besides sorting things cyclically.
2016-09-23 16:01:33	orakel_	nope, I don't know that unfortunately
2016-09-23 16:01:38	a____ptr	PlanckWalk: oh, g(0) + g(1/n) + g(2/n) + ... + g(n-1 /n) = 0 because each following g(k/n) cancel's out the previous' g(k-1/n)
2016-09-23 16:01:47	a____ptr	and g(0) = g(1) = 0
2016-09-23 16:01:52	PlanckWalk	Yep!
2016-09-23 16:02:03	a____ptr	so f cant all be positive or all negative
2016-09-23 16:02:08	antonfire	or maybe you are already familiar with how to do the two-dimensional problem that I stated above, without the assumption that the origin is contained in the half-planes.
