2016-09-09 09:29:11	+TMM	 hi all, I run a github-style website for free (as in libre) software projects who don't want to use github (https://notabug.org). I'd like some help on some inclusive terms of service for it, specifically something that makes it abundantly clear that 'satire' like C+= is really not welcome (and will be deleted), but I have no idea how to phrase it in a clear and concise way. I have been asked to provide a ToS for consideration for approval o

2016-09-09 09:47:52	+TMM	kirjatoukka, do you think that an offensive repository could be considered a violation of a CoC?
2016-09-09 09:48:08	+kirjatoukka	i do.
2016-09-09 09:48:08		[09:48]
2016-09-09 09:48:23	+TMM	Maybe I'm misunderstanding the differences between a ToS and a CoC... Although I guess that the terms could just be 'don't violate our code of conduct'?
2016-09-09 09:49:10	+TMM	am I making a distinction without a difference here? :)
2016-09-09 09:50:05	+kirjatoukka	well, i think there's some overlap certainly. taking twitter as an example, they say “Please review the Twitter Rules (which are part of these Terms)”, where the 'rules' are really some sort of code of conduct although not a very good one.

2016-09-09 09:54:30	+TMM	I think I would need only very light edits to that CoC to apply it to our situation
2016-09-09 09:54:40	+hyperstition	is there a reason sites that dont make any money/arent run by companies need a formal ToS?
2016-09-09 09:55:18	+TMM	hyperstition, it's one of the things that the FSF insist upon, there need to be terms of service that don't discriminate.
2016-09-09 09:55:45	+TMM	And it hopefully will lead to fewer discussions when I do have to kick someone off of the site
2016-09-09 09:57:51	+TMM	so far, to my knowledge, no offensive crap has made it on yet, but we only have maybe 100 active accounts, and only about 3000 visitors a day or so

2016-09-09 15:21:04	+DrYucatan|Ru	No one who uses "loli" as an adjective/noun is doing so to a young woman. it's to children/teens

2016-09-09 15:25:38	+DrYucatan|Ru	it's pretty pedo, mostly
2016-09-09 15:25:46	+tokage	I wasn't too sure about the meaning
2016-09-09 15:25:47	+meskarune	it can also refer to a fashion from japan, and its a nick name in spanish speaking nations
2016-09-09 15:25:49	+DrYucatan|Ru	theo nly thing I can think of is "lolita" fashion

2016-09-09 15:26:54	+tokage	if you feel better that way
2016-09-09 15:27:01	+DrYucatan|Ru	i wouldn't call 12 year olds "young women"
2016-09-09 15:27:15	+DrYucatan|Ru	and calling them that makes it easier to try to sexualize them
2016-09-09 15:27:48	+wgwz	just as a friendly note to everyone out there, googling "ryonaloli" will lead you to some very dark places.
2016-09-09 15:27:59	+DrYucatan|Ru	i can imagine.

2016-09-09 15:51:18	+meskarune	read the article
2016-09-09 15:51:34	+ferret_tails	the main thing I'm concerned w/rt pornography is the working conditions of the models and other professionals producing the stuff
2016-09-09 15:51:49	+ferret_tails	... and how it's presented to a potentially unsophisticated audience
2016-09-09 15:51:53	+meskarune	ferret_tails: but they make romantic artistic porn and pay fair wages and help support women's causes and stuff
2016-09-09 15:51:57	+e|m|c	I'm concerned with the exploitation of the actors, not the artistic qualities
2016-09-09 15:52:08	+e|m|c	The ethics are objective, artistic tastes aren't relevant when it comes to that
2016-09-09 15:52:17	+ferret_tails	e|m|c: likewise
2016-09-09 15:52:36	+meskarune	e|m|c: of course, but I think this company seems ethical
2016-09-09 15:52:44	+e|m|c	Seems ethical how?
2016-09-09 15:52:46	+e|m|c	Is it a co-op?
2016-09-09 15:52:47	+ferret_tails	the only thing I'm concerned about w/rt the final product is whether it's being presented in a way that either models healthy sexuality or makes a clear distinction that what is being viewed is fantasy
2016-09-09 15:53:09	+e|m|c	Oh. I'm primarily concerned with the Marxist definition of exploitation.
2016-09-09 15:53:19	+meskarune	e|m|c: dude, I lierally posted a link with info
2016-09-09 15:53:21	+e|m|c	No porn company I'm aware of does not do that
2016-09-09 15:53:29	+ferret_tails	... other than that...
2016-09-09 15:53:41	 *	ferret_tails gets super anxious about the whole 'porn industry is bad' narrative
2016-09-09 15:53:43	+e|m|c	"Our models and photographers are not just a “resource” or “the talent”; they are partners and family, the face of our company."
2016-09-09 15:53:45	+ferret_tails	because it isn't
2016-09-09 15:53:53	+e|m|c	That's some PR stuff

2016-09-09 15:55:10	+e|m|c	Even the phrase "our company" implies it's not THEIR company
2016-09-09 15:55:34	+Peng	Some people certainly try to be relatively ethical, within typical capitalism
2016-09-09 15:55:43	+ferret_tails	Peng: I'm sure of it >.<
2016-09-09 15:55:49	+elky	every company uses the phrase "our company" tbqh
2016-09-09 15:56:07	+Peng	Relatively ethical capitalism being not especially impressive from a communist viewpoint, but still
2016-09-09 15:56:41	+e|m|c	elky: In this sense though, it's "our models and photographers...are partners and family, the face of OUR company"
2016-09-09 15:57:03	+meskarune	e|m|c: its privately owned, but they give their models and crew good contracts and don't treat people like things
2016-09-09 15:57:05	+Peng	That's a terrible PR line, but most companies produce terrible PR lines
2016-09-09 15:57:56	+meskarune	the actors and models can interact in comments and they give interviews and stuff, and a lot of the metart network is made for women
2016-09-09 15:58:39	+e|m|c	meskarune: But they don't have any tangible control of the company.
2016-09-09 15:58:53	+e|m|c	Which is what I meant by the term "exploitation"
2016-09-09 15:59:09	+meskarune	wat
2016-09-09 15:59:17	+ferret_tails	I think the important thing in this discussion is a recognition that when the sex industry exploits workers they're exploiting /sex workers/ and that sex workers need to be making the leadership decisions on their own working conditions
2016-09-09 15:59:24	+meskarune	thats not exploitation, they get paid and can choose what sorts of porn they do
2016-09-09 15:59:35	+ferret_tails	... and civilians need to take a step back and not dominate the conversation
2016-09-09 15:59:43	+meskarune	unless you mean that in the sense of all jobs being exploitation
2016-09-09 15:59:52	+e|m|c	meskarune: Yes, exploitation in the Marxist sense.

2016-09-09 16:02:04	+ferret_tails	it usually goes hand-in-hand with expressing 'concern' about sex slavery

2016-09-09 16:06:01	+meskarune	its a whole other issue
2016-09-09 16:06:22	+meskarune	but I believe there are coop produced porn
2016-09-09 16:07:35	+e|m|c	It's entirely relevant if the discussion is the ethics of pornography and the conditions of sex workers...
2016-09-09 16:07:42	+e|m|c	But anyway
2016-09-09 16:07:42	+meskarune	"lesbian" porn really pisses me off, its so unrealistic and not how women actually interact sexually
2016-09-09 16:07:53	+e|m|c	meskarune: All porn is kind of like that though
2016-09-09 16:08:02	+meskarune	no it isn't
2016-09-09 16:08:13	+e|m|c	Okay not all, but a great deal of porn is like that
2016-09-09 16:08:14	+meskarune	there is porn that exists that isn't totally absurd
2016-09-09 16:08:26	+meskarune	yeah, I mean, it can be hard to find
2016-09-09 16:08:32	+meskarune	I'll def give you that
2016-09-09 16:09:39	+meskarune	I think its probably easier to find fairer depictions in erotic fiction
2016-09-09 16:09:55	+e|m|c	It probably is yeah
2016-09-09 16:11:56	+meskarune	I can understand why a guy might be attracted to the idea of women being together. If they are straight and not attracted to men, they probably prefer to only see naked women.
2016-09-09 16:12:04	+meskarune	but it gets super problematic :/
2016-09-09 16:12:16	+meskarune	because dudes harrass lesbians in rl
2016-09-09 16:12:28	+e|m|c	I dunno. I used to just use the thumb trick.
2016-09-09 16:12:30	+meskarune	and watch super unrealistic "lesbian" porn that just caters to men
2016-09-09 16:13:00	+elky	the "2 lesbians and a guy in a threesome" trope for example
2016-09-09 16:13:24	+meskarune	like, in fake lesbian porn I have seen the women go down on dildos and it makes no damn sense
2016-09-09 16:13:35	+e|m|c	Lol
2016-09-09 16:13:38	+meskarune	why would a lesiban give a blow job to a dildo?
2016-09-09 16:13:46	+meskarune	there is literally no reason to do that
2016-09-09 16:13:54	+e|m|c	It's an ancient question.
2016-09-09 16:13:57	+meskarune	or when they have giant nails
2016-09-09 16:14:10	+e|m|c	Lesbians with giant nails?
2016-09-09 16:14:10	+meskarune	and I wonder how the reciever isn't scratched to hell
2016-09-09 16:14:14	+e|m|c	Oh right
2016-09-09 16:15:06	+elky	it's like a rule in terrible porn or something that the women must have dangerously long nails

2016-09-09 20:38:28	+Avani	If women gender police other women, it would be incorrect to call that "sexism", right?
2016-09-09 20:38:41	+Avani	I guess it sort of falls under respectability politics. 
2016-09-09 20:40:01	+elky	yes to both really
2016-09-09 20:40:37	+glass|	i think it's sexism still?
2016-09-09 20:40:43	+glass|	you could call it internalized sexism
2016-09-09 20:40:49	+glass|	respectability politics is something more specific
2016-09-09 20:40:50	+elky	er, yes it's sexism, yes it's respectability politics based on internalised sexism
2016-09-09 20:40:57	+Avani	Aah oki
2016-09-09 20:41:01	+elky	sorry it's late eyes bluured the "incorrect"
2016-09-09 20:42:42	+glass|	respectability politics is basically when you say "yeah you should be allowed to do that, but it makes us look bad so don't"
2016-09-09 20:44:38	+glass|	an example would be "nobinary genders are too complicated for cis people to accept right now. let's tone it down and get them to except binary trans people first"
2016-09-09 20:44:38		[20:44]
2016-09-09 20:44:44	+glass|	nonbinary(
2016-09-09 20:44:46	+glass|	**
2016-09-09 20:45:08	+glass|	throwing other marginalized people under the bus because you think your issue is more important
2016-09-09 20:45:52	 *	Avani nods
2016-09-09 20:45:57	+glass|	it might seem like the "practical" thing to do, and you might think it's for the greater good
2016-09-09 20:46:02	+glass|	but it tears our communities apart
2016-09-09 20:46:07	+glass|	and our enemies use it as a tool to tear us apart
2016-09-09 20:46:12	 *	Avani nods
2016-09-09 20:46:14	+glass|	if we give in we are exploitable.
2016-09-09 20:47:05	+glass|	so respectability politics isn't the same thing as any particular axis of discrimination/marginalization
2016-09-09 20:47:15	+glass|	often it will be along a different axis or related axis
2016-09-09 20:47:21	+glass|	like transness vs nonbinaryness
2016-09-09 20:47:37	+glass|	did I get that right?
2016-09-09 20:47:46	+DrYucatan	yeah, you gave a fine explanation 
2016-09-09 20:47:51	+DrYucatan	very good :)
2016-09-09 20:48:54	 *	Avani nods
2016-09-09 20:49:19	+Avani	so "brush your hair properly - be womanly (or you're representing women)" << that's also respectability politics, right? (which also can also be  racist depending on whom it's directed at)
2016-09-09 20:49:33	<--	raijin (~raijin@unaffiliated/raijin) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2016-09-09 20:49:58	+glass|	it depends what the intent is
2016-09-09 20:50:13	+glass|	if the intent is just "because women should appear womenly" then it's normal sexism
2016-09-09 20:50:29	+glass|	it's respectability politics if the intent is "so we can focus on the more important issue of wage discrimination"
2016-09-09 20:50:39	+glass|	it doesn't matter who the speaker is
2016-09-09 20:51:40	+Avani	so who the speaker is might only make a difference of oppression vs internalized oppression, I guess?
2016-09-09 20:52:12	+Avani	like elky mentioned "internalized sexism"
2016-09-09 20:52:14	+glass|	yeah
2016-09-09 20:53:38	+elky	at its heart respectability politics is the  people of the oppressed class doing enforcement for the oppressor
2016-09-09 20:54:29	 *	Avani nods
2016-09-09 20:56:36	+Avani	glass|: oh sorry you mentioned internalized sexism too. 
2016-09-09 21:00:41	+glass|	something i think is an example of respectability politics is when it is insisted that LGBT people and particularly trans people do not have a choice in being how they are
2016-09-09 21:00:41		[21:00]
2016-09-09 21:01:00	+glass|	it's harmful to trans people who feel like they are choosing to be trans and feel invalidated
2016-09-09 21:01:31	+glass|	and it's said to make us seem less "culpable" to cis oppressors: "we should be allowed to transition as we have no other choice"
2016-09-09 21:01:44	+glass|	but transition isn't something wrong in the first place
2016-09-09 21:01:48	 *	Avani nods
2016-09-09 21:01:55	+glass|	so you should be allowed to whether or not you have a choice
2016-09-09 21:02:35	+Avani	Same would go for "science" arguments for whether you should or shouldn't be allowed to do something
2016-09-09 21:04:37	+Avani	I guess it doesn't matter what the purported reason is.
2016-09-09 21:05:13	+Avani	With the exception of being allowed to harm other people. 
2016-09-09 21:06:19	+ferret_tails	it's pretty normal for abusers to groom their victims into enforcing their own power over them
2016-09-09 21:06:26	+ferret_tails	... pretty much the same thing on a societal level, I think
2016-09-09 21:07:10	 *	glass| chose to be trans
2016-09-09 21:07:26	 *	Avani chose to be trans
2016-09-09 21:07:40	+ferret_tails	I guess I chose to be trans, too
2016-09-09 21:07:51	+ferret_tails	definitely happier with myself right now <3
2016-09-09 21:07:55	+Avani	<3
2016-09-09 21:08:35	+ferret_tails	I mean... it's not like I just woke up one day and decided "holy crap I can be trans?! shit yes! let's do it!" and then the next day I came out to half my class
2016-09-09 21:08:44	+ferret_tails	(I lie: that's /exactly/ what happened)

2016-09-11 09:33:40	+leah	hello
2016-09-11 09:34:28	+leah	anyway, I presented as a male ally to the feminist last year. I don't know why I stopped lurking here tbh. I came out as trans a few months ago
2016-09-11 09:34:28		[09:34]
2016-09-11 09:34:54	+leah	just want to say, it feels really good to use IRC and not feel like a total joke
2016-09-11 09:36:18	+leah	there was another "safe space" that treated my horribly, and then I was thinking where else can I go to lurk in a place filled with somewhat likeminded people. then I remembered this place just now :)
2016-09-11 09:42:00		[09:36]
2016-09-11 09:42:59	+leah	it's so liberating to be who I am and not worry about anything, and best of all, the person who I despite from the other place doesn't seem to be here
2016-09-11 09:43:12	 *	leah will lurk. sorry for the rant

2016-09-11 21:50:11	+Layliah	Now, this is a really interesting discussion. I'm kinda late.
2016-09-11 21:50:39	+Layliah	The more I've been looking into the whole Trump v Clinton thing the more questions it raises if that makes sense.
2016-09-11 21:51:55	+Layliah	Someone said that Trump represents elements of the bourgeoisie and I'm seeing more of that with Clinton than Trump. Don't misunderstand me because I am in no way trying to say anything good about Trump.
2016-09-11 21:51:55		[21:51]
2016-09-11 21:52:54	+Layliah	But, I don't trust Clinton to actually work for equality, certainly not more than Sanders probably would have and I do find myself questioning her motives a lot. 
2016-09-11 21:54:07	+hyperstition	Laykiah i think trump represents some elements of the national bourgeoisie but above all the petit bourgeoisie and some skilled white workers

2016-09-11 21:54:54	+hyperstition	Layliah but yeah clinton is definitely not politically radical
2016-09-11 21:55:54	+Layliah	Not at all, and it pains me that she'll be the first woman to be President. I think more than anything else she'll follow the corporatist agenda and something will happen that will make people question whether or not a woman can be president again

2016-09-11 22:00:12	+hyperstition	exceot with coopted feminist rhetoric
2016-09-11 22:00:40	+Layliah	Well, the think with Obama is that I know he definitely has a repressed radical inside of him somewhere. It's something you can see really well in his books.
2016-09-11 22:00:59	+Layliah	And I think that stops him from doing a lot more of that agenda that he *could* do.
2016-09-11 22:01:42	+Avani	I'd think most people who question whether or not a woman can be president after will prolly do it independent of whether Clinton becomes president
2016-09-11 22:02:19	+Layliah	See I don't know about that, call it optimism but I think that a lot of people would just accept it if she did a good job.
2016-09-11 22:02:33	+Layliah	Most people who aren't just terrible at least
2016-09-11 22:03:49	+Avani	Though tbh I also think right now, there's just a lot of not-trump votes that go to Clinton, and that a lot of those are "oh no, why a woman? but ok, still not as bad as trump"
2016-09-11 22:04:06	+Layliah	I was just about to say something along those line
2016-09-11 22:07:09	+Avani	I'm also not so convinced that a radical left president can actually be able to put much of that in practice if elected. (I don't think Sanders counts as radical left - just more left of center than Clinton)
2016-09-11 22:07:09		[22:07]
2016-09-11 22:07:51	+hyperstition	right
2016-09-11 22:08:01	+Layliah	You're absolutely right, but there is something to be said about anyone who can shift the overton window further to the left. The biggest thing with Sanders would be him trying to get money out of politics.
2016-09-11 22:08:02	+hyperstition	its a question of the structure
2016-09-11 22:08:15	+Layliah	Because as president he absolutely *could* do it without congress
2016-09-11 22:08:28	 *	Avani nods
2016-09-11 22:08:43	+Layliah	But, that's just a pipe dream at this point.
2016-09-11 22:09:02	+Avani	Mhm
2016-09-11 22:09:18	+hyperstition	idk i think money out of politics is mostly irrelevant msterislly
2016-09-11 22:09:50	+hyperstition	if snything it preserves the american state
2016-09-11 22:10:01	+Layliah	I can't agree with you there. It might be the most relevant thing to every other issue.
2016-09-11 22:10:54	+Layliah	There would be more money in supporting marginalized people rather than have all of the money come from just white people on a grand scale, but that's not something we see happening on a national level
2016-09-11 22:11:28	+Layliah	And a big part of that would be that the biggest corporations would have to share it with other people, let alone other marginalized people
2016-09-11 22:12:47	 *	Avani nods
2016-09-11 22:13:03	+hyperstition	i think it presents the bourgeoos state as something good that has been corrupted
2016-09-11 22:13:20	+Avani	It's tempting to say... in the long run, it doesn't change much - but fact is, it changes a lot in the short run. It affects people's lives today.
2016-09-11 22:13:48	+hyperstition	and if only we get rid of this corruption we will be able to restore a lost equality that we once had
2016-09-11 22:14:37	+Layliah	That leads me to a point where I find myself succumbing to my own fears: Can we actually do it?
2016-09-11 22:14:43	+Avani	hyperstition: sure. But trying for that doesn't have to (and imo shouldn't) ignore the ground reality for marginalised people today.
2016-09-11 22:15:30	+Avani	Layliah: I'm an anarchist. I don't think we can do it within the current broken representative democratic system. But yes, I think we can do it.
2016-09-11 22:16:00	+Avani	It's gonna be a while, though. And I might not be alive to see that change.
2016-09-11 22:16:32	+hyperstition	Avani i agree, but i dont see howgetting money out of politics changes anything dor marginalized people
2016-09-11 22:16:36	+Layliah	That's just it, if it can be done we can't do it alone. Sanders not winning should show how deep things run, but the fact that he got so close is what makes me hopeful.
2016-09-11 22:17:31	+Layliah	hyperstition: Once you get money out of politics it opens up the door to social change.
2016-09-11 22:18:17	+Avani	I'd say social change has to run in parallel. Getting money out of politics can only fuel it and change how effective it is
2016-09-11 22:18:25	+Layliah	But until that happens big corporations will tell the government what to do, and even if the whole country were socially one way or another nothing could change as a result of the sheer dominating control that the rich have over the government.
2016-09-11 22:19:04	+hyperstition	i think the government does that due to how its structured
2016-09-11 22:19:11	+hyperstition	its not neutral
2016-09-11 22:21:06	+Layliah	Well, I like to think that there was a period in time where the government's strucutre did work. The question is whether or not that broke down because the world fundamentally changed but our government didn't change with it, or because money gained too much power over government.

2016-09-11 22:21:33	+Layliah	I mean could you imagine slavery being abolished if the government had been the way it is now?
2016-09-11 22:22:45	+Avani	Fighting hard and revolting to get things changed - I don't think that's a sign of a government structure that worked, but rather a sign that revolutions can lead to change
2016-09-11 22:22:45		[22:22]
2016-09-11 22:23:03	+Avani	which worked /despite/ the broken government structures, often
2016-09-11 22:23:50	+Avani	also, it's important to understand what 'works' means, and to whom
2016-09-11 22:24:06	+hyperstition	the government, the state, isnt the field of struggle
2016-09-11 22:24:34	+hyperstition	rsther it is a means, a tool, of those opposed to us
2016-09-11 22:26:55	+Layliah	That's just not a position I can take, maybe because it's been beaten into me over however many years of school, but I believe that the government is fundamentally designed to be for the people and I have to believe that there's enough good in our fellow humans to actually take control of it back and do things for the good of everyone.
2016-09-11 22:27:19	+Layliah	If nothing else, I think it's an idea that will resonate with 'regular people' a lot more.

2016-09-11 22:29:12	+Avani	Unfortunately, the government upholds the rights of the privileged at the cost of the marginalised. When it grants rights to the marginalised, it's often because denying those rights isn't sustainable.
2016-09-11 22:29:19	+hyperstition	Layliah i think it definitely is palatable, but its also ultimstely dangrrous
2016-09-11 22:29:31	+hyperstition	right

2016-09-11 22:29:53	+hyperstition	for instance the 8 hour work day was the result of immense struggle
2016-09-11 22:30:01	+hyperstition	same with universal suffrage
2016-09-11 22:30:03	+Avani	:) Thanks. And thanks for the discussion as well!
2016-09-11 22:30:24	+Layliah	Absolutely! I don't get to have conversations like this a lot
2016-09-11 22:32:15	+Layliah	hyperstition: At the same time though, the fact that it can happen I think shows where revolution and the current state must meet each other half-way. It took a ton for everything to happen, but the fact that it can still happen is what gives me hope. The system is not so broken to the point where it can't be fixed, albeit slowly.
2016-09-11 22:32:59	+speak	hyperstition: Yeah, the 8 hour work day was the result of immense struggle, and people also fought against it when it first was introduced
2016-09-11 22:33:09	+hyperstition	well its not broken, it works, it just doesnt do whst we want it to do

2016-09-11 22:34:34	+hyperstition	think of the founding genocide in america, for instance
2016-09-11 22:34:39	+Layliah	It's like trying to do surgery. One wrong move and you've got a massive problem

2016-09-13 06:33:55	+yar	the phrasing of the article sort of reminds me of when i've tried to co-write things with dudes about politics and the things they write end up seeming way more simplistic and awkward than i would have liked
2016-09-13 06:34:47	+yar	like going through the motions but something's missing
2016-09-13 06:38:19	+yar	i guess i'd call it mimicry, which can turn into unintentional mockery

2016-09-13 06:50:58	+Peng	The (top) comments weren't really bad. 10% men going "well, actually" and 90% people laughing at them and posting memes.
2016-09-13 06:51:14	+Peng	It was entertainingly bad, not just gross.

2016-09-13 17:25:04	@AUTOMATRON	Hey, winsoff, check out the channel's rules: http://freenode-feminism.github.io/
2016-09-13 17:25:11	+winsoff	Don't tell me what to do, robot.
2016-09-13 17:25:23	+winsoff	Don't address me in jovial tones, either. You're just a damned robot.
2016-09-13 17:25:34	+yar	hi winsoff, what brings you here?
2016-09-13 17:25:47	+winsoff	yar, being banned from ##politics, obviously. This is the appeal channel, right?
2016-09-13 17:26:06	+yar	no
2016-09-13 17:26:19	+winsoff	That was the joke.
2016-09-13 17:27:14	+yar	did you read the rules?

2016-09-13 17:27:40	+winsoff	I did indeed. It didn't say "NO FUN ALLOWED"
2016-09-13 17:27:51	+turbo64	kunwon1 went off on one of his racist tirades and banned me when i argued with him
2016-09-13 17:27:53	+winsoff	I figured that being fun was a sign of camaraderie.
2016-09-13 17:28:04	+winsoff	lol, say what turbo64
2016-09-13 17:28:48	+yar	i'm not in ##politics so i won't get any jokes about it
2016-09-13 17:29:00	+turbo64	i think hes like one of those libertarian wing nuts who thinks the politically correct liberal agenda is destroying the white race
2016-09-13 17:29:03	+winsoff	It wasn't about ##politics; it was an absurdist appeal to humor.
2016-09-13 17:29:17	+winsoff	turbo64, are you saying liberal in the social liberal sense
2016-09-13 17:29:26	+turbo64	that channel seems to attract the fringe people
2016-09-13 17:29:40	+turbo64	liberal in the snarl word sense
2016-09-13 17:30:02	+turbo64	where it doesnt really mean anything
2016-09-13 17:30:06	+yar	the US american right wing word for anyone to the left of them
2016-09-13 17:30:14	+winsoff	That channel has plenty of marxists in it, turbo64
2016-09-13 17:30:24	+winsoff	yar, don't generalize like that
2016-09-13 17:30:29	+winsoff	it's hilariously oppressive
2016-09-13 17:30:32	+yar	what is
2016-09-13 17:30:46	+winsoff	To generalize the idea of "US american right wing"
2016-09-13 17:30:52	+yar	why
2016-09-13 17:31:00	+yar	who am i oppressing
2016-09-13 17:31:04	+winsoff	Because it is generally wrong, and you're just doing what they're doing.
2016-09-13 17:31:12	+winsoff	You're removing their individuality and personality
2016-09-13 17:31:21	+winsoff	that's the primary mode of oppression
2016-09-13 17:31:22	+winsoff	and it's not welcome
2016-09-13 17:31:24	+turbo64	the right wing in america has become like an absurd parody of itself
2016-09-13 17:31:45	+winsoff	turbo64, no, media groups just like to play with the loudmouths
2016-09-13 17:31:52	+yar	i'm not really generalizing. saying it's a right wing word doesn't say everyone uses that word that way
2016-09-13 17:32:38	+yar	any more than calling it a US american word generalizes about americans
2016-09-13 17:32:50	+winsoff	That is the direct implication.  You used "US american" (redundant?) "right wing" as if every member that could be described as right-wing says the word "liberal" in that context.
2016-09-13 17:33:20	+winsoff	It's not hard to be specific with your experiences. Generalizing beyond your experience is the source of these problematic generalizations.
2016-09-13 17:33:29	+yar	it's just enough information to disambiguate from the other common meanings of liberal - the leftist ones and the ones in other countries
2016-09-13 17:33:46	+winsoff	It's not enough information--it's a direct lack and nebulation of information
2016-09-13 17:34:00	+winsoff	It's also not limited to the US
2016-09-13 17:34:04	+turbo64	the left always seems to win in america, one way or another
2016-09-13 17:34:10	+winsoff	turbo64, lol
2016-09-13 17:34:19	+winsoff	It's foolish to see politics as right-left
2016-09-13 17:34:30	+winsoff	we don't live in the 1800s or france
2016-09-13 17:34:34	+yar	alright i think you've spent just enough energy sticking up for the individuality of right wingers. move along now
2016-09-13 17:34:38	+winsoff	and france wasn't the epitome of politics
2016-09-13 17:34:51	+turbo64	well it really just comes down to people who want progress and people who want things to go back the way they were
2016-09-13 17:35:02	+winsoff	yar, everyone deserves individuality; it's the basis of our beliefs as feminists of any form 
2016-09-13 17:35:18	+winsoff	turbo64, bad way to see it. They both want progress
2016-09-13 17:35:18	+yar	what form of feminist are you
2016-09-13 17:35:21	+Peng	turbo64: Sometimes the way things were, sometimes how they pretend they were.
2016-09-13 17:35:36	+winsoff	yar, depends on the issue. I believe in praxis.
2016-09-13 17:35:44	+winsoff	Peng, exactly what I was implying.
2016-09-13 17:35:57	+winsoff	They both want progress, but toward different goals.
2016-09-13 17:36:12	+winsoff	It's false advertising to say it is "going back to the way things used to be."
2016-09-13 17:36:43	+turbo64	well their slogan is "make america great again"
2016-09-13 17:36:47	+turbo64	thats kind of a dead giveaway isnt it
2016-09-13 17:36:50	+winsoff	"their"
2016-09-13 17:36:53	+winsoff	the fuck are you talking about
2016-09-13 17:37:09	+winsoff	Please don't make me repeat myself and at least try to act like you read what I said
2016-09-13 17:37:27	+turbo64	im just gonna hit the ejector seat on this conversation
2016-09-13 17:38:04	+winsoff	Why? If this is a common behavior, we will only come back to this point. Is it that hard to be specific about which groups you are thinking about?
2016-09-13 17:38:06	+yar	winsoff: back off. this is an official warning.
2016-09-13 17:38:19	+winsoff	yar, don't approach me like that, and you have a deal
2016-09-13 17:38:26	+yar	like what?
2016-09-13 17:38:37	+winsoff	No one takes kindly to power trips in that manner.

2016-09-13 17:39:06	+yar	your behavior in this channel right now isn't okay
2016-09-13 17:39:18	+winsoff	yar, let's be specific. What about my behavior is unsettling you?
2016-09-13 17:39:34	+winsoff	I responded to your extreme vitriol with a stern defense of my humanity.
2016-09-13 17:39:57	+winsoff	I'm not your target, and that's why I don't understand your anger in the first place.

2016-09-13 17:40:24	+winsoff	wushin, lol, as if you want to get assaulted in public
2016-09-13 17:40:27	+yar	you're cursing at people for not being thoughtful enough towards right wingers while showing an ironic lack of understanding of the things we're saying
2016-09-13 17:40:51	+winsoff	yar, cursing at someone isn't the same as saying "the fuck." That's a personal usage of a swear, and is not calling someone a curse whatsoever.
2016-09-13 17:40:56	+wushin	idk, I see everyone else wearing them in my hood
2016-09-13 17:41:00	+winsoff	And I didn't have any context with "RIGHT WINGERS"
2016-09-13 17:41:18	+yar	you've got a major empathy gap here. so much so fast, that it risks making this channel unsafe for its target audience, which is why i'm putting on a mod hat now
2016-09-13 17:41:27	+winsoff	You're twisting this all up, and I can see how, if you weren't reading and instead were attacking me, which you did the moment I entered the room.
2016-09-13 17:41:43	+winsoff	No, you've got the empathy gap. You've treated me like cock since I got here.

2016-09-14 07:24:56	+annevk	My partner faces some sexism at work where the rationale some folks give for not many women being in upper management is likely due to different lifestyle choices (i.e., be home for kids). She got this in response to saying that the goal for going from 11% to 15% "diversity" in the next four years wasn't all that much. She isn't sure how to respond to people

2016-09-14 07:45:43	+annevk	When you start with "having the risk of being hated ina seconds" it's kinda telling
2016-09-14 07:45:55	+GorillaWarfare	Between "I don't see color", "I have black family", and "racism against white people", that person really ticked the boxes
2016-09-14 07:45:59	+wushin	yerp, it's like starting with "I'm not racist but"
2016-09-14 07:46:39	+yar	anyway, sorry that distracted from your question annevk 
2016-09-14 07:46:48	+GorillaWarfare	Aaanyhoo
2016-09-14 07:46:55	 *	GorillaWarfare scrolls back up to annevk's question
2016-09-14 07:47:38	+GorillaWarfare	It might be worth pushing back on why their choices are somehow incompatible with upper management
2016-09-14 07:47:38		[07:47]
2016-09-14 07:48:00	+GorillaWarfare	Obviously if someone chooses to be a full-time parent, that's not going to work out
2016-09-14 07:48:15	+GorillaWarfare	But why can't upper management still have children and succeed in their job?
2016-09-14 07:48:28	+annevk	To be clear, I did look through the geekfeminism wiki, but I couldn't find a good link about debating feminism with coworkers
2016-09-14 07:48:56	+hyperstition	there is of course agitation
2016-09-14 07:49:00	+annevk	Yeah, but even the assumptions that women somehow have different life goals seems like it's worthy of addressing to some extent
2016-09-14 07:49:11	+GorillaWarfare	And are they really saying that they're considering a well-balanced group of folks, and all of these women really can't be in upper management for reasons like that?
2016-09-14 07:49:40	+GorillaWarfare	annevk: Yeah, are they saying "well I want to stop working and be at home with my children" or are the hiring folks just assuming that women will eventually have kids and leave the workforce?
2016-09-14 07:50:43	+annevk	GorillaWarfare: I think it's the coworker assuming that
2016-09-14 07:51:07	+GorillaWarfare	Ah, I see
2016-09-14 07:51:14	+annevk	GorillaWarfare: for more context, we're in Switzerland, and it's not really progressive here
2016-09-14 07:51:34	+wushin	The inverse of the Mom argument is also sexist, that a Dad would never stay at home and give up their job.
2016-09-14 07:51:52	+wushin	Like Dad's can't be caretakers, WTF!
2016-09-14 07:52:14	+GorillaWarfare	Yeah, I'm American and don't know much about Swiss social issues
2016-09-14 07:52:22	+GorillaWarfare	There are perhaps people here who would know more?
2016-09-14 07:52:45	+DrYucatan	Oh lord
2016-09-14 07:52:50	+DrYucatan	HeXiled PMed me
2016-09-14 07:53:33	+GorillaWarfare	But I think I would perhaps push back that that giant gap is completely due to choice
2016-09-14 07:54:10	+GorillaWarfare	Consider also that this works both ways, too
2016-09-14 07:54:54	+DrYucatan	"i was actually in the will to help. I am in favor of feminism and prefer feminists. But it seems that here is all about hate the other gender. The reason why i asked about if she was union is because i may be able to offer some solutions"
2016-09-14 07:54:55	+DrYucatan	lol
2016-09-14 07:54:59	+GorillaWarfare	If companies routinely aren't promoting women because of this, then if a cishet couple has to choose one person to stay home with the kids, this can add additional pressure for it to be the woman
2016-09-14 07:55:39	+GorillaWarfare	So on the face of it it may seem to be the woman's choice, etc.
2016-09-14 07:55:52	+annevk	Yeah, I guess pointing out the wide gap again is a good start
2016-09-14 07:56:34	+wushin	DrYucatan wow, caps it off with some mansplaing

2016-09-14 12:43:57	+ferret_tails	... and I remember living for over a decade without a diagnosis
2016-09-14 12:44:07	+Wonder_Woman	Like a guy who said he was hearing impared but all the hearing tests were normal and would join support groups and crap when they could hear just fine and didn't have disability from it
2016-09-14 12:44:40	+ferret_tails	and I /still/ don't have a diagnosis for my chronic pain
2016-09-14 12:44:46	+Wonder_Woman	ferret_tails: yeah, I currently don't have a diagnosis for the genetic disease I have becuase I can't afford genetic testing
2016-09-14 12:44:48	+ferret_tails	... mostly because I'm a woman and because I'm fat
2016-09-14 12:45:06	+ferret_tails	Wonder_Woman: so... you're throwing rocks from the roof of your glass house, in other words
2016-09-14 12:45:10	+Wonder_Woman	but i don't go around telling people I have EDS or Mediteraenean fever or whatever
2016-09-14 12:45:27	+Wonder_Woman	they are on the list of things it could be, but I don't claim to have them
2016-09-14 12:45:48	+Wonder_Woman	ferret_tails: my point is that people should clain to have specific diseases
2016-09-14 12:46:00	+Wonder_Woman	you can be sick without a diagnosis
2016-09-14 12:46:13	+ferret_tails	okay... let's be honest for a moment: at least half of the people you're talking about are claiming psychiatric diagnoses
2016-09-14 12:46:31	+Wonder_Woman	but there are also people who blog post about having diseases they don't actually have for attention
2016-09-14 12:46:44	+SaturnAmy	yeah but
2016-09-14 12:46:47	+SaturnAmy	that's not what self-diagnosage is
2016-09-14 12:46:54	+SaturnAmy	it's not the essence of it
2016-09-14 12:46:55	+ferret_tails	^ exactly
2016-09-14 12:47:04	+SaturnAmy	it's a seperate thing
2016-09-14 12:47:16	+SaturnAmy	people /with/ a diagnosis can do that just as inappropriately
2016-09-14 12:47:18	+Wonder_Woman	self diagnosis is when a person diagnoses themselves with a disease without any medical evidence to support that
2016-09-14 12:47:38	+Wonder_Woman	it covers people who do a ton of research adn people who grab stuff off web-md
2016-09-14 12:48:04	+SaturnAmy	and yeah
2016-09-14 12:48:08	+SaturnAmy	this started on mental illness
2016-09-14 12:48:22	+SaturnAmy	which is a very different situation
2016-09-14 12:49:11	+Wonder_Woman	how is that different?
2016-09-14 12:49:31	+Wonder_Woman	people self diagnosing mental illness, its similar to physical illness
2016-09-14 12:50:13	+Wonder_Woman	its important to do research and push for tests for something you think you have to get treatment, but its never ok to say you have something when it hasn't been diagnosed
2016-09-14 12:51:19	+Wonder_Woman	but to me, its fine to say "I have XYZ issues and I think I might have this diagnosis but I haven't been officially diagnosed yet"
2016-09-14 12:51:37	+Wonder_Woman	it just seems super misrepresentative

2016-09-14 13:02:40	+Wonder_Woman	ferret_tails: there are sets of symptoms that match certain diagnosis and a dr should be able to objectively look at you and figure out the correct one

2016-09-14 13:04:44	+SaturnAmy	^^
2016-09-14 13:04:59	+ferret_tails	because you'll be able to read/interact with other people like yourself and learn strategies for adapting better

2016-09-14 13:06:56	+SaturnAmy	Wonder_Woman, I say it all the time

2016-09-14 13:08:14	+SaturnAmy	...because I needed antidepressants
2016-09-14 13:08:25	+SaturnAmy	which I only got after several years
2016-09-14 13:08:28	+SaturnAmy	because psych refused to diagnose me

2016-09-14 13:08:45	+SaturnAmy	fuck 'em
2016-09-14 13:09:13	+ferret_tails	because sometimes you need to document disability for formal accommodations
2016-09-14 13:09:28	+ferret_tails	because sometimes you want  to try psychoactive medications
2016-09-14 13:09:30	+hyperstition	i self-diagnosed with adhd when i wss 15 but have a formal diagnosis of narcolepsy because its the only way i couls get medication
2016-09-14 13:09:37	+Wonder_Woman	ok, so if you get officially diagnosed, you can get drugs, financial support, social support online and offline
2016-09-14 13:09:47	+Wonder_Woman	but the downside is dealing with doctors

2016-09-14 13:24:07	+turbo64	[18:10] -NickServ- You are now identified for turbo64.
2016-09-14 13:24:12	+yar	ok, you weren't before
2016-09-14 13:24:23	+turbo64	oh
2016-09-14 13:24:49	+turbo64	anyway i have experience with being crazy and ive been in mental hospitals before and dealt with therapists/meds/etc.
2016-09-14 13:25:25	+turbo64	and one thing i learned is its hard to deal with it on your own and self-diagnose and all that
2016-09-14 13:25:46	+yar	it's ok to share your experience as long as you don't act like it negates somebody else's experience
2016-09-14 13:25:57	+turbo64	yeah i feel that
2016-09-14 13:26:04	+yar	probably best to stick to "i" statements here
2016-09-14 13:27:20	+turbo64	therapy gives me perspective because its really hard to understand myself when all i have to go on is my own inner thoughts and feelings
2016-09-14 13:27:43	+turbo64	but finding a good therapist and/or the right meds can be pretty frustrating
2016-09-14 13:28:10	+ferret_tails	Wonder_Woman: you're being very ableist to be quite blunt...
2016-09-14 13:28:10		[13:28]
2016-09-14 13:28:15	+turbo64	a lot of therapists/psychiatrists are dumb or they're just not right for you
2016-09-14 13:28:16	<--	RumpledElf (~rumpledel@drupal.org/user/173054/view) has quit (Quit: My Mac has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
2016-09-14 13:28:49	+ferret_tails	turbo64: hey... how about we avoid the ableist slurs
2016-09-14 13:29:01	+ferret_tails	'dumb'
2016-09-14 13:32:36	+turbo64	the worst thing you can do is self-medicate, i can tell you that from personal experience
2016-09-14 13:33:02	+yar	again with the "i" statements
2016-09-14 13:33:04	+yar	it's really important
2016-09-14 13:34:00	+Wonder_Woman	ferret_tails: could you explain what is ableist? Its not my intention.
2016-09-14 13:34:29	+Wonder_Woman	I woudl like to avoid it in the future if I have said something to put people down
2016-09-14 13:34:32	+yar	Wonder_Woman: the word 'dumb' is ableist
2016-09-14 13:35:16	+Wonder_Woman	I don't think I said that
2016-09-14 13:35:46	+Peng	Wonder_Woman: You didn't. Someone else did.
2016-09-14 13:36:10	+yar	oh, there are two different threads happening, sorry
2016-09-14 13:36:16	+turbo64	oof
2016-09-14 13:36:37	+Wonder_Woman	well ferret_tails pinged my nick about ablism and I don't know what exactly they are refering to
2016-09-14 13:36:52	+turbo64	i dont have the mental dexterity to navigate through this field of eggshells
2016-09-14 13:38:08	+turbo64	im just gonna stay out of this conversation
2016-09-14 13:40:33	+ferret_tails	Wonder_Woman: the idea that self-diagnosis, particularly psychiatric self-DX is wrong or dangerous is ableist
2016-09-14 13:40:55	+ferret_tails	and since we're sticking to 'I' statements...
2016-09-14 13:41:35	+ferret_tails	I went from using professionally prescribed medications to self-medicating and I'm doing a hell of a lot better so...

2016-09-14 13:42:29	+ferret_tails	also... the idea that disabled people can't be authorities regarding their own experiences unless a doctor gives them the go-ahead is also ableist
2016-09-14 13:43:00	+ferret_tails	I mean... sure... if someone was like "I have liver cancer" as a self-DX then maybe questions should be raised
2016-09-14 13:43:09	+ferret_tails	but psychiatric diagnoses are nothing more than syndromes on a checklist
2016-09-14 13:43:14	+ferret_tails	that's /all/ they are
2016-09-14 13:43:14		[13:43]
2016-09-14 13:43:20	+ferret_tails	and even physical syndromes
2016-09-14 13:43:34	+ferret_tails	there are entire swaths of the population that are disenfranchised
2016-09-14 13:44:03	+ferret_tails	fat people, people of color, and women (especially when intersectionalized) have a very, very, very hard time getting any chronic pain diagnoses
2016-09-14 13:44:19	+turbo64	i self-medicated for a few years
2016-09-14 13:44:23	+turbo64	unfortunately the medication was heroin
2016-09-14 13:44:48	+turbo64	so i have kind of a bias towards that sort of thing
2016-09-14 13:44:50	+ferret_tails	turbo64: pain?
2016-09-14 13:44:54	+ferret_tails	chronic pain
2016-09-14 13:45:19	+ferret_tails	... because people with chronic pain self-med with heroin /for a reason/
2016-09-14 13:45:38	+ferret_tails	and that reason is because you can't get adequate treatment for chronic pain if you're in any way marginalized to save your life
2016-09-14 13:45:40	+yar	doctors have too much power over disabled people. that's ableism. trying to justify an ableist system is ableist
2016-09-14 13:47:29	+turbo64	that's not ableism at all
2016-09-14 13:47:44	+turbo64	people choosing to seek professional help from someone who has a degree in medicine and years of experience
2016-09-14 13:49:11	+yar	"choosing" is one thing, but saying everybody should, or denying the many negative experiences people have had, is another thing
2016-09-14 13:49:47	+turbo64	i dont think its ableist to say that people with illnesses should seek help from a professional
2016-09-14 13:50:32	+yar	in a fantasy world where that's all doctors are - professionals with years of experience - maybe not
2016-09-14 13:50:48	+yar	but in this world doctors are more than that. they have the power to fuck you up
2016-09-14 13:50:58	+Wonder_Woman	ferret_tails: I said people shouldn't misrepresent themselves with a diagnosed disease because it can hurt communities, I never said self diagnosis is always bad
2016-09-14 13:51:09	+Wonder_Woman	but I can see how I might have come across that way
2016-09-14 13:51:51	+turbo64	there's bad doctors but most of the time its a good idea to listen to a doctor
2016-09-14 13:51:56	+Wonder_Woman	I do think that if people are able to, they should try to get second opinions
2016-09-14 13:52:00	+turbo64	unless of course theyre a doctor of "natural medicine"
2016-09-14 13:52:05	+turbo64	in which case you should get the fuck out of there
2016-09-14 13:53:44	+Wonder_Woman	because sometimes you can get so caught up in yourself that its hard to see objectively, and having another person to talk to helps. Like if you have a friend who also agrees that you seem to have depression or a person with autism who thinks your symptoms could match the spectrum. It doesn't always have to be a doctor.
2016-09-14 13:53:46	+yar	if you find yourself backpedalling to "most of the time" it's probably a good idea to take a step back
2016-09-14 13:54:38	+Layliah	I try to look at self diagnosis in a sort of scientific sense. It's fine to form a hypothesis that way, but you should always follow up with a doctor for some kind of confirmation. A lot of things can look like other things. This is of course assuming you have a doctor that you trust.
2016-09-14 13:54:42	+yar	because that's kinda like moving the goalpost from "you're completely wrong" to "your experience is too rare to matter"
2016-09-14 13:58:01	+turbo64	denouncing the whole concept of professional psychiatry is really damaging to society because there are lots of people who need help and they don't get it because they don't trust doctors or they think its all bullshit
2016-09-14 13:59:29	+Layliah	Psychiatry is something I think that you should never go to just one doctor for. It's a very subjective field in a lot of ways, and in my personal experiences I've seen a lot who are more incentivized by things other than helping or just not incentivised to help enough.. 
2016-09-14 13:59:29		[13:59]
2016-09-14 13:59:29	+Wonder_Woman	ferret_tails: anyways, I'm sorry I wasn't more clear with what I said, but I never ever said that people need a doctors permision to be an authority on their own experience. I said the opposit in fact, that only the person themselves really knows their own body becuase no one else can feel what they feel.
2016-09-14 13:59:35	+turbo64	and they ignore their issues or they self-medicate by getting high/drunk and make things even worse for themselves
2016-09-14 14:00:30	+turbo64	Layliah: i agree
2016-09-14 14:01:19	+turbo64	it took me a while to find a psychiatrist that actually helped me
2016-09-14 14:02:02	+turbo64	not because all the others were incompetent but because with mental illness, the doctor-patient relationship is a lot more personal and more vital to the process and i just had to find one that could actually understand what was going on with me
2016-09-14 14:02:37	+Layliah	And I know what you mean too. I've got some things that I know I *should* go to see someone about, but I just can't bring myself to admit that there is a problem in that way. Part of it is over self-reliance and part of it is a distrust of psychiatrists in general. It has nothing to do with thinking they're inherently bad or anything, I don't know how to explain it, but I know it's probably bad that I do it.
2016-09-14 14:03:23	+turbo64	well a psychiatrists job is to just give you medication based on the information they get from your therapist
2016-09-14 14:03:33	+turbo64	so whats really important is finding a good therapist
2016-09-14 14:03:59	+Layliah	That's the step I can never really bring myself to make :/
2016-09-14 14:04:17	+turbo64	do you have a problem with "opening up" to them?
2016-09-14 14:05:05	+Layliah	It's really more the thought of being in that position makes me very uncomfortable.
2016-09-14 14:05:17	+turbo64	oh i see
2016-09-14 14:05:23	+turbo64	well thats normal, i feel that way too
2016-09-14 14:06:42	<--	fnstudio (~fabio@2.219.136.61) has quit (Quit: leaving)
2016-09-14 14:06:51	+turbo64	one therapist i saw was really cold and distant and overly clinical, another one was into homeopathic medicine and suggested acupuncture and a bunch of other nonsense
2016-09-14 14:07:34	+Layliah	Well, that... Those certainly are extremes
2016-09-14 14:07:34	+turbo64	but eventually i found one that actually helped, mostly becuase she was more focused on actually listening to me than just trying to give me advice
2016-09-14 14:07:37	+ferret_tails	well... psychiatry /is/ fundamentally violent
2016-09-14 14:07:48	+ferret_tails	and psychiatrists don't necessarily know what the hell they're doing
2016-09-14 14:08:01	+ferret_tails	like... the origins of psychiatry are /literally/ pseudoscience
2016-09-14 14:08:08	+Layliah	Yeah, that's what I meant about it being highly subjective
2016-09-14 14:08:15	+ferret_tails	Freudian analysis is pseudoscience
2016-09-14 14:08:21	+ferret_tails	it's actually worse than pseudoscience
2016-09-14 14:08:21	+turbo64	the origins of all science are pseudoscience
2016-09-14 14:08:26	+ferret_tails	it's harmful
2016-09-14 14:08:27	+turbo64	chemistry was born from alchemy
2016-09-14 14:08:48	+Layliah	There's a divide between psychology and neurology and a little bit of overlap that is kind of dangerous.
2016-09-14 14:08:49	+ferret_tails	okay... so let's talk about the transition from the psychoanalytic to the 'biological'
2016-09-14 14:09:01	+turbo64	anyway its really subjective, what works for one person doesnt work for someone else
2016-09-14 14:09:03	+ferret_tails	with the introduction of electroshock and lobotomy
2016-09-14 14:09:08	+Layliah	As much of an oxymoron as that was
2016-09-14 14:09:14	+turbo64	and theres no standard treatment for anything really
2016-09-14 14:09:54	+ferret_tails	you realize that lobotomy was based on the observations of a man who had his prefrontal cortex destroyed in a mining accident, right?
2016-09-14 14:10:02	+turbo64	even the names for mental illnesses are just ways to categorize a broad spectrum of different conditions
2016-09-14 14:10:03	+ferret_tails	... and the observation that it fundamentally changed his personality
2016-09-14 14:10:04	+Wonder_Woman	birth control pills also had a rather violent way of being created, as well as all of OB/GYN
2016-09-14 14:10:09	+Layliah	I was just thinking about lobotomy
2016-09-14 14:10:20	+Wonder_Woman	but it doesn't mean that modern birthcontrol shouldn't be used
2016-09-14 14:10:25	+ferret_tails	lobotomy wasn't designed to 'cure' anybody of anything
2016-09-14 14:10:34	+ferret_tails	it was designed to make 'difficult' people docile and easy to handle
2016-09-14 14:10:46	+Layliah	That was over-utilized in a period of time where the lines between neurology and psychology were far too blurred
2016-09-14 14:10:53	+ferret_tails	the man who invented the procedure performed it from the back of a fucking van
2016-09-14 14:11:16	+ferret_tails	he'd drive around the United States consulting with anyone and everyone who wanted their wife/child/parent lobotomized because they were being difficult and just... sorta did it
2016-09-14 14:11:31	+turbo64	ferret_tails: the same thing can be said for every other field of science - people were wrong about a lot of things
2016-09-14 14:11:57	+Wonder_Woman	ferret_tails: I think everyone agrees that it was horrible
2016-09-14 14:12:04	+Wonder_Woman	that isn't in dispute
2016-09-14 14:12:07	+ferret_tails	okay... but here's the thing: it hasn't really changed
2016-09-14 14:12:23	+Layliah	You're reminding me of an infamous Hitchcock film
2016-09-14 14:12:35	+turbo64	psychology has come a long way
2016-09-14 14:12:36	+ferret_tails	Layliah: excuse me?
2016-09-14 14:12:41	+ferret_tails	no... it hasn't
2016-09-14 14:12:46	+turbo64	its just a pretty new form of science compared to the others
2016-09-14 14:12:54	+turbo64	the human mind is pretty complicated stuff
2016-09-14 14:13:10	+Layliah	One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest? It's from 1975
2016-09-14 14:13:12	+ferret_tails	we just cause brain damage with massive doses of neuroleptics rather than swishing around a metal rod in someone's brain
2016-09-14 14:13:22	+Wonder_Woman	uh... the treatment of psyciatric patients and children has changed in a huge way in the last 50 years. Its not perfect, but it is a hell of a lot better now than it used to be.
2016-09-14 14:13:29	+ferret_tails	Layliah: yeah... I'll ask you to leave your asylum aesthetic at the door
2016-09-14 14:13:32	+Wonder_Woman	There are still lots of things that need to improve
2016-09-14 14:13:45	+Layliah	Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything like that
2016-09-14 14:13:49	+Wonder_Woman	but its isn't as bad as it was in the past
2016-09-14 14:14:24	+ferret_tails	really? from what I've experienced and what I've seen it is
2016-09-14 14:14:29	+ferret_tails	it's just sexed up to look non-violent
2016-09-14 14:14:29		[14:14]
2016-09-14 14:14:52	+Layliah	I'm just talking about a scene from the movie where lobotomy was abused on McMurphy because he refused to comply with the doctors.
2016-09-14 14:15:12	+ferret_tails	look... we still have an inpatient pediatric facility in New York that literally uses stun-gun levels of electric shock to torture /children/
2016-09-14 14:15:16	+turbo64	early chemists thought they could turn iron into gold and that drinking mercury was healthy for you
2016-09-14 14:15:35	+ferret_tails	and I'm constantly talk to other survivors who have gone through horrific things
2016-09-14 14:15:56	+ferret_tails	most of the people who I know who have survived psychiatric hospitalization were raped /by staff/
2016-09-14 14:16:13	+ferret_tails	I'm incredibly lucky that I've never been raped while I was in the hospital
2016-09-14 14:16:26	+ferret_tails	turbo64: yeah... but see... that's not abuse
2016-09-14 14:16:34	+Wonder_Woman	those are horrible things, but people do not go through the same levels of abuse on a large scale that previous generations did
2016-09-14 14:16:35	<--	Minerva (~billion57@unaffiliated/billion57) has quit (Quit: set it on fire!)
2016-09-14 14:16:40	+Layliah	turbo64: Well, one of those things is possible. They certainly couldn't do it though.
2016-09-14 14:16:43	+ferret_tails	Layliah: yeah... but see... that shit happens /now/
2016-09-14 14:16:44	+Wonder_Woman	and call it "treatment"
2016-09-14 14:16:58	+ferret_tails	Wonder_Woman: YES... THEY... DO
2016-09-14 14:17:01	+ferret_tails	that's what I'm trying to tell you
2016-09-14 14:17:05	+ferret_tails	but you're not listening
2016-09-14 14:17:18	+turbo64	people like the judge rotenberg center aren't part of mainstream psychiatry
2016-09-14 14:17:43	+turbo64	they are fringe nonsense and any rational person would consider their "research" to be pseudoscientific barbarism
2016-09-14 14:17:53	+Layliah	As far as I know, lobotomy is only useful for extreme cases of neurological disorders. I'm aware of it being a treatment for some autistic people on the far low end of the spectrum.
2016-09-14 14:18:00	+ferret_tails	turbo64: so maybe I should start listing a tonne of more ~mainstream~ hospitals where I've talked to people who were raped, who had joints dislocated, who were forced medicated as punishment, who were raped, who were...
2016-09-14 14:18:09	+turbo64	same goes for lobotomy and electroshock therapy
2016-09-14 14:18:28	+ferret_tails	Layliah: lobotomy isn't a treatment for anything
2016-09-14 14:18:29	+turbo64	its quackery and any credible person in the field of psychology recognizes it as such
2016-09-14 14:18:42	+ferret_tails	and certainly not autism
2016-09-14 14:18:46	+Layliah	I don't know about that. It does make sense in autism's case.
2016-09-14 14:18:52	+ferret_tails	lobotomy is used to make people docile
2016-09-14 14:18:56	+ferret_tails	Layliah: how?
2016-09-14 14:19:08	+turbo64	its no reason to denounce an entire field of science that, by and large, helps a lot of people
2016-09-14 14:19:30	+Layliah	We're not talking about high functioning autistic people, we're talking about people at the bottom of the spectrum who in some cases have no ability to communicate with other people at all.
2016-09-14 14:20:16	+ferret_tails	turbo64: it's 'science' is not rigorous, it's been corrupted to the core by the drug industry, and it's systematically abusive to this day
2016-09-14 14:20:17	+Layliah	To the best of my knowledge, we've linked autism to a specific disconnection between the two hemispheres of the brain. I'm just going from memory so I could be misremembering things to an extent.
2016-09-14 14:20:19	+ferret_tails	why shouldn't I denounce it
2016-09-14 14:20:20	+Wonder_Woman	ferret_tails: I'm talking about systemic treatment of the mentally ill. Rape is horrible, but it is also illegal, not used as a treatment on everyone.
2016-09-14 14:20:33	+ferret_tails	Layliah: STOP! why should we care less about people because they're 'low functioning'
2016-09-14 14:20:48	+Layliah	I didn't say anything about caring less o.o
2016-09-14 14:20:49	+ferret_tails	Layliah: your memory is wrong and you're full of shit
2016-09-14 14:21:01	+ferret_tails	we know next to nothing about the neurology of autism
2016-09-14 14:21:04	+Wonder_Woman	It is terrible that vulnerable people do not get the saftely and respect that they should
2016-09-14 14:21:13	+Wonder_Woman	and that should be fought against
2016-09-14 14:22:09	+Layliah	I do a little bit of research into these sorts of things and there are some people who appear to benefit from lobotomy in very, VERY specific neurological conditions. 
2016-09-14 14:22:29	+ferret_tails	Layliah: okay... so then why should it be okay to perform a lobotomy on someone because they're intellectually disabled?
2016-09-14 14:22:29	+turbo64	i think the big problem with "treatments" for autism is that they treat it like some kind of disease that can be cured
2016-09-14 14:22:47	+Wonder_Woman	But the way the mentally ill are treated today is nothing like how they used to be treated, the videos and stories of asylms would give anyone nightmares
2016-09-14 14:23:03	+ferret_tails	Layliah: well I've done a considerable amount of research, including formal education on this and you're wrong
2016-09-14 14:23:14	+turbo64	when what they should be doing is working with autistic people on an individual and personal basis to help them function as best they can with their disability
2016-09-14 14:23:29	+Layliah	ferret_tails: That's not something I could tell you myself. I don't know the in's and out's of lobotomy, and I don't know the specifics of the cases where it has been used.
2016-09-14 14:23:31	+turbo64	which is basically how they treat any other mental illness
2016-09-14 14:23:44	+ferret_tails	Wonder_Woman: it is not materially different than what's going on /right now/, today
2016-09-14 14:23:48	+ferret_tails	and you need to start listening
2016-09-14 14:24:10	+ferret_tails	Layliah: then you don't know what you're talking about
2016-09-14 14:24:42	+Layliah	I'm certianly not claiming to be an expert, but I am just conveying the information I've picked up in the past.
2016-09-14 14:24:46	+Wonder_Woman	ferret_tails: I am listening to you, but I do not think you realize how bad things used to be in the past. I know things are not great now, but they are no where near as bad as they were previously.
2016-09-14 14:25:02	+Wonder_Woman	the mentally ill were literally rounded up and killed
2016-09-14 14:25:14	+wushin	Are still
2016-09-14 14:25:43	 *	wushin looks at the US Police for instance
2016-09-14 14:25:51	+turbo64	a lot of them are rounded up and thrown in prison
2016-09-14 14:26:07	+turbo64	all drug addicts are just mentally ill people who are self medicating
2016-09-14 14:26:16	+ferret_tails	Wonder_Woman: you realize that I've taken courses on the history of mental health care worldwide and, in particular, in the United States
2016-09-14 14:26:22	+ferret_tails	I'm /very/ aware of what it used to be like
2016-09-14 14:26:41	+ferret_tails	Tuskegee and everything
2016-09-14 14:26:41	+turbo64	and instead of getting them the help they need we're throwing them in jail where they just become further entrenched in the criminal underweorld
2016-09-14 14:26:56	+ferret_tails	Wonder_Woman: ... and I'm telling you that it's not materially different now
2016-09-14 14:27:11	+Wonder_Woman	ok, if that is true could I have something to read up more on that?
2016-09-14 14:27:25	+ferret_tails	yes, there are some decent hospitals but there are also horrific hospitals
2016-09-14 14:27:26	+Wonder_Woman	statistics on abuse in mental hospitals
2016-09-14 14:27:34	+Wonder_Woman	and information on the treatment of patients
2016-09-14 14:27:40	+ferret_tails	Wonder_Woman: that'd be interesting if abuse in mental hospitals were systematically reported
2016-09-14 14:27:57	+ferret_tails	how about you just listen to survivors
2016-09-14 14:28:02	+ferret_tails	and listen to patients

2016-09-14 14:28:23	+ferret_tails	... and don't base your concept of whether or not our trauma is 'real' based on a third party authority
2016-09-14 14:28:24	+turbo64	ive been in two mental hospitals and theyre pretty shitty but i didnt see anything that i would consider to be severe abuse
2016-09-14 14:28:36	+turbo64	but i was in one of them for two weeks and they only let us outside into the sunlight once
2016-09-14 14:28:37	+Wonder_Woman	to me, there is a huge difference between a state systematically doing something to a whole group of people and some individuals in hospitals doing illegal things.
2016-09-14 14:28:53	+ferret_tails	turbo64: congratulations, you stayed in above-average hospitals
2016-09-14 14:28:53	+turbo64	my eyes actually hurt when they finally let me out because i wasnt used to being in the sun
2016-09-14 14:29:14	+turbo64	the thing to remember about mental hospitals is they're not intended for treating people really
2016-09-14 14:29:14	+ferret_tails	Wonder_Woman: why are you arguing with me?

2016-09-14 14:29:29		[14:29]
2016-09-14 14:30:05	+turbo64	its just a sort of holding area emergencies, a place where they can watch you and keep you from hurting yourself or someone else and then afterwards they recommend you to an actual treatment facility
2016-09-14 14:30:07	+Wonder_Woman	as far as I know, people with mental illness are not systematically abused by the government where I live
2016-09-14 14:30:12	+turbo64	*for emergencies
2016-09-14 14:31:08	+ferret_tails	Wonder_Woman: how do you know?
2016-09-14 14:31:28	+ferret_tails	Wonder_Woman: do you have a 'major mental illness?' have you had experiences in-and-out of hospitals and otherwise 'in the system?'

2016-09-14 14:32:52	+turbo64	most of the people i met in mental hospitals were there because they are at the breaking point and need to be in a safe place where they won't kill themselves
2016-09-14 14:32:58	+Wonder_Woman	ferret_tails: you told me to listen to survivors, but don't give me any information to do that. Do you have a good source of information so I can learn about the systematic abuse of the mentally ill? I could google but its totally possible I will across bad sources of information, or inaccurate ones.
2016-09-14 14:33:00	+turbo64	lots of homeless people, drug addicts
2016-09-14 14:33:25	+turbo64	the people who were in there involuntarily were often schizophrenics
2016-09-14 14:34:06	+ferret_tails	turbo64: involuntary hospitalization does not reduce the risk of suicide
2016-09-14 14:34:22	+turbo64	its pretty hard to kill yourself in a mental hospital
2016-09-14 14:34:22	+ferret_tails	... and often leads to trauma which can trigger a re-attempt
2016-09-14 14:34:36	+ferret_tails	turbo64: the suicide rates of people who were just released from mental hospitals is staggering
2016-09-14 14:34:45	+ferret_tails	also...
2016-09-14 14:35:08	+turbo64	well they have to release you at some point, and the best they can do is recommend some place where you get further treatment
2016-09-14 14:35:18	+ferret_tails	people who attempt suicide and fail or who were talked down from a sucide attempt are unlikely to re-attempt as long as they're treated gently and with respect
2016-09-14 14:35:21	+ferret_tails	you don't need force
2016-09-14 14:35:26	+turbo64	as i said, its not a place where you get treated and "cured" of your mental illness
2016-09-14 14:35:31	+ferret_tails	but they /use/ force and end up traumatizing people who are already traumatized
2016-09-14 14:36:19	+Wonder_Woman	so far the only thing that has come up for me in the US is compulsory sterilization, which I already knew about

2016-09-14 14:36:43	+turbo64	what they did for me is they gave me seroquel and kept me under 24/7 supervision until i convinced them i was well enough to leave
2016-09-14 14:37:08	+turbo64	the first time, i didnt get any treatment after i got out and eventually i ended up right back in the mental hospital again
2016-09-14 14:38:03	+turbo64	and then that time i went to see the therapist they recommended and after several months of seeing various people and trying different medications i finally found something that worked
2016-09-14 14:38:03	+ferret_tails	Wonder_Woman: you're being told by a survivor /right now/ that you're wrong. you should start by listening to me
2016-09-14 14:38:56	+turbo64	though i wouldnt say that the hospital didnt do anything for me - group therapy and talking to the other patients gave me a lot of perspective
2016-09-14 14:39:13	+Wonder_Woman	ferret_tails: I am. I have literally been listening to you, but you literally said that the abuse today is just as bad as it was 100 years ago, but did not qualify that
2016-09-14 14:39:28	+turbo64	you will never find more kind and understanding people anywhere than the patients you meet in a mental hospital
2016-09-14 14:39:41	+Wonder_Woman	I am even doing research on this subject and cannot find a single thing to help that assertion
2016-09-14 14:40:41	-->	raijin (~raijin@unaffiliated/raijin) has joined ##feminism
2016-09-14 14:40:48	+turbo64	my biggest complaints about mental hospitals, from my personal experience, is bad food, not enough outside time, not being able to go out for a smoke
2016-09-14 14:41:55	+wushin	Don't forget being restrained to a bed and drugged with Thorazine for fuck If I could tell how long.
2016-09-14 14:42:05	+wushin	Also having my head shaved on intake
2016-09-14 14:42:06	+turbo64	i can understand the conundrum of patients smoking cigarettes at a facility dedicated to health, but if anybody needs a cigarette, it's those people
2016-09-14 14:42:25	+turbo64	nothing like that happened at the ones i went to
2016-09-14 14:43:08	+ferret_tails	Wonder_Woman: I said it was fundamentally the same
2016-09-14 14:43:14	+Wonder_Woman	does anyone have information on how prevalent this treat is?
2016-09-14 14:43:23	+ferret_tails	yes, I do
2016-09-14 14:43:35	+turbo64	but there wasnt anyone there who was that troublesome
2016-09-14 14:43:50	+Wonder_Woman	ferret_tails: it isn't the same, things have improved over the last 100 years, but there is still a lot more that can be improved.
2016-09-14 14:44:25	+turbo64	the worst was some girl who was schizophrenic and thought her boyfriend was going to kill her when he visited and she freaked out, but after he left they got her to calm down
2016-09-14 14:45:00	+turbo64	and another man who was schizophrenic who got kicked out of group therapy a few times because he couldn't stop talking and interrupting people
2016-09-14 14:45:00		[14:45]
2016-09-14 14:45:52	+wushin	The mental health facilities I was at was the same as the prisons.
2016-09-14 14:46:14	+wushin	Its the same Quackery, but with new tools.
2016-09-14 14:46:26	+turbo64	was it a state hospital?
2016-09-14 14:46:30	+wushin	Yerp
2016-09-14 14:46:37	+turbo64	yeah ive never been to one of those
2016-09-14 14:46:47	+ferret_tails	turbo64: maybe why your experience hasn't been awful
2016-09-14 14:46:51	+turbo64	the patients at hte hospital i was at told me some stories about them though
2016-09-14 14:47:02	+wushin	Man the detox ward on 13th street
2016-09-14 14:47:03	+turbo64	well it was pretty awful
2016-09-14 14:47:10	+turbo64	but for more personal reasons
2016-09-14 14:47:30	+wushin	Roaches, dilapidated building, rotten food, inadequate bedding
2016-09-14 14:47:53	+wushin	Worring if the gaurds are going to sexual assault you or someone else
2016-09-14 14:48:26	+ferret_tails	wushin: so much better than a hundred years ago, am I right?!
2016-09-14 14:49:00	+turbo64	i wouldnt blame the psychiatric profession for that
2016-09-14 14:49:03	+ferret_tails	like... literally the only difference at this point is that they tie you to a bed instead of chain you to a wall and the manacles are made out of cloth now
2016-09-14 14:49:07	+ferret_tails	I would!
2016-09-14 14:49:08	+wushin	I would
2016-09-14 14:49:10	+ferret_tails	HOLY SHIT I would
2016-09-14 14:49:12	+wushin	JYNX!
2016-09-14 14:49:46	+ferret_tails	it's literally the psychiatric profession's willingness to use force, and society's willingness to /allow/ psychiatrists to use force, that makes places like that possible
2016-09-14 14:49:47	+wushin	Seriously though until you've stayed in a state run mental health center in the poor part of town...
2016-09-14 14:49:47	+turbo64	thats more the result of a shitty government bureaucracy
2016-09-14 14:49:49	+turbo64	same with state prisons
2016-09-14 14:49:53	+ferret_tails	psychiatrists are directly culpable for that abuse
2016-09-14 14:49:54	+ferret_tails	all of them
2016-09-14 14:50:08	+wushin	Nah, Lawerence center locked me in closest for 2 hours when I was 15
2016-09-14 14:50:11	+wushin	that was private
2016-09-14 14:50:20	+turbo64	republicans who don't want to give more funding to the "kooks and criminals"
2016-09-14 14:50:23	+wushin	Sure the food wasn't rotten but once again night assaults
2016-09-14 14:50:30	+wushin	and having my head shaved
2016-09-14 14:50:38	+turbo64	and make sure they are being treated properly
2016-09-14 14:51:04	+turbo64	psychiatrists dont run the hospital, the state does
2016-09-14 14:51:16	+turbo64	and the psychiatrist who works in a mental hospital doesnt really do anything but hand out pills
2016-09-14 14:51:21	+wushin	Now you really wanna see some Attica shit
2016-09-14 14:51:37	+wushin	Get yourself into a state run mental health prison
2016-09-14 14:51:59	+turbo64	the people who are really in charge dont know anything about psychology and basically see the place as just a prison, which is why its like a prison
2016-09-14 14:52:17	+ferret_tails	you know what? I'm done with this apologism bullshit
2016-09-14 14:52:25	+ferret_tails	turbo64: you need to step back and stop
2016-09-14 14:52:33	+turbo64	its pretty sick shit but again, its a result of the backwards fucked up country we live in
2016-09-14 14:53:28	+wushin	In normal prison your meat is green 
2016-09-14 14:53:36	+turbo64	politicians who have no sympathy for sick people, don't see their illnesses as real illnesses, and are more concerned with locking them up and keeping them away from the "normal people" than actually helping them
2016-09-14 14:53:40	+wushin	In mental health prison its black
2016-09-14 14:54:01	+wushin	Eh, turbo64 there are like 100s of fucking staff who could stop it
2016-09-14 14:54:02	+wushin	but don't
2016-09-14 14:54:11	+wushin	complacency is guilt
2016-09-14 14:54:13	+turbo64	i dont know, i would think that actual prison is worse
2016-09-14 14:54:18	+turbo64	especially in texas, where i live
2016-09-14 14:54:19	+ferret_tails	turbo64: stop
2016-09-14 14:54:34	+wushin	Nah, I've been in both it's a tit for tat
2016-09-14 14:54:55	+wushin	Winnebago, OCI, Waupan, Mendota
2016-09-14 14:55:13	+wushin	Luckly I was white so I never got moved out of state miles from my family
2016-09-14 14:55:17	+turbo64	but hey, ive never been to a state hospital or a state prison, im just basing this on what i read in the news
2016-09-14 14:55:24	+wushin	OMFG
2016-09-14 14:55:31	+turbo64	and what people tell me who have been in both
2016-09-14 14:55:39	+wushin	What has the news ever told you
2016-09-14 14:56:00	+wushin	Remember they convinced a nation Iraq was responsible for 9/11
2016-09-14 14:56:07	+turbo64	well right now prisoners are trying to file a lawsuit against the state of texas because the prisons have no air conditioning and its like 110+ degrees in their cells
2016-09-14 14:56:16	+turbo64	and the old/infirm inmates are dying
2016-09-14 14:56:20	+wushin	yerp.
2016-09-14 14:56:28	+turbo64	and the prisons respond by basically starving them
2016-09-14 14:56:41	+wushin	Don't forget tear gasing
2016-09-14 14:56:45	+ferret_tails	oh wow... because nothing like that could happen in a mental hospital~
2016-09-14 14:56:52	+turbo64	then theres the rape, stabbings, etc.
2016-09-14 14:57:02	+wushin	(which Irony, they now drop the gas in through the ceiling into protected baskets
2016-09-14 14:57:02	+ferret_tails	... that happens in mental hospitals all the time
2016-09-14 14:57:18	+wushin	Just like in Auschwitz 
2016-09-14 14:57:31	+wushin	Bear foggers
2016-09-14 14:57:39	+wushin	rubber bullets at point blank
2016-09-14 14:57:54	+wushin	Not to mention SuperMax
2016-09-14 14:58:33	+wushin	I'm pretty sure at this point I could just breathe tear gas
2016-09-14 14:59:24	+turbo64	anyway, i dont think people should denounce all of psychiatry because of that
2016-09-14 14:59:25	+wushin	Pro Tip: If you don't kneel during the Alarm in prison yards they typically just snipe you from the towers.
2016-09-14 14:59:34	+wushin	or assume the position I should say
2016-09-14 14:59:43	+wushin	OCI was lay down flat
2016-09-14 14:59:55	+turbo64	in my opinion, anti-psychiatry is toxic
2016-09-14 14:59:58	+wushin	Mendota was interlock your legs and kneel
2016-09-14 15:00:08	@AUTOMATRON	turbo64 you were told to stop
2016-09-14 15:00:08		[15:00]
2016-09-14 15:00:16	+wushin	They be throwing people in wheelchairs on the ground and shit
2016-09-14 15:00:31	+wushin	yelling at them for "Not Complying"
2016-09-14 15:00:50	+wushin	WTF is a 70 year old man in a wheelchair on oxygen going to do to you?
2016-09-14 15:01:30	+wushin	Seriously folks, We just like to pretend it's better while they found ways to do the same trauma in ways that don't leave marks.
2016-09-14 15:01:56	+ferret_tails	wushin: exactly... it's just more sophisticated
2016-09-14 15:02:01	+ferret_tails	the abusers have gotten better at pretending it's not abuse
2016-09-14 15:02:11	+wushin	or legalized the methods
2016-09-14 15:02:18	+wushin	all together
2016-09-14 15:03:18	+ferret_tails	or changed methods into ones that are more socially acceptable to people who've never had to suffer them
2016-09-14 15:03:23	+ferret_tails	gas chamber -> lethal injection
2016-09-14 15:03:41	+ferret_tails	electroshock therapy -> medications that leave you a drooling mess
2016-09-14 15:03:51	+wushin	Thorazine!
2016-09-14 15:04:10	+ferret_tails	oh... they don't like to use Thorazine anymore
2016-09-14 15:04:13	+ferret_tails	it's gotten a bad reputation
2016-09-14 15:04:18	+turbo64	in america, we have a big problem with a lack of awareness when it comes to things like mental illness, lots of social stigma, lots of skepticism towards psychology as a science, and i think its really damaging and its hurting people and preventing them from getting the help they need
2016-09-14 15:04:26	+wushin	Whats the new drug now ferret_tails ?
2016-09-14 15:04:41	+ferret_tails	wushin: any 'second-generation antipsychotic'
2016-09-14 15:04:45	+ferret_tails	they also use haloperidol a lot
2016-09-14 15:04:45	+turbo64	seroquel seems like its the standard now
2016-09-14 15:04:52	+turbo64	thats what they gave me
2016-09-14 15:04:59	+turbo64	basically made me feel like a zombie
2016-09-14 15:05:13	+ferret_tails	yeah... seroquel does that >.>

2016-09-14 15:10:13	+turbo64	it seems like the diagnosis aspect is pretty scattershot
2016-09-14 15:10:22	+turbo64	at first i was diagnosed with major depression
2016-09-14 15:10:47	+turbo64	and they prescribed me a bunch of different drugs that didnt work
2016-09-14 15:12:02	+turbo64	eventually they gave me cymbalta and it made me start compulsively jerking off constantly, and after i told them that they realized i was actually bipolar and then we had to start all over again and try a bunch of mood stabilizers

2016-09-14 15:19:09	+turbo64	well originally the conversation was about mental illness in general and then it went off onto this whole anti-psychiatry tangent and i wanted to bring it back again

2016-09-14 15:20:07	+ferret_tails	turbo64: you know... maybe that's because when survivors of psychiatric violence weigh in on 'mental illness' we understandably have a strongly anti-psychiatric bent

2016-09-14 15:24:32	+ferret_tails	Wonder_Woman: you know... as someone who has supposedly studied psychiatric history you should know that state mental hospitals were literally used to carry out eugenic clensings
2016-09-14 15:24:45	+ferret_tails	Tuskegee, for example
2016-09-14 15:24:51	+Wonder_Woman	ferret_tails: I'm talkign about *today*
2016-09-14 15:25:02	+Wonder_Woman	modern mental hosptials are not even remotely like Auschwitz
2016-09-14 15:25:16	+GorillaWarfare	Wonder_Woman: Relatedly, you've been belittling folks by insisting that treatment at mental hospitals is not so bad really, while demanding proof from folks with mental illnesses and also ignoring folks with them
2016-09-14 15:26:08	+Wonder_Woman	GorillaWarfare: I didn't demand proof, I asked if I could have more information and actually did research on modern abuses, I never said, "I don't believe you that these horrible things happened"
2016-09-14 15:26:23	+Wonder_Woman	I said, where can I read more about this
2016-09-14 15:26:41	+Wonder_Woman	maybe you should actually read what I wrote
2016-09-14 15:27:11	+Wonder_Woman	I also never said that things that happened "wasn't so bad" I said it has improved but there is still a ways to go
2016-09-14 15:27:25	+ferret_tails	Wonder_Woman: also... you're derailing the conversation. we're trying to criticize you and turbo64 for dismissing the voice of survivors and you're latching on to /one/ comment that wushin made in order to make us sound like we're the unreasonable ones
2016-09-14 15:27:33	+Wonder_Woman	comparing a modern hosptial to Auschwitz is disgusting
2016-09-14 15:27:43	+GorillaWarfare	I did. ferret_tails talked about the abuse, and you said that there was nothing to qualify it, that there was nothing to help that assertion
2016-09-14 15:28:04	+ferret_tails	there's /nothing/ that can back up survivors' assertions other than our voices
2016-09-14 15:28:05	+GorillaWarfare	You were literally saying that you did not believe ferret_tails 
2016-09-14 15:28:06	+Wonder_Woman	ferret_tails: I just pointed out that maybe we shouldn't be using that analogy
2016-09-14 15:28:14	+Wonder_Woman	ferret_tails: I never used it as an agruement

2016-09-14 15:42:29	+Wonder_Woman	its not derailing. I believe that horrible things have happened and that the system has to change, I believe that you have have bad experiences

2016-09-14 15:43:26	+GorillaWarfare	Like: There is not a government-run program to find all mentally ill folks and kill them. There is the government-run police force, which does just so happen to kill mentally ill folks at a vastly higher rate than neurotypical people
2016-09-14 15:43:39	+ferret_tails	because you refuse to acknowledge that our 'bad experiences' sum to a systematic system of violence and abuse
2016-09-14 15:43:45	+GorillaWarfare	Focusing on the fact that the US government is not literally gassing the mentally ill is completely pointless here
2016-09-14 15:44:21	+Wonder_Woman	ferret_tails: when did I say that it doesnt' exist? I just asked for more information. Like GorillaWarfare giving me information about the police just now.

2016-09-14 15:51:08	+Layliah	I'm sorry if it came across that way. I was just bringing up that movie as an example of how flippant things used to be. It was a portrayal of how awful asylums used to operate in the 50's.
2016-09-14 15:52:22	+ferret_tails	they haven't improved
2016-09-14 15:52:35	+GorillaWarfare	Okay, but the lobotomy thing..?
2016-09-14 15:53:48	+Layliah	As far as the lobotomy thing went, we had a conversation about that a little more in depth and I was only conveying my current knowledge of how it has been utilized to treat extreme disorders. I don't necessarily mean to defend it, I was only saying that the reasoning behind it makes sense on paper. Not necessarily that it is correct.
2016-09-14 15:54:00	+Layliah	My knowledge of the subject only goes so far.
2016-09-14 15:54:47	+ferret_tails	no... it doesn't make sense on paper

2016-09-14 15:57:16	+GorillaWarfare	In which case I would think you would know enough about lobotomies to know that they don't make sense
2016-09-14 15:58:05	+Layliah	Yes. I never mean to make any claim to the effect of saying that you were wrong, or that the practice of lobotomy was correct. Only that the reasoning used in the documents that I've read made sense within them. Just this is what I've read, not this is what's right.
2016-09-14 16:00:32	+GorillaWarfare	How old were these documents..?

2016-09-14 16:04:57	+ferret_tails	yeah... there is zero evidence to support psychosurgery in autistic people :1
2016-09-14 16:05:25	+GorillaWarfare	Yeah... Reading just through the Wikipedia article (which seems fairly well-supported, but)
2016-09-14 16:06:00	+GorillaWarfare	Looks like lobotomies started in the 1930s-ish
2016-09-14 16:06:04	+GorillaWarfare	And were fairly done with by 1960
2016-09-14 16:06:12	+GorillaWarfare	Well
2016-09-14 16:06:45	+GorillaWarfare	At least well known to be a poor treatment choice
2016-09-14 16:06:59	+GorillaWarfare	"By the late 1970s, the practice of lobotomy had generally ceased."
2016-09-14 16:07:03	+GorillaWarfare	^ worldwide
2016-09-14 16:07:15	+GorillaWarfare	So I'm surprised to hear you're finding sources that are speaking positively about lobotomy from 1990 onwards
2016-09-14 16:08:49	+Layliah	I think it was chemical lobotomy rather than physical a one. I'm not sure on that one.
2016-09-14 16:09:55	+GorillaWarfare	okay?
2016-09-14 16:11:41	+Layliah	I believe I may have read something that cited this. http://newsroom.cumc.columbia.edu/blog/2014/08/21/children-autism-extra-synapses-brain/
2016-09-14 16:11:43	@AUTOMATRON	Title: Children with Autism Have Extra Synapses in Brain - Columbia University Medical Center (at newsroom.cumc.columbia.edu)
2016-09-14 16:12:15	+Layliah	But in all honesty, I'm unsure of the source of what I originally read on the subject.
2016-09-14 16:13:18	+GorillaWarfare	Okay.. I am not a doctor but there seems to be a massive distinction between what that paper is discussing and lobotomy
2016-09-14 16:15:07	+Layliah	Essentially what it's describing is the potential of a method to using medication to effectively destroy portions of the brain to receive a positive result.

2016-09-14 16:22:27	+ferret_tails	Layliah: what gives you the right to suggest literally /destroying portions of another human beings brain/?!
2016-09-14 16:22:45	+Layliah	I'm not. I'm not saying that it is correct.
2016-09-14 16:23:51	+ferret_tails	so why are you suggesting it?
2016-09-14 16:23:54	+ferret_tails	why are you bringing it up?
2016-09-14 16:23:54	+Layliah	I recall having read a source that talked about lobotomy being useful in the context of functional disconnection specifically relating to autism, but I can't find the source on that. I am in no way saying that it is correct.
2016-09-14 16:24:25	+ferret_tails	'functional disconnection' is a fringe theory :1
2016-09-14 16:25:13	+Layliah	It's something that has been observed, but it's not conclusive at the moment.
2016-09-14 16:25:53	+ferret_tails	you don't understand the science
2016-09-14 16:25:58	+ferret_tails	please stop commenting on it as if you do
2016-09-14 16:26:58	+ferret_tails	you're literally saying "I think inducing deliberate brain damage on certain people is okay"
2016-09-14 16:27:17	+ferret_tails	... and justifiable because those people are less abled/different than you are

2016-09-14 16:29:27	+Layliah	I'm in no way saying that. I'm saying that I recall having read a document that describes it as having been used in successful treatment. That doesn't mean that it's correct. As someone pointed out earlier, we used to think that drinking mercury was helpful and that asbestos was totally safe. If that's how my words come across then I must sincerely apologize.
2016-09-14 16:31:31	+ferret_tails	<Layliah> As far as I know, lobotomy is only useful for extreme cases of neurological disorders. I'm aware of it being a treatment for some autistic people on the far low end of the spectrum.
2016-09-14 16:31:37	+ferret_tails	<Layliah> I don't know about that. It does make sense in autism's case.
2016-09-14 16:31:45	+ferret_tails	<Layliah> We're not talking about high functioning autistic people, we're talking about people at the bottom of the spectrum who in some cases have no ability to communicate with other people at all.
2016-09-14 16:32:03	+ferret_tails	<Layliah> I do a little bit of research into these sorts of things and there are some people who appear to benefit from lobotomy in very, VERY specific neurological conditions.

2016-09-14 16:33:57	+ferret_tails	I don't care if you were goin from memory or not...
2016-09-14 16:34:06	+Layliah	It could have been pulled, or I could have remembered it incorrectly. But either way, I most certainly never meant to suggest that anything was justifiable just because people are different from me.
2016-09-14 16:34:27	+ferret_tails	hoo boy
2016-09-14 16:35:01	+ferret_tails	<Layliah> I mean, as far as I can tell people with autism are essentially 'complete' if that makes sense. This is purely based on my own observation. The malformed connections in the brain are a direct result of their DNA so what more can we really do other than come up with ways to change the way the brain works so it's more similar to other humans?
2016-09-14 16:35:53	+Layliah	Yes, that's what we currently do with the drugs we prescribe.
2016-09-14 16:35:54	+GorillaWarfare	You just went from "it's in use to treat autistic people" to 'I don't know if this one source that talked about what isn't really lobotomy is still correct"
2016-09-14 16:36:20	+GorillaWarfare	And treated ferret_tails like it was weird that they interpreted it the first way

2016-09-14 16:37:15	+Layliah	Well, yeah. I'm more than happy to admit that I might be wrong.
2016-09-14 16:37:26	+Layliah	That's how I got to feminism in the first place.
2016-09-14 16:37:28	+GorillaWarfare	That wasn't admitting you were wrong
2016-09-14 16:37:44	+Layliah	Well, as far as I can tell I was wrong.
2016-09-14 16:37:58	+GorillaWarfare	That was saying you hadn't said something, and treating someone like they were weird for thinking you'd said it
2016-09-14 16:38:03	+GorillaWarfare	Which is gaslighting
2016-09-14 16:38:50	+Layliah	Hang on, let me re-read what I wrote. I didn't mean to do anything like that.

2016-09-14 16:50:27	+ferret_tails	but we /just/ said that lobotomy was abusive
2016-09-14 16:52:17	+Layliah	I'm not disagreeing with that. At this point, I'm more than happy to say that what I remembered was wrong.
2016-09-14 16:56:28	+ferret_tails	'lobotomies are abusive and violent' 'actually they're useful in normalizing autistic people but only if they're super low functioning' <-- kinda fucking violent

2016-09-14 17:05:24	+ferret_tails	okay... but did you not listen to when I talked about how lobotomy was /specifically/ designed to destroy a person's personality and personal agency and to make them compliant by causing massive amounts of brain damage?
2016-09-14 17:07:51	+Layliah	I think that's what made me reference the Hitchcock film. That's what happened to McMurphy when he was lobotomized for not complying with the doctors in the asylum.
2016-09-14 17:09:22	+ferret_tails	you don't understand
2016-09-14 17:09:26	+ferret_tails	it wasn't designed as a punishment
2016-09-14 17:09:35	+ferret_tails	it was literally designed /to commit egocide/

2016-09-14 17:10:35	+ferret_tails	it has everything to do with compliance
2016-09-14 17:15:12	+Layliah	I was under the impression that it had been done to a positive effect on severely disabled people, not that it had been used to control them. 
2016-09-14 17:15:47	+Layliah	I'm not saying that you're wrong, only that it wasn't a thought that occurred to me

2016-09-14 17:21:17	+ferret_tails	IIRC over five years (in an adult) someone using a SGA at typical doses is likely to have a 30% chance of coming down with an irreversible movement disorder known as 'tardive diskynesia'

2016-09-14 17:21:51	+ferret_tails	but we use them liberally on children
2016-09-14 17:21:56	+ferret_tails	... because they're autistic
2016-09-14 17:22:07	+ferret_tails	and they're used in autistic children for behavior modification so that they'll be less 'taxing' on their caregivers

2016-09-14 17:22:24	+Layliah	Do you happen to know about the treatment of extreme cases of autism? I've never really learned about what sorts of things happen as treatment.
2016-09-14 17:22:32	+ferret_tails	because lobotomy /was/ used liberally on autistic people in the past
2016-09-14 17:22:37	+ferret_tails	for the exact same reason
2016-09-14 17:22:52	+ferret_tails	it's just that risperidone is more socially acceptable now that shoving a piece of metal into a young child's eye socket

2016-09-14 17:23:27	+Layliah	What do you mean?
2016-09-14 17:23:43	+ferret_tails	I mean it's an arbitrary distinction that typically has as much to do with wealth as it does with reality
