2016-09-10 14:12:00	leobut	Yeah I mean when a number in a given base has digits that are out of range for that base, instead of treating it as an invalid number (which would normally be a proper course of action) normalize it. For example, 39 (base 8) would become 41 (base 8.) Or H (base 16) would become 11 (base 16.) Or D (base 10) would become 13 (base 10)

2016-09-11 02:34:51	b0at	if you used mpv, it has all the youtube handling built in.
2016-09-11 02:35:09	transhuman_	because its trying to run videos in parallel
2016-09-11 02:35:13	buu	Why do you have a while(1) you can't escape
2016-09-11 02:35:19	buu	transhuman_: pareach ALREADY DOES THAT
2016-09-11 02:35:34	buu	That's the whole point
2016-09-11 02:35:46	transhuman_	but how do i pass pareach different values for the videos?
2016-09-11 02:36:00	buu	transhuman_: Put them as different parts of the argument array
2016-09-11 02:36:11	transhuman_	screen locations and urls I mean
2016-09-11 02:36:25	buu	@urls = ( [url1,x,y], [url2,x,y], ... );
2016-09-11 02:36:34	transhuman_	so in other words I have to have arrays for the values
2016-09-11 02:36:39	transhuman_	instead of values
2016-09-11 02:36:40	transhuman_	ok
2016-09-11 02:36:41	b0at	none of those things are dependent on it being in an infinite loop.
2016-09-11 02:36:43	buu	pareach [@urls], \&foo, {...};
2016-09-11 02:36:52	buu	sub foo { my( $url, $x, $y )= @_ }
2016-09-11 02:36:56	buu	or whatever
2016-09-11 02:37:03	transhuman_	ok i think I got it

2016-09-11 02:37:16	transhuman_	I have to pass arrays to pareach
2016-09-11 02:37:37	buu	AND TAKE OUT INFINITE LOOPS
2016-09-11 02:38:01	transhuman_	so i have to build a loop to build the different x,y, yx values
2016-09-11 02:38:14	transhuman_	and put them into an array
2016-09-11 02:40:16	b0at	also note that if they're all the same size, you can calculate that first, and then just find the offset as you launch.
2016-09-11 02:41:17	transhuman_	got it thanks a lot, I was having trouble picturing how to pass param differnet values I thought I would have to build sub sub routines but that surely make no sense

2016-09-11 05:18:03	Rene	Hi all. Could someone help me out in how i should make this work.. http://pastebin.com/XkXULDmh
2016-09-11 05:18:04	Repaster_	Repasted text from Rene: http://fpaste.org/426551/07084147/
2016-09-11 05:18:19	Rene	i'm not sure what i should look for :-(
2016-09-11 05:19:32	anno	what means "work"?
2016-09-11 05:19:44	huf	and why those qq-s
2016-09-11 05:19:58	anno	what should it do, what is it doing instead?
2016-09-11 05:20:19	huf	what's $zabbix?
2016-09-11 05:21:31	anno	is "$hosvalue" a typo or a different variable from "$hostvalue"?
2016-09-11 05:22:15	Rene	it's a typo :-(
2016-09-11 05:22:15		[05:22]
2016-09-11 05:22:37	Rene	fixed in the paste
2016-09-11 05:22:42	huf	but how does it compile then?
2016-09-11 05:23:53	mauke	terrible
2016-09-11 05:24:07	Rene	the $hostvalue countains eitner a string or a nueric value. Based on this, the $zabbix->do(xxx) has either hostid => or hostname=>
2016-09-11 05:25:07	mauke	$zabbix->do('application.exists', name => $appname, ($foo ? 'hostname' : 'hostid') => $hostvalue);
2016-09-11 05:25:20	Rene	to avoid having the whole call inside an  if/else, i thoght there should be an shorter way..
2016-09-11 05:25:30	mauke	^
2016-09-11 05:25:47	Rene	mauke: ha :-) That i have seen somewhere :-)
2016-09-11 05:25:53	Rene	thanks! .)

2016-09-11 20:09:34	samcv	was wondering if anybody had experience with WWW::Mechanize. I am having a problem of parsing html files in which if the file is huge, it will basically stall the process. i only want to pass as url and receive the title of the page and maybe other sections of it too
2016-09-11 20:09:42	samcv	tho i'm not using that yet.
2016-09-11 20:10:48	samcv	www mechanize has really nice abilities to pull out all those different pieces from the html, but it will just blindly download something huge when i really want it to just stop if it goes far enough so it can 'give up'
2016-09-11 20:11:23	samcv	also would be acceptable would be some way i can exit that sub routine if it hasn't pulled out the data i want within a certain amount of time, that is perfectly acceptable as well
2016-09-11 20:11:55	samcv	so if anybody knows how to do that, that would be great, even if you don't know about www mechanize, it may not be able to do exactly what i want, but that would be fine

2016-09-11 20:14:18	samcv	I am using www::mechanize
2016-09-11 20:14:24	simcop2387	it think mech uses TreeBuilder by default let me look
2016-09-11 20:15:06	samcv	 it is nice because all i have to do is: $mech->get( $url ); my $title = $mech->title();
2016-09-11 20:15:32	samcv	and i can pull out the title of the page, and also am free to just add more parts to pull out other elements as i expand my script/program
2016-09-11 20:16:14	samcv	i think it *can* use treebuilder, but treebuilder is built on www::mechanize i believe
2016-09-11 20:17:17	simcop2387	WWW::Mechanize is based on LWP::UserAgent, it sets up things for you to have cookies working by default (among other things), and uses HTML::TreeBuilder when you use any of the stuff for forms and such
2016-09-11 20:18:16	simcop2387	Take a look at Mojo::Dom and passing it the page contents with $mech->response()->content() to parse the title and such out of it.  you can also use LWP::UserAgent directly if you don't have to hit a whole bunch of pages for a login and such (Mech makes that easier)
2016-09-11 20:18:43	simcop2387	i'm surprised that HTML::TreeBuilder takes long enough that it's an issue though
2016-09-11 20:19:16	samcv	well if it gets passed something like a file that is not html
2016-09-11 20:19:18	simcop2387	hmm, for title it says it uses HTML::HeadParser
2016-09-11 20:19:24	samcv	it just tries to parse the whole thing
2016-09-11 20:19:33	samcv	which is not what i want
2016-09-11 20:19:54	simcop2387	try testing it with ->is_html first to handle non-html stuff
2016-09-11 20:19:57	samcv	like if it gets fed like an iso file, it will download it all. and yeah i could try and exclude filetypes but i'd rather not do that
2016-09-11 20:20:04	simcop2387	that uses the mime type to tell
2016-09-11 20:20:07	samcv	since some pages don't have extensions, and it's just not reliable enough for me
2016-09-11 20:20:10	samcv	ooo
2016-09-11 20:20:15	samcv	me likey
2016-09-11 20:20:28	samcv	is_html is for which perl module?
2016-09-11 20:20:34	simcop2387	WWW::Mechanize

2016-09-12 00:32:59	jesk	Hi guys
2016-09-12 00:33:23	jesk	i'am extending some Perl code, or better wan to use it for some other scripts
2016-09-12 00:33:30	jesk	the author has the following in his code
2016-09-12 00:33:43	jesk	(I'am pretty noobish, disclaimer)
2016-09-12 00:34:05	jesk	  Arguments:
2016-09-12 00:34:08	jesk	    no_delete_name - Do not attempt to delete name DNS record
2016-09-12 00:34:10	jesk	    delete_ips - Optionally delete IP addresses associated with this device    y
2016-09-12 00:34:38	jesk	this is the description of a function in a module
2016-09-12 00:34:45	jesk	and now the start of the function:
2016-09-12 00:34:48	jesk	sub delete {
2016-09-12 00:34:51	jesk	    my ($self, %argv) = @_;
2016-09-12 00:35:03	jesk	ok
2016-09-12 00:35:42	jesk	Now I wan to call this method via $dev->delete('delete_ips')
2016-09-12 00:36:11	jesk	When doing this I get "Odd number of elements in hash assignment..."
2016-09-12 00:36:49	jesk	is his function broken?
2016-09-12 00:41:29	b0at	no
2016-09-12 00:41:29		[00:41]
2016-09-12 00:41:42	b0at	delete_ips => 1
2016-09-12 00:41:59	Altreus	does the author not know how to use POD
2016-09-12 00:45:17	b0at	unless that stray 'y' there indicates the expected value of 'y' as a true value, which would be daft
2016-09-12 00:45:43	Altreus	I suspect it indicates the default, or is a typo
2016-09-12 00:46:19	Altreus	I have to question the naming of %argv
2016-09-12 00:46:23	b0at	indeed
2016-09-12 00:46:30	Altreus	% is not, per se, a vector type

2016-09-12 12:15:35	mauke	this is why I didn't want to give a (misleading) answer
2016-09-12 12:15:47	leobut	" < mauke> it should be able to use caller() to get the calling package " <- I thought this implied that there was something wrong with how the calling package was being returned.
2016-09-12 12:16:02	mauke	<mauke> the type reifier should only get a single argument; the type string in question  <mauke> it should be able to use caller() to get the calling package
2016-09-12 12:16:07	leobut	If I'm wrong then sorry, but this sort of thing makes people curious ;p
2016-09-12 12:16:12	mauke	the important part here is "the type reifier"
2016-09-12 12:16:23	leobut	Oh, that referred to the previous statement.
2016-09-12 12:16:33	mauke	yeah
2016-09-12 12:16:35	gordonfish	D'oh. Sorry. I hadn't realized that either.
2016-09-12 12:16:56	gordonfish	I read it as a separate issue, next one in the list.
2016-09-12 12:17:01	mauke	in the current version, the type reifier gets two arguments: the type string and the calling package
2016-09-12 12:17:02	leobut	Same here.
2016-09-12 12:17:44	mauke	the type reifier should only get one argument because in an ideal world caller() would return the calling package
2016-09-12 12:17:54	mauke	what it actually returns is "main"
2016-09-12 12:18:05	mauke	because the call happens at compile time (from inside the parser)
2016-09-12 12:18:12	gordonfish	ah
2016-09-12 12:18:22	mauke	BEGIN blocks have the same issue, btw
2016-09-12 12:18:37	mauke	file and line number are fine, but the package is always main
2016-09-12 12:18:51	mauke	due to shenanigans
2016-09-12 12:19:12	leobut	Even when using caller(0) vs caller(1), etc ?

2016-09-12 12:20:18	leobut	mauke: How else would one be able to generate a trace?
2016-09-12 12:20:34	leobut	You need 0, 1, 2, ...

2016-09-12 14:04:12	leobut	I meant last most index of the array.

2016-09-13 08:53:12	robairt	I'm assuming its something other than mojo timing out, but I'm not totally sure where to start looking, I was wondering if anyone else has seen something similar?

2016-09-13 08:58:53	transhuman_	ok so this is by no means great programming (maybe not even good enough...) but I have almost gotten this to the point where its usable http://paste.debian.net/820937/  unfortunately it seems to have an issue with Use of uninitialized value $y in concatenation even though I have passed these parameters to the subroutine  my ( $Url, $x, $y, $w, $h) = @_; Not sure if what is going wrong is with the way I have passed the
2016-09-13 08:58:53	transhuman_	variables or something more sinister...anyone?
2016-09-13 08:59:20	mst	-w is wrong
2016-09-13 08:59:25	mst	don't use single letter variable names
2016-09-13 08:59:44	mst	you're declaring a bunch of random globals at the top, don't do that
2016-09-13 09:00:07	transhuman_	ok thanks
2016-09-13 09:00:10	Deep_Thought	I have a issue with a cpan test report http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/b0b32640-78cf-11e6-ab41-c893a58a4b8c
2016-09-13 09:00:23	mst	transhuman_: you're declaring 'my $groupstep' right at the top when it's just a 'for' loop variable
2016-09-13 09:00:27	Deep_Thought	The report is concerning this file : https://metacpan.org/source/SKYSYMBOL/AI-ConfusionMatrix-0.004/lib/AI/ConfusionMatrix.pm
2016-09-13 09:00:28	mst	transhuman_: declare things where you need them
2016-09-13 09:00:39	Deep_Thought	Do you have any pointers about what could be wrong?
2016-09-13 09:00:41	mst	transhuman_: all of these things make your code basically undebuggable
2016-09-13 09:00:44	transhuman_	ok thanks I will definitely fix that
2016-09-13 09:00:48	mst	transhuman_: so you want to fix those first
2016-09-13 09:00:54	transhuman_	ok will do
2016-09-13 09:01:22	mst	transhuman_: note, I'm not trying to be mean here - generally when I see a piece of code like this and clean up things like that, the actual bug becomes obvious mid-cleanup - saves me hours
2016-09-13 09:02:08	transhuman_	no I know your not being mean...thanks for the pointers...its my first program second version so I knew it was needing some serious help...
2016-09-13 09:04:17	preaction	Deep_Thought: are you able to reproduce it with that perl version on your local machine?
2016-09-13 09:04:41	Deep_Thought	preaction: no
2016-09-13 09:04:50	Deep_Thought	perl 5.22 here
2016-09-13 09:05:03	robairt	Figured my thing out, the soap api is timing out on the request, its not my code. Since you were all holding your breath
2016-09-13 09:05:08	preaction	Deep_Thought: that's not the perl version this report is using. did you install that perl version and try it?
2016-09-13 09:05:09	mst	robairt: \o/
2016-09-13 09:05:19	preaction	Deep_Thought: up at the top, it says it's using 5.14.1
2016-09-13 09:05:28	preaction	sorry, 5.14.4
2016-09-13 09:06:13	preaction	Deep_Thought: outside of that, it's kind of weird that you're doing %{$matrix} and then doing a hash lookup (%{$matrix}{...}->{...}), when in other places you're just doing $matrix->{...}{...};
2016-09-13 09:06:13		[09:06]
2016-09-13 09:06:39	mst	Deep_Thought: %{$matrix}{...} is wrong

2016-09-13 09:07:23	mst	Deep_Thought: you wanted $matrix->{$expected}{$predicted}
2016-09-13 09:07:23	preaction	and it doesn't fail in 5.22 because of hashy slices...
2016-09-13 09:07:30	Deep_Thought	preaction: this is automated tests from cpan, so I'm assuming they're testing the dist on multiple os / perl versions
2016-09-13 09:07:46	preaction	Deep_Thought: yes. each report is a single OS and perl version. the perl version and OS is in the report
2016-09-13 09:07:46	Deep_Thought	preaction: right
2016-09-13 09:08:16	Deep_Thought	ok thanks
2016-09-13 09:08:33	mst	Deep_Thought: basically you typo'ed some code and accidentally wrote something that, via a 5.22-only feature, happened to appear to work
2016-09-13 09:08:40	mst	Deep_Thought: so on every other perl it'll blow up
2016-09-13 09:08:48	mst	Deep_Thought: fixing the bug the way I just explained should work fine though
2016-09-13 09:09:08	Deep_Thought	Yes, I understand, thank you guys!

2016-09-13 12:33:33	Grinnz	this is discussed in perlsyn, I believe, it's because do {} isn't really a block
2016-09-13 12:33:57	leobut	How exactly is it not a block?

2016-09-13 12:38:56	Grinnz	pink_mist: i assumed you meant "as opposed to a regular while loop" since no other interpretation makes much sense
2016-09-13 12:38:57	LeoNerd	It's a syntax hack
2016-09-13 12:39:55	pink_mist	Grinnz: I was responding to leobut though. and his question was "I had always understood that 'do' was treated somewhat special when used with post-whil"

2016-09-13 12:49:26	ningu	Grinnz: also the \@ vs. @ distinction needs to remain
2016-09-13 12:49:35	mauke	leobut: "1234x" =~ /(?<=(\d+)(\d+))x/, what are $1 and $2 going to be?
2016-09-13 12:49:35	Grinnz	well yeah, you'd keep the original string around

2016-09-13 14:26:08	gordonfish	131 (base-10)
2016-09-13 14:27:57	gordonfish	I should perhaps mention that I based my code directly off how I learned to convert to and from base-10 way back by hand. So there is nothing specific doing that, it's all just math.

2016-09-13 14:35:03	leobut	This is one of those things I really love about math and it seems some people aren't even aware it can work that way.

2016-09-13 14:37:16	leobut	gordonfish: And I learned something similar back in college about converting bases, like this: http://www.purplemath.com/modules/numbbase.htm
2016-09-13 14:37:22	leobut	You just essentially rolled it into loops it looks like.
2016-09-13 14:37:37	gordonfish	rud0lf: Yep
2016-09-13 14:37:50	gordonfish	leobut: Yeah basically.

2016-09-13 21:32:16	svisor_	Hi all, I'm experimenting with Carton, somebody recomended me to use it for module management in my project. I'd like to clarify one thing: I created my "cpanfile" and "carton install" modules into "local/" subdirectory of my project, what is the common approach (or best practice) for using this module directory in perl application? (I also have some private modules in "lib/" subdir.)
2016-09-13 21:33:33	svisor_	One more thing, I'm on debian and have separate perl installation (via Perl::Build), independent from system perl.

2016-09-13 22:45:56	Richlv	i'm trying to assign hash values as an array to a hashref - $get_params{objectids} = values($object_ids); - but i guess it evaluates 'values' in scalar context and i just get the count. how can i tell to evaluate 'values' in list context ?
2016-09-13 22:46:15	Richlv	(without assigning to a temporary array)
2016-09-13 22:46:42	Richlv	i tried something like (values($object_ids)), but that's probably just silly :)
2016-09-13 22:47:23	ningu	hash values are always scalars
2016-09-13 22:47:26	ningu	you need an arrayref
2016-09-13 22:47:36	ningu	also, that is a hash, not a hashref
2016-09-13 22:47:40	Altreus	Richlv: use @
2016-09-13 22:47:46	Altreus	Richlv: because it's a list

2016-09-13 22:48:18	ningu	I am not sure which of those two Richlv wanted
2016-09-13 22:48:59	Altreus	ningu: indeed, values is in scalar context because he's assigning to a scalar - so the answer is currently a superposition of both

2016-09-13 22:52:16	Richlv	ningu, i'd like to assign to a single hash key

2016-09-13 22:53:02	ningu	right, so you need an arrayref for that, since an arrayref is a scalar and a hash value has to be a scalar
2016-09-13 22:54:08	ningu	but is $object_ids a hashref? in that case you want: $get_params{objectids} = [ values(%$object_ids) ];
2016-09-13 22:54:14	Altreus	Richlv: $HASH{ONE_KEY} = [ LIST ]
2016-09-13 22:55:50	ningu	I wonder why keys/values can't operate on hashrefs...? that would seem like a simple feature addition

2016-09-13 22:56:51	Altreus	The feature was auto-deref, so it applied to more than just those two things

2016-09-13 22:57:16	Altreus	I guess they *could* do that, but honestly it's cleaner to force the developer to be explicit
2016-09-13 22:57:20	ningu	well in that case I can understand
2016-09-13 22:57:33	Altreus	end of the day it's an extra % or @
2016-09-13 22:57:37	ningu	well, yes, except that what else could keys $foo possibly mean?

2016-09-14 00:41:28	svisor_	Hi all! I'm on Debian and have separate perl installation (via Perl::Build), independent from system perl. I'm experimenting with Carton, somebody recomended me to use it for module management in my project. I'd like to clarify one thing: I created my  "cpanfile" and "carton install" modules into "local/" subdirectory of my project. What is the common approach (or best practice) for using modules from this
2016-09-14 00:41:34	svisor_	directory in perl application? (I also have some private modules in "lib/" subdir.)
2016-09-14 00:42:05	Altreus	presumably with PERL5LIB=local or perl -I local/
2016-09-14 00:42:10	Altreus	oh
2016-09-14 00:42:15	LeoNerd	jesk: pink_mist: Mmm?
2016-09-14 00:42:15	Altreus	and lib
2016-09-14 00:42:27	Altreus	PERL5LIB=local;lib or perl -I local/ -I lib/
2016-09-14 00:42:36	Altreus	svisor_: sorry, i'm being wrong
2016-09-14 00:42:39	Altreus	PERL5LIB=local:lib or perl -I local/ -I lib/
2016-09-14 00:42:49	Altreus	svisor_: I think I finally got it right :P
2016-09-14 00:42:56	jesk	LeoNerd: I asked about what the defacto Perl standard way is to use getaddrinfo
2016-09-14 00:43:31	jesk	is it your module, IO::Socket::IP?
2016-09-14 00:43:55	pink_mist	yes, it's his =)
2016-09-14 00:43:58	Altreus	If I merge Moose Roles around like they're going out of fashion and the same Role is included twice, does that get implicitly ignored?
2016-09-14 00:44:13	jesk	no, I asked if its his module which is the standard way :-)
2016-09-14 00:44:22	pink_mist	oh :P
2016-09-14 00:44:29	svisor_	Altreus is it possible to implement this in some elegant "per-script" fashion instead of "system-wide"?
2016-09-14 00:44:40	Altreus	svisor_: use lib 'local';
2016-09-14 00:44:59	Altreus	svisor_: and again for lib
2016-09-14 00:45:02	LeoNerd	jesk: Surely   use Socket qw( getaddrinfo );
2016-09-14 00:45:04	Altreus	'lib'
2016-09-14 00:45:47	LeoNerd	But likely you don't need it, because in normal client or server scenarios, IO::Socket::IP will call it directly
2016-09-14 00:46:15	svisor_	Altreus: I am exploring "rlib" now
2016-09-14 00:46:23	jesk	LeoNerd: not sure if I can follow
2016-09-14 00:46:52	jesk	LeoNerd: "use IO::Socket::IP" or "use Socket"?
2016-09-14 00:47:00	Altreus	rlib?
2016-09-14 00:47:24	svisor_	Altreus: does "lib" work with relative paths and changed workind dir?
2016-09-14 00:47:41	Altreus	it is relative to something something
2016-09-14 00:47:42	svisor_	https://metacpan.org/pod/rlib
2016-09-14 00:47:50	Altreus	RTFM :)
2016-09-14 00:47:50		[00:47]
2016-09-14 00:49:20	svisor_	ok, I know there is a plenty approaches to do this, but my orignal question was about best practice or usual way of doing things
2016-09-14 00:49:42	pink_mist	jesk: what is the reason you want to call getaddrinfo?
2016-09-14 00:49:54	jesk	I just need a DNS lookup, no sockets
2016-09-14 00:51:10	pink_mist	use Net::DNS perhaps?

2016-09-14 13:14:48	LeoNerd	But yes, thank :)
2016-09-14 13:15:08	xenu	well, most people don't check mail as often as they check irc

2016-09-14 13:16:31	tm604	since IRC is public, it also saves people the effort of hacking into your email account to find the link!

2016-09-14 18:35:22	samcv	and the second script works perfectly fine when run by itself and outputs the proper symbols to the terminal, and they worked fine together when it was just one script. so i know it's a problem with the IPC::System::Simple, can anybody recommend another way to do this?

2016-09-15 06:51:18	^7heo	does it even make sense to have a package for it
2016-09-15 06:51:25	mst	generally, yes
2016-09-15 06:51:35	mst	since there'll be compiled bits in the dependency chain, I would expect

2016-09-15 06:51:55	^7heo	there's pip, cpan, gem, etc.
2016-09-15 06:51:59	^7heo	why reinvent the wheel?
2016-09-15 06:52:11	^7heo	yeah I know, debian packages everything.
2016-09-15 06:52:17	^7heo	Not sure if it's a good idea.
2016-09-15 06:52:35	^7heo	mst: in python too, pip sometimes compiles some bits.
2016-09-15 06:52:36	mst	well, honestly, were I you, I would consider packaging App::cpanminus and local::lib

2016-09-15 06:53:16	mst	cpanm is basically an 80% solution replacement for cpan
