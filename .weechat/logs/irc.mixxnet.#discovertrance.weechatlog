2016-09-09 15:01:56	+Frey	Had premium for soooo long, felt like it was too expensive though, so I quit.
2016-09-09 15:01:58	+AliFlowTrance	Chreddy: all producers are on spotify?

2016-09-12 11:46:02	+DJ_Arnaud67	Loch Ness is thought by some to be the home of the Loch Ness Monster (also known as "Nessie"), a cryptid, reputedly a large unknown animal. It is similar to other supposed lake monsters in Scotland and elsewhere, though its description varies from one account to the next. Popular interest and belief in the animal's existence has varied since it was first brought to the world's attention
