2016-10-13 11:55:24	Gamebag	I got a null modem serial cable for my old laptops
2016-10-13 11:56:09	Gamebag	copying word 95 is gonna take 90 minutes at 921600 bauds per second
2016-10-13 11:56:15	Gamebag	im in for the long haul
2016-10-13 11:57:06	Gamebag	I wish there was an easy way to convert bauds per second to bits per second
2016-10-13 11:57:06		[11:57]
2016-10-13 11:57:13	Gamebag	any formulas for that
2016-10-13 11:58:15	@DRAWNBOX	idk, but you could take the filesize
2016-10-13 11:58:18	@DRAWNBOX	and the time left
2016-10-13 11:58:18	Gamebag	its better than using floppies, albeit slower
2016-10-13 11:58:23	@DRAWNBOX	and do some crazy calculation
2016-10-13 11:58:44	@DRAWNBOX	(filesize*60*60)
2016-10-13 11:58:54	@DRAWNBOX	*timeleft
2016-10-13 11:58:55	Gamebag	The file is a DMF formatted floppy image (9 of em) and 1 takes 10 minutes so that's how I came to the 90 minute conclusion
2016-10-13 11:59:21	Gamebag	1.6MB = 10 minutes according to the file transfer window
2016-10-13 11:59:49	Gamebag	but at least I'm gonna be using Word 6.1 anymore!
