2016-10-31 19:18:22	notadrop	haha. my line of thinking was, a common use for VPNs is for privacy (though I've read they're useless for that), so having your own would be useless for that
2016-10-31 19:18:45	ryonaloli	BazookaTooth: can you rephrase that? i don't get what the isp has to do with those benefits.
2016-10-31 19:19:17	ryonaloli	notadrop: it's useless (or not particularly useful) regardless. either way, you're connecting directly to it with your real ip address.
2016-10-31 19:19:38	BazookaTooth	ryonaloli: just relocated. any encrypted traffic on usual ports is being throttled into the ground.
2016-10-31 19:19:43	ryonaloli	if you own your own though, it is useful for privacy when it comes to preventing your isp and those snooping on your wifi, etc from detecting you
2016-10-31 19:20:02	ryonaloli	BazookaTooth: using a vpn to avoid traffic throttling makes sense

2016-10-31 19:25:36	ryonaloli	port 0 can be useful because, normally, when a program binds to port 0, that tells the system "give me a random, unused port to bind to", but there's nothing stopping you from literally binding to port 0. but that means nothing uses port 0. technically, there's nothing preventing you from using port 0, so some dumb filter software only checks ports 1-65535

2016-10-31 22:11:54	ryonaloli	also, a stepup transformer does *not* reduce EMI. in fact it can make it worse.
2016-10-31 22:12:11	ryonaloli	well, what you're throwing out can either make it better, or worse. it's pure snakeoil. you'd need to have a high-pass filter.

2016-10-31 22:14:19	ryonaloli	while your step-up transformer is busy flipping up the frequency, hundreds of thousands of inversions of leaking signal data will occur before it flips from +/- to -/+ one time.

2016-11-01 02:15:40	m712	well, it routes through 1024:65535 i think
2016-11-01 02:16:35	dmnc	Does anyone know how that works in theory, with stuff arriving while the script is running? Since the script adds rules one by one, with the firewall running before and in between, is there a possible race condition while running the rule script?
2016-11-01 02:17:15	dmnc	It's a tight window I guess, but wouldn't you rather read all the rules in one chunk and apply them before any decision is made?
2016-11-01 02:17:41	m712	welp, ssh hanged
2016-11-01 02:17:50	m712	it's gonna restart in 5 mins
2016-11-01 02:17:50	ShoarAu	i guess better way is to drop everything and allow only what needs to go in/out

2016-11-01 02:20:55	dmnc	sandman13: That'd just be stupid. Especially if loading the rules works like I think it does (i.e. incrementally).
2016-11-01 02:21:18	m712	sandman13: disallow anything but 6000, 80 and 443
2016-11-01 02:21:21	dmnc	sandman13: And judging by the firewall setups I've seen, "people" don't default ACCEPT, but default DROP.

2016-11-01 02:22:03	xalice	dmnc: yes there is a very thin window where everything is dropped, but it's not much of a problem
2016-11-01 02:22:18	dmnc	xalice: It is a problem for those who don't default DROP :(
2016-11-01 02:22:32	dmnc	xalice: And it would be trivial to solve if iptables could read a config file.

2016-11-01 02:23:50	xalice	the first three lines DROP everything, so before execution i guess it defaults to ACCEPT. I don't know if iptables can be made to DROP everything from boot

2016-11-01 05:04:45	C_Sto	send a copy to yourself when doing the encryption
2016-11-01 05:04:45	pagios	the psk is stored locally on my pc
2016-11-01 05:04:55	C_Sto	unlikely
2016-11-01 05:05:08	C_Sto	unsure about implementation details, but it should be fairly ephemeral
2016-11-01 05:05:34	C_Sto	as in, it shouldn't exist in plaintext anywhere

2016-11-01 05:05:52	C_Sto	heh
2016-11-01 05:05:55	pagios	i encrypted using public remote key 
2016-11-01 05:06:02	pagios	and inside that youy have that symmetric key
2016-11-01 05:06:10	C_Sto	yep
2016-11-01 05:06:15	pagios	the remote user , decrypts using his private key and sees the symmetric key
2016-11-01 05:06:19	pagios	so far so good
2016-11-01 05:06:24	C_Sto	yep
2016-11-01 05:06:34	pagios	now when i open that sent item locally, i need a key the question is why
2016-11-01 05:06:40	pagios	and what is used to decrypt in this case
2016-11-01 05:06:57	C_Sto	because that symmetric key is destroyed when you send it

2016-11-01 05:07:21	C_Sto	the way around this
2016-11-01 05:07:22	pagios	so what happens
2016-11-01 05:07:25	C_Sto	is to send yourself a copy
2016-11-01 05:07:43	pagios	C_Sto, i can see the msg if i put my passphrase
2016-11-01 05:07:47	pagios	its not that i cant open it

2016-11-01 05:08:56	pagios	C_Sto, the idea is thunderbird asks for the passpharse to unlock my private key
2016-11-01 05:09:00	pagios	and i am trying to understand why
2016-11-01 05:09:21	C_Sto	oh, right, well in that case it has sent yourself a copy
2016-11-01 05:09:34	C_Sto	and it needs your private key to decrypt the symmetric key
2016-11-01 05:10:10	bezaban	the symmetric key is only an intermediate as it is not good practice to encrypt anything with an assymetric pair where content > keysize (also why you use symmetric keys for HTTPS) For understanding it's not really required to think about the symmetric session keys, but is of course right that this is what is going on.

2016-11-01 12:51:34	LTCD	Hey. When the police took down the SilkRoad 1 server they left a deface page up saying it had been shutdown. Even though they had private key etc... what I do not understand is how SilkRoad2 was able to show a different message on that page directing users to the new hidden service link. Any ideas? Don't see how two hidden services with same URL can both operate at same time.

2016-11-01 14:11:40	squib	WhatsCS, another thing that I'm trying to decide is how to handle updating the root CA CRL because we intend to keep our root offline.  It's my understanding that the CRL will still need to be updated periodically so that an expired CRL cannot break validation.  but I also understand that clients will cache the CRL and so setting the CRL lifetime to be too long means it will adversely affect the time it takes for them to be

2016-11-01 14:12:04	squib	I was thinking that maybe I should set the main CRL to something really high but then set the delta CRL to something more reasonable.

2016-11-01 14:12:44	WhatsCS	because even if I'm inexperienced I could still throw out ideas that could help
2016-11-01 14:12:50	squib	I see.
2016-11-01 14:13:02	squib	ok that's fair thanks for any input you have.
2016-11-01 14:13:05	WhatsCS	and it seemed no one else was responding, so if you continue to type out everything you may come up with the solution on your own

2016-11-01 14:15:44	WhatsCS	squib, if you know the ttl for the CRL then you could just have a script that will wake-on-lan, update CRL and kill the server if you really want to keep it offline.

2016-11-01 14:22:28	squib	WhatsCS, the server is virtual but the vmdk is not kept on the datastore because of security concerns
2016-11-01 14:22:40	squib	it's kept offline until the root needs to power up
2016-11-01 14:23:15	squib	WhatsCS, also it's my understanding that a properly implemented offline root does not have network access, ie some other form of media is used to transfer CRL updates and to issue certs.
