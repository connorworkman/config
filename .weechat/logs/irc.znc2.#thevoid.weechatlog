2016-10-17 01:28:34	ominous	its hilarious
2016-10-17 01:29:53	ominous	also something really strange happened the other day lol
2016-10-17 01:30:06	ominous	so I got this really strange DM from Twitter from my Japanese friend
2016-10-17 01:30:18	ominous	at first it was normal talk
2016-10-17 01:30:27	ominous	so I know it was him for sure and not a hacked account
2016-10-17 01:30:48	ominous	but he randomly messages me "I'd like to touch your penis to see how hard it is" 
2016-10-17 01:30:54	ominous	I have no clue how to interpret that lol
2016-10-17 01:30:59	ominous	him being Japanese 
2016-10-17 01:31:05	ominous	its hard to know what he meant
2016-10-17 01:31:22	ominous	so I just asked him if he was gay or something.. lol
2016-10-17 01:31:40	ominous	I think he was probably drunk or something to be honest
2016-10-17 01:31:49	ominous	might have been trying to troll me
2016-10-17 01:32:52	ominous	he has been known to say some crazy shit being funny
2016-10-17 01:34:35	ominous	I mean.. if he is gay then why didn't he just say "oh by the way I'm gay.. just for your information" I'd be like "aight man"
2016-10-17 01:36:44	ominous	another possibility is someone grabbed his phone and typed in some bullshit to fuck with him lol
2016-10-17 01:36:59	ominous	anyways I'm curious how this will pan out
2016-10-17 01:37:25	ominous	if he is gay it sure is news to me.. also if that is his way of coming out of the closet then god damn thats awkward lol
2016-10-17 01:39:02	alyptik	ominous› i am not sure either
2016-10-17 01:39:07	alyptik	tbh could be either one
2016-10-17 01:39:24	ominous	yeah could have been simply fucking with me
2016-10-17 01:39:31	ominous	which is not uncommon with him
2016-10-17 01:39:54	ominous	but anyways.. that was a very clear statement with decent English considering he is Japanese
2016-10-17 01:40:01	ominous	his English is really good
2016-10-17 01:40:29	alyptik	you won't really know till they actually try to touch your dick

2016-10-17 01:46:22	alyptik	if there was a word stronger than awkward that was it
2016-10-17 01:47:11	ominous	I'll be completely honest with a friend if they felt that way about me "hey man if I were into you that way we'd be fucking right now, but unfortunately I am not into you sexually I hope you understand.. I'm not upset about you grabbing my dick and we are still friends"
2016-10-17 01:47:14	ominous	lol

2016-10-17 01:48:35	alyptik	he blamed it on being drunk, eventually came out hah
2016-10-17 01:48:48	alyptik	now we laugh about it
2016-10-17 01:48:57	ominous	well.. people always use the beer as an excuse.. but that is always complete bullshit
2016-10-17 01:49:02	alyptik	indeed
2016-10-17 01:50:23	ominous	also my Japanese friend is a very unique person in that regard
2016-10-17 01:51:02	ominous	social norms don't really click with him
2016-10-17 01:51:36	alyptik	just as likely you are being trolled true
2016-10-17 01:51:57	ominous	I mean we talk freely about shit
2016-10-17 01:52:07	ominous	he isn't bothered by crazy shit
2016-10-17 01:55:09	ominous	lol I asked him once if he ever let a chick fuck him with a strap on and he said "oh? I've never done that before.. wow man thanks for telling me about that I'm going to have to try that"
