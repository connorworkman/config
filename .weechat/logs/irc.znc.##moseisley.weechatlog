2016-09-16 17:24:32	hackerhercules	cool man, cool
2016-09-16 17:29:01	javaisnom	Pretty much nothing
2016-09-16 17:29:04	javaisnom	sorry I was afk :c
2016-09-16 17:29:16	hackerhercules	well
2016-09-16 17:29:19	hackerhercules	you should start something
2016-09-16 17:29:27	javaisnom	just working my memelord craft, pretty cancer <3
2016-09-16 17:30:18	javaisnom	such as? 
2016-09-16 17:30:44	javaisnom	nothing in particular to work on rn, so just decomposing
2016-09-16 17:31:06	hackerhercules	install Gentoo with us
2016-09-16 17:31:21	javaisnom	b-but what about my arch install
2016-09-16 17:32:05	hackerhercules	do it in a VM or chroot
2016-09-16 17:33:05	javaisnom	https://ptpb.pw/e4JF >vm
2016-09-16 17:33:33	javaisnom	I'll try and install in a chroot
2016-09-16 17:33:46	hackerhercules	yessss
2016-09-16 17:33:53	hackerhercules	one of us one of us gooba gobba gooba gobba
2016-09-16 17:33:58	javaisnom	Same?
2016-09-16 17:34:17	hackerhercules	I'm working on finishing GRUB2 install on mine right now
2016-09-16 17:36:45	javaisnom	is systemd-boot an option?
2016-09-16 17:36:45		[17:36]
2016-09-16 17:37:10	hackerhercules	yes, but you should use init.d because systemd is ugly sin
2016-09-16 17:37:37	minimalism	you should just use efibootmgr
2016-09-16 17:37:37	 *	javaisnom is too stupid / ignorant to see it's horrible impurities
2016-09-16 17:37:52	hackerhercules	really anything that doesn't involve systemd
2016-09-16 17:37:58	minimalism	it's even more trim and cool than gummiboot/systemd-boot
2016-09-16 17:37:59	hackerhercules	javaisnom the basic one sentence reason is this
2016-09-16 17:38:06	javaisnom	b-but what about systemctl
2016-09-16 17:38:12	minimalism	openrc
2016-09-16 17:38:18	minimalism	it's even simpler
2016-09-16 17:38:25	hackerhercules	systemd is bad because it tries to do too much at once and has lots of oversight and unnecessary dependencies that bloat it and make it very insecure and prone to eventual failure
2016-09-16 17:38:34	minimalism	and binary logs
2016-09-16 17:38:43	minimalism	and doesn't let you really choose your own system logger or anything
2016-09-16 17:38:48	javaisnom	"OpenRC is 100% compatible with Gentoo init scripts, which means one can probably find one for the daemons you want to start in the Gentoo Portage Tree. "
2016-09-16 17:38:48	minimalism	can't use cron so much either..
2016-09-16 17:39:00	javaisnom	It definitely doesn't follow the UNIX way, though
2016-09-16 17:39:20	minimalism	systemd or openrc?
2016-09-16 17:39:31	hackerhercules	while I'd discourage you from systemd... just moving to Gentoo and learning it at first even with what you're already comfortable with is a pretty good step
2016-09-16 17:39:49	hackerhercules	learning another init system isn't that hard
2016-09-16 17:40:22	javaisnom	Oh
2016-09-16 17:40:48	javaisnom	systemd

2016-09-16 17:42:05	javaisnom	That's true

2016-09-16 18:11:05	minimalism	If rules keep getting tighter though based on social/political ideals
2016-09-16 18:11:19	minimalism	a large banlist will accumulate, and then hell will overflow with the damned
2016-09-16 18:11:26	minimalism	then ##moseisley will be a successful channel

2016-09-17 11:45:41	alyptik	a 45 is good for making holes in people
2016-09-17 11:45:47	javaisnom	Good enough
2016-09-17 11:45:47	alyptik	so i would think so 
2016-09-17 11:47:51	hackerhercules	hahahahahahaha
2016-09-17 11:47:56	hackerhercules	I just did something that'll get me banned from phrik

2016-09-17 11:49:06	alyptik	wut
2016-09-17 11:49:23	hekel	lol 45
2016-09-17 11:49:45	javaisnom	What hekel?
2016-09-17 11:49:48	javaisnom	I don't know much about guns
2016-09-17 11:49:49	hekel	because a larger diameter makes it better, right?
2016-09-17 11:49:56	javaisnom	idk, that's just what's in my house
2016-09-17 11:49:59	alyptik	should be a 50 cal
2016-09-17 11:50:14	hekel	personally I never liked 45acp
2016-09-17 11:50:31	hekel	and my dick is big enough to admit it's too much for me
2016-09-17 11:50:41	hekel	I disliek the recoil
2016-09-17 11:50:54	hekel	and 10mm is better anyway
2016-09-17 11:50:59	alyptik	honestly if you are trying to save yourself i don't think it matters as long you can pull the trigger
2016-09-17 11:51:04	alyptik	any gun will stop someone
2016-09-17 11:51:22	javaisnom	Yeah
2016-09-17 11:51:27	hekel	sure, a .22lr will kill
2016-09-17 11:51:36	 *	hekel carries a 9mm
2016-09-17 11:51:44	javaisnom	I have no practice with firearms
2016-09-17 11:51:46	alyptik	a 9mm with a HP will rip anyone to shreds
2016-09-17 11:51:52	hekel	o,0
2016-09-17 11:52:20	javaisnom	my parents probably won't let me shoot for a reason tbh
2016-09-17 11:52:20	alyptik	a bb gun will fucking kill you if you are hit in the wrong place
2016-09-17 11:52:20	alyptik	lol
2016-09-17 11:52:26	javaisnom	lol
2016-09-17 11:52:34	 *	hekel uses hhyrdashoks
2016-09-17 11:52:38	hekel	generally
2016-09-17 11:52:50	hackerhercules	9mm is most useful for self defense only when you have 12+ rd mags to compensate for typical user's horrible innaccuracy due to nerves
2016-09-17 11:53:01	javaisnom	they're like hollow points, hekel?
2016-09-17 11:53:07	hekel	-,-

2016-09-17 15:40:33	hekel	-,-
2016-09-17 15:40:34	minimalism	I don't know if using tor is exactly safe, but they recently re-opened the tor gateway for testing
2016-09-17 15:40:39	minimalism	I don't think it's in full function yet
2016-09-17 15:41:00	alyptik	lol not being serious
2016-09-17 15:41:03	phillid	Why would you want to be safe in a public forum?
2016-09-17 15:41:06	alyptik	tor is a good way to get on watchlist
2016-09-17 15:41:10	phillid	That's no fun whatsoever

2016-09-17 15:56:22	hackerhercules	you can combine tor with a VPN and other things
2016-09-17 15:56:41	hackerhercules	tor is only unsafe if it's your only measure and you're depending on all of the exit/entry nodes to be uncompromised
2016-09-17 16:02:00		[15:56]
2016-09-17 16:02:03	alyptik	hackerhercules: solution run your own exit node and tunnel everything through tor
2016-09-17 16:02:20	alyptik	also run that in a vm and tor the whole thing
2016-09-17 16:05:46	javaisnom	not being on a watchlist but being watched > not being watched but on a watchlist
