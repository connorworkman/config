2016-09-16 17:29:01	javaisnom	Pretty much nothing
2016-09-16 17:29:04	javaisnom	sorry I was afk :c
2016-09-16 17:29:16	hackerhercules	well
2016-09-16 17:29:19	hackerhercules	you should start something
2016-09-16 17:29:27	javaisnom	just working my memelord craft, pretty cancer <3
2016-09-16 17:30:18	javaisnom	such as? 
2016-09-16 17:30:44	javaisnom	nothing in particular to work on rn, so just decomposing
2016-09-16 17:31:06	hackerhercules	install Gentoo with us
2016-09-16 17:31:21	javaisnom	b-but what about my arch install
2016-09-16 17:32:05	hackerhercules	do it in a VM or chroot
2016-09-16 17:33:05	javaisnom	https://ptpb.pw/e4JF >vm
2016-09-16 17:33:33	javaisnom	I'll try and install in a chroot
2016-09-16 17:33:46	hackerhercules	yessss
2016-09-16 17:33:53	hackerhercules	one of us one of us gooba gobba gooba gobba
2016-09-16 17:33:58	javaisnom	Same?
2016-09-16 17:34:17	hackerhercules	I'm working on finishing GRUB2 install on mine right now
2016-09-16 17:36:45	javaisnom	is systemd-boot an option?
2016-09-16 17:36:45		[17:36]
2016-09-16 17:37:10	hackerhercules	yes, but you should use init.d because systemd is ugly sin
2016-09-16 17:37:37	minimalism	you should just use efibootmgr
2016-09-16 17:37:37	 *	javaisnom is too stupid / ignorant to see it's horrible impurities
2016-09-16 17:37:52	hackerhercules	really anything that doesn't involve systemd
2016-09-16 17:37:58	minimalism	it's even more trim and cool than gummiboot/systemd-boot
2016-09-16 17:37:59	hackerhercules	javaisnom the basic one sentence reason is this
2016-09-16 17:38:06	javaisnom	b-but what about systemctl
2016-09-16 17:38:12	minimalism	openrc
2016-09-16 17:38:18	minimalism	it's even simpler
2016-09-16 17:38:25	hackerhercules	systemd is bad because it tries to do too much at once and has lots of oversight and unnecessary dependencies that bloat it and make it very insecure and prone to eventual failure
2016-09-16 17:38:34	minimalism	and binary logs
2016-09-16 17:38:43	minimalism	and doesn't let you really choose your own system logger or anything
2016-09-16 17:38:48	javaisnom	"OpenRC is 100% compatible with Gentoo init scripts, which means one can probably find one for the daemons you want to start in the Gentoo Portage Tree. "
2016-09-16 17:38:48	minimalism	can't use cron so much either..
2016-09-16 17:39:00	javaisnom	It definitely doesn't follow the UNIX way, though
2016-09-16 17:39:20	minimalism	systemd or openrc?
2016-09-16 17:39:31	hackerhercules	while I'd discourage you from systemd... just moving to Gentoo and learning it at first even with what you're already comfortable with is a pretty good step
2016-09-16 17:39:49	hackerhercules	learning another init system isn't that hard
2016-09-16 17:40:22	javaisnom	Oh
2016-09-16 17:40:48	javaisnom	systemd

2016-09-16 18:11:19	minimalism	a large banlist will accumulate, and then hell will overflow with the damned
2016-09-16 18:11:26	minimalism	then ##moseisley will be a successful channel

2016-09-17 11:45:41	alyptik	a 45 is good for making holes in people
2016-09-17 11:45:47	javaisnom	Good enough
2016-09-17 11:45:47	alyptik	so i would think so

2016-09-17 11:47:56	hackerhercules	I just did something that'll get me banned from phrik

2016-09-17 11:49:23	hekel	lol 45
2016-09-17 11:49:45	javaisnom	What hekel?
2016-09-17 11:49:48	javaisnom	I don't know much about guns
2016-09-17 11:49:49	hekel	because a larger diameter makes it better, right?
2016-09-17 11:49:56	javaisnom	idk, that's just what's in my house
2016-09-17 11:49:59	alyptik	should be a 50 cal
2016-09-17 11:50:14	hekel	personally I never liked 45acp
2016-09-17 11:50:31	hekel	and my dick is big enough to admit it's too much for me
2016-09-17 11:50:41	hekel	I disliek the recoil
2016-09-17 11:50:54	hekel	and 10mm is better anyway
2016-09-17 11:50:59	alyptik	honestly if you are trying to save yourself i don't think it matters as long you can pull the trigger
2016-09-17 11:51:04	alyptik	any gun will stop someone
2016-09-17 11:51:22	javaisnom	Yeah
2016-09-17 11:51:27	hekel	sure, a .22lr will kill
2016-09-17 11:51:36	 *	hekel carries a 9mm
2016-09-17 11:51:44	javaisnom	I have no practice with firearms
2016-09-17 11:51:46	alyptik	a 9mm with a HP will rip anyone to shreds
2016-09-17 11:51:52	hekel	o,0
2016-09-17 11:52:20	javaisnom	my parents probably won't let me shoot for a reason tbh
2016-09-17 11:52:20	alyptik	a bb gun will fucking kill you if you are hit in the wrong place
2016-09-17 11:52:20	alyptik	lol

2016-09-17 11:52:34	 *	hekel uses hhyrdashoks
2016-09-17 11:52:38	hekel	generally
2016-09-17 11:52:50	hackerhercules	9mm is most useful for self defense only when you have 12+ rd mags to compensate for typical user's horrible innaccuracy due to nerves
2016-09-17 11:53:01	javaisnom	they're like hollow points, hekel?

2016-09-18 13:26:05	javaisnom	Hi hackerhercules 
2016-09-18 13:26:15	javaisnom	dont go to burger king tomorrow
2016-09-18 13:30:41	minimalism	That isn't proper form.
2016-09-18 13:30:56	minimalism	You're supposed to post that on /r9k/, do the deed, and then get all the blame cast on 4chan the next day.
2016-09-18 13:31:05	alyptik	finally i have qemu internet
2016-09-18 13:31:16	alyptik	now i can gentoo
2016-09-18 13:31:44	minimalism	I'm going through the Jedi trials.
2016-09-18 13:31:48	minimalism	Almost done with Linux Sea.
2016-09-18 13:32:00	alyptik	i still need the lightsaber crystal
2016-09-18 13:32:00	minimalism	Then I install amd64 default. I use it for some time, learning.
2016-09-18 13:32:12	alyptik	the path ahead is long 
2016-09-18 13:32:15	minimalism	Then when I'm prepared, I am prepared for the trials to become a Jedi Knight.
2016-09-18 13:32:20	minimalism	Then I use amd64 hardened.
2016-09-18 13:32:34	minimalism	I'm going to get a Sunrider's Destiny crystal.
2016-09-18 13:32:46	alyptik	damn
2016-09-18 13:32:55	alyptik	hardcore
2016-09-18 13:33:32	alyptik	also minimalism why is there a 2GB iso for gentoo
2016-09-18 13:33:35	minimalism	for real though, I'd recommend reading Linux Sea
2016-09-18 13:33:35	alyptik	wtf is on that
2016-09-18 13:33:39	minimalism	that livedvd?
2016-09-18 13:33:43	alyptik	yeah
2016-09-18 13:33:46	minimalism	it's some terrible graphical livedvd that even they condemn
2016-09-18 13:33:50	alyptik	is it debian-esque?
2016-09-18 13:33:52	alyptik	i figure
2016-09-18 13:33:52	minimalism	they hate maintaining it, no one wants to maintain it
2016-09-18 13:34:08	alyptik	yeah i was like "why is this even here?"
2016-09-18 13:35:18	minimalism	it doesn't even work well lol
2016-09-18 13:35:20	minimalism	internet cuts in and out
2016-09-18 13:35:30	minimalism	their situation with installation media sucks
2016-09-18 13:35:41	minimalism	none of the ISOs except livedvd support UEFI booting
2016-09-18 13:35:46	minimalism	and the minimal, admincd, etc..
2016-09-18 13:35:55	minimalism	they just need to make one good minimal iso similar to arch
2016-09-18 13:36:32	alyptik	oh so this is BIOS mode?
2016-09-18 13:36:51	alyptik	do you need UEFI mode to install bootloader?
2016-09-18 13:37:04	minimalism	you can't boot gentoo as UEFI with gentoo media other than the livedvd
2016-09-18 13:37:09	minimalism	at least during install
2016-09-18 13:37:14	minimalism	you can install gentoo with any foreign media
2016-09-18 13:37:21	minimalism	I use archiso since it's UEFI bootable
2016-09-18 13:37:52	alyptik	ah good to know incase i do use it on main system
2016-09-18 13:39:30	minimalism	archiso is usable for both, so it's pretty convenient
2016-09-18 13:39:45	minimalism	some people recommend systemrescuecd, but it's a pos imo
2016-09-18 13:39:45		[13:39]
2016-09-18 13:39:53	minimalism	can't get it to work correctly since it's primarily x86
2016-09-18 13:40:32	alyptik	how do you install it from archiso? just mount loop and chroot or something?
2016-09-18 13:40:48	minimalism	well it's because gentoo is mostly a remote thing
2016-09-18 13:41:00	minimalism	you just need a bootable nix environment where you can curl, mount, chroot, wget etc.
2016-09-18 13:41:14	minimalism	it's basically mkdir /mnt/gentoo from the archiso
2016-09-18 13:41:17	alyptik	oh so it's mostly curl stuff cool
2016-09-18 13:41:17	minimalism	cd to it
2016-09-18 13:41:24	minimalism	pull the stage3 archive
2016-09-18 13:41:32	minimalism	extract the way it explains to retain all permissions and such
2016-09-18 13:41:41	minimalism	and then you eventually chroot and start formatting disks, etc.
2016-09-18 13:41:55	alyptik	ah ok not that bad
2016-09-18 13:45:24	alyptik	qemu networking is such a pita
2016-09-18 13:45:35	alyptik	i eventually gave up and installed libvirtd
2016-09-18 13:47:13	hekel	boobies.

2016-09-18 14:47:31	alyptik	i can just add gentoo to it right? same with efistub?
2016-09-18 14:47:34	minimalism	they sound "made up" to be honest
2016-09-18 14:47:39	alyptik	i am pretty sure it works like that

2016-09-18 14:47:56	alyptik	welp nothing like trying and finding out
2016-09-18 14:48:18	minimalism	I thought refind looked for existing boot loaders or something
2016-09-18 14:48:33	mnrmnaugh	lawlz
2016-09-18 14:48:37	alyptik	minimalism: it is just automation of efi shell commands
2016-09-18 14:48:45	alyptik	also can chainload, but fuck that
2016-09-18 14:49:03	minimalism	well I only keep one installation really.. except for right now while I'm switching to gentoo and practicing
2016-09-18 14:49:09	minimalism	efibootmgr's one entry is ideal
2016-09-18 14:49:14	mnrmnaugh	you should be able to just smoosh gentoo in. i dun see why not....
2016-09-18 14:49:37	alyptik	well worst case i can just reinstall refind from archiso i guess
2016-09-18 14:49:43	alyptik	lol smoosh
2016-09-18 14:49:57	mnrmnaugh	:p
2016-09-18 14:50:20	mnrmnaugh	yar. liveisos are so gooood
2016-09-18 14:50:24	alyptik	from gentoo forums:
2016-09-18 14:50:26	alyptik	"PostPosted: Thu Nov 21, 2013 2:29 pm Post subject: Reply with quote There is precisely one OS installation task that requires a boot in EFI mode to accomplish: registering the boot loader with the firmware.

2016-09-18 14:50:44	alyptik	so it seems it's ok as long as i don't touch refind
2016-09-18 14:51:38	mnrmnaugh	hopefully? ive never used efi though :p

2016-09-18 15:29:09	mnrmnaugh	well, if you dont go to forums, whats the harm?
2016-09-18 15:29:12	hekel	especially since most of the shit you buy on there can be added to your steam inventory for free
2016-09-18 15:29:54	mnrmnaugh	email gunk id guess? ive never joined a forum...
2016-09-18 15:30:59	hekel	I try to remember to get a lot of shit on gog or hb before purchasing it on steam so I can have the steam benefits and a DRM-Free version

2016-09-18 15:32:34	minimalism	because steam is cancer
2016-09-18 15:32:39	hekel	lol
2016-09-18 15:32:47	NextHendrix	you can't transfer them
2016-09-18 15:33:02	hekel	unfortunately you can only add your gog games to steam, not the other way around
2016-09-18 15:33:45	minimalism	yeah..
2016-09-18 15:33:49	minimalism	I love what gog appears to be doing

2016-09-18 15:37:00	minimalism	How exactly does gog work, because there's a ton of AUR packages for gog games
2016-09-18 15:37:08	minimalism	Do you enter a key?
2016-09-18 15:37:29	hekel	you'll need to have the gog zip/tar from the gog site
2016-09-18 15:37:35	hekel	with the pkgbuild
2016-09-18 15:37:51	hekel	and it'll just build a package that installs it to /*
2016-09-18 15:39:27	minimalism	ah I see.. reading the AUR pkgbuild now
2016-09-18 15:39:32	minimalism	just manages the tar you get from gog
2016-09-18 15:39:51	minimalism	So if you have that tar, it doesn't require any verification whatsoever that you own it?

2016-09-18 15:51:20	minimalism	instead of stealing it
2016-09-18 15:51:21	hekel	yup yup
2016-09-18 15:51:40	minimalism	I'm probably still going to wait until steam crumbles and there's some way to migrate
2016-09-18 15:51:48	minimalism	maybe gog can come up with another deal with publishers better than gog connect
2016-09-18 15:51:50	hekel	that's why I try to remember to buy the drm free versions and then add them to my steam instead of just buyign shit on steam
2016-09-18 15:52:24	hekel	gog connect? is that the steam-linked thing?
2016-09-18 15:52:30	hekel	or is that HB I'm thinking of?
2016-09-18 15:52:38	minimalism	it's where they can view your list of games on steam
2016-09-18 15:52:43	minimalism	the account is linked to gog
2016-09-18 15:52:46	minimalism	amd they let you have said games on gog
2016-09-18 15:52:49	hekel	kk, then it is what I'm thinking of
2016-09-18 15:53:07	hekel	wasn't sure if it was HB of GOG that offered that
2016-09-18 15:53:21	minimalism	I'm not sure.. humble might too
2016-09-18 15:53:42	minimalism	I just remember dosbox exists

2016-09-19 15:29:49	javaisnom	In late 2007, he became Internet-famous when he caught the attention of 4chan and Encyclopedia Dramatica. Initial fascination was spurred on by his signature homemade Sonichu medallion, his childlike artwork featuring his unoriginal Sonic recolor, and his history of loitering in public places while literally holding up a sign asking women to talk to him. His reaction to the ensuing mockery led to a 
2016-09-19 15:29:55	javaisnom	spiral of ever greater scrutiny of his life, revealing more disturbing facts about him.

2016-09-19 15:55:07	minimalism	desktop profile isn't necessary unless you're using a serious DE like gnome or kde
2016-09-19 15:55:15	minimalism	you can just use the plain profile #1 in the list

2016-09-19 15:55:49	alyptik	10 more pkgs to emerge
2016-09-19 15:55:51	minimalism	just don't expect your first installation to be your last
2016-09-19 15:55:52	alyptik	might as well finish

2016-09-19 15:58:05	minimalism	verify things actually work as intended

2016-09-20 16:18:09	NextHendrix	it

2016-09-20 16:18:14	hackerhercules	you mean mandrakes?
2016-09-20 16:18:29	hackerhercules	we call them quaaludes, or ludes, if that's what you mean
2016-09-20 16:18:31	NextHendrix	pinged out the wazoo cunt

2016-09-20 16:19:05	hackerhercules	those are mollies
2016-09-20 16:19:26	NextHendrix	pinging keys in the SU bopping about but waint feeling it so dipped off
2016-09-20 16:19:46	NextHendrix	now sat rar chilling at yard
2016-09-20 16:20:51	hackerhercules	can't say I ever felt it any time I was bopping about any SU anywhere
2016-09-20 16:20:52	alyptik	i am trying really hard to follow this convo
2016-09-20 16:20:53	NextHendrix	flatmate begged the rest of my bag but bumped it off and rolled i expect he'll be raged when he claps back
2016-09-20 16:20:56	javaisnom	Mollies?
2016-09-20 16:20:58	alyptik	but it is no use
2016-09-20 16:21:07	hackerhercules	it's seriously not that hard
2016-09-20 16:21:14	javaisnom	aww fuck yeah get L I T in the C L I T mah niggaaa
2016-09-20 16:21:16	hackerhercules	and I'm not even British
2016-09-20 16:21:16	alyptik	wtf is an SU
2016-09-20 16:21:26	NextHendrix	students union
2016-09-20 16:21:29	hackerhercules	contextually I'd assume student union
2016-09-20 16:21:32	hackerhercules	oh hey lookit there
2016-09-20 16:21:39	alyptik	oh ok
2016-09-20 16:21:39	NextHendrix	yeah hh knows
2016-09-20 16:21:51	NextHendrix	hackerhercules: safe bruv
2016-09-20 16:21:51	hackerhercules	so when he said "pinging keys" probably meant "bouncing off the walls" or "keyed up on drugs", depending on the context... I'm betting he meant the former 
2016-09-20 16:22:08	hackerhercules	so he was in the Student Union just kind of chillin, but he got bored
2016-09-20 16:22:10	alyptik	i always just say rolling balls
2016-09-20 16:22:13	hackerhercules	so he went somewhere else
2016-09-20 16:22:35	hackerhercules	then the person he shares rented space with begged for the rest of his recreational materials
2016-09-20 16:22:43	NextHendrix	yes
2016-09-20 16:22:47	NextHendrix	mug
2016-09-20 16:22:51	hackerhercules	but NH took it all, cause fuck his flatmate, and left
2016-09-20 16:22:59	alyptik	lol
2016-09-20 16:23:03	hackerhercules	so he suspects said flat mate will be agitated when...
2016-09-20 16:23:13	hackerhercules	he talks to NH next.
2016-09-20 16:23:16	NextHendrix	hackerhercules: almost, theres some left

2016-09-20 16:36:36	hackerhercules	it works more or less as good as realtime for fluid jam sessions
2016-09-20 16:36:37	alyptik	ah
2016-09-20 16:36:50	NextHendrix	get no latency (technically) by delaying everyoes input by the same amount
2016-09-20 16:36:56	hackerhercules	honestly it was working pretty good if we just had a set thing going
2016-09-20 16:37:00	NextHendrix	and syncing everyone up to a metronome#
2016-09-20 16:37:09	hackerhercules	that's why for a few measures it sounded like it was perfect

2016-09-20 16:44:48	tortib	send yourself a wire transfer
2016-09-20 16:44:49	tortib	BAM
2016-09-20 16:44:57	NextHendrix	or just go ATM
2016-09-20 16:44:59	tortib	no
2016-09-20 16:45:02	alyptik	inb4 tortib goes broke, loses house, sells self on corner
2016-09-20 16:45:02	tortib	then it does cash advance
2016-09-20 16:45:14	tortib	if you use a ATM it's a higher rate
2016-09-20 16:45:23	 *	NextHendrix doesn't use credit cards at all
2016-09-20 16:45:30	tortib	if you use wire transfer it's $20 for the wire then it charges your CC like a regular transaction
2016-09-20 16:45:32	tortib	you should man
2016-09-20 16:45:36	tortib	they give you a huge advantage
