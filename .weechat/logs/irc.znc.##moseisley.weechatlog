2016-09-16 17:29:01	javaisnom	Pretty much nothing
2016-09-16 17:29:04	javaisnom	sorry I was afk :c
2016-09-16 17:29:16	hackerhercules	well
2016-09-16 17:29:19	hackerhercules	you should start something
2016-09-16 17:29:27	javaisnom	just working my memelord craft, pretty cancer <3
2016-09-16 17:30:18	javaisnom	such as? 
2016-09-16 17:30:44	javaisnom	nothing in particular to work on rn, so just decomposing
2016-09-16 17:31:06	hackerhercules	install Gentoo with us
2016-09-16 17:31:21	javaisnom	b-but what about my arch install
2016-09-16 17:32:05	hackerhercules	do it in a VM or chroot
2016-09-16 17:33:05	javaisnom	https://ptpb.pw/e4JF >vm
2016-09-16 17:33:33	javaisnom	I'll try and install in a chroot
2016-09-16 17:33:46	hackerhercules	yessss
2016-09-16 17:33:53	hackerhercules	one of us one of us gooba gobba gooba gobba
2016-09-16 17:33:58	javaisnom	Same?
2016-09-16 17:34:17	hackerhercules	I'm working on finishing GRUB2 install on mine right now
2016-09-16 17:36:45	javaisnom	is systemd-boot an option?
2016-09-16 17:36:45		[17:36]
2016-09-16 17:37:10	hackerhercules	yes, but you should use init.d because systemd is ugly sin
2016-09-16 17:37:37	minimalism	you should just use efibootmgr
2016-09-16 17:37:37	 *	javaisnom is too stupid / ignorant to see it's horrible impurities
2016-09-16 17:37:52	hackerhercules	really anything that doesn't involve systemd
2016-09-16 17:37:58	minimalism	it's even more trim and cool than gummiboot/systemd-boot
2016-09-16 17:37:59	hackerhercules	javaisnom the basic one sentence reason is this
2016-09-16 17:38:06	javaisnom	b-but what about systemctl
2016-09-16 17:38:12	minimalism	openrc
2016-09-16 17:38:18	minimalism	it's even simpler
2016-09-16 17:38:25	hackerhercules	systemd is bad because it tries to do too much at once and has lots of oversight and unnecessary dependencies that bloat it and make it very insecure and prone to eventual failure
2016-09-16 17:38:34	minimalism	and binary logs
2016-09-16 17:38:43	minimalism	and doesn't let you really choose your own system logger or anything
2016-09-16 17:38:48	javaisnom	"OpenRC is 100% compatible with Gentoo init scripts, which means one can probably find one for the daemons you want to start in the Gentoo Portage Tree. "
2016-09-16 17:38:48	minimalism	can't use cron so much either..
2016-09-16 17:39:00	javaisnom	It definitely doesn't follow the UNIX way, though
2016-09-16 17:39:20	minimalism	systemd or openrc?
2016-09-16 17:39:31	hackerhercules	while I'd discourage you from systemd... just moving to Gentoo and learning it at first even with what you're already comfortable with is a pretty good step
2016-09-16 17:39:49	hackerhercules	learning another init system isn't that hard
2016-09-16 17:40:22	javaisnom	Oh
2016-09-16 17:40:48	javaisnom	systemd

2016-09-16 18:11:19	minimalism	a large banlist will accumulate, and then hell will overflow with the damned
2016-09-16 18:11:26	minimalism	then ##moseisley will be a successful channel

2016-09-17 11:45:41	alyptik	a 45 is good for making holes in people
2016-09-17 11:45:47	javaisnom	Good enough
2016-09-17 11:45:47	alyptik	so i would think so

2016-09-17 11:47:56	hackerhercules	I just did something that'll get me banned from phrik

2016-09-17 11:49:23	hekel	lol 45
2016-09-17 11:49:45	javaisnom	What hekel?
2016-09-17 11:49:48	javaisnom	I don't know much about guns
2016-09-17 11:49:49	hekel	because a larger diameter makes it better, right?
2016-09-17 11:49:56	javaisnom	idk, that's just what's in my house
2016-09-17 11:49:59	alyptik	should be a 50 cal
2016-09-17 11:50:14	hekel	personally I never liked 45acp
2016-09-17 11:50:31	hekel	and my dick is big enough to admit it's too much for me
2016-09-17 11:50:41	hekel	I disliek the recoil
2016-09-17 11:50:54	hekel	and 10mm is better anyway
2016-09-17 11:50:59	alyptik	honestly if you are trying to save yourself i don't think it matters as long you can pull the trigger
2016-09-17 11:51:04	alyptik	any gun will stop someone
2016-09-17 11:51:22	javaisnom	Yeah
2016-09-17 11:51:27	hekel	sure, a .22lr will kill
2016-09-17 11:51:36	 *	hekel carries a 9mm
2016-09-17 11:51:44	javaisnom	I have no practice with firearms
2016-09-17 11:51:46	alyptik	a 9mm with a HP will rip anyone to shreds
2016-09-17 11:51:52	hekel	o,0
2016-09-17 11:52:20	javaisnom	my parents probably won't let me shoot for a reason tbh
2016-09-17 11:52:20	alyptik	a bb gun will fucking kill you if you are hit in the wrong place
2016-09-17 11:52:20	alyptik	lol

2016-09-17 11:52:34	 *	hekel uses hhyrdashoks
2016-09-17 11:52:38	hekel	generally
2016-09-17 11:52:50	hackerhercules	9mm is most useful for self defense only when you have 12+ rd mags to compensate for typical user's horrible innaccuracy due to nerves
2016-09-17 11:53:01	javaisnom	they're like hollow points, hekel?

2016-09-18 13:26:05	javaisnom	Hi hackerhercules 
2016-09-18 13:26:15	javaisnom	dont go to burger king tomorrow
2016-09-18 13:30:41	minimalism	That isn't proper form.
2016-09-18 13:30:56	minimalism	You're supposed to post that on /r9k/, do the deed, and then get all the blame cast on 4chan the next day.
2016-09-18 13:31:05	alyptik	finally i have qemu internet
2016-09-18 13:31:16	alyptik	now i can gentoo
2016-09-18 13:31:44	minimalism	I'm going through the Jedi trials.
2016-09-18 13:31:48	minimalism	Almost done with Linux Sea.
2016-09-18 13:32:00	alyptik	i still need the lightsaber crystal
2016-09-18 13:32:00	minimalism	Then I install amd64 default. I use it for some time, learning.
2016-09-18 13:32:12	alyptik	the path ahead is long 
2016-09-18 13:32:15	minimalism	Then when I'm prepared, I am prepared for the trials to become a Jedi Knight.
2016-09-18 13:32:20	minimalism	Then I use amd64 hardened.
2016-09-18 13:32:34	minimalism	I'm going to get a Sunrider's Destiny crystal.
2016-09-18 13:32:46	alyptik	damn
2016-09-18 13:32:55	alyptik	hardcore
2016-09-18 13:33:32	alyptik	also minimalism why is there a 2GB iso for gentoo
2016-09-18 13:33:35	minimalism	for real though, I'd recommend reading Linux Sea
2016-09-18 13:33:35	alyptik	wtf is on that
2016-09-18 13:33:39	minimalism	that livedvd?
2016-09-18 13:33:43	alyptik	yeah
2016-09-18 13:33:46	minimalism	it's some terrible graphical livedvd that even they condemn
2016-09-18 13:33:50	alyptik	is it debian-esque?
2016-09-18 13:33:52	alyptik	i figure
2016-09-18 13:33:52	minimalism	they hate maintaining it, no one wants to maintain it
2016-09-18 13:34:08	alyptik	yeah i was like "why is this even here?"
2016-09-18 13:35:18	minimalism	it doesn't even work well lol
2016-09-18 13:35:20	minimalism	internet cuts in and out
2016-09-18 13:35:30	minimalism	their situation with installation media sucks
2016-09-18 13:35:41	minimalism	none of the ISOs except livedvd support UEFI booting
2016-09-18 13:35:46	minimalism	and the minimal, admincd, etc..
2016-09-18 13:35:55	minimalism	they just need to make one good minimal iso similar to arch
2016-09-18 13:36:32	alyptik	oh so this is BIOS mode?
2016-09-18 13:36:51	alyptik	do you need UEFI mode to install bootloader?
2016-09-18 13:37:04	minimalism	you can't boot gentoo as UEFI with gentoo media other than the livedvd
2016-09-18 13:37:09	minimalism	at least during install
2016-09-18 13:37:14	minimalism	you can install gentoo with any foreign media
2016-09-18 13:37:21	minimalism	I use archiso since it's UEFI bootable
2016-09-18 13:37:52	alyptik	ah good to know incase i do use it on main system
2016-09-18 13:39:30	minimalism	archiso is usable for both, so it's pretty convenient
2016-09-18 13:39:45	minimalism	some people recommend systemrescuecd, but it's a pos imo
2016-09-18 13:39:45		[13:39]
2016-09-18 13:39:53	minimalism	can't get it to work correctly since it's primarily x86
2016-09-18 13:40:32	alyptik	how do you install it from archiso? just mount loop and chroot or something?
2016-09-18 13:40:48	minimalism	well it's because gentoo is mostly a remote thing
2016-09-18 13:41:00	minimalism	you just need a bootable nix environment where you can curl, mount, chroot, wget etc.
2016-09-18 13:41:14	minimalism	it's basically mkdir /mnt/gentoo from the archiso
2016-09-18 13:41:17	alyptik	oh so it's mostly curl stuff cool
2016-09-18 13:41:17	minimalism	cd to it
2016-09-18 13:41:24	minimalism	pull the stage3 archive
2016-09-18 13:41:32	minimalism	extract the way it explains to retain all permissions and such
2016-09-18 13:41:41	minimalism	and then you eventually chroot and start formatting disks, etc.
2016-09-18 13:41:55	alyptik	ah ok not that bad
2016-09-18 13:45:24	alyptik	qemu networking is such a pita
2016-09-18 13:45:35	alyptik	i eventually gave up and installed libvirtd
2016-09-18 13:47:13	hekel	boobies.

2016-09-18 14:47:31	alyptik	i can just add gentoo to it right? same with efistub?
2016-09-18 14:47:34	minimalism	they sound "made up" to be honest
2016-09-18 14:47:39	alyptik	i am pretty sure it works like that

2016-09-18 14:47:56	alyptik	welp nothing like trying and finding out
2016-09-18 14:48:18	minimalism	I thought refind looked for existing boot loaders or something
2016-09-18 14:48:33	mnrmnaugh	lawlz
2016-09-18 14:48:37	alyptik	minimalism: it is just automation of efi shell commands
2016-09-18 14:48:45	alyptik	also can chainload, but fuck that
2016-09-18 14:49:03	minimalism	well I only keep one installation really.. except for right now while I'm switching to gentoo and practicing
2016-09-18 14:49:09	minimalism	efibootmgr's one entry is ideal
2016-09-18 14:49:14	mnrmnaugh	you should be able to just smoosh gentoo in. i dun see why not....
2016-09-18 14:49:37	alyptik	well worst case i can just reinstall refind from archiso i guess
2016-09-18 14:49:43	alyptik	lol smoosh
2016-09-18 14:49:57	mnrmnaugh	:p
2016-09-18 14:50:20	mnrmnaugh	yar. liveisos are so gooood
2016-09-18 14:50:24	alyptik	from gentoo forums:
2016-09-18 14:50:26	alyptik	"PostPosted: Thu Nov 21, 2013 2:29 pm Post subject: Reply with quote There is precisely one OS installation task that requires a boot in EFI mode to accomplish: registering the boot loader with the firmware.

2016-09-18 14:50:44	alyptik	so it seems it's ok as long as i don't touch refind
2016-09-18 14:51:38	mnrmnaugh	hopefully? ive never used efi though :p

2016-09-18 15:29:09	mnrmnaugh	well, if you dont go to forums, whats the harm?
2016-09-18 15:29:12	hekel	especially since most of the shit you buy on there can be added to your steam inventory for free
2016-09-18 15:29:54	mnrmnaugh	email gunk id guess? ive never joined a forum...
2016-09-18 15:30:59	hekel	I try to remember to get a lot of shit on gog or hb before purchasing it on steam so I can have the steam benefits and a DRM-Free version

2016-09-18 15:32:34	minimalism	because steam is cancer
2016-09-18 15:32:39	hekel	lol
2016-09-18 15:32:47	NextHendrix	you can't transfer them
2016-09-18 15:33:02	hekel	unfortunately you can only add your gog games to steam, not the other way around
2016-09-18 15:33:45	minimalism	yeah..
2016-09-18 15:33:49	minimalism	I love what gog appears to be doing

2016-09-18 15:37:00	minimalism	How exactly does gog work, because there's a ton of AUR packages for gog games
2016-09-18 15:37:08	minimalism	Do you enter a key?
2016-09-18 15:37:29	hekel	you'll need to have the gog zip/tar from the gog site
2016-09-18 15:37:35	hekel	with the pkgbuild
2016-09-18 15:37:51	hekel	and it'll just build a package that installs it to /*
2016-09-18 15:39:27	minimalism	ah I see.. reading the AUR pkgbuild now
2016-09-18 15:39:32	minimalism	just manages the tar you get from gog
2016-09-18 15:39:51	minimalism	So if you have that tar, it doesn't require any verification whatsoever that you own it?

2016-09-18 15:51:20	minimalism	instead of stealing it
2016-09-18 15:51:21	hekel	yup yup
2016-09-18 15:51:40	minimalism	I'm probably still going to wait until steam crumbles and there's some way to migrate
2016-09-18 15:51:48	minimalism	maybe gog can come up with another deal with publishers better than gog connect
2016-09-18 15:51:50	hekel	that's why I try to remember to buy the drm free versions and then add them to my steam instead of just buyign shit on steam
2016-09-18 15:52:24	hekel	gog connect? is that the steam-linked thing?
2016-09-18 15:52:30	hekel	or is that HB I'm thinking of?
2016-09-18 15:52:38	minimalism	it's where they can view your list of games on steam
2016-09-18 15:52:43	minimalism	the account is linked to gog
2016-09-18 15:52:46	minimalism	amd they let you have said games on gog
2016-09-18 15:52:49	hekel	kk, then it is what I'm thinking of
2016-09-18 15:53:07	hekel	wasn't sure if it was HB of GOG that offered that
2016-09-18 15:53:21	minimalism	I'm not sure.. humble might too
2016-09-18 15:53:42	minimalism	I just remember dosbox exists

2016-09-19 15:29:49	javaisnom	In late 2007, he became Internet-famous when he caught the attention of 4chan and Encyclopedia Dramatica. Initial fascination was spurred on by his signature homemade Sonichu medallion, his childlike artwork featuring his unoriginal Sonic recolor, and his history of loitering in public places while literally holding up a sign asking women to talk to him. His reaction to the ensuing mockery led to a 
2016-09-19 15:29:55	javaisnom	spiral of ever greater scrutiny of his life, revealing more disturbing facts about him.

2016-09-19 15:55:07	minimalism	desktop profile isn't necessary unless you're using a serious DE like gnome or kde
2016-09-19 15:55:15	minimalism	you can just use the plain profile #1 in the list

2016-09-19 15:55:49	alyptik	10 more pkgs to emerge
2016-09-19 15:55:51	minimalism	just don't expect your first installation to be your last
2016-09-19 15:55:52	alyptik	might as well finish

2016-09-19 15:58:05	minimalism	verify things actually work as intended

2016-09-20 16:18:09	NextHendrix	it

2016-09-20 16:18:14	hackerhercules	you mean mandrakes?
2016-09-20 16:18:29	hackerhercules	we call them quaaludes, or ludes, if that's what you mean
2016-09-20 16:18:31	NextHendrix	pinged out the wazoo cunt

2016-09-20 16:19:05	hackerhercules	those are mollies
2016-09-20 16:19:26	NextHendrix	pinging keys in the SU bopping about but waint feeling it so dipped off
2016-09-20 16:19:46	NextHendrix	now sat rar chilling at yard
2016-09-20 16:20:51	hackerhercules	can't say I ever felt it any time I was bopping about any SU anywhere
2016-09-20 16:20:52	alyptik	i am trying really hard to follow this convo
2016-09-20 16:20:53	NextHendrix	flatmate begged the rest of my bag but bumped it off and rolled i expect he'll be raged when he claps back
2016-09-20 16:20:56	javaisnom	Mollies?
2016-09-20 16:20:58	alyptik	but it is no use
2016-09-20 16:21:07	hackerhercules	it's seriously not that hard
2016-09-20 16:21:14	javaisnom	aww fuck yeah get L I T in the C L I T mah niggaaa
2016-09-20 16:21:16	hackerhercules	and I'm not even British
2016-09-20 16:21:16	alyptik	wtf is an SU
2016-09-20 16:21:26	NextHendrix	students union
2016-09-20 16:21:29	hackerhercules	contextually I'd assume student union
2016-09-20 16:21:32	hackerhercules	oh hey lookit there
2016-09-20 16:21:39	alyptik	oh ok
2016-09-20 16:21:39	NextHendrix	yeah hh knows
2016-09-20 16:21:51	NextHendrix	hackerhercules: safe bruv
2016-09-20 16:21:51	hackerhercules	so when he said "pinging keys" probably meant "bouncing off the walls" or "keyed up on drugs", depending on the context... I'm betting he meant the former 
2016-09-20 16:22:08	hackerhercules	so he was in the Student Union just kind of chillin, but he got bored
2016-09-20 16:22:10	alyptik	i always just say rolling balls
2016-09-20 16:22:13	hackerhercules	so he went somewhere else
2016-09-20 16:22:35	hackerhercules	then the person he shares rented space with begged for the rest of his recreational materials
2016-09-20 16:22:43	NextHendrix	yes
2016-09-20 16:22:47	NextHendrix	mug
2016-09-20 16:22:51	hackerhercules	but NH took it all, cause fuck his flatmate, and left
2016-09-20 16:22:59	alyptik	lol
2016-09-20 16:23:03	hackerhercules	so he suspects said flat mate will be agitated when...
2016-09-20 16:23:13	hackerhercules	he talks to NH next.
2016-09-20 16:23:16	NextHendrix	hackerhercules: almost, theres some left

2016-09-20 16:36:36	hackerhercules	it works more or less as good as realtime for fluid jam sessions
2016-09-20 16:36:37	alyptik	ah
2016-09-20 16:36:50	NextHendrix	get no latency (technically) by delaying everyoes input by the same amount
2016-09-20 16:36:56	hackerhercules	honestly it was working pretty good if we just had a set thing going
2016-09-20 16:37:00	NextHendrix	and syncing everyone up to a metronome#
2016-09-20 16:37:09	hackerhercules	that's why for a few measures it sounded like it was perfect

2016-09-20 16:44:48	tortib	send yourself a wire transfer
2016-09-20 16:44:49	tortib	BAM
2016-09-20 16:44:57	NextHendrix	or just go ATM
2016-09-20 16:44:59	tortib	no
2016-09-20 16:45:02	alyptik	inb4 tortib goes broke, loses house, sells self on corner
2016-09-20 16:45:02	tortib	then it does cash advance
2016-09-20 16:45:14	tortib	if you use a ATM it's a higher rate
2016-09-20 16:45:23	 *	NextHendrix doesn't use credit cards at all
2016-09-20 16:45:30	tortib	if you use wire transfer it's $20 for the wire then it charges your CC like a regular transaction
2016-09-20 16:45:32	tortib	you should man
2016-09-20 16:45:36	tortib	they give you a huge advantage

2016-09-21 15:53:38	minimalism	lol
2016-09-21 15:54:11	minimalism	I think everyone knows by now that installing gentoo isn't just installation and following the handbook. It really is a whole fucking thing, and you might as well call it a quest.
2016-09-21 15:54:37	alyptik	yep
2016-09-21 15:54:44	minimalism	I ended up learning more about coreutils and util-linux commands today while also reading more of Linux Sea.
2016-09-21 15:54:48	alyptik	first journey i got eaten by the troll
2016-09-21 15:54:51	alyptik	oh well

2016-09-21 15:57:11	minimalism	I don't think you can get the full benefit if you try to cram it all at once
2016-09-21 15:57:20	minimalism	you have to read maybe 2 chapters at a time, then try out some of the things you've read
2016-09-21 15:58:04	minimalism	My favorite command I've learned today (not from Linux Sea, but from the tangent it sent me on) is lsinitcpio

2016-09-21 16:01:16	NextHendrix	lets you bookmark folders and jump about with them
2016-09-21 16:01:19	alyptik	how do you jump tho
2016-09-21 16:01:30	NextHendrix	minimalism: you maybe misinformed mate
2016-09-21 16:01:34	javaisnom	How can pwd replace cd? wtf
2016-09-21 16:01:40	NextHendrix	it can't
2016-09-21 16:01:42	minimalism	it doesn't
2016-09-21 16:01:48	alyptik	wat
2016-09-21 16:01:54	minimalism	type pwd in your term
2016-09-21 16:02:06	alyptik	i know but i am confused with relation to pushd lol
2016-09-21 16:02:09	NextHendrix	yeah that doesnt do anything like what popd pushd or dirs do minimalism 
2016-09-21 16:02:09	javaisnom	I know exactly what it does, that's why I'm wondering
2016-09-21 16:02:38	alyptik	which pwd
2016-09-21 16:02:44	alyptik	'dirs; pushd 
2016-09-21 16:03:20	alyptik	i aliased my nano='vim'
2016-09-21 16:03:20		[16:03]
2016-09-21 16:03:24	alyptik	so anything is possible
2016-09-21 16:03:56	javaisnom	but how do you startup vim then
2016-09-21 16:04:15	javaisnom	inb4 ./bin/vim
2016-09-21 16:04:26	alyptik	alias v='vim -p'
2016-09-21 16:04:44	NextHendrix	i have vi, vim and nvim all symlinked to nvim
2016-09-21 16:04:48	javaisnom	q u a l i t y 
2016-09-21 16:04:55	NextHendrix	theres an aur package that does it
2016-09-21 16:05:01	NextHendrix	pretty good
2016-09-21 16:05:08	javaisnom	that sounds pragmatic as fuck
2016-09-21 16:06:19	minimalism	seems easier to just alias it
2016-09-21 16:06:20	alyptik	minimalism: is reading about popd now i bet 
2016-09-21 16:06:52	NextHendrix	nah cos then it works everywhere instead of just in shell
2016-09-21 16:06:54	javaisnom	Better than me, I haven't even started reading about it
2016-09-21 16:07:04	NextHendrix	anything that calls vim or vi loads neovim with muh preseets
2016-09-21 16:07:10	NextHendrix	and config etc
2016-09-21 16:07:18	javaisnom	I assume it connects you to an internet dating service for hot mILFS via telnet?
2016-09-21 16:07:40	alyptik	there is also cd (~+,~-1,~+2}

2016-09-21 16:33:29		[16:33]
2016-09-21 16:33:32	minimalism	like signal or something similar
2016-09-21 16:33:47	alyptik	nah i use boring stock
2016-09-21 16:34:05	alyptik	so i can use Wifi calling
2016-09-21 16:35:32	alyptik	not having to use initramfs is nice; i could get used to this
2016-09-21 16:35:36	alyptik	once it works i mean
2016-09-21 16:35:36	minimalism	wifi calling?
2016-09-21 16:35:54	alyptik	minimalism: calls use wifi instead of phone network
2016-09-21 16:36:01	alyptik	not sure exact protocol specss
2016-09-21 16:36:15	alyptik	saves minutes
2016-09-21 16:36:37	minimalism	That's what I wanted to ask about, actually
2016-09-21 16:36:48	minimalism	I don't currently use mobile service because in Canada it's outrageous and somewhat pointless
2016-09-21 16:37:04	alyptik	oh my provider provides it, but it only works on stock/modified stock ROMs
2016-09-21 16:37:08	minimalism	When you make calls over wifi, are you using your actual phone number registered with your carrier?
2016-09-21 16:37:18	alyptik	it depends on your phone company, and yes you are
2016-09-21 16:37:44	alyptik	only change is the transmission method; you can make call with no service if you wanted to
2016-09-21 16:37:49	minimalism	so you people using signal and voip apps are getting pretty low end plans just to get a number registered
2016-09-21 16:37:51	minimalism	then you call over wifi?
2016-09-21 16:38:07	alyptik	i think they are different
2016-09-21 16:38:18	alyptik	call over wifi isn't voip afaik
2016-09-21 16:38:19	minimalism	I'm trying to find a way to keep my existing phone number
2016-09-21 16:38:23	minimalism	and make calls over wifi
2016-09-21 16:38:43	alyptik	minimalism: also it has to be a wifi network of your ISP
2016-09-21 16:38:49	alyptik	so my home router only pretty much
2016-09-21 16:39:08	alyptik	it's not amazing by any means
2016-09-21 16:39:49	alyptik	minimalism: you should probably ask your cell provider about this stuff, they vary based on company
2016-09-21 16:40:30	minimalism	don't have one atm
2016-09-21 16:40:38	minimalism	I'm being og with a landline just to say I have a number
2016-09-21 16:41:12	alyptik	oh
2016-09-21 16:41:17	alyptik	you want to keep landline #?
2016-09-21 16:43:42	minimalism	yeah, but in Canada they let you transfer a landline # to the mobile services
2016-09-21 16:44:12	alyptik	ah i see
2016-09-21 16:44:51	alyptik	not sure if VoIP can have cell #, though i would assume not unless it somehow uses your SIM card info
2016-09-21 16:45:04	alyptik	since that is what determines your #
2016-09-21 16:45:58	minimalism	what app are you using to make wifi calls?
2016-09-21 16:46:28	alyptik	minimalism: it is the android system that does it, so if you swap to CM for example it is gone
2016-09-21 16:46:43	minimalism	why is that
2016-09-21 16:46:43	alyptik	i think it's tmo proprietary 
2016-09-21 16:46:59	alyptik	could be wrong
2016-09-21 16:47:25	alyptik	same thing happens on Samsung TW
2016-09-21 16:47:29	alyptik	no TW no wifi calling
2016-09-21 16:47:53	alyptik	xda has been trying to reverse engineer it for years
2016-09-21 16:52:25	minimalism	I need to find something I can use on copperhead
2016-09-21 16:52:25		[16:52]

2016-09-21 16:53:30	alyptik	phones can be a pita if your manufacturer isn't huge like samsung  
2016-09-21 16:53:40	javaisnom	oh boy compile errors for jammr
2016-09-21 16:53:55	minimalism	I'm using a Nexus 5
2016-09-21 16:54:53	alyptik	oh why copperhead? just something you want to do?
2016-09-21 16:55:57	alyptik	not sure if stock nexus even has wifi calling, only seen it on TW and LG
2016-09-21 16:56:46	minimalism	I already use copperhead
2016-09-21 16:57:00	alyptik	google ships that default now?
2016-09-21 16:57:03	minimalism	what a mess this is.. mobile service is a mess here, and landlines are already becoming a pain
2016-09-21 16:57:17	minimalism	because everyone's moving to voip powered phone services they brand as landlines
2016-09-21 16:57:27	minimalism	and it gets annoying because they have to place a modem in your place to use it
2016-09-21 16:57:36	minimalism	or make you connect ATAs to your modem and run wires everywhere
2016-09-21 16:57:50	alyptik	damn
2016-09-21 16:57:52	minimalism	nothing to do with google

2016-09-22 02:10:28	phillid	tigr gets pretty mad whenever anyone says "retarded" to mean anything except inellectually handicapped

2016-09-22 02:10:43	alyptik	.-.
2016-09-22 02:10:56	phillid	So, "retard the fire" she's okay with but not "that build system is retarded"
2016-09-22 02:11:01	phillid	She'll kick ya, often
2016-09-22 02:11:15	alyptik	retard the fire wat
2016-09-22 02:11:23	alyptik	like slow the fire?
2016-09-22 02:11:32	phillid	Fire retardant is a term
2016-09-22 02:11:41	phillid	Yes
2016-09-22 02:11:43	alyptik	oh hm, never heard it before
2016-09-22 02:12:04	phillid	it's used a lot in building materials and electronics and stuff
2016-09-22 02:12:18	phillid	Like fire retardant insulation and stuff
2016-09-22 02:12:29	alyptik	oh ok so ! flammable
2016-09-22 02:12:33	phillid	I think maybe it's more commonly called "fire-proof" in some places in the world
2016-09-22 02:12:57	phillid	yeah not flammable
2016-09-22 02:13:10	phillid	"fire-proof" is a bit of a misnomer, often
2016-09-22 02:13:20	alyptik	anything burns at high temp
2016-09-22 02:13:23	alyptik	i mean anything
2016-09-22 02:13:27	phillid	True dat
2016-09-22 02:13:58	phillid	And people often call stuff fireproof that isn't anywhere near proof at all, even
2016-09-22 02:14:08	phillid	Like insulation on electrical cables
2016-09-22 02:14:37	phillid	It's not fire proof; it will burn if you keep a flame to it long enough, but it won't sustain a burn if you remove the ignition source
2016-09-22 02:14:59	phillid	Wow what a tangent \o/
2016-09-22 02:15:18	phillid	This is supposed to be a hive of scum and villainy, but we're often more polite than the flip side

2016-09-22 12:48:48	alyptik	even with kvm and 4gb ram it is slow as hell
2016-09-22 12:48:57	alyptik	the compiling i mean
2016-09-22 12:49:08	yourname1	give it 16 gb ram and all your cpu silly
2016-09-22 12:49:21	alyptik	i did, -cpu host and -smp
2016-09-22 12:49:31	alyptik	i have 8GB ram, shouldnt be too much of a diff
2016-09-22 12:49:48	yourname1	I SAID 16 GIGABYTES OF RAM, ALYPTIK. 
2016-09-22 12:49:52	yourname1	imean thats ok
2016-09-22 12:49:56	alyptik	i don't have QQ
2016-09-22 12:49:59	pr0ph	must be nice though used to start compiling before i'd start my comp sci class, then i'd try and do the class finish the homework and drive home before it'd finish
2016-09-22 12:50:02	alyptik	my laptop only has 8GB
2016-09-22 12:50:15	yourname1	riop

2016-09-22 12:50:27	alyptik	indeed
2016-09-22 12:51:04	yourname1	so how much more intuitive is Gentoo over arch?
2016-09-22 12:51:44	alyptik	yourname1: gentoo is just arch with compiling vs binaries
2016-09-22 12:51:57	alyptik	seriously not that much harder, but you do learn a bit more
2016-09-22 12:52:13	alyptik	openrc is a nice change 
2016-09-22 12:52:56	minimalism	Did you configure your own kernel, change USE flags in your /etc/portage settings and learn all the various tools for portage?
2016-09-22 12:53:15	alyptik	minimalism: i can't compile kernel, not enough memory
2016-09-22 12:53:18	alyptik	have to use iso kernel
2016-09-22 12:53:36	yourname1	minimalism: I know some of those terms
2016-09-22 12:53:51	alyptik	minimalism: and yeah i did configuration of USE flags though
2016-09-22 12:53:56	yourname1	like 'did', and 'the'
2016-09-22 12:53:57	pr0ph	oh u have memory just use a gigantic swap partition 

2016-09-22 12:54:45	yourname1	what hekel? are you gonna talk about how huuge your swap partition is? about how you're gonna fill up someone's disk and ram?
2016-09-22 12:54:50	minimalism	my experience shot me in the dick since I used hardened profile
2016-09-22 12:54:56	minimalism	made some programs just really difficult to get working
2016-09-22 12:55:00	alyptik	lol
2016-09-22 12:55:06	hekel	O_o
2016-09-22 12:55:06	alyptik	is that SELInux?
2016-09-22 12:55:09	minimalism	and no sound by default because the default subdevice setting didn't like my audio
2016-09-22 12:55:14	minimalism	it's a whole bunch of things
2016-09-22 12:55:15	alyptik	or somethingelse 
2016-09-22 12:55:17	alyptik	ah
2016-09-22 12:55:20	hekel	RAM > SWAP
2016-09-22 12:55:26	minimalism	restrictions on software you can install based on USE flags
2016-09-22 12:55:28	minimalism	sandboxing
2016-09-22 12:55:30	yourname1	**SWAP > RAM
2016-09-22 12:55:32	minimalism	a lot of various features set in portage
2016-09-22 12:55:45	 *	hekel smacks yourname1 
2016-09-22 12:55:48	minimalism	it also uses hardened-sources for kernel which includes grsec/pax and also selinux if you want it
2016-09-22 12:55:57	--	yourname1 is now known as javaisnom
2016-09-22 12:55:58	alyptik	oh god grsec
2016-09-22 12:56:08	javaisnom	when you use the wrong startup script and it doesn't set your nick
2016-09-22 12:56:15	alyptik	i would die from trying to use that
2016-09-22 12:56:20	alyptik	not disciplined enough
2016-09-22 12:56:29	minimalism	yeah that's why my next install will be default, so I can get used to gentoo in a normal setting
2016-09-22 12:56:37	minimalism	and then I can start with the hardened masochism
2016-09-22 12:56:47	javaisnom	lol

2016-09-22 21:27:07	alyptik	true enough for reddit, but i always felt like 4chan was like tasting the darkweb
2016-09-22 21:27:11	alyptik	i liked that about it
2016-09-22 21:27:36	NextHendrix	free speech
2016-09-22 21:28:02	NextHendrix	plenty of weird shit, but easy to ignore
2016-09-22 21:28:07	alyptik	yep
2016-09-22 21:28:19	minimalism	4chan sucks now
2016-09-22 21:28:25	alyptik	it seems that way
2016-09-22 21:28:33	minimalism	it's not the same people using it, it's become pretty common among people
2016-09-22 21:28:46	minimalism	and it's not as free as it used to be, but it's better now that moot isn't running it
2016-09-22 21:28:56	minimalism	but hiro is definitely data mining the fuck out of it
2016-09-22 21:29:01	minimalism	main problem is all VPN ranges are banned basically
2016-09-22 21:29:05	minimalism	captchas every post
2016-09-22 21:29:17	minimalism	and you need a 4chan pass to post through all of that, and that destroys anonymity
2016-09-22 21:29:36	alyptik	jesus /b/ is bad now
2016-09-22 21:29:47	minimalism	I wish /g/ was still the board of gentoomen
2016-09-22 21:29:50	minimalism	it clearly isn't anymore
2016-09-22 21:29:58	minimalism	now it's all ubuntu scrubs that just started using tilers
2016-09-22 21:30:01	minimalism	and basic archers
2016-09-22 21:30:03	alyptik	lol
2016-09-22 21:30:30	NextHendrix	yeah /g/ is basicaly archlords
2016-09-22 21:30:39	alyptik	minimalism: oh and linux sea is pretty awesome
2016-09-22 21:31:38	minimalism	it is
2016-09-22 21:31:39	NextHendrix	/fit/ is the key
2016-09-22 21:31:51	NextHendrix	and /pol/
2016-09-22 21:31:52	minimalism	Like I was saying, it covers a lot of knowledge gaps with things we use on nix every day
2016-09-22 21:32:00	alyptik	lol /pol/
2016-09-22 21:32:09	minimalism	 /pol/ is still hilarious
2016-09-22 21:32:14	minimalism	they're 100% serious and fuck everyone up
2016-09-22 21:32:20	NextHendrix	yeah its entertainment
2016-09-22 21:32:34	minimalism	they were chiefly responsible for ruining Tay lol
2016-09-22 21:33:02	NextHendrix	the whole pepe making the news thing is amazing
2016-09-22 21:33:29	alyptik	You're low-IQ
2016-09-22 21:33:29	alyptik	1. The "souring" of relations happened during Bush, not Obama
2016-09-22 21:33:29	alyptik	2. USA and Russia have fundamentally opposed interests, meaning any rapprochement is only temporary
2016-09-22 21:33:29	alyptik	Get learned you dumb sack of nigger
2016-09-22 21:33:32	alyptik	lol
2016-09-22 21:33:35	NextHendrix	american news is totally ridiculous for even touching it

2016-09-22 22:20:19	minimalism	I liked the old untracked title rewards for unwritten goals
2016-09-22 22:20:31	minimalism	achievements are WoW systemd
2016-09-22 22:20:49	javaisnom	kek

2016-09-22 22:34:00	minimalism	About to watch the worst movie of 2016.
2016-09-22 22:38:25	alyptik	Lost: the Prequel?
2016-09-22 22:38:38	minimalism	Angry Birds
2016-09-22 22:38:44	alyptik	lol wut
2016-09-22 22:39:03	javaisnom	?
2016-09-22 22:39:11	javaisnom	world of warcraft?
2016-09-22 22:39:29	javaisnom	*the game up to the last couple of years, the newest expansion / community = G R 8 ;)
2016-09-22 22:39:38	tortib	they made warcraft to acurate to the game
2016-09-22 22:39:42	tortib	so unless you play the game
2016-09-22 22:39:43	minimalism	it went to hell after wrath
2016-09-22 22:39:46	minimalism	we all need to admit that
2016-09-22 22:39:46	tortib	you wont know who any of these people are
2016-09-22 22:39:57	tortib	minimalism: agreed
2016-09-22 22:40:04	javaisnom	truth
2016-09-22 22:42:14	minimalism	At the very least, it feels like they're just using the angry birds IP to make a familiar design
2016-09-22 22:42:14		[22:42]
2016-09-22 22:42:24	javaisnom	in WOW?
2016-09-22 22:42:24	minimalism	but make their own thing really, not so much just a copy of the game
2016-09-22 22:42:39	minimalism	no, I'm watching Angry Birds
2016-09-22 22:42:44	javaisnom	!grab minimalism 
2016-09-22 22:42:44	phrik	javaisnom: Tada!
2016-09-22 22:42:49	minimalism	you motherfucker
2016-09-22 22:42:52	javaisnom	:3
2016-09-22 22:44:15	javaisnom	inb5 baby thrall's riverbasket flips over and he drowns
2016-09-22 22:44:28	minimalism	ye he ded
2016-09-22 22:44:35	minimalism	but they totally set up a sequel
2016-09-22 22:44:44	minimalism	they even titled it : The Beginning
2016-09-22 22:44:49	minimalism	so it's gonna be a trilogy
2016-09-22 22:44:55	javaisnom	lmao he growls at the human
2016-09-22 22:45:05	javaisnom	9 out of fucking 11 no way this is a one off
2016-09-22 22:45:53	minimalism	would be cool if they make a Warcraft IV based on the cinematic for WoW
2016-09-22 22:45:58	minimalism	the drums of war and all the shit going down
2016-09-22 22:46:02	tortib	well they made Mehdiv a huge bad ass
2016-09-22 22:46:05	javaisnom	y e s 
2016-09-22 22:47:45	javaisnom	if this movie didn't especially make me want to pick up the original games again and seriously finish them, am I a lost cause
2016-09-22 22:48:02	tortib	yes
2016-09-22 22:48:08	tortib	just accidently kill yourself 
2016-09-22 22:48:09	minimalism	if they made the games available for Linux, I'd play them
2016-09-22 22:48:19	tortib	all warcraft games run in wine perfectly
2016-09-22 22:48:22	tortib	so there is no excuse
2016-09-22 22:48:25	javaisnom	well fuck adding this to my list of reasons to kms
2016-09-22 22:48:27	javaisnom	:)
2016-09-22 22:48:30	javaisnom	:)
2016-09-22 22:48:30	minimalism	wine is an abomination
2016-09-22 22:48:49	tortib	lol
2016-09-22 22:48:53	javaisnom	idk, tortib can test it on OSX
2016-09-22 22:48:55	tortib	commands son just got pwned
2016-09-22 22:48:56	javaisnom	;)
2016-09-22 22:49:06	minimalism	blizz needs to port them to C
2016-09-22 22:49:09	minimalism	and make them cross-platform
2016-09-22 22:49:15	minimalism	they were recruiting people to do that anyway
2016-09-22 22:49:16	javaisnom	what are they written in? Go?
2016-09-22 22:49:16	javaisnom	lmao
2016-09-22 22:49:26	minimalism	but I think they're just going to bs us
2016-09-22 22:49:34	minimalism	and just release a remastered/HD version for newer resolutions
2016-09-22 22:49:39	minimalism	not a proper cross-platform release
2016-09-22 22:49:51	minimalism	they'd be idiots to prioritize windows again.. nix based systems are the future
2016-09-22 22:49:54	javaisnom	right?
2016-09-22 22:50:05	minimalism	at the very least, if you make it for linux
2016-09-22 22:50:08	minimalism	you can easily get it going on osx
2016-09-22 22:50:12	minimalism	but if it's windows to osx
2016-09-22 22:50:14	minimalism	holy fucking fuck
2016-09-22 22:50:29	tortib	if they are going to port to C++ or C they may as well update the graphics and textures too
2016-09-22 22:50:34	javaisnom	and they'd make a shit more mooney off of subs (if they do the same for WoW) considering how clunky wine can be at times and how many linux users either played or formerly played wow
2016-09-22 22:50:40	minimalism	tortib: I think that's what they're doing
2016-09-22 22:50:51	minimalism	I'm just saying they'll probably fuck us over and just keep it on Windows/OSX as usual
2016-09-22 22:51:05	tortib	probably
2016-09-22 22:51:20	minimalism	and fuck you for mentioning wine to me
2016-09-22 22:51:30	tortib	yeah well fuck you toooo

2016-09-23 13:11:36	minimalism	internet says estrogen blockers, exercise, and surgery
2016-09-23 13:11:43	tortib	NextHendrix: no not getting injections by pieces of shit prevents getting further bitch tits

2016-09-23 15:02:32	tortib	if they didn't want to help you why would they help you in a pinch
2016-09-23 15:02:45	tortib	and if they don't want to hurt you then why would they hurt the feels by throwing dirt on me

2016-09-24 21:58:57	javaisnom	exactly
2016-09-24 21:58:59	minimalism	There's always some contingency loop
2016-09-24 21:59:03	Lehvyn	hekel: and do what? 
2016-09-24 21:59:06	hekel	and Suspend your drivers license
2016-09-24 21:59:08	javaisnom	fine you to death

2016-09-24 21:59:31	Lehvyn	How're they gonna suspend something you don't have?
2016-09-24 21:59:40	hekel	I was 15 when the Judge suspended my drivers license till I was 18 for skippign school
2016-09-24 21:59:51	hekel	I couldn't get it at 16 or 17
2016-09-24 21:59:52	Lehvyn	Plenty of people drive without, anyway
2016-09-24 22:00:03	hekel	HAD to wait till 18.5
2016-09-24 22:00:07	javaisnom	I guess so.. Still, avoiding jail, intense penalties for your parents, etc.
2016-09-24 22:00:14	hekel	and gto several hundred dollars in fines
2016-09-24 22:00:24	minimalism	Just go to school and find some loophole to get around your backlog
2016-09-24 22:00:27	javaisnom	homelessness, insurance
2016-09-24 22:00:28	hekel	and the Judge was easy on me because he knew me
2016-09-24 22:01:16	Lehvyn	you heathens
2016-09-24 22:01:16	hekel	only fined/cited me for like 6 days... could have done it for something like 45
2016-09-24 22:01:33	hekel	and could have legally suspended my license will I was in my 30s iirc
2016-09-24 22:01:48	hekel	till*
2016-09-24 22:02:17	Lehvyn	I don't think I've ever had any issues with school
2016-09-24 22:02:18	javaisnom	get around my backlog in what way? 
2016-09-24 22:02:21	Lehvyn	I did quit in 10th, though
2016-09-24 22:02:39	hekel	lel
2016-09-24 22:02:39	javaisnom	eh, I'm too stupid to learn anything
2016-09-24 22:02:48	minimalism	javaisnom: I don't know.. Maybe negotiate something with them to do some test to get around having to do all the busy work?
2016-09-24 22:03:36	javaisnom	>too stupid to learn anything >ability to complete an exit exam
2016-09-24 22:03:40	minimalism	I honestly don't know why they care except for just passing final exams
2016-09-24 22:03:47	Lehvyn	though, I've been with the same company for nearly 13 yrs
2016-09-24 22:04:04	hekel	I dropped out in 11th
2016-09-24 22:04:16	hekel	because I had liek no classes
2016-09-24 22:04:22	hekel	it was boring
2016-09-24 22:04:38	Lehvyn	They kept teaching the same shit
2016-09-24 22:04:43	Lehvyn	In 10th, learn 9th.. etc
2016-09-24 22:04:45	javaisnom	prettym uch
2016-09-24 22:04:55	hekel	just study-hall all day, even smokign pot in the bathroom didn't make it much more bearable
2016-09-24 22:05:06	javaisnom	and yet I seem to get a looser grasp on even basic things like math on paper as the years go on.
2016-09-24 22:05:11	Lehvyn	Since like 7th.. I was just waiting til I could drop out. Did.
2016-09-24 22:05:20	javaisnom	given I hadn't practiced in probably a year
2016-09-24 22:06:09	hekel	heh, in 9th I went to the county tech HS... and because we alternated academics 1 week and shop the next week they had us ahead of all the regular highschools
2016-09-24 22:06:39	hekel	then 10th I went back to the local school and had already more-ore-less done their 10th grade classes
2016-09-24 22:06:54	hekel	so they gave me 11th classes and maybe 1 10th class
2016-09-24 22:07:08	hekel	and 11th was a couple 12th classes
2016-09-24 22:07:21	hekel	and a fuckton of study halls

2016-09-24 22:21:55	Lehvyn	I didn't have any, but as I said, I had  stuff lined up. The friends mom got me on in her company, paid me under the table until I was 16. She signed the apt lease for me, then I had it re-done later in my name.
2016-09-24 22:22:10	javaisnom	what kind of company?
2016-09-24 22:22:53	Lehvyn	construction

2016-09-24 22:34:40	Lehvyn	meh, I don't mind being a "loser" for dropping out/getting my GED. My bank account looks pretty nice. #fuckem
2016-09-24 22:34:59	hekel	having a diploma isn't really a measure of ability or intelligence

2016-09-24 22:37:11	hekel	but most employers higher based on your "achievements" on paper
2016-09-24 22:37:24	hekel	so you should still probably finish highschool =p
2016-09-24 22:37:29	javaisnom	o

2016-09-24 23:54:54	Lehvyn	Didn't they make one out of a lamp?
2016-09-24 23:55:05	Lehvyn	kinda running outta ideas it seems, if so
2016-09-24 23:55:11	javaisnom	yep, they also have one out of a rock, a purple snake backwards, just a cute armadillo
2016-09-24 23:55:37	Lehvyn	well
2016-09-24 23:55:46	Lehvyn	I meant making one out of an inanimate object

2016-09-24 23:58:39	javaisnom	"A brand new feature of the Pokémon X & Y games are Mega Evolutions. These are special features of Pokémon, different to evolutions and forms, that have your Pokémon Mega Evolve in battle into these appearances. Their abilities, stats and sometimes even types are different. To get a Pokémon to Mega Evolve, they need to be holding a special Mega Stone item unique to their species, as well as 
2016-09-24 23:58:46	javaisnom	receiving the Mega Ring and the Key Stone. To get your Pokémon to Mega Evolve, you can select a button when picking the move and then select a move. The Pokémon will both evolve and attack in that turn. You may only have one Mega Evolution in a battle."

2016-09-24 23:59:34	Lehvyn	>types, kinda a bullshit move, no?
2016-09-24 23:59:51	javaisnom	A bit, but it makes some pokemon, like charizard, actually usable in high-level competitive
2016-09-25 00:00:10	Lehvyn	holy shit the mega's look fucking retarded

2016-09-25 08:46:36	tortib	how do i delete those things
2016-09-25 08:46:57	hackerhercules	you don't
2016-09-25 08:46:59	hackerhercules	I locked them
2016-09-25 08:47:07	hackerhercules	cause I knew you'd be a pussy about it
2016-09-25 08:48:11	tortib	i'm not being "a pussy about it"
2016-09-25 08:48:19	tortib	I find you highly annoying and the shit you do is also annoying
2016-09-25 08:48:28	hackerhercules	hekel doesn't complain that his factoids are offensive to him
2016-09-25 08:48:30	tortib	except when you trolled the feminist, that was good stuff
2016-09-25 08:48:39	hackerhercules	so, yes, you are being "a pussy about it"
2016-09-25 08:48:44	tortib	stfu fag
2016-09-25 08:48:57	hackerhercules	nah, I don't think I will
2016-09-25 08:49:38	hackerhercules	Do you find me annoying because I'm the one person in the world who consistently calls you on your shit?
2016-09-25 08:50:05	tortib	Heh I find people like you hackerhercules interesting and amusing
2016-09-25 08:50:15	tortib	You're one of those people that uses the phrase "call you out"
2016-09-25 08:50:59	tortib	meaning you're intimidated by me, that's why you constantly talk over me while in mumble, and that's why you constantly "call me out" as you say on "my shit"
2016-09-25 08:51:24	tortib	You have something to prove and you think by "calling me out on my shit" is somehow giving you points on the internet
2016-09-25 08:52:06	hackerhercules	I think if anything constantly attacking you makes me look bad to everyone else, bruh
2016-09-25 08:52:06		[08:52]
2016-09-25 08:52:14	tortib	that's where you're wrong
2016-09-25 08:52:28	hackerhercules	So it's improving my standing to attack you?
2016-09-25 08:52:36	tortib	It actually makes you look bad, it makes you look childish and quite stupid because you have to resort to 5 year old name calling and interrupting a person while they speak to get your point across.
2016-09-25 08:52:47	tortib	It's the most sub-human thing you can do
2016-09-25 08:52:49	hackerhercules	Maybe you need to re-read what I said lol
2016-09-25 08:52:50	tortib	and you do it perfectly
2016-09-25 08:53:26	hackerhercules	here I'll post it for you again
2016-09-25 08:53:28	hackerhercules	I think if anything constantly attacking you makes me look bad to everyone else, bruh
2016-09-25 08:53:48	tortib	well if you 'get it' then why do you 'do it'
2016-09-25 08:53:51	tortib	lol man you're weird
2016-09-25 08:54:01	hackerhercules	Good to know that you prove you're so busy formulating your next sentence you don't read what anyone else says
2016-09-25 08:54:12	tortib	hey i was on a roll
2016-09-25 08:54:18	hackerhercules	Not really, but ok
2016-09-25 08:56:04	tortib	I actually read your sentence incorrectly, mixed up me and you
2016-09-25 08:56:39	tortib	so i did read what you said just didn't comprehend it properly
2016-09-25 09:01:04	hackerhercules	idk man, if you want an honest answer
2016-09-25 09:01:34	hackerhercules	You're a decent guy that isn't bad to have around, got some skill and at least half a brain about you, can listen to some feedback selectively
2016-09-25 09:01:47	hackerhercules	But you do this thing where you just take over conversation and make it about you sometimes and shut other people down, and I don't like when people do that
2016-09-25 09:02:00	hackerhercules	Or if you feel like you're being challenged you start cutting people down
2016-09-25 09:02:21	hackerhercules	I was being gently goading about it at first in hopes that you'd realize what was going on, but you'd just keep upping the ante so I did too
2016-09-25 09:02:43	hackerhercules	ffs when javaisnom made their 50th suicide joke and I asked if they were okay the first thing you did was take over the conversation instead of trying to see if the other kid was okay
2016-09-25 09:03:05	hackerhercules	need to think about how unhealthy that kind of behavior is
2016-09-25 09:03:12	hackerhercules	that's all, really
2016-09-25 09:03:18	tortib	ok
2016-09-25 09:03:19	tortib	fair enough
2016-09-25 09:03:21	tortib	I'll work on that
2016-09-25 09:03:57	tortib	but do you think by you taking over the conversation and just saying random weird shit is "good behavior?"
2016-09-25 09:04:16	hackerhercules	Such as?
2016-09-25 09:04:17	tortib	fuck
2016-09-25 09:04:23	tortib	i put water in my tank and now it's fuqed
2016-09-25 09:04:25	tortib	taste like shit
2016-09-25 09:09:00	hackerhercules	Maybe I'm lacking in self-realization, but the only times I consciously take over the conversation is when yall just making butthole jokes and I start asking about what projects people are working on.

2016-09-25 09:22:05	tortib	dunno man
2016-09-25 09:22:13	hackerhercules	did you just lose interest or what
2016-09-25 09:22:14	tortib	sometimes i can put something together that sounds decent
2016-09-25 09:22:18	tortib	sometimes I can't
2016-09-25 09:22:30	hackerhercules	you were on fire there for a few weeks it seemed like
2016-09-25 09:22:37	tortib	yeah then it goes away
2016-09-25 09:22:38	tortib	dunno
2016-09-25 09:22:39	hackerhercules	new track every couple days
2016-09-25 09:22:44	hackerhercules	eh, creative muse, I can get that
2016-09-25 09:22:50	hackerhercules	happens to me with writing
2016-09-25 09:22:52	tortib	I don't think of it like that
2016-09-25 09:22:56	tortib	it's more of a motivation thing
2016-09-25 09:23:00	tortib	and i just look at music as a hobby really
2016-09-25 09:23:05	tortib	anyways I don't like talking about it
2016-09-25 09:23:13	hackerhercules	mmk
2016-09-25 09:23:35	tortib	I can't write
2016-09-25 09:23:43	tortib	well I can write, I can't rhyme worth a shit
2016-09-25 09:23:47	tortib	you saw my rhymes lol
2016-09-25 09:23:54	tortib	I just rhyme every last word
2016-09-25 09:23:56	tortib	it's dumb
2016-09-25 09:24:06	hackerhercules	I spend a lot of time rhyming and mine still sound super dorky haha
2016-09-25 09:24:06		[09:24]
2016-09-25 09:24:14	hackerhercules	just one of those things
2016-09-25 09:24:25	tortib	just use a lot of Similies and metaphors
2016-09-25 09:25:15	hackerhercules	they still sound dorky when I write them :P
2016-09-25 09:25:30	hackerhercules	anyway I was just hounding you about it cause Hendrix and I both liked what you were making there, especially the last few ones
2016-09-25 09:25:35	tortib	just write about fucking bitches and smoking dro
2016-09-25 09:25:41	tortib	that seems to sell well amongst the black folks
2016-09-25 09:26:00	hackerhercules	eh, hobby for me too, not something I want to pursue seriously
2016-09-25 09:26:43	tortib	I like working with synths
2016-09-25 09:26:44	tortib	it's fun
2016-09-25 09:27:20	tortib	someone gave me a couple presets for different styles, like chords, bassline, pad, etc
2016-09-25 09:27:36	tortib	so now i know how to use massive to make those sounds, can just load one of those presets and tweak until i get something I like
2016-09-25 09:29:12	hackerhercules	see that's what I mean, you're good at that shit. I loaded up... something, I don't remember. Pirated a really popular sound production tool... I got the idea of how to use the pianoroll to make good synth music, but the actual practice of loading it up was just too much for me, don't have the patience to invest in it, too hard for me to get right
2016-09-25 09:29:44	tortib	I've made some basslines from scratch
2016-09-25 09:29:57	tortib	but it's just lower octaves and lowpass filters
2016-09-25 09:30:05	hackerhercules	more than I've done lmao
2016-09-25 09:30:21	tortib	nothing really that mind blowingly difficult once you learn what each filter does and how to achieve the sound you want
2016-09-25 09:30:26	tortib	what a LFO and Envelope does
2016-09-25 09:30:49	tortib	there are really good tutorials from Native Instruments (peeps who make the massive synth) on youtuve that explain everything
2016-09-25 09:31:34	tortib	I also use Monark which is nice
2016-09-25 09:31:38	tortib	it's a Moog emulator
2016-09-25 09:31:45	hackerhercules	what's Moog
2016-09-25 09:31:48	tortib	wicked easy to use compared to massive but sometimes it's more complex
2016-09-25 09:32:03	tortib	it's a 80s electronic instrument, analog synth that has been converted to many digital synths now with that same sound
2016-09-25 09:32:31	tortib	you can youtube it and you'll find videos showing examples of the moog sound, you've probably heard it before and just didn't know what it was called
2016-09-25 09:32:49	tortib	and for some reason it's pronounced "mouge" which is so damn stupid because it's spelled Moog MOOg
2016-09-25 09:33:02	tortib	has "MOO" right in the damn name but I guess american spelling doesn't use the accented o

2016-09-27 22:59:30	NextHendrix	[08:32:12] Lehvyn: that works fine, if a long time ago the person said they sold thinmints and the protagonist comes into his shop and has misread one of the signs, only to be corrected verbally by the shopkeeper [08:32:12]

2016-09-27 22:59:30	Lehvyn	[08:33:02] Retired school teacher, tad bit old. Approached by two Special Agents, who clearly introduced themselves as Special Agents and provided their badges. Right after, lady said ^. [08:33:02]

2016-09-28 13:59:40	hekel	cept for a set of HD250s
2016-09-28 14:00:00	hekel	yeah, the HD250 and HD580 have the same pleather pads
2016-09-28 14:00:20	hekel	the HD560 has the same velour pads... but the lockign ring is different
2016-09-28 14:01:21	hekel	you can re-use the HD250/580 locking ring on the HD650 pads.... BUT.. you have to shave about a 1/16th of an inch off the plastic on the pad to make the lockign ring fit
2016-09-28 14:01:40	hekel	1 down, 1 to go
2016-09-28 14:02:24	hekel	only thing is... and I'm prepared for it.. It's probably gonna slightly reduce the bass
2016-09-28 14:03:03	hekel	but the HD250 has strong bass as it is.. and if I don't like it I'll just get another set of actual HD250 pads oen day
2016-09-28 14:05:55	hekel	and a new set of HD250 pads will come with a new set of locking rings, so I'd still be able to swap the pads whenever
2016-09-28 14:08:04	alyptik	i almost got HD250s
2016-09-28 14:08:22	alyptik	but they were out of stock :[ so i settled for AT M50x

2016-09-28 14:11:39	alyptik	hekel: those are the ones
2016-09-28 14:11:49	alyptik	was like last year i think
2016-09-28 14:12:03	hekel	you can still find them on fleabay sometimes... but they go for more than they were originally  o,o
2016-09-28 14:12:14	hekel	yeah, they stopped making them around 2007 iirc
