2016-10-17 19:45:43	gentooinstaller	n11cky, for genkernel set yes for the zfs line in genkernel.conf and for the callback line put "FEATURES=-ccache emerge spl zfs-kmod zfs" and its all good, for modular zfs that works properly anyhow, and if you use a video driver or any other kind of module addon put that in the callback i gave you
2016-10-17 19:46:15	gentooinstaller	like, if you need to compile one from portage i mean, not in-kernel modules that dont depend on external software
2016-10-17 19:46:46	n11cky	gentooinstaller: right on. I already have had the system booting for a while and setup for use with genkernel. I was just asking about getting them out of the @module-rebuild set, now that I don't need the .ko's lying around
2016-10-17 19:47:32	n11cky	I think the real important line for genkernel.conf is ZFS="yes"
2016-10-17 19:47:32		[19:47]
2016-10-17 19:47:37	gentooinstaller	n11cky, i dont know myself but i had some loose files that were making startx think i was still using an older driver so perhaps just try manually rming the .ko files and see if 1. equery still sees them 2. if you remerge them if equery still sees them
2016-10-17 19:47:57	gentooinstaller	correct n11cky the 2nd part is needed too for convenience (the callback)

2016-10-17 20:01:09	n11cky	gentooinstaller: ZFS evangelists will tell you that fragmentation is actually preferable because the most-common use-case of ZFS is in a server on large pools where fragmentation was going to happen regardless. Ostensibly, having your file spanning across multiple disks means better read speeds because they can be done asynchronously.
2016-10-17 20:01:49	gentooinstaller	n11cky, i never ran fstrim or manually setup trim before. system is <1 year old. ssd was used in a previous computer but is relatively new. is fstrim safe to use on zfs?
2016-10-17 20:02:01	n11cky	not that I'm aware of
2016-10-17 20:02:05	gentooinstaller	ah ok
2016-10-17 20:02:12	gentooinstaller	is there any trim thing i should use on zfs?

2016-10-17 21:03:36	TuxFuk	[05:55:25] DrEeevil: what [05:55:25]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	n11cky	[05:55:42] DrEeevil: it gets more prophetic every year. [05:55:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	r4fkramer	[05:56:43] sorry, what is `idiocracy` mean [05:56:43]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	r4fkramer	[05:56:52] ? [05:56:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	n11cky	[05:56:57] DrEeevil: I'm sorry to ask again, but what is a proper fix? [05:56:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	gentooinstaller	[05:57:23] is there any penalty associated w/ high level of fragmentation on a ssd running zfs? i was using >=50% disk at one point, but fragmentation is still pretty high after removing most of the stuff on it [05:57:23]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	@DrEeevil	[05:57:30] n11cky: rebuilding or removing the package [05:57:30]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	gentooinstaller	[05:57:32] i dont know how to mitigate the fragmentation [05:57:32]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	r4fkramer	[05:58:21] switch to `btrfs`, never has fragmentation issues [05:58:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	n11cky	[05:58:29] DrEeevil: i'll give that a shot; thanks. [05:58:29]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	gentooinstaller	[05:58:47] r4fkramer, care more about date integrity than fragmentation %. just wondering if theres any reason i should be concerned. i use ahci and luks [05:58:47]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	gentooinstaller	[05:59:12] so not sure if its doing trim or cant or w/e [05:59:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	n11cky	[06:01:09] gentooinstaller: ZFS evangelists will tell you that fragmentation is actually preferable because the most-common use-case of ZFS is in a server on large pools where fragmentation was going to happen regardless. Ostensibly, having your file spanning across multiple disks means better read speeds because they can be done asynchronously. [06:01:09]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	gentooinstaller	[06:01:49] n11cky, i never ran fstrim or manually setup trim before. system is <1 year old. ssd was used in a previous computer but is relatively new. is fstrim safe to use on zfs? [06:01:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	n11cky	[06:02:01] not that I'm aware of [06:02:01]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:02:05] ah ok [06:02:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:02:12] is there any trim thing i should use on zfs? [06:02:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:02:33] i used ashift=13 when i made my zpool so its aligned w/ the erase blocks [06:02:33]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:02:51] this is a desktop system [06:02:51]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	n11cky	[06:03:11] AFAIK ZoL does not support TRIM whatsoever. I don't know if that's true with regards to ZFS on the BSD's [06:03:11]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:03:38] n11cky, ah, so basically, if it ever bothers me too much, i am probably best off copying everything off and back on then? [06:03:38]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:03:57] copy, destroy zpool, recreate, copy back [06:03:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	n11cky	[06:04:52] Yeah I'd just rsync it somewhere and back. If you have another zpool you could zfs send and zfs receive the snap [06:04:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	n11cky	[06:05:31] you probably ought to just use another filesystem on your personal computer, tbqh. [06:05:31]

2016-10-17 21:03:37	monk	[06:13:02] morning [06:13:02]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	minimalism	[06:31:22] Does anyone know an alternative startx that doesn't have any systemd contents? [06:31:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@rej	[06:46:41] minimalism: startx has "systemd contents"? Sounds unlikely. [06:46:41]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	minimalism	[06:47:01] rej: It doesn't. But the only startx alternative I know does. [06:47:01]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@rej	[06:47:44] minimalism: You would usually set up some display manager. There is a lot of choice there and most of them don't use systemd (directly) at all. [06:47:44]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:47:50] In order to run Gentoo as a guest system, invoke the following command in the Gentoo guest operating system: [06:47:50]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:47:51] root #emerge --ask app-emulation/virtualbox-guest-additions [06:47:51]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:47:56] what are pro/con of doing this? seems to work for me w/o it [06:47:56]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	minimalism	[06:48:05] rej: Don't display managers all use startx? [06:48:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:48:10] i have a distcc vm running fine w/o it [06:48:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@rej	[06:48:38] minimalism: None of them do. startx is a interactive command line convenience utility. [06:48:38]

2016-10-17 21:03:37	veremit	[06:49:24] eg. sddm, lightdm, slim, xdm..... [06:49:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ilmostro	[06:57:22] anyone seen httpd failure with "sasl_canonuser_add_plugin()" error? It's preceeded by numerous lines in logs about "DIGEST-MD5 common mech free" [06:57:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:58:50] also why is there both virtualbox-guest-additions and virtualbox-additions? i see the -additions one is on 5.0.20, and 5.1.6 is on sabayon overlay (idk if thats safe to use, im on gentoo not funtoo not sabayon) [06:58:50]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:59:18] er, the guest-additions one is 5.0 [06:59:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	novns	[07:03:24] gentooinstaller, virtualbox-additions is an iso image with drivers for windows etc... [07:03:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	***	Playback Complete.
2016-10-17 21:04:36	gentooinstaller	novns, i see. well i have gentoo as a linux guest under virtualbox on windows host and so the guest additions only go up to 5.0.20 in portage... and it says to install it when running as a guest for it to work, but gentoo works fine seemingly w/o it? any reason to install it? headless, not running X or anything. just cli

2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:05:40] People hi again ! I'm having troubles to update my gentoo box. emerge still wants to install qtwayland-5.6.1 whilst the 5.6.2 is available. This triggers many "old" dependencies to 5.6.1 version of qt packages and leads to a slot conflict. How can I get my machine up-to-date, please ? [09:05:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	tdr	[09:07:25] geodb27, 5.6.2 is ~amd64/~x86 [09:07:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:08:21] indeed tdr, and I've made all necessary to have them available (or at least, I guess so) in /etc/portage/package.keyword [09:08:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	tdr	[09:08:47] geodb27, if you emerge -vp dev-qt/qtwayland what version does it show? [09:08:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	tdr	[09:09:14] package.accept_keywords  <--- the correct filename btw [09:09:14]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:09:29] Let me double-check, but I guess it's 5.6.1 [09:09:29]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:09:52] But eix dev-qt/qtwayland shows the 5.6.2 as keyworded [09:09:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:10:30] I know for the folder name, but it's a rather old laptop and I've never had the feeling to change it since it works "as-is" :p [09:10:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:11:27] It indeed wants to install 5.6.1 version and downgrade the packages that are already installed in 5.6.2 version. [09:11:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	tdr	[09:11:54] geodb27, ok try emerge -vpt =dev-qt/qtwayland-5.6.2 [09:11:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	tdr	[09:12:04] it should tell you what dep it needs keyworded [09:12:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:13:41] Just done what you adviced, and Uh ? All ebuilds that could satisfy "=dev-qt/qtwayland-5.6.2" have been masked... I don't understand... In /etc/portage/package.keywords, I have only written down : "dev-qt/qtwayland" so that it should be unmasked... [09:13:41]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:15:09] Oh... Well, found it. Thanks for your kind help tdr. It was a typo in the keyword file... Sorry for the mistake. [09:15:09]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	tdr	[09:15:35] ah good catch, good luck [09:15:35]

2016-10-18 11:19:29	LudaOtaku	Hello, I'd like to use valgrind for debug, and apparently I need to have debug enabled on glibc. If I rebuild glibc with the debug flag, will it also include debug code in all of my other programs ? My guess is no, that it will just install some more files, but I'd like to be sure.

2016-10-19 00:41:26	applejack	[08:38:41] is there a 'gentoo' way of renewing kerberos tickets automatically? [08:38:41]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	applejack	[08:38:51] or just add a cron job [08:38:51]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	Maitreya	[08:39:02] What is a 'Gentoo way'? [08:39:02]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[08:39:40] applejack, you do it the normal way [08:39:40]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	Maitreya	[08:39:44] emerge -e world && krenew ? [08:39:44]

2016-10-19 00:41:26	grawity	[08:40:18] applejack: I dunno if it's packaged [08:40:18]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	grawity	[08:40:23] but krenew from that thing [08:40:23]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[08:40:30] v [08:40:30]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[08:40:32] https://linux.die.net/man/1/krenew [08:40:32]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[08:41:04] it dpeneds whether your krb ticket is renewable or not tho, so you kdc somewhat determines [08:41:04]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	applejack	[08:41:24] windows server kdc [08:41:24]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[08:41:42] urgh, typing to AD? [08:41:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[08:41:46] tying [08:41:46]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	grawity	[08:41:49] nearly all KDCs allow renewable tickets [08:41:49]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	applejack	[08:41:49] yup [08:41:49]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	grawity	[08:41:53] but [08:41:53]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	grawity	[08:42:00] if you use AD, then either sssd or winbindd ought to do the renewing for you [08:42:00]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	applejack	[08:42:16] i don't use either [08:42:16]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	grawity	[08:42:23] maybe you should [08:42:23]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	applejack	[08:42:28] I do use nslcd [08:42:28]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[08:42:33] kerberos policy on the domain controller determines whether they are rewable [08:42:33]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	grawity	[08:42:38] ah, a DIY approach [08:42:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	applejack	[08:42:39] but that doesn't seem to renew [08:42:39]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	blyat	[08:43:58] new to gentoo, so mutch better than debian [08:43:58]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	blyat	[08:44:32] chan /HELP [08:44:32]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	grawity	[08:45:19] because nslcd doesn't do Kerberos [08:45:19]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	mrhanky	[09:04:06] anybody using matlab here? :o [09:04:06]

2016-10-19 00:41:26	Mo	[09:12:25] Hi, I like to use unity-extra/indicator-evolution for Xfce and got a bunch of deps like mono, in sum more than 130MB sources, thinking wether it's worth for a silly indicator. Is Unity in general based on Mono in some parts? https://bpaste.net/show/27d5c9401c0c [09:12:25]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	Laurenzo	[09:13:09] tdr: you have set up Kerberos on DC? [09:13:09]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[09:13:35] Laurenzo, have with extreme protest.  i prefer to use a linux kdc .. and use heimdal not mit kerberos [09:13:35]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	Laurenzo	[09:14:10] tdr, right :) sometimes there isn't much choice though... [09:14:10]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[09:14:25] AD is mit based and lacks some features of heimdal [09:14:25]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	srlegend	[09:14:40] Montana Rant: funneling the dissent right back to the beginning, while keeping everyone w-i-t-h-i-n the system they control. This one's called "Recycling the Dissent" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dDQt5bR7zo [09:14:40]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	Laurenzo	[09:14:48] tdr: what sort of setup does it require to have DC as the KDC in windows server for example? [09:14:48]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[09:15:29] Laurenzo, there's kerberos policies you need to set.  its off topic here tho, it's windows support, not gentoo [09:15:29]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[09:16:32] MO dev-dotnet/gtk-sharp is getting pulled, that uses mono (basically .net) [09:16:32]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[09:23:31] Laurenzo, gentoo has a basic kerberos guide for the linux part: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Kerberos_Windows_Interoperability [09:23:31]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	Laurenzo	[09:26:13] quality guide, as always! thanks tdr [09:26:13]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	generic	[09:27:27] building recode died with segfault http://dpaste.com/2077GWP [09:27:27]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[09:30:04] Laurenzo, for the windows side, this goes over some stuff if you have admin there (covers through server 2008) https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj852258(v=ws.11).aspx [09:30:04]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	generic	[09:41:06] how can I get rid of a segfault ? [09:41:06]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	DeviantPeer	[09:48:39] generic: kill -9 <pid> before it segfaults :) [09:48:39]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	generic	[09:51:47] DeviantPeer: actually i found another way I enabled nls on recode and the segfault was fleeing in terror [09:51:47]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	generic	[09:52:28] I *might* delete recode first thing after I built my updates [09:52:28]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	generic	[09:53:19] just to make sure it's not coming back [09:53:19]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	generic	[09:54:30] what's the use of recode if I don't use nls ? [09:54:30]

2016-10-19 02:37:16	mar77i	you can recollect it from the backlog pretty well, I guess. first I rebooted into the old kernel. then I updated /etc/lilo.conf and removed the old kernel from boot. and then I didn't run lilo and rebooted.
2016-10-19 02:37:32	mar77i	plausible?

I've had another thought though, I'm guessing that one package in that big list of perl packages is one that hasn't been updated for the new perl (whereas the others have), and is also probably one that I don't want any more. So I might go through to find the one that doesn't have updates, and get rid of it...

2016-10-19 13:08:22	dank101	So I was compiling systemd to use udev in a bootloader thing
2016-10-19 13:08:27	dank101	It failed
2016-10-19 13:08:31	dank101	So I use eudev
2016-10-19 13:08:37	dank101	Took not even a 10th of the time
2016-10-19 13:08:40	dank101	And worked
2016-10-19 13:09:13	nabblet	Kelsar: ok, but the basic idea/problem is to get all relevant qt-dev packages to 5.6.2 (by accepting ~amd for them). Correct?
2016-10-19 13:09:21	Kelsar	surely whole systemd needs longer then only eudev
2016-10-19 13:09:42	Kelsar	nabblet: yes, upstream does not support the gentoo way of splitting things
2016-10-19 13:10:02	dank101	Kelsar, it took less than the time to compile eudev then it did to git clone systemd
2016-10-19 13:10:04	Kelsar	nabblet: they need to be the exact same verison
2016-10-19 13:10:19	Kelsar	dank101: sure, systemd repo contains much more then only udev
2016-10-19 13:10:44	Kelsar	dank101: it is like saying cloning nano repo is much fastern then cloning libreoffice
2016-10-19 13:10:57	maolang	nabblet: else you will have apps that fails to launch or work because of inconsistent versions between qt parts
2016-10-19 13:11:06	nabblet	Kelsar: yes. I just wanted to ensure I understood correctly. I accepted some qt-dev/*5.6.2 packages... but not all of them, which caused this isse.

2016-10-19 13:11:39	nabblet	maolang: thanks for the info. Now that I know what the issue is I'm fixing it

2016-10-19 13:24:30	r3g3x	maolang:  i'm using hardened-sources.  i've been doing that for along time and haven't had problems.  the only reason i have my own ebuild is i pull the latest patch from the grsecurity site.  i haven't had an issue until today.  i've used this ebuild before, but i was getting this with the previous kernel things worked with.

2016-10-19 17:31:03	tdr	CinderellaMan, use a build server and emerge -K to fetch bins from it

2016-10-19 17:31:56	tdr	CinderellaMan, apt under gentoo isn't really ever going to happen sanely.  gentoo can use bins from other distros but they are more prone to breaking or preventing other updates
2016-10-19 17:32:30	maolang	but why would you use such anyway.... the only thing it might really do is break stuff...
2016-10-19 17:32:30	tdr	CinderellaMan, use the dpkg commands to do you install, thats all apt is doing anyway
2016-10-19 17:32:52	CinderellaMan	tdr, sounds cool
2016-10-19 17:33:25	tdr	CinderellaMan, be aware that if you change your system (update) those bins may break
2016-10-19 17:34:05	tdr	CinderellaMan, writing an ebuild for using non-native bins isn't super hard usually, and it would allow you to lock down any deps that really shouldnt change.  portage has eclasses for dealing with rpms and debs etc

2016-10-19 19:07:56	garth	on a side idea, if you don't need the performance. Maybe you can remove all the nvidia support & run only off the intel gpu
2016-10-19 19:08:04	mark4	i dont think this is a mesa issue but its emerging now

2016-10-19 19:09:20	mark4	something is wrong at console level
2016-10-19 19:09:38	mark4	well. maybe its not the console. maybe its the cards themselves screwing up
2016-10-19 19:09:57	mark4	i have no idea even how to tell whats causing the flashing on and off. is it the display going off and on again?
2016-10-19 19:10:05	garth	at console level, usually is a graphic driver (in or out of kernel), or framebuffer

2016-10-19 20:40:05	maolang	[06:31:03] this messages does kinda say that somehow the problem is driver / probably gl related [06:31:03]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	maolang	[06:31:18] lol, send it to me, ill fix it :) [06:31:18]

2016-10-19 20:40:05	garth	[06:32:26] Captain_Beezay: but if you don't have a line for it in your fstab, it should be taken care of automatically [06:32:26]

2016-10-19 20:40:05	maolang	[06:33:39] np man, if you were in paris i would try booting my usb hd on your laptop, it probably would be fine, so far its booted around 50 different systems, desktop / laptops all the way to x, sound net etc all working [06:33:39]

2016-10-20 00:25:35	throwaway	[09:18:27] Does catalyst need to rebuild all 3 stages in order to update its chroot? [09:18:27]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	retarded-cheez	[09:22:04] i like cheeeeeeeeeeese [09:22:04]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	throwaway	[09:22:36] I have a customized stage3 chroot and want to build a minimal system from it, without portage, gcc, /usr/include, ... [09:22:36]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	throwaway	[09:23:08] I see i could do `emerge -ek some packages --root=/my/root/dir`, but it probably has caveats. [09:23:08]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	cheeeeeeeeeeese	[09:23:27] throwaway: is it cheeeeeeeeeeesy? [09:23:27]

2016-10-20 00:25:35	cheeeeeeeeeeese	[09:24:35] shit [09:24:35]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	garth	[09:26:09] throwaway: I don't have the answers you need, but I'm curious. Why would you want to make a system you couldn't update? [09:26:09]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	throwaway	[09:27:34] garth: i can update the chroot and then regenerate my minimal env. I want to use portage to build a minimal toy system. [09:27:34]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	throwaway	[09:28:30] the toy system itself doesn't need to be able to update itself. [09:28:30]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	garth	[09:28:44] oh, that makes more sense [09:28:44]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	+Poly-C_atwork	[09:30:50] throwaway: I doubt many people have tried that yet. So if you don't get any replies here and you happen to successfully play around with it by yourself it would be awesome if you could contribute your experience to the Gentoo Wiki. [09:30:50]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	throwaway	[09:31:21] catalyst seems to be able to do exactly that. But its documentation is rather frugal. [09:31:21]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	tdr	[09:32:15] catalys best makes livecd's or stage3 tarballs [09:32:15]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	throwaway	[09:32:38] i feel like configuring catalyst is way more complex than just "extracting" a minimal system from a stage3 chroot. [09:32:38]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	tdr	[09:33:33] just make a chroot and then a script to remove whatver you want rid of, rsync your chroot to your toy location every time you want an update, then "clean" it with your script [09:33:33]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	tdr	[09:34:12] a bit beyond the scope of #gentoo tho [09:34:12]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	throwaway	[09:36:29] tdr: that "clean" step is the hard part i care about. Manually resolving binaries, dependencies, ... is impossible. [09:36:29]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	tdr	[09:37:27] throwaway, its easy enough to toss gcc bins etc, you just need to make a list [09:37:27]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	tdr	[09:39:13] or headers etc, just poke through your systems and sort out what would be "fluff" .. things like qlist can list what files packages need (in case you need to rip out binary directories without nuking libs of a package) etc [09:39:13]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	sag3	[09:44:37] hi, anyone else had their gtk apps (pavucontrol, for example) broken after an update recently? [09:44:37]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	sag3	[09:44:55] pavucontrol opens, but the theme is screwed [09:44:55]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	grawity	[09:47:21] that tends to happen with gtk 3.x [09:47:21]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	grawity	[09:47:28] since they change theme internals every now and then [09:47:28]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	grawity	[09:47:32] test if it happens with stock Adwaita [09:47:32]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	sag3	[09:49:52] grawity: bingo, with Adwaita is fine. thanks! [09:49:52]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	muffindrake	[09:51:12] Is using rustup possible on gentoo, or would that conflict with portage (for cross-compiling binaries for other architectures) [09:51:12]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	muffindrake	[09:51:18] ? [09:51:18]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	SkunkyFone	[09:54:03] muffindrake: what's rustup? [09:54:03]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	muffindrake	[09:54:38] That's a tool to install the rust compiler (as well as cross-compiler) [09:54:38]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	tommaso	[09:54:58] quit [09:54:58]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	tdr	[09:57:00] muffindrake, cant just use crossdev? [09:57:00]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	tdr	[09:57:36] muffindrake, by rust do you mean dev-lang/rust ? [09:57:36]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	muffindrake	[09:57:41] Yes. [09:57:41]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	tdr	[09:57:55] emerge -va rust [09:57:55]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	muffindrake	[09:58:20] Yes, for installing the rust compiler for your current system, that's fine [09:58:20]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	muffindrake	[09:58:31] But I'd like to cross-compile for another architecture [09:58:31]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	Kelsar	[10:10:28] muffindrake: can you not install that just to your home dir? [10:10:28]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	minimalism	[10:11:22] Is it possible to disable .keep file generation? [10:11:22]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	LupusOnFire	[10:12:32] Hello, this is my first time installing Gentoo. I have just done 'grub-install /dev/sda' and it echoed 'Installing for 1386-pc' but i'm using amd64 on this system. Should i be worried? [10:12:32]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	minimalism	[10:12:49] yes, the world is about to end [10:12:49]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	Kelsar	[10:13:35] LupusOnFire: no, everything is fine. x86 bios is still i386 [10:13:35]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	LupusOnFire	[10:13:55] Kelsar: ty :) [10:13:55]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	garth	[10:14:17] LupusOnFire: just be aware that it won't work with efi-only bios [10:14:17]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	muffindrake	[10:15:47] Ah, rustup only installs to home directory and doesn't mess with path on request [10:15:47]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	muffindrake	[10:15:51] All is solved, I suppose [10:15:51]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	muffindrake	[10:16:39] Except for my attempt at installing gcc for armv6j-hardfloat-linux-gnueabi [10:16:39]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	muffindrake	[10:16:49] Since I require a C compiler for that architecture [10:16:49]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	muffindrake	[10:17:39] compilation of glibc (using crossdev) seems to fail [10:17:39]

I use nfs root, and on some computer the nic is [not supported|none present|no standard connector|defective]... What I see is that it actually try to initialise the main card, then dhcp it (and fail) then wait 120 seconds, then initialise the usb one, then dhcp again the main one,...

2016-10-21 06:53:39	wuseman	When i do locale -a i do now see my languages from /etc/profile and not 02locale anymore. Locales is really wierd, yesterday i had like 700 locales to choose. So etc/profile must override 02locales. Well thats better since i doubt there is more then 2 language mostly used on a system

In any case, it seems to make sens to have jackd running as service (as root). However, there is no init.d file coming with it and neither do I find any prominent thing about running jackd as root on the forums. Is this running jackd as root on gentoo unusual for some reason?

2016-10-21 23:39:29	tdr	zuluzim, stage3 is the start of the normal install, it needs kernel and a couple services to get a running system
2016-10-21 23:40:18	tdr	zuluzim, stage1 and stage2 are primitive stages and needed a lot more work to get them to a running state

2016-10-22 00:53:52	garth	let me put it this way. Gentoo is source based, everything you install that's in C or C++ gets compiled by gcc. Between ABI changes & undocumentd bugs, there's a lot of potential here
2016-10-22 00:54:07	zyliwax	apus: than 4.9.4? or 5.4.0?

2016-10-22 00:54:57	tdr	zyliwax, just rebuild if you use 5.x or 6.x
2016-10-22 00:55:09	zyliwax	i think i will use 5.4.0 for this new setup
2016-10-22 00:55:16	tdr	its easier than tracking down stupid issues.  emerge -e world will do it
2016-10-22 00:55:59	apus	keep in mind, that you can introduce unknown issues to your system, so it is safer to stay with the version that gets fixes backported and has feature freeze

2016-10-22 04:52:57	ratcheer	I am trying to genkernel and load the Radeon driver in the kernel. But genkernel says something else is requiring it to be loaded as a module, but it won't tell me what that is. How can I find out?
2016-10-22 04:53:22	Captain_Beezay	Does anyone know why this would happen after a fresh install http://bpaste.net/show/a7d2296c38ac

2016-10-22 04:53:37	Captain_Beezay	kernel panics due to a faulty init
2016-10-22 04:53:56	Captain_Beezay	or rather a faulty instruction in libc
2016-10-22 04:54:04	ratcheer	deathlire: Was that to me? I have loaded linux-firmware
2016-10-22 04:54:17	ratcheer	Or, firmware-linux
2016-10-22 04:54:23	+xiaomiao	Captain_Beezay: usually due to overly optimistic CFLAGS

2016-10-22 10:07:49	BtbN	enso, I don't care about it. But they use the same assembler that collides with musl. And the chance for it to get fixed there is even smaller.

2016-10-22 10:10:37	BtbN	enso, the background to this is that musl uses floating point calculations in its memory allocation code. And the ffmpeg assembly does not expect this and doesn't reset the x87 state in between.

2016-10-22 10:12:28	BtbN	It's way more apparent on x86. As on amd64 stuff mostly uses sse instructions for floating point math
2016-10-22 10:12:36	BtbN	but even on amd64 it can randomly crash
2016-10-22 10:12:43	BtbN	on x86 it crashes pretty much instantly

2016-10-22 10:17:10	BtbN	I'm more baffled about it using floats in malloc
2016-10-22 10:17:13	BtbN	why?!
2016-10-22 10:17:52	BtbN	they are technically correct, the C standard does not guarantee anything in that regard

2016-10-22 10:35:31	Thymo	iqubic: If you really have to use SystemD (please consider using OpenRC though) then make sure you set it from OpenRC to SystemD in the kernel config, yes.

2016-10-22 10:37:21	zyliwax	well, that's all you need to do just to remove systemd
2016-10-22 10:37:25	iqubic	I'd like to use the simpler option, which in this case is OpenRC
2016-10-22 10:37:56	iqubic	So, what's the best way to configure the kernel? Should I just use genkernel for my first installation?
2016-10-22 10:38:02	zyliwax	ideally you will also update the USE flags in /etc/portage/make.conf with USE=" ... -systemd ... " and run emerge --ask --deep --newuse @world
2016-10-22 10:38:09	Thymo	iqubic: Don't forget to switch your profile to a non systemd one.
2016-10-22 10:38:28	zyliwax	Thymo: you made an initramfs from scratch?! do tell?
2016-10-22 10:39:19	iqubic	Done.
2016-10-22 10:39:35	Thymo	zyliwax: I used this: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Custom_Initramfs. Then I put static lvm and cryptsetup in it.
2016-10-22 10:39:41	iqubic	Now, how should I go about configuring my kernel? Should I just do what the wiki says?
2016-10-22 10:39:52	Thymo	Yep.
2016-10-22 10:39:55	zyliwax	iqubic: that last set of instructions will compile systemd support of any programs which contain it
2016-10-22 10:40:06	zyliwax	which is great for purists like me :>

2016-10-22 10:58:20	Thymo	iqubic: After installing the sources. cd /usr/src/linux. Then make menuconfig.
2016-10-22 10:58:21	zyliwax	you'll have to run that command from where your linux kernel lives (most likely /usr/src/linux)

2016-10-22 10:59:09	DeviantPeer	iqubic: the non believers (me) usually just use a config from a distro kernel as a working start
2016-10-22 10:59:36	DeviantPeer	iqubic: just go through the menus, read the help in each entries. Prepare around 2 hours for that.
2016-10-22 10:59:38	Thymo	I usually skip some parts I know I don't need. For a new system generally every option top to bottom.
2016-10-22 10:59:52	iqubic	I've got about two hours

2016-10-22 11:00:44	iqubic	What steps, the ones in the wiki?
2016-10-22 11:00:46	Thymo	Yes. Pay special attention to "Kernel driver in use:".
2016-10-22 11:00:57	DeviantPeer	iqubic: there was a project to help with that... me needs to search memory banks...

2016-10-22 11:01:32	zyliwax	iqubic: scroll back your irc client to when i first mentioned lspci -v and wrote out a bunch of long lines
2016-10-22 11:01:50	Thymo	Last line for every entry.
2016-10-22 11:02:02	zyliwax	to summarize: use the menuconfig's search feature and look up the kernel drivers for each entry in lspci -v
2016-10-22 11:02:12	DeviantPeer	found it: https://github.com/nichoski/kergen/
2016-10-22 11:02:41	zyliwax	make sure they are activated [=y], and if not, hit the number in the margin of the result to go to that entry and activate it

2016-10-22 11:04:36	iqubic	So the kernel driver my host bridge is using is bdw_uncore? How is that helpful?
2016-10-22 11:05:28	zyliwax	iqubic: now what you can do from menuconfig is search (hit the / key) and look up that driver in the long list of options

2016-10-22 11:35:11	Kelsar	Captain_Beezay: you don't understand, removing the dep is one line, like in the link above, but it still won't work, since the interface is not up

2016-10-22 11:38:18	Captain_Beezay	Kelsar: yeah, I still don't get it, if the depend() section of the script remove why is it still saying it depends on 'net'

2016-10-22 11:38:26	BtbN	eblip, that's simply a broken ebuild.

2016-10-22 12:06:49	eblip	hey iqubic ...when i built my first kernel i tended to use a lot of defaults or only deselected things that were obvious that i didnt need...if unsure use the default
2016-10-22 12:07:20	iqubic	I will do that. If the recommendation differs from the default, then I'll switch to the recommended.

2016-10-22 16:05:48	eb0t	personally i think its nice to have a certain size home drive ..so you dont keep loads of junk
2016-10-22 16:06:02	eb0t	then you deffo need a /booty
2016-10-22 16:06:18	iqubic	and an efi boot partition?
2016-10-22 16:06:42	iqubic	Can the uefi boot partition be the same as the grub boot partition?

2016-10-22 17:29:10	username234	iqubic: well running dd isn't going to tell the kernel / udev you erased everything.
2016-10-22 17:29:25	iqubic	Fdisk is working
2016-10-22 17:30:32	iqubic	How do I use fdisk to recreate the partition table?
2016-10-22 17:30:56	iqubic	I don't know how to use fdisk, just parted.
2016-10-22 17:31:19	ephemer0l	can you just restart udev in / not chroot to get the new partition layout, or lack their of?
2016-10-22 17:31:29	iqubic	I could try
2016-10-22 17:31:33	username234	you could try partprobe
2016-10-22 17:31:42	username234	although I wouldn't worry about it
2016-10-22 17:31:56	username234	parted/fdisk/gdisk will all inform the kernel of the partition change when they exit
2016-10-22 17:32:08	username234	(or tell you to run partprobe if they can't for some reason)
2016-10-22 17:32:11	iqubic	partprobe is asking me to reboot.
2016-10-22 17:32:52	username234	that's odd...
2016-10-22 17:33:11	iqubic	Since apparently my partitions have been written to, but partprobe can't inform the kernel of the changes for some reason
2016-10-22 17:33:32	ephemer0l	and you still have no parted?
2016-10-22 17:33:40	username234	iqubic: were any of the partitions mounted when you ran dd?
2016-10-22 17:33:46	iqubic	All of them
2016-10-22 17:33:52	username234	ah..
2016-10-22 17:34:15	username234	when you zero a disk like that you should have unmounted the partitions first.
2016-10-22 17:34:37	iqubic	and I can't unmount my partitions because their busy. What should I do?
2016-10-22 17:34:42	username234	reboot
2016-10-22 17:35:18	iqubic	And that will fix my issues?
2016-10-22 17:35:36	ephemer0l	'umount -f' wouldnt work?
2016-10-22 17:35:40	eb0t	  i thought you could umount -f to force it
2016-10-22 17:35:56	iqubic	umount -f fails
2016-10-22 17:36:28	iqubic	no, wait I use umount -rf to recursively force things to unmount. I got that to work
2016-10-22 17:36:41	ephemer0l	are you trying to unmount /mnt/gentoo while there is still /mnt/gentoo/dev and such still mounted?
2016-10-22 17:36:49	iqubic	Yeah.
2016-10-22 17:37:25	iqubic	But apparently /mnt/gentoo/dev is busy as well.

2016-10-23 00:46:40	ManDay	ok, perhaps not as root but with dropped privs, but as a service. Since I use jack as my primary audio server (I guess most people who use jack do) I'd have it run from the start

2016-10-23 02:38:35	Thymo	Then you can just create new partitions in that unused space for gentoo. As long as you don't touch the windoze partition you'll be fine.
2016-10-23 02:39:12	fdz	so the command "parted -a optimal /dev/sda" shouldnt do anything
2016-10-23 02:39:15	fdz	bad

2016-10-23 04:56:27	kerframil	fdz: so what? you don't need SSD speeds just to load a kernel image
2016-10-23 04:57:10	fdz	i want the os to load as fast as possible, even if its supidly fast
2016-10-23 04:57:11	maolang	a kernel will be like 10MB and grub like 1mb even if you booted that from a slow device... the impact in overall speed for the rest of the system like 0.01%

2016-10-23 11:36:30	iqubic	Wait, I don't need efibootmgr to get a UEFI boot inastall of gentoo done?
2016-10-23 11:36:43	fearedbliss	username234: https://blogs.oracle.com/bonwick/en/entry/rampant_layering_violation
2016-10-23 11:36:48	username234	iqubic: you don't need a prebuilt one.
2016-10-23 11:37:10	username234	iqubic: when you emerge your bootloader of choice, it will (likely) pull in efibootmgr as a dependency
2016-10-23 11:37:19	username234	I know GRUB does that
2016-10-23 11:37:26	iqubic	That means my old gentoo liveusb would have worked just fine. GOD I'm Stupid
2016-10-23 11:37:38	username234	iqubic: if it UEFI booted, yes.
2016-10-23 11:37:42	gotwf	iqubic: avoid UEFI is possible
2016-10-23 11:37:46	username234	if not, well... things get complicated then
2016-10-23 11:37:53	username234	gotwf: there's no reason to avoid it
2016-10-23 11:37:57	dman777	I need to load up gentoo live and chroot to my root fs to recompile the kernel. Do I have to go through the pain of mount -t proc and mount --rbind dev and sys?
2016-10-23 11:37:59	fearedbliss	there's no real benefit to uefi in my opinion
2016-10-23 11:38:09	iqubic	I want to create a UEFI boot system with grub as the boot loader

2016-10-23 11:38:17	gotwf	username234: yeah, there is.  merely enabling uefi bricked my xeon box
2016-10-23 11:38:28	seckford	dman: basically, yes
2016-10-23 11:38:38	username234	gotwf: hardware defects don't count.
2016-10-23 11:38:49	fearedbliss	iqubic: you dont need uefi to install gentoo
2016-10-23 11:38:54	gotwf	username234: UEFI IS a hardware defect
2016-10-23 11:39:11	fearedbliss	iqubic: if you are just learning, try to go with the simplest solution possible. mbr/legacy boot
2016-10-23 11:39:13	iqubic	But I need UEFI to install a UEFI boot version of gentoo
2016-10-23 11:39:24	fearedbliss	before I use to advocate for BIOS-GPT
2016-10-23 11:39:25	gotwf	+1 on fearedbliss comment
2016-10-23 11:39:31	iqubic	fearedbliss: I want gpt/UEFI
2016-10-23 11:39:35	BtbN	you don't. Just copy the bootloader to the default location.
2016-10-23 11:39:46	iqubic	What do I want?
2016-10-23 11:39:47	fearedbliss	but apprently some new machines actually assume that if you have a GPT partition and are booting legacy, then you simply because you are legacy you have MBR
2016-10-23 11:39:48	seckford	fearedbliss: will grub legacy handle UEFI?
2016-10-23 11:39:50	fearedbliss	it's stupid
2016-10-23 11:40:05	username234	seckford: no
2016-10-23 11:40:06	fearedbliss	seckford: I dont think so. I use grub2
2016-10-23 11:40:06	 *	gotwf does use bios/gpt, but not uefi
2016-10-23 11:40:10	username234	seckford: grub-2 only
2016-10-23 11:40:25	iqubic	What partitioning scheme should I give my usb?
2016-10-23 11:40:34	fearedbliss	i also dont use uefi even on my uefi capable machines. There's no real perceived benefit for the user.
2016-10-23 11:40:43	username234	iqubic: MBR
2016-10-23 11:40:48	fearedbliss	maybe it fixes some broken ahci tables or w/e it is, but I dont even care
2016-10-23 11:40:55	fearedbliss	my system powers on, suspends, sleeps fine
2016-10-23 11:41:00	BtbN	you can turn off CSM and massively speed up the boot
2016-10-23 11:41:21	fearedbliss	gotwf: I use to use bios/gpt, but like I said, some machines will fail to boot if you do that
2016-10-23 11:41:21		[11:41]
2016-10-23 11:41:26	Kelsar	and better boot control from the running os
2016-10-23 11:41:40	fearedbliss	like my thinkpad x260.
2016-10-23 11:41:50	fearedbliss	if I use legacy boot, it enforces/assumes MBR
2016-10-23 11:41:50	username234	fearedbliss: well that's Lenovo for you
2016-10-23 11:41:56	gotwf	fearedbliss: yep.  fortunately, mine don't ;D
2016-10-23 11:42:01	fearedbliss	my thinkpad t430 worked fine though
2016-10-23 11:42:01	Kelsar	fearedbliss: just mark the protective mbr partition bootable and it boots
2016-10-23 11:42:06	fearedbliss	Kelsar: nope
2016-10-23 11:42:08	BtbN	how would the device enforce MBR?
2016-10-23 11:42:10	username234	Kelsar: not always
2016-10-23 11:42:11	fearedbliss	Kelsar: this is different.
2016-10-23 11:42:18	fearedbliss	Kelsar: lenovo didnt implement those code paths
2016-10-23 11:42:19	BtbN	In legacy mode, it just executes whatever is in the first X bytes of the disk.
2016-10-23 11:42:31	username234	BtbN: it stupidly checks the disk and imposes restrictions it shouldn't.
2016-10-23 11:42:33	BtbN	It doesn't care about the partitions on there at all
2016-10-23 11:42:37	Kelsar	BtbN: no, lenovo tries to be clever...
2016-10-23 11:42:44	Kelsar	and pareses the mbr
2016-10-23 11:42:51	fearedbliss	BtbN: for the lenovo thinkpad x260, if you are booting in legacy mode, it will assume MBR. If you are using GPT, it will fail
2016-10-23 11:42:53	BtbN	And it's not happy with the protective MBR?
2016-10-23 11:43:03	Kelsar	my e550 did that too
2016-10-23 11:43:06	username234	BtbN: probably barfs on the partition type

2016-10-23 11:43:18	BtbN	But why does it care? What does it do with the partitions?
2016-10-23 11:43:20	Kelsar	BtbN: the boot "hack" makes it boot
2016-10-23 11:43:26	fearedbliss	Kelsar: making it bootable didnt fix it for me, I had to use gdisk and "transform" my layout to MBR
2016-10-23 11:43:37	fearedbliss	luckily everything worked and no data was loss due to the conversion
2016-10-23 11:43:51	fearedbliss	it wouldnt matter anyways, I didnt have anything in that fresh install, but I did install gentoo, so I would have just lost my installation
2016-10-23 11:43:56	Kelsar	fearedbliss: well, atleast my W530 has no such problem instead refind does not work without a great delay
2016-10-23 11:44:16	fearedbliss	Kelsar: yea my T430 was fine, that's why I got caught off guard.

2016-10-23 11:44:50	seckford	BtbN: Long ago I fought with a T23 to stop a Linux install messing up IBM's 'special' boot menu.  Now I just boot through a Windows menu to grub.  Takes five seconds and saves a lot of heartache.
2016-10-23 11:44:51	username234	and even then only the first 6 bytes or so.

2016-10-23 11:46:18	benfitzpatrick	and yes i have tried plasma5 i HATE it

2016-10-23 20:29:23	tdr	deviljinkazama, generally speaking, USE flags tell packages to build with or without features that the flags enable/disable, its a way of controlling what backend pieces your software depends on
2016-10-23 20:29:45	deviljinkazama	Example?
2016-10-23 20:29:49	benfitzpatrick	hi all i got gnome2 available as a package and i try to install it but i get conflicts with Gnome3 and i masked gnome3 in package.use but it still tries to install gnome3 idk why here's a paste of my errors http://pastebin.com/eFykcHk6
2016-10-23 20:30:10	benfitzpatrick	i tried for hours to fix this so i have 0 clue whats up with this
2016-10-23 20:30:24	benfitzpatrick	and i for one MUCH prefer stock gnome2 and mate just..doesnt do it fr me
2016-10-23 20:30:30	tdr	deviljinkazama, easy example, the ffmpeg USE flag for vlc lets it be able to use ffmpeg features
2016-10-23 20:30:42	benfitzpatrick	and gnome3 is just..awful
2016-10-23 20:30:55	benfitzpatrick	i like XFCE but..im bored of it and just want gnome
2016-10-23 20:31:00	ephemer0l	benfitzpatrick: those are 'slot conflicts' and you have to figure out what depends on what and play a masking game
2016-10-23 20:31:25	benfitzpatrick	ephemr01: i have never figured this out before which is why i came here for help
2016-10-23 20:31:28	tdr	deviljinkazama, there are preset flags that come with specific profiles that attempt to set most common USE flags for folks
2016-10-23 20:31:29	deviljinkazama	So when I'll be fetching source code and then building vlc, if I use "ffmpeg" flag, then it shall be compiled with the "ffmpeg" features?
2016-10-23 20:31:42	benfitzpatrick	i have no clue in the world how to fix that
2016-10-23 20:31:43	tdr	deviljinkazama, correct
2016-10-23 20:31:47	ephemer0l	deviljinkazama: or use external ffmpeg, maybe
2016-10-23 20:32:16	deviljinkazama	What should I infer with "external" ?
2016-10-23 20:32:31	benfitzpatrick	i wouldnt even know where to begin to fix slot conflicts
2016-10-23 20:32:34	tdr	deviljinkazama, it also means vlc would pull ffmpeg in and build it along the way of getting your vlc

2016-10-23 21:45:55	jaymar88	Oh. Okay. Should I install it from cpan then?
2016-10-23 21:46:33	+kent\n	Not as root, no.
2016-10-23 21:47:00	+kent\n	Its advisable if you want to install stuff from CPAN, do it as ~/  using either local::lib or perlbrew
2016-10-23 21:47:36	+kent\n	You *can* do it as root, but you risk breaking things if you do because the CPAN tooling and Portage are somewhat ignorant of each other.
2016-10-23 21:48:04	+kent\n	its a "Technically, it works, but you shouldn't unless you're really sure there's no better alternative" thing.

2016-10-23 21:50:22	+kent\n	dev-perl/App-cpanminus, dev-perl/App-perlbrew, dev-perl/local-lib # ofc
2016-10-23 21:51:36	+kent\n	and depending on the nature of *why* you need Regexp::Grammars ( ie: developing a project for a company ), it may be worth using Carton/Carmel or something to manage dependencies, but thats not in portage.

2016-10-24 01:32:21	tdr	Kelsar, yeah, i didnt read his emerge line at the top, just the blocks
2016-10-24 01:32:28	Kelsar	tdr: it has no URI inside the ebuild ;)

2016-10-24 01:32:42		[01:32]
2016-10-24 01:32:54	tdr	the eclass has a section that says it sets the URI for the modules (that was about the xorg2 eclass)
2016-10-24 01:33:05	stobix	Heh. So binfmt.sh is supposed to take in files as arguments, run through all the files and add the correct lines to the register file. /etc/init/binfmt calls my (empty) binfmt.sh file with no arguments, so even if it had something in it, it would do nothing. I wonder who messed this up so badly.

2016-10-24 01:35:34	tdr	Hellfire, no, the VIDEO_CARDS=  line pulls in the correct driver if you have that set when your xorg is pulled in by your kde

2016-10-24 02:07:48	Kelsar	m00tykins: would have two columns, x86 and amd64
2016-10-24 02:07:51	tdr	m00tykins, ok then get the amd64 stage3 multilib ... even though its intel.  the amd64 just means 64 bit

2016-10-24 02:26:10	Hellfire	im now in KDE
2016-10-24 02:26:23	tdr	Hellfire, if so, open systemsettings and turn off most the desktop effects, limit your desktops to only 1 or 2 (vs the million it defaults too) and then check your display settings
2016-10-24 02:26:28	m00tykins	whats the difference between stage 3 and stage 4?

2016-10-24 02:26:59	tdr	m00tykins, you cannot download a stage 4.  you get a stage 3 and then add things.  a full system backed up into a tarball would be a stage4
2016-10-24 02:26:59	m00tykins	and how is admincd different from minimal cd?
2016-10-24 02:27:11	m00tykins	ok
2016-10-24 02:27:20	tdr	m00tykins, the minimal cd is actually supported by gentoo.  that other i've never heard of

2016-10-24 04:34:04	mlyszczek	Hi, I have problem with 'agetty'. It spawns correctly, it displays welcome message, and shows login prompt. But I cannot login. When entering username it thinks for about 10 seconds and restarts showing login prompt again, never showing password prompt. I can enter invalid username and it acts the same. Any ideas what might cause this?

In comparison to Win7 my gentoo system does not compete a 720p Video on youtube is not played fluently. I messed up configuring and have been looking for a solution but couldnt find any, and the gentoowiki speaks of a gstreamer use flag but that is not displayed when I "emerge -av firefox". Both Video and Audio work but with poor performance.

2016-10-24 10:04:10	myarta_	fdz yeah that's all those automatic use flag updates. it should ask you 13 times and each time entering 'u' should take you to the next one. if not snap me a pic so i can see what it's stuck on

2016-10-24 14:50:16	sheep	so you'll either have to switch profiles or enable a bunch of use flags. in the case you said, it's saying "if udev is enabled, then alsa needs to be enabled too", and I think systemd profiles enable the udev use flag by default
2016-10-24 14:50:44	wokko	fdz: I would pick desktop profile and add systemd -consolekit to USE= in make.conf

2016-10-24 14:54:52	stqn	section1: ok the problem is there is no "stable" version of google-chrome, so when you update emerge doesn’t find any stable version to install, and does nothing (keeps the installed version).

2016-10-24 18:15:17	iqubic	Do I install the stage tarball before chrooting?
2016-10-24 18:15:34	iqubic	And I mount proc and sys and dev before chrooting.
2016-10-24 18:16:00	wokko	iqubic: yes, mount your partiton and then extract stage3 then mount proc sys dev then chroot
2016-10-24 18:16:09	iqubic	Cool, thanks
2016-10-24 18:16:16	maolang	wokko: well so far managed to get one magic line, that does it pretty much how i want it roughly 90% except there are places where 2.7 single targets stuff need to be edited per case base

2016-10-24 18:18:32	iqubic	Time to install the stage tarball. How do I verify that it went to the hard drive and not the live usb?
2016-10-24 18:19:06	iqubic	I want to make sure that it's working for me.
2016-10-24 18:19:18	iqubic	ANd that I did not place this in the wrong spot.
2016-10-24 18:19:24	tirkaz	iqubic: cd to the mounted directory, wget it, and run the command from the handbook
2016-10-24 18:19:43	iqubic	And that will work, what if it goes to the wrong place?
2016-10-24 18:19:59	tirkaz	iqubic: if you are following the handbook it won't go to the wrong place

2016-10-24 18:25:17	iqubic	I know that the gentoo fs is on my hard drive, not the live usb

2016-10-24 18:26:32	maolang	similar to sed command
