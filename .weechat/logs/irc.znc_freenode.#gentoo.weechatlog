2016-10-17 19:45:43	gentooinstaller	n11cky, for genkernel set yes for the zfs line in genkernel.conf and for the callback line put "FEATURES=-ccache emerge spl zfs-kmod zfs" and its all good, for modular zfs that works properly anyhow, and if you use a video driver or any other kind of module addon put that in the callback i gave you
2016-10-17 19:46:15	gentooinstaller	like, if you need to compile one from portage i mean, not in-kernel modules that dont depend on external software
2016-10-17 19:46:46	n11cky	gentooinstaller: right on. I already have had the system booting for a while and setup for use with genkernel. I was just asking about getting them out of the @module-rebuild set, now that I don't need the .ko's lying around
2016-10-17 19:47:32	n11cky	I think the real important line for genkernel.conf is ZFS="yes"
2016-10-17 19:47:32		[19:47]
2016-10-17 19:47:37	gentooinstaller	n11cky, i dont know myself but i had some loose files that were making startx think i was still using an older driver so perhaps just try manually rming the .ko files and see if 1. equery still sees them 2. if you remerge them if equery still sees them
2016-10-17 19:47:57	gentooinstaller	correct n11cky the 2nd part is needed too for convenience (the callback)

2016-10-17 20:01:09	n11cky	gentooinstaller: ZFS evangelists will tell you that fragmentation is actually preferable because the most-common use-case of ZFS is in a server on large pools where fragmentation was going to happen regardless. Ostensibly, having your file spanning across multiple disks means better read speeds because they can be done asynchronously.
2016-10-17 20:01:49	gentooinstaller	n11cky, i never ran fstrim or manually setup trim before. system is <1 year old. ssd was used in a previous computer but is relatively new. is fstrim safe to use on zfs?
2016-10-17 20:02:01	n11cky	not that I'm aware of
2016-10-17 20:02:05	gentooinstaller	ah ok
2016-10-17 20:02:12	gentooinstaller	is there any trim thing i should use on zfs?

2016-10-17 21:03:36	TuxFuk	[05:55:25] DrEeevil: what [05:55:25]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	n11cky	[05:55:42] DrEeevil: it gets more prophetic every year. [05:55:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	r4fkramer	[05:56:43] sorry, what is `idiocracy` mean [05:56:43]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	r4fkramer	[05:56:52] ? [05:56:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	n11cky	[05:56:57] DrEeevil: I'm sorry to ask again, but what is a proper fix? [05:56:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	gentooinstaller	[05:57:23] is there any penalty associated w/ high level of fragmentation on a ssd running zfs? i was using >=50% disk at one point, but fragmentation is still pretty high after removing most of the stuff on it [05:57:23]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	@DrEeevil	[05:57:30] n11cky: rebuilding or removing the package [05:57:30]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	gentooinstaller	[05:57:32] i dont know how to mitigate the fragmentation [05:57:32]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	r4fkramer	[05:58:21] switch to `btrfs`, never has fragmentation issues [05:58:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	n11cky	[05:58:29] DrEeevil: i'll give that a shot; thanks. [05:58:29]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	gentooinstaller	[05:58:47] r4fkramer, care more about date integrity than fragmentation %. just wondering if theres any reason i should be concerned. i use ahci and luks [05:58:47]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	gentooinstaller	[05:59:12] so not sure if its doing trim or cant or w/e [05:59:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	n11cky	[06:01:09] gentooinstaller: ZFS evangelists will tell you that fragmentation is actually preferable because the most-common use-case of ZFS is in a server on large pools where fragmentation was going to happen regardless. Ostensibly, having your file spanning across multiple disks means better read speeds because they can be done asynchronously. [06:01:09]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	gentooinstaller	[06:01:49] n11cky, i never ran fstrim or manually setup trim before. system is <1 year old. ssd was used in a previous computer but is relatively new. is fstrim safe to use on zfs? [06:01:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	n11cky	[06:02:01] not that I'm aware of [06:02:01]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:02:05] ah ok [06:02:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:02:12] is there any trim thing i should use on zfs? [06:02:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:02:33] i used ashift=13 when i made my zpool so its aligned w/ the erase blocks [06:02:33]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:02:51] this is a desktop system [06:02:51]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	n11cky	[06:03:11] AFAIK ZoL does not support TRIM whatsoever. I don't know if that's true with regards to ZFS on the BSD's [06:03:11]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:03:38] n11cky, ah, so basically, if it ever bothers me too much, i am probably best off copying everything off and back on then? [06:03:38]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:03:57] copy, destroy zpool, recreate, copy back [06:03:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	n11cky	[06:04:52] Yeah I'd just rsync it somewhere and back. If you have another zpool you could zfs send and zfs receive the snap [06:04:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	n11cky	[06:05:31] you probably ought to just use another filesystem on your personal computer, tbqh. [06:05:31]

2016-10-17 21:03:37	monk	[06:13:02] morning [06:13:02]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	minimalism	[06:31:22] Does anyone know an alternative startx that doesn't have any systemd contents? [06:31:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@rej	[06:46:41] minimalism: startx has "systemd contents"? Sounds unlikely. [06:46:41]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	minimalism	[06:47:01] rej: It doesn't. But the only startx alternative I know does. [06:47:01]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@rej	[06:47:44] minimalism: You would usually set up some display manager. There is a lot of choice there and most of them don't use systemd (directly) at all. [06:47:44]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:47:50] In order to run Gentoo as a guest system, invoke the following command in the Gentoo guest operating system: [06:47:50]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:47:51] root #emerge --ask app-emulation/virtualbox-guest-additions [06:47:51]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:47:56] what are pro/con of doing this? seems to work for me w/o it [06:47:56]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	minimalism	[06:48:05] rej: Don't display managers all use startx? [06:48:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:48:10] i have a distcc vm running fine w/o it [06:48:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@rej	[06:48:38] minimalism: None of them do. startx is a interactive command line convenience utility. [06:48:38]

2016-10-17 21:03:37	veremit	[06:49:24] eg. sddm, lightdm, slim, xdm..... [06:49:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ilmostro	[06:57:22] anyone seen httpd failure with "sasl_canonuser_add_plugin()" error? It's preceeded by numerous lines in logs about "DIGEST-MD5 common mech free" [06:57:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:58:50] also why is there both virtualbox-guest-additions and virtualbox-additions? i see the -additions one is on 5.0.20, and 5.1.6 is on sabayon overlay (idk if thats safe to use, im on gentoo not funtoo not sabayon) [06:58:50]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:59:18] er, the guest-additions one is 5.0 [06:59:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	novns	[07:03:24] gentooinstaller, virtualbox-additions is an iso image with drivers for windows etc... [07:03:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	***	Playback Complete.
2016-10-17 21:04:36	gentooinstaller	novns, i see. well i have gentoo as a linux guest under virtualbox on windows host and so the guest additions only go up to 5.0.20 in portage... and it says to install it when running as a guest for it to work, but gentoo works fine seemingly w/o it? any reason to install it? headless, not running X or anything. just cli

2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:05:40] People hi again ! I'm having troubles to update my gentoo box. emerge still wants to install qtwayland-5.6.1 whilst the 5.6.2 is available. This triggers many "old" dependencies to 5.6.1 version of qt packages and leads to a slot conflict. How can I get my machine up-to-date, please ? [09:05:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	tdr	[09:07:25] geodb27, 5.6.2 is ~amd64/~x86 [09:07:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:08:21] indeed tdr, and I've made all necessary to have them available (or at least, I guess so) in /etc/portage/package.keyword [09:08:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	tdr	[09:08:47] geodb27, if you emerge -vp dev-qt/qtwayland what version does it show? [09:08:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	tdr	[09:09:14] package.accept_keywords  <--- the correct filename btw [09:09:14]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:09:29] Let me double-check, but I guess it's 5.6.1 [09:09:29]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:09:52] But eix dev-qt/qtwayland shows the 5.6.2 as keyworded [09:09:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:10:30] I know for the folder name, but it's a rather old laptop and I've never had the feeling to change it since it works "as-is" :p [09:10:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:11:27] It indeed wants to install 5.6.1 version and downgrade the packages that are already installed in 5.6.2 version. [09:11:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	tdr	[09:11:54] geodb27, ok try emerge -vpt =dev-qt/qtwayland-5.6.2 [09:11:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	tdr	[09:12:04] it should tell you what dep it needs keyworded [09:12:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:13:41] Just done what you adviced, and Uh ? All ebuilds that could satisfy "=dev-qt/qtwayland-5.6.2" have been masked... I don't understand... In /etc/portage/package.keywords, I have only written down : "dev-qt/qtwayland" so that it should be unmasked... [09:13:41]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:15:09] Oh... Well, found it. Thanks for your kind help tdr. It was a typo in the keyword file... Sorry for the mistake. [09:15:09]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	tdr	[09:15:35] ah good catch, good luck [09:15:35]

2016-10-18 11:19:29	LudaOtaku	Hello, I'd like to use valgrind for debug, and apparently I need to have debug enabled on glibc. If I rebuild glibc with the debug flag, will it also include debug code in all of my other programs ? My guess is no, that it will just install some more files, but I'd like to be sure.

2016-10-19 00:41:26	applejack	[08:38:41] is there a 'gentoo' way of renewing kerberos tickets automatically? [08:38:41]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	applejack	[08:38:51] or just add a cron job [08:38:51]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	Maitreya	[08:39:02] What is a 'Gentoo way'? [08:39:02]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[08:39:40] applejack, you do it the normal way [08:39:40]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	Maitreya	[08:39:44] emerge -e world && krenew ? [08:39:44]

2016-10-19 00:41:26	grawity	[08:40:18] applejack: I dunno if it's packaged [08:40:18]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	grawity	[08:40:23] but krenew from that thing [08:40:23]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[08:40:30] v [08:40:30]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[08:40:32] https://linux.die.net/man/1/krenew [08:40:32]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[08:41:04] it dpeneds whether your krb ticket is renewable or not tho, so you kdc somewhat determines [08:41:04]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	applejack	[08:41:24] windows server kdc [08:41:24]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[08:41:42] urgh, typing to AD? [08:41:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[08:41:46] tying [08:41:46]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	grawity	[08:41:49] nearly all KDCs allow renewable tickets [08:41:49]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	applejack	[08:41:49] yup [08:41:49]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	grawity	[08:41:53] but [08:41:53]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	grawity	[08:42:00] if you use AD, then either sssd or winbindd ought to do the renewing for you [08:42:00]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	applejack	[08:42:16] i don't use either [08:42:16]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	grawity	[08:42:23] maybe you should [08:42:23]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	applejack	[08:42:28] I do use nslcd [08:42:28]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[08:42:33] kerberos policy on the domain controller determines whether they are rewable [08:42:33]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	grawity	[08:42:38] ah, a DIY approach [08:42:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	applejack	[08:42:39] but that doesn't seem to renew [08:42:39]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	blyat	[08:43:58] new to gentoo, so mutch better than debian [08:43:58]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	blyat	[08:44:32] chan /HELP [08:44:32]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	grawity	[08:45:19] because nslcd doesn't do Kerberos [08:45:19]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	mrhanky	[09:04:06] anybody using matlab here? :o [09:04:06]

2016-10-19 00:41:26	Mo	[09:12:25] Hi, I like to use unity-extra/indicator-evolution for Xfce and got a bunch of deps like mono, in sum more than 130MB sources, thinking wether it's worth for a silly indicator. Is Unity in general based on Mono in some parts? https://bpaste.net/show/27d5c9401c0c [09:12:25]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	Laurenzo	[09:13:09] tdr: you have set up Kerberos on DC? [09:13:09]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[09:13:35] Laurenzo, have with extreme protest.  i prefer to use a linux kdc .. and use heimdal not mit kerberos [09:13:35]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	Laurenzo	[09:14:10] tdr, right :) sometimes there isn't much choice though... [09:14:10]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[09:14:25] AD is mit based and lacks some features of heimdal [09:14:25]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	srlegend	[09:14:40] Montana Rant: funneling the dissent right back to the beginning, while keeping everyone w-i-t-h-i-n the system they control. This one's called "Recycling the Dissent" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dDQt5bR7zo [09:14:40]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	Laurenzo	[09:14:48] tdr: what sort of setup does it require to have DC as the KDC in windows server for example? [09:14:48]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[09:15:29] Laurenzo, there's kerberos policies you need to set.  its off topic here tho, it's windows support, not gentoo [09:15:29]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[09:16:32] MO dev-dotnet/gtk-sharp is getting pulled, that uses mono (basically .net) [09:16:32]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[09:23:31] Laurenzo, gentoo has a basic kerberos guide for the linux part: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Kerberos_Windows_Interoperability [09:23:31]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	Laurenzo	[09:26:13] quality guide, as always! thanks tdr [09:26:13]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	generic	[09:27:27] building recode died with segfault http://dpaste.com/2077GWP [09:27:27]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	tdr	[09:30:04] Laurenzo, for the windows side, this goes over some stuff if you have admin there (covers through server 2008) https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj852258(v=ws.11).aspx [09:30:04]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	generic	[09:41:06] how can I get rid of a segfault ? [09:41:06]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	DeviantPeer	[09:48:39] generic: kill -9 <pid> before it segfaults :) [09:48:39]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	generic	[09:51:47] DeviantPeer: actually i found another way I enabled nls on recode and the segfault was fleeing in terror [09:51:47]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	generic	[09:52:28] I *might* delete recode first thing after I built my updates [09:52:28]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	generic	[09:53:19] just to make sure it's not coming back [09:53:19]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	generic	[09:54:30] what's the use of recode if I don't use nls ? [09:54:30]

2016-10-19 02:37:16	mar77i	you can recollect it from the backlog pretty well, I guess. first I rebooted into the old kernel. then I updated /etc/lilo.conf and removed the old kernel from boot. and then I didn't run lilo and rebooted.
2016-10-19 02:37:32	mar77i	plausible?

I've had another thought though, I'm guessing that one package in that big list of perl packages is one that hasn't been updated for the new perl (whereas the others have), and is also probably one that I don't want any more. So I might go through to find the one that doesn't have updates, and get rid of it...

2016-10-19 13:08:22	dank101	So I was compiling systemd to use udev in a bootloader thing
2016-10-19 13:08:27	dank101	It failed
2016-10-19 13:08:31	dank101	So I use eudev
2016-10-19 13:08:37	dank101	Took not even a 10th of the time
2016-10-19 13:08:40	dank101	And worked
2016-10-19 13:09:13	nabblet	Kelsar: ok, but the basic idea/problem is to get all relevant qt-dev packages to 5.6.2 (by accepting ~amd for them). Correct?
2016-10-19 13:09:21	Kelsar	surely whole systemd needs longer then only eudev
2016-10-19 13:09:42	Kelsar	nabblet: yes, upstream does not support the gentoo way of splitting things
2016-10-19 13:10:02	dank101	Kelsar, it took less than the time to compile eudev then it did to git clone systemd
2016-10-19 13:10:04	Kelsar	nabblet: they need to be the exact same verison
2016-10-19 13:10:19	Kelsar	dank101: sure, systemd repo contains much more then only udev
2016-10-19 13:10:44	Kelsar	dank101: it is like saying cloning nano repo is much fastern then cloning libreoffice
2016-10-19 13:10:57	maolang	nabblet: else you will have apps that fails to launch or work because of inconsistent versions between qt parts
2016-10-19 13:11:06	nabblet	Kelsar: yes. I just wanted to ensure I understood correctly. I accepted some qt-dev/*5.6.2 packages... but not all of them, which caused this isse.

2016-10-19 13:11:39	nabblet	maolang: thanks for the info. Now that I know what the issue is I'm fixing it

2016-10-19 13:24:30	r3g3x	maolang:  i'm using hardened-sources.  i've been doing that for along time and haven't had problems.  the only reason i have my own ebuild is i pull the latest patch from the grsecurity site.  i haven't had an issue until today.  i've used this ebuild before, but i was getting this with the previous kernel things worked with.

2016-10-19 17:31:03	tdr	CinderellaMan, use a build server and emerge -K to fetch bins from it

2016-10-19 17:31:56	tdr	CinderellaMan, apt under gentoo isn't really ever going to happen sanely.  gentoo can use bins from other distros but they are more prone to breaking or preventing other updates
2016-10-19 17:32:30	maolang	but why would you use such anyway.... the only thing it might really do is break stuff...
2016-10-19 17:32:30	tdr	CinderellaMan, use the dpkg commands to do you install, thats all apt is doing anyway
2016-10-19 17:32:52	CinderellaMan	tdr, sounds cool
2016-10-19 17:33:25	tdr	CinderellaMan, be aware that if you change your system (update) those bins may break
2016-10-19 17:34:05	tdr	CinderellaMan, writing an ebuild for using non-native bins isn't super hard usually, and it would allow you to lock down any deps that really shouldnt change.  portage has eclasses for dealing with rpms and debs etc

2016-10-19 19:07:56	garth	on a side idea, if you don't need the performance. Maybe you can remove all the nvidia support & run only off the intel gpu
2016-10-19 19:08:04	mark4	i dont think this is a mesa issue but its emerging now

2016-10-19 19:09:20	mark4	something is wrong at console level
2016-10-19 19:09:38	mark4	well. maybe its not the console. maybe its the cards themselves screwing up
2016-10-19 19:09:57	mark4	i have no idea even how to tell whats causing the flashing on and off. is it the display going off and on again?
2016-10-19 19:10:05	garth	at console level, usually is a graphic driver (in or out of kernel), or framebuffer
