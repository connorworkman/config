2016-10-17 19:45:43	gentooinstaller	n11cky, for genkernel set yes for the zfs line in genkernel.conf and for the callback line put "FEATURES=-ccache emerge spl zfs-kmod zfs" and its all good, for modular zfs that works properly anyhow, and if you use a video driver or any other kind of module addon put that in the callback i gave you
2016-10-17 19:46:15	gentooinstaller	like, if you need to compile one from portage i mean, not in-kernel modules that dont depend on external software
2016-10-17 19:46:46	n11cky	gentooinstaller: right on. I already have had the system booting for a while and setup for use with genkernel. I was just asking about getting them out of the @module-rebuild set, now that I don't need the .ko's lying around
2016-10-17 19:47:32	n11cky	I think the real important line for genkernel.conf is ZFS="yes"
2016-10-17 19:47:32		[19:47]
2016-10-17 19:47:37	gentooinstaller	n11cky, i dont know myself but i had some loose files that were making startx think i was still using an older driver so perhaps just try manually rming the .ko files and see if 1. equery still sees them 2. if you remerge them if equery still sees them
2016-10-17 19:47:57	gentooinstaller	correct n11cky the 2nd part is needed too for convenience (the callback)

2016-10-17 20:01:09	n11cky	gentooinstaller: ZFS evangelists will tell you that fragmentation is actually preferable because the most-common use-case of ZFS is in a server on large pools where fragmentation was going to happen regardless. Ostensibly, having your file spanning across multiple disks means better read speeds because they can be done asynchronously.
2016-10-17 20:01:49	gentooinstaller	n11cky, i never ran fstrim or manually setup trim before. system is <1 year old. ssd was used in a previous computer but is relatively new. is fstrim safe to use on zfs?
2016-10-17 20:02:01	n11cky	not that I'm aware of
2016-10-17 20:02:05	gentooinstaller	ah ok
2016-10-17 20:02:12	gentooinstaller	is there any trim thing i should use on zfs?

2016-10-17 21:03:36	TuxFuk	[05:55:25] DrEeevil: what [05:55:25]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	n11cky	[05:55:42] DrEeevil: it gets more prophetic every year. [05:55:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	r4fkramer	[05:56:43] sorry, what is `idiocracy` mean [05:56:43]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	r4fkramer	[05:56:52] ? [05:56:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	n11cky	[05:56:57] DrEeevil: I'm sorry to ask again, but what is a proper fix? [05:56:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	gentooinstaller	[05:57:23] is there any penalty associated w/ high level of fragmentation on a ssd running zfs? i was using >=50% disk at one point, but fragmentation is still pretty high after removing most of the stuff on it [05:57:23]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	@DrEeevil	[05:57:30] n11cky: rebuilding or removing the package [05:57:30]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	gentooinstaller	[05:57:32] i dont know how to mitigate the fragmentation [05:57:32]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	r4fkramer	[05:58:21] switch to `btrfs`, never has fragmentation issues [05:58:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	n11cky	[05:58:29] DrEeevil: i'll give that a shot; thanks. [05:58:29]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	gentooinstaller	[05:58:47] r4fkramer, care more about date integrity than fragmentation %. just wondering if theres any reason i should be concerned. i use ahci and luks [05:58:47]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	gentooinstaller	[05:59:12] so not sure if its doing trim or cant or w/e [05:59:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	n11cky	[06:01:09] gentooinstaller: ZFS evangelists will tell you that fragmentation is actually preferable because the most-common use-case of ZFS is in a server on large pools where fragmentation was going to happen regardless. Ostensibly, having your file spanning across multiple disks means better read speeds because they can be done asynchronously. [06:01:09]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	gentooinstaller	[06:01:49] n11cky, i never ran fstrim or manually setup trim before. system is <1 year old. ssd was used in a previous computer but is relatively new. is fstrim safe to use on zfs? [06:01:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	n11cky	[06:02:01] not that I'm aware of [06:02:01]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:02:05] ah ok [06:02:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:02:12] is there any trim thing i should use on zfs? [06:02:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:02:33] i used ashift=13 when i made my zpool so its aligned w/ the erase blocks [06:02:33]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:02:51] this is a desktop system [06:02:51]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	n11cky	[06:03:11] AFAIK ZoL does not support TRIM whatsoever. I don't know if that's true with regards to ZFS on the BSD's [06:03:11]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:03:38] n11cky, ah, so basically, if it ever bothers me too much, i am probably best off copying everything off and back on then? [06:03:38]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:03:57] copy, destroy zpool, recreate, copy back [06:03:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	n11cky	[06:04:52] Yeah I'd just rsync it somewhere and back. If you have another zpool you could zfs send and zfs receive the snap [06:04:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	n11cky	[06:05:31] you probably ought to just use another filesystem on your personal computer, tbqh. [06:05:31]

2016-10-17 21:03:37	monk	[06:13:02] morning [06:13:02]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	minimalism	[06:31:22] Does anyone know an alternative startx that doesn't have any systemd contents? [06:31:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@rej	[06:46:41] minimalism: startx has "systemd contents"? Sounds unlikely. [06:46:41]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	minimalism	[06:47:01] rej: It doesn't. But the only startx alternative I know does. [06:47:01]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@rej	[06:47:44] minimalism: You would usually set up some display manager. There is a lot of choice there and most of them don't use systemd (directly) at all. [06:47:44]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:47:50] In order to run Gentoo as a guest system, invoke the following command in the Gentoo guest operating system: [06:47:50]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:47:51] root #emerge --ask app-emulation/virtualbox-guest-additions [06:47:51]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:47:56] what are pro/con of doing this? seems to work for me w/o it [06:47:56]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	minimalism	[06:48:05] rej: Don't display managers all use startx? [06:48:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:48:10] i have a distcc vm running fine w/o it [06:48:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@rej	[06:48:38] minimalism: None of them do. startx is a interactive command line convenience utility. [06:48:38]

2016-10-17 21:03:37	veremit	[06:49:24] eg. sddm, lightdm, slim, xdm..... [06:49:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ilmostro	[06:57:22] anyone seen httpd failure with "sasl_canonuser_add_plugin()" error? It's preceeded by numerous lines in logs about "DIGEST-MD5 common mech free" [06:57:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:58:50] also why is there both virtualbox-guest-additions and virtualbox-additions? i see the -additions one is on 5.0.20, and 5.1.6 is on sabayon overlay (idk if thats safe to use, im on gentoo not funtoo not sabayon) [06:58:50]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	gentooinstaller	[06:59:18] er, the guest-additions one is 5.0 [06:59:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	novns	[07:03:24] gentooinstaller, virtualbox-additions is an iso image with drivers for windows etc... [07:03:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	***	Playback Complete.
2016-10-17 21:04:36	gentooinstaller	novns, i see. well i have gentoo as a linux guest under virtualbox on windows host and so the guest additions only go up to 5.0.20 in portage... and it says to install it when running as a guest for it to work, but gentoo works fine seemingly w/o it? any reason to install it? headless, not running X or anything. just cli

2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:05:40] People hi again ! I'm having troubles to update my gentoo box. emerge still wants to install qtwayland-5.6.1 whilst the 5.6.2 is available. This triggers many "old" dependencies to 5.6.1 version of qt packages and leads to a slot conflict. How can I get my machine up-to-date, please ? [09:05:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	tdr	[09:07:25] geodb27, 5.6.2 is ~amd64/~x86 [09:07:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:08:21] indeed tdr, and I've made all necessary to have them available (or at least, I guess so) in /etc/portage/package.keyword [09:08:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	tdr	[09:08:47] geodb27, if you emerge -vp dev-qt/qtwayland what version does it show? [09:08:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	tdr	[09:09:14] package.accept_keywords  <--- the correct filename btw [09:09:14]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:09:29] Let me double-check, but I guess it's 5.6.1 [09:09:29]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:09:52] But eix dev-qt/qtwayland shows the 5.6.2 as keyworded [09:09:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:10:30] I know for the folder name, but it's a rather old laptop and I've never had the feeling to change it since it works "as-is" :p [09:10:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:11:27] It indeed wants to install 5.6.1 version and downgrade the packages that are already installed in 5.6.2 version. [09:11:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	tdr	[09:11:54] geodb27, ok try emerge -vpt =dev-qt/qtwayland-5.6.2 [09:11:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	tdr	[09:12:04] it should tell you what dep it needs keyworded [09:12:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:13:41] Just done what you adviced, and Uh ? All ebuilds that could satisfy "=dev-qt/qtwayland-5.6.2" have been masked... I don't understand... In /etc/portage/package.keywords, I have only written down : "dev-qt/qtwayland" so that it should be unmasked... [09:13:41]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	geodb27	[09:15:09] Oh... Well, found it. Thanks for your kind help tdr. It was a typo in the keyword file... Sorry for the mistake. [09:15:09]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	tdr	[09:15:35] ah good catch, good luck [09:15:35]

2016-10-18 11:19:29	LudaOtaku	Hello, I'd like to use valgrind for debug, and apparently I need to have debug enabled on glibc. If I rebuild glibc with the debug flag, will it also include debug code in all of my other programs ? My guess is no, that it will just install some more files, but I'd like to be sure.
