2016-09-09 00:07:19	antonfire	throwing in the key words "permutation" and "take order into account" with no care for how they're arranged might score you points from an overworked grad student looking over an exam.
2016-09-09 00:07:21	t0by	of course you have to do it yourself.

2016-09-09 00:07:41	t0by	hellofriend, prove it.
2016-09-09 00:07:57	t0by	Explain, what is P(n,k)?
2016-09-09 00:08:03	antonfire	You're having a hard time figuring out what permutations even have to do with the question, if anything.
2016-09-09 00:08:09	antonfire	You're the one who brought permutations into the picture.
2016-09-09 00:08:19	antonfire	So if it's anyone's job to explain what they are and what they have to do with the question, it's yours.
2016-09-09 00:08:29	t0by	Actually I would be glad to explain permutations.
2016-09-09 00:08:33	hellofriend	right so tell me why i'm not on the right track ? something? explain?
2016-09-09 00:08:48	t0by	But first *read* the damn introductory section or wikipedi article and *then* ask

2016-09-09 00:13:56	tom99	I'm saying you need a lot of examples adn working with a definition to begin to grasp it.
2016-09-09 00:13:56	t0by	And permutations is probably one such thing

2016-09-09 00:15:19	hellofriend	If i used Permutations without Repetition that mean 1 2 3 can be arrange in a number of different ways from the 9 cards but how can i work out a specific order of say "123"

2016-09-09 00:18:38	t0by	Whatever, I'll give you the answer
2016-09-09 00:18:47	tom99	So I think it cheats the reader to just give a definition of compactness and prove things with it.
2016-09-09 00:19:00	t0by	hellofriend, the probability is 2 because (1+2+3)/3 = 2
2016-09-09 00:19:05	tom99	That would be like me defining E=mc^2 and then proving things with it. These things don't arise in a vaccum.
2016-09-09 00:19:13	t0by	obviously you are interested in only those three cards

2016-09-09 00:19:53	t0by	the probability is clearly P= 2

2016-09-09 00:20:50	t0by	hellofriend, you probably haven't covered it in your course, but note that this probability is non-homogeneous because of Eco's law, i.e. you do an integral over the space of possible sets and derive for small p
2016-09-09 00:20:52	tom99	But the rest of the book doesn't do this.
2016-09-09 00:21:16	tom99	Anyway this is a long-winded way of me saying I don't feel that bad when I read a definition and don't immediately fully understand it.

The coordinate vector [x]_B of a vector x with respect to a basis B = {b1,..,bn} for R^n gives the weights a1,..,an in x = a1*b1 + ... + an* bn. If C = {c1,...,cn} is another basis for R^n, then the change of basis matrix P_{B->C} takes [x]_B to [x]_C (i.e., it maps coordinate vectors in B to coordinate vectors in C). Is this wrong?

2016-09-09 01:44:06	Millennial	"linearly independent on an interval" means that there is no nontrivial linear combination vanishing on the entire interval
2016-09-09 01:44:11	Millennial	it could vanish on some specific point
2016-09-09 01:44:11		[01:44]
2016-09-09 01:44:22	Millennial	for example, x^2 and x are linearly independent in the interval [-2, 2]
2016-09-09 01:44:37	Millennial	but a linear combination could have zeroes: x^2 - x = x(x-1) for example

2016-09-09 01:55:12	Millennial	i think the problem here is that people don't really know how the determinant behaves
2016-09-09 01:55:18	Millennial	like, how exactly does it detect linear dependence?

2016-09-09 01:55:54	YoungFrog	the problem here is that det = 0 implies that the columns are linearly dependent, but they are linearly dependent *for each x*
2016-09-09 01:56:36	Millennial	they are linearly dependent in the vector space of functions over R, for example
2016-09-09 01:56:37	YoungFrog	so the constant could change with x. And here it happens, at x = 0.
2016-09-09 01:56:50	Millennial	i wouldn't say "for each x"
2016-09-09 01:56:55	Millennial	although that's not wrong
2016-09-09 01:57:17	sure	you don't have uniform linear dependance ? ;>
2016-09-09 01:57:33	Millennial	the problem is that this linear dependence is usually obvious: given f(x) and g(x), you can just use g(x)*f(x) - f(x)*g(x) = 0 as a vanishing linear combination
2016-09-09 01:57:34	majest1c	But it confuses me because they already specifiy an interval, so if it is 0 then it must be linearly dependent on that interval but if it is not 0 then linearly independent on that interval? I never even look at the interval, I simply compute the wronskian. It doesnt feel right
2016-09-09 01:57:54	Millennial	the trick of the wronskian is that this doesn't work thanks to the derivatives thrown into the mix

2016-09-09 02:18:24	sure	i don't get it
2016-09-09 02:18:24	hallberry	Let (X,A) be a fixed pair of topological spaces. Then is homology-with-coefficients A -> H_*(X,A;A) a functor of abelian groups?
2016-09-09 02:18:30	t0by	wha-
2016-09-09 02:18:36	hallberry	sorry, G -> H_*(X,A;G)
2016-09-09 02:18:43	berndl	sure: the least upper-bound property cannot be written as a first-order formula
2016-09-09 02:19:05	hallberry	in other words, is homology with coefficients functorial in the coefficient group?
2016-09-09 02:19:09	t0by	berndl, can you explicit it?

2016-09-09 02:19:23	t0by	Very interesting.
2016-09-09 02:19:26	sure	berndl: yeah but if ZFC is strong enough to internalize second order logic and ZF(C) axioms, you have a second order ZFC living inside first order ZFC, so its weird
2016-09-09 02:20:00	berndl	That's a big if.
2016-09-09 02:20:01	dalcde	There is no second-order ZFC.
2016-09-09 02:20:16	sure	what do you mean by that dalcde :>

2016-09-09 02:20:41	t0by	iZFC
2016-09-09 02:20:47	berndl	Because you need to quantify over subsets of reals.

2016-09-09 02:22:30	dalcde	(at least, in first/second order logic)
2016-09-09 02:22:56	sure	so you mean that all you have in your language are logic connectives (=> or \/ and stuff) + quantifiers + letters representing sets ?

2016-09-09 03:08:04	jfernandez	I need to estimate how long until a value is reached when the rate that a counter increases is changing over time.
2016-09-09 03:08:35	jfernandez	so the rate of change is not static
2016-09-09 03:10:00	jfernandez	The actual problem is that our DB is running out of rows (we know its max limit), but the rate that we add new rows is almost doubling every day.
2016-09-09 03:10:23	jfernandez	I'd like to know when we'll run out of rows if I know the growth rate

2016-09-09 09:53:27	t0by	m8bdum, the important idea is ("good" outcomes / all outcomes)

2016-09-09 09:53:54	m8bdum	here its just slightly weirder with two paths for good outcome
2016-09-09 09:53:55	AdyKi	Is this a valid formula to check if two points are within proximity of each other, or am I missing something?: http://imgur.com/a/AHhGa

2016-09-09 11:03:39	MrSleepy	so I approached it this way: the two folds must create one 90 degree angle (m<x + m<y = 90) because their edges must meet in the center, if their edges meet in the center the edges will make a bisector of the 90 degree angle which would make m<x = m<y

2016-09-09 11:39:43	Z-module	Here's another one, but first let's rename your ring to S, so "R" just means the reals.   S = Mat_3(R), F = {[a,-b,0; b,a,0; 0,0,1] in S}.  This F is a field =~ C, but is not in the center of S since it has some non-scalar matrices in it.
2016-09-09 11:39:54	dude12312414	then f(v) = f(rx) = rf(x) = r kx = ??? = k rx = kv

2016-09-09 13:05:14	Karlo_	I didn't see the original question, but, if you have x^2+y^2 and x+y, you can do a linear combination of (x+y)^2 and (x^2+y^2) to get (x-y)^2.
2016-09-09 13:05:38	jennifer	The sample mean and sample variance of five data values are, respectively, 104 and 4. If three of the data values are 102 100 and 105, what are the other two values?
2016-09-09 13:05:41	jennifer	that is the original
2016-09-09 13:05:56	jennifer	I got x+y=213 from 102+100+105+x+y =104.
2016-09-09 13:05:58	enthdegre3	x=213-y      so (213-y)^2+y^2 = 238991 so 213^2-2*213*y+2*y^2=238991 which you can use the quadratic equation to solve
2016-09-09 13:06:03	enthdegre3	then x=213-y
2016-09-09 13:06:06	jennifer	I got x^2+y^2=238991 from a long use of the sample variance formula.

2016-09-09 15:50:46	dalcde	Oh yes of course.

2016-09-09 18:17:24	jle`	calculus wasn't rigorously established until over a century after it was invented
2016-09-09 18:17:30	sadw	without proof, how can one know if the work was not copied?
2016-09-09 18:17:38	jle`	newton and leibniz were just literally pulling it out of their butts
2016-09-09 18:17:43	p0a	in the formal sense
2016-09-09 18:17:59	p0a	sadw: why is that important?
2016-09-09 18:18:01	sadw	jle`: really? newton invented calculus without proof like Ramanujan?
2016-09-09 18:18:13	capefeather	and I'm not necessarily saying that the movie is bad, just that it takes a lot of artistic liberties

2016-09-09 18:18:32	capefeather	like from what I read, he never saw things, just heard them
2016-09-09 18:18:32	jle`	newton appreciated proofs, most of his work was proofs
2016-09-09 18:18:41	sadw	p0a: if someone is going to earn $1m for something like Nobel prize, there should be proofs
2016-09-09 18:18:45	jle`	but his foundations on calculus were pretty flawed and mostly stemmed from intuition
2016-09-09 18:18:58	p0a	jle`: Something about infinitesimals isn't it?
2016-09-09 18:19:07	jle`	same for leibniz, except leibniz's justifications on calculus were actually literally completely wrong
2016-09-09 18:19:26	capefeather	lol
2016-09-09 18:19:34	jle`	leibniz's caclulus foudnations came from spiritual/philosopical arguments, actually
2016-09-09 18:19:41	p0a	sadw: not just proofs. it should also boost the economy

2016-09-09 18:20:17	jle`	to be fair, the idea of formal justification wasn't very refined back in their days
2016-09-09 18:20:23	sadw	p0a: well ... the most useful math i know that boosted the economy is Fourier transform, fourier series. It is the foundation of electrical engineering
2016-09-09 18:20:50	capefeather	oh yeah I recall something about that
2016-09-09 18:21:04	sadw	by the way, did Josef Fourier get rich from his economy-boosting math?
2016-09-09 18:21:09	capefeather	leibniz thought of calculus of variations as a solution to the problem of evil
2016-09-09 18:21:41	capefeather	I think trying to make math useful now is a completely wrong approach
2016-09-09 18:22:05	jle`	it's kind of funny though that leibniz and newton's calculus were thought of from completely different angles and justifications, but a century later, their results were able to be formally justified in a completely different way

2016-09-09 18:22:28	sadw	hmm ... seems religion is useful in math. Ramanujan gets his theories from Hindu gods. Leibniz got it from some spiritual, philosophical thought.
2016-09-09 18:22:52	mantra	sadw: or maybe most people (including mathematicians) used to be religious
2016-09-09 18:23:22	sadw	mantra: thomas was an atheist. Maybe that's why he was ramanujan's inferior :)
2016-09-09 18:23:24	capefeather	there's something kind of like that in quantum, too
2016-09-09 18:23:45	capefeather	schrodinger thought of waves, heisenberg thought of matrices, turned out they were two sides of the same coin
2016-09-09 18:24:06	jle`	that's a bit different though, i think, because both of their mathematical models had formal basis
2016-09-09 18:24:13	jle`	newton and leibniz were literally wrong
2016-09-09 18:24:29	capefeather	yeah it's not a great analogy but still
2016-09-09 18:24:41	jle`	none of their arguments should yield something that even came close to working

2016-09-09 21:09:29	bddy	dalcde: Err, maybe I meant not analytical, but "composed as formula without (x if condition else y)" sorry for term mangling
2016-09-09 21:09:47	bddy	for example f(x,y) = (x-y)^2 is just a plain formula without clauses
2016-09-09 21:10:02	dalcde	Do you allow max/min?
2016-09-09 21:10:07	dalcde	or absolute value?
2016-09-09 21:11:02	bddy	dalcde: if those function can be defined without clauses, yet. I know that you can define absolute value through max/min and max/min through absolute value, but I don't know how to compoe max/min from pure functions

2016-09-09 21:54:45	dzack	there's also some computational bits that give you the lag between identical signals
2016-09-09 21:55:14	Millennial	but in Q_2 you would write it as .....999999
2016-09-09 21:55:22	Millennial	99999..... is very difficult to assign meaning to
2016-09-09 21:55:49	Millennial	like, what does the first 9 stand for? is it 9 * 10^infinity or something

2016-09-09 21:57:01	t0by	I disagree. If you get billed for an amount represented as an infinite string of numbers, you at least know you can't afford it.
2016-09-09 21:57:08	dzack	neochronomo: i don't know what you mean. most real numbers have infinite decimal expansions

2016-09-09 21:58:50	dzack	promach: yeah, like say you record something with two microphones. one's farther away, so there's a delay, but the sound's source is the same. then if you take the cc and plot it, it's peak is the lag between the two
2016-09-09 21:58:56	Millennial	neochronomo: then study some analysis

2016-09-09 23:57:07	tac-tics	type theory is a sort of "make what you want of it" kind of area
2016-09-09 23:57:26	RedOrangeZ	So, just to wrap things up.
2016-09-09 23:57:27	tac-tics	I think most people who care about type theory are doing programming languages, but then there's a small number of logicians who care about it too
2016-09-09 23:57:30	a____ptr	type thoery is mostly semantics isnt it?
2016-09-09 23:57:43	tac-tics	Category theory, on the other hand, is really important to all sorts of more traditional mathematics
2016-09-09 23:58:04	dalcde	tac-tics: There are quite a lot of logicians who care about type theory, starting from Russell and Whitehead.
2016-09-09 23:58:06	kki	Makes a lot of things simpler
2016-09-09 23:58:12	tac-tics	especially because it's the natural language to express homotopy, (co)homology, sheaf theory, and a lot of other stuff
2016-09-09 23:58:34	tac-tics	dalcde: right. But it's not quite the same as, say, algebra, where everyone basically agrees on what's being studied
2016-09-09 23:58:46	tac-tics	it's all related, but kind of weakly
2016-09-09 23:58:51	dalcde	Type theory is a very general idea.
2016-09-09 23:58:57	tac-tics	yeah
2016-09-09 23:59:01	dalcde	It is not an actual theory per se.
2016-09-09 23:59:10	a____ptr	its an idea
2016-09-09 23:59:18	tac-tics	yeah. That's more or less what I would want to say about it
2016-09-09 23:59:18	kki	Combinatorics is somewhat like that as well
2016-09-09 23:59:21	dalcde	I'd say no one really cares much about the Russell/Whitehead kind of type theory.
2016-09-09 23:59:26	t0by	I am actually tempted to take type theory next semester
2016-09-09 23:59:33	dalcde	But it is a more pleasant reincarnation as NF.
2016-09-09 23:59:42	promach	dzack: even the variable to integrated is different
2016-09-09 23:59:46	t0by	If nothing else because the lecturer is the academic nephew of Peano.

I would like to know how "similar" two different sets of data for this vector field are. What is the best way to quantify this similarity?

First I calculate the constant a_(n+1)/a_n to be e^(-(k+1)x)/e^(-k*x)= e^(-x) and use that to calculate what the series converges to, by e^(-3*x)/(1- e^(-x)). But the solution says e^(-2x)/(-1+e^x).

2016-09-10 08:34:17	dude12312414	baxx: well, first suppose a prime p divides x^n. can you say p divides x?
2016-09-10 08:34:22	StarshineSpark	golball: When it's written as a fraction, it's like the parentheses are there, because the numerator and the denominator are calculated before the division. If you're retyping it in a form that is not a fraction, you have to write parentheses there.
2016-09-10 08:34:45	StarshineSpark	golball: In other words, what you originally wrote wasn't actually that fraction
2016-09-10 08:34:54	baxx	dude12312414: i don't know how to read that... :/ you're saying that a,p are coprime and that ??? divides x^n ?

2016-09-10 08:35:58	StarshineSpark	golball: So you have to add parentheses to separate the numerator and the denominator

2016-09-10 08:36:55	dude12312414	baxx: yeah, so look at a prime divisor of the gcd((a+b)^m, (a-b)^m). p must divide a + b and a - b right?

2016-09-10 08:37:17	dude12312414	well if p is a prime then p | (ab) implies p | a or p | b

2016-09-10 08:38:00	math657	yeah

2016-09-10 09:28:50	dude12312414	ok I'll try explaining with this concrete example . suppose the gcd((a+b)^m, (a-b)^m) = 10. Then 5 must divide a + b and a - b (just replace
2016-09-10 09:29:04	dude12312414	p in the earlier arguments by 5)
2016-09-10 09:29:43	dude12312414	5 divides 10, and 10 divides (a+b)^m, (a-b)^m. So 5 divides (a+b)^m and (a-b)^n
2016-09-10 09:29:57	dude12312414	since 5 is prime, 5 divides a + b and a - b
2016-09-10 09:30:12	dude12312414	so 5 also divides their difference, (a+b) - (a-b) = 2b

I'm trying to represent a model layout, and the switches/turnouts can be connected to only other track.  Is there a better way to represent that? maybe just weight the not-in-use route as maximal so that it won't be followed when I'm calculating routes?

This is new to me :X Thanks
2016-09-10 13:04:50	antonfire	The value of G-F at any number x is the value of G at that number minus the value of F at that number. In other words, (G-F)(x) = G(x) - F(x) for any number x. For instance, (G-F)(3) = G(3) - F(3).

2016-09-10 13:16:25	mildfate	Actually, here's a better example for this specific example, how would I know from the notation alone that the shapes that are adjacent to a single 12-sided polygon alternate square, hexagon?
2016-09-10 13:16:45	mildfate	As opposed to some other pattern, e.g. square, hex, hex, square, ...
2016-09-10 13:17:09	mildfate	better question*
2016-09-10 13:17:42	mildfate	Wait, I think I see
2016-09-10 13:17:49	antonfire	because each vertex has a square, a hexagon, and a dodecagon meeting at it, and if you had "hex, hex" as you were going along the boundary of a dodecagon then the vertex between those hexes wouldn't have a square it it, it would have two hexes instead.

2016-09-10 13:29:26	baxx	with implicit differentiation sometimes i differentiate both x and y with respect to a third variable so that I treat both variables the same whilst differentiating (say use t or whatever), then at the end use chain rule dy/dx = dy/dt * dt/dx ... just wondering if there's anything daft I'm opening myself up to there ?

2016-09-10 14:35:36	@Cale	I'd like to ask everyone else not to mention it, it'll just make it easier for me to point out who to ban

2016-09-10 14:43:16	@Cale	illustion: Okay, so take two distinct lines
2016-09-10 14:43:21	Padawan-	I think.
2016-09-10 14:43:24	dzack	does it take on the subspace topology?
2016-09-10 14:43:33	@Cale	Well, yeah, you need a topology

2016-09-10 14:44:14	illustion	we consider pi : R^{n + 1} —> RP^n and we use the natural map.

2016-09-10 14:44:27	tac-tics	R^{n+1} is only hausdorff if you're using the classical topology :>
2016-09-10 14:44:44	Padawan-	tac-tics: That's not true.
2016-09-10 14:44:48	illustion	and we just define the topology on RP^n to be the quotient topology.
2016-09-10 14:44:49	@Cale	Padawan-: The "ordinary" points on the projective plane are the lines which have a nonzero last component (by convention)
2016-09-10 14:45:08	Padawan-	(Any space is Hausdorff when equipped with the discrete topology.)
2016-09-10 14:45:22	tac-tics	ah, whoops. I misread as RP instead of R
2016-09-10 14:45:31	illustion	Let [x] neq [y] be elements of RP^n so that we have two different lines through the orgin.
2016-09-10 14:45:32	@Cale	Padawan-: I mean, a point on that line has a nonzero last component -- equivalently, it intersects the hyperplane x_n = 1
2016-09-10 14:45:55	Padawan-	(What is true is that you couldn't keep as much compacts and at the same time hope for more separation, i.e. keep Hausdorff)
2016-09-10 14:45:55		[14:45]
2016-09-10 14:46:34	Padawan-	Cale: Yeah, okay.

2016-09-10 14:46:44	illustion	well if we have two points on the line I do agree we can seperate them
2016-09-10 14:46:55	illustion	but how can we sperate the whole two lines from each other ?
2016-09-10 14:47:03	Padawan-	So \infty is actually that line that never intersects the hyperplane x_n = 1.
2016-09-10 14:47:26	@Cale	illustion: Well, the lines are not the same line. So they will intersect the unit sphere in two distinct points, for example.
2016-09-10 14:47:40	dzack	as long as both points aren't zero, you can take open balls in R^n+1

2016-09-10 14:50:55	@Cale	illustion: So I don't know which spaces you already know to be Hausdorff, but the unit sphere is Hausdorff, because it's a subspace of a Hausdorff space (R^(n+1)), and so you can pick a pair of open sets in the unit sphere which separate the intersections of the lines with the unit sphere. Let's call those open sets of the sphere U_s and V_s. Then you can extend those to be open sets of R^(n+1)\{0}

2016-09-10 15:31:16	physixer	I googled 'math bachelor curriculum' and I don't find any discussion on 'Geometry'.
2016-09-10 15:31:40	dalcde	There are many branches of what you would call geometry, eg. topology, differential geometry, algebraic geometry.
2016-09-10 15:31:58	dalcde	I feel sorry for you if your undergrad curriculum does not included these.

2016-09-10 16:45:32	frogbasket	why do we call such and such a homomorphism a "representation"? what's the intuition? e.g., permutation representation
2016-09-10 16:45:52	frogbasket	we're representing something in a different setting?
2016-09-10 16:46:08	dalcde	Usually you have a group G which comes with a canonical action on some set X, eg. GL(V) on V or S_n on [n].
2016-09-10 16:46:19	dalcde	Then a representation of a group H is a homomorphism H -> G, which induces an action on X.
2016-09-10 16:46:37	dalcde	(action of H on X)
2016-09-10 16:46:46	frogbasket	I mean, I can read what a representation *is*, but why is it called a representation?

2016-09-10 16:53:59	dzack	because when I hear representation, I always think of something like realizing Sn as certain matrices
2016-09-10 16:54:24	@Cale	frogbasket: Well, you start out with this abstract group -- its elements might not *be* anything in particular, and you're forming an isomorphism between that abstract group and a group whose elements are functions of a particular sort.
2016-09-10 16:54:45	dalcde	(a representation need not be an isomorphism, or injection)
2016-09-10 16:55:09	frogbasket	so, it's like "realizing" the group as something concrete?

2016-09-10 16:57:04	frogbasket	heh
2016-09-10 16:57:09	dzack	I just think of it as a kind of relabeling
2016-09-10 16:57:22	dzack	one that's compatible with the group structure in certain ways
2016-09-10 16:57:42	@Cale	As dalcde rightly points out, it turns out to be profitable to not only study the faithful (injective) representations, but arbitrary group homomorphisms to a symmetric group or to GL(V) or something like that.

2016-09-10 16:58:56	@Cale	But still the idea is that you've taken the elements of your group, and now you've associated them with linear operators or permutation functions or something, and you can apply some linear algebra or combinatorics to them to perhaps get some additional insight into how your original group works.

2016-09-10 18:51:36	ollien	extremely stupid question: I'm trying to simplify ((e^x+e^(-x))^2-(e^x-e^(-x))^2)/(e^x+e^(-x))^2. WA says this is the simplification if x>0: 1-(e^x-e^(-x))^2/(e^(-x)+e^x)^2. For the life of me, however, I can't figure out why this wouldn't work if x<=0. Can someone point me in the right direction?

2016-09-10 18:54:40	ollien	the important bit is that it can't be 1-(e^x-e^(-x))^2/(e^(-x)+e^x)^2 for some reason

2016-09-10 20:17:25	antonfire	One reason you might care is that a lot of formulas from spherical geometry translate to hyperbolic geometry by replacing some trig functions with hyperbolic trig functions.

2016-09-10 20:18:24	antonfire	Well, it's a geometric interpretation of sinh and cosh in terms of a standard hyperbola, the same way the usual "unit circle" picture gives you a geometric interpretation of sin and cos in terms of a standard circle.

2016-09-10 20:21:32	antonfire	You might ask why we care about the area rather than the distance along the hyperbola. One reason is that the unit circle picture "lives naturally" in the usual Euclidean space with the usual notion of distance, but the hyperbola picture "lives naturally" in Minkowski 1+1 "spacetime" with a weird notion of distance. But the notion of area is not weird, it's the same, so it's easier to just formulate
2016-09-10 20:21:38	antonfire	everything in terms of area intstead of scaring children with phrases like "Minkowski space"

2016-09-10 20:26:11	ollien	and the height of the triangle is sin(theta)

2016-09-10 20:43:42	int-e	ollien: (1/2)cos(theta)sin(theta)r^2 is the area of a triangle. theta r^2/2 is the area of a sector of the circle.
2016-09-10 20:43:47	ollien	int-e yep.
2016-09-10 20:43:49	ollien	just realized that
2016-09-10 20:43:59	ollien	ok, my tangent aside
2016-09-10 20:44:09	ollien	is the hyperbolic sine just right triangles along the hyperbola?

2016-09-10 20:44:12	lotrry	oh theres a double integral
2016-09-10 20:44:17	ollien	int-e ahaha
2016-09-10 20:44:43	antonfire	Anyway, cos and sin show up basically because (cos t, sin t) is the solution to the differential equation d/dt (x, y) = (-y, x) with initial conditions (x(0), y(0)) = (1, 0).

2016-09-10 20:45:17	antonfire	Lots of linear differential equations in two dimensions can be transformed into that one with a change of coordinates, so cos and sin end up in the solutions of those as well.

2016-09-10 20:45:50	antonfire	cosh and sinh show up for the same reason, with the only difference being that you have d/dt (x, y) = (y, x) instead.
2016-09-10 20:46:24	antonfire	That circle is a picture of the path that the solution to the first differential equation traces out.

2016-09-10 20:47:01	lotrry	how*
2016-09-10 20:47:03	int-e	ollien: (and of course they're only triangles in a vague infinitesimal interpretation)
2016-09-10 20:47:13	ollien	That went way over my head. Is there a way to explain it without diff eq?
2016-09-10 20:47:18	ollien	lotrry it's the same idea
2016-09-10 20:47:21	int-e	lotrry: they're areas.
2016-09-10 20:47:25	lotrry	how is it the same ?
2016-09-10 20:47:40	lotrry	int-e how meaning why exact same?
2016-09-10 20:47:41	antonfire	Unfortunately the pictures hide the information of how *fast* the solution moves along that path at various points, so if you want a nice geometric picture you need some way to indicate how much time has passed between when the solution was at (1,0) and the point you're interested in.
2016-09-10 20:48:10	lotrry	and how does them being same tell us anything?
2016-09-10 20:48:14	int-e	lotrry: it's an analogy. also why are you dumbing down somebody else's question?
2016-09-10 20:48:23	antonfire	It turns out that in both pictures the area that's drawn corresponds pretty nicely to that time, but with an annoying factor of 2.
2016-09-10 20:48:25	mantra	it's what lotry does best
2016-09-10 20:48:52	antonfire	In the circle picture, the distance along the circle also corresponds nicely to the amount of time that has passed, without the annoying factor of two, so usually if you only care about that picture, you'll just use that.
2016-09-10 20:49:02	lotrry	int-e what does dumbing down mean?
2016-09-10 20:49:02		[20:49]
2016-09-10 20:49:17	antonfire	In the hyperbola picture, the distance along the hyperbola does not correspond to the amount of time that has passed, since the solution doesn't move at constant speed along the hyperbola.
2016-09-10 20:49:17	int-e	...
2016-09-10 20:49:38	lotrry	int-e if thats anerican english i really dont know because im from a third world country
2016-09-10 20:49:41	antonfire	So if you want a nice analogy between the two, you need to use something other than the distance, and people usually go with the area.

2016-09-10 21:30:52	Tars	go ahead lotrry i'll help you
2016-09-10 21:30:54	mxms	so i assume the same for all non-negative functions also on [0,1]? dalcde
2016-09-10 21:30:56	mxms	or maybe not

2016-09-10 21:31:21	lotrry	:/
2016-09-10 21:31:24	mxms	Which of the following sets (with natural addition and multiplication by a

2016-09-10 21:31:47	mxms	you get a vector whcih is not in that set
2016-09-10 21:31:58	Tars	i believe because cosine * h is != to cos
2016-09-10 21:32:05	t0by	dalcde: what's with the question?
2016-09-10 21:32:07	lotrry	how so Tars

2016-09-10 21:33:06	mxms	so for a vector space V, you need every v in V to have a w in V also such that v+w = 0
2016-09-10 21:33:11	Tars	The difference is that they are two different functions.
2016-09-10 21:33:20	dalcde	mxms: You don't really have to assume that.
2016-09-10 21:33:22	Tars	Equations, rather.
2016-09-10 21:33:22	lotrry	how?
2016-09-10 21:33:30	mxms	dalcde: no thats part of my definition?
2016-09-10 21:33:33	dalcde	It follows from the other axioms, since w is given by (-1) * v.
2016-09-10 21:33:34	Tars	Because they are not equivalent.
2016-09-10 21:33:36	lotrry	i dont understand what cosh is

2016-09-10 21:33:51	mxms	its just the fact that (-1)*v must also be in the vector space
2016-09-10 21:33:56	dalcde	lotrry: What's the difference between a car and an elephant?

2016-09-11 01:00:20	l_coal	Basically just algebraic stuff relating to number theory

2016-09-11 01:05:10	l_coal	Nice, you would have to decide between DAMTP and DPMMS right?

2016-09-11 05:08:29	ski	mantra : btw, note that "|f(x),f(y)|<e when y satisfies d(y,x)<d" is a universal quantification of `x',`y' (unfortuantely not stated explicitly), wrapping an implication. conceivably, your quantification of `n' could be inside the quantification of either or both of `x',`y', and if both, then possibly inside the antecedent or consequent of the implication. though it sounded like, from what you last said, that the quantification of `n' is outside all of those 
2016-09-11 05:08:44	lama	i guess ordinary OR that is used in talking is really an logical XOR, so thats the confusion

2016-09-11 05:50:24	Nimitz14	ive got a question about the upper bound property. i dont get the definition for a least upper bound: "A real number x is the least upper bound (or supremum) for S if x is an upper bound for S and x ≤ y for every upper bound y of S." it seems to me that there can exist only one upper bound, so how can one have several, it's not like the reals are a partially ordered set right?

2016-09-11 08:45:42	pedro3005	Z-module, you could take a chart for (0, infty), and a homeomorphism (0, infty) to R, and use that to push the chart forward as a chart for R, and you'd get per definition a diffeomorphism, sure. but the chart you get on R would not necessarily be compatible with the identity chart of R -- this happens only when the homeomorphism you started with was a diffeomorphism

2016-09-11 12:19:21	antonfire	If you have a way to evaluate sums of values of f over rectangles like the ones we're talking about, i.e. a way to evaluate F, then you can cleverly subtract and add these to recover values of f at points in the grid.
2016-09-11 12:19:28	bollu	antonfire: F(n) - F(n / 3) will give you one thin vertical strip right?

2016-09-11 12:37:48	antonfire	So convolving with the constant sequence corresponds to taking the sequence of partial sums of a given sequence.

2016-09-11 12:59:09	antonfire	There are lots of other choices in this case, though; you could rearrange the primes first or whatever. This choice makes stuff besides just pointwise multiplication meaningful though, e.g. differentiation with respect to x.
2016-09-11 12:59:23	Millennial	dude12312414: here's one funny thing you might try to do: say that you have a finite extension of local fields L/K, and you have some finite-index O_K-submodule M of O_L, you want to figure out whether M = O_L or not

2016-09-11 13:19:32	dude12312414	yeah
2016-09-11 13:19:42	Millennial	a very cute proof of this fact relies on the topology of Q_p
2016-09-11 13:20:23	Millennial	that is, the p-adic exponential gives a map p Z_p -> (1 + p Z_p)*
2016-09-11 13:20:43	Millennial	and pZ is dense in pZ_p, so its image under the exponential map is dense and cyclic in (1 + p Z_p)*

2016-09-11 13:21:05	Millennial	now, taking the projection onto Z/p^n Z gives a finite set

2016-09-11 13:28:01	dude12312414	well it's just the similarity, because you get that the unit group of GF(p^n) is cyclic

2016-09-11 13:28:11	 *	dalcde recalls proving that recently.
2016-09-11 13:28:13	Millennial	yes, but GF(p^n) is a very different structure
2016-09-11 13:28:36	dalcde	I think there is an elementary approach, where you start with a primitive root mod p and the lifting it up to primite roots mod p^n inductively.
2016-09-11 13:28:38	Millennial	and that's not the primitive element theorem, btw
2016-09-11 13:28:56	antonfire	once you have a generator of Z/pZ, it's pretty easy to argue that it lifts to a generator of Z/p^kZ by induction on k. Probably if you think about it hard enough this argument and the construction of the complex exponential in the p-adics are probably the same thing.
2016-09-11 13:28:58	dude12312414	oh yeah that's from Frobenius automorphism

2016-09-11 13:35:16	antonfire	The key step is showing that the exponential is actually surjective as a map p Z_p -> (1 + p Z_p)*, and it's not clear to me whether this abstract nonsense actually gives you a nice way of doing that or just brushes it under the carpet.

2016-09-11 14:41:31	dzack	like if you map the nodes like this: 1->1, 2->3, 3->2, then there's an induced function that maps the edge 1-2 -> 1-3
2016-09-11 14:41:52	dzack	and if you imagine all of the nodes pinned to the paper so they can't move, you'd end up drawing the same picture as graph 2

2016-09-11 14:43:32	dzack	the graph itself is just data like "there are nodes 1,2, and 3, where 1 is connected to 2."
2016-09-11 14:43:39	batzy	it's essentially the same graph after relabeling no?
2016-09-11 14:44:02	batzy	right so if you relabel graph 3 you can obtain the description of graph 2

2016-09-11 19:16:01	jle`	it means that the quesiton is asking for the derivative of y with respect to x, when f is kept constant
2016-09-11 19:16:23	roggenrolla	taking the integral of both sides won't help...
2016-09-11 19:16:46	jle`	if C is a constant, what is d/dx C ?
2016-09-11 19:16:55	roggenrolla	0

2016-09-11 21:21:40	antonfire	The image is not necessarily closed under composition of compatible arrows, because two arrows in the image might be compatible even though the ones in the domain category aren't.

2016-09-11 21:22:32	antonfire	I'd argue that if it technically worked out, that would be a sign that it's philosophically fine. I.e. it technically doesn't work out for the same reason that it's philosophically wrong. Kind of hard to actually make sense of counterfactuals like that, though.

2016-09-11 21:30:25	antonfire	it's not about distinguishing, it's about the fact that the set of arrows in B which are images of arrows in A doesn't actually form a subcategory of B.

2016-09-11 21:37:08	t0by	Googling is allowed.
2016-09-11 21:37:40	Limona	logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base, must be raised to produce that number
2016-09-11 21:37:49	t0by	Opposable thumbs and ability to Google definitions is what, in fact, distinguishes us from capuchin monkey and psych majors.

2016-09-11 22:29:04	Millennial	then write down the fucking function
2016-09-11 22:29:09	sure	because rational are dense, so it would work

2016-09-11 22:29:59	a____ptr	the 'engineering' way to solve this is simply to have some timer for the function does_it_halt, and if its too long, you just return "maybe" or something equivalent
2016-09-11 22:30:15	Longor	And if I combine ANY two finite functions, the runtime should not just become infinite, unless recursion or loops operating on 'things' is involved.

2016-09-11 22:34:12	sure	and infinity isn't a "number"

2016-09-11 23:57:56	uberB	parsnip: do you mean like (aa- ab) ?
2016-09-11 23:57:56	lieven	powerpower: look up Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind
2016-09-11 23:57:57	t0by	you systematically refuse to do that and start a stream of chitchat
2016-09-11 23:58:04	t0by	you are terrible at being helped.
2016-09-11 23:58:06	parsnip	uberB: yes, perfect
2016-09-11 23:58:13	t0by	no. talk.

2016-09-11 23:58:38	powerpower	sorry then
2016-09-11 23:58:38	t0by	I could ask the same question of moongazer
2016-09-11 23:58:39	parsnip	uberB: okay, can you do that for that whole thing, (a-b)*a - (a-b)*b, and share the result?
2016-09-11 23:58:50	moongazer	t0by: Minimize h^2+k^2 subject to h-k = a . Therefore we have h = a/2 and k = a/2 for a even and (a+1)/2 and (a-1)/2 for odd
2016-09-11 23:58:59	uberB	parsnip: (aa - ab) - (ab - bb)
2016-09-11 23:59:24	parsnip	uberB: perfect, now _carefully_ distribute that subtraction.

2016-09-12 00:26:16	dalcde	Not grading encourages doing it yourself.
2016-09-12 00:26:21	sure	people always did that before internet, they went to look for the result in books
2016-09-12 00:26:26	sure	or from the students who succeeded
2016-09-12 00:26:40	kmh_	simply not to take any chances in case the exam for the remaining 70% tirned out to hard (which it often was)
2016-09-12 00:26:55	parsnip	i think nerds got more benefits in the olden days.
2016-09-12 00:26:58	mantra	kmh_: right
2016-09-12 00:27:03	kmh_	dalcde,  yes
2016-09-12 00:27:04	sure	people cares more about grade than understanding
2016-09-12 00:27:11	sure	because that's how the selection system works
2016-09-12 00:27:28	kmh_	sure,  yes that's an adaption to the rules
2016-09-12 00:27:37	mantra	also homework is pretty pointless if you're not getting any feedback

2016-09-12 00:27:56	sure	yeah a bad one kmh_, because if you're a student with high integrity and don't try to "copy what you don't understand", you'll be under estimated

2016-09-12 00:28:18	mantra	pretty pointless

2016-09-12 00:28:57	kmh_	sure, yes but the not completely lazy students usually copied and tried to understand the copied material

2016-09-12 00:46:29	dalcde	I think injective/projective resolution is equivalent to taking fibrant/cofibrant replacements in some model category.
2016-09-12 00:46:46	dalcde	And derived functors should be Quillen derived functors in some appropriate category.

2016-09-12 01:55:00	jasondockers	the epsilon-delta definition of continuity for the reals loosely / intuitively states that for a function from the reals to the reals there's always some set of points within delta such that there there's no vertical distance between them? |f(x) - f(a)| < epsilon for all epsilon > 0. so, in other words, pretty simply for all epsilon > 0, there exists some delta >0, |y-x|<delta => |f(y)-f(x)|<epsilon, and since this has to hold
2016-09-12 01:55:00	jasondockers	for every y (should include for all y), this means everywhere on the plot there are no vertical jumps?

2016-09-12 03:27:54	sure	is the universal property a much stronger statement ?
2016-09-12 03:28:15	dalcde	sure: It is second-order induction, not first-order induction (I think).

2016-09-12 03:28:46	Cale	l_coal: All the applications of physics in making our lives better come from the extent to which we've been able to use it to predict the future.
2016-09-12 03:28:48	sure	i guess it makes sense
2016-09-12 03:28:54	dalcde	First order induction is about formulas, ie. for each formula P, if P(0) and P(n) -> P(n+1), then P is true for all n.
2016-09-12 03:28:56	l_coal	Yeah, but it wasn't necessarily developed with benefit in mind either, I think prediction is just a byproduct of what physics happens to be
2016-09-12 03:29:13	dalcde	Second order induction says for each A \subseteq N, if 0 in A and n in A -> (n+1) in A, we have A = N.
2016-09-12 03:29:21	lieven	murdock: Goodstein's theorem is true in the sense that any test of it (barring problems like the limited size of our universe) will check out
2016-09-12 03:29:31	sure	i see
2016-09-12 03:29:41	dalcde	You can sort of see that second-order induction is stronger because there are more subsets of N than formulas.
2016-09-12 03:29:44	sure	second order one is like probing every subset
2016-09-12 03:29:46	sure	yes
2016-09-12 03:29:51	Cale	l_coal: Of course, from a certain standpoint, describing what "is" in a meaningful way necessarily entails making predictions about how things will behave.
2016-09-12 03:30:00	sure	well there are |R| such ones :>

2016-09-12 03:31:39		[03:31]
2016-09-12 03:31:45	berndl	Never heard of "second-order" induction. It seems equivalent to first order induction.

2016-09-12 03:32:43	Cale	l_coal: and so it doesn't really apply to mathematics properly in my head
2016-09-12 03:32:49	l_coal	Oh I've never really cared but leaned on discovery for physics and invent + discovered for math
2016-09-12 03:32:57	sure	Cale: well, if meaning is "absolute" (ie in nature for real), then it discovered ;}

2016-09-12 03:35:00	sure	i think that believing in "discovered maths" rather than invented also allow to look for less arbitrary maths and helps intuition
2016-09-12 03:35:07	sure	whatever the "reality" of such belief
2016-09-12 03:35:10	Cale	sure: Well, yeah, you can always play this game where you say "oh, well, mathematics is empirically real because it's really a collection of ideas in our brains and (perhaps) we can measure that -- or at least we can come to a very reasonable consensus that all the books and lecture halls and such exist in which mathematics is being done
2016-09-12 03:35:36	Cale	But I think this is not the sort of thing that people mean when they try to say that mathematics is more fundamentally real.

2016-09-12 03:35:55	jaggz	i is fiction?
2016-09-12 03:35:56	l_coal	Cale: I think at that point it's almost a philosophical question and boils down to what axioms you choose for your philosophy (shitty way to describe it, I know)
2016-09-12 03:36:05	sure	Cale: in any case, looking for "transcending results" or concepts, free from arbitrary choices, is a good thing
2016-09-12 03:36:07	boarders	note e.g. this is not true for p=3 or 19 for example
2016-09-12 03:36:20	Cale	l_coal: It's definitely a philosophical question, and thus best not left up to the philosophers.
2016-09-12 03:36:25	Cale	:D
2016-09-12 03:36:36	sure	its an important philosophical questions that have a real impact on the way people do maths
2016-09-12 03:36:47	murdock	lieven: Okay I've done some reading of that link. I have a question: within each model of a theory, is every statement *either true or false*? Because then I think I understand.
2016-09-12 03:36:49	sure	if you believe there is some hidden meaning to find, you'll look for it
2016-09-12 03:36:51	dalcde	boarders: I dunno. It felt like the first thing to try.
2016-09-12 03:37:06	l_coal	How does it affect the way you do mathematics though?
2016-09-12 03:37:07	sure	grothendieck believed that for example, and that's how he did maths his whole life
2016-09-12 03:37:19	l_coal	dalcde would it change the way you do math?

2016-09-12 03:46:55	l_coal	It comes up to trsin
2016-09-12 03:46:58	sure	for example, one can explain the low iq and lack of developement of black people in africa by lack of good socio ecoonmic atmosphere
2016-09-12 03:47:01	mantra	no IQ isn't predictive of anything and everybody can be as brilliant as people like gauss if they just study hard and eat their vegetables
2016-09-12 03:47:07	l_coal	Training as well doesn't it?
2016-09-12 03:47:09	sure	but one can also explain this lack of good socio ecoonmic atmosphere by lack of intelligence and low iq
2016-09-12 03:47:27	murdock	dalcde: Sounds reasonable. I think those same factors make the concept of IQ itself empirically irrelevant to the individual in most cases.
2016-09-12 03:47:30	jaggz	Mantra, i don't think so
2016-09-12 03:47:38	l_coal	There are cultures where those skills aren't valued highly so their IQ will be on average lower

2016-09-12 03:49:36	sure	or read richard lynn reviews from 2004 and 2009
2016-09-12 03:49:50	fujisan	so you are saying that humans living close to the equator need less intelligence than people who live high up near the cold areas so that means that Cro-Magnums would be superior to HomoSapiens
2016-09-12 03:50:03	Cale	"Race" is an oft-inadequate oversimplification of the differences between people, which is usually irrelevant because the individual differences in ability tend to dwarf any statistical differences in collections of people of similar lineage.

As far as I know, for an atlas to give a smooth structure on a manifold M, you *only* need: if (U, phi), (V, psi) are both in the atlas, so phi: U -> R^n   and  psi: V -> R^n  are homeomorphisms, and if W = U cap V is not empty, then the overlap map   phi(W) --phi^{-1}--> W --psi--> psi(W)    should be smooth.

2016-09-12 06:40:48	antonfire	i.e. you'll remember better after running into the notation a few times in an argument and having to look it up, compared to spending that same time messing around with cards. But your mileage may vary, obviously.

2016-09-12 06:48:02	minn	brett1479: I think you could count it by first choosing the three numbers, then choosing the positions for each of the numbers. That would probably be more elegant.

2016-09-12 07:23:33	antonfire	the fact that norm(v) = 1 for the vector v that octave output means that octave has already normalized the eigenvector for you. It's scaled it to make it so that norm(v) = 1. But to octave, norm(v) isn't the sum of the components of v, and it's not the sum of the absolute values of the components of v, it's the square root of the sum of the squares of the components of v.

2016-09-12 07:51:00	antonfire	It's probably helpful to rephrase "Y is a function of (X,Z)" as "H(Y|X,Z) = 0"
2016-09-12 07:51:02	antonfire	...
2016-09-12 07:51:23	antonfire	ten minutes ago you thought the claim was H(y|a,b,x) <= H(x|a,b,y)
2016-09-12 07:51:53	antonfire	and you didn't even mention any conditions relating a, b, x, and y, so what you thought the claim was that that was true in general, or just in the specific scenario the context outlined?

2016-09-12 09:00:58	picturebilly2	Hey everyone, I have a question that has puzzled me for some time. If I have two Poisson processes in continuous time X and Y. Process X has a lambda of 2, process Y has a lambda of 3, and process Y. I want to calculate the probability of process X having three occurences more than process Y at any given point in time. Would it then be correct to calculate the probability of X being larger than

2016-09-12 09:44:10	hijosgjhgfsrhj	I can't explain it better than I already did. The any line can be described as a starting point, plus an linear combination of some vector v.
2016-09-12 09:44:15	antonfire	hijosgjhgfsrhj: when you make a mistake, the thing to do is figure out why it's even a mistake. This involved being open to the idea that you made a mistake.

2016-09-12 09:47:24	antonfire	picturebilly2: if you know that X(t) > Y(t)+3, then it's very very likely that X(t+.001) > Y(t+.001)+3, for example.

2016-09-12 09:50:43		[09:50]
2016-09-12 09:50:48	antonfire	you're admitting that you're wrong but you're refusing to check whether your answer actually satisfies the conditions that it's supposed to satisfy. Admitting that you made a mistake is the first step in figuring out why you made it. It's not the only step, and you're weren't doing a great job of cooperating when I told you to make some other steps.

2016-09-12 10:13:12	harrynoob	mrkillius24: in general, if you want to 'simplify' p(x) / q(x), you would try to find some polynomials r(x), k(x), l(x) such that p(x) = r(x) k(x) and q(x) = r(x) l(x), so you get p(x)/q(x) = (r(x) k(x)) / (r(x) l(x))

Unfortunately, the weatherman has predicted rain for tomorrow. When it actually rains, the weatherman correctly forecasts rain 95% of the time. When it doesn't rain, he incorrectly forecasts rain 3% of the time (he forecasts rain when it doesn't actually rain, 3% of the time). What is the probability

2016-09-12 12:15:35	antonfire	you're asking whether you need to do X. A complete question would be asking whether you need to do X in order to do Y.
2016-09-12 12:15:47	DirtyDeF	his collection of values and probabilities is called a probability distribution. Because random variables are used to model populations, a probability distribution is a theoretical description of a population.

2016-09-12 12:16:09	Cerpin	Sorry

2016-09-12 12:25:19	Siegfried	It is possible for John to use all distinct pairs of colors in his scarves. To show this, let’s first consider how many possible distinct pairs there are. There are 100 options for the first color, and 99 for the second color, and then we have to divide by two to take repeats into account, so the number of possible distinct pairs is 100*99/2 = 4950.
2016-09-12 12:25:19	Siegfried	Next, consider that each scarf that he knits uses 3 colors. Let’s call these colors a, b, and c. There are three possible pairs of distinct colors in each scarf: {a,b}, {a,c}, and {b,c}. Each pair can only appear on one scarf, which means each scarf created removes 3 pairs from the pool of 4950 possible pairs. 3|4950 since 4950/3 = 1650, so as we remove pairs three at a time from our pool of all possible pairs, we will eventually
2016-09-12 12:25:19	Siegfried	 use all pairs of distinct colors on the scarves without any left over.

2016-09-12 12:35:49	somiaj	Math54545: so you split it up and then put it back together. Formally there are some stipulations about what limits exist and such, but in this case it works out.

2016-09-12 12:59:29	antonfire	for instance, if A' only has a one in a million probability and B can only occur given A', then P(B) is going to be at most one million, but there's no reason to think P(B|A') has to be that small.

2016-09-12 13:02:00	Kmlor	antonfire: with regards to the implicit solution to an IVP: dx/dt = (t+3x)/(t-x), I let v = xt so  dx/dt = v + t dv/dt. Then v+t dv/dt = (t+3vt)/(t-vt) = (1+3v)/(1-v). Eventually I get (1-v)/(1+2v+v^2)dv = 1/t dt. Intergrating both sides I get -0.5 * ln(v^2 + 2v +1) = ln(t) + C. I continue on to get x = t(t-1+sqrt{e^{C}}), but that can't satisfy the x(1) = 0 condition.
2016-09-12 13:02:16	Cerpin	Which led me to writing it as a conditional probability, which I'm unsure how to break down besides using the definition of conditional probability, like I've stated above. But that requires  P(B`[intersect]A), which I  of course don't have
2016-09-12 13:02:24	antonfire	mr_yogurt: yeah, for m = 3, n = 4, the regular tetrahedron is suboptimal, it pays to move one of the vertices closer to the others.

2016-09-12 13:07:50	antonfire	A n B is empty in your case, meaning you can't have both A and B happen.

2016-09-12 13:10:57	antonfire	honestly, you probably shouldn't care that it can't be 0, the fact that you're writing that onstant as sqrt(e^C) is an artifact of the method you used to solve the problem.

So think about why it might not make sense to plug in certain numbers into the formula you're looking at, and use that to determine which numbers it makes sense to plug in there and which numbers it doesn't.

2016-09-12 14:23:43	antonfire	If you take the vector-valued function v(s) = (x(s), t(s)), then the system of equations is saying dv/dt = M v, where v is a certain matrix. Diagonalizing that matrix means you can rewrite it in the form d/dt (Sv) = D (Sv), where D is a diagonal matrix, which makes it easy to solve for Sv because now the two equations in the system don't interact.

2016-09-12 15:57:29	dalcde	Wow thanks.
2016-09-12 15:57:53	KarinaHansenD	I'm asked to calculate the mean of 'winnings' of a roulette roll (37 slots), if you bet on 12 of them ($10 bet, $30 on win). I assume this is simply 30*12/37 + 0*25/37. I'm confused though, if I just plug 0 for money on lose, I get a winning of 9.7ish. Am I supposed to factor in the money used for the bet? Like -10 and 20 for winning (30-10)?
2016-09-12 15:58:13	dalcde	drazak: Are you required to do the questions?
2016-09-12 15:58:13		[15:58]
2016-09-12 15:58:14	KarinaHansenD	Sorry, $10 to bet on all 12 combined.
2016-09-12 15:58:17	Z-module	It does seem quite odd just how badly many math authors estimate the amount of effort needed to fill in various gaps in proofs. Or inconsistently, maybe is a better term.
2016-09-12 15:58:25	drazak	dalcde: and hand them in...
2016-09-12 15:58:34	dalcde	... and what happens if you don't?
2016-09-12 15:58:36	drazak	dalcde: they're due on thursday but I'm trying to be somewhat industrious
2016-09-12 15:58:45	drazak	homework is either 40% or 60% of my grade
2016-09-12 15:58:46	l_coal	Z-module Yeah Dummit can go into too much detail some times
2016-09-12 15:58:49	dalcde	I think "this is obvious" is a valid answer, given that it's a grad class.
2016-09-12 15:59:29	dalcde	Well at least you can write *something* for the second question. I really don't know what to write for the first.

2016-09-12 19:17:39	meglomaniac	1 arrives is your new sample space because your question demands it to be
2016-09-12 19:17:44	tokimonsta	Ah yes, I meant 122

2016-09-12 19:17:50	PlanckWalk	The first is a conditional probability, the second isn't.
2016-09-12 19:18:11	meglomaniac	tokimonsta then yes that looks right
2016-09-12 19:18:26	tokimonsta	I'll retype the question: Given that exactly one package reaches its destination, what is the conditional probability it was the one mailed through the USPS?
2016-09-12 19:18:33	demiurg	- 1/12 is the answer ?
2016-09-12 19:18:50	tokimonsta	So is the condition the part where it says only 1 package went through, or is it that it's the USPS?
2016-09-12 19:18:51	meglomaniac	tokimonsta right, I think that's exactly how most people here interpreted it the first time you phrased it
2016-09-12 19:19:06	meglomaniac	only 1 package went through would be the condition
2016-09-12 19:19:15	tokimonsta	Ah okay, so the given is the condition.
2016-09-12 19:19:18	meglomaniac	right
2016-09-12 19:19:46	tokimonsta	So if I'm understanding this right, I'm solving for P(it was the USPS | only 1 went through).
2016-09-12 19:20:08	PlanckWalk	Yes, that's what you are asked to find.
2016-09-12 19:20:30	tokimonsta	And that equates to something dividied by 0.122 right?
2016-09-12 19:20:53	meglomaniac	yeah as long as you know ''reaching through USPS'' and ''reaching through other service'' are independent

2016-09-12 19:35:07	ollien	Stupid question: I'm thinking of finding the minimum of 5x^4 + 9x^2 + 5 algebraically. I thought to see where the derivative is equal to zero, so I found the derivative to be 20x^3 + 18x I set this equal to zero, and factored 2x(10x^2+9). Of course, I could factor that quadratic, but neither factor will come out to 5, which confuses me, as, looking at t he graph, the function very clearly has a minimum of 5. is there somethign I'm missing?

2016-09-12 19:37:07	ollien	somiaj that's fair
2016-09-12 19:37:09	meglomaniac	ollien and when x=0, your function has a value of 5
2016-09-12 19:37:27	meglomaniac	ollien if you wanted to really be algebraic about it though, just note that for x != 0, 5x^4 + 9x^2 >0

2016-09-12 20:10:19	antonfire	another thing you can do if in doubt about your algebraic manipulations is work through it without the summation notation, like say you only have two values for j. The initial sum is -k(P_1 log P_1 + P_2 log P_2) and you have something like P_1 = p_11 + p_12 + p_13 and P_2 = p_21 + p_22. Substitute those in.

2016-09-12 20:26:58	antonfire	If you want, you can then write all the manipulations backwards and pretend you pulled some magic out of your ass to manipulate the simpler expression into the more complicated one.

2016-09-12 21:24:23	antonfire	Well yes, if you're trying to learn about a new subject, you should read expository material on that subject.
2016-09-12 21:25:05	tom99	well you must have better publishers in your country then because introductory textbooks and material doesn't tend to look like that Gower's post.
2016-09-12 21:25:25	tom99	At least not in my coursework generally. Would you put Munkres' topology book in one category or the other? i'm curious
2016-09-12 21:25:27	antonfire	Thinking there's not enough expository writing in math is different from thinking that the norm for mathematical writing should be expository, unworked, and brutally honest.
2016-09-12 21:26:20	tom99	And what if it was
2016-09-12 21:26:31	antonfire	But you're right, I do want more lines like that in the next textbook I read.
2016-09-12 21:26:45	tom99	I'm just trying to see how far you're willing to go with this.
2016-09-12 21:26:53	tom99	Why not have it in the next group theory paper you read?
2016-09-12 21:26:58	antonfire	And I want those lines to be well-thought and pondered over by the author regarding whether it's really worth it to include them.
2016-09-12 21:27:33	antonfire	I don't want them to thrown in there because that's what the author happened to be thinking at the time, and then left there because it's "more honest".
2016-09-12 21:27:39	tom99	Even better, you can include it in section II called "Exposition". And then put all the 2 line proofs that cite Czech cohomology or whatever after that

2016-09-13 02:19:37	Svitkona	ok
2016-09-13 02:19:55	Svitkona	you wrote e^(iy) = cos(y) + i sin(y)
2016-09-13 02:19:56	Esther20	l_coal: thanks a lot for taking the time time to answer such an odd question :). I'm not convinced at 100% but I will take it. Thanks.
2016-09-13 02:20:10	Svitkona	so just write |cos(y) + i sin(y)|
2016-09-13 02:20:15	pwca	Forlorn: but I think there are several things at work that make 0.999... difficult for students to appreciate. for one they tend to see limits as processes that are somehow ongoing, whereas if they are convergent they're actually just some real number. another thing is that people automatically assume infinitesimal exists in the reals.
2016-09-13 02:20:17	Svitkona	you can take the modulus directly
2016-09-13 02:20:42	vyadhaka	i understand till |cos(y) + i sin(y)|

2016-09-13 02:21:08	Svitkona	er no
2016-09-13 02:21:17	dalcde	pwca: I think the problem is that many people assume that you can randomly write down an expression, and expect it to automatically have a unique well-defined meaning.

2016-09-13 02:22:27	pwca	I think the whole "..." business also confused people because they're not sure what it means.
2016-09-13 02:22:34	vyadhaka	Svitkona, no, I understand the euler's identity, then how to proceed to show that |cos(y) + i sin(y)| = 1
2016-09-13 02:22:46	dalcde	pwca: Yes, but you have to *make* that definition. You can't discuss anything without having a precise definition.
2016-09-13 02:22:51	pwca	you can pump their intuition by asking them if 1/3 = 0.333... is a number or a limit.

2016-09-13 02:39:33	Millennial	mantra: that definition requires you to put a bound on ||f - g|| that is *independent* of f and g
2016-09-13 02:39:36	Millennial	it should be a constant
2016-09-13 02:39:40	Millennial	that works for every choice of f and g
2016-09-13 02:39:41	FinrodFaithful	Because I think that inflationary theory is really interesting and helps us understand what may have happened right after the Big Bang
2016-09-13 02:39:45	Millennial	but you can't find such a constant
2016-09-13 02:39:55	Millennial	so BC(X, R) is not bounded
2016-09-13 02:40:18	t0by	FinrodFaithful, okay, and your interest in understanding what may have happened right after the Big Bang is?
2016-09-13 02:40:25	mantra	Millennial: as in, the supremum doesn't exist?
2016-09-13 02:40:28	t0by	Because you've just literally counted 32 zeroes by hand.
2016-09-13 02:40:31	FinrodFaithful	I'm just curious
2016-09-13 02:40:39	Millennial	mantra: you could see it that way, yes

2016-09-13 02:45:33	bithon	hello if I was given some binary operation defined as u * v = u + av + 2 and asked to find all of the possible values of a from R so that the operation is associative, it's fair to assume that the algebraic structure in which I can operate is at very least (R, *) and that therefore u, v can be from R ?

2016-09-13 03:43:07	t0by	I still think an "intro to proofs" class should use exclusively sticks, balls and domino cards for the first term.
2016-09-13 03:43:25	t0by	Stuff that does not obfuscate the reasoning... like in this case.
2016-09-13 03:44:21	t0by	If you kick off with a super broken way of proving stuff about asymptotic growth...

2016-09-13 03:46:50	t0by	i.e. <t0by> so I *guess* you can show that if for some x > x_0 |f(x)| <= M|g(x)| then |f(x+1)| <= M|g(x+1)|

2016-09-13 06:31:42	Z-module	baxx, the integral used in   \int |f|^p     for these is really a Lebesgue integral, and that number being finite means "f^p is Lebesgue integrable" (over the given domain which could be unbounded, for example all of R); that's where the "L" comes from.  So L_1 is just the Lebesgue integrable functions. You'll also come across  l_p  (lowercase) which refers to sequences (x_n) such that  \sum |x_n|^p  is finite.

2016-09-13 12:04:37	Millennial	the fact that you can translate the plane in R^3, i.e it doesn't have to pass through the origin gives you one more degree of freedom

What I did was say that -ln(1+sqrt(|x|)) <= ln(1+sqrt(|x|))*sin(1/x) <= ln(1+sqrt(|x|)), and since lim as x->0 of ln(1+sqrt(|x|)) is 0, lim as x->0 of f(x) is 0, and thus, is continuous

2016-09-13 12:30:28	math282	Hi there. Looking for some help on whether or not i'm using the correct procedure to factor out a term. What I have is x^2-(9y^2+36y). I'm trying to factor out the 9 from the y terms. I end up with x^2-9(v^2+4) - Is this correct or does the sign between the x term and the rest change to positive?

2016-09-13 12:37:09	kadoban	The former is better if it's a medium sized range *and* you're using most of it. The latter works better if the range is huge and you're using almost none of it, comparatively.

2016-09-13 13:09:34	Levitator	This is math.
2016-09-13 13:10:22	Indivicivet	Levitator: then you don't reaaally need to know the definition of a derivative, probably just what it represents and how to calculate it for closed form functions
2016-09-13 13:10:39	Levitator	Or yell at Indivicivet for having the audacity to inquire about my application. Or change the channel name to #pure-mathematics
2016-09-13 13:10:48	Indivicivet	and for the latter you just memorize a couple of things (sin, cos, x, yayayaya) and use chain rule and product rule
2016-09-13 13:11:00	Levitator	I have no idea what those are.
2016-09-13 13:11:24	Indivicivet	Levitator: admittedly your comment about capacitors means nothing to me and probably many people here, even if it's very basic, so maybe there's an engineering channel where they could tell you immediately what equation to use :P

2016-09-13 14:21:59	Millennial	one abstract nonsense proof i am fairly fond of is this: let x^n + a_(n-1) x^(n-1) + ... + a_0 = 0, rearrange as x^n = (blabla) and take p-adic norms to find that |x|_p^n <= 1, so |x|_p <= 1, i.e x \in Z_p
2016-09-13 14:22:07	Millennial	since p is arbitrary, x is in Z_p for every prime p

2016-09-13 15:14:26	Millennial	the vague "adding inverses" might provide intuition, but when you add inverses to zero divisors you can actually make your ring smaller through localization
2016-09-13 15:15:23	Millennial	if you know what you're doing, you can think about localization as forcing certain elements to be invertible

Having a bit of issues with this step, not sure what I'm missing....   ||v||^2 = (k^2)(||u||^2) + ||w||^2      we substitute for k with k = (u.v)/(u.u) = (u.v)/(||u||^2)  and then they say to multiply both sides of equation with ||u||^2 (I'm assuming to get rid of the denominator)... which I get. But what I'm having issues with is ... isn't k^2 meanin

2016-09-13 20:48:01	walb0	i can find eigenvalue
2016-09-13 20:48:13	Muyfret	there's a loop inside a loop. the loop inside the loop is for making copies of the thing outside it. but i run out of space. so i'm devising a procedure to unbiasedly overwrite things and fairly write to each area once. it's also an aim not to over-write the over-writes until necessary
2016-09-13 20:48:17	PlanckWalk	Well, that can be rearranged to (A - lambda I) x = 0
2016-09-13 20:48:36	PlanckWalk	So it's just solving linear equations.

2016-09-13 22:58:55	dalcde	Agilek: Well you have to *understand* why.
2016-09-13 22:58:58	t0by	In this case we show that exists n,k s.t. (500 = nk => 500 < 147) doesn't hold

2016-09-13 22:59:30	t0by	Now, Agilek pay attention here: P => Q is disproven *exclusively* by showing that P holds but Q does not.
2016-09-13 22:59:35	dalcde	Have you done that?
2016-09-13 22:59:55	dalcde	If you fail enough times, you would probably be convinced that it is not possible, and perhaps understand why.
2016-09-13 23:00:18	Agilek	Well..there isnt such number, right?
2016-09-13 23:00:23	t0by	So (500 = nk => 500 < 147) is disproven by *any* choice of n,k such that 500 = nk, since obviously !(500 < 147)
2016-09-13 23:00:25	dalcde	Yeah, but why?
2016-09-13 23:00:38	t0by	thus a pair n,k that renders your proposition false certainly exists

2016-09-14 00:15:58	math717	Can one of you tell me?
2016-09-14 00:15:58	Millennial	you can just think of it as taking successive quotients
2016-09-14 00:16:06	Millennial	although
2016-09-14 00:16:14	Millennial	when the exact sequence is long, that might not always be the case, so
2016-09-14 00:16:25	Millennial	long exact sequences show up in homology, and i am not that familiar with homology

2016-09-14 05:38:08	MotivicScones	but if I'm remembering right, the distribution of the number of points is weighted more heavily near the middle, so it's harder to find curves with extreme numbers of points, which could make numerical evidence misleading

2016-09-14 06:32:16	bollu	?
2016-09-14 06:32:24	Millennial	ok, so here's a short sketch
2016-09-14 06:32:36	Millennial	let's say you proved cauchy's theorem
2016-09-14 06:32:45	Millennial	i.e you know that elements of order p exist

2016-09-14 06:33:08	Muyfret	good news everyone i found a technique that worked
2016-09-14 06:33:09	Millennial	the idea is to proceed inductively: let's say H is a subgroup of G of order p^r, and r < the exponent of p in |G|
2016-09-14 06:33:10	rio	i had to substitute teach algebra once, whole lecture was proving sylows theorems
2016-09-14 06:33:29	rio	wasn't too much fun to be honest
2016-09-14 06:33:40	Millennial	you can consider an action of H, which is a p-power group, on its cosets in G
2016-09-14 06:34:03	Millennial	since |G|/|H| is divisible by p, this set has cardinality 0 mod p, and you can use the fixed point congruence principle
2016-09-14 06:34:17	rio	now we let G act on G, then let G act on subgroups of itself, hey why not let G act on another thing?
2016-09-14 06:34:25	Millennial	rio: it's so cute tho
2016-09-14 06:34:35	Z-module	There are other proofs of it of a quite different nature, but this way, using orbit sizes for actions by p-groups, really is the most direct, to my mind. bollu: you can see it all set out very clearly and succinctly in Hungeford's GTM text "Algebra".
2016-09-14 06:35:00	Millennial	bollu: you can figure out that the fixed points of this action are N(H)/H
2016-09-14 06:35:09	Millennial	which is a group, since H is normal in N(H)

2016-09-14 09:09:47	stoopkid	so, you can define the theory of groups as a proposition, structuring them from the more basic propositions of the group axioms

2016-09-14 09:32:09	Svitkona	confused, start with a true equation. if you multiply both sides of the equation by the same number, the resulting equation is also true
2016-09-14 09:32:16	t0by	moongazer, I am not 100% sure but that doesn't *sound* right. Just avoid making it a multigraph at the edge insertion phase - i.e. check first or use a mtrix representation

If there is such a thing as proving everything from an absurdity, there must always be a proof of an absurdity from one. Normally we prove negations of absurdities. Tautologies for example would not prove their own negation, but instead a negation of an absurdity.  Form now the assemblage of all absurdities which do not imply/prove their own absurdity.

Thus of the two hypotheses that it does, and that it does not prove an absurdity: each implies it is an absurdity. Our notion of absurdity must be absurd.

2016-09-14 13:28:22	dalcde	To show that, you need to deduce A -> B and B -> B under the premises.
2016-09-14 13:28:39	SrPx	wouldn't that make addition on a group non closed? can easily get members outside of it
2016-09-14 13:28:43	dalcde	The latter is obvious, while for the former, ~A and A gives False, which in terms implies B.

2016-09-14 15:32:08	walb0	Av = lambda*v, A is the matrix, lambda is some scalar, v is a vector
2016-09-14 15:32:22	collin38	what scalar and what vector?
2016-09-14 15:32:27	walb0	the eigenvector is v, eigenvalue lambda
2016-09-14 15:32:27	collin38	they are significant

2016-09-14 15:33:06	walb0	Av = 2*v
2016-09-14 15:33:09	collin38	okay so the equation says that applying the matrix A to the eigenvector v is equal to simply multiplying the eigenvector by the eigenvalue
2016-09-14 15:33:10	collin38	right
2016-09-14 15:33:21	filthy_peasant	can you make the balls infinititisimally close together (differentiate) that approximation?
2016-09-14 15:33:30	collin38	so then you get (A - \lambda I)v = 0
2016-09-14 15:33:35	filthy_peasant	sorta like a shell balance

2016-09-14 16:03:42	tom99	yeah

So you can always opt to start each one with some given symbol. This fact plus the one I just mentioned above are all you need for the result.

2016-09-14 18:34:11	rh1n0__	but finding an asymptote is about analyzing the lateral limits with 0 denominator right?
2016-09-14 18:34:26	frelleck	no the function has to go to infinity or -infinity from both sides

2016-09-14 18:37:52	frelleck	write everything in terms of exponentials
2016-09-14 18:37:54	dalcde	We have ds/dt = sqrt(cosh^2 t + sinh^2 t + 1) = sqrt(2cosh^2 t).
2016-09-14 18:38:03	dalcde	Using the fact that cosh^2 - sinh^2 = 1.
2016-09-14 18:38:20	frelleck	or that
2016-09-14 18:38:26	batzy	wait.
2016-09-14 18:38:46	dalcde	So ds/dt = sqrt(2) cosh(t). So s(t) = sqrt(2) sinh (t). So t = sinh^(-1)(s)/sqrt(2).

In the case where two conjugate pairs occur, each conjugate pair only contributes one root to the polynomial; so this doesn't yield a relationship between quadratic and quartic polynomials, but I'm sure there are other senses in which you could say there is one.

You also know that one of them is named Fred, but you don't know which one. (The other is named something else).   By asking a single three-word question to just one brother (it doesn't matter which), you can determine which of the two

2016-09-15 04:12:01	srpx	Just to check I got it right. For every prime p, there is a group of order p, consisting of the elements [1..p-1]. If p is a safe prime, there is also a subroup, of prime order (p-1)/2, which does NOT contain the elements [1..(p-1)/2], but instead, a subset of [1..p] with (p-1)/2 elements. Is that all correct?

2016-09-15 04:26:00	Millennial	ah, like so: if 2 and (p-1)/2 are both in your group, then so is (p-1)
2016-09-15 04:26:34	Indivicivet	ravenzz: then that's a_0 2^n, where a_0 is your starting number and n runs from 0
2016-09-15 04:26:47	zHafydd	dila: but the term is not necessarily C(n,n). In general, it would be C(n, nx), or something like that.
2016-09-15 04:27:05	ravenzz	a_0*2^n ?
2016-09-15 04:27:21	Indivicivet	yes
2016-09-15 04:27:32	Z-module	Oh right: in fact, if p is 1 mod 4, then for each g in the full group {1,2,..., p-1}, g is a square iff -g is also a square so the two halves of {1,2,...,p-1} have exactly the same number of squares in each; if p is 3 mod 4, then g is a square iff -g is *not* a square and there's the remarkable result (whose only known proof, I believe, uses some L-series stuff) that the first half always has strictly more squares than the second half.
2016-09-15 04:27:40	dila	ravenzz: or as a recurence relation: a_{i+1} = 2 * a_i
2016-09-15 04:28:08	Millennial	Z-module: mhm
2016-09-15 04:28:23	Millennial	that last result should rely on some kind of analytic argument, i thin

2016-09-15 05:03:52	James123	baxx, if I have (A-λI) with all eigenvalues equal, say λ1 = λ2 = λ3 and I want the generalised eigenvectors, I get one from (A-λI)v=0, one from (A-λI)^2 w = 0 and another from (A-λI)^3 u = 0. But in my case, (Α-λI)^3 = 0, so u can be anything. This is why I though that it needs to be independent from v,w. Am I doing something wrong?

2016-09-15 05:39:55	pwca	an m x n matrix is a map from R^n to R^m.
2016-09-15 05:40:18	pwca	but you want something that is an identity, which means you want n = m.
2016-09-15 05:40:33	baxx	m is always cols and n is rows

I am in an introductory programming class and we are going to be given an extra credit problem at the end of the test: write a positive integer. The student who writes the lowest unique integer will receive one extra credit point. In other words, write the smallest positive integer that you think no one else will write
2016-09-15 10:27:10	Vicky	Millennial: yeah, of course. otherwise it would be the vector (0, 0, 0,...), aka the distance 0

2016-09-15 11:37:12	tom99	Orxata___: That makes sense. You also know th at your function is >= -9/4 and therefore it is a minimum

2016-09-15 12:30:26	SuperEgg	that's a nice way to write it.
2016-09-15 12:30:35	sure	or you can also index it with edges
2016-09-15 12:30:55	SuperEgg	Now the negation is just (a_0, a_1, ...., a_k-1) but a_k-1 !=a_0?

2016-09-15 16:30:56	MiseryMyra	opraaa: You think of bijective functions as passing both a vertical line test and a horizontal line test
2016-09-15 16:30:59	MotivicScones	and the curve defined by y = x^2 is the graph of a function, but if you flip it across the line y = x, you get the curve defined by x = y^2, which isn't the graph of a function

2016-09-15 18:54:43	energizer	mjz20: How do you know there exists an inverse function of f? forall x != x', f(x) != f(x') (f injective). The contrapostive of that means there's a mapping from every value of y to not more than one x. So theres a partial function from Y to X. f surjective means there's a mapping from each y to at least one x.  So it's a total function. Thus function f bijective means it's got an inverse total function too.

2016-10-01 17:14:05	antonfire	math080: there is a shortcut like that, it's just not very short. There's a formula for the second derivative of y with respect to x in terms of the first and second partial derivatives of f, when you have the constraint f(x,y) = C. It's just not a very nice formula.

2016-10-01 17:19:28	Stooven_Hooking_	There was none. I started off with 4 coordinate pairs.
2016-10-01 17:19:36	antonfire	tom99: something along the lines of "f(1) = 1, f(2) = 11, f(3) = 111, f(4) = 1111, and so on"
2016-10-01 17:20:02	SwiftMatt	well since x and y are both 0
2016-10-01 17:20:28	SwiftMatt	you get 81x/81y, but the 81s cancel out, and you get 0/0 which is indeterminate form?
2016-10-01 17:20:45	tom99	right...
2016-10-01 17:20:53	antonfire	yes, so it doesn't actually tell you anything about the dy/dx at that point.
2016-10-01 17:20:58	tom99	I mean it's a sum 10^i
2016-10-01 17:21:28	antonfire	in particular, it doesn't tell you that dy/dx = 0 at that point.

2016-10-01 17:36:54	antonfire	Here's one that's maybe kind of an ass-pull, but whatever. You produce f(n+1) from f(n) by tacking the digit 1 on at the most significant end, giving you the relationship f(n+1) = f(n) + 10^n. You can also produce f(n+1) from f(n) by tacking on the digit 1 at the *other* end. What does that tell you about the relationship between f(n) and f(n+1)?

2016-10-01 18:07:16	antonfire	The other thing you can do is extend the sequence of partial sums in the other direction, see that it's approaching -1, which motivates thinking about what happens to 1 plus the sequence instead.
2016-10-01 18:08:07	tom99	hmm

2016-10-01 18:11:08	antonfire	The original version is much clearer "why is doubling the value of (1 + 2 + ... + 2^n) and adding 1 the same thing as increasing the value of n by 1?"

2016-10-01 18:14:30	tom99	once you have both formulas the result follows from them: g(n) - 2^n = g(n-1)

2016-10-01 18:24:48	antonfire	tom99: honestly, it may be better not to think in terms of the sequence at all. You want a nice short way to write down x = 1111111111111. 1000000000000 is pretty close, and that's 10^12. You end up with a remainder of x-10^12 = 111111111111, which looks a lot like x, so you hope that maybe you can write it in terms of x. You can, it's (x-1)/10. So x-10^12 = (x-1)/10, and therefore x = (10^13-1)/(10-1).

2016-10-01 19:43:46	drazak	does writing some extra parenthesis help you (A => B^C) <=> (~A v (B^C)) <=> (~A v B)^(~A v C) <=> (A => B)^(A => C)
2016-10-01 19:44:08	Alec	Because if you have (consults truth table) a=T, b=T, c=F, the & implication is FALSE, but the A=>B is TRUE
2016-10-01 19:44:24	Alec	Yeah you've got a chain of <=>s, so something has gone wrong
2016-10-01 19:44:55	drazak	nope, you are incorrect, if A = T, B = T, C = F, then (A => B & C) is false, so it can imply anything

2016-10-01 21:31:29	antonfire	And hell, sometimes you also end up having to go out of bounds "object-wise", e.g. talking about duals and weak topologies and junk.

2016-10-01 21:46:10	dzack	ahhh, okay, I've run into that term
2016-10-01 21:46:29	antonfire	e.g. the one from Hilbert space to Banach spaces is full. If H_1 and H_2 are Hilbert spaces, then every Banach-space morphism from H_1 to H_2 is a Hilbert-space morphism from H_1 to H_2. (Assuming we're talking about the categories where the morphisms are bounded linear functions.)
2016-10-01 21:46:35	dzack	So full and faithful are a bit like analogs of injectivity/surjectivity, right?
2016-10-01 21:47:05	antonfire	The one from normed spaces to vector spaces is not full. If N_1 and N_2 are normed spaces, then not every vector space morphism from N_1 to N_2 is a normed space morphism from N_1 to N_2.
2016-10-01 21:47:49	antonfire	Yes. All these functors are faithful.
2016-10-01 21:48:20	antonfire	One way to see this is that you also have a forgetful functor all the way to Set at the bottom, and *that* functor is faithful.
2016-10-01 21:49:04	antonfire	Meaning that, say, a morphism between Hilbert spaces is entirely determined by which points in one Hilbert space map to which points in the other one, with no additional "hair" attached to the morphism.

2016-10-02 05:40:07	baxx	right, and that should be enough to answer?

2016-10-02 05:40:46	meglomaniac	baxx well the low hanging fruit is use tan^2x + 1 = sec^2x
2016-10-02 05:41:04	meglomaniac	baxx which will give you (x^2/9) - (y^2 /4) = 1

2016-10-02 09:23:59	anton94	Suppose we have a continuously differentiable function f, and that c>0. If f'(x) -> c as x -> infinity, does it follow that f(x) -> infinity as x -> infinity? I kind of think this is the case. Surely you can have a function that has derivative >0 at all times but does not go to infinity, but the fact that f'(x) -> c as x -> infinity, does that not imply that we can find some kind of bigger lower bound than 0 for the derivative, eventua
2016-10-02 09:24:26	anton94	And then we could just use the mean value theorem to prove quite easily that f goes to infinity

2016-10-02 09:25:03	anton94	But the part I am having trouble with is the formal matters involved in proving that f'(x) -> c as x -> infinity implies that for large enough x, x>b for some b>0

2016-10-02 09:58:46	tom99	For example, you wouldn't disassemble your car down to its components and reassemble it, then go take your driving test.

2016-10-02 10:28:26	mokuso	_ohm, no, a tensor is a generalized matrix. And a vector is a specific case of a tensor, as is the common matrix. If you are into physics, perhaps go into tensors with General Relativity
2016-10-02 10:28:43	mokuso	because it looked very abstract what I saw on wiki for tensor algebra...

2016-10-02 10:46:15	Millennial	your vectors being linearly dependent amounts to you picking either the same point twice, or two antipodal points

2016-10-02 11:33:36	Millennial	Indivicivet: it behaves a lot like the real logarithm - you have the same kind of "turns products to sums" thing
2016-10-02 11:33:38	CuriousErnestBro	because now I do applied: OR
2016-10-02 11:33:38	g0th	I also learned that you can expand functions in terms of certain polynomials in several other regions (not just discs)
2016-10-02 11:33:48	Millennial	and its domain is also the same, the open ball |x|_p < 1
2016-10-02 11:33:48	g0th	I gave a talk about it (Faber polynomials)

2016-10-02 11:34:09	Indivicivet	Millennial: I think the domain of log R - > R is more than just the open ball 1+B(1) :)))
2016-10-02 11:34:15	Millennial	the domain of log(1 + x) is |x|_p < 1
2016-10-02 11:34:18	Millennial	yes
2016-10-02 11:34:21	CuriousErnestBro	enecon, that's why I picked a more applied version with stats and OR and finance
2016-10-02 11:34:24	Millennial	but that is the region where the power series converges
2016-10-02 11:34:26	laurus	I don't see why they are separating the range of x's like that.
2016-10-02 11:34:30	Millennial	and that is how you define log_p, so
2016-10-02 11:34:37	Indivicivet	that's totally cheating then :p
2016-10-02 11:34:43	enecon	CuriousErnestBro did you manage to find any cool math stuff in it ?
2016-10-02 11:34:51	laurus	To me it seems the X we should look at should depend on y, not the other way around.
2016-10-02 11:34:55	CuriousErnestBro	plus, switching now would waste 2 years
2016-10-02 11:35:09	pwca	was it someone here who talked about how you can take a strip between 1/2 and 1 of the Riemann zeta function and match a strip of any other non-vanishing holomorphic function arbitrarily well?
2016-10-02 11:35:12	Millennial	Indivicivet: for odd p, log_p is a homeomorphism from 1 + p Z_p to p Z_p

2016-10-02 11:36:41	tom99	Indivicivet, then it's the responsibility of the practitioners of IUT to write a bunch of tutorials and books to make it easy as possible to learn IUT theory.

2016-10-02 11:39:29	Indivicivet	f0x: I know it's been reviewed, I believe the point is more that once other mathematicians have had a handle on the ideas for a while, they may distill it into something more easily relatable and extract the useful tools into a more standard mathematical framework, but I'm an undergrad so I don't know anything at all really

2016-10-02 11:42:14	tom99	math520: that is a valid form of reasoning in and of itself. i'm saying i don't know the full context to determine if your proof is correct or not
2016-10-02 11:42:24	tom99	Although at first Mochizuki's papers, which stretch over more than 500 pages1¨C4, seemed like an impenetrable jungle of formulae, experts have slowly discerned a strategy in the proof that the papers describe, and have been able to zero in on particular passages that seem crucial, he says.
2016-10-02 11:42:24	g0th	I mostly worked with modular form, so if "theta link" refers to the theta from modular forms then I'm familiar with it
2016-10-02 11:42:24	Indivicivet	g0th: we did hyperbolic space under geometry, group actions under introductory vectors/groups, but Mellin transfroms and Schwarzian derivs and such seem cool

2016-10-02 11:42:35	Math520	Thanks guys.
2016-10-02 11:42:36	tom99	I think it's funny how they talk about Mochizuki as if he's dead or not there.
2016-10-02 11:42:39	MotivicScones	but at least the general outline of some sizable parts of the proof seem comprehensible
2016-10-02 11:42:48	tom99	"Let's zero in on this passage and try to understand what it _really_ means."
2016-10-02 11:42:57	g0th	I admire the riemann mapping theorem. The consequences are so vast...
2016-10-02 11:43:02	pwca	Mochizuki is notoriously reluctant to elucidate his proof.
2016-10-02 11:43:03	g0th	and far reaching
2016-10-02 11:43:25	CuriousErnestBro	pwca, not true
2016-10-02 11:43:29	pwca	which is what adds slight to injury in this case.
2016-10-02 11:43:39	f0x	pwca, mochizuki is actually very happy to dicuss his work, he just refuses to leave Japan.
2016-10-02 11:43:43	laurus	For example, if Y = 3, obviously -1 <= x <= sqrt(3) works.
2016-10-02 11:43:47	pwca	he didn't even attend the first meeting, CuriousErnestBro.
2016-10-02 11:43:55	pwca	which was in Kyoto.
2016-10-02 11:43:59	laurus	So why in goodness sakes would we only look at P(1 <= X <= sqrt(3)) in that case?

2016-10-02 11:44:15	f0x	don't forget he's a real person with other obligations....
2016-10-02 11:44:20	MotivicScones	like, as I understand it, the basic idea is to encode the theory of line bundles on the elliptic curve into the language of Frobenoids, where there's a "Frobenius-like" map even in characteristic zero, and use this to replicate some parts of the function field proof

2016-10-02 12:20:28	laurus	tom99, okay, let me ask you a question

2016-10-02 12:20:34	MotivicScones	Math520: no, it's true, but that's not what you said
2016-10-02 12:20:41	ImCluelessBut	kamog (ill obviously express it better on my paper, im mostly making sure i understand WHY its not in S)
2016-10-02 12:20:48	laurus	What is the probably that X^2 is less than 3, for -1 <= X <= 2?
2016-10-02 12:20:52	laurus	*probability.
2016-10-02 12:20:53	MotivicScones	you claimed you assumed a < c and got x_n < c for *all* n

2016-10-02 12:21:18	Math520	ah, sorry!
2016-10-02 12:21:21	Math520	No no, it is for some n
2016-10-02 12:21:24	tom99	is x a real number or a random variable? you wrote X which is the variable
2016-10-02 12:21:26	MotivicScones	okay, that makes more sense
2016-10-02 12:21:38	Math520	I thought you were asking for the statement
2016-10-02 12:21:42	Math520	not for my proof
2016-10-02 12:21:45	MotivicScones	anyway, are you just asking whether x_n < c contradicts x_n > c?
2016-10-02 12:21:55	ImCluelessBut	kamog we treat polynomial rings as rings containing tuples of coeficients, which is why i refer to the elements position

2016-10-02 12:21:57	tom99	if it's a number then it would be (1+sqrt(3)) /3
2016-10-02 12:21:59	Math520	yes, and if it also contradicts x_n >= c
2016-10-02 12:22:06	MotivicScones	I think you can answer that yourself
2016-10-02 12:22:12	Math520	I think so, but I'm not sure
2016-10-02 12:22:22	MotivicScones	is it possible for x_n < c and x_n >= c to both be true?
2016-10-02 12:22:25	Math520	because I'm consufing negation with contradiction

2016-10-02 12:22:39	Math520	no
2016-10-02 12:22:42	Math520	it is impossible
2016-10-02 12:22:44	MotivicScones	well, there you go
2016-10-02 12:22:45	kamog	ImCluelessBut: yes, that's right. Just counting is confusing (it starts with zero).
2016-10-02 12:22:47	Math520	if c!= 0
2016-10-02 12:22:54	MotivicScones	and what if c = 0?
2016-10-02 12:23:04	Math520	it is still impossible
2016-10-02 12:23:12	ImCluelessBut	kamog oh yes youre right
2016-10-02 12:23:25	ImCluelessBut	kamog so yeah, index 3
2016-10-02 12:23:27	MotivicScones	so... I'm not sure what you're having trouble with
2016-10-02 12:23:36	MotivicScones	you seem to already have a proof and to know that it's valid
2016-10-02 12:23:39	tom99	well i assumed x was a real number, then x^2 < 3 <-> -sqrt(3) < x < sqrt(3)
2016-10-02 12:23:48	tom99	but your'e talking about a random variable - big X
2016-10-02 12:24:06	laurus	remember -1 <= x <= 2.
2016-10-02 12:24:10	ImCluelessBut	kamog thank you. i may finally be starting to understandi these things heh
2016-10-02 12:24:21	Math520	I'm having trouble with understanding that x_n < c is a contradiction to x_n >= c and also to x_n > c
2016-10-02 12:24:26	laurus	So your -sqrt(3) <= x <= sqrt(3) would become -1 <= x <= sqrt(3) right?
2016-10-02 12:24:31	jclekberg	laurus, I would grab a cup of tea and study the definitions of a PDF and CDF.
2016-10-02 12:24:40	Math520	because if that is true, then I have two theorems:
2016-10-02 12:24:49	jclekberg	Perhaps you'll be able to understand manipulating them if you understand the fundamentals

2016-10-02 12:25:36	laurus	jclekberg, I think you don't know the answer either, to be honest
2016-10-02 12:25:38	laurus	Which is fine.
2016-10-02 12:25:54	kamog	ImCluelessBut:  to prove that the coef before x^3 can be non-zero you need to choose one poly with non-zero a2 and the second with b2=0 and b1 != 0.

2016-10-02 12:26:43	tom99	laurus: yes I use 1 + sqrt(3) because of that -1 being the lower bound

2016-10-02 12:27:29	MotivicScones	Math520: what's wrong with having two theorems, one of which is stronger than the other?
2016-10-02 12:27:44	Math520	It is confusing me, that's all.
2016-10-02 12:27:57	MotivicScones	for example, "there are at least five prime numbers" is certainly a theorem, even though we can also prove "there are infinitely many prime number"
2016-10-02 12:27:59	tom99	np, Well I have to get lunch now but hopefully you can find your solution laurus.

2016-10-02 12:28:33	Math520	So then, x_n < c is a contradiction to x_n >= c and also to x_n > c, right?
