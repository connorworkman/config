2016-10-17 14:10:35	kronos003	so I got the webmin module completely working. But I've realized it doesnt handle ipv6 or Firewalld. These are things I'll work on as I get time, but in the meantime I have a webmin module that sorta works (no firewall control or ipv6 routing baked in just yet.

2016-10-17 16:01:33	ScotchYip	!welcome
2016-10-17 16:01:35	@vpnHelper	"welcome" is (#1) Start by stating your !goal, such as 'I would like to access the internet over my vpn', or (#2) New to IRC? see the link in !ask, or (#3) We may need you to !paste your !logs and !configs and maybe !interface to help you, or (#4) See !howto for beginners, or (#5) See !route for lans behind openvpn, or (#6) !redirect for sending inet traffic through the server, or (#7) Also
2016-10-17 16:01:36	@vpnHelper	interesting: !man !/30 !topology !iporder !sample !forum !wiki !mitm, or (#8) Don't use 192.168.1.0/24 or 192.168.0.0/24 (too much potential for conflict), or (#9) And again, if you think you need !tap, you're probably wrong
2016-10-17 16:02:18	ScotchYip	!goal
2016-10-17 16:02:19	@vpnHelper	"goal" is Please clearly state your goal for your vpn: example, I would like to access the lan behind the server , I would like to access the internet over my vpn , I just want a secure connection between 2 computers , etc
2016-10-17 16:04:02	ScotchYip	Okay.  :)  I'll try to summarize my goal:  I'm running OpenVPN on OpenBSD 6 inside a VM, behind a pfsense firewall.  After 2 days, I got the server configured, client files fixed, and was able to connect through the iOS OpenVPN client over LTE to the server.
2016-10-17 16:05:51	ScotchYip	My VMs are all in the 10.0.3.x address space, and I've allocated 10.0.4.x for all VPN clients.  The snag seems to be that while I'm able to connect (iPhone on LTE -> static IP on firewall -> VM host -> OpenVPN) I can only ping 10.0.4.1 -- but nothing on the 10.0.3.x subnet.
2016-10-17 16:07:55	ScotchYip	I've added an IP alias (ifconfig em0 alias 10.0.4.2 255.255.255.0) and I'l also able to ping that.  I've configured the OS for port forwarding (net.inet.ip.forwarding=1) but packets don't seem to be able to traverse from 10.0.4.x to 10.0.3.x.
2016-10-17 16:08:34	ScotchYip	In this case, I shouldn't need a bridge, because I really only have one network device, with an aliased IP.  (I'm open to being corrected on this point though.)
2016-10-17 16:09:31	ScotchYip	I'm wondering if I need to alter my VM config to include a SECOND network adapter, assign THAT port to 10.0.4.x, and then build a bridge from there.
2016-10-17 16:11:07	ScotchYip	Or, if I can get away with fixing my subnet mask so that both 10.0.3.x and 10.0.4.x are grouped together...  Like, 255.255.254.0 or something similar.
2016-10-17 16:11:47	ScotchYip	I'm heading to bed for the night, I'll check back in tomorrow morning.
2016-10-17 16:11:58	ScotchYip	(Thanks in advance for reading!)
