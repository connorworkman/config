2016-10-17 16:01:35	@vpnHelper	"welcome" is (#1) Start by stating your !goal, such as 'I would like to access the internet over my vpn', or (#2) New to IRC? see the link in !ask, or (#3) We may need you to !paste your !logs and !configs and maybe !interface to help you, or (#4) See !howto for beginners, or (#5) See !route for lans behind openvpn, or (#6) !redirect for sending inet traffic through the server, or (#7) Also
2016-10-17 16:01:36	@vpnHelper	interesting: !man !/30 !topology !iporder !sample !forum !wiki !mitm, or (#8) Don't use 192.168.1.0/24 or 192.168.0.0/24 (too much potential for conflict), or (#9) And again, if you think you need !tap, you're probably wrong
2016-10-17 16:02:18	ScotchYip	!goal
2016-10-17 16:02:19	@vpnHelper	"goal" is Please clearly state your goal for your vpn: example, I would like to access the lan behind the server , I would like to access the internet over my vpn , I just want a secure connection between 2 computers , etc
2016-10-17 16:04:02	ScotchYip	Okay.  :)  I'll try to summarize my goal:  I'm running OpenVPN on OpenBSD 6 inside a VM, behind a pfsense firewall.  After 2 days, I got the server configured, client files fixed, and was able to connect through the iOS OpenVPN client over LTE to the server.
2016-10-17 16:05:51	ScotchYip	My VMs are all in the 10.0.3.x address space, and I've allocated 10.0.4.x for all VPN clients.  The snag seems to be that while I'm able to connect (iPhone on LTE -> static IP on firewall -> VM host -> OpenVPN) I can only ping 10.0.4.1 -- but nothing on the 10.0.3.x subnet.
2016-10-17 16:07:55	ScotchYip	I've added an IP alias (ifconfig em0 alias 10.0.4.2 255.255.255.0) and I'l also able to ping that.  I've configured the OS for port forwarding (net.inet.ip.forwarding=1) but packets don't seem to be able to traverse from 10.0.4.x to 10.0.3.x.
2016-10-17 16:08:34	ScotchYip	In this case, I shouldn't need a bridge, because I really only have one network device, with an aliased IP.  (I'm open to being corrected on this point though.)
2016-10-17 16:09:31	ScotchYip	I'm wondering if I need to alter my VM config to include a SECOND network adapter, assign THAT port to 10.0.4.x, and then build a bridge from there.
2016-10-17 16:11:07	ScotchYip	Or, if I can get away with fixing my subnet mask so that both 10.0.3.x and 10.0.4.x are grouped together...  Like, 255.255.254.0 or something similar.
2016-10-17 16:11:47	ScotchYip	I'm heading to bed for the night, I'll check back in tomorrow morning.

2016-10-17 21:03:37	@ecrist	[22:31:31] no idea [22:31:31]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@ecrist	[22:31:40] best to ask in !openvpn-as [22:31:40]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	kronos003	[00:10:35] so I got the webmin module completely working. But I've realized it doesnt handle ipv6 or Firewalld. These are things I'll work on as I get time, but in the meantime I have a webmin module that sorta works (no firewall control or ipv6 routing baked in just yet. [00:10:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@ecrist	[00:22:10] You wrote the module? [00:22:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@ecrist	[00:22:16] Webmin is still a thing? [00:22:16]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:01:33] !welcome [02:01:33]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@vpnHelper	[02:01:35] "welcome" is (#1) Start by stating your !goal, such as 'I would like to access the internet over my vpn', or (#2) New to IRC? see the link in !ask, or (#3) We may need you to !paste your !logs and !configs and maybe !interface to help you, or (#4) See !howto for beginners, or (#5) See !route for lans behind openvpn, or (#6) !redirect for sending inet traffic through the server, or (#7) Also [02:01:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@vpnHelper	[02:01:36] interesting: !man !/30 !topology !iporder !sample !forum !wiki !mitm, or (#8) Don't use 192.168.1.0/24 or 192.168.0.0/24 (too much potential for conflict), or (#9) And again, if you think you need !tap, you're probably wrong [02:01:36]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:02:18] !goal [02:02:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@vpnHelper	[02:02:19] "goal" is Please clearly state your goal for your vpn: example, I would like to access the lan behind the server , I would like to access the internet over my vpn , I just want a secure connection between 2 computers , etc [02:02:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:04:02] Okay.  :)  I'll try to summarize my goal:  I'm running OpenVPN on OpenBSD 6 inside a VM, behind a pfsense firewall.  After 2 days, I got the server configured, client files fixed, and was able to connect through the iOS OpenVPN client over LTE to the server. [02:04:02]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:05:51] My VMs are all in the 10.0.3.x address space, and I've allocated 10.0.4.x for all VPN clients.  The snag seems to be that while I'm able to connect (iPhone on LTE -> static IP on firewall -> VM host -> OpenVPN) I can only ping 10.0.4.1 -- but nothing on the 10.0.3.x subnet. [02:05:51]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:07:55] I've added an IP alias (ifconfig em0 alias 10.0.4.2 255.255.255.0) and I'l also able to ping that.  I've configured the OS for port forwarding (net.inet.ip.forwarding=1) but packets don't seem to be able to traverse from 10.0.4.x to 10.0.3.x. [02:07:55]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:08:34] In this case, I shouldn't need a bridge, because I really only have one network device, with an aliased IP.  (I'm open to being corrected on this point though.) [02:08:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:09:31] I'm wondering if I need to alter my VM config to include a SECOND network adapter, assign THAT port to 10.0.4.x, and then build a bridge from there. [02:09:31]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:11:07] Or, if I can get away with fixing my subnet mask so that both 10.0.3.x and 10.0.4.x are grouped together...  Like, 255.255.254.0 or something similar. [02:11:07]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:11:47] I'm heading to bed for the night, I'll check back in tomorrow morning. [02:11:47]

2016-10-18 02:19:54	ScotchYip	Please be aware that the OpenVPN Connect app on iOS doesn't support the "HMAC Firewall", so if you try to follow the instructions to create and use "ta.key", you'll never be able to successfully authenticate.
2016-10-18 02:20:08	@ecrist	Or, you may contact OpenVPN Technologies - they might be able to work out a licensing arrangement.

2016-10-18 02:30:39	ScotchYip	ecrist:  I'm having trouble finding the article, but it said that HMAC on iOS wasn't supported (although it didn't really give a reason).  When I removed all of the tls parameters (tls-server/tls-auth/etc.) it suddenly worked perfectly.
2016-10-18 02:31:08	@ecrist	well, that just demonstrates you had configuration issues
2016-10-18 02:31:32	@ecrist	it doesn't demonstrate or back up that HMAC isn't supported, despite how flippant your response was
2016-10-18 02:31:38	ScotchYip	ecrist:  Although, I see an article that says it wasn't supported before 1.0.5, so it was true at one point.
2016-10-18 02:31:53	@ecrist	even that's not true
2016-10-18 02:32:06	@ecrist	the FAQ points out a change in how key direction was modified between 1.0 and 1.1
2016-10-18 02:32:25	ScotchYip	 TLS-Remote is not supported in the app version (1.0.0).
2016-10-18 02:32:25	ScotchYip	With app version 1.0.5 TLS works.
2016-10-18 02:32:27	@ecrist	sorry, 1.0.0 and 1.0.1

2016-10-18 02:36:41	@vpnHelper	Joo got it.
2016-10-18 02:36:43	ScotchYip	I also see that they've changed the 'key-direction' as well.  And that's not set in my config files, so I'll add that to my instructions.
2016-10-18 02:37:32	ScotchYip	Does key-direction need to be on both client and server?
2016-10-18 02:37:35	@ecrist	I mentioned that, above.  And cited that as evidence there was HMAC support in 1.0.0
2016-10-18 02:37:50	@ecrist	yes - see the man page about the usage
2016-10-18 02:37:53	ScotchYip	Yup.  Understood...
2016-10-18 02:37:57	@ecrist	each end needs to be opposite
2016-10-18 02:38:05	@ecrist	so, if the clients use 1, the server uses 0
2016-10-18 02:38:08	@ecrist	or vice-versa
2016-10-18 02:38:09	ScotchYip	Yeah, I did that.
2016-10-18 02:38:35	ScotchYip	But it sounds like 'bidirectional' is the appropriate/preferred option.
2016-10-18 02:39:16	SviMik	plaisthos I will ask programmers what exactly they did, and if some license requires publishing the source code - I'll ask them to do so. right now even we don't have the code (we have ordered the app from another company, and not 100% sure what they used)

2016-10-18 02:39:30	honigkuchen	acrist paisthos if I use another vpn configuration that let all traffic of the client run through the vpn server, then I can access all tun IPs of the server, but not if I use a vpn server that does that not
2016-10-18 02:39:53	@ecrist	bidirectional isn't a valid argument in the openvpn server/client
2016-10-18 02:40:45	@ecrist	honigkuchen: then you service needs to listen to a routed IP
2016-10-18 02:41:26	SviMik	plaisthos from what I can see in apk, there is libopenvpn.so, libopvpnutil.so, libcrypto.so, libssl.so. -- I'm 99% sure they took something open-source, and not even touched it...

2016-10-18 03:00:35	SviMik	plaisthos ok, I will ask the programmers to check the license and publish the source code if it is required. can we *completely* close the Android question now, cause it is REALLY hard to me to track two discussions at same time?

2016-10-18 03:01:01	SviMik	^_^
2016-10-18 03:01:26	@plaisthos	or buy a license to keep the UI part closed sourced
2016-10-18 03:05:51	SviMik	so the vpn api in ios is not closed, and appstore will allow to publish such app if we write the vpn thing from scratch?
2016-10-18 03:06:42	@ecrist	sounds like it, yeah
2016-10-18 03:08:32	SviMik	but we can use GPL code like ics as well if we publish the app code later?

2016-10-18 03:26:42	ScotchYip	Okay.  The problem with the HMAC authentication was two-fold...
2016-10-18 03:27:17	ScotchYip	1)  I was using a unified file, and I was missing the 'key-direction' parameter before the <tls-auth> section.
2016-10-18 03:27:58	ScotchYip	2)  The example I saw on setting the auth option inside the configuration file had the HMAC wrapped in single quotes.
2016-10-18 03:28:30	ScotchYip	(So the client was saying 'SHA256' isn't supported...  And I thought the quotes were from the error message, but they were in the config file.)

2016-10-18 03:44:24	ScotchYip	Here's my network architecture:
2016-10-18 03:47:11	@ecrist	it looks bleak
2016-10-18 03:47:40	ScotchYip	I'm running OpenVPN on OpenBSD 6 inside a VM, behind a pfsense firewall. My VMs are all in the 10.0.3.x address space, and I've allocated 10.0.4.x for all VPN clients.  Can get away with fixing my subnet mask so that both 10.0.3.x and 10.0.4.x are grouped together...  Like, 255.255.254.0 or something similar, and skip the explicit routing altogether?
2016-10-18 03:48:15	@ecrist	now, that's just lazy
2016-10-18 03:48:32	@ecrist	no, you shouldn't do that
2016-10-18 03:48:37	SviMik	skip the routing \\ use tap :D
2016-10-18 03:48:41	ScotchYip	All of the VMs on the 10.0.3.x space are perfectly fine to be exposed to VPN users (in fact, it's preferable in most cases).
2016-10-18 03:48:43	@ecrist	since there is a distinct router for the 10.0.4.0/24 subnet

2016-10-18 03:51:05	@ecrist	shortcuts you take today in setting up your vpn will just cause problems later.
2016-10-18 03:51:19	ScotchYip	Back before auto-rejoin, so you had to type the command to join the channel again.  It was like an actual punishment.  ;)
2016-10-18 03:51:21	@ecrist	SviMik: too many people use it for the wrong reasons.
2016-10-18 03:52:06	ScotchYip	So is making a big subnet somewhere between t*p and routing in terms of lazyness?
2016-10-18 03:53:21	ScotchYip	Hrm.  Although, I'm thinking...  The risk is extraordinarily small, but someone could have their phone stolen, and that might provide unrestricted access to my other VMs.

2016-10-18 03:54:03	ScotchYip	Which isn't truly an issue, since each VM is pretty much locked down.
2016-10-18 03:54:11	SviMik	the t*p is L2, which has such problems as arp spoofing, multicast flood, etc
2016-10-18 03:55:18	SviMik	sure, all the problems can be solved if you know how and what to filter

2016-10-18 03:58:12	ScotchYip	Oh, I know quite a bit about TCP/IP...  It's the firewalls that I'm not super familiar with.  I've been lucky/spoiled by the fact that it's usually someone else's problem.  ;)

2016-10-18 05:13:55	@vpnHelper	interesting: !man !/30 !topology !iporder !sample !forum !wiki !mitm, or (#8) Don't use 192.168.1.0/24 or 192.168.0.0/24 (too much potential for conflict), or (#9) And again, if you think you need !tap, you're probably wrong

2016-10-18 05:33:39	rob0	um, in some cases NAT is necessary: to provide access for RFC 1918 networks to the Internet
2016-10-18 05:33:51	rob0	maybe you are thinking of:
2016-10-18 05:33:54	rob0	!nathack
2016-10-18 05:33:55	@vpnHelper	"nathack" is see https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/NatHack for info on how to solve the problem when you need !route_outside_ovpn but cant add a route to the gateway or the lan machines
2016-10-18 05:35:19	rob0	Generally if you are setting up a complex VPN, you should spend the small amount of money required to replace cheap routers with better ones.
2016-10-18 05:36:25	wallbroken	thank rob0
2016-10-18 05:36:40	wallbroken	the problem is in some complex architecture, you have many gateways
2016-10-18 05:37:06	wallbroken	so using routing, you need to go packets loop over the network
2016-10-18 05:37:11	wallbroken	generating many traffic

2016-10-18 13:26:50	fearnothing	the verbosity thing was because I was reading stackoverflow :P bad idea all around.
2016-10-18 13:27:42	fearnothing	turns out I am getting the auth failed messages but because of the method I'm using to view the syslog output, the messages weren't visible immediately (syslog -> logstash -> elasticsearch)

2016-10-18 23:55:24	rob0	[15:33:39] um, in some cases NAT is necessary: to provide access for RFC 1918 networks to the Internet [15:33:39]

2016-10-18 23:55:24	@vpnHelper	[15:33:55] "nathack" is see https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/NatHack for info on how to solve the problem when you need !route_outside_ovpn but cant add a route to the gateway or the lan machines [15:33:55]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	rob0	[15:35:19] Generally if you are setting up a complex VPN, you should spend the small amount of money required to replace cheap routers with better ones. [15:35:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	wallbroken	[15:36:25] thank rob0 [15:36:25]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	wallbroken	[15:36:40] the problem is in some complex architecture, you have many gateways [15:36:40]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	wallbroken	[15:37:06] so using routing, you need to go packets loop over the network [15:37:06]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	wallbroken	[15:37:11] generating many traffic [15:37:11]

2016-10-18 23:55:24	fearnothing	[21:13:59] would it be normal for openvpn syslog output to include failed auth attempts? [21:13:59]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	fearnothing	[21:21:44] hmm, I'm seeing that I would have to set verbosity on server to 6 or higher [21:21:44]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	fearnothing	[21:22:02] is that the only way? [21:22:02]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	@dazo	[21:46:32] fearnothing: sounds odd ... what kind of authentication do you mean?  certificate or username/password? [21:46:32]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	fearnothing	[23:26:25] dazo - sorry I didn't see your reply, I've actually got the answer [23:26:25]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	fearnothing	[23:26:50] the verbosity thing was because I was reading stackoverflow :P bad idea all around. [23:26:50]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	fearnothing	[23:27:42] turns out I am getting the auth failed messages but because of the method I'm using to view the syslog output, the messages weren't visible immediately (syslog -> logstash -> elasticsearch) [23:27:42]

2016-10-18 23:55:24	rob0	[02:55:11] The real problem, I bet, is something about routing or MTU.  Has nothing to do with stunnel and only tangentially with openvpn. [02:55:11]

I can connect to it just fine as I reused the configs I used some time ago but the the problem is, when I am connected to it, the device cant load any website, and the linux box's webserver no longer responds. firewalld is enabled, openvpn port is open, net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1 is added to

2016-10-19 00:41:27	wallbroken	[15:30:45] operators... [15:30:45]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	wallbroken	[15:30:56] where to get the article speaking why NAT is an HACK? [15:30:56]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	rob0	[15:33:39] um, in some cases NAT is necessary: to provide access for RFC 1918 networks to the Internet [15:33:39]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	rob0	[15:33:51] maybe you are thinking of: [15:33:51]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	rob0	[15:33:54] !nathack [15:33:54]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	@vpnHelper	[15:33:55] "nathack" is see https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/NatHack for info on how to solve the problem when you need !route_outside_ovpn but cant add a route to the gateway or the lan machines [15:33:55]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	rob0	[15:35:19] Generally if you are setting up a complex VPN, you should spend the small amount of money required to replace cheap routers with better ones. [15:35:19]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	wallbroken	[15:36:25] thank rob0 [15:36:25]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	wallbroken	[15:36:40] the problem is in some complex architecture, you have many gateways [15:36:40]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	wallbroken	[15:37:06] so using routing, you need to go packets loop over the network [15:37:06]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	wallbroken	[15:37:11] generating many traffic [15:37:11]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	fearnothing	[21:13:21] hi [21:13:21]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	fearnothing	[21:13:59] would it be normal for openvpn syslog output to include failed auth attempts? [21:13:59]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	fearnothing	[21:21:44] hmm, I'm seeing that I would have to set verbosity on server to 6 or higher [21:21:44]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	fearnothing	[21:22:02] is that the only way? [21:22:02]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	@dazo	[21:46:32] fearnothing: sounds odd ... what kind of authentication do you mean?  certificate or username/password? [21:46:32]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	fearnothing	[23:26:25] dazo - sorry I didn't see your reply, I've actually got the answer [23:26:25]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	fearnothing	[23:26:50] the verbosity thing was because I was reading stackoverflow :P bad idea all around. [23:26:50]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	fearnothing	[23:27:42] turns out I am getting the auth failed messages but because of the method I'm using to view the syslog output, the messages weren't visible immediately (syslog -> logstash -> elasticsearch) [23:27:42]

2016-10-19 00:41:27	rob0	[02:55:11] The real problem, I bet, is something about routing or MTU.  Has nothing to do with stunnel and only tangentially with openvpn. [02:55:11]

2016-10-19 00:41:27	law	[07:59:57] hey all, I would like to be able to access my AWS VPC networks from an OpenVPN EC2 VM sitting on the VPC edge.  I've read the FAQ, I've enabled ip forwarding on the kernel, I've disabled source/dst check on the OpenVPN EC2 instance [07:59:57]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	law	[08:00:09] I've verified that iptables is NOT filtering the tun interface [08:00:09]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	law	[08:01:15] my clients can connect to the OpenVPN instance just fine, can ping the OpenVPN box without incident.  However, anything 'behind' OpenVPN is not accessible, even though I'm pushing a route via the server config to all my clients.  Running 'tcpdump' on the openvpn server while I initiate traffic from a client to an AWS VPC VM, I see the traffic crossing the OpenVPN host but I'm not seeing anything return [08:01:15]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	law	[08:01:23] this is for ICMP as well as TCP (port 22 check, etc) [08:01:23]
2016-10-19 00:41:28	law	[08:03:56] on the target host (AWS VPC VM) I see the traffic hitting and the return, but it doesn't seem to be coming back to the OpenVPN host [08:03:56]
2016-10-19 00:41:28	law	[08:23:56] here we go, had to add 'iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.254.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE' [08:23:56]

2016-10-19 03:59:50	@danhunsaker	Other VPN technologies use things other than TLS, so they don't work on devices that don't support them.
2016-10-19 04:00:10	@danhunsaker	OpenVPN is just a TLS connection to a remote server.

2016-10-19 04:01:13	@danhunsaker	They may block a few known OpenVPN services, but beyond that, they really can't block OpenVPN itself overall, without also blocking a large number of other, non-VPN services.
2016-10-19 04:02:02	niamor	They defiantly block l2tp/ipsec over their mifi devices
2016-10-19 04:02:28	niamor	I'm trying to determine if they also block tls as well over the same

2016-10-19 04:07:10	@danhunsaker	Nah, L2TP and IPSEC operate on a lower layer than TLS.  Their devices don't support it; it's not actively blocked, just not implemented.
2016-10-19 04:09:08	niamor	Ok...so a tls implementation should work through their devices?
2016-10-19 04:09:30	mongrelion	Hello! Has anybody got any experience setting up an OpenVPN server instance load balanced by HAProxy? Connecting the (openvpn) client directly to the (openvpn) server works like a charm, but as soon as I make it pass through haproxy it poops out.
2016-10-19 04:09:39	@danhunsaker	niamor: Absolutely.
2016-10-19 04:10:05	rob0	I suspect your Verizon issues have been routing issues, not blocking.
2016-10-19 04:10:35	rob0	oh, AAMOF I did use openvpn via Verizon quite a lot.
2016-10-19 04:11:05	rob0	wasn't a mifi, but very similar sort of device.
2016-10-19 04:11:12	niamor	@rob0 i can vpn from wired non-verizon (and non tmobile as well) clients
2016-10-19 04:11:29	rob0	not TO a mifi, no
2016-10-19 04:11:48	rob0	AFAIK it has no way to do DNAT for inbound connections
2016-10-19 04:11:56	@danhunsaker	rob0: As I understand it, they haven't tried OpenVPN on it yet, but rather IPSEC/L2TP.
2016-10-19 04:12:04	rob0	(at least my device does not have that capability)
2016-10-19 04:12:55	@danhunsaker	Which would easily have problems on devices as simplified as a MiFi,

2016-10-19 04:18:44	bendikz	Can I use http-proxy to tunnel TCP ports to UDP OpenVPN? Sitting behind a firewall.
2016-10-19 04:18:51	rob0	slightly less performant vs. having crypto code in the kernel, but you won't notice it
2016-10-19 04:19:26	rob0	bendikz, if openvpn is on UDP it won't listen on TCP
2016-10-19 04:19:53	niamor	@rob0...thank you
2016-10-19 04:20:02	bendikz	rob0: What would be a better solution? Problem is that only a few common TCP ports are blocked.
2016-10-19 04:20:08	@danhunsaker	bendikz: No, it doesn't speak HTTP, so an HTTP proxy wouldn't work.  You can have your OpenVPN server listen on TCP directly, though.

2016-10-19 05:32:45	@dazo	skyroveRR: firewalld is actually a nice approach towards a dynamic firewall (using iptables directly is a static firewall) ... so the firewall rules can change dynamically, based on events on the system
2016-10-19 05:34:28	@dazo	Votan: I have to admit though that firewalld isn't really mature for larger multi-interface policies (which a firewall/gateway role depends on) ... I've discussed that with Thomas Woerner (lead developer) and provided him with a lot of input how to improve the situation
2016-10-19 05:34:46	rob0	Anyway, again, OUTPUT is not the proper chain to use, full stop.

2016-10-19 05:36:47	rob0	firewalld is an iptables frontend, so iptables concepts do apply
2016-10-19 05:37:15	Votan	dazo, here is my initial post with my problem:
2016-10-19 05:37:33	Votan	I've set up openvpn on my linux box (fully patched CentOs 7) and plan on using it as a gateway for my phone/laptop when surfing in public WiFis. I can connect to it just fine as I reused the configs I used some time ago but the the problem is, when I am connected to it, the device cant load any website, and the linux box's webserver no longer responds. firewalld is enabled, openvpn port is open, net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1 is added to
2016-10-19 05:37:33	Votan	/usr/lib/sysctl.d/50-default.conf and I have added masquarding through /etc/firewalld/direct.xml (content: http://pastebin.com/ZQTYzsZR)
2016-10-19 05:38:54	@dazo	Votan: alright, can you provide the output of iptables-save too?
2016-10-19 05:38:57	rob0	I guess I am ignored.
2016-10-19 05:39:17	@dazo	:]
2016-10-19 05:39:46	Votan	dazo sure, here you go: http://pastebin.com/zd9Sm04R
2016-10-19 05:40:08	Votan	rob0 no you are not, I am reading your link in parallel, although this direct rule I did recycle from the old machine
2016-10-19 05:40:13	Votan	where it did do the trick and worked
2016-10-19 05:40:33	Votan	somehow I seem to be missing a tiny part that I did on the old machine, that I did not do here that keeps it all together and I cant seem to figure it out
2016-10-19 05:40:35	@dazo	Votan: OUTPUT rules are really not the place to modify things to allow traffic passing between interfaces
2016-10-19 05:41:06	@dazo	OUTPUT (and INPUT) only covers the host itself .... FORWARD is for traffic passing the host
2016-10-19 05:41:06		[05:41]

2016-10-19 05:42:17	Votan	unfortunately I have to admit that my knowledge about iptables/firewalld is rather limited so I recycled all I had due to lack of understanding :/
2016-10-19 05:42:26	@dazo	(openvpn need to be running when doing that)
2016-10-19 05:42:46	Votan	eth0 in DMZ

2016-10-19 05:45:12	@dazo	can you provide the openvpn server config as well?
2016-10-19 05:45:14	Votan	aha! I have one more info, this gives on the old server when checking active zones:

2016-10-19 05:45:43	@dazo	right ... so there's one clue ... but I'm not sure it's enough .... but you can try to add that
2016-10-19 05:46:03	@dazo	firewall-cmd --zone trusted --add-interface tun+
2016-10-19 05:46:13	Votan	why tun+ ?
2016-10-19 05:47:04	@dazo	that should give all tun0..tun9 ... but on a second thought, I'm not sure if firewalld understands that properly
2016-10-19 05:49:23	Votan	well... believe it or not, this did the trick
2016-10-19 05:49:32	Votan	phone connects, other services remain operational and traffic is forwarded
2016-10-19 05:49:38	Votan	ip on the phone show up as ther servers etc
2016-10-19 05:50:09	Votan	Now, problem is solved, but you dazo and rob0 seem to be convinced my direct rule is bad. How can I improve this then?
2016-10-19 05:50:28	@dazo	Votan: please do a new iptables-save ... just so I can verify that nothing broke in other ways ... like opening up too much
2016-10-19 05:50:47	@dazo	Votan: just remove that <rule/> tag

2016-10-19 06:11:53	@danhunsaker	Well, you'd obviously need to adjust your FTP protocol to handle lost packets, since UDP won't do it for you like TCP will.

2016-10-19 06:17:37	@dazo	Votan: you could consider to move btsync and those other ports to a separate zone, and then use 'firewall-cmd --zone myzone --add-source=x.x.x.x/yy' ... this way you can restrict which nets can access these services
2016-10-19 06:18:10	@danhunsaker	SMTP, POP3S, and FTP are probably open by default.
2016-10-19 06:19:04	@dazo	I've blocked 993+587 from everywhere except the IP ranges my ISPs (including mobile phone nets) assigns to me .... this way I get all the needed access, and I avoid a lot of port scanning and related issues

2016-10-19 06:20:31	Votan	especially, since when I am outside or have to use another computer but want to check my mails, i use rainloop which runs locally on that machine
2016-10-19 06:20:43	@dazo	Votan: I mean, I've even managed to make my fairly non-tech wife kick off VPNs when she can't access mail when being on the road
2016-10-19 06:20:45	@danhunsaker	And of course the SSL variants are superior to the unencrypted versions.
2016-10-19 06:21:32	@dazo	danhunsaker: POP3 (110/tcp) and IMAP (143/tcp) may support STARTTLS ;-)
2016-10-19 06:21:57	@danhunsaker	Mine do.  Only reason I have them open in the first place.
2016-10-19 06:22:07	@dazo	danhunsaker: 587/tcp is basically 25/tcp which should require authentication .... which also use STARTTLS for encryption
2016-10-19 06:22:20	@danhunsaker	Indeed so.
2016-10-19 06:22:28	@dazo	clue is to have it configured so that STARTTLS is enforced before any client provides any credentials
2016-10-19 06:22:51	@danhunsaker	It's been a while, but I did set up the mail server myself, so I understand the moving parts involved.

2016-10-19 06:23:38	rob0	imap can do anything pop3 can do, plus a whole lot more, and usually a whole lot better!  Pop3 should have died out long ago, but it lives on in clueless HOWTOs and the minds of those who know very little about mail.

2016-10-19 06:38:30	@danhunsaker	I'd also look into setting up DMARC.
2016-10-19 06:39:14	@danhunsaker	Google tends to treat DMARC-compliant sources much more kindly.
2016-10-19 06:39:34	@dazo	I'm quite divided by the benefit of DMARC .... especially when considering mailing lists .... most mailing lists doesn't do SRS :/
2016-10-19 06:39:43	Votan	how do I set up a PTR record for IPv6? My Hoster only gives me the revers DNS possibility for IPv4, and there it is set
2016-10-19 06:39:44	@danhunsaker	(Which I really wish was true of MS...)
2016-10-19 06:40:28	@danhunsaker	Votan: Depends on where your v6 address comes from.
2016-10-19 06:40:29	@dazo	Votan: you need to contact the instance providing you with the IPv6 address .... for my VPS boxes, that's been the VPS provider
2016-10-19 06:40:45	Votan	ah I see
2016-10-19 06:40:50	Votan	I'll do that and then google DMARC
2016-10-19 06:41:21	@danhunsaker	dazo: Mailing lists can certainly be a pain with DMARC.
2016-10-19 06:42:18	@danhunsaker	There are best practice approaches to work with them cleanly, but as you said, not all ML providers play nice.
2016-10-19 06:43:23	@danhunsaker	Part of the reason to implement DMARC as widely as possible, IMO.  Drive home the importance of supporting it to those providing ML and similar services.
2016-10-19 06:46:59	BtbN	I don't have enough IPs to implement DMARC for all my domains.
2016-10-19 06:46:59		[06:46]
2016-10-19 06:48:02	@danhunsaker	BtbN: ?  DMARC isn't IP based?
2016-10-19 06:48:27	BtbN	It requires the reverse lookup to match
2016-10-19 06:48:40	@danhunsaker	Not in my experience.
2016-10-19 06:49:00	@danhunsaker	It's why SPF is involved.
2016-10-19 06:49:24	@danhunsaker	I have one IP for all my domains.
2016-10-19 06:49:39	Votan	gm, dkim seems easier to implement then dmark from what I see
2016-10-19 06:49:46	@dazo	BtbN: DMARC records are found on _dmarc.$TLD
2016-10-19 06:49:47	SCHAAP137	i'd do all 3
2016-10-19 06:49:54	SCHAAP137	SPF first, then DKIM, then DMARC
2016-10-19 06:49:55	@dazo	(TXT records)
2016-10-19 06:50:00	Votan	well SPF I already have for all domains
2016-10-19 06:50:07	@dazo	DMARC needs SPF+DKIM, IIRC
2016-10-19 06:50:09	Votan	so now I move to DKIM
2016-10-19 06:50:19	SCHAAP137	think so too dazo
2016-10-19 06:50:20	BtbN	dazo, yes, but it requires that the domain in the From: header matches with the one in DKIM, which implicitly requires one IP per domain
2016-10-19 06:50:22	@dazo	DKIM is fairly trivial to configure

2016-10-19 06:53:18	@danhunsaker	Also, you can activate DMARC without DKIM, and collect data on who is sending stuff under your domain name without your knowledge before setting up message signing.
2016-10-19 06:54:24	@danhunsaker	DMARC supports flagging DKIM (and/or SPF) as unimplemented for that exact reason.

2016-10-19 16:16:23	@vpnHelper	less likely are issues with bad TCP window scaling or the sliding window; generally, don't 2nd guess TCP (in openvpn or your OS knobs)
2016-10-19 16:16:51	@danhunsaker	!tcp
2016-10-19 16:16:52	@vpnHelper	"tcp" is (#1) Sometimes you cannot avoid tunneling over tcp, but if you can avoid it, DO. http://sites.inka.de/~bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html Why TCP Over TCP Is A Bad Idea., or (#2) http://www.openvpn.net/papers/BLUG-talk/14.html for a presentation by James Yonan (OpenVPN lead developer), or (#3) if you must use tcp, you likely want --tcp-nodelay
2016-10-19 16:17:34	badloop	danhunsaker: fair enough... this was more of a last resort.  any good solutions for reverse proxying udp traffic?
2016-10-19 16:17:56	@danhunsaker	!goal
2016-10-19 16:17:58	@vpnHelper	"goal" is Please clearly state your goal for your vpn: example, I would like to access the lan behind the server , I would like to access the internet over my vpn , I just want a secure connection between 2 computers , etc
2016-10-19 16:19:26	badloop	i want to run my openvpn in a VM behind my firewall, but i dont want to completely sacrifice the ports necessary for running openvpn, so I have a reverse proxy set up to forward the https traffic to my openvpn server
2016-10-19 16:19:36	badloop	i'd like a similar solution for the udp traffic to the server
2016-10-19 16:19:57	badloop	although i suppose i could just configure the port to be natted through my firewall directly to the openvpn server
2016-10-19 16:25:00		[16:19]
2016-10-19 16:26:55	@danhunsaker	That tends to be the preferred configuration, yes - port forwarding.
2016-10-19 16:27:12	@danhunsaker	Which is why OpenVPN UDP has a predefined port.
2016-10-19 16:27:25	@danhunsaker	That isn't used by anything else, by default.
2016-10-19 16:29:26	badloop	yeah, its just not quite as elegant as proxying it via the dns name, but it works, so i'll just deal with it.  ;-)
2016-10-19 16:29:32	badloop	thanks for the help
2016-10-19 16:30:45	@danhunsaker	It's ... not exactly supported to do name-based proxying of a VPN ...
2016-10-19 16:31:23	@danhunsaker	Not even sure where you'd get the name to do the proxying with in the first place...  Especially with UDP, being stateless as it is.
2016-10-19 16:32:21	badloop	well really all thats required is being able to proxy the udp packets based on the dns name.... same as tcp... udp just isn't as easy to deal with as udp stream.  nginx supports it in their pro version, so hopefully it will come to the free version in early 2017

2016-10-19 16:33:07	@danhunsaker	Right, but where does the load balancer even get the DNS name from?
2016-10-19 16:36:19	badloop	from the client?
2016-10-19 16:37:15	badloop	example, i have web.host.com and vpn.host.com, both can connect to my firewall via port 80 .. my load balancer/proxy understands the dns name and can send the traffic to the correct server based on that name

2016-10-19 16:38:02	@danhunsaker	And when does the client send that information, over the encrypted link, in a way that an HTTPS load balancer could understand it and forward the request to a non-HTTP backend?

2016-10-19 16:40:30	@danhunsaker	If the backend is responsible for providing its own certs, then the proxy just uses SNI to forward the request, still encrypted, to the correct backend server.
2016-10-19 16:40:41	@danhunsaker	It doesn't have to, of course.
2016-10-19 16:42:27	@danhunsaker	Theoretically, SNI could be used for VPN connections as well, but VPNs aren't generally tied to specific hostnames, as they generally aren't provided from shared servers, and even when they are, ports are specified manually either way, so changing ports is far simpler.  The VPN doesn't typically have any reason to care what hostname led a user to it.
2016-10-19 16:42:50	@danhunsaker	So VPN clients don't actually send the SNI info in the first place.
2016-10-19 16:44:43	@danhunsaker	To be clear, you do have a valid use case.  But.  Since you have to provide a configuration file for clients to connect anyway, it's generally preferred to put such customizations there or in a server-side client configuration directory (CCD).

2016-10-19 20:40:05	monsterco	[22:34:10] so many clients using shared keys can NOT simultaneously ping each other? [22:34:10]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	Eugene	[22:34:12] You probably actually want to do TLS mode without doing client-certs... eg password or some other auth mechanism [22:34:12]

2016-10-19 20:40:05	@vpnHelper	[02:16:23] less likely are issues with bad TCP window scaling or the sliding window; generally, don't 2nd guess TCP (in openvpn or your OS knobs) [02:16:23]

2016-10-19 20:40:05	badloop	[02:17:34] danhunsaker: fair enough... this was more of a last resort.  any good solutions for reverse proxying udp traffic? [02:17:34]

2016-10-19 20:40:05	@vpnHelper	[02:17:58] "goal" is Please clearly state your goal for your vpn: example, I would like to access the lan behind the server , I would like to access the internet over my vpn , I just want a secure connection between 2 computers , etc [02:17:58]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	badloop	[02:19:26] i want to run my openvpn in a VM behind my firewall, but i dont want to completely sacrifice the ports necessary for running openvpn, so I have a reverse proxy set up to forward the https traffic to my openvpn server [02:19:26]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	badloop	[02:19:36] i'd like a similar solution for the udp traffic to the server [02:19:36]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	badloop	[02:19:57] although i suppose i could just configure the port to be natted through my firewall directly to the openvpn server [02:19:57]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	@danhunsaker	[02:26:55] That tends to be the preferred configuration, yes - port forwarding. [02:26:55]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	@danhunsaker	[02:27:12] Which is why OpenVPN UDP has a predefined port. [02:27:12]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	@danhunsaker	[02:27:25] That isn't used by anything else, by default. [02:27:25]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	badloop	[02:29:26] yeah, its just not quite as elegant as proxying it via the dns name, but it works, so i'll just deal with it.  ;-) [02:29:26]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	badloop	[02:29:32] thanks for the help [02:29:32]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	@danhunsaker	[02:30:45] It's ... not exactly supported to do name-based proxying of a VPN ... [02:30:45]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	@danhunsaker	[02:31:23] Not even sure where you'd get the name to do the proxying with in the first place...  Especially with UDP, being stateless as it is. [02:31:23]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	badloop	[02:32:21] well really all thats required is being able to proxy the udp packets based on the dns name.... same as tcp... udp just isn't as easy to deal with as udp stream.  nginx supports it in their pro version, so hopefully it will come to the free version in early 2017 [02:32:21]

2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:17:34] danhunsaker: fair enough... this was more of a last resort.  any good solutions for reverse proxying udp traffic? [02:17:34]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:17:56] !goal [02:17:56]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@vpnHelper	[02:17:58] "goal" is Please clearly state your goal for your vpn: example, I would like to access the lan behind the server , I would like to access the internet over my vpn , I just want a secure connection between 2 computers , etc [02:17:58]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:19:26] i want to run my openvpn in a VM behind my firewall, but i dont want to completely sacrifice the ports necessary for running openvpn, so I have a reverse proxy set up to forward the https traffic to my openvpn server [02:19:26]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:19:36] i'd like a similar solution for the udp traffic to the server [02:19:36]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:19:57] although i suppose i could just configure the port to be natted through my firewall directly to the openvpn server [02:19:57]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:26:55] That tends to be the preferred configuration, yes - port forwarding. [02:26:55]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:27:12] Which is why OpenVPN UDP has a predefined port. [02:27:12]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:27:25] That isn't used by anything else, by default. [02:27:25]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:29:26] yeah, its just not quite as elegant as proxying it via the dns name, but it works, so i'll just deal with it.  ;-) [02:29:26]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:29:32] thanks for the help [02:29:32]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:30:45] It's ... not exactly supported to do name-based proxying of a VPN ... [02:30:45]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:31:23] Not even sure where you'd get the name to do the proxying with in the first place...  Especially with UDP, being stateless as it is. [02:31:23]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:32:21] well really all thats required is being able to proxy the udp packets based on the dns name.... same as tcp... udp just isn't as easy to deal with as udp stream.  nginx supports it in their pro version, so hopefully it will come to the free version in early 2017 [02:32:21]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:32:32] https://www.nginx.com/blog/announcing-udp-load-balancing/ [02:32:32]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:32:47] wow brain fart, i meant to say that a udp stream isn't as easy to deal with as a TCP stream [02:32:47]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:33:07] Right, but where does the load balancer even get the DNS name from? [02:33:07]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:36:19] from the client? [02:36:19]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:37:15] example, i have web.host.com and vpn.host.com, both can connect to my firewall via port 80 .. my load balancer/proxy understands the dns name and can send the traffic to the correct server based on that name [02:37:15]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:37:48] a great example of why this is needed is if i had multiple vlans that i wanted to offer separate vpns for [02:37:48]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:38:02] And when does the client send that information, over the encrypted link, in a way that an HTTPS load balancer could understand it and forward the request to a non-HTTP backend? [02:38:02]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:38:37] the secure communication from the client is with the proxy, not the backend [02:38:37]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:38:47] Not in the case of a VPN. [02:38:47]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:39:00] fair point [02:39:00]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:39:14] And in fact, not in the case of most HTTPS proxies, either. [02:39:14]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:39:37] s/most/some/ [02:39:37]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:40:30] If the backend is responsible for providing its own certs, then the proxy just uses SNI to forward the request, still encrypted, to the correct backend server. [02:40:30]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:40:41] It doesn't have to, of course. [02:40:41]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:42:27] Theoretically, SNI could be used for VPN connections as well, but VPNs aren't generally tied to specific hostnames, as they generally aren't provided from shared servers, and even when they are, ports are specified manually either way, so changing ports is far simpler.  The VPN doesn't typically have any reason to care what hostname led a user to it. [02:42:27]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:42:50] So VPN clients don't actually send the SNI info in the first place. [02:42:50]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:44:43] To be clear, you do have a valid use case.  But.  Since you have to provide a configuration file for clients to connect anyway, it's generally preferred to put such customizations there or in a server-side client configuration directory (CCD). [02:44:43]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:52:09] fair enough [02:52:09]

2016-10-20 00:37:03	@dazo	seoner: the explicit-exit-notify feature ... or the ignoring?
2016-10-20 00:37:28	seoner	dazo: both?
2016-10-20 00:38:51	@dazo	explicit-exit-notify is used with the UDP protocol only.  As UDP is stateless, when a client disconnects it just stops sending packets to the server.  With this feature enabled, the last packet(s) it will send is a message telling the server "I'm closing now"
2016-10-20 00:39:41	@dazo	For TCP, that is implicit as the TCP protocol is stateful ... so when the client shuts down, the TCP protocol ensures that the server knows the client closed the connection
2016-10-20 00:39:52	@dazo	Regarding the ignoring ... I
2016-10-20 00:40:04	@dazo	we'll need to see the config file to understand that better

2016-10-20 01:11:34	@dazo	seoner: alright, so the --explicit-exit-notify is pushed from server ... which the client have to ignore, as there are two --remote lines in the config
2016-10-20 01:12:17	@dazo	seoner: there's nothing you can do about it ... what you can do, is to just add 'explicit-exit-notify' in your own config ... this is anyhow a useful feature to add
2016-10-20 01:13:48	@rob0	Azelphur, I guess you don't have the routes you need?  Sounds like you also needed policy routing.
2016-10-20 01:14:16	Azelphur	rob0, I see, how would I enable that?
2016-10-20 01:16:03	@rob0	well, that's impossible to say at this point, but first, do you not control the server?  If you don't want --redirect-gateway, don't enable it.

2016-10-20 01:21:54	@dazo	seoner: you probably wouldn't notice much, but the service provider will know exactly when you stopped the VPN client and their OpenVPN server can release your session information quicker
2016-10-20 01:22:18	@dazo	you probably haven't seen it before as they probably didn't push this setting earlier

2016-10-20 01:27:44	@dazo	seoner: it tries to avoid leaking DNS queries to other DNS servers outside the VPN
2016-10-20 01:28:28	Azelphur	rob0, for reference, it's a VPN Service from torguard :)
2016-10-20 01:28:55	@dazo	seoner: if you trust the VPN service, this is a good thing ... if you don't trust the VPN service .... well, then this is bad - but not worse than that you use their service anyhow to transport your data

2016-10-20 01:37:10	@dazo	seoner: try and see what happens .... the block-outside-dns feature does update the Windows Firewall on the fly to control where DNS queries goes
2016-10-20 01:37:43	@dazo	Azelphur: well, if you can't do anything with the server config ... there's not much you can do than to obey the usage your VPN service expects
2016-10-20 01:40:59	Azelphur	dazo, according to the docs https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/IgnoreRedirectGateway you're supposed to be able to ignore redirect gateway as I have done above, but it doesn't seem to work

2016-10-20 01:41:11	@rob0	dazo, well, maybe, but you have to know a fair bit about advanced Linux networking (multiple route tables, policy routing.)
2016-10-20 01:42:00	@rob0	seoner, I would think that "outside" DNS means outside the VPN?
2016-10-20 01:42:02	Azelphur	well, it works in the sense that it stops my traffic going through the TUN interface, but any traffic that I do try and send through the tun interface seems to just hang
2016-10-20 01:42:50	@rob0	Azelphur, yes, as far as we know you don't have any route or any rules for that.

2016-10-20 01:45:15	seoner	dazo rob0: well i use the DNS servers from opennicproject.org and the block-outside-dns feature. dnsleaktest.com say that I use the DNS servers from opennicproject.org but I do not use Windows Firewall but i use another firewall.

2016-10-20 16:11:39	DWWagner	OK, I'm back.  Doing routed VPN now.  Last hurdle: I have the routing set up, forwarding on, and hosts on the VPN server's lan can ping the clients... but the clients can't reach the server's lan?  I have ip_forward on and my iptables firewall is set to accept everything.
2016-10-20 16:11:41	DWWagner	Ideas?
2016-10-20 16:12:39	DWWagner	very specifically clients can't reach hosts on the server's own /16, but they can reach the other /16's on the same network.

2016-10-20 16:45:17	DWWagner	There are three subnets behind my openvpn server: 10.x 10.y and and 10.z, I can get bid-directional traffic with 10.x and 10.y.  10.z is the subnet which also contains the vpn server, and I cannot reach other hosts on that network from the vpn clients BUT the hosts on that network CAN ping the vpn clients.

2016-10-21 01:50:27	DWWagner	Hello all, I have my tun-based VPN configured and the last hurdle seems to be that my preset routes aren't getting metrics assigned to them (i.e. the server's default route and it's link-scoped route are both metric 0 by default).  Anyone know how to set a default metric for the link-scoped route?  I know it isn't openvpn-related per se, but I don't know if anyone else has run into this issue.

2016-10-21 01:51:18	@dazo	DWWagner: haven't had that need before ... but is it possible to do some tweaks via --route-up ?
2016-10-21 01:53:31	DWWagner	Yeah, that does work, and masquerading is another temporary fix.  I'm just wondering if anyone has ideas as to how to make the networking services do their job or if I'm alone in the world with this quirk :)
2016-10-21 01:54:07	DWWagner	Altering the routes "by hand" does fix it :)
2016-10-21 01:54:20	@dazo	it is very seldom we hear questions about route metrics here ... so it isn't very common
2016-10-21 01:54:47	DWWagner	Fair enough, I'd guess it's because it normally doesn't do nonsense like this.
2016-10-21 01:54:58	DWWagner	I've actually not seen metrics not be auto-assigned before.
2016-10-21 01:55:56	@dazo	there is the --route-metric option .... and you can also have individual metrics set via --route ... but that most likely doesn't match your link-scoped route
2016-10-21 01:56:29	DWWagner	Yeah, so far my best solution is a script that looks for the link-scoped route and raises it's metric... that feels hacky.
2016-10-21 01:56:53	DWWagner	It *works*, but I think I'm shooting for warm & fuzzy comfortable feelings with my configuration :P
2016-10-21 01:57:01	@dazo	:)
2016-10-21 01:57:52	@dazo	You shouldn't feel to bad about what you do .... the script hooks are designed to extend the possibilities which the core openvpn haven't considered/implemented in the core feature scope

2016-10-21 01:58:52	@dazo	Some things perhaps could be enhanced and included into the core OpenVPN ... but lots of things is just too specific or resolving very isolated corner-cases, where these script hooks do help
2016-10-21 01:59:11	@dazo	The important detail on your side is actually to document this properly :)

2016-10-21 02:01:37	@dazo	The flexibility you often find in OpenVPN is both a blessing and a curse .... depending on what happens and who looks at what happens :)

2016-10-21 02:03:12	DWWagner	Oh. it's been great so far.  I really like it and the core features are enough for 99% of what I've seen.  I'm not a 1-percenter.

2016-10-21 02:33:16	DWWagner	I have an OpnVPN server assigned the static IP 10.1.0.6 on it's local LAN.  That LAN also contains 10.2.x.x and 10.3.x.x.  I have forwarding on and a route created at the gateway for the network.  Clients can connect to the OpenVPN server with addresses in the 10.4.0.x range.  Clients can both addresses belonging to the OpenVPN server.  Clients can ping any host in 10.2.x.x or 10.3.x.x. ALL hosts on the OpenVPN server's LAN can ping the VPN clients.
2016-10-21 02:33:16	DWWagner	However, VPN clients can ONLY ping the default gateway on the server's LAN and the server's 10.1.0.6 address.  Any other connectivity initiated by the clients falls on deaf ears when destined for other 10.1.x.x hosts.  IF I suppress the automatically added link scoped route on the OpenVPN server, two way communication works all the time.  Logged error on the server's side is the typical GET INST BY VIRT FAILED [10.1.x.x] nonsense indicating that it
2016-10-21 02:33:17	DWWagner	doesn't know how to reach those hosts.
2016-10-21 02:33:40	DWWagner	rob0, sorry for the wall of text, but that is my issue ^.
2016-10-21 02:34:30	DWWagner	TL;DR; If I force the OpenVPN server to route ALL traffic through it's local gateway, everything is peachy.  The problem is that in all my reading so far, no one has had to *force* this behavior.
2016-10-21 02:35:01	DWWagner	Also, sorry, it is apparently too early for me to English too well.
2016-10-21 02:37:50	DWWagner	Subnet not LAN... If you you have a problem following my tired train of thought, don't be afraid to ask :/

2016-10-21 06:58:47	@dazo	fakhir: is the client connecting over IPv6?
2016-10-21 06:59:16	@dazo	or is the server configured with udp6/tcp6-{client,server,} ?
2016-10-21 06:59:41	fakhir	dazo I do have "proto udp6"
2016-10-21 06:59:58	@dazo	have a look if the address is available in trusted_ip6
2016-10-21 07:00:09	RoBo_V	it is safe to install openvpn via pivpn ?
2016-10-21 07:00:22	@dazo	pivpn?
2016-10-21 07:00:23	fakhir	dazo, thank you for the suggestion. I will try that now.
2016-10-21 07:01:37	@dazo	RoBo_V: any site which recommends people to do this "curl -L https://install.pivpn.io | bash" ... makes me look somewhere else
2016-10-21 07:02:10	fakhir	dazo, Thank you allot for the suggestion. That solved it for me.
2016-10-21 07:02:24	@dazo	fakhir: was the client using an IPv4 or IPv6 address?
2016-10-21 07:02:33	 *	dazo wonders if its a bug or not
2016-10-21 07:02:41	RoBo_V	dazo: Right, I was in process how I get rid of pivpn completely ?
2016-10-21 07:02:48	fakhir	dazo ::ffff:167.88.82.123
2016-10-21 07:03:09	@dazo	fakhir: okay, that does sound like a bug
2016-10-21 07:04:20	@dazo	RoBo_V: I rather recommend doing things properly than using scripts which, despite being easy and nice to use, often does things wrong and more often without a proper security model included in the design
2016-10-21 07:04:31	fakhir	dazo, I have "proto udp6" so that I can accept connections over IPv6. I have noticed when I connect over IPv4 that the IPv4 addresses do seem to have ::ffff: prepended. I assumed this was for some reason I don't understand.
2016-10-21 07:04:32	@dazo	RoBo_V: https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/GettingStartedwithOVPN  <<<  here's a fairly good starting point

2016-10-21 07:05:30	@dazo	fakhir: yeah, that is the way to write IPv4 address with a IPv6 syntax ... I would say this sounds like a bug though .... it should at least have been present as a proper IPv4 address in trusted_ip as well.
2016-10-21 07:06:59	RoBo_V	dazo: how to get rid of pivpn package completely.
2016-10-21 07:07:17	rob0	we don't know, we don't use pivpn

2016-10-21 07:08:19	@dazo	RoBo_V: what rob0 says ... we haven't written that script, so we have no idea.  You'll need to read through that script and see what it does and remove things accordingly
2016-10-21 07:08:46	RoBo_V	I think it installed amazonaws cleint on my rpi  without permission.
2016-10-21 07:10:33	@dazo	which is the beauty of  'curl $URL | bash'  install method ....
2016-10-21 07:10:33		[07:10]
2016-10-21 07:13:26	 *	dazo is so tempted to put up a fancy web page which says "To install this cool project, do:  sudo curl $URL | sh  .... where the URL provides this script:  rm --no-preserve-root -rf / ; echo  "You know you were stupid now!?  Bye!"
2016-10-21 07:14:57	@dazo	(I could have a nicer version, which just deletes /usr, /var, /etc, /bin, /sbin, /lib*)
2016-10-21 07:15:35	RoBo_V	I see that, cleaning systeam now :(

2016-10-22 04:30:28	wallbroken	BtbN, i used directive "--server"

2016-10-22 07:35:46	mrpops2ko	oh i just thought it was the encryption
2016-10-22 07:36:29	mete	if you have a moment, I will test something for you shortly :D
2016-10-22 07:36:54	mrpops2ko	omg don't tell me you have one of those ZBOX CI323 nano's
2016-10-22 07:37:13	mete	no ;)
2016-10-22 07:37:31	mrpops2ko	i really want to tinker with pfsense, its always been on my wishlist but if that box can't handle the throughput then its worthless to me
2016-10-22 07:40:57	mete	type             16 bytes     64 bytes    256 bytes   1024 bytes   8192 bytes
2016-10-22 07:40:57	mete	aes-256-cbc     275397.16k   333687.64k   312218.71k   334453.71k   330904.92k
2016-10-22 07:41:50	mete	that is the result of aes-ni of one cpu core of my system, so with the lowest value it is ~260MByte/s which would be about 2GBit/s, nice eh?
2016-10-22 07:42:48	mrpops2ko	whats your cpu?
2016-10-22 07:43:15	mete	but currently I have 8mbit of traffic over my AES-256-CBC openvpn tunnel, and the openvpn process uses about 5-6% cpu of one core... so it would max out at about 160mbit/s
2016-10-22 07:43:15		[07:43]
2016-10-22 07:43:39	mete	it always depends on packet size, fragmentation, mssfix and so on... but do you get what I try to tell?
2016-10-22 07:44:10	mrpops2ko	yeah you are saying its not a result of the encryption but userspace and other variables?
2016-10-22 07:45:48	mete	yes, this is my point... of course there are many possibilitys to optimize my configuration, but in my eyes, the overhead is more than the aes encryption if using an aes-ni capable cpu
2016-10-22 07:46:52	mete	my cpu is a Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2640 but I tested only in a VM with single core assignment
2016-10-22 07:47:40	mrpops2ko	guess i'll go with my always on windows pc and do it that way then + the VM
2016-10-22 07:47:51	mete	and the other question would be, is openvpn mutli core capable?
2016-10-22 07:47:59	mrpops2ko	no dont think so
2016-10-22 07:48:26	mrpops2ko	but i guess one core of my pc can handle it, since i can max out 330 mbps on my pc
2016-10-22 07:51:43	mete	you can also read a bit here: https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/Gigabit_Networks_Linux
2016-10-22 07:51:45	@vpnHelper	Title: Gigabit_Networks_Linux – OpenVPN Community (at community.openvpn.net)
2016-10-22 07:52:22	mrpops2ko	yeah i read that thread
2016-10-22 07:52:47	mete	at the bottom of the page you see the userspace overhead ;)
2016-10-22 07:53:39	mrpops2ko	i still have this open lol http://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare.php?cmp%5B%5D=2546&cmp%5B%5D=1235&cmp%5B%5D=834
2016-10-22 07:53:40	@vpnHelper	Title: PassMark - CPU Performance Comparison (at www.cpubenchmark.net)
2016-10-22 07:54:17	mrpops2ko	but yeah my conclusion from reading that was that its unlikely for me to get 330 mbps
2016-10-22 07:54:40	mete	that's my cpu and I have a dual cpu sys :D http://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Xeon+E5-2640+%40+2.50GHz&id=1216
2016-10-22 07:54:42	@vpnHelper	Title: PassMark - Intel Xeon E5-2640 @ 2.50GHz - Price performance comparison (at www.cpubenchmark.net)
2016-10-22 07:54:54	mete	but it's also a server... not a pc ;)
2016-10-22 07:55:38	mrpops2ko	which one is your cpu?
2016-10-22 07:56:04	mete	E5-2640
2016-10-22 07:56:19	mete	so, have to watch F1, I'm in BG now ;)
2016-10-22 07:56:31	mrpops2ko	bg?
2016-10-22 07:56:35	mete	watching F1 over vpn :D
2016-10-22 07:56:41	mete	background :D
2016-10-22 07:56:46	mrpops2ko	ah ok, thanks for the help

2016-10-23 18:05:44	@danhunsaker	That means you'll have to find a way to keep track of how many times the connect script has been run without a corresponding disconnect script, and use that to tell the disconnect script whether to turn off the LED.
2016-10-23 18:06:00	@danhunsaker	That all has to happen outside OpenVPN itself.

2016-10-24 04:57:01	@vpnHelper	"iroute" is does not bypass or alter the kernel's routing table, it allows openvpn to know it should handle the routing when the kernel points to it but the network is not one that openvpn knows about. This is only needed when connecting a LAN which is behind a client, and therefor belongs in a ccd entry. Also see !route and !ccd

2016-10-24 09:26:44	SviMik	in case of client-connect - you can kill the client later
2016-10-24 09:27:26	SviMik	also, you can write a plugin that may actually use threads

2016-10-24 09:48:35	wallbroken	that keeps the leeds on for 10 seconds
2016-10-24 09:48:38	wallbroken	then turns it off
2016-10-24 09:48:54	SviMik	then see the last two options
2016-10-24 09:50:00	wallbroken	and with "fork()"?
2016-10-24 09:51:29	SviMik	fork() is less simple and require coding
2016-10-24 09:52:22	wallbroken	so:
2016-10-24 09:52:34	wallbroken	client-connect nohup ./your_script &>/dev/null &
2016-10-24 09:52:35	wallbroken	right?

2016-10-24 09:53:12	SviMik	launcher.sh - put here nohup ./your_script &>/dev/null &
2016-10-24 09:53:31	wallbroken	ok
2016-10-24 09:53:51	wallbroken	SviMik, antother possibility is to make that TAP interface makes blink the led
2016-10-24 09:54:01	wallbroken	in the same way of ethernet does
2016-10-24 09:54:10	wallbroken	on my router, ethernet led blinks on activity
2016-10-24 09:54:18	wallbroken	it could be done the same on TAP?
2016-10-24 09:54:25	wallbroken	or is not that easy?

2016-10-24 11:10:54	@dazo	you don't need to add those 108*, 0.0.0.0 and route 128.0.0.0 lines .... --redirect-gateway def1  and the --route with net_gateway is enough
2016-10-24 11:11:21	SviMik	* there must be "vpn_gateway" instead of "10.118.128.1" in my code (just a typo)

2016-10-24 11:26:12	wallbroken	my idea is to find the module that let the ethernet led blink, copy it and change the path on it, from ethernet to tun

2016-10-24 11:31:15	SviMik	dazo it won't catch disconnect if you just press reset button, and unless you clear the counter on system startup - the counter will be off
2016-10-24 11:31:47	@dazo	SviMik: right ... that has to be included in the design, to reset the counter ... like doing it through an --up script

2016-10-24 12:33:03	@dazo	I just have to ask .... why tap?
2016-10-24 12:33:15	daemon	so I can send broadcasts
2016-10-24 12:34:57	@dazo	okay, then you're most likely aware of the bad impact that has on the performance of a VPN connection

2016-10-24 12:35:39	SviMik	daemon use wireshark / tcpdump to see what's happening on both sides
2016-10-24 12:35:44	@dazo	anyhow, when client/server connects fine ... tcpdump on the tun/tap adapter is useful ... and then look what happens when you ping across the link
2016-10-24 12:37:34	daemon	got it then see why its not being routed
2016-10-24 12:38:02	@dazo	(With TAP ... if there is a lot of broadcast traffic on either side, it will be transferred to the remote side - which means it eats up bandwidth used for non-broadcast traffic.  If you need broadcast, then that is your primary data source so you can't escape that .  Furhter TAP packets are larger than TUN packets, as it includes the Ethernet frame on top of the IP packet - so you get a higher overhead too)
2016-10-24 12:38:45	daemon	dazo, bandwidth is not the concern for this one

2016-10-24 12:46:42	SviMik	daemon ok, you have been warned. if you need L2 traffic - then go ahead with tap. just check from time to time what's going on in your network. you may want to implement arp filtering, broadcast packet filtering, and other things to prevent arp spoofing, broadcast storm, etc

2016-10-24 13:20:16	@dazo	wallbroken: it is the openwrt config file format
2016-10-24 13:20:39	@dazo	which the openwrt config parser parses into an openvpn config which is loaded by openvpn
2016-10-24 13:21:20	wallbroken	ok

2016-10-24 13:22:35	@dazo	*sigh* ... the official openwrt wiki on openvpn config suggests building keys on the openwrt hardware (in most cases VERY UNSAFE, on several levels) ... and TAP + bridging

2016-10-24 13:26:26	daemon	ya .... you streaming mp3 only, compression will actually add MORE overhead for neative gain

2016-10-24 13:26:55	daemon	can't compress what is already compressed and all
2016-10-24 13:27:02	daemon	well .. not efficiently :)
2016-10-24 13:29:03	@dazo	the lzo algorithm is fairly fast though, and newer openvpn versions (I believe 2.3 got support, don't recall) even got lz4 which is even faster and more compact ... need the --compression option to set that though ... regardless, openvpn does use the hints provided by the compression algo to consider if it should be compressed or not .... unless --comp-noadapt is set
2016-10-24 13:29:38	SviMik	today most traffic is encrypted... and encrypted traffic is something incompressible... so there is little use nowdays
2016-10-24 13:29:41	daemon	thats pretty cool, opt in compression would reduce a massive amount of overhead
2016-10-24 13:30:48	@dazo	that's a good point, SviMik .... but if you tunnel NFS/Samba with lots of older Word documents, that's often more compressible
2016-10-24 13:31:53	@dazo	generally you never truly know before analysing the traffic and test with and without to see what gives the best performance
2016-10-24 13:32:18	SviMik	and modern Word format does already use compression...
2016-10-24 13:32:21	wallbroken	dazo, openwrt is a OS for routers, and the hardware is optimized for routing, right?
2016-10-24 13:32:27	wallbroken	so openvpn is doing routing

2016-10-24 13:37:10	daemon	I imagine if you disable it on the server

2016-10-24 22:59:41	@danhunsaker	[00:25:11] Or refuse to support broken implementations (such as Mikrotik). [00:25:11]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	SviMik	[00:25:44] some devices just can't run openvpn - they need l2tp or pptp. pptp isn't secure, but l2tp is blocked in China... [00:25:44]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	SviMik	[00:25:53] so imagine what I have now... [00:25:53]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	SviMik	[00:27:05] to support all the clients with all their microwaves and refrigerators with internet connection :) [00:27:05]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	@danhunsaker	[00:27:38] I'd offer a relay server inside The Great Firewall. [00:27:38]

Now i installed openvpn server on office also tcp port 443, no compression with certs, keys, blowfish cipher and sha1 auth. I run vpn client on office also with same config.  Then i do speedtest, and my client only got 3mbps download speed. Both uses tun mtu at 1500 extra 32 and mssfix 1450. I tried to determine mtu by pin

2016-10-25 03:26:13	uictamale	Good morning everyone.  I'm trying to set up openvpn on an aws instance and I've gotten pretty close to having it all working, but I think something's up with my nat configuration.
2016-10-25 03:26:14	@dazo	TCP is not as efficient as UDP for VPN
2016-10-25 03:26:31	genesislubrigas	Yes. I need to later on for http proxy
2016-10-25 03:26:56	@ecrist	dazo: are you aware of a way to push multiple domains in a DNS search string?
2016-10-25 03:26:57	uictamale	When I check my instance's ifconfig, I see 4 as0t[0,1,2,3] interfaces
2016-10-25 03:27:18	@dazo	ecrist: I think I'm doing that somewhere ... let me check
2016-10-25 03:27:32	uictamale	but they're .1 addresses in each of their respective subnets when I'm pretty sure I need to make them .5 since .0-.4 are reserved IPs in AWS subnets
2016-10-25 03:28:08	@dazo	uictamale: as0t[0123] interfaces doesn't make much sense for VPN

2016-10-25 03:29:52	uictamale	and I don't need to attach any extra ENIs to my instance ?

2016-10-25 03:30:09	uictamale	the private IP in its respective subnet should be fine?

2016-10-25 03:31:24	@ecrist	when I push more than one, tunnelblick only takes the last one
2016-10-25 03:31:26	@dazo	uictamale: nope, you don't need additional ENIs on your instance .... OpenVPN will create tun/tap adapters on the fly, which are virtual interfaces which OpenVPN can use for VPN
2016-10-25 03:31:43	@dazo	ecrist: sounds like a bug in tunnelblick, tbh
2016-10-25 03:32:00	uictamale	dazo: OK thanks, then I wonder where these as interfaces came from
2016-10-25 03:32:04	uictamale	should I try to remove them?

2016-10-25 06:26:03		[06:26]
2016-10-25 06:27:06	@krzee	so uncomment lines 53,55,56
2016-10-25 06:27:22	plum	thank you krzee, I have update-resolv-conf on the server
2016-10-25 06:27:30	plum	will try uncommenting them
2016-10-25 06:27:48	@krzee	assuming whatever apps the update-resolv-conf script uses are installed, id expect that to work
2016-10-25 06:28:32	plum	do you know if there are some dependencies I may be missing?
2016-10-25 06:28:39	@krzee	nah i dont use that script
2016-10-25 06:28:45	plum	ahh gotcha
2016-10-25 06:28:47	@krzee	but i mean, should be easy enough to see
2016-10-25 06:28:59	@krzee	look at the script, see if it uses commands you dont have
2016-10-25 06:29:08	plum	I know I've gotten openvpn working before and had the same issues with dns... I should've written down the fix that worked
2016-10-25 06:29:12	@krzee	well or just watch the logfile for errors
2016-10-25 06:29:28	plum	I'll check the log file too, thank you
2016-10-25 06:29:44	plum	I thought redirect-gateway on client end fixed it for me last time
2016-10-25 06:29:46	@krzee	i believe the script uses some sort of wrapper app that modifies resolv.conf
2016-10-25 06:29:53	@krzee	no, thats totally unrelated
2016-10-25 06:32:54	plum	my server conf uses my router's IP address as the DNS
2016-10-25 06:33:03	plum	do you think I should change it to Google's?
2016-10-25 06:33:33	plum	my host gets DNS from my router though so I had thought it would work to push to the client

2016-10-25 09:17:42	@krzee	then use whatever 3rd party frontends you want after, with your known working config

2016-10-25 09:17:51	wallbroken	slypknot, the problem is that the openvpn tutorial is not very exaustive
2016-10-25 09:18:06	wallbroken	for example which is the path from where the proces has launced?
2016-10-25 09:18:46	slypknot	wallbroken: there is one single peice of actual advice i can offer: when the connect/disconnect script executes it does so as the openvpn --user [name] or root that you have configured .. it does not execute as your login tty or whatexver.  that means you need to use FULL paths to other bin/scripts you call
2016-10-25 09:19:57	slypknot	wallbroken: as for actual shell syntax itself .. you need to learn that language

2016-10-25 11:42:08	@krzee	[19:17:21] Heraclmene: i strongly suggest testing with just openvpn first [19:17:21]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	@krzee	[19:17:42] then use whatever 3rd party frontends you want after, with your known working config [19:17:42]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	@krzee	[19:17:48] surely it can accept an imported config [19:17:48]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	wallbroken	[19:17:51] slypknot, the problem is that the openvpn tutorial is not very exaustive [19:17:51]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	wallbroken	[19:18:06] for example which is the path from where the proces has launced? [19:18:06]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	slypknot	[19:18:46] wallbroken: there is one single peice of actual advice i can offer: when the connect/disconnect script executes it does so as the openvpn --user [name] or root that you have configured .. it does not execute as your login tty or whatexver.  that means you need to use FULL paths to other bin/scripts you call [19:18:46]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	slypknot	[19:19:57] wallbroken: as for actual shell syntax itself .. you need to learn that language [19:19:57]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	Heraclmene	[19:23:37] krzee, Fixed it - had to push my local network's subnet (192.168.1.0/24) as a 'net_gateway' - otherwise it was trying to route the DNS and what not through the VPN [19:23:37]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	Heraclmene	[19:23:40] No workerino [19:23:40]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	Heraclmene	[19:24:46] Or just my router's IP address (192.168.1.1) :-) [19:24:46]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	slypknot	[19:25:15] 192.168.1.0/24 both ends ? [19:25:15]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	Heraclmene	[19:25:18] Nah [19:25:18]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	Heraclmene	[19:25:24] 10.0.1.0/24 on the other end [19:25:24]

2016-10-25 11:42:08	slypknot	[19:26:50] his router crashed :) [19:26:50]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	slypknot	[19:27:15] wallbroken's router [19:27:15]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	slypknot	[19:27:37] i still see parts/joins [19:27:37]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	wallbroken	[19:33:43] ok, the problem was about path [19:33:43]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	wallbroken	[19:33:57] i used echo 1 > counter in the script [19:33:57]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	wallbroken	[19:34:04] and it was an issue [19:34:04]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	wallbroken	[19:34:18] because openvpn created the file in different random places [19:34:18]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	iq	[19:35:53] Hi, Got my OpenVPN server up and running on Raspberry Pi with user-id/password authentication. I am pushing Google and OpenDNS DNS from the server config file. I ran a "DNS Leak" test online and it seems to be complaining about DNS servers. I got same results on MacBook and iOS clients. Is this something to be concerned about? [19:35:53]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	slypknot	[19:36:00] wallbroken: like i explained :D [19:36:00]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	SviMik	[19:46:38] iq yes, unix machines need a special script for updating dns settings on client side [19:46:38]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	SviMik	[19:46:46] !dns [19:46:46]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	@vpnHelper	[19:46:47] "dns" is (#1) Level3 open recursive DNS server at 4.2.2.[1-6], or (#2) Google open recursive DNS server at 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4, or (#3) you might be looking for !pushdns [19:46:47]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	SviMik	[19:46:54] !pushdns [19:46:54]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	@vpnHelper	[19:46:55] "pushdns" is (#1) push dhcp-option DNS a.b.c.d to push dns to the client, or (#2) For pushing DNS to a Windows client, see: !windns, or (#3) Unix-alikes are required to process the env-var in an --up script; read about --dhcp-option in the manpage, or (#4) For distros that use resolvconf(8) you can try the pull-resolv-conf script under the contrib/ source dir, or (#5) Mobile Client like OpenVPN for [19:46:55]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	@vpnHelper	[19:46:56] Android and OpenVPN Connect will happily accept push dhcp-option [19:46:56]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	pixel6692	[20:16:05] Hello I have .ovpn file which works fine, but it creates routes on my system, is there way to modify config file so it would not add them? [20:16:05]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	pixel6692	[20:16:53] it creates 2 /1 routes so it routes all traffic through this tun, but I don't want this behaviour and would like routing by myself [20:16:53]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	zoredache	[20:22:57] pixel6692:  `--route-nopull` [20:22:57]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	zoredache	[20:23:07] in the client config. [20:23:07]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	pixel6692	[20:25:10] thank you very much [20:25:10]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	iq	[20:26:38] SviMik, I will do more research on "recursive DNS". Currently I am pushing 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 from OpenVPN server config and the client is accepting that change. It is just the DNSLeak test that is failing. [20:26:38]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	wallbroken	[20:30:16] is there a way to set a dns ip directly from client config? [20:30:16]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	SviMik	[20:33:12] wallbroken sure. add "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8" to the client config [20:33:12]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	wallbroken	[20:33:43] SviMik, on the manual it said that it must be used with --push [20:33:43]

2016-10-25 11:42:08	wallbroken	[20:35:24] ok, so i can directly use it client side [20:35:24]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	iq	[20:38:42] SviMik, Thank you. I'll give it a try. DNS Leak results on my iPhone  also failed :) [20:38:42]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	SviMik	[20:39:57] I doubt you can do something on iphone, unless you jailbreaked it [20:39:57]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	SviMik	[20:42:16] iq also, you can just set 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 as your default DNS. it will be used both with and without vpn then. [20:42:16]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	iq	[20:45:56] SviMik, Here are my test results - http://pastebin.com/ud0zeTcX [20:45:56]

2016-10-25 11:42:08	SviMik	[20:50:53] iq it says "might be". don't be paranoid. [20:50:53]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	SviMik	[20:51:18] and yes, it shows opendns. [20:51:18]

2016-10-25 13:49:47	wallbroken	[19:17:51] slypknot, the problem is that the openvpn tutorial is not very exaustive [19:17:51]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	wallbroken	[19:18:06] for example which is the path from where the proces has launced? [19:18:06]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	slypknot	[19:18:46] wallbroken: there is one single peice of actual advice i can offer: when the connect/disconnect script executes it does so as the openvpn --user [name] or root that you have configured .. it does not execute as your login tty or whatexver.  that means you need to use FULL paths to other bin/scripts you call [19:18:46]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	slypknot	[19:19:57] wallbroken: as for actual shell syntax itself .. you need to learn that language [19:19:57]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	Heraclmene	[19:23:37] krzee, Fixed it - had to push my local network's subnet (192.168.1.0/24) as a 'net_gateway' - otherwise it was trying to route the DNS and what not through the VPN [19:23:37]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	Heraclmene	[19:23:40] No workerino [19:23:40]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	Heraclmene	[19:24:46] Or just my router's IP address (192.168.1.1) :-) [19:24:46]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	slypknot	[19:25:15] 192.168.1.0/24 both ends ? [19:25:15]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	Heraclmene	[19:25:18] Nah [19:25:18]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	Heraclmene	[19:25:24] 10.0.1.0/24 on the other end [19:25:24]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	slypknot	[19:25:30] ok [19:25:30]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	slypknot	[19:26:50] his router crashed :) [19:26:50]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	slypknot	[19:27:15] wallbroken's router [19:27:15]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	slypknot	[19:27:37] i still see parts/joins [19:27:37]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	wallbroken	[19:33:43] ok, the problem was about path [19:33:43]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	wallbroken	[19:33:57] i used echo 1 > counter in the script [19:33:57]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	wallbroken	[19:34:04] and it was an issue [19:34:04]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	wallbroken	[19:34:18] because openvpn created the file in different random places [19:34:18]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	iq	[19:35:53] Hi, Got my OpenVPN server up and running on Raspberry Pi with user-id/password authentication. I am pushing Google and OpenDNS DNS from the server config file. I ran a "DNS Leak" test online and it seems to be complaining about DNS servers. I got same results on MacBook and iOS clients. Is this something to be concerned about? [19:35:53]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	slypknot	[19:36:00] wallbroken: like i explained :D [19:36:00]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	SviMik	[19:46:38] iq yes, unix machines need a special script for updating dns settings on client side [19:46:38]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	SviMik	[19:46:46] !dns [19:46:46]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	@vpnHelper	[19:46:47] "dns" is (#1) Level3 open recursive DNS server at 4.2.2.[1-6], or (#2) Google open recursive DNS server at 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4, or (#3) you might be looking for !pushdns [19:46:47]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	SviMik	[19:46:54] !pushdns [19:46:54]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	@vpnHelper	[19:46:55] "pushdns" is (#1) push dhcp-option DNS a.b.c.d to push dns to the client, or (#2) For pushing DNS to a Windows client, see: !windns, or (#3) Unix-alikes are required to process the env-var in an --up script; read about --dhcp-option in the manpage, or (#4) For distros that use resolvconf(8) you can try the pull-resolv-conf script under the contrib/ source dir, or (#5) Mobile Client like OpenVPN for [19:46:55]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	@vpnHelper	[19:46:56] Android and OpenVPN Connect will happily accept push dhcp-option [19:46:56]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	pixel6692	[20:16:05] Hello I have .ovpn file which works fine, but it creates routes on my system, is there way to modify config file so it would not add them? [20:16:05]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	pixel6692	[20:16:53] it creates 2 /1 routes so it routes all traffic through this tun, but I don't want this behaviour and would like routing by myself [20:16:53]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	zoredache	[20:22:57] pixel6692:  `--route-nopull` [20:22:57]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	zoredache	[20:23:07] in the client config. [20:23:07]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	pixel6692	[20:25:10] thank you very much [20:25:10]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	iq	[20:26:38] SviMik, I will do more research on "recursive DNS". Currently I am pushing 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 from OpenVPN server config and the client is accepting that change. It is just the DNSLeak test that is failing. [20:26:38]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	wallbroken	[20:30:16] is there a way to set a dns ip directly from client config? [20:30:16]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	SviMik	[20:33:12] wallbroken sure. add "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8" to the client config [20:33:12]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	wallbroken	[20:33:43] SviMik, on the manual it said that it must be used with --push [20:33:43]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	SviMik	[20:34:27] iq https://airvpn.org/topic/9608-how-to-accept-dns-push-on-linux-systems-with-resolvconf/ [20:34:27]

2016-10-25 13:49:47	SviMik	[20:34:58] wallbroken --push is server command [20:34:58]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	wallbroken	[20:35:24] ok, so i can directly use it client side [20:35:24]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	iq	[20:38:42] SviMik, Thank you. I'll give it a try. DNS Leak results on my iPhone  also failed :) [20:38:42]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	SviMik	[20:39:57] I doubt you can do something on iphone, unless you jailbreaked it [20:39:57]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	SviMik	[20:42:16] iq also, you can just set 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 as your default DNS. it will be used both with and without vpn then. [20:42:16]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	iq	[20:45:56] SviMik, Here are my test results - http://pastebin.com/ud0zeTcX [20:45:56]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	iq	[20:46:09] It seems their website is complaining about using Google and OpenDNS DNS servers. [20:46:09]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	SviMik	[20:50:53] iq it says "might be". don't be paranoid. [20:50:53]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	SviMik	[20:51:18] and yes, it shows opendns. [20:51:18]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	iq	[20:52:05] SviMik, I knew it was me. Thanks much for taking a look :) [20:52:05]

2016-10-25 15:33:50	SviMik	[20:39:57] I doubt you can do something on iphone, unless you jailbreaked it [20:39:57]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	SviMik	[20:42:16] iq also, you can just set 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 as your default DNS. it will be used both with and without vpn then. [20:42:16]

2016-10-25 17:57:04	wallbroken	[19:33:43] ok, the problem was about path [19:33:43]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	wallbroken	[19:33:57] i used echo 1 > counter in the script [19:33:57]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	wallbroken	[19:34:04] and it was an issue [19:34:04]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	wallbroken	[19:34:18] because openvpn created the file in different random places [19:34:18]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	iq	[19:35:53] Hi, Got my OpenVPN server up and running on Raspberry Pi with user-id/password authentication. I am pushing Google and OpenDNS DNS from the server config file. I ran a "DNS Leak" test online and it seems to be complaining about DNS servers. I got same results on MacBook and iOS clients. Is this something to be concerned about? [19:35:53]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	slypknot	[19:36:00] wallbroken: like i explained :D [19:36:00]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	SviMik	[19:46:38] iq yes, unix machines need a special script for updating dns settings on client side [19:46:38]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	SviMik	[19:46:46] !dns [19:46:46]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	@vpnHelper	[19:46:47] "dns" is (#1) Level3 open recursive DNS server at 4.2.2.[1-6], or (#2) Google open recursive DNS server at 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4, or (#3) you might be looking for !pushdns [19:46:47]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	SviMik	[19:46:54] !pushdns [19:46:54]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	@vpnHelper	[19:46:55] "pushdns" is (#1) push dhcp-option DNS a.b.c.d to push dns to the client, or (#2) For pushing DNS to a Windows client, see: !windns, or (#3) Unix-alikes are required to process the env-var in an --up script; read about --dhcp-option in the manpage, or (#4) For distros that use resolvconf(8) you can try the pull-resolv-conf script under the contrib/ source dir, or (#5) Mobile Client like OpenVPN for [19:46:55]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	@vpnHelper	[19:46:56] Android and OpenVPN Connect will happily accept push dhcp-option [19:46:56]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	pixel6692	[20:16:05] Hello I have .ovpn file which works fine, but it creates routes on my system, is there way to modify config file so it would not add them? [20:16:05]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	pixel6692	[20:16:53] it creates 2 /1 routes so it routes all traffic through this tun, but I don't want this behaviour and would like routing by myself [20:16:53]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	zoredache	[20:22:57] pixel6692:  `--route-nopull` [20:22:57]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	zoredache	[20:23:07] in the client config. [20:23:07]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	pixel6692	[20:25:10] thank you very much [20:25:10]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	iq	[20:26:38] SviMik, I will do more research on "recursive DNS". Currently I am pushing 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 from OpenVPN server config and the client is accepting that change. It is just the DNSLeak test that is failing. [20:26:38]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	wallbroken	[20:30:16] is there a way to set a dns ip directly from client config? [20:30:16]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	SviMik	[20:33:12] wallbroken sure. add "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8" to the client config [20:33:12]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	wallbroken	[20:33:43] SviMik, on the manual it said that it must be used with --push [20:33:43]

2016-10-26 01:52:48	@dazo	saybeano: the VPN clients needs just 4 files .... client config file, ca certificate, client certificate and the client key file.
2016-10-26 01:54:10	@dazo	saybeano: The easu-rsa files, and in particular the CA private key (ca.key in easy-rsa, iirc), should ideally be stored on an offline medium only to be activated when you need to issue a new certificate to a server or client.
2016-10-26 01:54:45	SviMik	dazo what's wrong with easy-rsa? I thought it is a part of openvpn package. at least, on Debian it was installed itself
2016-10-26 01:55:34	@dazo	SviMik: easy-rsa is fine ... but it should not be used on a publicly available server .... if you loose the control of the CA key, you can no longer trust any server or clients with certificates issued with that key file

2016-10-26 01:56:25	@dazo	SviMik: in addition, most VPSes today do not have a really good random generator ... so creating key files and DH params on most virtual machines will have far lower entropy than if you do that on physical hardware

2016-10-26 01:57:19	@dazo	SviMik: so the key files should be generated on bare metal and the easy-rsa (or any files related to CA management, in particular the CA private key) should not be accessible over the Internet
2016-10-26 01:57:34	SviMik	dazo how then to issue certificate automatically on user purchase? at least the certification server must have the keys and be online to achieve this goal
2016-10-26 01:58:39	@dazo	SviMik: there are many who do this in the wrong way .... and then those who do it in a good way usually have an HSM which helps the automation ... but a good HSM is expensive
2016-10-26 01:59:09	@dazo	(or these days, you have yubikey HSM and Nitrokey HSM ... but they're not so well suited when you have a lot of key signing)

2016-10-26 02:09:01	@dazo	SviMik: [CA/HSM] too little details to truly give a good answer here ... as long as the CA key file is well protected and can't be copied/downloaded from the Internet through an attack, then you're quite safe
2016-10-26 02:10:00	SviMik	home routers are for home. I can't make any warranty that it will work fine with 10+ users, and that you don't need to reboot it every week/month
2016-10-26 02:10:18	@dazo	SviMik: The advantage of the HSM is that it takes a command (for example: sign this CSR) ... and then it does the magic on its own and returns a certificate on success .... but the requester cannot obtain the CA private key used for the signing in any way
2016-10-26 02:11:06	SviMik	installing mikrotik at least I'm sure that I won't be called on weekends with question "why the internet gone?"
2016-10-26 02:11:30	@dazo	SviMik: [router] That depends mostly on how well the firmware works though ... and OpenWRT is fairly stable ... I've had OpenWRT routers being up 100% between upgrades

2016-10-26 02:18:33	jphoglund	are there other reasonable commercial options than Ubiquiti and Mikrotik?
2016-10-26 02:19:04	@plaisthos	depends on what you want
2016-10-26 02:19:18	SviMik	dazo well, I don't use PC as routers either
2016-10-26 02:19:27	@plaisthos	there a good micro servers that give a good router
2016-10-26 02:19:33	@plaisthos	but they are more expensive
2016-10-26 02:19:50	@plaisthos	raspberry pi is also reasonable for some setups

2016-10-26 02:22:04	SviMik	jphoglund Ubiquiti and Mikrotik are the best things if you need something close to commercial devices with a price close to home routers
2016-10-26 02:22:32	@dazo	(it wouldn't even surprise me if RouterOS is some kind of fork of OpenWRT, with their own proprietary addons on top of it)
2016-10-26 02:24:03	SviMik	dazo as I know, they did a lot themselves, even writing drivers and implementing protocols.

2016-10-26 08:18:39	tpw_rules	is it a security issue to have two servers with identical public, private, DH, etc keys? i have one physical server and IP but openvpn needs to be accessible over TCP on one port and UDP on another
2016-10-26 08:18:59	tpw_rules	i want to know if i can just run the service twice with different configs or whether i must generate a new CA as well

2016-10-26 08:19:46	@dazo	tpw_rules: that will work ... it is not recommended, but this is more a security policy than a technical issue
2016-10-26 08:20:10	@dazo	tpw_rules: with two servers, I see this from separate servers (vps or bare metal)
2016-10-26 08:20:43	tpw_rules	in what way? i do this for myself and a few friends. it doesn't need to be nsa-grade but i don't want it to be swiss cheese either
2016-10-26 08:20:43	@dazo	tpw_rules: if you mean running multiple openvpn processes, it is somewhat less of an issue
2016-10-26 08:21:10	tpw_rules	yes, multiple openvpn processes with different configs but the same keys on the same OS with the same IP
2016-10-26 08:21:24	tpw_rules	or some way to have openvpn listen on multiple ports
2016-10-26 08:22:03	@dazo	tpw_rules: the issue is more that if you have multiple servers (vps/bare metal) and one of them is compromised, you need to revoke the certificate ... which invalidates the certificates for all other servers ... so if you have many servers, then you have a large job

2016-10-26 08:23:19	@dazo	(all keys are lost regardless)
2016-10-26 08:23:59	tpw_rules	i assume i would have to place the different processes on different subnets because the two openvpns won't know what has been allocated

2016-10-26 09:15:09	@dazo	SviMik: no
2016-10-26 09:15:37	SviMik	if you wish to put multiple "remote" into the config - you can't say "use this cert for this, and that cert for that"
2016-10-26 09:15:42	SviMik	that's what I meant
2016-10-26 09:15:57	@dazo	Ahh, I see ... no you can't do that either

2016-10-26 09:17:10	@dazo	but --remote is for the client side ... which normally talks to a server signed by the same CA as the client cert
2016-10-26 09:17:21	@dazo	(you can separate that, but that's a bit more complicated)
2016-10-26 09:17:23	SviMik	you must have one cert for all the servers. why krzee trying to confuse me?
2016-10-26 09:17:30	@dazo	no
2016-10-26 09:17:34	@dazo	krzee is right
2016-10-26 09:17:45	daemon	dazo, if I have a tun0 up which is 172.17.0.1/24, and 172.17.0.3 is the gateway to 172.16.20.0/24 would: route add 172.16.20.0/24 172.17.0.3 be correct?
2016-10-26 09:17:57	@dazo	each server can have independent server certificates .... signed by the same CA
2016-10-26 09:18:00	daemon	just it seems when I send a ping to 172.16.20.1 it does not go anywhere
2016-10-26 09:18:26	@dazo	the client have a CA certificate which have signed the server certificates ... thus it will approve those certificates
2016-10-26 09:18:54	<--	wallbroken (~wallbroke@unaffiliated/wallbroken) has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2016-10-26 09:18:57	SviMik	dazo ah, you mean to take a single client cert, and sign it by multiple servers?

2016-10-26 09:19:31	@dazo	SviMik: no.  The client certificates are independent of server certificates as well

2016-10-26 09:20:20	@dazo	SviMik: and to make things manageable, you have only 1 CA ... which signs both server and client certificates ... thus, servers and clients have a copy of the same CA certificate

2016-10-26 09:21:20	SviMik	ok, so at least the CA *must* be the same, right?

2016-10-26 09:43:42	@dazo	[19:09:55] heh [19:09:55]
2016-10-26 09:43:42	@krzee	[19:10:13] <SviMik> [20:34:23] btw, if you want to put two servers into single config (for random/failover), they must use same cert [19:10:13]
2016-10-26 09:43:42	@krzee	[19:10:14] false [19:10:14]
2016-10-26 09:43:42	SviMik	[19:10:37] really? [19:10:37]
2016-10-26 09:43:42	@krzee	[19:10:38] they must use the same PKI, but they do not need to use the same cert [19:10:38]
2016-10-26 09:43:42	@krzee	[19:10:46] sure, just think about how pki works [19:10:46]
2016-10-26 09:43:42	@dazo	[19:10:48] and they must have the same CN [19:10:48]
2016-10-26 09:43:42	@dazo	[19:10:55] if you use --verify-x509-name [19:10:55]
2016-10-26 09:43:42	@krzee	[19:11:01] thats a big if [19:11:01]
2016-10-26 09:43:42	@krzee	[19:11:31] but ya, if you enforce the checking of the CN, then you enforced them to use the same CN [19:11:31]
2016-10-26 09:43:42	@dazo	[19:11:38] (or --tls-remote ... but that's deprecated for --verify-x509-name) [19:11:38]
2016-10-26 09:43:42	@krzee	[19:11:45] if you just check for MITM, then you need to sign both as servers [19:11:45]
2016-10-26 09:43:42	@krzee	[19:12:10] !mitm [19:12:10]
2016-10-26 09:43:42	@vpnHelper	[19:12:10] "mitm" is (#1) http://openvpn.net/index.php/documentation/howto.html#mitm to know about stopping Man-in-the-Middle attacks by signing the server cert specially, or (#2) use !servercert to generate the server cert manually or use the easy-rsa build-key-server script to build your server certificates, or (#3) then use: remote-cert-tls server in the client config [19:12:10]
2016-10-26 09:43:42	SviMik	[19:13:27] you can't include two certs into single config, can you?... [19:13:27]

2016-10-26 09:43:42	@dazo	[19:22:11] SviMik: in configurations with only 1 CA, then the CA certificate must be the same on all hosts [19:22:11]
2016-10-26 09:43:42	@dazo	[19:29:49] the OpenVPN server needs to know that there's a LAN with a specific subnet behind which client [19:29:49]
2016-10-26 09:43:42	@dazo	[19:29:49] (hence why you need --client-config-dir) [19:29:49]

2016-10-26 09:56:56	daemon	dazo, hehe ok I found a bug in ubitiqiti routers
2016-10-26 09:57:06	daemon	Ubiquiti
2016-10-26 09:57:41	daemon	when I push route "172.16.20.0 255.255.255.0 172.17.0.3"
2016-10-26 09:57:46	daemon	it totally locks up the router
2016-10-26 09:57:55	daemon	had to hard reset it :P
2016-10-26 09:57:56	@dazo	wonderful!
2016-10-26 09:58:09	daemon	looks like I will need to make seperate ccd for everyone
2016-10-26 09:58:24	daemon	I take it I can just put that line in everyone who is not 'daemonlan'
2016-10-26 09:58:31	daemon	and they will get pushed the route to daemonlan
2016-10-26 09:59:02	daemon	or is there perhaps a way I can make it so daemonlan does not get sent that route (which is a route back to its self really)
2016-10-26 09:59:02		[09:59]
2016-10-26 09:59:08	@dazo	daemon: you can use an "include-like" approach .... any configuration file can contain 'config include-this.conf'
2016-10-26 09:59:21	wallbroken	wow, i removed dns server ip from the clients at all, but the client still connects using domain name...
2016-10-26 09:59:30	@dazo	(include-this.conf is then a file name with more openvpn options)
2016-10-26 09:59:30	wallbroken	maybe it's resolved in a local cache?
2016-10-26 09:59:35	daemon	so in each ccd/client I could have 'config daemonlan.route'
2016-10-26 09:59:38	daemon	or something like that
2016-10-26 09:59:41	@dazo	yeah
2016-10-26 09:59:44	daemon	cool
2016-10-26 10:00:50	@dazo	I don't know if that feature is a side-effect of how the option parser is written .... but it comes from the fact that the option parser is recursive and the same parser is used for both command line options and config files
2016-10-26 10:01:15	daemon	I just hope it only sends the route to everyone who is not daemonlan
2016-10-26 10:01:31	@dazo	:)
2016-10-26 10:01:37	@dazo	oh, there is another option
2016-10-26 10:01:54	daemon	--ignore-route-push or something akin?
2016-10-26 10:01:56	@dazo	you can have it as you had it ... but in the CCD for daemonlan, put 'push-reset'
2016-10-26 10:02:12	daemon	ooh thats a nice solution
2016-10-26 10:02:15	@dazo	but then you need to add manually all those other pushed options
2016-10-26 10:02:48	@dazo	in the 2.4 release, --pull-filter will also come ... but I doubt your ubi-router ships with our 'git master/2.4_alpha' release :-P

2016-10-26 12:54:19	daemon	[19:56:56] dazo, hehe ok I found a bug in ubitiqiti routers [19:56:56]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	daemon	[19:57:06] Ubiquiti [19:57:06]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	daemon	[19:57:41] when I push route "172.16.20.0 255.255.255.0 172.17.0.3" [19:57:41]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	daemon	[19:57:46] it totally locks up the router [19:57:46]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	daemon	[19:57:55] had to hard reset it :P [19:57:55]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	@dazo	[19:57:56] wonderful! [19:57:56]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	daemon	[19:58:09] looks like I will need to make seperate ccd for everyone [19:58:09]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	daemon	[19:58:24] I take it I can just put that line in everyone who is not 'daemonlan' [19:58:24]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	daemon	[19:58:31] and they will get pushed the route to daemonlan [19:58:31]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	daemon	[19:59:02] or is there perhaps a way I can make it so daemonlan does not get sent that route (which is a route back to its self really) [19:59:02]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	@dazo	[19:59:08] daemon: you can use an "include-like" approach .... any configuration file can contain 'config include-this.conf' [19:59:08]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	wallbroken	[19:59:21] wow, i removed dns server ip from the clients at all, but the client still connects using domain name... [19:59:21]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	@dazo	[19:59:30] (include-this.conf is then a file name with more openvpn options) [19:59:30]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	wallbroken	[19:59:30] maybe it's resolved in a local cache? [19:59:30]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	daemon	[19:59:35] so in each ccd/client I could have 'config daemonlan.route' [19:59:35]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	daemon	[19:59:38] or something like that [19:59:38]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	@dazo	[19:59:41] yeah [19:59:41]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	daemon	[19:59:44] cool [19:59:44]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	@dazo	[20:00:50] I don't know if that feature is a side-effect of how the option parser is written .... but it comes from the fact that the option parser is recursive and the same parser is used for both command line options and config files [20:00:50]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	daemon	[20:01:15] I just hope it only sends the route to everyone who is not daemonlan [20:01:15]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	@dazo	[20:01:31] :) [20:01:31]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	@dazo	[20:01:37] oh, there is another option [20:01:37]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	daemon	[20:01:54] --ignore-route-push or something akin? [20:01:54]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	@dazo	[20:01:56] you can have it as you had it ... but in the CCD for daemonlan, put 'push-reset' [20:01:56]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	daemon	[20:02:12] ooh thats a nice solution [20:02:12]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	@dazo	[20:02:15] but then you need to add manually all those other pushed options [20:02:15]
2016-10-26 12:54:19	@dazo	[20:02:47] in the 2.4 release, --pull-filter will also come ... but I doubt your ubi-router ships with our 'git master/2.4_alpha' release :-P [20:02:47]

2016-10-26 12:55:45	SviMik	probably you're looking for --tun-mtu
2016-10-26 12:55:56	Kyth	Will that do the right thing if only one client ever sees it?
2016-10-26 12:56:51	Kyth	Using ip(8) to reduce the MTU causes other clients to start having the problem.
2016-10-26 12:57:00	SviMik	if openvpn allows you to use this option on client side - then it should work as expected.
2016-10-26 12:58:19	SviMik	just add "tun-mtu 1234" into client config, and if it starts - then it worked.

2016-10-27 08:58:04	@dazo	BlackBishop: --local
2016-10-27 08:58:19	@dazo	BlackBishop: but, no you can't bind to an interface, only IP
2016-10-27 08:58:37	BlackBishop	( the default gw is through lan, the ppp is as a backup )

2016-10-27 08:59:50	BlackBishop	why would the client bind to all interfaces ?!

2016-10-27 09:01:12	BlackBishop	the server is ok .. the problem is the client in my case :) I want it to go out through a specific PPP interface, not through the default gateway
2016-10-27 09:01:35	@dazo	BlackBishop: your use-case though is a perfect argument to why we should be able to bind to interfaces, though
2016-10-27 09:01:50	@dazo	unfortunately not possible currently
2016-10-27 09:02:04	SviMik	dazo ok, I have a bloat of the shell scripts, which works with init.d. I don't understand the magic inside, because bash is not my language. how do I migrate to systemd?
2016-10-27 09:02:58	@dazo	SviMik: just take a look at the unit files provided in the openvpn source tree (distro/systemd/*.service)
2016-10-27 09:03:39	BlackBishop	dazo: does that mean I have a chance of puting a feature request ? :D
2016-10-27 09:03:49	@dazo	SviMik: the @ in the filename, means that you can do:  systemctl start openvpn-client@CONFIG .... and in the %I and %i you will have CONFIG
2016-10-27 09:04:08	SviMik	dazo I have large init.d scripts which do a lot of magic I don't understand. how can I write systemd unit files without understanding what current init.d files are doing?

2016-10-27 09:25:03	@dazo	SviMik: you have no understanding of what systemd does ... in fact is is immensely relevant for servers.   Like: It can automatically restart services which stops running; it can restrict which capabilities services can have; it can stop services not being used and start them again on-demand; it can also be used to enforce isolation levels for services much stronger than what chroot can provide, etc, etc, etc
2016-10-27 09:26:20	@dazo	SviMik: and it logs far better what happens when you start a service (you have complete log of everything being written to stdout/stderr) .... you can track how long time each service use to start - useful when debugging boot issues

2016-10-27 09:29:16	BlackBishop	dazo: interestingly enough, even using the --local `ip addr li dev ppp0 | grep inet | awk '{print $2}'` param .. it still gets out as via the default gateway on the other interface
2016-10-27 09:29:42	SviMik	all I have googled for - can systemd run a init.d script? and I didn't found an answer...
2016-10-27 09:31:03	@dazo	SviMik: yes it can ... put it under /etc/init.d ... if it is a compliant upstart/sysv init.d script it will work ... then you can choose between using 'service $SERVICE {start,stop,status}' ... or 'systemctl {start,stop,status} $SERVICE'

2016-10-27 09:33:22	und3f	Alright, I've debugged openvpn and found data order for HMAC, it is pretty weird as first goes "Packet-ID" and "Net Time", after it goes back to "Type" and "Session ID" and after the rest of data from "Message Packet-ID"
2016-10-27 09:34:33	@dazo	SviMik: from man systemd:
2016-10-27 09:34:35	@dazo	       systemd is compatible with the SysV init system to
2016-10-27 09:34:35	@dazo	       a large degree: SysV init scripts are supported and

2016-10-27 09:35:32	SviMik	dazo maybe it was introduced later? cause I was googling like a year ago...
2016-10-27 09:36:19	@dazo	SviMik: this I am pretty sure has been in the man pages since RHEL 7.0 ... perhaps even Fedora 18 or so

2016-10-27 17:07:25	@dazo	[19:37:46] systemd is definitely not lacking documentation, in fact it is one of the better documented tools I've ever used [19:37:46]

2016-10-27 17:07:25	@dazo	[19:41:15] BlackBishop: thx! [19:41:15]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	BlackBishop	[19:41:47] if there's any more info needed .. debug logs or anything .. git bisect stuff .. just let me know ! :) [19:41:47]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	@dazo	[19:43:09] BlackBishop: thx!  that's will be helpful .... we're quite focused on getting the 2.4 release train moving forward ... so I can't promise it will be fixed very soon, but when it's tracked it's harder to forget it - then it's all about priorities [19:43:09]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	BlackBishop	[19:44:27] as long as it'll be in the next next release :) [19:44:27]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	@dazo	[19:44:37] hehe [19:44:37]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	BlackBishop	[19:50:43] dazo: altough I think not binding to the ip even if I specified it .. is a problem ! [19:50:43]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	SunOS	[19:51:36] it`s possible to make a tunnel and on the second machine to start a website who to use ip address from the first [19:51:36]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	SunOS	[19:51:37] one [19:51:37]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	slypknot	[19:52:03] BlackBishop: is the server you connect to pushing redirect-gateway ? [19:52:03]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	BlackBishop	[19:53:11] slypknot: nope. I don't even get to connect to it because it's not binding to the right interface :) [19:53:11]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	BlackBishop	[19:53:21] the client I mean [19:53:21]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	slypknot	[19:54:15] you could add a static route to the server via the interface of your choice [19:54:15]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	BlackBishop	[19:55:47] true [19:55:47]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	BlackBishop	[19:57:05] and that fixes binding too .. and the dynamic part [19:57:05]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	slypknot	[20:01:25] if i understand your setup correcty, redirect-gateway will probably break the vpn tho .. but with 2.4 you can --pull-filter ignore things out and hand craft your routing .. it is a pain but it can be made to work [20:01:25]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	BlackBishop	[20:02:44] slypknot: no need for redirect gateway :) the server the client is connecting to will expose an ip and I'll connect through that .. [20:02:44]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	BlackBishop	[20:03:22] all I need is a backup connection out of band to it in case I mess something up routing on lan .. stuff like that [20:03:22]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	slypknot	[20:03:48] it is your own server ? [20:03:48]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	BlackBishop	[20:04:05] 0yep [20:04:05]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	slypknot	[20:04:29] cool .. then it should be easy :) [20:04:29]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	BlackBishop	[20:05:10] yep [20:05:10]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	BlackBishop	[20:07:01] it's just a micro instance in google cloud for this specific backup scenario in case I mess the routers and stuff [20:07:01]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	Vampire0	[23:34:34] Hm, is there no way to teach the OpenVPN client what the username is without writing the password as plaintext into a textfile? [23:34:34]

2016-10-27 22:29:50	BlackBishop	[19:53:11] slypknot: nope. I don't even get to connect to it because it's not binding to the right interface :) [19:53:11]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	BlackBishop	[19:53:21] the client I mean [19:53:21]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	slypknot	[19:54:15] you could add a static route to the server via the interface of your choice [19:54:15]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	BlackBishop	[19:55:47] true [19:55:47]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	BlackBishop	[19:57:05] and that fixes binding too .. and the dynamic part [19:57:05]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	slypknot	[20:01:25] if i understand your setup correcty, redirect-gateway will probably break the vpn tho .. but with 2.4 you can --pull-filter ignore things out and hand craft your routing .. it is a pain but it can be made to work [20:01:25]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	BlackBishop	[20:02:44] slypknot: no need for redirect gateway :) the server the client is connecting to will expose an ip and I'll connect through that .. [20:02:44]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	BlackBishop	[20:03:22] all I need is a backup connection out of band to it in case I mess something up routing on lan .. stuff like that [20:03:22]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	slypknot	[20:03:48] it is your own server ? [20:03:48]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	BlackBishop	[20:04:05] 0yep [20:04:05]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	slypknot	[20:04:29] cool .. then it should be easy :) [20:04:29]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	BlackBishop	[20:05:10] yep [20:05:10]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	BlackBishop	[20:07:01] it's just a micro instance in google cloud for this specific backup scenario in case I mess the routers and stuff [20:07:01]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Vampire0	[23:34:34] Hm, is there no way to teach the OpenVPN client what the username is without writing the password as plaintext into a textfile? [23:34:34]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Vampire0	[23:34:38] It is ok if I type in the password each time, but I'd like it to remember my username [23:34:38]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	cncr04s	[23:39:53] I just use certificates [23:39:53]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	cncr04s	[23:40:06] for identity [23:40:06]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	slypknot	[23:42:41] Vampire0: openvpn does support username in file only and then prompts for a password .. i believe you need to use the latest version 2.4_alpha but it may have been added to 2.3.12 .. sorry con't remember right now .. try it and see for yourself [23:42:41]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Vampire0	[23:45:21] cncr04s, disuss with our IT ;-) [23:45:21]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Vampire0	[23:46:02] slypknot, well, if I only put the username in there I see in the log that it tries to ask the password from stdin and fails of course as I started the GUI client [23:46:02]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Vampire0	[23:46:13] slypknot, is that what will be fixed in 2.4? [23:46:13]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	slypknot	[23:46:42] *is* fixed [23:46:42]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	cncr04s	[23:48:22] https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html has the instructions that I used. [23:48:22]

2016-10-27 22:29:50	Vampire0	[23:48:56] slypknot, well I consider it "is fixed" as soon as 2.4 is released. I don't like using an alpha version of a security critical application like that when accessing our LAN [23:48:56]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Vampire0	[23:49:11] slypknot, do you have any idea when 2.4 will be released? [23:49:11]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	slypknot	[23:49:15] try 2.3.12 [23:49:15]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Vampire0	[23:50:12] slypknot, that's what I downloaded about 6 hours ago and am using right now [23:50:12]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	Vampire0	[23:50:50] cncr04s, good for you, but how does that help me in telling my IT that you thing they are using the Sophos UTM badly? [23:50:50]
2016-10-27 22:29:50	slypknot	[23:50:57] ok .. well I am sure it will be included in 2.3.13, which is due soon [23:50:57]

2016-10-28 01:09:37	qzio__	Hi, I wonder if it's possible to execute a script or similar that runs a bunch of route commands *AFTER* the connection has been established. (openvpn cli)
2016-10-28 01:09:53	qzio__	I found --up but that executes *BEFORE* the routes from the server has been setup up.
2016-10-28 01:10:26	qzio__	My situation: The openvpn server I'm connecting to pushes route commands that eats all my traffic, not just for the ip's I need the VPN for...
2016-10-28 01:10:56	@dazo	Vampire0_: you can just put the username in the auth-file on a single line and no password ... then it should ask for the password each time

2016-10-28 01:25:46	qzio__	so annoying when the server admins can't configure things properly... :(
2016-10-28 01:27:09	@dazo	--route-noexec solves a different problem than what you vaguely described though .... but if you want to set up your own routes by yourself, well, then that's one reasonable approach
2016-10-28 01:28:27	qzio__	dazo: yes; so for my use case where the server tries to eat all my traffic --route-noeexec + setting the routes myself is good-enough-for-me.
2016-10-28 01:30:02	@dazo	qzio__: you can also consider to add an additional --route-up ... which filters out the routes you don't want and allows the other routes to be configured by the server

2016-10-28 01:56:24	@dazo	qzio__: no, inline is not supported for scripts   That could end up in a ugly disaster if you produce configs for more than one platform, as you'd need separate ones for Linux (per distro even), *BSD, OSX/macOS and Windows

2016-10-28 04:22:46	tcpdump	Im trying to figure out why we're getting some duplicate IP addresses, so thats a bummer.
2016-10-28 04:25:14	tcpdump	I have about 2000 remote clients, and we're using 5 OpenVPN servers to handle their connections. We're using an F5 to round robin incoming connections.   Out of the 2000 clients abut 25 of them are duplicated.
2016-10-28 04:31:00		[04:25]
2016-10-28 04:31:45	slypknot	tcpdump: 5 openvpn servers but you only pasted one server config .. do they all use the same server subnet ?
2016-10-28 04:32:21	tcpdump	slypknot: they're identical except for the subnets they assign addresses for.
2016-10-28 04:32:30	tcpdump	and all the servers are duping
2016-10-28 04:32:54	tcpdump	again, with 2k + hosts its not a lot comparatively, but enough to cause issues.
2016-10-28 04:34:25	slypknot	is there anything in the logs about it ?
2016-10-28 04:39:38	slypknot	if i had to guess (which i do) i would say you your round robin is not counting right
2016-10-28 04:39:52	tcpdump	slypknot: theres no errors in the logs.
2016-10-28 04:40:04	tcpdump	Also, checking all the servers none of them are over their host limit.
2016-10-28 04:40:24	tcpdump	So even of the balancer was unevenly distrubuting, as long as none of them are over their subnet limit it shouldnt do this?
2016-10-28 04:41:08	tcpdump	is there a reliable way to show the number of hosts connected?
2016-10-28 04:41:32	slypknot	i guess .. is openvpn  starting the pool over from the beginning or just random ips ?

2016-10-28 04:53:41	slypknot	well some sort of message regarding 'duplictae' i would expect .. but maybe the server has lost count and does not even realise it has done it .. so not really sure what to actually grep for

2016-10-28 05:48:14	@vpnHelper	"man" is (#1) For man pages, see http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/manuals/, or (#2) the man pages are your friend!, or (#3) Protip: you can search the manpage for a specific --option (with dashes) to find it quicker

2016-10-28 05:49:08	tcpdump	Im on 2.3.2
2016-10-28 05:49:14	tcpdump	Any change 2.4 could help?
2016-10-28 05:49:22	@dazo	tcpdump: regarding same CN ... as long as you use --duplicate-cn, it should be fine (not ideal, but for some use cases it's reasonable to use that approach)
2016-10-28 05:50:17	@dazo	tcpdump: I'd rather recommend 2.3.12, if you're aiming for stable stuff .... 2.4_alpha2 is, well, an alpha release - so it might not be as solid - even though 2.4 may be fine for quite many

2016-10-28 06:48:35	mrpops2ko	hey guys, is it possible to invert the logic of openvpn client, so that it routes only specific routes I give it, rather than everything?
2016-10-28 06:54:00		[06:48]
2016-10-28 06:55:53	@dazo	!redirect
2016-10-28 06:55:54	@vpnHelper	"redirect" is (#1) to make all inet traffic flow through the vpn, you will need --redirect-gateway (see !def1), as well as IP forwarding (see !ipforward) and NAT (see !nat) enabled on the server., or (#2) you may need to use a different dns server when redirecting gateway, see !dns or !pushdns, or (#3) if using ipv6 try: route-ipv6 2000::/3, or (#4) Handy troubleshooting flowchart:
2016-10-28 06:55:55	@vpnHelper	http://pekster.sdf.org/misc/redirect.png
2016-10-28 06:55:58	@dazo	mrpops2ko: ^^^
2016-10-28 06:56:22	@dazo	mrpops2ko: redirecting everything is NOT the default, it comes from the --redirect-gateway option
2016-10-28 06:57:10	mrpops2ko	so if i drop that, no traffic will be routed, and then use the route command to push to the vpn?
2016-10-28 06:57:34	@dazo	right
2016-10-28 06:58:01	@dazo	or rather you add --route to your config, declaring which subnets you want to be routed over the VPN
2016-10-28 06:59:42	mrpops2ko	aight cool going to play around with that then

2016-10-28 12:43:06	slypknot	but you throw in a third party balancer and well .. who knows what they are doing

2016-10-28 13:35:58	@vpnHelper	"client-connect" is --client-connect <script>, runs script on client connection. This can be useful for generating firewall rules dynamicly, or for assigning static ips. This can do anything that a ccd (see !ccd) entry can do, but dynamicly... to use it that way, you should write your dynamic ccd commands to the file named by $1.

2016-10-28 13:39:08	wallbroken	slypknot, i'm reading about zmap way of attack, it sends an initial openvpn handshake to port scan the service. and botnet uses this way to attack
2016-10-28 13:39:26	MacGyver	wallbroken: But I figure nothing I say will convince you to replace that thing.
2016-10-28 13:39:31	slypknot	MacGyver: sorry i forgot about heartblead
2016-10-28 13:40:03	MacGyver	slypknot: He specifically asked about heartbleed. ta.key mitigates that *somewhat* if you trust all your users, but seriously...
2016-10-28 13:40:23	wallbroken	MacGyver, i contacted the openwrt developers, they said to me to buy a serial console, connect to the crap router, and get the log to figure out why newer releases won't work, then they will fix the issue
2016-10-28 13:40:47	slypknot	wallbroken: heartblead is THE most serious security expliot i ever heard of .. you MUST upgrade to a version of openvpn which is not heartblead exploiable
2016-10-28 13:41:32	slypknot	MacGyver: my apologies .. of course you are correct
2016-10-28 13:41:36	MacGyver	wallbroken: And because you feel like doing none of those things, nor upgrading to something less crappy, you make the internet a little less secure for everyone. Thanks!
2016-10-28 13:42:16	wallbroken	MacGyver, i'm worried about this problem since many time
2016-10-28 13:42:24	wallbroken	and i will fix it in some way

2016-10-28 13:44:44	wallbroken	yes i remember about that
2016-10-28 13:44:49	slypknot	openvpn WAS vulnerable (until they fixed it)
2016-10-28 13:45:15	slypknot	but you must upgrade .. or just accept that you are not secure

2016-10-28 13:46:42	slypknot	at least keep up with the expected level

2016-10-28 13:54:48	slypknot	the overhead for --tls-auth is so small that i (personally) believe a vpn works better with it
2016-10-28 13:56:03	slypknot	the server can instantly drop any packet that does not have a suitable --tls-auth HMAC

2016-10-28 13:56:39	slypknot	that does not preclude what can happen with a MITM attack such as heartblead

2016-10-28 13:57:33	MacGyver	The heartbleed document pretty clearly states that if tls auth is used, an attacker can exploit it only if they have the tls auth key already.
2016-10-28 13:57:50	slypknot	MITM ..

2016-10-28 13:58:03	MacGyver	Heartbleed isn't a MITM.
2016-10-28 13:58:04	slypknot	not a specific attack on either end

2016-10-28 13:58:24	slypknot	heartblead was about extracting keys on data xfer
2016-10-28 13:58:33	MacGyver	Yes, but not by a MITM.
2016-10-28 13:58:38	MacGyver	By a client.
2016-10-28 13:58:41	MacGyver	Any client.
2016-10-28 13:58:49	slypknot	it is so clever i am not sure i fully understand it
2016-10-28 13:58:59	MacGyver	So if you preclude your clients to be those with a TLS auth key, you mitigate heartbleed to some extent.
2016-10-28 13:59:28	MacGyver	Heartbleed is basically a remotely exploitable buffer overflow that can be used to extract material about the server secret key.
2016-10-28 14:00:00	MacGyver	But remotely exploitable *by the connected client*.

2016-10-28 14:00:24	MacGyver	Also works the other way.
2016-10-28 14:00:24		[14:00]
2016-10-28 14:00:29	MacGyver	A server can exploit the client.
2016-10-28 14:01:05	MacGyver	In that sense, it's a much stronger attack than one where you need to be a MITM.
2016-10-28 14:01:40	MacGyver	But that also makes mitigation somewhat easier because if you simply limit your set of servers/clients to trusted ones, you shouldn't be affected.
2016-10-28 14:02:01	MacGyver	However, that's absolutely no excuse for sticking with 3-year-old critical-vulnerability-containing software.

2016-10-28 14:23:01	@vpnHelper	"ccd" is (#1) entries that are basically included into server.conf, but only for the specified client based on common-name. use --client-config-dir <dir> to enable it, then put the config options for the client in <dir>/common-name, or (#2) the ccd file is parsed each time the client connects.

2016-10-28 14:43:50	MacGyver	Yes, it's a lot more complex than that but it boils down to incorrect buffer and string handling.
2016-10-28 14:45:20	MacGyver	Basically, the client would send a short string to the server and claim it's a long one, the server would allocate a large buffer for the long one without zeroing the memory, and copy the short string at the front of the buffer. Then, when the heartbeat was replied, the entire buffer was sent to the client.
2016-10-28 14:46:01	MacGyver	Or some such steps.
2016-10-28 14:46:12	MacGyver	Been a while.

The Linux router is running NAT for a local network, and this router is able to access the OpenVPN server's public-facing (public IP) ports with no problem. The issue is that the NAT clients (that have NAT

So obviously OpenVPN uses UDP natively (and preferably), but the way I understand it is that when you have your ping time set to 30, for example, the client (or server?) will send a "ping" of sorts (UDP packet) to let the other know its still present. If you have your ping-timeout set to 120, for example,
2016-10-28 15:49:51		[15:49]
2016-10-28 15:49:51	tcpdump	then after 3 pings the server would close the binding.

2016-10-28 18:37:14	@krzee	tannercollin: you can only forward the port to a single client, so i suggest using a static vpn ip, alternately you may dynamically assign firewall rules using a learn-address script

2016-10-28 18:38:01	@vpnHelper	"linportforward" is (#1) to forward port 80 tcp to a vpn client, use this (replacing <SERVERIP> with the real ip of the server, and <VPNIP> with the clients VPN ip), or (#2) iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -d <SERVERIP> -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to <VPNIP>, or (#3) iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
2016-10-28 18:38:15	tannercollin	Yeah, that's fine. My ISP doesn't let me forward ports 80 and 443, so I am connecting my media server to my VPN and have it forward the ports through there.
2016-10-28 18:42:35	@krzee	!static
2016-10-28 18:42:35	@vpnHelper	"static" is (#1) use --ifconfig-push in a ccd entry for a static ip for the vpn client, or (#2) example in net30 (default): ifconfig-push 10.8.0.6 10.8.0.5 example in subnet (see !topology) or tap (see !tunortap): ifconfig-push 10.8.0.5 255.255.255.0, or (#3) also see !ccd and !iporder, or (#4) with static IPs, limit your --ifconfig-pool to exclude the static range, or (#5) See also: !addressing
2016-10-28 18:42:44	wallbroken	krzee, what "learn address script" does?
2016-10-28 18:42:44		[18:42]

2016-10-28 18:50:00		[18:44]
2016-10-28 18:52:59	@krzee	no, openvpn assigns the tun ip
2016-10-28 18:53:24	@krzee	if you have an entire subnet routed to you then you may assign the subnet directly in --server
2016-10-28 18:53:32	@krzee	but if you dont know, then i am sure you dont
2016-10-28 18:53:49	tannercollin	okay, I'm looking at the ifconfig-push flag. I'm confused about the remote-netmask part. what should I set it to?
2016-10-28 18:54:08	@krzee	are you using tun, and topology subnet?

2016-10-28 18:55:00	tannercollin	Yes, using tun and these subnet settings: server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0
2016-10-28 18:55:28	tannercollin	the example in the config has this: ifconfig-push 10.9.0.1 10.9.0.2
2016-10-28 18:55:41	@krzee	thats for net30
2016-10-28 18:55:48	tannercollin	10.9.0.2 is the remote-netmask and it doesn't look very much like a netmask.
2016-10-28 18:55:49	@krzee	if you have topology subnet then it would be like
2016-10-28 18:56:08	@krzee	ifconfig-push 10.8.0.250 255.255.255.0
2016-10-28 18:56:16	wallbroken	tannercollin, look for "static routing"
2016-10-28 18:56:18	@krzee	inside a ccd entry for the client
2016-10-28 18:56:20	@krzee	!ccd
2016-10-28 18:56:21	@vpnHelper	"ccd" is (#1) entries that are basically included into server.conf, but only for the specified client based on common-name. use --client-config-dir <dir> to enable it, then put the config options for the client in <dir>/common-name, or (#2) the ccd file is parsed each time the client connects.
2016-10-28 18:56:58	tannercollin	Ahh, I guess I am using net30 right now
2016-10-28 18:57:38	tannercollin	Yeah, I'm editing my ccd right now, but I don't know what to put for the second parameter for ifconfig-push

2016-10-28 22:16:45	@krzee	[04:37:14] tannercollin: you can only forward the port to a single client, so i suggest using a static vpn ip, alternately you may dynamically assign firewall rules using a learn-address script [04:37:14]

2016-10-28 22:16:45	@krzee	[04:54:08] are you using tun, and topology subnet? [04:54:08]
2016-10-28 22:16:45	tannercollin	[04:55:00] Yes, using tun and these subnet settings: server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0 [04:55:00]
2016-10-28 22:16:45	tannercollin	[04:55:28] the example in the config has this: ifconfig-push 10.9.0.1 10.9.0.2 [04:55:28]

2016-10-29 07:42:56	iq	Is it normal for OpenVPN to show two processes when using PAM authentication? I just switched from script based to PAM plugin and now I am seeing two processes. One is under user-ID openvpn and the other one is under root.

2016-10-29 11:14:11	chancey	I tried to mangle the packets and bump the TTL but that didn't seem to help either
2016-10-29 11:14:56	SviMik	chancey for multicast you need tap.

2016-10-29 11:21:23	SviMik	I'm not sure now...
2016-10-29 11:21:25	chancey	@dazo that's what I thought and why I came here for a more direct answer that I cannot seem to find otherwise.
2016-10-29 11:24:26	SviMik	dazo for correct multicast packet forwarding the openvpn must understand IGMP, no?
2016-10-29 11:24:26		[11:24]
2016-10-29 11:24:33	SviMik	I doubt it do...
2016-10-29 11:25:03	SviMik	even in routers there are special IGMP plugins for that
2016-10-29 11:26:16	@dazo	yeah, you might need some IGMP support ... but IGMP is just another protocol as ICMP, TCP and UDP ... so that should pass over the TUN interface ... I don't recall we do any filtering on those protocols
2016-10-29 11:28:09	SviMik	dazo even it I push a multicast packet into tun interface, how openvpn knows to which clients it shall forward such a packet?
2016-10-29 11:28:14	chancey	fyi, both routers do support and properly handle IGMP independently.
2016-10-29 11:28:20	SviMik	*if
2016-10-29 11:29:15	chancey	(for their respective LANs at least)
2016-10-29 11:29:43	@dazo	SviMik: good point ... I honestly haven't looked into the routing layer, so I don't know
2016-10-29 11:30:56	@dazo	chancey: would be great if you can test this well and report back ... with some tcpdump of the TUN device on both client and server
2016-10-29 11:30:59	SviMik	I guess it will not work, because it has a special group IP as destination, and such packet will not reach any client at all
2016-10-29 11:31:08	@dazo	yeah
2016-10-29 11:31:23	SviMik	because there is no any client with this IP
2016-10-29 11:31:41	@dazo	I wonder though, if you add --route with the group IP ... that should work
2016-10-29 11:31:44	SviMik	and without special support, it will simply drop it
2016-10-29 11:32:32	SviMik	dazo can you route a group IP to multiple vpn clients simultaneously?
2016-10-29 11:32:45	SviMik	I guess it's not how routing works
2016-10-29 11:33:13	@dazo	right ... I didn't think of multiple clients right now
2016-10-29 11:34:19	chancey	This connection will only ever have one client, but probably that doesn't matter
2016-10-29 11:35:37	SviMik	but, as I remember, the multicast has a workaround to pass swithes - it has broadcast MAC, so swith that can't understand IGMP will simply forward it to all ports. the same should do tap.
2016-10-29 11:36:23	SviMik	so tap will have opposite problem - ALL clients will receive it :)
2016-10-29 11:36:29	@dazo	right
2016-10-29 11:36:31	chancey	@dazo: I can capture the traffic on both ends, but it just looks like two independent IGMP conversations
2016-10-29 11:36:32	@dazo	r
2016-10-29 11:36:40	SviMik	(but it will work, at least)
2016-10-29 11:36:43	chancey	ooh, that would be OK for my setup
2016-10-29 11:37:40	@dazo	TAP does have other challenges as well .... but for mcast, it might be the functional solution as of now
2016-10-29 11:39:01	SviMik	dazo I guess it is quite possible to add IGMP support to openvpn for tap, so it could route the iptv traffic correctly (not flooding to all ports, as it does right now)

2016-10-29 11:39:43	@dazo	Should be possible to add that support for TUN as well
2016-10-29 11:39:43		[11:39]
2016-10-29 11:39:55	@dazo	it just needs to know what to look for and how it should distribute/route the packets
2016-10-29 11:39:56	SviMik	dazo but I'm not sure, is it even possible that such patch could be accepted?
2016-10-29 11:40:16	@dazo	I think that would be a reasonable patch to consider ... IGMP is essential
2016-10-29 11:42:18	SviMik	dazo I have already created a broadcast filter for tap (with peers whitelist), and arp filter to sort arp requests out. but never published it, because it's quite specific case
2016-10-29 11:42:53	@dazo	broadcast/arp filtering .... that would be the job of ebtables, wouldn't it?
2016-10-29 11:43:45	SviMik	dazo not really. if a packet come from remote client - it will be forwarded to the host AND to all other clients connected
2016-10-29 11:43:54	@dazo	The challenge with IGMP support patches would be to get the right people to review it .... but file a trac ticket on IGMP support, and describe a path forward to patch openvpn ... and there might be enough positive feedback to really consider doing it
2016-10-29 11:44:54	SviMik	dazo ebtables has control over the traffic which goes from the openvpn's tap adapter, but not which is routed inside openvpn itself
2016-10-29 11:46:51	@dazo	SviMik: using --client-to-client?
2016-10-29 11:47:00	SviMik	sure
2016-10-29 11:47:52	SviMik	but I also use packet filter, so I have full control over traffic between clients
2016-10-29 11:48:03	@dazo	SviMik: I thought that was a TUN only option ... I might remember wrong .... but the built-in PF should be able to kill broadcast traffic though
2016-10-29 11:48:27	SviMik	the pf will kill all p2p traffic
2016-10-29 11:48:49	@dazo	http://backreference.org/2010/06/18/openvpns-built-in-packet-filter/  << this guy used to be quite active in our community, so I trust this ... even discussed this stuff with him
2016-10-29 11:48:50	SviMik	it doesn't separate broadcast, multicast, etc

2016-10-29 12:25:07	@dazo	[21:37:40] TAP does have other challenges as well .... but for mcast, it might be the functional solution as of now [21:37:40]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	SviMik	[21:39:01] dazo I guess it is quite possible to add IGMP support to openvpn for tap, so it could route the iptv traffic correctly (not flooding to all ports, as it does right now) [21:39:01]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	@dazo	[21:39:43] Should be possible to add that support for TUN as well [21:39:43]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	@dazo	[21:39:55] it just needs to know what to look for and how it should distribute/route the packets [21:39:55]

2016-10-29 12:25:07	@dazo	[21:40:16] I think that would be a reasonable patch to consider ... IGMP is essential [21:40:16]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	SviMik	[21:42:18] dazo I have already created a broadcast filter for tap (with peers whitelist), and arp filter to sort arp requests out. but never published it, because it's quite specific case [21:42:18]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	@dazo	[21:42:53] broadcast/arp filtering .... that would be the job of ebtables, wouldn't it? [21:42:53]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	SviMik	[21:43:45] dazo not really. if a packet come from remote client - it will be forwarded to the host AND to all other clients connected [21:43:45]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	@dazo	[21:43:54] The challenge with IGMP support patches would be to get the right people to review it .... but file a trac ticket on IGMP support, and describe a path forward to patch openvpn ... and there might be enough positive feedback to really consider doing it [21:43:54]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	SviMik	[21:44:54] dazo ebtables has control over the traffic which goes from the openvpn's tap adapter, but not which is routed inside openvpn itself [21:44:54]

2016-10-29 12:25:07	SviMik	[21:47:00] sure [21:47:00]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	SviMik	[21:47:52] but I also use packet filter, so I have full control over traffic between clients [21:47:52]
2016-10-29 12:25:07	@dazo	[21:48:03] SviMik: I thought that was a TUN only option ... I might remember wrong .... but the built-in PF should be able to kill broadcast traffic though [21:48:03]

2016-10-29 18:39:20	velocity11	[00:49:50] Hi everyone [00:49:50]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	velocity11	[00:50:40] Is it in any way possible, given a certain OpenVPN server IP, to find out a list of IP addresses it can assign? [00:50:40]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	SviMik	[01:06:45] velocity11 no. ask the server administrator [01:06:45]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	velocity11	[01:14:19] @SviMik any way to brute force different IPs? I have no idea how the protocol works but I'm trying to build a list of IPs from a VPN host that I do not own yet can access [01:14:19]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	SviMik	[01:31:12] velocity11 if you can connect to the server as a client, you can try nmap. but most servers has client-to-client traffic blocked, so this may not work. and even if it works - 1) you can only get the list of connected clients, and still no idea where the IP range ends 2) you can hit IP addresses of network behind the server, which has nothing to do with your question. [01:31:12]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	velocity11	[01:41:53] Thanks @SviMik, that does shed some light [01:41:53]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	spyke581	[02:23:33] Trying to setup an OpenVPN server on pfsense but my client does not connect to the Server from the internet. it will connect from inside the LAN though. I have confirmed that the interface is set to WAN and the automatic firewall rules are enabled. [02:23:33]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	subzero79	[02:39:11] spyke581 do you have a rule in the wan interface for the server port? [02:39:11]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	spyke581	[02:40:09] subzero79 yes [02:40:09]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	subzero79	[02:40:56] then increase verbosity on the server and see if the logs show the client connecting [02:40:56]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	subzero79	[02:41:01] the server logs [02:41:01]

2016-10-29 18:39:20	@vpnHelper	[04:37:42] "timeout" is if you see TLS Error: TLS key negotiation failed to occur within 60 seconds (check your network connectivity) then your problem is likely one of the following: either the server isnt running, your client is connecting to the wrong ip/port/protocol, the server's firewall/nat has an issue, or one of the ISPs blocks it [04:37:42]

2016-10-29 23:10:14	@dazo	[21:39:43] Should be possible to add that support for TUN as well [21:39:43]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	@dazo	[21:39:55] it just needs to know what to look for and how it should distribute/route the packets [21:39:55]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	SviMik	[21:39:56] dazo but I'm not sure, is it even possible that such patch could be accepted? [21:39:56]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	@dazo	[21:40:16] I think that would be a reasonable patch to consider ... IGMP is essential [21:40:16]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	SviMik	[21:42:18] dazo I have already created a broadcast filter for tap (with peers whitelist), and arp filter to sort arp requests out. but never published it, because it's quite specific case [21:42:18]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	@dazo	[21:42:53] broadcast/arp filtering .... that would be the job of ebtables, wouldn't it? [21:42:53]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	SviMik	[21:43:45] dazo not really. if a packet come from remote client - it will be forwarded to the host AND to all other clients connected [21:43:45]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	@dazo	[21:43:54] The challenge with IGMP support patches would be to get the right people to review it .... but file a trac ticket on IGMP support, and describe a path forward to patch openvpn ... and there might be enough positive feedback to really consider doing it [21:43:54]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	SviMik	[21:44:54] dazo ebtables has control over the traffic which goes from the openvpn's tap adapter, but not which is routed inside openvpn itself [21:44:54]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	@dazo	[21:46:51] SviMik: using --client-to-client? [21:46:51]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	SviMik	[21:47:00] sure [21:47:00]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	SviMik	[21:47:52] but I also use packet filter, so I have full control over traffic between clients [21:47:52]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	@dazo	[21:48:03] SviMik: I thought that was a TUN only option ... I might remember wrong .... but the built-in PF should be able to kill broadcast traffic though [21:48:03]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	SviMik	[21:48:27] the pf will kill all p2p traffic [21:48:27]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	@dazo	[21:48:49] http://backreference.org/2010/06/18/openvpns-built-in-packet-filter/  << this guy used to be quite active in our community, so I trust this ... even discussed this stuff with him [21:48:49]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	SviMik	[21:48:49] it doesn't separate broadcast, multicast, etc [21:48:49]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	SviMik	[21:50:47] dazo I use pf since 2011, and even found a bug there https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/ticket/163 [21:50:47]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	@vpnHelper	[21:50:48] Title: #163 (Segfault in PF) – OpenVPN Community (at community.openvpn.net) [21:50:48]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	@dazo	[21:53:32] right ... that got fixed and released quite a long time ago .... I just barely remember this [21:53:32]

2016-10-29 23:10:14	velocity11	[00:49:50] Hi everyone [00:49:50]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	velocity11	[00:50:40] Is it in any way possible, given a certain OpenVPN server IP, to find out a list of IP addresses it can assign? [00:50:40]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	SviMik	[01:06:45] velocity11 no. ask the server administrator [01:06:45]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	velocity11	[01:14:19] @SviMik any way to brute force different IPs? I have no idea how the protocol works but I'm trying to build a list of IPs from a VPN host that I do not own yet can access [01:14:19]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	SviMik	[01:31:12] velocity11 if you can connect to the server as a client, you can try nmap. but most servers has client-to-client traffic blocked, so this may not work. and even if it works - 1) you can only get the list of connected clients, and still no idea where the IP range ends 2) you can hit IP addresses of network behind the server, which has nothing to do with your question. [01:31:12]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	velocity11	[01:41:53] Thanks @SviMik, that does shed some light [01:41:53]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	spyke581	[02:23:33] Trying to setup an OpenVPN server on pfsense but my client does not connect to the Server from the internet. it will connect from inside the LAN though. I have confirmed that the interface is set to WAN and the automatic firewall rules are enabled. [02:23:33]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	subzero79	[02:39:11] spyke581 do you have a rule in the wan interface for the server port? [02:39:11]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	spyke581	[02:40:09] subzero79 yes [02:40:09]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	subzero79	[02:40:56] then increase verbosity on the server and see if the logs show the client connecting [02:40:56]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	subzero79	[02:41:01] the server logs [02:41:01]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	subzero79	[02:42:09] also make sure allow all rule in the vpn interface [02:42:09]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	sfrique	[03:31:07] hello, does anyone know what this error means?  "Sat Oct 29 14:08:34 2016 write to TUN/TAP : Input/output error (code=5)"   ARchlinux connecting to openwrt using TAP when using TUN it works. [03:31:07]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	@krzee	[04:37:39] spyke581: [04:37:39]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	@krzee	[04:37:41] !timeout [04:37:41]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	@vpnHelper	[04:37:42] "timeout" is if you see TLS Error: TLS key negotiation failed to occur within 60 seconds (check your network connectivity) then your problem is likely one of the following: either the server isnt running, your client is connecting to the wrong ip/port/protocol, the server's firewall/nat has an issue, or one of the ISPs blocks it [04:37:42]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	@krzee	[04:38:13] sfrique: is openwrt also set to tap when trying? [04:38:13]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	sfrique	[04:39:00] krzee: yes. It it the server, so always on [04:39:00]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	sfrique	[04:39:05] up* [04:39:05]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	@krzee	[04:43:21] right but you can only use tun with tun and tap with tap [04:43:21]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	@krzee	[04:43:33] if the server is running tun you must connect using tun [04:43:33]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	@krzee	[04:43:38] !tunortap [04:43:38]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	@vpnHelper	[04:43:39] "tunortap" is (#1) you ONLY want tap if you need to pass layer2 traffic over the vpn (traffic destined for a MAC address). If you are using IP traffic you want tun., or (#2) and if your reason for wanting tap is windows shares, see !wins or use DNS, or (#3) remember layer2 has no security, arp poisoning works over tap vpns, or (#4) lan gaming? use tap!, or (#5) Normal Android/iOS devices (not [04:43:39]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	@vpnHelper	[04:43:40] rooted/jailbroken) support only tun [04:43:40]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	sfrique	[04:49:33] krzee: i have two vpn servers. one with TUN and one TAP [04:49:33]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	sfrique	[04:49:44] the TAP is not working, the TUN is working [04:49:44]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	sfrique	[04:50:17] when using client TAP to TAP (i get that error) [04:50:17]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	sfrique	[04:50:37] when using client TUN to TUN it works.. they listen on different ports [04:50:37]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	sfrique	[04:51:10] first i tried only with tap, and did not work, so i went to try using tun just to make sure it was working (the keys and etc) and it was [04:51:10]

2016-10-31 00:23:12	@dazo	[10:13:52] AikiLinux: if you're looking at the Access Server, then things can look somewhat odd.  OpenVPN can be split into a few pieces.  The OpenVPN "Core" is 100% open source.  The Access Server is a product which builds upon the "Core", which requires a license [10:13:52]
2016-10-31 00:23:12	tomodachi	[10:14:26] AikiLinux: what features is it that you require? [10:14:26]
2016-10-31 00:23:12	@dazo	[10:14:47] You can manage to get very well functional VPN tunnels with both alternatives.  But the Access Server has an improved management user interface on top of the OpenVPN core [10:14:47]
2016-10-31 00:23:12	tomodachi	[10:14:57] if its just a subset of the access server there can be some addons you can find on top on the free openVPN that can be enough [10:14:57]
2016-10-31 00:23:12	AikiLinux	[10:15:41] we want to build a vpn solution to out users for connecting to the AWS servers [10:15:41]
2016-10-31 00:23:12	AikiLinux	[10:16:14] so we are looking at openvpn as it was the most recommended solution [10:16:14]
2016-10-31 00:23:12	tomodachi	[10:16:31] we use openVPN for that in my company [10:16:31]
2016-10-31 00:23:12	AikiLinux	[10:17:27] with how many users and is the manageability of users and accounts easy ? can it be kept in source control ? [10:17:27]
2016-10-31 00:23:12	tomodachi	[10:18:18] maybe we have 50 concurrent sessions in our solution [10:18:18]
2016-10-31 00:23:12	tomodachi	[10:18:40] but how many you can have mostly depends on your hardware not the software [10:18:40]
2016-10-31 00:23:12	AikiLinux	[10:19:32] did you have to setup and SSH forwarding or routing rules for accessing servers over ssh ? [10:19:32]
2016-10-31 00:23:12	tomodachi	[10:20:23] openvpn in its default state us a routing VPN [10:20:23]
2016-10-31 00:23:12	tomodachi	[10:20:35] it routes traffic there is no firwalling [10:20:35]
2016-10-31 00:23:12	tomodachi	[10:21:02] the vpn server pushes routes to each client from its config [10:21:02]
2016-10-31 00:23:12	AikiLinux	[10:21:34] and the SG groups for other servers need to know the IP  of the VPN server ? or one just uses the internal IP? [10:21:34]
2016-10-31 00:23:12	AikiLinux	[10:21:46] and if i want to reach servers in other regions ? [10:21:46]
2016-10-31 00:23:12	tomodachi	[10:22:07] AikiLinux: since one instance your VPC will be the VPN server [10:22:07]
2016-10-31 00:23:12	tomodachi	[10:22:29] that you route your client traffic through [10:22:29]
2016-10-31 00:23:12	***	Playback Complete.
2016-10-31 00:23:19	tomodachi	conceptually its the same as if you had a instance in your VPC that could connect to other instances , or regions or whatever
2016-10-31 00:23:19	tomodachi	(only that its routed traffic  from another network)

2016-10-31 01:31:10	tomodachi	[10:20:35] it routes traffic there is no firwalling [10:20:35]
2016-10-31 01:31:10	tomodachi	[10:21:02] the vpn server pushes routes to each client from its config [10:21:02]
2016-10-31 01:31:10	AikiLinux	[10:21:34] and the SG groups for other servers need to know the IP  of the VPN server ? or one just uses the internal IP? [10:21:34]
2016-10-31 01:31:10	AikiLinux	[10:21:46] and if i want to reach servers in other regions ? [10:21:46]
2016-10-31 01:31:10	tomodachi	[10:22:07] AikiLinux: since one instance your VPC will be the VPN server [10:22:07]
2016-10-31 01:31:10	tomodachi	[10:22:29] that you route your client traffic through [10:22:29]
2016-10-31 01:31:10	tomodachi	[10:22:53] conceptually its the same as if you had a instance in your VPC that could connect to other instances , or regions or whatever [10:22:53]
2016-10-31 01:31:10	tomodachi	[10:23:01] (only that its routed traffic  from another network) [10:23:01]

2016-10-31 01:31:10	@dazo	[10:26:08] AikiLinux: with OpenVPN AS, you can integrate it with your existing user management system (at least LDAP, might be more) [10:26:08]
2016-10-31 01:31:10	tomodachi	[10:27:19] you can of course integrate with LDAP or existing account management with the totally free openVPN as well  , but  might require more technical expertise [10:27:19]
2016-10-31 01:31:10	AikiLinux	[10:27:19] thanks dazo, i looked at it , and that was where my initial confusion started about licenses and pricing [10:27:19]
2016-10-31 01:31:10	@dazo	[10:27:30] ahh right! [10:27:30]
2016-10-31 01:31:10	@dazo	[10:29:50] AikiLinux: You can, as tomodachi says, integrate the open source version too ... but it will require much more fiddling .... OpenVPN AS is the more "automated" approach, which simplifies the configuration management part ... The end result can be the same, but how long and complicated the path to reach that goal will be different (not saying AS is simpler in all cases, but in may it will be) [10:29:50]

2016-10-31 02:15:15	gerforce	hello, i have a problem. I recently configured an openvpn server on my VPS. And i use it to tunnel all my traffic for accessing websites like google. Everything worked fine until these days. I cann't connect to my openvpn server. I didn't change any configurations. And i got error messages:

2016-10-31 02:18:33	@ecrist	ahhh
2016-10-31 02:18:43	gerforce	why this would happen, i didn't change anything. You mean check the client side log? How? Can you be more specific, i am quite new to openvpn
2016-10-31 02:19:46	@plaisthos	gerforce: lifetime of a certificate expired most likely
2016-10-31 02:19:58	@plaisthos	check the log instead of guessing
2016-10-31 02:20:04	tomodachi	or maybe your clocks of server & client are skewed?
2016-10-31 02:22:23	Rienzilla	Hi there. Question on addressing. Suppose I have a local network A (192.168.1.0/24). An openvpn tun server is located in this network. I want my vpn clients to receive addresses within a part of the 192.168.1.0/24 range. Currently, I managed to set this up by giving the network clients addresses in another range (say, 10.0.123.0/24) ...
2016-10-31 02:22:39	Rienzilla	and use scripts to give the clients also an address within 192.168.1.0/24, while adding a /32 route to that address over the tun interface on the vpn server and enabling proxy-arp. This does work, but seems a little iffy. Can openvpn directly hand out addresses in the 192.168.1.0/24 range in this scenario, and what address should I use for the server side endpoint of the tunnel?
2016-10-31 02:24:03	gerforce	plaisthos: where does the client side log reside?

2016-10-31 13:42:03	gerforce	[13:09:16] i couldn't access openvpn.net without VPN. It's been blocked from China [13:09:16]

2016-10-31 13:42:03	@plaisthos	[13:09:35] oh from CHina [13:09:35]
2016-10-31 13:42:03	@plaisthos	[13:09:48] your great firewall might also just block openvpn [13:09:48]
2016-10-31 13:42:03	gerforce	[13:10:19] plaisthos: that's why i changed the standard port 1194 [13:10:19]
2016-10-31 13:42:03	@plaisthos	[13:11:15] and maybe now the GFW will do fingerprint and also catch you on another port [13:11:15]
2016-10-31 13:42:03	gerforce	[13:12:22] plaisthos: what if i rebuild the service from scrach? [13:12:22]
2016-10-31 13:42:03	DArqueBishop	[13:12:30] gerforce: it may not matter what port you use. Part of me wants to say the GFW uses deep packet inspection to recognize and block OpenVPN traffic. [13:12:30]
2016-10-31 13:42:03	@plaisthos	[13:13:04] gerforce: I am by no means an expert about the GFW [13:13:04]
2016-10-31 13:42:03	gerforce	[13:13:39] plaisthos: so i should just give up on openvpn because of the GFW? [13:13:39]

2016-10-31 16:21:04	@plaisthos	[13:09:48] your great firewall might also just block openvpn [13:09:48]
2016-10-31 16:21:04	gerforce	[13:10:19] plaisthos: that's why i changed the standard port 1194 [13:10:19]
2016-10-31 16:21:04	@plaisthos	[13:11:15] and maybe now the GFW will do fingerprint and also catch you on another port [13:11:15]
2016-10-31 16:21:04	gerforce	[13:12:22] plaisthos: what if i rebuild the service from scrach? [13:12:22]
2016-10-31 16:21:04	DArqueBishop	[13:12:30] gerforce: it may not matter what port you use. Part of me wants to say the GFW uses deep packet inspection to recognize and block OpenVPN traffic. [13:12:30]

I only have one interesting problem: hTTPS connections over die VPN sometimes/often hang oder return 503. If the connection is established once, subsequent navigating the website works just fine. Also, it is often necessary to connect more than once when attempting to establish a ssh connection over this VPN. Otherwise it will al
2016-10-31 16:30:59	ppd	so "hang". Bare HTTP is absolutely wonderful, I tried playing around with the mtu settings (e.g. tun-mtu: 1300 on client) but couldn't achieve anything significant. The problem is quite specific, so maybe someone could me a few hints where to look at! Thanks a lot in advance

2016-11-01 07:12:07	@krzee	marco208: ^
2016-11-01 07:13:00	marco208	Yes, I'm on TCP
2016-11-01 07:13:36	@krzee	did you also try tcp-nodelay?
2016-11-01 07:13:37	DArqueBishop	marco208: any particular reason? UDP is better for OpenVPN.
2016-11-01 07:13:42	@krzee	and did you try with udp?
2016-11-01 07:13:51	marco208	Since the connection at our office is so unstable we hit 30% packetloss average...
2016-11-01 07:14:05	marco208	(without VPN)
2016-11-01 07:14:05	@krzee	udp is better for tunneling tcp in general
2016-11-01 07:14:07	@krzee	oh dude
2016-11-01 07:14:10	@krzee	thats the problem
2016-11-01 07:14:15	@krzee	tcp in tcp cant handle packetloss
2016-11-01 07:14:20	@krzee	!tcp
2016-11-01 07:14:21	@vpnHelper	"tcp" is (#1) Sometimes you cannot avoid tunneling over tcp, but if you can avoid it, DO. http://sites.inka.de/~bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html Why TCP Over TCP Is A Bad Idea., or (#2) http://www.openvpn.net/papers/BLUG-talk/14.html for a presentation by James Yonan (OpenVPN lead developer), or (#3) if you must use tcp, you likely want --tcp-nodelay
2016-11-01 07:14:22	marco208	No, I'm home now :)
2016-11-01 07:14:37	marco208	stable 100Mbit ping 5ms to 8.8.8.8
2016-11-01 07:15:21	@krzee	8.8.8.8 doesnt matter, but i assume its good to the vpn server as well
2016-11-01 07:15:31	marco208	tcp-nodelay -> I wrote it down, I will check this tomorrow.
2016-11-01 07:16:07	marco208	same, 5 ms
2016-11-01 07:16:24	marco208	ping over vpn 6 ms
2016-11-01 07:16:40	@krzee	tried iperf with an without the vpn?

2016-11-01 07:17:33	marco208	Not iperf, but a http post upload over VPN 500KBps average without 9~11MBps
2016-11-01 07:18:06	@krzee	iperf is better cause you can do tcp or udp
2016-11-01 07:18:37	@krzee	and you can do the same with openvpn
2016-11-01 07:18:58	marco208	the http server and vpn server are in the same datacenter, ping <1ms bandwidth 998Mbit
2016-11-01 07:19:01	@krzee	then mess with combos and see if anythings different
2016-11-01 07:19:04	marco208	I will test iperf
2016-11-01 07:19:16	@krzee	i assumed the http server was on the vpn server itself lol
2016-11-01 07:19:47	@krzee	since thats normally how people test that sort of stuff, then they d/l via vpn ip and pub ip
2016-11-01 07:20:18	@krzee	except iperf is better
2016-11-01 07:20:34	@krzee	but still using pub ip and vpn ip
2016-11-01 07:21:39	marco208	Im setting ip iperf somewhere else now, and then client -> ovpn -> server test it
2016-11-01 07:25:26	marco208	well, that's weird...

2016-11-02 00:56:15	@vpnHelper	[17:14:21] "tcp" is (#1) Sometimes you cannot avoid tunneling over tcp, but if you can avoid it, DO. http://sites.inka.de/~bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html Why TCP Over TCP Is A Bad Idea., or (#2) http://www.openvpn.net/papers/BLUG-talk/14.html for a presentation by James Yonan (OpenVPN lead developer), or (#3) if you must use tcp, you likely want --tcp-nodelay [17:14:21]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	marco208	[17:14:22] No, I'm home now :) [17:14:22]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	marco208	[17:14:37] stable 100Mbit ping 5ms to 8.8.8.8 [17:14:37]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	@krzee	[17:15:21] 8.8.8.8 doesnt matter, but i assume its good to the vpn server as well [17:15:21]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	marco208	[17:15:31] tcp-nodelay -> I wrote it down, I will check this tomorrow. [17:15:31]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	marco208	[17:16:07] same, 5 ms [17:16:07]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	marco208	[17:16:24] ping over vpn 6 ms [17:16:24]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	@krzee	[17:16:40] tried iperf with an without the vpn? [17:16:40]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	marco208	[17:17:33] Not iperf, but a http post upload over VPN 500KBps average without 9~11MBps [17:17:33]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	@krzee	[17:18:06] iperf is better cause you can do tcp or udp [17:18:06]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	@krzee	[17:18:37] and you can do the same with openvpn [17:18:37]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	marco208	[17:18:58] the http server and vpn server are in the same datacenter, ping <1ms bandwidth 998Mbit [17:18:58]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	@krzee	[17:19:01] then mess with combos and see if anythings different [17:19:01]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	marco208	[17:19:03] I will test iperf [17:19:03]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	@krzee	[17:19:16] i assumed the http server was on the vpn server itself lol [17:19:16]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	@krzee	[17:19:47] since thats normally how people test that sort of stuff, then they d/l via vpn ip and pub ip [17:19:47]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	@krzee	[17:20:18] except iperf is better [17:20:18]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	@krzee	[17:20:34] but still using pub ip and vpn ip [17:20:34]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	marco208	[17:21:39] Im setting ip iperf somewhere else now, and then client -> ovpn -> server test it [17:21:39]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	marco208	[17:25:26] well, that's weird... [17:25:26]

2016-11-02 00:56:15	marco208	[17:27:08] What could make the http upload limit to 500KBps? TCP? [17:27:08]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	marco208	[17:29:27] The iperf server is located on the same server as the HTTP host [17:29:27]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	arha	[17:38:15] hi [17:38:15]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	arha	[17:38:31] is there some initialization header i can catch when openvpn starts? [17:38:31]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	arha	[17:39:51] i'm trying to make some router rules, so when connecting on a public ip, :443, when the stream starts with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE it redirects to some internal ip :80, when it does [whatever openvpn uses], it redirects  to ip:1194, and if nothing happens for a while, it redirects to ip:@2 [17:39:51]

2016-11-02 00:56:15	makinen	[10:39:56] I've set up and openvpn client and server and the traffic flows just fine between them. Now I'd like open a connection from the internet to server and reroute the connection to the openvpn client [10:39:56]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	makinen	[10:40:26] iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 9002 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.9.8.2 [10:40:26]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	makinen	[10:40:41] that is what tried to do with no success [10:40:41]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	makinen	[10:44:20] except the tcp handshake completes but nothing goes through [10:44:20]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	@dazo	[10:47:21] makinen: I've done that ... you need the PREROUTING ... but you need some more hackery too, with routing tables on the VPN client [10:47:21]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	@dazo	[10:48:11] so that the return path when your service on/behind the VPN client responds it will be sent out via the VPN tunnel and not the local default gateway [10:48:11]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	@dazo	[10:49:32] makinen: the service you want to enable from the internet via the VPN ... is it hosted on the VPN client? [10:49:32]
2016-11-02 00:56:15	@dazo	[10:51:03] btw .... rob0 is the one who helped me discover all this ages ago ... so he might have some valuable input too, if he got time [10:51:03]

2016-11-02 02:13:32	@dazo	makinen: okay, what you basically need to do is to add an --up script on the client .... which does this:
2016-11-02 02:13:43	@dazo	meh
2016-11-02 02:13:53	@dazo	 /sbin/ip rule add from ${ifconfig_local} table 3000
2016-11-02 02:13:54	@dazo	 /sbin/ip route add default via @@VPN_IP_ADDRESS_OF_SERVER@@ table 3000
2016-11-02 02:13:54	@dazo	 /sbin/ip route flush cache
2016-11-02 02:14:40	@dazo	you can change '3000' to a number of your own, or swap it to a name being referenced in /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
2016-11-02 02:15:56	@dazo	you need a similar --down script as well ... and if you use --user/--group, you need to run that script via the down-root plugin.  The down-script just does this:
2016-11-02 02:15:56	@dazo	 /sbin/ip rule del from ${ifconfig_local} table 3000
2016-11-02 02:15:56	@dazo	 /sbin/ip route flush cache
2016-11-02 02:18:29	@dazo	What this does is that packets arriving via the VPN tunnel will go via the VPN tunnel when the service responds, regardless of the source IP address .... without this rule, it will go out via the default gateway instead of the VPN, which again leads nowhere and packet "drops"
2016-11-02 02:18:29		[02:18]
2016-11-02 02:18:47	@dazo	You can confirm this behaviour by running tcpdump on your default gateway interface

2016-11-02 03:16:32		[03:16]
2016-11-02 03:18:30	@dazo	makinen: yes, but that requires you to have a single openvpn process for each client .... I'd rather recommend you to use PKI and certificates .... it gives far better security too
2016-11-02 03:18:33	@dazo	!static
2016-11-02 03:18:34	@vpnHelper	"static" is (#1) use --ifconfig-push in a ccd entry for a static ip for the vpn client, or (#2) example in net30 (default): ifconfig-push 10.8.0.6 10.8.0.5 example in subnet (see !topology) or tap (see !tunortap): ifconfig-push 10.8.0.5 255.255.255.0, or (#3) also see !ccd and !iporder, or (#4) with static IPs, limit your --ifconfig-pool to exclude the static range, or (#5) See also: !addressing
2016-11-02 03:18:38	@dazo	nah
2016-11-02 03:19:16	@dazo	!statickey
2016-11-02 03:19:17	@vpnHelper	"statickey" is (#1) you can use static keys by using --secret </path/to/key>, or (#2) static keys only work for ptp links, not client/server. They also do not provide forward encryption. A forward-secure encryption scheme (such as openvpn uses with certs) protects secret keys from exposure by evolving the keys with time., or (#3) see !forwardsecurity for more info

2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[19:55:45] in fact it's "skipping" the option as invalid [19:55:45]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[19:55:49] and everything works fine [19:55:49]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[19:55:55] so probably they have that line duplicated [19:55:55]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	@dazo	[19:58:18] alex88: it's possible to increase the log level to see the PUSH_REPLY line (should be a slider you pull to the right above the log data somewhere) .... I'd do that just to be 100% sure [19:58:18]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[19:58:57] on the new client? sure let me do it [19:58:57]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	@dazo	[20:00:35] no need to imgur it ... just verify the PUSH_REPLY line [20:00:35]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[20:01:28] PUSH_REPLY,dhcp-option DNS 192.168.1.1,route-gateway 192.168.2.1,topology subent, ping 10, ping-restart 120,route-delay 10,route-gateway ,redirect........ [20:01:28]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[20:01:37] yeah, another route-gateway without the second parameter [20:01:37]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[20:01:48] same list of options shown in the other vpn client [20:01:48]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	@dazo	[20:02:08] right, so the VPN server does the wrong thing ... and OpenVPN Connect is most picky about it [20:02:08]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[20:02:14] that's why tunnelblick wasn't able to do anything, maybe on the second route-gateway it was setting a null router ip [20:02:14]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[20:02:24] yeah, more strict on that [20:02:24]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[20:02:44] and they weren't able to replicate this in their lab..lol [20:02:44]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[20:03:02] maybe it's cheaper for them to send a replacement router and try that first, than working on a firmware issue [20:03:02]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	@dazo	[20:03:23] It didn't match any paths in their management controlled troubleshoot sheet .... which means "not our problem" </sarcasm> [20:03:23]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[20:03:50] :D [20:03:50]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	@dazo	[20:04:40] well, new firmwares are much more expensive .... as they need to run that through more internal processes, including several rounds of tests and reviews .... at least that is what is fairly common in the embedded world [20:04:40]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	@dazo	[20:04:46] which is why it takes time [20:04:46]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	@dazo	[20:05:10] for all we know, the ball is already rolling internally .... it just haven't ended in a publicly released update [20:05:10]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[20:05:56] could be, so why send me a new router? it's an openvpn config ffs, they could've tested that without even using a router [20:05:56]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[20:06:00] to see there was something wrong with it [20:06:00]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	@dazo	[20:06:34] well, that's just engineer department not speaking with support department [20:06:34]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[20:06:52] or the opposite, to not bother them [20:06:52]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	@dazo	[20:06:53] (that's not even a joke) [20:06:53]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[20:07:36] no no, I can imagine such situation, they're probably already busy on something else, now that this product (a week after the issue being opened) has been declared EOL [20:07:36]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	@dazo	[20:11:54] yeah [20:11:54]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	@dazo	[20:12:40] which is one of the reasons I prefer openwrt for routers and CyanogenMod for Android phones .... the firmware there have far better long-term support than what the manufacturer provides [20:12:40]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[20:13:10] I've switched back to stock after I started using nexus phones... [20:13:10]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[20:13:15] so about routers, your advice is openwrt [20:13:15]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[20:13:34] I've only used dd-wrt in my routers, so I'll dig better on how openwrt works [20:13:34]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	@dazo	[20:14:13] openwrt isn't so slick and smooth on the web UI side as dd-wrt ... but I usually disable the webUI anyway and use only SSH, so I don't notice that so much [20:14:13]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[20:14:27] oh ok good to know :) [20:14:27]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	@dazo	[20:14:59] well, it might have improved .... it's probably 5-6 years since I tried LuCI (openwrt webUI) :) [20:14:59]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	alex88	[20:15:18] :D [20:15:18]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	@dazo	[20:16:56] My mantra is:  What can't be done on the command line isn't worth doing. [20:16:56]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	brutser	[20:52:48] dazo: you still around maybe? i had another issue i wanted to discuss [20:52:48]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	brutser	[20:54:01] a few clients complain that when they surf using the vpn, they get a lot of captcha request and some even got blocked from some online service they were using - they say it's the vpn, but i checked the outgoing ip of the vpn, and that's not blacklisted anywhere and there is no reason also why it would be blacklisted - is there something else that can cause this? [20:54:01]
2016-11-02 12:00:58	@dazo	[21:04:52] brutser: sounds like cloudflare related issues ... quite common with VPN services and IP some ranges ... [21:04:52]

2016-11-02 14:33:06	TheWhisper	Hi, is it possible to allow a client to connect to the VPN and then connect to only one device on the same LAN as the VPN?
2016-11-02 14:33:06		[14:33]
2016-11-02 14:33:45	TheWhisper	But prevent it from connecting to any other devices on the LAN?
2016-11-02 14:33:57	TheWhisper	Basically, have the VPN allow access to the LAN but only to one device on said LAN
2016-11-02 14:35:05	TheWhisper	I currently have it setup: client -> VPN (+ device VPN is on) -> all devices on LAN
2016-11-02 14:35:31	TheWhisper	but I want to limit it so that it's: client -> VPN (+ device VPN is on) -> 1 device on LAN (with all other inaccessable)
2016-11-02 14:40:13	@dazo	TheWhisper: sounds like you need to look into firewalling.  That is the best and most common way to restrict what VPN client can do over the VPN

2016-11-02 14:40:54	@dazo	TheWhisper: on the VPN server side
2016-11-02 14:40:57	TheWhisper	I was working on some iptables rules, but figured there had to be a better way
2016-11-02 14:41:23	TheWhisper	I'm surprised there's no way to just like 'route [vpn ip] [lan ip]
2016-11-02 14:41:27	@dazo	iptables is by far the best way ... that can't easily be manipulated by OpenVPN
2016-11-02 14:41:58	--	Vampire0_ is now known as Vampire0
2016-11-02 14:42:13	@dazo	you can do that too of course, the server can route single IP addresses ... but the client can still add its own routing entries, circumventing that
2016-11-02 14:42:29	@dazo	remember that security comes in layers
2016-11-02 14:43:02	TheWhisper	Wouldn't the server's config have to mirror what the client's is requesting?
2016-11-02 14:43:21	@dazo	not when it comes to routing
2016-11-02 14:43:39	TheWhisper	Interesting
2016-11-02 14:43:50	@dazo	not at all ... this is how TCP/IP is designed
2016-11-02 14:44:03	TheWhisper	It's interesting if you weren't already aware of it :P
2016-11-02 14:44:13	TheWhisper	This is what I was working on for iptables: http://hastebin.com/ogumasuzim.css
2016-11-02 14:44:14	@vpnHelper	Title: hastebin (at hastebin.com)
2016-11-02 14:44:21	TheWhisper	The VPN is hosted on a NAS
2016-11-02 14:44:35	@dazo	that looks quite sane
2016-11-02 14:44:58	TheWhisper	This would allow me to access the NAS' ports as well as a single device's port on the LAN?
2016-11-02 14:45:22	@dazo	if you want to be even stricter, you'll add similar routing rules on the devices representing LAN DEVICE IP and NAS IP ... you can't filter on tun+ device, but use the VPN client IP
2016-11-02 14:45:51	@dazo	line 1 allows all ports on NAS IP on traffic coming from the tun0 device
2016-11-02 14:46:15	@dazo	all VPN clients on all NAS IP ports, that is
2016-11-02 14:46:30	@dazo	line 2 allows all VPN clients on tun0 to access PORT on LAN DEVICE IP
2016-11-02 14:46:41	@dazo	and line 3 denies everything else
2016-11-02 14:46:57	TheWhisper	Would I need similar OUTPUT rules too?
2016-11-02 14:47:07	@dazo	no, wait a minute!
2016-11-02 14:47:12	@dazo	you need this in FORWARD
2016-11-02 14:47:44	@dazo	INPUT/OUTPUT chains are for "localhost" .... and FORWARD is for the traffic not destined to "localhost"
2016-11-02 14:48:14	TheWhisper	Ah, for packets being routed through the box
2016-11-02 14:48:14		[14:48]

2016-11-02 14:48:28	TheWhisper	haha sorry to keep you up :P
2016-11-02 14:48:34	@dazo	no worries :(
2016-11-02 14:48:35	@dazo	:)
2016-11-02 14:49:05	TheWhisper	Okay, let me give this a try again
2016-11-02 14:49:21	@dazo	I'd do a few hardening details though .... I'd add -s VPN_IP_RANGE
2016-11-02 14:49:24	TheWhisper	I can't get my iptables-restore to work
2016-11-02 14:49:36	@dazo	try iptables-save first?
2016-11-02 14:49:55	TheWhisper	I saved it to a file, added my rules into that file, and then ran iptables-restore
2016-11-02 14:50:04	TheWhisper	but it's complaining that a chain already exists in iptables
2016-11-02 14:50:10	@dazo	ahh, can you pastebin the save?
2016-11-02 14:50:11	TheWhisper	so I'm thinking I need to flush all my rules
2016-11-02 14:50:20	TheWhisper	sure, one minute
2016-11-02 14:50:30	TheWhisper	Can I PM you?
2016-11-02 14:50:42	@dazo	for the pastebin URL, yes
2016-11-02 14:51:19	@dazo	it's something duplicated if iptables-restore fails ... it will normally flush everything by default before applying the new rule set

2016-11-02 23:27:11	@dazo	[00:43:21] not when it comes to routing [00:43:21]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	TheWhisper	[00:43:39] Interesting [00:43:39]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	@dazo	[00:43:50] not at all ... this is how TCP/IP is designed [00:43:50]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	TheWhisper	[00:44:03] It's interesting if you weren't already aware of it :P [00:44:03]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	TheWhisper	[00:44:13] This is what I was working on for iptables: http://hastebin.com/ogumasuzim.css [00:44:13]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	@vpnHelper	[00:44:14] Title: hastebin (at hastebin.com) [00:44:14]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	TheWhisper	[00:44:21] The VPN is hosted on a NAS [00:44:21]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	@dazo	[00:44:35] that looks quite sane [00:44:35]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	TheWhisper	[00:44:58] This would allow me to access the NAS' ports as well as a single device's port on the LAN? [00:44:58]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	@dazo	[00:45:22] if you want to be even stricter, you'll add similar routing rules on the devices representing LAN DEVICE IP and NAS IP ... you can't filter on tun+ device, but use the VPN client IP [00:45:22]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	@dazo	[00:45:51] line 1 allows all ports on NAS IP on traffic coming from the tun0 device [00:45:51]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	@dazo	[00:46:15] all VPN clients on all NAS IP ports, that is [00:46:15]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	@dazo	[00:46:30] line 2 allows all VPN clients on tun0 to access PORT on LAN DEVICE IP [00:46:30]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	@dazo	[00:46:41] and line 3 denies everything else [00:46:41]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	TheWhisper	[00:46:57] Would I need similar OUTPUT rules too? [00:46:57]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	@dazo	[00:47:07] no, wait a minute! [00:47:07]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	@dazo	[00:47:12] you need this in FORWARD [00:47:12]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	@dazo	[00:47:44] INPUT/OUTPUT chains are for "localhost" .... and FORWARD is for the traffic not destined to "localhost" [00:47:44]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	TheWhisper	[00:48:14] Ah, for packets being routed through the box [00:48:14]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	@dazo	[00:48:14] (it's 1:45am where I am ... and I was just about to call it a day :)) [00:48:14]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	@dazo	[00:48:19] yeah, exactly [00:48:19]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	TheWhisper	[00:48:28] haha sorry to keep you up :P [00:48:28]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	@dazo	[00:48:34] no worries :( [00:48:34]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	@dazo	[00:48:35] :) [00:48:35]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	TheWhisper	[00:49:05] Okay, let me give this a try again [00:49:05]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	@dazo	[00:49:21] I'd do a few hardening details though .... I'd add -s VPN_IP_RANGE [00:49:21]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	TheWhisper	[00:49:24] I can't get my iptables-restore to work [00:49:24]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	@dazo	[00:49:36] try iptables-save first? [00:49:36]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	TheWhisper	[00:49:55] I saved it to a file, added my rules into that file, and then ran iptables-restore [00:49:55]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	TheWhisper	[00:50:04] but it's complaining that a chain already exists in iptables [00:50:04]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	@dazo	[00:50:10] ahh, can you pastebin the save? [00:50:10]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	TheWhisper	[00:50:11] so I'm thinking I need to flush all my rules [00:50:11]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	TheWhisper	[00:50:20] sure, one minute [00:50:20]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	TheWhisper	[00:50:30] Can I PM you? [00:50:30]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	@dazo	[00:50:42] for the pastebin URL, yes [00:50:42]
2016-11-02 23:27:11	@dazo	[00:51:19] it's something duplicated if iptables-restore fails ... it will normally flush everything by default before applying the new rule set [00:51:19]

2016-11-03 04:14:32	@ecrist	try manufacturing. :)
2016-11-03 04:15:00	Rienzilla	Question on addressing. Suppose I have a local network A (192.168.1.0/24). An openvpn (tun) server is located in this network. I want my vpn clients to receive addresses within a part of the 192.168.1.0/24 range.
2016-11-03 04:15:04	@ecrist	we have 2000 identical PC's, and, without some udev tomfoolery on our part, all of them will boot with NICs in a different order
2016-11-03 04:15:22	Rienzilla	Currently, I managed to set this up by giving the network clients addresses in another range (say, 10.0.123.0/24), and use scripts to give the clients also an address within 192.168.1.0/24, while adding a /32 route to that address over the tun interface on the vpn server and enabling proxy-arp.
2016-11-03 04:15:22	@ecrist	Rienzilla: you're probably doing it wrong
2016-11-03 04:15:38	Rienzilla	how so?
2016-11-03 04:15:38		[04:15]
2016-11-03 04:15:51	@ecrist	why are you trying to put them in the same network range as the LAN?
2016-11-03 04:16:15	@dazo	(ecrist was faster asking the exact same question I had)
2016-11-03 04:16:23	Rienzilla	Because in that setup, the machines in the LAN don't have to know how to route back to the VPN
2016-11-03 04:16:38	@dazo	Rienzilla: you have a default gateway for that LAN, right?
2016-11-03 04:16:42	@ecrist	yeah, you're doing it wrong
2016-11-03 04:16:43	Rienzilla	(and I don't necessarily control the default router of the lan; it's also not the same machine as the vpn concentrator)
2016-11-03 04:17:15	@dazo	well, then you should get in control ... because VPNs are not a way to circumvent normal network admin tasks
2016-11-03 04:17:19	@ecrist	the alternative is to NAT traffic from the VPN server to the LAN
2016-11-03 04:17:27	@ecrist	dazo++
2016-11-03 04:17:27	Rienzilla	yeah I understand that I could NAT
2016-11-03 04:18:12	Rienzilla	but why should I NA
2016-11-03 04:18:30	Rienzilla	T, if the routing is also possibly without address translation?
2016-11-03 04:18:32	@ecrist	because you aren't in control of the gateway
2016-11-03 04:18:50	@ecrist	the correct thing to do is to properly route the traffic
2016-11-03 04:18:56	@dazo	ecrist++
2016-11-03 04:18:56	@ecrist	then no NAT is required
2016-11-03 04:19:17	Rienzilla	how is a solution using proxy arp not properly routed?
2016-11-03 04:19:25	DArqueBishop	This is something you should be discussing with the person who DOES control the gateway.
2016-11-03 04:19:41	@ecrist	a grotesque hack could be to set up a box with a bunch of IPs aliased on an interface and set up a true 1:1 NAT to varying VPN clients
2016-11-03 04:19:54	@dazo	eeek
2016-11-03 04:19:57	@ecrist	you could stand that up with some --client-connect scripts and the like, but, yuk
2016-11-03 04:19:59	Rienzilla	why?
2016-11-03 04:20:30	@dazo	because it really makes your setup far more fragile to break next week, tomorrow or just a few hours later
2016-11-03 04:21:19	SviMik	maybe tap and bridging? :)
2016-11-03 04:21:26	DArqueBishop	Rienzilla: well, let me put it this way. If I were the network admin in a corporate environment and I found someone was trying something like this without talking to me first, my first stop would be to my superior (usually the CIO or VP of administration) to have said person disciplined or fired.
2016-11-03 04:21:41	Rienzilla	SviMik: tap and bridging is what i'm trying to prevent
2016-11-03 04:21:57	@dazo	Rienzilla: in network there is only one way to do it ... to do it properly.   Anything else is a waste of time and energy, because you will at some point need to go back to do it the proper way

2016-11-03 04:32:05	DArqueBishop	If you're unwilling to talk to the network admin, that tells me you don't actually have permission to do what you're doing. Considering I would be mightily pissed if I were in your netadmin's tools (as I've been both a netadmin and a sysadmin), I'm not going to help you with your shenanigans.

2016-11-03 04:35:12	@ecrist	Rienzilla: generally, if someone doesn't have access to the default gateway, they're trying to do something against the rules

2016-11-03 04:37:52	Rienzilla	the third option of no access to the gateway, is a home network with an adsl or cable modem of which the configuration is controlled by your internet service provider, which is not at all that uncommon
2016-11-03 04:38:30	@dazo	then your VPN box needs to interfaces, and will become the default gw for the LAN .. .where it will transparently route whatever it needs over a VPN
2016-11-03 04:38:40	@dazo	needs *two interfaces
2016-11-03 04:39:15	Rienzilla	And if someone would want a worry-free access to their home network, and access to their own internet connection from anywhere in the world, a VPN server which does not require modification of the gateway is - in my opinion - a good way to go

2016-11-03 08:22:47	@dazo	routing gets complicated, but if done correct, that works
2016-11-03 08:23:28	@dazo	nicehsz: please be very careful about providing such links .... prefer resources on our wiki pages ... the reason is !blogs

2016-11-03 08:27:51	@dazo	(the vpnchains project haven't had much activity for ~4 years ... which is also not a too good indication, as security products should to have some kind of progress ... especially when the dependencies (OpenVPN) have changed quite a lot of the same period)
2016-11-03 08:28:24	nicehsz	o.. k, sorry!
2016-11-03 08:30:47	@dazo	no worries, we're thankful you're hanging out and trying to help!  so feel free keep up the good work :)

2016-11-03 08:33:26	nicehsz	:) thanks too, i think mainly people like urself haveing been helpful in the past when ive had all kindsa issues and asking around similarly is what motivates me the most to try help others as well if possible=) ..hopefully they too would eventually as well some time then,or be more inclined atleast..:)
2016-11-03 08:34:41	@dazo	one thing I can guarantee you ... if you're humble enough to accept criticism from the old-timers here, you will learn a lot while helping others .... and that's the beauty of it all!

2016-11-03 08:47:36	nicehsz	id guess being less known having advantage of not being as attractive a target, major popular ones possibly becoming vulnerable at some point thru vulnerabilities discovered when trying to attack some high-value target or way to exploit the amount of ppl affected...  but also.. less battle-tested,maybe major flaws easily found.Being open source I guess most assume that others will have analysed
2016-11-03 08:47:36	nicehsz	..and have reason to trust because of, rarely going in depth or even ever compiling themselves at all
2016-11-03 08:47:37	nicehsz	if worried may be good to use a mix, and various less-common ones like this in-between among other creative/individual adjustments too..depending on paranoia:d
2016-11-03 08:48:23	@dazo	if anyone here chooses to use OpenVPN-NL ... that's not a problem at all ... it is basically the same openvpn source code, just being built with stricter defaults and some features disabled

2016-11-03 10:43:16	brutser	dazo: i am trying to get a fixed ip for a client, but i get this error: There is a problem in your selection of --ifconfig endpoints [local=10.1.0.10, remote=10.1.0.1].  The local and remote VPN endpoints must exist within the same 255.255.255.252 subnet.  This is a limitation of --dev tun when used with the TAP-WIN32 driver.  Try 'openvpn --show-valid-subnets' option for more info.

2016-11-03 10:44:47	Celmor	dazo, but /etc/openvpn/servername.key should be kept secre / only root should have read acces on this, right?
2016-11-03 10:44:55	@dazo	brutser: regarding openvpn-nl .... yes, we know very well about it.   That project is why we have mbedTLS/PolarSSL support in the upstream OpenVPN ... Fox-IT guys is behind that support.   OpenVPN-NL basically the upstream OpenVPN with a reduced feature set to reduce the risk of configuring a VPN tunnel with a weaker security aspect

2016-11-03 10:46:49	brutser	dazo: so if i use the 10.1.0.0/24 , what is the correct way to push the ip address to the client?
2016-11-03 10:47:04	brutser	let's say i want 10.1.0.10 for the client
2016-11-03 10:47:09	@dazo	Celmor: just ensure you don't save the CA *key* file on a publicly available server .... that file needs to be well protected ... loose control of that one, and anyone who possess it can sign new and valid certificates without your knowledge

2016-11-03 10:49:24	@dazo	brutser: in fact the URL in #3 in the !topology gives a very good overview
2016-11-03 10:49:24	@dazo	Celmor: the server does not need CA key at all ... .server only needs:  server.key, server.crt, ca.crt and dh*.pem
2016-11-03 10:49:24	@dazo	Celmor: clients only need   client.key, client.crt and ca.crt
2016-11-03 10:50:13	@dazo	Celmor: you can put all the Easy-RSA files on a USB drive, disconnect it and put it into a fire safe ... and it would work very well .... you only need the CA private key when creating (signing) new certificates
2016-11-03 10:50:35	@dazo	(and the other Easy-RSA files, are just helper files for the openssl tools which is used under the hood of Easy-RSA)

2016-11-03 16:30:42	zoredache	You are probably generating the keys as root, which probably isn't the best idea, you should be able to generate the keys as any account.  Anyway, change the ownership of the files to the account you are using with winscp, or grant access for that account (and only that account) to the files/directory.

2016-11-03 18:41:05	pacovc	:)
2016-11-03 18:42:18	mrkurtz	ctrl-f 'redirect-gateway' here: https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html
2016-11-03 18:42:20	@vpnHelper	Title: HOWTO (at openvpn.net)
2016-11-03 18:42:44	mrkurtz	When redirect-gateway is used, OpenVPN clients will route DNS queries through the VPN
2016-11-03 18:43:20	pacovc	is that part of network manager openvpn?
2016-11-03 18:43:40	mrkurtz	so i think if you don't use that setting, and possibly if you're not using iptables to nat your traffic, then probably the dns request goes out from your client public IP
2016-11-03 18:44:03	mrkurtz	sure, i think it's for any? i'm just starting to play with it tonight so not super familiar tho
2016-11-03 18:45:31	pacovc	i wonder if you can use that setting in network manager i want to look :)
2016-11-03 18:45:50	mrkurtz	oh no
2016-11-03 18:45:59	mrkurtz	that's a server-side setting
2016-11-03 18:46:03	mrkurtz	sorry
2016-11-03 18:46:10	pacovc	np
2016-11-03 18:46:37	pacovc	I guess it see's the vpn dns since its not showing a dns leak
2016-11-03 18:47:11	mrkurtz	could already be configured for that then yeah
2016-11-03 18:47:30	pacovc	it could be since it network manager with the openvpn plugin
2016-11-03 18:48:12	pacovc	im not sure openvpn does not automatically block outside dns
2016-11-03 18:48:17	pacovc	why
2016-11-03 18:49:41	mrkurtz	lots of different reasons to use a VPN
2016-11-03 18:49:58	mrkurtz	apps and not web, all traffic, specific destinations, etc
2016-11-03 18:50:14	pacovc	i understand

2016-11-03 22:49:41	nicehsz	[00:57:42] that is the vpn servers gateway/router address?  can u ping it or other hosts in the network..?  hm. . .:s [00:57:42]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	brutser	[00:58:00] yes i can ping the vpn server [00:58:00]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	nicehsz	[01:00:40] tried changing some of the options u have in your client openvpn config file (and reconnect between changes, to ensure being applied i tihnk..),  such as on/off the option "use default gateway on remote network" maybe.. [01:00:40]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	nicehsz	[01:03:34] ..or maybe something like (windows?-)firewall on the vpn server preventing access out, or such..   sry im kindof a newb to this all,mostly googling around trying to find hints of what could try..:z hms [01:03:34]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	brutser	[01:04:02] yea im alreayd googling [01:04:02]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	brutser	[01:04:19] hoping someone will get here who can help, not saying you are not, but we are in the same boat i think :) [01:04:19]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	Hobz	[02:27:09] Hello, I'm trying to set up openvpn on debian and I need to transfer certificates from the server to my windows machine.  I'm using winSCP, but I keep getting "permission denied" when trying to access the keys/ folder [02:27:09]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	zoredache	[02:30:42] You are probably generating the keys as root, which probably isn't the best idea, you should be able to generate the keys as any account.  Anyway, change the ownership of the files to the account you are using with winscp, or grant access for that account (and only that account) to the files/directory. [02:30:42]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	Hobz	[02:32:13] Thanks, I'm following a tutorial on digitalocean that uses root as the user [02:32:13]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	Hobz	[02:32:57] Could I trouble you for the proper chmod settings?  It's been a while since I've done anything in the shell [02:32:57]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	Hobz	[02:35:27] nm, I got it.  Thank you again! [02:35:27]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	mrkurtz	[03:34:53] !goal [03:34:53]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	@vpnHelper	[03:34:55] "goal" is Please clearly state your goal for your vpn: example, I would like to access the lan behind the server , I would like to access the internet over my vpn , I just want a secure connection between 2 computers , etc [03:34:55]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	mrkurtz	[03:35:21] so my goal is to actually connect to my LAN and also get out to the internet over the VPN [03:35:21]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	mrkurtz	[03:35:40] do i just need 2 separate client profiles, one for TAP and one for TUN? [03:35:40]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	Hobz	[03:48:04] I keep getting failed connections when I use the OpenVPN in W7, is there a way to increase the verbosity of the error? [03:48:04]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	pacovc	[04:07:24] does anyone know if the openvpn in network manager in ubuntu when the dns shows google or opendns with a vpn does that server see the vpn ip address or the user ip address? [04:07:24]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	mrkurtz	[04:15:29] would only ever see a public IP [04:15:29]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	mrkurtz	[04:15:49] or, are you asking if it sees the VPN's external or the client's external without VPN? [04:15:49]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	pacovc	[04:39:23] i mean can the dns see my ip or does it see the vpn [04:39:23]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	pacovc	[04:39:27] mrkurtz [04:39:27]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	mrkurtz	[04:40:53] yo [04:40:53]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	pacovc	[04:41:05] :) [04:41:05]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	mrkurtz	[04:42:18] ctrl-f 'redirect-gateway' here: https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html [04:42:18]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	@vpnHelper	[04:42:20] Title: HOWTO (at openvpn.net) [04:42:20]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	mrkurtz	[04:42:44] When redirect-gateway is used, OpenVPN clients will route DNS queries through the VPN [04:42:44]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	pacovc	[04:43:20] is that part of network manager openvpn? [04:43:20]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	mrkurtz	[04:43:40] so i think if you don't use that setting, and possibly if you're not using iptables to nat your traffic, then probably the dns request goes out from your client public IP [04:43:40]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	mrkurtz	[04:44:03] sure, i think it's for any? i'm just starting to play with it tonight so not super familiar tho [04:44:03]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	pacovc	[04:45:31] i wonder if you can use that setting in network manager i want to look :) [04:45:31]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	mrkurtz	[04:45:50] oh no [04:45:50]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	mrkurtz	[04:45:56] that's a server-side setting [04:45:56]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	mrkurtz	[04:46:03] sorry [04:46:03]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	pacovc	[04:46:10] np [04:46:10]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	pacovc	[04:46:37] I guess it see's the vpn dns since its not showing a dns leak [04:46:37]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	mrkurtz	[04:47:11] could already be configured for that then yeah [04:47:11]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	pacovc	[04:47:30] it could be since it network manager with the openvpn plugin [04:47:30]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	pacovc	[04:48:12] im not sure openvpn does not automatically block outside dns [04:48:12]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	pacovc	[04:48:17] why [04:48:17]
2016-11-03 22:49:41	mrkurtz	[04:49:41] lots of different reasons to use a VPN [04:49:41]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	mrkurtz	[04:49:58] apps and not web, all traffic, specific destinations, etc [04:49:58]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	pacovc	[04:50:14] i understand [04:50:14]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	mrkurtz	[06:44:59] but, when i connect from my laptop, thru my phone's hotspot, using xubuntu,xfcd,network-manager-openvpn-gnome, i can hit the internet, but not the LAN [06:44:59]

2016-11-03 22:49:42	nicehsz	[08:42:14] good morning [08:42:14]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	yogg	[08:42:41] If I start an ovpn server a route gets added to the default routing table in the system (like: "192.168.250.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 tap0") [08:42:41]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	yogg	[08:43:01] Is there a way to add these rotes also to other tables (policy based routing) [08:43:01]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	yogg	[08:45:05] I can add it manually with "ip route add 192.168.250.0/24 dev tap0 table mycustomtable" [08:45:05]

2016-11-04 01:27:57	bandroidx	i am in the shitty situation where i need to allow a client to connect to a network (192.168.1.0/24) via openvpn and then remote desktop to a PC.  The obvious issue is the LAN that the openvpn server is on is 192.168.1.0/24 and this is going to cause all sorts of issues.  So I am thinking can I use port forwarding and nat to make it so the user connects to the openvpn server, gets ip of 10.8.0.2, and then remote desktop to 10.8.0.1 (the
2016-11-04 01:27:57	bandroidx	openvpn server vpn ip) and have it forward that specific port to the desktop running RDP inside the lan?

2016-11-04 01:31:03	trohn_javolta	i want to run a openvpn client on my router. I flashed a custom firmware on the router which already supports this but I want to run the openvpn-polarssl version via entware on the router
2016-11-04 01:31:52	trohn_javolta	because now the speed is quite low due to cpu limitation of the router
2016-11-04 01:32:59	trohn_javolta	ssh'ing to the router I already managed to install openvpn-polarssl and also to start openvpn client. It says Initialization complete so everything fine. But after that I have no internet connection
2016-11-04 01:33:26	trohn_javolta	if I use the built in vpn client it works..
2016-11-04 01:33:55	trohn_javolta	openvpn-polarssl should be much faster with de/encryption.

2016-11-04 02:08:59	@dazo	bandroidx: have a look at the --client-nat option ... that can be used to circumvent the issues you have
2016-11-04 02:09:35	bandroidx	dazo, I got it working with DNAT
2016-11-04 02:11:08	@dazo	with --client-nat, you can avoid the DNAT hack .... and get a more routeable network .... you can f.ex. remap the server side 192.168.1.0/24 to 10.9.1.0/24 ... on the VPN client you use 10.9.1.43 to access 192.168.1.43

2016-11-04 02:13:04	@dazo	have a look at the man page, it explains it fairly well

2016-11-04 02:13:36	bandroidx	i did when you first mentioned it and noticed it said "This  pushable  client  option"
2016-11-04 02:13:52	bandroidx	my issue is i dont want the end user to require admin privs on their windows machine
2016-11-04 02:14:08	@dazo	yeah, and it supports both snat and dnat ... which defines where this remapping happens
2016-11-04 02:14:32	bandroidx	so if its pushed to the client likely they will need that, the one good thing about my DNAT hack is that it allows the windows client to run w/o admin privs
2016-11-04 02:14:57	@dazo	OpenVPN will requires admin privileges to setup the routing regardless, but the --client-nat stuff will be setup during the time it have the right privileges
2016-11-04 02:15:29	bandroidx	with what i did with DNAT its working w/o admin privs on the windows client
2016-11-04 02:15:33	bandroidx	as they dont need any routes
2016-11-04 02:15:49	@dazo	but most of the operation happens inside the openvpn process, so that should not require any additional privileges
2016-11-04 02:15:57	bandroidx	i probably will leave the DNAT for this instance because its actually best this person can only RDP to that one computer and not gain any othyer access

2016-11-04 09:20:03	speciality	or does it use NAT as a matter of functionality?
2016-11-04 09:20:33	@dazo	Do not confuse NAT into this, and in particular not --proto stuff .... NAT is not present at that layer at all
2016-11-04 09:21:01	speciality	ok thanks
2016-11-04 09:21:11	@dazo	but in --server (--tls-server) mode, each VPN client gets its on VPN IP address from a VPN subnet
2016-11-04 09:22:12	@dazo	the VPN server can via iptables add NAT *if* configured to do so.  Then client traffic being forward via the VPN server will have the iptables configured NAT address.  But only in this case

2016-11-04 10:27:04	BtbN	set a route for all IPs it uses on your normal default route
2016-11-04 10:27:49	BtbN	or the other way around, configure openvpn to not set the default route, and only set routes through the VPN for IPs you have to access via the VPN.

2016-11-04 12:31:44	zamabe	Hello. First time setting up openvpn, went relatively well. The CA exists on both sides, the client has a signed cert. The server has a letsencrypt cert. Browsers do not have issues verifying this cert for https, but openvpn gives this error in client logs, and I'm not sure what it thinks is broken:
2016-11-04 12:31:44	zamabe	VERIFY ERROR: depth=1, error=unable to get local issuer certificate: C=US, O=Let's Encrypt, CN=Let's Encrypt Authority X3
2016-11-04 12:32:07	zamabe	s/CA/CA cert/
2016-11-04 12:32:56	zamabe	OpenSSL: error:14090086:SSL routines:ssl3_get_server_certificate:certificate verify failed

2016-11-04 12:33:51	@dazo	zamabe: ehm .... you should not use commercial (even Let's Encrypt) certificates for your OpenVPN server
2016-11-04 12:34:42	@dazo	zamabe: the reason is, if I figure out your servers IP address and port ... I can use a Lets encrypt signed certificate to connect to your server and get properly authenticated
2016-11-04 12:35:44	@dazo	zamabe: look at easy-rsa, xca or similar CA solutions and setup your own private CA .... here you sign your own certificates for all your servers and clients, and only those certificates signed by the CA you control can establish a connection
2016-11-04 12:36:00	zamabe	aaaah, so, the server cert should also be signed by the generated CA cert?
2016-11-04 12:36:15	@dazo	yeah
2016-11-04 12:36:45	zamabe	More clarity for me: The reason it cannot verify the certificate is because it only checks against the given CA cert?
2016-11-04 12:36:45	@dazo	if you use easy-rsa ... there should be a "build server" approach
2016-11-04 12:37:23	@dazo	correct ... the clients will on connection be sent the servers certificate, which it will validate against the local copy of the CA certificate (--ca)
2016-11-04 12:38:20	@dazo	and once the client approves, it will sent its client certificate to the server, which does a similar check against the local CA certificate ... plus CRL checks (--crl-verify) or other TLS checks (--tls-verify script hook, --plugin, etc)
2016-11-04 12:38:27	zamabe	I did use easy-rsa, just assumed it was a quick-setup option to use the generated CA instead of including instructions on how to get one from the trusted CAs. My bad :)
2016-11-04 12:39:01	@dazo	if it's easy-rsa2 ... then run ./build-server $HOSTNAME
2016-11-04 12:39:12	@dazo	where $HOSTNAME is the hostname of your server
2016-11-04 12:39:14	zamabe	yip :)
2016-11-04 12:39:16	zamabe	thank you
