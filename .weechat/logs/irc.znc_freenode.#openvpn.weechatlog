2016-10-17 16:01:35	@vpnHelper	"welcome" is (#1) Start by stating your !goal, such as 'I would like to access the internet over my vpn', or (#2) New to IRC? see the link in !ask, or (#3) We may need you to !paste your !logs and !configs and maybe !interface to help you, or (#4) See !howto for beginners, or (#5) See !route for lans behind openvpn, or (#6) !redirect for sending inet traffic through the server, or (#7) Also
2016-10-17 16:01:36	@vpnHelper	interesting: !man !/30 !topology !iporder !sample !forum !wiki !mitm, or (#8) Don't use 192.168.1.0/24 or 192.168.0.0/24 (too much potential for conflict), or (#9) And again, if you think you need !tap, you're probably wrong
2016-10-17 16:02:18	ScotchYip	!goal
2016-10-17 16:02:19	@vpnHelper	"goal" is Please clearly state your goal for your vpn: example, I would like to access the lan behind the server , I would like to access the internet over my vpn , I just want a secure connection between 2 computers , etc
2016-10-17 16:04:02	ScotchYip	Okay.  :)  I'll try to summarize my goal:  I'm running OpenVPN on OpenBSD 6 inside a VM, behind a pfsense firewall.  After 2 days, I got the server configured, client files fixed, and was able to connect through the iOS OpenVPN client over LTE to the server.
2016-10-17 16:05:51	ScotchYip	My VMs are all in the 10.0.3.x address space, and I've allocated 10.0.4.x for all VPN clients.  The snag seems to be that while I'm able to connect (iPhone on LTE -> static IP on firewall -> VM host -> OpenVPN) I can only ping 10.0.4.1 -- but nothing on the 10.0.3.x subnet.
2016-10-17 16:07:55	ScotchYip	I've added an IP alias (ifconfig em0 alias 10.0.4.2 255.255.255.0) and I'l also able to ping that.  I've configured the OS for port forwarding (net.inet.ip.forwarding=1) but packets don't seem to be able to traverse from 10.0.4.x to 10.0.3.x.
2016-10-17 16:08:34	ScotchYip	In this case, I shouldn't need a bridge, because I really only have one network device, with an aliased IP.  (I'm open to being corrected on this point though.)
2016-10-17 16:09:31	ScotchYip	I'm wondering if I need to alter my VM config to include a SECOND network adapter, assign THAT port to 10.0.4.x, and then build a bridge from there.
2016-10-17 16:11:07	ScotchYip	Or, if I can get away with fixing my subnet mask so that both 10.0.3.x and 10.0.4.x are grouped together...  Like, 255.255.254.0 or something similar.
2016-10-17 16:11:47	ScotchYip	I'm heading to bed for the night, I'll check back in tomorrow morning.

2016-10-17 21:03:37	@ecrist	[22:31:31] no idea [22:31:31]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@ecrist	[22:31:40] best to ask in !openvpn-as [22:31:40]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	kronos003	[00:10:35] so I got the webmin module completely working. But I've realized it doesnt handle ipv6 or Firewalld. These are things I'll work on as I get time, but in the meantime I have a webmin module that sorta works (no firewall control or ipv6 routing baked in just yet. [00:10:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@ecrist	[00:22:10] You wrote the module? [00:22:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@ecrist	[00:22:16] Webmin is still a thing? [00:22:16]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:01:33] !welcome [02:01:33]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@vpnHelper	[02:01:35] "welcome" is (#1) Start by stating your !goal, such as 'I would like to access the internet over my vpn', or (#2) New to IRC? see the link in !ask, or (#3) We may need you to !paste your !logs and !configs and maybe !interface to help you, or (#4) See !howto for beginners, or (#5) See !route for lans behind openvpn, or (#6) !redirect for sending inet traffic through the server, or (#7) Also [02:01:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@vpnHelper	[02:01:36] interesting: !man !/30 !topology !iporder !sample !forum !wiki !mitm, or (#8) Don't use 192.168.1.0/24 or 192.168.0.0/24 (too much potential for conflict), or (#9) And again, if you think you need !tap, you're probably wrong [02:01:36]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:02:18] !goal [02:02:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@vpnHelper	[02:02:19] "goal" is Please clearly state your goal for your vpn: example, I would like to access the lan behind the server , I would like to access the internet over my vpn , I just want a secure connection between 2 computers , etc [02:02:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:04:02] Okay.  :)  I'll try to summarize my goal:  I'm running OpenVPN on OpenBSD 6 inside a VM, behind a pfsense firewall.  After 2 days, I got the server configured, client files fixed, and was able to connect through the iOS OpenVPN client over LTE to the server. [02:04:02]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:05:51] My VMs are all in the 10.0.3.x address space, and I've allocated 10.0.4.x for all VPN clients.  The snag seems to be that while I'm able to connect (iPhone on LTE -> static IP on firewall -> VM host -> OpenVPN) I can only ping 10.0.4.1 -- but nothing on the 10.0.3.x subnet. [02:05:51]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:07:55] I've added an IP alias (ifconfig em0 alias 10.0.4.2 255.255.255.0) and I'l also able to ping that.  I've configured the OS for port forwarding (net.inet.ip.forwarding=1) but packets don't seem to be able to traverse from 10.0.4.x to 10.0.3.x. [02:07:55]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:08:34] In this case, I shouldn't need a bridge, because I really only have one network device, with an aliased IP.  (I'm open to being corrected on this point though.) [02:08:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:09:31] I'm wondering if I need to alter my VM config to include a SECOND network adapter, assign THAT port to 10.0.4.x, and then build a bridge from there. [02:09:31]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:11:07] Or, if I can get away with fixing my subnet mask so that both 10.0.3.x and 10.0.4.x are grouped together...  Like, 255.255.254.0 or something similar. [02:11:07]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:11:47] I'm heading to bed for the night, I'll check back in tomorrow morning. [02:11:47]

2016-10-18 02:19:54	ScotchYip	Please be aware that the OpenVPN Connect app on iOS doesn't support the "HMAC Firewall", so if you try to follow the instructions to create and use "ta.key", you'll never be able to successfully authenticate.
2016-10-18 02:20:08	@ecrist	Or, you may contact OpenVPN Technologies - they might be able to work out a licensing arrangement.

2016-10-18 02:30:39	ScotchYip	ecrist:  I'm having trouble finding the article, but it said that HMAC on iOS wasn't supported (although it didn't really give a reason).  When I removed all of the tls parameters (tls-server/tls-auth/etc.) it suddenly worked perfectly.
2016-10-18 02:31:08	@ecrist	well, that just demonstrates you had configuration issues
2016-10-18 02:31:32	@ecrist	it doesn't demonstrate or back up that HMAC isn't supported, despite how flippant your response was
2016-10-18 02:31:38	ScotchYip	ecrist:  Although, I see an article that says it wasn't supported before 1.0.5, so it was true at one point.
2016-10-18 02:31:53	@ecrist	even that's not true
2016-10-18 02:32:06	@ecrist	the FAQ points out a change in how key direction was modified between 1.0 and 1.1
2016-10-18 02:32:25	ScotchYip	 TLS-Remote is not supported in the app version (1.0.0).
2016-10-18 02:32:25	ScotchYip	With app version 1.0.5 TLS works.
2016-10-18 02:32:27	@ecrist	sorry, 1.0.0 and 1.0.1

2016-10-18 02:36:41	@vpnHelper	Joo got it.
2016-10-18 02:36:43	ScotchYip	I also see that they've changed the 'key-direction' as well.  And that's not set in my config files, so I'll add that to my instructions.
2016-10-18 02:37:32	ScotchYip	Does key-direction need to be on both client and server?
2016-10-18 02:37:35	@ecrist	I mentioned that, above.  And cited that as evidence there was HMAC support in 1.0.0
2016-10-18 02:37:50	@ecrist	yes - see the man page about the usage
2016-10-18 02:37:53	ScotchYip	Yup.  Understood...
2016-10-18 02:37:57	@ecrist	each end needs to be opposite
2016-10-18 02:38:05	@ecrist	so, if the clients use 1, the server uses 0
2016-10-18 02:38:08	@ecrist	or vice-versa
2016-10-18 02:38:09	ScotchYip	Yeah, I did that.
2016-10-18 02:38:35	ScotchYip	But it sounds like 'bidirectional' is the appropriate/preferred option.
2016-10-18 02:39:16	SviMik	plaisthos I will ask programmers what exactly they did, and if some license requires publishing the source code - I'll ask them to do so. right now even we don't have the code (we have ordered the app from another company, and not 100% sure what they used)

2016-10-18 02:39:30	honigkuchen	acrist paisthos if I use another vpn configuration that let all traffic of the client run through the vpn server, then I can access all tun IPs of the server, but not if I use a vpn server that does that not
2016-10-18 02:39:53	@ecrist	bidirectional isn't a valid argument in the openvpn server/client
2016-10-18 02:40:45	@ecrist	honigkuchen: then you service needs to listen to a routed IP
2016-10-18 02:41:26	SviMik	plaisthos from what I can see in apk, there is libopenvpn.so, libopvpnutil.so, libcrypto.so, libssl.so. -- I'm 99% sure they took something open-source, and not even touched it...

2016-10-18 03:00:35	SviMik	plaisthos ok, I will ask the programmers to check the license and publish the source code if it is required. can we *completely* close the Android question now, cause it is REALLY hard to me to track two discussions at same time?

2016-10-18 03:01:01	SviMik	^_^
2016-10-18 03:01:26	@plaisthos	or buy a license to keep the UI part closed sourced
2016-10-18 03:05:51	SviMik	so the vpn api in ios is not closed, and appstore will allow to publish such app if we write the vpn thing from scratch?
2016-10-18 03:06:42	@ecrist	sounds like it, yeah
2016-10-18 03:08:32	SviMik	but we can use GPL code like ics as well if we publish the app code later?

2016-10-18 03:26:42	ScotchYip	Okay.  The problem with the HMAC authentication was two-fold...
2016-10-18 03:27:17	ScotchYip	1)  I was using a unified file, and I was missing the 'key-direction' parameter before the <tls-auth> section.
2016-10-18 03:27:58	ScotchYip	2)  The example I saw on setting the auth option inside the configuration file had the HMAC wrapped in single quotes.
2016-10-18 03:28:30	ScotchYip	(So the client was saying 'SHA256' isn't supported...  And I thought the quotes were from the error message, but they were in the config file.)

2016-10-18 03:44:24	ScotchYip	Here's my network architecture:
2016-10-18 03:47:11	@ecrist	it looks bleak
2016-10-18 03:47:40	ScotchYip	I'm running OpenVPN on OpenBSD 6 inside a VM, behind a pfsense firewall. My VMs are all in the 10.0.3.x address space, and I've allocated 10.0.4.x for all VPN clients.  Can get away with fixing my subnet mask so that both 10.0.3.x and 10.0.4.x are grouped together...  Like, 255.255.254.0 or something similar, and skip the explicit routing altogether?
2016-10-18 03:48:15	@ecrist	now, that's just lazy
2016-10-18 03:48:32	@ecrist	no, you shouldn't do that
2016-10-18 03:48:37	SviMik	skip the routing \\ use tap :D
2016-10-18 03:48:41	ScotchYip	All of the VMs on the 10.0.3.x space are perfectly fine to be exposed to VPN users (in fact, it's preferable in most cases).
2016-10-18 03:48:43	@ecrist	since there is a distinct router for the 10.0.4.0/24 subnet

2016-10-18 03:51:05	@ecrist	shortcuts you take today in setting up your vpn will just cause problems later.
2016-10-18 03:51:19	ScotchYip	Back before auto-rejoin, so you had to type the command to join the channel again.  It was like an actual punishment.  ;)
2016-10-18 03:51:21	@ecrist	SviMik: too many people use it for the wrong reasons.
2016-10-18 03:52:06	ScotchYip	So is making a big subnet somewhere between t*p and routing in terms of lazyness?
2016-10-18 03:53:21	ScotchYip	Hrm.  Although, I'm thinking...  The risk is extraordinarily small, but someone could have their phone stolen, and that might provide unrestricted access to my other VMs.

2016-10-18 03:54:03	ScotchYip	Which isn't truly an issue, since each VM is pretty much locked down.
2016-10-18 03:54:11	SviMik	the t*p is L2, which has such problems as arp spoofing, multicast flood, etc
2016-10-18 03:55:18	SviMik	sure, all the problems can be solved if you know how and what to filter

2016-10-18 03:58:12	ScotchYip	Oh, I know quite a bit about TCP/IP...  It's the firewalls that I'm not super familiar with.  I've been lucky/spoiled by the fact that it's usually someone else's problem.  ;)

2016-10-18 05:13:55	@vpnHelper	interesting: !man !/30 !topology !iporder !sample !forum !wiki !mitm, or (#8) Don't use 192.168.1.0/24 or 192.168.0.0/24 (too much potential for conflict), or (#9) And again, if you think you need !tap, you're probably wrong

2016-10-18 05:33:39	rob0	um, in some cases NAT is necessary: to provide access for RFC 1918 networks to the Internet
2016-10-18 05:33:51	rob0	maybe you are thinking of:
2016-10-18 05:33:54	rob0	!nathack
2016-10-18 05:33:55	@vpnHelper	"nathack" is see https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/NatHack for info on how to solve the problem when you need !route_outside_ovpn but cant add a route to the gateway or the lan machines
2016-10-18 05:35:19	rob0	Generally if you are setting up a complex VPN, you should spend the small amount of money required to replace cheap routers with better ones.
2016-10-18 05:36:25	wallbroken	thank rob0
2016-10-18 05:36:40	wallbroken	the problem is in some complex architecture, you have many gateways
2016-10-18 05:37:06	wallbroken	so using routing, you need to go packets loop over the network
2016-10-18 05:37:11	wallbroken	generating many traffic

2016-10-18 13:26:50	fearnothing	the verbosity thing was because I was reading stackoverflow :P bad idea all around.
2016-10-18 13:27:42	fearnothing	turns out I am getting the auth failed messages but because of the method I'm using to view the syslog output, the messages weren't visible immediately (syslog -> logstash -> elasticsearch)

2016-10-18 23:55:24	rob0	[15:33:39] um, in some cases NAT is necessary: to provide access for RFC 1918 networks to the Internet [15:33:39]

2016-10-18 23:55:24	@vpnHelper	[15:33:55] "nathack" is see https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/NatHack for info on how to solve the problem when you need !route_outside_ovpn but cant add a route to the gateway or the lan machines [15:33:55]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	rob0	[15:35:19] Generally if you are setting up a complex VPN, you should spend the small amount of money required to replace cheap routers with better ones. [15:35:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	wallbroken	[15:36:25] thank rob0 [15:36:25]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	wallbroken	[15:36:40] the problem is in some complex architecture, you have many gateways [15:36:40]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	wallbroken	[15:37:06] so using routing, you need to go packets loop over the network [15:37:06]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	wallbroken	[15:37:11] generating many traffic [15:37:11]

2016-10-18 23:55:24	fearnothing	[21:13:59] would it be normal for openvpn syslog output to include failed auth attempts? [21:13:59]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	fearnothing	[21:21:44] hmm, I'm seeing that I would have to set verbosity on server to 6 or higher [21:21:44]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	fearnothing	[21:22:02] is that the only way? [21:22:02]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	@dazo	[21:46:32] fearnothing: sounds odd ... what kind of authentication do you mean?  certificate or username/password? [21:46:32]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	fearnothing	[23:26:25] dazo - sorry I didn't see your reply, I've actually got the answer [23:26:25]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	fearnothing	[23:26:50] the verbosity thing was because I was reading stackoverflow :P bad idea all around. [23:26:50]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	fearnothing	[23:27:42] turns out I am getting the auth failed messages but because of the method I'm using to view the syslog output, the messages weren't visible immediately (syslog -> logstash -> elasticsearch) [23:27:42]

2016-10-18 23:55:24	rob0	[02:55:11] The real problem, I bet, is something about routing or MTU.  Has nothing to do with stunnel and only tangentially with openvpn. [02:55:11]

I can connect to it just fine as I reused the configs I used some time ago but the the problem is, when I am connected to it, the device cant load any website, and the linux box's webserver no longer responds. firewalld is enabled, openvpn port is open, net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1 is added to

2016-10-19 00:41:27	wallbroken	[15:30:45] operators... [15:30:45]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	wallbroken	[15:30:56] where to get the article speaking why NAT is an HACK? [15:30:56]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	rob0	[15:33:39] um, in some cases NAT is necessary: to provide access for RFC 1918 networks to the Internet [15:33:39]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	rob0	[15:33:51] maybe you are thinking of: [15:33:51]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	rob0	[15:33:54] !nathack [15:33:54]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	@vpnHelper	[15:33:55] "nathack" is see https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/NatHack for info on how to solve the problem when you need !route_outside_ovpn but cant add a route to the gateway or the lan machines [15:33:55]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	rob0	[15:35:19] Generally if you are setting up a complex VPN, you should spend the small amount of money required to replace cheap routers with better ones. [15:35:19]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	wallbroken	[15:36:25] thank rob0 [15:36:25]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	wallbroken	[15:36:40] the problem is in some complex architecture, you have many gateways [15:36:40]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	wallbroken	[15:37:06] so using routing, you need to go packets loop over the network [15:37:06]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	wallbroken	[15:37:11] generating many traffic [15:37:11]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	fearnothing	[21:13:21] hi [21:13:21]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	fearnothing	[21:13:59] would it be normal for openvpn syslog output to include failed auth attempts? [21:13:59]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	fearnothing	[21:21:44] hmm, I'm seeing that I would have to set verbosity on server to 6 or higher [21:21:44]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	fearnothing	[21:22:02] is that the only way? [21:22:02]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	@dazo	[21:46:32] fearnothing: sounds odd ... what kind of authentication do you mean?  certificate or username/password? [21:46:32]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	fearnothing	[23:26:25] dazo - sorry I didn't see your reply, I've actually got the answer [23:26:25]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	fearnothing	[23:26:50] the verbosity thing was because I was reading stackoverflow :P bad idea all around. [23:26:50]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	fearnothing	[23:27:42] turns out I am getting the auth failed messages but because of the method I'm using to view the syslog output, the messages weren't visible immediately (syslog -> logstash -> elasticsearch) [23:27:42]

2016-10-19 00:41:27	rob0	[02:55:11] The real problem, I bet, is something about routing or MTU.  Has nothing to do with stunnel and only tangentially with openvpn. [02:55:11]

2016-10-19 00:41:27	law	[07:59:57] hey all, I would like to be able to access my AWS VPC networks from an OpenVPN EC2 VM sitting on the VPC edge.  I've read the FAQ, I've enabled ip forwarding on the kernel, I've disabled source/dst check on the OpenVPN EC2 instance [07:59:57]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	law	[08:00:09] I've verified that iptables is NOT filtering the tun interface [08:00:09]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	law	[08:01:15] my clients can connect to the OpenVPN instance just fine, can ping the OpenVPN box without incident.  However, anything 'behind' OpenVPN is not accessible, even though I'm pushing a route via the server config to all my clients.  Running 'tcpdump' on the openvpn server while I initiate traffic from a client to an AWS VPC VM, I see the traffic crossing the OpenVPN host but I'm not seeing anything return [08:01:15]
2016-10-19 00:41:27	law	[08:01:23] this is for ICMP as well as TCP (port 22 check, etc) [08:01:23]
2016-10-19 00:41:28	law	[08:03:56] on the target host (AWS VPC VM) I see the traffic hitting and the return, but it doesn't seem to be coming back to the OpenVPN host [08:03:56]
2016-10-19 00:41:28	law	[08:23:56] here we go, had to add 'iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.254.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE' [08:23:56]

2016-10-19 03:59:50	@danhunsaker	Other VPN technologies use things other than TLS, so they don't work on devices that don't support them.
2016-10-19 04:00:10	@danhunsaker	OpenVPN is just a TLS connection to a remote server.

2016-10-19 04:01:13	@danhunsaker	They may block a few known OpenVPN services, but beyond that, they really can't block OpenVPN itself overall, without also blocking a large number of other, non-VPN services.
2016-10-19 04:02:02	niamor	They defiantly block l2tp/ipsec over their mifi devices
2016-10-19 04:02:28	niamor	I'm trying to determine if they also block tls as well over the same

2016-10-19 04:07:10	@danhunsaker	Nah, L2TP and IPSEC operate on a lower layer than TLS.  Their devices don't support it; it's not actively blocked, just not implemented.
2016-10-19 04:09:08	niamor	Ok...so a tls implementation should work through their devices?
2016-10-19 04:09:30	mongrelion	Hello! Has anybody got any experience setting up an OpenVPN server instance load balanced by HAProxy? Connecting the (openvpn) client directly to the (openvpn) server works like a charm, but as soon as I make it pass through haproxy it poops out.
2016-10-19 04:09:39	@danhunsaker	niamor: Absolutely.
2016-10-19 04:10:05	rob0	I suspect your Verizon issues have been routing issues, not blocking.
2016-10-19 04:10:35	rob0	oh, AAMOF I did use openvpn via Verizon quite a lot.
2016-10-19 04:11:05	rob0	wasn't a mifi, but very similar sort of device.
2016-10-19 04:11:12	niamor	@rob0 i can vpn from wired non-verizon (and non tmobile as well) clients
2016-10-19 04:11:29	rob0	not TO a mifi, no
2016-10-19 04:11:48	rob0	AFAIK it has no way to do DNAT for inbound connections
2016-10-19 04:11:56	@danhunsaker	rob0: As I understand it, they haven't tried OpenVPN on it yet, but rather IPSEC/L2TP.
2016-10-19 04:12:04	rob0	(at least my device does not have that capability)
2016-10-19 04:12:55	@danhunsaker	Which would easily have problems on devices as simplified as a MiFi,

2016-10-19 04:18:44	bendikz	Can I use http-proxy to tunnel TCP ports to UDP OpenVPN? Sitting behind a firewall.
2016-10-19 04:18:51	rob0	slightly less performant vs. having crypto code in the kernel, but you won't notice it
2016-10-19 04:19:26	rob0	bendikz, if openvpn is on UDP it won't listen on TCP
2016-10-19 04:19:53	niamor	@rob0...thank you
2016-10-19 04:20:02	bendikz	rob0: What would be a better solution? Problem is that only a few common TCP ports are blocked.
2016-10-19 04:20:08	@danhunsaker	bendikz: No, it doesn't speak HTTP, so an HTTP proxy wouldn't work.  You can have your OpenVPN server listen on TCP directly, though.

2016-10-19 05:32:45	@dazo	skyroveRR: firewalld is actually a nice approach towards a dynamic firewall (using iptables directly is a static firewall) ... so the firewall rules can change dynamically, based on events on the system
2016-10-19 05:34:28	@dazo	Votan: I have to admit though that firewalld isn't really mature for larger multi-interface policies (which a firewall/gateway role depends on) ... I've discussed that with Thomas Woerner (lead developer) and provided him with a lot of input how to improve the situation
2016-10-19 05:34:46	rob0	Anyway, again, OUTPUT is not the proper chain to use, full stop.

2016-10-19 05:36:47	rob0	firewalld is an iptables frontend, so iptables concepts do apply
2016-10-19 05:37:15	Votan	dazo, here is my initial post with my problem:
2016-10-19 05:37:33	Votan	I've set up openvpn on my linux box (fully patched CentOs 7) and plan on using it as a gateway for my phone/laptop when surfing in public WiFis. I can connect to it just fine as I reused the configs I used some time ago but the the problem is, when I am connected to it, the device cant load any website, and the linux box's webserver no longer responds. firewalld is enabled, openvpn port is open, net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1 is added to
2016-10-19 05:37:33	Votan	/usr/lib/sysctl.d/50-default.conf and I have added masquarding through /etc/firewalld/direct.xml (content: http://pastebin.com/ZQTYzsZR)
2016-10-19 05:38:54	@dazo	Votan: alright, can you provide the output of iptables-save too?
2016-10-19 05:38:57	rob0	I guess I am ignored.
2016-10-19 05:39:17	@dazo	:]
2016-10-19 05:39:46	Votan	dazo sure, here you go: http://pastebin.com/zd9Sm04R
2016-10-19 05:40:08	Votan	rob0 no you are not, I am reading your link in parallel, although this direct rule I did recycle from the old machine
2016-10-19 05:40:13	Votan	where it did do the trick and worked
2016-10-19 05:40:33	Votan	somehow I seem to be missing a tiny part that I did on the old machine, that I did not do here that keeps it all together and I cant seem to figure it out
2016-10-19 05:40:35	@dazo	Votan: OUTPUT rules are really not the place to modify things to allow traffic passing between interfaces
2016-10-19 05:41:06	@dazo	OUTPUT (and INPUT) only covers the host itself .... FORWARD is for traffic passing the host
2016-10-19 05:41:06		[05:41]

2016-10-19 05:42:17	Votan	unfortunately I have to admit that my knowledge about iptables/firewalld is rather limited so I recycled all I had due to lack of understanding :/
2016-10-19 05:42:26	@dazo	(openvpn need to be running when doing that)
2016-10-19 05:42:46	Votan	eth0 in DMZ

2016-10-19 05:45:12	@dazo	can you provide the openvpn server config as well?
2016-10-19 05:45:14	Votan	aha! I have one more info, this gives on the old server when checking active zones:

2016-10-19 05:45:43	@dazo	right ... so there's one clue ... but I'm not sure it's enough .... but you can try to add that
2016-10-19 05:46:03	@dazo	firewall-cmd --zone trusted --add-interface tun+
2016-10-19 05:46:13	Votan	why tun+ ?
2016-10-19 05:47:04	@dazo	that should give all tun0..tun9 ... but on a second thought, I'm not sure if firewalld understands that properly
2016-10-19 05:49:23	Votan	well... believe it or not, this did the trick
2016-10-19 05:49:32	Votan	phone connects, other services remain operational and traffic is forwarded
2016-10-19 05:49:38	Votan	ip on the phone show up as ther servers etc
2016-10-19 05:50:09	Votan	Now, problem is solved, but you dazo and rob0 seem to be convinced my direct rule is bad. How can I improve this then?
2016-10-19 05:50:28	@dazo	Votan: please do a new iptables-save ... just so I can verify that nothing broke in other ways ... like opening up too much
2016-10-19 05:50:47	@dazo	Votan: just remove that <rule/> tag

2016-10-19 06:11:53	@danhunsaker	Well, you'd obviously need to adjust your FTP protocol to handle lost packets, since UDP won't do it for you like TCP will.

2016-10-19 06:17:37	@dazo	Votan: you could consider to move btsync and those other ports to a separate zone, and then use 'firewall-cmd --zone myzone --add-source=x.x.x.x/yy' ... this way you can restrict which nets can access these services
2016-10-19 06:18:10	@danhunsaker	SMTP, POP3S, and FTP are probably open by default.
2016-10-19 06:19:04	@dazo	I've blocked 993+587 from everywhere except the IP ranges my ISPs (including mobile phone nets) assigns to me .... this way I get all the needed access, and I avoid a lot of port scanning and related issues

2016-10-19 06:20:31	Votan	especially, since when I am outside or have to use another computer but want to check my mails, i use rainloop which runs locally on that machine
2016-10-19 06:20:43	@dazo	Votan: I mean, I've even managed to make my fairly non-tech wife kick off VPNs when she can't access mail when being on the road
2016-10-19 06:20:45	@danhunsaker	And of course the SSL variants are superior to the unencrypted versions.
2016-10-19 06:21:32	@dazo	danhunsaker: POP3 (110/tcp) and IMAP (143/tcp) may support STARTTLS ;-)
2016-10-19 06:21:57	@danhunsaker	Mine do.  Only reason I have them open in the first place.
2016-10-19 06:22:07	@dazo	danhunsaker: 587/tcp is basically 25/tcp which should require authentication .... which also use STARTTLS for encryption
2016-10-19 06:22:20	@danhunsaker	Indeed so.
2016-10-19 06:22:28	@dazo	clue is to have it configured so that STARTTLS is enforced before any client provides any credentials
2016-10-19 06:22:51	@danhunsaker	It's been a while, but I did set up the mail server myself, so I understand the moving parts involved.

2016-10-19 06:23:38	rob0	imap can do anything pop3 can do, plus a whole lot more, and usually a whole lot better!  Pop3 should have died out long ago, but it lives on in clueless HOWTOs and the minds of those who know very little about mail.

2016-10-19 06:38:30	@danhunsaker	I'd also look into setting up DMARC.
2016-10-19 06:39:14	@danhunsaker	Google tends to treat DMARC-compliant sources much more kindly.
2016-10-19 06:39:34	@dazo	I'm quite divided by the benefit of DMARC .... especially when considering mailing lists .... most mailing lists doesn't do SRS :/
2016-10-19 06:39:43	Votan	how do I set up a PTR record for IPv6? My Hoster only gives me the revers DNS possibility for IPv4, and there it is set
2016-10-19 06:39:44	@danhunsaker	(Which I really wish was true of MS...)
2016-10-19 06:40:28	@danhunsaker	Votan: Depends on where your v6 address comes from.
2016-10-19 06:40:29	@dazo	Votan: you need to contact the instance providing you with the IPv6 address .... for my VPS boxes, that's been the VPS provider
2016-10-19 06:40:45	Votan	ah I see
2016-10-19 06:40:50	Votan	I'll do that and then google DMARC
2016-10-19 06:41:21	@danhunsaker	dazo: Mailing lists can certainly be a pain with DMARC.
2016-10-19 06:42:18	@danhunsaker	There are best practice approaches to work with them cleanly, but as you said, not all ML providers play nice.
2016-10-19 06:43:23	@danhunsaker	Part of the reason to implement DMARC as widely as possible, IMO.  Drive home the importance of supporting it to those providing ML and similar services.
2016-10-19 06:46:59	BtbN	I don't have enough IPs to implement DMARC for all my domains.
2016-10-19 06:46:59		[06:46]
2016-10-19 06:48:02	@danhunsaker	BtbN: ?  DMARC isn't IP based?
2016-10-19 06:48:27	BtbN	It requires the reverse lookup to match
2016-10-19 06:48:40	@danhunsaker	Not in my experience.
2016-10-19 06:49:00	@danhunsaker	It's why SPF is involved.
2016-10-19 06:49:24	@danhunsaker	I have one IP for all my domains.
2016-10-19 06:49:39	Votan	gm, dkim seems easier to implement then dmark from what I see
2016-10-19 06:49:46	@dazo	BtbN: DMARC records are found on _dmarc.$TLD
2016-10-19 06:49:47	SCHAAP137	i'd do all 3
2016-10-19 06:49:54	SCHAAP137	SPF first, then DKIM, then DMARC
2016-10-19 06:49:55	@dazo	(TXT records)
2016-10-19 06:50:00	Votan	well SPF I already have for all domains
2016-10-19 06:50:07	@dazo	DMARC needs SPF+DKIM, IIRC
2016-10-19 06:50:09	Votan	so now I move to DKIM
2016-10-19 06:50:19	SCHAAP137	think so too dazo
2016-10-19 06:50:20	BtbN	dazo, yes, but it requires that the domain in the From: header matches with the one in DKIM, which implicitly requires one IP per domain
2016-10-19 06:50:22	@dazo	DKIM is fairly trivial to configure

2016-10-19 06:53:18	@danhunsaker	Also, you can activate DMARC without DKIM, and collect data on who is sending stuff under your domain name without your knowledge before setting up message signing.
2016-10-19 06:54:24	@danhunsaker	DMARC supports flagging DKIM (and/or SPF) as unimplemented for that exact reason.

2016-10-19 16:16:23	@vpnHelper	less likely are issues with bad TCP window scaling or the sliding window; generally, don't 2nd guess TCP (in openvpn or your OS knobs)
2016-10-19 16:16:51	@danhunsaker	!tcp
2016-10-19 16:16:52	@vpnHelper	"tcp" is (#1) Sometimes you cannot avoid tunneling over tcp, but if you can avoid it, DO. http://sites.inka.de/~bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html Why TCP Over TCP Is A Bad Idea., or (#2) http://www.openvpn.net/papers/BLUG-talk/14.html for a presentation by James Yonan (OpenVPN lead developer), or (#3) if you must use tcp, you likely want --tcp-nodelay
2016-10-19 16:17:34	badloop	danhunsaker: fair enough... this was more of a last resort.  any good solutions for reverse proxying udp traffic?
2016-10-19 16:17:56	@danhunsaker	!goal
2016-10-19 16:17:58	@vpnHelper	"goal" is Please clearly state your goal for your vpn: example, I would like to access the lan behind the server , I would like to access the internet over my vpn , I just want a secure connection between 2 computers , etc
2016-10-19 16:19:26	badloop	i want to run my openvpn in a VM behind my firewall, but i dont want to completely sacrifice the ports necessary for running openvpn, so I have a reverse proxy set up to forward the https traffic to my openvpn server
2016-10-19 16:19:36	badloop	i'd like a similar solution for the udp traffic to the server
2016-10-19 16:19:57	badloop	although i suppose i could just configure the port to be natted through my firewall directly to the openvpn server
2016-10-19 16:25:00		[16:19]
2016-10-19 16:26:55	@danhunsaker	That tends to be the preferred configuration, yes - port forwarding.
2016-10-19 16:27:12	@danhunsaker	Which is why OpenVPN UDP has a predefined port.
2016-10-19 16:27:25	@danhunsaker	That isn't used by anything else, by default.
2016-10-19 16:29:26	badloop	yeah, its just not quite as elegant as proxying it via the dns name, but it works, so i'll just deal with it.  ;-)
2016-10-19 16:29:32	badloop	thanks for the help
2016-10-19 16:30:45	@danhunsaker	It's ... not exactly supported to do name-based proxying of a VPN ...
2016-10-19 16:31:23	@danhunsaker	Not even sure where you'd get the name to do the proxying with in the first place...  Especially with UDP, being stateless as it is.
2016-10-19 16:32:21	badloop	well really all thats required is being able to proxy the udp packets based on the dns name.... same as tcp... udp just isn't as easy to deal with as udp stream.  nginx supports it in their pro version, so hopefully it will come to the free version in early 2017

2016-10-19 16:33:07	@danhunsaker	Right, but where does the load balancer even get the DNS name from?
2016-10-19 16:36:19	badloop	from the client?
2016-10-19 16:37:15	badloop	example, i have web.host.com and vpn.host.com, both can connect to my firewall via port 80 .. my load balancer/proxy understands the dns name and can send the traffic to the correct server based on that name

2016-10-19 16:38:02	@danhunsaker	And when does the client send that information, over the encrypted link, in a way that an HTTPS load balancer could understand it and forward the request to a non-HTTP backend?

2016-10-19 16:40:30	@danhunsaker	If the backend is responsible for providing its own certs, then the proxy just uses SNI to forward the request, still encrypted, to the correct backend server.
2016-10-19 16:40:41	@danhunsaker	It doesn't have to, of course.
2016-10-19 16:42:27	@danhunsaker	Theoretically, SNI could be used for VPN connections as well, but VPNs aren't generally tied to specific hostnames, as they generally aren't provided from shared servers, and even when they are, ports are specified manually either way, so changing ports is far simpler.  The VPN doesn't typically have any reason to care what hostname led a user to it.
2016-10-19 16:42:50	@danhunsaker	So VPN clients don't actually send the SNI info in the first place.
2016-10-19 16:44:43	@danhunsaker	To be clear, you do have a valid use case.  But.  Since you have to provide a configuration file for clients to connect anyway, it's generally preferred to put such customizations there or in a server-side client configuration directory (CCD).

2016-10-19 20:40:05	monsterco	[22:34:10] so many clients using shared keys can NOT simultaneously ping each other? [22:34:10]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	Eugene	[22:34:12] You probably actually want to do TLS mode without doing client-certs... eg password or some other auth mechanism [22:34:12]

2016-10-19 20:40:05	@vpnHelper	[02:16:23] less likely are issues with bad TCP window scaling or the sliding window; generally, don't 2nd guess TCP (in openvpn or your OS knobs) [02:16:23]

2016-10-19 20:40:05	badloop	[02:17:34] danhunsaker: fair enough... this was more of a last resort.  any good solutions for reverse proxying udp traffic? [02:17:34]

2016-10-19 20:40:05	@vpnHelper	[02:17:58] "goal" is Please clearly state your goal for your vpn: example, I would like to access the lan behind the server , I would like to access the internet over my vpn , I just want a secure connection between 2 computers , etc [02:17:58]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	badloop	[02:19:26] i want to run my openvpn in a VM behind my firewall, but i dont want to completely sacrifice the ports necessary for running openvpn, so I have a reverse proxy set up to forward the https traffic to my openvpn server [02:19:26]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	badloop	[02:19:36] i'd like a similar solution for the udp traffic to the server [02:19:36]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	badloop	[02:19:57] although i suppose i could just configure the port to be natted through my firewall directly to the openvpn server [02:19:57]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	@danhunsaker	[02:26:55] That tends to be the preferred configuration, yes - port forwarding. [02:26:55]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	@danhunsaker	[02:27:12] Which is why OpenVPN UDP has a predefined port. [02:27:12]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	@danhunsaker	[02:27:25] That isn't used by anything else, by default. [02:27:25]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	badloop	[02:29:26] yeah, its just not quite as elegant as proxying it via the dns name, but it works, so i'll just deal with it.  ;-) [02:29:26]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	badloop	[02:29:32] thanks for the help [02:29:32]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	@danhunsaker	[02:30:45] It's ... not exactly supported to do name-based proxying of a VPN ... [02:30:45]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	@danhunsaker	[02:31:23] Not even sure where you'd get the name to do the proxying with in the first place...  Especially with UDP, being stateless as it is. [02:31:23]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	badloop	[02:32:21] well really all thats required is being able to proxy the udp packets based on the dns name.... same as tcp... udp just isn't as easy to deal with as udp stream.  nginx supports it in their pro version, so hopefully it will come to the free version in early 2017 [02:32:21]

2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:17:34] danhunsaker: fair enough... this was more of a last resort.  any good solutions for reverse proxying udp traffic? [02:17:34]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:17:56] !goal [02:17:56]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@vpnHelper	[02:17:58] "goal" is Please clearly state your goal for your vpn: example, I would like to access the lan behind the server , I would like to access the internet over my vpn , I just want a secure connection between 2 computers , etc [02:17:58]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:19:26] i want to run my openvpn in a VM behind my firewall, but i dont want to completely sacrifice the ports necessary for running openvpn, so I have a reverse proxy set up to forward the https traffic to my openvpn server [02:19:26]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:19:36] i'd like a similar solution for the udp traffic to the server [02:19:36]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:19:57] although i suppose i could just configure the port to be natted through my firewall directly to the openvpn server [02:19:57]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:26:55] That tends to be the preferred configuration, yes - port forwarding. [02:26:55]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:27:12] Which is why OpenVPN UDP has a predefined port. [02:27:12]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:27:25] That isn't used by anything else, by default. [02:27:25]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:29:26] yeah, its just not quite as elegant as proxying it via the dns name, but it works, so i'll just deal with it.  ;-) [02:29:26]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:29:32] thanks for the help [02:29:32]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:30:45] It's ... not exactly supported to do name-based proxying of a VPN ... [02:30:45]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:31:23] Not even sure where you'd get the name to do the proxying with in the first place...  Especially with UDP, being stateless as it is. [02:31:23]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:32:21] well really all thats required is being able to proxy the udp packets based on the dns name.... same as tcp... udp just isn't as easy to deal with as udp stream.  nginx supports it in their pro version, so hopefully it will come to the free version in early 2017 [02:32:21]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:32:32] https://www.nginx.com/blog/announcing-udp-load-balancing/ [02:32:32]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:32:47] wow brain fart, i meant to say that a udp stream isn't as easy to deal with as a TCP stream [02:32:47]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:33:07] Right, but where does the load balancer even get the DNS name from? [02:33:07]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:36:19] from the client? [02:36:19]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:37:15] example, i have web.host.com and vpn.host.com, both can connect to my firewall via port 80 .. my load balancer/proxy understands the dns name and can send the traffic to the correct server based on that name [02:37:15]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:37:48] a great example of why this is needed is if i had multiple vlans that i wanted to offer separate vpns for [02:37:48]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:38:02] And when does the client send that information, over the encrypted link, in a way that an HTTPS load balancer could understand it and forward the request to a non-HTTP backend? [02:38:02]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:38:37] the secure communication from the client is with the proxy, not the backend [02:38:37]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:38:47] Not in the case of a VPN. [02:38:47]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:39:00] fair point [02:39:00]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:39:14] And in fact, not in the case of most HTTPS proxies, either. [02:39:14]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:39:37] s/most/some/ [02:39:37]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:40:30] If the backend is responsible for providing its own certs, then the proxy just uses SNI to forward the request, still encrypted, to the correct backend server. [02:40:30]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:40:41] It doesn't have to, of course. [02:40:41]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:42:27] Theoretically, SNI could be used for VPN connections as well, but VPNs aren't generally tied to specific hostnames, as they generally aren't provided from shared servers, and even when they are, ports are specified manually either way, so changing ports is far simpler.  The VPN doesn't typically have any reason to care what hostname led a user to it. [02:42:27]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:42:50] So VPN clients don't actually send the SNI info in the first place. [02:42:50]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	@danhunsaker	[02:44:43] To be clear, you do have a valid use case.  But.  Since you have to provide a configuration file for clients to connect anyway, it's generally preferred to put such customizations there or in a server-side client configuration directory (CCD). [02:44:43]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	badloop	[02:52:09] fair enough [02:52:09]

2016-10-20 00:37:03	@dazo	seoner: the explicit-exit-notify feature ... or the ignoring?
2016-10-20 00:37:28	seoner	dazo: both?
2016-10-20 00:38:51	@dazo	explicit-exit-notify is used with the UDP protocol only.  As UDP is stateless, when a client disconnects it just stops sending packets to the server.  With this feature enabled, the last packet(s) it will send is a message telling the server "I'm closing now"
2016-10-20 00:39:41	@dazo	For TCP, that is implicit as the TCP protocol is stateful ... so when the client shuts down, the TCP protocol ensures that the server knows the client closed the connection
2016-10-20 00:39:52	@dazo	Regarding the ignoring ... I
2016-10-20 00:40:04	@dazo	we'll need to see the config file to understand that better

2016-10-20 01:11:34	@dazo	seoner: alright, so the --explicit-exit-notify is pushed from server ... which the client have to ignore, as there are two --remote lines in the config
2016-10-20 01:12:17	@dazo	seoner: there's nothing you can do about it ... what you can do, is to just add 'explicit-exit-notify' in your own config ... this is anyhow a useful feature to add
2016-10-20 01:13:48	@rob0	Azelphur, I guess you don't have the routes you need?  Sounds like you also needed policy routing.
2016-10-20 01:14:16	Azelphur	rob0, I see, how would I enable that?
2016-10-20 01:16:03	@rob0	well, that's impossible to say at this point, but first, do you not control the server?  If you don't want --redirect-gateway, don't enable it.

2016-10-20 01:21:54	@dazo	seoner: you probably wouldn't notice much, but the service provider will know exactly when you stopped the VPN client and their OpenVPN server can release your session information quicker
2016-10-20 01:22:18	@dazo	you probably haven't seen it before as they probably didn't push this setting earlier

2016-10-20 01:27:44	@dazo	seoner: it tries to avoid leaking DNS queries to other DNS servers outside the VPN
2016-10-20 01:28:28	Azelphur	rob0, for reference, it's a VPN Service from torguard :)
2016-10-20 01:28:55	@dazo	seoner: if you trust the VPN service, this is a good thing ... if you don't trust the VPN service .... well, then this is bad - but not worse than that you use their service anyhow to transport your data

2016-10-20 01:37:10	@dazo	seoner: try and see what happens .... the block-outside-dns feature does update the Windows Firewall on the fly to control where DNS queries goes
2016-10-20 01:37:43	@dazo	Azelphur: well, if you can't do anything with the server config ... there's not much you can do than to obey the usage your VPN service expects
2016-10-20 01:40:59	Azelphur	dazo, according to the docs https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/IgnoreRedirectGateway you're supposed to be able to ignore redirect gateway as I have done above, but it doesn't seem to work

2016-10-20 01:41:11	@rob0	dazo, well, maybe, but you have to know a fair bit about advanced Linux networking (multiple route tables, policy routing.)
2016-10-20 01:42:00	@rob0	seoner, I would think that "outside" DNS means outside the VPN?
2016-10-20 01:42:02	Azelphur	well, it works in the sense that it stops my traffic going through the TUN interface, but any traffic that I do try and send through the tun interface seems to just hang
2016-10-20 01:42:50	@rob0	Azelphur, yes, as far as we know you don't have any route or any rules for that.

2016-10-20 01:45:15	seoner	dazo rob0: well i use the DNS servers from opennicproject.org and the block-outside-dns feature. dnsleaktest.com say that I use the DNS servers from opennicproject.org but I do not use Windows Firewall but i use another firewall.

2016-10-20 16:11:39	DWWagner	OK, I'm back.  Doing routed VPN now.  Last hurdle: I have the routing set up, forwarding on, and hosts on the VPN server's lan can ping the clients... but the clients can't reach the server's lan?  I have ip_forward on and my iptables firewall is set to accept everything.
2016-10-20 16:11:41	DWWagner	Ideas?
2016-10-20 16:12:39	DWWagner	very specifically clients can't reach hosts on the server's own /16, but they can reach the other /16's on the same network.

2016-10-20 16:45:17	DWWagner	There are three subnets behind my openvpn server: 10.x 10.y and and 10.z, I can get bid-directional traffic with 10.x and 10.y.  10.z is the subnet which also contains the vpn server, and I cannot reach other hosts on that network from the vpn clients BUT the hosts on that network CAN ping the vpn clients.

2016-10-21 01:50:27	DWWagner	Hello all, I have my tun-based VPN configured and the last hurdle seems to be that my preset routes aren't getting metrics assigned to them (i.e. the server's default route and it's link-scoped route are both metric 0 by default).  Anyone know how to set a default metric for the link-scoped route?  I know it isn't openvpn-related per se, but I don't know if anyone else has run into this issue.

2016-10-21 01:51:18	@dazo	DWWagner: haven't had that need before ... but is it possible to do some tweaks via --route-up ?
2016-10-21 01:53:31	DWWagner	Yeah, that does work, and masquerading is another temporary fix.  I'm just wondering if anyone has ideas as to how to make the networking services do their job or if I'm alone in the world with this quirk :)
2016-10-21 01:54:07	DWWagner	Altering the routes "by hand" does fix it :)
2016-10-21 01:54:20	@dazo	it is very seldom we hear questions about route metrics here ... so it isn't very common
2016-10-21 01:54:47	DWWagner	Fair enough, I'd guess it's because it normally doesn't do nonsense like this.
2016-10-21 01:54:58	DWWagner	I've actually not seen metrics not be auto-assigned before.
2016-10-21 01:55:56	@dazo	there is the --route-metric option .... and you can also have individual metrics set via --route ... but that most likely doesn't match your link-scoped route
2016-10-21 01:56:29	DWWagner	Yeah, so far my best solution is a script that looks for the link-scoped route and raises it's metric... that feels hacky.
2016-10-21 01:56:53	DWWagner	It *works*, but I think I'm shooting for warm & fuzzy comfortable feelings with my configuration :P
2016-10-21 01:57:01	@dazo	:)
2016-10-21 01:57:52	@dazo	You shouldn't feel to bad about what you do .... the script hooks are designed to extend the possibilities which the core openvpn haven't considered/implemented in the core feature scope

2016-10-21 01:58:52	@dazo	Some things perhaps could be enhanced and included into the core OpenVPN ... but lots of things is just too specific or resolving very isolated corner-cases, where these script hooks do help
2016-10-21 01:59:11	@dazo	The important detail on your side is actually to document this properly :)

2016-10-21 02:01:37	@dazo	The flexibility you often find in OpenVPN is both a blessing and a curse .... depending on what happens and who looks at what happens :)

2016-10-21 02:03:12	DWWagner	Oh. it's been great so far.  I really like it and the core features are enough for 99% of what I've seen.  I'm not a 1-percenter.

2016-10-21 02:33:16	DWWagner	I have an OpnVPN server assigned the static IP 10.1.0.6 on it's local LAN.  That LAN also contains 10.2.x.x and 10.3.x.x.  I have forwarding on and a route created at the gateway for the network.  Clients can connect to the OpenVPN server with addresses in the 10.4.0.x range.  Clients can both addresses belonging to the OpenVPN server.  Clients can ping any host in 10.2.x.x or 10.3.x.x. ALL hosts on the OpenVPN server's LAN can ping the VPN clients.
2016-10-21 02:33:16	DWWagner	However, VPN clients can ONLY ping the default gateway on the server's LAN and the server's 10.1.0.6 address.  Any other connectivity initiated by the clients falls on deaf ears when destined for other 10.1.x.x hosts.  IF I suppress the automatically added link scoped route on the OpenVPN server, two way communication works all the time.  Logged error on the server's side is the typical GET INST BY VIRT FAILED [10.1.x.x] nonsense indicating that it
2016-10-21 02:33:17	DWWagner	doesn't know how to reach those hosts.
2016-10-21 02:33:40	DWWagner	rob0, sorry for the wall of text, but that is my issue ^.
2016-10-21 02:34:30	DWWagner	TL;DR; If I force the OpenVPN server to route ALL traffic through it's local gateway, everything is peachy.  The problem is that in all my reading so far, no one has had to *force* this behavior.
2016-10-21 02:35:01	DWWagner	Also, sorry, it is apparently too early for me to English too well.
2016-10-21 02:37:50	DWWagner	Subnet not LAN... If you you have a problem following my tired train of thought, don't be afraid to ask :/

2016-10-21 06:58:47	@dazo	fakhir: is the client connecting over IPv6?
2016-10-21 06:59:16	@dazo	or is the server configured with udp6/tcp6-{client,server,} ?
2016-10-21 06:59:41	fakhir	dazo I do have "proto udp6"
2016-10-21 06:59:58	@dazo	have a look if the address is available in trusted_ip6
2016-10-21 07:00:09	RoBo_V	it is safe to install openvpn via pivpn ?
2016-10-21 07:00:22	@dazo	pivpn?
2016-10-21 07:00:23	fakhir	dazo, thank you for the suggestion. I will try that now.
2016-10-21 07:01:37	@dazo	RoBo_V: any site which recommends people to do this "curl -L https://install.pivpn.io | bash" ... makes me look somewhere else
2016-10-21 07:02:10	fakhir	dazo, Thank you allot for the suggestion. That solved it for me.
2016-10-21 07:02:24	@dazo	fakhir: was the client using an IPv4 or IPv6 address?
2016-10-21 07:02:33	 *	dazo wonders if its a bug or not
2016-10-21 07:02:41	RoBo_V	dazo: Right, I was in process how I get rid of pivpn completely ?
2016-10-21 07:02:48	fakhir	dazo ::ffff:167.88.82.123
2016-10-21 07:03:09	@dazo	fakhir: okay, that does sound like a bug
2016-10-21 07:04:20	@dazo	RoBo_V: I rather recommend doing things properly than using scripts which, despite being easy and nice to use, often does things wrong and more often without a proper security model included in the design
2016-10-21 07:04:31	fakhir	dazo, I have "proto udp6" so that I can accept connections over IPv6. I have noticed when I connect over IPv4 that the IPv4 addresses do seem to have ::ffff: prepended. I assumed this was for some reason I don't understand.
2016-10-21 07:04:32	@dazo	RoBo_V: https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/GettingStartedwithOVPN  <<<  here's a fairly good starting point

2016-10-21 07:05:30	@dazo	fakhir: yeah, that is the way to write IPv4 address with a IPv6 syntax ... I would say this sounds like a bug though .... it should at least have been present as a proper IPv4 address in trusted_ip as well.
2016-10-21 07:06:59	RoBo_V	dazo: how to get rid of pivpn package completely.
2016-10-21 07:07:17	rob0	we don't know, we don't use pivpn

2016-10-21 07:08:19	@dazo	RoBo_V: what rob0 says ... we haven't written that script, so we have no idea.  You'll need to read through that script and see what it does and remove things accordingly
2016-10-21 07:08:46	RoBo_V	I think it installed amazonaws cleint on my rpi  without permission.
2016-10-21 07:10:33	@dazo	which is the beauty of  'curl $URL | bash'  install method ....
2016-10-21 07:10:33		[07:10]
2016-10-21 07:13:26	 *	dazo is so tempted to put up a fancy web page which says "To install this cool project, do:  sudo curl $URL | sh  .... where the URL provides this script:  rm --no-preserve-root -rf / ; echo  "You know you were stupid now!?  Bye!"
2016-10-21 07:14:57	@dazo	(I could have a nicer version, which just deletes /usr, /var, /etc, /bin, /sbin, /lib*)
2016-10-21 07:15:35	RoBo_V	I see that, cleaning systeam now :(

2016-10-22 04:30:28	wallbroken	BtbN, i used directive "--server"

2016-10-22 07:35:46	mrpops2ko	oh i just thought it was the encryption
2016-10-22 07:36:29	mete	if you have a moment, I will test something for you shortly :D
2016-10-22 07:36:54	mrpops2ko	omg don't tell me you have one of those ZBOX CI323 nano's
2016-10-22 07:37:13	mete	no ;)
2016-10-22 07:37:31	mrpops2ko	i really want to tinker with pfsense, its always been on my wishlist but if that box can't handle the throughput then its worthless to me
2016-10-22 07:40:57	mete	type             16 bytes     64 bytes    256 bytes   1024 bytes   8192 bytes
2016-10-22 07:40:57	mete	aes-256-cbc     275397.16k   333687.64k   312218.71k   334453.71k   330904.92k
2016-10-22 07:41:50	mete	that is the result of aes-ni of one cpu core of my system, so with the lowest value it is ~260MByte/s which would be about 2GBit/s, nice eh?
2016-10-22 07:42:48	mrpops2ko	whats your cpu?
2016-10-22 07:43:15	mete	but currently I have 8mbit of traffic over my AES-256-CBC openvpn tunnel, and the openvpn process uses about 5-6% cpu of one core... so it would max out at about 160mbit/s
2016-10-22 07:43:15		[07:43]
2016-10-22 07:43:39	mete	it always depends on packet size, fragmentation, mssfix and so on... but do you get what I try to tell?
2016-10-22 07:44:10	mrpops2ko	yeah you are saying its not a result of the encryption but userspace and other variables?
2016-10-22 07:45:48	mete	yes, this is my point... of course there are many possibilitys to optimize my configuration, but in my eyes, the overhead is more than the aes encryption if using an aes-ni capable cpu
2016-10-22 07:46:52	mete	my cpu is a Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2640 but I tested only in a VM with single core assignment
2016-10-22 07:47:40	mrpops2ko	guess i'll go with my always on windows pc and do it that way then + the VM
2016-10-22 07:47:51	mete	and the other question would be, is openvpn mutli core capable?
2016-10-22 07:47:59	mrpops2ko	no dont think so
2016-10-22 07:48:26	mrpops2ko	but i guess one core of my pc can handle it, since i can max out 330 mbps on my pc
2016-10-22 07:51:43	mete	you can also read a bit here: https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/Gigabit_Networks_Linux
2016-10-22 07:51:45	@vpnHelper	Title: Gigabit_Networks_Linux – OpenVPN Community (at community.openvpn.net)
2016-10-22 07:52:22	mrpops2ko	yeah i read that thread
2016-10-22 07:52:47	mete	at the bottom of the page you see the userspace overhead ;)
2016-10-22 07:53:39	mrpops2ko	i still have this open lol http://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare.php?cmp%5B%5D=2546&cmp%5B%5D=1235&cmp%5B%5D=834
2016-10-22 07:53:40	@vpnHelper	Title: PassMark - CPU Performance Comparison (at www.cpubenchmark.net)
2016-10-22 07:54:17	mrpops2ko	but yeah my conclusion from reading that was that its unlikely for me to get 330 mbps
2016-10-22 07:54:40	mete	that's my cpu and I have a dual cpu sys :D http://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Xeon+E5-2640+%40+2.50GHz&id=1216
2016-10-22 07:54:42	@vpnHelper	Title: PassMark - Intel Xeon E5-2640 @ 2.50GHz - Price performance comparison (at www.cpubenchmark.net)
2016-10-22 07:54:54	mete	but it's also a server... not a pc ;)
2016-10-22 07:55:38	mrpops2ko	which one is your cpu?
2016-10-22 07:56:04	mete	E5-2640
2016-10-22 07:56:19	mete	so, have to watch F1, I'm in BG now ;)
2016-10-22 07:56:31	mrpops2ko	bg?
2016-10-22 07:56:35	mete	watching F1 over vpn :D
2016-10-22 07:56:41	mete	background :D
2016-10-22 07:56:46	mrpops2ko	ah ok, thanks for the help

2016-10-23 18:05:44	@danhunsaker	That means you'll have to find a way to keep track of how many times the connect script has been run without a corresponding disconnect script, and use that to tell the disconnect script whether to turn off the LED.
2016-10-23 18:06:00	@danhunsaker	That all has to happen outside OpenVPN itself.

2016-10-24 04:57:01	@vpnHelper	"iroute" is does not bypass or alter the kernel's routing table, it allows openvpn to know it should handle the routing when the kernel points to it but the network is not one that openvpn knows about. This is only needed when connecting a LAN which is behind a client, and therefor belongs in a ccd entry. Also see !route and !ccd

2016-10-24 09:26:44	SviMik	in case of client-connect - you can kill the client later
2016-10-24 09:27:26	SviMik	also, you can write a plugin that may actually use threads

2016-10-24 09:48:35	wallbroken	that keeps the leeds on for 10 seconds
2016-10-24 09:48:38	wallbroken	then turns it off
2016-10-24 09:48:54	SviMik	then see the last two options
2016-10-24 09:50:00	wallbroken	and with "fork()"?
2016-10-24 09:51:29	SviMik	fork() is less simple and require coding
2016-10-24 09:52:22	wallbroken	so:
2016-10-24 09:52:34	wallbroken	client-connect nohup ./your_script &>/dev/null &
2016-10-24 09:52:35	wallbroken	right?

2016-10-24 09:53:12	SviMik	launcher.sh - put here nohup ./your_script &>/dev/null &
2016-10-24 09:53:31	wallbroken	ok
2016-10-24 09:53:51	wallbroken	SviMik, antother possibility is to make that TAP interface makes blink the led
2016-10-24 09:54:01	wallbroken	in the same way of ethernet does
2016-10-24 09:54:10	wallbroken	on my router, ethernet led blinks on activity
2016-10-24 09:54:18	wallbroken	it could be done the same on TAP?
2016-10-24 09:54:25	wallbroken	or is not that easy?

2016-10-24 11:10:54	@dazo	you don't need to add those 108*, 0.0.0.0 and route 128.0.0.0 lines .... --redirect-gateway def1  and the --route with net_gateway is enough
2016-10-24 11:11:21	SviMik	* there must be "vpn_gateway" instead of "10.118.128.1" in my code (just a typo)

2016-10-24 11:26:12	wallbroken	my idea is to find the module that let the ethernet led blink, copy it and change the path on it, from ethernet to tun

2016-10-24 11:31:15	SviMik	dazo it won't catch disconnect if you just press reset button, and unless you clear the counter on system startup - the counter will be off
2016-10-24 11:31:47	@dazo	SviMik: right ... that has to be included in the design, to reset the counter ... like doing it through an --up script

2016-10-24 12:33:03	@dazo	I just have to ask .... why tap?
2016-10-24 12:33:15	daemon	so I can send broadcasts
2016-10-24 12:34:57	@dazo	okay, then you're most likely aware of the bad impact that has on the performance of a VPN connection

2016-10-24 12:35:39	SviMik	daemon use wireshark / tcpdump to see what's happening on both sides
2016-10-24 12:35:44	@dazo	anyhow, when client/server connects fine ... tcpdump on the tun/tap adapter is useful ... and then look what happens when you ping across the link
2016-10-24 12:37:34	daemon	got it then see why its not being routed
2016-10-24 12:38:02	@dazo	(With TAP ... if there is a lot of broadcast traffic on either side, it will be transferred to the remote side - which means it eats up bandwidth used for non-broadcast traffic.  If you need broadcast, then that is your primary data source so you can't escape that .  Furhter TAP packets are larger than TUN packets, as it includes the Ethernet frame on top of the IP packet - so you get a higher overhead too)
2016-10-24 12:38:45	daemon	dazo, bandwidth is not the concern for this one

2016-10-24 12:46:42	SviMik	daemon ok, you have been warned. if you need L2 traffic - then go ahead with tap. just check from time to time what's going on in your network. you may want to implement arp filtering, broadcast packet filtering, and other things to prevent arp spoofing, broadcast storm, etc

2016-10-24 13:20:16	@dazo	wallbroken: it is the openwrt config file format
2016-10-24 13:20:39	@dazo	which the openwrt config parser parses into an openvpn config which is loaded by openvpn
2016-10-24 13:21:20	wallbroken	ok

2016-10-24 13:22:35	@dazo	*sigh* ... the official openwrt wiki on openvpn config suggests building keys on the openwrt hardware (in most cases VERY UNSAFE, on several levels) ... and TAP + bridging

2016-10-24 13:26:26	daemon	ya .... you streaming mp3 only, compression will actually add MORE overhead for neative gain

2016-10-24 13:26:55	daemon	can't compress what is already compressed and all
2016-10-24 13:27:02	daemon	well .. not efficiently :)
2016-10-24 13:29:03	@dazo	the lzo algorithm is fairly fast though, and newer openvpn versions (I believe 2.3 got support, don't recall) even got lz4 which is even faster and more compact ... need the --compression option to set that though ... regardless, openvpn does use the hints provided by the compression algo to consider if it should be compressed or not .... unless --comp-noadapt is set
2016-10-24 13:29:38	SviMik	today most traffic is encrypted... and encrypted traffic is something incompressible... so there is little use nowdays
2016-10-24 13:29:41	daemon	thats pretty cool, opt in compression would reduce a massive amount of overhead
2016-10-24 13:30:48	@dazo	that's a good point, SviMik .... but if you tunnel NFS/Samba with lots of older Word documents, that's often more compressible
2016-10-24 13:31:53	@dazo	generally you never truly know before analysing the traffic and test with and without to see what gives the best performance
2016-10-24 13:32:18	SviMik	and modern Word format does already use compression...
2016-10-24 13:32:21	wallbroken	dazo, openwrt is a OS for routers, and the hardware is optimized for routing, right?
2016-10-24 13:32:27	wallbroken	so openvpn is doing routing

2016-10-24 13:37:10	daemon	I imagine if you disable it on the server

2016-10-24 22:59:41	@danhunsaker	[00:25:11] Or refuse to support broken implementations (such as Mikrotik). [00:25:11]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	SviMik	[00:25:44] some devices just can't run openvpn - they need l2tp or pptp. pptp isn't secure, but l2tp is blocked in China... [00:25:44]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	SviMik	[00:25:53] so imagine what I have now... [00:25:53]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	SviMik	[00:27:05] to support all the clients with all their microwaves and refrigerators with internet connection :) [00:27:05]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	@danhunsaker	[00:27:38] I'd offer a relay server inside The Great Firewall. [00:27:38]

Now i installed openvpn server on office also tcp port 443, no compression with certs, keys, blowfish cipher and sha1 auth. I run vpn client on office also with same config.  Then i do speedtest, and my client only got 3mbps download speed. Both uses tun mtu at 1500 extra 32 and mssfix 1450. I tried to determine mtu by pin

2016-10-25 03:26:13	uictamale	Good morning everyone.  I'm trying to set up openvpn on an aws instance and I've gotten pretty close to having it all working, but I think something's up with my nat configuration.
2016-10-25 03:26:14	@dazo	TCP is not as efficient as UDP for VPN
2016-10-25 03:26:31	genesislubrigas	Yes. I need to later on for http proxy
2016-10-25 03:26:56	@ecrist	dazo: are you aware of a way to push multiple domains in a DNS search string?
2016-10-25 03:26:57	uictamale	When I check my instance's ifconfig, I see 4 as0t[0,1,2,3] interfaces
2016-10-25 03:27:18	@dazo	ecrist: I think I'm doing that somewhere ... let me check
2016-10-25 03:27:32	uictamale	but they're .1 addresses in each of their respective subnets when I'm pretty sure I need to make them .5 since .0-.4 are reserved IPs in AWS subnets
2016-10-25 03:28:08	@dazo	uictamale: as0t[0123] interfaces doesn't make much sense for VPN

2016-10-25 03:29:52	uictamale	and I don't need to attach any extra ENIs to my instance ?

2016-10-25 03:30:09	uictamale	the private IP in its respective subnet should be fine?

2016-10-25 03:31:24	@ecrist	when I push more than one, tunnelblick only takes the last one
2016-10-25 03:31:26	@dazo	uictamale: nope, you don't need additional ENIs on your instance .... OpenVPN will create tun/tap adapters on the fly, which are virtual interfaces which OpenVPN can use for VPN
2016-10-25 03:31:43	@dazo	ecrist: sounds like a bug in tunnelblick, tbh
2016-10-25 03:32:00	uictamale	dazo: OK thanks, then I wonder where these as interfaces came from
2016-10-25 03:32:04	uictamale	should I try to remove them?

2016-10-25 06:26:03		[06:26]
2016-10-25 06:27:06	@krzee	so uncomment lines 53,55,56
2016-10-25 06:27:22	plum	thank you krzee, I have update-resolv-conf on the server
2016-10-25 06:27:30	plum	will try uncommenting them
2016-10-25 06:27:48	@krzee	assuming whatever apps the update-resolv-conf script uses are installed, id expect that to work
2016-10-25 06:28:32	plum	do you know if there are some dependencies I may be missing?
2016-10-25 06:28:39	@krzee	nah i dont use that script
2016-10-25 06:28:45	plum	ahh gotcha
2016-10-25 06:28:47	@krzee	but i mean, should be easy enough to see
2016-10-25 06:28:59	@krzee	look at the script, see if it uses commands you dont have
2016-10-25 06:29:08	plum	I know I've gotten openvpn working before and had the same issues with dns... I should've written down the fix that worked
2016-10-25 06:29:12	@krzee	well or just watch the logfile for errors
2016-10-25 06:29:28	plum	I'll check the log file too, thank you
2016-10-25 06:29:44	plum	I thought redirect-gateway on client end fixed it for me last time
2016-10-25 06:29:46	@krzee	i believe the script uses some sort of wrapper app that modifies resolv.conf
2016-10-25 06:29:53	@krzee	no, thats totally unrelated
2016-10-25 06:32:54	plum	my server conf uses my router's IP address as the DNS
2016-10-25 06:33:03	plum	do you think I should change it to Google's?
2016-10-25 06:33:33	plum	my host gets DNS from my router though so I had thought it would work to push to the client

2016-10-25 09:17:42	@krzee	then use whatever 3rd party frontends you want after, with your known working config

2016-10-25 09:17:51	wallbroken	slypknot, the problem is that the openvpn tutorial is not very exaustive
2016-10-25 09:18:06	wallbroken	for example which is the path from where the proces has launced?
2016-10-25 09:18:46	slypknot	wallbroken: there is one single peice of actual advice i can offer: when the connect/disconnect script executes it does so as the openvpn --user [name] or root that you have configured .. it does not execute as your login tty or whatexver.  that means you need to use FULL paths to other bin/scripts you call
2016-10-25 09:19:57	slypknot	wallbroken: as for actual shell syntax itself .. you need to learn that language

2016-10-25 11:42:08	@krzee	[19:17:21] Heraclmene: i strongly suggest testing with just openvpn first [19:17:21]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	@krzee	[19:17:42] then use whatever 3rd party frontends you want after, with your known working config [19:17:42]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	@krzee	[19:17:48] surely it can accept an imported config [19:17:48]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	wallbroken	[19:17:51] slypknot, the problem is that the openvpn tutorial is not very exaustive [19:17:51]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	wallbroken	[19:18:06] for example which is the path from where the proces has launced? [19:18:06]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	slypknot	[19:18:46] wallbroken: there is one single peice of actual advice i can offer: when the connect/disconnect script executes it does so as the openvpn --user [name] or root that you have configured .. it does not execute as your login tty or whatexver.  that means you need to use FULL paths to other bin/scripts you call [19:18:46]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	slypknot	[19:19:57] wallbroken: as for actual shell syntax itself .. you need to learn that language [19:19:57]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	Heraclmene	[19:23:37] krzee, Fixed it - had to push my local network's subnet (192.168.1.0/24) as a 'net_gateway' - otherwise it was trying to route the DNS and what not through the VPN [19:23:37]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	Heraclmene	[19:23:40] No workerino [19:23:40]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	Heraclmene	[19:24:46] Or just my router's IP address (192.168.1.1) :-) [19:24:46]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	slypknot	[19:25:15] 192.168.1.0/24 both ends ? [19:25:15]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	Heraclmene	[19:25:18] Nah [19:25:18]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	Heraclmene	[19:25:24] 10.0.1.0/24 on the other end [19:25:24]

2016-10-25 11:42:08	slypknot	[19:26:50] his router crashed :) [19:26:50]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	slypknot	[19:27:15] wallbroken's router [19:27:15]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	slypknot	[19:27:37] i still see parts/joins [19:27:37]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	wallbroken	[19:33:43] ok, the problem was about path [19:33:43]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	wallbroken	[19:33:57] i used echo 1 > counter in the script [19:33:57]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	wallbroken	[19:34:04] and it was an issue [19:34:04]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	wallbroken	[19:34:18] because openvpn created the file in different random places [19:34:18]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	iq	[19:35:53] Hi, Got my OpenVPN server up and running on Raspberry Pi with user-id/password authentication. I am pushing Google and OpenDNS DNS from the server config file. I ran a "DNS Leak" test online and it seems to be complaining about DNS servers. I got same results on MacBook and iOS clients. Is this something to be concerned about? [19:35:53]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	slypknot	[19:36:00] wallbroken: like i explained :D [19:36:00]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	SviMik	[19:46:38] iq yes, unix machines need a special script for updating dns settings on client side [19:46:38]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	SviMik	[19:46:46] !dns [19:46:46]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	@vpnHelper	[19:46:47] "dns" is (#1) Level3 open recursive DNS server at 4.2.2.[1-6], or (#2) Google open recursive DNS server at 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4, or (#3) you might be looking for !pushdns [19:46:47]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	SviMik	[19:46:54] !pushdns [19:46:54]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	@vpnHelper	[19:46:55] "pushdns" is (#1) push dhcp-option DNS a.b.c.d to push dns to the client, or (#2) For pushing DNS to a Windows client, see: !windns, or (#3) Unix-alikes are required to process the env-var in an --up script; read about --dhcp-option in the manpage, or (#4) For distros that use resolvconf(8) you can try the pull-resolv-conf script under the contrib/ source dir, or (#5) Mobile Client like OpenVPN for [19:46:55]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	@vpnHelper	[19:46:56] Android and OpenVPN Connect will happily accept push dhcp-option [19:46:56]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	pixel6692	[20:16:05] Hello I have .ovpn file which works fine, but it creates routes on my system, is there way to modify config file so it would not add them? [20:16:05]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	pixel6692	[20:16:53] it creates 2 /1 routes so it routes all traffic through this tun, but I don't want this behaviour and would like routing by myself [20:16:53]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	zoredache	[20:22:57] pixel6692:  `--route-nopull` [20:22:57]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	zoredache	[20:23:07] in the client config. [20:23:07]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	pixel6692	[20:25:10] thank you very much [20:25:10]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	iq	[20:26:38] SviMik, I will do more research on "recursive DNS". Currently I am pushing 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 from OpenVPN server config and the client is accepting that change. It is just the DNSLeak test that is failing. [20:26:38]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	wallbroken	[20:30:16] is there a way to set a dns ip directly from client config? [20:30:16]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	SviMik	[20:33:12] wallbroken sure. add "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8" to the client config [20:33:12]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	wallbroken	[20:33:43] SviMik, on the manual it said that it must be used with --push [20:33:43]

2016-10-25 11:42:08	wallbroken	[20:35:24] ok, so i can directly use it client side [20:35:24]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	iq	[20:38:42] SviMik, Thank you. I'll give it a try. DNS Leak results on my iPhone  also failed :) [20:38:42]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	SviMik	[20:39:57] I doubt you can do something on iphone, unless you jailbreaked it [20:39:57]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	SviMik	[20:42:16] iq also, you can just set 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 as your default DNS. it will be used both with and without vpn then. [20:42:16]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	iq	[20:45:56] SviMik, Here are my test results - http://pastebin.com/ud0zeTcX [20:45:56]

2016-10-25 11:42:08	SviMik	[20:50:53] iq it says "might be". don't be paranoid. [20:50:53]
2016-10-25 11:42:08	SviMik	[20:51:18] and yes, it shows opendns. [20:51:18]

2016-10-25 13:49:47	wallbroken	[19:17:51] slypknot, the problem is that the openvpn tutorial is not very exaustive [19:17:51]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	wallbroken	[19:18:06] for example which is the path from where the proces has launced? [19:18:06]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	slypknot	[19:18:46] wallbroken: there is one single peice of actual advice i can offer: when the connect/disconnect script executes it does so as the openvpn --user [name] or root that you have configured .. it does not execute as your login tty or whatexver.  that means you need to use FULL paths to other bin/scripts you call [19:18:46]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	slypknot	[19:19:57] wallbroken: as for actual shell syntax itself .. you need to learn that language [19:19:57]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	Heraclmene	[19:23:37] krzee, Fixed it - had to push my local network's subnet (192.168.1.0/24) as a 'net_gateway' - otherwise it was trying to route the DNS and what not through the VPN [19:23:37]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	Heraclmene	[19:23:40] No workerino [19:23:40]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	Heraclmene	[19:24:46] Or just my router's IP address (192.168.1.1) :-) [19:24:46]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	slypknot	[19:25:15] 192.168.1.0/24 both ends ? [19:25:15]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	Heraclmene	[19:25:18] Nah [19:25:18]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	Heraclmene	[19:25:24] 10.0.1.0/24 on the other end [19:25:24]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	slypknot	[19:25:30] ok [19:25:30]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	slypknot	[19:26:50] his router crashed :) [19:26:50]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	slypknot	[19:27:15] wallbroken's router [19:27:15]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	slypknot	[19:27:37] i still see parts/joins [19:27:37]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	wallbroken	[19:33:43] ok, the problem was about path [19:33:43]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	wallbroken	[19:33:57] i used echo 1 > counter in the script [19:33:57]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	wallbroken	[19:34:04] and it was an issue [19:34:04]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	wallbroken	[19:34:18] because openvpn created the file in different random places [19:34:18]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	iq	[19:35:53] Hi, Got my OpenVPN server up and running on Raspberry Pi with user-id/password authentication. I am pushing Google and OpenDNS DNS from the server config file. I ran a "DNS Leak" test online and it seems to be complaining about DNS servers. I got same results on MacBook and iOS clients. Is this something to be concerned about? [19:35:53]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	slypknot	[19:36:00] wallbroken: like i explained :D [19:36:00]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	SviMik	[19:46:38] iq yes, unix machines need a special script for updating dns settings on client side [19:46:38]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	SviMik	[19:46:46] !dns [19:46:46]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	@vpnHelper	[19:46:47] "dns" is (#1) Level3 open recursive DNS server at 4.2.2.[1-6], or (#2) Google open recursive DNS server at 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4, or (#3) you might be looking for !pushdns [19:46:47]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	SviMik	[19:46:54] !pushdns [19:46:54]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	@vpnHelper	[19:46:55] "pushdns" is (#1) push dhcp-option DNS a.b.c.d to push dns to the client, or (#2) For pushing DNS to a Windows client, see: !windns, or (#3) Unix-alikes are required to process the env-var in an --up script; read about --dhcp-option in the manpage, or (#4) For distros that use resolvconf(8) you can try the pull-resolv-conf script under the contrib/ source dir, or (#5) Mobile Client like OpenVPN for [19:46:55]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	@vpnHelper	[19:46:56] Android and OpenVPN Connect will happily accept push dhcp-option [19:46:56]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	pixel6692	[20:16:05] Hello I have .ovpn file which works fine, but it creates routes on my system, is there way to modify config file so it would not add them? [20:16:05]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	pixel6692	[20:16:53] it creates 2 /1 routes so it routes all traffic through this tun, but I don't want this behaviour and would like routing by myself [20:16:53]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	zoredache	[20:22:57] pixel6692:  `--route-nopull` [20:22:57]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	zoredache	[20:23:07] in the client config. [20:23:07]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	pixel6692	[20:25:10] thank you very much [20:25:10]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	iq	[20:26:38] SviMik, I will do more research on "recursive DNS". Currently I am pushing 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 from OpenVPN server config and the client is accepting that change. It is just the DNSLeak test that is failing. [20:26:38]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	wallbroken	[20:30:16] is there a way to set a dns ip directly from client config? [20:30:16]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	SviMik	[20:33:12] wallbroken sure. add "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8" to the client config [20:33:12]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	wallbroken	[20:33:43] SviMik, on the manual it said that it must be used with --push [20:33:43]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	SviMik	[20:34:27] iq https://airvpn.org/topic/9608-how-to-accept-dns-push-on-linux-systems-with-resolvconf/ [20:34:27]

2016-10-25 13:49:47	SviMik	[20:34:58] wallbroken --push is server command [20:34:58]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	wallbroken	[20:35:24] ok, so i can directly use it client side [20:35:24]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	iq	[20:38:42] SviMik, Thank you. I'll give it a try. DNS Leak results on my iPhone  also failed :) [20:38:42]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	SviMik	[20:39:57] I doubt you can do something on iphone, unless you jailbreaked it [20:39:57]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	SviMik	[20:42:16] iq also, you can just set 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 as your default DNS. it will be used both with and without vpn then. [20:42:16]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	iq	[20:45:56] SviMik, Here are my test results - http://pastebin.com/ud0zeTcX [20:45:56]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	iq	[20:46:09] It seems their website is complaining about using Google and OpenDNS DNS servers. [20:46:09]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	SviMik	[20:50:53] iq it says "might be". don't be paranoid. [20:50:53]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	SviMik	[20:51:18] and yes, it shows opendns. [20:51:18]
2016-10-25 13:49:47	iq	[20:52:05] SviMik, I knew it was me. Thanks much for taking a look :) [20:52:05]

2016-10-25 15:33:50	SviMik	[20:39:57] I doubt you can do something on iphone, unless you jailbreaked it [20:39:57]
2016-10-25 15:33:50	SviMik	[20:42:16] iq also, you can just set 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 as your default DNS. it will be used both with and without vpn then. [20:42:16]

2016-10-25 17:57:04	wallbroken	[19:33:43] ok, the problem was about path [19:33:43]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	wallbroken	[19:33:57] i used echo 1 > counter in the script [19:33:57]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	wallbroken	[19:34:04] and it was an issue [19:34:04]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	wallbroken	[19:34:18] because openvpn created the file in different random places [19:34:18]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	iq	[19:35:53] Hi, Got my OpenVPN server up and running on Raspberry Pi with user-id/password authentication. I am pushing Google and OpenDNS DNS from the server config file. I ran a "DNS Leak" test online and it seems to be complaining about DNS servers. I got same results on MacBook and iOS clients. Is this something to be concerned about? [19:35:53]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	slypknot	[19:36:00] wallbroken: like i explained :D [19:36:00]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	SviMik	[19:46:38] iq yes, unix machines need a special script for updating dns settings on client side [19:46:38]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	SviMik	[19:46:46] !dns [19:46:46]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	@vpnHelper	[19:46:47] "dns" is (#1) Level3 open recursive DNS server at 4.2.2.[1-6], or (#2) Google open recursive DNS server at 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4, or (#3) you might be looking for !pushdns [19:46:47]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	SviMik	[19:46:54] !pushdns [19:46:54]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	@vpnHelper	[19:46:55] "pushdns" is (#1) push dhcp-option DNS a.b.c.d to push dns to the client, or (#2) For pushing DNS to a Windows client, see: !windns, or (#3) Unix-alikes are required to process the env-var in an --up script; read about --dhcp-option in the manpage, or (#4) For distros that use resolvconf(8) you can try the pull-resolv-conf script under the contrib/ source dir, or (#5) Mobile Client like OpenVPN for [19:46:55]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	@vpnHelper	[19:46:56] Android and OpenVPN Connect will happily accept push dhcp-option [19:46:56]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	pixel6692	[20:16:05] Hello I have .ovpn file which works fine, but it creates routes on my system, is there way to modify config file so it would not add them? [20:16:05]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	pixel6692	[20:16:53] it creates 2 /1 routes so it routes all traffic through this tun, but I don't want this behaviour and would like routing by myself [20:16:53]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	zoredache	[20:22:57] pixel6692:  `--route-nopull` [20:22:57]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	zoredache	[20:23:07] in the client config. [20:23:07]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	pixel6692	[20:25:10] thank you very much [20:25:10]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	iq	[20:26:38] SviMik, I will do more research on "recursive DNS". Currently I am pushing 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 from OpenVPN server config and the client is accepting that change. It is just the DNSLeak test that is failing. [20:26:38]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	wallbroken	[20:30:16] is there a way to set a dns ip directly from client config? [20:30:16]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	SviMik	[20:33:12] wallbroken sure. add "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8" to the client config [20:33:12]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	wallbroken	[20:33:43] SviMik, on the manual it said that it must be used with --push [20:33:43]

2016-10-26 01:52:48	@dazo	saybeano: the VPN clients needs just 4 files .... client config file, ca certificate, client certificate and the client key file.
2016-10-26 01:54:10	@dazo	saybeano: The easu-rsa files, and in particular the CA private key (ca.key in easy-rsa, iirc), should ideally be stored on an offline medium only to be activated when you need to issue a new certificate to a server or client.
2016-10-26 01:54:45	SviMik	dazo what's wrong with easy-rsa? I thought it is a part of openvpn package. at least, on Debian it was installed itself
2016-10-26 01:55:34	@dazo	SviMik: easy-rsa is fine ... but it should not be used on a publicly available server .... if you loose the control of the CA key, you can no longer trust any server or clients with certificates issued with that key file

2016-10-26 01:56:25	@dazo	SviMik: in addition, most VPSes today do not have a really good random generator ... so creating key files and DH params on most virtual machines will have far lower entropy than if you do that on physical hardware

2016-10-26 01:57:19	@dazo	SviMik: so the key files should be generated on bare metal and the easy-rsa (or any files related to CA management, in particular the CA private key) should not be accessible over the Internet
2016-10-26 01:57:34	SviMik	dazo how then to issue certificate automatically on user purchase? at least the certification server must have the keys and be online to achieve this goal
2016-10-26 01:58:39	@dazo	SviMik: there are many who do this in the wrong way .... and then those who do it in a good way usually have an HSM which helps the automation ... but a good HSM is expensive
2016-10-26 01:59:09	@dazo	(or these days, you have yubikey HSM and Nitrokey HSM ... but they're not so well suited when you have a lot of key signing)

2016-10-26 02:09:01	@dazo	SviMik: [CA/HSM] too little details to truly give a good answer here ... as long as the CA key file is well protected and can't be copied/downloaded from the Internet through an attack, then you're quite safe
2016-10-26 02:10:00	SviMik	home routers are for home. I can't make any warranty that it will work fine with 10+ users, and that you don't need to reboot it every week/month
2016-10-26 02:10:18	@dazo	SviMik: The advantage of the HSM is that it takes a command (for example: sign this CSR) ... and then it does the magic on its own and returns a certificate on success .... but the requester cannot obtain the CA private key used for the signing in any way
2016-10-26 02:11:06	SviMik	installing mikrotik at least I'm sure that I won't be called on weekends with question "why the internet gone?"
2016-10-26 02:11:30	@dazo	SviMik: [router] That depends mostly on how well the firmware works though ... and OpenWRT is fairly stable ... I've had OpenWRT routers being up 100% between upgrades

2016-10-26 02:13:56	@plaisthos	SviMik: you need the outdated version of mikrotek to test the weird stuff
2016-10-26 02:15:25	 *	SviMik still thinks D-Links, TP-Links and other Shit-Links are *not* for anything except home use
2016-10-26 02:15:25		[02:15]
2016-10-26 02:16:26	@dazo	D-Link, Netgear, Asus and similar ones, I can agree with ... but my TP-Link experience have been far beyond any expectations
2016-10-26 02:17:07	 *	SviMik still thinks DD-WRT, OpenWRT, and other DIY-WRT are not for production use
2016-10-26 02:17:44	jphoglund	that's pretty much my view too
2016-10-26 02:18:17	@dazo	SviMik: then you must reconsider the use of Linux in production too .... just say'in
2016-10-26 02:18:33	jphoglund	are there other reasonable commercial options than Ubiquiti and Mikrotik?
2016-10-26 02:19:04	@plaisthos	depends on what you want
2016-10-26 02:19:18	SviMik	dazo well, I don't use PC as routers either
2016-10-26 02:19:27	@plaisthos	there a good micro servers that give a good router
2016-10-26 02:19:33	@plaisthos	but they are more expensive
2016-10-26 02:19:50	@plaisthos	raspberry pi is also reasonable for some setups
2016-10-26 02:20:11	jphoglund	an openvpn gw to a server network for <100 users. and a basic firewall for the office connection.
2016-10-26 02:20:34	@dazo	SviMik: well, RouterOS is using Linux
2016-10-26 02:21:10	SviMik	dazo I thought it was unix-based. no?
2016-10-26 02:21:16	@plaisthos	d12fk can probably recommend his company's product :0

2016-10-26 02:22:04	SviMik	jphoglund Ubiquiti and Mikrotik are the best things if you need something close to commercial devices with a price close to home routers
2016-10-26 02:22:32	@dazo	(it wouldn't even surprise me if RouterOS is some kind of fork of OpenWRT, with their own proprietary addons on top of it)
2016-10-26 02:24:03	SviMik	dazo as I know, they did a lot themselves, even writing drivers and implementing protocols.
2016-10-26 02:24:42	wallbroken	dazo, i'm still on ignore?
2016-10-26 02:25:32	jphoglund	SviMik: right. thank you.
