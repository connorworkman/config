2016-10-17 16:01:35	@vpnHelper	"welcome" is (#1) Start by stating your !goal, such as 'I would like to access the internet over my vpn', or (#2) New to IRC? see the link in !ask, or (#3) We may need you to !paste your !logs and !configs and maybe !interface to help you, or (#4) See !howto for beginners, or (#5) See !route for lans behind openvpn, or (#6) !redirect for sending inet traffic through the server, or (#7) Also
2016-10-17 16:01:36	@vpnHelper	interesting: !man !/30 !topology !iporder !sample !forum !wiki !mitm, or (#8) Don't use 192.168.1.0/24 or 192.168.0.0/24 (too much potential for conflict), or (#9) And again, if you think you need !tap, you're probably wrong
2016-10-17 16:02:18	ScotchYip	!goal
2016-10-17 16:02:19	@vpnHelper	"goal" is Please clearly state your goal for your vpn: example, I would like to access the lan behind the server , I would like to access the internet over my vpn , I just want a secure connection between 2 computers , etc
2016-10-17 16:04:02	ScotchYip	Okay.  :)  I'll try to summarize my goal:  I'm running OpenVPN on OpenBSD 6 inside a VM, behind a pfsense firewall.  After 2 days, I got the server configured, client files fixed, and was able to connect through the iOS OpenVPN client over LTE to the server.
2016-10-17 16:05:51	ScotchYip	My VMs are all in the 10.0.3.x address space, and I've allocated 10.0.4.x for all VPN clients.  The snag seems to be that while I'm able to connect (iPhone on LTE -> static IP on firewall -> VM host -> OpenVPN) I can only ping 10.0.4.1 -- but nothing on the 10.0.3.x subnet.
2016-10-17 16:07:55	ScotchYip	I've added an IP alias (ifconfig em0 alias 10.0.4.2 255.255.255.0) and I'l also able to ping that.  I've configured the OS for port forwarding (net.inet.ip.forwarding=1) but packets don't seem to be able to traverse from 10.0.4.x to 10.0.3.x.
2016-10-17 16:08:34	ScotchYip	In this case, I shouldn't need a bridge, because I really only have one network device, with an aliased IP.  (I'm open to being corrected on this point though.)
2016-10-17 16:09:31	ScotchYip	I'm wondering if I need to alter my VM config to include a SECOND network adapter, assign THAT port to 10.0.4.x, and then build a bridge from there.
2016-10-17 16:11:07	ScotchYip	Or, if I can get away with fixing my subnet mask so that both 10.0.3.x and 10.0.4.x are grouped together...  Like, 255.255.254.0 or something similar.
2016-10-17 16:11:47	ScotchYip	I'm heading to bed for the night, I'll check back in tomorrow morning.

2016-10-17 21:03:37	@ecrist	[22:31:31] no idea [22:31:31]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@ecrist	[22:31:40] best to ask in !openvpn-as [22:31:40]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	kronos003	[00:10:35] so I got the webmin module completely working. But I've realized it doesnt handle ipv6 or Firewalld. These are things I'll work on as I get time, but in the meantime I have a webmin module that sorta works (no firewall control or ipv6 routing baked in just yet. [00:10:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@ecrist	[00:22:10] You wrote the module? [00:22:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@ecrist	[00:22:16] Webmin is still a thing? [00:22:16]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:01:33] !welcome [02:01:33]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@vpnHelper	[02:01:35] "welcome" is (#1) Start by stating your !goal, such as 'I would like to access the internet over my vpn', or (#2) New to IRC? see the link in !ask, or (#3) We may need you to !paste your !logs and !configs and maybe !interface to help you, or (#4) See !howto for beginners, or (#5) See !route for lans behind openvpn, or (#6) !redirect for sending inet traffic through the server, or (#7) Also [02:01:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@vpnHelper	[02:01:36] interesting: !man !/30 !topology !iporder !sample !forum !wiki !mitm, or (#8) Don't use 192.168.1.0/24 or 192.168.0.0/24 (too much potential for conflict), or (#9) And again, if you think you need !tap, you're probably wrong [02:01:36]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:02:18] !goal [02:02:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	@vpnHelper	[02:02:19] "goal" is Please clearly state your goal for your vpn: example, I would like to access the lan behind the server , I would like to access the internet over my vpn , I just want a secure connection between 2 computers , etc [02:02:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:04:02] Okay.  :)  I'll try to summarize my goal:  I'm running OpenVPN on OpenBSD 6 inside a VM, behind a pfsense firewall.  After 2 days, I got the server configured, client files fixed, and was able to connect through the iOS OpenVPN client over LTE to the server. [02:04:02]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:05:51] My VMs are all in the 10.0.3.x address space, and I've allocated 10.0.4.x for all VPN clients.  The snag seems to be that while I'm able to connect (iPhone on LTE -> static IP on firewall -> VM host -> OpenVPN) I can only ping 10.0.4.1 -- but nothing on the 10.0.3.x subnet. [02:05:51]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:07:55] I've added an IP alias (ifconfig em0 alias 10.0.4.2 255.255.255.0) and I'l also able to ping that.  I've configured the OS for port forwarding (net.inet.ip.forwarding=1) but packets don't seem to be able to traverse from 10.0.4.x to 10.0.3.x. [02:07:55]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:08:34] In this case, I shouldn't need a bridge, because I really only have one network device, with an aliased IP.  (I'm open to being corrected on this point though.) [02:08:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:09:31] I'm wondering if I need to alter my VM config to include a SECOND network adapter, assign THAT port to 10.0.4.x, and then build a bridge from there. [02:09:31]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:11:07] Or, if I can get away with fixing my subnet mask so that both 10.0.3.x and 10.0.4.x are grouped together...  Like, 255.255.254.0 or something similar. [02:11:07]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ScotchYip	[02:11:47] I'm heading to bed for the night, I'll check back in tomorrow morning. [02:11:47]

2016-10-18 02:19:54	ScotchYip	Please be aware that the OpenVPN Connect app on iOS doesn't support the "HMAC Firewall", so if you try to follow the instructions to create and use "ta.key", you'll never be able to successfully authenticate.
2016-10-18 02:20:08	@ecrist	Or, you may contact OpenVPN Technologies - they might be able to work out a licensing arrangement.

2016-10-18 02:30:39	ScotchYip	ecrist:  I'm having trouble finding the article, but it said that HMAC on iOS wasn't supported (although it didn't really give a reason).  When I removed all of the tls parameters (tls-server/tls-auth/etc.) it suddenly worked perfectly.
2016-10-18 02:31:08	@ecrist	well, that just demonstrates you had configuration issues
2016-10-18 02:31:32	@ecrist	it doesn't demonstrate or back up that HMAC isn't supported, despite how flippant your response was
2016-10-18 02:31:38	ScotchYip	ecrist:  Although, I see an article that says it wasn't supported before 1.0.5, so it was true at one point.
2016-10-18 02:31:53	@ecrist	even that's not true
2016-10-18 02:32:06	@ecrist	the FAQ points out a change in how key direction was modified between 1.0 and 1.1
2016-10-18 02:32:25	ScotchYip	 TLS-Remote is not supported in the app version (1.0.0).
2016-10-18 02:32:25	ScotchYip	With app version 1.0.5 TLS works.
2016-10-18 02:32:27	@ecrist	sorry, 1.0.0 and 1.0.1

2016-10-18 02:36:41	@vpnHelper	Joo got it.
2016-10-18 02:36:43	ScotchYip	I also see that they've changed the 'key-direction' as well.  And that's not set in my config files, so I'll add that to my instructions.
2016-10-18 02:37:32	ScotchYip	Does key-direction need to be on both client and server?
2016-10-18 02:37:35	@ecrist	I mentioned that, above.  And cited that as evidence there was HMAC support in 1.0.0
2016-10-18 02:37:50	@ecrist	yes - see the man page about the usage
2016-10-18 02:37:53	ScotchYip	Yup.  Understood...
2016-10-18 02:37:57	@ecrist	each end needs to be opposite
2016-10-18 02:38:05	@ecrist	so, if the clients use 1, the server uses 0
2016-10-18 02:38:08	@ecrist	or vice-versa
2016-10-18 02:38:09	ScotchYip	Yeah, I did that.
2016-10-18 02:38:35	ScotchYip	But it sounds like 'bidirectional' is the appropriate/preferred option.
2016-10-18 02:39:16	SviMik	plaisthos I will ask programmers what exactly they did, and if some license requires publishing the source code - I'll ask them to do so. right now even we don't have the code (we have ordered the app from another company, and not 100% sure what they used)

2016-10-18 02:39:30	honigkuchen	acrist paisthos if I use another vpn configuration that let all traffic of the client run through the vpn server, then I can access all tun IPs of the server, but not if I use a vpn server that does that not
2016-10-18 02:39:53	@ecrist	bidirectional isn't a valid argument in the openvpn server/client
2016-10-18 02:40:45	@ecrist	honigkuchen: then you service needs to listen to a routed IP
2016-10-18 02:41:26	SviMik	plaisthos from what I can see in apk, there is libopenvpn.so, libopvpnutil.so, libcrypto.so, libssl.so. -- I'm 99% sure they took something open-source, and not even touched it...

2016-10-18 03:00:35	SviMik	plaisthos ok, I will ask the programmers to check the license and publish the source code if it is required. can we *completely* close the Android question now, cause it is REALLY hard to me to track two discussions at same time?

2016-10-18 03:01:01	SviMik	^_^
2016-10-18 03:01:26	@plaisthos	or buy a license to keep the UI part closed sourced
2016-10-18 03:05:51	SviMik	so the vpn api in ios is not closed, and appstore will allow to publish such app if we write the vpn thing from scratch?
2016-10-18 03:06:42	@ecrist	sounds like it, yeah
2016-10-18 03:08:32	SviMik	but we can use GPL code like ics as well if we publish the app code later?

2016-10-18 03:26:42	ScotchYip	Okay.  The problem with the HMAC authentication was two-fold...
2016-10-18 03:27:17	ScotchYip	1)  I was using a unified file, and I was missing the 'key-direction' parameter before the <tls-auth> section.
2016-10-18 03:27:58	ScotchYip	2)  The example I saw on setting the auth option inside the configuration file had the HMAC wrapped in single quotes.
2016-10-18 03:28:30	ScotchYip	(So the client was saying 'SHA256' isn't supported...  And I thought the quotes were from the error message, but they were in the config file.)

2016-10-18 03:44:24	ScotchYip	Here's my network architecture:
2016-10-18 03:47:11	@ecrist	it looks bleak
2016-10-18 03:47:40	ScotchYip	I'm running OpenVPN on OpenBSD 6 inside a VM, behind a pfsense firewall. My VMs are all in the 10.0.3.x address space, and I've allocated 10.0.4.x for all VPN clients.  Can get away with fixing my subnet mask so that both 10.0.3.x and 10.0.4.x are grouped together...  Like, 255.255.254.0 or something similar, and skip the explicit routing altogether?
2016-10-18 03:48:15	@ecrist	now, that's just lazy
2016-10-18 03:48:32	@ecrist	no, you shouldn't do that
2016-10-18 03:48:37	SviMik	skip the routing \\ use tap :D
2016-10-18 03:48:41	ScotchYip	All of the VMs on the 10.0.3.x space are perfectly fine to be exposed to VPN users (in fact, it's preferable in most cases).
2016-10-18 03:48:43	@ecrist	since there is a distinct router for the 10.0.4.0/24 subnet

2016-10-18 03:51:05	@ecrist	shortcuts you take today in setting up your vpn will just cause problems later.
2016-10-18 03:51:19	ScotchYip	Back before auto-rejoin, so you had to type the command to join the channel again.  It was like an actual punishment.  ;)
2016-10-18 03:51:21	@ecrist	SviMik: too many people use it for the wrong reasons.
2016-10-18 03:52:06	ScotchYip	So is making a big subnet somewhere between t*p and routing in terms of lazyness?
2016-10-18 03:53:21	ScotchYip	Hrm.  Although, I'm thinking...  The risk is extraordinarily small, but someone could have their phone stolen, and that might provide unrestricted access to my other VMs.

2016-10-18 03:54:03	ScotchYip	Which isn't truly an issue, since each VM is pretty much locked down.
2016-10-18 03:54:11	SviMik	the t*p is L2, which has such problems as arp spoofing, multicast flood, etc
2016-10-18 03:55:18	SviMik	sure, all the problems can be solved if you know how and what to filter

2016-10-18 03:58:12	ScotchYip	Oh, I know quite a bit about TCP/IP...  It's the firewalls that I'm not super familiar with.  I've been lucky/spoiled by the fact that it's usually someone else's problem.  ;)

2016-10-18 05:13:55	@vpnHelper	interesting: !man !/30 !topology !iporder !sample !forum !wiki !mitm, or (#8) Don't use 192.168.1.0/24 or 192.168.0.0/24 (too much potential for conflict), or (#9) And again, if you think you need !tap, you're probably wrong

2016-10-18 05:33:39	rob0	um, in some cases NAT is necessary: to provide access for RFC 1918 networks to the Internet
2016-10-18 05:33:51	rob0	maybe you are thinking of:
2016-10-18 05:33:54	rob0	!nathack
2016-10-18 05:33:55	@vpnHelper	"nathack" is see https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/NatHack for info on how to solve the problem when you need !route_outside_ovpn but cant add a route to the gateway or the lan machines
2016-10-18 05:35:19	rob0	Generally if you are setting up a complex VPN, you should spend the small amount of money required to replace cheap routers with better ones.
2016-10-18 05:36:25	wallbroken	thank rob0
2016-10-18 05:36:40	wallbroken	the problem is in some complex architecture, you have many gateways
2016-10-18 05:37:06	wallbroken	so using routing, you need to go packets loop over the network
2016-10-18 05:37:11	wallbroken	generating many traffic

2016-10-18 13:26:50	fearnothing	the verbosity thing was because I was reading stackoverflow :P bad idea all around.
2016-10-18 13:27:42	fearnothing	turns out I am getting the auth failed messages but because of the method I'm using to view the syslog output, the messages weren't visible immediately (syslog -> logstash -> elasticsearch)
