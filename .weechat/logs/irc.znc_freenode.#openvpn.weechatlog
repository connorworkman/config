2016-10-17 14:10:35	kronos003	so I got the webmin module completely working. But I've realized it doesnt handle ipv6 or Firewalld. These are things I'll work on as I get time, but in the meantime I have a webmin module that sorta works (no firewall control or ipv6 routing baked in just yet.

2016-10-17 14:22:10	@ecrist	You wrote the module?
2016-10-17 14:22:16	@ecrist	Webmin is still a thing?
