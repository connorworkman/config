2016-09-16 01:55:39	lentferj	I can't build on debian jessie anymore because of
2016-09-16 01:55:41	lentferj	Checking for 'libarchive' >= 3.0.0                   : not found
2016-09-16 01:56:25	lentferj	which is strange, I think because of:
2016-09-16 01:56:27	lentferj	ii  libarchive1                                                 2.8.0-2kxstudio0.1                          amd64        Single library to read/write tar, cpio, pax, zip, iso9660, etc.
2016-09-16 01:56:31	lentferj	ii  libarchive13:amd64                                          3.1.2-11+deb8u2                             amd64        Multi-format archive and compression library (shared library)
2016-09-16 01:57:52	Headwar	you need the -dev version of the lib
2016-09-16 01:58:21	lentferj	well, there is none... and I built all versions of ardour since 4.x w/o problems
2016-09-16 01:58:26	Headwar	sudo apt install libarchive-dev
2016-09-16 01:58:38	Headwar	It's a new dependency
2016-09-16 01:59:05	Headwar	w/r to rgareus latest work
2016-09-16 01:59:06	lentferj	ah... there is.. need new glasses
2016-09-16 01:59:13	Headwar	;) should be ok now
2016-09-16 01:59:27	Headwar	redo a waf -configure
2016-09-16 02:00:12	lentferj	I searched for libarchive1-dev (c&p the libarchive1, adding -dev).. bleh
2016-09-16 02:00:12		[02:00]
2016-09-16 02:00:43	lentferj	so, what's that latest work adding?
2016-09-16 02:01:12	Headwar	I guess it's to open demo songs, with all the files wrapped into a single zip file
2016-09-16 02:02:41	lentferj	build runs now... thanks for the pointer :)
2016-09-16 02:02:49	Headwar	anyway this libarchive addition could be usefull someday to make archiving of sessions
2016-09-16 02:02:52	Headwar	np ;)

2016-09-16 08:47:01	rgareus	yottanami: some distros can do that setup for you, e.g. debian based ones     sudo dpkg-reconfigure -p jackd   (or jackd2)
2016-09-16 08:51:40	yottanami	rgareus, I am using Debian and I was using jackd and changed it to jackd2
2016-09-16 08:52:29	rgareus	the "Cannot lock memory" and "cannot acquire realtime"  indicates that you opted out of jack realtime permissions when installing jack.
2016-09-16 08:53:45	yottanami	rgareus, I tried dpkg-reconfigure and I got this message http://dpaste.com/39H4KCF

2016-09-16 08:59:39	rgareus	tom-: rv, ref = fun (ok)
2016-09-16 08:59:45	yottanami	If you want to run jackd with realtime priorities, the user starting jackd needs realtime permissions. Accept this option to create the file /etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf, granting realtime priority and memlock privileges to the audio group.
2016-09-16 09:00:48	rgareus	tom-: if it helps: you can think of  closures as constants.  it must be possible to replace    fun(...) with a a constant value

2016-09-16 10:41:10	OvenWerks	monitor moute should be off and no channels should have solo on.
2016-09-16 10:41:20	OvenWerks	youki: ^^
2016-09-16 10:41:30	tom-	rgareus: if the session is using a vst plugin, maybe, yes, an edge-case. that can be solved by the script
2016-09-16 10:41:35	OvenWerks	s/moute/mute/
2016-09-16 10:42:21	tom-	rgareus: the session won't crash and the most important plugin types lv2 and luaproc are served. it's a benefit believe me :)
2016-09-16 10:42:22	rgareus	tom-: LV2 plugin names are also translatable
2016-09-16 10:42:40	youki	OvenWerks, all of this is the case
2016-09-16 10:42:50	tom-	rgareus: ..by_name() does not search for plugin names anywhere, just port names
2016-09-16 10:43:09	rgareus	tom-: port-names are for human users to read.  at least in all plugin specs that I know.  they're not for a machine to be used as lookup
2016-09-16 10:43:11	tom-	rgareus: the plugin of interest is passed to the method as a pointer (i think)
2016-09-16 10:43:29	tom-	rgareus: but you're right this would be the next step. after ports, find a plugin by name
2016-09-16 10:43:39	tom-	it does not sound absurd to me
2016-09-16 10:44:04	youki	OvenWerks, i mean : activate montitoring section in Properties = no sound even if the routing is correct, deactivate it = Master to 1/2 and sound
2016-09-16 10:44:39	youki	so again there is a problem between Master and Monitoring
2016-09-16 10:44:46	tom-	rgareus: think "look up human name" and let your doubts go
2016-09-16 10:45:03	OvenWerks	youki: ya, I got that... I am trying to figure why with what you have given me so far :)
2016-09-16 10:45:14	tom-	rgareus: that's the usecase. get a port or plugin by name, as "advertised" in the gui. doesn't that make sense.

2016-09-16 10:51:34	tom-	rgareus: now how waas that with remote track id .. it's just an index (that even changes when a track is hidden). the only thing to grab it is the trackname. which again is a human name. the thing to get a handle on track
2016-09-16 10:51:36	OvenWerks	ouch
2016-09-16 10:52:03	tom-	rgareus: same thing. an alternative would be to have uuids that do not change over time

2016-09-16 10:54:17	youki	Ok, so it doesn't want any plugin in the processor section of the Montitoring

2016-09-16 10:54:44	tom-	rgareus: please give the ..by_name() methods a chance. the correct thing to do with uuid for tracks and plugins and ports is another chapter
2016-09-16 10:56:01	OvenWerks	youki: I can put processors in here in the monitor section.
2016-09-16 10:56:06	tom-	the script refers to track "guitar", but it was changed to "kitar". kind of a localization. script will fail or rely on changing index of track
2016-09-16 10:56:46	tom-	instead, it could create a track or get a handle to it via index or name, and then remember its uuid 
2016-09-16 10:56:50	OvenWerks	tom-: localization has to be done pre-compile... I think. I do not think track name would change.
2016-09-16 10:56:57	tom-	that wont change during the lifecycle of "thing"
2016-09-16 10:57:17	youki	OvenWerks, yeak, i usually can do it as well. So i guess i have two solutions, 1/ i don't use a monitoring section : not practical - 2/ i create a new session and copy all the setting by hand before to import the regions from the current session. I already have an headache just thinking about it
2016-09-16 10:57:21	tom-	and of course access/manipulate "thing" by uuid
2016-09-16 10:57:34	youki	OvenWerks, thanks for trying to help anyway
2016-09-16 10:57:51	tom-	it's totally irrelevant how and where "thing" is sorted in
2016-09-16 10:57:59	tom-	and how it's localized even
2016-09-16 10:58:18	OvenWerks	youki: no problem... I am still wondering to myself why that would be.
2016-09-16 10:58:30	tom-	for now, .._by_name() seemed the most pragmatic method

2016-09-16 11:50:26	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: The problem is not "by-string". It's that the name is not stable enough to be a reliable reference.
2016-09-16 11:50:49	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: do you agree it *can be* a usecase to reference things as ".. i would like the user to see .. user-friendly text" ??
2016-09-16 11:51:09	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: I cannot parse your sentence
2016-09-16 11:51:25	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: you said ""how I would like the user to see  that port designated with an user-friendly text"

2016-09-16 11:51:53	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: do you agree that someone could want to use that friendly text as a reference to that thing.
2016-09-16 11:51:55	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Yes, but that's not a name->port mapping, but the reverse

2016-09-16 11:52:34	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: if you agree, i'd like why you thing looking up a plugin parameter by name is not a viable method
2016-09-16 11:52:37	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: There might even not be any guarantee that the names are unique...
2016-09-16 11:53:35	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: that's not at question
2016-09-16 11:54:16	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: IOW, the plugin gives the host a port->name mapping, that might or might not be one-to-one, and is certainly not constant across systems where the session can be shared/loaded and you want to derive a name->port out of it.
2016-09-16 11:54:33	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: we make different base assumptions i guess. i think i'd like to lookup by an id that doesn't change. yes i do. but i also do want to lookup by a name that's displayed to the user, that can change. i do that too.
2016-09-16 11:55:24	tom-	its too easy to agree on that usecase
2016-09-16 11:55:26	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: That friendly text could thus be, only when uniqueness is ensured, a *time-limited* reference to the thing
2016-09-16 11:55:38	tom-	i have to add some twist to make it riddle-worthy for geeks :)
2016-09-16 11:56:05	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: That's not very good, and bad enough for reliability that it was prohibited
2016-09-16 11:56:27	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Nobody wants a session that breaks just because it was loaded on a different locale
2016-09-16 11:57:01	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: define "reliable"
2016-09-16 11:57:16	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: the user wants to select the port by its user-friendly name (in a dropdown), but expects that afterwards the selected port will be matched correctly even if the locale changes

2016-09-16 11:59:13	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: but again, users don't expect that it would be just a textual match. They designate the *port* itself by choosing its name. They do that for 50 tracks, then save, and their buddy with another locale has to redo the port selection all over again at session load ?

2016-09-16 12:03:06	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: it does what it promises. looking up by a name.
2016-09-16 12:03:14	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: it does that reliably.

2016-09-16 12:03:49	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: But remembering the name is not a reliable way to reference a port

2016-09-16 12:30:21	tom-	name that can change  is not a reliable way to uniquely identify it, but it can reliably  tell if a looked up name exists or not
2016-09-16 12:31:03	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: a) users could have wrong expectations: I just meant that a lookup_by_* api will be used by scripts, and then users might be surprised/upset if the lookup doesn't work sometimes yet works other times because names are changing.
2016-09-16 12:31:36	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: it is obvious in the reference, that is generated from the source (comments)
2016-09-16 12:31:57	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: you can't do anything lua without looking there if not using examples and not exceding what they do
2016-09-16 12:32:36	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: rgareus ok that makes it b and c left. i'd like to know if this is correct or missing another aspect

2016-09-16 12:33:08	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: I really see "lookup by name" as a one-shot lookup to get a port id which will be the correct reference afterwards (and that one would be saved)

2016-09-16 13:05:33	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: The problem is « there can be cases where you exactly want that: lookup by name »
2016-09-16 13:05:44	rgareus	just so that I can move on to more important things:  there won't be a core function  loookup_by_name()  for names that are not fixed nor unique.
2016-09-16 13:05:51	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: You didn't give any compelling reasons that it's wanted
2016-09-16 13:05:52	tom-	i'd like you to agree that this intention to lookup by name isn't violating the plugin naming rules
2016-09-16 13:06:03	tom-	that would let us scratch b)
2016-09-16 13:06:43	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: And rgareus gave good reasons that it's actually bad to have that, because it's not a lookup (the word implies some mapping/reliability/reproducability) but a search
2016-09-16 13:08:01	tom-	does it?
2016-09-16 13:08:06	_FrnchFrgg_	(at least to me, lookup feels more like getElementById than "search")
2016-09-16 13:08:26	tom-	lookup isn't even part of the method name
2016-09-16 13:08:37	tom-	get_bla_by_name. 
2016-09-16 13:08:52	_FrnchFrgg_	And it would even more if there are other "lookup_by" that are reliable
2016-09-16 13:09:12	tom-	you can call get_bla(_by_index) and set a wrong index. spectacular
2016-09-16 13:09:44	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: My problem is that I think your use cases *will* break when the names change (I can't be sure since you didn't tell them clearly).
2016-09-16 13:10:55	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: So putting that in the API will encourage people to use it *even with warnings* for quick/dirty things, and then there will be a lot of unreliable scripts in the wild
2016-09-16 13:11:18	tom-	you ponder on something i thought we have sorted out
2016-09-16 13:11:47	tom-	i'd like to scratch b) or get facts
2016-09-16 13:11:52	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: I don't know if that's rgareus reasoning but anyway I think he told his last call so I'm not sure if there is anything to continue
2016-09-16 13:13:08	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: if that's your last call, then yes :)
2016-09-16 13:13:43	tom-	it's still unsolved for me. unfinished discussion, due to fade-away of participants
2016-09-16 13:13:44	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: I'm not the one to convince here, and you didn't succeed in convincing the one that can decide
2016-09-16 13:14:00	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: rgareus didn't fade away.
2016-09-16 13:15:38	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: and I'm the only other participant apart you, so I'm not sure what's your point.
2016-09-16 13:16:50	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: rgareus just stopped trying to convince you
2016-09-16 13:17:00	tom-	it's a pitty rgareus removed the most interesting part of my commit, and his reasoning wasn't reasonable for me. tracking it down to facts shows to be impossible atm.
2016-09-16 13:19:14	tom-	that's all. having that removed for no good reason is what drives my lust to ask for facts.
2016-09-16 13:19:30	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: it's a fact that he has a lot of experience about plugin specs and their quality; it's a fact that he thinks that part wasn't good enough to stay. Sure that's an argument of authority but he/I also tried to give "factual" reasons
2016-09-16 13:19:30		[13:19]
2016-09-16 13:20:02	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: That you all quickly, unilaterally, and without enough pondering (IMHO) decided were n/a
2016-09-16 13:21:12	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: That's not how a reasoning is made. Again, you manage consensus as if it were a fight, with positions to overthrow and take control of.
2016-09-16 13:21:23	_FrnchFrgg_	eliminate a), then b) then I win
2016-09-16 13:21:56	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: At least it felt like that to me
2016-09-16 13:22:21	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: I don't know you enough to tell if that's how you are or just a misunderstanding from me
2016-09-16 13:22:32	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Or a problem due to the IRC medium
2016-09-16 13:22:53	rgareus	tom-: I gave you lots of good reasons.
2016-09-16 13:23:10	tom-	not sure about the "i win" part. it would be "we win". but having a list of stuff to not randomly jump to other stacks is probably not the worst thing to do, don't you think.

2016-09-16 13:30:26	kurumin	_FrnchFrgg_, Yes, it is explained in the TRANLATORS file. But it does not work. I tried several times...
2016-09-16 13:30:49	kurumin	Should I copy manually?
2016-09-16 13:30:56	kurumin	from other language?

2016-09-16 13:31:28	_FrnchFrgg_	kurumin: But there should be a .pot file
2016-09-16 13:31:33	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: a last question on the topic. why do you think doing the same thing in the script would be a better idea than having a function in the lua api that just does that?
2016-09-16 13:31:35	_FrnchFrgg_	kurumin: That's the one you should copy
2016-09-16 13:31:54	_FrnchFrgg_	kurumin: Of course you can copy an other language file, and clean it, but that's more work
2016-09-16 13:32:20	kurumin	there is no pot file in the libs/ardour/po folder...

2016-09-16 13:37:01	kurumin	_FrnchFrgg_, Thanks!!
2016-09-16 13:37:39	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Because if you want to write a script with a loop that can easily break, nobody will prevent you. And you might happen to be sure it will always be used in a controlled environment so that it will always work
2016-09-16 13:38:06	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: But promoting it into an official API doesn't have the same standard
2016-09-16 13:38:45	rgareus	_FrnchFrgg_: I know little about translations
2016-09-16 13:38:45	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: you seem to imply that "it can break" now.

2016-09-16 13:43:32	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: it can break == you select a port using a name, save the session on a usb key, open it on another computer with a different locale or even different config that affects port names, and now your plugin is no longer useful unless you change the name to match, ad nauseam if you exchange back and forth
2016-09-16 13:44:03	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: the same happens if a plugin is missing. news at 1:42
2016-09-16 13:44:08	_FrnchFrgg_	and since it's the plugin (thus completely out of our control) that chooses the names, it can change for a lot of reasons
2016-09-16 13:44:14	rgareus	or a plugin can also have a two ports with the same name.
2016-09-16 13:44:50	tom-	not of the same type i guess, or yes?
2016-09-16 13:44:53	rgareus	heck, we're still at this and I have not even heard a good reason why one would want to look-up ports by name in the first place
2016-09-16 13:44:56	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: I already told that argument (duplicate names).
2016-09-16 13:45:04	tom-	can i have two input ports names foo? fantastic
2016-09-16 13:45:21	rgareus	tom-: you can have tree
2016-09-16 13:45:24	rgareus	three*
2016-09-16 13:45:29	rgareus	if that makes you happy
2016-09-16 13:45:41	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Since the name is for display, the plugin can ask for all its ports to have the same name...
2016-09-16 13:45:48	tom-	i want at least 42 you should now
2016-09-16 13:45:49	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: The host won't care
2016-09-16 13:45:49	rgareus	and all 3 can be "pink foo", too
2016-09-16 13:46:04	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Of course I don't expect plugins to do that, but
2016-09-16 13:46:20	tom-	the methods need to be renamed ... _first_found__
2016-09-16 13:46:39	rgareus	except in French it'll be fôô :)
2016-09-16 13:46:41	tom-	there is that variable for small screens. we could do similar
2016-09-16 13:46:42	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: But why add a method if there is almost no user ?
2016-09-16 13:47:51	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: try to look at it generically
2016-09-16 13:47:57	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: To me it's the exact same discussion as for plugins that only display text in the processor box, and don't process anything, and their need for API that no other plugin uses

2016-09-16 13:49:51	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: But you didn't yet make a case for why it would be great to add it. We cannot pollute the API with all methods that we can imagine could be useful one day

2016-09-16 13:49:56	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: point being, it needs a facility to lookup a port or plugin by name
2016-09-16 13:50:42	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Point is you think it needs it. We don't, and you didn't succeed (nor really provide real arguments) to convince us.
2016-09-16 13:51:13	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: if you look at it generically, the decision is made. you must have good reasons for not having that facility.
2016-09-16 13:51:23	rgareus	a *generic* API for a very special case?   find_first_parameter_with_given_display_name_if_any()    that's an oxymoron.
2016-09-16 13:51:37	rgareus	can we please stop this?
2016-09-16 13:51:48	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: To me you didn't come up with any reasoning that "generically it's a no brainer"
2016-09-16 13:51:49	tom-	just one last answer, for the usecase
2016-09-16 13:52:06	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: IOW, to me the burden of proof is still on you
2016-09-16 13:52:10	tom-	the usecase is obvious: looking up a parameter by a name which index could change
2016-09-16 13:52:26	tom-	or does not change, but i know the name for sure
2016-09-16 13:52:42	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Anyway, it's very late here (almost 2am) so I'll have to call it quits, sorry
2016-09-16 13:53:10	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: You don't know the name for sure
2016-09-16 13:53:22	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: the one i want to lookup? yes, i know it
2016-09-16 13:53:24	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: That point was made again and again.
2016-09-16 13:53:42	tom-	yes :) but we have difficulties to get common ground on distinction :)
2016-09-16 13:53:42	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: No, you know the name in one locale/configuration
2016-09-16 13:54:06	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Which is less stable than the parameter index
2016-09-16 13:54:33	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Which will only change if the plugin is updated and changed its port order
2016-09-16 13:54:36	tom-	it doesn't make it more right if you ponder on stable or break
2016-09-16 13:55:07	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: And then if the plugin is updated, display names could change as much too
2016-09-16 13:57:02	tom-	yes, it'd not an id. yes, it's a name that can change. yes, we need to be able to look it up. yes, it is not better or worse than using an index for that.
2016-09-16 13:57:54	tom-	yes, a name can be more useful in a script than a number
2016-09-16 13:58:01	_FrnchFrgg_	indices are guaranteed to be unique, so I wouldn't say that names are not worse
2016-09-16 13:58:05	tom-	yes, a script should not be machine-centric in the first place
2016-09-16 13:58:29	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Is there a search by name API in other DAWs ?
2016-09-16 13:58:43	tom-	when did the first man go to moon?
2016-09-16 13:59:06	rgareus	please stop this nonsense
2016-09-16 13:59:14	tom-	i'm sure they could already do it back then
2016-09-16 13:59:21	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: That definitely have the user as the center of their scripts, so actually care about not being machine-centric and usefulness and easiness of use
2016-09-16 13:59:53	rgareus	a script is a program which should do a task reliably.
2016-09-16 14:00:05	tom-	better nobly stay in the bg
2016-09-16 14:00:16	rgareus	"machine-centric" and words like that have no meaning.

2016-09-16 14:01:09	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: I agree with rgareus. A script that works once in a session then doesn't anymore is broken, and the API shouldn't give users sticks to beat themselves with

2016-09-16 14:02:20	_FrnchFrgg_	And big warnings won't prevent that better than not adding the API in the first place
2016-09-16 14:02:51	_FrnchFrgg_	I mean adding an API with comments *DON'T use this API and expect it to reliably return the port you're looking for*
2016-09-16 14:02:55	_FrnchFrgg_	Really ?
2016-09-16 14:03:09	_FrnchFrgg_	Why not adding an API and deprecating it at the same time ?
2016-09-16 14:03:16	_FrnchFrgg_	That would be fun too
2016-09-16 14:03:29	tom-	why do you want to warn about anything?
2016-09-16 14:04:22	tom-	you can on every plugin startup tell the user that his or her automation will probably break if the same plugin will be installed with a differen param name set
2016-09-16 14:04:49	tom-	if name or count, index or names have changed
2016-09-16 14:05:02	tom-	your arguments aren't wrong but i think they address a larger issue
2016-09-16 14:05:02		[14:05]
2016-09-16 14:05:03	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Else script writers (which are users, probably even not proficient in programming), will use the API, and wonder why their very good session that's their life and salary just broke when run in the client/boss studio when it worked perfectly in their own
2016-09-16 14:05:57	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: in that case: what is different exactly?
2016-09-16 14:06:07	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: a localized vst parameter name?
2016-09-16 14:06:08	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Changing the locale is far more benign than having different versions of plugins
2016-09-16 14:06:15	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: or can it be anything else?
2016-09-16 14:06:19	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Or missing a plugin altogether
2016-09-16 14:06:40	tom-	as i said, you're addressing larger issues enclosing by_name()
2016-09-16 14:08:20	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Anyway, I really need sleep. (And the fact that sessions are not always portable is partly addressed by bundled plugins, and the fact that there problems exist doesn't make other portability problems like the one here less relevant)
2016-09-16 14:08:21	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: if you get a session with only lua procs or bypacked a-* plugins. it will be relatively sure that it will work 100% since the plugins are inlined.
2016-09-16 14:08:44	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: unless the plugins itself change (the non-inlined lua ones), in which case you might encounter other issues first

2016-09-16 23:55:45	tom-	[09:47:34] rgareus: and feeling that not for every code and commiter the same measures and rules are applied [09:47:34]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	rgareus	[09:48:09] it's not about persons. it's about interfaces [09:48:09]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	tom-	[09:48:25] rgareus: you could possibly take any file in the source tree and with some nitpicking find things that don't comply with the rules you at some points in time enforce to a special degree [09:48:25]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	rgareus	[09:48:53] lookup_plugin_port_by_name() is a horrible API. [09:48:53]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	tom-	[09:49:20] rgareus: i'm just analyzing, that's why i think i was touched if not to say hurt. because when you say stuff, it's not just anybody. i normaly find your stuff beatiful and reasonable. so even harder to accept [09:49:20]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	rgareus	[09:49:44] you already have all the methords to get exactly that in a script in about 5 mins if you need it.  and then you have control over the possible edge cases [09:49:44]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	tom-	[09:49:44] you invented the lookup :) [09:49:44]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	tom-	[09:50:10] rgareus: no questions about that [09:50:10]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	rgareus	[09:50:36] looking up by name requires iterating over ports. [09:50:36]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	rgareus	[09:50:58] in a script you can do that once and build a LUT.   in libardour you can't do that. [09:50:58]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	tom-	[09:51:26] yes, but i'd bet it's quicker anyway [09:51:26]

2016-09-16 23:55:45	rgareus	[09:51:46] libardour can't assume that port-names won't change or can't know what do to in case of dups  and will have to iterate *every* time. [09:51:46]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	rgareus	[09:52:23] and apart from that it's not a reliable  way of looking up ports and it should be discouraged [09:52:23]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	rgareus	[09:52:39] LV2 explicitly forbids it in the spec..  [09:52:39]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	rgareus	[09:53:08] if you want to do it anyway...  yes you can with a script, but it won't be part of an API exposed by libardour [09:53:08]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	tom-	[09:53:51] that is i think where you make a wrong link. with obfuscated reasoning [09:53:51]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	tom-	[09:54:24] is it reliable to query if a value is above 1.2? [09:54:24]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	tom-	[09:54:37] is it reliable to query if a port is named "foo"? [09:54:37]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	tom-	[09:55:02] we assume different problems to be solved [09:55:02]

2016-09-16 23:56:04	tom-	the idea of it being somehow a lookup table is a wrong model to look at it
2016-09-16 23:56:10	--	Channel created on Sat, 25 Nov 2006 20:42:44
2016-09-16 23:56:43	tom-	you could have a lookup table saying for every other value if it is below or above 1.2. but it's easier to query if it's above or below directly
2016-09-16 23:57:16	rgareus	tom-: this is #ardour and not programming school.
2016-09-16 23:57:16	tom-	using by_name() does not guarantee that the queried item does exist under that name
2016-09-16 23:58:55	tom-	same like it's totally dependent on the caller what value he/she wants to check
2016-09-17 00:01:10	tom-	for the pragmatic part of it, tracks i.e. are sure to be unique
2016-09-17 00:01:50	tom-	they can still change.. not better or worse than using an index that will change for a given plugin
2016-09-17 00:02:33	tom-	i think the term "remote id" is misleading in the current code base
2016-09-17 00:03:03	rgareus	that's an entierly different API
2016-09-17 00:03:43	rgareus	tom-: why do you keep arguing?
2016-09-17 00:05:48	tom-	rgareus: because it's eating me up
2016-09-17 00:06:36	tom-	rgareus: i think you've lost your mind in that particular thing we are talking about

2016-09-17 00:14:07	rgareus	Caterpillar: reasonable-synth is /piano-like/ and probably the simplest way (just add the plugin, no settings,...)
2016-09-17 00:14:19	tom-	rgareus: stupid things like this are the grounds for taking a different path
2016-09-17 00:14:31	rgareus	as for fluidsynth:  http://download.linuxaudio.org/musical-instrument-libraries/sf2/fluidr3-splitted/    has truly /free/ soundfonts. incl some piano ones

2016-09-17 00:16:07	Caterpillar	rgareus: I can't find where I can make Ardour load such plugin
2016-09-17 00:16:08	tom-	rgareus: because i'm so totally convinced that querying (to not say looking up) something by a name is absolutely necessary to have
2016-09-17 00:16:23	rgareus	Caterpillar: which version of Ardour is that?
2016-09-17 00:16:37	Caterpillar	rgareus: 5.0.0
2016-09-17 00:16:52	rgareus	Caterpillar: too old I'm afraid.
2016-09-17 00:17:03	tom-	rgareus: since it's a returning demand, it makes sense to have it in the c++ api rather that copy & paste it in scripts
2016-09-17 00:17:09	rgareus	Caterpillar: a-fluidsynth was added in 5.1 
2016-09-17 00:17:18	Caterpillar	rgareus: no problem, I install the 5.1
2016-09-17 00:17:37	rgareus	Caterpillar: go for 5.3
2016-09-17 00:18:42	rgareus	Caterpillar: LinuxSampler is an option or calf-fluidsynth (though the latter has various issues)  and either is likely more complicated
2016-09-17 00:20:00	Caterpillar	I am installing 5.5 since I have found out that it has been included into Fedora repositories
2016-09-17 00:20:05	Caterpillar	ah pardon

2016-09-17 00:35:57	Caterpillar	rgareus: I added an audio track. Where is the instrument list?
2016-09-17 00:36:12	rgareus	Caterpillar: you'll want a MIDI track  for instruments
2016-09-17 00:36:34	Caterpillar	ok added
2016-09-17 00:36:48	rgareus	if you select "MIDI track" in  the "Add Track or Bus" dialog, there's a dropdown directly in that dialog to select an instrument
2016-09-17 00:37:11	rgareus	you can change that instrument later, though in the Mixer (it's just a plugin)
2016-09-17 00:37:36	Caterpillar	now I have to load FluidR3_GM.sf2
2016-09-17 00:38:06	rgareus	open the plugin GUI (double click on the plugin in the mixer)

2016-09-17 00:41:22	rgareus	it also looks like that MIDI track is not connected to any inputs (MIDI-keyboard) yet.

2016-09-17 00:42:41	rgareus	mmh looks like there's something wrong with the Italian translation (for "Manual")
2016-09-17 00:43:05	rgareus	Caterpillar: since you don't have a midi-keyboard:   in the editor window,   increase the height of the MIDI track
2016-09-17 00:43:15	rgareus	(or select the track, press 'f')
2016-09-17 00:43:30	rgareus	Caterpillar:  piano-roll  will appear
2016-09-17 00:43:38	rgareus	where you can press notes..
2016-09-17 00:44:33	rgareus	if you have not done much MIDI,   http://manual.ardour.org/editing-and-arranging/edit-midi/   and  http://libremusicproduction.com/tutorials/recording-audio-and-using-midi-ardour-3  explain that

2016-09-17 01:03:02	rgareus	usually from a midi-keyboard ; almost all have a dedicated knob or button for that
2016-09-17 01:03:39	Caterpillar	rgareus: the piano we just selected is the most "classical" one?
2016-09-17 01:03:48	rgareus	jack-keyboard or vmpk  also have controls
2016-09-17 01:04:19	rgareus	Caterpillar: "classical" in the sense of 80's MIDI standard, yes :)
2016-09-17 01:04:28	rgareus	program 1 in General MIDI is a Piano.
2016-09-17 01:04:36	rgareus	and that's the default
2016-09-17 01:04:47	Caterpillar	rgareus: no I meant if it produces a sound similar to a real piano

2016-09-17 01:05:58	rgareus	which is OKish -- but not really great.
2016-09-17 01:06:34	rgareus	if you mix it into a performance, it's good enough for a lot of things.  but if you want to play piano solo.  it sounds flat.
2016-09-17 01:06:53	rgareus	or boring or lacks character
2016-09-17 01:09:34	Caterpillar	rgareus: I actually need a piano only to make some exercize voices about trying to reach and keep some various tones. We did it once during dubbing lessons I have taken
2016-09-17 01:10:35	rgareus	that fluidsynth/sf2 sound is more than good enough then
2016-09-17 01:10:42	Caterpillar	ok
2016-09-17 01:11:28	rgareus	by analogy: you don't need a Steinway Grand Piano for that, either
2016-09-17 01:12:15	rgareus	any cheap piano will do (as long as it's in tune)

2016-09-17 11:17:55	tom-	melanie__: so getting a POV from the origin of this rule can be interesting
2016-09-17 11:18:14	melanie__	tom-: well i do not know the code but out of the spec to not use the name as an identifier it does not say that it is impossible but it says that code doing so should be rejected
2016-09-17 11:19:22	tom-	melanie__: it's not impossible indeed
2016-09-17 11:20:03	tom-	melanie__: when it's agreed that a port label is not an identifier. why would it be rejected to query for it.
2016-09-17 11:20:03		[11:20]
2016-09-17 11:20:34	tom-	because we're not lookup by an identifier we know exists for sure. 
2016-09-17 11:20:38	melanie__	tom-: because of the specification that is like a law
2016-09-17 11:21:22	tom-	melanie__: yeah, but if a label is not looked at as an identifier. this rule does not apply, does it?
2016-09-17 11:21:53	tom-	i'd really like to get drobilla's view on this
2016-09-17 11:22:20	melanie__	how do you use it?
2016-09-17 11:24:13	tom-	melanie__: you refer to query by name?
2016-09-17 11:25:00	tom-	melanie__: it doesn't exist in ardour, it can only be scripted
2016-09-17 11:25:24	melanie__	tom-: yes give me an example of why you want to look it up and how you use it
2016-09-17 11:25:52	melanie__	tom-: think of me as someone dumb you explain it
2016-09-17 11:26:14	tom-	melanie__: i know i have a plugin named "foo" with a port named "bar". i'd like to say "look for first plugin named "foo" on track x, set parameter "bar" to value z
2016-09-17 11:26:44	tom-	melanie__: for doing that, it's enough to look at the plugin name and the generic plugin control window
2016-09-17 11:27:18	tom-	melanie__: i can then move the plugin, it still works because it doesn't rely on the index which in that case could change
2016-09-17 11:27:28	tom-	melanie__: good enough? :)
2016-09-17 11:28:44	tom-	melanie__: also i can change the order of the parameters of a (scripted) plugin, and it still works because the name is (in my case) more stable than the sorted-in position of the control
2016-09-17 11:28:44	melanie__	tom-: and how would you then lookup plugin foo with bar and foo.1 with bar?
2016-09-17 11:29:29	tom-	melanie__: i'd take the second element of the result of the query
2016-09-17 11:31:09	tom-	it's important to see that a lookup that results in zero or one element is different to getting zero or more as a result of a query that can match more than one element (since it's not an identifier that is unique)
2016-09-17 11:31:50	rgareus	why would you use an unreliable lookup (by name) if you can use a reliable lookup by ID?
2016-09-17 11:31:53	tom-	melanie__: often, a query for a port by label with either give zero or one return
2016-09-17 11:32:06	tom-	melanie__: i could then check, aha, only one element, good, i'll use that one
2016-09-17 11:32:31	tom-	rgareus: because there is no ID that deserves the name
2016-09-17 11:32:35	melanie__	well then it would be mor reliable to use pid in the system and not names  
2016-09-17 11:33:58	tom-	we need both
2016-09-17 11:33:59	rgareus	there is a designated numeric ID in the spec of all plugins. and the spec even mandates that it must not change.
2016-09-17 11:34:02	melanie__	which is what  i think is the thought on that the pid is linked to the identifier wich leads to being able to start more than one plugin with the same name
2016-09-17 11:34:12	tom-	a reliable way to lookup by a unique identifier
2016-09-17 11:34:25	tom-	a reliable way to lookup by a *session-wide unique* identifier
2016-09-17 11:34:44	tom-	and a way to query by non-identifiers, expecting 0 or more results

2016-09-17 11:40:30	tom-	i'll have a look thanks
2016-09-17 11:41:14	rgareus	almost all Objects inherit from PBD::Stateful which has a ID
2016-09-17 11:41:22	tom-	that doesn't make the need to also query by non-identifiers obsolete
2016-09-17 11:42:10	tom-	also if i understand that correctly: this session-wide id will be different in other sessions
2016-09-17 11:42:31	tom-	so it's worse than using a port label, which is probably more static across sessions, right?
2016-09-17 11:42:45	rgareus	looking up someething that is not an ID is not a great idea
2016-09-17 11:43:03	tom-	querying something is a great idea
2016-09-17 11:43:41	tom-	it feels natural. i can query without knowing beforehand if i'l get 0, 1 or more matches
2016-09-17 11:44:13	tom-	i could ask here: who likes little britain?
2016-09-17 11:44:37	tom-	totally unsure if 0 or more replies will be resulting
2016-09-17 11:45:09	tom-	i would not say lookup("i already know who likes little britain because i know the unique id")
2016-09-17 11:45:56	tom-	so that's a fundamental difference in lookup using a unique id versus querying using an argument NOT being a unique identifier
2016-09-17 11:47:00	melanie__	hm reminds a bit of sql queries
2016-09-17 11:47:52	rgareus	queries are complex. A lookup is O(1).

2016-09-17 11:51:24	tom-	as far as i can see, there are many places in the ardour code where something is found by iterating over a list
2016-09-17 11:51:50	tom-	so that's not O(1) at all iiuc
2016-09-17 11:51:50		[11:51]

2016-09-17 11:53:06	tom-	OvenWerks: exactly
2016-09-17 11:53:12	rgareus	nocomply: the crash is in completely unrelated code.
2016-09-17 11:53:36	nocomply	rgareus: ok, well thanks for looking anyway
2016-09-17 11:54:07	OvenWerks	tom-: so for the API to do it for you the API has to be able to search by any odd thing you might come up with. That could be a number of search calls
2016-09-17 11:54:46	rgareus	the difference is that the existing APIs look for unique and designated IDs
2016-09-17 11:56:09	tom-	using a non-identifier to query is also just only a way to get a real id
2016-09-17 11:56:33	tom-	melanie__: i look at it a bit like an sql query indeed, that's a good analogy
2016-09-17 11:57:08	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Why introduce an SQL-like query mechanism when you can write it in lua ?
2016-09-17 11:57:13	tom-	query by non-identifier to get a list of matching items (identified by id). i can then use the id from then on that i don't even have to know beforehand)
2016-09-17 11:57:57	melanie__	tom-: :)
2016-09-17 11:57:59	rgareus	why even consider something unreliable in a DAW which should be 100% rock solid, when there's already a solid way?
2016-09-17 11:58:18	tom-	rgareus: what's unreliable about iterating over a list?
2016-09-17 11:58:44	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Why is an Ardour-provided filter by name (because that's not a lookup but a filter in fact that you want) that much better than the exact same loop in lua ?
2016-09-17 11:58:47	rgareus	you may or may not find a result, or maybe you find one one full moon on a machine in Iceland with translations turned on...
2016-09-17 11:58:54	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: i'm tempted to read "an SQL-like query mechanism, implemented in lua" :)
2016-09-17 11:59:12	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: esp. since the loop in lua can be customized to check for other things than name if needed
2016-09-17 11:59:12	melanie__	tom-: found a few weeks ago the following query select * from users where Firstname=usernameinput gave back quite some more results than one 
2016-09-17 11:59:21	rgareus	really, it's possible to do with a script.  doing this in core ardour won't happen.
2016-09-17 11:59:26	tom-	rgareus: i don't see anything not reliable in your example
2016-09-17 11:59:35	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Whereas you'd have to loop over the results of the query if you want to filter more
2016-09-17 11:59:43	rgareus	tom-: look harder
2016-09-17 11:59:57	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Or expect Ardour to provide other API that can filter in clever ways
2016-09-17 12:00:03	rgareus	tom-: I also explained it at least twice, re-read the backlog
2016-09-17 12:00:07	 *	rgareus gives up
2016-09-17 12:00:18	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Which screams API bloat to me, esp. since you can do all of that in lua
2016-09-17 12:01:26	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: It's not reliable as a real, stable reference to a port, and since all other existing API are stable reliable references, it would be the odd thing
2016-09-17 12:01:54	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: And users will probably use it thinking they can infer the same reliability promises
2016-09-17 12:02:06	rgareus	_FrnchFrgg_: well said
2016-09-17 12:02:22	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: That's a concern anyway, and you cannot wave it away IMHO
2016-09-17 12:02:46	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: A carefully crafted api name might alleviate that
2016-09-17 12:03:16	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: But you never addressed the question why the increase in API is warranted.
2016-09-17 12:04:05	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Less is more. You can easily add API but not remove it without lengthy deprecation periods
2016-09-17 12:04:40	tom-	a query is totally realiable when it detects that a label has changed
2016-09-17 12:04:42	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: That's the same error we often see in configuration UI: you get a knob for everything

2016-09-17 12:07:39	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: in the turned down methods in my pr, there is nothing smart in place. it just tries to find a plugin port by label
2016-09-17 12:07:57	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: there is no facility to have more than one result
2016-09-17 12:08:03	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: So what does "a query is totally reliable ...." mean ?
2016-09-17 12:08:17	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: you can however check by the return value (boolean) if the query was successful or not
2016-09-17 12:08:37	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Sure, but if it's unsuccessful, now what ?
2016-09-17 12:08:39	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: and if it was successful, you have the value (or the value was set)
2016-09-17 12:09:17	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: are you asking me what to make out of a boolean information?
2016-09-17 12:09:47	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: I'm asking what you are planning to do with that information in your script
2016-09-17 12:09:47	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: if the port i.e. was not found by label under that name. i would i.e. not try to set a value on it
2016-09-17 12:10:12	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Sure, but then the script doesn't do what the user expects it to
2016-09-17 12:10:51	rgareus	..or if it accidentally finds a port it would set the value
2016-09-17 12:11:03	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: So it's not broken only for a very restricted version of "not broken" that's convenient to your argument but not realistic.
2016-09-17 12:11:43	tom-	rgareus: look at your lua examples. they break in many ways
2016-09-17 12:12:07	tom-	rgareus: because.. they use an index as an id.

2016-09-17 12:13:45	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: The question about index of a plugin in the processor list or a track in the session is completely different
2016-09-17 12:13:50	rgareus	tom-: the latter is used in  'examples' or snippets -- not in released and bundled scripts
2016-09-17 12:14:20	rgareus	and I never said they are "stable" or don't break.  they're example scripts, not an API
2016-09-17 12:14:21	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: And more important, these examples do not break because the API is unreliable IMHO
2016-09-17 12:14:42	rgareus	besides, no bug report is filed, so by definition there's no problem.
2016-09-17 12:14:52	tom-	rgareus: the plugin names have changed.
2016-09-17 12:14:56	tom-	rgareus: a-
2016-09-17 12:15:13	rgareus	tom-: not in a released version
2016-09-17 12:15:17	rgareus	only in git.
2016-09-17 12:15:26	tom-	no idea
2016-09-17 12:15:30	rgareus	but that just prooves the point that lookup by name is not reliable
2016-09-17 12:15:37	rgareus	the URI has not changed
2016-09-17 12:15:44	tom-	and thus it needs to be used in an example
2016-09-17 12:15:52	tom-	to show that actually one should not use it, right?
2016-09-17 12:16:25	tom-	i'm not critizing this. but you need to apply symmetric considerations
2016-09-17 12:16:50	_FrnchFrgg_	rgareus: tom- has a point, maybe the examples should not emphasize loops that search a plugin by name.

2016-09-17 12:17:09	rgareus	yep
2016-09-17 12:17:17	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Not rock solid API
2016-09-17 12:17:18	rgareus	well, it's a loop
2016-09-17 12:17:29	tom-	it's amazing to see how things get "solved" :)
2016-09-17 12:17:37	tom-	oh.. let's remove all the interesting stuff
2016-09-17 12:18:06	rgareus	just like you can loop and check for a port-name.  currently the loop iterates over plugins and checks the plugin-name in the example script
2016-09-17 12:18:12	tom-	you sould agree that introducing a query mechanism that uses a label to find things is not better or worse than other things in place
2016-09-17 12:18:12	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: And nobody prevents you to write such a loop in lua. rgareus just said he wouldn't promote that to API
2016-09-17 12:18:15	rgareus	not good practice, but for an example, it's fine.
2016-09-17 12:18:24	tom-	it can be coded in a reliable, non-critical way in c++
2016-09-17 12:18:29	rgareus	it's not a libardour API to lookup plugins by name.
2016-09-17 12:19:10	rgareus	tom-: which script actually?
2016-09-17 12:19:12	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: It's worse than looking by uri for LV2 which is a real unique stable id. For VST that's more problematic.
2016-09-17 12:19:35	rgareus	tom-: now that I look   s_plugin_automation.lua  s_pluginutils.lua and  s_replaceplugin.lua  all use URIs
2016-09-17 12:20:42	_FrnchFrgg_	rgareus: Are there examples/snippets that show good practice ? There should be, even if the dirty loops stay as examples (maybe with a warning that it's only for quick solutions)
2016-09-17 12:20:57	_FrnchFrgg_	rgareus: You answered my question
2016-09-17 12:21:11	rgareus	well,  s_pluginutils.lua also has an example  for "4th plugin (from top)"  
2016-09-17 12:22:02	tom-	if you say it's doable in a script and can even be useful, denying to support that in the API is ignorant
2016-09-17 12:22:11	tom-	from my POV
2016-09-17 12:22:11		[12:22]
2016-09-17 12:22:36	tom-	the worst possible outcome of it being in the API has yet to be named

2016-09-17 12:28:01	rgareus	speaking of which, it'd be nice to translate the a-plugins
2016-09-17 12:30:36	tom-	so the worst case would be that a query by name would detect another localization.
2016-09-17 12:32:09	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: And how would you guess the new name ? Because detecting the change isn't enough, the user wants the script to continue doing its stuff...
2016-09-17 12:33:10	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: And expecting the user to type/choose again is not realistic (if the session goes back and forth between two systems with different locales, it would be hell)

2016-09-17 12:35:31	rgareus	APIs never change, once it's out, it's forever.  only way is to deprecate it and write a new API.
2016-09-17 12:35:32	tom-	the API is not designed at all. it's a mess :)
2016-09-17 12:35:50	tom-	it's not designed around user needs in a scripting context
2016-09-17 12:36:31	tom-	it feels like someone tries to make it as cumersome as possible (in some areas)
2016-09-17 12:36:57	tom-	it's also just exposing what's inside ardour to a big part
2016-09-17 12:37:26	tom-	but what it can do is powerful
2016-09-17 12:37:26		[12:37]
2016-09-17 12:38:16	tom-	and that it popped up in so short time is impressive. but the API itself is not very intuitive imho
2016-09-17 12:39:22	tom-	i could imagine: track("audio1").plugin("foo")[1].set(23)
2016-09-17 12:39:40	tom-	look at how cumbersome it has to be done now
2016-09-17 12:40:32	tom-	not a good example
2016-09-17 12:40:58	tom-	it wasn't so that the api was designed first. it was tried to make an api out of the ardour internals
2016-09-17 12:41:42	tom-	and *that* could be looked at as not the best way to get a user-centric api
2016-09-17 12:41:49	rgareus	Session:get_track_by_name("audio1").get_processor_by_id(ID, type).get_parameter(1).set_parameter(23)   would be nice

2016-09-17 19:31:28	learner19	Hey guys, I'm an absolute rookie and I have a basic question
2016-09-17 19:31:41	learner19	I'm taking an online class on Coursera (Intro to Music Production) for which I have to use a synth
2016-09-17 19:32:12	learner19	They recommended a few synths, zebralette and lin plugin were two of them so I've downloaded them
2016-09-17 19:32:19	learner19	https://www.u-he.com/cms/zebralette and https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=lin%20plugin%20spectral

2016-09-17 19:33:02	LAbot	Title: LinPlug Virtual Instruments (at www.linplug.com)
2016-09-17 19:33:06	learner19	I need to do something as simple as turning on the oscillator on the synth
2016-09-17 19:33:34	learner19	In the course video the synth that they showed was really simple where the instructor could just select a particular waveform and play the sound
2016-09-17 19:33:49	learner19	I can't figure how to do this in ardour 
2016-09-17 19:33:59	learner19	Using these plugins
2016-09-17 19:34:43	learner19	I got help from this channel last night to even open zebralette. Right now what I'm doing is adding a new midi track and selecting zebralette as the instrument
2016-09-17 19:34:54	learner19	But how do I get the oscillator on it to 'play'?

2016-09-18 01:11:00	tom-	OvenWerks: just a thought. that could cather some usecases where the surface has sort of a static mapping to a non-changing id no matter what (for the lifetime of the session)
2016-09-18 01:13:40	dP	@rgareus: thanky you for the help offered & sorry for the delay in answering. I installed ardour from source tarball, not git. I tried to run ardour from source and from install directory - either ways it's not localized. Ardour binds its txt domain to /usr/local/share/ardour5/locale - this file does not exist in that directory. I could not find any *.po-file in the tarball. ./waf i18n finished successfully.
2016-09-18 01:15:32	dP	I will try another run of ./waf clean && ./waf configure && ./waf && ./waf install
2016-09-18 01:20:35	rgareus	dP: or use    ./waf configure --prefix=/usr --configdir=/etc --with-backends=jack,alsa,dummy    # to install in /usr (not /usr/local)

2016-09-18 01:43:15	rgareus	is there some term that fits "Gain" that's commonly used in german-speaking studios?
2016-09-18 01:44:17	rgareus	Verstaerkungsfaktor would be the electronics tech term but it sounds odd in the context.
2016-09-18 01:50:00		[01:44]
2016-09-18 01:50:02	dP	Probably the term "Vorverstärkung" (pre-amplification) would also fit

2016-09-18 01:50:39	rgareus	except gain can also be the master-gain (output)
2016-09-18 01:51:20	rgareus	but  Verstärkung  -ung  is nice for a control-parameter
2016-09-18 01:51:25	tom-	rgareus: it needs libardouraslatuil.so which seemed not to be in the path
2016-09-18 01:52:20	rgareus	tom-: so    headless/hardev_common.sh.in  and  gtk2_ardour/ardev_common.sh.in  became out of sync?
2016-09-18 01:53:46	tom-	rgareus: dunno.. i added $libs/libardouralsautil to the sh.in and it seems to work (with jack)

2016-09-18 03:19:26	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: A plugin that should really be a session script or even another type because it doesn't care at all about the signal (i.e. with a completely pass-trough dsp_run[map] that doesn't communicate anything to the inline gui)
2016-09-18 03:20:10	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: That is hijacking to me, because it's a dsp plugin only because other plugin types have currently no gui capabilities, inline or otherwise.

2016-09-18 03:56:12	rgareus	in any case VCAs will sove that in a different way
2016-09-18 03:57:20	rgareus	slave plugin control port to VCA,   then set the VCA level from <some script>.  That allows a nice abstraction with user GUI control for the connections
2016-09-18 03:58:11	_FrnchFrgg_	rgareus: Will VCAs be able to have parameters as slaves soon ?
2016-09-18 03:58:15	rgareus	while in ^^ case it could be a DSP plugin which sets the VCA,  a session plugin is also preferred to avoid ambiguities.
2016-09-18 03:59:04	rgareus	_FrnchFrgg_: it already works from a lua script,   except the session will crash at exit (SharedPtr reference)
2016-09-18 03:59:53	_FrnchFrgg_	rgareus: Except if the VCA is set from a sound level, as in a plugin that would be compressor-like but wouldn't actually apply the gain, just expose it as out param or set a VCA from it
2016-09-18 04:00:06	rgareus	VCAs work on controllables  and plugin ports are controllables. Just the GUI does not support binding those
2016-09-18 04:00:16	_FrnchFrgg_	rgareus: Great
2016-09-18 04:00:53	rgareus	but as I said,  there is some race or something  when controllables go away.
2016-09-18 04:01:08	_FrnchFrgg_	rgareus: In moments like these you really like the design choices for Ardour's architectures
2016-09-18 04:01:47	rgareus	yeah,  at some point everything just falls into place.
2016-09-18 04:02:49	_FrnchFrgg_	rgareus: Instead of doing VCA the quick way, it has been done the right way. Same for automation, even if there is still more refactoring to do to ensure the GUI never touches a param and only automation does, while GUI controls automation only
2016-09-18 04:04:19	rgareus	VCAs are not automatable yet.  similar reason: there's no fixed control-rate.
2016-09-18 04:04:36	rgareus	so the VCA would have to look up event-lists of all linked sources
2016-09-18 04:05:51	rgareus	and potentially offset the events again for the slaves.   e.g. slave 2 plugins A,B.   signal flow    in -> A -> B -> out.    A  has latency.
2016-09-18 04:06:15	rgareus	so the events for B need to be offset   details, details..  needs time

2016-09-18 04:12:16	_FrnchFrgg_	rgareus: Why would it be the VCA's responsibility to query its sources ?

2016-09-18 04:14:56	JL__	rgareus: could it be not in relatiion with quit ?
2016-09-18 04:16:11	rgareus	_FrnchFrgg_: the VCA itself can be a slave.
2016-09-18 04:16:41	rgareus	_FrnchFrgg_: events are downstream. lookup (when is the next event to split the cycle) is upwards towards the master
2016-09-18 04:17:12	rgareus	a fixed setting (currently, GUI) -> constant value for the complete process cycle.
2016-09-18 04:20:19	nocomply	rgareus: regarding our discussion yesterday about zita-convolver, fftw and ardour... would it be possible for zita-convolver to have the fftw issue rather than the plugins themselves? My plugins come from kxstudio so should be ok but zita-convolver just comes from ubuntu's repos so maybe that could be the weak link? Or it wouldn't work like that?
2016-09-18 04:21:22	rgareus	nocomply: ldd /usr/lib/lv2/PLUGIN_NAME/.so    check if it's dynamically linked
2016-09-18 04:22:16	rgareus	nocomply: if it uses /usr/lib/*/libzita-convolver.so    follow it ->   ldd /usr/lib/*/libzita-convolver.so
2016-09-18 04:22:41	rgareus	kxstudio plugins should be statically linked  (all dependencies included)

2016-09-18 09:30:41	MaurizioB	rgareus: as I thought. so the specification is the same for both jack and alsa, right?
2016-09-18 09:31:12	MaurizioB	oooooooooh, now I get it, *char means ascii printable characters :O
2016-09-18 09:31:14	rgareus	ardour's other backends (alsa, coreaudio, asio, etc) do follow the jack specs
2016-09-18 09:31:24	MaurizioB	thank you rgareus :)
2016-09-18 09:32:13	rgareus	I don't think it needs to be ASCII, UTF8 should work just fine.

2016-09-18 09:34:16	rgareus	I just tried.  create a track in ardour ...   jack_lsp   ->    ardour:Audio ç/audio_in 1
2016-09-18 09:34:45	MaurizioB	well, to be honest, I was able to create a client with other characters, such as ²
2016-09-18 09:34:59	rgareus	the terminal here is UTF8.  qjackctl also displays it correctly
2016-09-18 09:35:11	MaurizioB	but I think that it would create a mess with different encodings
2016-09-18 09:35:48	MaurizioB	for example, while patchage showed "²" (exponent 2) correctly, my python client didn't
2016-09-18 09:36:08	MaurizioB	I suppose it depends on the encoding of the python-jack library
2016-09-18 09:36:25	rgareus	UTF-8 is ASCII compatible  c string (char*)   programs won't care. worst case it'll be displayed in an odd way.

2016-09-18 09:39:09	rgareus	indexing and connecting should also just work in python.   display is another thing
2016-09-18 09:39:48	rgareus	MaurizioB: yes, it's the separator beteen client-name and port-name.  some jack-apps search for the first, some for the last colon.
2016-09-18 09:40:33	MaurizioB	ah, so it's not technically forbidden, it's just some matter of a good practice
2016-09-18 09:40:38	rgareus	jack itself does not care (only mechanism  no policy)
2016-09-18 09:41:22	MaurizioB	yeah, indeed, I just created a test:client with a port:test
2016-09-18 09:41:43	MaurizioB	ok, thank you for the clarification
2016-09-18 09:41:48	rgareus	and qjackctl displays it how?
2016-09-18 09:42:06	rgareus	 test  -> client:port:test ?   or test:client:port  -> test ?
2016-09-18 09:42:43	MaurizioB	in qjackctl the client is "test", the port is "client:port:test"
2016-09-18 09:43:12	MaurizioB	also the same with patchage and the python library

2016-09-18 09:58:08	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Such a plugin (as in the linked MFC_session_3chan) should really be a session script. There's nothing in it that warrants being a dsp plugin. Except that currently session scripts have no UI and no live parameters.
2016-09-18 09:58:57	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: But that means you are actually using the wrong type of plugin just because the correct type is less advanced implementation-wise

2016-09-18 09:59:03	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: That's what I call hijacking
2016-09-18 09:59:25	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: a session script has no way to make available a result like a plugin has with output ports
2016-09-18 10:00:02	tom-	it's different to a plugin that's why i chose a plugin and the term "dsp" doesn't scare me there
2016-09-18 10:00:25	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Nobody will prevent you from doing it, but I find it strange that you advocate strongly that the approach is the right one when it's completely evident that it's a workaround for missing features in session scripts.
2016-09-18 10:00:45	tom-	if you can't tell me how a session script can put a result, you will agree it's different and in that case not "hijacking" at all
2016-09-18 10:01:35	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: a session script should probably not have output ports. that's really better to have in plugins

2016-09-18 10:03:54	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Why would you want to expose "results" when the session script can directly read the value of one plugin and write it to another ?
2016-09-18 10:04:27	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: imagine a tree where not all plugins are on the same level
2016-09-18 10:04:37	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: most of them do not know about the others
2016-09-18 10:05:05	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: but there can be one that is responsible for a bunch of others, not necessarily immediately before or after "self"

2016-09-18 10:05:47	tom-	yes, it has no concept for this at all. plugins have it

2016-09-18 10:09:16	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: That's not finding things by name that is strange. It's the fact that your script must imperatively rely on that.

2016-09-18 10:13:15	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: it's enough if you agree session scripts are different to plugin scripts and that difference helps to make a choice which one to use

2016-09-18 10:13:54	_FrnchFrgg_	?
2016-09-18 10:14:13	OvenWerks	tom-: the RID was always 1 based before. The RID always followed mixer order before. So it seems nothing has changed unless the user decides to use banking which is off by default.

2016-09-18 10:14:41	OvenWerks	I am not sure how one based counting is not an "index"
2016-09-18 10:14:42	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: what's yours? i found plugin script more suitable for the case
2016-09-18 10:14:57	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: and that for given reasons you seem to ignore
2016-09-18 10:16:38	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Either I missed your reasons, or we don't speak about the same plugins, because I don't remember any argument you made for "luadsp" vs "session lua" apart from "luadsp can display things in strips and can have parameters"
2016-09-18 10:17:06	tom-	OvenWerks: there was a setting if RID follow order or not
2016-09-18 10:17:21	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Which quickly turned into "luadsp need string parameters" (and I agree that session scripts should have parameters, *including* string parameters)
2016-09-18 10:17:55	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: yes
2016-09-18 10:18:15	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: luadsp probably shouldn't have string parameters, for the reasons we already told (rt-safety mainly)
2016-09-18 10:18:18	 *	rghvdberg just managed to print "Hello World" in lua ... 
2016-09-18 10:18:32	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: i can print from a lua script a veeery long string
2016-09-18 10:18:41	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: And the point is ?
2016-09-18 10:18:43	OvenWerks	tom-: in the case of not following mixer order, the user had to set the RID by hand. So that was not route ID either.
2016-09-18 10:18:57	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: it's not understandable why sending out a string i.e. for osc is hard to do
2016-09-18 10:19:36	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: That looong string is allocated at closure interpretation time, so no rt problem
2016-09-18 10:19:53	tom-	but not for print()?

2016-09-18 10:21:12	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: In fact, that might not even work depending on the size because rgareus limited the memory available to luadsp
2016-09-18 10:21:22	tom-	but print() is handy
2016-09-18 10:21:27	tom-	so would be to send osc

2016-09-18 10:21:51	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: very small strings (as in osc commands) would be ok
2016-09-18 10:22:28	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: But if you give the user a textbox for a parameter, then you don't control anymore what's in the parameter. If he pastes a complete wikipedia article...

2016-09-18 10:39:49	OvenWerks	tom-: so you have a controller that has no display where the strip names are etched on the controller and then you change strip order in the GUI? That sounds like a recipe (even using strip ID instead of SSID) for confusion.
2016-09-18 10:40:00	tom-	having a expanded processor too. for instance: click the processor expand button -> a full-height processor box for the strip will show up right of the strip
2016-09-18 10:40:24	tom-	also that processor strip extension could be variable in width

2016-09-18 10:42:34	OvenWerks	tom-: I would suggest that if a user wanted to move a strip in the GUI they would probably want to move that strip on their controller too.

2016-09-18 10:55:18	tom-	yes. i won't have to convince anyone why an id is a practical thing to have to reference items

2016-09-18 13:24:36	tom-	[21:37:10] but hey. current osc api will live long i'm sure [21:37:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	tom-	[21:37:24] because it's hardcoded and released, so .. :) [21:37:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	weezo	[21:37:28] Anyone know how to create a hotkey for toggling mute track on and off. I looked in Window - Key Bindings, but can't find it? [21:37:28]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	rgareus	[21:38:07] weezo: I don't think you can [21:38:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	rgareus	[21:39:00] bindings are for global actions.  mute/unmute is per track [21:39:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	weezo	[21:39:41] But there is a hotkey for toggling solo/unsolo  [21:39:41]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	weezo	[21:41:10] (as in surprising there wouldn't also be for mute) [21:41:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	tom-	[22:03:14] good night [22:03:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	rhydermike	[23:02:46] Loading up tonight's git pull for a play around... [23:02:46]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	rhydermike	[23:20:53] Still has bug where realtime recorded MIDI notes don't show up while recording. It did resize the viewing range when I hit a key. Tried it with smooth looping enabled and disabled. [23:20:53]

2016-09-19 02:43:54	tom-	[21:23:49] but what happens if all run at once and they all access the global variable and change it? [21:23:49]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	rgareus	[21:24:22] since they're in the same interpreter, they can't run at once. [21:24:22]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	tom-	[21:24:50] so order of execution matters in terms of a changing global [21:24:50]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	rgareus	[21:25:08] session-scripts run at the beginning of every [split]-process cycle, before processing begins [21:25:08]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	rgareus	[21:25:34] adding/removing is done at the end of a cycle (if there's time -- try-lock) [21:25:34]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	tom-	[21:28:19] rgareus: would a ringbuffer help to make sending and receiving osc rt safe from a script? [21:28:19]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	tom-	[21:28:52] rgareus: and a pre-allocated memory area (with limited size) to create osc objects and put to the ringbuffer [21:28:52]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	rgareus	[21:30:34]  yes, though there are better ways for x-thread communication in ardour, particularly for dynamic size and wakeup. [21:30:34]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	rgareus	[21:31:23] but for OSC, prefer to add it directly to the existing OSC surface.  the less the OSC protocol fragments, the better [21:31:23]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	tom-	[21:32:45] it should be possible to create dialects of osc [21:32:45]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	tom-	[21:33:38] and the osc api itself could be a script [21:33:38]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	tom-	[21:34:05] "best-practices" use of the lua api + osc [21:34:05]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	tom-	[21:35:05] like this, good-bye to any hack that cathers any specific surface in a hard-coded way [21:35:05]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	tom-	[21:36:08] like redundancy with funny naming, just for surface x. well overloading doesn't hurt but it's far more flexible if one can adapt to say a surface that only can send one param or only floats etc [21:36:08]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	tom-	[21:36:33] adapt by chaning some chars in the stock osc api script [21:36:33]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	tom-	[21:37:10] but hey. current osc api will live long i'm sure [21:37:10]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	tom-	[21:37:24] because it's hardcoded and released, so .. :) [21:37:24]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	weezo	[21:37:28] Anyone know how to create a hotkey for toggling mute track on and off. I looked in Window - Key Bindings, but can't find it? [21:37:28]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	rgareus	[21:38:07] weezo: I don't think you can [21:38:07]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	rgareus	[21:39:00] bindings are for global actions.  mute/unmute is per track [21:39:00]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	weezo	[21:39:41] But there is a hotkey for toggling solo/unsolo  [21:39:41]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	weezo	[21:41:10] (as in surprising there wouldn't also be for mute) [21:41:10]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	tom-	[22:03:14] good night [22:03:14]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	rhydermike	[23:02:46] Loading up tonight's git pull for a play around... [23:02:46]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	rhydermike	[23:20:53] Still has bug where realtime recorded MIDI notes don't show up while recording. It did resize the viewing range when I hit a key. Tried it with smooth looping enabled and disabled. [23:20:53]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	SomethisGER	[07:58:38] Hello ppl ... [07:58:38]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	SomethisGER	[08:01:27] I'm working with then nudge tool to "quantize" some untight, audio basslines. [08:01:27]
2016-09-19 02:43:54	SomethisGER	[08:02:01] Any suggestions on how to set the nudge to the smallest possible distance? [08:02:01]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	ahellquist_wrk	[08:07:12] SomethisGER, double click the nudge clock and enter a super small value [08:07:12]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	ahellquist_wrk	[08:07:51] SomethisGER, possibly use snap to grid instead  [08:07:51]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	SomethisGER	[08:12:39] ahellquist_wrk: Thanks, ok ... yeah, the nudge values are way to lare for quantizing. [08:12:39]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	SomethisGER	[08:13:35] ahellquist_wrk: I'll try to figure out a way to move a region to a small grid value, instead. [08:13:35]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	ahellquist_wrk	[08:14:06] SomethisGER, if you have recorded with click, the grid is the most useful way [08:14:06]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	SomethisGER	[08:15:20] ahellquist_wrk: and moving the regions can only be done with the mouse? [08:15:20]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	rgareus	[08:27:47] SomethisGER: right click and set the clock mode to "Samples"  1 sample is the smallest possible value [08:27:47]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	rgareus	[08:29:29] SomethisGER: for the workflow in case however it's probably faster to  1) select the track (click in the track-header) 2) use ctrl + left/right arrow to jump to onsets 3) press "S" to split, 4) use the mouse to move the right region.  goto 2. [08:29:29]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	SomethisGER	[08:33:04] rgareus: ... trying [08:33:04]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	SomethisGER	[08:36:22] JUCHUUU! [08:36:22]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	SomethisGER	[08:36:51] rgareus: you just made my day! This is so perfectly what I was looking for. [08:36:51]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	rgareus	[08:38:52] now that I try this again, the change in selection policy makes this a bit harder.  [08:38:52]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	rgareus	[08:39:37] track selection does no longer stick and affect all regions. :( [08:39:37]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	SomethisGER	[08:40:57] rgareus: the key was switching to "Samples" (which was hidden behind the right click. From there, I can just cut up my track and nudge everything where I need it. [08:40:57]
2016-09-19 02:43:55	SomethisGER	[08:41:17] rgareus: Saves me hours of fiddling with the mouse ;-) [08:41:17]

2016-09-19 08:59:20	nstewart	I'm trying to get there too
2016-09-19 09:00:40	las	nstewart: pretty sure that would be useful in ardour also
2016-09-19 09:02:25	tom-	how would that be displayed on the timeline?
2016-09-19 09:02:36	nstewart	I wouldn't object, I just didn't think it would go far with the core team.  It's actually kinda sorta related to the batch processing thing I'm working on
2016-09-19 09:03:37	las	nstewart: not at all (or rather, not strongly connected at all
2016-09-19 09:03:37		[09:03]
2016-09-19 09:04:14	nstewart	which brings up some issues - what exactly is F#maj7 at any point in time? Semantically from the composers perspective - it might have meaning, but it's ambiguous
2016-09-19 09:04:25	nstewart	especially if tracks have conflicting descriptions
2016-09-19 09:05:15	las	nstewart: how is that ambiguous?
2016-09-19 09:05:26	las	nstewart: ardour doesn't make it possible to define it, sure
2016-09-19 09:05:37	las	nstewart: but that's a defect in ardour at present, not the basic idea
2016-09-19 09:05:54	las	nstewart: the missing piece is that tracks do not have modes/scales associated with them
2016-09-19 09:06:00	las	nstewart: this is a required "new feature"
2016-09-19 09:06:01	JL__	nstewart: F# A# C# E#  :))
2016-09-19 09:06:14	nstewart	how do you describe on track playing F# A# C# while the other is playing something completely unrelated?
2016-09-19 09:07:06	JL__	F#
2016-09-19 09:07:17	nstewart	it might be handy in this case to be able to display location markers in closer proximity to a track, instead of all up at the top
2016-09-19 09:07:23	las	nstewart: F# is a note
2016-09-19 09:07:34	las	nstewart: F#maj7 is a defined set of notes once you know the track mode/scale
2016-09-19 09:07:41	JL__	or a chord
2016-09-19 09:08:32	JL__	in lead sheet form ...

2016-09-19 09:12:08	JL__	the question is : should this chord name only be a visual indication or an analysed situation...
2016-09-19 09:13:30	tom-	a script that parses for chords and puts a marker there? :)
2016-09-19 09:14:00	nstewart	my PC is dead ATM, but I'm trying to get there
2016-09-19 09:14:12	nstewart	have a plan anyway
2016-09-19 09:15:04	tom-	it's probably doable
2016-09-19 09:15:22	las	nstewart: without a scale/mode, scale designators have no clear meaning. ardour has no scale/mode for tracks or globally

2016-09-19 09:16:03	tom-	is F#maj7 ambiguous?
2016-09-19 09:16:55	nstewart	the scale/mode/chord wasn't part of my original intent. But I think I can grab 2 or 3 most probable notes, with possible octave ambiguity, given a single track. Others have already done more ambitious stuff.
2016-09-19 09:17:06	nstewart	yeah it is
2016-09-19 09:17:20	tom-	musical theory another thing too complicated for me
2016-09-19 09:18:07	nstewart	is it R357, R5/7/3, 3R5R73R?
2016-09-19 09:18:51	tom-	so if a have that keyboard showing note on/off situation. i couldn't show the chord name
2016-09-19 09:18:51		[09:18]
2016-09-19 09:19:04	tom-	in an unambiguous way, withtout giving a scale
2016-09-19 09:19:10	nstewart	I just want to be able to hammer out diads and triads on guitar and then edit for MIDI
2016-09-19 09:19:30	nstewart	that's less so, but still ambiguous.
2016-09-19 09:19:55	las	nstewart: i like to play mixolydian in F
2016-09-19 09:19:58	las	nstewart: so good luck
2016-09-19 09:20:01	JL__	nstewart: as you mentioned : F#maj7 it could be: C# sus4 13 :)
2016-09-19 09:20:02	nstewart	same set of notes could a G or Em7
2016-09-19 09:20:41	nstewart	whenever there's already way too many guitar players sawing away in open chords, I usually head up the neck and play relative major/minors to whatever the chart is

2016-09-19 09:24:19	tom-	for it to work for multiple tracks, each track would have to be partitioned into scales and in that context showing the chords (per track)

2016-09-19 11:23:54	rgareus	because the wording you propose suggests that it may be OK to use it as non-unique identifier. 
2016-09-19 11:24:58	tom-	rgareus: sure
2016-09-19 11:25:59	tom-	rgareus: the restriction should only apply for cases where uniqueness is wanted
2016-09-19 11:27:47	tom-	in the scope of one plugin
2016-09-19 11:28:46	rgareus	unique is only one aspect. it may change and be translated.
2016-09-19 11:30:56	tom-	that included
2016-09-19 11:31:11	tom-	it can change, it can be non-unique
2016-09-19 11:31:17	tom-	and still queryable
2016-09-19 11:33:19	tom-	rgareus: for the case you suggest, it would be better to use #symbol
2016-09-19 11:33:38	tom-	which again is well specified as unique identifier (in the scope of the plugin)
2016-09-19 11:33:47	rgareus	there is no symbol in VST nor AU.
2016-09-19 11:34:00	tom-	yes, it's missing
2016-09-19 11:34:25	rgareus	in Ardour lv2:symbol is only used internally for LV2-plugin to reliably map a port to the numeric ID

2016-09-19 11:38:42	rgareus	is that clear enough?

2016-09-19 12:15:53	tom-	rgareus: yes
2016-09-19 12:16:40	rgareus	clients may delay "reposition" in order to load files etc for the new time location.  it can take seconds..   prior attempts of Ardour to make jack-transport loop never worked reliably
2016-09-19 12:17:14	tom-	rgareus: apropos string for lookup: lv2:Symbol says "A short restricted name used as a machine and human readable identifier. "

2016-09-19 12:21:44	tom-	that's a side-effect of a plugin generalization having a least common denominator
2016-09-19 12:22:47	tom-	and that's aligned to the ones that don't know about symbol "machine and human readable"
2016-09-19 12:27:34	tom-	if an api can't deliver that, a generalization layer could say, let's take the next best which is name in that case
2016-09-19 12:27:34		[12:27]
2016-09-19 12:28:31	tom-	rgareus: why not introduce a symbol per port in luadsp?
2016-09-19 12:29:06	duffrecords	rgareus: understood.  Ardour's timecode sync needs to be Internal in order to loop.  in that mode, though, is it possible to send timecode to other clients, such as Hydrogen or does that require JACK?
2016-09-19 12:29:28	tom-	rgareus: with exactly the same restrictions as lv2:symbol
2016-09-19 12:31:24	tom-	duffrecords: maybe it will work with midi (mtc, midi clock or similar)?
2016-09-19 12:37:00		[12:31]
2016-09-19 12:43:22	tom-	rgareus: ?
2016-09-19 12:44:39	rgareus	duffrecords: yep. looping only works with internal transport
2016-09-19 12:45:20	rgareus	duffrecords: MTC or Midi-click may work,  but it's doubtful that other clients will loop seamlessly
2016-09-19 12:46:49	rgareus	tom-: multiple different IDs for the same thing is not a good idea.
2016-09-19 12:47:03	rgareus	tom-: and strings are expensive anyway.
2016-09-19 12:47:29	duffrecords	so looping over a range with Hydrogen and Ardour in sync is a "your mileage may vary" situation?

2016-09-19 12:48:25	prh	can linux handle AES50 natively on an ethernet port?
2016-09-19 12:48:27	tom-	rgareus: what was thinking is a real display name, and a fixed relation of index and symbol
2016-09-19 12:49:45	tom-	prh: natively? some hardware certainly does
2016-09-19 12:49:52	rgareus	prh: no.
2016-09-19 12:50:39	prh	rgareus: thanks I thought not. what a shame :|
2016-09-19 12:50:43	rgareus	oh wait. Linux -- not ardour
2016-09-19 12:50:56	rgareus	well, it'd be the GNU in GNU/Linux

2016-09-19 12:51:18	tom-	rgareus: to not make it too expensive, you could even put a max length on "symbol"
2016-09-19 12:51:47	prh	AFAICT aes50 uses cat5 but not ethernet framing - but I'm not certain
2016-09-19 12:51:50	rgareus	prh: there are some endevours to write a jack-backend for AVB

2016-09-19 13:01:16	rgareus	ristic: automation below a region should be moved along automatically.  but I recall there was a bug

2016-09-20 00:39:05	rgareus	[22:51:50] prh: there are some endevours to write a jack-backend for AVB [22:51:50]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	rgareus	[22:53:05] prh: and there's  http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2012/program/19  (custom protocol from a " Mamba Digital Snake" 64 chan -- not AES) [22:53:05]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	LAbot	[22:53:06] Title: LAC 2012: Linux Audio Conference (at lac.linuxaudio.org) [22:53:06]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	prh	[22:53:36] rgareus: thanks [22:53:36]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	rgareus	[22:53:42] prh: https://github.com/AVnu/Open-AVB  [22:53:42]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	rgareus	[22:54:03] ^^ has a jack client and uses the PLL on the ethernet device [22:54:03]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	prh	[22:54:17] I wodner how the latency works out [22:54:17]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	rgareus	[22:58:11] tom-: I don't see the point.  uint32_t is sufficient. and CPU native [22:58:11]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	tom-	[22:59:15] is lv2:symbol superfluous then? [22:59:15]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	rgareus	[22:59:21] a script is still a program. why jump though hoops? [22:59:21]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	rgareus	[22:59:57] lv2 URIDs are mapped to integers. the program operats on integers thoughout [22:59:57]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	rgareus	[23:00:03] operates* [23:00:03]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	tom-	[23:00:34] symbol is not mandatory there [23:00:34]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	ristic	[23:00:44] Is there a way to move automation and regions at the same time? [23:00:44]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	rgareus	[23:00:44] it is. read the spec again [23:00:44]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	tom-	[23:00:50] err.. it is mandatory, whatever. it needs to be there [23:00:50]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	rgareus	[23:01:16] ristic: automation below a region should be moved along automatically.  but I recall there was a bug [23:01:16]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	tom-	[23:01:27] so why having this redundancy, is it superfluous? [23:01:27]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	ristic	[23:01:28] I drag select a box with the mouse to move a whole lot of regions a few bars forward and the automation stays where it was. [23:01:28]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	rgareus	[23:02:38] tom-: I'm sorry. I still need to get some work done and don't have time to explain.  I suggest to do your homework first. the spec is online and explains it [23:02:38]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	rgareus	[23:03:20] ristic: which version of Ardour is that? [23:03:20]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	rgareus	[23:03:27] ristic: audio or midi region? [23:03:27]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	ristic	[23:03:36] 5.3.0 official [23:03:36]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	tom-	[23:03:43] rgareus: introducing a symbol per port would not be more or less a good or bad thing than what lv2 does [23:03:43]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	ristic	[23:03:43] on both it seems. [23:03:43]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	tom-	[23:03:50] rgareus: and you referred to that spec initially [23:03:50]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	tom-	[23:03:53] rgareus: think about it [23:03:53]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	rgareus	[23:04:40] tom-: I begin to think you're trolling. [23:04:40]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	rgareus	[23:05:42] ristic: I recall reading here on IRC that there's some issue with automation points being dragged along in 5.X. but I don't know the details [23:05:42]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	rgareus	[23:05:58] nick_m: do you remember? [23:05:58]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	rgareus	[23:06:30] ristic: http://tracker.ardour.org/view.php?id=7022 [23:06:30]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	LAbot	[23:06:31] Title: 0007022: Automation points are not moved with their associated region - MantisBT (at tracker.ardour.org) [23:06:31]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	tom-	[23:08:20] rgareus: do you want me to start doing that? [23:08:20]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	tom-	[23:10:40] rgareus: "A port MUST have exactly one lv2:symbol." "A port MUST have exactly one lv2:index." [23:10:40]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	tom-	[23:11:10] rgareus: it totally makes sense [23:11:10]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	tom-	[23:11:39] rgareus: since a "machine and human readable" unique id is very handy [23:11:39]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	tom-	[23:12:03] rgareus: if you think it doesn't make sense. why would you adhere to the spec in other areas to much. [23:12:03]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	tom-	[23:13:00] now if you say that's what you said it is. i can't help you and you probably can't help me. [23:13:00]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	rgareus	[23:16:45] tom-: I probably can't help you. [23:16:45]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	rgareus	[23:17:58] I tried, but it seems there's some disconnect. [23:17:58]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	rgareus	[23:18:18] maybe someone else can explain this better to you. [23:18:18]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	tom-	[23:19:16] no worries, good we found it out for that context [23:19:16]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	tom-	[23:20:14] rgareus: if you have knowledge of reasons for disconnect, please let me know [23:20:14]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	tom-	[23:22:18] it feels like to be not totally in the same team, is it that [23:22:18]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	tom-	[23:27:04] rgareus: there were times we could interact in a team-like way, do you remember? [23:27:04]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	tom-	[23:28:32] then again, it's about interfaces [23:28:32]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	tom-	[23:29:02] lv2 is quite popular, it has that symbol. [23:29:02]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	tom-	[23:29:13] l8erz [23:29:13]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	ristic	[00:28:51] Thanks rgareus  [00:28:51]

2016-09-20 18:53:15	nstewart	[15:51:46] fixed bugs stay in fixed until  a numbered release? (aka https://ardour.org/whatsnew.html) [15:51:46]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	las	[15:52:10] nstewart: ? [15:52:10]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	nstewart	[15:53:56] ie, #7004 was fixed a couple weeks ago, but after 5.3 was released. [15:53:56]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	nstewart	[15:54:06] There hasn't been a 5.4 [15:54:06]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	nstewart	[15:54:55] ie don't close it [15:54:55]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	las	[15:55:09] nstewart: "closed" status is left to reporters [15:55:09]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	las	[15:55:19] nstewart: if they consider it fixed in git, they can close it [15:55:19]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	nstewart	[15:55:57] that'd be me. will close. [15:55:57]

2016-09-20 18:53:15	paas44	[17:17:48] @las, Hi I'm getting along quit well with the cc121 driver, I'm not too familair with ardour though what would be a good mapping [17:17:48]
2016-09-20 18:53:15	paas44	[17:18:44] @las e.g for now I've mappped to jog wheel to rewind and forward so I don't need the specific rewind and forward buttons [17:18:44]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	paas44	[17:19:13] @las What would I map these too or should these be user configurable just like the function buttons? [17:19:13]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	las	[17:42:04] paas44: i would them function like the jog wheel in our mackie control support, i really like that behaviour (fake-scrolls the playhead then actually locates after some inactivity) [17:42:04]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	las	[17:47:19] paas44: i mean, "i would make the jog wheel function like ..." [17:47:19]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	las	[17:47:33] paas44: and leave fwd + rewind buttons to do just that [17:47:33]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	paas44	[17:53:25] las: okay I will use the buttons for fwd and rewind [17:53:25]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	las	[17:54:00] paas44: you'll probably have to hunt around for the code for that in mackie support and copy-paste it over [17:54:00]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	las	[17:54:21] paas44: AFAIR, it isn't part of the any of the base classes [17:54:21]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	paas44	[17:54:30] las: yes will do, will use mackie way for jog [17:54:30]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	las	[17:54:41] paas44: once there are two users of it, we can see what can be factored out and re-used [17:54:41]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	paas44	[17:55:29] las: what about the many eq buttons on cc121, can I map these to ardour's eq plugin [17:55:29]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	las	[17:59:23] paas44: ardour doesn't have an EQ plugin [17:59:23]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	las	[17:59:53] paas44: we do expose EQ plugin controls, but on ardour they will all return null [17:59:53]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	tnaugle	[18:00:12] a-eq  :) [18:00:12]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	las	[18:00:19] paas44: because at present we have no way for anything to be labelled as "this is the EQ plugin" [18:00:19]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	paas44	[18:00:23] las: okay so not possible to map these to a-eq? [18:00:23]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	las	[18:00:27] paas44: or at least, not an agreed upon method [18:00:27]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	deva	[18:05:35] I'm getting a "source not found: 'session_archive_dialog.cc'" right after configure on a clean checkout. missing file? or missing deleted entry in Makefile? [18:05:35]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	deva	[18:06:23] .. it's in the ardour/gtk2_ardour folder [18:06:23]

2016-09-21 02:35:33	deva	Did the version requirement for glibmm increase during the last couple of weeks?
2016-09-21 02:35:40	deva	I get this linker error: http://pastebin.com/BX7xsvs2
2016-09-21 02:35:54	deva	... which goes on and on with similar output
2016-09-21 02:36:46	rgareus	deva: not that I know
2016-09-21 02:37:08	deva	ok, then it's probably me who broken something ;)
2016-09-21 02:37:08		[02:37]
2016-09-21 02:37:13	rgareus	maybe a mising #include 
2016-09-21 02:37:16	-->	phoracek (~phoracek@ip-89-102-24-203.net.upcbroadband.cz) has joined #ardour
2016-09-21 02:37:44	rgareus	mmh libs/ardour/vst_info_file.cc does have   #include <glibmm.h> so that's not it
2016-09-21 02:38:11	rgareus	deva: try a clean rebuild. I've seen a similar case on OSX.
2016-09-21 02:38:13	deva	rgareus, it's a linker error, so it would be a missing -lgtkmm or something
2016-09-21 02:38:20	deva	I just did
2016-09-21 02:38:38	rgareus	the new glibmm has a C++11 version of Glib::build_filename.  and I had an old .o that used the old version
2016-09-21 02:39:25	rgareus	deva: a failed build should show the compiler invocation.   or use   ./waf -vv
2016-09-21 02:39:26	deva	I'll try recompiling glibmm then. I may have upgraded my compiler at some point since last I compiled it
2016-09-21 02:39:52	rgareus	   Glib::build_filename(std::__cxx11::basic_string ....    ) so ardour wants the gcc5, C++11 version
2016-09-21 02:40:12	deva	When you say "new glibmm" which version are you referring to?
2016-09-21 02:40:42	rgareus	ardour is happy with 2.32.0 or later
2016-09-21 02:41:04	rgareus	debian bumped to 2.48.1  recently
2016-09-21 02:41:11	deva	ok. I have 2.48.1, so that should be fine
2016-09-21 02:41:11	rgareus	from 2.42
2016-09-21 02:42:15	rgareus	deva: try     grep __cxx11 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglibmm-2.4.so
2016-09-21 02:42:42	deva	empty output
2016-09-21 02:42:48	rgareus	there you go
2016-09-21 02:43:07	rgareus	here it says  "Binary file /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglibmm-2.4.so matches
2016-09-21 02:43:56	rgareus	so your glibmm is a gcc4 version no C++11,  and ardour is compiled with gcc5 (or --cxx11 config option) -> Glib::build_filename(std::__cxx11 ...
2016-09-21 02:44:25	deva	yup. that seemed to do the trick
2016-09-21 02:44:28	deva	Thanks :-)

2016-09-21 12:41:36	deva	[12:35:54] ... which goes on and on with similar output [12:35:54]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	rgareus	[12:36:46] deva: not that I know [12:36:46]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	deva	[12:37:08] ok, then it's probably me who broken something ;) [12:37:08]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	rgareus	[12:37:12] maybe a mising #include  [12:37:12]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	rgareus	[12:37:44] mmh libs/ardour/vst_info_file.cc does have   #include <glibmm.h> so that's not it [12:37:44]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	rgareus	[12:38:11] deva: try a clean rebuild. I've seen a similar case on OSX. [12:38:11]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	deva	[12:38:13] rgareus, it's a linker error, so it would be a missing -lgtkmm or something [12:38:13]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	deva	[12:38:20] I just did [12:38:20]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	rgareus	[12:38:38] the new glibmm has a C++11 version of Glib::build_filename.  and I had an old .o that used the old version [12:38:38]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	rgareus	[12:39:25] deva: a failed build should show the compiler invocation.   or use   ./waf -vv [12:39:25]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	deva	[12:39:26] I'll try recompiling glibmm then. I may have upgraded my compiler at some point since last I compiled it [12:39:26]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	rgareus	[12:39:52]    Glib::build_filename(std::__cxx11::basic_string ....    ) so ardour wants the gcc5, C++11 version [12:39:52]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	deva	[12:40:12] When you say "new glibmm" which version are you referring to? [12:40:12]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	rgareus	[12:40:42] ardour is happy with 2.32.0 or later [12:40:42]

2016-09-21 19:07:00	deva	[12:35:54] ... which goes on and on with similar output [12:35:54]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	rgareus	[12:36:46] deva: not that I know [12:36:46]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	deva	[12:37:08] ok, then it's probably me who broken something ;) [12:37:08]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	rgareus	[12:37:12] maybe a mising #include  [12:37:12]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	rgareus	[12:37:44] mmh libs/ardour/vst_info_file.cc does have   #include <glibmm.h> so that's not it [12:37:44]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	rgareus	[12:38:11] deva: try a clean rebuild. I've seen a similar case on OSX. [12:38:11]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	deva	[12:38:13] rgareus, it's a linker error, so it would be a missing -lgtkmm or something [12:38:13]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	deva	[12:38:20] I just did [12:38:20]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	rgareus	[12:38:38] the new glibmm has a C++11 version of Glib::build_filename.  and I had an old .o that used the old version [12:38:38]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	rgareus	[12:39:25] deva: a failed build should show the compiler invocation.   or use   ./waf -vv [12:39:25]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	deva	[12:39:26] I'll try recompiling glibmm then. I may have upgraded my compiler at some point since last I compiled it [12:39:26]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	rgareus	[12:39:52]    Glib::build_filename(std::__cxx11::basic_string ....    ) so ardour wants the gcc5, C++11 version [12:39:52]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	deva	[12:40:12] When you say "new glibmm" which version are you referring to? [12:40:12]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	rgareus	[12:40:42] ardour is happy with 2.32.0 or later [12:40:42]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	rgareus	[12:41:04] debian bumped to 2.48.1  recently [12:41:04]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	deva	[12:41:11] ok. I have 2.48.1, so that should be fine [12:41:11]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	rgareus	[12:41:11] from 2.42 [12:41:11]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	rgareus	[12:42:15] deva: try     grep __cxx11 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglibmm-2.4.so [12:42:15]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	deva	[12:42:42] empty output [12:42:42]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	rgareus	[12:42:48] there you go [12:42:48]

2016-09-22 00:23:53	rgareus	[12:37:44] mmh libs/ardour/vst_info_file.cc does have   #include <glibmm.h> so that's not it [12:37:44]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	rgareus	[12:38:11] deva: try a clean rebuild. I've seen a similar case on OSX. [12:38:11]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	deva	[12:38:13] rgareus, it's a linker error, so it would be a missing -lgtkmm or something [12:38:13]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	deva	[12:38:20] I just did [12:38:20]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	rgareus	[12:38:38] the new glibmm has a C++11 version of Glib::build_filename.  and I had an old .o that used the old version [12:38:38]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	rgareus	[12:39:25] deva: a failed build should show the compiler invocation.   or use   ./waf -vv [12:39:25]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	deva	[12:39:26] I'll try recompiling glibmm then. I may have upgraded my compiler at some point since last I compiled it [12:39:26]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	rgareus	[12:39:52]    Glib::build_filename(std::__cxx11::basic_string ....    ) so ardour wants the gcc5, C++11 version [12:39:52]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	deva	[12:40:12] When you say "new glibmm" which version are you referring to? [12:40:12]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	rgareus	[12:40:42] ardour is happy with 2.32.0 or later [12:40:42]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	rgareus	[12:41:04] debian bumped to 2.48.1  recently [12:41:04]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	deva	[12:41:11] ok. I have 2.48.1, so that should be fine [12:41:11]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	rgareus	[12:41:11] from 2.42 [12:41:11]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	rgareus	[12:42:15] deva: try     grep __cxx11 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglibmm-2.4.so [12:42:15]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	deva	[12:42:42] empty output [12:42:42]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	rgareus	[12:42:48] there you go [12:42:48]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	rgareus	[12:43:07] here it says  "Binary file /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglibmm-2.4.so matches [12:43:07]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	rgareus	[12:43:56] so your glibmm is a gcc4 version no C++11,  and ardour is compiled with gcc5 (or --cxx11 config option) -> Glib::build_filename(std::__cxx11 ... [12:43:56]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	deva	[12:44:25] yup. that seemed to do the trick [12:44:25]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	deva	[12:44:28] Thanks :-) [12:44:28]

2016-09-22 00:23:53	prokoudine	[14:48:22] las: any luck finding a webdev? [14:48:22]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	prokoudine	[14:48:30] ahah [14:48:30]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	prokoudine	[14:48:32] i did it again [14:48:32]

2016-09-22 00:23:53	MaurizioB	[19:04:43] there's a guy who's trying to build mloop ( http://fuzzle.org/~petern/mloop.html ) [19:04:43]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	LAbot	[19:04:44] Title: It's mloop (at fuzzle.org) [19:04:44]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	MaurizioB	[19:05:05] which has a waf script requiring jack >= 0.116.2, but he has jack2 and it doesn't recognize it [19:05:05]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	MaurizioB	[19:05:12] any suggestion? [19:05:12]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	petererer	[19:06:13] oh my, it's not particularly user friendly software [19:06:13]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	MaurizioB	[19:06:56] petererer: I don't know, but he wants to give it a shot [19:06:56]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	petererer	[19:08:54] in src/wscript there's atleast_version, i guess removing that would work [19:08:54]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	MaurizioB	[19:09:14] petererer: I was thinking the same, let's see [19:09:14]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	MaurizioB	[19:25:16] petererer: he was missing the libjack-dev package [19:25:16]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	MaurizioB	[19:25:20] thanks, btw [19:25:20]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	petererer	[19:25:28] ah well that would do it :) [19:25:28]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	MaurizioB	[19:27:39] :) [19:27:39]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	MaurizioB	[21:44:52] ok, here I am, again with a question about ALSA. I know it's a bit off topic, but I don't know where to ask (and #alsa usually is not very chatty) [21:44:52]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	MaurizioB	[21:45:25] does anyone know what's the difference between SYNC_READ/WRITE and SUBS_READ/WRITE for MIDI port capabilities? [21:45:25]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	MaurizioB	[21:48:26] well, I could ask on #lad too, actually [21:48:26]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Caterpillar	[21:52:42] Ardour can import stuff from Nuendo? I have searched on Google but it is a discussion of ~10 years ago [21:52:42]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Caterpillar	[21:52:51] (just curious) [21:52:51]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	MaurizioB	[21:57:03] Caterpillar: I don't think so, not directly [21:57:03]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Caterpillar	[21:58:23] mmh ok [21:58:23]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Caterpillar	[22:00:55] now I have to go to sleep [22:00:55]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	jerkface	[05:01:54] I just ripped some vynal using a turntable with no pre-amp.  I now need to re-normalize the bass levels.   Is there a plug-in with presets that will help with this correction? [05:01:54]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	jerkface	[05:12:07] I would manually EQ it myself, but I want it to sound like the original recording.  In other words, I need RIAA EQ preset. [05:12:07]

2016-09-22 00:23:53	jerkface	[06:27:15] Found it.  it was  in filters category as a preset in Calf Emphasis [06:27:15]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	jerkface	[06:46:37] Thankyou and goodnight [06:46:37]

2016-09-22 06:27:18	wargreen	hi here !
2016-09-22 06:27:48	wargreen	What you think the best for adjust delay between two track ?
2016-09-22 06:28:58	las	wargreen: what's the context?
2016-09-22 06:29:12	wargreen	hi las !

2016-09-22 06:30:19	wargreen	I have a recording of a Bombo (a big percution) with Top / bottom / ambi, and I want to put inphase the top & bottom
2016-09-22 06:30:35	wargreen	so ajust +- 1.5ms
2016-09-22 06:31:31	las	wargreen: why not just nudge the whole track by that much before you start editing?
2016-09-22 06:34:14	frinknet	wargreen: there are two ways to play with pase. You either nudge the track or reverse the phase. Depending on what you are doing one may make more sense over the other.
2016-09-22 06:34:14		[06:34]
2016-09-22 06:34:39	wargreen	las, cause I search an universal solution without touch the edit
2016-09-22 06:35:18	wargreen	for record / live mixing, and without risk to forget a clip in the timeline :)
2016-09-22 06:35:41	las	wargreen: add a delay line plugin then
2016-09-22 06:35:45	las	wargreen: there are lots of tehm
2016-09-22 06:35:47	las	them
2016-09-22 06:35:50	wargreen	frinknet, in this situation i need to reverse the phase, more adjust the time
2016-09-22 06:36:14	wargreen	las, it seem to me than this plugins are more for big delay
2016-09-22 06:36:16	wargreen	no ?
2016-09-22 06:37:10	frinknet	wargreen: does not have to be a long delay

2016-09-22 06:38:04	wargreen	frinknet, ?
2016-09-22 06:39:01	frinknet	you can delay for a very short time period (i.e. small delays) does not have to be big
2016-09-22 06:39:07	wargreen	oops, i've don't see the "Calf Compensation delay"
2016-09-22 06:39:14	wargreen	so it's solved :)
2016-09-22 06:39:24	frinknet	yup that's the idea
2016-09-22 06:39:51	wargreen	but this feature directly inside ardour will be exellent !
2016-09-22 06:40:39	las	wargreen: what feature? we don't do stuff like that ...
2016-09-22 06:41:03	las	wargreen: and we *do* it already by offering nudging
2016-09-22 06:41:22	las	wargreen: select track, ctrl-a (select all in track), set nudge clock, press nudge button
2016-09-22 06:42:00	frinknet	las: I think he is talking about a global compensation delay setting for the track rather than nudging regions within the track
2016-09-22 06:42:54	las	frinknet: that doesn't make a lot of sense to me, personally
2016-09-22 06:43:06	las	frinknet: the region(s) remain in the wrong place on the timeline
2016-09-22 06:43:17	las	frinknet: if things need to be really fixed, they should be moved
2016-09-22 06:43:57	frinknet	las: I tend to agree with you. You setup your compensation for recording but place things in the proper place on the timeline.
2016-09-22 06:44:46	frinknet	I believe there is a recording delay that can be setup globally if I remember correctly.
2016-09-22 06:45:31	frinknet	And then as far as shifting things a compensation lv2 will allow more flexibility than something built in for strange circumstances
2016-09-22 06:46:06	wargreen	las, i'm sound enginer, and all digital mixing desk come with this feature
2016-09-22 06:46:44	wargreen	(and also use ardour for live mixing on music and dance show, or radio)
2016-09-22 06:47:42	frinknet	wargreen: what type of sound engineer? This makes more sense in live situations when managing multiple outs. A mixing desk is very different from virtual tape
2016-09-22 06:47:43	wargreen	an nice live mixing technic consist of put all mics in phase with the louder instrument
2016-09-22 06:48:20	wargreen	frinknet, essentialy live, but studio right now

2016-09-22 06:49:20	frinknet	Ardour is really only meant for studio use right now. Some are starting to use it for live applications but it has not been designed to replace your mixing desk just yet.
2016-09-22 06:51:04	wargreen	when you have, for eg, two kik track (in, out) you can just invert the phase, but the best is to adjust it for virtualy get one mic

2016-09-22 06:51:29	frinknet	Compensation Delay is probably going to be more flexible. I really don't see where building this into Ardour would add significant value to the product. It is likely to just be one more piece to debug which few people ever use. It's best to avoid built-ins of that type.
2016-09-22 06:51:39	wargreen	and in studio, adjust this in the timeline it risky (at my sense)
2016-09-22 06:52:16	frinknet	In the case of the kick a compensation delay plugin will be much more flexible
2016-09-22 06:52:29	frinknet	You may want to do some processing and then add compensation

2016-09-22 06:52:59	frinknet	A built-in would make this difficult.
2016-09-22 06:54:03	wargreen	frinknet, yes Compensation Delay is exactly what i've searched. But take a look to the major "commercial" softs, it come with delay/track
2016-09-22 06:54:25	las	frinknet: i wouldn't say that it is true that ardour isn't there for live ... Tracks Live is specifically for live PA work and is just a reworked GUI for ardour
2016-09-22 06:54:51	las	frinknet, wargreen: we will be adding CD to ardour one day, because we need it for busses
2016-09-22 06:55:20	<--	falktx|work (~falktx@185.19.197.52) has quit (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
2016-09-22 06:55:36	las	we're not going to add it until we add it for busses, which is more complex than it appears because of the need for an extremely smooth interpolating delay line, among other things
2016-09-22 06:55:52	 *	the_CLA_2 also prefers using a delay rather than nudging things around.
2016-09-22 06:56:18	frinknet	makes total sense. I can see where busses will need this feature. And yes, deceptively difficult...
2016-09-22 06:56:29	wargreen	Yoohoo !
2016-09-22 06:57:48	frinknet	Well then... Glad to provide the voice of devil's advocate. Better products result from healthy debate! :-)
2016-09-22 06:58:17	rgareus	write a script then, which nudges regions automatically
2016-09-22 06:58:31	rgareus	but really just calibrate latency -> no need to nudge.
2016-09-22 06:59:01	las	rgareus: per channel?
2016-09-22 06:59:22	frinknet	rgareus: if you have phase issues (original mentioned problem) you still will have need for compensation.
2016-09-22 06:59:41	 *	the_CLA_2 now uses the x42 "No Delay Line" at this can be used for sample accurate adjustments. Just have to remember to uncheck "report delay as latency".
2016-09-22 06:59:56	frinknet	Also phase issues are often addressed after the fact in the studio.
2016-09-22 07:02:13	frinknet	las: I didn't realize that you considered the forks of Ardour (Mixbus, Tracks Live, etc) to be still Ardour... They are mostly Ardour but in my mind I see them as steered by separate people with different intended goals than the original project.
2016-09-22 07:02:26	las	frinknet: well sure, but the engine is the same
2016-09-22 07:02:31	las	frinknet: sure, the GUI is important
2016-09-22 07:02:44	rgareus	the_CLA_2: remind me someday to add a mode "only report latency"..    (I'll put this on the todo after "pick up MOD power supply from the_CLA_2's place :)
2016-09-22 07:02:48	las	frinknet: but then the argument is more like "ardour is too complex for live PA use"
2016-09-22 07:03:08	las	frinknet: which i do agree with 
2016-09-22 07:03:41	frinknet	las: I'm more talking from a project trajectory sort of view. I understand that in most cases they just skin Ardour and rename.
2016-09-22 07:03:42	the_CLA_2	rgareus: Hehe. I try to think of it. ^.^
2016-09-22 07:04:16	 *	the_CLA_2 throws some No Delay Lines at yesterdays session. ;)
2016-09-22 07:04:16		[07:04]
2016-09-22 07:04:18	wargreen	Ardour is the best tool i've try to live mix
2016-09-22 07:04:23	las	frinknet: that's also true, though the story with mixbus is more complicated
2016-09-22 07:04:42	las	wargreen: i'd like to add one key feature that waves added
2016-09-22 07:04:57	las	wargreen: single button toggle between multi (physical) outs and master
2016-09-22 07:05:06	las	wargreen: makes virtual sound checks so easy
2016-09-22 07:05:14	wargreen	ho yeah !
2016-09-22 07:05:34	frinknet	I was curious how licensing worked on these projects... Are they purchasing a commercial license so that they can do a closed source fork or how does that play into things legally?
2016-09-22 07:06:45	the_CLA_2	frinknet: Both projects are open source as well. Only part about Mixbus wich is not open source is the DSP plugin.
2016-09-22 07:07:14	frinknet	I see. Where does one get their hands on the sourcecode for these?
2016-09-22 07:07:40	frinknet	I've searched but haven't found anything
2016-09-22 07:07:41	wargreen	las, a question : what can disable the PFL / AFL setup ?
2016-09-22 07:07:56	wargreen	it's happen yesterday when recording...
2016-09-22 07:07:56	rgareus	frinknet: source-code of what? waves/tracks and Mixbus?
2016-09-22 07:08:04	frinknet	yes
2016-09-22 07:08:06	the_CLA_2	frinknet: IIRC Waves has a link on the product page. For Harrison you might want to contact them.
2016-09-22 07:08:41	rgareus	frinknet: GPL: if you don't have the binary, you don't have a right to the source-code either.
2016-09-22 07:09:02	frinknet	Right.
2016-09-22 07:09:10	rgareus	you only need to provide source to users...  email harrison support
2016-09-22 07:09:13	rgareus	or waves support
2016-09-22 07:09:47	rgareus	frinknet: then again 99% of harrison-mixbus is identical to ardour-git.
2016-09-22 07:10:14	rgareus	even the binary bundle build-scripts for Mixbus are in ardour-git
2016-09-22 07:10:25	frinknet	RIght. I think the only really thing that Mixbus changed was the mixer layout
2016-09-22 07:10:41	frinknet	The editing is the same

2016-09-22 07:11:06	frinknet	Waves changed a bit more if my memory serves me correctly. It's been a while since I tried them out.
2016-09-22 07:12:11	rgareus	frinknet: http://www.waves.com/downloads/tracks-live  has a source-code link

2016-09-22 07:12:37	rgareus	IIRC it needs a user-account though
2016-09-22 07:12:50	frinknet	yes it does. WIll have to look at that.
2016-09-22 07:13:17	-->	JackWinter (~jack@vodsl-8402.vo.lu) has joined #ardour
2016-09-22 07:14:10	rgareus	frinknet: there are a few #ifdef MIXBUS in ardour-git.   some stuff is not yet in ardour-git (quick/dirty patches that need cleanup), but the long-term goal is to have everything upstream.
2016-09-22 07:14:45	frinknet	rgareus: wow. That's impressive!
2016-09-22 07:15:13	rgareus	and it's only GUI related hacks that are /forked/
2016-09-22 07:15:32	rgareus	all libs/  are identical in ardour+mixbus  -- current Mixbus 3.X is based on Ardour 4.7ish
2016-09-22 07:15:34	frinknet	So basically at that point Harrison is just acting as a marketer of Ardour with a different name on the box
2016-09-22 07:15:42	rgareus	and DSP
2016-09-22 07:16:00	frinknet	Waves looks like they have changed a lot more of the interface.
2016-09-22 07:16:03	rgareus	the channelstrip plugin is a LADSPA plugin loaded at runtime
2016-09-22 07:16:12	frinknet	well yes. ANd DSP
2016-09-22 07:17:39	rgareus	more than "marketer".  Harrison does contribute a lot to Ardour development
2016-09-22 07:17:55	rgareus	and also gives back a share of the income.
2016-09-22 07:18:28	las	wargreen: PFL/AFL is only available with a monitor section
2016-09-22 07:18:57	las	frinknet: Tracks Live is a radically different GUI except in the editor canvas area
2016-09-22 07:19:14	frinknet	I've been pleased with what Ardour has become thanks to Harrison. Seems like a lot of workflow things have been addressed as a result of their involvement.
2016-09-22 07:19:55	frinknet	Has Waves been more standoffish from contributing back or are they also playing nice?
2016-09-22 07:19:55		[07:19]
2016-09-22 07:19:56	rgareus	it's a healty collaboration.

2016-09-22 07:20:40	frinknet	Didn't Presonus also do their own version of Ardour?
2016-09-22 07:20:46	frinknet	rgareus: Meaning?
2016-09-22 07:21:42	rgareus	"When collaborating, people work together (co-labor) on a single shared goal."    "When cooperating, people perform together (co-operate) while working on selfish yet common goals."
2016-09-22 07:22:01	frinknet	I see
2016-09-22 07:22:06	las	frinknet: waves are no longer working on an ardour-based product as far as future plans go
2016-09-22 07:22:14	wargreen	las, at this moment the monitoring was been avtivited
2016-09-22 07:22:24	wargreen	activited, and used
2016-09-22 07:22:24	frinknet	I read corporation rather than cooperation.
2016-09-22 07:22:37	las	frinknet: tracks live will continue to receive maintainance and possible updates going forward - i am not in a position to know precisely what
2016-09-22 07:22:47	 *	wargreen discover the inline visualisation, and love it
2016-09-22 07:23:18	las	frinknet: presonus have never done anything wtih ardour; i did meet with the company founder. in the end they hired the guy behind cubase + nuendo and he reimplemented it all for a 3rd time as studio one
2016-09-22 07:23:30	las	wargreen: sorry, i don't really even understand the question
2016-09-22 07:23:34	frinknet	I see. Seems like Waves cannot stay with a single product line for more than 18 months. They have solid products but poor longevity.
2016-09-22 07:23:49	las	frinknet: it wasn't that so much as what they hoped for from ardour versus what it is
2016-09-22 07:23:55	las	frinknet: what they wanted: a DAW toolkit
2016-09-22 07:24:00	las	frinknet: what is is: an actual DAW
2016-09-22 07:24:15	las	frinknet: tracks live is feature complete at this time
2016-09-22 07:24:30	frinknet	I see. Ardour is still the closest thing to a DAW toolkit I'm aware of...
2016-09-22 07:24:42	rgareus	JUCE
2016-09-22 07:25:03	frinknet	I remember the last time we talk a bit we were talking about the DAW vs DAW Toolkit futire of Ardour...
2016-09-22 07:25:50	frinknet	rgareus: JUCE doesn't have enough track region management to be a DAW Toolkit it is more of an audio widget library at this point IMHO
2016-09-22 07:26:16	las	frinknet: JUCE is closely connected to other things
2016-09-22 07:26:29	frinknet	True
2016-09-22 07:26:51	las	frinknet: i'm not going to blab more ... i only found out what waves were doing because someone mistakenly included me on an email Cc: :)
2016-09-22 07:27:04	frinknet	Seems like there is a love/hate relationship with JUCE and the open source world. I've not dug deeper to understand why this exists...
2016-09-22 07:27:14	las	frinknet: it didn't exist when ardour started
2016-09-22 07:27:27	las	frinknet: if it had, i would likely have seriously considered using it
2016-09-22 07:27:47	las	frinknet: at this point switching *to* any GUI toolkit is almost certainly 10x more work than the value we'd get from it
2016-09-22 07:28:25	frinknet	Yes. I've been using Ardour for over a decade. And I remember vinding JUCE in its infancy a long while back when FLTK was more active.
2016-09-22 07:28:38	wargreen	las, sorry, i write speedly, i'm in mix session :). So, yesterday, in recording session, I used the afl monitor for get my monitor without affect the musician monitor. And i don't know after what, but at a moment all it's in SiP, and the monitor setup don't change anything. (sorry also for my frenchness, and my english difficultys...)
2016-09-22 07:28:54	las	wargreen: i have no suggestions, sorry

2016-09-22 07:48:20	frinknet	las: I've heard you repeat this mantra about GDK so often it should probably be in the welcome message... ;-)
2016-09-22 07:48:27	frinknet	:-P
2016-09-22 07:50:10	las	wargreen: the debug version is a bit slower than the optimzied one but not much
2016-09-22 07:50:26	las	wargreen: there's no real issue using it in production unless your DSP values are already over 60% or so
2016-09-22 07:50:42	las	frinknet: GTK is a different story
2016-09-22 07:51:18	frinknet	Yes. The only thing left that uses stock GTK is the file dialogs. Just about anyway...
2016-09-22 07:52:33	frinknet	Also with the changes in GTK3 they are not so much a toolkit now as they are a framework or app platform

2016-09-22 07:55:07	frinknet	I imagine you are tired of reminding everyone that Ardour is not looking to chase the new latest and greatest toolkit bandwagon.

2016-09-22 11:02:39	las	frinknet: not in the push2 branch
2016-09-22 11:02:54	las	frinknet: this is mostly just about as immediate of a utilization fo the device as i can manage

2016-09-22 11:49:47	las	wargreen: ask rgareus 
2016-09-22 11:50:57	wargreen	rgareus, know you a tips (or lua script) for copy and past a full track configuration beetwen sessions ?
2016-09-22 11:51:28	wargreen	or at least the plug-ins and settings
2016-09-22 11:52:17	las	wargreen: this is not *between* sessions
2016-09-22 11:52:40	las	wargreen: session templates can be used for "full track configuration" re-use, but they do NOT copy any data between them
2016-09-22 11:52:40	wargreen	las, what you mean ?
2016-09-22 11:53:06	las	wargreen: mixer settings stuff is to copy the settings of a track inside a session to another track inside the same session
2016-09-22 11:53:25	las	wargreen: there is nothing that exists at present (that works) which will copy data contents of another session's tracks
2016-09-22 11:53:49	wargreen	ok, misexplanation for my need, sorry
2016-09-22 11:53:56	wargreen	of my need
2016-09-22 11:56:34	wargreen	so maybe we can import a template on an exiting track with a lua script ?
2016-09-22 11:56:59	las	wargreen: track templates already exist and do not need Lua
2016-09-22 11:57:24	las	wargreen: when you create a new track you are offered the chance to use any existing track templates via the Configuration dropdown in the "Add Track/Bus" dialog
2016-09-22 11:57:36	las	wargreen: again, no data
2016-09-22 11:57:36	wargreen	las, yes, but we can't apply theses parameters on an existing track
2016-09-22 11:57:44	las	wargreen: correct
2016-09-22 11:57:55	wargreen	and it the point
2016-09-22 11:59:15	wargreen	i have two equivalent big session, and i can't redo all handly. So i search how to copy my previous work in the new session :)
2016-09-22 11:59:43	wargreen	without recreate all my tracks

2016-09-22 12:03:26	rgareus	wargreen: if you have the source-code around and configured ardour with the dummy backend...
2016-09-22 12:03:41	rgareus	wargreen: ...   cd session_utils;  ./run ardour5-copy-mixer --help
2016-09-22 12:04:15	rgareus	it's easier to copy settings while the session is not loaded (ie using a standalone tool)
2016-09-22 12:05:24	wargreen	rgareus, humhum i take a look ! I actualy search what copy in the session file :)

2016-09-22 12:07:03	rgareus	and in ^^ case also hardcodes windows '\' path separators
2016-09-22 12:08:24	rgareus	it's not a versatile generic script (not suitable to be included upstream), but it solves a problem for his case, so that's fine.
2016-09-22 12:09:35	wargreen	rgareus, his script seem to write the state in a .txt file, so maybe it can be used for export to another session ?
2016-09-22 12:09:55	rgareus	yes, I suppose so

2016-09-22 12:18:40	wargreen	rgareus, do i need to build ardour from the sources for use ./run ?
2016-09-22 12:19:11	rgareus	wargreen: depends on which OS and where you got ardour from.
2016-09-22 12:19:37	rgareus	waf install   does deply session-utils  you should have  ardour5-copy-mixer in $PATH
2016-09-22 12:19:46	rgareus	s/deply/deploy/
2016-09-22 12:19:59	wargreen	rgareus, i run debian sid and i've take the sources via github
2016-09-22 12:20:19	rgareus	but ardour needs to be built with the dummy backend (session utils depend on it,  most distros don't do that, nor do we with optimized builds)
2016-09-22 12:24:32	wargreen	ok, i go take a deeper look in the lua script, for see if i can get something usable in most case. I use ardour on many OSs and computer (for record, mix, give workshop or other...) and i can't rebuild for all at each version :)

2016-09-22 13:20:42	wargreen	rgareus, what's the difference between set_processor_param and set_processor_insert_param ? And is it possible to iter() on theses parameters ?
2016-09-22 13:26:00		[13:20]
2016-09-22 13:26:00	rgareus	they correspond to the internal libardour API.  if you have a Processor Object user the former,  if you have a Plugin   use  set_plugin_insert_param.
2016-09-22 13:26:19	rgareus	a PluginInsert is-a Processor
2016-09-22 13:27:07	rgareus	a PluginInsert  has Plugin(s) inside

2016-09-22 13:28:26	rgareus	all things in the Processor Box are Processors,   they can be  Inserts, Fader, Trim  (ardour internal Proc) or PluginInserts (LV2, LADSPA,..)   
2016-09-22 13:29:05	rgareus	the PluginInsert in turn contains the actual plugin inststances which can be one or many (e.g. replicated instances of mono plugins on stereo tracks)
2016-09-22 13:30:44	rgareus	usually     set_processor_param() will be the correct API (use the top-level object, don't care about the internals)
2016-09-22 13:31:49	rgareus	see scripts/s_pluginutils.lua 
2016-09-22 13:33:29	wargreen	yes, i read this. But can i get all the processor_param, or iter on theses ?
2016-09-22 13:34:17	wargreen	i don't really understand whitch object contain other in the lua API (and i'm poor dev :)
2016-09-22 13:34:21	rgareus	only for plugins
2016-09-22 13:34:40	rgareus	search for   plugin:parameter_count()   in http://manual.ardour.org/lua-scripting/brain_dump/
2016-09-22 13:36:54	wargreen	ok, i think i understant a little bit
2016-09-22 13:37:20	rgareus	ardour internal processors (fader, etc) don't have "parameter descriptors" like plugins
2016-09-22 13:38:02	rgareus	they probably should have... but don't.
2016-09-22 13:41:26	wargreen	maybe i can get the fader parameter via amp():gain_control() (as in the first script) and the plugins param via get_processor_param ?
2016-09-22 13:41:26		[13:41]
2016-09-22 13:42:10	rgareus	there's some historical baggage.  internal Proc do have  AutomationType and also dedicated access functions for the controllable

2016-09-22 15:13:47	Nickwiz	I have been using Audacity for a while to clean up and fix various recordings. It works nice, is simple enough etc. but one thing I miss is the ability to do playback tuning. E.g., for EQ one have to 1. tune EQ 2. play "sample" ... nah, that was not it, 1. tune EQ 2. play sample ... nah, that was not it 1 mod EQ etc.
2016-09-22 15:13:48		[15:13]
2016-09-22 15:14:17	Nickwiz	Is Ardour a more in-line program?
2016-09-22 15:14:37	wargreen	Nickwiz, what you mean by "in-line" ?
2016-09-22 15:14:52	Nickwiz	As in I can plya-back and tune at the same time
2016-09-22 15:15:06	wargreen	in ardour, the FX (and so the EQs) are processed in realtime
2016-09-22 15:15:18	wargreen	yes, you can ear what you do
2016-09-22 15:15:28	Stuzz	Audacity is destructive (right?), Ardour isn;t
2016-09-22 15:16:08	Nickwiz	In Audacity most of the plugins requre you to set settings then do a sample playback, (as in two separate operations), then modify settings, then playback etc.
2016-09-22 15:16:39	Nickwiz	Stuzz: What do you man by destructive?
2016-09-22 15:16:59	Stuzz	Nickwiz: It alters the audio file
2016-09-22 15:17:18	Nickwiz	Not in place. It uses buffer and temp files.
2016-09-22 15:18:00	Stuzz	I haven't used it much so yeah..  I'm asking you (more or less) :)
2016-09-22 15:19:16	Stuzz	My understand is, Audacity is an audio editor which changes audio files (destructive), while DAWs (like Ardour) are non-destructive in that they apply effects to audio files without doing anything to the file itself.
2016-09-22 15:19:18	Nickwiz	Buffer as memory and a complete set of (its own) fragment files. It does *not* edit file in place (though you can likely force it to do so).
2016-09-22 15:19:57	Stuzz	OK

2016-09-22 15:24:24	Nickwiz	Audacity creates “project-files”, typically in /tmp, or your desired destination. It creates typically hundreds of sample files for quick access etc. It also gives quick undo and re-do of filters etc. All good. And it works great. But my issue is that you can not listen and tune at the same time.
2016-09-22 15:25:53	Nickwiz	If you are going to do a simple noice-reduction, notch-filter, compressor, leveler etc. it is often simple and nice enough. But the "live-tuning" is not part of the design.
2016-09-22 15:27:29	Nickwiz	Ardour looks rather promising though. Even for "that kond of use" – Though I can not state that, really, as I've just started testing it.
2016-09-22 15:28:27	Nickwiz	Have used LMMS earlier. But lately it crashes once an hour so I've parked it for now.

2016-09-22 15:50:14	Nickwiz	As in “modify levels of variable input”. I.e. I  can select Effect > Equalization and use a nice UI for both draw / graph adj with B-spline, Cosine, Cubic in detailed levels. But I have to -  set > play Preview - set > Play preview - ... I can not play and set wile listening.
2016-09-22 15:51:19	Stuzz	Oh
2016-09-22 15:52:18	Stuzz	Then yes...  in Ardour (and more or less everything that isn't Audacity), you can modify effect parameters during playback.
2016-09-22 15:52:49	Nickwiz	Or Analyze -> Plot spectrum ... OK I want to lower 447 Hz -> Filter -> Notch -> Set aquirted Freq etc. But still Set -> Preview. Set -> Preview ...
2016-09-22 15:53:36	Nickwiz	Yes. Though I have to say Ardour is one of the more promising I've seen in a long time.

2016-09-22 16:53:33	las	frinknet: i see at least 3 things that are key to the live/bitwig workflow
2016-09-22 16:53:33		[16:53]
2016-09-22 16:54:07	las	frinknet: (1) beat/bar synchronization - you have to work to be out of time
2016-09-22 16:54:43	las	frinknet: (2) working with clips as objects that are disconnected from the timeline - you assemble them without being on a timeline
2016-09-22 16:55:01	las	frinknet: (3) being able to record/arrange timelines by recording the playback of clips
2016-09-22 16:55:20	frinknet	#2 is what I have been calling multiple playheads for lack of a better term
2016-09-22 16:56:26	frinknet	If #2 exists then there is only the issue of creating new content to begin a live looping environment
2016-09-22 16:56:36	las	frinknet: yeah, but its the wrong way to think about it, i am fairly certain 
2016-09-22 16:56:49	las	frinknet: live looping is a whole different beastie
2016-09-22 16:56:59	las	frinknet: sooperlooper already solves almost every issue 
2016-09-22 16:57:09	frinknet	For sure. One thing at a time...
2016-09-22 16:58:17	frinknet	I disagree that sooperlooper solves the problem. I'm still partial to freewheeling as a performance engine even with the ugly enterface
2016-09-22 16:58:20	Stuzz	Is number 2 similar to how seq24 works?
2016-09-22 16:58:38	las	frinknet: i don't consider that to be live looping
2016-09-22 16:58:49	las	frinknet: fun and worthwhile, but not live looping
2016-09-22 16:59:00	las	frinknet: and yes, closer to live/bitwig than sooperlooper
2016-09-22 17:00:36	frinknet	Honestly I find the workflow of freewheeling closer to the Boss paradigm that has most live loopers doing their thing. Luppp is the most like Bitwig/Ableton for what I've seen
2016-09-22 17:03:06	frinknet	Obviously this whole discussion is more theoretical than practical at this point. But I'm interested in understanding what is shaping things to move forward. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I'm excited to see how these things shape Ardour

2016-09-22 17:12:04	frinknet	For live looping, the most critical component is generating a pulse from the first loop from which to add multiples. Most live loopers today make this immensely uncomfortable.
2016-09-22 17:12:36	Stuzz	Isn't there a pulse before the first loop?
2016-09-22 17:13:55	frinknet	Stuzz: No. The first loop sets the tempo so to speak. Looping doesn't think of tempo so much as pulse. (first loop length) Look at Boss loop contests videos for the best demos of this.
2016-09-22 17:14:13	las	frinknet: live doesn't (or doesn't have to work that way)
2016-09-22 17:14:41	las	frinknet: you can tap-tempo in your desired tempo, or set it; then you can step-sequence 1-16 bars using that pulse
2016-09-22 17:15:08	frinknet	las: as far as the live loopers I known or have personally worked with (about 15 at this point) all use this method and prefer it.

2016-09-22 17:16:12	las	frinknet: the first loop length is defined by the tempo (plus meter, but they always seem to use 4 :)
2016-09-22 17:17:12	Stuzz	frinknet: That's fine, I'll take your word for it
2016-09-22 17:17:56	frinknet	las: I have never seen a professional looper chance their sense of micro timing on such a thing as playing to a metronome live.
2016-09-22 17:18:59	frinknet	Even the best studio musicians I've worked with can't lock into a metronome in less than two measures. However, live looping is usually started with something less than two measures.
2016-09-22 17:19:03	las	frinknet: what happens in live is that you press go on beat 2, 3 or 4 of the "loop", and recording starts on the next beat 1
2016-09-22 17:19:03	las	frinknet: it continues till you hit stop, and then it truncates appropriately
2016-09-22 17:19:54	las	frinknet: have you seen this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWc3W8WgFWw
2016-09-22 17:20:05	las	frinknet: the live flow doesn't require that you lock to the metronome
2016-09-22 17:20:52	frinknet	las: this is a boss looper he is using.
2016-09-22 17:21:05	frinknet	boss works the way I have just described

2016-09-22 17:23:43	frinknet	Here is a good example of exactly how a looper does her work.
2016-09-22 17:24:27	las	frinknet: really, i think they are equivalent
2016-09-22 17:24:28	las	frinknet: in live you'd start by saying "i'm within {1, 2, 3, ...} bars"
2016-09-22 17:24:30	las	frinknet: then the period between the onset of recording and the end is 1 bar and it will or can adjust to that
2016-09-22 17:24:32	las	frinknet: this lets you actually work with 2 bars instead of just 1
2016-09-22 17:24:32		[17:24]
2016-09-22 17:24:34	las	frinknet: i've watched many live loopers
2016-09-22 17:24:35	las	frinknet: some pre-boss, some post
2016-09-22 17:25:37	frinknet	The best loopers start with a pulse that is often sub measure so they can get the pedal to aproximate
2016-09-22 17:26:04	frinknet	approximate punch points...
2016-09-22 17:27:45	frinknet	I guess what I'm saying is that you're most of the way to live looping if you implement the bitwig style clips. However, the need to auto sync the tempo to the first clip as soon as it is live is the only thing that separates this from being a DJ looper and a live looper.
2016-09-22 17:30:36	frinknet	I've never seen a live looper use Ableton but I've seen lots of DJs use it. There are several similar philosophies in looping, but the start pulse is the large difference between the two.
2016-09-22 17:31:50	las	frinknet: i think both those scenarios are different from typical live use
2016-09-22 17:32:06	las	frinknet: the DJs are not really using it as a looping tool in any sophisticated sense
2016-09-22 17:32:19	las	frinknet: the typical use that i've seen in live is song building
2016-09-22 17:32:35	las	frinknet: slowly growing the number of clips in a scene
2016-09-22 17:32:49	las	frinknet: and eventually rendering some ordering of them to a timeline
2016-09-22 17:33:24	frinknet	las: that is what I've seen.
2016-09-22 17:34:32	frinknet	I think bitwig and ableton work well for the DJ tool. However not so well for live looping from scratch.
2016-09-22 17:34:32	--	naught101_ is now known as naught101
2016-09-22 17:34:49	las	frinknet: i've seen DJ's queue up entire songs as clips
2016-09-22 17:35:05	las	frinknet: they're entire set is just a set of scenes each with entire songs in them
2016-09-22 17:35:05	las	frinknet: it's a bit sad
2016-09-22 17:35:16	frinknet	las: I've not worked with DJs as much. But it makes sense
2016-09-22 17:35:29	las	but hey, if it works for them
2016-09-22 17:35:35	frinknet	Right
2016-09-22 17:36:22	frinknet	The reason I keep bringing up live looping is because it is extremely difficult to export their performance to a traditional DAW workflow currently
2016-09-22 17:36:47	las	frinknet: jesse chappell's thumbjam exports an ardour session :)
2016-09-22 17:36:56	las	frinknet: not quite the right tool but ...
2016-09-22 17:37:44	frinknet	Not seen thumbjam. At one point Freewheeling did but it's pretty unsupported today.
2016-09-22 17:40:08	frinknet	I've thought about reviving the project with a subset of the full freewheeling (Just looping without the midi engine)
2016-09-22 17:40:08		[17:40]
2016-09-22 17:41:39	frinknet	las: I'm trying to see if it's worrth doing if looping is going to end up in Ardour anyway. Your mention of Ableton Push 2 got me interested in exploring...
2016-09-22 17:41:54	las	frinknet: thumbjam was a looping player, not a looping recorder
2016-09-22 17:42:17	frinknet	I see. More of a DJ queueing tool.
2016-09-22 17:42:23	las	frinknet: no, not at all
2016-09-22 17:42:36	las	frinknet: instrument note samples, for actually playing
2016-09-22 17:42:48	frinknet	I see
2016-09-22 17:42:52	las	frinknet: it was extremely successful on iOS at the beginning. top 5 iOS music apps for a long time
2016-09-22 17:43:02	frinknet	interesting
2016-09-22 17:43:25	las	frinknet: had the same "pick a scale + root - now everything you play is "right"" approach
2016-09-22 17:43:33	las	frinknet: some nice samples too
2016-09-22 17:45:13	frinknet	I've seen a few iOS apps that did looping well. But most of my looping clients use the boss foot pedals. If I could get them to hit my foot pedal and record that way I could get the whole session in Ardour as a multi track making a much cleaner post process.
2016-09-22 17:46:09	frinknet	I love live looping as an art. But recording it is not so graceful and looses a lot of the energy of the performance currently.
2016-09-22 17:47:54	frinknet	I wonder if using the loop punching might work for this sort of thing...
2016-09-22 17:49:34	frinknet	If there was an automatic setup of the loop punching I might be able to use ardour to record the looping...

2016-09-22 23:38:28	timbyr	yottanami, It looks like the default bindings for Move selected tracks up/down is preventing midi velocity editing using Ctrl(primary modifier)+up/down keys. If you go to bindings editor and remove the shortcuts for Move selected tracks up/down you should be able to edit midi note velocities using Ctrl+Up/Down keys

2016-09-23 07:16:30	yhhko	i'm trying to record on an HDA before I buy a USB audio interface. however, whereas audacity records my laptop's builtin mic just fine (well...), ardour somehow distorts the audio: it stutters and the frequency seems off (doubled?). i told ardour to use alsa instead of jack

2016-09-23 07:17:34	las	yhhko: does it work if you use JACK?
2016-09-23 07:17:36	yhhko	no i understand, but i wanted to make the point that my microphone is working fine
2016-09-23 07:17:40	yhhko	no, same issue with jack

2016-09-23 07:18:13	yhhko	and in jack i am getting XRUN callback thingies, so that's probably no good

2016-09-23 07:38:51	yhhko	okay that explains that at least! :)
2016-09-23 07:39:19	las	yhhko: i suspect that without an RT kernel, your system may need JACK or ardour's ALSA backend to use way more buffering than you do now
2016-09-23 07:39:34	las	yhhko: note also that the h/w almost certainly only runs at 48kHz
2016-09-23 07:39:43	yhhko	yeah it forces 48khz
2016-09-23 07:40:12	yhhko	okay, so probably the best next step is to install an RT kernel, see if that improves the situation on this HDA card?
2016-09-23 07:40:28	las	yhhko: if that is easy to do
2016-09-23 07:40:40	las	yhhko: the simplest step is just to try JACK with lots of buffering
2016-09-23 07:41:22	rgareus	JL__: xjadeo does not use gtk.  on OSX it's a quartz/openGL application.
2016-09-23 07:41:41	JL__	rgareus: ok thanks
2016-09-23 07:42:13	yhhko	it's not accepting a period size of 32768 on capture; can I do it asymetrically? or perhaps try capture-only I guess
2016-09-23 07:42:45	las	yhhko: sure, though that won't help when you want duplex
2016-09-23 07:43:01	yhhko	hmm

2016-09-23 07:53:44	frinknet	las: thanks for the discussion on looping. I realized right after you got off that all I need to do is find a way to start looping as soon as I am finished recording. I think I can use Lua for this...
2016-09-23 07:54:23	las	frinknet: that would be cool
2016-09-23 07:56:25	yhhko	hm well this is interesting. i put jack in capture-only and used ardour to capture at the same 2048 frames per period that audacity managed to make it work. however, the .wav file that ardour wrote has been sped up - it's as if you play back a 24kHz recording at 48kHz
2016-09-23 07:56:45	las	yhhko: use sndfile-info to check the recorded file
2016-09-23 07:56:45	yhhko	(i slowed it back down and it sounds fine)
2016-09-23 07:57:09	yhhko	las: says sample rate 48000
2016-09-23 07:58:01	las	yhhko: how are you listening to it?
2016-09-23 07:58:38	yhhko	ardour couldn't play it so i tried aplay which played it at 48kHz, then openened it (sorry for cursing so much here) audacity and slowed it down by a factor 2
2016-09-23 08:00:05	las	yhhko: can i see the output from sndfile-info? I think this is an audacity bug ...
2016-09-23 08:00:18	yhhko	aplay did the same thing

2016-09-23 08:02:15	yhhko	and again, when the sound was going through jack i had the impression it was also sped up. with lots of xrun callbacks. so maybe there's just a sample rate set wrong somewhere?
2016-09-23 08:02:24	yhhko	going through aka duplex
2016-09-23 08:03:39	las	yhhko: i am almost certain that it is an audacity bug, it cannot handle ardour's float-format WAV files correctly
2016-09-23 08:04:16	las	yhhko: change ardour to use 24 bit format (Session > Properties > Media or something) and i think you will likely see that go away
2016-09-23 08:08:34	yhhko	las: didn't help. and again, aplay recognises it as float 32 bit and does the same thing.
2016-09-23 08:08:34		[08:08]
2016-09-23 08:12:32	las	yhhko: what does sndfile-info say? ardour can and certainly change the format it uses when told to do so, but ONLY for data recorded AFTER the change
2016-09-23 08:12:48	las	yhhko: it will not rewrite existing data on disk
2016-09-23 08:14:11	yhhko	las: i re-recorded, here's the new sndfile-info http://pastebin.com/0TPEViUr
2016-09-23 08:16:13	las	yhhko: that's a 24 bit integer data format
2016-09-23 08:17:07	yhhko	yes, that's what you wanted right?
2016-09-23 08:19:29	las	yhhko: yes. if that plays incorrectly, then i have no idea what is going on with your system
2016-09-23 08:19:37	yhhko	haha

2016-09-23 09:05:04	MaurizioB	Hi there, I ran into an issue with jackclient-python library, that happens when using port callbacks: since the port callback function should return a port object, sometimes the pointer to a destroyed port points to nothing (since the object doesn't exist anymore)
2016-09-23 09:05:58	MaurizioB	Anyway, the developer is a bit confused by the jack documentation about this, as he says here: 
2016-09-23 09:06:00	MaurizioB	https://github.com/spatialaudio/jackclient-python/issues/35#issuecomment-244722711
2016-09-23 09:07:00	las	MaurizioB: jack_port_t* is valid until the return of jack_port_unregister() on the same port
2016-09-23 09:07:03	MaurizioB	maybe somebody here can help us better understand how this work
2016-09-23 09:07:42	las	MaurizioB: err, not the return; upon entering jack_port_unregister()
2016-09-23 09:07:50	MaurizioB	las: so, once the client who owns that port has jack_port_unregister() returned, the pointer is not valid anymore?
2016-09-23 09:07:52	MaurizioB	ah
2016-09-23 09:10:13	MaurizioB	las: so, the client "listening" to client/port events might or might not get a pointer at all, if it has not been called before

2016-09-24 00:33:55	yottanami	[20:51:33] las, I was a windows user and there was many VSTs and high quality sounds. My big problem about Ardour is sounds limitations currently I am using sound fonts but it can not be as good as windows VSTs [20:51:33]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	las	[20:56:08] yottanami: then use windows ? [20:56:08]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	las	[20:56:22] yottanami: ardour runs there just like it does on linux [20:56:22]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	yottanami	[20:57:22] las, I really love Linux and prefer it. Is there any way to run VSTs and VSTis in Linux? [20:57:22]

2016-09-24 00:33:55	yottanami	[21:25:56] las, There is a Channel option in export window with the default value is 2, [21:25:56]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	yottanami	[21:26:15] What should it be for exporting each channel in different line? [21:26:15]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	las	[21:26:44] yottanami: 1 channel per track, or 1 file per track? [21:26:44]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	yottanami	[21:28:10] las, I need one file contains all lines seperated ( I am not sure about what is the meaning of track and channel ) [21:28:10]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	yottanami	[21:30:37] So I need one channel per track I think [21:30:37]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	las	[21:31:36] yottanami: you need a new export format with the correct number of channels, then. [21:31:36]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	las	[21:31:41] yottanami: only you know that value [21:31:41]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	las	[21:31:52] yottanami: you should be aware that this is an usual way of exporting  material [21:31:52]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	las	[21:32:00] yottanami: most people want stem exports (1 file per track) [21:32:00]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	yottanami	[21:34:09] las, I tried the stem export but the problem is I can not see MIDI tracks there [21:34:09]

2016-09-24 00:33:55	las	[21:56:39] wargreen: also, gdb backtraces show all threads; that sort of thing shows just one [21:56:39]

2016-09-25 02:38:02	qwebirc319214	Good afternoon everyone!
2016-09-25 02:38:17	qwebirc319214	i have a question about audio in Ardour
2016-09-25 02:38:31	qwebirc319214	when I start jack server it says that the system has a total latency of 10.7 msec, but when I open Ardour it says that the latency is about 5.3 msec, and also in MIDI configuration in Ardour it says that the latency is about 23.2 msec... how i can understand which is the real latency? Is it the sum of Ardour latency plus the Jack latency?
2016-09-25 02:38:31		[02:38]
2016-09-25 02:39:51	rgareus	qwebirc319214: I the first 2 are easily explained.  round-trip (input + output)  vs  buffer-size (1 cycle).  5.3333 * 2 ~= 10.7777 
2016-09-25 02:40:24	rgareus	qwebirc319214: midi is separate  for all audio-interface  (except firewire ones). 
2016-09-25 02:41:23	rgareus	qwebirc319214:  as for the /real/ latency:  you have to measure it.   either commandline (jack_iodelat)  or ardour's build-in GUI for that.
2016-09-25 02:41:27	qwebirc319214	my audio interface has the midi I/O on it... (behringer U-phoria umc404hd)
2016-09-25 02:42:09	rgareus	qwebirc319214:   http://manual.ardour.org/synchronization/latency-and-latency-compensation/  has an overview 
2016-09-25 02:42:39	rgareus	Fig1.  should make it clear:   what ardour displays is  only the middle-part  (JACK process latency).
2016-09-25 02:43:08	rgareus	all the stuff around it...  (BUS, OS, ...) is "unknown" (systemic latency)  and one usually has to measure it.

2016-09-25 02:45:52	rgareus	qwebirc319214: USB devices keep audio and MIDI as separate data-streams
2016-09-25 02:47:27	rgareus	Only the firewire audio spec mandates synchronous transfers for audio+midi.   some high-end PCI devices also feature isosynchronous audio+MIDI..   but most don't..
2016-09-25 02:47:39	rgareus	anyway.. ardour can compensate for the difference.

2016-09-25 06:50:04	las	daw_enthusiast: what's the issue
2016-09-25 06:52:03	daw_enthusiast	No issue actually. Want to develop furhter on midi. So wanted to know which files are actually responsible for creating those rectanges when we record through midi. I want to get the midi data during runtime and process it.
2016-09-25 06:52:47	las	daw_enthusiast: in general we don't tend to provide developer guidance
2016-09-25 06:53:11	las	daw_enthusiast: the GUI is an extremely complex piece of code, and we can't point you to simple blobs and say "here's where this happens"

2016-09-25 06:53:42	las	daw_enthusiast: if you want to start hacking on ardour, you will need to come to grips with the codebase as-is, as about 80 other people have ...
2016-09-25 06:54:35	las	daw_enthusiast: writing down the explanation of how something as complex as that works isn't very time efficient, unfortunately
2016-09-25 06:55:05	daw_enthusiast	hmm.. yeah you are right. It is indeed complex. Anyway will try to find a way. Thanks.

2016-09-25 06:58:38	daw_enthusiast	yeah correct!
2016-09-25 06:59:36	daw_enthusiast	i wanted to identify patterns in midi data for instance, the chords.
2016-09-25 07:00:23	las	daw_enthusiast: that's a distinctly non-trivial undertaking
2016-09-25 07:00:35	las	daw_enthusiast: certainly doing it during recording
2016-09-25 07:01:00	las	daw_enthusiast: what would you then plan to do with the data ?
2016-09-25 07:02:34	daw_enthusiast	it can be used to provide feedback to the user
2016-09-25 07:02:35	las	daw_enthusiast: yeah, you're definitely taking on a pretty substantive task there, involving almost every level of ardour's design
2016-09-25 07:02:59	daw_enthusiast	yeah i know. But i want to do it anyway.

2016-09-25 07:09:53	daw_enthusiast	was digging into midi_tracer.cc
2016-09-25 07:10:18	daw_enthusiast	which is same as i think midi monitor that rgareus pointed out
2016-09-25 07:10:30	rgareus	daw_enthusiast:  a-MIDI Monitor is a lua script   https://github.com/Ardour/ardour/blob/master/scripts/midimon.lua
2016-09-25 07:10:54	rgareus	the midi tracer is global and asynchroneous. 
2016-09-25 07:11:04	daw_enthusiast	oh okay
2016-09-25 07:11:06	rgareus	it's mainly for debugging .
2016-09-25 07:11:24	rgareus	"a-MIDI Monitor" is multi-instance (it's a plugin really)  and can be added anywhere in the signal flow
2016-09-25 07:12:20	rgareus	instead of lua, you could also write a LV2 or VST plugin in C/C++.  The overhead of doing so will be larger, but it'd also work in other DAWs.

2016-09-25 07:14:38	rgareus	e.g  analyze chord .. generate bassline  or similar

2016-09-25 07:19:03	daw_enthusiast	that was a good one !
2016-09-25 07:21:33	rgareus	the long mid/long term change that las allded to  are unifying track types and adding sub-tracks.  e.g.  audio-track + midi-meta-data (analyze audio)
2016-09-25 07:21:51	rgareus	or e.g.  midi-track + meta-data midi: scale/key.
2016-09-25 07:22:26	daw_enthusiast	ok
2016-09-25 07:22:58	rgareus	changing the backend is not that hard, but the GUI rework will be a significant amount of work
2016-09-25 07:23:24	daw_enthusiast	GUI is toooo complex

2016-09-25 07:23:28	daw_enthusiast	:(
2016-09-25 07:23:39	rgareus	yeah. about 80% of all ardour is gui code.
2016-09-25 07:23:53	rgareus	and it's also the most complex part.
2016-09-25 07:24:29	daw_enthusiast	i always had the notion that gui and the main code are kept seperate for ease of understanding
2016-09-25 07:24:47	daw_enthusiast	and improvement
2016-09-25 07:25:03	rgareus	daw_enthusiast: it is (mostly)   libs/ardour is "the backend"

2016-09-25 10:06:38	scherbi_	I've run it with ardbg...still need the backtrace?
2016-09-25 10:07:27	rgareus	or except it is..  SndFileSource::init_sndfile () does zero it.
2016-09-25 10:08:30	rgareus	scherbi_: if you have a backtrace it may help. I'd like to know which constructor is used

2016-09-25 10:14:04	rgareus	you can use the current gdb session

2016-09-25 15:33:33	bksubhuti	hello
2016-09-25 15:33:39	Stuzz	hi
2016-09-25 15:34:29	bksubhuti	I started off using audacity with multitrack recording of my chanting (voices) and I want to try ardour.  I can add tracks but qjack does not connect
2016-09-25 15:34:40	bksubhuti	I do not have any equipment.. just my laptop mic
2016-09-25 15:35:30	bksubhuti	I want to get some professional reverb and effects with ardour.. and I guess I need plugins and I guess I need to use qjackctrl which all of the above are installed
2016-09-25 15:35:55	bksubhuti	So what do I do to get effects?
2016-09-25 15:37:57	bksubhuti	uh.. actually it started.. 
2016-09-25 15:37:57		[15:37]
2016-09-25 15:37:57	bksubhuti	I wanted to upload the errors but now it works..
2016-09-25 15:37:58	bksubhuti	ok.. so how do I get the plugins to work.  I need to do something with sessions
2016-09-25 15:38:35	rgareus	bksubhuti: assuming you're on GNU/Linux  search your distro-archive for LADSPA and LV2  (plugin formats)
2016-09-25 15:39:12	rgareus	bksubhuti: http://manual.ardour.org/working-with-plugins/getting-plugins/  has a list 
2016-09-25 15:39:44	rgareus	as for adding plugins,  open the mixer-window    and double click in the Processor box (the blank space near the top of every track)
2016-09-25 15:39:52	bksubhuti	I read that part.  
2016-09-25 15:40:00	rgareus	if you use Ardour 5.  Ardour includes a reverb plugin
2016-09-25 15:41:00	rgareus	if not, well, there are a couple of LADSPA and LV2 (LADSPA version 2) plugins out there.
2016-09-25 15:41:22	bksubhuti	that is why I was playing with jack
2016-09-25 15:41:41	rgareus	with jack, you could also insert some jack reverb.  like zita-rev1
2016-09-25 15:41:43	bksubhuti	ardour 5.. I downloaded from the repo and I am using 4 I guess
2016-09-25 15:41:54	bksubhuti	I am gnome 16.04
2016-09-25 15:42:07	rgareus	 Ardour > Menu > Help > About    will tell
2016-09-25 15:43:02	bksubhuti	4.6
2016-09-25 15:43:30	bksubhuti	I had to close jack to open a project.. other wise it would fail to connect to audio
2016-09-25 15:44:08	bksubhuti	and now if I start qjackctrl it fails if ardour is running.
2016-09-25 15:44:40	bksubhuti	open source can do wonderful things.. but they ain't easy
2016-09-25 15:44:54	rgareus	smells like gnome 16.04 is based on Ubuntu..   and you're experiencing some of the jack packaging oddities of that distro.
2016-09-25 15:45:35	bksubhuti	Oh.. that does not sound fun.  I read something about pulse audio problems shall I kill it?
2016-09-25 15:46:14	bksubhuti	linux is supposed to be the king for ardour
2016-09-25 15:46:21	rgareus	bksubhuti: easiest to get started is to stick with Ardour's ALSA backend  (and don't use jack)
2016-09-25 15:46:34	rgareus	bksubhuti: linux is not Ubuntu.
2016-09-25 15:46:34	bksubhuti	I have dual boot.  am I better with win
2016-09-25 15:47:01	bksubhuti	I have real geeks on the line.. I used to be a programmer once though before a monk 
2016-09-25 15:47:07	bksubhuti	what distro u use
2016-09-25 15:47:12	bksubhuti	?
2016-09-25 15:47:25	rgareus	the sad part is that Ubuntu regularly screws up pro-audio software packaging..

2016-09-25 15:47:48	bksubhuti	ok. how do I use plugins without jack
2016-09-25 15:47:52	bksubhuti	?
2016-09-25 15:47:59	rgareus	bksubhuti: ardour loads the plugins
2016-09-25 15:48:17	rgareus	jack has nothing to do with plugins.    with jack you can use  3rd party *applications* 
2016-09-25 15:48:31	rgareus	if you know rewire -- that's similar to jack.
2016-09-25 15:48:48	bksubhuti	It says you need to do the session thing
2016-09-25 15:48:49	bksubhuti	jack has that
2016-09-25 15:48:49	bksubhuti	I could not find that in ardour
2016-09-25 15:49:28	bksubhuti	ok.  i have a two test tracks.  how to add reverb.  I installed a few plugin packages from the repo
2016-09-25 15:50:11	bksubhuti	calf is one of them.  
2016-09-25 15:50:33	rgareus	bksubhuti:  Menu > Window > Mixer.     double click on the master bus.    > Plugin manager shows up -> select a reverb.
2016-09-25 15:50:38	bksubhuti	The others I have no idea where they are.  audacity has an effects menu.. not so difficult
2016-09-25 15:50:50	bksubhuti	ok will try now
2016-09-25 15:50:56	rgareus	^^   master bus's  processor box.
2016-09-25 15:52:04	rgareus	bksubhuti: if you like tutorial videos:  http://libremusicproduction.com/tutorials/basic-mixing-ardour-3  (also applies to Ardour 4,5) 
2016-09-25 15:52:05	LAbot	Title: Basic mixing in Ardour 3 | Libre Music Production (at libremusicproduction.com)
2016-09-25 15:52:42	bksubhuti	ok.  I watched only one.  I see mixer.. but I am not sure what thing to double click on
2016-09-25 15:53:17	rgareus	bksubhuti: you'll see something like  http://brunoruviaro.github.io/ardour4-tutorial/images/Ardour4_Mixer_Window_2.png
2016-09-25 15:53:17		[15:53]
2016-09-25 15:53:31	rgareus	bksubhuti: the blank black space below the blue "fader"
2016-09-25 15:54:05	rgareus	it's called the "processor box" --  you can add plugins or any signal processors there.
2016-09-25 15:54:17	rgareus	and re-order them as needed
2016-09-25 15:54:53	bksubhuti	ok that is intuitive.. (!).  got it. and loads of plugins too.  thanks. you rock (no pun intended for music).
2016-09-25 15:54:59	rgareus	ardour is a DAW  -- conceptually very different from audacity which is soundfile editor
2016-09-25 15:55:50	bksubhuti	yes.. interesting.  I wonder what I can do with this inbetween studying for my exams.

2016-09-25 15:56:49	bksubhuti	ok thanks..  Perhaps I will be back here soon...  I will try to watch the mixer vid.

2016-09-25 15:58:00	rgareus	'night
2016-09-25 15:58:47	bksubhuti	yes.  I have that pdf downloaded.  I will probably start there.  Seems like ardour is a bit like blender.. really amazing things can be done, but difficult to master.

2016-09-25 22:55:44	the_CLA	BTW I didn't test the fixes myself - just saw somebody else confirming that it's working now. So not sure if all issues with MIDI looping are solved now. Maybe I should give it a try as well. :)
2016-09-25 22:59:10	alexidoia	when quantizing, should a window open ? I do it but nothing happens and my notes are still at the original recording palce

2016-09-25 22:59:13	alexidoia	place
2016-09-25 23:00:26	alexidoia	ah and another thing I was meant to ask you for ages, the No Grid/Grid popup menu seems inverted, I mean the grid works on "no grid" setting and vice et versa
2016-09-25 23:03:31	the_CLA	alexidoia: Grid setting works fine here - so might be fixed as well.
2016-09-25 23:05:36	the_CLA	alexidoia: Quantize window pops up here. I guess it doesn't make much sense reporting if you can't confirm with a recent version.
2016-09-25 23:08:20	the_CLA	Then OTOH the currently released version of Ardour 5 has some serious regressions regarding MIDI. So I wouldn't suggest updating to a version prior to the upcoming 5.4 or recent git for MIDI work.
2016-09-25 23:09:53	alexidoia	the CLA quantizing window appears fine here too, my mistake, I selected the notes and not the range, although maybe it could be grayed out

2016-09-26 10:58:43	vok`	My God, Ardour is excellent.
2016-09-26 10:58:53	rgareus	particularly for cases starting at 00:00:00:00    click 2 * 4 times and then start rolling.
2016-09-26 10:58:56	vok`	rgareus: I'm a former guitarist and I just found out about guitarix.
2016-09-26 10:59:05	vok`	Right, that's what I want.
2016-09-26 10:59:25	rgareus	a work-around is to simply start at  01:00:00:00  (or similar)
2016-09-26 10:59:35	vok`	rgareus: I didn't think Linux had the facilities for guitarists. Boy was I wrong.
2016-09-26 10:59:38	vok`	Right.
2016-09-26 10:59:51	rgareus	vok`: the next step is  http://moddevices.com/  (which runs all guitarix LV2s) :)
2016-09-26 10:59:52	LAbot	Title: MOD Devices (at moddevices.com)
2016-09-26 11:00:11	vok`	rgareus: Suffice it to say I'm trying to get a guitar next month. :)
2016-09-26 11:00:35	vok`	Oh wow, that's pretty cool.
2016-09-26 11:00:39	vok`	I
2016-09-26 11:00:41	rgareus	what happend to the guitars you had?
2016-09-26 11:00:59	vok`	I'm surprised that there's no guitarix Raspberry Pi project.
2016-09-26 11:01:10	vok`	rgareus: It stopped working and I threw it out.
2016-09-26 11:01:13	rgareus	RPi is probably not powerful enough
2016-09-26 11:01:29	vok`	My new computer has no audio jack so I have to get an audio interface, too.
2016-09-26 11:01:34	vok`	Ah I see.
2016-09-26 11:01:38	rgareus	particularly for low-latency (live).  RPi will be tricky
2016-09-26 11:02:30	rgareus	not impossible:  http://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/raspberrypi    but not exactly easy to tweak things
2016-09-26 11:02:30	vok`	I see.
2016-09-26 11:02:55	vok`	rgareus: Do you know if a Behringer U-Phoria UM2 will work with Linux/Ardour? Or the Focusrite stuff?
2016-09-26 11:02:57	rgareus	and still limited DSP wise. you may get a few FX going.
2016-09-26 11:03:19	rgareus	vok`: for USB devices:  http://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/hardware_support 
2016-09-26 11:03:35	rgareus	and generally  http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Matrix:Main

2016-09-26 11:04:32	rgareus	vok`: in short: if the soundcard is "Class Compliant"  -- it needs no driver for OSX/iOS  and it'll also work on Linux.
2016-09-26 11:05:01	vok`	rgareus: What kinds of music do you make with Ardour?
2016-09-26 11:05:04	rgareus	thanks to Apple (which mandates "driver less" spec-compliance) a lot of recent soundcards also just-work on Linux
2016-09-26 11:05:13	vok`	Ah great!
2016-09-26 11:05:23	rgareus	vok`: not much anymore.  I mostly develop
2016-09-26 11:06:20	 *	rgareus didn't have a band since graduating Univ > 10 yeas ago.
2016-09-26 11:06:20		[11:06]
2016-09-26 11:06:31	rgareus	and I used ardour maninly for soundtracks and sound-design since.
2016-09-26 11:07:08	vok`	Ah cool.
2016-09-26 11:07:19	vok`	I started with electronic now I've moved back to rock stuff.
2016-09-26 11:07:34	vok`	I'm amazed at the range of different types of music Ardour is capable of doing.
2016-09-26 11:07:49	 *	rgareus is is into funk/jazz/blues mostly
2016-09-26 11:07:52	vok`	On the electronic side it's a bit wanting, but really with workarounds it's definitely nice.
2016-09-26 11:07:58	vok`	Cool!
2016-09-26 11:08:03	vok`	I started with blues.
2016-09-26 11:08:10	vok`	In the early 00s.
2016-09-26 11:08:43	rgareus	for "electronic" I prefer  csounds or supercollider music.
2016-09-26 11:08:50	vok`	Ah cool.

2016-09-26 12:07:23	rgareus	zequence: they're mostly there for convenience and portability
2016-09-26 12:07:40	rgareus	based on zam-plugins  (which you probably already have)
2016-09-26 12:08:04	gimp	im having problems with ardour and jack
2016-09-26 12:08:36	rgareus	zequence:  the catch is: they're cross-platform and always there.  so copy session e.g. to <some> windows-PC ..  and the session keeps working
2016-09-26 12:08:37	gimp	ardour could not reconnect to audio/midi engine
2016-09-26 12:08:38	rgareus	gimp: can you be more specific?
2016-09-26 12:08:48	zequence	rgareus: Haven't yet tried them, actually. I've actually only been using the calf plugins so far.
2016-09-26 12:09:21	rgareus	gimp: assuming Linux:  can you run ardour from a terminal and check if there are more messages?
2016-09-26 12:09:55	gimp	what is the command for running ardour, kinda new to linux
2016-09-26 12:10:08	rgareus	zequence: you're going to be disappointed by the GUI, but may love the sound :)
2016-09-26 12:10:24	zequence	Think the calf plugins are pretty ok, but I don't have the experience in using the "good stuff".
2016-09-26 12:10:40	zequence	rgareus: Sounds good.
2016-09-26 12:10:44	rgareus	gimp: usually just       Ardour5      (binaries from ardour.org)   or     ardour5    (distro builds)
2016-09-26 12:11:04	rgareus	assuming you have recent Ardour 5.X 
2016-09-26 12:11:31	rgareus	gimp: I hazard a guess it's lack of realtime permissions for jack.
2016-09-26 12:12:17	gimp	I have ardour4 I think and using the terminal command brought me to the setup window which is where the problem started in the first place
2016-09-26 12:12:54	gimp	how can I fix the realtime permissions?

2016-09-26 12:54:25	rgareus	...before touching qjackctl...

2016-09-26 12:55:33	rgareus	or how would one reset qjackctl?
2016-09-26 12:55:33	gimp	I restarted my laptop and then tried opening qjackctl and got the same error, then, I cant remember exactly where I saw it, but there was a "reset" button for qjackctl, so I clicked it and that worked
2016-09-26 12:55:54	zequence	rgareus: Ubuntu Studio makes sure there is realtime privilege, and linux-lowlatency (and swapiness 10), but other than that, it's plain old Debian

2016-09-26 13:01:18	rgareus	yeah
2016-09-26 13:01:42	rgareus	generating a new "Preset" in settings would work...
2016-09-26 13:01:50	rgareus	and deleting the current one.
2016-09-26 13:01:57	rgareus	but whetaver. 
2016-09-26 13:04:10	zequence	I actually left Ubuntu Studio
2016-09-26 13:05:49	zequence	Going to do a Debian Studio kind of thing. A sort of Debian Multimedia Flavor. Sort of like Ubuntu Studio, where you get everything preinstalled and set up, but you can choose between the fully free, and the less fully free
2016-09-26 13:06:47	rgareus	that sounds cool!
2016-09-26 13:06:47		[13:06]
2016-09-26 13:07:41	rgareus	AFAICT the main issue with Ubuntu is, that Ub  was unlucky a couple of times picking debian/unstable at the /wrong/ time for pro-audio.
2016-09-26 13:08:47	zequence	That, and no one was there to fix it
2016-09-26 13:10:05	rgareus	debian/testing would make a lot more sense in that case

2016-09-26 13:11:41	Stuzz	zequence: Maybe Glen could use some help with that?
2016-09-26 13:11:44	rgareus	well, it's a mix
2016-09-26 13:11:53	rgareus	also some KXStudio packages..
2016-09-26 13:12:06	zequence	Stuzz: Who's Glenn?
2016-09-26 13:12:21	rgareus	the person behind AVLinux
2016-09-26 13:12:24	zequence	I'm thinking of a pure Debian variant
2016-09-26 13:12:26	Stuzz	I thought the context might give it away :p
2016-09-26 13:12:37	Stuzz	mmK
2016-09-26 13:13:19	zequence	Sort of like Ubuntu studio is for Ubuntu.
2016-09-26 13:13:35	Stuzz	Is it though?
2016-09-26 13:13:45	zequence	Which is?
2016-09-26 13:14:51	Stuzz	I dunno..  Is there anyone out there waiting for another distro before they get into doing audio on linux?
2016-09-26 13:15:02	rgareus	Stuzz: so mainly a preseed file?
2016-09-26 13:15:18	Stuzz	Or, is there anyone currently doing it and looking for another variant of an existing distro to switch to
2016-09-26 13:15:26	rgareus	zequence: ^^ 
2016-09-26 13:15:49	zequence	I think Ubuntu Studio is probably the first one for a lot of folks.
2016-09-26 13:16:17	zequence	A Debian studio would offer the same thing, but with the fully free option
2016-09-26 13:17:03	Stuzz	OK
2016-09-26 13:17:07	rgareus	pure-dyne is also in the business of a "only DFSG free" multimedia distro
2016-09-26 13:17:32	zequence	puredyne was my first distro
2016-09-26 13:17:39	rgareus	or https://www.dyne.org/software/dynebolic/
2016-09-26 13:17:42	LAbot	Title: Dyne:bolic :: 100% free software operating system (at www.dyne.org)
2016-09-26 13:18:03	 *	rgareus hasn't seen Jaromil in a while though
2016-09-26 13:18:34	zequence	rgareus: 2011
2016-09-26 13:18:36	rgareus	most musicians that I know however care less about 100% free.
2016-09-26 13:19:30	zequence	I'm not aiming for a distro that appeals to the greater mass. Just one that is fully Debian
2016-09-26 13:19:33	Stuzz	It just seems sometimes that resources are spread so thin over so many distros...  I figure it'd be of more benefit to pool some resources behind existings products
2016-09-26 13:20:00	rgareus	Stuzz: Linux Audio in general is very fragmented
2016-09-26 13:20:22	Stuzz	Yeah.  I'm not really talking specifically about anything, just in general
2016-09-26 13:20:40	rgareus	I suppose there are more half baked Linux Audio  DAWs than commercial DAW :)
2016-09-26 13:20:57	zequence	Bugs should be reported easily, and logged easily by developers
2016-09-26 13:20:57	Stuzz	I suppose Ubuntu has the most resources and is more or less THE name in linux
2016-09-26 13:21:12	rgareus	Android is actually
2016-09-26 13:21:27	Stuzz	linux desktop
2016-09-26 13:21:31	rgareus	right
2016-09-26 13:22:13	Stuzz	I suppose Ubuntu Studio just rides on the name, but I've had the impression it doesn't have enough resources to sustain itself
2016-09-26 13:22:13		[13:22]
2016-09-26 13:22:29	Stuzz	Or maybe it does..  I dunno
2016-09-26 13:23:01	Stuzz	Not like I've got my finger on the pulse
2016-09-26 13:23:29	Stuzz	The only 'good' audio distro I hear mentioned or recommended is AV
2016-09-26 13:24:13	Stuzz	And to my knowledge that's 1 guy
2016-09-26 13:24:18	rgareus	both AVLinux and KXStudio go a lot further (preconfigure system,  auto-start  jackd, alsa/pulseaudio bridge  etc etc)
2016-09-26 13:24:41	rgareus	and at least in AVLinux case Glenn does a few productions with the system before release.  testing software + plugins..
2016-09-26 13:25:55	zequence	Ubuntu Studio is a flavor of Ubuntu, so it doesn't actually need much
2016-09-26 13:25:56	Stuzz	Meanwhile, why do all the Studio distros include stuff for all sorts of creation?  Is there an audio only centric distro?
2016-09-26 13:26:01	rgareus	and in KXStudio's case bugs were fixed within a few hours after the report.. 
2016-09-26 13:26:52	zequence	Ubuntu Studio is for all multimedia. Not just audio.
2016-09-26 13:27:00	Stuzz	As I said
2016-09-26 13:27:19	zequence	You said all Studio distros
2016-09-26 13:27:20	vonquack	you could get ubuntu/mint and install just the ubuntustudio-audio package
2016-09-26 13:27:27	zequence	What other ones are there?
2016-09-26 13:27:35	Stuzz	AVLinux
2016-09-26 13:27:48	zequence	ubuntustudio-audio won't work in Mint though
2016-09-26 13:27:51	Stuzz	Is there an audio only centric distro?
2016-09-26 13:28:06	vonquack	why not, zequence ? worked last i tried
2016-09-26 13:28:08	zequence	Mint doesn't install "recommends"
2016-09-26 13:28:15	rgareus	Stuzz: I don't know any
2016-09-26 13:28:37	Stuzz	huh
2016-09-26 13:28:55	zequence	vonquack: Practically all the packages in ubuntustudio-audio are marked as "recommends"
2016-09-26 13:29:33	rgareus	Stuzz: there were a few audio-centric ones in the past (e.g. jacklab, or musix)
2016-09-26 13:29:43	rgareus	and studio2go
2016-09-26 13:29:51	zequence	The one I will be doing will be audio only
2016-09-26 13:30:14	zequence	Been experimenting with revamping Debian Live
2016-09-26 13:30:27	zequence	Seems like a good place to start ( in this case )
2016-09-26 13:30:31	rgareus	+1
2016-09-26 13:30:54	rgareus	well, no need to /revamp/  - preseed mostly

2016-09-26 13:31:29	Stuzz	Obviously anyone can add anything to anything, but a distro all set and ready to go OOtB for one to just hit the [REC] button would be somethin'
2016-09-26 13:31:33	zequence	plus a few configs, if needed
2016-09-26 13:31:36	rgareus	zequence: new packages?

2016-09-26 13:55:38	zequence	All of it is actual instruments. Slingerland drum set from late 70s or early 80s, though the snare is kind of new (Tama Brass, about 10 years)
2016-09-26 13:57:03	zequence	The guitar sound is what it is. A Peavy Supreme, from the 90s. The guitar is a 7-string Schecter Damien, with the original EMGs.
2016-09-26 13:57:14	zequence	Cobalt strings, however.
2016-09-26 13:59:02	zequence	Working more on the music right now. Mixing will come next year or so, and then I will do it better, but for now, this seems to at least show some of the potential.
2016-09-26 13:59:02		[13:59]
2016-09-26 14:00:39	zequence	I do all of the instruments, and the vocals. 
2016-09-26 14:01:25	zequence	Just a preview. The final thing will be a lot more awesome, I hope. And, with a free license.
2016-09-26 14:03:20	zequence	So far, all done in Ardour with Calf plugins. I will try other plugins in the future, for sure.

2016-09-26 14:42:03	zequence	Stuzz: Don't think there is. And, I'm sure there would be a debate on which is the musically most great and which has both the music and the sound.
2016-09-26 14:42:56	zequence	I for one like the early 90s. Sound-wise, that is not a great period.
2016-09-26 14:43:43	zequence	Music-wise, I would say that is the golden age of Death Metal, and after that it just didn't much evolve.
2016-09-26 14:45:11	zequence	The musicians got better. But, not necessarily the music.
2016-09-26 14:46:13	Stuzz	I don't even know what death metal is these days.  Everyone wants to come up with their own sub-genre every other day
2016-09-26 14:46:53	Stuzz	I just put it all in a catchall bucket labelled 'metal' and call it a day.

2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[23:30:13] Been experimenting with revamping Debian Live [23:30:13]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[23:30:26] Seems like a good place to start ( in this case ) [23:30:26]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	rgareus	[23:30:30] +1 [23:30:30]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	rgareus	[23:30:54] well, no need to /revamp/  - preseed mostly [23:30:54]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[23:31:20] rgareus: I will be adding a -lowlatency kernel, and perhaps also a -rt kernel [23:31:20]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Stuzz	[23:31:28] Obviously anyone can add anything to anything, but a distro all set and ready to go OOtB for one to just hit the [REC] button would be somethin' [23:31:28]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[23:31:32] plus a few configs, if needed [23:31:32]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	rgareus	[23:31:35] zequence: new packages? [23:31:35]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[23:31:51] rgareus: I'll try to get them in Debian eventually [23:31:51]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Stuzz	[23:32:16] I guess I just want Ardour Linux :) [23:32:16]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[23:32:53] A distro is just a combination of things [23:32:53]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	rgareus	[23:33:12] zequence: why not https://packages.debian.org/sid/linux-image-4.6.0-1-rt-amd64 ? [23:33:12]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	LAbot	[23:33:13] Title: Debian -- Details of package linux-image-4.6.0-1-rt-amd64 in sid (at packages.debian.org) [23:33:13]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	rgareus	[23:34:32] boot into Ardour [23:34:32]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[23:34:59] rgareus: Yes, there is that! :). [23:34:59]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Stuzz	[23:36:12] Boot into Ardour..  now you're talkin' [23:36:12]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	rgareus	[23:36:28] :) [23:36:28]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[23:51:28] Peter Gabriel seems to sound good in any room/speakers [23:51:28]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[23:52:09] We just move from 10 square meters to above 20. [23:52:09]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[23:52:14] moved* [23:52:14]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[23:53:38] This what the 10 square meters sounded like https://cloud.mousike.me/index.php/s/Y3slnd6JuZ9jA78 [23:53:38]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	LAbot	[23:53:40] Title: ownCloud (at cloud.mousike.me) [23:53:40]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[23:55:37] All of it is actual instruments. Slingerland drum set from late 70s or early 80s, though the snare is kind of new (Tama Brass, about 10 years) [23:55:37]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[23:57:02] The guitar sound is what it is. A Peavy Supreme, from the 90s. The guitar is a 7-string Schecter Damien, with the original EMGs. [23:57:02]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[23:57:13] Cobalt strings, however. [23:57:13]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[23:59:01] Working more on the music right now. Mixing will come next year or so, and then I will do it better, but for now, this seems to at least show some of the potential. [23:59:01]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[00:00:38] I do all of the instruments, and the vocals.  [00:00:38]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[00:01:24] Just a preview. The final thing will be a lot more awesome, I hope. And, with a free license. [00:01:24]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[00:03:19] So far, all done in Ardour with Calf plugins. I will try other plugins in the future, for sure. [00:03:19]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Stuzz	[00:05:02] Now that you've explained it, I feel obliged to listen [00:05:02]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[00:08:13] My goal is no less than doing the greatest Death Metal Album of all time. [00:08:13]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[00:08:37] So, I'm not aiming low, so to speak [00:08:37]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[00:09:13] The link is the first vocal part of the whole thing. It's sort of a theme album. [00:09:13]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Stuzz	[00:19:06] If you're here in 24 hours, I may have listened by then :) [00:19:06]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Stuzz	[00:19:34] Is there a curret 'greatest Death Metal Album of all time'? [00:19:34]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Stuzz	[00:19:39] current* [00:19:39]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[00:42:02] Stuzz: Don't think there is. And, I'm sure there would be a debate on which is the musically most great and which has both the music and the sound. [00:42:02]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[00:42:55] I for one like the early 90s. Sound-wise, that is not a great period. [00:42:55]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[00:43:42] Music-wise, I would say that is the golden age of Death Metal, and after that it just didn't much evolve. [00:43:42]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[00:45:11] The musicians got better. But, not necessarily the music. [00:45:11]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Stuzz	[00:46:13] I don't even know what death metal is these days.  Everyone wants to come up with their own sub-genre every other day [00:46:13]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Stuzz	[00:46:52] I just put it all in a catchall bucket labelled 'metal' and call it a day. [00:46:52]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	zequence	[00:49:49] Nowadays, sure. But, not before 1995. At that time it was still a different thing. [00:49:49]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Stuzz	[00:51:15] Yes [00:51:15]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Stuzz	[04:05:54] If it's a short answer...  Why so much work for the push2 device? [04:05:54]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Headwar	[06:52:31] Hi all, I'm trying to replace calf fluidsynth with a-Fluid Synth. To switch instruments inside an SF2, I simply chose the instrument in calfFS. Now with a-FS I've been told to insert a patch change. According to http://manual.ardour.org/editing-and-arranging/edit-midi/patch-change/ There should be a visible mark. My problems are : [06:52:31]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Headwar	[06:52:46] 1) I dont see anything visual indicating the patch change [06:52:46]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Headwar	[06:53:23] 2) My instrument is still the 1st one (piano in FluidR3) [06:53:23]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Headwar	[06:53:43] 3) The "patch change" doesnt list the instruments by name [06:53:43]
2016-09-26 21:42:10	Headwar	[06:53:48] Any clue ? [06:53:48]

2016-09-27 03:38:10	rgareus	 nick_m_ how are things going with the headless-chicken?  and merge back to master?
2016-09-27 03:38:48	rgareus	5.4 will break midi-compat with earlier 5.X  (where midi was incorrectly saved for non 4/4 meters)
2016-09-27 03:38:49	the_CLA_2	headless-chicken adds a tool to fix broken sessions? Did I get this right?
2016-09-27 03:39:35	rgareus	yes, so far version 5.3 had this built in.  it checked the program version and automatically converted .mid files
2016-09-27 03:39:53	rgareus	but going by program version alone is not a great idea.

2016-09-27 03:45:18	the_CLA_2	So 5.4 could increase that number.
2016-09-27 03:45:33	rgareus	and break backwards compat with 5.X..
2016-09-27 03:45:48	rgareus	still it's not relevant. the session file format is not affected
2016-09-27 03:45:58	rgareus	only .mid files in the session which were created with ardour
2016-09-27 03:46:14	rgareus	IIRC imported .mid files are also not affected
2016-09-27 03:46:52	the_CLA_2	MIDI is not compatible between those two versions anyway - so not a real problem to break backwards compat, IMHO.
2016-09-27 03:47:38	rgareus	it only affects users who (a) created or recorded  .mid  with Ardour 5.X  AND the meter was not 3/4, 4/4 or X/4

2016-09-27 04:14:02	netorama	I was curios about something, I recently saw some techniques that ps4 is putting into practice which is resolution upscaling using a neat trick. Then I saw something else which is called fps upscaling.  So it's upscaling a movie running at 30fps into 60fps.
2016-09-27 04:14:19	netorama	there's a youtube vid and the quality does increase.
2016-09-27 04:14:23	zequence	 /win17
2016-09-27 04:14:30	netorama	would it be possible to do the same with music?
2016-09-27 04:14:55	netorama	apparently is just a matter of sharpenning the waveforms or something.

2016-09-27 04:15:24	netorama	in the case of fps upscaling is simply adding more frames. What would be the analogy in music?
2016-09-27 04:15:28	netorama	sound I mean.
2016-09-27 04:17:27	_FrnchFrgg_	netorama: I'd say upsampling. But audio information theory says that a 44kHz or 48kHz is already enough to exactly represent all frequencies from 0Hz to 22kHz, that is the complete human audible range.
2016-09-27 04:18:27	_FrnchFrgg_	netorama: going from 30fps to 60fps is increasing the sampling frequency from 30Hz to 60Hz, which is very very slow compared to audio sampling.
2016-09-27 04:18:42	nstewart	aspects of that are basically what shaping and declipping do, in different ways
2016-09-27 04:19:18	_FrnchFrgg_	netorama: (Of course, our eyes have a far longer remanence than our ears in that regard, so actually 60Hz might already be beyond what our eyes can perceive)

2016-09-27 04:43:45	rgareus	playing devils' advocate:  if  "humans can experience frequencies above the limit of hearing"   that'd push the "limit of hearing" updwards  :)
2016-09-27 04:43:54	las	rgareus: it is a bit woo-ish at present, but not so much that i'd dismiss it out of hand
2016-09-27 04:44:08	las	rgareus: no, it definitely doesn't mean that they can hear them
2016-09-27 04:44:17	rgareus	aah
2016-09-27 04:44:18	las	rgareus: but it may affect the overall sensory experience 
2016-09-27 04:44:21	nstewart	I think mostly what it buys you is moving nyquist way the heck away from audio information so your filters have room to work (xx db/PER OCTAVE)
2016-09-27 04:44:35	las	rgareus: in the same way that super-subsonic frequencies can - you don't hear those either

2016-09-27 06:10:01	las	JL__: in Ardour 5.x, it is above both of them in the "main window"
2016-09-27 06:10:14	las	JL__: so you can see it whether you are looking at the editor or mixer
2016-09-27 06:10:40	las	JL__: BUT ... if you "tear off" the editor or mixer (or both), then they will not contain the transport bar - it remains in the "main window"
2016-09-27 06:10:52	las	JL__: and it is no longer possible to detach it from that window
2016-09-27 06:11:08	JL__	las: but here, the transport is in editor window ...
2016-09-27 06:13:19	JL__	las: and i have the impression i saw it in both this morning... https://snag.gy/JH8iew.jpg
2016-09-27 06:13:35	JL__	las: but ok, i forget
2016-09-27 06:13:47	las	JL__: there is no "editor window" unless you tear it off
2016-09-27 06:14:15	las	JL__: your screenshot shows the main window, which is currently showing the editor tab
2016-09-27 06:14:36	las	JL__: if the mixer has not been torn off to its own window, you can switch to the mixer tab, and still see the transport

2016-09-27 16:12:36	epaladin	OK, thanks Stuzz, I've been fighting with this since last week and thought I had it squared away last night but then when I reconnected the 828 today Ardour refused to see it again.
2016-09-27 16:13:23	nstewart	oh sorry. still.

2016-09-27 16:17:41	nstewart	for now I can just assume the destination track to be empty
2016-09-27 16:17:52	rgareus	Playlist::clear() does take some locks and can emit signals. it's one of those fn I wasn't confitent to bind, yet.
2016-09-27 16:17:56	epaladin	Sorry, but I have no idea what you guys are telling me with these: Playlist::clear() and clear_changes...

2016-09-27 16:21:23	epaladin	Also, when Ardour isn't connected to an audio device it seems to hang and won't close or "Stop" either so I have to force it closed - is that normal in Windows?
2016-09-27 16:25:15	Stuzz	epaladin: Is there much Windows talk in the forum on the Ardour site?
2016-09-27 16:25:28	Stuzz	No much in here right this moment :(
2016-09-27 16:26:00	nstewart	yeah - not a lot of windows folks in general yet, not many folks actually awake / at keyboard right now. 
2016-09-27 16:26:45	epaladin	Stuzz - I understand that Windows isn't the OS of choice for audio production and/or Ardour so I will be patient. Thanks!
2016-09-27 16:27:37	Stuzz	epaladin: There's is no OS of choice, just the one you use at the time

2016-09-27 16:30:04	rgareus	the windows version of ardour is relatively new (compared to OSX and Linux)  but  there are already more windows than OSX users: https://community.ardour.org/ping_stats

2016-09-27 16:35:23	epaladin	Reposting: Having trouble with Ardour connecting to MOTU 828 in Windows 7.  Windows sees the 828 fine and so does Ardour during the opening "Audio/MIDI" setup dialog but when the editor window opens it says "Audio:none".  When I use ASIO I can click on the Manage Device button in the Audio/MIDI setup dialog box and Ardour does open the MOTU Audio Console window as it should.  Yesterday everything worked fine, today I cannot get Ardo
2016-09-27 16:36:23	rgareus	epaladin: does it work creating a new session?
2016-09-27 16:37:02	epaladin	No, same results with either a new session or reloading a saved one.

2016-09-27 18:39:47	nstewart	if I iterate over a playlist's regions - (which I got from the selected track) , and create identical regions in the MIDI track (which currently has no notes - haven't gotten that far).

2016-09-27 18:40:23	nstewart	it might make sense to only do the top layer (for now) but I don't see how to order the layering of my regions without buildingup a list and raising/lowering them

2016-09-27 22:59:34	epaladin	[02:28:42] Well I'm new to Ardour but it seems that there're more Linux & OSX users than Windows, but I don't know for sure. [02:28:42]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	rgareus	[02:28:59] maybe it shows up /behind/  the main window  -- there were some reports on window stacking being wrong on windows. [02:28:59]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	epaladin	[02:29:54] I didn't get that dialog regareus, just had to either wait for the "Ardour isn't responding" Windows dialog or force quit using Task Manager. [02:29:54]

I get all the regions in the playlist - regardless of their layer. I see methods to get the layer number, but not to put them at a given layer.   [04:39:46]
2016-09-27 22:59:34	nstewart	[04:40:22] it might make sense to only do the top layer (for now) but I don't see how to order the layering of my regions without buildingup a list and raising/lowering them [04:40:22]

2016-09-28 03:24:12	rgareus	bennyp: usually just dropping AUs in   ~/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/Components/  is sufficient.  and either re-start ardour or manually initiate a scan
2016-09-28 03:24:34	rgareus	mmmh it's Plug-Ins  (capital I) isn't it?

2016-09-28 03:25:13	rgareus	bennyp: can you open a terminal and run     auval -a      -- that'll list all AU plugins.
2016-09-28 03:25:20	JasonSilver	I can't find anyway to get our of full screen mode in Ardour... tried all the F keys --- anyone help?
2016-09-28 03:25:31	bennyp	hitting the scan button did it. ardour didn’t scan on restart

2016-09-28 03:26:05	JasonSilver	THANK YOU
2016-09-28 03:26:09	JasonSilver	That's got it.
2016-09-28 03:26:28	bennyp	yeah not a default tho. ok thx for the headsup
2016-09-28 03:27:19	rgareus	JasonSilver:  depending on your WM,  a common way to /drag everywhere/  is  hold  "Alt"  and drag the mouse 
2016-09-28 03:28:44	rgareus	and a thing I discovered recently   Alt + right-mouse-drag resizes the window  (gnome2/mate)  that's gold!
2016-09-28 03:29:51	bennyp	is there a keyb shortcut to audition a region?
2016-09-28 03:30:05	rgareus	bennyp:  probably blacklist..  if some plugin causes ardour to crash. ardour puts it on a blacklist  and ignores it on the next scan
2016-09-28 03:31:18	JasonSilver	I couldn't get alt drag to work
2016-09-28 03:31:45	JasonSilver	Ardour does take over some key combinations, so I was really frustarted with that one. And it's not listed on any short cut pages that I could find.
2016-09-28 03:31:48	rgareus	depends on the WM.
2016-09-28 03:32:01	JasonSilver	I use Unity unfortunately.
2016-09-28 03:32:13	JasonSilver	Usually "Windows" key drag works for me.
2016-09-28 03:33:03	bennyp	huh.. why does the audition tool play all regions?
2016-09-28 03:33:08	rgareus	JasonSilver: right. I've also re-mapped  it  from <Alt> + left/right drag...  to <Windows-key> + left/right drag -- but it's not usually the default
2016-09-28 03:33:38	JasonSilver	right.
2016-09-28 03:33:43	JasonSilver	OK, thanks, back to work. :D

2016-09-28 05:33:20	bennyp	las: is it correct that this will bypass effects busses? my case is recording snippets of spoken word, applying effects through a single effects bus. I have several tracks stacked on top of each other, one track per snippet, and want to end up with snippet1.wav, snippet2.wav etc
2016-09-28 05:34:14	bennyp	also, i didn’t see an option in stem export to name based on track name

2016-09-28 13:24:09	bksubhuti_	ok.. I will search for help on google before I ask more questions.  I am quite functional now..  bye!

2016-09-29 00:46:12	the_CLA_2	[08:53:26] NoCode: Of course I use a GPU. But I can only guess what YOU mean by "also use a GPU". A dedicated graphics card? [08:53:26]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	the_CLA_2	[08:53:33] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit [08:53:33]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	LAbot	[08:53:34] Title: Graphics processing unit - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (at en.wikipedia.org) [08:53:34]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	NoCode	[08:57:11] I figured the whole system would be affected in regards to its use. Since you're manipulating chunks of data when you're in Ardour. [08:57:11]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	 *	the_CLA_2 [09:11:29] tends to like to see Ardour every now and then, when working with it. ;) [09:11:29]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	Joeboy	[09:12:34] I don't think Ardour GPU accelarates anything. As far as I know anyway. [09:12:34]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	Joeboy	[09:12:48] accelerates [09:12:48]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	the_CLA_2	[09:14:13] Joeboy: AFAIK it does. [09:14:13]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	Joeboy	[09:14:28] the_CLA_2: Do you know what? [09:14:28]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	the_CLA_2	[09:15:08] I think Cairo uses 2D acceleration. [09:15:08]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	the_CLA_2	[09:15:41] The editor canvas and other parts use Cairo. [09:15:41]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	Joeboy	[09:16:44] Ok, but it doesn't do anything like, say, use CUDA to process audio. [09:16:44]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	Joeboy	[09:17:51] I think it uses SSE to generate peakfiles or something, which is sort of comparable but doesn't actually involve a GPU. [09:17:51]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	the_CLA_2	[09:18:17] But I also tend to think that there is no current PC that doesn't use some sort of GPU to display graphics. [09:18:17]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	Joeboy	[09:18:25] Yes [09:18:25]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	Joeboy	[09:19:10] I'm guessing maybe NoCode means onboard GPU vs dedicated GPU, not no GPU vs GPU. [09:19:10]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	Joeboy	[09:19:31] In which case, it probably makes no perceivable difference as far as ardour's concerned. [09:19:31]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	the_CLA_2	[09:19:37] Joeboy: Yes, that was my thought as well, but he didn't answer that question, so... [09:19:37]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	NoCode	[09:21:38] Joeboy, Cool [09:21:38]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	the_CLA_2	[09:22:03] Joeboy: Well... Some graphics cards / drivers can cause problems - including crashes. I had that on my desktop using some lowly Radeon graphics with the open source drivers. On the laptop with the builtin Intel graphics I don't have such problems. [09:22:03]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	NoCode	[09:22:16] Yeah I meant I have onboard GPU right now. I did have a nvidia card [09:22:16]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	NoCode	[09:22:30] nice [09:22:30]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	the_CLA_2	[09:22:47] And regarding rendering: There are also some plugin GUIs wich use OpenGL for rendering. [09:22:47]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	NoCode	[09:22:47] I have an i5 4670, so hopefully that will be okay [09:22:47]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	the_CLA_2	[09:24:20] NoCode: Yes, from what I have heard so far, the Intel graphics tend to be the least troublesome. [09:24:20]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	NoCode	[09:24:59] \o/ [09:24:59]

2016-09-29 02:08:04	nick_m__	the_CLA_2, running it with no arguments will cause it to explain itself

2016-09-29 02:13:05	rgareus	nick_m__: I found a 2nd issue with deploying the tool.   libardour needs an engine to load a session.  session-utils use "Dummy" and we only include that with debug-builds :(

2016-09-29 04:22:28	puzzler	thank you for answer.  Everything seems normal except for the red dot in the top right indicating the cited error.  The tracks are there, the audio files are there.  I hit play and nothing.
2016-09-29 04:23:05	the_CLA_2	Nothing?
2016-09-29 04:23:23	puzzler	well no movement of the status bar, no sound, no activity.
2016-09-29 04:23:53	puzzler	i have gotten a wood block sound to play on this installation
2016-09-29 04:24:28	puzzler	I haven't set up midi so couldn't test some of my other files.  The song in question is audio plus some sequenced synth sounds
2016-09-29 04:24:28		[04:24]

2016-09-29 04:26:27	puzzler	the laptop mic is apparently on and I can see the levels bump up when I make noise
2016-09-29 04:26:43	the_CLA_2	Hm, no real idea. I only heard about bugs in the Ubuntu package. Maybe you could try an official release of Ardour to confirm if that is working or not. I think best would be a version from https://nightly.ardour.org/

2016-09-29 04:28:20	puzzler	so i should be able to pluck that out and put it in a new file right?
2016-09-29 04:29:13	puzzler	I am shying away from another installation because it might bring up more problems
2016-09-29 04:30:27	the_CLA_2	The packages from ardour.org install in /opt and so should not cause any trouble with system wide installs.
2016-09-29 04:31:27	puzzler	Ok i'll try it
2016-09-29 04:31:31	the_CLA_2	puzzler: You could even run the .run file with the --no-exec and --target options (see output of --help) to just extract it to somewhere you are comfortable with and run from there.
2016-09-29 04:31:46	puzzler	thanks again 
2016-09-29 04:32:09	puzzler	Maybe first I'll try doing a new track just to test this see if it's working at all
2016-09-29 04:32:17	puzzler	<out>
2016-09-29 04:33:24	the_CLA_2	I'll be AFK for a while now. Maybe someone else might provide some more insight, if needed. BBL.

2016-09-29 04:48:38	zequence	Start from one end, and look at each connection to see if it's going where it is supposed to
2016-09-29 04:49:29	puzzler	that's really over my head.  I'll try.  But it shouldn't have anything to do with the speakers, at least not yet, since it's clear that no timers are going, no movement of the playhead

2016-09-29 04:56:11	rgareus	zequence: doesn't ubuntu pull in debian/sid  on every major release?
2016-09-29 04:56:54	rgareus	since debian updated it late 2015. It should have been in Ub16.04
2016-09-29 04:57:05	zequence	rgareus: Well, yes you are right. But, you sure the fix was in Unstable by the time 14.04 came out?
2016-09-29 04:57:12	rgareus	or maybe another bad timing.
2016-09-29 04:57:26	zequence	The packages are auto imported.

2016-09-29 05:12:45	nstewart_	"Lua DSP processors have exclusive access to ARDOUR.DSP"  is this true, and is there a good reason to restrict them? The Editor action for spectragram on a region is all c++, but that's similar to what I want to do.

2016-09-29 05:25:33	rgareus	puzzler:  "no sound, no activity"  is a bit vague.  can you import some audio file and play it?   do the meters move in that case?

2016-09-29 05:26:18	nstewart_	puzzler:  when you start jack, what buffer size and periods per buffer are you using. Sample rate is usually not a concern - you could likely run 192khz if you wanted to. But latency is where performance is usually a concern.
2016-09-29 05:26:21	puzzler	I've decided to start over <rgareus>, but I haven't tried to import audio.  I added a new track, attempted to record live audio, and no activity at all

2016-09-29 06:35:51	puzzer	I'm using 2 mic jac focusrite (scarlet) and i've already recorded stuff with it
2016-09-29 06:36:01	puzzer	we're talking about playback
2016-09-29 06:36:22	rgareus	maclas: I'm just compiling a debug-buildstack on 10.10. If you need valgrinding.
2016-09-29 06:36:44	maclas	rgareus: narrowed down the crash origin to one line
2016-09-29 06:36:50	maclas	rgareus: string management
2016-09-29 06:37:19	puzzer	again, to summarize: have ardour project opened with multiple tracks, jack toggle selected; press play and playhead runs, drums kick in, no sound on midi or audio tracks though
2016-09-29 06:38:14	puzzer	this is a file from an older ubuntu studio installation that had ardour3.  I just basically copied my home directory to this ssd in the optical drive, now I'm trying to play the file from this new installation for the first time

2016-09-29 06:40:13	maclas	puzzer: wherever the mixer is visible
2016-09-29 06:40:27	puzzer	the thing with level sliders?

2016-09-29 06:52:01	puzzer	yeah 1&2 did it.  Now it's coming out the laptop speakers.  I woud like it out the focusrite minitor jack

2016-09-29 06:52:56	the_CLA_2	puzzer: Then you obviously have choosen the wrong sound card in qjackctl or the audio setup dialog - or whatever you use to start jack.
2016-09-29 06:53:19	maclas	puzzer: as noted “the most common error we see” :)
2016-09-29 06:53:19		[06:53]
2016-09-29 06:53:24	puzzer	well switching to 3&4 didn't do it
2016-09-29 06:53:41	puzzer	well earlier i thought you meant i had a physically incompatible device
2016-09-29 06:53:55	the_CLA_2	puzzer: That's not the audio setup dialog.
2016-09-29 06:54:48	puzzer	so is this the connections button in qjackl?
2016-09-29 06:54:56	the_CLA_2	How do you start jack? Do you use qjackctl to start it before Ardour or do you just start Ardour and use it's own setup?
2016-09-29 06:55:20	puzzer	currently i'm doing it manually with qjackl
2016-09-29 06:55:38	puzzer	there's an option to start it when ardour starts, i have that deselected for the time being
2016-09-29 06:56:07	maclas	puzzer: it is very simple. you are telling JACK to use the wrong device
2016-09-29 06:56:14	the_CLA_2	puzzer: In qjackctl it's the "Setup..." button.
2016-09-29 06:56:52	puzzer	you mean the driver drop-down?
2016-09-29 06:57:17	the_CLA_2	puzzer: In "settings -> interface" you choose the soundcard.
2016-09-29 06:57:41	puzzer	got it

2016-09-29 06:59:42	puzzer	ok restarted stuff and now sound is going through the scarlet monitor
2016-09-29 06:59:46	puzzer	cool thanks
2016-09-29 06:59:55	 *	maclas is forever puzzled about the user conception that leads them to forget/never think that they need to select the correct device
2016-09-29 07:00:11	 *	maclas guesses that they just imagine that the program will take over all audio devices and they can choose the outputs later
2016-09-29 07:01:02	puzzer	well when you have mutually exclusive sound drivers or whatever like alsa and jack and everything else, it takes some time to sort things out
2016-09-29 07:01:31	puzzer	now what about the fact that the laptop mic appears to be getting picked up--or it was maybe that's stopped now
2016-09-29 07:01:47	puzzer	Hmm i think that stopped
2016-09-29 07:01:58	maclas	puzzer: it will not be used unless you selected it when starting JACK
2016-09-29 07:02:33	puzzer	Ok really this is better than taking a week to read the manual
2016-09-29 07:02:51	puzzer	one more set up issue
2016-09-29 07:03:05	puzzer	last time i worked on this last summer, there was alot of latency
2016-09-29 07:03:07	the_CLA_2	Maybe watching some tutorial video would be even faster. ;)
2016-09-29 07:03:27	puzzer	i now have ubuntu on an ssd in the optical drive
2016-09-29 07:04:12	puzzer	what i mean is that i woud sing into the mic and in the playback it was noticably out of synch with the backing tracks
2016-09-29 07:04:49	maclas	puzzer: latency is dependent on settings
2016-09-29 07:05:34	puzzer	this project was started at 48ghz sample rate so I don't think I can change that.  but you are talking about buffer sizes and periods.  where do i set those?

2016-09-29 07:06:09	the_CLA_2	"and in the playback it was noticably out of synch with the backing tracks" That should usually be corrected automatically. So just try if you still get such an issue.
2016-09-29 07:07:00	puzzer	ok so there's nothing to do, now that I have it all on ssd, to optimize for low latency?
2016-09-29 07:07:22	the_CLA_2	puzzer: Buffers and period sizes are in the same tab in qjackctl as the interface selection.
2016-09-29 07:07:49	the_CLA_2	SSD doesn't play a real role in low latency.
2016-09-29 07:08:11	puzzer	well if you're using synth sounds perhaps it does
2016-09-29 07:08:29	the_CLA_2	No.
2016-09-29 07:08:29		[07:08]
2016-09-29 07:08:51	puzzer	somebody told me they dtored their sounds on an ssd to diminish latency
2016-09-29 07:08:54	puzzer	stored
2016-09-29 07:09:35	puzzer	ok anyway it's at 16 and 2 currently
2016-09-29 07:09:58	puzzer	to diminish latency, given my core2 2.4ghz and ssd, shoud/could i change these settings?
2016-09-29 07:10:07	the_CLA_2	That's extremely low. I guess you might getting xruns with that settings.
2016-09-29 07:10:31	maclas	puzzer: 16 + 2 is about as low as ANY system anywhere can go
2016-09-29 07:10:47	maclas	puzzer: you need an incredibly finely tuned hardware and software setup to make that work
2016-09-29 07:10:56	maclas	puzzer: which is unlikely “out of the box"
2016-09-29 07:11:29	puzzer	is ower finer/less given to latency?
2016-09-29 07:11:33	puzzer	lower
2016-09-29 07:11:39	puzzer	some food under my l key
2016-09-29 07:13:13	puzzer	so i'm not sure what you're saying--sounds like it's already set for a super system to maximally diminish latency
2016-09-29 07:13:19	the_CLA_2	For Frames/Period 128 or 256 might be more realistic to start with and try if you get xruns or not.

2016-09-29 08:04:03	nstewart	since you've consider that, it would be done with malloc aforethought
2016-09-29 08:05:33	rgareus	tom-: no difference.   C++'s  new  just calls malloc under the hood
2016-09-29 08:05:59	nstewart	I thought he meant create one on the stack, not malloc vs new
2016-09-29 08:06:07	rgareus	just put it on the stack (not heap)
2016-09-29 08:06:07	nstewart	but couldn't pass up the joke
2016-09-29 08:06:53	tom-	rgareus: interesting to know
2016-09-29 08:06:55	rgareus	right.  but since data on the stack isn't "created anew", I don't think he meant that
2016-09-29 08:07:12	tom-	i had a slight idea it could be stack vs heap
2016-09-29 08:07:27	tom-	but if that's true. what's all the hype about rt-safety?

2016-09-29 08:08:13	rgareus	and limited
2016-09-29 08:09:10	rgareus	and rt-safe is a lot more than just memory allocation

2016-09-29 08:09:52	tom-	i've seen that before, yes
2016-09-29 08:10:29	tom-	but if creating a float is under the hood mallocing 4 bytes, there is no difference in "waiting time", is there?
2016-09-29 08:10:48	tom-	also there is no difference if it could fail or not iiuc
2016-09-29 08:10:48	rgareus	you don't know how long it takes to allocate 4bytes
2016-09-29 08:11:03	rgareus	and usually the OS allocates in pages, anyway
2016-09-29 08:11:40	rgareus	   float x;   float x[1024];    // does NOT allocate on the heap.  it just pushes data on the stack 
2016-09-29 08:12:09	tom-	but for instance, that stack is limited
2016-09-29 08:12:09	rgareus	and as soon as the fn returns the stack is popped.
2016-09-29 08:12:21	tom-	it could easily be pushed to a limit so that a segfault results
2016-09-29 08:12:21	rgareus	like a "memory pool"
2016-09-29 08:12:33	rgareus	no segfaults

2016-09-29 08:14:15	rgareus	also in 99.9% of all cases malloc()/free() is not really an issue. it's very fast and usually rt-problems are elsewhere.
2016-09-29 08:14:22	rgareus	Still, it can block.. 
2016-09-29 08:14:31	tom-	that's my feeling too
2016-09-29 08:14:37	rgareus	and murphy.  it'll block exactly in the middle of a concert  :)
2016-09-29 08:14:39	tom-	so asked stupidly, how is a stackoverflow on the stack better than a segfault on the heap rt-wise
2016-09-29 08:15:04	tom-	rgareus: yeah :)
2016-09-29 08:15:04	rgareus	it's not better
2016-09-29 08:15:29	rgareus	but pushing/popping data onto the stack is O(1)
2016-09-29 08:15:47	rgareus	usually the app won't even start
2016-09-29 08:16:03	rgareus	unless you use alloca() at runtime.
2016-09-29 08:16:08	JL__	sorry for my silly qustion: the things you are writing bout ( malloc a s o): can those be in relation with memory corruption ?

2016-09-29 08:50:27	rgareus	it's how everything else in ardour's GUI works
2016-09-29 08:50:50	rgareus	a track "listens" to changes of all regions in the current playlist (of that track)
2016-09-29 08:51:06	rgareus	and ignores everything else. (does not subscribe to signals)
2016-09-29 08:51:24	tom-	i see
2016-09-29 08:52:14	rgareus	otherwise  every track would have to listen to a global signal... and check if the signal pertains a region on that track ...  
2016-09-29 08:53:00	tom-	or some global hashmap kind of
2016-09-29 08:53:13	tom-	you could replace things in ardour with a script, just fitting into that signalling framework
2016-09-29 08:53:29	tom-	?
2016-09-29 08:53:53	rgareus	can you write such a  "hashmap"?  I'd be interested how that'd work. 
2016-09-29 08:54:38	tom-	it's about finding who needs to be notified when a signal of interest is emitted, is that true?
2016-09-29 08:55:45	rgareus	It's about avoiding to have to look for it in the first place

2016-09-29 08:58:49	tom-	yes
2016-09-29 08:59:35	tom-	ah, the region signals are global?
2016-09-29 09:00:29	rgareus	no
2016-09-29 09:00:50	rgareus	well, there are some static signals,  -- those are available to lua script hooks
2016-09-29 09:01:16	rgareus	but the only instance specific signals that are available as hooks are from singleton instances

2016-09-29 09:41:01	rgareus	rendering onto the push2 uses ardour's libcanvas  just like the rest of ardour's GUI

2016-09-29 09:41:39	tom-	so a plugin just need to get a handle on that canvas?

2016-09-29 09:42:24	rgareus	ardour provides the canvas.
2016-09-29 09:43:02	rgareus	or a cairo-context

2016-09-29 10:21:50	puzzer	thanks i'll take a look
2016-09-29 10:22:12	rgareus	puzzer: if your target is CD, use 44100 SPS.  otherwise perfer 48000
2016-09-29 10:22:51	puzzer	my target is the hard drive.  you mean ultimately am I going to burn to cd?
2016-09-29 10:23:41	tom-	rgareus: not sure where you read that, but obviously i missed it.
2016-09-29 10:24:12	tom-	rgareus: i should do my homework, right? :)
2016-09-29 10:24:40	rgareus	tom-: why do you think Paul would attend marketing events anyway?

2016-09-29 10:29:16	the_CLA_2	rgareus: Have the findings in your linked article and the one from AutoStatic been confirmed? Especially I'm wondering about the "In the case of USB, JACK works best if the software latency is a multiple of 1ms".
2016-09-29 10:32:22	the_CLA_2	I mean: Is it generally true for all USB interfaces? For example I don't seem to have any issues running my Tascam at 2 periods.

2016-09-29 10:37:28	rgareus	the_CLA_2: yes,  USB URBs are 1ms on the physical layer
2016-09-29 10:37:58	rgareus	the_CLA_2: there's been a long post on LAU (or LAU) about this a few years ago that explains the technical details
2016-09-29 10:38:29	rgareus	the_CLA_2: measure the round-trip latency. it may effectively be higher since the kernel needs to do buffering
2016-09-29 10:39:04	rgareus	and the chance of x-runs is usually greater
2016-09-29 10:39:29	the_CLA_2	rgareus: I did a few measurements but didn't see any benefit in using 3 periods.
2016-09-29 10:40:30	the_CLA_2	That's why I'm wondering regarding the statements in those threads.

2016-09-29 10:44:39	tom-	the_CLA_2: maybe it can be looked at as a thumb rule, with exceptions
2016-09-29 10:45:15	tom-	the_CLA_2: the real behaviour can often only be found out by testing generally speaking
2016-09-29 10:45:56	tom-	so i've you've found good settings, save them somewhere safe :)
2016-09-29 10:46:19	rgareus	it's not a thumb rule. it's in the usb-spec
2016-09-29 10:46:34	the_CLA_2	tom-: Well it seemed that the statements are based on actual technical facts. So these would only change if the technical things are also different.
2016-09-29 10:46:52	rgareus	the only way to get around this is sending IRQ - which is what e.g. the NI maschine does for low-latency. every "message" is an IRQ
2016-09-29 10:49:17	tom-	using a firewire device also shows lots of irq activity
2016-09-29 10:49:31	rgareus	firewire is a lot better designed than USB

2016-09-30 00:48:23	rgareus	[01:26:04] nstewart: in short add bindings in libs/ardour/luabindings.cc  and recompile ardour [01:26:04]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	rgareus	[01:27:33] nstewart: for the case at hand there are a few small details though. it's really Readable::read()  -- AudioRegion is-a Region which implements Readable.  [01:27:33]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	rgareus	[01:28:08] but more imporantly reading from a Source may block other threads reading at the same time. [01:28:08]

2016-09-30 00:48:23	rgareus	[01:30:49] yeah same thing [01:30:49]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	rgareus	[01:31:52] though MidiRegion::read() just returns 0    see libs/ardour/ardour/midi_region.h:72 [01:31:52]

2016-09-30 00:48:23	the_CLA	[09:13:54] Hmmm... Calf plugins back in Debian Testing. Do I really want to install those!? ;P [09:13:54]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	the_CLA	[09:14:07] *giggles* [09:14:07]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	the_CLA	[09:16:50] Sooperlooper also back. *installs that instead* ;) [09:16:50]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	petererer	[09:17:48] oh? [09:17:48]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	the_CLA	[09:19:21] petererer: Aptitude showd these under "new packages" (or whatever that is called under english locales). [09:19:21]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	Headwar	[09:26:23] the_CLA, I've had issues with Calf plugins labelled "calf-plugins-git" from KxStudio repos in Ubuntu, avoid it if you can  [09:26:23]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	the_CLA	[09:30:58] Headwar: I don't have anything kx installed. And I avoid Calf in general. Just felt the urge for a little taunting. ;) [09:30:58]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	Headwar	[09:53:11] Livin on the edge ;) [09:53:11]
2016-09-30 00:48:23	petererer	[10:44:37] is it bad? [10:44:37]

2016-09-30 01:37:00		[01:31]
2016-09-30 01:39:09	rgareus	Defcronyke: it's not so much ardour itself, build-dependencies mostly
2016-09-30 01:40:02	rgareus	Defcronyke: as for LV2 it depends on the respective toolkit of the LV2-GUI. sadly a lot of LV2-devs stated publicily that they have no interest in porting the GUI.
2016-09-30 01:41:20	rgareus	s/LV2-devs/LV2-plugin-devs/  e.g. guitarix team is not interested in anything bug Linux.
2016-09-30 01:41:28	rgareus	s/bug/but/
2016-09-30 01:41:49	rgareus	zynaddsubfx is being ported, though.
2016-09-30 01:42:17	rgareus	there's a new x-platform UI in the works for zyn.

2016-09-30 01:43:50	Defcronyke	yeah i'm looking forward to it
2016-09-30 01:43:59	rgareus	all the DPF LV2 plugins work on Windows and OSX and x42-plugins are portable .. and the Harrison XT-* LV2s run on Windows...
2016-09-30 01:44:16	rgareus	Defcronyke: ask on #lad  fundamental (zyn lead dev) has some beta-builds
2016-09-30 01:44:45	Defcronyke	i have zyn running as 32-bit vst in a 64-bit ardour. it was my test to see if i could deal with audio dev on windows
2016-09-30 01:44:48	rgareus	http://fundamental-code.com/wiki/blog/2016-08-19-padsynth.png  << new zyn GUI
2016-09-30 01:44:58	Defcronyke	i wish i didn't need the jBridge to run the 32-bit though
2016-09-30 01:45:26	Defcronyke	yeah man, i've been waiting impatiently for that new UI for years :D
2016-09-30 01:46:17	rgareus	Defcronyke: what plugins do you like that don't have a 64bit version?
2016-09-30 01:46:27	rgareus	or vice versa. 
2016-09-30 01:46:37	rgareus	you could run Ardour 32bit.
2016-09-30 01:46:41	Defcronyke	maybe the official zyn can build 64-bit vst, but it's really not meant for windows, so I gave up on it
2016-09-30 01:47:00	Defcronyke	so i'm using that unofficial vst branch
2016-09-30 01:47:01	rgareus	IIRC development happens in a branch.
2016-09-30 01:47:28	rgareus	I thoght there's an official VST

2016-09-30 01:47:47	Defcronyke	yeah, but building zyn for windows was one of my worst compiling experiences ever
2016-09-30 01:47:54	Defcronyke	i won't go back to it for some weeks
2016-09-30 01:48:24	rgareus	Defcronyke: do you compile *for* windows (x-compile)  or *on* windows ?
2016-09-30 01:48:30	Defcronyke	i had to patch like 20 files, some of them every time after cmake configure
2016-09-30 01:48:39	Defcronyke	on windows, msys mingw
2016-09-30 01:48:47	rgareus	aah. OK.
2016-09-30 01:49:21	rgareus	most use mingw on Linux to produce windows binaries.
2016-09-30 01:49:35	Defcronyke	liblo is evil
2016-09-30 01:49:54	Defcronyke	and lots of \ instead of \\ in there
2016-09-30 01:49:59	Defcronyke	causing all sorts of pain
2016-09-30 01:52:14	Defcronyke	actually, trying to compile jack2 was even worse than zyn

2016-09-30 01:52:50	rgareus	Defcronyke: how's msys these days?  does it match comparable endevors on OSX (e.g homebrew)?

2016-09-30 01:53:26	Defcronyke	well, i like that it uses pacman, it feels at home since I am partial to Arch
2016-09-30 01:53:48	rgareus	Defcronyke: jack2's Code::Blocks sucks, it only really works on stephane's old OSX machine and the windows VM there. I tried and gave up.  others have since updated jack2's waf project.
2016-09-30 01:54:08	Defcronyke	the waf didn't work
2016-09-30 01:54:17	Defcronyke	only Code::Blocks got almost there
2016-09-30 01:54:30	Defcronyke	but it still failed, or I failed to patch all the right files
2016-09-30 01:54:39	Defcronyke	the setup was all wrong
2016-09-30 01:56:04	rgareus	I recall there were some hardcoded paths in there and user-specific dir..
2016-09-30 01:56:35	Defcronyke	incorrectly named libs in the linker settings
2016-09-30 01:56:42	Defcronyke	incorrect include paths
2016-09-30 01:57:02	Defcronyke	source files missing includes and defines
2016-09-30 01:57:03	rgareus	Defcronyke: if you have any patches relevant to ardour (wscript) feel free to file a pull-request.
2016-09-30 01:57:30	rgareus	Defcronyke: or mail them...
2016-09-30 01:57:32	Defcronyke	i'll try to put something together when i do this on the next system
2016-09-30 01:57:44	Defcronyke	this one is a mess
2016-09-30 02:01:26	rgareus	Defcronyke: I'm sorry about the mess.  You're only the 2nd or 3rd person who's seriously about building Ardour *on* windows.
2016-09-30 02:01:57	rgareus	all other contributors to ardour lack motivation of doing so.
2016-09-30 02:02:25	rgareus	if you can help out and improve the situation, that's welcome.
2016-09-30 02:02:41	Defcronyke	i'm using linux vm now so I can do some gaming without rebooting, and run Windows as the host, but I was only going to keep this setup if i could get ardour working with zyn, so it's a success :)
2016-09-30 02:03:03	Defcronyke	zyn is the only plugin i care about
2016-09-30 02:04:14	rgareus	Defcronyke: In that case I suggest you do contact fundamental (aka Mark McCurry).  he send out some windows-VST builds last night in response to the call for "Looking For Some ZynAddSubFX Powered Tracks"
2016-09-30 02:05:29	Defcronyke	yeah, i'd like to get zyn built so i don't have to use this unofficial fork and can ditch jBridge and run both as 64-bit
2016-09-30 02:06:28	Defcronyke	but there is a serious problem where the final .exe ld command inexplicably gets -llo when it actually needs -l:liblo.dll.a
2016-09-30 02:07:01	rgareus	I don't think official zyn rework is ready for prime-time yet. there's certainly not been a release
2016-09-30 02:07:08	Defcronyke	I tried to find all the scripts that were injecting that, but eventually just started patching the cmake output files because i couldn't find all of them
2016-09-30 02:07:31	rgareus	"-l:liblo.dll.a"  ?? what compiler eats that?
2016-09-30 02:07:31		[02:07]
2016-09-30 02:07:38	rgareus	dll.a is just a symbol file, usually
2016-09-30 02:07:41	Defcronyke	mingw
2016-09-30 02:07:58	Defcronyke	it uses those as shared libs
2016-09-30 02:08:24	rgareus	mmh. for a plugin you do want to statically link it
2016-09-30 02:08:40	Defcronyke	or maybe it's static
2016-09-30 02:08:40	rgareus	I suppose it works in this case because you end up using liblo.dll from ardour
2016-09-30 02:08:41	Defcronyke	i forget
2016-09-30 02:08:58	<--	Joschii (~joschii@89.204.154.30) has quit (Quit: quit)
2016-09-30 02:09:08	rgareus	and here just tell the linker that the symbols exist somewhere.
2016-09-30 02:09:34	Defcronyke	yeah, the problem was actually just the -llo always being added on, and causing the build to fail
2016-09-30 02:10:02	Defcronyke	i thought i grepped all the files for LIBLO or whatever
2016-09-30 02:10:08	Defcronyke	but i missed it somehwere
2016-09-30 02:11:08	rgareus	for x42-plugins windows builds, I configure liblo with    --disable-shared --enable-static
2016-09-30 02:11:30	Defcronyke	hmm... i wonder if that would solve it
2016-09-30 02:11:31	rgareus	so there's only a   liblo.a   and -llo  works
2016-09-30 02:11:37	rgareus	no dll at all.
2016-09-30 02:11:44	Defcronyke	i mean, it totally builds with -l:liblo.dll.a
2016-09-30 02:11:50	Defcronyke	it gets the symbols from there
2016-09-30 02:12:22	rgareus	I thought that's really only the symbols -- no implementaion.
2016-09-30 02:12:35	rgareus	an interface-description only

2016-09-30 02:13:09	rgareus	Defcronyke: what does the colon do? 
2016-09-30 02:13:13	Defcronyke	well it builds
2016-09-30 02:13:13	rgareus	-l:
2016-09-30 02:13:26	Defcronyke	the colon makes it not add lib as a prefix
2016-09-30 02:14:00	Defcronyke	like without the colon, lo translates to liblo.so or whatever
2016-09-30 02:14:17	Defcronyke	but with -l:lo it would translate to literally, "lo"
2016-09-30 02:14:44	rgareus	ok.  so it's equvalent as simply adding  /path/to/liblo.dll.a
2016-09-30 02:15:05	rgareus	Defcronyke: thanks
2016-09-30 02:15:11	Defcronyke	you can do that?!! the : took me way too long to figure out !
2016-09-30 02:15:54	Defcronyke	with the : it still checks some path, so it doesn't need to be absolute
2016-09-30 02:16:28	Defcronyke	but it stops it from adding the prefix and postfix to whatever you type after the :
2016-09-30 02:17:34	rgareus	Defcronyke: well, I don't know for windows..  but for static linux builds it works: https://github.com/x42/xjadeo/blob/master/x-static.sh#L90

2016-09-30 10:36:43	tom-	buzzwords won't help. i think it's about viral aspects

2016-09-30 11:01:36	at0m	when i worked with ardour, and compared it to, admittedly, much commercial projects, i'm really astonished with what it does

2016-09-30 12:45:24	tom-	nstewart: i'm curious, what will your script do?
2016-09-30 12:46:44	nstewart	high level  I'm making a stab at a batch mode polyphonic (perhaps limited to a couple notes) pitch to midi converter. 
2016-09-30 12:47:36	tom-	sounds good
2016-09-30 12:47:40	nstewart	next level - I let rhythm ferret generate note regions for the aduio track, and I'm trying to iterate over the regions, do an FFT, and pick the most confident 3 notes out of it. 
2016-09-30 12:49:11	nstewart	I tend to play 2-3 notes anyway, so I think it'll work for me for what I want, even if it's not generic enough for general purpose.
2016-09-30 12:50:08	nstewart	I think giving up real time,  having my regions already split up, and knowing that it's a guitar played in this manner narrows the field down enough that its got a shot.
2016-09-30 12:51:05	rgareus	nstewart: I have a feeling that you would rather want libaubio bindings
2016-09-30 12:51:25	rgareus	or use existing vamp-plugins 
2016-09-30 12:52:50	rgareus	nstewart: ardour can already load and run vamp plugins.   except there's no generic handler for the produced data
2016-09-30 12:53:08	rgareus	http://vamp-plugins.org/download.html has a couple of pitch + note trackers.

2016-09-30 13:35:45	rgareus	it was possible from day 1 to launch some external app from a script.

2016-09-30 16:35:57	epaladin	  MOTU 828Mk3 Output problem  My 828 has messed up analog outs when assigned thru USB 2.0 connection from Ardour v5 software. Here are the details:  Ardour to 828 routing: Ardour Track (4 outputs) to Master Busses = 1 to 1, 2 to 2, 3 to 3, 4 to 4 Master Buss Outs to 828 = M1 to Analog 1, M2 to Analog 2, M3 to Analog 3, M4 to Analog 4 (no other routing to 828!!) Results at 828 analog outs: Mono track panned to master output # 1 = equ
2016-09-30 16:37:03	las	epaladin: can you compare with other software?
2016-09-30 16:37:07	epaladin	Mono track panned to quad output # 1 = equal audio on 828 outputs 3 & 4 Mono track panned to quad output # 2 = equal audio on 828 outputs 1 & 3 Mono track panned to quad output # 3 = equal audio on 828 outputs 2 & 4 Mono track panned to quad output # 4 = equal audio on 828 outputs 3 & 4 Note that the Ardour Master Fader meters respond to the panning correctly.

2016-09-30 16:38:11	epaladin	las: not at this time, but will attempt with borrowed Focusrite interface tomorrow.  Don't have other SW at present.
2016-09-30 16:39:00	epaladin	I saw "PortAudio" in the Audio/MIDI setup window but don't know anything about it - I'll Google and see what I find...
2016-09-30 16:39:33	las	epaladin: it  is a portable audio library for most platforms 
2016-09-30 16:39:53	las	epaladin: we use it only on windows, because we have better solutions for Linux and MacOS
2016-09-30 16:40:19	las	epaladin: but it is quite widely used
2016-09-30 16:40:42	epaladin	OK, I guess there are forums about it out there so I'll take a look.  I read about JACK for Linux & OSX but I don't have either OS currently

Ardour would then decide if it's safe to keep the original depth or if it should be converted to float. This would also write float if the Sample format is not. Any thoughts?

2016-10-01 08:34:05	the_CLA_2	rgareus: Ah, yeah. I seem to remember that with lossy formats intersample peaks might come into play. But that might only be the case on encoding - not decoding.
2016-10-01 08:34:32	the_CLA_2	rgareus: What do you mean with "the same when resampling. it won't get better."?
2016-10-01 08:34:55	rgareus	the_CLA_2: resample a 16bit wav on import -> there is no need to write 24 or float data to disk

2016-10-01 08:35:35	rgareus	float maaaybe (due to intersample peaks, if the file clips)
2016-10-01 08:35:42	the_CLA_2	rgareus: On resampling intersample peaks can produce samples above 0 dBFS - so float would be needed in that case.
2016-10-01 08:36:13	rgareus	right. but those clips would already be there to begin with.
2016-10-01 08:36:22	rgareus	using float won't make it better
2016-10-01 08:36:52	the_CLA_2	rgareus: Of course the smartest way would be to temporary convert to float and analyze if there are any values above 0 dBFS - then choose to save at original depth or float.
2016-10-01 08:37:30	the_CLA_2	No, the samples in the original file are not clipped, yet.
2016-10-01 08:38:04	the_CLA_2	The intersample peaks are there, but nothing might actually be clipped.
2016-10-01 08:38:28	the_CLA_2	But after SRC it will.
2016-10-01 08:39:15	tom-	an archive should allow levels above 0dbfs imho
2016-10-01 08:40:47	rgareus	the_CLA_2: or simply apply a gain factor
2016-10-01 08:40:54	rgareus	ie normalize on input
2016-10-01 08:41:01	rgareus	after resampling
2016-10-01 08:41:09	the_CLA_2	tom-: Yeah, I discussed with rgareus a few days ago. Before the archive feature goes live there are quite a few things that should be added. Wavpack encoding might be one of them. But OTOH you could also leave the original 32 bit float waves in the archive.
2016-10-01 08:42:35	tom-	the_CLA_2: that's true
2016-10-01 08:42:35	the_CLA_2	rgareus: I thought of this as well, but... a) one might not want the actual level to be changed and b) then when using the original bit depth, additional truncation will be happening at lower levels.
2016-10-01 08:42:45	rgareus	and after the discussion the "archive" feature was postponed until "much later" :)
2016-10-01 08:43:02	tom-	it sounds good as a feature
2016-10-01 08:43:33	rgareus	since we got zip/unzip from Mixbus, I thought re-using the same infrastructure for Archive was easy... but it's not.
2016-10-01 08:43:42	the_CLA_2	tom-: I also hope it's coming in time, so I don't need to buy a new harddrive. ;)
2016-10-01 08:44:10	tom-	the data compression is just one aspect of an archive
2016-10-01 08:44:11	rgareus	"convert all files to flac" is going to help more.
2016-10-01 08:44:21	tom-	it can be important or not :)

2016-10-01 08:45:04	rgareus	you can get a 4TB USB3 HDD for $100

2016-10-01 08:47:38	beatmaker123	I'm trying to achieve an effect which simply pitch shifts down my song at the very end as it fades out. I have done this using automation but I still get 'side effects' of the plugin using the default values throughout the rest of the song from this effect (it is applied to master). Is there a way to bypass a plugin up until a certain point or do I just need a better plugin that doesnt have the side effects?

2016-10-01 08:49:43	rgareus	beatmaker123: (ardour provided) plugin-bypass cannot be automated.   
2016-10-01 08:49:58	rgareus	beatmaker123: some plugins do have a dedicated bypass (which can be automated)
2016-10-01 08:50:22	tom-	nice plugin :) like turning off the turntable
2016-10-01 08:50:38	rgareus	beatmaker123: the problem is that bypassing in general is not click-free (automation makes no sense),  so the plugin itself needs to do that
2016-10-01 08:51:18	tom-	hm, some nice plugs on this page
2016-10-01 08:51:22	rgareus	beatmaker123: you could maybe achieve this using   sends and 2 busses.    master ->  bus 1 + bus 2   ;   bus 2 has an effect  then automate the send-levels
2016-10-01 08:51:47	rgareus	ie normally play through bus 1.  near the end  cross-fade to bus 2 (with effect).
2016-10-01 08:52:22	beatmaker123	oh thats interesting, I'm kind of new to music prod. so I didn't know about the whole bus thing that sounds like it could work

2016-10-01 10:56:06	the_CLA_2	tom-: I generally tend to think that Linux itself isn't the issue with Linux audio - it's mainly the lack of the critical mass of commercial support for the 3 core components: Audio interfaces, hosts and plugins. The mass is growing, but very slowly.

2016-10-01 10:58:25	the_CLA_2	rgareus: True. But I guess we were especially talking about Desktop Pro Audio - even though not explicitly stated. ;)
2016-10-01 10:58:36	tom-	rgareus: so why does he put it like it's a tinkeres thing?
2016-10-01 10:58:47	rgareus	the "us" in the context of that page is not LADs or technically creative people
2016-10-01 10:59:23	tom-	rgareus: what i say is that the scripting functionality does not per se tell the user to become a tinkerer. but user can eventually benefit from custom usecases others have scripted (in a non-sloppy way)
2016-10-01 10:59:41	rgareus	tom-: I don't think they're interested in that either
2016-10-01 10:59:49	rgareus	you get a box as-is.
2016-10-01 11:00:20	tom-	that's the good thing here. no need for marketing to convice people why something is useful

2016-10-01 11:00:23	 *	the_CLA_2 is not really interested in scripting, either. ;)
2016-10-01 11:00:55	rgareus	the_CLA_2: then again, I can imagine you would not mind downloading an "add-on" script (once that becomes possible)
2016-10-01 11:01:03	tom-	rgareus: scripting will enable usecases that make sense and would never be hardcoded in ardour
2016-10-01 11:01:26	rgareus	tom-: of course
2016-10-01 11:01:54	tom-	at this point in time, for "writer" it won't make a difference if it's hardcoded or not
2016-10-01 11:02:27	rgareus	but like with the rest of ardour, the average user probably uses 10% of A's capabilities. 
2016-10-01 11:02:37	rgareus	but every user a different 10% :)
2016-10-01 11:02:43	the_CLA_2	rgareus: True. If that does anything I find useful... :)

2016-10-02 14:15:47	tom-	when disabled, it stops to work, if enabled it starts to work as expected
2016-10-02 14:16:06	tom-	now if it is moved out of sight in the processor box, it also stops working!
2016-10-02 14:16:23	tom-	which sort of makes sense since you'd want not to draw stuff that's not visible

2016-10-02 14:21:40	rgareus	it's conceptually a mess
2016-10-02 14:22:02	tom-	rgareus: why?
2016-10-02 14:22:28	rgareus	because plugins lack context of using threads internally
2016-10-02 14:22:52	rgareus	also it won't be in sync with anything..
2016-10-02 14:23:16	tom-	i see

2016-10-02 14:40:34	rgareus	Fam_: is ardour/jack still running and blocking the soundcard maybe?
2016-10-02 14:41:22	rgareus	Fam_: if you're on linux, check            sndfile-info /path/to/the/file.wav
2016-10-02 14:41:51	rgareus	(sndfile-info comes with the   sndfile-programs  package on most GNU/Linux distros ;  handy tool)
2016-10-02 14:43:15	tom-	rgareus: it's yet unclear why a method (which is a reduced variant of render_inline) should be conceptually wrong ..
2016-10-02 14:43:47	Fam_	Alright, am checking for JACK being stopped, and will try the sndfile-info.
2016-10-02 14:44:10	tom-	conceptually it enables the plugin to work when off-processorbox and in headless environments
2016-10-02 14:44:31	tom-	it won't do anything that it can't do now, it would do less
2016-10-02 14:45:00	rgareus	tom-: calling non-gui functions in the inline display is wrong, too.
2016-10-02 14:45:32	rgareus	even though everyting is possible in software, it does not mean it's good to do it
2016-10-02 14:45:40	tom-	rgareus: it wouldn't be called "inline display" since it would be just using the non-rt aspect of the todays render_inline

2016-10-02 15:09:34	rgareus	the problem is that the Vamp C++ api is somewhat nasty for scripting.  
2016-10-02 15:09:48	rgareus	  typedef std::vector<Feature> FeatureList  ;   typedef std::map<int, FeatureList> FeatureSet; 
2016-10-02 15:10:10	rgareus	and Feature  itself is a struct that has    std::vector<float> values;
2016-10-02 15:10:57	rgareus	so 3 levels indirection to get to acutal data.
2016-10-02 15:11:49	tom-	but it's c/c++ so that's just a tiny fraction of time
2016-10-02 15:12:14	tom-	isn't it :) -O2 #or similar and all is good
2016-10-02 15:12:15	rgareus	if one /knows/ the plugin, in C++ one can do     features[0][0].values[0]
2016-10-02 15:12:43	tom-	sounds convenient
2016-10-02 15:12:49	rgareus	but in lua one will have to convert it to a table first. 
2016-10-02 15:13:09	tom-	is it already known how a line of lua code would look like?
2016-10-02 15:13:25	tom-	the vamp plugins do different things
2016-10-02 15:13:53	tom-	but wait. when you say you're about to push that might be a superfluous question
2016-10-02 15:14:20	nstewart	ot - but does anyone have sonic-visualiser? Was trying to some, anything with the vamp plugins. It cores as soon as I open it. Guessing from the core file but I suspect because it maybe didn't find the plugins I installed.

2016-10-02 15:20:08	tom-	nstewart: you could .. hm.. rename the plugin folder

2016-10-02 15:34:19	tom-	hard to say what goes wrong there..
2016-10-02 15:36:32	tom-	it just hit me, ardour osc ports
2016-10-02 15:36:59	tom-	midi ports that carry osc messages as events, exposed as ports, directly readable and writable from plugins, like midi
2016-10-02 15:37:36	rgareus	tom-: OSC os not realtime safe
2016-10-02 15:37:39	rgareus	tom-: MIDI is
2016-10-02 15:38:10	tom-	if that's an issue, rtosc would be
2016-10-02 15:38:33	rgareus	tom-: there's a LV2 project to encapsulate generic Messages in LV2 Atoms and bridge them to OSC  https://github.com/OpenMusicKontrollers/
2016-10-02 15:39:32	tom-	rgareus: i'm not too much into LV2, it could support OSC since long with a corresponding generic "ui" (using the non-rt aspect)
2016-10-02 15:39:42	tom-	rgareus: shipping osc via midi events also not new
2016-10-02 15:39:59	nstewart	I should open a ticket that they spelled visualizer wrong. man that S is bothering me more than the core dump.  can not type it that way
2016-10-02 15:40:14	nstewart	but being british they probably wouldn't get the joke.

2016-10-02 15:40:49	rgareus	tom-: IIRC rtosc is for creating messages - it does not include network stack etc.
2016-10-02 15:41:11	tom-	rgareus: yes

2016-10-02 15:41:36	rgareus	nstewart: I'm facing similar issue.  ardour's internal API is AE,  the Vamp API BE
2016-10-02 15:41:44	rgareus	analyze() vs analyse() in this case
2016-10-02 15:41:46	tom-	rgareus: and all inside-jack, where osc is just a data container (no networking involved inside jack)
2016-10-02 15:42:24	tom-	rgareus: so that ardour could an input and output port type like midi but for osc events

2016-10-02 15:44:45	nstewart	I did a programming class in Sweden once. Their keyboards are pretty normal with a few extra characters, except for the location of {}[]/.&#; and ,  had to lear some swedish swear words. cause I couldn't even type !@#$^&

2016-10-02 15:47:14	tom-	vizualiser ehm
2016-10-02 15:52:22	tom-	rgareus: the inline display. i wouldn't exclude that it will display the clip on the movie track in future versions. or a specialized view, maybe after filters applied etc

2016-10-02 15:53:50	tom-	it is thinkable that a clip type track isn't very far away from the existing things
2016-10-02 15:53:51	rgareus	anyway I give up for the night.
