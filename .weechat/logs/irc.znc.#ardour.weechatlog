2016-09-16 01:55:39	lentferj	I can't build on debian jessie anymore because of
2016-09-16 01:55:41	lentferj	Checking for 'libarchive' >= 3.0.0                   : not found
2016-09-16 01:56:25	lentferj	which is strange, I think because of:
2016-09-16 01:56:27	lentferj	ii  libarchive1                                                 2.8.0-2kxstudio0.1                          amd64        Single library to read/write tar, cpio, pax, zip, iso9660, etc.
2016-09-16 01:56:31	lentferj	ii  libarchive13:amd64                                          3.1.2-11+deb8u2                             amd64        Multi-format archive and compression library (shared library)
2016-09-16 01:57:52	Headwar	you need the -dev version of the lib
2016-09-16 01:58:21	lentferj	well, there is none... and I built all versions of ardour since 4.x w/o problems
2016-09-16 01:58:26	Headwar	sudo apt install libarchive-dev
2016-09-16 01:58:38	Headwar	It's a new dependency
2016-09-16 01:59:05	Headwar	w/r to rgareus latest work
2016-09-16 01:59:06	lentferj	ah... there is.. need new glasses
2016-09-16 01:59:13	Headwar	;) should be ok now
2016-09-16 01:59:27	Headwar	redo a waf -configure
2016-09-16 02:00:12	lentferj	I searched for libarchive1-dev (c&p the libarchive1, adding -dev).. bleh
2016-09-16 02:00:12		[02:00]
2016-09-16 02:00:43	lentferj	so, what's that latest work adding?
2016-09-16 02:01:12	Headwar	I guess it's to open demo songs, with all the files wrapped into a single zip file
2016-09-16 02:02:41	lentferj	build runs now... thanks for the pointer :)
2016-09-16 02:02:49	Headwar	anyway this libarchive addition could be usefull someday to make archiving of sessions
2016-09-16 02:02:52	Headwar	np ;)

2016-09-16 08:47:01	rgareus	yottanami: some distros can do that setup for you, e.g. debian based ones     sudo dpkg-reconfigure -p jackd   (or jackd2)
2016-09-16 08:51:40	yottanami	rgareus, I am using Debian and I was using jackd and changed it to jackd2
2016-09-16 08:52:29	rgareus	the "Cannot lock memory" and "cannot acquire realtime"  indicates that you opted out of jack realtime permissions when installing jack.
2016-09-16 08:53:45	yottanami	rgareus, I tried dpkg-reconfigure and I got this message http://dpaste.com/39H4KCF

2016-09-16 08:59:39	rgareus	tom-: rv, ref = fun (ok)
2016-09-16 08:59:45	yottanami	If you want to run jackd with realtime priorities, the user starting jackd needs realtime permissions. Accept this option to create the file /etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf, granting realtime priority and memlock privileges to the audio group.
2016-09-16 09:00:48	rgareus	tom-: if it helps: you can think of  closures as constants.  it must be possible to replace    fun(...) with a a constant value

2016-09-16 10:41:10	OvenWerks	monitor moute should be off and no channels should have solo on.
2016-09-16 10:41:20	OvenWerks	youki: ^^
2016-09-16 10:41:30	tom-	rgareus: if the session is using a vst plugin, maybe, yes, an edge-case. that can be solved by the script
2016-09-16 10:41:35	OvenWerks	s/moute/mute/
2016-09-16 10:42:21	tom-	rgareus: the session won't crash and the most important plugin types lv2 and luaproc are served. it's a benefit believe me :)
2016-09-16 10:42:22	rgareus	tom-: LV2 plugin names are also translatable
2016-09-16 10:42:40	youki	OvenWerks, all of this is the case
2016-09-16 10:42:50	tom-	rgareus: ..by_name() does not search for plugin names anywhere, just port names
2016-09-16 10:43:09	rgareus	tom-: port-names are for human users to read.  at least in all plugin specs that I know.  they're not for a machine to be used as lookup
2016-09-16 10:43:11	tom-	rgareus: the plugin of interest is passed to the method as a pointer (i think)
2016-09-16 10:43:29	tom-	rgareus: but you're right this would be the next step. after ports, find a plugin by name
2016-09-16 10:43:39	tom-	it does not sound absurd to me
2016-09-16 10:44:04	youki	OvenWerks, i mean : activate montitoring section in Properties = no sound even if the routing is correct, deactivate it = Master to 1/2 and sound
2016-09-16 10:44:39	youki	so again there is a problem between Master and Monitoring
2016-09-16 10:44:46	tom-	rgareus: think "look up human name" and let your doubts go
2016-09-16 10:45:03	OvenWerks	youki: ya, I got that... I am trying to figure why with what you have given me so far :)
2016-09-16 10:45:14	tom-	rgareus: that's the usecase. get a port or plugin by name, as "advertised" in the gui. doesn't that make sense.

2016-09-16 10:51:34	tom-	rgareus: now how waas that with remote track id .. it's just an index (that even changes when a track is hidden). the only thing to grab it is the trackname. which again is a human name. the thing to get a handle on track
2016-09-16 10:51:36	OvenWerks	ouch
2016-09-16 10:52:03	tom-	rgareus: same thing. an alternative would be to have uuids that do not change over time

2016-09-16 10:54:17	youki	Ok, so it doesn't want any plugin in the processor section of the Montitoring

2016-09-16 10:54:44	tom-	rgareus: please give the ..by_name() methods a chance. the correct thing to do with uuid for tracks and plugins and ports is another chapter
2016-09-16 10:56:01	OvenWerks	youki: I can put processors in here in the monitor section.
2016-09-16 10:56:06	tom-	the script refers to track "guitar", but it was changed to "kitar". kind of a localization. script will fail or rely on changing index of track
2016-09-16 10:56:46	tom-	instead, it could create a track or get a handle to it via index or name, and then remember its uuid 
2016-09-16 10:56:50	OvenWerks	tom-: localization has to be done pre-compile... I think. I do not think track name would change.
2016-09-16 10:56:57	tom-	that wont change during the lifecycle of "thing"
2016-09-16 10:57:17	youki	OvenWerks, yeak, i usually can do it as well. So i guess i have two solutions, 1/ i don't use a monitoring section : not practical - 2/ i create a new session and copy all the setting by hand before to import the regions from the current session. I already have an headache just thinking about it
2016-09-16 10:57:21	tom-	and of course access/manipulate "thing" by uuid
2016-09-16 10:57:34	youki	OvenWerks, thanks for trying to help anyway
2016-09-16 10:57:51	tom-	it's totally irrelevant how and where "thing" is sorted in
2016-09-16 10:57:59	tom-	and how it's localized even
2016-09-16 10:58:18	OvenWerks	youki: no problem... I am still wondering to myself why that would be.
2016-09-16 10:58:30	tom-	for now, .._by_name() seemed the most pragmatic method

2016-09-16 11:50:26	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: The problem is not "by-string". It's that the name is not stable enough to be a reliable reference.
2016-09-16 11:50:49	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: do you agree it *can be* a usecase to reference things as ".. i would like the user to see .. user-friendly text" ??
2016-09-16 11:51:09	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: I cannot parse your sentence
2016-09-16 11:51:25	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: you said ""how I would like the user to see  that port designated with an user-friendly text"

2016-09-16 11:51:53	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: do you agree that someone could want to use that friendly text as a reference to that thing.
2016-09-16 11:51:55	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Yes, but that's not a name->port mapping, but the reverse

2016-09-16 11:52:34	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: if you agree, i'd like why you thing looking up a plugin parameter by name is not a viable method
2016-09-16 11:52:37	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: There might even not be any guarantee that the names are unique...
2016-09-16 11:53:35	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: that's not at question
2016-09-16 11:54:16	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: IOW, the plugin gives the host a port->name mapping, that might or might not be one-to-one, and is certainly not constant across systems where the session can be shared/loaded and you want to derive a name->port out of it.
2016-09-16 11:54:33	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: we make different base assumptions i guess. i think i'd like to lookup by an id that doesn't change. yes i do. but i also do want to lookup by a name that's displayed to the user, that can change. i do that too.
2016-09-16 11:55:24	tom-	its too easy to agree on that usecase
2016-09-16 11:55:26	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: That friendly text could thus be, only when uniqueness is ensured, a *time-limited* reference to the thing
2016-09-16 11:55:38	tom-	i have to add some twist to make it riddle-worthy for geeks :)
2016-09-16 11:56:05	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: That's not very good, and bad enough for reliability that it was prohibited
2016-09-16 11:56:27	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Nobody wants a session that breaks just because it was loaded on a different locale
2016-09-16 11:57:01	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: define "reliable"
2016-09-16 11:57:16	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: the user wants to select the port by its user-friendly name (in a dropdown), but expects that afterwards the selected port will be matched correctly even if the locale changes

2016-09-16 11:59:13	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: but again, users don't expect that it would be just a textual match. They designate the *port* itself by choosing its name. They do that for 50 tracks, then save, and their buddy with another locale has to redo the port selection all over again at session load ?

2016-09-16 12:03:06	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: it does what it promises. looking up by a name.
2016-09-16 12:03:14	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: it does that reliably.

2016-09-16 12:03:49	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: But remembering the name is not a reliable way to reference a port

2016-09-16 12:30:21	tom-	name that can change  is not a reliable way to uniquely identify it, but it can reliably  tell if a looked up name exists or not
2016-09-16 12:31:03	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: a) users could have wrong expectations: I just meant that a lookup_by_* api will be used by scripts, and then users might be surprised/upset if the lookup doesn't work sometimes yet works other times because names are changing.
2016-09-16 12:31:36	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: it is obvious in the reference, that is generated from the source (comments)
2016-09-16 12:31:57	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: you can't do anything lua without looking there if not using examples and not exceding what they do
2016-09-16 12:32:36	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: rgareus ok that makes it b and c left. i'd like to know if this is correct or missing another aspect

2016-09-16 12:33:08	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: I really see "lookup by name" as a one-shot lookup to get a port id which will be the correct reference afterwards (and that one would be saved)

2016-09-16 13:05:33	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: The problem is « there can be cases where you exactly want that: lookup by name »
2016-09-16 13:05:44	rgareus	just so that I can move on to more important things:  there won't be a core function  loookup_by_name()  for names that are not fixed nor unique.
2016-09-16 13:05:51	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: You didn't give any compelling reasons that it's wanted
2016-09-16 13:05:52	tom-	i'd like you to agree that this intention to lookup by name isn't violating the plugin naming rules
2016-09-16 13:06:03	tom-	that would let us scratch b)
2016-09-16 13:06:43	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: And rgareus gave good reasons that it's actually bad to have that, because it's not a lookup (the word implies some mapping/reliability/reproducability) but a search
2016-09-16 13:08:01	tom-	does it?
2016-09-16 13:08:06	_FrnchFrgg_	(at least to me, lookup feels more like getElementById than "search")
2016-09-16 13:08:26	tom-	lookup isn't even part of the method name
2016-09-16 13:08:37	tom-	get_bla_by_name. 
2016-09-16 13:08:52	_FrnchFrgg_	And it would even more if there are other "lookup_by" that are reliable
2016-09-16 13:09:12	tom-	you can call get_bla(_by_index) and set a wrong index. spectacular
2016-09-16 13:09:44	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: My problem is that I think your use cases *will* break when the names change (I can't be sure since you didn't tell them clearly).
2016-09-16 13:10:55	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: So putting that in the API will encourage people to use it *even with warnings* for quick/dirty things, and then there will be a lot of unreliable scripts in the wild
2016-09-16 13:11:18	tom-	you ponder on something i thought we have sorted out
2016-09-16 13:11:47	tom-	i'd like to scratch b) or get facts
2016-09-16 13:11:52	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: I don't know if that's rgareus reasoning but anyway I think he told his last call so I'm not sure if there is anything to continue
2016-09-16 13:13:08	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: if that's your last call, then yes :)
2016-09-16 13:13:43	tom-	it's still unsolved for me. unfinished discussion, due to fade-away of participants
2016-09-16 13:13:44	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: I'm not the one to convince here, and you didn't succeed in convincing the one that can decide
2016-09-16 13:14:00	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: rgareus didn't fade away.
2016-09-16 13:15:38	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: and I'm the only other participant apart you, so I'm not sure what's your point.
2016-09-16 13:16:50	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: rgareus just stopped trying to convince you
2016-09-16 13:17:00	tom-	it's a pitty rgareus removed the most interesting part of my commit, and his reasoning wasn't reasonable for me. tracking it down to facts shows to be impossible atm.
2016-09-16 13:19:14	tom-	that's all. having that removed for no good reason is what drives my lust to ask for facts.
2016-09-16 13:19:30	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: it's a fact that he has a lot of experience about plugin specs and their quality; it's a fact that he thinks that part wasn't good enough to stay. Sure that's an argument of authority but he/I also tried to give "factual" reasons
2016-09-16 13:19:30		[13:19]
2016-09-16 13:20:02	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: That you all quickly, unilaterally, and without enough pondering (IMHO) decided were n/a
2016-09-16 13:21:12	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: That's not how a reasoning is made. Again, you manage consensus as if it were a fight, with positions to overthrow and take control of.
2016-09-16 13:21:23	_FrnchFrgg_	eliminate a), then b) then I win
2016-09-16 13:21:56	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: At least it felt like that to me
2016-09-16 13:22:21	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: I don't know you enough to tell if that's how you are or just a misunderstanding from me
2016-09-16 13:22:32	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Or a problem due to the IRC medium
2016-09-16 13:22:53	rgareus	tom-: I gave you lots of good reasons.
2016-09-16 13:23:10	tom-	not sure about the "i win" part. it would be "we win". but having a list of stuff to not randomly jump to other stacks is probably not the worst thing to do, don't you think.

2016-09-16 13:30:26	kurumin	_FrnchFrgg_, Yes, it is explained in the TRANLATORS file. But it does not work. I tried several times...
2016-09-16 13:30:49	kurumin	Should I copy manually?
2016-09-16 13:30:56	kurumin	from other language?

2016-09-16 13:31:28	_FrnchFrgg_	kurumin: But there should be a .pot file
2016-09-16 13:31:33	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: a last question on the topic. why do you think doing the same thing in the script would be a better idea than having a function in the lua api that just does that?
2016-09-16 13:31:35	_FrnchFrgg_	kurumin: That's the one you should copy
2016-09-16 13:31:54	_FrnchFrgg_	kurumin: Of course you can copy an other language file, and clean it, but that's more work
2016-09-16 13:32:20	kurumin	there is no pot file in the libs/ardour/po folder...

2016-09-16 13:37:01	kurumin	_FrnchFrgg_, Thanks!!
2016-09-16 13:37:39	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Because if you want to write a script with a loop that can easily break, nobody will prevent you. And you might happen to be sure it will always be used in a controlled environment so that it will always work
2016-09-16 13:38:06	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: But promoting it into an official API doesn't have the same standard
2016-09-16 13:38:45	rgareus	_FrnchFrgg_: I know little about translations
2016-09-16 13:38:45	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: you seem to imply that "it can break" now.

2016-09-16 13:43:32	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: it can break == you select a port using a name, save the session on a usb key, open it on another computer with a different locale or even different config that affects port names, and now your plugin is no longer useful unless you change the name to match, ad nauseam if you exchange back and forth
2016-09-16 13:44:03	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: the same happens if a plugin is missing. news at 1:42
2016-09-16 13:44:08	_FrnchFrgg_	and since it's the plugin (thus completely out of our control) that chooses the names, it can change for a lot of reasons
2016-09-16 13:44:14	rgareus	or a plugin can also have a two ports with the same name.
2016-09-16 13:44:50	tom-	not of the same type i guess, or yes?
2016-09-16 13:44:53	rgareus	heck, we're still at this and I have not even heard a good reason why one would want to look-up ports by name in the first place
2016-09-16 13:44:56	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: I already told that argument (duplicate names).
2016-09-16 13:45:04	tom-	can i have two input ports names foo? fantastic
2016-09-16 13:45:21	rgareus	tom-: you can have tree
2016-09-16 13:45:24	rgareus	three*
2016-09-16 13:45:29	rgareus	if that makes you happy
2016-09-16 13:45:41	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Since the name is for display, the plugin can ask for all its ports to have the same name...
2016-09-16 13:45:48	tom-	i want at least 42 you should now
2016-09-16 13:45:49	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: The host won't care
2016-09-16 13:45:49	rgareus	and all 3 can be "pink foo", too
2016-09-16 13:46:04	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Of course I don't expect plugins to do that, but
2016-09-16 13:46:20	tom-	the methods need to be renamed ... _first_found__
2016-09-16 13:46:39	rgareus	except in French it'll be fôô :)
2016-09-16 13:46:41	tom-	there is that variable for small screens. we could do similar
2016-09-16 13:46:42	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: But why add a method if there is almost no user ?
2016-09-16 13:47:51	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: try to look at it generically
2016-09-16 13:47:57	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: To me it's the exact same discussion as for plugins that only display text in the processor box, and don't process anything, and their need for API that no other plugin uses

2016-09-16 13:49:51	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: But you didn't yet make a case for why it would be great to add it. We cannot pollute the API with all methods that we can imagine could be useful one day

2016-09-16 13:49:56	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: point being, it needs a facility to lookup a port or plugin by name
2016-09-16 13:50:42	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Point is you think it needs it. We don't, and you didn't succeed (nor really provide real arguments) to convince us.
2016-09-16 13:51:13	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: if you look at it generically, the decision is made. you must have good reasons for not having that facility.
2016-09-16 13:51:23	rgareus	a *generic* API for a very special case?   find_first_parameter_with_given_display_name_if_any()    that's an oxymoron.
2016-09-16 13:51:37	rgareus	can we please stop this?
2016-09-16 13:51:48	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: To me you didn't come up with any reasoning that "generically it's a no brainer"
2016-09-16 13:51:49	tom-	just one last answer, for the usecase
2016-09-16 13:52:06	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: IOW, to me the burden of proof is still on you
2016-09-16 13:52:10	tom-	the usecase is obvious: looking up a parameter by a name which index could change
2016-09-16 13:52:26	tom-	or does not change, but i know the name for sure
2016-09-16 13:52:42	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Anyway, it's very late here (almost 2am) so I'll have to call it quits, sorry
2016-09-16 13:53:10	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: You don't know the name for sure
2016-09-16 13:53:22	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: the one i want to lookup? yes, i know it
2016-09-16 13:53:24	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: That point was made again and again.
2016-09-16 13:53:42	tom-	yes :) but we have difficulties to get common ground on distinction :)
2016-09-16 13:53:42	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: No, you know the name in one locale/configuration
2016-09-16 13:54:06	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Which is less stable than the parameter index
2016-09-16 13:54:33	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Which will only change if the plugin is updated and changed its port order
2016-09-16 13:54:36	tom-	it doesn't make it more right if you ponder on stable or break
2016-09-16 13:55:07	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: And then if the plugin is updated, display names could change as much too
2016-09-16 13:57:02	tom-	yes, it'd not an id. yes, it's a name that can change. yes, we need to be able to look it up. yes, it is not better or worse than using an index for that.
2016-09-16 13:57:54	tom-	yes, a name can be more useful in a script than a number
2016-09-16 13:58:01	_FrnchFrgg_	indices are guaranteed to be unique, so I wouldn't say that names are not worse
2016-09-16 13:58:05	tom-	yes, a script should not be machine-centric in the first place
2016-09-16 13:58:29	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Is there a search by name API in other DAWs ?
2016-09-16 13:58:43	tom-	when did the first man go to moon?
2016-09-16 13:59:06	rgareus	please stop this nonsense
2016-09-16 13:59:14	tom-	i'm sure they could already do it back then
2016-09-16 13:59:21	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: That definitely have the user as the center of their scripts, so actually care about not being machine-centric and usefulness and easiness of use
2016-09-16 13:59:53	rgareus	a script is a program which should do a task reliably.
2016-09-16 14:00:05	tom-	better nobly stay in the bg
2016-09-16 14:00:16	rgareus	"machine-centric" and words like that have no meaning.

2016-09-16 14:01:09	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: I agree with rgareus. A script that works once in a session then doesn't anymore is broken, and the API shouldn't give users sticks to beat themselves with

2016-09-16 14:02:20	_FrnchFrgg_	And big warnings won't prevent that better than not adding the API in the first place
2016-09-16 14:02:51	_FrnchFrgg_	I mean adding an API with comments *DON'T use this API and expect it to reliably return the port you're looking for*
2016-09-16 14:02:55	_FrnchFrgg_	Really ?
2016-09-16 14:03:09	_FrnchFrgg_	Why not adding an API and deprecating it at the same time ?
2016-09-16 14:03:16	_FrnchFrgg_	That would be fun too
2016-09-16 14:03:29	tom-	why do you want to warn about anything?
2016-09-16 14:04:22	tom-	you can on every plugin startup tell the user that his or her automation will probably break if the same plugin will be installed with a differen param name set
2016-09-16 14:04:49	tom-	if name or count, index or names have changed
2016-09-16 14:05:02	tom-	your arguments aren't wrong but i think they address a larger issue
2016-09-16 14:05:02		[14:05]
2016-09-16 14:05:03	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Else script writers (which are users, probably even not proficient in programming), will use the API, and wonder why their very good session that's their life and salary just broke when run in the client/boss studio when it worked perfectly in their own
2016-09-16 14:05:57	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: in that case: what is different exactly?
2016-09-16 14:06:07	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: a localized vst parameter name?
2016-09-16 14:06:08	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Changing the locale is far more benign than having different versions of plugins
2016-09-16 14:06:15	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: or can it be anything else?
2016-09-16 14:06:19	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Or missing a plugin altogether
2016-09-16 14:06:40	tom-	as i said, you're addressing larger issues enclosing by_name()
2016-09-16 14:08:20	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Anyway, I really need sleep. (And the fact that sessions are not always portable is partly addressed by bundled plugins, and the fact that there problems exist doesn't make other portability problems like the one here less relevant)
2016-09-16 14:08:21	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: if you get a session with only lua procs or bypacked a-* plugins. it will be relatively sure that it will work 100% since the plugins are inlined.
2016-09-16 14:08:44	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: unless the plugins itself change (the non-inlined lua ones), in which case you might encounter other issues first

2016-09-16 23:55:45	tom-	[09:47:34] rgareus: and feeling that not for every code and commiter the same measures and rules are applied [09:47:34]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	rgareus	[09:48:09] it's not about persons. it's about interfaces [09:48:09]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	tom-	[09:48:25] rgareus: you could possibly take any file in the source tree and with some nitpicking find things that don't comply with the rules you at some points in time enforce to a special degree [09:48:25]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	rgareus	[09:48:53] lookup_plugin_port_by_name() is a horrible API. [09:48:53]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	tom-	[09:49:20] rgareus: i'm just analyzing, that's why i think i was touched if not to say hurt. because when you say stuff, it's not just anybody. i normaly find your stuff beatiful and reasonable. so even harder to accept [09:49:20]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	rgareus	[09:49:44] you already have all the methords to get exactly that in a script in about 5 mins if you need it.  and then you have control over the possible edge cases [09:49:44]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	tom-	[09:49:44] you invented the lookup :) [09:49:44]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	tom-	[09:50:10] rgareus: no questions about that [09:50:10]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	rgareus	[09:50:36] looking up by name requires iterating over ports. [09:50:36]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	rgareus	[09:50:58] in a script you can do that once and build a LUT.   in libardour you can't do that. [09:50:58]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	tom-	[09:51:26] yes, but i'd bet it's quicker anyway [09:51:26]

2016-09-16 23:55:45	rgareus	[09:51:46] libardour can't assume that port-names won't change or can't know what do to in case of dups  and will have to iterate *every* time. [09:51:46]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	rgareus	[09:52:23] and apart from that it's not a reliable  way of looking up ports and it should be discouraged [09:52:23]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	rgareus	[09:52:39] LV2 explicitly forbids it in the spec..  [09:52:39]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	rgareus	[09:53:08] if you want to do it anyway...  yes you can with a script, but it won't be part of an API exposed by libardour [09:53:08]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	tom-	[09:53:51] that is i think where you make a wrong link. with obfuscated reasoning [09:53:51]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	tom-	[09:54:24] is it reliable to query if a value is above 1.2? [09:54:24]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	tom-	[09:54:37] is it reliable to query if a port is named "foo"? [09:54:37]
2016-09-16 23:55:45	tom-	[09:55:02] we assume different problems to be solved [09:55:02]

2016-09-16 23:56:04	tom-	the idea of it being somehow a lookup table is a wrong model to look at it
2016-09-16 23:56:10	--	Channel created on Sat, 25 Nov 2006 20:42:44
2016-09-16 23:56:43	tom-	you could have a lookup table saying for every other value if it is below or above 1.2. but it's easier to query if it's above or below directly
2016-09-16 23:57:16	rgareus	tom-: this is #ardour and not programming school.
2016-09-16 23:57:16	tom-	using by_name() does not guarantee that the queried item does exist under that name
2016-09-16 23:58:55	tom-	same like it's totally dependent on the caller what value he/she wants to check
2016-09-17 00:01:10	tom-	for the pragmatic part of it, tracks i.e. are sure to be unique
2016-09-17 00:01:50	tom-	they can still change.. not better or worse than using an index that will change for a given plugin
2016-09-17 00:02:33	tom-	i think the term "remote id" is misleading in the current code base
2016-09-17 00:03:03	rgareus	that's an entierly different API
2016-09-17 00:03:43	rgareus	tom-: why do you keep arguing?
2016-09-17 00:05:48	tom-	rgareus: because it's eating me up
2016-09-17 00:06:36	tom-	rgareus: i think you've lost your mind in that particular thing we are talking about

2016-09-17 00:14:07	rgareus	Caterpillar: reasonable-synth is /piano-like/ and probably the simplest way (just add the plugin, no settings,...)
2016-09-17 00:14:19	tom-	rgareus: stupid things like this are the grounds for taking a different path
2016-09-17 00:14:31	rgareus	as for fluidsynth:  http://download.linuxaudio.org/musical-instrument-libraries/sf2/fluidr3-splitted/    has truly /free/ soundfonts. incl some piano ones

2016-09-17 00:16:07	Caterpillar	rgareus: I can't find where I can make Ardour load such plugin
2016-09-17 00:16:08	tom-	rgareus: because i'm so totally convinced that querying (to not say looking up) something by a name is absolutely necessary to have
2016-09-17 00:16:23	rgareus	Caterpillar: which version of Ardour is that?
2016-09-17 00:16:37	Caterpillar	rgareus: 5.0.0
2016-09-17 00:16:52	rgareus	Caterpillar: too old I'm afraid.
2016-09-17 00:17:03	tom-	rgareus: since it's a returning demand, it makes sense to have it in the c++ api rather that copy & paste it in scripts
2016-09-17 00:17:09	rgareus	Caterpillar: a-fluidsynth was added in 5.1 
2016-09-17 00:17:18	Caterpillar	rgareus: no problem, I install the 5.1
2016-09-17 00:17:37	rgareus	Caterpillar: go for 5.3
2016-09-17 00:18:42	rgareus	Caterpillar: LinuxSampler is an option or calf-fluidsynth (though the latter has various issues)  and either is likely more complicated
2016-09-17 00:20:00	Caterpillar	I am installing 5.5 since I have found out that it has been included into Fedora repositories
2016-09-17 00:20:05	Caterpillar	ah pardon

2016-09-17 00:35:57	Caterpillar	rgareus: I added an audio track. Where is the instrument list?
2016-09-17 00:36:12	rgareus	Caterpillar: you'll want a MIDI track  for instruments
2016-09-17 00:36:34	Caterpillar	ok added
2016-09-17 00:36:48	rgareus	if you select "MIDI track" in  the "Add Track or Bus" dialog, there's a dropdown directly in that dialog to select an instrument
2016-09-17 00:37:11	rgareus	you can change that instrument later, though in the Mixer (it's just a plugin)
2016-09-17 00:37:36	Caterpillar	now I have to load FluidR3_GM.sf2
2016-09-17 00:38:06	rgareus	open the plugin GUI (double click on the plugin in the mixer)

2016-09-17 00:41:22	rgareus	it also looks like that MIDI track is not connected to any inputs (MIDI-keyboard) yet.

2016-09-17 00:42:41	rgareus	mmh looks like there's something wrong with the Italian translation (for "Manual")
2016-09-17 00:43:05	rgareus	Caterpillar: since you don't have a midi-keyboard:   in the editor window,   increase the height of the MIDI track
2016-09-17 00:43:15	rgareus	(or select the track, press 'f')
2016-09-17 00:43:30	rgareus	Caterpillar:  piano-roll  will appear
2016-09-17 00:43:38	rgareus	where you can press notes..
2016-09-17 00:44:33	rgareus	if you have not done much MIDI,   http://manual.ardour.org/editing-and-arranging/edit-midi/   and  http://libremusicproduction.com/tutorials/recording-audio-and-using-midi-ardour-3  explain that

2016-09-17 01:03:02	rgareus	usually from a midi-keyboard ; almost all have a dedicated knob or button for that
2016-09-17 01:03:39	Caterpillar	rgareus: the piano we just selected is the most "classical" one?
2016-09-17 01:03:48	rgareus	jack-keyboard or vmpk  also have controls
2016-09-17 01:04:19	rgareus	Caterpillar: "classical" in the sense of 80's MIDI standard, yes :)
2016-09-17 01:04:28	rgareus	program 1 in General MIDI is a Piano.
2016-09-17 01:04:36	rgareus	and that's the default
2016-09-17 01:04:47	Caterpillar	rgareus: no I meant if it produces a sound similar to a real piano

2016-09-17 01:05:58	rgareus	which is OKish -- but not really great.
2016-09-17 01:06:34	rgareus	if you mix it into a performance, it's good enough for a lot of things.  but if you want to play piano solo.  it sounds flat.
2016-09-17 01:06:53	rgareus	or boring or lacks character
2016-09-17 01:09:34	Caterpillar	rgareus: I actually need a piano only to make some exercize voices about trying to reach and keep some various tones. We did it once during dubbing lessons I have taken
2016-09-17 01:10:35	rgareus	that fluidsynth/sf2 sound is more than good enough then
2016-09-17 01:10:42	Caterpillar	ok
2016-09-17 01:11:28	rgareus	by analogy: you don't need a Steinway Grand Piano for that, either
2016-09-17 01:12:15	rgareus	any cheap piano will do (as long as it's in tune)

2016-09-17 11:17:55	tom-	melanie__: so getting a POV from the origin of this rule can be interesting
2016-09-17 11:18:14	melanie__	tom-: well i do not know the code but out of the spec to not use the name as an identifier it does not say that it is impossible but it says that code doing so should be rejected
2016-09-17 11:19:22	tom-	melanie__: it's not impossible indeed
2016-09-17 11:20:03	tom-	melanie__: when it's agreed that a port label is not an identifier. why would it be rejected to query for it.
2016-09-17 11:20:03		[11:20]
2016-09-17 11:20:34	tom-	because we're not lookup by an identifier we know exists for sure. 
2016-09-17 11:20:38	melanie__	tom-: because of the specification that is like a law
2016-09-17 11:21:22	tom-	melanie__: yeah, but if a label is not looked at as an identifier. this rule does not apply, does it?
2016-09-17 11:21:53	tom-	i'd really like to get drobilla's view on this
2016-09-17 11:22:20	melanie__	how do you use it?
2016-09-17 11:24:13	tom-	melanie__: you refer to query by name?
2016-09-17 11:25:00	tom-	melanie__: it doesn't exist in ardour, it can only be scripted
2016-09-17 11:25:24	melanie__	tom-: yes give me an example of why you want to look it up and how you use it
2016-09-17 11:25:52	melanie__	tom-: think of me as someone dumb you explain it
2016-09-17 11:26:14	tom-	melanie__: i know i have a plugin named "foo" with a port named "bar". i'd like to say "look for first plugin named "foo" on track x, set parameter "bar" to value z
2016-09-17 11:26:44	tom-	melanie__: for doing that, it's enough to look at the plugin name and the generic plugin control window
2016-09-17 11:27:18	tom-	melanie__: i can then move the plugin, it still works because it doesn't rely on the index which in that case could change
2016-09-17 11:27:28	tom-	melanie__: good enough? :)
2016-09-17 11:28:44	tom-	melanie__: also i can change the order of the parameters of a (scripted) plugin, and it still works because the name is (in my case) more stable than the sorted-in position of the control
2016-09-17 11:28:44	melanie__	tom-: and how would you then lookup plugin foo with bar and foo.1 with bar?
2016-09-17 11:29:29	tom-	melanie__: i'd take the second element of the result of the query
2016-09-17 11:31:09	tom-	it's important to see that a lookup that results in zero or one element is different to getting zero or more as a result of a query that can match more than one element (since it's not an identifier that is unique)
2016-09-17 11:31:50	rgareus	why would you use an unreliable lookup (by name) if you can use a reliable lookup by ID?
2016-09-17 11:31:53	tom-	melanie__: often, a query for a port by label with either give zero or one return
2016-09-17 11:32:06	tom-	melanie__: i could then check, aha, only one element, good, i'll use that one
2016-09-17 11:32:31	tom-	rgareus: because there is no ID that deserves the name
2016-09-17 11:32:35	melanie__	well then it would be mor reliable to use pid in the system and not names  
2016-09-17 11:33:58	tom-	we need both
2016-09-17 11:33:59	rgareus	there is a designated numeric ID in the spec of all plugins. and the spec even mandates that it must not change.
2016-09-17 11:34:02	melanie__	which is what  i think is the thought on that the pid is linked to the identifier wich leads to being able to start more than one plugin with the same name
2016-09-17 11:34:12	tom-	a reliable way to lookup by a unique identifier
2016-09-17 11:34:25	tom-	a reliable way to lookup by a *session-wide unique* identifier
2016-09-17 11:34:44	tom-	and a way to query by non-identifiers, expecting 0 or more results

2016-09-17 11:40:30	tom-	i'll have a look thanks
2016-09-17 11:41:14	rgareus	almost all Objects inherit from PBD::Stateful which has a ID
2016-09-17 11:41:22	tom-	that doesn't make the need to also query by non-identifiers obsolete
2016-09-17 11:42:10	tom-	also if i understand that correctly: this session-wide id will be different in other sessions
2016-09-17 11:42:31	tom-	so it's worse than using a port label, which is probably more static across sessions, right?
2016-09-17 11:42:45	rgareus	looking up someething that is not an ID is not a great idea
2016-09-17 11:43:03	tom-	querying something is a great idea
2016-09-17 11:43:41	tom-	it feels natural. i can query without knowing beforehand if i'l get 0, 1 or more matches
2016-09-17 11:44:13	tom-	i could ask here: who likes little britain?
2016-09-17 11:44:37	tom-	totally unsure if 0 or more replies will be resulting
2016-09-17 11:45:09	tom-	i would not say lookup("i already know who likes little britain because i know the unique id")
2016-09-17 11:45:56	tom-	so that's a fundamental difference in lookup using a unique id versus querying using an argument NOT being a unique identifier
2016-09-17 11:47:00	melanie__	hm reminds a bit of sql queries
2016-09-17 11:47:52	rgareus	queries are complex. A lookup is O(1).

2016-09-17 11:51:24	tom-	as far as i can see, there are many places in the ardour code where something is found by iterating over a list
2016-09-17 11:51:50	tom-	so that's not O(1) at all iiuc
2016-09-17 11:51:50		[11:51]

2016-09-17 11:53:06	tom-	OvenWerks: exactly
2016-09-17 11:53:12	rgareus	nocomply: the crash is in completely unrelated code.
2016-09-17 11:53:36	nocomply	rgareus: ok, well thanks for looking anyway
2016-09-17 11:54:07	OvenWerks	tom-: so for the API to do it for you the API has to be able to search by any odd thing you might come up with. That could be a number of search calls
2016-09-17 11:54:46	rgareus	the difference is that the existing APIs look for unique and designated IDs
2016-09-17 11:56:09	tom-	using a non-identifier to query is also just only a way to get a real id
2016-09-17 11:56:33	tom-	melanie__: i look at it a bit like an sql query indeed, that's a good analogy
2016-09-17 11:57:08	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Why introduce an SQL-like query mechanism when you can write it in lua ?
2016-09-17 11:57:13	tom-	query by non-identifier to get a list of matching items (identified by id). i can then use the id from then on that i don't even have to know beforehand)
2016-09-17 11:57:57	melanie__	tom-: :)
2016-09-17 11:57:59	rgareus	why even consider something unreliable in a DAW which should be 100% rock solid, when there's already a solid way?
2016-09-17 11:58:18	tom-	rgareus: what's unreliable about iterating over a list?
2016-09-17 11:58:44	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Why is an Ardour-provided filter by name (because that's not a lookup but a filter in fact that you want) that much better than the exact same loop in lua ?
2016-09-17 11:58:47	rgareus	you may or may not find a result, or maybe you find one one full moon on a machine in Iceland with translations turned on...
2016-09-17 11:58:54	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: i'm tempted to read "an SQL-like query mechanism, implemented in lua" :)
2016-09-17 11:59:12	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: esp. since the loop in lua can be customized to check for other things than name if needed
2016-09-17 11:59:12	melanie__	tom-: found a few weeks ago the following query select * from users where Firstname=usernameinput gave back quite some more results than one 
2016-09-17 11:59:21	rgareus	really, it's possible to do with a script.  doing this in core ardour won't happen.
2016-09-17 11:59:26	tom-	rgareus: i don't see anything not reliable in your example
2016-09-17 11:59:35	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Whereas you'd have to loop over the results of the query if you want to filter more
2016-09-17 11:59:43	rgareus	tom-: look harder
2016-09-17 11:59:57	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Or expect Ardour to provide other API that can filter in clever ways
2016-09-17 12:00:03	rgareus	tom-: I also explained it at least twice, re-read the backlog
2016-09-17 12:00:07	 *	rgareus gives up
2016-09-17 12:00:18	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Which screams API bloat to me, esp. since you can do all of that in lua
2016-09-17 12:01:26	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: It's not reliable as a real, stable reference to a port, and since all other existing API are stable reliable references, it would be the odd thing
2016-09-17 12:01:54	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: And users will probably use it thinking they can infer the same reliability promises
2016-09-17 12:02:06	rgareus	_FrnchFrgg_: well said
2016-09-17 12:02:22	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: That's a concern anyway, and you cannot wave it away IMHO
2016-09-17 12:02:46	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: A carefully crafted api name might alleviate that
2016-09-17 12:03:16	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: But you never addressed the question why the increase in API is warranted.
2016-09-17 12:04:05	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Less is more. You can easily add API but not remove it without lengthy deprecation periods
2016-09-17 12:04:40	tom-	a query is totally realiable when it detects that a label has changed
2016-09-17 12:04:42	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: That's the same error we often see in configuration UI: you get a knob for everything

2016-09-17 12:07:39	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: in the turned down methods in my pr, there is nothing smart in place. it just tries to find a plugin port by label
2016-09-17 12:07:57	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: there is no facility to have more than one result
2016-09-17 12:08:03	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: So what does "a query is totally reliable ...." mean ?
2016-09-17 12:08:17	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: you can however check by the return value (boolean) if the query was successful or not
2016-09-17 12:08:37	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Sure, but if it's unsuccessful, now what ?
2016-09-17 12:08:39	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: and if it was successful, you have the value (or the value was set)
2016-09-17 12:09:17	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: are you asking me what to make out of a boolean information?
2016-09-17 12:09:47	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: I'm asking what you are planning to do with that information in your script
2016-09-17 12:09:47	tom-	_FrnchFrgg_: if the port i.e. was not found by label under that name. i would i.e. not try to set a value on it
2016-09-17 12:10:12	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Sure, but then the script doesn't do what the user expects it to
2016-09-17 12:10:51	rgareus	..or if it accidentally finds a port it would set the value
2016-09-17 12:11:03	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: So it's not broken only for a very restricted version of "not broken" that's convenient to your argument but not realistic.
2016-09-17 12:11:43	tom-	rgareus: look at your lua examples. they break in many ways
2016-09-17 12:12:07	tom-	rgareus: because.. they use an index as an id.

2016-09-17 12:13:45	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: The question about index of a plugin in the processor list or a track in the session is completely different
2016-09-17 12:13:50	rgareus	tom-: the latter is used in  'examples' or snippets -- not in released and bundled scripts
2016-09-17 12:14:20	rgareus	and I never said they are "stable" or don't break.  they're example scripts, not an API
2016-09-17 12:14:21	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: And more important, these examples do not break because the API is unreliable IMHO
2016-09-17 12:14:42	rgareus	besides, no bug report is filed, so by definition there's no problem.
2016-09-17 12:14:52	tom-	rgareus: the plugin names have changed.
2016-09-17 12:14:56	tom-	rgareus: a-
2016-09-17 12:15:13	rgareus	tom-: not in a released version
2016-09-17 12:15:17	rgareus	only in git.
2016-09-17 12:15:26	tom-	no idea
2016-09-17 12:15:30	rgareus	but that just prooves the point that lookup by name is not reliable
2016-09-17 12:15:37	rgareus	the URI has not changed
2016-09-17 12:15:44	tom-	and thus it needs to be used in an example
2016-09-17 12:15:52	tom-	to show that actually one should not use it, right?
2016-09-17 12:16:25	tom-	i'm not critizing this. but you need to apply symmetric considerations
2016-09-17 12:16:50	_FrnchFrgg_	rgareus: tom- has a point, maybe the examples should not emphasize loops that search a plugin by name.

2016-09-17 12:17:09	rgareus	yep
2016-09-17 12:17:17	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: Not rock solid API
2016-09-17 12:17:18	rgareus	well, it's a loop
2016-09-17 12:17:29	tom-	it's amazing to see how things get "solved" :)
2016-09-17 12:17:37	tom-	oh.. let's remove all the interesting stuff
2016-09-17 12:18:06	rgareus	just like you can loop and check for a port-name.  currently the loop iterates over plugins and checks the plugin-name in the example script
2016-09-17 12:18:12	tom-	you sould agree that introducing a query mechanism that uses a label to find things is not better or worse than other things in place
2016-09-17 12:18:12	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: And nobody prevents you to write such a loop in lua. rgareus just said he wouldn't promote that to API
2016-09-17 12:18:15	rgareus	not good practice, but for an example, it's fine.
2016-09-17 12:18:24	tom-	it can be coded in a reliable, non-critical way in c++
2016-09-17 12:18:29	rgareus	it's not a libardour API to lookup plugins by name.
2016-09-17 12:19:10	rgareus	tom-: which script actually?
2016-09-17 12:19:12	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: It's worse than looking by uri for LV2 which is a real unique stable id. For VST that's more problematic.
2016-09-17 12:19:35	rgareus	tom-: now that I look   s_plugin_automation.lua  s_pluginutils.lua and  s_replaceplugin.lua  all use URIs
2016-09-17 12:20:42	_FrnchFrgg_	rgareus: Are there examples/snippets that show good practice ? There should be, even if the dirty loops stay as examples (maybe with a warning that it's only for quick solutions)
2016-09-17 12:20:57	_FrnchFrgg_	rgareus: You answered my question
2016-09-17 12:21:11	rgareus	well,  s_pluginutils.lua also has an example  for "4th plugin (from top)"  
2016-09-17 12:22:02	tom-	if you say it's doable in a script and can even be useful, denying to support that in the API is ignorant
2016-09-17 12:22:11	tom-	from my POV
2016-09-17 12:22:11		[12:22]
2016-09-17 12:22:36	tom-	the worst possible outcome of it being in the API has yet to be named

2016-09-17 12:28:01	rgareus	speaking of which, it'd be nice to translate the a-plugins
2016-09-17 12:30:36	tom-	so the worst case would be that a query by name would detect another localization.
2016-09-17 12:32:09	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: And how would you guess the new name ? Because detecting the change isn't enough, the user wants the script to continue doing its stuff...
2016-09-17 12:33:10	_FrnchFrgg_	tom-: And expecting the user to type/choose again is not realistic (if the session goes back and forth between two systems with different locales, it would be hell)

2016-09-17 12:35:31	rgareus	APIs never change, once it's out, it's forever.  only way is to deprecate it and write a new API.
2016-09-17 12:35:32	tom-	the API is not designed at all. it's a mess :)
2016-09-17 12:35:50	tom-	it's not designed around user needs in a scripting context
2016-09-17 12:36:31	tom-	it feels like someone tries to make it as cumersome as possible (in some areas)
2016-09-17 12:36:57	tom-	it's also just exposing what's inside ardour to a big part
2016-09-17 12:37:26	tom-	but what it can do is powerful
2016-09-17 12:37:26		[12:37]
2016-09-17 12:38:16	tom-	and that it popped up in so short time is impressive. but the API itself is not very intuitive imho
2016-09-17 12:39:22	tom-	i could imagine: track("audio1").plugin("foo")[1].set(23)
2016-09-17 12:39:40	tom-	look at how cumbersome it has to be done now
2016-09-17 12:40:32	tom-	not a good example
2016-09-17 12:40:58	tom-	it wasn't so that the api was designed first. it was tried to make an api out of the ardour internals
2016-09-17 12:41:42	tom-	and *that* could be looked at as not the best way to get a user-centric api
2016-09-17 12:41:49	rgareus	Session:get_track_by_name("audio1").get_processor_by_id(ID, type).get_parameter(1).set_parameter(23)   would be nice
