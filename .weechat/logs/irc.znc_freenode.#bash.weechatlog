2016-10-17 14:39:34	kerframil	in point of fact, "yes" is something different than "y". that should be plain enough.

2016-10-17 14:40:01	impermanence	I have an array of ips.  Then I have a script that iterates over the array in groups of 50 and runs an ssh command on each ip in parallel, if that makes sense.  Basically...it runs an ssh command on 50 ips at the same time.  What I notice is, though, is that all of these ssh commands are tied to the same PID.  Is this bad?  I assume it is...

2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:25:31] find ... -print0 | xargs -0 command    is safe [05:25:31]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:25:43] yeah, I know that one [05:25:43]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:25:47] but -0 is not standard, though at least the GNU and BSD implementations have it [05:25:47]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:25:54] aha [05:25:54]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:27:42] I still cannot understand why sometimes you need multiple backslashes on a command [05:27:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:28:25] let's say: printf %b `printf \\\\%03o "$@"` [05:28:25]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:40:01] `` eats a layer of backslashes [05:40:01]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:40:47] while $() does not. One of the reasons why $() is recommended over `` [05:40:47]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:41:17] aha [05:41:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:42:34] still I don't understand why you need so many backslashes, if you want a single backslash, you escape it with another backslash and you're done, no? [05:42:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	 *	tsakos [05:42:54] scratches head [05:42:54]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:43:56] `` eats one, one is used to quote, and printf's format string eats one [05:43:56]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:44:12] printf %b "$(printf '\\%03o' "$@")" [05:44:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:45:42] it works with 3 backslashes [05:45:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:46:04] # printf '\%03o' 32 [05:46:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	shbot	[05:46:05] geirha: \040 [05:46:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:46:19] since \% is not special, it gets unchanged by printf [05:46:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:46:21] I mean with the backquotes etc. [05:46:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:46:27] So   printf %b "$(printf '\%03o' "$@")" [05:46:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:47:10] this prints nothing tome [05:47:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:47:12] to me* [05:47:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:47:35] printf %b "$(printf '\\\%03o' "$@")" [05:47:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:47:39] this one works [05:47:39]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:47:45] Well, with   printf %b `printf \\\\%03o "$@"`   first `` eats its share, turning it into    printf \\%03o ... [05:47:45]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:47:51] weird.. [05:47:51]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:48:10] then regular parsing takes it, turning it into printf \%03o [05:48:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:48:37] and then printf is run with that, and printf doesn't change \% since it's not special [05:48:37]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:49:14] hmm [05:49:14]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:49:52] # printf %s `printf \\\\\\\\` [05:49:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	shbot	[05:49:53] geirha: \ [05:49:53]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:50:24] where can I read on that matter? [05:50:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:50:35] is there any good article on this? [05:50:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:50:41] man bash [05:50:41]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:50:48] ok [05:50:48]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:54:20] The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed  by  one  of the following characters: $, `, ", \, or <newline>. [05:54:20]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:54:34] that means \$ is special for example? [05:54:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:54:58] everything else is well understood, just this part [05:54:58]

2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[09:38:02] enzotib: indeed, it would be faster but then you need a for loop in your bash code i.e. -exec bash -c 'for f; do mv -- "$f" ...; done' _ {} + [09:38:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	enzotib	[09:38:22] uhm, right [09:38:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	geirha	[09:39:19] and   -name '*.uct*' ! -name "*.uct0"   to avoid renaming uct0 to uct0 [09:39:19]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	gryffus	[09:45:13] KnightsWhoSayNi: hmm, the command is taking forever... perhaps it's not a good idea to use globstar on few hundred recursive directories? [09:45:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	gryffus	[09:47:20] KnightsWhoSayNi: also it does not work as intended, it is just adding .uct0 extension to the files [09:47:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[09:49:07] # f="foo.utc"; d="${f%.*}.utc0"; echo "$d" [09:49:07]

2016-10-18 00:14:24	KnightsWhoSayNi	[09:49:31] hmm might be better to use a find instead then... but the parameter expansion should be fine [09:49:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[09:49:35] should be no problem with that. a glob could be slow in this case, though. see !findloop in that case. [09:49:35]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	gryffus	[09:50:07] KnightsWhoSayNi: leaving the hashes i want to remove there [09:50:07]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[09:50:30] !extension > gryffus [09:50:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	greybot	[09:50:30] gryffus: Use parameter expansion: ext=${filename##*.} noext=${filename%.*} [09:50:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[09:51:42] note that {f%.*} will remove the shortest match. so "foo.utc.utc0", say, would become "foo.utc", not "foo" [09:51:42]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[09:52:29] # f="foo.bar.baz"; echo "${f%.*} ${f%%.*}" [09:52:29]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	shbot	[09:52:30] kerframil: foo.bar foo [09:52:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[09:53:19] you'd need the latter to be equivalent to your cut -d example [09:53:19]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[09:57:32] this is similar to your original attempt (without some newbie mistakes): while IFS= read -rd '' f; do mv -- "$f" "${f%%.*}.utc0"; done < <(find -type f -name '*.utc*' -print0) [09:57:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	gryffus	[10:00:04] the problem was that i had 2 dots in file names (which i didn't noticed first)... solved with f% [10:00:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	tsakos	[10:00:19] what exactly does while read line && [ " " "<" "$line" ]; do .... do? [10:00:19]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	gryffus	[10:00:22] but i will sure try advice provided from kerframil ... [10:00:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	gryffus	[10:00:52] s/f%/f% [10:00:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[10:00:57] gryffus: that's explained above. %.* wasn't the same as cut -d'.' -f1 [10:00:57]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[10:01:15] gryffus: in your case, %%.* would do it [10:01:15]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	gryffus	[10:01:35] kerframil: yeah, my irc is stripping double % apparently [10:01:35]

2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[10:04:57] tsakos: < performs a lexical comparison. but that only makes sense within [[ ]]. for example [[ "!" > " " ]] is true, because ! has a higher ordinal number than a space character (33 vs 32). [10:04:57]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	KnightsWhoSayNi	[10:05:36] kerframil: it makes sense with [/test too according to its help page [10:05:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[10:05:43] tsakos: < " " would encompass special control characters. look at an ascii chart, if you don't get it. [10:05:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[10:06:21] KnightsWhoSayNi: yes, but you're looking at the bash built-in. look at the man page for (posix) [ and it's a different story. I realise that bash will permit it anyway. [10:06:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	KnightsWhoSayNi	[10:06:28] ahh i see [10:06:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	gryffus	[10:06:39] kerframil: BTW, why do you add the "--" between rm and its arguments? [10:06:39]

2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[10:09:15] tsakos: in short, it looks like the intention is to break the loop as soon as any line is encountered that begins with a control character [10:09:15]

2016-10-18 02:38:06	greybot	You can't parse structured languages like HTML or XML using bash, grep, sed, cut, etc. Look into xmllint, xmlstarlet, xpath, xsltproc, ... Eg. xmllint --xpath '//person[@name="bob"]/salary/text()' - <<< '<staff><person name="bob"><salary>70000</salary></person></staff>' -- Ask #xml for XPath/XSLT help, that is not a #bash question.

2016-10-18 05:24:54	greybot	Don't use extensions for your scripts. Scripts define new commands that you can run, and commands are generally not given extensions. Do you run ls.elf? Also: bash scripts are *not* sh scripts (so don't use .sh) and the extension will only cause dependencies headaches if the script gets rewritten in another language.

2016-10-18 07:11:06	greycat	Why use bash?  Just write the entire thing in Tcl/expect.

2016-10-18 07:18:32	greycat	If you're reading find output, there *is no* sorting.  find uses raw directory order.  Any appearance of sorting is coincidence.
2016-10-18 07:18:32	Neville	greycat: I tried piping sort -z; yet it did not resolve my desired effect.
2016-10-18 07:18:47	greycat	You'll have to sort the output yourself.  E.g. by piping to sort.
2016-10-18 07:19:06	veleno	greycat: it is a bash script that embeds an expect script.
2016-10-18 07:19:16	greycat	veleno: well, stop doing that.
2016-10-18 07:19:39	greycat	Writing a project in two languages is always awkward, especially if one of them is bash.
2016-10-18 07:20:10	greycat	Tcl is enormously superior to bash, and you've got it for free because expect uses it.

2016-10-18 15:02:18	kerframil	further, it could be that that a standard user is unable to peruse root's processes in Linux (proc mounted with hidepid=[1|2], /proc restrictions in grsecurity, SELinux ... etc), in which case one might get different results depending on whether the script is run as root or not. also, the permissions of the pid file can matter.

2016-10-18 19:37:57	geirha	!$*
2016-10-18 19:37:57	greybot	The difference between $@ and $*: Without quotes (don't do this!), there is no difference. With double quotes, "$@" expands to each positional parameter as its own argument: "$1" "$2" ..., while "$*" expands to the single argument "$1c$2c...", where 'c' is the first character of IFS. You almost always want "$@" (QUOTED!). The same goes for arrays: "${array[@]}".

2016-10-18 19:39:44	tsakos	basically I'm doing a simple argument parser, so I do something like this: arg_parse "arguments_expected_syntax" "arguments"

2016-10-18 23:55:23	jeffreylevesque	[04:18:12] so, basically when my vm builds, i mount my source directory [04:18:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	jeffreylevesque	[04:18:21] then the inotifywait services are started [04:18:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	jeffreylevesque	[04:18:31] then i `touch` all the files, that should be watched [04:18:31]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	jeffreylevesque	[04:18:47] out of the 4 services i have, only one stops working after the touch [04:18:47]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	jeffreylevesque	[04:19:07] and requires that i reboot the entire vm, then it works endlessly [04:19:07]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	jeffreylevesque	[04:19:10] is that weird? [04:19:10]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	jeffreylevesque	[04:25:59] anyone here use puppetserver / foreman? [04:25:59]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	jeffreylevesque	[04:26:04] whoops wrong channel [04:26:04]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Sumset	[04:57:33] Thanks I solved it with: sed 's/^{\[\(.*\)\],\[.*\]}./\1/' <<< '{['item1','item2'],['item1','item2']}.' | awk -F ',' '{print NF}' [04:57:33]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:32:18] Hey guys, I is it safe to pass parameters into a function? [05:32:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:32:37] do I need to check something beforing passing them? [05:32:37]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:33:08] I mean every parameter the script was executed with [05:33:08]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:33:18] $* in this case [05:33:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	geirha	[05:37:32] $* is always wrong [05:37:32]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:37:51] Well, I don't really know the difference between $* and $@ [05:37:51]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	geirha	[05:37:57] !$* [05:37:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	greybot	[05:37:57] The difference between $@ and $*: Without quotes (don't do this!), there is no difference. With double quotes, "$@" expands to each positional parameter as its own argument: "$1" "$2" ..., while "$*" expands to the single argument "$1c$2c...", where 'c' is the first character of IFS. You almost always want "$@" (QUOTED!). The same goes for arrays: "${array[@]}". [05:37:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:38:52] hm, so I want to have arguments sent as positional parameters... right [05:38:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:39:44] basically I'm doing a simple argument parser, so I do something like this: arg_parse "arguments_expected_syntax" "arguments" [05:39:44]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:40:33] I'm doing it because I want multiple options into arguments [05:40:33]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	geirha	[05:42:13] not sure what you mean by that [05:42:13]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:42:27] for example --move file1 file2 [05:42:27]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:42:57] also want to have long as well as short arguments [05:42:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	A124	[05:46:40] Hey. What is the best way to iterate pairs of arguments in loop? [05:46:40]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	A124	[05:47:35] args="a b c d e f"; ... iterate on: a b, c d, e f [05:47:35]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:48:00] do whatever with $1 (echo, if test, etc) and shift [05:48:00]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	geirha	[05:48:13] make up your mind, do you want to iterate arguments, or words in a string? [05:48:13]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	A124	[05:50:43] Arguments. [05:50:43]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	geirha	[05:50:43] tsakos: Ok, so a loop like in faq 35 should suffice [05:50:43]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	geirha	[05:51:05] while (( $# > 0 )); do printf '%s %s\n' "$1" "$2"; shift 2; done [05:51:05]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	A124	[05:52:10] Nice. built-in. [05:52:10]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	A124	[05:52:12] Thank you. [05:52:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[06:12:25] geirha: what you think about checking an array for existance with ${#myarray[@]} when not even set? [06:12:25]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[06:13:23] returns 0, no error at all, so I think it's cool, right? [06:13:23]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[06:14:12] if [ ${#myarray[@]} -ne 0 ]; then fill array.. [06:14:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[06:14:24] s/ne/eq/ [06:14:24]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	geirha	[07:17:07] tsakos: and if it's empty, what then? [07:17:07]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	pennTeller	[07:30:36] Hi guys, can anybody recommend a script that uploads a folder of pictures to Facebook? [07:30:36]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Stummi	[07:31:38] pennTeller, a quick search for facebook in my package manager shows that theres a python implementation for FB's API. Maybe you can make use of this [07:31:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	geirha	[07:31:39] Can't you just drag and drop it? [07:31:39]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	pennTeller	[07:33:31] Stummi,  thanks a lot I will search for that [07:33:31]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	pennTeller	[07:33:59] geirha, yes you can but I am making a program in python where you can take a picture and save it to  folder that uploads to Facebook every few minuts [07:33:59]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	alxtb	[08:12:34] Hi, what's wrong with this for loop: for (( i=$numlines); i>0; i-- )) - I get unexpected operatior "=" as the error [08:12:34]

2016-10-19 00:49:59	Muyfret	another script that would be nice is to snatch up all desktop files of an extension (like .txt) and quickly stuff them in a folder. then encrypt the folder. there are times i have to spend like 15 minutes cleaning up my desktop so it's appropriate and safe to show others
2016-10-19 00:50:52	geirha	then surely you should encrypt the jpegs and mpegs first

2016-10-19 00:57:10	Toeie	Hi. I have a script that downloads a video and then loops it using mplayer. It downloads the new video if a newer one is available. I was thinking about running this script on boot, and use a cronjob to reboot the system every day. So basically the boot script would be > download video > play using mplayer (loop infinite) > cron reboots every night
2016-10-19 00:57:22	Toeie	Would that be a good idea?
2016-10-19 00:57:31	HaZrD	why reboot every night?

2016-10-19 01:09:13	Toeie	I think I will have to add like a last-updated string or something, that i also save on the system, and just compare everytime the script runs

2016-10-19 02:53:23	Muyfret	anyone know what open office and google names their document files extensions?
2016-10-19 02:53:43	Vonor|Work	would you suggest this solution to rsync? the goal is to rsync an entire project (4.7 TB in round about 13 million files) to another server. the io overhead produced by rsync opening, reading, transferring all these small files is too huge for one single sync. the network can handle more
2016-10-19 02:53:52	geirha	Muyfret: Wrong channel
2016-10-19 02:54:40	Vonor|Work	so the idea was to cd into the folder with all the data dirs (255 subfolders) and rsync them in parallel with this script
2016-10-19 02:55:10	HaZrD	Vonor|Work will the receiving server be able to cope with writing 255 syncs at once?
2016-10-19 02:55:10		[02:55]
2016-10-19 02:55:14	geirha	If it's IO bound, it probably won't go much faster in parallel, but go ahead and try
2016-10-19 02:55:36	Vonor|Work	HaZrD, not 255 syncs, 3 syncs in parallel
2016-10-19 02:56:15	HaZrD	as geirha says, it's worth a try ;)
2016-10-19 02:56:50	Vonor|Work	a did a smaller round earlier. around 920 mb were rsynced in about 2 and a half minute. so if my math isn't totally wrong that would mean 9 days for the 4.7 tb

2016-10-19 05:39:27	korans	djoularef: text editor? else sed can be useful but you cant use the file your using for input as a place to write outbut so you have to make the new file and replace the old, not sure if bash has a pure bash way to do such a thing you could try looping with readline although thats gunna be more expensive than sed i would imagine
2016-10-19 05:40:29	greycat	another approach is to write a very small patch, and use patch(1)

2016-10-19 06:05:24	greycat	To iterate arguments, you use "for arg" or any other variable name you wish.

2016-10-19 08:54:14	greybot	Bash is a shell. That's a program which can do simple math, logic, I/O and run other programs. It's NOT a terminal, it's not a kernel, it doesn't manage the system's authentication or environment, it's not your OS and it's not X, KDE or Gnome.

2016-10-19 09:14:54	guardian	what's an efficient way to find all files named "*.foo" that contain the pattern "bar". I would find | xargs grep but I'm not sure it's the way to go
2016-10-19 09:15:18	guardian	well not that I crave for performance, I'm trying to slowly absorb what a seasoned bash user would write
2016-10-19 09:15:34	geirha	find ... -exec grep ... {} +
2016-10-19 09:15:51	geirha	!xargs
2016-10-19 09:15:51	greybot	xargs(1) is dangerous (broken, exploitable, etc.) when reading non-NUL-delimited input. If you're working with filenames, use find's -exec [command] {} + instead. If you can get NUL-delimited output, use xargs -0. Otherwise, you probably want a while read or for loop instead.

2016-10-19 10:08:20	it2w_	hey,  0 down vote favorite I am trying to write a script to detect whenever a file is added to a specific folder and run a command using the last file added name. What I am specifically trying to do is to create a QR code for each file I add in a specific folder.  So what I would need to do is: Detect when a file is added to folder, grab base filename and pass to qrencode -o basename.png mysite.com/basename.ext
2016-10-19 10:08:44	greycat	If this is on linux, look at the linux specific montoring stuff.
2016-10-19 10:08:47	greycat	!inotify
2016-10-19 10:08:47	greybot	inotifywait is a shell interface to the Linux inotify API for filesystem events. inotifywait isn't safe for robust scripts because it can't output nul delimiters. Better cross-platform alternatives are watchdog (python) and System.IO.FileSystemWatcher (mono/.NET) which both support inotify, kqueue, Windows fs events, etc. https://github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools/

2016-10-19 14:34:40	Riviera	[00:12:50] Is that description supposed to descibe one element or what? [00:12:50]

2016-10-19 14:34:40	Gorian	[00:16:25] I swear, working with quotes is also one of the biggest pains in the ass.... [00:16:25]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	Gorian	[00:16:31] *always [00:16:31]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	kerframil	[00:16:35] are $pbgroups $new_groups supposed to be passed as two distinct arguments to the application in question? [00:16:35]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	yitz	[00:16:41] new_groups=$(echo "${new_groups} ${oldg}"); arguments=("${new_groups}") [00:16:41]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	Gorian	[00:16:49] so [00:16:49]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	yitz	[00:16:51] ^ that's your bug [00:16:51]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	Gorian	[00:16:58] powerbroke doesn't have a config file, it has a command [00:16:58]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	Gorian	[00:17:13] and you have to pass ALL AD groups to be given access, and it just overwrites them [00:17:13]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	yitz	[00:17:33] new_groups+=( "$oldg" ); ... ${PB_BIN_CONFIG} RequireMembershipOf "${new_groups[@]}" [00:17:33]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	Gorian	[00:17:44] so, it's taking the existing groups, adding the new groups you passed in an argument, and then passing all of them as distinct quoted arguments to the configuration binary [00:17:44]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	yitz	[00:17:54] !quotewhen > Also Gorian [00:17:54]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	greybot	[00:17:54] Also Gorian: "Double quote" every literal that contains spaces/metacharacters and _every_ expansion: "$var", "$(command "$var")", "${array[@]}", "a & b". Use 'single quotes' for code or literal $'s: 'Costs $5 US', ssh host 'echo "$HOSTNAME"'.

2016-10-19 14:34:40	Gorian	[00:18:27] yitz: didn't know about the += in bash, thanks :) [00:18:27]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	yitz	[00:18:50] Gorian: alternatively:  new_groups=( "${new_groups[@]}" "$oldg" ); ... ${PB_BIN_CONFIG} RequireMembershipOf "${new_groups[@]}" [00:18:50]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	Gorian	[00:26:19] yitz: http://pastebin.com/raw/ryvLzSG3 [00:26:19]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	yitz	[00:27:49] So your input is wrapped in quotes which you want to drop? [00:27:49]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	yitz	[00:29:01] echo "$@" | sed 's/\\/\\\\/g'   ===>    sed 's/\\/\\\\/g' <<< "$*" [00:29:01]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	yitz	[00:30:09] Gorian: If you're running it through sed already, you can drop "s. Or you can use a PE [00:30:09]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	Gorian	[00:31:41] yeah, I sed'd off the quotes, but it still quotes the backslashes [00:31:41]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	Gorian	[00:31:56] so it actuall passes "corp\\\\world.<group>" [00:31:56]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	yitz	[00:33:01] You also got a sed expression altering the number of \s in there [00:33:01]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	yitz	[00:33:16] sed 's/\\/\\\\/g' [00:33:16]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	Gorian	[00:33:18] bah, I'm getting tired to do this, but i want to get it working before i go home *sigh* [00:33:18]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	yitz	[00:33:28] Are you adding more than you need than having issues with the extras? [00:33:28]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	Gorian	[00:33:35] but, not in add [00:33:35]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	Gorian	[00:33:39] not for pbgroups [00:33:39]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	yitz	[00:33:48] new_groups=$(echo "$@" | sed 's/\\/\\\\/g'); [00:33:48]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	Gorian	[00:34:08] yes, but the problem in the existing grops [00:34:08]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	Gorian	[00:34:12] *groups [00:34:12]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	Gorian	[00:34:29] which is gets as "corp\\world.<group>" [00:34:29]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	yitz	[00:34:30] Sure? I don't know what's happening in there. You may need to tweak the output of $PB_BIN_CONFIG [00:34:30]

2016-10-20 00:25:34	arko_	[10:10:53] Hi! I am playing several video's using omxplayer - this works well, however theres a 0.5s gap between the video's because of the player restarting. After a lot of googling this seems hard to solve, so I'm looking for other ways to fix this. Is there any possibility to display a image fullscreen between the video's, so you won't see the desktop and terminal window? [10:10:53]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	geirha	[10:11:39] wrong channel [10:11:39]

2016-10-20 00:25:34	Soliton	[10:13:36] or some ascii art in the terminal. [10:13:36]

2016-10-20 00:25:34	izalove	[10:14:17] what's the problem? [10:14:17]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	arko_	[10:16:00] It only plays the first video, and then just quits the player. Not playing the second one. [10:16:00]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	izalove	[10:16:45] ok, then use    <whatever command you're using now> & exit [10:16:45]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	arko_	[10:17:35] I don't get what you're trying to say - how would exit help me here? [10:17:35]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	izalove	[10:17:52] it closes the terminal [10:17:52]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	Soliton	[10:18:38] looks like oxmplayer supports streaming so stream it the videos. [10:18:38]

2016-10-20 00:38:31	manday	I have the problem that my wayland compositor (sway) runs in setuid and therefore discards LD_LIBRARY_PATH. In order for sway to run a command which needs an LD_LIBRARY_PATH, I need to wrap this command in "env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=...". How can define a function "run_X()" in my .bashrc which functionally binds LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the effect that executing it will use the old value?   Something like   run_X() { env
2016-10-20 00:38:34	manday	LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" X }    , when run by sway, does use the current LD_LIBRARY_PATH

If they don't terminate instantly, that's because they're busy cleaning up. If you interrupt them, you break them.

2016-10-20 04:11:01	Eryn_1983_FL	yeah ill talk to them
2016-10-20 04:11:48	osse	for bash specific things, you can use $(< file) instead of $(cat file) to read a file.
2016-10-20 04:12:15	osse	$release_number is unquoted. likely not a problem given the name.  not sure what the perl thing does but it's probably overkill.

2016-10-20 14:18:45	syba_web	what do you reckon is the best *nix tool or method to do this: i have a lot of log files, that have filenames like this : 2015_11_ircblahblahblah ... so this is a file for november. And then in one such file, each line will start something like: 2015-11-30 19:53:21     . Heres the problem though. These files actually go beyond 2015/11, and could have lines starting 2015-12-03 22:01:29  or whatever.

2016-10-20 14:20:45	syba_web	and prefererably give them some decent names, but i mean i can do all the file-renaming by hand instead, the importand thing is to loop over some files in a dir, and try to split them where each line starts with a specific month...

2016-10-21 01:09:19	geirha	the expansion of $GUESSED probably contains sed metacharacters
2016-10-21 01:09:28	jmtorresg	but when I run it in a terminal as a command after creating the variables I dont get any errors whatsoever

2016-10-21 01:10:19	geirha	put set -x on the line before to see what's going on
2016-10-21 01:10:28	geirha	!-x
2016-10-21 01:10:28	greybot	set -x (or ''bash -x myscript'') makes bash output the exact command that it will run after parsing and expansion. You can put ''set -x'' just before the code you want to debug (turn off with ''set +x''). To add more information, change PS4 first: eg. PS4='+($?) $BASH_SOURCE:$FUNCNAME:$LINENO:'
2016-10-21 01:10:32	jmtorresg	is a void variable considered as a metacharacter?
2016-10-21 01:10:56	jmtorresg	because the command is in a loop GUESSED doesn't contain anything through the first iteration
2016-10-21 01:11:07	geirha	[^] is not valid
2016-10-21 01:11:23	geirha	# sed 's/[^]//'

2016-10-21 01:12:23	geirha	in this case, you could use bash or tr instead

Note that foo and bar are executed in subshells; so changing variables inside pipes will have no effect on the variables in your main script.

2016-10-21 11:32:18	mrrhq	Because that's what I see it being the most useful for.
2016-10-21 11:32:55	mrrhq	Perl could replace tee, tr, awk, grep, sed, all of that and more if it wanted to.
2016-10-21 11:33:12	sjohnson	ormaaj: that sounds like a cool idea.
2016-10-21 11:33:15	mrrhq	Maybe not tee.

2016-10-21 11:33:35	sjohnson	mrrhq: perl has awk's splitting by whitespace with ' ', so i'd say it's very easy in perl.
2016-10-21 11:33:53	sjohnson	mrrhq: it can replace tee.
2016-10-21 11:34:06	sjohnson	i mean, i wouldn't bother doing it, but it's certainly possible.
2016-10-21 11:34:30	mrrhq	Isn't tee just a program that does pipelining?
2016-10-21 11:34:35	mrrhq	It's pretty simple.
2016-10-21 11:34:51	sjohnson	all it would have to do is write to a file and print to stdout too.
2016-10-21 11:36:25	yitz	pipelining?
2016-10-21 11:36:25		[11:36]
2016-10-21 11:36:28	sjohnson	it wouldn't be as fast as a C utility written for you already by any stretch though.
2016-10-21 11:37:01	yitz	sjohnson: a loop that reads STDIN and writes out to multiple handles would be pretty fast in any language
2016-10-21 11:37:50	sjohnson	if you profiled it with extreme tests, C would surely be faster by a long shot.

2016-10-21 15:46:18	checkbot	bob-2: I think the problem is on line 97. Double quote array expansions to avoid re-splitting elements. (44 issue(s) found by http://shellcheck.net ).

2016-10-21 15:48:19	bob-2	so its like the piping of output is affecting the functioning of the commands

2016-10-22 00:03:22	alfatau	hello all. I've 2 different commands where one outputs lines that contains <ID> <SIZE> and the other outputs lines that contains <ID> <NAME>. I would like to join lines based on matches on <ID> field such that the final output is <ID> <NAME> <SIZE>. Is there some command that helps to process 2 outputs/files together? Thank you for you attention.

2016-10-22 09:45:15	roasted	I'm trying to make my backup script a little bit better. Only problem I'm having is even when the backup errors out (drive is currently full), it still says "backup complete" when I want it to say "backup failed" Anybody got any pointers? http://paste.ubuntu.com/23366029/

2016-10-22 21:14:09	greybot	By convention, environment variables (PATH, EDITOR, SHELL, ...) and internal shell variables (BASH_VERSION, RANDOM, ...) are fully capitalized. All other variable names should be lowercase. Since variable names are case-sensitive, this convention avoids accidentally overriding environmental and internal variables.

2016-10-22 21:14:18	greybot	The backquote (`) is used in the old-style command substitution, e.g. foo=`command`. The foo=$(command) syntax is recommended instead. Backslash handling inside $() is less surprising, and $() is easier to nest. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/082

When I expand those vars using echo, they expand fine, but when I try to do something like "cd $var" it says that the directory does not exist.

2016-10-22 23:04:28	mrrhq	bashrc also counts as a shell script, since it's run by bash.
2016-10-22 23:04:44	AppAraat	ah because of subshells, right? In that case sourcing would fix that behavior?

2016-10-23 01:55:40	greybot	Saying something "doesn't work" helps neither you or us. Explain the result you *want* or *expect*, what you are *doing* and *how* it is failing. Copy/paste the commands you use and the errors they produce. Consider set -x to get more information on what is happening.
2016-10-23 01:58:29	TyrfingMjolnir	Riviera: I expect the command to run the same way when run inside a script.

2016-10-23 19:52:37	DaVu	ah, no...that´s not correct...wait a mom
2016-10-23 19:52:53	AppAraat	yeah {} expands find results
2016-10-23 19:53:36	pj	other way around: -exec mv {} /path/to/destination/
2016-10-23 19:53:56	AppAraat	but the problem is that even if you do "-exec mv {} /path/to/location/ +;" it contains special characters (such as spaces) and as such doesn't work
2016-10-23 19:54:05	izalove	AppAraat: wrong
2016-10-23 19:54:05		[19:54]
2016-10-23 19:54:10	pj	but that's not hte best way either ...
2016-10-23 19:54:10	izalove	that would work
2016-10-23 19:54:19	AppAraat	ok well I'll try again then
2016-10-23 19:54:23	izalove	but you can't use {} + in that case
2016-10-23 19:54:33	izalove	they need to be consecutive arguments
2016-10-23 19:54:44	izalove	you want   -exec mv -t /path/to/location {} +
2016-10-23 19:54:48	pj	other way around: -exec mv -t /path/to/destination/ {} +
2016-10-23 19:54:54	izalove	or  -exec mv {} /path/to/location \;
2016-10-23 19:55:07	AppAraat	find: missing argument to `-exec'
2016-10-23 19:55:30	AppAraat	ok wait I'm going to try all of your suggestions
2016-10-23 19:55:33	pj	AppAraat: that is not helpful without showing the actual command you used.
2016-10-23 19:55:43	AppAraat	right, working on that
2016-10-23 19:55:46	izalove	she used find ... -exec mv {} /path +
2016-10-23 19:55:56	pj	ahhh, that won't work
2016-10-23 19:56:10	pj	I thought she might have left the \; or + off the end
2016-10-23 19:58:06	AppAraat	oh hmm, I thought it was the other way around because of this primarily - http://stackoverflow.com/q/6085156
2016-10-23 19:58:39	AppAraat	"But if you use a plus sign instead (find . -exec ls '{}' \+), all filenames will be passed as arguments to a single command:" ls file1 file2 file3
2016-10-23 19:59:07	pj	yeah, but for that to work with mv you have to use the -t option for the destination.
2016-10-23 19:59:17	AppAraat	ooooh
2016-10-23 19:59:21	AppAraat	TIL
2016-10-23 19:59:25	pj	and put the destination first.
2016-10-23 19:59:50	pj	also it's not necessary to quote {} or +
2016-10-23 20:01:14	AppAraat	oh damn, I see it now in mv's manpage. If there are multiple sources then dest has to come as first argument after the -t flag "mv [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE..."

Also: bash scripts are *not* sh scripts (so don't use .sh) and the extension will only cause dependencies headaches if the script gets rewritten in another language.

2016-10-24 05:00:19	greycat	!$@
2016-10-24 05:00:20	greybot	The difference between $@ and $*: Without quotes (don't do this!), there is no difference. With double quotes, "$@" expands to each positional parameter as its own argument: "$1" "$2" ..., while "$*" expands to the single argument "$1c$2c...", where 'c' is the first character of IFS. You almost always want "$@" (QUOTED!). The same goes for arrays: "${array[@]}".

2016-10-24 05:07:39	geirha	the verbose messages are probably written on stderr

2016-10-24 05:08:02	Ducky^	so the command appears to be working
2016-10-24 05:08:02	geirha	it doesn't make much sense to capture the output of nc -zv

2016-10-24 06:35:40	TomyWork	greycat maybe sub-sub-directories and such in some cases?
2016-10-24 06:36:16	TomyWork	anyway, nostrora take a look at "shopt -s globstar" mode and at the "xargs" tool
2016-10-24 06:36:19	TomyWork	!globstar
2016-10-24 06:36:19	greybot	In bash 4, when the globstar shell option is enabled ( shopt -s globstar ), the glob ** expands to all files and directories found recursively under the current directory, and **/ to all directories. Combinations like foo/**/*.txt work, but **.txt and foo** do not.
2016-10-24 06:36:20	dualbus	nostrora: are you aware of the issue of treating lines as filenames? either your script will be wrong, or you'll end up with and incredibly complex script
2016-10-24 06:36:22	greycat	I'd rather hear nostrora's guesses than third party guesses.
2016-10-24 06:36:23	TomyWork	!xargs
2016-10-24 06:36:23	greybot	xargs(1) is dangerous (broken, exploitable, etc.) when reading non-NUL-delimited input. If you're working with filenames, use find's -exec [command] {} + instead. If you can get NUL-delimited output, use xargs -0. Otherwise, you probably want a while read or for loop instead.
2016-10-24 06:36:24	dualbus	just to workaround that
2016-10-24 06:36:46	TomyWork	oooor exec if you're into finger breaking

2016-10-24 10:34:50	greycat	Not a bash qustion, but you could kill the local ssh, either directly by PID, or by issuing the ssh escape and kill sequence.
2016-10-24 10:35:08	twkm	as long as you aren't root you can run ''kill -1 -1'' on the pi.

2016-10-24 10:35:11	greycat	It's *cleaner* to logout of each system instead of making ssh feel all abandoned.

2016-10-24 19:26:47	Aelius	say I wanted to create a shim for a program (dmenu). I create a script that runs "/usr/bin/dmenu <mycustomargs> $@"
2016-10-24 19:27:04	Aelius	but is $@, or $* more proper?
2016-10-24 19:27:23	geirha	They're both wrong
2016-10-24 19:27:28	geirha	You want "$@"
2016-10-24 19:27:44	Aelius	that was my next question :)
2016-10-24 19:27:45	Aelius	thanks
2016-10-24 19:27:51	Aelius	could you elaborate why?
2016-10-24 19:27:59	Aelius	@ vs * and quotation
2016-10-24 19:28:03	geirha	!$@
2016-10-24 19:28:03	greybot	The difference between $@ and $*: Without quotes (don't do this!), there is no difference. With double quotes, "$@" expands to each positional parameter as its own argument: "$1" "$2" ..., while "$*" expands to the single argument "$1c$2c...", where 'c' is the first character of IFS. You almost always want "$@" (QUOTED!). The same goes for arrays: "${array[@]}".

2016-10-24 19:29:53	geirha	Without quotes, you get the equivalent of   $1 $2 $3 $4  in both cases. Each of the arguments will be split into words and then pathname expansion is attempted on the result, potentially replacing some of the words with matching filenames
2016-10-24 19:30:16	geirha	you quote to prevent word-splitting and pathname expansion from happening on the result

2016-10-25 01:29:30	timwis	So this is the first time I'm publishing a bash script... my thought is that I'd recommend people clone the repo and then symlink the main file from their ~/bin/, assuming ~/bin/ is available on their PATH. Is that typical advice?
2016-10-25 01:29:51	timwis	if so i can recommend the install be: git clone url-to-repo.git ~/.md2gd

2016-10-25 01:30:07	KnightsWhoSayNi	you can either install it to /usr/local/bin with root privileges, or you can add it to ~/.bin like you said and ask them to add it to their PATH and shell initialisation flies
2016-10-25 01:30:40	KnightsWhoSayNi	or you can simply give them the script and get them to execute it as they see fit, lots of ways really
2016-10-25 01:30:57	timwis	yeah, but in the latter i wouldn't know how to reference the template file from within the script

2016-10-25 01:57:23	greybot	RahulAN first off, don't use ls: DO NOT USE ls' output for anything. ls is a tool for interactively looking at directory metadata. Any attempts at parsing ls' output with code are broken. Globs are much more simple AND correct: ''for file in *.txt''. Read http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs

2016-10-25 04:42:39	bwlang	is is possible to set up a process substitution, store the file in a variable and use it later in a script? something like: e.g. cmd=<($commandstring); psql -d foo -f $cmd
2016-10-25 04:43:10	greycat	What do you mean, "store the file in a variable"?
2016-10-25 04:43:55	bwlang	greycat - like a pointer to the file…
2016-10-25 04:44:03	bwlang	and only start reading later.
2016-10-25 04:44:10	greycat	psql -d foo -f <("${cmdarray[@]}")
2016-10-25 04:44:35	greycat	And even that's overkill, if you don't *really* need a dynamically constructed feeder command array.
2016-10-25 04:45:00	greycat	What is this command, and why do you believe it has to be constructed dynamically?
2016-10-25 04:45:34	bwlang	yea - it’s just awkward beacuse i want it in the middle of a bunch of other commands; I’ll put up a pastie: http://pastebin.ca/3732728

2016-10-25 04:46:17	greycat	So it's NOT dynamic?  It's just large and ugly?  Use a function.
2016-10-25 04:46:31	greycat	fugly() { ...; } ; ... ; psql -d -f <(fugly)
2016-10-25 04:47:11	bwlang	ah - i see - that’s cleaner  I’ll try it.

2016-10-25 05:33:32	-->	sujeet (~sujeet@unaffiliated/freeboson) has joined #bash
2016-10-25 05:33:48	greycat	And yeah, the slow but simple   for x in *; do cat "$x"; done   solution is acceptable if speed isn't important.
2016-10-25 05:33:48	osse	greycat: I was thinking printf '%s\0' glob | xargs -0, which I don't think has serious issues except for portability. I guess the latter is why it's not mentioned in the FAQ.
2016-10-25 05:33:55	Tanta	I would write the commands at command-lists into a group of files, and name them programmatically and then use them as stdin to gnu parallel
2016-10-25 05:34:13	greycat	osse: yes, that's acceptable
2016-10-25 05:34:15	Tanta	that's the method I used in my parallel script a few years ago
2016-10-25 05:34:54	dualbus	except that no one is talking about running parallel cats here
2016-10-25 05:35:07	timvisher	so i thought that `-print0 | xargs -0` was relatively safe. is this not the case?
2016-10-25 05:35:17	dualbus	yeah, that one is good too
2016-10-25 05:35:17		[05:35]
2016-10-25 05:35:18	timvisher	considering that null is forbidden from filenames?
2016-10-25 05:35:19	greycat	timvisher: that is safe
2016-10-25 05:35:31	timvisher	oh so why not use that to chunk the cats then?
2016-10-25 05:35:40	dualbus	but if you're using find already, you might as well use -exec cat {} +
2016-10-25 05:35:42	osse	timvisher: because you can use -exec cat {} + instead
2016-10-25 05:35:50	greycat	timvisher: osse already gave this solution, and it's acceptable if you have GNU xargs
2016-10-25 05:35:54	emg	and that does argument length automagically!
2016-10-25 05:35:58	timvisher	i guess cat just doesn't cost enough to be worth chunking
2016-10-25 05:36:18	osse	timvisher: -exec + already does the "chunking"
2016-10-25 05:36:20	timvisher	greycat: yeah i just wanted to make sure i understood what was being rejected about xargs
2016-10-25 05:36:20	osse	-exec \; doesnæt
2016-10-25 05:36:21	greycat	He said he was using a glob, NOT a find.
2016-10-25 05:36:24	timvisher	ah
2016-10-25 05:36:28	dualbus	unless you need some sort of deterministic order, because find does what? order of added to directory?
2016-10-25 05:36:32	greycat	!xargs
2016-10-25 05:36:33	greybot	xargs(1) is dangerous (broken, exploitable, etc.) when reading non-NUL-delimited input. If you're working with filenames, use find's -exec [command] {} + instead. If you can get NUL-delimited output, use xargs -0. Otherwise, you probably want a while read or for loop instead.
2016-10-25 05:36:40	dualbus	it's not lexicographically sorted
2016-10-25 05:36:49	timvisher	right. i forgot what `+` meant there
2016-10-25 05:37:03	greycat	find recurses, unless you use GNU extensions or extreme -prune trickery

2016-10-25 12:40:58	lgc_	Hi. Why is the output from 'sort -un' different from 'sort -n | uniq'?
2016-10-25 12:41:07	kurahaupo	wallbroken: are we any closer to understanding? The shell processes redirections before the command starts, so the command never sees the text that formed the redirection. The "[" command works with strings (but if you ask nicely using -eq, -ge etc it will treat those strings as numbers). The $((expression)) expansion works with numbers, and can do comparisons the same way that C does.

2016-10-25 12:41:11	stacks88	nice kurahaupo that seemed to work, the new while IFS line you gave, now with continue its going to the next item, so thanks
2016-10-25 12:41:29	kurahaupo	lgc_: sort considers "the same number", whereas uniq considers "the whole line"

2016-10-25 12:43:05	kurahaupo	lgc_: sort -u will consider lines to be "the same" if their keys match. By default sort treats the whole line as one key, but if you use "-n" it only looks at the leading digits.
2016-10-25 12:44:00	wallbroken	";" at the end of the command, is redundant?
2016-10-25 12:44:05	kurahaupo	lgc_: having decided that they're the "same", and you've used "-u", it will suppress output of the second and subsequent "same" lines
2016-10-25 12:44:32	kurahaupo	wallbroken: it can be omitted on the ends of lines and before )

2016-10-25 12:48:23	cjwelborn	I was looking at an example completion script and found this weird test using @(thing|other_thing). I see what it's doing, but what do you call it? I can't google for it. The test was: `[[ ${COMP_LINE} == *" "@(-X|--package-names)* ]]` at https://devmanual.gentoo.org/tasks-reference/completion/index.html
2016-10-25 12:48:23		[12:48]
2016-10-25 12:48:42	kurahaupo	lgc_: which version of sort are you using? In theory it should do a last-resort comparison of the whole line
2016-10-25 12:48:47	lgc_	So a more rigorous comparison would be 'sort -unk1,2', kurahaupo. Wouldn't it?
2016-10-25 12:50:08	kurahaupo	lgc_: that's actually the opposite; that's explicitly saying you only want the first two fields compared, not the whole line. sort -k1,1n -k1 -u # should explicitly compare the whole lines as a fallback

2016-10-25 13:49:46	lgc_	[22:42:03] kurahaupo: I don't think I got that. :( . [22:42:03]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	kurahaupo	[22:43:05] lgc_: sort -u will consider lines to be "the same" if their keys match. By default sort treats the whole line as one key, but if you use "-n" it only looks at the leading digits. [22:43:05]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	wallbroken	[22:44:00] ";" at the end of the command, is redundant? [22:44:00]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	kurahaupo	[22:44:05] lgc_: having decided that they're the "same", and you've used "-u", it will suppress output of the second and subsequent "same" lines [22:44:05]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	kurahaupo	[22:44:32] wallbroken: it can be omitted on the ends of lines and before ) [22:44:32]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	kurahaupo	[22:45:06] wallbroken: which is your native language? [22:45:06]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	wallbroken	[22:45:14] italian [22:45:14]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	lgc_	[22:46:06] kurahaupo: Then "1.001 .001" will be the same as "1.001 0.002"? [22:46:06]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	kurahaupo	[22:47:10] lgc_: I expect so, yes. They both begin with "1" [22:47:10]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	cjwelborn	[22:48:23] I was looking at an example completion script and found this weird test using @(thing|other_thing). I see what it's doing, but what do you call it? I can't google for it. The test was: `[[ ${COMP_LINE} == *" "@(-X|--package-names)* ]]` at https://devmanual.gentoo.org/tasks-reference/completion/index.html [22:48:23]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	kurahaupo	[22:48:42] lgc_: which version of sort are you using? In theory it should do a last-resort comparison of the whole line [22:48:42]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	lgc_	[22:48:47] So a more rigorous comparison would be 'sort -unk1,2', kurahaupo. Wouldn't it? [22:48:47]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	kurahaupo	[22:50:08] lgc_: that's actually the opposite; that's explicitly saying you only want the first two fields compared, not the whole line. sort -k1,1n -k1 -u # should explicitly compare the whole lines as a fallback [22:50:08]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	lgc_	[22:52:24] You mean 'sort -unk1,N', where 'N' is the field count, kurahaupo? [22:52:24]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	izalove	[22:52:25] i need to find scripts that contain binary data that's been appeneded to them [22:52:25]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	izalove	[22:52:55] i thought shar archives did that but apparently they don't [22:52:55]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	cjwelborn	[22:52:58] I was hoping to find some documentation on this `@(this|that)` syntax for tests. It works like I expected, but I've never seen it before. It's not in the man pages, and it's not "googleable". [22:52:58]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	izalove	[22:53:04] but i'm sure i've seen this somewhere [22:53:04]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	izalove	[22:53:11] !extglob > cjwelborn [22:53:11]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	greybot	[22:53:11] cjwelborn: "Extended globs" (shopt -s extglob) allow you to say things like "all files that do not end in .jpg". See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/glob#extglob [22:53:11]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	cjwelborn	[22:53:21] izalove: thanks :) [22:53:21]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	izalove	[22:53:51] anyway if someone can point out some install script or something that unpacks itself, i'd be grateful [22:53:51]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	twkm	[22:55:12] makeself? [22:55:12]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	izalove	[22:55:28] i'll look it up, thanks [22:55:28]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	kurahaupo	[22:56:10] lgc_: almost; it's -kA,B where A & B are field numbers, first and last [22:56:10]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	lgc_	[22:56:54] OK, kurahaupo. Thanks a lot. [22:56:54]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	kurahaupo	[22:58:06] lgc_: I'm still a bit puzzled why your "sort" isn't doing a fallback comparison; it would take a detailed reading of the standard to figure out if it's correct [22:58:06]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	lgc_	[22:59:41] Then,if its the standard, kurahaupo, it would'nt be only my sort version, I suppose. :) . [22:59:41]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	penna	[23:02:59] hey, I read the user input with a while loop. When the user entered his message he is prompted again to "say something", how would I check a file and put the output into the users terminal, so he can read newest fileupdates? [23:02:59]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	twkm	[23:05:38] with cat, i'd presume.  though cat doesn't "check" anything. [23:05:38]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	wallbroken	[23:14:23] if [ "$num" -ge 0 ]; then [23:14:23]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	wallbroken	[23:14:36] after ], ; needed? [23:14:36]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	Andrew8472	[23:16:11] yes, check documentation [23:16:11]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	Andrew8472	[23:16:20] see exaples [23:16:20]

2016-10-25 13:49:46	izalove	[23:17:27] does the standard require shells to parse line by line? [23:17:27]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	izalove	[23:17:37] or can it just parse everything beforehand? [23:17:37]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	izalove	[23:18:01] == does posix sh allow you to append binary data to a script after it exits? [23:18:01]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	izalove	[23:19:54] ok i'm not 100% sure but it must be line by line for alias expansion [23:19:54]
2016-10-25 13:49:46	izalove	[23:22:10] is there any other feature in posix sh that needs special parsing?  like extglob in bash [23:22:10]

2016-10-25 15:33:48	kurahaupo	[22:58:06] lgc_: I'm still a bit puzzled why your "sort" isn't doing a fallback comparison; it would take a detailed reading of the standard to figure out if it's correct [22:58:06]

2016-10-25 15:33:48	izalove	[23:17:37] or can it just parse everything beforehand? [23:17:37]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	izalove	[23:18:01] == does posix sh allow you to append binary data to a script after it exits? [23:18:01]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	izalove	[23:19:54] ok i'm not 100% sure but it must be line by line for alias expansion [23:19:54]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	izalove	[23:22:10] is there any other feature in posix sh that needs special parsing?  like extglob in bash [23:22:10]

2016-10-25 15:33:49	greybot	[01:24:56] lemoi: set -x (or ''bash -x myscript'') makes bash output the exact command that it will run after parsing and expansion. You can put ''set -x'' just before the code you want to debug (turn off with ''set +x''). To add more information, change PS4 first: eg. PS4='+($?) $BASH_SOURCE:$FUNCNAME:$LINENO:' [01:24:56]
2016-10-25 15:33:49	yitz_	[01:25:31] Also, if we nitpick, the {} aren't needed and the == should be =. Oh. And avoid 'echo'. Use printf. [01:25:31]

2016-10-25 15:33:49	kerframil	[01:33:36] if you do insert break, it will try to break an enclosing loop [01:33:36]

2016-10-25 17:57:03	lemoi	[01:22:06] I'm trying to execute the elif block, however it doesn't work as expected. my code gets stuck in the first if [01:22:06]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	lemoi	[01:23:05] should I use break instead? [01:23:05]

2016-10-25 17:57:03	greybot	[01:24:56] lemoi: set -x (or ''bash -x myscript'') makes bash output the exact command that it will run after parsing and expansion. You can put ''set -x'' just before the code you want to debug (turn off with ''set +x''). To add more information, change PS4 first: eg. PS4='+($?) $BASH_SOURCE:$FUNCNAME:$LINENO:' [01:24:56]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	yitz_	[01:25:31] Also, if we nitpick, the {} aren't needed and the == should be =. Oh. And avoid 'echo'. Use printf. [01:25:31]

2016-10-25 17:57:03	kerframil	[01:33:00] lemoi: elif / elsif / else if <--- there's a reason that else is a term in this form of flow control. the concept of a break makes no sense. [01:33:00]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	kerframil	[01:33:36] if you do insert break, it will try to break an enclosing loop [01:33:36]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	lemoi	[01:36:33] kerframil ok... [01:36:33]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	kerframil	[01:38:16] also, in your example, it's not possible for both tests to be true, so I'm not even sure why you would want it to fall through, let alone expect it [01:38:16]

2016-10-25 17:57:03	CuriousErnestBro	[01:57:04] I can use the first command right? [01:57:04]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	kerframil	[01:57:23] you can, though it has some pitfalls [01:57:23]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	kerframil	[01:57:41] are you using a GNU userland? [01:57:41]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	CuriousErnestBro	[01:57:49] I think... [01:57:49]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	CuriousErnestBro	[01:57:56] ubuntu 16.04 lts [01:57:56]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	kerframil	[02:02:45] to be on the safe side, it's best to use null as a delimiter. such is possible in GNU: find ... -print0 | sort -zV | xargs -0 ... [02:02:45]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	CuriousErnestBro	[02:08:54] null as in 0? [02:08:54]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	CuriousErnestBro	[02:09:13] what would that do? [02:09:13]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	kerframil	[02:09:52] an actual null byte. paths can be safely split because paths in unix cannot contain a null byte. [02:09:52]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	CuriousErnestBro	[02:10:27] so literally 00000000 [02:10:27]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	CuriousErnestBro	[02:10:28] gotcha [02:10:28]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	kerframil	[02:11:50] it's a single byte, whose ordinal value is zero. in hex, it would be written as 0x00. [02:11:50]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	kerframil	[02:12:15] normally, these commands would join - or split - on a newline character [02:12:15]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	CuriousErnestBro	[02:13:14] oh I recognize that [02:13:14]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	CuriousErnestBro	[02:13:23] C++ pointers are at 0xblablabla [02:13:23]

I have a bash script that has a loop in it that is calling a number of fairly simple commands, and after a few loops, they seem to be taking longer (considerably longer than I would expect them to take) and wondering if there's some sort of pipe/redirect/pid spinup choking going on

Is there a utility which will give it that, but which will then give me its stdout? I was looking at screen with loggin, but I'm not sure if screen can log to stdout as well as a file, or if I can give it, like, >( some command ). Basically, I'm asking if there's a cleaner solution I'm not aware of.

2016-10-26 02:00:09	geirha	prints it
2016-10-26 02:00:16	geirha	in a way that can be reused as input
2016-10-26 02:00:43	rafalcpp	cool. so to use any kind of   < <( .. ) system must have /dev/fd?
2016-10-26 02:00:50	resh	yes
2016-10-26 02:01:16	rafalcpp	yeah then I suppose mounting it is the cleaner solution. thanks
2016-10-26 02:01:19	izalove	try    mount -t fdescfs fdesc /dev/fd

2016-10-26 04:15:07	greybot	pandaadb: The backquote (`) is used in the old-style command substitution, e.g. foo=`command`. The foo=$(command) syntax is recommended instead. Backslash handling inside $() is less surprising, and $() is easier to nest. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/082

2016-10-26 06:19:44	greybot	sh is NOT bash; it is a POSIX or Bourne shell. To run bash code, your script MUST use a bash shebang, and it MUST be executed directly or with bash (NOT sh myscript). Sometimes /bin/sh symlinks to bash, but you can't rely on this and it will disable many bash features. <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/Practices#Choose_Your_Shell>

I created a function which returns 1 ("exit 1") if a grep failed to find a string, then I use it in my main script in a condition. The problem is, when the function returns something else than 0 my entier script stops. Any idea about my issue ?

2016-10-26 09:43:41	Tanta	[19:03:37] it is this channel that has made me obsessed with getting rid of pipes [19:03:37]
2016-10-26 09:43:41	greycat	[19:04:09] That only matters when one part of the pipeline is a set of bash commands, especially ones that set variables you want to keep around. [19:04:09]

2016-10-26 09:43:41	x3kl1	[19:04:41] apparently :P [19:04:41]
2016-10-26 09:43:41	izalove	[19:04:42] you don't need to include quotes in a variable, and you can't do it [19:04:42]

2016-10-26 09:43:41	greycat	[19:07:48] setting IFS is pointless.  mapfile does not use it. [19:07:48]
2016-10-26 09:43:41	kanrao	[19:08:01] oh, thanks [19:08:01]

2016-10-26 09:43:41	Tanta	[19:10:49] here's an example of mapfile in action [19:10:49]
2016-10-26 09:43:41	Tanta	[19:10:58] when you use a command as stdin, you want to do input substitution [19:10:58]
2016-10-26 09:43:41	greycat	[19:11:13] process substitution is the correct term [19:11:13]
2016-10-26 09:43:41	Tanta	[19:12:47] yep, because the map file expects an object that is a file to operate [19:12:47]
2016-10-26 09:43:41	greycat	[19:13:08] Uh... no, it reads bytes from stdin. [19:13:08]
2016-10-26 09:43:41	greycat	[19:13:18] Doesn't even have to be a file. [19:13:18]
2016-10-26 09:43:41	Tanta	[19:14:00] I remember mapfile breaking on a standard input redirection, like mapfile -t array < $(command) [19:14:00]
2016-10-26 09:43:41	greycat	[19:14:15] Well, don't do that. [19:14:15]
2016-10-26 09:43:41	greycat	[19:14:20] mapfile -t array < <(command) [19:14:20]
2016-10-26 09:43:41	Tanta	[19:14:22] what's the difference? [19:14:22]
2016-10-26 09:43:41	emg	[19:14:33] because that's not how redirection works? (unless the output of command is a single word that is a file from which you'd like to read) [19:14:33]
2016-10-26 09:43:41	Tanta	[19:14:54] oh, I see [19:14:54]

2016-10-26 09:43:41	kanrao	[19:32:53] I'm a bit overwhelmed right now, but basically there are both blank lines and lines that I want to store in variables, I want to ignore the blank lines and eventually concatenate the 3 specific lines I want to keep [19:32:53]
2016-10-26 09:43:41	emg	[19:33:26] kanrao: are there lines that you want to trim leading/trailing whitespace from? or was that just to find lines that are blank except for whitespace? [19:33:26]
2016-10-26 09:43:41	greycat	[19:33:29] kanrao: So this ENTIRE SCRIPT is a false start?  It's a "Y"? [19:33:29]

2016-10-27 10:12:21	twkm	new_student: consider a file that contains "abc" to be replaced with "def".  if sponge hasn't yet written the 'f', resized the file (whether before writing or after) and asked for a filesystem synchronization then if something occurs that stops that sequence from happening (e.g., full filesystem) the inode will not have "def", it may be "" or "d" or "dbc" or several other combinations.

2016-10-27 10:15:52	new_student	no, replacement can be larger or smaller.

2016-10-27 17:07:24	alyptik	[21:39:52] really? i would have guess tar since tape [21:39:52]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	alyptik	[21:40:01] thought i guess data came before tape [21:40:01]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	twkm	[21:40:05] posix tar is just tar key [file...]. [21:40:05]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	sjohnson	[21:40:20] fact of the day:  no one uses tape archives anymore. [21:40:20]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	alyptik	[21:40:26] at last [21:40:26]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	phy1729	[21:40:34] sjohnson: liar [21:40:34]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	osse	[21:40:46] that's not what geirha said to me [21:40:46]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	twkm	[21:40:47] not quite true, but they are indeed hen's teeth these days. [21:40:47]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	twkm	[21:41:22] some places still have vast tape libraries, and rollerblades (no boards allowed, though the kidz seem to want to use them). [21:41:22]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	twkm	[21:41:46] err, roller{skat,blad}es. [21:41:46]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	alyptik	[21:42:05] where my A: at [21:42:05]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	phy1729	[21:42:11] no boards? How else am I supposed to ride in and say "Never fear; I is here." [21:42:11]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	sjohnson	[21:42:19] maybe tape drives will become "cool" again, for computer hipsters like with vinyl records. [21:42:19]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	osse	[21:42:22] alyptik: as of Win 10, nowhere [21:42:22]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	alyptik	[21:42:33] DAT tapes still pretty hipster [21:42:33]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	twkm	[21:42:34] but instead of nearly every place you go having some kind of tape system, now it is far less frequent unless you inhabit certain circles. [21:42:34]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	sjohnson	[21:42:58] then they can "tar" with that smug grin and say "guess what tar stands for?" to colleagues. [21:42:58]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	alyptik	[21:43:11] lol [21:43:11]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	sjohnson	[21:44:16] i do like how the save icon is still a 3.5" floppy disk though. [21:44:16]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	sjohnson	[21:44:20] it's cute. [21:44:20]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	osse	[21:47:22] yeah but you think everything's cute. [21:47:22]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	sjohnson	[21:47:44] true. [21:47:44]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	geirha	[21:47:46] Typical 3M. "Let's cash in on that save icon!" [21:47:46]

2016-10-27 17:07:24	geirha	[21:56:20] came with a CD with drivers [21:56:20]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	sjohnson	[21:58:48] i should borrow it.  i have some disks at home but have no idea if the data has kept after all these years. [21:58:48]

2016-10-27 17:07:24	justsomeguy	[02:25:30] elisa87: I think you can use the 'join' utility to do that, but I'm not sure how you'd go about it. [02:25:30]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	justsomeguy	[02:26:46] elisa87: Actually, on second look, ignore me. [02:26:46]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	elisa87	[02:28:02] I am totally new to bash so I can't comment sed ':a;$!{N;s/\n/, /;ba;}' at all [02:28:02]

2016-10-27 17:07:24	dualbus	[02:37:53] elisa87: why don't you ask SchrodingersScat? [02:37:53]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	elisa87	[02:38:17] because SchrodingersScat told to ask here dualbus [02:38:17]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	dualbus	[02:38:18] this channel isn't some sort of social service "we write script for free" [02:38:18]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	dualbus	[02:38:33] elisa87: have you tried googling? [02:38:33]

2016-10-27 17:07:24	elisa87	[02:50:31] thanks kerframil [02:50:31]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	dualbus	[02:52:58] SchrodingersScat: that it was you? It's in the askubuntu question [02:52:58]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	kerframil	[02:54:00] although, using sed is a lot more efficient. this is enough to make SchrodingersScat's approach do you what you want:- [02:54:00]

2016-10-27 22:29:48	izalove	[04:05:55] but that won't solve the problem [04:05:55]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	voldial	[04:06:08] xinput test 10 | sed -u '/.*\(key press\)/!d;s//\1/;q' [04:06:08]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	voldial	[04:06:10] that works [04:06:10]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	voldial	[04:06:54] is it possible to supress the input key echoing on the terminal? [04:06:54]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	izalove	[04:07:09] stty -echo [04:07:09]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	voldial	[04:08:31] how do I un-"stty -echo"? [04:08:31]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	voldial	[04:08:38] I tried stty + echo [04:08:38]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	izalove	[04:09:06] stty echo [04:09:06]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	voldial	[04:09:18] heh [04:09:18]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	voldial	[04:10:14] thanks izalove phy1729, "stty -echo ; xinput test 10 | sed -u '/.*\(key press\)/!d;s//\1/;q' ; stty echo" nice way to get a keycode [04:10:14]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	voldial	[04:11:54] I wonder if there's a way to get the correct xinput id without grepping the output of "xinput list"? [04:11:54]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	voldial	[04:26:24] little better: stty -echo ; xinput test `xinput list "AT Translated Set 2 keyboard" | grep id= | tr '[:blank:]' ' ' | sed 's/  */ /g' | cut -d ' ' -f 6 | cut -d '=' -f 2` | sed -u '/.*\(key press   \)/!d;s///;q' ; stty echo [04:26:24]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	phy1729	[04:29:20] so many forks [04:29:20]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	voldial	[04:30:28] phy1729: there's some extra stuff collapsing whitespace... how many forks can be axed? [04:30:28]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	phy1729	[04:31:07] probably all of the ones that you added. sed can do a lot [04:31:07]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	izalove	[04:32:12] sed can even replace stuff with its powerful s command [04:32:12]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	voldial	[04:35:09] so tr '[:blank:]' ' ' | sed 's/  */ /g' can be reduced by replicating the tr blank char class in sed... [04:35:09]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	izalove	[04:46:04] 's/   */ /g' should be faster than 's/  */ /g' [04:46:04]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	voldial	[04:50:53] izalove: that's odd [04:50:53]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	izalove	[04:51:07] why? [04:51:07]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	voldial	[04:51:29] because u just added a space, or do you mena in this specific case only? [04:51:29]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	izalove	[04:52:43] xx* matches a single x [04:52:43]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	izalove	[04:52:46] xxx* doesn't [04:52:46]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	voldial	[04:52:53] my generic "collapse all whitespace" pipe is "| tr '[:blank:]' ' ' | sed 's/  */ /g' |" would "sed 's/   */ /g'" be better in general? [04:52:53]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	izalove	[04:52:56] so yours replaces each single space with itself [04:52:56]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	voldial	[04:53:07] oooh. [04:53:07]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	voldial	[04:53:12] cool [04:53:12]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	izalove	[04:53:39] it's a very important optimization, it could save your company a couple of billions a year [04:53:39]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	voldial	[04:54:15] not a corner case. awesome. I'll ask for a raise, thx;)( [04:54:15]

2016-10-28 00:05:50	geirha	jorn: yes, the link count only counts links that link to the file
2016-10-28 00:05:50	jorn	^^
2016-10-28 00:06:37	jorn	so it's expected that files aren't counted in it?
2016-10-28 00:06:53	geirha	jorn: correct, because the filenames link to regular files, not to the directory
2016-10-28 00:07:06	jorn	this is clearly different on mac os x
2016-10-28 00:07:23	geirha	if you create a subdirectory, the link count will increase, because the subdirectory will include a .. which links to it

2016-10-28 01:52:55	Soliton	how is cat *.xml a too long argument but ls -a *.xml works?
2016-10-28 01:53:00	timvisher	i copied a pre-debug version
2016-10-28 01:53:05	TyrfingMjolnir	Soliton: Yes
2016-10-28 01:53:19	TyrfingMjolnir	Hence the xargs to split up into multiple results

2016-10-28 01:53:40	Soliton	*.xml is what expands to a too long list. same with cat and ls.

2016-10-28 01:55:41	greybot	TyrfingMjolnir: xargs(1) is dangerous (broken, exploitable, etc.) when reading non-NUL-delimited input. If you're working with filenames, use find's -exec [command] {} + instead. If you can get NUL-delimited output, use xargs -0. Otherwise, you probably want a while read or for loop instead.

2016-10-28 05:16:42	timvisher	ah apparently it was not on by default…
2016-10-28 05:16:51	timvisher	is that a result of the shebang? #!/usr/bin/env bash
2016-10-28 05:16:54	D630	is this a limited bash thingy or can I tweak that with ulimit? I get "bash: line 3: 15521 Segmentation fault"; with a brace group just "Segmentation fault":
2016-10-28 05:16:59	D630	"{ echo '('; for ((i=0; i < 32768; i++)); do printf ':;:;'; done; echo; echo ')'; } | env BASH_ENV= bash --norc"
2016-10-28 05:17:01	timvisher	does that not inherit my current options?
2016-10-28 05:17:06	greycat	timvisher: it's a result of it not being compiled into bash as an on-by-default option
2016-10-28 05:17:14	greycat	options are not inherited
2016-10-28 05:17:21	timvisher	ooooh. that makes sense then

2016-10-28 11:26:19	alex1a	[20:39:01] greycat, hoo, what should i do to avoid it ? [20:39:01]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	greycat	[20:39:04] Each function that uses select should probably set its own local PS3 to whatever you want for that specific menu. [20:39:04]

2016-10-28 11:26:19	alex1a	[20:40:43] just want to know if its possible to have 2 different PS3 messages in 2 selects [20:40:43]

2016-10-28 11:26:19	tdigenna	[20:43:21] question [20:43:21]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	tdigenna	[20:43:24] why it’s safer to expand wildcards with ./* instead of * in bash? [20:43:24]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	greycat	[20:43:58] It protects commands from interpreting filenames as options, if one of your filenames begins with - [20:43:58]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	lightly	[20:45:21] Hi, I'm curious if there's a way to do the temporary file descriptor trick to atomically write a permanent file. Basically, is there a way to make this work: http://slexy.org/view/s213w4opTs (complains $temp_file does not exist) [20:45:21]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	lightly	[20:45:56] imagine the echo "Today was a nice day." is an expensive failure-prone command [20:45:56]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	greycat	[20:45:59] Atomic file creation is usually done by writing to a temporary file and then mv'ing or ln'ing it to the real destination. [20:45:59]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	tdigenna	[20:46:06] good answer tx [20:46:06]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	greycat	[20:46:41] Obviously the temp file and the real destination have to be in the same file system for that to work. [20:46:41]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	lightly	[20:47:09] greycat: I'm doing that, but is it also possible to use the nice temporary file descriptor trick for cleaning up the temp file after the script exits? [20:47:09]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	lightly	[20:47:18] as in here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/687014/removing-created-temp-files-in-unexpected-bash-exit [20:47:18]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	greycat	[20:47:35] Just use an EXIT trap to remove temp files. [20:47:35]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	kurahaupo__	[20:47:50] lightly: so the echo writes into an unlinked file. once it's unlinked it's difficult or impossible to get it back [20:47:50]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	greycat	[20:48:01] trap 'rm -f "$tmpfile"' EXIT   # plus whatever other cleanup [20:48:01]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	greycat	[20:48:40] Writing to unlinked files only works when you want to DESTROY the information upon exit, and when you're working in a language where you can rewind and re-read the file at will. [20:48:40]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	greycat	[20:48:59] Bash commands are all independent processes (usually), so they need a file *name*. [20:48:59]

2016-10-28 12:03:44	serard_	I'm trying to code a shell script that runs two "sudo journalctl -u $unit -f &"; having a trap func handler to kill the ran commands. But the trap func is never executed. I put a wait in my script and trap kill_handler INT, but not working, any idead ?

2016-10-28 12:28:12	leoybkim	[21:36:36] but "for a, b, in arrayname:" so simple and elegant [21:36:36]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	leoybkim	[21:36:55] : -> ; [21:36:55]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	kurahaupo	[21:38:05] leoybkim: yes, but how often is it used? What syntax do you propose that would be unambiguous and would not require new metacharacters? [21:38:05]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	davidfetter	[21:38:08] hi [21:38:08]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	davidfetter	[21:38:44] i want to do a "destructive" getops in the sense of removing any opts i've checked for from the array [21:38:44]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	davidfetter	[21:39:01] is there a relatively straightforward way to do this? [21:39:01]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	davidfetter	[21:43:12] getopts* [21:43:12]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	davidfetter	[21:45:29] i found this, but it's...a little cloudy to me as to how it works. http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/156223/bash-how-to-remove-options-from-parameters-after-processing [21:45:29]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	izalove	[21:45:41] just save the ones you want in an array [21:45:41]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	davidfetter	[21:46:08] i know about the ones i don't want [21:46:08]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	davidfetter	[21:46:18] not all the ones i do :/ [21:46:18]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	izalove	[21:46:32] the loop [21:46:32]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	davidfetter	[21:46:55] ? [21:46:55]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	geirha	[21:47:07] mikeserv at it again [21:47:07]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	geirha	[21:47:48] davidfetter: populate a new array with the ones you don't don't want [21:47:48]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	davidfetter	[21:49:00] hrm. isn't there some way just to remove the ones i don't want as i see them? [21:49:00]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	izalove	[21:49:56] yes it's called not adding them to the array of the ones you want [21:49:56]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	MrPockets	[21:50:37] Need a push in the right direction with bash theory [21:50:37]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	MrPockets	[21:50:56] I'm trying to write a script that'll alert me if a new host / device is on the network. [21:50:56]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	MrPockets	[21:51:19] so far,  nmap -sP  and pipe it through grep to extract MAC addresses, then compare against BASELINE.file. [21:51:19]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	MrPockets	[21:51:45] If i run that every say, 5 minutes, and IF new mac exists, write it to ALERTS.file with the date and time it was found. [21:51:45]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	davidfetter	[21:52:05] doesn't that give you O(N^2) behavior? [21:52:05]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	MrPockets	[21:52:25] But i'd liek a way to also send me an email to alert me, but If the new host is online for say, 40 hours, I dont want an email every 5 minutes for the nest 40 hours. [21:52:25]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	izalove	[21:52:26] and what is N? [21:52:26]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	davidfetter	[21:52:42] N=number of things in BASELINE.file [21:52:42]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	davidfetter	[21:53:16] we DB geeks get antsy about anything bigger than O(N) :P [21:53:16]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	davidfetter	[21:53:30] well, anything bigger than O(NlogN) [21:53:30]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	davidfetter	[21:53:33] (sort) [21:53:33]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	 *	MrPockets [21:53:40] confused as shit [21:53:40]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	izalove	[21:54:04] what part do you need help with? [21:54:04]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	davidfetter	[21:54:06] if BASELINE.file is small (<1000000) just ignore me [21:54:06]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	izalove	[21:54:34] pretty sure they don't have millions of devices in that network [21:54:34]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	MrPockets	[21:54:53] So if this thing runs every 5 minutes, and logs any differences when it runs (so I can see "the first time it was spotted was 10:00,  and it was found every 5 minutes until 2:00pm" [21:54:53]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	MrPockets	[21:55:24] But I want it to do X the first time it is found, and NOT do X every subsequent time in the next 60 minutes. [21:55:24]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	izalove	[21:57:08] MrPockets: and what part do you need help with?  don't say the whole thing [21:57:08]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	MrPockets	[21:58:13] the logic of avoiding doing _thing_ for the next 60 mintues. [21:58:13]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	MrPockets	[21:58:54] 'eh, if I'm just nonsensically blabbing I'll just take this back to the whiteboard. [21:58:54]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	geirha	[21:58:55] if (( now - timestamp > 3600 )); then [21:58:55]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	MrPockets	[21:59:25] I like that. [21:59:25]

2016-10-28 15:22:38	Yut	Hello.
2016-10-28 15:22:52	Yut	I am wanting to write a script that depends on an api token.
2016-10-28 15:23:06	Yut	I don't want the Token to be hardcoded into the script
2016-10-28 15:23:15	Yut	I found plenty of articles that say to use variables other say don't
2016-10-28 15:23:28	Yut	What is the best method for protecting that token so that I can use it in my script?
2016-10-28 15:24:14	izalove	protecting from what?

2016-10-28 22:16:42	Yut	[01:23:15] I found plenty of articles that say to use variables other say don't [01:23:15]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	Yut	[01:23:28] What is the best method for protecting that token so that I can use it in my script? [01:23:28]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	izalove	[01:24:14] protecting from what? [01:24:14]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	Yut	[01:25:25] The token is the secret right. [01:25:25]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	Yut	[01:25:30] Like a password [01:25:30]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	Yut	[01:25:37] I don't want it to be hardcoded into a script. [01:25:37]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	Yut	[01:25:55] What do you do when you're faced with authenticating in your script, but don't want to directly hardcode a password? [01:25:55]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	izalove	[01:27:06] i don't get it, what are you afraid of? [01:27:06]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	yitz	[01:27:18] Yut: Put it into a different file [01:27:18]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	izalove	[01:27:36] and what would that solve? [01:27:36]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	Yut	[01:27:52] Okay.  So just a different variable [01:27:52]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	Yut	[01:27:54] And call it. [01:27:54]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	Yut	[01:28:02] Hmm.. k. [01:28:02]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	yitz	[01:28:03] Separate your script/code and your secrets [01:28:03]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	Yut	[01:28:05] Thanks guys. [01:28:05]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	yitz	[01:28:27] That was you can share/upload your script without leaking credentials [01:28:27]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	yitz	[01:28:50] Or encrypt one and not the other [01:28:50]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	Xsavior	[01:44:36] If I want to add: Integer% (ex: 200%) to my command without any quotes or anything. Just strickly replace some variable in front of a % with a number. How would I do that? Would I use $(Number)%? [01:44:36]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	Xsavior	[01:44:58] %(VAR) I mean. [01:44:58]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	Xsavior	[01:45:16] Ooops: $(VAR)% [01:45:16]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	Xsavior	[01:46:09] If VAR is some string then $(VAR) changes it to integer? [01:46:09]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	Xsavior	[01:46:34] Maybe everything is a string in Bash.... [01:46:34]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	twkm	[01:59:44] Xsavior: $var%... [01:59:44]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	twkm	[01:59:51] as an aside, don't use all upper-case variable names for purely internal purposes. [01:59:51]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	Xsavior	[02:02:01] twkm: ok, thanks. [02:02:01]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	stacks88	[04:32:37] in file.txt it only has 1 line, and it says: [TestingName] CityBlah - The Blahhhh Blah Blahh - 09 [4214h] -- so i want to do, name=$(cat file.txt) and then echo $name and have it be exactly whats in file.txt .. but that isnt working.. when i echo $name i get "i CityBlah - The Blahhhh Blah Blahh - 09 h" -- so not quite the whole thing , becuase of the brackets.. how can i get name to become exactly [04:32:37]

2016-10-28 22:16:42	unclechu	[07:51:27] hey guys, any ideas how to redirect to some app stdin previous command? like `!!` or `!!p`? [07:51:27]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	unclechu	[07:54:14] `!!` executes command and redirects its output and `!!:p` doesn't redirect anything [07:54:14]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	unclechu	[07:55:08] just shown whole new command with expanded `!!:p` [07:55:08]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	unclechu	[07:59:38] I guess I found a solution: `history | tail -n2 | head -n1 | sed 's/^[ 0-9]\+//g'` [07:59:38]

2016-10-28 22:16:42	unclechu	[08:08:26] guys, why some examples with `sed` command always use `-e` flag to it but some another not? is there any difference between `sed -e 's/foo/bar/'` and `sed 's/foo/bar/'`? [08:08:26]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	han-solo	[08:11:49] # sed --help | grep -- -e [08:11:49]

2016-10-28 22:16:42	unclechu	[08:15:04] I know what is `-e` flag, I just wonder if it is enabled by default? [08:15:04]
2016-10-28 22:16:42	unclechu	[08:16:31] may be it isnt on some systems (like freebsd for example)? [08:16:31]

2016-10-29 01:02:57	madalin	i have a situation where i set a variable X as "value1" "value2longervalue" and then i do a for but when i'm echoing the value1, value2...etc the echo is longer because the values are longer. How could i make the echoed line be of the same size ?
2016-10-29 01:03:12	madalin	basically the echo is like this: value2 has IP: IP address (and obviously the 2nd one looks like value2longervalue has IP: IP address

2016-10-29 12:25:06	neilpdx	[20:39:47] very interesting thanks for sharing ormaaj [20:39:47]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	raedah	[20:40:56] what I am doing wrong here. quotes dont seem to work as desired. [20:40:56]

2016-10-29 12:25:06	twkm	[20:42:16] that's a lot of & -- why don't you trust slock and xset to finish reasonably quickly? [20:42:16]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	dreisner	[20:42:37] because & time & is & money & [20:42:37]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	dreisner	[20:42:47] gotta & hide & that & porn & [20:42:47]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	Munt	[20:43:47] hey folks I've forgotten how to extract the nth argument from a programs output.  I want to run something like this: ps -A | grep -i .partialMatch.*       and output only the PID's to another process ... pkill for arguments sake [20:43:47]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	raedah	[20:45:00] yeah, the &s was the issue. works now [20:45:00]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	ormaaj	[20:45:37] Munt: probably thinking of cut, but you might want to just use pgrep -a [20:45:37]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	ormaaj	[20:46:38] possibly pgrep -af if you need to match against a whole command [20:46:38]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	Munt	[20:47:41] cut looks just like what i'm trying to achieve but i seem to remember doing it before using $1 to select the first column etc  Thanks for the heads up regarding pgrep! [20:47:41]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	ormaaj	[20:48:22] you were probably using a loop with "read" then [20:48:22]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	ormaaj	[20:49:18] (pgrep and pkill are the same program.) [20:49:18]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	Munt	[20:49:34] Perhaps, it's vanished from my mind :p  Cut's working great though. [20:49:34]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	Munt	[20:50:27] Ahh I didnt realise.  The pkill was just an example. I thanks a lot for your help [20:50:27]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	ormaaj	[20:50:34] pgrep to figure out what you want to die. pkill for the killing [20:50:34]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	Riviera	[20:50:39] $1 sounds like awk [20:50:39]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	Munt	[20:50:50] ormaaj  nice! [20:50:50]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	Munt	[20:50:56] Riviera  : that sounds like the one :p [20:50:56]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	Munt	[20:51:35] Im not sure how $1 relates to awk ... but it's ringing a lot of bells :p [20:51:35]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	blawiz	[21:26:47] echo "" > file, and its not zero, how can i make a file zero, but not delete it? [21:26:47]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	Riviera	[21:28:06] > file [21:28:06]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	dualbus	[21:28:08] blawiz: truncate -s 0 file [21:28:08]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	Riviera	[21:28:24] assuming that with "make a file zero" you mean what i think you do. [21:28:24]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	blawiz	[21:28:44] so 'if -s file' wont trigger [21:28:44]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	blawiz	[21:29:49] seems to work :] [21:29:49]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	dualbus	[21:30:05] blawiz: echo writes a \n, so that why it's not zero [21:30:05]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	blawiz	[21:30:25] aha, maybe printf would work [21:30:25]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	twkm	[21:43:14] : works, as in : > "file" [21:43:14]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	ycyclist	[21:46:19] I cannot find an item to keep multiple simultaneous bash sessions in the history file. [21:46:19]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	ycyclist	[21:46:43] At one time I recall I did this by naming history files with dates and process ids, but this short circuits recall later. [21:46:43]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	twkm	[21:47:08] because such does not exist.  each bash already maintains its own history, until it terminates. [21:47:08]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	ycyclist	[21:48:21] But when it terminates, how does it know which file to pull up next session.  I think you cannot do that.  If you name unique to the session, history cannot find it next time.  Stuck. [21:48:21]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	ycyclist	[21:48:37] If you don't, one session overwrites another. [21:48:37]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	ycyclist	[21:48:54] There is an incremental write, but I don't know how it behaves with two sessions. [21:48:54]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	ycyclist	[21:50:01] Perhaps this does it: [21:50:01]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	ycyclist	[21:50:03] shopt -s histappend [21:50:03]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	twkm	[21:50:35] thus "such does not exist". [21:50:35]

2016-10-29 18:39:18	izalove	[04:14:14] the other is yourself [04:14:14]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	izalove	[04:14:19] because you're called amuled as well [04:14:19]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	wallbroken	[04:14:56] i called amuled? [04:14:56]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	wallbroken	[04:15:06] in which sense? [04:15:06]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	izalove	[04:15:21] you == your script [04:15:21]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	wallbroken	[04:15:36] totally unclear [04:15:36]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	wallbroken	[04:15:39] ps | grep amuled [04:15:39]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	twkm	[04:15:42] the name of your script. [04:15:42]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	wallbroken	[04:15:45] i get ONLY ONE process running [04:15:45]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	twkm	[04:15:53] it might be a substring. [04:15:53]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	wallbroken	[04:16:19] oh ok [04:16:19]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	wallbroken	[04:16:21] my script [04:16:21]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	wallbroken	[04:16:26] now it's clear [04:16:26]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	wallbroken	[04:16:39] so, a solution could be renaming the script? [04:16:39]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	Celmor	[04:18:50] is /etc/bash.bashrc additionally sourced to ~/.bashrc when opening an interactive terminal? [04:18:50]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	twkm	[04:19:37] wallbroken: pgrep -x amuled might be okay. [04:19:37]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	twkm	[04:19:51] Celmor: depends. [04:19:51]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	Celmor	[04:19:56] on what? [04:19:56]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	Celmor	[04:20:11] given that both files exist [04:20:11]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	wallbroken	[04:20:14] twkm, as i daid, i do not have pgrep on my machine, and i can't install it [04:20:14]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	wallbroken	[04:20:19] it's an embedded system [04:20:19]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	twkm	[04:20:24] stby. [04:20:24]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	twkm	[04:20:40] Celmor: how bash is invoked. [04:20:40]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	Celmor	[04:21:07] well, interactivel, either in a tty or pty [04:21:07]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	twkm	[04:21:34] see ''man bash'', invocation section. [04:21:34]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	Celmor	[04:22:18] I guess, I'm just gonna rather try it out then, because what do I know how my terminal emulator is gonna invoke bash exactly [04:22:18]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	twkm	[04:23:06] it's probably documented. [04:23:06]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	wallbroken	[04:23:11] twkm [04:23:11]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	wallbroken	[04:23:12] set $(pidof amuled); if [ "$1" = "$$" ]; then kill "$2"; else kill "$1"; fi [04:23:12]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	wallbroken	[04:23:19] do you know what this cript does? [04:23:19]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	twkm	[04:24:09] certainly.  but as izalove wrote it for you what not ask her? [04:24:09]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	Celmor	[04:24:56] it gets executed without parameters [04:24:56]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	twkm	[04:25:54] err, why not. [04:25:54]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	twkm	[04:26:38] Celmor: yes, that's normal.  but which kind of interactive invocation determines which file or files are source'd. [04:26:38]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	Celmor	[04:27:39] well, there's no man page for my terminal emulator [04:27:39]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	wallbroken	[04:28:03] twkm, but maybe looks like busy [04:28:03]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	twkm	[04:28:32] that's odd.  though maybe you have one made by one of today's kidz, so it only has a web shite that may document the version you use. [04:28:32]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	twkm	[04:28:57] wallbroken: sorry.  i don't understand you. [04:28:57]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	Celmor	[04:31:18] twkm, both get sourced [04:31:18]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	Celmor	[04:32:23] so I guess I should have '[ -r /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion   ] && . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion' only in one of these files, right? [04:32:23]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	twkm	[04:33:34] yes. [04:33:34]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	Celmor	[04:34:21] seems like the default is it getting added to both files though [04:34:21]

2016-10-29 23:10:13	wallbroken	[04:15:39] ps | grep amuled [04:15:39]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	twkm	[04:15:42] the name of your script. [04:15:42]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	wallbroken	[04:15:45] i get ONLY ONE process running [04:15:45]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	twkm	[04:15:53] it might be a substring. [04:15:53]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	wallbroken	[04:16:19] oh ok [04:16:19]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	wallbroken	[04:16:21] my script [04:16:21]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	wallbroken	[04:16:26] now it's clear [04:16:26]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	wallbroken	[04:16:39] so, a solution could be renaming the script? [04:16:39]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	Celmor	[04:18:50] is /etc/bash.bashrc additionally sourced to ~/.bashrc when opening an interactive terminal? [04:18:50]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	twkm	[04:19:37] wallbroken: pgrep -x amuled might be okay. [04:19:37]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	twkm	[04:19:51] Celmor: depends. [04:19:51]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	Celmor	[04:19:56] on what? [04:19:56]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	Celmor	[04:20:11] given that both files exist [04:20:11]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	wallbroken	[04:20:14] twkm, as i daid, i do not have pgrep on my machine, and i can't install it [04:20:14]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	wallbroken	[04:20:19] it's an embedded system [04:20:19]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	twkm	[04:20:24] stby. [04:20:24]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	twkm	[04:20:40] Celmor: how bash is invoked. [04:20:40]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	Celmor	[04:21:07] well, interactivel, either in a tty or pty [04:21:07]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	twkm	[04:21:34] see ''man bash'', invocation section. [04:21:34]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	Celmor	[04:22:18] I guess, I'm just gonna rather try it out then, because what do I know how my terminal emulator is gonna invoke bash exactly [04:22:18]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	twkm	[04:23:06] it's probably documented. [04:23:06]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	wallbroken	[04:23:11] twkm [04:23:11]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	wallbroken	[04:23:12] set $(pidof amuled); if [ "$1" = "$$" ]; then kill "$2"; else kill "$1"; fi [04:23:12]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	wallbroken	[04:23:19] do you know what this cript does? [04:23:19]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	twkm	[04:24:09] certainly.  but as izalove wrote it for you what not ask her? [04:24:09]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	Celmor	[04:24:56] it gets executed without parameters [04:24:56]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	twkm	[04:25:54] err, why not. [04:25:54]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	twkm	[04:26:38] Celmor: yes, that's normal.  but which kind of interactive invocation determines which file or files are source'd. [04:26:38]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	Celmor	[04:27:39] well, there's no man page for my terminal emulator [04:27:39]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	wallbroken	[04:28:03] twkm, but maybe looks like busy [04:28:03]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	twkm	[04:28:32] that's odd.  though maybe you have one made by one of today's kidz, so it only has a web shite that may document the version you use. [04:28:32]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	twkm	[04:28:57] wallbroken: sorry.  i don't understand you. [04:28:57]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	Celmor	[04:31:18] twkm, both get sourced [04:31:18]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	Celmor	[04:32:23] so I guess I should have '[ -r /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion   ] && . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion' only in one of these files, right? [04:32:23]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	twkm	[04:33:34] yes. [04:33:34]
2016-10-29 23:10:13	Celmor	[04:34:21] seems like the default is it getting added to both files though [04:34:21]

2016-10-30 00:15:03	D630	I think, that colon is a special builtin might be the point. I have been wondering, why colon is faster than true: # unset -f : true; time for ((i=0; i < 32768; i++)); do \:; \:; done;

2016-10-30 08:39:55	greybot	By convention, environment variables (PATH, EDITOR, SHELL, ...) and internal shell variables (BASH_VERSION, RANDOM, ...) are fully capitalized. All other variable names should be lowercase. Since variable names are case-sensitive, this convention avoids accidentally overriding environmental and internal variables.

2016-10-30 11:14:54	geirha	so it's an external command. Then PATH is probably changed inside the script, or the script is run in a different context

2016-10-30 11:20:21	geirha	./thescript  will inherit the PATH your interactive shell has
2016-10-30 11:20:30	geirha	assuming PATH is exported, but it most likely is
2016-10-30 11:20:50	The_Woodsman	ahhh so i need to add the directory that type listed off to the PATH and it will know to look there
2016-10-30 11:22:16	geirha	yes, if you run it from a different context, such as via cron or at
2016-10-30 11:22:50	twkm	off-path commandss you explicitly supplied a path to would either need to have that path provided via PATH or your script needs to invoke it in the same way.

2016-10-30 16:35:31	kyan	Hi, so it seems easy enough to edit a file e.g. cmd ./file > ./file, and easy enough to run commands on a file e.g. find . -name "file" -print0 | xargs -0 cmd --, but how do I combine them without having to make a script or function to do the redirection?
2016-10-30 16:36:43	twkm	the first thing is usually wrong.

2016-10-30 16:37:14	Ouroboros	use, -exec is basically always preferred

2016-10-30 16:38:15	twkm	the bash script can have all the bash things, like redirection.  though foo file > file doesn't work like you seem to think it might work.
2016-10-30 16:39:07	kyan	Ah, thanks.

2016-10-31 00:23:03	geirha	[06:09:16] I wouldn't even bother wrapping type in a function. It's only like 3 chars shorter [06:09:16]

2016-10-31 00:23:04	apus	[08:44:58] hi, i have the following string "-00". if not empty, i want it to become ${str/-/ }. that works. if empty i want it to become ${str:-" 00"}. combining them does not seem to work: ${str/-/ :-" 00"}. do i need to do this in two steps or am i using the wrong syntax? [08:44:58]
2016-10-31 00:23:04	izalove	[08:48:58] apus: is it mandatory to do it all in one unreadable expansion? [08:48:58]
2016-10-31 00:23:04	izalove	[08:49:08] or can you use an if like a normal person? [08:49:08]
2016-10-31 00:23:04	apus	[08:54:10] izalove: so search/replace and default value functionality can not be combined. thank you for the info. then i'll have a few more lines of code, doesn't harm anyone, just wanted to know if it was possible or not [08:54:10]
2016-10-31 00:23:04	izalove	[08:56:12] this looks like the kind of thing that zsh can do with its nested expansion [08:56:12]
2016-10-31 00:23:04	apus	[09:00:31] izalove: thank you for the tip, i'll have a look, but at the moment i'm focused on bash. [09:00:31]

2016-10-31 01:46:14	ImQ009	How do I make it squeeze the file name between 'stuff' and 'things'?

2016-10-31 01:46:33	ImQ009	I've been googling around and haven't been able to find a straight up answer
2016-10-31 01:46:53	ImQ009	Everything I found was rather specific to the individual cases
2016-10-31 01:47:26	vktec	Kxao: Yes, like Python. Package managers are usually very complex though, so you'd probably be better off using an existing one
2016-10-31 01:47:31	kurahaupo	Pat2: are you running that from a system crontab, from the root user's crontab, or from another user's crontab?

2016-10-31 01:47:37	greybot	ImQ009: xargs(1) is dangerous (broken, exploitable, etc.) when reading non-NUL-delimited input. If you're working with filenames, use find's -exec [command] {} + instead. If you can get NUL-delimited output, use xargs -0. Otherwise, you probably want a while read or for loop instead.
2016-10-31 01:48:13	ImQ009	vktec: find provides unsorted output
2016-10-31 01:48:15	Pat2	kurahaupo: i putted the mailto in the crontab, the error indicates : /root/testipf2b.sh: line 3: iptables : commande introuvable . i add the /sbin, i think the problem will be resolved...

2016-10-31 01:48:30	ImQ009	Well, with 'sort' yeah

2016-10-31 05:33:13	davidfetter	is there a way to make getopts destructive, i.e. to have it remove options it's seen?

2016-10-31 10:32:14	kyan_	Hi! I've got a text file with a few command arguments on each line (e.g. --foo="bar baz" qux). In the bash script I'm writing, I'd like to have it loop over the lines in that file, and run otherCommand --extraArgument [arguments from file]. If I used otherCommand --extraArgument ($line) I'd think it would end up with the arguments --foo="bar, baz", and qux instead. How can I do that? Thanks! :)

2016-10-31 12:18:29	StrongJava	I figured it was to make it a one-liner.

2016-10-31 12:20:09	DANtheBEASTman	really shouldn't need sudo for patching.
2016-10-31 12:20:38	StrongJava	Yeah, that works, but I was curious about the expansion bit, which does seem to work now. Seems the first time I tried it, it didn't.

2016-10-31 12:22:48	StrongJava	The second part is that the path in the patch starts with qtwebengine vice qtwebengine-opensource-src-5.6.1, so the patch doesn't work. I get the error: can't find file to patch at input line 3
2016-10-31 12:24:02	DANtheBEASTman	i'd edit the patch file to point to the right dirs. a little sed -i replacement would probably work
2016-10-31 12:24:14	DANtheBEASTman	or, rename the directory to what the patch expects

2016-10-31 13:42:02	Ouroboros	[21:54:56] well, your original plan is fine then [21:54:56]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	MediocreNutty	[21:55:21] o.o [21:55:21]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	MediocreNutty	[21:55:22] DANtheBEASTman: [21:55:22]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	Ouroboros	[21:55:30] i'd just use awk/sed/perl/whatever to convert the filenames [21:55:30]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	MediocreNutty	[21:56:47] damn, that software is $60 [21:56:47]

2016-10-31 13:42:02	MediocreNutty	[21:57:41] i owe you one [21:57:41]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	Ouroboros	[22:01:03] meh, outlook may be better [22:01:03]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	DANtheBEASTman	[22:09:49] i mean if the boss wants it done, tell him it'll be more man hours than it'll cost for the tool [22:09:49]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	StrongJava	[22:11:29] Is this an acceptable room for a question about applying patches using patch? Not exactly bash, but one-liner I'm using is a shell. [22:11:29]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	cyphix	[22:11:55] How can I grep a word, except if the word is followed by a given pattern, before the selection is made? I would like to select 'blah' except if it is actually 'blah blih'. And since I need to grep the context of the expression, I can't simply say 'grep -A 10 B 10 blah | grep -v 'blah blih' because in that case, it will remove the occurences of 'blah blih', but it will conserve its context. [22:11:55]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	DANtheBEASTman	[22:12:19] cyphix: you need a regex lookaround [22:12:19]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	LjL	[22:12:40] cyphix, you could always do the grep -v first [22:12:40]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	cyphix	[22:12:49] DANtheBEASTman: Could you help me with that? I don't know regexp well enough to figure out how to put it... [22:12:49]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	DANtheBEASTman	[22:12:56] !nabq [22:12:56]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	greybot	[22:12:56] Not a #bash question. We're no experts in that software or OS; consider asking the channel or mailing list with experts on that topic (eg. ##linux #openssh #ubuntu #zsh). [22:12:56]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	cyphix	[22:13:03] LjL: Oh... I didn't think of that... :) [22:13:03]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	DANtheBEASTman	[22:13:09] #regex would be a better channel for regex help [22:13:09]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	cyphix	[22:13:46] Ok, I didn't even know this channel existed. I'll try there, thank you [22:13:46]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	jeffreylevesque	[22:13:52] what's the recommended syntax to check if a command exists in .bash_profile? [22:13:52]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	DANtheBEASTman	[22:14:27] `type -p` or `command -v` [22:14:27]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	DANtheBEASTman	[22:15:24] # type -p grep [22:15:24]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	shbot	[22:15:25] DANtheBEASTman: /bin/grep [22:15:25]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	DANtheBEASTman	[22:15:31] # command -v asdfasdlfkj [22:15:31]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	shbot	[22:15:32] DANtheBEASTman: no output [22:15:32]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	StrongJava	[22:17:09] I'm trying to apply a patch for building qtwebengine as part of a Mac Port. The suggestion was to type:  sudo sh -c "cd `port work qt5-qtwebengine`/qtwebengine*; patch -Np0 -i /Path/To/patch-qwe-disable-bt-560.diff" However this doesn't work as the actual directory is qtwebengine-opensource-src-5.6.1. [22:17:09]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	DANtheBEASTman	[22:17:32] why would you `sudo sh` [22:17:32]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	StrongJava	[22:17:51] In the cd, shoudl qtwebengine expand to qtwebengine-opensource-src-5.6.1 if that is the only folder in there? [22:17:51]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	StrongJava	[22:18:29] I figured it was to make it a one-liner. [22:18:29]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	DANtheBEASTman	[22:19:56] so `cd` to the right dir and then run the patch? [22:19:56]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	DANtheBEASTman	[22:20:09] really shouldn't need sudo for patching. [22:20:09]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	StrongJava	[22:20:38] Yeah, that works, but I was curious about the expansion bit, which does seem to work now. Seems the first time I tried it, it didn't. [22:20:38]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	StrongJava	[22:22:48] The second part is that the path in the patch starts with qtwebengine vice qtwebengine-opensource-src-5.6.1, so the patch doesn't work. I get the error: can't find file to patch at input line 3 [22:22:48]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	DANtheBEASTman	[22:24:02] i'd edit the patch file to point to the right dirs. a little sed -i replacement would probably work [22:24:02]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	DANtheBEASTman	[22:24:14] or, rename the directory to what the patch expects [22:24:14]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	StrongJava	[22:24:57] Ok. That is what I'm going to head down, but was curious if the * was supposed to be affecting how patch operated. But, I guess not. [22:24:57]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	sameer_	[22:45:17] is there a script / settings to have every remote ssh command logged on target machine [22:45:17]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	sameer_	[22:47:30]  is there a script / settings to have every remote ssh command logged on target machine with the details of the user who executed the command [22:47:30]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	Ouroboros	[22:49:16] MediocreNutty: here is my solution to your original move problem: find stuff | perl -ne "if (m/^([^\/]+\/[^\/]+\/)([0-9]{4})$/) { system (\"mkdir\", \"-p\", \"copy/\$1\$2\"); } elsif (m/^([^\/]+\/[^\/]+\/)([0-9]{4})\/(.+\.eml)$/) { system (\"cp\", \"-p\", \"\$1\$2/\$3\", \"copy/\$1\$2-\$3\"); }" [22:49:16]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	Ouroboros	[22:50:41] (only issue is the system commands cannot take input interactively, not sure if that can be fixed) [22:50:41]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	Ouroboros	[22:53:56] MediocreNutty: slightly improved: find stuff | perl -n -e "if (m/^([^\/]+\/[^\/]+\/)([0-9]{4})$/) { system (\"mkdir\", \"-p\", \"copy/\$1\$2\"); } elsif (m/^([^\/]+\/[^\/]+\/)([0-9]{4})\/([^\/]+\.eml)$/) { system (\"cp\", \"-p\", \"\$1\$2/\$3\", \"copy/\$1\$2-\$3\"); }" [22:53:56]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	neilpdx	[22:55:50] nice names [22:55:50]

2016-10-31 14:45:38	emehrkay	Im trying to modfiy an old script that uses lftp to download some files. It retrieves a list of remote files, compares it to the local files and only pulls down the diff. It seems to hang after downloading a file, it says xxx bytes transferred and doesnt do anyting after. The line in the script that actually downloaded the file was in backticks, but it was hanging so I took them out. any idea what I am doing wrong?
2016-10-31 14:46:23	izalove	show it?

2016-10-31 16:21:03	emehrkay	[01:02:27] it is a php script that reads all of the downloaded files and writes the contents to a db [01:02:27]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	emehrkay	[01:02:40] Looks like there is a zero in there and is causing errors wih the delete [01:02:40]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[01:04:49] hm, any obvious mechanism to defer execution of some commands? [01:04:49]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[01:07:33] i.e. queue up some commands and then let them proceed later [01:07:33]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	charles81	[01:13:06] Like sleep or more event based? [01:13:06]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[01:15:52] well, it nees to be oob or async from the main script which is generating these commands [01:15:52]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[01:16:55] i mean, there are various ways like saving them in a string or file, but you invariable run into the issue of having to reparse arguments [01:16:55]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	charles81	[01:20:49] So you want to do something like set them to run in the background but then delay them or have them wait for a further signal from the parent script before actually continuing? [01:20:49]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	charles81	[01:22:04] Or background a whole heap of commands and have the parent script wait for all those child scripts to finish before continuing? [01:22:04]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[01:23:50] the former, i guess [01:23:50]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[01:24:17] well both, really [01:24:17]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[01:25:17] one idea i had was to make them read from a fifo or something, but they are all fs commands, so they dont read any input [01:25:17]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	charles81	[01:26:28] So get your commands, fire each one off into the background with & and then use the "wait" command in the main script to wait for all background jobs to finish before continuing? That work? [01:26:28]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[01:27:26] but they must wait for a signal before starting to execute [01:27:26]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[01:28:19] the basic example problem is something like "remove n files, but only if all of them exist" [01:28:19]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	charles81	[01:37:47] Suspend? [01:37:47]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[01:39:34] actually, i think my fifo idea might be workable [01:39:34]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	charles81	[01:39:58] sh -c "suspend; sleep 60" & [01:39:58]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	charles81	[01:40:26] Then "bg" and "wait" [01:40:26]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[01:40:53] i am trying to do it in a posix way though (why? who knows), so i think suspend doesnt work [01:40:53]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[01:41:06] otherwise i could just do it with various bash array features [01:41:06]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[01:41:31] but maybe fifo in combination with your backgrounding idea could work [01:41:31]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[01:43:22] hm, but with fifo it will be annoying to abort it [01:43:22]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[01:43:27] or in general [01:43:27]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	charles81	[01:44:32] Suspend just uses bash's job control. To abort you just kill the jobs [01:44:32]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[01:45:26] yes, i guess i just need to keep a list of pids (need to do this for wait anyway) [01:45:26]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[01:46:37] but suspend isnt available in sh, it seems [01:46:37]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	charles81	[01:46:51] My memory is fuzzy on the details but can't you use job numbers? I'd have to check but I think they die if the parent process dies unless you "nohup" them [01:46:51]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	charles81	[01:47:56] bash -c "suspend; <command>" & [01:47:56]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[02:00:10] unrelated question: how do you extract characters from a string in a posix way? [02:00:10]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	charles81	[02:01:32] Cut -c<n1>-<n2> [02:01:32]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[02:02:33] well yes, but is there a shell-only way? [02:02:33]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[02:02:47] in bash, we have ${foo:0:1} etc [02:02:47]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[02:05:25] maybe its possible with ${foo#[bar]} etc [02:05:25]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Ouroboros	[02:18:39] nope, doesnt seem useful [02:18:39]

2016-10-31 20:18:01	geirha	Ouroboros: you "always" want read -r. Without it, read will eat backslashes
2016-10-31 20:18:13	geirha	!read-r
2016-10-31 20:18:13	greybot	By default, if ''read'' reads a line of input terminated by a backslash (\), it will *continue* reading lines of input until the first line not terminated by "\", or it hits EOF and then concatenate those lines into a single line. This is a dumb misfeature. So *always* use the -r option with ''read'', unless you know you have a case when you want the default behavior, or when using the bash-only ''read -e''.

2016-11-01 01:46:44	AlecTaylor	The default value of IFS is space, tab, newline. (A three-character string.) If IFS is unset, it acts as though it were set to this default value.

2016-11-01 01:49:09	Riviera	AlecTaylor: If the fields are separated by whitespace you could either use "unset IFS" before the loop or trust that it's set to the default value (which it is by default in scripts).

2016-11-01 01:58:01	timvisher	Riviera: yes exactly
2016-11-01 01:58:13	Riviera	Here the exit code is 0 even though false's exit code is not -- because the exit code reflects that "local" was successful.
2016-11-01 01:58:26	timvisher	anyway this is easy to try so i'll just experiment :)
2016-11-01 01:58:30	Riviera	So if one *wants* to check false's exit code two steps are necessary:
2016-11-01 01:58:36	Riviera	# timvisher () { local var; var=$(false); echo "$?"; }; timvisher

2016-11-01 12:05:43	greybot	Bash has two types of variables. Shell Variables (foo=bar) live in the running shell and are copied to subshells. Environment Variables (export foo=bar) are special variables that live in a PROCESS and are copied to each new process it creates. They are used the same way but CREATED differently. Env vars are NOT system-wide or "shared" in any way. http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Environment

2016-11-01 14:16:11	twkm	some would never use /tmp/ because it makes something visible and if enough care isn't taken can even expose the data.
2016-11-01 14:16:19	DizzyDude	My issue is that I have 3 arrays. 1 Array has usernames. 2nd array has a counter of the number of times the user logged in the system. The third the total logged in time. Depending on the argument passed I need to sort the username. The issue is that I keep track of the user data using indexes. So user on index 0 has all its data on the position 0 of the other arrays.

2016-11-01 14:16:49	twkm	loonoids seem to be using tmpfs for it, which severely limits the space and can do bad things to a running system if you were to fill it.

2016-11-01 14:24:12	charles81	the good thing about using "/tmp" is that if your programs creates some temp files and fails to clean them up here and there over time, the admins should generally feel safe killing them from "/tmp" now and again while putting them elsewhere could fill up space in that filesystem but another admin might not necessarily know they can be safely deleted.
