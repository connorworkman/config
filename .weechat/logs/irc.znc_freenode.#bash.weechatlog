2016-10-17 14:40:01	impermanence	I have an array of ips.  Then I have a script that iterates over the array in groups of 50 and runs an ssh command on each ip in parallel, if that makes sense.  Basically...it runs an ssh command on 50 ips at the same time.  What I notice is, though, is that all of these ssh commands are tied to the same PID.  Is this bad?  I assume it is...

2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:25:31] find ... -print0 | xargs -0 command    is safe [05:25:31]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:25:43] yeah, I know that one [05:25:43]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:25:47] but -0 is not standard, though at least the GNU and BSD implementations have it [05:25:47]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:25:54] aha [05:25:54]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:27:42] I still cannot understand why sometimes you need multiple backslashes on a command [05:27:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:28:25] let's say: printf %b `printf \\\\%03o "$@"` [05:28:25]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:40:01] `` eats a layer of backslashes [05:40:01]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:40:47] while $() does not. One of the reasons why $() is recommended over `` [05:40:47]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:41:17] aha [05:41:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:42:34] still I don't understand why you need so many backslashes, if you want a single backslash, you escape it with another backslash and you're done, no? [05:42:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	 *	tsakos [05:42:54] scratches head [05:42:54]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:43:56] `` eats one, one is used to quote, and printf's format string eats one [05:43:56]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:44:12] printf %b "$(printf '\\%03o' "$@")" [05:44:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:45:42] it works with 3 backslashes [05:45:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:46:04] # printf '\%03o' 32 [05:46:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	shbot	[05:46:05] geirha: \040 [05:46:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:46:19] since \% is not special, it gets unchanged by printf [05:46:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:46:21] I mean with the backquotes etc. [05:46:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:46:27] So   printf %b "$(printf '\%03o' "$@")" [05:46:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:47:10] this prints nothing tome [05:47:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:47:12] to me* [05:47:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:47:35] printf %b "$(printf '\\\%03o' "$@")" [05:47:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:47:39] this one works [05:47:39]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:47:45] Well, with   printf %b `printf \\\\%03o "$@"`   first `` eats its share, turning it into    printf \\%03o ... [05:47:45]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:47:51] weird.. [05:47:51]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:48:10] then regular parsing takes it, turning it into printf \%03o [05:48:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:48:37] and then printf is run with that, and printf doesn't change \% since it's not special [05:48:37]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:49:14] hmm [05:49:14]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:49:52] # printf %s `printf \\\\\\\\` [05:49:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	shbot	[05:49:53] geirha: \ [05:49:53]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:50:24] where can I read on that matter? [05:50:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:50:35] is there any good article on this? [05:50:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	geirha	[05:50:41] man bash [05:50:41]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:50:48] ok [05:50:48]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:54:20] The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed  by  one  of the following characters: $, `, ", \, or <newline>. [05:54:20]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:54:34] that means \$ is special for example? [05:54:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	tsakos	[05:54:58] everything else is well understood, just this part [05:54:58]

2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[09:38:02] enzotib: indeed, it would be faster but then you need a for loop in your bash code i.e. -exec bash -c 'for f; do mv -- "$f" ...; done' _ {} + [09:38:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	enzotib	[09:38:22] uhm, right [09:38:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	geirha	[09:39:19] and   -name '*.uct*' ! -name "*.uct0"   to avoid renaming uct0 to uct0 [09:39:19]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	gryffus	[09:45:13] KnightsWhoSayNi: hmm, the command is taking forever... perhaps it's not a good idea to use globstar on few hundred recursive directories? [09:45:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	gryffus	[09:47:20] KnightsWhoSayNi: also it does not work as intended, it is just adding .uct0 extension to the files [09:47:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[09:49:07] # f="foo.utc"; d="${f%.*}.utc0"; echo "$d" [09:49:07]

2016-10-18 00:14:24	KnightsWhoSayNi	[09:49:31] hmm might be better to use a find instead then... but the parameter expansion should be fine [09:49:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[09:49:35] should be no problem with that. a glob could be slow in this case, though. see !findloop in that case. [09:49:35]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	gryffus	[09:50:07] KnightsWhoSayNi: leaving the hashes i want to remove there [09:50:07]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[09:50:30] !extension > gryffus [09:50:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	greybot	[09:50:30] gryffus: Use parameter expansion: ext=${filename##*.} noext=${filename%.*} [09:50:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[09:51:42] note that {f%.*} will remove the shortest match. so "foo.utc.utc0", say, would become "foo.utc", not "foo" [09:51:42]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[09:52:29] # f="foo.bar.baz"; echo "${f%.*} ${f%%.*}" [09:52:29]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	shbot	[09:52:30] kerframil: foo.bar foo [09:52:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[09:53:19] you'd need the latter to be equivalent to your cut -d example [09:53:19]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[09:57:32] this is similar to your original attempt (without some newbie mistakes): while IFS= read -rd '' f; do mv -- "$f" "${f%%.*}.utc0"; done < <(find -type f -name '*.utc*' -print0) [09:57:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	gryffus	[10:00:04] the problem was that i had 2 dots in file names (which i didn't noticed first)... solved with f% [10:00:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	tsakos	[10:00:19] what exactly does while read line && [ " " "<" "$line" ]; do .... do? [10:00:19]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	gryffus	[10:00:22] but i will sure try advice provided from kerframil ... [10:00:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	gryffus	[10:00:52] s/f%/f% [10:00:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[10:00:57] gryffus: that's explained above. %.* wasn't the same as cut -d'.' -f1 [10:00:57]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[10:01:15] gryffus: in your case, %%.* would do it [10:01:15]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	gryffus	[10:01:35] kerframil: yeah, my irc is stripping double % apparently [10:01:35]

2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[10:04:57] tsakos: < performs a lexical comparison. but that only makes sense within [[ ]]. for example [[ "!" > " " ]] is true, because ! has a higher ordinal number than a space character (33 vs 32). [10:04:57]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	KnightsWhoSayNi	[10:05:36] kerframil: it makes sense with [/test too according to its help page [10:05:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[10:05:43] tsakos: < " " would encompass special control characters. look at an ascii chart, if you don't get it. [10:05:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[10:06:21] KnightsWhoSayNi: yes, but you're looking at the bash built-in. look at the man page for (posix) [ and it's a different story. I realise that bash will permit it anyway. [10:06:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	KnightsWhoSayNi	[10:06:28] ahh i see [10:06:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:24	gryffus	[10:06:39] kerframil: BTW, why do you add the "--" between rm and its arguments? [10:06:39]

2016-10-18 00:14:24	kerframil	[10:09:15] tsakos: in short, it looks like the intention is to break the loop as soon as any line is encountered that begins with a control character [10:09:15]

2016-10-18 02:38:06	greybot	You can't parse structured languages like HTML or XML using bash, grep, sed, cut, etc. Look into xmllint, xmlstarlet, xpath, xsltproc, ... Eg. xmllint --xpath '//person[@name="bob"]/salary/text()' - <<< '<staff><person name="bob"><salary>70000</salary></person></staff>' -- Ask #xml for XPath/XSLT help, that is not a #bash question.

2016-10-18 05:24:54	greybot	Don't use extensions for your scripts. Scripts define new commands that you can run, and commands are generally not given extensions. Do you run ls.elf? Also: bash scripts are *not* sh scripts (so don't use .sh) and the extension will only cause dependencies headaches if the script gets rewritten in another language.

2016-10-18 07:11:06	greycat	Why use bash?  Just write the entire thing in Tcl/expect.

2016-10-18 07:18:32	greycat	If you're reading find output, there *is no* sorting.  find uses raw directory order.  Any appearance of sorting is coincidence.
2016-10-18 07:18:32	Neville	greycat: I tried piping sort -z; yet it did not resolve my desired effect.
2016-10-18 07:18:47	greycat	You'll have to sort the output yourself.  E.g. by piping to sort.
2016-10-18 07:19:06	veleno	greycat: it is a bash script that embeds an expect script.
2016-10-18 07:19:16	greycat	veleno: well, stop doing that.
2016-10-18 07:19:39	greycat	Writing a project in two languages is always awkward, especially if one of them is bash.
2016-10-18 07:20:10	greycat	Tcl is enormously superior to bash, and you've got it for free because expect uses it.

2016-10-18 15:02:18	kerframil	further, it could be that that a standard user is unable to peruse root's processes in Linux (proc mounted with hidepid=[1|2], /proc restrictions in grsecurity, SELinux ... etc), in which case one might get different results depending on whether the script is run as root or not. also, the permissions of the pid file can matter.

2016-10-18 19:37:57	geirha	!$*
2016-10-18 19:37:57	greybot	The difference between $@ and $*: Without quotes (don't do this!), there is no difference. With double quotes, "$@" expands to each positional parameter as its own argument: "$1" "$2" ..., while "$*" expands to the single argument "$1c$2c...", where 'c' is the first character of IFS. You almost always want "$@" (QUOTED!). The same goes for arrays: "${array[@]}".

2016-10-18 19:39:44	tsakos	basically I'm doing a simple argument parser, so I do something like this: arg_parse "arguments_expected_syntax" "arguments"

2016-10-18 23:55:23	jeffreylevesque	[04:18:12] so, basically when my vm builds, i mount my source directory [04:18:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	jeffreylevesque	[04:18:21] then the inotifywait services are started [04:18:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	jeffreylevesque	[04:18:31] then i `touch` all the files, that should be watched [04:18:31]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	jeffreylevesque	[04:18:47] out of the 4 services i have, only one stops working after the touch [04:18:47]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	jeffreylevesque	[04:19:07] and requires that i reboot the entire vm, then it works endlessly [04:19:07]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	jeffreylevesque	[04:19:10] is that weird? [04:19:10]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	jeffreylevesque	[04:25:59] anyone here use puppetserver / foreman? [04:25:59]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	jeffreylevesque	[04:26:04] whoops wrong channel [04:26:04]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Sumset	[04:57:33] Thanks I solved it with: sed 's/^{\[\(.*\)\],\[.*\]}./\1/' <<< '{['item1','item2'],['item1','item2']}.' | awk -F ',' '{print NF}' [04:57:33]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:32:18] Hey guys, I is it safe to pass parameters into a function? [05:32:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:32:37] do I need to check something beforing passing them? [05:32:37]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:33:08] I mean every parameter the script was executed with [05:33:08]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:33:18] $* in this case [05:33:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	geirha	[05:37:32] $* is always wrong [05:37:32]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:37:51] Well, I don't really know the difference between $* and $@ [05:37:51]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	geirha	[05:37:57] !$* [05:37:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	greybot	[05:37:57] The difference between $@ and $*: Without quotes (don't do this!), there is no difference. With double quotes, "$@" expands to each positional parameter as its own argument: "$1" "$2" ..., while "$*" expands to the single argument "$1c$2c...", where 'c' is the first character of IFS. You almost always want "$@" (QUOTED!). The same goes for arrays: "${array[@]}". [05:37:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:38:52] hm, so I want to have arguments sent as positional parameters... right [05:38:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:39:44] basically I'm doing a simple argument parser, so I do something like this: arg_parse "arguments_expected_syntax" "arguments" [05:39:44]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:40:33] I'm doing it because I want multiple options into arguments [05:40:33]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	geirha	[05:42:13] not sure what you mean by that [05:42:13]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:42:27] for example --move file1 file2 [05:42:27]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:42:57] also want to have long as well as short arguments [05:42:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	A124	[05:46:40] Hey. What is the best way to iterate pairs of arguments in loop? [05:46:40]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	A124	[05:47:35] args="a b c d e f"; ... iterate on: a b, c d, e f [05:47:35]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[05:48:00] do whatever with $1 (echo, if test, etc) and shift [05:48:00]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	geirha	[05:48:13] make up your mind, do you want to iterate arguments, or words in a string? [05:48:13]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	A124	[05:50:43] Arguments. [05:50:43]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	geirha	[05:50:43] tsakos: Ok, so a loop like in faq 35 should suffice [05:50:43]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	geirha	[05:51:05] while (( $# > 0 )); do printf '%s %s\n' "$1" "$2"; shift 2; done [05:51:05]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	A124	[05:52:10] Nice. built-in. [05:52:10]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	A124	[05:52:12] Thank you. [05:52:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[06:12:25] geirha: what you think about checking an array for existance with ${#myarray[@]} when not even set? [06:12:25]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[06:13:23] returns 0, no error at all, so I think it's cool, right? [06:13:23]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[06:14:12] if [ ${#myarray[@]} -ne 0 ]; then fill array.. [06:14:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tsakos	[06:14:24] s/ne/eq/ [06:14:24]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	geirha	[07:17:07] tsakos: and if it's empty, what then? [07:17:07]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	pennTeller	[07:30:36] Hi guys, can anybody recommend a script that uploads a folder of pictures to Facebook? [07:30:36]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Stummi	[07:31:38] pennTeller, a quick search for facebook in my package manager shows that theres a python implementation for FB's API. Maybe you can make use of this [07:31:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	geirha	[07:31:39] Can't you just drag and drop it? [07:31:39]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	pennTeller	[07:33:31] Stummi,  thanks a lot I will search for that [07:33:31]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	pennTeller	[07:33:59] geirha, yes you can but I am making a program in python where you can take a picture and save it to  folder that uploads to Facebook every few minuts [07:33:59]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	alxtb	[08:12:34] Hi, what's wrong with this for loop: for (( i=$numlines); i>0; i-- )) - I get unexpected operatior "=" as the error [08:12:34]

2016-10-19 00:49:59	Muyfret	another script that would be nice is to snatch up all desktop files of an extension (like .txt) and quickly stuff them in a folder. then encrypt the folder. there are times i have to spend like 15 minutes cleaning up my desktop so it's appropriate and safe to show others
2016-10-19 00:50:52	geirha	then surely you should encrypt the jpegs and mpegs first

2016-10-19 00:57:10	Toeie	Hi. I have a script that downloads a video and then loops it using mplayer. It downloads the new video if a newer one is available. I was thinking about running this script on boot, and use a cronjob to reboot the system every day. So basically the boot script would be > download video > play using mplayer (loop infinite) > cron reboots every night
2016-10-19 00:57:22	Toeie	Would that be a good idea?
2016-10-19 00:57:31	HaZrD	why reboot every night?

2016-10-19 01:09:13	Toeie	I think I will have to add like a last-updated string or something, that i also save on the system, and just compare everytime the script runs

2016-10-19 02:53:23	Muyfret	anyone know what open office and google names their document files extensions?
2016-10-19 02:53:43	Vonor|Work	would you suggest this solution to rsync? the goal is to rsync an entire project (4.7 TB in round about 13 million files) to another server. the io overhead produced by rsync opening, reading, transferring all these small files is too huge for one single sync. the network can handle more
2016-10-19 02:53:52	geirha	Muyfret: Wrong channel
2016-10-19 02:54:40	Vonor|Work	so the idea was to cd into the folder with all the data dirs (255 subfolders) and rsync them in parallel with this script
2016-10-19 02:55:10	HaZrD	Vonor|Work will the receiving server be able to cope with writing 255 syncs at once?
2016-10-19 02:55:10		[02:55]
2016-10-19 02:55:14	geirha	If it's IO bound, it probably won't go much faster in parallel, but go ahead and try
2016-10-19 02:55:36	Vonor|Work	HaZrD, not 255 syncs, 3 syncs in parallel
2016-10-19 02:56:15	HaZrD	as geirha says, it's worth a try ;)
2016-10-19 02:56:50	Vonor|Work	a did a smaller round earlier. around 920 mb were rsynced in about 2 and a half minute. so if my math isn't totally wrong that would mean 9 days for the 4.7 tb

2016-10-19 05:39:27	korans	djoularef: text editor? else sed can be useful but you cant use the file your using for input as a place to write outbut so you have to make the new file and replace the old, not sure if bash has a pure bash way to do such a thing you could try looping with readline although thats gunna be more expensive than sed i would imagine
2016-10-19 05:40:29	greycat	another approach is to write a very small patch, and use patch(1)

2016-10-19 06:05:05	greycat	You don't.  You either iterate OR you dump with printf.  Not both.
2016-10-19 06:05:24	greycat	To iterate arguments, you use "for arg" or any other variable name you wish.
2016-10-19 06:05:55	greycat	# f() { for arg; do echo "<$f>"; done; } ; f ab 'hi mom'

2016-10-19 06:09:05	greycat	Yes there is.  "$@" is correctly split.

2016-10-19 08:54:14	greybot	Bash is a shell. That's a program which can do simple math, logic, I/O and run other programs. It's NOT a terminal, it's not a kernel, it doesn't manage the system's authentication or environment, it's not your OS and it's not X, KDE or Gnome.

2016-10-19 09:14:54	guardian	what's an efficient way to find all files named "*.foo" that contain the pattern "bar". I would find | xargs grep but I'm not sure it's the way to go
2016-10-19 09:15:18	guardian	well not that I crave for performance, I'm trying to slowly absorb what a seasoned bash user would write
2016-10-19 09:15:34	geirha	find ... -exec grep ... {} +
2016-10-19 09:15:51	geirha	!xargs
2016-10-19 09:15:51	greybot	xargs(1) is dangerous (broken, exploitable, etc.) when reading non-NUL-delimited input. If you're working with filenames, use find's -exec [command] {} + instead. If you can get NUL-delimited output, use xargs -0. Otherwise, you probably want a while read or for loop instead.

What I am specifically trying to do is to create a QR code for each file I add in a specific folder.  So what I would need to do is: Detect when a file is added to folder, grab base filename and pass to qrencode -o basename.png mysite.com/basename.ext
2016-10-19 10:08:44	greycat	If this is on linux, look at the linux specific montoring stuff.

2016-10-19 10:08:47	greybot	inotifywait is a shell interface to the Linux inotify API for filesystem events. inotifywait isn't safe for robust scripts because it can't output nul delimiters. Better cross-platform alternatives are watchdog (python) and System.IO.FileSystemWatcher (mono/.NET) which both support inotify, kqueue, Windows fs events, etc. https://github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools/
