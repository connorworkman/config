2016-10-17 14:40:01	impermanence	I have an array of ips.  Then I have a script that iterates over the array in groups of 50 and runs an ssh command on each ip in parallel, if that makes sense.  Basically...it runs an ssh command on 50 ips at the same time.  What I notice is, though, is that all of these ssh commands are tied to the same PID.  Is this bad?  I assume it is...
