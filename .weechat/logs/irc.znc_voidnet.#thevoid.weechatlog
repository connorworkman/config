2016-10-17 17:39:26	voidead	oh wait
2016-10-17 17:39:33	voidead	to control it from the outside?

2016-10-17 17:39:36	voidead	yeah
2016-10-17 17:39:38	+Anna	lol
2016-10-17 17:39:43	voidead	and you need to make sure those ports are open
2016-10-17 17:39:46	voidead	obviously
2016-10-17 17:39:52	halfwit	They best be :p
2016-10-17 17:40:01	voidead	yeah but I hate opening ports
2016-10-17 17:40:30	voidead	so what I do is have one port open for the stream only and just SSH into the computer via juiceSSH to control it
2016-10-17 17:40:35	halfwit	There, it works.
2016-10-17 17:40:59	alyptik	i run nftables to keep my ports safe
2016-10-17 17:41:00	halfwit	Oh, that's a good plan too.
2016-10-17 17:41:09	alyptik	thought closed is far safer than open to begin with
2016-10-17 17:41:12	+Anna	hopefully my weechat telling me about the bitrate.. ffprobe says 'Duration: 00:11:33.44, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 3953 kb/s' thats the thing that comes up with a preset program

2016-10-17 17:42:07	halfwit	alyptik: For sure, when you can manage it
2016-10-17 17:42:09	voidead	you can control how many
2016-10-17 17:42:20	halfwit	Yours is set to 0 in the thing you showed, so unlimited
2016-10-17 17:42:26	voidead	halfwit› but I'm not sure if MPD has a hard coded limit or not
2016-10-17 17:42:39	voidead	halfwit› 0?
2016-10-17 17:42:43	alyptik	defaults to 5 i think

2016-10-17 17:46:11	voidead	and then it will shuffle
2016-10-17 17:46:34	halfwit	I could make playlists for every album like I used to, but
2016-10-17 17:46:35	voidead	I like the playlist format.. because there are songs I don't feel like listening to so I remove them
2016-10-17 17:47:06	voidead	I simply add every album to the playlist in ABC order and for albums which have songs I don't like I just pick and choose
2016-10-17 17:47:18	halfwit	Changing song only take a moment here
2016-10-17 17:47:34	halfwit	This is bearable

2016-10-18 13:40:31	halfwit	Are you on weechat, also? alt+l is handy
