2016-10-17 17:39:26	voidead	oh wait
2016-10-17 17:39:33	voidead	to control it from the outside?

2016-10-17 17:39:36	voidead	yeah
2016-10-17 17:39:38	+Anna	lol
2016-10-17 17:39:43	voidead	and you need to make sure those ports are open
2016-10-17 17:39:46	voidead	obviously
2016-10-17 17:39:52	halfwit	They best be :p
2016-10-17 17:40:01	voidead	yeah but I hate opening ports
2016-10-17 17:40:30	voidead	so what I do is have one port open for the stream only and just SSH into the computer via juiceSSH to control it
2016-10-17 17:40:35	halfwit	There, it works.
2016-10-17 17:40:59	alyptik	i run nftables to keep my ports safe
2016-10-17 17:41:00	halfwit	Oh, that's a good plan too.
2016-10-17 17:41:09	alyptik	thought closed is far safer than open to begin with
2016-10-17 17:41:12	+Anna	hopefully my weechat telling me about the bitrate.. ffprobe says 'Duration: 00:11:33.44, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 3953 kb/s' thats the thing that comes up with a preset program

2016-10-17 17:42:07	halfwit	alyptik: For sure, when you can manage it
2016-10-17 17:42:09	voidead	you can control how many
2016-10-17 17:42:20	halfwit	Yours is set to 0 in the thing you showed, so unlimited
2016-10-17 17:42:26	voidead	halfwit› but I'm not sure if MPD has a hard coded limit or not
2016-10-17 17:42:39	voidead	halfwit› 0?
2016-10-17 17:42:43	alyptik	defaults to 5 i think

2016-10-17 17:46:11	voidead	and then it will shuffle
2016-10-17 17:46:34	halfwit	I could make playlists for every album like I used to, but
2016-10-17 17:46:35	voidead	I like the playlist format.. because there are songs I don't feel like listening to so I remove them
2016-10-17 17:47:06	voidead	I simply add every album to the playlist in ABC order and for albums which have songs I don't like I just pick and choose
2016-10-17 17:47:18	halfwit	Changing song only take a moment here
2016-10-17 17:47:34	halfwit	This is bearable

2016-10-18 13:33:32	halfwit	I was using DuckDNS at some point, wonder if that's still alive
2016-10-18 13:35:04	alyptik	is that ddg related?

2016-10-18 13:40:26	alyptik	yeah that is my issue atm
2016-10-18 13:40:31	halfwit	Are you on weechat, also? alt+l is handy
2016-10-18 13:41:01	alyptik	urlserver script works ok, but would like it to work without

2016-10-18 14:38:59	alyptik	Max`P› how come you are installing 8.1?
2016-10-18 14:39:28	Max`P	alyptik: I have a user unable to install our driver on it, so I'm installing it to see wtf Microsoft broke again
2016-10-18 14:39:43	Max`P	Probably some kind of bs driver enforcement from manufacturers
2016-10-18 14:40:03	alyptik	ah
2016-10-18 14:40:59	Max`P	I also need to make a MacOS installer media, but that I'll wait because adding my 500GB drive will probably kill the sata adapter again and I don't want to fuck up the two Windows VMs that are updating, it's long enough as it is lol

2016-10-18 15:27:29	Max`P	I'd still like to understand how the fuck Windows manages to have updates be so disastrous
2016-10-18 15:27:49	Max`P	I had the time to install, configure and test whatever I needed to test on Windows 8.1 before Windows 10 finished installing routine updates
2016-10-18 15:28:03	Max`P	Like, at this point, why not just fucking reinstall Windows anyway, it'll be faster
2016-10-18 15:29:22	cirkit	Windows is a disaster...I was troubleshooting an HP laptop that went from 8.1 -> 10 and upon booting to the new "upgraded" Windows got a BSOD "Unmountable boot volume" before getting a login window
2016-10-18 15:29:41	cirkit	couldn't do shit...even booting from a Win10 USB stick was stuck for hours...pile of shit

2016-10-18 15:34:42	alyptik	cirkit› it is like pulling teeth
2016-10-18 15:35:06	Max`P	Yup. It did... nothing at all. I'll have to find an ISO that already has the updates installed as usual. Fucking piece of shit
2016-10-18 15:35:20	Max`P	Still not as horrible as Mac, because hey at least Windows BOOTS, but still.

2016-10-18 16:32:16	cirkit	his suggestion to have me get OVH which is based in Quebec is a bit ridciulous
2016-10-18 16:32:40	cirkit	Max`P: these conversations are insane if you keep listening
2016-10-18 16:32:43	cirkit	lol

2016-10-18 16:33:44		[16:33]
2016-10-18 16:34:52	cirkit	Max`P: it's nice to know their behavior/lifestyle doesn't represent all of Quebec
2016-10-18 16:35:19	cirkit	you're closer to him there than me...maybe you'll run into him, but i doubt it lol
2016-10-18 16:35:23	Max`P	Jesus christ that's like the bottom of society's shithole, that's like barely above the homeless XD
2016-10-18 16:36:01	Max`P	ffs, she's pregnant and she's getting stoned like that? That's just incredibly irresponsible
2016-10-18 16:37:00	cirkit	afaik they don't smoke in front of the kids so that's good...but sometimes they'll come in the room 
2016-10-18 16:37:03	cirkit	les osti de BS

2016-10-18 16:37:47	cirkit	i imagine there are lots of families in Quebec that are les osti de BS
2016-10-18 16:37:59	Max`P	THANKFULLY not that much
2016-10-18 16:38:54	cirkit	to me it seems based on this Trois-Rivières is a shithole
2016-10-18 16:39:35	Max`P	It's not that bad, it's a decent sized city. Went there a few times, it's fine. There's some of these a bit of everywhere
2016-10-18 16:42:30	Max`P	giving orders to his wife of course, what did I expect
2016-10-18 16:42:48	Max`P	I liked bridge's hangout a whole lot more xD

2016-10-18 17:14:00	cirkit	Max`P: will child services do anything?
2016-10-18 17:14:14	cirkit	this is insane
2016-10-18 17:14:16	Max`P	Pretty sure they'd take them all on sight
2016-10-18 17:15:07	voidead	I'd say do the right thing
2016-10-18 17:15:17	voidead	those kids deserve better
2016-10-18 17:16:35	halfwit	Fucking ofb still broked.

2016-10-18 17:20:56		[17:20]
2016-10-18 17:21:06	Max`P	voidead: agreed. This guy is really lucky I don't know where he lives. If I ever know I'm very probably going to call the cops on them. As much as I don't wish trouble to people, those kids really deserves better
2016-10-18 17:21:06	+Anna	other dudes
2016-10-18 17:21:07	cirkit	wonder if those kids are getting stoned from the weed in that small apartment
2016-10-18 17:21:13	Max`P	cirkit: probably
2016-10-18 17:21:51	Max`P	cirkit: I have memories of being slightly stoned myself when I was a kid (which is why getting stoned makes me feel like my childhood with my dad)
2016-10-18 17:22:24	cirkit	Max`P: ah yeah that'll do it
2016-10-18 17:22:35	cirkit	the shit they're saying is on another level
2016-10-18 17:22:35	halfwit	Heh, "misty" memories
2016-10-18 17:22:50	cirkit	thankfully it's not that many families like this in Quebec
2016-10-18 17:23:01	Max`P	cirkit: and I consider my dad to have been very responsible with this, make sure to always be sober enough to take care of me and to not let me know what it was (I thought it was weird cigarettes)
2016-10-18 17:23:02	cirkit	with kids and new ones coming 
2016-10-18 17:23:04	cirkit	this is a disaster
2016-10-18 17:23:22	Max`P	But yeah man, give a recording of this to the police and they're fucked hard.
2016-10-18 17:23:48	cirkit	Quebec police i wonder if they'll do shit
2016-10-18 17:24:25	cirkit	best of my knowledge they don't abuse their kids physically or anything like that...i think more just fucked up living conditions 
2016-10-18 17:24:41	halfwit	Is this the obese fucks?
2016-10-18 17:25:13	cirkit	unfortunately
2016-10-18 17:25:14	cirkit	[21:29:19]< Max`P> And yeah it's really not how we live, this guy is the kind we consider as "les osti de BS". Basically a weight to society
2016-10-18 17:25:18	cirkit	les osti de BS
2016-10-18 17:26:22	Max`P	cirkit: lol yeah I live an hour of them
2016-10-18 17:26:30	Max`P	I live in Québec City
2016-10-18 17:28:15	Max`P	racist, of course
2016-10-18 17:28:33	cirkit	i'm trolling him a bit now
2016-10-18 17:28:42	cirkit	this is too funny maybe because i'm stoned too
2016-10-18 17:29:32	voidead	but you need to know their real name and about where they live not necessarily the exact address
2016-10-18 17:35:00		[17:29]
2016-10-18 17:45:12	Max`P	Yeah, I don't have anything unfortunately. And I'm going to be leaving that room, it's just too cringe for me
2016-10-18 17:46:55	Max`P	"Hmm, I feel a bit shaky tonight" "Oh shit, forgot the meds again"
2016-10-18 17:50:05	voidead	cirkit› why do you even talk to these dumb asses?

2016-10-18 18:07:18	voidead	I wouldn't want to talk to that asshole
2016-10-18 18:07:23	voidead	I'd only want to report him to the police
2016-10-18 18:09:26	cirkit	yeah
2016-10-18 18:09:56	cirkit	it's definitely all sketchy 
2016-10-18 18:11:12	cirkit	voidead: this dude is unbelievable also. He tried to argue that to avoid latency all you need to do is change your IP in a different geographical location
2016-10-18 18:11:17	cirkit	which is absurd
2016-10-18 18:11:20	cirkit	LOL
2016-10-18 18:12:12	cirkit	wouldn't get a fucking server in a Quebec data center while i'm in San Francisco bay area
