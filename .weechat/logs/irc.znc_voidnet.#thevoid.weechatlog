2016-10-17 17:39:38	+Anna	lol
2016-10-17 17:39:43	voidead	and you need to make sure those ports are open
2016-10-17 17:39:46	voidead	obviously
2016-10-17 17:39:52	halfwit	They best be :p
2016-10-17 17:40:01	voidead	yeah but I hate opening ports
2016-10-17 17:40:30	voidead	so what I do is have one port open for the stream only and just SSH into the computer via juiceSSH to control it
2016-10-17 17:40:35	halfwit	There, it works.
2016-10-17 17:40:59	alyptik	i run nftables to keep my ports safe
2016-10-17 17:41:00	halfwit	Oh, that's a good plan too.
2016-10-17 17:41:09	alyptik	thought closed is far safer than open to begin with

2016-10-17 17:42:07	halfwit	alyptik: For sure, when you can manage it
2016-10-17 17:42:09	voidead	you can control how many
2016-10-17 17:42:20	halfwit	Yours is set to 0 in the thing you showed, so unlimited
2016-10-17 17:42:26	voidead	halfwit› but I'm not sure if MPD has a hard coded limit or not
2016-10-17 17:42:39	voidead	halfwit› 0?

2016-10-17 17:46:11	voidead	and then it will shuffle
2016-10-17 17:46:34	halfwit	I could make playlists for every album like I used to, but
2016-10-17 17:46:35	voidead	I like the playlist format.. because there are songs I don't feel like listening to so I remove them
2016-10-17 17:47:06	voidead	I simply add every album to the playlist in ABC order and for albums which have songs I don't like I just pick and choose
2016-10-17 17:47:18	halfwit	Changing song only take a moment here
2016-10-17 17:47:34	halfwit	This is bearable

2016-10-18 13:40:26	alyptik	yeah that is my issue atm
2016-10-18 13:40:31	halfwit	Are you on weechat, also? alt+l is handy
2016-10-18 13:41:01	alyptik	urlserver script works ok, but would like it to work without

2016-10-18 14:38:59	alyptik	Max`P› how come you are installing 8.1?
2016-10-18 14:39:28	Max`P	alyptik: I have a user unable to install our driver on it, so I'm installing it to see wtf Microsoft broke again
2016-10-18 14:39:43	Max`P	Probably some kind of bs driver enforcement from manufacturers
2016-10-18 14:40:03	alyptik	ah
2016-10-18 14:40:59	Max`P	I also need to make a MacOS installer media, but that I'll wait because adding my 500GB drive will probably kill the sata adapter again and I don't want to fuck up the two Windows VMs that are updating, it's long enough as it is lol

2016-10-18 15:27:29	Max`P	I'd still like to understand how the fuck Windows manages to have updates be so disastrous
2016-10-18 15:27:49	Max`P	I had the time to install, configure and test whatever I needed to test on Windows 8.1 before Windows 10 finished installing routine updates
2016-10-18 15:28:03	Max`P	Like, at this point, why not just fucking reinstall Windows anyway, it'll be faster
2016-10-18 15:29:22	cirkit	Windows is a disaster...I was troubleshooting an HP laptop that went from 8.1 -> 10 and upon booting to the new "upgraded" Windows got a BSOD "Unmountable boot volume" before getting a login window
2016-10-18 15:29:41	cirkit	couldn't do shit...even booting from a Win10 USB stick was stuck for hours...pile of shit

2016-10-18 15:34:42	alyptik	cirkit› it is like pulling teeth
2016-10-18 15:35:06	Max`P	Yup. It did... nothing at all. I'll have to find an ISO that already has the updates installed as usual. Fucking piece of shit
2016-10-18 15:35:20	Max`P	Still not as horrible as Mac, because hey at least Windows BOOTS, but still.

2016-10-18 16:32:16	cirkit	his suggestion to have me get OVH which is based in Quebec is a bit ridciulous

2016-10-18 16:35:23	Max`P	Jesus christ that's like the bottom of society's shithole, that's like barely above the homeless XD
2016-10-18 16:36:01	Max`P	ffs, she's pregnant and she's getting stoned like that? That's just incredibly irresponsible
2016-10-18 16:37:00	cirkit	afaik they don't smoke in front of the kids so that's good...but sometimes they'll come in the room

2016-10-18 16:38:54	cirkit	to me it seems based on this Trois-Rivières is a shithole
2016-10-18 16:39:35	Max`P	It's not that bad, it's a decent sized city. Went there a few times, it's fine. There's some of these a bit of everywhere

2016-10-18 17:23:01	Max`P	cirkit: and I consider my dad to have been very responsible with this, make sure to always be sober enough to take care of me and to not let me know what it was (I thought it was weird cigarettes)

2016-10-18 17:23:04	cirkit	this is a disaster

2016-10-18 17:24:25	cirkit	best of my knowledge they don't abuse their kids physically or anything like that...i think more just fucked up living conditions

2016-10-19 09:52:10	voidead	halfwit› how did you manage to do that?
2016-10-19 09:52:21	+Anna	I bet mine isn't finished but it's fucking useful lol
2016-10-19 09:52:27	voidead	lol
2016-10-19 09:52:42	halfwit	voidead: Trying to sideload an update. It won't boot... I' mstill contemplating whether to grab an image from Google, see if I can't flash the OG firmware
2016-10-19 09:53:35	voidead	so I just got this Toshiba TB external drive.. has a NTFS filesystem on it
2016-10-19 09:53:50	voidead	can I just make it a different filesystem?
2016-10-19 09:53:58	voidead	or will there be issues?
2016-10-19 09:54:12	voidead	I removed fucking 200MB of bloatware that was on it
2016-10-19 09:54:17	halfwit	It will work with less things out of the box
2016-10-19 09:54:27	halfwit	Like Windows, they bitch a lot when you have other FS's
2016-10-19 09:54:39	voidead	well fuck windows
2016-10-19 09:54:49	voidead	I don't have windows installed on anything
2016-10-19 09:54:59	Max`P	voidead: at least Windows boots, and doesn't brick laptops.
2016-10-19 09:55:20	voidead	Max`P› if you are referring to MacOS... then yeah
2016-10-19 09:55:45	voidead	I'm glad I have no need for mac or windows
2016-10-19 09:55:50	voidead	they both can suck my dick
2016-10-19 09:57:31	halfwit	Agreed :( 
2016-10-19 09:58:37	voidead	so would it be ill advised to reformat the drive to be another filesystem?
2016-10-19 09:59:20	Max`P	voidead: what do you mean?
2016-10-19 09:59:48	herring	i did with my external d
2016-10-19 09:59:48	Max`P	Ah, yes, you can make it whatever you want
2016-10-19 09:59:50	herring	wd
2016-10-19 09:59:57	voidead	would changing the filesystem to something other than NTFS cause it to brick.. is what I'm saying
2016-10-19 09:59:58	Max`P	My drivers are all btrfs now
2016-10-19 10:00:02	herring	first thing i did was make it ext4
2016-10-19 10:00:02		[10:00]
2016-10-19 10:00:06	Max`P	No, drives are just block devices
2016-10-19 10:00:20	voidead	ah ok
2016-10-19 10:00:31	voidead	yeah ext4 is exactly what I want
2016-10-19 10:00:32	Max`P	All USB disks are just a SATA-to-USB adapter, you can do whatever the fuck you want with them
2016-10-19 10:01:14	herring	yeah its just a regular toshiba sata drive in there
2016-10-19 10:01:30	herring	my external wd came with a wd red in it
2016-10-19 10:01:44	voidead	one other thing I've been curious about.. so after you unmount the drive.. its still spinning.. well doesn't it kind of fuck it up a bit when you pull out immediately and it makes that beep sound?
2016-10-19 10:04:07	herring	not sure about that.. mine doesnt ever beep.. i dont have any problem just unplugging it even without unmounting
2016-10-19 10:04:19	herring	willy fucking nilly
2016-10-19 10:05:40	herring	its hooked up to the c1 though.. doesnt get unmounted 90% because i end just unplugging the c1 since it has no power switch
2016-10-19 10:05:41	voidead	mine beeps sometimes and sometimes it doesn't beep
2016-10-19 10:05:58	voidead	I'm assuming because its still rotating
2016-10-19 10:06:03	herring	of the time*
2016-10-19 10:06:04	voidead	even though its unmounted
2016-10-19 10:06:28	voidead	I wonder if I should just wait for it to stop rotating or something before physically removing it?
2016-10-19 10:07:02	herring	couldnt hurt i guess
2016-10-19 10:07:35	herring	let me know how that drive goes.. i almost bought it instead this wd.. 
2016-10-19 10:07:45	herring	cause it was cheaper
2016-10-19 10:07:53	herring	and looked cooler
2016-10-19 10:08:07	herring	you got the cool looking one right?
2016-10-19 10:09:24	herring	never had a toshiba drive though so ended up with the wd
2016-10-19 10:10:02	voidead	yeah mine is nice actually
2016-10-19 10:10:13	voidead	I had a choice between that and the Samsung drive.. but fuck Samsung
2016-10-19 10:10:19	voidead	proprietary faggots
2016-10-19 10:10:30	+Anna	It sure is expensive i'm told...Trois-Rivières is cheapest in Québec this year

2016-10-19 14:34:34	Max`P	[00:27:58] If you install something like Ubuntu, the fonts are quite good right out of the box seriously :P [00:27:58]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	haavard	[00:28:17] Max`P: but muh pacman [00:28:17]

2016-10-19 14:34:34	haavard	[00:29:22] amen [00:29:22]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:29:23] i think my new job uses Ubuntu so will have to use apt-get sadly [00:29:23]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:29:30] well at least Ubuntu is on systemd [00:29:30]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	haavard	[00:30:10] I don't get how anyone can argue they have a better package manager than pacman [00:30:10]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:30:18] yeah for reals [00:30:18]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	haavard	[00:30:31] Like, the ease of use, not only when installing packages and shit but also for modifying packages, creating your own packages etc. [00:30:31]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:30:33] i simply type 'pm -S <package> and voila install [00:30:33]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	haavard	[00:30:35] It just works really well [00:30:35]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:30:45] none of those long ass apt-get commands (although i guess you could still alias for shorter :P) [00:30:45]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:31:20] search in Ubuntu: apt-cache search "package" [00:31:20]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:31:29] search in Arch: pm -Ss "package" [00:31:29]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	Max`P	[00:31:29] Only thing I wish Arch had is s bit more package splitting. Not like Debian crazy splitting, but just a little bit more [00:31:29]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:31:31] much shorter [00:31:31]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	Max`P	[00:31:56] So that say, installing ffmpeg doesn't pull in a whole DE with it [00:31:56]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:32:26] i hate that with Debian uninstalling one thing will then have you uninstall 200 more things [00:32:26]

If you don't know what a data serialization format is, think of it as a way to translate a programmatic data structure (lists, arrays, dictionaries, etc) into a format that can be easily stored to disk. The file can then be used to recreate the structure at a later point. JSON is another popular data serialization format, but YAML is much easier to read.

2016-10-19 17:22:22	Max`P	Having that in front absorbs most of the wave so the sound is clearee

2016-10-19 19:08:40	bridgesfreezefirst	you may be right

2016-10-20 14:53:24	Max`P	That's why parallel downloads are having a comeback: that allows to stuff more in the same link, with other connections practically not even fighting for bandwidth
2016-10-20 14:54:01	cirkit	yeah, that should be really nice
2016-10-20 14:55:00	prg	voidead: it can be interesting to see their point of view on shit.. and pretty funny memes get posted

2016-10-20 15:07:01	herring	and ive had more issues in the last couple updates then that whole time
2016-10-20 15:07:30	herring	with stereostypical arch breakage
2016-10-20 15:07:43	herring	this is how people imagine archlinux to be
2016-10-20 15:07:46	cirkit	you using that suckless bullshit?
2016-10-20 15:07:50	herring	now i understand
2016-10-20 15:07:51	cirkit	haven't had shit break in Arch for years
2016-10-20 15:08:03	herring	termite
2016-10-20 15:09:27	herring	someone said its a termite bug but it does the same shit with other terminals
2016-10-20 15:09:39	herring	downgrading vte3-ng works for me as far as colors
2016-10-20 15:09:44	herring	but i dont want to have to downgrade shit
2016-10-20 15:09:57	herring	and i havent figured out why mpv is broken
2016-10-20 15:10:07	herring	been using vlc instead for now
2016-10-20 15:10:13	herring	until i feel like fucking with it
2016-10-20 15:10:20	herring	probably will end up downgrading more shit
2016-10-20 15:11:52	cirkit	just checked the deps for mpv under Arch
2016-10-20 15:11:59	cirkit	hell of a lot of libs
2016-10-20 15:12:17	cirkit	my guess is it isn't finding the correct library version
2016-10-20 15:12:20	herring	someone mentioned netcdf
2016-10-20 15:12:29	herring	i tried downgrading that but it didnt work
2016-10-20 15:14:48	cirkit	wonder what `ldd mpv` shows
2016-10-20 15:15:34	herring	error: target not found: ldd
2016-10-20 15:17:59	herring	ill jack with it later

2016-10-20 15:34:25	herring	ah
2016-10-20 15:34:37	herring	i didnt actually downgrade netcdf
2016-10-20 15:34:47	herring	i just reinstalled the new version
2016-10-20 15:34:53	herring	downgrading taht did indeed fix mpv

2016-10-20 17:28:53	MacinJonPlus	I basically have to pay for rent, groceries, whatever else comes my way. Girlfriend had an issue with her taxes about her getting put into a tax bracket so she owes like a grand (profit sharing from previous work place), and then I also have to pay back my federal loans too. If I don't work, I don't eat. This semester sucks ass haha
2016-10-20 17:29:11	halfwit	voidead: When I was moving my music over, it crashed. Lost all but my A bands :)
2016-10-20 17:29:12	MacinJonPlus	no loans either. Only one course thankfully

2016-10-20 17:30:24	halfwit	Then got a phone call, apparently it was too suspicious
2016-10-20 17:30:28	halfwit	Bullshit -_-;

2016-10-20 17:33:18	halfwit	voidead: I mean, I get the wages for the hours work. EI is like something you can apply for to get more money from the government, based on the hours you work. (Think UI in the states, I guess)

2016-10-20 17:45:14	MHD	its all memes
2016-10-20 17:47:48	MHD	also because it was done most prolifically by chile/argentina dictatorships against dissidents, the dissidents being overwhelmingly communists
2016-10-20 17:50:13	MacinJonPlus	the real question being
2016-10-20 17:50:23	MacinJonPlus	incorrigible bigotry or galloping through the battle ruins
2016-10-20 17:51:32	voidead	Incorrigible Bigotry is awesome
2016-10-20 17:51:36	MHD	one of them is significantly better than the other and i forget which
2016-10-20 17:51:57	MHD	probably galloping

2016-10-20 17:59:27	voidead	MHD› you always compare albums.. I don't
2016-10-20 17:59:40	MHD	yeah i guess im just inclined that way

2016-10-20 18:00:51	MacinJonPlus	heirs to perdition and archaic invincibility are incredible. Definite recommend. No matter what the occasion, be it flogging the cargo or staying the nubian archer. It's all up to you, Arghoslent are there at the right time no matter what your needs.
2016-10-20 18:01:07	halfwit	voidead: There's just "songs I like", sometimes that's every one on the album, sometimes that's not

2016-10-21 17:35:46	voidead	it had nothing to do with the code

2016-10-21 17:36:22	voidead	I could understand if it was something related to the code and it was a real issue that needed to be fixed.. but this was just some bullshit

2016-10-21 17:45:35	Max`P	It's my watercooling pump that's just insanely loud. Needs replacing, and needs actual cooling fluid
2016-10-21 17:45:47	+Anna	no good reason and shit.. and pretty funny grabs on some dank now
2016-10-21 17:46:04	halfwit	Oh, water cooling, nice
2016-10-21 17:47:57	Max`P	It's not for me. The maintenance...
2016-10-21 17:51:18	halfwit	That's understandable.
2016-10-21 17:52:52	Max`P	But yeah the thing is I bought this PC with the watercooling already installed and all. I didn't know that shit needed maintenance, so I let it run for a year or two, almost daily. Eventually it started having rocks developing in the tubes, clogging everything. So I had to flush it, even changed the pump to a spare one that came with the computer. 
2016-10-21 17:52:52	Max`P	Both make that "I'm working hard to pump that liquid" buzzing sound
2016-10-21 17:53:23	halfwit	Hm, that sounds like you need a really good flush

2016-10-21 17:56:43	halfwit	i bet you can calibrate some smart recording software to cancel that 
2016-10-21 17:57:28	Max`P	Tried. Almost got it, but my sound card actually only records mono. 
2016-10-21 17:57:35	halfwit	Ah :(
2016-10-21 17:57:46	halfwit	Lol, that's useful.
2016-10-21 17:57:53	Max`P	Otherwise, I would have put a mic in the PC, one to speak into, and then adjust the levels to cancel eachother
2016-10-21 17:59:02	Max`P	Tried using another sound card for that, but then it keeps getting out of sync. Really need to be sample-perfect for this to have a remote chance of working. And still, I'm not accounting for the (variable) delay between what one mic picks up and the time it reaches the other one.

2016-10-21 18:06:22	halfwit	Fuck them. Use something else if you don't like it.
2016-10-21 18:06:56	Max`P	The fucking reason we removed chat is that there's no way on earth we can train 50 support people to fucking chat all day long and be competent enough in every domain to properly answer said fucking chats
2016-10-21 18:07:05	Max`P	Those people are selfish nuts man
2016-10-21 18:07:19	voidead	well customers.. even though they are fucking useless and dumb do pay so sadly you gotta deal with them
2016-10-21 18:07:47	halfwit	Lol
2016-10-21 18:08:22	halfwit	Stupid. Email is superior in every way, unless you're too stupid or lazy to type, that is.
2016-10-21 18:08:29	halfwit	Try getting past a fucking language barrier
2016-10-21 18:08:38	halfwit	It's non-trivial with voice, but a non-issue with email.
2016-10-21 18:12:53	Max`P	By chat it's really just those stupid "text an agent live" thing on websites
2016-10-21 18:13:33	Max`P	Except, you know, this is not IRC. People are dumb on both sides, because no company is retarded enough to hire engineers at $50/h to do chat with customers.
2016-10-21 18:19:00		[18:13]
2016-10-21 18:25:07	halfwit	Oh, yeah.
2016-10-21 18:25:41	voidead	I don't understand why people aren't using irc more 
2016-10-21 18:25:56	voidead	it has been around since before we were born
2016-10-21 18:26:03	Max`P	It sucks it's complicated it's buggy and most clients are utter trash
2016-10-21 18:26:36	voidead	I don't know irc seems to work fine though
2016-10-21 18:27:10	Max`P	And it it doesn't have most of the features people care about. I mean, it doesn't even do stuff as basic as uploading files. That's wayyyy too complicated for the average people
2016-10-21 18:28:04	Max`P	The closest we have come to have a true, compatible communication standard it was XMPP, and everyone dropped the ball so hard on that that even geeks don't give a shit about XMPP anymore it's such a pain
2016-10-21 18:28:21	voidead	lol
2016-10-21 18:28:34	Max`P	It was a pain to implement, it's a pain to get working, and there's litterally no decent client for it.
2016-10-21 18:28:57	Max`P	But it had the potential of working really, really well: it worked just like email. Give an address, bam, servers takes care of connecting people together.
2016-10-21 18:29:04	voidead	email is even older yet people use it without bitching
2016-10-21 18:29:26	Max`P	even email is too complicated for a lot of people, apparently.
2016-10-21 18:29:53	halfwit	Email was designed by the og pc masters
2016-10-21 18:30:41	voidead	then why not use everything modularly 
2016-10-21 18:30:59	voidead	irc for text email for emails etc..
2016-10-21 18:31:07	halfwit	Very smart people without existing shit legacy
2016-10-21 18:31:25	voidead	we don't need some emacs equivalent for communication.. its bloated and unnecessary
2016-10-21 18:31:36	halfwit	mhmm
2016-10-21 18:32:17	Max`P	Well, some people want to share files, some people want to have audio chats, some people want to do video chats, and some people want to do all three at the same time. And those are honestly very valid uses, that IRC can't hope to ever accomplish
2016-10-21 18:32:18	voidead	Slack is a decent idea for normal people.. but even it is shitty
2016-10-21 18:32:19	halfwit	though i like the idea of bitchain backed
2016-10-21 18:32:47	Max`P	Tox has potential tho, if they figure out a way to not have to send freaking public keys to your friends to add you on it
2016-10-21 18:33:05	voidead	Max`P› secure email lol
2016-10-21 18:33:37	Max`P	"Hey cutie, what's your Tox address?" "Sure, that's EBC0 2F1D AC3E 4821 C123 8A65 ....."

2016-10-21 18:34:21	Max`P	If you need to use an external service to connect to someone on any service, you've already lost most people
2016-10-21 18:34:44	Max`P	Facebook: you just give your name, or your email address, or your phone number
2016-10-21 18:34:50	Max`P	Twitter: you send the username directly
2016-10-21 18:35:13	Max`P	WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, and many others: phone number
2016-10-21 18:35:18	Max`P	Snapchat: username or phone number
2016-10-21 18:35:22	Max`P	Hangouts: email address
2016-10-21 18:35:39	voidead	why not a QR code with the public key in it
2016-10-21 18:36:11	halfwit	handles are good enough
2016-10-21 18:36:30	Max`P	IRC: you need an IRC server address, a port, whether it uses SSL, whether you need to register with nickserv or not, configure SASL, and finally either a nickname OR a channel. Oh and they have to join when you happen to be on as well.
2016-10-21 18:36:31	halfwit	@cuntpunisher
2016-10-21 18:36:44	voidead	lol
2016-10-21 18:37:30	Max`P	I mean, I love IRC. But lets not kid ourselves, it's not made for the average people. It's made by geeks, for geeks, that loves to tinker with computers and do weird shit.
2016-10-21 18:37:48	Max`P	The average person wants to download an app on their phone and be done with it already, or go to a website and be done with it.
2016-10-21 18:37:59	voidead	yeah but still it can be popular and useful regardless
2016-10-21 18:38:11	Max`P	Sure, but expecting family and friends to be on it is a lost cause
2016-10-21 18:38:44	voidead	I guess thats why I am using Slack for them
2016-10-21 18:38:58	halfwit	My family can text or call if they need something
2016-10-21 18:39:13	halfwit	Lol
2016-10-21 18:39:17	halfwit	I'm a bad family member.
2016-10-21 18:39:57	voidead	I use Kakao talk to call my family.. its free
2016-10-21 18:40:20	halfwit	But for online, hell a handle is really all you need.
2016-10-21 18:40:22	voidead	its an amazing skype alternative
2016-10-21 18:40:23	Max`P	Yeah my family just text me. It's ancient technology but it works.
2016-10-21 18:40:33	halfwit	Max`P: Again, simple text :p
2016-10-21 18:40:37	halfwit	Lol 
2016-10-21 18:41:12	Max`P	My sister talks to me on Facebook tho, works great. Messenger is very good to be honest, I don't mind it at all. The only issue it has is it's made by Facebook, but other than that it's pretty good
2016-10-21 18:41:55	halfwit	It does phone home a lot, but other than that
2016-10-21 18:41:57	halfwit	I mean, what else does
2016-10-21 18:42:11	halfwit	doesnt*
2016-10-21 18:42:17	Max`P	Well it's a centralized service so it's kind of necessary anyway
2016-10-21 18:42:34	halfwit	Max`P: Yeah. I used to type angry comments, then delete them for therapy
2016-10-21 18:42:38	Max`P	I wish XMPP had one, but for that it would have needed to now be an utter piece of shit
2016-10-21 18:42:47	halfwit	Max`P: Never realized it was sending that
2016-10-21 18:43:17	Max`P	hahaha, oops
2016-10-21 18:43:23	Max`P	Yeah, it only deletes it on your side.
2016-10-21 18:43:47	halfwit	I am a lot happier without Facebook
2016-10-21 18:44:02	Max`P	I'd say it depends a lot on who you have on it
2016-10-21 18:44:11	halfwit	Hm. Yeah.
2016-10-21 18:44:31	Max`P	Unlike Google+, I only friend people I actually care about and hang out with IRL. So my feed is not filled with bullshit all the time
2016-10-21 18:44:45	halfwit	That's good
2016-10-21 18:45:00	Max`P	Tho at 23 I think I'm going to start suffering from the damned baby pictures soon, but deleting people is easy on Facebook :P
2016-10-21 18:45:07	halfwit	Heh.
2016-10-21 18:45:38	halfwit	For me, it was that everyone suddenly developed these opinions, these stances on things - fairweather crusaders everywhere it seemed
2016-10-21 18:46:21	halfwit	And my feeds changed from updates on peoples' lives to nothing but photos, links, shared content
2016-10-21 18:46:37	halfwit	I don't give a flying fuck about a picture with words, when I know the person behind them barely understands the message
2016-10-21 18:46:49	halfwit	:/
2016-10-21 18:47:01	halfwit	I guess I just don't like thta it's become empty and pandering

2016-10-21 18:58:32	cirkit	yeah, gotta give those frontline people a lot of credit

2016-10-21 19:26:43	Max`P	"It is impossible for us to refund you a service that you paid for 6 months ago. Not only is it against our own policy, which you have agreed to upon registering, but none of our payment processors supports refunds after one month. After 6 months, those transactions are considered as finalized."
2016-10-21 19:27:08	Max`P	"There is also no traces of any support request nor any troubleshooting attempt on your account other than this ticket in the 4 months of support history we have, so for all we know your services have been working just fine for all this time and thus we have no reason to refund you for a service that's been working perfectly fine."
2016-10-21 19:27:42	Max`P	Seriously, who the fuck asks for a full refund after 6 months of service claiming it never worked?

2016-10-22 08:21:58	voidead	should I put my external hard drive in /etc/fstab?
2016-10-22 08:22:05	voidead	or just leave it as is
2016-10-22 08:22:17	prg	nothing wrong with putting it in fstab imo
2016-10-22 08:22:32	voidead	I guess unless I'm going to have it hooked up 24/7 there isn't any reason to have it in fstab
2016-10-22 08:22:53	voidead	just hook it up and mount it.. unmount when you are finished etc..
2016-10-22 08:22:56	prg	you can keep it in fstab with your mount options and stuff w/ noauto
2016-10-22 08:23:08	voidead	true
2016-10-22 08:23:22	prg	so you can just "mount <destination>" and it will look in fstab for the rest

2016-10-23 17:05:26	haavard	God damnit, I came up with a magical function that solves my homework, but I forgot how and I've no idea how to explain where it comes from
2016-10-23 17:06:11	Max`P	I'm doing functional programming in JS and I'm not sure if I'm doing a monster or a smart thing
2016-10-23 17:06:38	haavard	kek, functional programming is really cool, but I'm not sure how it works out in JS
2016-10-23 17:07:08	Svibrager	I have no good words to say about JavaScript, mostly because people who write it seem to love doing five hundred levels of nested functions, with 'a, b, c, d' variable names and no documentation to speak of
2016-10-23 17:07:25	Max`P	haavard: function(params, success, failure)
2016-10-23 17:07:26	Svibrager	The language itself is ok, but it seems to bring out the worst in habits haha
2016-10-23 17:07:47	Max`P	yeah it's pretty ugly, but no fibers in JS ><
2016-10-23 17:08:23	haavard	Yeah, I feel like JS attracts a lot of the self-taught brogrammers of the world, which in turn produce a bunch of crap code
2016-10-23 17:08:49	Max`P	That too.
2016-10-23 17:10:19	haavard	Where the fuck did this come from

2016-10-23 19:34:10	bridgesfreezefirst	yeah the black metal collection isn't huge because i'm not super into that genre

2016-10-23 19:42:07	Svibrager	hahah I've got a mere ... 260GB or so. You guys have me way outclassed :D But I found that I just had too much crap that I'd never listen to, so I filtered a lot of it out
2016-10-23 19:42:10	halfwit	I mean it doesn't matter if I get an invite now or later I guess
2016-10-23 19:42:23	Svibrager	It's growing again slowly, but with much better quality control
2016-10-23 19:42:33	halfwit	Svibrager: If I don't like more than a few songs, I'll blow away a whole band :P

2016-10-23 19:42:58	haavard	Svibrager, bridgesfreezefirst: what formats are your collections in?
2016-10-23 19:43:10	haavard	Like, X gb of mp3 is much more than X gb of flac
2016-10-23 19:43:20	halfwit	320kbps actually sounds nice on my shit headphones
2016-10-23 19:43:25	Svibrager	Different - from mp3 to FLAC, but mp3 mostly, averaging 320kbps for the vast majority
2016-10-23 19:43:43	halfwit	Wish I had rather good ones, but
2016-10-23 19:43:44	bridgesfreezefirst	almost all of my shit is in 320 kbps mp3
2016-10-23 19:43:45	haavard	halfwit: anything above v0 (192 kbps) is generally transparent
2016-10-23 19:43:51	bridgesfreezefirst	^exactly
2016-10-23 19:44:21	haavard	I'm a little autistic when it comes to data hoarding so all of my shit is logged FLAC if possible :p
2016-10-23 19:44:29	Svibrager	yeah; I'm not overly picky, but I think I've been listening to shit for long enough that when I hear bad mp3 compression, my ears instantly wither and revolt against it haha
2016-10-23 19:44:59	Svibrager	I used to do that as well, @haavard - but then I had a few system crashes over time, so it became a little less tidy
2016-10-23 19:46:01	Svibrager	I'd like to have a proper FLAC encoding for everything, tagged and logged etc, but at this point I don't think that's ever going to happen haha

2016-10-24 18:47:05	halfwit	I am not "in the scene" enough, so to speak, to find this obscure shit.
2016-10-24 18:47:08	halfwit	So when you guys link it, I'm thankful.
2016-10-24 18:47:55	halfwit	Or really to trawl though the thousand(s) of new music that comes out
2016-10-24 18:52:13	voidead	to be honest
2016-10-24 18:52:13		[18:52]
2016-10-24 18:52:13	voidead	its pretty dumb how some of these guys are with music
2016-10-24 18:52:33	voidead	its like a pissing contest
2016-10-24 18:52:33	voidead	its not about enjoying music
2016-10-24 18:52:44	voidead	their mindset is restrictive
2016-10-24 18:53:06	voidead	there is a lot of great music out there.. and you can find it without searching for obscure demos 
2016-10-24 18:54:23	alyptik	voidead› ++
2016-10-24 18:55:13	halfwit	I'm glad to have other people to curate it for me, honestly.
2016-10-24 18:55:18	halfwit	I know that's kinda lame
2016-10-24 18:55:29	halfwit	And I should be seeking stuff out, but damn if I can put time into it
2016-10-24 18:56:28	alyptik	nah digging is love to me, but it takes a fuckload of time; i can definitely understand someone not being able to spend hours upon hours on it
2016-10-24 18:58:26	voidead	halfwit› well the whole reason the site was made was so that people didn't have to dig for hours to find super obscure shit
2016-10-24 18:58:37	voidead	bridge really just wants everyone to enjoy this music
2016-10-24 18:58:47	halfwit	I really like his stuff
2016-10-24 18:59:09	voidead	yeah most of what he posted is stuff that you will never find
2016-10-24 18:59:28	voidead	and he posted it kind of because he wanted to store it somewhere
2016-10-24 18:59:31	halfwit	Now what I need to do is, 
2016-10-24 18:59:49	halfwit	Find some listing of good bands that aren't as obscure, but I've never found/heard or maybe forgotten
2016-10-24 19:00:49	halfwit	My memory is actually kind of shit.
2016-10-24 19:01:42	voidead	a lot of these obscure bands are obscure for a reason though
2016-10-24 19:01:44	voidead	they suck
2016-10-24 19:01:57	alyptik	lol
2016-10-24 19:02:08	halfwit	lmao
2016-10-24 19:02:47	voidead	not all obscure bands are good
2016-10-24 19:03:07	voidead	but some of these assholes think obscurity is what makes a band great
2016-10-24 19:03:37	halfwit	I think it's more, "They are mine! I found them, I'm unique, holy fuck look at me the snowflake"

2016-10-25 06:27:42	voidead	ah ok
2016-10-25 06:27:47	herring	then in your vps dashboard or whatever somewhere you can set up the reverse ip shit
2016-10-25 06:28:29	herring	reverse dns
2016-10-25 06:29:45	voidead	ah yeah
2016-10-25 06:29:51	voidead	I haven't ever done this before
2016-10-25 06:29:59	voidead	so I'll have to figure out what needs to be worked on
2016-10-25 06:30:04	voidead	also I need to setup LetsEncrypt
2016-10-25 06:30:53	voidead	so I'm trying to add the A record and it asks for "Host" and then "Value" which is my IP Address 
2016-10-25 06:30:57	voidead	but what should I put for Host?
2016-10-25 06:31:00	voidead	Linode?
2016-10-25 06:31:11	herring	on mine i have
2016-10-25 06:31:22	+Anna	well I thought plants as in food.
2016-10-25 06:31:28	herring	@ for host my vps ip for value and automatic for ttl
2016-10-25 06:32:12	voidead	ok
2016-10-25 06:32:47	voidead	that can be changed at any time right?
2016-10-25 06:32:58	voidead	I can change it to my home IP address if I wanted to as well?
2016-10-25 06:33:15	voidead	(which I don't recommend right now) lol
2016-10-25 06:33:52	herring	yeah
2016-10-25 06:33:54	herring	https://ptpb.pw/2QEn.png
2016-10-25 06:35:10	herring	then in my vps settings i pointed that ip at plib.pw
2016-10-25 06:35:24	herring	for the reverse dns
2016-10-25 06:36:18	herring	you dont have to use namecheap for dns either, you can host your own or find a dns hoster
2016-10-25 06:36:22	voidead	definitely need to get LetsEncrypt working lol
2016-10-25 06:36:28	herring	your vps might let you do your own vps too
2016-10-25 06:36:28	voidead	right
2016-10-25 06:36:36	herring	ramnode let me do my own dns
2016-10-25 06:36:48	herring	ovh apparently doesnt
2016-10-25 06:36:55	herring	if they do i couldnt figure it out so i just used namecheap
2016-10-25 06:36:57	voidead	yeah Linode has a "DNS zone"
2016-10-25 06:37:08	herring	letsencrypt takes like two seconds to set up
2016-10-25 06:37:10	herring	its easy af
2016-10-25 06:37:18	herring	just follow the aw
2016-10-25 06:43:00		[06:37]
2016-10-25 06:44:18	herring	and i think if you were to use linode for your dns, you would just plug linode's nameservers into namecheap then set up your records with what ever linode provides you to do that with
2016-10-25 06:46:38	herring	adding nameservers to namecheap is on the same page as the records, at the bottom
2016-10-25 06:49:39	voidead	ah yeah
2016-10-25 06:50:36	herring	id go with linode

2016-10-25 06:50:44	+Anna	Title: DNS Manager Overview (at www.linode.com)
2016-10-25 06:50:49	herring	pretty straight forward
2016-10-25 06:52:14	herring	plug ns1.linode.com and ns2.linode.com into namecheap, use the dns manager on linode to add your domain, set the records, and reverse dns, and thats it.. 
2016-10-25 06:52:59	voidead	yeah
2016-10-25 06:58:00		[06:52]
2016-10-25 06:59:08	Max`P	voidead: note that you can have subdomains too, so even if you point the main domain to Linode you can have a subdomain that points home if you need to
2016-10-25 07:00:54	voidead	Max`P› gotcha
2016-10-25 07:01:03	voidead	Max`P› like home.voidead.pw
2016-10-25 07:04:39	voidead	herring› alright in namecheap I changed it to "custom dns" and added linode's nameservers
2016-10-25 07:05:20	voidead	but for cname/txt/srv records I have no info on the site
2016-10-25 07:06:41	voidead	I wish this site didn't take fucking forever to load
2016-10-25 07:08:13	herring	right, you set the records on linode.. all namecheap should need is the name servers
2016-10-25 07:08:24	+Anna	coffee is good if you haven't heard about http://www.unit731.org/Experiments.html
2016-10-25 07:08:25	herring	afaik
2016-10-25 07:09:09	voidead	ok then
2016-10-25 07:09:24	voidead	so everything will be related to what I do on linode 
2016-10-25 07:11:37	herring	yeah, linodes dns manager should be the only thing you need to use now

2016-10-25 07:54:45	herring	it was working
2016-10-25 07:55:02	herring	ah
2016-10-25 07:55:35	voidead	also linode is taking too god damn long to access 
2016-10-25 07:56:21	herring	in your nginx config did you set up a server section for ssl?
2016-10-25 07:56:52	herring	i have a server section for https and for http
2016-10-25 07:57:02	herring	with http redirected to https
2016-10-25 07:57:13	voidead	I haven't even setup nginx yet
2016-10-25 07:57:21	voidead	I was thinking I'd do that after I got the certs

2016-10-25 08:05:00		[07:59]
2016-10-25 08:12:39	herring	letsencrypt should have made an sever section in your nginx config.. i think all you need to do is set your locations and have the http redirected to https with "rewrite ^ https://$server_name$request_uri? permanent;" under your http server section
2016-10-25 08:13:54	herring	should have a server listening on 443 with your letsencrypt certs and a server listening on 80 with the rewrite ^ https://$server_name$request_uri? permanent; line and your location blocks set under both
2016-10-25 08:14:15	voidead	see I've never done this shit before so I mean

2016-10-25 08:16:44	herring	the fancy index stuff doesnt apply unless you compiled nginx with that plugin

2016-10-25 08:29:29	voidead	I mean I had nginx working fine a while back
2016-10-25 08:29:35	voidead	but even with a good config
2016-10-25 08:29:44	voidead	letsencrypt is being a faggot for some reason

2016-10-25 08:30:10	halfwit	lol
2016-10-25 08:30:48	voidead	honestly I'm just glad I was able to even buy the fucking domain
2016-10-25 08:30:56	halfwit	You got a good one :p
2016-10-25 08:30:57	voidead	fucking faggot ass Korean cards
2016-10-25 08:31:15	voidead	I had to use my American bank card to get it
2016-10-25 08:32:23	halfwit	Lol really?
2016-10-25 08:32:29	voidead	yeah because
2016-10-25 08:32:42	voidead	Korean cards don't use CVC codes.. they use their own special CVC codes
2016-10-25 08:32:53	halfwit	Oh god. 
2016-10-25 08:32:59	voidead	so you literally can't buy shit you want from websites
2016-10-25 08:33:08	voidead	using these faggot Korean bank cards
2016-10-25 08:33:30	voidead	they have some really good security features but god damn
2016-10-25 08:33:46	voidead	I'm quite pissed off about Korean banks
2016-10-25 08:33:59	voidead	but hey I have money.. thats all I have at least
2016-10-25 08:34:02	voidead	fucking dumb asses
2016-10-25 08:34:19	voidead	why have money if you can't even fucking use it
2016-10-25 08:34:40	voidead	I need to transfer money to my American bank just to fucking buy shit I want
2016-10-25 08:35:07	voidead	I was lucky to even pay for Linode all this time
2016-10-25 08:35:22	voidead	somehow Linode accepted the Korean card
2016-10-25 08:36:18	voidead	the main thing that pisses me off though.. you _must_ be a Korean citizen to buy shit from Korean websites
2016-10-25 08:36:23	halfwit	What about paypal?
2016-10-25 08:36:30	voidead	I like buying shit from Korean sites because its shipping free
2016-10-25 08:36:39	voidead	I refuse to use paypal
2016-10-25 08:36:44	voidead	or bitcoin
2016-10-25 08:36:52	halfwit	Oh, ok
2016-10-25 08:37:09	voidead	thats why I have an American bank account
2016-10-25 08:37:09		[08:37]
2016-10-25 08:37:14	voidead	so I can actually buy shit
2016-10-25 08:37:51	voidead	I ask my girlfriend to buy Korean shit with her card since for whatever fucking reason I can't buy it with my own Korean card since I'm not a citizen
2016-10-25 08:37:58	voidead	and I give her cash
2016-10-25 08:38:08	halfwit	Heh, self driving truck drove 120 miles with beer :p
2016-10-25 08:38:15	voidead	yeah I heard about that
2016-10-25 08:38:17	halfwit	Nice
2016-10-25 08:38:29	halfwit	That's good though that you have a way to still do your shit
2016-10-25 08:38:40	voidead	without my girlfriend though.. I literally can't buy certain shit unless I ask a Korean person to buy it
2016-10-25 08:39:00	voidead	thankfully I don't buy much.. I bought like two skateboards from Korean using her card
2016-10-25 08:39:06	voidead	Korea*
2016-10-25 08:39:51	voidead	every citizen has a "PKI" number which they use to securely buy things or do official paperwork etc..
2016-10-25 08:39:59	voidead	and I'll never have a PKI of my own
2016-10-25 08:40:21	halfwit	Hm. If that were in the states, the NSA would love it :p
2016-10-25 08:40:28	halfwit	But I doubt it's like that there
2016-10-25 08:40:41	voidead	also Koreans rely on their phones heavily because they use their phones to securely verify shit all the time 
2016-10-25 08:40:50	halfwit	I really actually like that
2016-10-25 08:40:55	voidead	halfwit› here is the thing though
2016-10-25 08:40:59	halfwit	Mine has the fingerprint scanner, and everything
2016-10-25 08:41:09	voidead	its even more of a security risk than the US setup
2016-10-25 08:41:21	+Anna	I dont want to wait for tomorrow to go to a server
2016-10-25 08:41:40	voidead	using phones is literally the worst thing you could do.. not to mention most of Korea's government still uses XP for shit because of activeX
2016-10-25 08:41:45	voidead	its a clusterfuck 
2016-10-25 08:41:54	halfwit	Hehe
2016-10-25 08:42:06	+Anna	Japan has a task in my class
2016-10-25 08:42:09	voidead	I'm pretty disappointed with Korea's setup
2016-10-25 08:42:15	voidead	its secure.. but actually not really
2016-10-25 08:42:23	voidead	its very very vulnerable to attack
2016-10-25 08:42:25	halfwit	Well, I mean like my purchases, I scan a fingerprint and type in a password, and it does the thing for me
2016-10-25 08:42:34	halfwit	That part I like
2016-10-25 08:42:52	voidead	you can be quite secure in the US too
2016-10-25 08:43:07	voidead	but you know.. people simply aren't secure.. thats the issue
2016-10-25 08:43:18	voidead	usually people get tracked by the NSA because they are dumb
2016-10-25 08:43:22	halfwit	Oh, they'll trade security for ease of use in a heart beat
2016-10-25 08:43:24	voidead	using GPS all the time and shit
2016-10-25 08:44:14	voidead	like Snowden was mentioning.. I mean.. you really have to go through extreme measures to be secure these days
2016-10-25 08:44:17	voidead	but you can be secure
2016-10-25 08:44:33	halfwit	It really does suck
2016-10-25 08:44:44	halfwit	Like, that you have to do all this shit to have what should be a given, heh
2016-10-25 08:45:03	halfwit	That, or just stay offline and not enjoy all the awesome stuff technology does bring
2016-10-25 08:45:10	halfwit	Which i'm not ready to do
2016-10-25 08:45:15	+Anna	considering installing/configuring Mattermost in dev
2016-10-25 08:45:32	voidead	but you know.. texting on Facebook chat using a GPS all the time and clicking on ads and shit.. that is the dumbest thing you could possibly do.. on top of that.. using your phone to do sensitive work.. after you've just compromised everything using GPS/Facebook etc..
2016-10-25 08:45:34	voidead	its a clusterfuck
2016-10-25 08:45:50	halfwit	Yeah.
2016-10-25 08:46:03	halfwit	I still feel like the IoT is about to just destroy the internet
2016-10-25 08:46:06	voidead	its really just common sense
2016-10-25 08:46:39	voidead	here in Korea is worse.. like I said.. there are security features.. but holy shit
2016-10-25 08:46:44	halfwit	Heh.
2016-10-25 08:46:46	voidead	its like 1984 over here
2016-10-25 08:46:48	halfwit	Holy shit is right. 
2016-10-25 08:46:52	voidead	everyone is watching you heavily
2016-10-25 08:46:55	halfwit	Getting like thta here too :(
2016-10-25 08:47:05	halfwit	but at least they aren't going like in those few countries,
2016-10-25 08:47:15	halfwit	After that Ashley Madison thing, and killing people over shit
2016-10-25 08:47:28	halfwit	But it's a small leap
2016-10-25 08:47:32	halfwit	Really, a very small leap
2016-10-25 08:47:46	voidead	you can go to prison for some simple shit over here.. just being a dumb ass with your phone could land you in prison
2016-10-25 08:48:14	halfwit	Scary.
2016-10-25 08:48:28	voidead	South Korea is quite liberal.. but they watch you very heavily
2016-10-25 08:48:32	voidead	track you and shit
2016-10-25 08:48:36	voidead	moreso than the US
2016-10-25 08:48:43	voidead	because they are worried about North Korea
2016-10-25 08:48:48	voidead	and espionage
2016-10-25 08:48:51	voidead	etc..
2016-10-25 08:49:14	voidead	they feel its necessary
2016-10-25 08:49:17	halfwit	NK is pretty shitty to SK, yeah/
2016-10-25 08:49:19	voidead	which I can't really blame them
2016-10-25 08:49:22	halfwit	?
2016-10-25 08:49:42	voidead	surveillance
2016-10-25 08:49:48	voidead	they feel its necessary
2016-10-25 08:49:52	halfwit	I've heard that at very least the tensions are high, but we don't get much over here in the way of media coverage
2016-10-25 08:50:01	voidead	no doubt it is
2016-10-25 08:50:06	voidead	but nothing to be afraid of
2016-10-25 08:50:12	voidead	its all a pissing contest
2016-10-25 08:50:41	voidead	the most he could do is fire off some cold war era rockets and kill a few hundred people
2016-10-25 08:50:55	halfwit	It's really too bad, they have to play there big man games, for the benefit of very few, at the extreme expense of the rest of us
2016-10-25 08:51:09	halfwit	Makes me quite ashamed of humanity in general
2016-10-25 08:51:17	voidead	everyone here in Seoul ignores the threat.. as there really isn't much threat anyways
2016-10-25 08:51:52	halfwit	Exactly. Living like that is horseshit
2016-10-25 08:52:15	voidead	in fact.. everyone else in the world is more worried about North Korea than South Korea
2016-10-25 08:52:15		[08:52]
2016-10-25 08:52:41	voidead	South Koreans are just angry that North Korea exists thats all
2016-10-25 08:53:01	voidead	they are very disgusted that pig is still able to run a country
2016-10-25 08:53:12	halfwit	Me too.

2016-10-25 08:59:05	halfwit	Really though, the world was a way uglier place back then

2016-10-25 13:49:43	voidead	[18:51:17] everyone here in Seoul ignores the threat.. as there really isn't much threat anyways [18:51:17]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	halfwit	[18:51:52] Exactly. Living like that is horseshit [18:51:52]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	voidead	[18:52:15] in fact.. everyone else in the world is more worried about North Korea than South Korea [18:52:15]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	voidead	[18:52:41] South Koreans are just angry that North Korea exists thats all [18:52:41]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	voidead	[18:53:01] they are very disgusted that pig is still able to run a country [18:53:01]

2016-10-25 16:05:29		[16:05]
2016-10-25 17:04:25	Max`P	I think Concerta is working great! Getting late and I don't even feel a dip in concentration, much less brutal than Ritalin
2016-10-25 17:04:25		[17:04]
2016-10-25 17:04:46	alyptik	concerta isn't bad
2016-10-25 17:04:51	alyptik	adderall has spoiled me though
2016-10-25 17:06:37	Max`P	I don't know if I didn't have enough of it, but so far I very much prefer Adderall
2016-10-25 17:07:10	Max`P	Concerta*
2016-10-25 17:07:11	alyptik	it is pretty much unbeatable sans other amp derivatives like dexedrine
2016-10-25 17:07:13	alyptik	oh
2016-10-25 17:07:19	alyptik	how much adderall did you take?
2016-10-25 17:07:24	Max`P	15mg
2016-10-25 17:07:35	alyptik	oh yeah that isn't enough
2016-10-25 17:07:41	alyptik	first time i had to take 30mg to feel anything
2016-10-25 17:08:16	Max`P	Oh it worked, I even stayed on 10mg a few weeks because 15mg was hitting too hard
2016-10-25 17:08:47	alyptik	ah maybe you just prefer how concerta feels
2016-10-25 17:08:53	Max`P	In general I feel like it boosts me, but as if I took 10 coffees and then 5 hours later it just drops
2016-10-25 17:08:55	alyptik	diff for everyone
2016-10-25 17:09:21	Max`P	I liked Ritalin initially, but the emotional rollercoaster drived me crazy
2016-10-25 17:09:30	alyptik	ritalin i never liked
2016-10-25 17:09:41	alyptik	just felt like weird caffeine to me
2016-10-25 17:09:56	Max`P	Concerta feels about the same but much smoother effect, so if it stays that way I'm sold
2016-10-25 17:10:03	alyptik	concerta is supposed to just be ritalin, maybe the XR thing makes it feel different
2016-10-25 17:10:10	Max`P	Yeah
2016-10-25 17:10:41	Max`P	So yeah so far I'm liking it. Makes my head feel a level of quiet I hadn't felt in a long while

2016-10-25 17:57:03	herring	[03:39:10] should just need a basic nginx config [03:39:10]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	voidead	[03:40:28] yeah I'll have to fuck with it later [03:40:28]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	voidead	[03:40:30] I don't have time [03:40:30]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	voidead	[03:40:51] at least everything is working as far as the domain goes [03:40:51]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	Max`P	[03:41:42] The minimal nginx config is tiny, I'm surprised you have so much trouble with it. You should see Apache httpd, it's just pure insanity [03:41:42]

2016-10-25 17:57:03	voidead	[03:42:35] but now I have to wait until after work [03:42:35]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	voidead	[03:43:26] so I have the cert and nginx is working.. I just need to configure everything related to the cert when I come back [03:43:26]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	voidead	[03:44:21] certbot wasn't working until just an hour ago [03:44:21]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	voidead	[03:44:36] and I already used that command last night Max`P and it didn't work [03:44:36]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	voidead	[03:44:40] but now it does [03:44:40]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	voidead	[03:44:42] so who knows [03:44:42]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	herring	[03:45:51] i think all you need to do is add your locations to the https server block in your config, and have http redirect to https [03:45:51]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	herring	[03:46:29] when i did it, letsencrypt added the lines it required to the nginx config [03:46:29]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	voidead	[03:47:12] ah yeah thats what I was trying to do just now.. but no time [03:47:12]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	herring	[03:47:28] i just added my locations like i had them in the http block.. copy/pasted.. then added that line i mentioned earlier to redirect [03:47:28]

2016-10-26 17:18:59	alyptik	lol
2016-10-26 17:19:02	alyptik	good times
2016-10-26 17:19:17	alyptik	be careful though, stims can be a slippery slope
2016-10-26 17:19:21	alyptik	speaking from experience
2016-10-26 17:19:41	halfwit	stims?
2016-10-26 17:20:24	alyptik	adderall, ritalin, concert, meth

2016-10-26 17:20:47	halfwit	Oh stimulants
2016-10-26 17:20:59	+Anna	well
2016-10-26 17:21:53	Max`P	I should be fine, I'm using the dose prescribed by the doctor. Take my pill in the morning, lasts all that. Works plenty as it is, so I don't think I'm going to fall into a slippery slope
2016-10-26 17:22:26	alyptik	that's good
2016-10-26 17:28:00		[17:22]

2016-10-26 17:40:21	alyptik	amp WD's are mostly just boring as fuck
2016-10-26 17:40:45	alyptik	i have never been crippled by boredom ever other than during that
2016-10-26 17:40:59	halfwit	Meth too?
2016-10-26 17:42:05	alyptik	never done it
2016-10-26 17:42:08	alyptik	thankfully
2016-10-26 17:42:17	alyptik	it is pretty much just a feeling of nothing seems worth doing
2016-10-26 17:42:22	alyptik	quite literally
2016-10-26 17:42:31	alyptik	i dont even want to think about what meth would be like
2016-10-26 17:42:41	halfwit	The gf's family, most of them did it

2016-10-26 17:43:12	voidead	halfwit› too many people do meth
2016-10-26 17:43:15	voidead	its pretty ridiculous

2016-10-26 18:32:15	voidead	halfwit› yeah I remember you talking about it
2016-10-26 18:32:19	halfwit	played with preexec to remove the host and pwd I have in my prompt, so it only shows on the very bottom, not after every command
2016-10-26 18:32:33	halfwit	Yeah. 
2016-10-26 18:32:49	halfwit	I just pulled up ahelp menu with delete
2016-10-26 18:33:27	voidead	damn what was it.. I can't remember why I needed del to work 
2016-10-26 18:33:35	voidead	I ended up just opening termite
2016-10-26 18:33:39	voidead	since it has sane defaults
2016-10-26 18:34:01	halfwit	Yeah, with st it's best to have a fallback at very least
2016-10-26 18:34:18	voidead	AH

2016-10-27 10:23:31	cirkit	you have to tweak some things
2016-10-27 10:23:32	alyptik	well mostly i am trying to figure out https
2016-10-27 10:23:48	alyptik	is there a way to use rewrite without breaking stuff like alyp.tk:8000?
2016-10-27 10:23:59	Max`P	If you use rewrite in nginx, you're doing it wrong.
2016-10-27 10:24:29	alyptik	i just want to redirect 80 to https mostly

2016-10-27 10:48:05	herring	why is firefox so fucking slow on everything when it first starts
2016-10-27 10:48:46	herring	on android i have to wait until i can get to the settings, every other option in the menu is available except the only thing anyone uses the menu for which is settings
2016-10-27 10:48:58	+Anna	Max`P: Yeah. I have a few guys who are the exact same instructions we sent to the fact remains.. even if they have always been boring to listen to whatever
2016-10-27 10:49:27	herring	on the desktop it takes a good 10 seconds until i can actually type anything in the address bar
2016-10-27 10:51:04	alyptik	ugh
2016-10-27 10:51:19	alyptik	i really just have to a have a cert for every sub domain huh
2016-10-27 10:52:19	Max`P	herring: because Firefox is a shit browser that's getting very outdated but tries to stay relevant
2016-10-27 10:53:31	Max`P	It was never designed for multi threading or anything related to modern computers. So it's severaly lagging behind, and well, there's just so much stuff (especially IO) that you can do in a single thread without it going dog slow
2016-10-27 10:56:43	alyptik	single thread in chromium omg
2016-10-27 10:56:47	alyptik	thought i would die of old age
2016-10-27 10:57:11	Max`P	alyptik: ?
2016-10-27 10:59:00	alyptik	you can run chromium single process with a flag
2016-10-27 10:59:11	alyptik	no idea why you want to use that ever, but you can
2016-10-27 11:05:00		[10:59]
2016-10-27 11:08:12	Max`P	oh that, yeah I know
2016-10-27 11:08:21	Max`P	Was just confused because we were talking about Firefox
2016-10-27 11:10:52	alyptik	so ff is only one thread always?
2016-10-27 11:10:57	alyptik	didn't know that
2016-10-27 11:11:11	Max`P	They're trying, but yeah it's still mostly single-threaded
2016-10-27 11:11:18	Max`P	Try loading an heavy website and look at the UI stall
2016-10-27 11:11:53	alyptik	does SMP affect mem footprint much; is that why chromium uses 6GB of RAM?
2016-10-27 11:14:33	Max`P	alyptik: 6G? Wtf do you do to your poor Chromium for it to use that much ram? https://d.max-p.me/irc/Capture%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran_2016-10-27_17-13-22.png
2016-10-27 11:14:52	alyptik	Max`P› i have like 30 tabs open hah
2016-10-27 11:15:00	alyptik	well nowadays it is lke 2G
2016-10-27 11:15:15	alyptik	thank god for --memory-model=low
2016-10-27 11:15:53	Max`P	it never used that much ram for me really
2016-10-27 11:16:14	alyptik	how does nginx handle proxying?
2016-10-27 11:16:27	alyptik	like making mpd.alyp.tk proxy to alyp.tk:8000
2016-10-27 11:16:32	alyptik	how well
2016-10-27 11:16:49	alyptik	Max`P› could be my million extensions too
2016-10-27 11:17:16	Max`P	alyptik: server { server_name mpd.alyp.tk; listen 80; location / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000; } }
2016-10-27 11:17:30	alyptik	wow seriously that's it
2016-10-27 11:17:33	Max`P	Yes
2016-10-27 11:17:41	Max`P	Why do you think everyone says httpd is bloated as fuck
2016-10-27 11:17:41	+Anna	cirkit: Would you mind help me for not as good as Python or Ruby or *shrug* Perl
2016-10-27 11:17:43	alyptik	fuck me maybe i will switch to nginx

2016-10-27 12:02:12	Max`P	Firefox became obsolete the day Chromium was released
2016-10-27 12:03:19	Max`P	Even back in the Chromium 1.0 days the difference was so huge Firefox felt like Internet Explorer compared to Chromium. Switched on day one and practically never looked back
2016-10-27 12:03:58	Max`P	It's so bad I'd actually prefer using Microsoft Edga than Firefox, because at least that one is fast too

2016-10-27 13:06:11	Max`P	alyptik: that's just a library around the already quite old and widespread dbus
2016-10-27 13:06:25	alyptik	i am trying to understand it atm
2016-10-27 13:06:28	alyptik	dbus always confused me

2016-10-27 13:10:06	Max`P	alyptik: it's basically a generic interface for programs to talk to eachother. For example, most music players broadcast their status over dbus, so other software can catch it and act on it. That's how most generic media control applets are made
2016-10-27 13:10:40	Max`P	Another example is NetworkManager. You don't talk to NetworkManager directly using a custom protocol. It just uses dbus and you send commands to it
2016-10-27 13:11:57	alyptik	oo
2016-10-27 13:12:03	alyptik	so IPC
2016-10-27 13:12:06	alyptik	basically
2016-10-27 13:12:35	alyptik	that is a lot simpler
2016-10-27 13:12:48	Max`P	Yea, literally the second sentence of the article: "sd-bus is our minimal D-Bus IPC C library, supporting as back-ends both classic socket-based D-Bus and kdbus."
2016-10-27 13:12:49	alyptik	most docs explain how to use API in C but not what it actually does
2016-10-27 13:13:03	Svibrager	@Max P, yeah I know what you mean about Edge. Even with its flaws it's still better
