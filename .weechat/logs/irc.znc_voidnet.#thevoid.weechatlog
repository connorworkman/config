2016-10-17 17:39:38	+Anna	lol
2016-10-17 17:39:43	voidead	and you need to make sure those ports are open
2016-10-17 17:39:46	voidead	obviously
2016-10-17 17:39:52	halfwit	They best be :p
2016-10-17 17:40:01	voidead	yeah but I hate opening ports
2016-10-17 17:40:30	voidead	so what I do is have one port open for the stream only and just SSH into the computer via juiceSSH to control it
2016-10-17 17:40:35	halfwit	There, it works.
2016-10-17 17:40:59	alyptik	i run nftables to keep my ports safe
2016-10-17 17:41:00	halfwit	Oh, that's a good plan too.
2016-10-17 17:41:09	alyptik	thought closed is far safer than open to begin with

2016-10-17 17:42:07	halfwit	alyptik: For sure, when you can manage it
2016-10-17 17:42:09	voidead	you can control how many
2016-10-17 17:42:20	halfwit	Yours is set to 0 in the thing you showed, so unlimited
2016-10-17 17:42:26	voidead	halfwit› but I'm not sure if MPD has a hard coded limit or not
2016-10-17 17:42:39	voidead	halfwit› 0?

2016-10-17 17:46:11	voidead	and then it will shuffle
2016-10-17 17:46:34	halfwit	I could make playlists for every album like I used to, but
2016-10-17 17:46:35	voidead	I like the playlist format.. because there are songs I don't feel like listening to so I remove them
2016-10-17 17:47:06	voidead	I simply add every album to the playlist in ABC order and for albums which have songs I don't like I just pick and choose
2016-10-17 17:47:18	halfwit	Changing song only take a moment here
2016-10-17 17:47:34	halfwit	This is bearable

2016-10-18 13:40:26	alyptik	yeah that is my issue atm
2016-10-18 13:40:31	halfwit	Are you on weechat, also? alt+l is handy
2016-10-18 13:41:01	alyptik	urlserver script works ok, but would like it to work without

2016-10-18 14:38:59	alyptik	Max`P› how come you are installing 8.1?
2016-10-18 14:39:28	Max`P	alyptik: I have a user unable to install our driver on it, so I'm installing it to see wtf Microsoft broke again
2016-10-18 14:39:43	Max`P	Probably some kind of bs driver enforcement from manufacturers
2016-10-18 14:40:03	alyptik	ah
2016-10-18 14:40:59	Max`P	I also need to make a MacOS installer media, but that I'll wait because adding my 500GB drive will probably kill the sata adapter again and I don't want to fuck up the two Windows VMs that are updating, it's long enough as it is lol

2016-10-18 15:27:29	Max`P	I'd still like to understand how the fuck Windows manages to have updates be so disastrous
2016-10-18 15:27:49	Max`P	I had the time to install, configure and test whatever I needed to test on Windows 8.1 before Windows 10 finished installing routine updates
2016-10-18 15:28:03	Max`P	Like, at this point, why not just fucking reinstall Windows anyway, it'll be faster
2016-10-18 15:29:22	cirkit	Windows is a disaster...I was troubleshooting an HP laptop that went from 8.1 -> 10 and upon booting to the new "upgraded" Windows got a BSOD "Unmountable boot volume" before getting a login window
2016-10-18 15:29:41	cirkit	couldn't do shit...even booting from a Win10 USB stick was stuck for hours...pile of shit

2016-10-18 15:34:42	alyptik	cirkit› it is like pulling teeth
2016-10-18 15:35:06	Max`P	Yup. It did... nothing at all. I'll have to find an ISO that already has the updates installed as usual. Fucking piece of shit
2016-10-18 15:35:20	Max`P	Still not as horrible as Mac, because hey at least Windows BOOTS, but still.

2016-10-18 16:32:16	cirkit	his suggestion to have me get OVH which is based in Quebec is a bit ridciulous

2016-10-18 16:35:23	Max`P	Jesus christ that's like the bottom of society's shithole, that's like barely above the homeless XD
2016-10-18 16:36:01	Max`P	ffs, she's pregnant and she's getting stoned like that? That's just incredibly irresponsible
2016-10-18 16:37:00	cirkit	afaik they don't smoke in front of the kids so that's good...but sometimes they'll come in the room

2016-10-18 16:38:54	cirkit	to me it seems based on this Trois-Rivières is a shithole
2016-10-18 16:39:35	Max`P	It's not that bad, it's a decent sized city. Went there a few times, it's fine. There's some of these a bit of everywhere

2016-10-18 17:23:01	Max`P	cirkit: and I consider my dad to have been very responsible with this, make sure to always be sober enough to take care of me and to not let me know what it was (I thought it was weird cigarettes)

2016-10-18 17:23:04	cirkit	this is a disaster

2016-10-18 17:24:25	cirkit	best of my knowledge they don't abuse their kids physically or anything like that...i think more just fucked up living conditions

2016-10-19 09:52:10	voidead	halfwit› how did you manage to do that?
2016-10-19 09:52:21	+Anna	I bet mine isn't finished but it's fucking useful lol
2016-10-19 09:52:27	voidead	lol
2016-10-19 09:52:42	halfwit	voidead: Trying to sideload an update. It won't boot... I' mstill contemplating whether to grab an image from Google, see if I can't flash the OG firmware
2016-10-19 09:53:35	voidead	so I just got this Toshiba TB external drive.. has a NTFS filesystem on it
2016-10-19 09:53:50	voidead	can I just make it a different filesystem?
2016-10-19 09:53:58	voidead	or will there be issues?
2016-10-19 09:54:12	voidead	I removed fucking 200MB of bloatware that was on it
2016-10-19 09:54:17	halfwit	It will work with less things out of the box
2016-10-19 09:54:27	halfwit	Like Windows, they bitch a lot when you have other FS's
2016-10-19 09:54:39	voidead	well fuck windows
2016-10-19 09:54:49	voidead	I don't have windows installed on anything
2016-10-19 09:54:59	Max`P	voidead: at least Windows boots, and doesn't brick laptops.
2016-10-19 09:55:20	voidead	Max`P› if you are referring to MacOS... then yeah
2016-10-19 09:55:45	voidead	I'm glad I have no need for mac or windows
2016-10-19 09:55:50	voidead	they both can suck my dick
2016-10-19 09:57:31	halfwit	Agreed :( 
2016-10-19 09:58:37	voidead	so would it be ill advised to reformat the drive to be another filesystem?
2016-10-19 09:59:20	Max`P	voidead: what do you mean?
2016-10-19 09:59:48	herring	i did with my external d
2016-10-19 09:59:48	Max`P	Ah, yes, you can make it whatever you want
2016-10-19 09:59:50	herring	wd
2016-10-19 09:59:57	voidead	would changing the filesystem to something other than NTFS cause it to brick.. is what I'm saying
2016-10-19 09:59:58	Max`P	My drivers are all btrfs now
2016-10-19 10:00:02	herring	first thing i did was make it ext4
2016-10-19 10:00:02		[10:00]
2016-10-19 10:00:06	Max`P	No, drives are just block devices
2016-10-19 10:00:20	voidead	ah ok
2016-10-19 10:00:31	voidead	yeah ext4 is exactly what I want
2016-10-19 10:00:32	Max`P	All USB disks are just a SATA-to-USB adapter, you can do whatever the fuck you want with them
2016-10-19 10:01:14	herring	yeah its just a regular toshiba sata drive in there
2016-10-19 10:01:30	herring	my external wd came with a wd red in it
2016-10-19 10:01:44	voidead	one other thing I've been curious about.. so after you unmount the drive.. its still spinning.. well doesn't it kind of fuck it up a bit when you pull out immediately and it makes that beep sound?
2016-10-19 10:04:07	herring	not sure about that.. mine doesnt ever beep.. i dont have any problem just unplugging it even without unmounting
2016-10-19 10:04:19	herring	willy fucking nilly
2016-10-19 10:05:40	herring	its hooked up to the c1 though.. doesnt get unmounted 90% because i end just unplugging the c1 since it has no power switch
2016-10-19 10:05:41	voidead	mine beeps sometimes and sometimes it doesn't beep
2016-10-19 10:05:58	voidead	I'm assuming because its still rotating
2016-10-19 10:06:03	herring	of the time*
2016-10-19 10:06:04	voidead	even though its unmounted
2016-10-19 10:06:28	voidead	I wonder if I should just wait for it to stop rotating or something before physically removing it?
2016-10-19 10:07:02	herring	couldnt hurt i guess
2016-10-19 10:07:35	herring	let me know how that drive goes.. i almost bought it instead this wd.. 
2016-10-19 10:07:45	herring	cause it was cheaper
2016-10-19 10:07:53	herring	and looked cooler
2016-10-19 10:08:07	herring	you got the cool looking one right?
2016-10-19 10:09:24	herring	never had a toshiba drive though so ended up with the wd
2016-10-19 10:10:02	voidead	yeah mine is nice actually
2016-10-19 10:10:13	voidead	I had a choice between that and the Samsung drive.. but fuck Samsung
2016-10-19 10:10:19	voidead	proprietary faggots
2016-10-19 10:10:30	+Anna	It sure is expensive i'm told...Trois-Rivières is cheapest in Québec this year

2016-10-19 14:34:34	Max`P	[00:27:58] If you install something like Ubuntu, the fonts are quite good right out of the box seriously :P [00:27:58]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	haavard	[00:28:17] Max`P: but muh pacman [00:28:17]

2016-10-19 14:34:34	haavard	[00:29:22] amen [00:29:22]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:29:23] i think my new job uses Ubuntu so will have to use apt-get sadly [00:29:23]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:29:30] well at least Ubuntu is on systemd [00:29:30]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	haavard	[00:30:10] I don't get how anyone can argue they have a better package manager than pacman [00:30:10]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:30:18] yeah for reals [00:30:18]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	haavard	[00:30:31] Like, the ease of use, not only when installing packages and shit but also for modifying packages, creating your own packages etc. [00:30:31]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:30:33] i simply type 'pm -S <package> and voila install [00:30:33]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	haavard	[00:30:35] It just works really well [00:30:35]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:30:45] none of those long ass apt-get commands (although i guess you could still alias for shorter :P) [00:30:45]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:31:20] search in Ubuntu: apt-cache search "package" [00:31:20]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:31:29] search in Arch: pm -Ss "package" [00:31:29]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	Max`P	[00:31:29] Only thing I wish Arch had is s bit more package splitting. Not like Debian crazy splitting, but just a little bit more [00:31:29]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:31:31] much shorter [00:31:31]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	Max`P	[00:31:56] So that say, installing ffmpeg doesn't pull in a whole DE with it [00:31:56]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:32:26] i hate that with Debian uninstalling one thing will then have you uninstall 200 more things [00:32:26]

If you don't know what a data serialization format is, think of it as a way to translate a programmatic data structure (lists, arrays, dictionaries, etc) into a format that can be easily stored to disk. The file can then be used to recreate the structure at a later point. JSON is another popular data serialization format, but YAML is much easier to read.

2016-10-19 17:22:22	Max`P	Having that in front absorbs most of the wave so the sound is clearee

2016-10-19 19:08:40	bridgesfreezefirst	you may be right
