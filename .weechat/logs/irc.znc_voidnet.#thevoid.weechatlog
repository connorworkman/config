2016-10-17 17:39:38	+Anna	lol
2016-10-17 17:39:43	voidead	and you need to make sure those ports are open
2016-10-17 17:39:46	voidead	obviously
2016-10-17 17:39:52	halfwit	They best be :p
2016-10-17 17:40:01	voidead	yeah but I hate opening ports
2016-10-17 17:40:30	voidead	so what I do is have one port open for the stream only and just SSH into the computer via juiceSSH to control it
2016-10-17 17:40:35	halfwit	There, it works.
2016-10-17 17:40:59	alyptik	i run nftables to keep my ports safe
2016-10-17 17:41:00	halfwit	Oh, that's a good plan too.
2016-10-17 17:41:09	alyptik	thought closed is far safer than open to begin with

2016-10-17 17:42:07	halfwit	alyptik: For sure, when you can manage it
2016-10-17 17:42:09	voidead	you can control how many
2016-10-17 17:42:20	halfwit	Yours is set to 0 in the thing you showed, so unlimited
2016-10-17 17:42:26	voidead	halfwit› but I'm not sure if MPD has a hard coded limit or not
2016-10-17 17:42:39	voidead	halfwit› 0?

2016-10-17 17:46:11	voidead	and then it will shuffle
2016-10-17 17:46:34	halfwit	I could make playlists for every album like I used to, but
2016-10-17 17:46:35	voidead	I like the playlist format.. because there are songs I don't feel like listening to so I remove them
2016-10-17 17:47:06	voidead	I simply add every album to the playlist in ABC order and for albums which have songs I don't like I just pick and choose
2016-10-17 17:47:18	halfwit	Changing song only take a moment here
2016-10-17 17:47:34	halfwit	This is bearable

2016-10-18 13:40:26	alyptik	yeah that is my issue atm
2016-10-18 13:40:31	halfwit	Are you on weechat, also? alt+l is handy
2016-10-18 13:41:01	alyptik	urlserver script works ok, but would like it to work without

2016-10-18 14:38:59	alyptik	Max`P› how come you are installing 8.1?
2016-10-18 14:39:28	Max`P	alyptik: I have a user unable to install our driver on it, so I'm installing it to see wtf Microsoft broke again
2016-10-18 14:39:43	Max`P	Probably some kind of bs driver enforcement from manufacturers
2016-10-18 14:40:03	alyptik	ah
2016-10-18 14:40:59	Max`P	I also need to make a MacOS installer media, but that I'll wait because adding my 500GB drive will probably kill the sata adapter again and I don't want to fuck up the two Windows VMs that are updating, it's long enough as it is lol

2016-10-18 15:27:29	Max`P	I'd still like to understand how the fuck Windows manages to have updates be so disastrous
2016-10-18 15:27:49	Max`P	I had the time to install, configure and test whatever I needed to test on Windows 8.1 before Windows 10 finished installing routine updates
2016-10-18 15:28:03	Max`P	Like, at this point, why not just fucking reinstall Windows anyway, it'll be faster
2016-10-18 15:29:22	cirkit	Windows is a disaster...I was troubleshooting an HP laptop that went from 8.1 -> 10 and upon booting to the new "upgraded" Windows got a BSOD "Unmountable boot volume" before getting a login window
2016-10-18 15:29:41	cirkit	couldn't do shit...even booting from a Win10 USB stick was stuck for hours...pile of shit

2016-10-18 15:34:42	alyptik	cirkit› it is like pulling teeth
2016-10-18 15:35:06	Max`P	Yup. It did... nothing at all. I'll have to find an ISO that already has the updates installed as usual. Fucking piece of shit
2016-10-18 15:35:20	Max`P	Still not as horrible as Mac, because hey at least Windows BOOTS, but still.

2016-10-18 16:32:16	cirkit	his suggestion to have me get OVH which is based in Quebec is a bit ridciulous

2016-10-18 16:35:23	Max`P	Jesus christ that's like the bottom of society's shithole, that's like barely above the homeless XD
2016-10-18 16:36:01	Max`P	ffs, she's pregnant and she's getting stoned like that? That's just incredibly irresponsible
2016-10-18 16:37:00	cirkit	afaik they don't smoke in front of the kids so that's good...but sometimes they'll come in the room

2016-10-18 16:38:54	cirkit	to me it seems based on this Trois-Rivières is a shithole
2016-10-18 16:39:35	Max`P	It's not that bad, it's a decent sized city. Went there a few times, it's fine. There's some of these a bit of everywhere

2016-10-18 17:23:01	Max`P	cirkit: and I consider my dad to have been very responsible with this, make sure to always be sober enough to take care of me and to not let me know what it was (I thought it was weird cigarettes)

2016-10-18 17:23:04	cirkit	this is a disaster

2016-10-18 17:24:25	cirkit	best of my knowledge they don't abuse their kids physically or anything like that...i think more just fucked up living conditions

2016-10-19 09:52:10	voidead	halfwit› how did you manage to do that?
2016-10-19 09:52:21	+Anna	I bet mine isn't finished but it's fucking useful lol
2016-10-19 09:52:27	voidead	lol
2016-10-19 09:52:42	halfwit	voidead: Trying to sideload an update. It won't boot... I' mstill contemplating whether to grab an image from Google, see if I can't flash the OG firmware
2016-10-19 09:53:35	voidead	so I just got this Toshiba TB external drive.. has a NTFS filesystem on it
2016-10-19 09:53:50	voidead	can I just make it a different filesystem?
2016-10-19 09:53:58	voidead	or will there be issues?
2016-10-19 09:54:12	voidead	I removed fucking 200MB of bloatware that was on it
2016-10-19 09:54:17	halfwit	It will work with less things out of the box
2016-10-19 09:54:27	halfwit	Like Windows, they bitch a lot when you have other FS's
2016-10-19 09:54:39	voidead	well fuck windows
2016-10-19 09:54:49	voidead	I don't have windows installed on anything
2016-10-19 09:54:59	Max`P	voidead: at least Windows boots, and doesn't brick laptops.
2016-10-19 09:55:20	voidead	Max`P› if you are referring to MacOS... then yeah
2016-10-19 09:55:45	voidead	I'm glad I have no need for mac or windows
2016-10-19 09:55:50	voidead	they both can suck my dick
2016-10-19 09:57:31	halfwit	Agreed :( 
2016-10-19 09:58:37	voidead	so would it be ill advised to reformat the drive to be another filesystem?
2016-10-19 09:59:20	Max`P	voidead: what do you mean?
2016-10-19 09:59:48	herring	i did with my external d
2016-10-19 09:59:48	Max`P	Ah, yes, you can make it whatever you want
2016-10-19 09:59:50	herring	wd
2016-10-19 09:59:57	voidead	would changing the filesystem to something other than NTFS cause it to brick.. is what I'm saying
2016-10-19 09:59:58	Max`P	My drivers are all btrfs now
2016-10-19 10:00:02	herring	first thing i did was make it ext4
2016-10-19 10:00:02		[10:00]
2016-10-19 10:00:06	Max`P	No, drives are just block devices
2016-10-19 10:00:20	voidead	ah ok
2016-10-19 10:00:31	voidead	yeah ext4 is exactly what I want
2016-10-19 10:00:32	Max`P	All USB disks are just a SATA-to-USB adapter, you can do whatever the fuck you want with them
2016-10-19 10:01:14	herring	yeah its just a regular toshiba sata drive in there
2016-10-19 10:01:30	herring	my external wd came with a wd red in it
2016-10-19 10:01:44	voidead	one other thing I've been curious about.. so after you unmount the drive.. its still spinning.. well doesn't it kind of fuck it up a bit when you pull out immediately and it makes that beep sound?
2016-10-19 10:04:07	herring	not sure about that.. mine doesnt ever beep.. i dont have any problem just unplugging it even without unmounting
2016-10-19 10:04:19	herring	willy fucking nilly
2016-10-19 10:05:40	herring	its hooked up to the c1 though.. doesnt get unmounted 90% because i end just unplugging the c1 since it has no power switch
2016-10-19 10:05:41	voidead	mine beeps sometimes and sometimes it doesn't beep
2016-10-19 10:05:58	voidead	I'm assuming because its still rotating
2016-10-19 10:06:03	herring	of the time*
2016-10-19 10:06:04	voidead	even though its unmounted
2016-10-19 10:06:28	voidead	I wonder if I should just wait for it to stop rotating or something before physically removing it?
2016-10-19 10:07:02	herring	couldnt hurt i guess
2016-10-19 10:07:35	herring	let me know how that drive goes.. i almost bought it instead this wd.. 
2016-10-19 10:07:45	herring	cause it was cheaper
2016-10-19 10:07:53	herring	and looked cooler
2016-10-19 10:08:07	herring	you got the cool looking one right?
2016-10-19 10:09:24	herring	never had a toshiba drive though so ended up with the wd
2016-10-19 10:10:02	voidead	yeah mine is nice actually
2016-10-19 10:10:13	voidead	I had a choice between that and the Samsung drive.. but fuck Samsung
2016-10-19 10:10:19	voidead	proprietary faggots
2016-10-19 10:10:30	+Anna	It sure is expensive i'm told...Trois-Rivières is cheapest in Québec this year

2016-10-19 14:34:34	Max`P	[00:27:58] If you install something like Ubuntu, the fonts are quite good right out of the box seriously :P [00:27:58]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	haavard	[00:28:17] Max`P: but muh pacman [00:28:17]

2016-10-19 14:34:34	haavard	[00:29:22] amen [00:29:22]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:29:23] i think my new job uses Ubuntu so will have to use apt-get sadly [00:29:23]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:29:30] well at least Ubuntu is on systemd [00:29:30]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	haavard	[00:30:10] I don't get how anyone can argue they have a better package manager than pacman [00:30:10]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:30:18] yeah for reals [00:30:18]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	haavard	[00:30:31] Like, the ease of use, not only when installing packages and shit but also for modifying packages, creating your own packages etc. [00:30:31]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:30:33] i simply type 'pm -S <package> and voila install [00:30:33]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	haavard	[00:30:35] It just works really well [00:30:35]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:30:45] none of those long ass apt-get commands (although i guess you could still alias for shorter :P) [00:30:45]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:31:20] search in Ubuntu: apt-cache search "package" [00:31:20]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:31:29] search in Arch: pm -Ss "package" [00:31:29]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	Max`P	[00:31:29] Only thing I wish Arch had is s bit more package splitting. Not like Debian crazy splitting, but just a little bit more [00:31:29]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:31:31] much shorter [00:31:31]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	Max`P	[00:31:56] So that say, installing ffmpeg doesn't pull in a whole DE with it [00:31:56]
2016-10-19 14:34:34	cirkit	[00:32:26] i hate that with Debian uninstalling one thing will then have you uninstall 200 more things [00:32:26]

If you don't know what a data serialization format is, think of it as a way to translate a programmatic data structure (lists, arrays, dictionaries, etc) into a format that can be easily stored to disk. The file can then be used to recreate the structure at a later point. JSON is another popular data serialization format, but YAML is much easier to read.

2016-10-19 17:22:22	Max`P	Having that in front absorbs most of the wave so the sound is clearee

2016-10-19 19:08:40	bridgesfreezefirst	you may be right

2016-10-20 14:53:24	Max`P	That's why parallel downloads are having a comeback: that allows to stuff more in the same link, with other connections practically not even fighting for bandwidth
2016-10-20 14:54:01	cirkit	yeah, that should be really nice
2016-10-20 14:55:00	prg	voidead: it can be interesting to see their point of view on shit.. and pretty funny memes get posted

2016-10-20 15:07:01	herring	and ive had more issues in the last couple updates then that whole time
2016-10-20 15:07:30	herring	with stereostypical arch breakage
2016-10-20 15:07:43	herring	this is how people imagine archlinux to be
2016-10-20 15:07:46	cirkit	you using that suckless bullshit?
2016-10-20 15:07:50	herring	now i understand
2016-10-20 15:07:51	cirkit	haven't had shit break in Arch for years
2016-10-20 15:08:03	herring	termite
2016-10-20 15:09:27	herring	someone said its a termite bug but it does the same shit with other terminals
2016-10-20 15:09:39	herring	downgrading vte3-ng works for me as far as colors
2016-10-20 15:09:44	herring	but i dont want to have to downgrade shit
2016-10-20 15:09:57	herring	and i havent figured out why mpv is broken
2016-10-20 15:10:07	herring	been using vlc instead for now
2016-10-20 15:10:13	herring	until i feel like fucking with it
2016-10-20 15:10:20	herring	probably will end up downgrading more shit
2016-10-20 15:11:52	cirkit	just checked the deps for mpv under Arch
2016-10-20 15:11:59	cirkit	hell of a lot of libs
2016-10-20 15:12:17	cirkit	my guess is it isn't finding the correct library version
2016-10-20 15:12:20	herring	someone mentioned netcdf
2016-10-20 15:12:29	herring	i tried downgrading that but it didnt work
2016-10-20 15:14:48	cirkit	wonder what `ldd mpv` shows
2016-10-20 15:15:34	herring	error: target not found: ldd
2016-10-20 15:17:59	herring	ill jack with it later

2016-10-20 15:34:25	herring	ah
2016-10-20 15:34:37	herring	i didnt actually downgrade netcdf
2016-10-20 15:34:47	herring	i just reinstalled the new version
2016-10-20 15:34:53	herring	downgrading taht did indeed fix mpv

2016-10-20 17:28:53	MacinJonPlus	I basically have to pay for rent, groceries, whatever else comes my way. Girlfriend had an issue with her taxes about her getting put into a tax bracket so she owes like a grand (profit sharing from previous work place), and then I also have to pay back my federal loans too. If I don't work, I don't eat. This semester sucks ass haha
2016-10-20 17:29:11	halfwit	voidead: When I was moving my music over, it crashed. Lost all but my A bands :)
2016-10-20 17:29:12	MacinJonPlus	no loans either. Only one course thankfully

2016-10-20 17:30:24	halfwit	Then got a phone call, apparently it was too suspicious
2016-10-20 17:30:28	halfwit	Bullshit -_-;

2016-10-20 17:33:18	halfwit	voidead: I mean, I get the wages for the hours work. EI is like something you can apply for to get more money from the government, based on the hours you work. (Think UI in the states, I guess)

2016-10-20 17:45:14	MHD	its all memes
2016-10-20 17:47:48	MHD	also because it was done most prolifically by chile/argentina dictatorships against dissidents, the dissidents being overwhelmingly communists
2016-10-20 17:50:13	MacinJonPlus	the real question being
2016-10-20 17:50:23	MacinJonPlus	incorrigible bigotry or galloping through the battle ruins
2016-10-20 17:51:32	voidead	Incorrigible Bigotry is awesome
2016-10-20 17:51:36	MHD	one of them is significantly better than the other and i forget which
2016-10-20 17:51:57	MHD	probably galloping

2016-10-20 17:59:27	voidead	MHD› you always compare albums.. I don't
2016-10-20 17:59:40	MHD	yeah i guess im just inclined that way

2016-10-20 18:00:51	MacinJonPlus	heirs to perdition and archaic invincibility are incredible. Definite recommend. No matter what the occasion, be it flogging the cargo or staying the nubian archer. It's all up to you, Arghoslent are there at the right time no matter what your needs.
2016-10-20 18:01:07	halfwit	voidead: There's just "songs I like", sometimes that's every one on the album, sometimes that's not

2016-10-21 17:35:46	voidead	it had nothing to do with the code

2016-10-21 17:36:22	voidead	I could understand if it was something related to the code and it was a real issue that needed to be fixed.. but this was just some bullshit

2016-10-21 17:45:35	Max`P	It's my watercooling pump that's just insanely loud. Needs replacing, and needs actual cooling fluid
2016-10-21 17:45:47	+Anna	no good reason and shit.. and pretty funny grabs on some dank now
2016-10-21 17:46:04	halfwit	Oh, water cooling, nice
2016-10-21 17:47:57	Max`P	It's not for me. The maintenance...
2016-10-21 17:51:18	halfwit	That's understandable.
2016-10-21 17:52:52	Max`P	But yeah the thing is I bought this PC with the watercooling already installed and all. I didn't know that shit needed maintenance, so I let it run for a year or two, almost daily. Eventually it started having rocks developing in the tubes, clogging everything. So I had to flush it, even changed the pump to a spare one that came with the computer. 
2016-10-21 17:52:52	Max`P	Both make that "I'm working hard to pump that liquid" buzzing sound
2016-10-21 17:53:23	halfwit	Hm, that sounds like you need a really good flush

2016-10-21 17:56:43	halfwit	i bet you can calibrate some smart recording software to cancel that 
2016-10-21 17:57:28	Max`P	Tried. Almost got it, but my sound card actually only records mono. 
2016-10-21 17:57:35	halfwit	Ah :(
2016-10-21 17:57:46	halfwit	Lol, that's useful.
2016-10-21 17:57:53	Max`P	Otherwise, I would have put a mic in the PC, one to speak into, and then adjust the levels to cancel eachother
2016-10-21 17:59:02	Max`P	Tried using another sound card for that, but then it keeps getting out of sync. Really need to be sample-perfect for this to have a remote chance of working. And still, I'm not accounting for the (variable) delay between what one mic picks up and the time it reaches the other one.

2016-10-21 18:06:22	halfwit	Fuck them. Use something else if you don't like it.
2016-10-21 18:06:56	Max`P	The fucking reason we removed chat is that there's no way on earth we can train 50 support people to fucking chat all day long and be competent enough in every domain to properly answer said fucking chats
2016-10-21 18:07:05	Max`P	Those people are selfish nuts man
2016-10-21 18:07:19	voidead	well customers.. even though they are fucking useless and dumb do pay so sadly you gotta deal with them
2016-10-21 18:07:47	halfwit	Lol
2016-10-21 18:08:22	halfwit	Stupid. Email is superior in every way, unless you're too stupid or lazy to type, that is.
2016-10-21 18:08:29	halfwit	Try getting past a fucking language barrier
2016-10-21 18:08:38	halfwit	It's non-trivial with voice, but a non-issue with email.
2016-10-21 18:12:53	Max`P	By chat it's really just those stupid "text an agent live" thing on websites
2016-10-21 18:13:33	Max`P	Except, you know, this is not IRC. People are dumb on both sides, because no company is retarded enough to hire engineers at $50/h to do chat with customers.
2016-10-21 18:19:00		[18:13]
2016-10-21 18:25:07	halfwit	Oh, yeah.
2016-10-21 18:25:41	voidead	I don't understand why people aren't using irc more 
2016-10-21 18:25:56	voidead	it has been around since before we were born
2016-10-21 18:26:03	Max`P	It sucks it's complicated it's buggy and most clients are utter trash
2016-10-21 18:26:36	voidead	I don't know irc seems to work fine though
2016-10-21 18:27:10	Max`P	And it it doesn't have most of the features people care about. I mean, it doesn't even do stuff as basic as uploading files. That's wayyyy too complicated for the average people
2016-10-21 18:28:04	Max`P	The closest we have come to have a true, compatible communication standard it was XMPP, and everyone dropped the ball so hard on that that even geeks don't give a shit about XMPP anymore it's such a pain
2016-10-21 18:28:21	voidead	lol
2016-10-21 18:28:34	Max`P	It was a pain to implement, it's a pain to get working, and there's litterally no decent client for it.
2016-10-21 18:28:57	Max`P	But it had the potential of working really, really well: it worked just like email. Give an address, bam, servers takes care of connecting people together.
2016-10-21 18:29:04	voidead	email is even older yet people use it without bitching
2016-10-21 18:29:26	Max`P	even email is too complicated for a lot of people, apparently.
2016-10-21 18:29:53	halfwit	Email was designed by the og pc masters
2016-10-21 18:30:41	voidead	then why not use everything modularly 
2016-10-21 18:30:59	voidead	irc for text email for emails etc..
2016-10-21 18:31:07	halfwit	Very smart people without existing shit legacy
2016-10-21 18:31:25	voidead	we don't need some emacs equivalent for communication.. its bloated and unnecessary
2016-10-21 18:31:36	halfwit	mhmm
2016-10-21 18:32:17	Max`P	Well, some people want to share files, some people want to have audio chats, some people want to do video chats, and some people want to do all three at the same time. And those are honestly very valid uses, that IRC can't hope to ever accomplish
2016-10-21 18:32:18	voidead	Slack is a decent idea for normal people.. but even it is shitty
2016-10-21 18:32:19	halfwit	though i like the idea of bitchain backed
2016-10-21 18:32:47	Max`P	Tox has potential tho, if they figure out a way to not have to send freaking public keys to your friends to add you on it
2016-10-21 18:33:05	voidead	Max`P› secure email lol
2016-10-21 18:33:37	Max`P	"Hey cutie, what's your Tox address?" "Sure, that's EBC0 2F1D AC3E 4821 C123 8A65 ....."

2016-10-21 18:34:21	Max`P	If you need to use an external service to connect to someone on any service, you've already lost most people
2016-10-21 18:34:44	Max`P	Facebook: you just give your name, or your email address, or your phone number
2016-10-21 18:34:50	Max`P	Twitter: you send the username directly
2016-10-21 18:35:13	Max`P	WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, and many others: phone number
2016-10-21 18:35:18	Max`P	Snapchat: username or phone number
2016-10-21 18:35:22	Max`P	Hangouts: email address
2016-10-21 18:35:39	voidead	why not a QR code with the public key in it
2016-10-21 18:36:11	halfwit	handles are good enough
2016-10-21 18:36:30	Max`P	IRC: you need an IRC server address, a port, whether it uses SSL, whether you need to register with nickserv or not, configure SASL, and finally either a nickname OR a channel. Oh and they have to join when you happen to be on as well.
2016-10-21 18:36:31	halfwit	@cuntpunisher
2016-10-21 18:36:44	voidead	lol
2016-10-21 18:37:30	Max`P	I mean, I love IRC. But lets not kid ourselves, it's not made for the average people. It's made by geeks, for geeks, that loves to tinker with computers and do weird shit.
2016-10-21 18:37:48	Max`P	The average person wants to download an app on their phone and be done with it already, or go to a website and be done with it.
2016-10-21 18:37:59	voidead	yeah but still it can be popular and useful regardless
2016-10-21 18:38:11	Max`P	Sure, but expecting family and friends to be on it is a lost cause
2016-10-21 18:38:44	voidead	I guess thats why I am using Slack for them
2016-10-21 18:38:58	halfwit	My family can text or call if they need something
2016-10-21 18:39:13	halfwit	Lol
2016-10-21 18:39:17	halfwit	I'm a bad family member.
2016-10-21 18:39:57	voidead	I use Kakao talk to call my family.. its free
2016-10-21 18:40:20	halfwit	But for online, hell a handle is really all you need.
2016-10-21 18:40:22	voidead	its an amazing skype alternative
2016-10-21 18:40:23	Max`P	Yeah my family just text me. It's ancient technology but it works.
2016-10-21 18:40:33	halfwit	Max`P: Again, simple text :p
2016-10-21 18:40:37	halfwit	Lol 
2016-10-21 18:41:12	Max`P	My sister talks to me on Facebook tho, works great. Messenger is very good to be honest, I don't mind it at all. The only issue it has is it's made by Facebook, but other than that it's pretty good
2016-10-21 18:41:55	halfwit	It does phone home a lot, but other than that
2016-10-21 18:41:57	halfwit	I mean, what else does
2016-10-21 18:42:11	halfwit	doesnt*
2016-10-21 18:42:17	Max`P	Well it's a centralized service so it's kind of necessary anyway
2016-10-21 18:42:34	halfwit	Max`P: Yeah. I used to type angry comments, then delete them for therapy
2016-10-21 18:42:38	Max`P	I wish XMPP had one, but for that it would have needed to now be an utter piece of shit
2016-10-21 18:42:47	halfwit	Max`P: Never realized it was sending that
2016-10-21 18:43:17	Max`P	hahaha, oops
2016-10-21 18:43:23	Max`P	Yeah, it only deletes it on your side.
2016-10-21 18:43:47	halfwit	I am a lot happier without Facebook
2016-10-21 18:44:02	Max`P	I'd say it depends a lot on who you have on it
2016-10-21 18:44:11	halfwit	Hm. Yeah.
2016-10-21 18:44:31	Max`P	Unlike Google+, I only friend people I actually care about and hang out with IRL. So my feed is not filled with bullshit all the time
2016-10-21 18:44:45	halfwit	That's good
2016-10-21 18:45:00	Max`P	Tho at 23 I think I'm going to start suffering from the damned baby pictures soon, but deleting people is easy on Facebook :P
2016-10-21 18:45:07	halfwit	Heh.
2016-10-21 18:45:38	halfwit	For me, it was that everyone suddenly developed these opinions, these stances on things - fairweather crusaders everywhere it seemed
2016-10-21 18:46:21	halfwit	And my feeds changed from updates on peoples' lives to nothing but photos, links, shared content
2016-10-21 18:46:37	halfwit	I don't give a flying fuck about a picture with words, when I know the person behind them barely understands the message
2016-10-21 18:46:49	halfwit	:/
2016-10-21 18:47:01	halfwit	I guess I just don't like thta it's become empty and pandering

2016-10-21 18:58:32	cirkit	yeah, gotta give those frontline people a lot of credit

2016-10-21 19:26:43	Max`P	"It is impossible for us to refund you a service that you paid for 6 months ago. Not only is it against our own policy, which you have agreed to upon registering, but none of our payment processors supports refunds after one month. After 6 months, those transactions are considered as finalized."
2016-10-21 19:27:08	Max`P	"There is also no traces of any support request nor any troubleshooting attempt on your account other than this ticket in the 4 months of support history we have, so for all we know your services have been working just fine for all this time and thus we have no reason to refund you for a service that's been working perfectly fine."
2016-10-21 19:27:42	Max`P	Seriously, who the fuck asks for a full refund after 6 months of service claiming it never worked?

2016-10-22 08:21:58	voidead	should I put my external hard drive in /etc/fstab?
2016-10-22 08:22:05	voidead	or just leave it as is
2016-10-22 08:22:17	prg	nothing wrong with putting it in fstab imo
2016-10-22 08:22:32	voidead	I guess unless I'm going to have it hooked up 24/7 there isn't any reason to have it in fstab
2016-10-22 08:22:53	voidead	just hook it up and mount it.. unmount when you are finished etc..
2016-10-22 08:22:56	prg	you can keep it in fstab with your mount options and stuff w/ noauto
2016-10-22 08:23:08	voidead	true
2016-10-22 08:23:22	prg	so you can just "mount <destination>" and it will look in fstab for the rest

2016-10-23 17:05:26	haavard	God damnit, I came up with a magical function that solves my homework, but I forgot how and I've no idea how to explain where it comes from
2016-10-23 17:06:11	Max`P	I'm doing functional programming in JS and I'm not sure if I'm doing a monster or a smart thing
2016-10-23 17:06:38	haavard	kek, functional programming is really cool, but I'm not sure how it works out in JS
2016-10-23 17:07:08	Svibrager	I have no good words to say about JavaScript, mostly because people who write it seem to love doing five hundred levels of nested functions, with 'a, b, c, d' variable names and no documentation to speak of
2016-10-23 17:07:25	Max`P	haavard: function(params, success, failure)
2016-10-23 17:07:26	Svibrager	The language itself is ok, but it seems to bring out the worst in habits haha
2016-10-23 17:07:47	Max`P	yeah it's pretty ugly, but no fibers in JS ><
2016-10-23 17:08:23	haavard	Yeah, I feel like JS attracts a lot of the self-taught brogrammers of the world, which in turn produce a bunch of crap code
2016-10-23 17:08:49	Max`P	That too.
2016-10-23 17:10:19	haavard	Where the fuck did this come from

2016-10-23 19:34:10	bridgesfreezefirst	yeah the black metal collection isn't huge because i'm not super into that genre

2016-10-23 19:42:07	Svibrager	hahah I've got a mere ... 260GB or so. You guys have me way outclassed :D But I found that I just had too much crap that I'd never listen to, so I filtered a lot of it out
2016-10-23 19:42:10	halfwit	I mean it doesn't matter if I get an invite now or later I guess
2016-10-23 19:42:23	Svibrager	It's growing again slowly, but with much better quality control
2016-10-23 19:42:33	halfwit	Svibrager: If I don't like more than a few songs, I'll blow away a whole band :P

2016-10-23 19:42:58	haavard	Svibrager, bridgesfreezefirst: what formats are your collections in?
2016-10-23 19:43:10	haavard	Like, X gb of mp3 is much more than X gb of flac
2016-10-23 19:43:20	halfwit	320kbps actually sounds nice on my shit headphones
2016-10-23 19:43:25	Svibrager	Different - from mp3 to FLAC, but mp3 mostly, averaging 320kbps for the vast majority
2016-10-23 19:43:43	halfwit	Wish I had rather good ones, but
2016-10-23 19:43:44	bridgesfreezefirst	almost all of my shit is in 320 kbps mp3
2016-10-23 19:43:45	haavard	halfwit: anything above v0 (192 kbps) is generally transparent
2016-10-23 19:43:51	bridgesfreezefirst	^exactly
2016-10-23 19:44:21	haavard	I'm a little autistic when it comes to data hoarding so all of my shit is logged FLAC if possible :p
2016-10-23 19:44:29	Svibrager	yeah; I'm not overly picky, but I think I've been listening to shit for long enough that when I hear bad mp3 compression, my ears instantly wither and revolt against it haha
2016-10-23 19:44:59	Svibrager	I used to do that as well, @haavard - but then I had a few system crashes over time, so it became a little less tidy
2016-10-23 19:46:01	Svibrager	I'd like to have a proper FLAC encoding for everything, tagged and logged etc, but at this point I don't think that's ever going to happen haha

2016-10-24 18:47:05	halfwit	I am not "in the scene" enough, so to speak, to find this obscure shit.
2016-10-24 18:47:08	halfwit	So when you guys link it, I'm thankful.
2016-10-24 18:47:55	halfwit	Or really to trawl though the thousand(s) of new music that comes out
2016-10-24 18:52:13	voidead	to be honest
2016-10-24 18:52:13		[18:52]
2016-10-24 18:52:13	voidead	its pretty dumb how some of these guys are with music
2016-10-24 18:52:33	voidead	its like a pissing contest
2016-10-24 18:52:33	voidead	its not about enjoying music
2016-10-24 18:52:44	voidead	their mindset is restrictive
2016-10-24 18:53:06	voidead	there is a lot of great music out there.. and you can find it without searching for obscure demos 
2016-10-24 18:54:23	alyptik	voidead› ++
2016-10-24 18:55:13	halfwit	I'm glad to have other people to curate it for me, honestly.
2016-10-24 18:55:18	halfwit	I know that's kinda lame
2016-10-24 18:55:29	halfwit	And I should be seeking stuff out, but damn if I can put time into it
2016-10-24 18:56:28	alyptik	nah digging is love to me, but it takes a fuckload of time; i can definitely understand someone not being able to spend hours upon hours on it
2016-10-24 18:58:26	voidead	halfwit› well the whole reason the site was made was so that people didn't have to dig for hours to find super obscure shit
2016-10-24 18:58:37	voidead	bridge really just wants everyone to enjoy this music
2016-10-24 18:58:47	halfwit	I really like his stuff
2016-10-24 18:59:09	voidead	yeah most of what he posted is stuff that you will never find
2016-10-24 18:59:28	voidead	and he posted it kind of because he wanted to store it somewhere
2016-10-24 18:59:31	halfwit	Now what I need to do is, 
2016-10-24 18:59:49	halfwit	Find some listing of good bands that aren't as obscure, but I've never found/heard or maybe forgotten
2016-10-24 19:00:49	halfwit	My memory is actually kind of shit.
2016-10-24 19:01:42	voidead	a lot of these obscure bands are obscure for a reason though
2016-10-24 19:01:44	voidead	they suck
2016-10-24 19:01:57	alyptik	lol
2016-10-24 19:02:08	halfwit	lmao
2016-10-24 19:02:47	voidead	not all obscure bands are good
2016-10-24 19:03:07	voidead	but some of these assholes think obscurity is what makes a band great
2016-10-24 19:03:37	halfwit	I think it's more, "They are mine! I found them, I'm unique, holy fuck look at me the snowflake"

2016-10-25 06:27:42	voidead	ah ok
2016-10-25 06:27:47	herring	then in your vps dashboard or whatever somewhere you can set up the reverse ip shit
2016-10-25 06:28:29	herring	reverse dns
2016-10-25 06:29:45	voidead	ah yeah
2016-10-25 06:29:51	voidead	I haven't ever done this before
2016-10-25 06:29:59	voidead	so I'll have to figure out what needs to be worked on
2016-10-25 06:30:04	voidead	also I need to setup LetsEncrypt
2016-10-25 06:30:53	voidead	so I'm trying to add the A record and it asks for "Host" and then "Value" which is my IP Address 
2016-10-25 06:30:57	voidead	but what should I put for Host?
2016-10-25 06:31:00	voidead	Linode?
2016-10-25 06:31:11	herring	on mine i have
2016-10-25 06:31:22	+Anna	well I thought plants as in food.
2016-10-25 06:31:28	herring	@ for host my vps ip for value and automatic for ttl
2016-10-25 06:32:12	voidead	ok
2016-10-25 06:32:47	voidead	that can be changed at any time right?
2016-10-25 06:32:58	voidead	I can change it to my home IP address if I wanted to as well?
2016-10-25 06:33:15	voidead	(which I don't recommend right now) lol
2016-10-25 06:33:52	herring	yeah
2016-10-25 06:33:54	herring	https://ptpb.pw/2QEn.png
2016-10-25 06:35:10	herring	then in my vps settings i pointed that ip at plib.pw
2016-10-25 06:35:24	herring	for the reverse dns
2016-10-25 06:36:18	herring	you dont have to use namecheap for dns either, you can host your own or find a dns hoster
2016-10-25 06:36:22	voidead	definitely need to get LetsEncrypt working lol
2016-10-25 06:36:28	herring	your vps might let you do your own vps too
2016-10-25 06:36:28	voidead	right
2016-10-25 06:36:36	herring	ramnode let me do my own dns
2016-10-25 06:36:48	herring	ovh apparently doesnt
2016-10-25 06:36:55	herring	if they do i couldnt figure it out so i just used namecheap
2016-10-25 06:36:57	voidead	yeah Linode has a "DNS zone"
2016-10-25 06:37:08	herring	letsencrypt takes like two seconds to set up
2016-10-25 06:37:10	herring	its easy af
2016-10-25 06:37:18	herring	just follow the aw
2016-10-25 06:43:00		[06:37]
2016-10-25 06:44:18	herring	and i think if you were to use linode for your dns, you would just plug linode's nameservers into namecheap then set up your records with what ever linode provides you to do that with
2016-10-25 06:46:38	herring	adding nameservers to namecheap is on the same page as the records, at the bottom
2016-10-25 06:49:39	voidead	ah yeah
2016-10-25 06:50:36	herring	id go with linode

2016-10-25 06:50:44	+Anna	Title: DNS Manager Overview (at www.linode.com)
2016-10-25 06:50:49	herring	pretty straight forward
2016-10-25 06:52:14	herring	plug ns1.linode.com and ns2.linode.com into namecheap, use the dns manager on linode to add your domain, set the records, and reverse dns, and thats it.. 
2016-10-25 06:52:59	voidead	yeah
2016-10-25 06:58:00		[06:52]
2016-10-25 06:59:08	Max`P	voidead: note that you can have subdomains too, so even if you point the main domain to Linode you can have a subdomain that points home if you need to
2016-10-25 07:00:54	voidead	Max`P› gotcha
2016-10-25 07:01:03	voidead	Max`P› like home.voidead.pw
2016-10-25 07:04:39	voidead	herring› alright in namecheap I changed it to "custom dns" and added linode's nameservers
2016-10-25 07:05:20	voidead	but for cname/txt/srv records I have no info on the site
2016-10-25 07:06:41	voidead	I wish this site didn't take fucking forever to load
2016-10-25 07:08:13	herring	right, you set the records on linode.. all namecheap should need is the name servers
2016-10-25 07:08:24	+Anna	coffee is good if you haven't heard about http://www.unit731.org/Experiments.html
2016-10-25 07:08:25	herring	afaik
2016-10-25 07:09:09	voidead	ok then
2016-10-25 07:09:24	voidead	so everything will be related to what I do on linode 
2016-10-25 07:11:37	herring	yeah, linodes dns manager should be the only thing you need to use now

2016-10-25 07:54:45	herring	it was working
2016-10-25 07:55:02	herring	ah
2016-10-25 07:55:35	voidead	also linode is taking too god damn long to access 
2016-10-25 07:56:21	herring	in your nginx config did you set up a server section for ssl?
2016-10-25 07:56:52	herring	i have a server section for https and for http
2016-10-25 07:57:02	herring	with http redirected to https
2016-10-25 07:57:13	voidead	I haven't even setup nginx yet
2016-10-25 07:57:21	voidead	I was thinking I'd do that after I got the certs

2016-10-25 08:05:00		[07:59]
2016-10-25 08:12:39	herring	letsencrypt should have made an sever section in your nginx config.. i think all you need to do is set your locations and have the http redirected to https with "rewrite ^ https://$server_name$request_uri? permanent;" under your http server section
2016-10-25 08:13:54	herring	should have a server listening on 443 with your letsencrypt certs and a server listening on 80 with the rewrite ^ https://$server_name$request_uri? permanent; line and your location blocks set under both
2016-10-25 08:14:15	voidead	see I've never done this shit before so I mean

2016-10-25 08:16:44	herring	the fancy index stuff doesnt apply unless you compiled nginx with that plugin

2016-10-25 08:29:29	voidead	I mean I had nginx working fine a while back
2016-10-25 08:29:35	voidead	but even with a good config
2016-10-25 08:29:44	voidead	letsencrypt is being a faggot for some reason

2016-10-25 08:30:10	halfwit	lol
2016-10-25 08:30:48	voidead	honestly I'm just glad I was able to even buy the fucking domain
2016-10-25 08:30:56	halfwit	You got a good one :p
2016-10-25 08:30:57	voidead	fucking faggot ass Korean cards
2016-10-25 08:31:15	voidead	I had to use my American bank card to get it
2016-10-25 08:32:23	halfwit	Lol really?
2016-10-25 08:32:29	voidead	yeah because
2016-10-25 08:32:42	voidead	Korean cards don't use CVC codes.. they use their own special CVC codes
2016-10-25 08:32:53	halfwit	Oh god. 
2016-10-25 08:32:59	voidead	so you literally can't buy shit you want from websites
2016-10-25 08:33:08	voidead	using these faggot Korean bank cards
2016-10-25 08:33:30	voidead	they have some really good security features but god damn
2016-10-25 08:33:46	voidead	I'm quite pissed off about Korean banks
2016-10-25 08:33:59	voidead	but hey I have money.. thats all I have at least
2016-10-25 08:34:02	voidead	fucking dumb asses
2016-10-25 08:34:19	voidead	why have money if you can't even fucking use it
2016-10-25 08:34:40	voidead	I need to transfer money to my American bank just to fucking buy shit I want
2016-10-25 08:35:07	voidead	I was lucky to even pay for Linode all this time
2016-10-25 08:35:22	voidead	somehow Linode accepted the Korean card
2016-10-25 08:36:18	voidead	the main thing that pisses me off though.. you _must_ be a Korean citizen to buy shit from Korean websites
2016-10-25 08:36:23	halfwit	What about paypal?
2016-10-25 08:36:30	voidead	I like buying shit from Korean sites because its shipping free
2016-10-25 08:36:39	voidead	I refuse to use paypal
2016-10-25 08:36:44	voidead	or bitcoin
2016-10-25 08:36:52	halfwit	Oh, ok
2016-10-25 08:37:09	voidead	thats why I have an American bank account
2016-10-25 08:37:09		[08:37]
2016-10-25 08:37:14	voidead	so I can actually buy shit
2016-10-25 08:37:51	voidead	I ask my girlfriend to buy Korean shit with her card since for whatever fucking reason I can't buy it with my own Korean card since I'm not a citizen
2016-10-25 08:37:58	voidead	and I give her cash
2016-10-25 08:38:08	halfwit	Heh, self driving truck drove 120 miles with beer :p
2016-10-25 08:38:15	voidead	yeah I heard about that
2016-10-25 08:38:17	halfwit	Nice
2016-10-25 08:38:29	halfwit	That's good though that you have a way to still do your shit
2016-10-25 08:38:40	voidead	without my girlfriend though.. I literally can't buy certain shit unless I ask a Korean person to buy it
2016-10-25 08:39:00	voidead	thankfully I don't buy much.. I bought like two skateboards from Korean using her card
2016-10-25 08:39:06	voidead	Korea*
2016-10-25 08:39:51	voidead	every citizen has a "PKI" number which they use to securely buy things or do official paperwork etc..
2016-10-25 08:39:59	voidead	and I'll never have a PKI of my own
2016-10-25 08:40:21	halfwit	Hm. If that were in the states, the NSA would love it :p
2016-10-25 08:40:28	halfwit	But I doubt it's like that there
2016-10-25 08:40:41	voidead	also Koreans rely on their phones heavily because they use their phones to securely verify shit all the time 
2016-10-25 08:40:50	halfwit	I really actually like that
2016-10-25 08:40:55	voidead	halfwit› here is the thing though
2016-10-25 08:40:59	halfwit	Mine has the fingerprint scanner, and everything
2016-10-25 08:41:09	voidead	its even more of a security risk than the US setup
2016-10-25 08:41:21	+Anna	I dont want to wait for tomorrow to go to a server
2016-10-25 08:41:40	voidead	using phones is literally the worst thing you could do.. not to mention most of Korea's government still uses XP for shit because of activeX
2016-10-25 08:41:45	voidead	its a clusterfuck 
2016-10-25 08:41:54	halfwit	Hehe
2016-10-25 08:42:06	+Anna	Japan has a task in my class
2016-10-25 08:42:09	voidead	I'm pretty disappointed with Korea's setup
2016-10-25 08:42:15	voidead	its secure.. but actually not really
2016-10-25 08:42:23	voidead	its very very vulnerable to attack
2016-10-25 08:42:25	halfwit	Well, I mean like my purchases, I scan a fingerprint and type in a password, and it does the thing for me
2016-10-25 08:42:34	halfwit	That part I like
2016-10-25 08:42:52	voidead	you can be quite secure in the US too
2016-10-25 08:43:07	voidead	but you know.. people simply aren't secure.. thats the issue
2016-10-25 08:43:18	voidead	usually people get tracked by the NSA because they are dumb
2016-10-25 08:43:22	halfwit	Oh, they'll trade security for ease of use in a heart beat
2016-10-25 08:43:24	voidead	using GPS all the time and shit
2016-10-25 08:44:14	voidead	like Snowden was mentioning.. I mean.. you really have to go through extreme measures to be secure these days
2016-10-25 08:44:17	voidead	but you can be secure
2016-10-25 08:44:33	halfwit	It really does suck
2016-10-25 08:44:44	halfwit	Like, that you have to do all this shit to have what should be a given, heh
2016-10-25 08:45:03	halfwit	That, or just stay offline and not enjoy all the awesome stuff technology does bring
2016-10-25 08:45:10	halfwit	Which i'm not ready to do
2016-10-25 08:45:15	+Anna	considering installing/configuring Mattermost in dev
2016-10-25 08:45:32	voidead	but you know.. texting on Facebook chat using a GPS all the time and clicking on ads and shit.. that is the dumbest thing you could possibly do.. on top of that.. using your phone to do sensitive work.. after you've just compromised everything using GPS/Facebook etc..
2016-10-25 08:45:34	voidead	its a clusterfuck
2016-10-25 08:45:50	halfwit	Yeah.
2016-10-25 08:46:03	halfwit	I still feel like the IoT is about to just destroy the internet
2016-10-25 08:46:06	voidead	its really just common sense
2016-10-25 08:46:39	voidead	here in Korea is worse.. like I said.. there are security features.. but holy shit
2016-10-25 08:46:44	halfwit	Heh.
2016-10-25 08:46:46	voidead	its like 1984 over here
2016-10-25 08:46:48	halfwit	Holy shit is right. 
2016-10-25 08:46:52	voidead	everyone is watching you heavily
2016-10-25 08:46:55	halfwit	Getting like thta here too :(
2016-10-25 08:47:05	halfwit	but at least they aren't going like in those few countries,
2016-10-25 08:47:15	halfwit	After that Ashley Madison thing, and killing people over shit
2016-10-25 08:47:28	halfwit	But it's a small leap
2016-10-25 08:47:32	halfwit	Really, a very small leap
2016-10-25 08:47:46	voidead	you can go to prison for some simple shit over here.. just being a dumb ass with your phone could land you in prison
2016-10-25 08:48:14	halfwit	Scary.
2016-10-25 08:48:28	voidead	South Korea is quite liberal.. but they watch you very heavily
2016-10-25 08:48:32	voidead	track you and shit
2016-10-25 08:48:36	voidead	moreso than the US
2016-10-25 08:48:43	voidead	because they are worried about North Korea
2016-10-25 08:48:48	voidead	and espionage
2016-10-25 08:48:51	voidead	etc..
2016-10-25 08:49:14	voidead	they feel its necessary
2016-10-25 08:49:17	halfwit	NK is pretty shitty to SK, yeah/
2016-10-25 08:49:19	voidead	which I can't really blame them
2016-10-25 08:49:22	halfwit	?
2016-10-25 08:49:42	voidead	surveillance
2016-10-25 08:49:48	voidead	they feel its necessary
2016-10-25 08:49:52	halfwit	I've heard that at very least the tensions are high, but we don't get much over here in the way of media coverage
2016-10-25 08:50:01	voidead	no doubt it is
2016-10-25 08:50:06	voidead	but nothing to be afraid of
2016-10-25 08:50:12	voidead	its all a pissing contest
2016-10-25 08:50:41	voidead	the most he could do is fire off some cold war era rockets and kill a few hundred people
2016-10-25 08:50:55	halfwit	It's really too bad, they have to play there big man games, for the benefit of very few, at the extreme expense of the rest of us
2016-10-25 08:51:09	halfwit	Makes me quite ashamed of humanity in general
2016-10-25 08:51:17	voidead	everyone here in Seoul ignores the threat.. as there really isn't much threat anyways
2016-10-25 08:51:52	halfwit	Exactly. Living like that is horseshit
2016-10-25 08:52:15	voidead	in fact.. everyone else in the world is more worried about North Korea than South Korea
2016-10-25 08:52:15		[08:52]
2016-10-25 08:52:41	voidead	South Koreans are just angry that North Korea exists thats all
2016-10-25 08:53:01	voidead	they are very disgusted that pig is still able to run a country
2016-10-25 08:53:12	halfwit	Me too.

2016-10-25 08:59:05	halfwit	Really though, the world was a way uglier place back then

2016-10-25 13:49:43	voidead	[18:51:17] everyone here in Seoul ignores the threat.. as there really isn't much threat anyways [18:51:17]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	halfwit	[18:51:52] Exactly. Living like that is horseshit [18:51:52]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	voidead	[18:52:15] in fact.. everyone else in the world is more worried about North Korea than South Korea [18:52:15]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	voidead	[18:52:41] South Koreans are just angry that North Korea exists thats all [18:52:41]
2016-10-25 13:49:43	voidead	[18:53:01] they are very disgusted that pig is still able to run a country [18:53:01]

2016-10-25 16:05:29		[16:05]
2016-10-25 17:04:25	Max`P	I think Concerta is working great! Getting late and I don't even feel a dip in concentration, much less brutal than Ritalin
2016-10-25 17:04:25		[17:04]
2016-10-25 17:04:46	alyptik	concerta isn't bad
2016-10-25 17:04:51	alyptik	adderall has spoiled me though
2016-10-25 17:06:37	Max`P	I don't know if I didn't have enough of it, but so far I very much prefer Adderall
2016-10-25 17:07:10	Max`P	Concerta*
2016-10-25 17:07:11	alyptik	it is pretty much unbeatable sans other amp derivatives like dexedrine
2016-10-25 17:07:13	alyptik	oh
2016-10-25 17:07:19	alyptik	how much adderall did you take?
2016-10-25 17:07:24	Max`P	15mg
2016-10-25 17:07:35	alyptik	oh yeah that isn't enough
2016-10-25 17:07:41	alyptik	first time i had to take 30mg to feel anything
2016-10-25 17:08:16	Max`P	Oh it worked, I even stayed on 10mg a few weeks because 15mg was hitting too hard
2016-10-25 17:08:47	alyptik	ah maybe you just prefer how concerta feels
2016-10-25 17:08:53	Max`P	In general I feel like it boosts me, but as if I took 10 coffees and then 5 hours later it just drops
2016-10-25 17:08:55	alyptik	diff for everyone
2016-10-25 17:09:21	Max`P	I liked Ritalin initially, but the emotional rollercoaster drived me crazy
2016-10-25 17:09:30	alyptik	ritalin i never liked
2016-10-25 17:09:41	alyptik	just felt like weird caffeine to me
2016-10-25 17:09:56	Max`P	Concerta feels about the same but much smoother effect, so if it stays that way I'm sold
2016-10-25 17:10:03	alyptik	concerta is supposed to just be ritalin, maybe the XR thing makes it feel different
2016-10-25 17:10:10	Max`P	Yeah
2016-10-25 17:10:41	Max`P	So yeah so far I'm liking it. Makes my head feel a level of quiet I hadn't felt in a long while

2016-10-25 17:57:03	herring	[03:39:10] should just need a basic nginx config [03:39:10]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	voidead	[03:40:28] yeah I'll have to fuck with it later [03:40:28]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	voidead	[03:40:30] I don't have time [03:40:30]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	voidead	[03:40:51] at least everything is working as far as the domain goes [03:40:51]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	Max`P	[03:41:42] The minimal nginx config is tiny, I'm surprised you have so much trouble with it. You should see Apache httpd, it's just pure insanity [03:41:42]

2016-10-25 17:57:03	voidead	[03:42:35] but now I have to wait until after work [03:42:35]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	voidead	[03:43:26] so I have the cert and nginx is working.. I just need to configure everything related to the cert when I come back [03:43:26]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	voidead	[03:44:21] certbot wasn't working until just an hour ago [03:44:21]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	voidead	[03:44:36] and I already used that command last night Max`P and it didn't work [03:44:36]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	voidead	[03:44:40] but now it does [03:44:40]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	voidead	[03:44:42] so who knows [03:44:42]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	herring	[03:45:51] i think all you need to do is add your locations to the https server block in your config, and have http redirect to https [03:45:51]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	herring	[03:46:29] when i did it, letsencrypt added the lines it required to the nginx config [03:46:29]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	voidead	[03:47:12] ah yeah thats what I was trying to do just now.. but no time [03:47:12]
2016-10-25 17:57:03	herring	[03:47:28] i just added my locations like i had them in the http block.. copy/pasted.. then added that line i mentioned earlier to redirect [03:47:28]

2016-10-26 17:18:59	alyptik	lol
2016-10-26 17:19:02	alyptik	good times
2016-10-26 17:19:17	alyptik	be careful though, stims can be a slippery slope
2016-10-26 17:19:21	alyptik	speaking from experience
2016-10-26 17:19:41	halfwit	stims?
2016-10-26 17:20:24	alyptik	adderall, ritalin, concert, meth

2016-10-26 17:20:47	halfwit	Oh stimulants
2016-10-26 17:20:59	+Anna	well
2016-10-26 17:21:53	Max`P	I should be fine, I'm using the dose prescribed by the doctor. Take my pill in the morning, lasts all that. Works plenty as it is, so I don't think I'm going to fall into a slippery slope
2016-10-26 17:22:26	alyptik	that's good
2016-10-26 17:28:00		[17:22]

2016-10-26 17:40:21	alyptik	amp WD's are mostly just boring as fuck
2016-10-26 17:40:45	alyptik	i have never been crippled by boredom ever other than during that
2016-10-26 17:40:59	halfwit	Meth too?
2016-10-26 17:42:05	alyptik	never done it
2016-10-26 17:42:08	alyptik	thankfully
2016-10-26 17:42:17	alyptik	it is pretty much just a feeling of nothing seems worth doing
2016-10-26 17:42:22	alyptik	quite literally
2016-10-26 17:42:31	alyptik	i dont even want to think about what meth would be like
2016-10-26 17:42:41	halfwit	The gf's family, most of them did it

2016-10-26 17:43:12	voidead	halfwit› too many people do meth
2016-10-26 17:43:15	voidead	its pretty ridiculous

2016-10-26 18:32:15	voidead	halfwit› yeah I remember you talking about it
2016-10-26 18:32:19	halfwit	played with preexec to remove the host and pwd I have in my prompt, so it only shows on the very bottom, not after every command
2016-10-26 18:32:33	halfwit	Yeah. 
2016-10-26 18:32:49	halfwit	I just pulled up ahelp menu with delete
2016-10-26 18:33:27	voidead	damn what was it.. I can't remember why I needed del to work 
2016-10-26 18:33:35	voidead	I ended up just opening termite
2016-10-26 18:33:39	voidead	since it has sane defaults
2016-10-26 18:34:01	halfwit	Yeah, with st it's best to have a fallback at very least
2016-10-26 18:34:18	voidead	AH

2016-10-27 10:48:46	herring	on android i have to wait until i can get to the settings, every other option in the menu is available except the only thing anyone uses the menu for which is settings
2016-10-27 10:48:58	+Anna	Max`P: Yeah. I have a few guys who are the exact same instructions we sent to the fact remains.. even if they have always been boring to listen to whatever
2016-10-27 10:49:27	herring	on the desktop it takes a good 10 seconds until i can actually type anything in the address bar
2016-10-27 10:51:04	alyptik	ugh
2016-10-27 10:51:19	alyptik	i really just have to a have a cert for every sub domain huh
2016-10-27 10:52:19	Max`P	herring: because Firefox is a shit browser that's getting very outdated but tries to stay relevant
2016-10-27 10:53:31	Max`P	It was never designed for multi threading or anything related to modern computers. So it's severaly lagging behind, and well, there's just so much stuff (especially IO) that you can do in a single thread without it going dog slow
2016-10-27 10:56:43	alyptik	single thread in chromium omg
2016-10-27 10:56:47	alyptik	thought i would die of old age
2016-10-27 10:57:11	Max`P	alyptik: ?
2016-10-27 10:59:00	alyptik	you can run chromium single process with a flag
2016-10-27 10:59:11	alyptik	no idea why you want to use that ever, but you can
2016-10-27 11:05:00		[10:59]
2016-10-27 11:08:12	Max`P	oh that, yeah I know
2016-10-27 11:08:21	Max`P	Was just confused because we were talking about Firefox
2016-10-27 11:10:52	alyptik	so ff is only one thread always?
2016-10-27 11:10:57	alyptik	didn't know that
2016-10-27 11:11:11	Max`P	They're trying, but yeah it's still mostly single-threaded
2016-10-27 11:11:18	Max`P	Try loading an heavy website and look at the UI stall
2016-10-27 11:11:53	alyptik	does SMP affect mem footprint much; is that why chromium uses 6GB of RAM?
2016-10-27 11:14:33	Max`P	alyptik: 6G? Wtf do you do to your poor Chromium for it to use that much ram? https://d.max-p.me/irc/Capture%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran_2016-10-27_17-13-22.png
2016-10-27 11:14:52	alyptik	Max`P› i have like 30 tabs open hah
2016-10-27 11:15:00	alyptik	well nowadays it is lke 2G
2016-10-27 11:15:15	alyptik	thank god for --memory-model=low
2016-10-27 11:15:53	Max`P	it never used that much ram for me really
2016-10-27 11:16:14	alyptik	how does nginx handle proxying?
2016-10-27 11:16:27	alyptik	like making mpd.alyp.tk proxy to alyp.tk:8000
2016-10-27 11:16:32	alyptik	how well
2016-10-27 11:16:49	alyptik	Max`P› could be my million extensions too
2016-10-27 11:17:16	Max`P	alyptik: server { server_name mpd.alyp.tk; listen 80; location / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000; } }
2016-10-27 11:17:30	alyptik	wow seriously that's it
2016-10-27 11:17:33	Max`P	Yes
2016-10-27 11:17:41	Max`P	Why do you think everyone says httpd is bloated as fuck
2016-10-27 11:17:41	+Anna	cirkit: Would you mind help me for not as good as Python or Ruby or *shrug* Perl
2016-10-27 11:17:43	alyptik	fuck me maybe i will switch to nginx

2016-10-27 12:02:12	Max`P	Firefox became obsolete the day Chromium was released
2016-10-27 12:03:19	Max`P	Even back in the Chromium 1.0 days the difference was so huge Firefox felt like Internet Explorer compared to Chromium. Switched on day one and practically never looked back
2016-10-27 12:03:58	Max`P	It's so bad I'd actually prefer using Microsoft Edga than Firefox, because at least that one is fast too

2016-10-27 13:06:11	Max`P	alyptik: that's just a library around the already quite old and widespread dbus
2016-10-27 13:06:25	alyptik	i am trying to understand it atm

2016-10-27 13:10:06	Max`P	alyptik: it's basically a generic interface for programs to talk to eachother. For example, most music players broadcast their status over dbus, so other software can catch it and act on it. That's how most generic media control applets are made
2016-10-27 13:10:40	Max`P	Another example is NetworkManager. You don't talk to NetworkManager directly using a custom protocol. It just uses dbus and you send commands to it
2016-10-27 13:11:57	alyptik	oo
2016-10-27 13:12:03	alyptik	so IPC
2016-10-27 13:12:06	alyptik	basically
2016-10-27 13:12:35	alyptik	that is a lot simpler
2016-10-27 13:12:48	Max`P	Yea, literally the second sentence of the article: "sd-bus is our minimal D-Bus IPC C library, supporting as back-ends both classic socket-based D-Bus and kdbus."
2016-10-27 13:12:49	alyptik	most docs explain how to use API in C but not what it actually does
2016-10-27 13:13:03	Svibrager	@Max P, yeah I know what you mean about Edge. Even with its flaws it's still better

2016-10-28 03:24:33	voidead	he is probably just some sociopath 
2016-10-28 03:24:38	voidead	he isn't mentall ill
2016-10-28 03:24:44	voidead	metally*
2016-10-28 03:24:48	voidead	mentally*
2016-10-28 03:24:50	voidead	whichever
2016-10-28 03:27:05	MHD	i dont care how mentally ill he is he can fucking die
2016-10-28 03:27:16	voidead	right
2016-10-28 03:27:18	voidead	I agree
2016-10-28 03:27:37	MHD	when a crime becomes grievous enough.. i think considerations for mental illness, 'not knowing wrong from right' etc should be ignored
2016-10-28 03:27:58	voidead	I agree
2016-10-28 03:28:00	voidead	fuck them
2016-10-28 03:28:03	voidead	they are a pest
2016-10-28 03:28:09	voidead	and should be exterminated
2016-10-28 03:28:13	MHD	haha
2016-10-28 03:28:22	MHD	nah i have a friend with a serious mental illness
2016-10-28 03:28:27	MHD	guarantee she would never hurt anyone though
2016-10-28 03:28:36	voidead	MHD› well I wasn't talking about someone like your friend
2016-10-28 03:28:40	MHD	yea
2016-10-28 03:28:41	voidead	I'm talking about someone like that asshole
2016-10-28 03:28:44	MHD	i mean when it comes to murder, serial killers etc
2016-10-28 03:28:49	MHD	i dont care how mentally ill they are
2016-10-28 03:29:00	MHD	even if it was legitimately true they didnt realise they were doing something wrong
2016-10-28 03:29:02	MHD	i dont care
2016-10-28 03:29:30	voidead	ultimately.. people die and there is no justification for murder
2016-10-28 03:29:33	voidead	in that case
2016-10-28 03:30:10	MHD	some murders can be justified. not from a legal perspective, but the legal perspective can still consider the justifications
2016-10-28 03:30:29	MHD	ie you murder someone that rapes your daughter or wife or something
2016-10-28 03:31:03	voidead	well yeah
2016-10-28 03:31:05	voidead	but I mean
2016-10-28 03:31:15	voidead	in this case.. obviously this asshole should be exterminated
2016-10-28 03:31:15		[03:31]
2016-10-28 03:31:36	MHD	yeah no questions asked
2016-10-28 03:31:51	MHD	if the first policeman on the scene walked up and shot him in the face i would have applauded
2016-10-28 03:32:03	voidead	hell I'd fucking grab a gun and do it myself if I was a loved one who was killed like that
2016-10-28 03:32:17	voidead	who was associated with the victim*
2016-10-28 03:32:43	MHD	yeah

2016-10-28 03:33:37	voidead	and you know.. my uncle is the type to grab a gun and hunt that guy down who murdered him.. and if he wasn't in police custody you bet my uncle would have probably hunted his ass down
2016-10-28 03:33:46	MHD	have they established why the guy did it?
2016-10-28 03:33:58	+Anna	I don't have to wait around until a couple letters of the clients to use
2016-10-28 03:34:06	voidead	MHD› its a bit complicated.. but I think it was over a woman 
2016-10-28 03:34:10	voidead	and money
2016-10-28 03:34:18	voidead	that isn't the whole story
2016-10-28 03:34:23	voidead	but basically.. something like that
2016-10-28 03:34:50	voidead	they still haven't finished with the investigation
2016-10-28 03:34:54	MHD	ah okay
2016-10-28 03:35:57	voidead	there was a chick they both were into (some ugly fat bitch.. which to me is ridiculous) and I know my cousin and him were going to collborate on some music material after years of that guy being kicked out of the band.. well my cousin wanted him back and they are actually really good friends
2016-10-28 03:36:08	voidead	but that guy must have had a thing for the chick my cousin was about to marry
2016-10-28 03:36:23	voidead	not to mention something to do with the band
2016-10-28 03:36:29	voidead	hell if I know honestly
2016-10-28 03:36:36	voidead	but I'm assuming its related to that

2016-10-28 06:57:29	voidead	true
2016-10-28 06:57:34	voidead	but I actually do like the red tint
2016-10-28 06:57:56	herring	like redshift -O 6400 -b 5 would just be normal color just not as bright
2016-10-28 06:58:24	alyptik	i think the idea is filter out blue light
2016-10-28 06:58:29	alyptik	but there are a lot of ways to do it
2016-10-28 06:58:45	herring	i like the red tint too, ive been using it so long the red tinted colors are normal to me and default colors are weird

2016-10-28 11:55:57		[11:55]
2016-10-28 11:56:10	alyptik	the cert works for my https but not this
2016-10-28 11:56:45	alyptik	now it just get no cert even found lol'
2016-10-28 11:58:43	Max`P	alyptik: I think weechat uses one big cert right?
2016-10-28 11:58:55	Max`P	like, not a separate key and cert file
2016-10-28 11:59:01	alyptik	not sure; the pem files look the same
2016-10-28 11:59:04	alyptik	oh yeah
2016-10-28 11:59:31	alyptik	my old self signed and my current pem seem to have same format
2016-10-28 12:00:01	Max`P	Yeah but I mean, what does the relay take?
2016-10-28 12:00:28	Max`P	Anyway, I think you need to cat the privkey.pem with the fullchain.pem for Weechat if I remember right
2016-10-28 12:00:35	alyptik	alright lemme try that
2016-10-28 12:06:00		[12:00]
2016-10-28 12:06:13	alyptik	there we go

2016-10-28 12:10:13	alyptik	that is likely the cause of 90% of our issues
2016-10-28 12:10:14	alyptik	ha
2016-10-28 12:12:51	Max`P	I think it is. When you don't understand exactly what you're doing it's easy to get all kinds of confused trying different things
2016-10-28 12:13:04	alyptik	indeed
2016-10-28 12:13:13	Max`P	And of course the web nowadays is filled of blogs of people claiming to know how to set things up and it turns out the whole article is full of shit
2016-10-28 12:13:28	Max`P	Look at every PHP+nginx articles out there, it's catastrophic
2016-10-28 12:14:05	Max`P	ifs and all kinds of ridiculous crap, while the actual minimal config is like 5 lines INCLUDING the location block definition
2016-10-28 12:14:44	halfwit	that's the big problem with getting in to any of this
2016-10-28 12:14:48	halfwit	So much misinformation
2016-10-28 12:15:06	halfwit	Need a bot that trawls through all the shit for us, so you can query it for the proper how-to :p
2016-10-28 12:15:14	halfwit	If you write such a bot, gimme.
2016-10-28 12:16:20	Max`P	Personally I think the best howto is to rtfm

2016-10-28 15:44:38	voidead	I don't know why you use Gentoo unless you have a really bad ass desktop which can compile faster.. even then its pointless
2016-10-28 15:44:42	voidead	may as well just use archlinux

2016-10-28 16:32:51	herring	pot addicts are dangerous af
2016-10-28 16:33:12	herring	they all carry slicers around
2016-10-28 16:33:21	voidead	he obviously had some mental issues because he was doing some strange shit with his head.. but you know.. you'd think ignoring those crazy assholes would deter them.. but this dude couldn't handle it.. he was screaming as loud as he could the whole time I was walking away from him lol
2016-10-28 16:34:18	voidead	if he came at me I'd have to try to beat the fuck out of him or get stabbed or something.. either way I was ready to fight to the death
2016-10-28 16:34:22	voidead	but he didn't know that
2016-10-28 16:34:55	alyptik	fucking town rofl 
2016-10-28 16:34:57	voidead	I didn't have anything on me.. so I was vulnerable if he had a knife or gun

2016-10-28 16:38:06	voidead	I think if I showed a lot of fear like one of those tourists who freak out and cry and shit.. I'd be fucked
2016-10-28 16:38:20	voidead	anyways.. I've learned to ignore people
2016-10-28 16:38:27	voidead	I've been lucky
2016-10-28 16:38:53	voidead	if you show fear assholes are triggered
2016-10-28 16:39:23	alyptik	very true
2016-10-28 16:39:34	alyptik	that is like first thing I learned here lol
2016-10-28 16:39:35	voidead	I am not fearful usually because I know how to fight.. but still.. you can't defend yourself in all situations.. sometimes you truly are fucked

2016-10-28 20:03:09	cirkit	Max`P: well yeah lol
2016-10-28 20:03:17	cirkit	maybe not proof...maybe he just found it on the internet?
2016-10-28 20:03:24	cirkit	and is trying to seem hardcore? 
2016-10-28 20:03:25	Max`P	Does that contains like, actual source code?
2016-10-28 20:03:33	cirkit	it's just a screenshot
2016-10-28 20:03:35	halfwit	I'm not smart enough to keep myself perfectly safe from hackers, no way in hell I'd attempt to be a hacker
2016-10-28 20:03:37	Max`P	Because like that, it just looks like he had a bit of wget fun
2016-10-28 20:03:46	bridgesfreezefirst	well i hope he has a good excuse when his stupid ass gets questioned by the FBI
2016-10-28 20:03:48	+Anna	this weekend either
2016-10-28 20:03:54	cirkit	bridgesfreezefirst: if they can find him/her
2016-10-28 20:04:02	cirkit	i imagine he/she is using a proxy
2016-10-28 20:04:10	bridgesfreezefirst	well i would fucking hope so
2016-10-28 20:04:24	cirkit	bridgesfreezefirst: is there any probable cause here to prosecute someone like that?
2016-10-28 20:04:55	bridgesfreezefirst	i would think any investigator would start by contacting the victim
2016-10-28 20:05:27	bridgesfreezefirst	a commercial enterprise would probably know they are being hacked long before law enforcement would, most likely
2016-10-28 20:05:49	alyptik	for sure
2016-10-28 20:05:52	bridgesfreezefirst	it would be really unusual if the gov't found a problem BEFORE a webhost did
2016-10-28 20:06:01	alyptik	way more motivation
2016-10-28 20:06:07	bridgesfreezefirst	or an IT dept, whatever
2016-10-28 20:06:20	cirkit	IMO real hackers work in professional jobs in Information Security
2016-10-28 20:06:28	cirkit	not fucking being a menance to the cyber world
2016-10-28 20:06:50	cirkit	all the real hackers i've known in InfoSec in large enterprise companies were totally respectable
2016-10-28 20:07:03	voidead	well everyone lies about who they really are on the internet
2016-10-28 20:07:03		[20:07]
2016-10-28 20:07:06	bridgesfreezefirst	so this *alone* probably wouldn't provide probable cause, but might be enough for a visit without a search warrant
2016-10-28 20:07:06	cirkit	i actually met a hacker this week...well, he now works in InfoSec for SLACK
2016-10-28 20:07:22	cirkit	i replaced his former position before he left
2016-10-28 20:07:33	alyptik	if you are that good you didn't get there by caring if other people think you are good 
2016-10-28 20:07:34	halfwit	cirkit: That's about what I'd assume, really.
2016-10-28 20:07:45	alyptik	applies to life really, hah
2016-10-28 20:07:49	halfwit	cirkit: There were kids that got into trouble that I knew growing up, getting caught hacking shit
2016-10-28 20:08:03	halfwit	cirkit: But now they are all deep into that type of work,
2016-10-28 20:08:10	alyptik	most of the script kiddies just want attention
2016-10-28 20:08:35	cirkit	yeah halfwit

2016-10-28 20:08:54	cirkit	a lot of the "black" hat hackers who got in trouble and shit now work for good companies
2016-10-28 20:09:01	cirkit	it's better that way...get paid to hack, fuck it
2016-10-28 20:09:48	halfwit	Yep
2016-10-28 20:09:55	cirkit	the InfoSec dude i met who i replaced at the former company he was with (now where i am) went to Defcon in Vegas this year 
2016-10-28 20:10:01	cirkit	wish i could go to one...would be neat
2016-10-28 20:10:12	+Anna	They would say, voidead please provide a lot more sane than most death metal

2016-10-28 20:21:10	voidead	thats why I like this network
2016-10-28 20:21:25	halfwit	Yep.
2016-10-28 20:21:43	halfwit	I swear, I'm good at a ton of shit that just hasn't come up yet
2016-10-28 20:22:10	voidead	you certainly have a few skills that is undeniable
2016-10-28 20:22:10		[20:22]
2016-10-28 20:22:19	voidead	more than a few
2016-10-28 20:23:19	cirkit	i'd say halfwit like Max`P are skilled programmers aka hackers
2016-10-28 20:23:26	cirkit	wish i knew more about that shit
2016-10-28 20:23:36	halfwit	Max`P is better than me :p
2016-10-28 20:23:40	voidead	people think all this linux stuff is meaningless playing.. but actually its quite usefule knowledge that we shouldn't take for granted
2016-10-28 20:23:53	voidead	useful*
2016-10-28 20:24:09	cirkit	Linux is easy these days
2016-10-28 20:24:47	cirkit	i think even non-technical people can use Linux....more user-friendly distros like Ubuntu 
2016-10-28 20:24:48	halfwit	Takes a while to grasp all the parts though
2016-10-28 20:25:16	cirkit	we use Ubuntu servers at work for a lot of shit...our infrastructure manager had a meeting with Canonical today for some support shit
2016-10-28 20:25:35	cirkit	it's really not that bad unless you're an elitist and are like omg no Ubuntu U NOOBZ
2016-10-28 20:25:57	cirkit	i still personally prefer Arch though :P
2016-10-28 20:26:02	voidead	but knowing the ins and outs is quite valuable information
2016-10-28 20:26:09	halfwit	Eh, I just don't care for their userland and packaging, it's not that theres' something terrible wrong with it
2016-10-28 20:26:09	+Anna	It's been going through
2016-10-28 20:26:10	cirkit	yeah, no doubt
2016-10-28 20:26:36	cirkit	i'd pick Debian over anything Red Hat
2016-10-28 20:26:41	Max`P	wow, my SSD was in dire need of some trimming
2016-10-28 20:26:49	cirkit	:O
2016-10-28 20:27:06	voidead	in fact.. that reminds me.. I know people who are in their 60s who know shit we would die to know 
2016-10-28 20:27:13	halfwit	I like how Arch follows upstream. It helps everything, since the issues go right to the devs, rather than each group patching in a fix, for example
2016-10-28 20:27:15	Max`P	I knew it was bad but holy shit trimming those 100GB makes it fly
2016-10-28 20:27:39	halfwit	Max`P: Thank you for reminding me
2016-10-28 20:27:50	cirkit	Max`P: what do you do to trim an SSD?
2016-10-28 20:27:58	cirkit	not sure if i heard of this
2016-10-28 20:28:10	Max`P	sudo fstrim -v /path/to/mountpoint
2016-10-28 20:28:16	cirkit	ah
2016-10-28 20:28:26	Max`P	If you mount with the discard option you don't need that
2016-10-28 20:28:29	halfwit	^
2016-10-28 20:28:36	halfwit	I was blanking o the damn name, lol
2016-10-28 20:29:04	halfwit	btrfs scrub for me \o/
2016-10-28 20:30:14	cirkit	is it really a significant difference with fstrim SSD?
2016-10-28 20:30:23	alyptik	i always mount with discard so idk tbh
2016-10-28 20:30:32	Max`P	erasing blocks on SSDs is apparently expensive
2016-10-28 20:30:40	Max`P	like, whole computer hang expensive while saving a VM
2016-10-28 20:30:52	alyptik	is that why zswap freezes me?
2016-10-28 20:30:54	alyptik	shit
2016-10-28 20:31:05	alyptik	it actually makes sense now
2016-10-28 20:31:15	alyptik	been trying to figure that out for weeks
2016-10-28 20:31:32	halfwit	there was a bit of shit about discard wearing your drives prematurely, but iirc that isn't really an issue anymore
2016-10-28 20:31:34	cirkit	sigh
2016-10-28 20:31:37	cirkit	for fuck sake
2016-10-28 20:31:42	cirkit	more spammers on Steel Republic
2016-10-28 20:32:03	cirkit	not sure how they're getting through...already fucking tweaked everything in the security settings and all
2016-10-28 20:32:10	MHD	%np
2016-10-28 20:32:11	+Anna	MHD: fuck1111 listened to "Decom-Posuer" by NOFX [The War on Errorism] more than 7 minutes ago
2016-10-28 20:32:14	MHD	today is pop punk day
2016-10-28 20:32:16	MHD	fuck their lyrics are faggy
2016-10-28 20:32:24	alyptik	last i heard modern SSD is like 10TB write life or something
2016-10-28 20:32:52	halfwit	alyptik: yeah, they're no longer terrible :p
2016-10-28 20:35:04	halfwit	Tired
2016-10-28 20:35:25	halfwit	The son is still awake, dunno what's going on with him lately, but he's been sleeping terribly
2016-10-28 20:35:45	alyptik	i guess it makes sense zswap prob stores it's cache as a single block so if you have to evict a large amount at once you will freeze
2016-10-28 20:35:49	alyptik	halfwit› how old?
2016-10-28 20:35:54	halfwit	3
2016-10-28 20:36:03	alyptik	my neice was like that too
2016-10-28 20:36:03	halfwit	alyptik: How is zfs on an SSD?
2016-10-28 20:36:11	halfwit	Also, ZOL
2016-10-28 20:36:11	alyptik	not using zfs
2016-10-28 20:36:13	halfwit	?
2016-10-28 20:36:15	alyptik	zswap
2016-10-28 20:36:29	halfwit	Thought that was zfs specific, hm
2016-10-28 20:36:31	alyptik	same sort of thing though'
2016-10-28 20:36:33	alyptik	afaik
2016-10-28 20:36:35	halfwit	Must be confusing it.
2016-10-28 20:36:40	alyptik	nah it is in mainline kernel for a while
2016-10-28 20:36:57	voidead	this is the most you people have talked in months
2016-10-28 20:37:03	alyptik	lol

2016-10-28 20:37:18	alyptik	i am working on my nginx config atm

2016-10-28 20:37:25	alyptik	that*
2016-10-28 20:37:39	halfwit	I didn't really have much trouble with nginx
2016-10-28 20:38:03	cirkit	i have way too much Apache configurations to give a fuck about migrating them to Nginx
2016-10-28 20:38:11	cirkit	not worth the trouble imo
2016-10-28 20:39:09	cirkit	maybe i'll use Vagrant to deploy a quick VM and fuck with Nginx a bit
2016-10-28 20:39:17	cirkit	really only ever used Nginx for reverse proxy
2016-10-28 20:39:57	halfwit	Heh, you've done more in Nginx than I have, then :p
2016-10-28 20:40:28	cirkit	Nginx drove me fucking nuts trying to get it to cooperate with PHP
2016-10-28 20:40:32	halfwit	Yeah.
2016-10-28 20:40:51	halfwit	There was some stupidity in the PHP configs, and the Nginx I had to fuck with to get anything out of it
2016-10-28 20:41:50	cirkit	ah yeah
2016-10-28 20:42:05	 *	cirkit suspects Max`P is losing his mind with PHP in Nginx :P
2016-10-28 20:43:09	Max`P	?
2016-10-28 20:43:39	halfwit	cirkit: have you ever fucked around in PHP?
2016-10-28 20:43:46	halfwit	cirkit: I don't really like it
2016-10-28 20:44:22	cirkit	yeah, halfwit .. i have
2016-10-28 20:44:26	cirkit	don't care much for it
2016-10-28 20:44:44	cirkit	Max`P: in my experience and probably many others trying to get PHP to cooperate in Nginx is a nightmare 
2016-10-28 20:45:13	halfwit	k, night o/

2016-10-29 08:34:44	+Anna	did they say?
2016-10-29 08:34:51	alyptik	Anna› they did
2016-10-29 08:36:24	halfwit	Apparently, only one proc runs on dd-wrt 
2016-10-29 08:37:07	halfwit	I've been wanting just a dedicated pfSense or such box for awhile though
2016-10-29 08:37:20	halfwit	Then just use this router as nothing more than an AP
2016-10-29 08:37:22	alyptik	yeah it is only one 
2016-10-29 08:37:25	alyptik	kinda crazy
2016-10-29 08:37:52	halfwit	Lol, this thing
2016-10-29 08:38:35	alyptik	my router is crappy stock; i bricked it trying to flash ddwrt first time and sent it back saying it was defective

2016-10-29 08:39:22	halfwit	I guess I'll stick with stock for a bit, until I repurpose it as just an AP
2016-10-29 08:39:30	alyptik	can you ssh in?
2016-10-29 08:39:32	alyptik	on stock
2016-10-29 08:39:37	halfwit	I don't know
2016-10-29 08:39:53	alyptik	if you can get entware on it is it pretty close to ddwrt functionality

2016-10-29 08:41:07	alyptik	if i feel adventurous maybe i'll try again
2016-10-29 08:41:48	halfwit	I'm thinking that something like this would be adept in a filter box, even better than those little pfSense rigs http://www.adiengineering.com/products/minnowboard-turbot-duale/

2016-10-29 09:05:21	alyptik	it was prob some shitty PKGBUILD
2016-10-29 09:05:32	halfwit	Yeah, most likely.
2016-10-29 09:05:50	halfwit	I grab PKGBUILDs, then always edit the fuck out of them :/

2016-10-29 09:06:05	alyptik	i do to, but who knows

2016-10-29 09:11:44	alyptik	not sure why i didnt uninstall it
2016-10-29 09:11:46	halfwit	What I really want is, mpd meets video 
2016-10-29 09:11:59	halfwit	Like set up a playlist, have clients to select shit, discovery, and streaming
2016-10-29 09:12:00	alyptik	mpv ofc is the best, but sometimes you are lazy and want a gui
2016-10-29 09:12:20	alyptik	halfwit› mpv man
2016-10-29 09:12:31	alyptik	it can do all of that and more

2016-10-29 09:14:18	herring	some extra cash for me
2016-10-29 09:14:21	halfwit	alyptik: It can do it per client easily enough, and I (ab)use that
2016-10-29 09:15:17	halfwit	ffserver though, maybe.
2016-10-29 09:16:17	alyptik	oh you mean actual server
2016-10-29 09:16:22	halfwit	Yep.
2016-10-29 09:16:23	alyptik	never ran a video server
2016-10-29 09:16:36	halfwit	DLNA works pretty good
2016-10-29 09:17:13	halfwit	And I do use it, but I want something more like... I watch a video on machine A, then switch to machine B and pick up where I left off
2016-10-29 09:17:37	alyptik	oh that is interesting
2016-10-29 09:17:45	alyptik	so like casting over IP
2016-10-29 09:18:38	halfwit	You basically run ffserver, bind it to some ip/port
2016-10-29 09:19:35	halfwit	Then ffmpeg -i myfile http;//thatip:port/feed.ffm
2016-10-29 09:20:05	halfwit	ffmpeg has no notion of a playlist or anything though, or youtube-dl integration that I know of

2016-10-29 09:23:46	 *	halfwit saves anyways so he doesn't have to do so much work
2016-10-29 09:25:23	halfwit	Can control what ffmpeg is doing in a script, no big deal
2016-10-29 09:25:32	halfwit	Heh
2016-10-29 09:25:35	halfwit	Colo
2016-10-29 09:25:54	alyptik	i am bad at ffmpeg
2016-10-29 09:26:08	halfwit	It's retardedly flexible
2016-10-29 09:26:17	alyptik	i only know ffmpeg -i foo.bar bar.foo

2016-10-29 09:26:17	alyptik	hah
2016-10-29 09:26:40	halfwit	So with this, you can serve to an IP on your network, then play it with anything that streams - VLC, mpv, browser
2016-10-29 09:26:53	halfwit	But controlling it would be all implemented by yourself
2016-10-29 09:27:30	alyptik	so you send signals to it like mpc
2016-10-29 09:28:06	halfwit	Ye. 
2016-10-29 09:28:27	halfwit	it's not elegant, which is why I want something more like mpd, where it's got something in place for playlist management through clients
2016-10-29 09:28:38	halfwit	But no reason why someone couldn't make such a thing I guess
2016-10-29 09:28:53	halfwit	Think you can do this with vlc though
2016-10-29 09:29:02	alyptik	i guess not many people serve  video
2016-10-29 09:29:08	alyptik	a ton of bandwidth
2016-10-29 09:29:11	halfwit	Yep.
2016-10-29 09:29:20	halfwit	I'm on gigabit ethernet at least :p

2016-10-29 11:45:54	Max`P	I think I actually just send it to my desktop directly all the time whether it wants them or not
2016-10-29 11:49:20	halfwit	mpd makes it pretty easy to do more than that, stream on a few ports + relate them to different endpoints in the lan, turn them on and off with mpddroid or whatever

2016-10-29 11:52:48	halfwit	httpd is the easiest way 
2016-10-29 11:53:14	alyptik	wait i think by socket i meant http
2016-10-29 11:53:17	alyptik	w/e icecast does
2016-10-29 11:53:27	alyptik	i just call all TCP connections sockets hah
2016-10-29 11:53:32	halfwit	hehe
2016-10-29 11:53:47	Max`P	Well, that's mostly true
2016-10-29 11:53:53	Max`P	They,re all sockets
2016-10-29 11:54:23	haavard	You need to get better quality apostrophes, Max`P. They keep falling to the floor
2016-10-29 11:54:23		[11:54]
2016-10-29 11:54:24	Max`P	You can have raw TCP, you can have HTTP (on top of TCP), which is the HTTP query + the stream as a response. And then there's websockets, which is like TCP on top of HTTP on top of TCP.

2016-10-29 11:58:54	halfwit	Seedbox time! 
2016-10-29 11:59:09	haavard	Yeah.. it has *never* been snatched, so the original uploader is the only possible seeder
2016-10-29 11:59:43	haavard	When he eventually comes online, the true power of Bittorrent will show itself when it's distributed to everyone
2016-10-29 12:00:00	Max`P	Yeah
2016-10-29 12:02:58	halfwit	Damn kids and there bit torrents.

2016-10-29 12:05:06	Max`P	I think it's mostly that they don't give a shit about copyright
2016-10-29 12:05:32	halfwit	I don't give a shit about copyright, honestly. But I do have to stay out of jail
2016-10-29 12:05:35	alyptik	true komrades
2016-10-29 12:05:53	haavard	It's no coincidence that torrent trackers and file-sharing sites are often based in eastern yuropean countries
2016-10-29 12:06:09	Max`P	If you want sketchy shit, russia is the way to go
2016-10-29 12:06:21	alyptik	i even wrote a script to open a whole tracklist in vk

2016-10-29 12:09:38	alyptik	has to be some tradeoff
2016-10-29 12:09:40	Max`P	LimeWire and others you'd download a file and half the time it was in shit quality or not the right thing at all
2016-10-29 12:09:57	haavard	So much shitty stuff downloaded from Limewire
2016-10-29 12:10:09	Max`P	right

2016-10-29 12:11:54	Max`P	If you look at the search monitor of those P2P clients, it's incredible the amount of REALLY sketchy searches that goes through

2016-10-29 12:46:46	halfwit	Max`P: I almost wanna try that.
2016-10-29 12:46:46		[12:46]
2016-10-29 12:47:01	halfwit	Max`P: The pulseaudio thing
2016-10-29 12:47:14	halfwit	But I need a way to turn things off
2016-10-29 12:48:41	Max`P	You can if you unload the module. Personally I've made myself a custom default.pa and I'm sure not looking back
2016-10-29 12:48:48	halfwit	Nice
2016-10-29 12:49:07	Max`P	I can help you with that if you need help, I'm really good with PA
2016-10-29 12:49:46	alyptik	pulseaudio --kill
2016-10-29 12:49:54	alyptik	i do it all the time to use jack
2016-10-29 12:50:08	Max`P	I use both cooperatively ^^
2016-10-29 12:50:10	halfwit	Max`P: Not at the moment at lesat.
2016-10-29 12:50:12	halfwit	least*
2016-10-29 12:50:13	alyptik	:D
2016-10-29 12:50:27	haavard	I'm so glad pretty much all my Linux issues were fixed by a few kernel releases
2016-10-29 12:50:28	alyptik	startup also easy, just pulseaudio --start heh
2016-10-29 12:50:35	haavard	It's a good thing I gave up on trying to fix shit for my laptop
2016-10-29 12:50:38	Max`P	I need jack to drive my sound card (thanks USB)
2016-10-29 12:50:45	alyptik	lol
2016-10-29 12:50:54	Max`P	So I always have PA pipe to jaco anyway
2016-10-29 12:51:12	Max`P	Jack*
2016-10-29 12:51:42	alyptik	i use a lot of vanilla alsa too so i kill it then
2016-10-29 12:51:52	alyptik	pulse eats my soundcards
2016-10-29 12:51:53	alyptik	:[
2016-10-29 12:52:12	Max`P	Most apps expect PA nowadays so everyone play nice and when I really want to, jack is already running so I just change the connections
2016-10-29 12:52:48	Max`P	Oh yeah pure alsa is a full world of pain with my sound card
2016-10-29 12:53:02	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-29 12:53:07	alyptik	jack is nice with the pulse sink
2016-10-29 12:53:12	alyptik	alsa not so much
2016-10-29 12:53:37	haavard	I find it interesting that Linux can use my USB DAC out of the box while Windows 10 needs a driver
2016-10-29 12:53:52	alyptik	lol
2016-10-29 12:53:52	haavard	It uses the USB audio standard from like 10 years ago
2016-10-29 12:53:54	haavard	Fucking Windows
2016-10-29 12:54:13	Max`P	The pulse plugin for alsa has worked great for me, but I also have a nice static config for it
2016-10-29 12:54:28	alyptik	well my apps use also to grab cards
2016-10-29 12:54:35	alyptik	pulse sadly can't grab single cards
2016-10-29 12:54:36	alyptik	all or nothing
2016-10-29 12:54:58	Max`P	You can with a manual config
2016-10-29 12:55:30	Max`P	You can even have it not grab at all if you have it use dmix, but it's not recommended
2016-10-29 12:56:28	alyptik	i need to grab with realtime
2016-10-29 12:56:42	alyptik	like 100% needs to ignore everything else
2016-10-29 12:57:17	alyptik	mixxx btw if you are wondering
2016-10-29 12:57:36	halfwit	I guess you could use alsa to toggle the sinks
2016-10-29 12:57:53	alyptik	muh pops
2016-10-29 12:58:37	Max`P	Oh yeah I used mixxx long ago
2016-10-29 12:58:42	cirkit	at some Korean bbq place with chick
2016-10-29 12:58:51	Max`P	When I use it I go the jack route
2016-10-29 12:59:15	cirkit	voidead: the Korean chick at the front check-in is hot
2016-10-29 12:59:29	cirkit	goddamn i need Korean home girls
2016-10-29 13:01:33	halfwit	Max`P: Hell, you could set up audio_outputs in mpd for every different sink on the network without much trouble
2016-10-29 13:05:39	halfwit	Max`P: For pulse
2016-10-29 13:05:39		[13:05]
2016-10-29 13:05:56	halfwit	Oh, do you use mpd?
2016-10-29 13:06:15	halfwit	Either way, worth trying.
2016-10-29 13:06:21	alyptik	Max`P› jack in mixxx give me too many pops
2016-10-29 13:06:25	alyptik	must be my crap computer
2016-10-29 13:07:08	haavard	Oh I get pops in my laptop when I plug in my headphones
2016-10-29 13:07:11	haavard	Why does this happen
2016-10-29 13:07:15	alyptik	voltage
2016-10-29 13:07:31	alyptik	initial and final have transients
2016-10-29 13:07:36	haavard	Let me clarify: it only happens in Linux, and it's like a continuous tick
2016-10-29 13:07:56	alyptik	yeah the linux firmware controlling the voltage isn't as good
2016-10-29 13:08:03	alyptik	on windows it was solved a long time ago
2016-10-29 13:08:07	alyptik	oh continuous?
2016-10-29 13:08:11	alyptik	that is not normal
2016-10-29 13:08:12	halfwit	What do you mean ERR_NAME_RESOLUTION_FAILED, it's fucking google.
2016-10-29 13:08:41	alyptik	is it a hum or llke tick tick tick
2016-10-29 13:08:45	haavard	It's pretty subtle, but clearly audible if nothing else is making sound
2016-10-29 13:08:52	haavard	It's a tick tick tick, maybe twice a second or so?
2016-10-29 13:09:01	alyptik	shit that is fucking weird
2016-10-29 13:09:03	alyptik	i have no idea
2016-10-29 13:09:54	halfwit	Should I use rdp though
2016-10-29 13:09:58	halfwit	Anyone?
2016-10-29 13:10:19	alyptik	rdp vs vnc?
2016-10-29 13:10:32	herring	wrote out a list of different options for repairing this tablet with prices.. she cant spend anywhere between 25 and 119 dollars fixing or replacing this tablet.. or she has the option of giving me the tablet in exchange for either babysitting her kid twice, or mowing her lawn twice, or one of each..

2016-10-30 11:30:55	Max`P	alyptik: sure, that's just "location / { proxy_pass http://whatever; }" in whatever server block you need it
2016-10-30 11:31:07	alyptik	hm
2016-10-30 11:31:12	alyptik	would HSTS be breaking this?

2016-10-30 11:42:45	Max`P	On another note, fuck ubuntu. I'm debugging my friend's Ubuntu after a failed dist-upgrade over netcat, it's all kinds of pain
2016-10-30 11:42:55	Max`P	apt is such an horrible package manager
2016-10-30 11:43:44	Max`P	Machine doesn't boot, and it keeps trying to start systemd services because Debian is the only distro retarded enough to start/stop services while updating shit even when you're in recovery mode because the thing is fubar
2016-10-30 11:44:04	prg	halfwit: yeah hackers ruined d3
2016-10-30 11:44:27	alyptik	Max`P› it says invalid CA

2016-10-30 11:53:34	Max`P	Well, probably Antergos, so it's got a nice UI. The thing is, I know that even with Arch being a rolling-release, I'm sure it won't explode this badly

2016-10-30 13:52:03	Max`P	alyptik: no
2016-10-30 13:52:12	alyptik	ah so that's why
2016-10-30 13:52:13	alyptik	damn
2016-10-30 13:52:15	Max`P	that wouldn't make sense really
2016-10-30 13:52:31	alyptik	well because i am proxying to icecast on 127.0.0.1:8000
2016-10-30 13:52:35	alyptik	afaik it doest do ssl
2016-10-30 13:52:42	Max`P	That doesn't matter
2016-10-30 13:52:49	Max`P	you can proxy to a non-ssl in an ssl server block
2016-10-30 13:53:02	alyptik	if i try to proxy to non http i get a not found nginx page error
2016-10-30 13:53:03	Max`P	nginx will terminate the SSL connection anyway
2016-10-30 13:53:14	alyptik	if i do it in my 80 server block it works fine though
2016-10-30 13:53:20	Max`P	show the configs
2016-10-30 13:53:25	alyptik	80 is only listeing on 192.168.1.99

2016-10-30 13:56:02	alyptik	but neither works anyway
2016-10-30 13:56:03	Max`P	yep
2016-10-30 13:56:18	Max`P	That's what I would have said, needs to use HTTP as your localhost thing is not https
2016-10-30 13:57:06	alyptik	 i get 404 - The file you requested could not be found
2016-10-30 13:57:16	Max`P	From nginx, or from the upstream server?
2016-10-30 13:57:16	alyptik	but it works fine 192.168.1.99/stream,
2016-10-30 13:57:26	alyptik	from my brower
2016-10-30 13:57:35	alyptik	this computer is 192.68.1.98
2016-10-30 13:57:45	alyptik	browser*
2016-10-30 13:58:35	alyptik	Max`P› i am doing this config over ssh; the server is on my LAN
2016-10-30 13:58:36	Max`P	Are you accessing the https version with the hostname?
2016-10-30 13:58:55	alyptik	alyp.tk/stream
2016-10-30 13:58:56	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-30 13:59:14	Max`P	So, is it an nginx 404, or an icecast 404?
2016-10-30 13:59:20	alyptik	oh sorry nginx
2016-10-30 14:00:00	alyptik	thought you were asking if it was an error in my journal log
2016-10-30 14:00:51	alyptik	i could have my server listen on 80 but i wouldn't want a document root
2016-10-30 14:00:55	alyptik	is that even doable?
2016-10-30 14:01:26	alyptik	so only alyp.tk/stream would resolve 
2016-10-30 14:01:28	Max`P	What do you have in the sites/enabled/*.conf ?
2016-10-30 14:01:38	alyptik	lemme check
2016-10-30 14:01:54	alyptik	oh dir
2016-10-30 14:01:58	alyptik	doesnt exist hah
2016-10-30 14:02:12	alyptik	i think it is from a .pacnew i diff'd in
2016-10-30 14:02:31	Max`P	what does "nginx -t" (as root) returns?
2016-10-30 14:02:50	alyptik	omfg
2016-10-30 14:02:55	alyptik	nginx: the configuration file /opt/openresty/nginx/conf/nginx.conf syntax is ok

2016-10-30 14:03:28	alyptik	lemme try changing my path see if it works
2016-10-30 14:03:32	Max`P	Yeah, that probably doesn't help either
2016-10-30 14:04:26	alyptik	nope :[
2016-10-30 14:04:50	alyptik	nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
2016-10-30 14:05:11	Max`P	hmm
2016-10-30 14:05:23	+Anna	army, and marines are idiots
2016-10-30 14:05:32	alyptik	could it be the headers?
2016-10-30 14:05:59	Max`P	No
2016-10-30 14:06:21	Max`P	try replacing the proxy_pass line with "return 500;" and reload
2016-10-30 14:06:21		[14:06]
2016-10-30 14:06:29	alyptik	alright
2016-10-30 14:06:46	alyptik	in quotes?
2016-10-30 14:06:48	Max`P	If you get a 500 instead of a 404, then the proxy_pass is broken. If you still get a 404, then you're just not reaching that location block at all
2016-10-30 14:06:53	Max`P	No without the quotes
2016-10-30 14:07:50	alyptik	500 Internal Server Error
2016-10-30 14:08:01	alyptik	so what does that mean it's broken?
2016-10-30 14:08:24	alyptik	not resolving?
2016-10-30 14:14:00		[14:08]
2016-10-30 14:14:46	Max`P	Hmm
2016-10-30 14:14:48	Max`P	that's odd
2016-10-30 14:15:02	Max`P	The proxy pass definitely should work
2016-10-30 14:15:30	Max`P	try "proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;" maybe?
2016-10-30 14:16:53	alyptik	oh it was already that, that https:// was just me trying something diff; forgot to change back before pastebin
2016-10-30 14:17:42	Max`P	And it gives an nginx 404?
2016-10-30 14:17:53	Max`P	Anything in nginx's error log?
2016-10-30 14:17:56	alyptik	LOL
2016-10-30 14:17:58	alyptik	fixed it

2016-10-30 14:18:35	alyptik	s/what/but/
2016-10-30 14:18:35	+Anna	alyptik meant to say: but it works
2016-10-30 14:19:05	Max`P	that's weird
2016-10-30 14:19:06	alyptik	your input helped a lot; thanks Max`P 
2016-10-30 14:19:11	alyptik	haha isn't it
2016-10-30 14:19:23	Max`P	I don't know how you guys manage to get into such weird situations xD
2016-10-30 14:19:34	alyptik	haha
2016-10-30 14:19:57	alyptik	sometimes i swear Anna's Markov Chains are bleeding into our RL
2016-10-30 14:20:53	alyptik	and by the way yes holy shit nginx is way faster than apache
2016-10-30 14:21:16	alyptik	i can also use terminal over ssh without +5s delay lol 
2016-10-30 14:22:00	Max`P	Personally I use nginx more because the config is a lot simpler than Apache httpd's weird ass wannabe XML but not really crap
2016-10-30 14:22:16	alyptik	i think that;s part of why it's faster
2016-10-30 14:22:16	Max`P	But yeah it's also faster at processing stuff, especially when it's used as a reverse proxy
2016-10-30 14:22:31	alyptik	doesn't have to process 100000000 lines of config every request
2016-10-30 14:22:33	Max`P	The whole thing is designed around efficiently switching connections into others
2016-10-30 14:22:46	Max`P	Neither server processes the config file every request, it's all loaded once and cached
2016-10-30 14:23:00	alyptik	i hate xml in genereal 
2016-10-30 14:23:02	alyptik	lmao
2016-10-30 14:23:13	alyptik	it is horrible to try to read for me
2016-10-30 14:23:20	alyptik	this is just C
2016-10-30 14:23:56	Max`P	XML is the only language that's equally unreadable by both humans and computers
2016-10-30 14:26:11	alyptik	shit that is true 
2016-10-30 14:26:17	alyptik	forgot computers hate it too
2016-10-30 14:26:50	alyptik	half time in #bash the bot is telling someone to stop trying to parse XML hah 
2016-10-30 14:29:28	alyptik	hard part is over; tomorrow i move all my weird *.alyp.tk virtual hosts to /* locations

2016-10-30 14:36:39	alyptik	oh mariadb config uses this too haha
2016-10-30 14:37:21	alyptik	i guess it is pretty widespread for webapp configs?

2016-10-30 14:38:29	halfwit	Oh
2016-10-30 14:38:38	Max`P	I literally just took the #chat database and copied it into this channel's
2016-10-30 14:38:44	alyptik	haha
2016-10-30 14:38:45	Max`P	I'm really surprised it triggers so fucking much
2016-10-30 14:38:47	halfwit	haha
2016-10-30 14:38:58	halfwit	Well, there were thousands messages
2016-10-30 14:39:09	Max`P	this should be like what, 10-20 entries compared to thousands upon thousands of legit ones?
2016-10-30 14:39:38	halfwit	I guess it's a database, not a text log hey?
2016-10-30 14:39:48	Max`P	yeah
2016-10-30 14:40:04	Max`P	It's a Berkeley DB, pain in the ass to mess with

2016-10-30 16:47:48	cirkit	Lua is cool
2016-10-30 16:47:53	cirkit	like it more than stupid ruby
2016-10-30 16:48:13	halfwit	Yeah, I understand so little of ruby, but
2016-10-30 16:48:50	halfwit	The tiny bit I know, I dislike greatly :p
2016-10-30 16:50:01	halfwit	I'm also gonna learn Go. Gonna have go, C, lua, and shell to see me through, instead of C, Python and shell.
2016-10-30 16:50:21	halfwit	ASM too I guess. That's a given.

2016-10-30 19:28:06	halfwit	#2 iirc
2016-10-30 19:28:13	halfwit	it's a sane checklist, heh
2016-10-30 19:28:33	Max`P	I ran the cable and everything, but it was in between the cable management hidden away. I was checking the wrong cable all along
2016-10-30 19:29:05	halfwit	Oh well. Coulda been worse, like you said could be dead
2016-10-30 19:29:09	halfwit	The CPU
2016-10-30 19:29:26	Max`P	What tipped me off is that I started measuring voltage at random spots and I was like "Well, there's no voltage there"
2016-10-30 19:29:40	halfwit	Nice
2016-10-30 19:30:19	Max`P	After a bit of WTF the cable went loose and I was like "wait, weren't you plugged into the PSU a minute ago?". "Oh, well, that explains a lot of shit"
2016-10-30 19:30:37	Max`P	In other news, "Core 3:       +25.0°C  (high = +80.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)"

2016-10-30 19:31:17	halfwit	Is that better than before even?
2016-10-30 19:33:34	halfwit	Max`P: Is the pump loud too?

2016-10-30 19:34:01	Max`P	It's the rad fans that are noisy now
2016-10-30 19:34:45	Max`P	I guess they need a bit of oiling too

2016-10-30 19:45:10	Max`P	I'm glad it's back alive tho, I wanted to wait for AMD's Zen CPUs and see if I switch or stay with Intel, and that's not quite there yet
2016-10-30 19:45:57	Max`P	And I think I'm going to PWM the damned fans with an arduino. There, fuck off fans
2016-10-30 19:49:12	halfwit	No doubt.
2016-10-30 19:49:22	halfwit	when I do mine up, I think i'm just going to air cool
2016-10-30 19:49:31	halfwit	Or get a closed loop CPU cooler
2016-10-30 19:51:26	Max`P	I kinda like the watercooling just for the flexibility of moving the heat elsewhere without needing a massive cooler right on the CPU

2016-10-30 20:42:43	alyptik	instead of without stream/
2016-10-30 20:42:52	halfwit	m. Why do none of my fucking sites have these books -_-;
2016-10-30 20:43:08	alyptik	and for some reason that caused infinite redirect loop
2016-10-30 20:43:22	halfwit	I don't pirate movies, or shows; just cheap technical manuals so I know if they're worth it to buy.
2016-10-30 20:43:28	halfwit	And it's the hardest shit to find
2016-10-30 20:43:59	halfwit	Guess it's brand new, probably a part of it.

2016-10-30 20:48:49	halfwit	I can find the third one, second one, first one; but damn if I can find the newes.
2016-10-30 20:49:06	halfwit	ISBN 8590379868
2016-10-30 20:51:15	alyptik	lemme check my sites

2016-10-30 20:54:40	alyptik	sheit
2016-10-30 20:54:45	alyptik	i can't find either lol
2016-10-30 20:55:06	halfwit	alyptik: I checked !bzz on duckduckgo (bookzz), then started getting into shady-feeling google links

2016-10-30 20:57:54	halfwit	Dunno if you've seen the plumber thing from plan9
2016-10-30 20:58:19	halfwit	But I send some text through a bunch of case matches, getting mimetypes if it's a file or a link, then run it in a program
2016-10-30 20:58:22	alyptik	nope D:
2016-10-30 20:58:29	alyptik	what the
2016-10-30 20:58:32	alyptik	that's crazy
2016-10-30 20:58:36	halfwit	easy to add rules so that when you click things, it just Does The Right Thing
2016-10-30 20:59:06	halfwit	Like urls in chat, if it's a link to youtube, it'll just open in mpv
2016-10-30 20:59:11	halfwit	image will open in imv
2016-10-30 20:59:16	halfwit	pdf zathura, etc

2016-10-30 20:59:40	alyptik	but i thought it was my friends personal thing
2016-10-30 20:59:51	alyptik	it's actually widespread?
2016-10-30 20:59:59	halfwit	Yeah.
2016-10-30 21:00:09	halfwit	Hell, Androids' intents isn't that different
2016-10-30 21:00:21	alyptik	mine only does it for yt, gifs, and images though
2016-10-30 21:00:32	halfwit	Mostly all you need
2016-10-30 21:00:39	halfwit	Text opening in editors is nice though

2016-10-30 21:01:20	alyptik	not sure how the would work
2016-10-30 21:01:28	alyptik	well i could use gvim
2016-10-30 21:02:13	halfwit	plumber would just open `yourterminal -e vim <url>`
2016-10-30 21:02:37	halfwit	Mine is `st -t NVIM -e nvim "$1"`, for example (I set the title as well for other shit)
2016-10-30 21:02:42	alyptik	my urxvt is a bit wierd though
2016-10-30 21:02:50	alyptik	i use -kuake-key

2016-10-30 21:03:05	alyptik	so i only have one term on all i3 desktops
2016-10-30 21:03:12	alyptik	gvim is prob easier
2016-10-30 21:03:17	alyptik	to use for this
2016-10-30 21:03:51	alyptik	so wait plumber is an android thing?
2016-10-30 21:04:18	halfwit	Naw, it's from Plan9

2016-10-30 21:04:51	alyptik	lol
2016-10-30 21:04:53	halfwit	Haha
2016-10-30 21:04:54	alyptik	silly anna
2016-10-30 21:05:05	alyptik	oops space
2016-10-30 21:05:17	alyptik	oh shit this is the new unix
2016-10-30 21:05:19	alyptik	right?

2016-10-30 21:05:21	+Anna	halfwit: Rob Pike - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike
2016-10-30 21:05:29	halfwit	Well it's from the 90s
2016-10-30 21:05:33	alyptik	the succesor*
2016-10-30 21:05:34	alyptik	i mean
2016-10-30 21:05:43	halfwit	Had too restrictive of licensing, so it never really made it
2016-10-30 21:05:48	halfwit	yeah.
2016-10-30 21:05:51	alyptik	i heard about it vaguely before
2016-10-30 21:06:43	halfwit	There's a fuckload going on around derivatives of it lately, actually
2016-10-30 21:07:42	halfwit	But yeah, I stole the idea for my scripts from there for this
2016-10-30 21:07:52	halfwit	Made it a bit better with URL mimetype handling as well
2016-10-30 21:08:58	alyptik	haha
2016-10-30 21:09:07	halfwit	https://github.com/halfwit/content-type slapped this together, it's a bit quicker than using curl itself and awk or sed shit
2016-10-30 21:09:08	+Anna	Title: GitHub - halfwit/content-type: Very simple curl based binary to print content-type field of url (at github.com)
2016-10-30 21:09:09	alyptik	i do that a lot as well
2016-10-30 21:09:29	alyptik	mine is bash though ha
2016-10-30 21:09:34	halfwit	Oh, why don't I have a makefile for this
2016-10-30 21:09:38	alyptik	this is way cooler
2016-10-30 21:09:46	halfwit	alyptik: This works nice. It's fast as fuck
2016-10-30 21:10:52	alyptik	oh wow didn't know content type was stored like that
2016-10-30 21:10:55	halfwit	alyptik: I go through a reply, looking for the '/' that sits in the content type
2016-10-30 21:11:36	alyptik	i havent used libcurl much
2016-10-30 21:11:46	halfwit	alyptik: Then, from that pointer I go either way til I find a control char, fastest way I could think to do this. 
2016-10-30 21:11:58	alyptik	maybe sockets a few time, so dont know a lot about c net coding
2016-10-30 21:12:17	alyptik	sounds right
2016-10-30 21:12:17		[21:12]
2016-10-30 21:12:18	halfwit	Error with command 'time content-type "https://ptpb.pw/LkfJ/text"'
2016-10-30 21:12:22	halfwit	Awwe.
2016-10-30 21:12:30	halfwit	Weechat sucks some times
2016-10-30 21:13:12	halfwit	0.636 total though, my curl -I "foo.com" | awk '/content-type/' shit was getting stupid, because there's no standard
2016-10-30 21:14:03	alyptik	hm
2016-10-30 21:14:11	alyptik	how do you handle https with this
2016-10-30 21:14:22	halfwit	It's just handled with curl
2016-10-30 21:14:40	alyptik	i should rephrase, which is the part that does it
2016-10-30 21:14:44	alyptik	or is it auto?
2016-10-30 21:14:48	halfwit	aut
2016-10-30 21:14:53	alyptik	wow 
2016-10-30 21:14:58	halfwit	curl's the shit, really
2016-10-30 21:15:54	halfwit	alyptik: At one time, I was running `content-type <url>` and curl -o $(mktemp) <url>` at the same time, then after that running the final program on <url>, it kinda works when it's a fifo
2016-10-30 21:16:27	halfwit	anyways, that was really fast, but kinda broken.
2016-10-30 21:16:28	alyptik	oo hacky
2016-10-30 21:16:34	alyptik	lol
2016-10-30 21:19:17	halfwit	Yeah. Hacky is good, right?

2016-10-30 21:20:01	alyptik	nc doesnt handle https hah
2016-10-30 21:20:53	alyptik	one day i'll read the whole curl manpage, it is so ridiculously  versatile 
2016-10-30 21:21:43	alyptik	yep, not even possible, you can to curl or use openssl to get HTTPS req in shell
2016-10-30 21:21:44	halfwit	Yeah. it does really well with multiple downloads, single, everything. Only thing I use other than it is aria2c
2016-10-30 21:21:47	alyptik	have to*

2016-10-30 21:22:37	alyptik	i haven't ran wget in like 2 years
2016-10-30 21:23:52	halfwit	I should try this out again
2016-10-30 21:23:55	halfwit	It's kinda fast
2016-10-30 21:24:47	halfwit	But not for videos
2016-10-30 21:25:00	halfwit	Oh, fuck never mind I'm stupid.

2016-11-01 12:04:12	Max`P	Thankfully they apparently have some freeleech and stuff, but that still bugs me a bit
2016-11-01 12:04:16	alyptik	yeah i guess i will use as long as i can; but if no one want to leech off me not much i can do 
2016-11-01 12:04:30	alyptik	i dont feel like ripping and making torrent
2016-11-01 12:04:34	alyptik	+s
2016-11-01 12:04:53	Max`P	I think they also have different calculation depending on whether you're trying to seed it or not at all
2016-11-01 12:05:22	Max`P	to encourage people to download and seed rarer stuff people don't really download or whatever
2016-11-01 12:06:03	alyptik	ah makes sense
2016-11-01 12:06:06	Max`P	I wish trackers had more of a rule like "Keep your stuff in seed for a month" or something and if it's still not seeded, waive it as unseedable instead of murdering your ratio

2016-11-01 14:23:18	halfwit	Sorry, I was afk a while, heh
2016-11-01 14:24:10	Max`P	It's funny how Docker is supposed to make things easier and all isolated. But I find most of the time everything is massively overengineered and it ends up sucking a lot more than it otherwise would
2016-11-01 14:24:34	halfwit	Yeah. 
2016-11-01 14:25:20	halfwit	Docker doesn't interest me at all, honestly.
2016-11-01 14:25:32	halfwit	But I get the reasoning I guess
2016-11-01 14:26:34	halfwit	I really just don't like people trying to build one thing and have it work everywhere. 
2016-11-01 14:30:34	Max`P	The problem is not running everywhere but more like you depend so much on a shitton of things people feel the need to package your app as a whole OS
2016-11-01 14:30:34		[14:30]
2016-11-01 14:31:00	halfwit	haha
2016-11-01 14:31:02	halfwit	yeah.
2016-11-01 14:32:41	Max`P	Things like gitlab that just assumes they're going to be installed to /home/gitlab annoys the crap out of me. This is bad design all around, is practically unpackagable, and that thing doesn't offer ANY help into installing the thing properly as a system service. Even the arch package still requires compiling files right into /usr/share. Like, what
2016-11-01 14:32:41	Max`P	 the actual fuck
2016-11-01 14:33:25	halfwit	What the fuck
2016-11-01 14:34:14	halfwit	People just learn their terrible abstraction overtop of abstractions overtop of linux, since they're told they have to, instead of learning anything about the hardware, or kernel, or even how userland works
2016-11-01 14:34:24	halfwit	Too hard, want instant solutions
2016-11-01 14:34:50	halfwit	End up with absolute shit that requires insanely convoluted test suites to catch just the basic issues :/
2016-11-01 14:34:55	halfwit	Dislike that.
2016-11-01 14:38:31	halfwit	It's like anything else though, wish people didn't make shit software, but then, how do you get better?
2016-11-01 14:44:00		[14:38]
2016-11-01 15:06:52	Max`P	It will get better when people start focusing back on quality instead of quantity. Most software dev shops I know of wants to deliver stuff as fast as possible. And of course to do so, they duct-tape a buttload of libraries together.
2016-11-01 15:06:52		[15:06]
2016-11-01 15:07:51	Max`P	Same applies for that whole IoT fiasco. Invest time making and maintaining the software? Nah, just ship the thing ASAP so people can buy it and be done with it

2016-11-01 15:09:47	Max`P	like at PIA. Failing to parse ipconfig.exe's output in non-english languages? Oh yeah, lets just ship the API demo example from MSDN with the app and call that instead
2016-11-01 15:10:27	Max`P	The devs attitude is starting to annoy the crap out of me at this company, or well, practically any company nowadays.
2016-11-01 15:10:49	Max`P	Because writing shit in C using the real APIs and system calls is clearly too hard.
2016-11-01 15:11:19	Max`P	It is my opinion that a programmer that can't do C with ease is a shit programmer and doesn't deserved to be called a programmer. They deserve to be called code shitters, because that's what to do.
2016-11-01 15:15:23	halfwit	Oh, my fucking god lol

2016-11-01 15:18:16	alyptik	complex systems like which?
2016-11-01 15:18:25	alyptik	stuff like firmware you mean?
2016-11-01 15:18:38	halfwit	Well, systemd was something I bailed on

2016-11-01 15:25:00	halfwit	Yep.
2016-11-01 15:25:03	alyptik	it could have been great
2016-11-01 15:25:19	halfwit	I honestly like the intents, 
2016-11-01 15:25:21	alyptik	but sadly settles for tolerable 
2016-11-01 15:25:46	Max`P	They made the worst mistake they possibly could have making it so the thing only runs Java, and not have a generic launching mechanism with Java being available out of the box
2016-11-01 15:25:55	halfwit	But each application is just this monolithic thing that couldn't dream of interacting with other apps fully :/
2016-11-01 15:26:03	 *	alyptik says using IRC on his Android phone
2016-11-01 15:26:03	halfwit	Ohh, that'd be nice.
2016-11-01 15:26:08	halfwit	lol
2016-11-01 15:26:13	halfwit	alyptik: Hey, we're allowed to want things better.
2016-11-01 15:26:19	alyptik	indeed
2016-11-01 15:26:31	Max`P	I still take Android any day compared to an iPhone
2016-11-01 15:26:56	halfwit	Max`P: There's a few other options out there, but goddamn it Android has those few nice parts that bring it home 
2016-11-01 15:27:55	alyptik	Xposed
2016-11-01 15:28:00	alyptik	can't use other phone ever again
2016-11-01 15:28:06	Max`P	I have a feeling Android was originally be meant to be a giant monolythic Java app running all in a single VM, and then they retrofitted third party apps in because obviously you can't load untrusted code in the core
2016-11-01 15:28:27	 *	voidead is listening to Katharsis [Fourth Reich] - Emeralde Graves
2016-11-01 15:28:32	alyptik	exposed and lucky patcher have to be the most innovative things i've seen on android
2016-11-01 15:28:43	alyptik	s/ex/x
2016-11-01 15:28:43	+Anna	alyptik meant to say: xposed and lucky patcher have to be the most innovative things i've seen on android
2016-11-01 15:28:57	halfwit	lucky patcher?
2016-11-01 15:29:04	halfwit	Hold the fuck on kk.
2016-11-01 15:29:09	halfwit	Oh, neat
2016-11-01 15:29:14	Max`P	That's the only reason I can picture them not allowing to launch native apps directly, without Java. Anyone in their right mind making an OS would make it all native even if the preferred runtime is Java
2016-11-01 15:29:32	alyptik	it is so fucking awesome halfwit 
2016-11-01 15:29:48	Max`P	Worst case have everyone ship a run.sh that launches Java or whatever, that'd be fine
2016-11-01 15:29:51	alyptik	it patches play store to do things like disable ad API
2016-11-01 15:29:58	halfwit	Max`P: they have this weird mentality that they know best

2016-11-01 15:30:18	alyptik	if i met chelpus in RL would shake his hand 
2016-11-01 15:30:28	halfwit	Max`P: Seems like fucking everyone "knows best", and anything outside of their precious creation isn't worthwhile :(
2016-11-01 15:30:32	halfwit	haha
2016-11-01 15:31:08	alyptik	i still don't understand how it proxys in app purchases
2016-11-01 15:31:24	Max`P	Google Play Services
2016-11-01 15:31:31	alyptik	couldnt google patch it though?
2016-11-01 15:31:39	alyptik	or is it  impossible
2016-11-01 15:31:48	alyptik	server side i mean
2016-11-01 15:31:57	Max`P	Well, if you patch the play store itself, best apps can do is try to detected the patched play store
2016-11-01 15:31:59	halfwit	I wouldn't mind a POSIX material library for C, for the record, I do like what they're doing (not all of the widgets though)
2016-11-01 15:32:10	alyptik	you can't stop it server side?
2016-11-01 15:32:32	Max`P	I'm fairly sure it's patched precisely so it doesn't ping the server and just reply "yes" to everything
2016-11-01 15:32:39	halfwit	Neat
2016-11-01 15:32:45	alyptik	oh wow
2016-11-01 15:37:29	halfwit	There doesn't appear to be any. 
2016-11-01 15:37:54	Max`P	Doing UI stuff in C isn't exactly the sanest thing
2016-11-01 15:38:13	alyptik	yeah
2016-11-01 15:38:13		[15:38]
2016-11-01 15:38:14	Max`P	But you can probably just use GTK and a Material theme
2016-11-01 15:38:30	halfwit	gtk >< 
2016-11-01 15:38:31	alyptik	quality is super lib dependant
2016-11-01 15:38:32	halfwit	Oh man.
2016-11-01 15:38:35	halfwit	Yeah.
2016-11-01 15:38:44	halfwit	Nuklear looks really interesting
2016-11-01 15:38:55	Max`P	GTK is painful
2016-11-01 15:39:06	Max`P	and the examples are fucking DELIBERATELY WRONG
2016-11-01 15:39:22	halfwit	I really don't like GTK.
2016-11-01 15:39:28	Max`P	"It's to make sure people actually read the documentation and don't just copy and paste the code"
2016-11-01 15:39:30	halfwit	But that was because I got into their codebase
2016-11-01 15:39:33	+Anna	rasta bubbler and top shelf cunt lol

2016-11-01 15:39:53	Max`P	I have quite of a love/hate relationship with GTK
2016-11-01 15:40:12	Max`P	On one hand, the apps made with it are usually quite nice and simple, and fairly lightweight
2016-11-01 15:40:22	Max`P	On the other, holy fuck is that thing a fucking horrible mess
2016-11-01 15:40:32	Max`P	Wish there as a viable Qt desktop
2016-11-01 15:40:43	halfwit	Mhm.
2016-11-01 15:41:26	halfwit	Qt smart phone userland
2016-11-01 15:41:28	halfwit	Lol
2016-11-01 15:41:43	Max`P	Only thing you can find in Qt is like, KDE (holy mother of bloat), or some random apps that looks like Windows
2016-11-01 15:41:54	alyptik	yeah 
2016-11-01 15:42:18	alyptik	i always just use wm and asm many -qt as i can 
2016-11-01 15:42:42	halfwit	What does sailfish run? JVM?
2016-11-01 15:43:32	Max`P	Qt
2016-11-01 15:43:42	halfwit	I would use something more niche on my phone in a heartbeat, if the applications I require were available :/
2016-11-01 15:44:06	halfwit	Heh, maybe Firefox or Ubuntu will take off at some point
2016-11-01 15:44:10	Max`P	Well, Sailfish uses Wayland, so anything that can render to wayland works. Like, how Android *should* have been made for
2016-11-01 15:44:32	halfwit	Even wayland makes sense there
2016-11-01 15:44:54	Max`P	Firefox is all ewwww, web bullshit, will probably be worse than Android if it ever gets anywhere
2016-11-01 15:45:03	Max`P	Ubuntu Touch is eww coded like ass and full of bugs
2016-11-01 15:45:05	halfwit	Oh, so like fucking...
2016-11-01 15:45:11	halfwit	Their operating system they're making
2016-11-01 15:45:26	halfwit	"instead of everything is a file, we go one step further - everything is a url!"
2016-11-01 15:45:49	alyptik	omg
2016-11-01 15:45:57	alyptik	that is ridiculous
2016-11-01 15:46:10	halfwit	They miss the point.
2016-11-01 15:46:14	halfwit	Of everything is a file
2016-11-01 15:46:17	halfwit	Lol
2016-11-01 15:46:20	halfwit	Back in like 20 ~
2016-11-01 15:46:37	Max`P	Sailfish actually looks fairly decent. Wish it was more popular and had more ports so I can actually try it
2016-11-01 15:46:54	Max`P	Runs systemd, Wayland, and overall is pretty much a mobile Linux distro
2016-11-01 15:47:35	voidead	I thought sailfish went under though
2016-11-01 15:48:03	Max`P	It's not dead but I think it's not really taking off either
2016-11-01 15:48:31	Max`P	Why? Because of course the average user doesn't care about what it's built-on, they just want shit to be fancy and bling bling
2016-11-01 15:48:54	voidead	dumb asses as usual yeah
2016-11-01 15:49:04	Max`P	Just look at every samsung phone, people are going crazy over them yet any sane person would look at it and be like "holy mother of bloatware"

2016-11-01 18:03:12	voidead	I haven't put anything on a thumb drive but I do have install media on a thumb drive which I update regularly and I have everything in / preserved on my external drive as a backup which I rsync if there are changes made

2016-11-01 18:03:35	voidead	thats the way to go 
2016-11-01 18:04:03	voidead	I can just use the install media to fix shit
2016-11-01 18:04:05	voidead	if needed
2016-11-01 18:04:09	voidead	as it has everything you need

2016-11-02 09:01:47	herring	heh
2016-11-02 09:04:09	herring	well, a long time ago i downloaded a spongebob pack, it came with the complete seasons 1-10.. plus extras, 30-40 episodes per season.. then i started noticing the new episodes being released would sometimes be named s09e9b or 9a or 9a1 and the same episode, different uploader would name it s10e45 or some shit.. spongepedia and wikisponge and wikipedia all have different naming schemes too
2016-11-02 09:04:26	herring	and i just cant understand why anyone would be calling any of the new episodes season 9
2016-11-02 09:04:36	herring	now season 10 as apparently started with 1b
2016-11-02 09:04:42	herring	but its not really season 10
2016-11-02 09:04:43	herring	its 11
2016-11-02 09:04:52	herring	but nobody is calling it 11
2016-11-02 09:05:32	herring	my season 10 dir has episodes named s10 and episodes named s09
2016-11-02 09:06:25	halfwit	Holy fuck man

2016-11-02 09:06:51	herring	so now im going to have s10e01, s09, and s10e01b
2016-11-02 09:06:54	herring	in the same dir
2016-11-02 09:07:18	halfwit	That storyline you're going to mess up, right?!

2016-11-02 09:08:10	herring	the problem, besides the total disorganization and lack of aesthetics of my files, is when my kids say some shit like " i want to watch the episode where spongebob does x y z"
2016-11-02 09:08:19	herring	and i go to look up which episode that is
2016-11-02 09:08:35	herring	and spongepedia says its s09e32b or some shit
2016-11-02 09:08:57	herring	and i go to look for s09e32b and its either not there or the wrong episode
2016-11-02 09:09:02	herring	or some such bullshit
2016-11-02 09:09:10	herring	it becomes a serious issue

2016-11-02 09:13:58	herring	nobody knows

2016-11-02 09:16:08	herring	maybe i should just rename all the seasons to a s10a, s10b, s10c scheme
2016-11-02 09:16:13	herring	just call everything season 10
2016-11-02 09:16:26	herring	although that still wouldnt help me find what im looking for
2016-11-02 09:20:33	herring	i guess what i need to do is just go off wikipedia
2016-11-02 09:20:42	herring	and go through each and every season and epidoe

2016-11-02 09:21:21	herring	20b is the last episode of season1, season2 starts at 21a /1a
2016-11-02 09:21:45	-->	SeferYetzirah (~quassel@cloak-9jm.jbv.46vapk.IP) has joined #thevoid
2016-11-02 09:23:54	herring	still doesnt explain why season 10 started at e1b and not 1a unless nobody has uploaded 1a yet
2016-11-02 09:23:54		[09:23]
2016-11-02 09:24:39	herring	oh
2016-11-02 09:24:41	herring	i see
2016-11-02 09:25:31	herring	these uploaders named s10e1a s09e25b
2016-11-02 09:25:50	herring	s09e25b is actually s10e1a
2016-11-02 09:25:58	herring	accroding to wikipedia
2016-11-02 09:29:01	halfwit	I'm contemplating learning Vim like a moron, saying the movements out loud - there's a bunch I still don't know
2016-11-02 09:29:12	halfwit	Like the shift+<key>
2016-11-02 09:29:38	halfwit	< and > even, holy shit. Lol.
2016-11-02 09:31:31	herring	i actually have two packs of seasons 1-10/1-9 downloaded, and both are named incorrectly (if you go by wikipedia
2016-11-02 09:31:32	herring	)
2016-11-02 09:32:29	herring	season 9 in this hvec pack is actually season8 and its cut short by 11 episodes
2016-11-02 09:33:04	herring	wow
2016-11-02 09:38:10	herring	also
2016-11-02 09:38:18	halfwit	Hm, didn't have xiclp.
2016-11-02 09:38:20	halfwit	xclip *
2016-11-02 09:38:45	herring	this is a major issue because kodi requires proper naming schemes inorder to scrape the information for the library
2016-11-02 09:38:52	herring	thumbnails, episode info etc
2016-11-02 09:39:03	halfwit	Too bad there wasn't a VideoBrainz
2016-11-02 09:39:03		[09:39]
2016-11-02 09:39:06	herring	so i cant have spongebob in my kodi library all nice and neat
2016-11-02 09:40:13	herring	at this point i need to rename and organize about 410 files
2016-11-02 09:40:19	herring	by hand
2016-11-02 09:40:57	halfwit	Grab it season by season, verifying that way? 
2016-11-02 09:43:09	herring	spongebob packs are limited.. im not sure i can get all seasons in individual packs, plus they would probably be all fucked up anyway and as far as i know there are only two packs available which include all the seasons and those are both named all fucked up.. and i bet once i get around to fixing this huge mess, ill be missing some episodes.. i can already think of one episode i dont have
2016-11-02 09:43:18	herring	i have a spanish copy
2016-11-02 09:43:31	herring	not even sure there is an english copy of "pest of the west"
2016-11-02 09:43:41	herring	if there is, its not on the internet
2016-11-02 09:43:46	halfwit	Probably have it on crave tv here
2016-11-02 09:43:55	halfwit	Don't have a capture card or anything though

2016-11-02 09:46:00	herring	under season 6 of course.. its supposed to be part of season5
2016-11-02 09:47:04	herring	ok, im done ranting about spongebob
2016-11-02 09:47:11	herring	i need to start renaming this shit
2016-11-02 09:47:47	herring	thinking of inviting my self to ipt so i can stir up a bunch of shit in the comment section and on the forums about this
2016-11-02 09:47:58	herring	end up losing an account over it
2016-11-02 09:48:07	herring	YOU MOTHER FUCKERS
2016-11-02 09:49:06	herring	once im done though ill be the only person on the whole internet, in the whole world with correctly name spongebob episodes
2016-11-02 09:49:11	herring	ill be fucking famous
2016-11-02 09:49:37	herring	like jesus christ
2016-11-02 09:50:46	halfwit	Probably more famous.

2016-11-02 10:11:55	herring	well.. ranger makes it a bit easier with bulk renaming
2016-11-02 10:12:04	herring	still need to edit the shit in vim a bit..
2016-11-02 10:12:57	herring	of course the first try at bulk renaming, i edited all the files in vim, closed vim and it couldnt do it because it had no permission
2016-11-02 10:13:01	herring	so now i have to do it again
2016-11-02 10:13:01		[10:13]

2016-11-02 13:50:56	herring	NONE of the episodes in the season 8 dir in both of these packs were season 8 episodes
2016-11-02 13:51:01	herring	not a single fucking one
2016-11-02 13:51:26	herring	was a mix of season 5 episodes, dvd specials, and season 7
2016-11-02 13:51:41	herring	some real fucking crackheads put these torrents together
2016-11-02 13:52:12	herring	which explains my confusion about whether or not there is a season 11
2016-11-02 13:52:32	herring	fuck all these guys who done did this shit
2016-11-02 13:57:27	Max`P	Or you could just grab a non-shitty torrent: https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/7567570/SpongeBob.SquarePants_Seasons_1-7___Movies

2016-11-02 14:35:09	halfwit	cirkit: Awesome
2016-11-02 14:35:15	halfwit	cirkit: Done it before?
2016-11-02 14:35:37	herring	thats the thing.. EVERY torrent for ANY spongebob episode on the ENTIRE internet is numberd incorrectly.. and EVERY pack has episodes out of place or outright missing on top of being named and or numbered incorrect
2016-11-02 14:35:45	herring	its a massive conspiracy
2016-11-02 14:37:27	Max`P	It might be one of those cases where it's distributed in a really shit way and there's no real proper order
2016-11-02 14:39:09	Max`P	I've seen it a lot of time with stuff like the Looney Tunes where it's been packages in so many different ways and different variants
2016-11-02 14:39:19	Max`P	Saw it with the Simpsons as well

2016-11-02 15:15:50	herring	https://ptpb.pw/j82M few more episodes to add to season 9 and i need to gather up all the specials i have (some of which are in the season 10 dir) and make a dir for them all
2016-11-02 15:16:45	cirkit	halfwit: yeah, it's pretty easy with the right mounts...the ones that just slide in and click into place
2016-11-02 15:17:04	cirkit	just gotta be really careful not to bump any existing cables knocking a server/switch/etc offline 
2016-11-02 15:17:53	halfwit	Yeah.
2016-11-02 15:18:07	halfwit	cirkit: I like the idea of rackmounting things, I'v been creeping rackmount guitar gear for fucking years now
2016-11-02 15:22:21	Max`P	Yeah rack mounting looks cool. I wouldn't mind a desk with rack mount spots instead of drawers, would be neat
2016-11-02 15:23:40	halfwit	Max`P: I was gonna modify mine to facilitate that. i had a rack that was about 1 inch taller than what would fit, hah.
2016-11-02 15:24:16	Max`P	I don't have any rack-mountable gear so that's mostly why I'm not using that stuff, but I probably should eventually because right now my desk is a mess

2016-11-03 08:14:26	voidead	the irc relay is what I'm using
2016-11-03 08:14:32	voidead	the weechat relay is used for glowing bear
2016-11-03 08:14:56	voidead	but yeah a weechat relay can't talk to another weechat session
2016-11-03 08:15:03	voidead	it has to be a third party client
2016-11-03 08:16:14	halfwit	Ohhh
2016-11-03 08:16:16	halfwit	Oh ok
2016-11-03 08:16:23	halfwit	yeah, I was thinking only of the weechat relay.
2016-11-03 08:19:06	voidead	yeah I didn't realize this until researching it a bit
2016-11-03 08:19:15	voidead	finally found out I don't need to use znc
2016-11-03 08:19:20	voidead	and I was like.. FUCK ZNC
2016-11-03 08:19:24	voidead	what a piece of shit
2016-11-03 08:19:41	halfwit	Plan9 does it pretty smart.

2016-11-03 09:53:26	voidead	this is a CLI based script
2016-11-03 09:53:34	voidead	so there is no album art

2016-11-03 09:58:03	Max`P	^
2016-11-03 09:58:08	voidead	well that is how this works
2016-11-03 09:58:12	voidead	so fucking what?
2016-11-03 10:00:00	haavard	Python 3 handles unicode and shit in a more sane way, maybe you wouldn't get the error ;)
2016-11-03 10:00:20	voidead	not necessarily
2016-11-03 10:01:08	voidead	saying it sucks simply because its not _whatever haavard wants_ is dumb
2016-11-03 10:01:42	haavard	What do you mean "not necessarily", I did say "maybe"
2016-11-03 10:01:52	haavard	Read my message before you rush to disagree
2016-11-03 10:02:23	Max`P	It's not a question of what haavard wants, it's a question of being an arch user and using stuff that's been obsolete for years already :D
2016-11-03 10:02:55	voidead	even that is a ridiculous argument
2016-11-03 10:03:22	Max`P	Stupid "stable" distros holding progress back. Everyone still write Python 2.x because it works on Debian out of the box. What a load of horseshit
2016-11-03 10:04:00	Max`P	Debian users made a choice of using molded software, they shouldn't be allowed to have new stuff until it lands in stable just like everything else
2016-11-03 10:04:16	haavard	I feel like Python 3 is progressing at a good pace
2016-11-03 10:04:33	haavard	People used to complain that Python 3 was useless because all the libraries were for Python 2, but that's no longer the case
2016-11-03 10:04:56	Max`P	node ftw <3
2016-11-03 10:05:02	haavard	It's been long since I had to deal with something not working on Python 3
2016-11-03 10:06:09	voidead	but the issue with this script has nothing to do with python2/3 because I even wrote one in python3.. this is a bug in this particular API
2016-11-03 10:06:51	voidead	and this error doesn't even break it
2016-11-03 10:06:51		[10:06]
2016-11-03 10:07:06	voidead	I'm merely stating.. there is an error when there used to not be one
2016-11-03 10:07:08	halfwit	Because that function that throws the error is never called
2016-11-03 10:07:20	halfwit	What API is that bastard?
2016-11-03 10:08:23	voidead	https://github.com/bear/python-twitter its a good API but they are making some changes
2016-11-03 10:08:24	+Anna	Title: GitHub - bear/python-twitter: A Python wrapper around the Twitter API. (at github.com)
2016-11-03 10:09:05	haavard	voidead: wait is this for a script you wrote?
2016-11-03 10:09:23	voidead	the API is related to the script yeah
2016-11-03 10:09:35	haavard	Like the issue is just that a metadata file for a package isn't proper UTF-8
2016-11-03 10:11:36	voidead	I'll file a bug report to see what is amiss but even with the error its not causing issues
2016-11-03 10:13:33	halfwit	My son can't say lollipop
2016-11-03 10:13:39	halfwit	So he says, "yoyyipop"

2016-11-04 11:14:53	Max`P	halfwit: yeah, that's how YouTube actually delivers the stuff. Basically they have a pool of video and audio files for each videos and dynamically switch to the appropriate ones depending on the conditions
2016-11-04 11:15:36	Max`P	So on mobile it will pick lower quality both to reduce bandwidth usage, while on desktop it may keep the audio top notch at all resolutions but adapt the video size to the window size
2016-11-04 11:16:00	Max`P	YouTube's video player is really well made in my opinion despite the constant amount of people shitting on it like it's the worst thing ever
