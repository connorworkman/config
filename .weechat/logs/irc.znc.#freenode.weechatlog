2016-09-16 12:45:52	thumbs	ullf09721: if you want to register a primary (single #) channel, make sure you represent an on-topic group or project by that name, first.
2016-09-16 12:46:11	athenes19	You should add a feature to freenode which, when somebody joins a channel, displays a notice message for you, telling you about the activity and response rate for questions.
2016-09-16 12:46:31	athenes19	As it is now, hundreds of man hours per day are probably wasted because people join dead channels and ask their questions but never get them answered.
2016-09-16 12:46:42	athenes19	It's both annoying for me and heartbreaking to see when it happens to others.
2016-09-16 12:46:59	preaction	the solution is to just ask to ask before you ask

2016-09-16 15:24:25	thumbs	ccat: no. You're wrong again.
2016-09-16 15:24:43	preaction	ccat: then how will a channel that is "inactive" ever become active again? if nobody asks a question, nobody will answer one, meaning it will never become active, ever

2016-09-17 01:58:45	Ady	Considering that I am a registered user, and when I start an irc session I eventually get to be recognized with my registered nick, I don't understand why the "fail login" msgs. What is that I am not doing correctly? Is it that I am not really a registered user (as I thought I am)? Or what?
2016-09-17 01:59:02	grawity	it is that someone else keeps trying to log in to your account

2016-09-17 01:59:27	grawity	but due to the way SASL works, nickserv doesn't know who exactly, so it shows "<sasl>" instead of their nick@host

2016-09-18 00:51:29	Fuchs	the problem with our anti spam measure (sigyn) is: she does set k-lines (network wide bans), so any false positives are a bit annoying

2016-09-18 05:53:51	grawity	for a personal 1-user mailserver + 1-user znc, it probably won't even reach 15% CPU most of the time

2016-09-18 05:55:12	derpherp128	what scales more: cpu usage or ram usage with # of clients connected to openvpn?
2016-09-18 05:55:14	thumbs	a web server doesn't need more than 15-30MB of RAM
2016-09-18 05:55:20	mquin	I used to run a znc on whatever the smallest thing was, got a bit choppy if you tried do do a lot at once (like reconnecting to many networks) but was fine otherwise
2016-09-18 05:55:32	B_H	yeap for mysql and web stuff its better have more than 1 gb
2016-09-18 05:55:35	derpherp128	grawity: $0.0067 for nano, $0.013 for micro / hour
2016-09-18 05:55:36	grawity	probably CPU usage if the VM doesn't offer AES hardware accel

2016-09-18 13:24:37	FireFly	[22:58:38] I'm aware :P [22:58:38]

2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:02:59] I just figured you "Aim to misbehave" [23:02:59]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:03:27] Hopefully some in here will get the referene.:-) [23:03:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	MetaNova	[23:03:45] Balistyl: can I bring any grenades? [23:03:45]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:04:03] No, we're not expecting trouble! [23:04:03]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	MetaNova	[23:04:08] aww! [23:04:08]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	MetaNova	[23:04:27] gonna bring all these guns, though, I like to keep my options open [23:04:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:04:35] I just hope we don't encounter any reavers...cause grenades would be good for those! [23:04:35]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:06:08] I really hoped they were going to make a movie about the Shepard...that would be a great prequel [23:06:08]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:06:43] A Shepards Tale! [23:06:43]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	MetaNova	[23:06:49] I'd watch the hell out of that [23:06:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	MetaNova	[23:06:52] double so if it had that title [23:06:52]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	bazhang	[23:07:03] and he could eat shepherd pie [23:07:03]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	bazhang	[23:07:25] count on netflix to bring back the series at some point [23:07:25]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:07:49] I have a theory he knew about the reavers and Miranda. [23:07:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:08:27] Which is why he couldn't go with them to Miranda in the movie, cause he knew what was there and would have stopped them, so they had to write him off the ship [23:08:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:08:32] to make the story work [23:08:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:09:03] I hope so...or Amazon [23:09:03]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:11:03] My other TV theory is that the Blue Meth from Breaking bad caused the Zombie outbreak on Walking dead...but that's just a theory [23:11:03]

2016-09-19 05:32:04	GitGud	tinyhippo, would you join sd ?
2016-09-19 05:32:10	steven	as long as the ldl and hdl level is equal you have eat as much as you want to tinyhippo .. doesnt matter

2016-09-19 05:37:09	tinyhippo	there are lots of contradictory advice
2016-09-19 05:37:21	tinyhippo	I am tempted to ask a PT/nutrionist to help
2016-09-19 05:37:26	starsailor	tinyhippo: followed those instructions to the tee; it's for GNU/Linux but the same principle applies. the part where it says "11:09 !larich.oftc.net *** Your client certificate fingerprint is: C77106576ABF7F9F90CCA0F63874A60F2E40A64B" isn't what's shown to me here
2016-09-19 05:37:52	grawity	which is to be expected, since those are OFTC instructions and they show you what OFTC servers show
2016-09-19 05:37:56	steven	thats why I prefer the science route .D also yeah you should always consult professionals. I just happened to know some basics since I lift since quite some time and eventually started to learn those things

2016-09-20 00:42:28	starsailor	(Confusingly.)
2016-09-20 00:42:38	GenteelBen	All this proves is we need a new RFC for IRC.
2016-09-20 00:42:55	starsailor	Heh. Yeah, the original RFC had only @ and + (+o and +v) I think.
2016-09-20 00:42:58	starsailor	But it doesn't matter.
2016-09-20 00:43:01	GenteelBen	It's about time IRC supported VP9 / HEVC webcam recording.
2016-09-20 00:43:10	pwrslave	ircnet only has @ and + too

2016-09-20 01:35:24	FireFly	Do you have a CertFP certificate setup?

2016-09-20 01:36:01	FireFly	IlIlIlIlIlIlI: so SASL EXTERNAL is about using another (external) means to authenticate. in the case of IRC, that is a CertFP certificate

2016-09-20 01:36:33	FireFly	oftc has some nice info about how it works/how to configure different clients: https://www.oftc.net/NickServ/CertFP/  it's a bit of setup though, since it uses a certificate instead of plaintext username/password
2016-09-20 01:36:47	IlIlIlIlIlIlI	I don't think I have one yet, will look into it

2016-09-20 01:37:01	starsailor	IlIlIlIlIlIlI: Before you start, make sure Pidgin also supports the EXTERNAL mechanism. As I can see, it only supports PLAIN.

2016-09-20 01:37:53	IlIlIlIlIlIlI	is it possible that your server responds with "incorrect password" error instead of "hey, you provided no CertFP key, please try the next mean of auth"?
2016-09-20 01:37:57	IlIlIlIlIlIlI	or something
2016-09-20 01:38:20	starsailor	I was also confused by that part in the logs. If it's trying EXTERNAL, it needs to match against a hash/fingerprint, not a "password".

(so you do it just once) the next times you connect to freenode, you will need to use the IDENTIFY command to authenticate.

2016-09-20 10:26:52	@christel	ASM is used by a group of collaborating channel ops -- we're not especially fond of its current usage (nor its predecessor)

2016-09-20 10:28:55	starsailor	And of course, it is these same ops that then feel the need for such bots.

2016-09-20 11:54:24	starsailor	galneg: You can view it as such; the actual purpose is to denote that you are not affiliated with any project hosted on freenode. Hence, unaffiliated.

2016-09-20 11:56:36	Lorax	it's a minor risk reduction where the risk is generally an annoyance
2016-09-20 11:57:14	galneg	starsailor: y but wouldnt tor heavily affect the perfomance? I know it does for me atleast when im using it for darknet browsing
2016-09-20 11:57:32	starsailor	galneg: That is correct, there is actually some mild lag, but it's not anything serious.

2016-09-20 11:57:55	starsailor	Where latency and lag are game killers.
2016-09-20 11:58:05	incog	wasnt the onion service down for months recently?
2016-09-20 11:58:20	Lorax	tor is another risk reducer which can result in less privacy
2016-09-20 11:58:21	galneg	starsailor: Y Ofc :) Btw am I using this nametag correct?
2016-09-20 11:58:23	starsailor	That is correct, however two days ago, after some testing on the testnet, it was put back into service here.

2016-09-20 17:27:07	pj	I think of getting a cloak as similar to locking the door to your house.  It can certainly still be picked but it's better than leaving the door wide open.
2016-09-20 17:27:16	nchambers	it shows your (lack of) affiliation to a project
2016-09-20 17:27:20	lagbox	shows affiliation or lack of affiliation with a group on the network

2016-09-20 19:28:21	nealshire_	hes done it at least 3 times

2016-09-20 19:28:40	realz	Fuchs, christel, opm, tomaw, poutine should be banned and klined for posting exploits in the freenode channel
2016-09-20 19:28:41	Gryllida	dax: and I think that's the primary reason. more important than the use case of someone not seeing whether someone else uses +g

2016-09-20 19:48:44	Gryllida	Alynna: notices are messages for bots. they were invented to avoid bot loops. bots never reply to notices, so if one bot sends a notice to another, they don't enter a loop.
2016-09-20 19:48:53	Alynna	exactly
2016-09-20 19:49:01	opm	although realz I did not quite get what your complaint was about

2016-09-20 19:51:11	dax	if he had deliberately pasted it in here to be an ass, he would have been banned. i am unconvinced he did that, so he's not
2016-09-20 19:51:14	opm	but why should I be banned for something poutine did?
2016-09-20 19:51:24	dax	intent is a thing that matters and all

2016-09-20 19:52:44	Alynna	as far as I am concerned anything that a user does on IRC that triggers an unintended action outside of IRC, is an exploit.
2016-09-20 19:52:49	realz	what are you talking about

2016-09-20 21:24:06	shtrb	but the plugins didn't change (afaik)
2016-09-20 21:24:17	Armand	When it's been working for longer than I can recall with no client changes?
2016-09-20 21:24:18	shtrb	so maybe there is some difference between the options

2016-09-20 21:24:42	gitgud	could be that something was changed in freenode sasl module that broke those clients
2016-09-20 21:24:46	gitgud	but not hexchat
2016-09-20 21:24:52	shtrb	Armand yes :)

2016-09-21 01:37:05	eris	That's a weird analogy.  Trying to take care of the crime is what a cop would do, and you're essentially saying that trying to do that is futile.

2016-09-21 12:56:01	starsailor	Yep.
2016-09-21 12:56:04	gitgud	if there is only one irc server would there be port exhaustion issues if said server reached more than 60000 concurrent clients ?
2016-09-21 12:56:12	starsailor	hackern0v1c3: Look in your server/status window or tab.

2016-09-21 12:56:36		[12:56]
2016-09-21 12:56:39	grumble	gitgud: it is source-sport-dest-dport that needs to be unique. so as long as you have distinct IPs that the users are connecting from, no
2016-09-21 12:56:43	honey	just saying.
2016-09-21 12:57:02	grumble	gitgud: however if they are all connecting from the same host, you will run out of source-sport-dest-dport tuples indeed

2016-09-21 12:57:17	derpherp128	SE'ing?

2016-09-21 12:57:42	gitgud	grumble, i see
2016-09-21 12:58:12	gitgud	grumble, but now for the opposite side. if my computer connects to a server many times. would there be port exhaustion issues then on my side?
2016-09-21 12:58:14	grumble	honey: this is just the basics of how TCP works, it's not like that knowledge couldnt be found within 10 minutes of googling ^^
2016-09-21 12:58:23	honey	no shit. lol

2016-09-21 14:33:54	page2	i thought you were asking about where/how to host a chatroom

2016-09-21 14:34:13	Gryllida	page2 Rota wants to host a chat server for the company he/she works for. The company wants to run a forum and a chat for user support and hired Rota to set it up.
2016-09-21 14:34:16	Rota	I am. There are requirements I have to satisfy, IRC meets them.
2016-09-21 14:34:20	page2	you can use an embedded irc client

2016-09-21 14:36:08	Rota	got it

2016-09-21 19:07:01	kung	[04:18:48] Hi, where can I activate this "full text" console in Firefox 50 Developer Edition? https://i.gyazo.com/ee972899f5fca75c60ae8738f316830e.png [04:18:48]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	kung	[04:19:17] In Firefox 49 it's the top-right "Play" button [04:19:17]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	kung	[04:22:19] And is this "Firebug" just a theme for the default developer console? It's so awkward to work with, only a REPL line, not a whole text area [04:22:19]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	kung	[04:35:54] So Firebug is now degraded to a theme for the stock Developer Console? [04:35:54]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	kung	[04:36:19] Anyway to get the old version? Or is this because of the PNaCl change? [04:36:19]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	lion4407	[04:39:07] anyone here good with using imap server for email similar too pop3 [04:39:07]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	lion4407	[04:39:38] I deleted some messages in my thunderbird inbox but it wants to redownload the messages all over again [04:39:38]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	Stryyker	[04:41:34] Is thunderbird using imap or pop3? [04:41:34]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	johnc4510	[04:44:05] Stryyker: i'm pretty sure it's pop3 [04:44:05]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	kung	[04:44:22] just realized im in wrong channel, oops, sorry [04:44:22]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	johnc4510	[04:44:28] np [04:44:28]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	Stryyker	[04:46:18] sounds like it was only deleting local copies then [04:46:18]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	grawity	[04:47:00] if the pop3 client is configured to "leave messages on server", [04:47:00]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	johnc4510	[04:47:00] nods [04:47:00]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	grawity	[04:47:09] then it just keeps downloading everything that still is on server [04:47:09]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	grawity	[04:47:13] everything that it hasn't [04:47:13]

2016-09-21 19:07:01	grawity	[04:47:41] (some are a little smarter, but it's POP3 after all – it doesn't /require/ any smarts, it's meant to be a dumb fetch-and-forget protocol) [04:47:41]

2016-09-21 19:07:01	lion4407	[04:50:47] i know pop3 has a setting to delete off of server [04:50:47]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	lion4407	[04:50:52] but imap does not [04:50:52]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	lion4407	[04:51:30] when i delete emails in my inbox they get redownloaded lol [04:51:30]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	Stryyker	[04:54:20] what are your thunderbird settings for that account when you delete? [04:54:20]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	lion4407	[04:55:44] let me check [04:55:44]

2016-09-21 19:07:01	Stryyker	[04:56:37] when did the issue start? [04:56:37]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	lion4407	[04:57:14] i just started using a new imap server [04:57:14]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	lion4407	[04:57:16] new email [04:57:16]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	lion4407	[04:57:44] I could ask the admin but i did not want too unless it is a server issue and not a thunderbird setting [04:57:44]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	Stryyker	[04:58:23] Does it have webmail? [04:58:23]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	lion4407	[04:58:28] yes [04:58:28]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	lion4407	[04:58:36] maybe its a setting there you think? [04:58:36]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	lion4407	[04:58:39] i could look [04:58:39]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	Stryyker	[04:58:50] maybe and does it let you properly delete it there? [04:58:50]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	[RvG]	[04:59:49] Hi there, I just need to know how I can get an unaffiliated cloak. Thank you. [04:59:49]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	lion4407	[05:00:32] i could delete it there but I was wanting it to delete automatically like pop3 [05:00:32]

2016-09-21 19:28:12	lion4407		
2016-09-21 19:28:12	lion4407	Thunderbird defaults to marking messages for deletion, the messages will eventually be deleted from the server but not immediately - usually the messages won't be deleted until you exit. http://kb.mozillazine.org/Deleting_messages_in_IMAP_accounts explains the behavior in a little more detail. There are some benefits and drawbacks to this - the most important benefit being if you undo a deletion, the server still has the message, so it
2016-09-21 19:28:12	lion4407	doesn't have to be transferred back to the server to restore it, and the most important drawback being that deletions take time to synchronize with other clients.

2016-09-22 00:23:54	Armand	[09:58:00] You're so disgustingly un-Freenodian! [09:58:00]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	Armand	[09:58:27] What kind of patriot are you, ehhh?? [09:58:27]

2016-09-22 00:23:54	OnkelTem	[10:01:50] Hi all [10:01:50]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	OnkelTem	[10:03:11] Did someone happen to see some technique on memorizing the shape of a geometric figure, like the shape of a geographical feature? [10:03:11]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	tinyhippo	[10:04:23] can't say I have, OnkelTem [10:04:23]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	peaches	[10:09:05] tinyhippo: you're the tiniest [10:09:05]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	tinyhippo	[10:09:28] peaches: correct [10:09:28]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	peaches	[10:09:36] :D [10:09:36]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	tinyhippo	[10:09:45] peaches: you're the peachiest [10:09:45]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	 *	peaches [10:09:59] so peaches [10:09:59]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	 *	pweh [10:14:54] slaps tinyhippo´s pussy for freedom [10:14:54]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	trotyl_	[10:15:01] in xchat I have setup list of irc servers like freenode rizon etc. How do I connect to server at given url ? [10:15:01]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	tinyhippo	[10:15:31] trotyl_: do you mean, how do you connect to a particular server within the list? [10:15:31]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	tinyhippo	[10:15:38] or something else [10:15:38]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	MrElendig	[10:17:01] tinyhippo: don't use xchat, it died a decade ago, use hexchat instead [10:17:01]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	trotyl_	[10:17:01] well in xchat I have list of servers. names. no url is visible. I was looking for something in poland so I guess I have to find the polish server and I did. but i have only url. no place to put it in xchat. is there an command to connect? [10:17:01]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	jiggawattz	[10:17:21] trotyl_: you can do /server irc.server.net [10:17:21]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	tinyhippo	[10:17:28] MrElendig: I dont use xchat. [10:17:28]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	jiggawattz	[10:17:31] to connect to a specific server [10:17:31]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	MrElendig	[10:17:40] trotyl_: let the round robin do its job instead of connecting to a specific server [10:17:40]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	jiggawattz	[10:17:41] but you just want to connect to chat.freenode.net - not a specific server [10:17:41]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	trotyl_	[10:17:44] ahh neat [10:17:44]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	xBrightlight	[10:17:48] where is that shit skraito gitgud [10:17:48]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	xBrightlight	[10:17:54] aren't you in his channel [10:17:54]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	MrElendig	[10:18:27] tinyhippo: sorry, was for trotyl_ [10:18:27]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	trotyl_	[10:19:34] so how do i find people in a specific town in the world? is it possible? [10:19:34]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	pweh	[10:20:07] kanyeezy, kanye yeezy? REALLY NOW? [10:20:07]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	gitgud	[10:21:00] xBrightlight, ? [10:21:00]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	gitgud	[10:21:07] what are you on about? [10:21:07]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	tinyhippo	[10:21:30] trotyl_: what do you mean [10:21:30]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	trotyl_	[10:22:22] tinyhippo: I though I could find peple near my town to chat with. [10:22:22]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	tinyhippo	[10:22:40] trotyl_: it is probably unlikely that you would find someone that geographically close to you [10:22:40]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	jiggawattz	[10:23:06] trotyl_: where in Poland are you? [10:23:06]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	trotyl_	[10:23:12] ahh. ok. sorry for silly question [10:23:12]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	trotyl_	[10:23:36] jiggawatts: why do you ask? [10:23:36]
