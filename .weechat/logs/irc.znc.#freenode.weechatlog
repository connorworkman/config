2016-09-16 12:45:52	thumbs	ullf09721: if you want to register a primary (single #) channel, make sure you represent an on-topic group or project by that name, first.
2016-09-16 12:46:11	athenes19	You should add a feature to freenode which, when somebody joins a channel, displays a notice message for you, telling you about the activity and response rate for questions.
2016-09-16 12:46:31	athenes19	As it is now, hundreds of man hours per day are probably wasted because people join dead channels and ask their questions but never get them answered.
2016-09-16 12:46:42	athenes19	It's both annoying for me and heartbreaking to see when it happens to others.
2016-09-16 12:46:59	preaction	the solution is to just ask to ask before you ask

2016-09-16 15:24:25	thumbs	ccat: no. You're wrong again.
2016-09-16 15:24:43	preaction	ccat: then how will a channel that is "inactive" ever become active again? if nobody asks a question, nobody will answer one, meaning it will never become active, ever
