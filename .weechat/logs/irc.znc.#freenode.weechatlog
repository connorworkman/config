2016-09-16 12:45:52	thumbs	ullf09721: if you want to register a primary (single #) channel, make sure you represent an on-topic group or project by that name, first.
2016-09-16 12:46:11	athenes19	You should add a feature to freenode which, when somebody joins a channel, displays a notice message for you, telling you about the activity and response rate for questions.
2016-09-16 12:46:31	athenes19	As it is now, hundreds of man hours per day are probably wasted because people join dead channels and ask their questions but never get them answered.
2016-09-16 12:46:42	athenes19	It's both annoying for me and heartbreaking to see when it happens to others.
2016-09-16 12:46:59	preaction	the solution is to just ask to ask before you ask

2016-09-16 15:24:25	thumbs	ccat: no. You're wrong again.
2016-09-16 15:24:43	preaction	ccat: then how will a channel that is "inactive" ever become active again? if nobody asks a question, nobody will answer one, meaning it will never become active, ever

2016-09-17 01:58:45	Ady	Considering that I am a registered user, and when I start an irc session I eventually get to be recognized with my registered nick, I don't understand why the "fail login" msgs. What is that I am not doing correctly? Is it that I am not really a registered user (as I thought I am)? Or what?
2016-09-17 01:59:02	grawity	it is that someone else keeps trying to log in to your account

2016-09-17 01:59:27	grawity	but due to the way SASL works, nickserv doesn't know who exactly, so it shows "<sasl>" instead of their nick@host

2016-09-18 00:51:29	Fuchs	the problem with our anti spam measure (sigyn) is: she does set k-lines (network wide bans), so any false positives are a bit annoying

2016-09-18 05:53:51	grawity	for a personal 1-user mailserver + 1-user znc, it probably won't even reach 15% CPU most of the time

2016-09-18 05:55:12	derpherp128	what scales more: cpu usage or ram usage with # of clients connected to openvpn?
2016-09-18 05:55:14	thumbs	a web server doesn't need more than 15-30MB of RAM
2016-09-18 05:55:20	mquin	I used to run a znc on whatever the smallest thing was, got a bit choppy if you tried do do a lot at once (like reconnecting to many networks) but was fine otherwise
2016-09-18 05:55:32	B_H	yeap for mysql and web stuff its better have more than 1 gb
2016-09-18 05:55:35	derpherp128	grawity: $0.0067 for nano, $0.013 for micro / hour
2016-09-18 05:55:36	grawity	probably CPU usage if the VM doesn't offer AES hardware accel

2016-09-18 13:24:37	FireFly	[22:58:38] I'm aware :P [22:58:38]

2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:02:59] I just figured you "Aim to misbehave" [23:02:59]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:03:27] Hopefully some in here will get the referene.:-) [23:03:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	MetaNova	[23:03:45] Balistyl: can I bring any grenades? [23:03:45]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:04:03] No, we're not expecting trouble! [23:04:03]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	MetaNova	[23:04:08] aww! [23:04:08]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	MetaNova	[23:04:27] gonna bring all these guns, though, I like to keep my options open [23:04:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:04:35] I just hope we don't encounter any reavers...cause grenades would be good for those! [23:04:35]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:06:08] I really hoped they were going to make a movie about the Shepard...that would be a great prequel [23:06:08]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:06:43] A Shepards Tale! [23:06:43]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	MetaNova	[23:06:49] I'd watch the hell out of that [23:06:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	MetaNova	[23:06:52] double so if it had that title [23:06:52]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	bazhang	[23:07:03] and he could eat shepherd pie [23:07:03]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	bazhang	[23:07:25] count on netflix to bring back the series at some point [23:07:25]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:07:49] I have a theory he knew about the reavers and Miranda. [23:07:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:08:27] Which is why he couldn't go with them to Miranda in the movie, cause he knew what was there and would have stopped them, so they had to write him off the ship [23:08:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:08:32] to make the story work [23:08:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:09:03] I hope so...or Amazon [23:09:03]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:11:03] My other TV theory is that the Blue Meth from Breaking bad caused the Zombie outbreak on Walking dead...but that's just a theory [23:11:03]
