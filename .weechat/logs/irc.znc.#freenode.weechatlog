2016-09-16 12:45:52	thumbs	ullf09721: if you want to register a primary (single #) channel, make sure you represent an on-topic group or project by that name, first.
2016-09-16 12:46:11	athenes19	You should add a feature to freenode which, when somebody joins a channel, displays a notice message for you, telling you about the activity and response rate for questions.
2016-09-16 12:46:31	athenes19	As it is now, hundreds of man hours per day are probably wasted because people join dead channels and ask their questions but never get them answered.
2016-09-16 12:46:42	athenes19	It's both annoying for me and heartbreaking to see when it happens to others.
2016-09-16 12:46:59	preaction	the solution is to just ask to ask before you ask

2016-09-16 15:24:25	thumbs	ccat: no. You're wrong again.
2016-09-16 15:24:43	preaction	ccat: then how will a channel that is "inactive" ever become active again? if nobody asks a question, nobody will answer one, meaning it will never become active, ever

2016-09-17 01:58:45	Ady	Considering that I am a registered user, and when I start an irc session I eventually get to be recognized with my registered nick, I don't understand why the "fail login" msgs. What is that I am not doing correctly? Is it that I am not really a registered user (as I thought I am)? Or what?
2016-09-17 01:59:02	grawity	it is that someone else keeps trying to log in to your account

2016-09-17 01:59:27	grawity	but due to the way SASL works, nickserv doesn't know who exactly, so it shows "<sasl>" instead of their nick@host

2016-09-18 00:51:29	Fuchs	the problem with our anti spam measure (sigyn) is: she does set k-lines (network wide bans), so any false positives are a bit annoying

2016-09-18 05:53:51	grawity	for a personal 1-user mailserver + 1-user znc, it probably won't even reach 15% CPU most of the time

2016-09-18 05:55:12	derpherp128	what scales more: cpu usage or ram usage with # of clients connected to openvpn?
2016-09-18 05:55:14	thumbs	a web server doesn't need more than 15-30MB of RAM
2016-09-18 05:55:20	mquin	I used to run a znc on whatever the smallest thing was, got a bit choppy if you tried do do a lot at once (like reconnecting to many networks) but was fine otherwise
2016-09-18 05:55:32	B_H	yeap for mysql and web stuff its better have more than 1 gb
2016-09-18 05:55:35	derpherp128	grawity: $0.0067 for nano, $0.013 for micro / hour
2016-09-18 05:55:36	grawity	probably CPU usage if the VM doesn't offer AES hardware accel

2016-09-18 13:24:37	FireFly	[22:58:38] I'm aware :P [22:58:38]

2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:02:59] I just figured you "Aim to misbehave" [23:02:59]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:03:27] Hopefully some in here will get the referene.:-) [23:03:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	MetaNova	[23:03:45] Balistyl: can I bring any grenades? [23:03:45]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:04:03] No, we're not expecting trouble! [23:04:03]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	MetaNova	[23:04:08] aww! [23:04:08]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	MetaNova	[23:04:27] gonna bring all these guns, though, I like to keep my options open [23:04:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:04:35] I just hope we don't encounter any reavers...cause grenades would be good for those! [23:04:35]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:06:08] I really hoped they were going to make a movie about the Shepard...that would be a great prequel [23:06:08]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:06:43] A Shepards Tale! [23:06:43]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	MetaNova	[23:06:49] I'd watch the hell out of that [23:06:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	MetaNova	[23:06:52] double so if it had that title [23:06:52]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	bazhang	[23:07:03] and he could eat shepherd pie [23:07:03]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	bazhang	[23:07:25] count on netflix to bring back the series at some point [23:07:25]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:07:49] I have a theory he knew about the reavers and Miranda. [23:07:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:08:27] Which is why he couldn't go with them to Miranda in the movie, cause he knew what was there and would have stopped them, so they had to write him off the ship [23:08:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:08:32] to make the story work [23:08:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:09:03] I hope so...or Amazon [23:09:03]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	Balistyl	[23:11:03] My other TV theory is that the Blue Meth from Breaking bad caused the Zombie outbreak on Walking dead...but that's just a theory [23:11:03]

2016-09-19 05:31:35	steven	there are two types of cholesterol tinyhippo, LDL and HDL, eggs contain both. so you're good. the issue arrises when you have more LDL than HDL
2016-09-19 05:32:04	GitGud	tinyhippo, would you join sd ?
2016-09-19 05:32:10	steven	as long as the ldl and hdl level is equal you have eat as much as you want to tinyhippo .. doesnt matter

2016-09-19 05:37:09	tinyhippo	there are lots of contradictory advice
2016-09-19 05:37:21	tinyhippo	I am tempted to ask a PT/nutrionist to help
2016-09-19 05:37:26	starsailor	tinyhippo: followed those instructions to the tee; it's for GNU/Linux but the same principle applies. the part where it says "11:09 !larich.oftc.net *** Your client certificate fingerprint is: C77106576ABF7F9F90CCA0F63874A60F2E40A64B" isn't what's shown to me here
2016-09-19 05:37:52	grawity	which is to be expected, since those are OFTC instructions and they show you what OFTC servers show
2016-09-19 05:37:56	steven	thats why I prefer the science route .D also yeah you should always consult professionals. I just happened to know some basics since I lift since quite some time and eventually started to learn those things

2016-09-20 00:42:28	starsailor	(Confusingly.)
2016-09-20 00:42:38	GenteelBen	All this proves is we need a new RFC for IRC.
2016-09-20 00:42:55	starsailor	Heh. Yeah, the original RFC had only @ and + (+o and +v) I think.
2016-09-20 00:42:58	starsailor	But it doesn't matter.
2016-09-20 00:43:01	GenteelBen	It's about time IRC supported VP9 / HEVC webcam recording.
2016-09-20 00:43:10	pwrslave	ircnet only has @ and + too

2016-09-20 01:35:24	FireFly	Do you have a CertFP certificate setup?

2016-09-20 01:36:01	FireFly	IlIlIlIlIlIlI: so SASL EXTERNAL is about using another (external) means to authenticate. in the case of IRC, that is a CertFP certificate

2016-09-20 01:36:33	FireFly	oftc has some nice info about how it works/how to configure different clients: https://www.oftc.net/NickServ/CertFP/  it's a bit of setup though, since it uses a certificate instead of plaintext username/password
2016-09-20 01:36:47	IlIlIlIlIlIlI	I don't think I have one yet, will look into it

2016-09-20 01:37:01	starsailor	IlIlIlIlIlIlI: Before you start, make sure Pidgin also supports the EXTERNAL mechanism. As I can see, it only supports PLAIN.

2016-09-20 01:37:53	IlIlIlIlIlIlI	is it possible that your server responds with "incorrect password" error instead of "hey, you provided no CertFP key, please try the next mean of auth"?
2016-09-20 01:37:57	IlIlIlIlIlIlI	or something
2016-09-20 01:38:20	starsailor	I was also confused by that part in the logs. If it's trying EXTERNAL, it needs to match against a hash/fingerprint, not a "password".

(so you do it just once) the next times you connect to freenode, you will need to use the IDENTIFY command to authenticate.

2016-09-20 10:26:52	@christel	ASM is used by a group of collaborating channel ops -- we're not especially fond of its current usage (nor its predecessor)

2016-09-20 10:28:33	starsailor	christel: Unfortunately, I feel the problem is two-sided; staff can't be everywhere at the same time to deal with actual trolls, and it's channels that are hit, channels primarily run by founders and ops.
2016-09-20 10:28:55	starsailor	And of course, it is these same ops that then feel the need for such bots.
2016-09-20 10:29:06	starsailor	I think an issue is the sheer size of the network.

2016-09-20 11:54:24	starsailor	galneg: You can view it as such; the actual purpose is to denote that you are not affiliated with any project hosted on freenode. Hence, unaffiliated.

2016-09-20 11:56:36	Lorax	it's a minor risk reduction where the risk is generally an annoyance
2016-09-20 11:57:14	galneg	starsailor: y but wouldnt tor heavily affect the perfomance? I know it does for me atleast when im using it for darknet browsing
2016-09-20 11:57:32	starsailor	galneg: That is correct, there is actually some mild lag, but it's not anything serious.
2016-09-20 11:57:49	starsailor	galneg: It's not like we're playing CS online. :)
2016-09-20 11:57:55	starsailor	Where latency and lag are game killers.
2016-09-20 11:58:05	incog	wasnt the onion service down for months recently?
2016-09-20 11:58:20	Lorax	tor is another risk reducer which can result in less privacy
2016-09-20 11:58:21	galneg	starsailor: Y Ofc :) Btw am I using this nametag correct?
2016-09-20 11:58:23	starsailor	That is correct, however two days ago, after some testing on the testnet, it was put back into service here.
