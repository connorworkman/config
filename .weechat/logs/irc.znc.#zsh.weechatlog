2016-09-15 20:37:21	psprint	that's what can be called "slightly", i.e. not much, traded for robustness
2016-09-15 20:39:49	danielsh	the idiom with [ is      [ x"foo" = x"bar" ] with the 'x' in front
2016-09-15 20:40:03	danielsh	in zsh you'd usually use [[ though.
2016-09-15 20:40:18	psprint	hmm, when will [ cause problems?

2016-09-15 20:41:47	danielsh	other question, what's an easy way to strip leading/trailing whitespace from a variable?
2016-09-15 20:41:53	danielsh	(actually: from each element of an array)
2016-09-15 20:42:59	Mikachu	a=('  hi ' '  h ello '); echo ${${a# #}% #}

2016-09-15 20:43:17	Mikachu	that could have worked, in theory

2016-09-15 20:44:13	danielsh	thanks - I was hoping for something simpler, eg python has foo.strip() for this.
2016-09-15 20:44:13	Mikachu	> a=('  hi ' '  h ello '); echo ${${a## #}%% #}
2016-09-15 20:44:14	machabot	Mikachu: hi h ello
2016-09-15 20:44:21	Mikachu	i forgot # % is shortest possible match
2016-09-15 20:45:20	psprint	just a drop in from my code: cmd="${cmd##[[:space:]]#}" cmd="${cmd%%[[:space:]]#}"   AFAIR [[:space:]] has those unicode spaces (if it's not [[:blank:]], but rather not.. If I'm not confusing this with vim right now.. but easy to check..)
2016-09-15 20:46:47	danielsh	thanks psprint
2016-09-15 20:47:29	psprint	YH, that [[ vs [ test is 66ms vs 546ms on my machine..
