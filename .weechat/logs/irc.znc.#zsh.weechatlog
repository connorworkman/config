2016-09-15 20:37:21	psprint	that's what can be called "slightly", i.e. not much, traded for robustness
2016-09-15 20:39:49	danielsh	the idiom with [ is      [ x"foo" = x"bar" ] with the 'x' in front
2016-09-15 20:40:03	danielsh	in zsh you'd usually use [[ though.
2016-09-15 20:40:18	psprint	hmm, when will [ cause problems?

2016-09-15 20:41:47	danielsh	other question, what's an easy way to strip leading/trailing whitespace from a variable?
2016-09-15 20:41:53	danielsh	(actually: from each element of an array)
2016-09-15 20:42:59	Mikachu	a=('  hi ' '  h ello '); echo ${${a# #}% #}

2016-09-15 20:43:17	Mikachu	that could have worked, in theory

2016-09-15 20:44:13	danielsh	thanks - I was hoping for something simpler, eg python has foo.strip() for this.
2016-09-15 20:44:13	Mikachu	> a=('  hi ' '  h ello '); echo ${${a## #}%% #}
2016-09-15 20:44:14	machabot	Mikachu: hi h ello
2016-09-15 20:44:21	Mikachu	i forgot # % is shortest possible match
2016-09-15 20:45:20	psprint	just a drop in from my code: cmd="${cmd##[[:space:]]#}" cmd="${cmd%%[[:space:]]#}"   AFAIR [[:space:]] has those unicode spaces (if it's not [[:blank:]], but rather not.. If I'm not confusing this with vim right now.. but easy to check..)
2016-09-15 20:46:47	danielsh	thanks psprint

2016-09-16 20:51:32	psprint	a=my, myvar${a}=1 doesn't work, such namespacing can be done only via (P) probably?
2016-09-16 20:53:18	Mikachu	to some degree you can also use typeset
2016-09-16 20:53:27	Mikachu	> a=my; typeset $a=hello; echo $my
2016-09-16 20:53:28	machabot	Mikachu: hello
2016-09-16 20:54:28	llua	associative arrays are normally used for this kind of stuff
2016-09-16 20:55:24	danielsh	«parameters[$x]=y» doesn't do it either.
2016-09-16 20:56:12	psprint	thanks
2016-09-16 20:57:34	psprint	I could flood set's output etc. with separate variables, better to migrate to hash
2016-09-16 20:58:16	danielsh	assocs show in `set` too
2016-09-16 21:03:41	psprint	ah right, so will use -h for this
2016-09-16 21:03:41		[21:03]
2016-09-16 21:04:30	psprint	or rather -H

2016-09-16 21:10:12	danielsh	(these are intended for variables where restoring the value doesn't make sense)

2016-09-17 02:24:34	ahacker	I have a small problem, more like an annoyance. As we all know zsh has "command/filename correction" usually in case we mispell or mistype something. however, when i use mv sometimes the new filename is one number off from similar names in the same directory. Is there a way to ommit any instance of mv from the correction checking?
2016-09-17 02:24:49	Mikachu	alias mv=nocorrect\ mv
2016-09-17 02:25:03	Mikachu	i personally would recommend to not use the correctall setting though
2016-09-17 02:25:25	Mikachu	since in the normal case any existing filename on the commandline will have been produced by tabcompletion anyway
2016-09-17 02:25:34	ahacker	and i can just put that in my .zshrc
2016-09-17 02:25:38	ahacker	hmmm, ok
2016-09-17 02:25:42	ahacker	good to know
2016-09-17 02:25:42	Mikachu	you sure can
2016-09-17 02:25:52	Mikachu	i mean, do you type out long filenames without pressing tab?
2016-09-17 02:26:08	ahacker	no
2016-09-17 02:29:13	ahacker	so i can still tab complete, with this alias it just won't try and correct me with a filename that already exists?
2016-09-17 02:29:31	ahacker	I don't want to accidenty overwrite data
2016-09-17 02:31:23	Mikachu	well
2016-09-17 02:31:33	Mikachu	if you want to be really careful you can do alias mv='nocorrect mv -i'
2016-09-17 02:31:44	Mikachu	and mv will also ask you if you're crazy if you give an existing filename, and zsh won't suggest them
2016-09-17 02:35:41	osse	no matter how l33t you are you're allowed to open a file manager two times a year

2016-09-17 02:37:23	veverak	hi folks, I recently switched to zsh as my primary shell and notice one ... problem
2016-09-17 02:37:51	veverak	when I ssh into customers servers (which are using bash and can't be changed) and try to open vim
2016-09-17 02:38:12	veverak	I don't see proper syntax hilighting, like... colors won't change at all and just some things are underlined
2016-09-17 02:38:28	veverak	any tips what to google to get rid of this problem?
2016-09-17 02:38:31	danielsh	check your $TERM value
2016-09-17 02:38:40	osse	it's unlikely that zsh influences that
2016-09-17 02:38:48	osse	unless you use(d) to set TERM in zshrc or bashrc
2016-09-17 02:39:04	danielsh	osse, $TERM propagate over ssh.
2016-09-17 02:39:28	Mikachu	setting TERM in your shell init files is wrong
2016-09-17 02:39:31	danielsh	... so that theory accounts for one mystery here.
2016-09-17 02:39:45	scp1	sendenv TERM=nogood

2016-09-17 02:39:57	danielsh	veverak, is the value different between bash and zsh
2016-09-17 02:40:00	danielsh	?
2016-09-17 02:40:08	veverak	yep
2016-09-17 02:40:13	veverak	bash got xterm-256color
2016-09-17 02:40:24	scp1	veverak, it's likely there's no terminfo for that terminal on your customers server
2016-09-17 02:40:40	Mikachu	you must be doing something incredibly wrong for that to happen
2016-09-17 02:40:55	veverak	hmm
2016-09-17 02:40:58	veverak	manually changed it
2016-09-17 02:41:00	veverak	and now it works
2016-09-17 02:41:02	veverak	scp1: yep
2016-09-17 02:41:19	veverak	thanks!
2016-09-17 02:41:23	scp1	veverak, add sendenv TERM=xterm-256color to your .ssh/config section
2016-09-17 02:41:25	danielsh	veverak, that'll be $5, non-consecutive used bank notes

2016-09-17 02:44:26	osse	danielsh: yes, I know. my guess is that he sets it in .bashrc but not .zshrc
2016-09-17 02:44:40	veverak	osse: it was not in .bashrc
2016-09-17 02:44:45	veverak	nor the /etc/bash.bashrc
2016-09-17 02:44:54	Mikachu	do you use xterm or urxvt?
2016-09-17 02:45:01	veverak	urxvt
2016-09-17 02:45:16	Mikachu	then it's surprising that the xterm value works better
2016-09-17 02:45:42	veverak	true
2016-09-17 02:45:55	japh	mikachu, missing terminfo on server
2016-09-17 02:46:03	danielsh	by the way, what's that character on veverak 's RPS1?  It looks like a Sigma in hexchat and like <b2> in my terminal
2016-09-17 02:46:25	veverak	error code showed by powershell
2016-09-17 02:46:39	veverak	it should be 'left arrow'

2016-09-17 16:04:59	Mikachu	you're maybe a bit confused about what's happening here
2016-09-17 16:05:08	Mikachu	zsh supports tying a scalar parameter to an array parameter
2016-09-17 16:05:16	Mikachu	$path is the array, and $PATH is scalar (separated by colons)
2016-09-17 16:05:34	Celmor	I want to set $path but it causes it no longer to find programs in $PATH
2016-09-17 16:05:37	Mikachu	there's no case insensitivity going on
2016-09-17 16:05:42	Mikachu	use another parameter name

2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:01:38] why is zsh not differentiating between $path and $PATH? [02:01:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Mikachu	[02:01:46] yes [02:01:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:03:50] how do I enable case-sensitivity for variable names? [02:03:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Mikachu	[02:04:59] you're maybe a bit confused about what's happening here [02:04:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Mikachu	[02:05:08] zsh supports tying a scalar parameter to an array parameter [02:05:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Mikachu	[02:05:16] $path is the array, and $PATH is scalar (separated by colons) [02:05:16]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:05:34] I want to set $path but it causes it no longer to find programs in $PATH [02:05:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Mikachu	[02:05:37] there's no case insensitivity going on [02:05:37]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Mikachu	[02:05:42] use another parameter name [02:05:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:06:27] how do I disable there also being an array? does there have to be this functionality? [02:06:27]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:06:49] I have scripts that use $path, would be a shame if all of them don't work anymor [02:06:49]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:09:21] can I get the default POSIX behaviour of ^u? what function would that behaviour be called in zsh? [02:09:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	llua	[02:12:11] there is no posix behaviour for u, so describe what you expect [02:12:11]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:13:58] then bash behavior [02:13:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	llua	[02:14:12] and that behavior is? [02:14:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:14:17] most shells I work with work like bash do as in yanking from cursor to beginning of prompt [02:14:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:14:43] zsh just discards the whole line [02:14:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	larryv	[02:16:43] backward-kill-line [02:16:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:17:07] does it also tank it so I can paste it with ^y ? [02:17:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:17:11] yank* [02:17:11]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	llua	[02:17:40] yes [02:17:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:22:04] thanks, got it working [02:22:04]

2016-09-18 11:35:14	ft	Since we have to guess, I'm going for screwed up value in $TERM (either inside or outside of tmux) or screwed up value in $PS1.
2016-09-18 11:35:56	bryz	This is "out of the box" oh-my-zsh and tmux
2016-09-18 11:36:12	bryz	It's fine outside of tmux btw
2016-09-18 11:36:37	ft	Since omz is known for its quality code.
2016-09-18 11:37:13	ft	What's the value of $TERM inside and outside of tmux?

2016-09-18 11:42:14	ft	omz is just a set of configuration files for zsh. And they caused lots of trouble in here. It's usually: "Do you have a weird problem nobody else has?" "Yeah, and I'm using omz."
2016-09-18 11:42:48	bryz	ah, im getting some results not that i'm searching for omz

2016-09-18 11:44:17	machabot	"omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the channel #oh-my-zsh.

2016-09-18 13:24:38	bryz	[21:40:52] I've just been searching for "zsh" [21:40:52]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:42:14] omz is just a set of configuration files for zsh. And they caused lots of trouble in here. It's usually: "Do you have a weird problem nobody else has?" "Yeah, and I'm using omz." [21:42:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	bryz	[21:42:48] ah, im getting some results not that i'm searching for omz [21:42:48]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	bryz	[21:43:07] now* - thanks for the help [21:43:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:43:33] Could be a tmux problem too. I have no idea how they implement the graphic characters. Maybe they are multi-character wide and something goes wrong with counting. I don't know. [21:43:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:43:54] You're welcome, and good luck. [21:43:54]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	chris2	[21:44:17] !omz [21:44:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	machabot	[21:44:17] "omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the channel #oh-my-zsh. [21:44:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:45:12] chris2: Thanks! I thought they had their own channel, but couldn't remember. [21:45:12]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	 *	chris2 [21:46:26] just checked if there are even people in there :P [21:46:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:46:53] chris2: And the result? :) [21:46:53]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	chris2	[21:47:09] 28 [21:47:09]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:47:37] That's fair. I remember when this channel had about that number of users. :) [21:47:37]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	chris2	[21:48:07] i didnt realize its 400+ now... [21:48:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:48:14] Yes. Crazy. :) [21:48:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	chris2	[21:48:26] felt like 120 perhaps :P [21:48:26]

2016-09-19 02:44:07	Magnetz74	[04:30:18] In default zsh is l not ls -l? [04:30:18]

2016-09-19 15:52:54	voxadam	If I want to reference the XDG directories ($XDG_DATA_HOME, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, etc.) in my zshrc do I need to define them in my zshenv?

2016-09-19 16:06:00		[16:00]
2016-09-19 16:07:22	voxadam	I'm in the process of refactoring my dotfiles with one of the primary goals to clean up my home directory by coaxing as may programs as possible to store their config, runtime, cache, and other files in the applicable XDG base directory. I was thinking that it probably makes sense to all the $XDG_* variables in my zshenv file but I was curious what other people would recommend.
2016-09-19 16:08:21	Mikachu	usually you would set environment variables in zprofile or whatever file gets sourced by your environment when you log in
2016-09-19 16:08:28	Mikachu	they then get inherited normally by all child processes
2016-09-19 16:08:41	Mikachu	if you put it in zshenv, whatever is in the environment gets overridden by the default in every new zsh process
2016-09-19 16:08:52	Mikachu	also
2016-09-19 16:09:09	Mikachu	the default for anything that follows the XDG spec is already to use the correct directories
2016-09-19 16:09:15	Mikachu	so setting them to their defaults is not really helpful in any way
2016-09-19 16:09:26	voxadam	That's good to know. zprofile or zlogin makes much more sense.
2016-09-19 16:10:05	Mikachu	ie, according to the spec when you want to use an xdg directory the way to do it is something like do_stuff ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share} or whatever
2016-09-19 16:10:37	voxadam	I reference variables like $XDG_CONFIG_HOME in my zshrc and shell scripts so the variables need to be exported.
2016-09-19 16:10:50	Mikachu	you shouldn't depend on them being set
2016-09-19 16:11:14	voxadam	You make a good point.
2016-09-19 16:11:17	Mikachu	"If $XDG_DATA_HOME is either not set or empty, a default equal to $HOME/.local/share should be used."
2016-09-19 16:11:20	Mikachu	and same for all the others

2016-09-19 16:12:24	voxadam	One issue is that I use my dotfiles on multiple machines. Sometimes on machines that don't use Freedesktop specs (e.g. MacOS).

2016-09-19 16:12:41	voxadam	I'm doing what I can to make my conf files as portable as possible.
2016-09-19 16:12:51	Mikachu	well
2016-09-19 16:12:56	Mikachu	if your scripts use the spec
2016-09-19 16:13:05	Mikachu	then you can set XDG_DATA_HOME to whatever directory you want that script to use on macos
2016-09-19 16:13:14	Mikachu	in your zprofile or equivalent there
2016-09-19 16:13:26	Mikachu	that's the whole point
2016-09-19 16:13:28	Mikachu	kinda
2016-09-19 16:13:49	voxadam	I'll go ahead define them in zprofile.
2016-09-19 16:13:56	voxadam	Thanks for the advice.
2016-09-19 16:14:11	Mikachu	you should make sure your scripts work with or without them set though~
2016-09-19 16:14:27	 *	voxadam shutters at the thought of unit testing his dotfiles.
2016-09-19 16:14:33	voxadam	:)
2016-09-19 16:14:59	Mikachu	well, when you say 'script' i am thinking something more standalone from dotfiles

2016-09-19 16:18:07	voxadam	I suppose I'll still need to set $ZDOTDIR to ~/.config/zsh in my zshenv if I feel like keeping all my zsh related confs with everything else.

2016-09-19 16:21:40	voxadam	Interesting, I just learned about NO_GLOBAL_RCS. I can imagine that being useful for a Type-A controlling personality such as myself.
2016-09-19 16:21:40		[16:21]
2016-09-19 16:23:44	Mikachu	depends on how bad your distro is
2016-09-19 16:23:50	Mikachu	just keep in mind /etc/zshenv will always be sourced
2016-09-19 16:24:02	voxadam	Makes sense.
2016-09-19 16:24:03	Mikachu	and yeah, you also always need a ~/.zshenv to set up ZDOTDIR
2016-09-19 16:24:45	voxadam	Some people define a lot using zshenv.

2016-09-19 16:26:38	Mikachu	that makes me cry...
2016-09-19 16:27:19	voxadam	That bad?
2016-09-19 16:28:02	Mikachu	well, it's putting zsh parameters into the environment for no reason, overriding inherited $PATH, ...
2016-09-19 16:28:34	voxadam	It's a tad excessive.

2016-09-20 00:39:08	machabot	[21:11:52] llua: \there should be two slashes [21:11:52]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	llua	[21:12:15] but `` noms one [21:12:15]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Sasazuka	[22:05:15] sorry stepped away a bit, instead of using IFS, I would need to know how many lines there are right? do I just use "wc -l" on it to find out or is there some other way? [22:05:15]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Sasazuka	[22:09:55] ah nevermind I just read the doc on it [22:09:55]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	llua	[22:11:58] you use ${(f)"$(docker ps --format "{{.ID}};{{.Names}};{{.Image}};{{.Ports}}")"} [22:11:58]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	llua	[22:12:03] as-is [22:12:03]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Sasazuka	[22:13:49] it seems to treat it as a single element [22:13:49]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Sasazuka	[22:15:14] ah I see, I needed to use () or just use it without var [22:15:14]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[01:52:54] If I want to reference the XDG directories ($XDG_DATA_HOME, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, etc.) in my zshrc do I need to define them in my zshenv? [01:52:54]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:07:22] I'm in the process of refactoring my dotfiles with one of the primary goals to clean up my home directory by coaxing as may programs as possible to store their config, runtime, cache, and other files in the applicable XDG base directory. I was thinking that it probably makes sense to all the $XDG_* variables in my zshenv file but I was curious what other people would recommend. [02:07:22]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:08:21] usually you would set environment variables in zprofile or whatever file gets sourced by your environment when you log in [02:08:21]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:08:28] they then get inherited normally by all child processes [02:08:28]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:08:41] if you put it in zshenv, whatever is in the environment gets overridden by the default in every new zsh process [02:08:41]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:08:52] also [02:08:52]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:09:09] the default for anything that follows the XDG spec is already to use the correct directories [02:09:09]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:09:15] so setting them to their defaults is not really helpful in any way [02:09:15]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:09:26] That's good to know. zprofile or zlogin makes much more sense. [02:09:26]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:10:05] ie, according to the spec when you want to use an xdg directory the way to do it is something like do_stuff ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share} or whatever [02:10:05]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:10:37] I reference variables like $XDG_CONFIG_HOME in my zshrc and shell scripts so the variables need to be exported. [02:10:37]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:10:50] you shouldn't depend on them being set [02:10:50]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:11:14] You make a good point. [02:11:14]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:11:17] "If $XDG_DATA_HOME is either not set or empty, a default equal to $HOME/.local/share should be used." [02:11:17]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:11:20] and same for all the others [02:11:20]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:12:24] One issue is that I use my dotfiles on multiple machines. Sometimes on machines that don't use Freedesktop specs (e.g. MacOS). [02:12:24]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:12:41] I'm doing what I can to make my conf files as portable as possible. [02:12:41]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:12:51] well [02:12:51]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:12:56] if your scripts use the spec [02:12:56]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:13:05] then you can set XDG_DATA_HOME to whatever directory you want that script to use on macos [02:13:05]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:13:14] in your zprofile or equivalent there [02:13:14]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:13:26] that's the whole point [02:13:26]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:13:28] kinda [02:13:28]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:13:49] I'll go ahead define them in zprofile. [02:13:49]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:13:56] Thanks for the advice. [02:13:56]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:14:11] you should make sure your scripts work with or without them set though~ [02:14:11]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	 *	voxadam [02:14:27] shutters at the thought of unit testing his dotfiles. [02:14:27]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:14:33] :) [02:14:33]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:14:59] well, when you say 'script' i am thinking something more standalone from dotfiles [02:14:59]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:18:07] I suppose I'll still need to set $ZDOTDIR to ~/.config/zsh in my zshenv if I feel like keeping all my zsh related confs with everything else. [02:18:07]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:21:39] Interesting, I just learned about NO_GLOBAL_RCS. I can imagine that being useful for a Type-A controlling personality such as myself. [02:21:39]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:23:44] depends on how bad your distro is [02:23:44]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:23:50] just keep in mind /etc/zshenv will always be sourced [02:23:50]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:24:02] Makes sense. [02:24:02]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:24:03] and yeah, you also always need a ~/.zshenv to set up ZDOTDIR [02:24:03]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:24:45] Some people define a lot using zshenv. [02:24:45]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:25:14] the name is a bit misleading... [02:25:14]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:26:11] For example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pschmitt/zsh-config/master/.zshenv [02:26:11]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:26:37] that makes me cry... [02:26:37]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:27:19] That bad? [02:27:19]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:28:02] well, it's putting zsh parameters into the environment for no reason, overriding inherited $PATH, ... [02:28:02]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:28:34] It's a tad excessive. [02:28:34]

2016-09-20 18:53:19	danielsh	[14:07:00] "do one thing and do it well" and all that ;) [14:07:00]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	ascii-soup	[14:07:45] did you mean to leave me hanging here? [14:07:45]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	ascii-soup	[14:07:47] what's the second feature? [14:07:47]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	 *	ascii-soup [14:07:53] is on the edge of his seat [14:07:53]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	psprint	[14:08:07] ok I reveal what it'll be: at alternate screen (Zcurses) there will be statistical data for the Current Project: last 2-3 commits, list of modified files, thinking about others. And hopefully a way to switch between last active project. And maybe interface to ag, the ack written in C, but unsure [14:08:07]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	ascii-soup	[14:08:35] ...! [14:08:35]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	ascii-soup	[14:08:40] Awesome [14:08:40]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	psprint	[14:11:30] yeah thinking that too and it hurts my mind, hard to focus on this [14:11:30]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	thebope	[14:40:20] I have an alias in my .zshrc 'alias vmc="v $(g diff --name-only --diff-filter=U)"', but it appears to be running every time i load a new terminal? I get [14:40:20]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	thebope	[14:40:31] Not a git repository [14:40:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	thebope	[14:40:58] For the record that expands out to vim $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U) [14:40:58]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	thebope	[14:41:26] I enjoy the alias but i don't want it to run every time I open a terminal [14:41:26]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	thebope	[14:41:33] Is there a way to do that? [14:41:33]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	chris2	[14:41:52] use ' not " [14:41:52]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	chris2	[14:42:00] with " the $() is run at parse time [14:42:00]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	chris2	[14:42:24] or do it right and define a function :) [14:42:24]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	 *	danielsh [14:44:18] uses git ls-files --unmerged -z and vim +/'^<<<<<<' [14:44:18]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	thebope	[14:47:32] Thanks chris2 [14:47:32]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	thebope	[14:47:39] yea I defined my first function last night, was nice [14:47:39]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	danielsh	[16:24:15] Completion/Darwin/Type/_retrieve_mac_apps has ":completion:*:*:$service:commands". [16:24:15]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	danielsh	[16:24:29] I assume that needs braces. [16:24:29]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	wtiger	[19:33:41] Hi! [19:33:41]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	wtiger	[19:34:03] can zsh interpret bash commands as well? [19:34:03]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	thrig	[19:34:55] yes. no. maybe. [19:34:55]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	wtiger	[19:35:19] how so? [19:35:19]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	larryv	[19:39:09] it can interpret any bash commands that are valid zsh syntax [19:39:09]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	larryv	[19:39:17] doesn't necessarily mean it'll behave the same [19:39:17]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	wtiger	[19:39:55] ok, if I send in bash syntax and expect bash like behavior? [19:39:55]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	wtiger	[19:40:04] can that be done? [19:40:04]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	wtiger	[19:42:13] something like <backward-compatibility>? [19:42:13]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	phy1729	[19:49:24] If you want bash, you should really use bash. [19:49:24]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	wtiger	[19:49:35] hmm, i figure [19:49:35]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	llua	[22:06:10] danielsh: it does [22:06:10]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	danielsh	[23:12:50] llua, yes I know, I was just hoping lazyweb would commit the fix. [23:12:50]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	llua	[23:43:08] ''for word in ${words:1}; do'' [23:43:08]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	llua	[23:43:17] weeeee [23:43:17]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	llua	[23:45:27] it actually starts off at 0, TIL. [23:45:27]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	nostrora	[02:04:31] [gregoire@archlinux:~]$ zsh \[\e[1;38;5;242m\][\[\e[1;38;5;214m\]\u\[\e[1;38;5;242m\]@\[\e[1;38;5;161m\]\h\[\e[1;38;5;242m\]:\[\e[1;38;5;33m\]\W$(__git_ps1 "\[\e[1;38;5;242m\]|\[\e[1;38;5;81m\]")\[\e[1;38;5;242m\]]\[\e[0m\]$(get_prompt_symbol) [02:04:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	nostrora	[02:04:36] Why i get this ? [02:04:36]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	Mikachu	[02:04:52] because whoever wrote your .bashrc doesn't know what theyred oing [02:04:52]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	nostrora	[02:06:14] Mikachu: ow :( can i remove bashrc ? [02:06:14]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	Mikachu	[02:06:22] um [02:06:22]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	Mikachu	[02:06:33] it won't be a problem once you set up zsh [02:06:33]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	Mikachu	[02:06:49] but your bash setup shouldn't export PROMPT, just set it normally as a parameter [02:06:49]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	nostrora	[02:06:50] There is no an .zshrc ? [02:06:50]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	nostrora	[02:11:49] Hi! Where i can find a good .zshrc ? [02:11:49]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	nostrora	[02:13:27] oh my zsh is a zshrc ? [02:13:27]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	danielsh	[02:29:01] !omz [02:29:01]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	machabot	[02:29:01] "omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the channel #oh-my-zsh. [02:29:01]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	llua	[02:48:36] he be gone [02:48:36]

2016-09-21 03:07:14	Mikachu	well, there is some static variables that are used both by isearch and by the comparison functions

2016-09-21 03:19:42	psprint	I'm thinking. The variable detection is quite nice, and I guess bash hash "local" too, but other things might not match, like "float", not having energy to examine how this aligns with Bash, and it's rather important to them, if the project is alive actually
2016-09-21 03:20:11	psprint	also added cool patch to: examine Vim and Emacs modelines, last and first 5 lines, of each file with unrecognized extension or no extension and no shebang.. :]

2016-09-21 03:20:47	danielsh	psprint, I can't speak for them, but I assume the ctags zsh parser will be configured according to the zsh community's preferences, not according to parity with ${foo}sh

2016-09-21 03:21:45	danielsh	psprint, That means you have to do rebases and replants in order to shape it as a PR ...
2016-09-21 03:23:56	psprint	maybe someone has a reasonable solution to this: when to update generated ctags file so that when entering zcommodore's searcher, it's not off the wall where editor will open

2016-09-21 03:25:39	psprint	It's in POSTDISPLAY, like the history-search-multi-word, reused the code
2016-09-21 03:27:02	psprint	hm maybe besides ^O^K I'll do ^O^L to start searcher first regenerating.. It's about something reasonable for something generally unsolvable
2016-09-21 03:29:15	psprint	danielsh: looked at z-sy-h source code about the via-hash optimization, hit on _zsh_highlight_add_highlight(), any region_highlight update goes through that. I think it's a bad news and good news, bad is: where to keep index for the hash, ZSYH[rhindex] comes to my mind, but maybe it should be ZSYH_INDEX since we optimizing.. Not very confortable things

2016-09-21 05:14:22	danielsh	^7heo, thanks for the feedback.  I thought something like this needs to be added, maybe we could create a 20.2 Example section before diving into reference material.
2016-09-21 05:14:46	danielsh	^7heo, yes.
2016-09-21 05:15:52	^7heo	danielsh: yes a 20.2 section would really great.
2016-09-21 05:16:16	^7heo	danielsh: I was searching for such an example, since I already knew what was the completion function's name, and the function I have made's name too.
2016-09-21 05:16:23	^7heo	danielsh: I only needed to link to two.

2016-09-21 05:52:10	danielsh	^7heo, zftp delete $file, it seems --- even though 'delete' is missing from the completion

2016-09-21 05:52:26	danielsh	pws started signing git tags recently.
2016-09-21 05:52:26	^7heo	so people won't do it by mistake.
2016-09-21 05:52:35	danielsh	no, it's not
2016-09-21 05:52:38	danielsh	it's a bug in the completion

2016-09-21 05:53:39	danielsh	you can set the ignore-patterns style if you like it the way it is

2016-09-21 05:54:09	^7heo	I wish I could grep -rni over ftp
2016-09-21 05:54:24	^7heo	unfortunately the only way is to download the whole dir and grep locally
2016-09-21 05:54:25	danielsh	I usually ssh over and grep there, when I can
2016-09-21 05:54:30	^7heo	sure
2016-09-21 05:54:38	^7heo	but that's a very basic ftp server with nothing else

2016-09-21 12:41:38	 *	^7heo [15:06:15] is in .de [15:06:15]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	ascii-soup	[15:06:45] ;) [15:06:45]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:07:05] and it's not "really" in europe. [15:07:05]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	 *	^7heo [15:07:14] starts trolls early this week [15:07:14]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:14:22] ^7heo, thanks for the feedback.  I thought something like this needs to be added, maybe we could create a 20.2 Example section before diving into reference material. [15:14:22]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:14:46] ^7heo, yes. [15:14:46]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:15:51] danielsh: yes a 20.2 section would really great. [15:15:51]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:16:16] danielsh: I was searching for such an example, since I already knew what was the completion function's name, and the function I have made's name too. [15:16:16]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:16:23] danielsh: I only needed to link to two. [15:16:23]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:16:29] ^7heo, Maybe you could even write it :-) [15:16:29]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:41:24] danielsh: sure [15:41:24]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:41:30] danielsh: is there a place where I can submit a patch? [15:41:30]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:42:17] ^7heo, zsh-workers@zsh.org, the source of that file is Doc/Zsh/compsys.yo [15:42:17]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:42:48] ^7heo, if yodl is too high a learning curve then just send text and we'll take care or formatting it. [15:42:48]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:42:53] ^7heo, thanks! [15:42:53]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:47:47] danielsh: what RCS format for the patch? [15:47:47]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:48:08] ok git [15:48:08]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:49:07] I don't wanna troll, but sf.net aren't exactly the most reliable hosters on the planet ;) [15:49:07]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:50:01] that being said, github isn't perfect either. [15:50:01]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:51:14] any idea how to remove documents from an FTP using zftp? [15:51:14]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:51:17] *shrug* it works, and if they shutter up tomorrow we'll just move git somewhere else and move on [15:51:17]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:51:31] sure, that makes sense [15:51:31]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:51:42] I just don't trust people who alter the binaries before shipping. [15:51:42]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:52:10] ^7heo, zftp delete $file, it seems --- even though 'delete' is missing from the completion [15:52:10]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:52:23] it's a good thing [15:52:23]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:52:26] pws started signing git tags recently. [15:52:26]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:52:26] so people won't do it by mistake. [15:52:26]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:52:35] no, it's not [15:52:35]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:52:38] it's a bug in the completion [15:52:38]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:52:50] well, I like that "feature". [15:52:50]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:53:26] well, it'll be fixed eventually [15:53:26]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:53:39] don't rush it ;) [15:53:39]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:53:39] you can set the ignore-patterns style if you like it the way it is [15:53:39]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:54:07] ^7heo, I have a list of completion buglets longer than backscroll [15:54:07]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:54:09] I wish I could grep -rni over ftp [15:54:09]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:54:24] unfortunately the only way is to download the whole dir and grep locally [15:54:24]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:54:25] I usually ssh over and grep there, when I can [15:54:25]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:54:30] sure [15:54:30]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:54:38] but that's a very basic ftp server with nothing else [15:54:38]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:54:49] so, zfget it will be [15:54:49]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:55:20] btw, danielsh, did you ever write danielsh? [15:55:20]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:55:36] because I would be amused to execute /bin/danielsh [15:55:36]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	llua	[15:56:27] s/niel// [15:56:27]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:56:49] <phy1729> danielsh is actually a complex shellcode exploit that became sentient [15:56:49]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:56:49] nah, that one smells. [15:56:49]

2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:57:21] btw, is it normal that zfls returns "Options: -a" in the list? [15:57:21]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:57:59] and if yes, is it usual to filter the output of zfls with sed '/^Options: /d'? [15:57:59]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:58:29] oh it's printed to stderr [15:58:29]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:58:45] I see, sorry for the noise. [15:58:45]

2016-09-21 14:02:48	thrig	echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}\007"  works fine for me
2016-09-21 14:02:50	Aelius	So that works without dvtm, but not within dvtm
2016-09-21 14:03:10	thrig	is the terminal disallowing control sequences?
2016-09-21 14:04:02	Aelius	good question. I use st
2016-09-21 14:05:45	Aelius	I think it must allow control sequences, because like I said it works when I run it within the terminal, thrig, only the variables are not expanded
2016-09-21 14:06:36	Aelius	this works without dvtm: precmd() { eval 'echo -n "\033]0;$USER $PWD\007"' }
2016-09-21 14:06:56	Aelius	it gets expanded properly and all that
2016-09-21 14:07:04	Aelius	but dvtm swallows it somehow
2016-09-21 14:09:26	llua	why the pointless eval?
2016-09-21 14:10:41	Aelius	no reason. saw it in an example somewhere and figured there was a reason for it
2016-09-21 14:10:41		[14:10]
2016-09-21 14:10:56	Aelius	doesnt work with or without the eval

2016-09-21 19:07:02	^7heo	[15:52:23] it's a good thing [15:52:23]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	danielsh	[15:52:26] pws started signing git tags recently. [15:52:26]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:52:26] so people won't do it by mistake. [15:52:26]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	danielsh	[15:52:35] no, it's not [15:52:35]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	danielsh	[15:52:38] it's a bug in the completion [15:52:38]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:52:50] well, I like that "feature". [15:52:50]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	danielsh	[15:53:26] well, it'll be fixed eventually [15:53:26]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:53:39] don't rush it ;) [15:53:39]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	danielsh	[15:53:39] you can set the ignore-patterns style if you like it the way it is [15:53:39]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	danielsh	[15:54:07] ^7heo, I have a list of completion buglets longer than backscroll [15:54:07]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:54:09] I wish I could grep -rni over ftp [15:54:09]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:54:24] unfortunately the only way is to download the whole dir and grep locally [15:54:24]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	danielsh	[15:54:25] I usually ssh over and grep there, when I can [15:54:25]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:54:30] sure [15:54:30]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:54:38] but that's a very basic ftp server with nothing else [15:54:38]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:54:49] so, zfget it will be [15:54:49]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:55:20] btw, danielsh, did you ever write danielsh? [15:55:20]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:55:36] because I would be amused to execute /bin/danielsh [15:55:36]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	llua	[15:56:27] s/niel// [15:56:27]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	danielsh	[15:56:49] <phy1729> danielsh is actually a complex shellcode exploit that became sentient [15:56:49]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:56:49] nah, that one smells. [15:56:49]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:57:01] meh [15:57:01]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:57:21] btw, is it normal that zfls returns "Options: -a" in the list? [15:57:21]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:57:59] and if yes, is it usual to filter the output of zfls with sed '/^Options: /d'? [15:57:59]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:58:29] oh it's printed to stderr [15:58:29]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:58:45] I see, sorry for the noise. [15:58:45]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[23:46:51] hello! I cannot get this to work with zsh https://github.com/martanne/dvtm#how-to-set-the-window-title [23:46:51]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[23:47:36] there are two issues: nothing happesn if I put it in my zshrc [23:47:36]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[23:47:47] if I run it from the terminal, it doesnt expand variables [23:47:47]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[23:48:14] echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}\007" [23:48:14]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[23:48:21] literally prints ${USER} [23:48:21]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	larryv	[23:51:48] > echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}\007" [23:51:48]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	machabot	[23:51:48] larryv: ]0;macha% [23:51:48]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	larryv	[23:51:58] hm [23:51:58]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	larryv	[23:55:14] anyway what did you put in your .zshrc [23:55:14]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:01:13] tried a lot of variationprecmd() { echo -n "\033]0;$USER\007" } [00:01:13]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:01:19] various on: [00:01:19]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:01:27] larryv [00:01:27]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	thrig	[00:02:48] echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}\007"  works fine for me [00:02:48]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:02:50] So that works without dvtm, but not within dvtm [00:02:50]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	thrig	[00:03:10] is the terminal disallowing control sequences? [00:03:10]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:04:02] good question. I use st [00:04:02]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:05:45] I think it must allow control sequences, because like I said it works when I run it within the terminal, thrig, only the variables are not expanded [00:05:45]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:06:36] this works without dvtm: precmd() { eval 'echo -n "\033]0;$USER $PWD\007"' } [00:06:36]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:06:56] it gets expanded properly and all that [00:06:56]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:07:04] but dvtm swallows it somehow [00:07:04]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	llua	[00:09:26] why the pointless eval? [00:09:26]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:10:41] no reason. saw it in an example somewhere and figured there was a reason for it [00:10:41]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:10:56] doesnt work with or without the eval [00:10:56]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[01:11:55] I have come to the conclusion that dvtm's window title functionality is horribly broken [01:11:55]

2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:52:50] well, I like that "feature". [15:52:50]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	danielsh	[15:53:26] well, it'll be fixed eventually [15:53:26]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:53:39] don't rush it ;) [15:53:39]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	danielsh	[15:53:39] you can set the ignore-patterns style if you like it the way it is [15:53:39]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	danielsh	[15:54:07] ^7heo, I have a list of completion buglets longer than backscroll [15:54:07]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:54:09] I wish I could grep -rni over ftp [15:54:09]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:54:24] unfortunately the only way is to download the whole dir and grep locally [15:54:24]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	danielsh	[15:54:25] I usually ssh over and grep there, when I can [15:54:25]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:54:30] sure [15:54:30]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:54:38] but that's a very basic ftp server with nothing else [15:54:38]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:54:49] so, zfget it will be [15:54:49]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:55:20] btw, danielsh, did you ever write danielsh? [15:55:20]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:55:36] because I would be amused to execute /bin/danielsh [15:55:36]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	llua	[15:56:27] s/niel// [15:56:27]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	danielsh	[15:56:49] <phy1729> danielsh is actually a complex shellcode exploit that became sentient [15:56:49]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:56:49] nah, that one smells. [15:56:49]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:57:01] meh [15:57:01]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:57:21] btw, is it normal that zfls returns "Options: -a" in the list? [15:57:21]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:57:59] and if yes, is it usual to filter the output of zfls with sed '/^Options: /d'? [15:57:59]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:58:29] oh it's printed to stderr [15:58:29]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:58:45] I see, sorry for the noise. [15:58:45]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[23:46:51] hello! I cannot get this to work with zsh https://github.com/martanne/dvtm#how-to-set-the-window-title [23:46:51]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[23:47:36] there are two issues: nothing happesn if I put it in my zshrc [23:47:36]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[23:47:47] if I run it from the terminal, it doesnt expand variables [23:47:47]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[23:48:14] echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}\007" [23:48:14]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[23:48:21] literally prints ${USER} [23:48:21]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	larryv	[23:51:48] > echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}\007" [23:51:48]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	machabot	[23:51:48] larryv: ]0;macha% [23:51:48]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	larryv	[23:51:58] hm [23:51:58]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	larryv	[23:55:14] anyway what did you put in your .zshrc [23:55:14]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:01:13] tried a lot of variationprecmd() { echo -n "\033]0;$USER\007" } [00:01:13]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:01:19] various on: [00:01:19]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:01:27] larryv [00:01:27]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	thrig	[00:02:48] echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}\007"  works fine for me [00:02:48]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:02:50] So that works without dvtm, but not within dvtm [00:02:50]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	thrig	[00:03:10] is the terminal disallowing control sequences? [00:03:10]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:04:02] good question. I use st [00:04:02]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:05:45] I think it must allow control sequences, because like I said it works when I run it within the terminal, thrig, only the variables are not expanded [00:05:45]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:06:36] this works without dvtm: precmd() { eval 'echo -n "\033]0;$USER $PWD\007"' } [00:06:36]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:06:56] it gets expanded properly and all that [00:06:56]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:07:04] but dvtm swallows it somehow [00:07:04]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	llua	[00:09:26] why the pointless eval? [00:09:26]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:10:41] no reason. saw it in an example somewhere and figured there was a reason for it [00:10:41]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:10:56] doesnt work with or without the eval [00:10:56]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[01:11:55] I have come to the conclusion that dvtm's window title functionality is horribly broken [01:11:55]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	psprint	[05:52:18] Huh, (r: :: :) trimms when the length of padded text is larger than requested pad [05:52:18]

2016-09-23 12:21:12	danielsh	[16:28:38] .txt is the one thing that works almost everywhere [16:28:38]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Mikachu	[16:28:39] it takes 9 clicks and a custom extension to view a text attachment in gmail with firefox [16:28:39]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Mikachu	[16:28:49] but you can preview a pdf with one click [16:28:49]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	danielsh	[16:29:20] Mikachu, a text attachment with text/ MIME type or with application/octet-stream MIME type? [16:29:20]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Mikachu	[16:31:41] yeah [16:31:41]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:31:45] any midnight commander users here? i store my aliases in /etc/zsh/zlogin. in mc, i notice my aliases use those specified in /etc/zsh/zshrc ; any solutions to suggest? i prefer to use zlogin because the file is empty initially so i can easily store my 'global' customizations [16:31:45]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Mikachu	[16:31:46] it's possible text/plain is easier [16:31:46]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Mikachu	[16:31:52] but it refuses to show text/x-patch or whatever too [16:31:52]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	danielsh	[16:33:15] biax, zshenv is read by non-interactive shells too...   I guess mc picks them up through calling system(3) [16:33:15]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	danielsh	[16:33:34] You may be able to put a if [[ -o interactive ]] in zhenv. [16:33:34]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	psprint	[16:35:07] biax: apparently MC doesn't call zsh with "-l" option, i.e. runs non-login shell [16:35:07]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Mikachu	[16:35:37] zlogin/zprofile is definitely the wrong place for aliases [16:35:37]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	phy1729	[16:35:58] Why is your zshrc not initially empty? [16:35:58]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Mikachu	[16:36:10] whose? [16:36:10]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	phy1729	[16:36:29] biax: Wait why are you using the system wide configuration? [16:36:29]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:39:50] phy1729: how do you suggest i store my settings system wide? my settings are mostly aliases and some simple password generation functions [16:39:50]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:39:54] ill show you [16:39:54]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	phy1729	[16:40:20] Why do they need to be system wide? [16:40:20]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:40:39] phy1729: https://bpaste.net/show/cc509ddba028 [16:40:39]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:40:43] where would you store these? [16:40:43]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:41:03] because i want other users to have the same aliases [16:41:03]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	phy1729	[16:41:31] I would greatly dislike to be on one of your boxes :) [16:41:31]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	phy1729	[16:41:42] I'd put them in ~/.zshrc [16:41:42]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:41:43] im the only user in my box [16:41:43]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:41:50] i need to use other users at times [16:41:50]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:42:01] other logins. [16:42:01]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	phy1729	[16:44:38] I'd suggest becoming better acquanted with sudo; but if they really must be systemwide, /etc/zsh/zshrc is the right place to put them [16:44:38]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	thrig	[16:45:14] how to annoy other users on the system in one easy step [16:45:14]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	phy1729	[16:45:24] he's the only person [16:45:24]

2016-09-23 12:21:12	Mikachu	[16:46:45] how to get annoyed when package updates and deletes your aliases [16:46:45]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	thrig	[16:47:09] no vendor would be so clumsy with their updates! [16:47:09]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	phy1729	[16:47:14] How to choose a saner distro [16:47:14]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:48:46] phy1729: would you say a reasonable workaround to have a clean customization for myself is to add ". /etc/zsh/mycustomizations" ? [16:48:46]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:48:59] perhaps add that to the bottom of /etc/zsh/zshrc ? [16:48:59]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	mSSM	[18:24:34] Trying to figure out how to make tab-completion expand to a hostname alias I have in .ssh/config. In there, I have a Host foobar, which points to foobar.long.address.tld. [18:24:34]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	mSSM	[18:24:52] Now, when I do $ ssh foo<tab>, it expands to $ ssh foobar.long.address.tld [18:24:52]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	mSSM	[18:25:07] I would want it to only expand to $ ssh foobar [18:25:07]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	thrig	[18:25:28] I put the hosts I want completed in ~/.hosts, and then zstyle -e ':completion:*' hosts 'reply=($(< ~/.hosts))' [18:25:28]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	mSSM	[18:27:24] thrig: I guess that's one way, I will look into it. Thanks [18:27:24]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	mSSM	[18:27:56] I was looking at /usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion/Unix/_ssh, and there is some reference to the ssh config, so I guess it looks there. But the file is a bit verbose to easily understand it...... [18:27:56]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	danielsh	[18:43:20] mSSM, what you want is already done by default [18:43:20]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	mSSM	[18:46:17] danielsh: Then something is borked here, I guess ;( [18:46:17]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	mSSM	[18:46:55] danielsh: As I wrote, for me it expands to the full address, not just to the Host alias in the .ssh/conf [18:46:55]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	mSSM	[18:50:14] danielsh: Alright, I just tried giving it a different Host. If I rename it from foobar to barfoo and leave everything else the same, then $ ssh bar<tab> expands to $ ssh barfoo [18:50:14]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	mSSM	[18:51:41] So it looks like the issue is with me naming the Host foobar, and having it's hostname start with foobar. It then prefers to expands to the full Hostname [18:51:41]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	lothric	[18:52:47] Hi, is there a difference between matcher-list '' 'm:{[:lower:][:upper:]}={[:upper:][:lower:]} and matcher-list '' 'm:{a-z}={A-Z}' 'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z} ? [18:52:47]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	FoH	[19:57:54] lothric. from what i've read about other things that can use [:lower:] and [:upper:], they will also work for non ASCII-compatible locales [19:57:54]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	FoH	[20:00:23] apparently, for some locales, z is in the middle of the alphabet, so [a-z] only matches half the letters [20:00:23]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	danielsh	[20:13:06] (so: set LC_COLLATE=C) [20:13:06]
