2016-09-15 20:37:21	psprint	that's what can be called "slightly", i.e. not much, traded for robustness
2016-09-15 20:39:49	danielsh	the idiom with [ is      [ x"foo" = x"bar" ] with the 'x' in front
2016-09-15 20:40:03	danielsh	in zsh you'd usually use [[ though.
2016-09-15 20:40:18	psprint	hmm, when will [ cause problems?

2016-09-15 20:41:47	danielsh	other question, what's an easy way to strip leading/trailing whitespace from a variable?
2016-09-15 20:41:53	danielsh	(actually: from each element of an array)
2016-09-15 20:42:59	Mikachu	a=('  hi ' '  h ello '); echo ${${a# #}% #}

2016-09-15 20:43:17	Mikachu	that could have worked, in theory

2016-09-15 20:44:13	danielsh	thanks - I was hoping for something simpler, eg python has foo.strip() for this.
2016-09-15 20:44:13	Mikachu	> a=('  hi ' '  h ello '); echo ${${a## #}%% #}
2016-09-15 20:44:14	machabot	Mikachu: hi h ello
2016-09-15 20:44:21	Mikachu	i forgot # % is shortest possible match
2016-09-15 20:45:20	psprint	just a drop in from my code: cmd="${cmd##[[:space:]]#}" cmd="${cmd%%[[:space:]]#}"   AFAIR [[:space:]] has those unicode spaces (if it's not [[:blank:]], but rather not.. If I'm not confusing this with vim right now.. but easy to check..)
2016-09-15 20:46:47	danielsh	thanks psprint

2016-09-16 20:51:32	psprint	a=my, myvar${a}=1 doesn't work, such namespacing can be done only via (P) probably?
2016-09-16 20:53:18	Mikachu	to some degree you can also use typeset
2016-09-16 20:53:27	Mikachu	> a=my; typeset $a=hello; echo $my
2016-09-16 20:53:28	machabot	Mikachu: hello
2016-09-16 20:54:28	llua	associative arrays are normally used for this kind of stuff
2016-09-16 20:55:24	danielsh	«parameters[$x]=y» doesn't do it either.
2016-09-16 20:56:12	psprint	thanks
2016-09-16 20:57:34	psprint	I could flood set's output etc. with separate variables, better to migrate to hash
2016-09-16 20:58:16	danielsh	assocs show in `set` too
2016-09-16 21:03:41	psprint	ah right, so will use -h for this
2016-09-16 21:03:41		[21:03]
2016-09-16 21:04:30	psprint	or rather -H

2016-09-16 21:10:12	danielsh	(these are intended for variables where restoring the value doesn't make sense)

2016-09-17 02:24:34	ahacker	I have a small problem, more like an annoyance. As we all know zsh has "command/filename correction" usually in case we mispell or mistype something. however, when i use mv sometimes the new filename is one number off from similar names in the same directory. Is there a way to ommit any instance of mv from the correction checking?
2016-09-17 02:24:49	Mikachu	alias mv=nocorrect\ mv
2016-09-17 02:25:03	Mikachu	i personally would recommend to not use the correctall setting though
2016-09-17 02:25:25	Mikachu	since in the normal case any existing filename on the commandline will have been produced by tabcompletion anyway
2016-09-17 02:25:34	ahacker	and i can just put that in my .zshrc
2016-09-17 02:25:38	ahacker	hmmm, ok
2016-09-17 02:25:42	ahacker	good to know
2016-09-17 02:25:42	Mikachu	you sure can
2016-09-17 02:25:52	Mikachu	i mean, do you type out long filenames without pressing tab?
2016-09-17 02:26:08	ahacker	no
2016-09-17 02:29:13	ahacker	so i can still tab complete, with this alias it just won't try and correct me with a filename that already exists?
2016-09-17 02:29:31	ahacker	I don't want to accidenty overwrite data
2016-09-17 02:31:23	Mikachu	well
2016-09-17 02:31:33	Mikachu	if you want to be really careful you can do alias mv='nocorrect mv -i'
2016-09-17 02:31:44	Mikachu	and mv will also ask you if you're crazy if you give an existing filename, and zsh won't suggest them
2016-09-17 02:35:41	osse	no matter how l33t you are you're allowed to open a file manager two times a year

2016-09-17 02:37:23	veverak	hi folks, I recently switched to zsh as my primary shell and notice one ... problem
2016-09-17 02:37:51	veverak	when I ssh into customers servers (which are using bash and can't be changed) and try to open vim
2016-09-17 02:38:12	veverak	I don't see proper syntax hilighting, like... colors won't change at all and just some things are underlined
2016-09-17 02:38:28	veverak	any tips what to google to get rid of this problem?
2016-09-17 02:38:31	danielsh	check your $TERM value
2016-09-17 02:38:40	osse	it's unlikely that zsh influences that
2016-09-17 02:38:48	osse	unless you use(d) to set TERM in zshrc or bashrc
2016-09-17 02:39:04	danielsh	osse, $TERM propagate over ssh.
2016-09-17 02:39:28	Mikachu	setting TERM in your shell init files is wrong
2016-09-17 02:39:31	danielsh	... so that theory accounts for one mystery here.
2016-09-17 02:39:45	scp1	sendenv TERM=nogood

2016-09-17 02:39:57	danielsh	veverak, is the value different between bash and zsh
2016-09-17 02:40:00	danielsh	?
2016-09-17 02:40:08	veverak	yep
2016-09-17 02:40:13	veverak	bash got xterm-256color
2016-09-17 02:40:24	scp1	veverak, it's likely there's no terminfo for that terminal on your customers server
2016-09-17 02:40:40	Mikachu	you must be doing something incredibly wrong for that to happen
2016-09-17 02:40:55	veverak	hmm
2016-09-17 02:40:58	veverak	manually changed it
2016-09-17 02:41:00	veverak	and now it works
2016-09-17 02:41:02	veverak	scp1: yep
2016-09-17 02:41:19	veverak	thanks!
2016-09-17 02:41:23	scp1	veverak, add sendenv TERM=xterm-256color to your .ssh/config section
2016-09-17 02:41:25	danielsh	veverak, that'll be $5, non-consecutive used bank notes

2016-09-17 02:44:26	osse	danielsh: yes, I know. my guess is that he sets it in .bashrc but not .zshrc
2016-09-17 02:44:40	veverak	osse: it was not in .bashrc
2016-09-17 02:44:45	veverak	nor the /etc/bash.bashrc
2016-09-17 02:44:54	Mikachu	do you use xterm or urxvt?
2016-09-17 02:45:01	veverak	urxvt
2016-09-17 02:45:16	Mikachu	then it's surprising that the xterm value works better
2016-09-17 02:45:42	veverak	true
2016-09-17 02:45:55	japh	mikachu, missing terminfo on server
2016-09-17 02:46:03	danielsh	by the way, what's that character on veverak 's RPS1?  It looks like a Sigma in hexchat and like <b2> in my terminal
2016-09-17 02:46:25	veverak	error code showed by powershell
2016-09-17 02:46:39	veverak	it should be 'left arrow'

2016-09-17 16:04:59	Mikachu	you're maybe a bit confused about what's happening here
2016-09-17 16:05:08	Mikachu	zsh supports tying a scalar parameter to an array parameter
2016-09-17 16:05:16	Mikachu	$path is the array, and $PATH is scalar (separated by colons)
2016-09-17 16:05:34	Celmor	I want to set $path but it causes it no longer to find programs in $PATH
2016-09-17 16:05:37	Mikachu	there's no case insensitivity going on
2016-09-17 16:05:42	Mikachu	use another parameter name

2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:01:38] why is zsh not differentiating between $path and $PATH? [02:01:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Mikachu	[02:01:46] yes [02:01:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:03:50] how do I enable case-sensitivity for variable names? [02:03:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Mikachu	[02:04:59] you're maybe a bit confused about what's happening here [02:04:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Mikachu	[02:05:08] zsh supports tying a scalar parameter to an array parameter [02:05:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Mikachu	[02:05:16] $path is the array, and $PATH is scalar (separated by colons) [02:05:16]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:05:34] I want to set $path but it causes it no longer to find programs in $PATH [02:05:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Mikachu	[02:05:37] there's no case insensitivity going on [02:05:37]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Mikachu	[02:05:42] use another parameter name [02:05:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:06:27] how do I disable there also being an array? does there have to be this functionality? [02:06:27]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:06:49] I have scripts that use $path, would be a shame if all of them don't work anymor [02:06:49]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:09:21] can I get the default POSIX behaviour of ^u? what function would that behaviour be called in zsh? [02:09:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	llua	[02:12:11] there is no posix behaviour for u, so describe what you expect [02:12:11]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:13:58] then bash behavior [02:13:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	llua	[02:14:12] and that behavior is? [02:14:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:14:17] most shells I work with work like bash do as in yanking from cursor to beginning of prompt [02:14:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:14:43] zsh just discards the whole line [02:14:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	larryv	[02:16:43] backward-kill-line [02:16:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:17:07] does it also tank it so I can paste it with ^y ? [02:17:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:17:11] yank* [02:17:11]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	llua	[02:17:40] yes [02:17:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:22:04] thanks, got it working [02:22:04]

2016-09-18 11:35:14	ft	Since we have to guess, I'm going for screwed up value in $TERM (either inside or outside of tmux) or screwed up value in $PS1.
2016-09-18 11:35:56	bryz	This is "out of the box" oh-my-zsh and tmux
2016-09-18 11:36:12	bryz	It's fine outside of tmux btw
2016-09-18 11:36:37	ft	Since omz is known for its quality code.
2016-09-18 11:37:13	ft	What's the value of $TERM inside and outside of tmux?

2016-09-18 11:42:14	ft	omz is just a set of configuration files for zsh. And they caused lots of trouble in here. It's usually: "Do you have a weird problem nobody else has?" "Yeah, and I'm using omz."
2016-09-18 11:42:48	bryz	ah, im getting some results not that i'm searching for omz

2016-09-18 11:44:17	machabot	"omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the channel #oh-my-zsh.

2016-09-18 13:24:38	bryz	[21:40:52] I've just been searching for "zsh" [21:40:52]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:42:14] omz is just a set of configuration files for zsh. And they caused lots of trouble in here. It's usually: "Do you have a weird problem nobody else has?" "Yeah, and I'm using omz." [21:42:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	bryz	[21:42:48] ah, im getting some results not that i'm searching for omz [21:42:48]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	bryz	[21:43:07] now* - thanks for the help [21:43:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:43:33] Could be a tmux problem too. I have no idea how they implement the graphic characters. Maybe they are multi-character wide and something goes wrong with counting. I don't know. [21:43:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:43:54] You're welcome, and good luck. [21:43:54]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	chris2	[21:44:17] !omz [21:44:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	machabot	[21:44:17] "omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the channel #oh-my-zsh. [21:44:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:45:12] chris2: Thanks! I thought they had their own channel, but couldn't remember. [21:45:12]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	 *	chris2 [21:46:26] just checked if there are even people in there :P [21:46:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:46:53] chris2: And the result? :) [21:46:53]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	chris2	[21:47:09] 28 [21:47:09]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:47:37] That's fair. I remember when this channel had about that number of users. :) [21:47:37]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	chris2	[21:48:07] i didnt realize its 400+ now... [21:48:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:48:14] Yes. Crazy. :) [21:48:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	chris2	[21:48:26] felt like 120 perhaps :P [21:48:26]

2016-09-19 02:44:07	Magnetz74	[04:30:18] In default zsh is l not ls -l? [04:30:18]

2016-09-19 15:52:54	voxadam	If I want to reference the XDG directories ($XDG_DATA_HOME, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, etc.) in my zshrc do I need to define them in my zshenv?

2016-09-19 16:06:00		[16:00]
2016-09-19 16:07:22	voxadam	I'm in the process of refactoring my dotfiles with one of the primary goals to clean up my home directory by coaxing as may programs as possible to store their config, runtime, cache, and other files in the applicable XDG base directory. I was thinking that it probably makes sense to all the $XDG_* variables in my zshenv file but I was curious what other people would recommend.
2016-09-19 16:08:21	Mikachu	usually you would set environment variables in zprofile or whatever file gets sourced by your environment when you log in
2016-09-19 16:08:28	Mikachu	they then get inherited normally by all child processes
2016-09-19 16:08:41	Mikachu	if you put it in zshenv, whatever is in the environment gets overridden by the default in every new zsh process
2016-09-19 16:08:52	Mikachu	also
2016-09-19 16:09:09	Mikachu	the default for anything that follows the XDG spec is already to use the correct directories
2016-09-19 16:09:15	Mikachu	so setting them to their defaults is not really helpful in any way
2016-09-19 16:09:26	voxadam	That's good to know. zprofile or zlogin makes much more sense.
2016-09-19 16:10:05	Mikachu	ie, according to the spec when you want to use an xdg directory the way to do it is something like do_stuff ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share} or whatever
2016-09-19 16:10:37	voxadam	I reference variables like $XDG_CONFIG_HOME in my zshrc and shell scripts so the variables need to be exported.
2016-09-19 16:10:50	Mikachu	you shouldn't depend on them being set
2016-09-19 16:11:14	voxadam	You make a good point.
2016-09-19 16:11:17	Mikachu	"If $XDG_DATA_HOME is either not set or empty, a default equal to $HOME/.local/share should be used."
2016-09-19 16:11:20	Mikachu	and same for all the others

2016-09-19 16:12:24	voxadam	One issue is that I use my dotfiles on multiple machines. Sometimes on machines that don't use Freedesktop specs (e.g. MacOS).

2016-09-19 16:12:41	voxadam	I'm doing what I can to make my conf files as portable as possible.
2016-09-19 16:12:51	Mikachu	well
2016-09-19 16:12:56	Mikachu	if your scripts use the spec
2016-09-19 16:13:05	Mikachu	then you can set XDG_DATA_HOME to whatever directory you want that script to use on macos
2016-09-19 16:13:14	Mikachu	in your zprofile or equivalent there
2016-09-19 16:13:26	Mikachu	that's the whole point
2016-09-19 16:13:28	Mikachu	kinda
2016-09-19 16:13:49	voxadam	I'll go ahead define them in zprofile.
2016-09-19 16:13:56	voxadam	Thanks for the advice.
2016-09-19 16:14:11	Mikachu	you should make sure your scripts work with or without them set though~
2016-09-19 16:14:27	 *	voxadam shutters at the thought of unit testing his dotfiles.
2016-09-19 16:14:33	voxadam	:)
2016-09-19 16:14:59	Mikachu	well, when you say 'script' i am thinking something more standalone from dotfiles

2016-09-19 16:18:07	voxadam	I suppose I'll still need to set $ZDOTDIR to ~/.config/zsh in my zshenv if I feel like keeping all my zsh related confs with everything else.

2016-09-19 16:21:40	voxadam	Interesting, I just learned about NO_GLOBAL_RCS. I can imagine that being useful for a Type-A controlling personality such as myself.
2016-09-19 16:21:40		[16:21]
2016-09-19 16:23:44	Mikachu	depends on how bad your distro is
2016-09-19 16:23:50	Mikachu	just keep in mind /etc/zshenv will always be sourced
2016-09-19 16:24:02	voxadam	Makes sense.
2016-09-19 16:24:03	Mikachu	and yeah, you also always need a ~/.zshenv to set up ZDOTDIR
2016-09-19 16:24:45	voxadam	Some people define a lot using zshenv.

2016-09-19 16:26:38	Mikachu	that makes me cry...
2016-09-19 16:27:19	voxadam	That bad?
2016-09-19 16:28:02	Mikachu	well, it's putting zsh parameters into the environment for no reason, overriding inherited $PATH, ...
2016-09-19 16:28:34	voxadam	It's a tad excessive.

2016-09-20 00:39:08	machabot	[21:11:52] llua: \there should be two slashes [21:11:52]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	llua	[21:12:15] but `` noms one [21:12:15]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Sasazuka	[22:05:15] sorry stepped away a bit, instead of using IFS, I would need to know how many lines there are right? do I just use "wc -l" on it to find out or is there some other way? [22:05:15]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Sasazuka	[22:09:55] ah nevermind I just read the doc on it [22:09:55]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	llua	[22:11:58] you use ${(f)"$(docker ps --format "{{.ID}};{{.Names}};{{.Image}};{{.Ports}}")"} [22:11:58]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	llua	[22:12:03] as-is [22:12:03]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Sasazuka	[22:13:49] it seems to treat it as a single element [22:13:49]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Sasazuka	[22:15:14] ah I see, I needed to use () or just use it without var [22:15:14]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[01:52:54] If I want to reference the XDG directories ($XDG_DATA_HOME, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, etc.) in my zshrc do I need to define them in my zshenv? [01:52:54]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:07:22] I'm in the process of refactoring my dotfiles with one of the primary goals to clean up my home directory by coaxing as may programs as possible to store their config, runtime, cache, and other files in the applicable XDG base directory. I was thinking that it probably makes sense to all the $XDG_* variables in my zshenv file but I was curious what other people would recommend. [02:07:22]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:08:21] usually you would set environment variables in zprofile or whatever file gets sourced by your environment when you log in [02:08:21]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:08:28] they then get inherited normally by all child processes [02:08:28]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:08:41] if you put it in zshenv, whatever is in the environment gets overridden by the default in every new zsh process [02:08:41]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:08:52] also [02:08:52]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:09:09] the default for anything that follows the XDG spec is already to use the correct directories [02:09:09]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:09:15] so setting them to their defaults is not really helpful in any way [02:09:15]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:09:26] That's good to know. zprofile or zlogin makes much more sense. [02:09:26]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:10:05] ie, according to the spec when you want to use an xdg directory the way to do it is something like do_stuff ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share} or whatever [02:10:05]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:10:37] I reference variables like $XDG_CONFIG_HOME in my zshrc and shell scripts so the variables need to be exported. [02:10:37]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:10:50] you shouldn't depend on them being set [02:10:50]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:11:14] You make a good point. [02:11:14]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:11:17] "If $XDG_DATA_HOME is either not set or empty, a default equal to $HOME/.local/share should be used." [02:11:17]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:11:20] and same for all the others [02:11:20]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:12:24] One issue is that I use my dotfiles on multiple machines. Sometimes on machines that don't use Freedesktop specs (e.g. MacOS). [02:12:24]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:12:41] I'm doing what I can to make my conf files as portable as possible. [02:12:41]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:12:51] well [02:12:51]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:12:56] if your scripts use the spec [02:12:56]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:13:05] then you can set XDG_DATA_HOME to whatever directory you want that script to use on macos [02:13:05]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:13:14] in your zprofile or equivalent there [02:13:14]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:13:26] that's the whole point [02:13:26]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:13:28] kinda [02:13:28]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:13:49] I'll go ahead define them in zprofile. [02:13:49]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:13:56] Thanks for the advice. [02:13:56]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:14:11] you should make sure your scripts work with or without them set though~ [02:14:11]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	 *	voxadam [02:14:27] shutters at the thought of unit testing his dotfiles. [02:14:27]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:14:33] :) [02:14:33]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:14:59] well, when you say 'script' i am thinking something more standalone from dotfiles [02:14:59]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:18:07] I suppose I'll still need to set $ZDOTDIR to ~/.config/zsh in my zshenv if I feel like keeping all my zsh related confs with everything else. [02:18:07]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:21:39] Interesting, I just learned about NO_GLOBAL_RCS. I can imagine that being useful for a Type-A controlling personality such as myself. [02:21:39]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:23:44] depends on how bad your distro is [02:23:44]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:23:50] just keep in mind /etc/zshenv will always be sourced [02:23:50]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:24:02] Makes sense. [02:24:02]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:24:03] and yeah, you also always need a ~/.zshenv to set up ZDOTDIR [02:24:03]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:24:45] Some people define a lot using zshenv. [02:24:45]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:25:14] the name is a bit misleading... [02:25:14]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:26:11] For example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pschmitt/zsh-config/master/.zshenv [02:26:11]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:26:37] that makes me cry... [02:26:37]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:27:19] That bad? [02:27:19]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	Mikachu	[02:28:02] well, it's putting zsh parameters into the environment for no reason, overriding inherited $PATH, ... [02:28:02]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	voxadam	[02:28:34] It's a tad excessive. [02:28:34]

2016-09-20 18:53:19	danielsh	[14:07:00] "do one thing and do it well" and all that ;) [14:07:00]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	ascii-soup	[14:07:45] did you mean to leave me hanging here? [14:07:45]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	ascii-soup	[14:07:47] what's the second feature? [14:07:47]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	 *	ascii-soup [14:07:53] is on the edge of his seat [14:07:53]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	psprint	[14:08:07] ok I reveal what it'll be: at alternate screen (Zcurses) there will be statistical data for the Current Project: last 2-3 commits, list of modified files, thinking about others. And hopefully a way to switch between last active project. And maybe interface to ag, the ack written in C, but unsure [14:08:07]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	ascii-soup	[14:08:35] ...! [14:08:35]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	ascii-soup	[14:08:40] Awesome [14:08:40]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	psprint	[14:11:30] yeah thinking that too and it hurts my mind, hard to focus on this [14:11:30]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	thebope	[14:40:20] I have an alias in my .zshrc 'alias vmc="v $(g diff --name-only --diff-filter=U)"', but it appears to be running every time i load a new terminal? I get [14:40:20]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	thebope	[14:40:31] Not a git repository [14:40:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	thebope	[14:40:58] For the record that expands out to vim $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U) [14:40:58]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	thebope	[14:41:26] I enjoy the alias but i don't want it to run every time I open a terminal [14:41:26]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	thebope	[14:41:33] Is there a way to do that? [14:41:33]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	chris2	[14:41:52] use ' not " [14:41:52]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	chris2	[14:42:00] with " the $() is run at parse time [14:42:00]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	chris2	[14:42:24] or do it right and define a function :) [14:42:24]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	 *	danielsh [14:44:18] uses git ls-files --unmerged -z and vim +/'^<<<<<<' [14:44:18]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	thebope	[14:47:32] Thanks chris2 [14:47:32]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	thebope	[14:47:39] yea I defined my first function last night, was nice [14:47:39]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	danielsh	[16:24:15] Completion/Darwin/Type/_retrieve_mac_apps has ":completion:*:*:$service:commands". [16:24:15]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	danielsh	[16:24:29] I assume that needs braces. [16:24:29]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	wtiger	[19:33:41] Hi! [19:33:41]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	wtiger	[19:34:03] can zsh interpret bash commands as well? [19:34:03]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	thrig	[19:34:55] yes. no. maybe. [19:34:55]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	wtiger	[19:35:19] how so? [19:35:19]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	larryv	[19:39:09] it can interpret any bash commands that are valid zsh syntax [19:39:09]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	larryv	[19:39:17] doesn't necessarily mean it'll behave the same [19:39:17]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	wtiger	[19:39:55] ok, if I send in bash syntax and expect bash like behavior? [19:39:55]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	wtiger	[19:40:04] can that be done? [19:40:04]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	wtiger	[19:42:13] something like <backward-compatibility>? [19:42:13]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	phy1729	[19:49:24] If you want bash, you should really use bash. [19:49:24]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	wtiger	[19:49:35] hmm, i figure [19:49:35]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	llua	[22:06:10] danielsh: it does [22:06:10]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	danielsh	[23:12:50] llua, yes I know, I was just hoping lazyweb would commit the fix. [23:12:50]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	llua	[23:43:08] ''for word in ${words:1}; do'' [23:43:08]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	llua	[23:43:17] weeeee [23:43:17]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	llua	[23:45:27] it actually starts off at 0, TIL. [23:45:27]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	nostrora	[02:04:31] [gregoire@archlinux:~]$ zsh \[\e[1;38;5;242m\][\[\e[1;38;5;214m\]\u\[\e[1;38;5;242m\]@\[\e[1;38;5;161m\]\h\[\e[1;38;5;242m\]:\[\e[1;38;5;33m\]\W$(__git_ps1 "\[\e[1;38;5;242m\]|\[\e[1;38;5;81m\]")\[\e[1;38;5;242m\]]\[\e[0m\]$(get_prompt_symbol) [02:04:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	nostrora	[02:04:36] Why i get this ? [02:04:36]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	Mikachu	[02:04:52] because whoever wrote your .bashrc doesn't know what theyred oing [02:04:52]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	nostrora	[02:06:14] Mikachu: ow :( can i remove bashrc ? [02:06:14]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	Mikachu	[02:06:22] um [02:06:22]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	Mikachu	[02:06:33] it won't be a problem once you set up zsh [02:06:33]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	Mikachu	[02:06:49] but your bash setup shouldn't export PROMPT, just set it normally as a parameter [02:06:49]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	nostrora	[02:06:50] There is no an .zshrc ? [02:06:50]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	nostrora	[02:11:49] Hi! Where i can find a good .zshrc ? [02:11:49]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	nostrora	[02:13:27] oh my zsh is a zshrc ? [02:13:27]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	danielsh	[02:29:01] !omz [02:29:01]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	machabot	[02:29:01] "omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the channel #oh-my-zsh. [02:29:01]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	llua	[02:48:36] he be gone [02:48:36]

2016-09-21 03:07:14	Mikachu	well, there is some static variables that are used both by isearch and by the comparison functions

2016-09-21 03:19:42	psprint	I'm thinking. The variable detection is quite nice, and I guess bash hash "local" too, but other things might not match, like "float", not having energy to examine how this aligns with Bash, and it's rather important to them, if the project is alive actually
2016-09-21 03:20:11	psprint	also added cool patch to: examine Vim and Emacs modelines, last and first 5 lines, of each file with unrecognized extension or no extension and no shebang.. :]

2016-09-21 03:20:47	danielsh	psprint, I can't speak for them, but I assume the ctags zsh parser will be configured according to the zsh community's preferences, not according to parity with ${foo}sh

2016-09-21 03:21:45	danielsh	psprint, That means you have to do rebases and replants in order to shape it as a PR ...
2016-09-21 03:23:56	psprint	maybe someone has a reasonable solution to this: when to update generated ctags file so that when entering zcommodore's searcher, it's not off the wall where editor will open

2016-09-21 03:25:39	psprint	It's in POSTDISPLAY, like the history-search-multi-word, reused the code
2016-09-21 03:27:02	psprint	hm maybe besides ^O^K I'll do ^O^L to start searcher first regenerating.. It's about something reasonable for something generally unsolvable
2016-09-21 03:29:15	psprint	danielsh: looked at z-sy-h source code about the via-hash optimization, hit on _zsh_highlight_add_highlight(), any region_highlight update goes through that. I think it's a bad news and good news, bad is: where to keep index for the hash, ZSYH[rhindex] comes to my mind, but maybe it should be ZSYH_INDEX since we optimizing.. Not very confortable things

2016-09-21 05:14:22	danielsh	^7heo, thanks for the feedback.  I thought something like this needs to be added, maybe we could create a 20.2 Example section before diving into reference material.
2016-09-21 05:14:46	danielsh	^7heo, yes.
2016-09-21 05:15:52	^7heo	danielsh: yes a 20.2 section would really great.
2016-09-21 05:16:16	^7heo	danielsh: I was searching for such an example, since I already knew what was the completion function's name, and the function I have made's name too.
2016-09-21 05:16:23	^7heo	danielsh: I only needed to link to two.

2016-09-21 05:52:10	danielsh	^7heo, zftp delete $file, it seems --- even though 'delete' is missing from the completion

2016-09-21 05:52:26	danielsh	pws started signing git tags recently.
2016-09-21 05:52:26	^7heo	so people won't do it by mistake.
2016-09-21 05:52:35	danielsh	no, it's not
2016-09-21 05:52:38	danielsh	it's a bug in the completion

2016-09-21 05:53:39	danielsh	you can set the ignore-patterns style if you like it the way it is

2016-09-21 05:54:09	^7heo	I wish I could grep -rni over ftp
2016-09-21 05:54:24	^7heo	unfortunately the only way is to download the whole dir and grep locally
2016-09-21 05:54:25	danielsh	I usually ssh over and grep there, when I can
2016-09-21 05:54:30	^7heo	sure
2016-09-21 05:54:38	^7heo	but that's a very basic ftp server with nothing else

2016-09-21 12:41:38	 *	^7heo [15:06:15] is in .de [15:06:15]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	ascii-soup	[15:06:45] ;) [15:06:45]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:07:05] and it's not "really" in europe. [15:07:05]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	 *	^7heo [15:07:14] starts trolls early this week [15:07:14]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:14:22] ^7heo, thanks for the feedback.  I thought something like this needs to be added, maybe we could create a 20.2 Example section before diving into reference material. [15:14:22]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:14:46] ^7heo, yes. [15:14:46]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:15:51] danielsh: yes a 20.2 section would really great. [15:15:51]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:16:16] danielsh: I was searching for such an example, since I already knew what was the completion function's name, and the function I have made's name too. [15:16:16]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:16:23] danielsh: I only needed to link to two. [15:16:23]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:16:29] ^7heo, Maybe you could even write it :-) [15:16:29]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:41:24] danielsh: sure [15:41:24]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:41:30] danielsh: is there a place where I can submit a patch? [15:41:30]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:42:17] ^7heo, zsh-workers@zsh.org, the source of that file is Doc/Zsh/compsys.yo [15:42:17]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:42:48] ^7heo, if yodl is too high a learning curve then just send text and we'll take care or formatting it. [15:42:48]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:42:53] ^7heo, thanks! [15:42:53]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:47:47] danielsh: what RCS format for the patch? [15:47:47]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:48:08] ok git [15:48:08]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:49:07] I don't wanna troll, but sf.net aren't exactly the most reliable hosters on the planet ;) [15:49:07]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:50:01] that being said, github isn't perfect either. [15:50:01]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:51:14] any idea how to remove documents from an FTP using zftp? [15:51:14]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:51:17] *shrug* it works, and if they shutter up tomorrow we'll just move git somewhere else and move on [15:51:17]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:51:31] sure, that makes sense [15:51:31]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:51:42] I just don't trust people who alter the binaries before shipping. [15:51:42]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:52:10] ^7heo, zftp delete $file, it seems --- even though 'delete' is missing from the completion [15:52:10]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:52:23] it's a good thing [15:52:23]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:52:26] pws started signing git tags recently. [15:52:26]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:52:26] so people won't do it by mistake. [15:52:26]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:52:35] no, it's not [15:52:35]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:52:38] it's a bug in the completion [15:52:38]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:52:50] well, I like that "feature". [15:52:50]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:53:26] well, it'll be fixed eventually [15:53:26]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:53:39] don't rush it ;) [15:53:39]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:53:39] you can set the ignore-patterns style if you like it the way it is [15:53:39]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:54:07] ^7heo, I have a list of completion buglets longer than backscroll [15:54:07]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:54:09] I wish I could grep -rni over ftp [15:54:09]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:54:24] unfortunately the only way is to download the whole dir and grep locally [15:54:24]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:54:25] I usually ssh over and grep there, when I can [15:54:25]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:54:30] sure [15:54:30]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:54:38] but that's a very basic ftp server with nothing else [15:54:38]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:54:49] so, zfget it will be [15:54:49]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:55:20] btw, danielsh, did you ever write danielsh? [15:55:20]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:55:36] because I would be amused to execute /bin/danielsh [15:55:36]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	llua	[15:56:27] s/niel// [15:56:27]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	danielsh	[15:56:49] <phy1729> danielsh is actually a complex shellcode exploit that became sentient [15:56:49]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:56:49] nah, that one smells. [15:56:49]

2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:57:21] btw, is it normal that zfls returns "Options: -a" in the list? [15:57:21]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:57:59] and if yes, is it usual to filter the output of zfls with sed '/^Options: /d'? [15:57:59]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:58:29] oh it's printed to stderr [15:58:29]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	^7heo	[15:58:45] I see, sorry for the noise. [15:58:45]

2016-09-21 14:02:48	thrig	echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}\007"  works fine for me
2016-09-21 14:02:50	Aelius	So that works without dvtm, but not within dvtm
2016-09-21 14:03:10	thrig	is the terminal disallowing control sequences?
2016-09-21 14:04:02	Aelius	good question. I use st
2016-09-21 14:05:45	Aelius	I think it must allow control sequences, because like I said it works when I run it within the terminal, thrig, only the variables are not expanded
2016-09-21 14:06:36	Aelius	this works without dvtm: precmd() { eval 'echo -n "\033]0;$USER $PWD\007"' }
2016-09-21 14:06:56	Aelius	it gets expanded properly and all that
2016-09-21 14:07:04	Aelius	but dvtm swallows it somehow
2016-09-21 14:09:26	llua	why the pointless eval?
2016-09-21 14:10:41	Aelius	no reason. saw it in an example somewhere and figured there was a reason for it
2016-09-21 14:10:41		[14:10]
2016-09-21 14:10:56	Aelius	doesnt work with or without the eval

2016-09-21 19:07:02	^7heo	[15:52:23] it's a good thing [15:52:23]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	danielsh	[15:52:26] pws started signing git tags recently. [15:52:26]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:52:26] so people won't do it by mistake. [15:52:26]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	danielsh	[15:52:35] no, it's not [15:52:35]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	danielsh	[15:52:38] it's a bug in the completion [15:52:38]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:52:50] well, I like that "feature". [15:52:50]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	danielsh	[15:53:26] well, it'll be fixed eventually [15:53:26]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:53:39] don't rush it ;) [15:53:39]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	danielsh	[15:53:39] you can set the ignore-patterns style if you like it the way it is [15:53:39]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	danielsh	[15:54:07] ^7heo, I have a list of completion buglets longer than backscroll [15:54:07]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:54:09] I wish I could grep -rni over ftp [15:54:09]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:54:24] unfortunately the only way is to download the whole dir and grep locally [15:54:24]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	danielsh	[15:54:25] I usually ssh over and grep there, when I can [15:54:25]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:54:30] sure [15:54:30]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:54:38] but that's a very basic ftp server with nothing else [15:54:38]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:54:49] so, zfget it will be [15:54:49]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:55:20] btw, danielsh, did you ever write danielsh? [15:55:20]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:55:36] because I would be amused to execute /bin/danielsh [15:55:36]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	llua	[15:56:27] s/niel// [15:56:27]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	danielsh	[15:56:49] <phy1729> danielsh is actually a complex shellcode exploit that became sentient [15:56:49]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:56:49] nah, that one smells. [15:56:49]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:57:01] meh [15:57:01]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:57:21] btw, is it normal that zfls returns "Options: -a" in the list? [15:57:21]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:57:59] and if yes, is it usual to filter the output of zfls with sed '/^Options: /d'? [15:57:59]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:58:29] oh it's printed to stderr [15:58:29]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	^7heo	[15:58:45] I see, sorry for the noise. [15:58:45]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[23:46:51] hello! I cannot get this to work with zsh https://github.com/martanne/dvtm#how-to-set-the-window-title [23:46:51]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[23:47:36] there are two issues: nothing happesn if I put it in my zshrc [23:47:36]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[23:47:47] if I run it from the terminal, it doesnt expand variables [23:47:47]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[23:48:14] echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}\007" [23:48:14]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[23:48:21] literally prints ${USER} [23:48:21]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	larryv	[23:51:48] > echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}\007" [23:51:48]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	machabot	[23:51:48] larryv: ]0;macha% [23:51:48]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	larryv	[23:51:58] hm [23:51:58]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	larryv	[23:55:14] anyway what did you put in your .zshrc [23:55:14]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:01:13] tried a lot of variationprecmd() { echo -n "\033]0;$USER\007" } [00:01:13]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:01:19] various on: [00:01:19]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:01:27] larryv [00:01:27]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	thrig	[00:02:48] echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}\007"  works fine for me [00:02:48]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:02:50] So that works without dvtm, but not within dvtm [00:02:50]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	thrig	[00:03:10] is the terminal disallowing control sequences? [00:03:10]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:04:02] good question. I use st [00:04:02]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:05:45] I think it must allow control sequences, because like I said it works when I run it within the terminal, thrig, only the variables are not expanded [00:05:45]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:06:36] this works without dvtm: precmd() { eval 'echo -n "\033]0;$USER $PWD\007"' } [00:06:36]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:06:56] it gets expanded properly and all that [00:06:56]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:07:04] but dvtm swallows it somehow [00:07:04]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	llua	[00:09:26] why the pointless eval? [00:09:26]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:10:41] no reason. saw it in an example somewhere and figured there was a reason for it [00:10:41]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[00:10:56] doesnt work with or without the eval [00:10:56]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Aelius	[01:11:55] I have come to the conclusion that dvtm's window title functionality is horribly broken [01:11:55]

2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:52:50] well, I like that "feature". [15:52:50]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	danielsh	[15:53:26] well, it'll be fixed eventually [15:53:26]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:53:39] don't rush it ;) [15:53:39]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	danielsh	[15:53:39] you can set the ignore-patterns style if you like it the way it is [15:53:39]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	danielsh	[15:54:07] ^7heo, I have a list of completion buglets longer than backscroll [15:54:07]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:54:09] I wish I could grep -rni over ftp [15:54:09]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:54:24] unfortunately the only way is to download the whole dir and grep locally [15:54:24]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	danielsh	[15:54:25] I usually ssh over and grep there, when I can [15:54:25]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:54:30] sure [15:54:30]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:54:38] but that's a very basic ftp server with nothing else [15:54:38]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:54:49] so, zfget it will be [15:54:49]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:55:20] btw, danielsh, did you ever write danielsh? [15:55:20]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:55:36] because I would be amused to execute /bin/danielsh [15:55:36]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	llua	[15:56:27] s/niel// [15:56:27]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	danielsh	[15:56:49] <phy1729> danielsh is actually a complex shellcode exploit that became sentient [15:56:49]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:56:49] nah, that one smells. [15:56:49]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:57:01] meh [15:57:01]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:57:21] btw, is it normal that zfls returns "Options: -a" in the list? [15:57:21]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:57:59] and if yes, is it usual to filter the output of zfls with sed '/^Options: /d'? [15:57:59]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:58:29] oh it's printed to stderr [15:58:29]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	^7heo	[15:58:45] I see, sorry for the noise. [15:58:45]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[23:46:51] hello! I cannot get this to work with zsh https://github.com/martanne/dvtm#how-to-set-the-window-title [23:46:51]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[23:47:36] there are two issues: nothing happesn if I put it in my zshrc [23:47:36]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[23:47:47] if I run it from the terminal, it doesnt expand variables [23:47:47]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[23:48:14] echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}\007" [23:48:14]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[23:48:21] literally prints ${USER} [23:48:21]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	larryv	[23:51:48] > echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}\007" [23:51:48]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	machabot	[23:51:48] larryv: ]0;macha% [23:51:48]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	larryv	[23:51:58] hm [23:51:58]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	larryv	[23:55:14] anyway what did you put in your .zshrc [23:55:14]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:01:13] tried a lot of variationprecmd() { echo -n "\033]0;$USER\007" } [00:01:13]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:01:19] various on: [00:01:19]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:01:27] larryv [00:01:27]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	thrig	[00:02:48] echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}\007"  works fine for me [00:02:48]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:02:50] So that works without dvtm, but not within dvtm [00:02:50]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	thrig	[00:03:10] is the terminal disallowing control sequences? [00:03:10]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:04:02] good question. I use st [00:04:02]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:05:45] I think it must allow control sequences, because like I said it works when I run it within the terminal, thrig, only the variables are not expanded [00:05:45]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:06:36] this works without dvtm: precmd() { eval 'echo -n "\033]0;$USER $PWD\007"' } [00:06:36]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:06:56] it gets expanded properly and all that [00:06:56]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:07:04] but dvtm swallows it somehow [00:07:04]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	llua	[00:09:26] why the pointless eval? [00:09:26]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:10:41] no reason. saw it in an example somewhere and figured there was a reason for it [00:10:41]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[00:10:56] doesnt work with or without the eval [00:10:56]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Aelius	[01:11:55] I have come to the conclusion that dvtm's window title functionality is horribly broken [01:11:55]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	psprint	[05:52:18] Huh, (r: :: :) trimms when the length of padded text is larger than requested pad [05:52:18]

2016-09-23 12:21:12	danielsh	[16:28:38] .txt is the one thing that works almost everywhere [16:28:38]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Mikachu	[16:28:39] it takes 9 clicks and a custom extension to view a text attachment in gmail with firefox [16:28:39]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Mikachu	[16:28:49] but you can preview a pdf with one click [16:28:49]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	danielsh	[16:29:20] Mikachu, a text attachment with text/ MIME type or with application/octet-stream MIME type? [16:29:20]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Mikachu	[16:31:41] yeah [16:31:41]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:31:45] any midnight commander users here? i store my aliases in /etc/zsh/zlogin. in mc, i notice my aliases use those specified in /etc/zsh/zshrc ; any solutions to suggest? i prefer to use zlogin because the file is empty initially so i can easily store my 'global' customizations [16:31:45]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Mikachu	[16:31:46] it's possible text/plain is easier [16:31:46]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Mikachu	[16:31:52] but it refuses to show text/x-patch or whatever too [16:31:52]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	danielsh	[16:33:15] biax, zshenv is read by non-interactive shells too...   I guess mc picks them up through calling system(3) [16:33:15]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	danielsh	[16:33:34] You may be able to put a if [[ -o interactive ]] in zhenv. [16:33:34]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	psprint	[16:35:07] biax: apparently MC doesn't call zsh with "-l" option, i.e. runs non-login shell [16:35:07]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Mikachu	[16:35:37] zlogin/zprofile is definitely the wrong place for aliases [16:35:37]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	phy1729	[16:35:58] Why is your zshrc not initially empty? [16:35:58]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Mikachu	[16:36:10] whose? [16:36:10]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	phy1729	[16:36:29] biax: Wait why are you using the system wide configuration? [16:36:29]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:39:50] phy1729: how do you suggest i store my settings system wide? my settings are mostly aliases and some simple password generation functions [16:39:50]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:39:54] ill show you [16:39:54]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	phy1729	[16:40:20] Why do they need to be system wide? [16:40:20]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:40:39] phy1729: https://bpaste.net/show/cc509ddba028 [16:40:39]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:40:43] where would you store these? [16:40:43]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:41:03] because i want other users to have the same aliases [16:41:03]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	phy1729	[16:41:31] I would greatly dislike to be on one of your boxes :) [16:41:31]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	phy1729	[16:41:42] I'd put them in ~/.zshrc [16:41:42]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:41:43] im the only user in my box [16:41:43]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:41:50] i need to use other users at times [16:41:50]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:42:01] other logins. [16:42:01]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	phy1729	[16:44:38] I'd suggest becoming better acquanted with sudo; but if they really must be systemwide, /etc/zsh/zshrc is the right place to put them [16:44:38]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	thrig	[16:45:14] how to annoy other users on the system in one easy step [16:45:14]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	phy1729	[16:45:24] he's the only person [16:45:24]

2016-09-23 12:21:12	Mikachu	[16:46:45] how to get annoyed when package updates and deletes your aliases [16:46:45]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	thrig	[16:47:09] no vendor would be so clumsy with their updates! [16:47:09]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	phy1729	[16:47:14] How to choose a saner distro [16:47:14]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:48:46] phy1729: would you say a reasonable workaround to have a clean customization for myself is to add ". /etc/zsh/mycustomizations" ? [16:48:46]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	biax	[16:48:59] perhaps add that to the bottom of /etc/zsh/zshrc ? [16:48:59]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	mSSM	[18:24:34] Trying to figure out how to make tab-completion expand to a hostname alias I have in .ssh/config. In there, I have a Host foobar, which points to foobar.long.address.tld. [18:24:34]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	mSSM	[18:24:52] Now, when I do $ ssh foo<tab>, it expands to $ ssh foobar.long.address.tld [18:24:52]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	mSSM	[18:25:07] I would want it to only expand to $ ssh foobar [18:25:07]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	thrig	[18:25:28] I put the hosts I want completed in ~/.hosts, and then zstyle -e ':completion:*' hosts 'reply=($(< ~/.hosts))' [18:25:28]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	mSSM	[18:27:24] thrig: I guess that's one way, I will look into it. Thanks [18:27:24]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	mSSM	[18:27:56] I was looking at /usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion/Unix/_ssh, and there is some reference to the ssh config, so I guess it looks there. But the file is a bit verbose to easily understand it...... [18:27:56]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	danielsh	[18:43:20] mSSM, what you want is already done by default [18:43:20]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	mSSM	[18:46:17] danielsh: Then something is borked here, I guess ;( [18:46:17]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	mSSM	[18:46:55] danielsh: As I wrote, for me it expands to the full address, not just to the Host alias in the .ssh/conf [18:46:55]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	mSSM	[18:50:14] danielsh: Alright, I just tried giving it a different Host. If I rename it from foobar to barfoo and leave everything else the same, then $ ssh bar<tab> expands to $ ssh barfoo [18:50:14]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	mSSM	[18:51:41] So it looks like the issue is with me naming the Host foobar, and having it's hostname start with foobar. It then prefers to expands to the full Hostname [18:51:41]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	lothric	[18:52:47] Hi, is there a difference between matcher-list '' 'm:{[:lower:][:upper:]}={[:upper:][:lower:]} and matcher-list '' 'm:{a-z}={A-Z}' 'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z} ? [18:52:47]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	FoH	[19:57:54] lothric. from what i've read about other things that can use [:lower:] and [:upper:], they will also work for non ASCII-compatible locales [19:57:54]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	FoH	[20:00:23] apparently, for some locales, z is in the middle of the alphabet, so [a-z] only matches half the letters [20:00:23]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	danielsh	[20:13:06] (so: set LC_COLLATE=C) [20:13:06]

2016-09-24 00:33:57	psprint	[09:25:01] tested this on 4.3.17 and it works ;) [09:25:01]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	psprint	[09:25:21] a nice way to see the palette [09:25:21]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	psprint	[09:25:45] wrapped in palette() { * } ;] [09:25:45]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	karelk	[09:25:46] yes, works nice (4.3 here as well) [09:25:46]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	psprint	[09:26:00] karelk: wonder what are the reasons to use 4.3 ? [09:26:00]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	karelk	[09:26:19] I am on Debian Wheezy [09:26:19]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	psprint	[09:27:08] luckily with 5.3 Zsh is closing to becoming so mature that I suspect even Wheezy will switch, but who knows [09:27:08]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	karelk	[09:27:47] jessie has 5.0 IIRC [09:27:47]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	psprint	[09:28:24] that's stupid, 4.3.17 doesn't have all 5.x extensions but has many patches. 5.0 has many extensions but few patches [09:28:24]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	psprint	[09:28:55] (not that sure about number of patches in 4.3.17, but at least there are few extensions) [09:28:55]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	psprint	[09:30:43] so, one can really joke around with ancient software in Debian [09:30:43]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	psprint	[09:31:24] If they would switch kernel like from 2.4 -> 2.6, would they stick to 2.6.1 when there would be 2.6.20 available, LOL [09:31:24]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	psprint	[09:32:01] karelk: maybe it.s 5.1.1 not 5.0.0 ? [09:32:01]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	karelk	[09:34:07] psprint: it is 5.0.7 [09:34:07]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	karelk	[09:34:11] just checked [09:34:11]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	psprint	[09:34:22] well so it's not that bad [09:34:22]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	danielsh	[09:34:54] psprint, colortest-256 exists [09:34:54]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	danielsh	[09:35:32] http://ix.io/1pUm [09:35:32]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	psprint	[09:37:22] colortest that would be a script could be placed into share/<ver>/scripts, which is unused.. EXCEPT I just checked and on 5.2 there's finally something there, "newuser". So I can calmly submit Zcurses 256 color test now, as a script [09:37:22]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	psprint	[09:38:52] but it doesn't have #! [09:38:52]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	Mikachu	[09:40:29] if you make a contrib thing, please make it check the colors terminfo property or something [09:40:29]

2016-09-24 00:33:57	machabot	[09:41:00] Mikachu: [09:41:00]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	Mikachu	[09:41:07] well, it works in real life [09:41:07]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	psprint	[09:43:07] Mikachu, danielsh: would it be possible to somehow run caller's zsh, so there's a chance that it would be 5.3? Doing #/usr/bin/env/zsh doesn't guarantee 5.3, user can have /usr/local/bin/zsh-5.3 and use it: http://sprunge.us/cfEa [09:43:07]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	Mikachu	[09:43:21] no [09:43:21]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	Mikachu	[09:43:39] for example, the callers zsh binary might be deleted already [09:43:39]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	psprint	[09:43:39] danielsh: you had that trick about #!/usr/bin/env and restarting with "$@" passed .. [09:43:39]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	danielsh	[09:44:45] psprint, just ask for a path to a zsh5.3 to be passed [09:44:45]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	danielsh	[09:45:06] question: how to do "#!/usr/bin/env zsh -f" in a way that works? [09:45:06]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	danielsh	[09:45:14] (#! lines can't take multiple arguments) [09:45:14]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	psprint	[09:57:23] danielsh: you had that idea: if [ -z "$ZSH_VERSION" ]; then exec /usr/bin/env zsh -f "$@" ; fi     here https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/pull/314 [09:57:23]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	danielsh	[10:08:18] psprint, http://perldoc.perl.org/perlrun.html#*-S* [10:08:18]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	psprint	[10:10:24] I did how you told, ask for a path to Zsh binary, plus first checking if is-at-least gives 5.3, so it's quite nice now: http://sprunge.us/EBaN [10:10:24]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	danielsh	[10:12:08] psprint, I don't actually like the idea of self-exec'ing scripts. [10:12:08]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	danielsh	[10:12:34] eg in your case I'd just have done if ! >=5.3; then exit 1; fi  with an error message [10:12:34]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	psprint	[10:17:41] I've put the script into source-forge Zsh repository, into Scripts/ where newuser is, and it doesn't install. configure.ac doesn't have the `newuser' I wonder from where it takes that as thing to install? [10:17:41]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	danielsh	[10:18:00] .distfiles ? [10:18:00]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	danielsh	[10:18:25] also not to discourage you but I amn't sure that script will be accepted for inclusion [10:18:25]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	psprint	[10:19:45] yeah, I will not send it now, just prepare things, will do some multiple hour background thinking on whether to submit, although your opinion reveals all, it will not be accepted [10:19:45]

2016-09-24 00:38:31	Mikachu	if you send 7 mails in the same thread with no replies, then you are sending mails too fast :p
2016-09-24 00:39:44	Mikachu	a fun thing i did that is mildly useful, print history number in prompt, and if you paste a number on an empty commandline, paste handler inserts $history[number] instead of the number

2016-09-24 00:46:48	danielsh	psprint, don't :(
2016-09-24 00:47:03	psprint	also added emacs, vim modeline detection for files without extension and #!, cool thing to parse extension-less Zsh files
2016-09-24 00:47:37	danielsh	you really should break your changes into individual patches / patchsets and upstream them.

2016-09-24 13:36:45	larryv	because it's not a valid zsh glob

2016-09-24 13:37:13	larryv	which requires setopt EXTENDED_GLOB
2016-09-24 13:37:53	larryv	well ok technically you could use !(…) but it requires KSH_GLOB
2016-09-24 13:38:07	MoziM	so i put setopt EXTENDED_GLOB in my .zshrc file?
2016-09-24 13:38:31	larryv	do you want to use the ^ syntax or the ! syntax
2016-09-24 13:38:32	MoziM	and if i don't have setopt EXTENDED_GLOB i need to use **/(^README.txt) ?

2016-09-24 13:38:46	MoziM	makes more sense to me that way

2016-09-25 23:34:31	Mikachu	okay
2016-09-25 23:34:35	Mikachu	no hurry
2016-09-25 23:34:43	danielsh	we can do it now if you like
2016-09-25 23:34:59	danielsh	My logic is that popping bufstack changes $BUFFER so *any* redrawhook implementation would be interested in it
2016-09-25 23:35:29	Mikachu	i don't have any objection to the patch except for the fact that it doesn't work for me
2016-09-25 23:36:34	Mikachu	and since zlecallhook(init) is called 3 lines below where you added the hook, and setting the highlights in zle-line-init doesn't work, i don't see how it could either
2016-09-25 23:36:44	danielsh	could it be interaction with one of your other local patches ?
2016-09-25 23:36:56	Mikachu	i don't feel like it would, but i can check
2016-09-25 23:37:01	danielsh	I'll try to find a minimal repro later
2016-09-25 23:37:07	danielsh	one that doesn't involve zsyh, just M-q
2016-09-25 23:37:10	danielsh	no hurry :)
2016-09-25 23:37:52	danielsh	MoziM, Like I said earlier: make 'c' a function
2016-09-25 23:40:13	Mikachu	heh, with vanilla zsh the match-bracket widget doesn't exist :p
2016-09-25 23:41:33	Mikachu	yeah, calling redrawhook() at that point in the code has no effect for me
2016-09-25 23:41:33		[23:41]
2016-09-25 23:41:39	Mikachu	with vanilla + match-bracket
2016-09-25 23:42:07	Mikachu	but
2016-09-25 23:42:09	Mikachu	maybe it's my fault still
2016-09-25 23:42:49	Mikachu	yeah... i had a return in my hook ^_^;;;
2016-09-25 23:42:55	Mikachu	not unconditional obviously
2016-09-25 23:45:53	Mikachu	i love this comment i have above my pre-redraw hook
2016-09-25 23:45:54	Mikachu	# putting an anonymous function in this hook causes a segfault when running

2016-09-25 23:53:39	Mikachu	it will also highlight any text added to $BUFFER in the zle-line-init hook, even if no buffer popped
2016-09-25 23:55:26	danielsh	Mikachu, I don't have a ready answer for this question

2016-09-26 00:00:12	Mikachu	if you bind ^X you're going to have a bad time
2016-09-26 00:00:15	danielsh	^Z is `stty suspend`

2016-09-26 00:00:25	danielsh	^\ is SIGQUIT while we're at it
2016-09-26 00:00:37	^7heo	yeah ^\ is best unbound.
2016-09-26 00:00:45	Mikachu	you are free to bind ^Z at the shell, zsh ignores suspend
2016-09-26 00:01:00	ij	I'll take ^M.

2016-09-26 00:02:30	Mikachu	ij: ^M is the enter key
2016-09-26 00:02:51	ij	I thought it was ^J.
2016-09-26 00:03:05	ij	Oh, they're both.
2016-09-26 00:03:17	Mikachu	^J is newline, ^M is carriage return, most terminals send ^M for enter though
2016-09-26 00:03:22	Mikachu	mine sends ^J for ctrl-enter
2016-09-26 00:03:41	^7heo	yeah I prefer to use ^J tho.
2016-09-26 00:03:48	^7heo	newline is preferable as a newline.
2016-09-26 00:04:00	Mikachu	not really a matter of preference, unless you patch your terminal emulator
2016-09-26 00:04:49	danielsh	I think he means he would have preferred that ^J was free

2016-09-26 05:19:28	danielsh	psprint, something related to jobs / background processes ?
2016-09-26 05:19:38	psprint	Hintting Ctrl-R , Ctrl-C rapidly after one other didn't cause anything :)
2016-09-26 05:20:03	psprint	danielsh: can be, but I'm aiming at Ctrl-C in zle .recursive-edit, but any crash would be a start maybe
2016-09-26 05:21:47	psprint	started 16 sleep 10000 and Ctrl-R Ctrl-C effect didn't change ;p
2016-09-26 05:23:27	psprint	did also coproc cat, what else can be done for stress it
2016-09-26 05:24:05	danielsh	let the jobs print to stdout, exit, etc
2016-09-26 05:24:12	danielsh	so signals happen
2016-09-26 05:24:23	danielsh	unlikely to be related to recursive-edit though
2016-09-26 05:25:03	psprint	will add periodic hook and ALARM trap with TMOUT=1 ;d
2016-09-26 05:27:04	raphae_l	Mikachu: in fact I said directories, but I was thinking files...

2016-09-26 05:27:51	Mikachu	a space should only be added there if it was an unambiguous match
2016-09-26 05:28:12	danielsh	do you use any config framework ?
2016-09-26 05:28:19	psprint	HAH CRASHED
2016-09-26 05:28:49	danielsh	psprint, using master ?
2016-09-26 05:28:50	psprint	and core isn't there :! I've tested this with kill -ABRT and it did dump core
2016-09-26 05:28:53	psprint	danielsh: yes
2016-09-26 05:28:57	danielsh	nice
2016-09-26 05:29:03	danielsh	jobs or recursive-edit ?
2016-09-26 05:29:47	psprint	Terminal was closed when I returned from browser, it was after I entered TMOUT=1, maybe doing it without ALARM function (that's what it's called??) causes crash

2016-09-26 05:30:05	Mikachu	maybe you should read the manpage
2016-09-26 05:30:14	Mikachu	setting TMOUT with no handler defaults to exiting the shell
2016-09-26 05:30:41	psprint	aha :] good, so cores will be generated
2016-09-26 05:31:03	danielsh	Mikachu, as it happens, just today I wrote a script to SIGUSR1 my tray mail checker.
2016-09-26 05:31:19	danielsh	Mikachu, That kills it, but something restarts it and makes it check mail.
2016-09-26 05:31:21	 *	danielsh happy 
2016-09-26 05:31:31	Mikachu	sounds like the correct solution
2016-09-26 05:31:39	danielsh	psprint, Anyway, if you're checking for bugs, make sure you have 39435
2016-09-26 05:32:28	Mikachu	also i would have thought this was obvious, but if you're trying to crash zsh, run a nested shell so you see the errors
2016-09-26 05:32:42	psprint	thanks
2016-09-26 05:32:44	danielsh	tjc ?
2016-09-26 05:32:45	zayita	If the terminal just closes, type 'zsh' at the prompt to open a subshell and reproduce the bug there. (Then pastebin the error message, if any.)
2016-09-26 05:32:52	danielsh	zayita, link nested shell to tjc
2016-09-26 05:32:52	zayita	danielsh: linked.

2016-09-26 12:16:39	ironcamel	it's not ctrl-b
2016-09-26 12:16:59	ironcamel	because this one is bound to ctrl-b: "^B" backward-char
2016-09-26 12:17:15	psprint	it's Alt-b, or ESC-b
2016-09-26 12:17:30	psprint	^[ means escape, it's Ctrl-[
2016-09-26 12:17:38	ironcamel	ah, thanks
2016-09-26 12:18:07	psprint	so this key combination is also Ctrl-[ b ;)

2016-09-26 12:20:52	erg	am i supposed to `typeset` my variable to be a list/array? (and what's the syntax for that)
2016-09-26 12:21:09	thrig	... it makes sense if you have ASCII in columns then follow the esc column down eight rows ...
2016-09-26 12:21:40	psprint	erg: yes, the syntax is typeset -a var_name
2016-09-26 12:22:00	erg	psprint: before you assign to it, after, does it matter?
2016-09-26 12:22:09	psprint	but you'd normally use local -a var_name, and rather, rather typeset -ga for globals
2016-09-26 12:22:35	psprint	before, it matters

2016-09-26 21:42:13	psprint	[22:50:52] hah when I ran it without #!/bin/zsh it ran as bash apparently, and worked [22:50:52]

2016-09-26 21:42:13	xse	[07:13:57] hi there [07:13:57]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	danielsh	[07:14:09] morning [07:14:09]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	xse	[07:14:46] how can i do something like : sh -c " echo 'toto' | awk -v var=coucou '{ printf("%s\n%s\n", var, $1) }'" [07:14:46]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	xse	[07:15:01] it works great without the "sh -c [07:15:01]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	xse	[07:15:10] but there is a problem with quoting [07:15:10]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	xse	[07:15:24] i'm done set -x to see how the shell interpret it [07:15:24]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	xse	[07:15:30] but it doesn't helped me [07:15:30]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	xse	[07:15:54] i've done* [07:15:54]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	psprint	[07:16:43] danielsh: To keep the number of emails low.. What do you mean by "The parameter expansions $foo need to be escaped, some as \$foo and others as ${(q)foo}." ? I might still reply referring to this IRC conversation, this way there will be single email and no "what do you mean", "Ah I see", etc. :) [07:16:43]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	danielsh	[07:17:54] psprint, there are four parameter expansions in the argument to eval:   $func, $PLUGIN_PATH, $FPATH, $opts[...] [07:17:54]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	llua	[07:18:20] xse: inside "", the $1 expands [07:18:20]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	danielsh	[07:18:31] psprint, They need to be quoted.  Some of them by backslashing, some of them by (q). [07:18:31]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	danielsh	[07:19:00] psprint, (and thanks for declaring the intent to quote IRC) [07:19:00]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	danielsh	[07:19:42] xse, the " in the argument to printf need escaping, too [07:19:42]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	xse	[07:20:26] thx guys [07:20:26]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	psprint	[07:21:19] > PLUGIN_DIR="hello\"world"; eval "function fun() { local param=\"${(q)PLUGIN_DIR}\"; echo \$param; }"; fun [07:21:19]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	machabot	[07:21:20] psprint: hello"world [07:21:20]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	psprint	[07:21:59] in general you're right it's just that I get this feeling that (q) might get some \ chars inside $param, but cannot actually grasp this [07:21:59]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	psprint	[07:22:27] hmm apparently all \ will be eaten when parsing \"...\" [07:22:27]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	llua	[07:23:00] its like someone didn't just mention that [07:23:00]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	psprint	[07:24:48] > PLUGIN_DIR="hello\"world"; eval "function fun() { local param=\"${(q)PLUGIN_DIR}\"; echo -E \$param; }"; fun [07:24:48]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	machabot	[07:24:49] psprint: hello"world [07:24:49]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	danielsh	[07:25:34] psprint, adding \" by hand is wrong [07:25:34]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	psprint	[07:26:14] danielsh: para=\"...\" those? [07:26:14]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	danielsh	[07:26:23] yes [07:26:23]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	psprint	[07:26:33] why [07:26:33]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	danielsh	[07:26:44] well I could answer.. [07:26:44]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	danielsh	[07:26:54] but perhaps you could come up with the answer ? [07:26:54]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	psprint	[07:27:19] > a=a\ b\ c; echo -E $a [07:27:19]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	machabot	[07:27:19] psprint: a b c [07:27:19]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	psprint	[07:27:41] so my gut feeling was maybe right, "" does something maybe not required for (q) [07:27:41]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	danielsh	[07:32:33] so do you see why the \" are superfluous ? [07:32:33]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	psprint	[07:34:31] well ok [07:34:31]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	psprint	[07:36:53] for such situation one tends to use (qqq), assigning string via \ on spaces feels so pure theoretically correct [07:36:53]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	psprint	[07:39:26] Hah the other manual-autoload-stub variant is correct in first args, but rather fails at $@ eval "function $func { --zplg-reload-and-run ${(q)PLUGIN_DIR} ${(qq)opts[*]} ${(q)func} "'"$@" }' [07:39:26]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	danielsh	[07:39:48] it fails but not at $@ [07:39:48]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	psprint	[07:40:09] ? [07:40:09]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	danielsh	[07:40:31] You answer :-) [07:40:31]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	psprint	[07:41:56] IMO it does fail at $@, but for other place, $func could have [ etc. in it [07:41:56]

2016-09-26 21:55:39	danielsh	it doesn't matter how many q's you put inside the parens, it'd be correct either way
2016-09-26 21:55:54	danielsh	I think it wouldn't even affect the which/functions output
2016-09-26 21:56:54	psprint	yes, it's just that people tend to use different quotation than I, I always use (q), this is an exception, and I guess others would use (q) or (qq) not (qqq)
2016-09-26 21:57:23	danielsh	z-sy-h uses qq in error messages

2016-09-26 21:57:24	psprint	just some babling, nevermind ;)

2016-09-26 21:57:47	psprint	seems reasonable

2016-09-26 21:58:08	danielsh	psprint, about the list, I think you want \$FPATH not (q)FPATH
2016-09-26 21:59:13	psprint	no it's ok, fpath constructed at time when plugin calls autoload (the code is inside autoload-shadowing function, i.e. called in place of builtin autoload)
2016-09-26 22:00:49	psprint	ah eval would just use $FPATH, I think it's good either way
2016-09-26 22:01:23	psprint	hm no, it would be inside function's body, so (q) is needed
2016-09-26 22:01:54	danielsh	> x=foo; eval 'f() { echo \$x ${(q)x} }'; x=bar; f

2016-09-26 22:01:57	psprint	eval "function ..." is specific because things are secondary deffered by fact that they yet to-be-called when the function runs :]

2016-09-27 01:43:15	lericson_	yeah that worked
2016-09-27 01:43:25	danielsh	then something in your dotfiles does that.
2016-09-27 01:44:22	lericson_	how come zsh -f uses vi keys though
2016-09-27 01:44:32	lericson_	maybe due to my inputrc

2016-09-27 22:59:37	lericson_	[12:02:58] instead of zle -K vicmd, simply do zle vi-cmd-mode [12:02:58]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	danielsh	[12:04:17] Maybe you just need to alias 'main' to 'vicmd' [12:04:17]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	lericson_	[12:04:39] nah they docs are very clear on that, it's something to do with the sorcery used to implement vi keys [12:04:39]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	lericson_	[12:04:46] doing that gets you stuck in command mode [12:04:46]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	danielsh	[12:06:20] *nod* [12:06:20]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	psprint	[13:07:21] What would make ${+functions[abc]} return 0 even if abc() would exist? I think it's something about disabling stuff, I messed up with something, and e.g. [(e)$txt] returns bad math expression, etc. [13:07:21]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	llua	[13:10:49] you messed something up [13:10:49]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	psprint	[13:20:21] got it isolated.. its..: [13:20:21]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	psprint	[13:21:31] or not. [13:21:31]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	psprint	[13:52:39] it was: unset functions :] [13:52:39]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	psprint	[15:33:08] From where comptags takes the tags? [15:33:08]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	psprint	[15:34:18] I get _tags:comptags:67: no tags registered [15:34:18]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	llua	[17:42:02] using _tag correctly [17:42:02]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	llua	[17:42:13] _tags* [17:42:13]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	psprint	[18:06:42] > xsource() { while (( ${#argv} > 0 )) ; do source "$1"; shift; done; }; echo 'set --' > file; xsource ./file [18:06:42]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	machabot	[18:06:42] psprint: xsource:shift: shift count must be <= $# [18:06:42]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	psprint	[18:06:59] should sourced file alter positional parameters of sourcing context? [18:06:59]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	llua	[18:27:37] why wouldn't it? [18:27:37]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	FoH	[18:29:14] psprint. it seems reasonable to me, since the souced material is executed within that context [18:29:14]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	psprint	[18:30:43] grml uses this xsource, it breaks my one plugin, fair enough, switched to unset __ZNT_SOMETHING; typeset -ga __ZNT_SOMETHING; set +A __ZNT_SOMETHING a b c d [18:30:43]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	psprint	[18:49:55] heh, a coincidence, 500 commits - version 2.2.2 [18:49:55]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	phy1729	[18:53:16] only 12 away from a nice round number [18:53:16]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	hob	[18:54:12] i'm using zprezto and it suggests downloading packages when I'm trying to autocomplete [18:54:12]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	hob	[18:54:59] like i'll type "git push or[TAB]" and it will do this: "git push orInstall package 'yp-tools' to provide command 'ypcat'? [N/y]" [18:54:59]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	hob	[18:55:46] I'm trying to figure out which module is causing it right now but I thought that was pretty weird [18:55:46]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	thrig	[18:55:55] did something silly like CORRECT or CORRECT_ALL get turned on? [18:55:55]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	phy1729	[18:56:04] Sounds like you're on ubuntu and a pretzo author didn't wrap his command calls [18:56:04]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	hob	[18:56:11] fedora 24 [18:56:11]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	hob	[18:56:54] thrig, where can I find that setting? [18:56:54]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	thrig	[18:58:42] setopt  will show what options have been set [18:58:42]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	hob	[19:01:40] correct was enabled so I turned it off but the problem persists. I just need a new terminal instance to refresh settings, right? [19:01:40]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	hob	[19:19:47] with the 'completion' module disabled it works (no surprise I guess) [19:19:47]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	mjacob_	[21:32:48] is it possible to read an environment variable of another zsh process? [21:32:48]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	sigma_g	[21:33:25] /proc/<pid>/environ ? [21:33:25]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	mjacob_	[21:35:13] sigma_g: zsh does not update this data structure - it stays the same as it was when starting the zsh process [21:35:13]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	sigma_g	[21:35:26] oh [21:35:26]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	SeepingN	[21:51:29] would be a neat trick. and likely security hole [21:51:29]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	SeepingN	[21:51:54] I'd be happy if we could just change directory in a script and have it "stick" when it quit out [21:51:54]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	danielsh	[21:56:13] ps sometimes shows environment variables [21:56:13]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	danielsh	[21:56:32] and if a script needs to change the pwd then it needs to be sourced, or be a function or alias [21:56:32]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	llua	[22:08:56] IPC to the parent brah [22:08:56]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	danielsh	[22:09:36] s/IPC/gdb/ [22:09:36]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	llua	[22:10:15] zsh: command not found: gdb [22:10:15]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	danielsh	[22:13:46] well then either install gdb, or remove "directories" support from the kernel [22:13:46]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	llua	[01:02:42] pkg install: The following pattern(s) did not match any allowable packages. Try using a different matching pattern, or refreshing publisher information: gdb [01:02:42]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	izalove	[01:15:55] printf in zsh is the only implementation i found that accepts both 3.3 and 3,3 for %f in a locale where the , is used as radix character [01:15:55]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	izalove	[01:16:14] s/the ,/,/ [01:16:14]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	introvert	[07:50:58] Why bindkey -v behaves different in pretzo ? I think default vi bindings are very good. [07:50:58]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	introvert	[07:51:56] for instance when I press search with / pretzo don't let me do 'n' or 'N' [07:51:56]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	introvert	[07:58:48] got it [07:58:48]

2016-09-28 09:15:29	kafloopascope	Hello! It seems to be new behavior for me -- pressing the up cursor key to access previous commands puts the cursor at the beginning of the line, instead of the end. I would prefer it at the end. How/where is that specified?

2016-09-28 09:21:20	thrig	well don't do that
2016-09-28 09:21:29	kafloopascope	haha, I see
2016-09-28 09:22:04	kafloopascope	confirmed, problem solve. I can't remember what problem I was solving by putting those there in the first place.
2016-09-28 09:22:13	SeepingN	those are up and down tho
2016-09-28 09:22:42	SeepingN	oh n/m I see
2016-09-28 09:23:45	SeepingN	so, one of these? history-search-backward, up-line-or-history, up-line-or-search
2016-09-28 09:24:10	kafloopascope	SeepingN, I'm totally solved, without my bindkey lines zsh does what I want
2016-09-28 09:24:29	SeepingN	cool
2016-09-28 09:24:29	thrig	and (a) default is (re)discovered!
2016-09-28 09:24:54	SeepingN	unti you type a few characters and expect a search..?
2016-09-28 09:25:48	kafloopascope	yeah, I think on one of my systems the up and down keys inserted characters or something and that was what I did to fix it. SeepingN when I type a few characters and tap Up, it only shows me lines that match those chars. It's all good.
2016-09-28 09:26:16	SeepingN	perfect

2016-09-28 21:20:49	psprint	danielsh: I think the still-not-100ms result is effect of not storing and using string length, it still iterates every char, just not calling MB_METACHARLEN

2016-09-29 00:46:15	***	Buffer Playback...
2016-09-29 00:46:15	psprint	[07:29:42] just look what m-h handles: https://asciinema.org/a/da6q6wmbsvdqtl9b6njjzexp8 [07:29:42]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	danielsh	[07:30:31] psprint, that doesn't look right [07:30:31]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	danielsh	[07:30:40] psprint, you need to set interactive_comments. [07:30:40]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	danielsh	[07:30:48] then each license line would be one token [07:30:48]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	psprint	[07:31:48] I have them set in shell. But look on how it handles code, it's also bit-by-byt, operating huge proc_buf consntantly. It's getting smaller and smaller that was my one optimization to at least shorten the buffer when it's possible [07:31:48]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	psprint	[07:32:34] ah set in shell but not in #!/bin/zsh script [07:32:34]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	danielsh	[07:32:50] it was a *2 optimization, though. [07:32:50]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	danielsh	[07:32:59] we do need that multibyte or arrlen stuff to get big-O gains. [07:32:59]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	danielsh	[07:33:20] (I mean the 'arrlen' branch - making arrays know their lengths - Mikachu and I have been intermittently working on.) [07:33:20]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Mikachu	[08:10:09] have you rebased your arrlen wip branch on top of the optimizations you did the other month? (if they conflict at all) [08:10:09]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	osse	[08:19:59] In MSYS2 I can write æøå and similar just fine in bash. If I start zsh (with zsh -f -o multibyte) then nothing apparently happens when I press those keys. Furthermore the character • in a regular zsh instance is rendered as â€. The output of [08:19:59]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	osse	[08:20:57] 'locale' is the same in both shells. How can I debug this further? Should  setopt multibyte  give an error if zsh was not compiled with multibyte support? Please don't kill me for asking an MSYS2 question. [08:20:57]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	psprint	[08:28:55] Out of nowhere at shell startup I get "TRAPALRM: scalar parameter abcdef created globally in function TRAPALRM" while not getting it in genera, I have that abcdef=$(( abcdef + 1 )) in TRAPALRM [08:28:55]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Mikachu	[08:34:32] warncreateglobal [08:34:32]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	psprint	[08:36:27] yes but I don't have that opt, and it is like if I wouldn't have it all the time – no message – just once.. just reporting hehe, maybe any clues, always worth to try [08:36:27]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Mikachu	[08:36:53] find where you set it and remove that line if you don't want it enabled [08:36:53]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Mikachu	[08:37:15] function setopt() { print -r - "$funcfiletrace[1]: $0 ${(q-)@}"; builtin $0 "$@" } [08:37:15]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Mikachu	[08:37:21] put that in .zshenv if you have trouble tracking it down [08:37:21]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	psprint	[08:37:52] I think it's some race condition, this showed quickly after switch to -O2, but will try the setopt wrapper [08:37:52]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Mikachu	[08:38:04] i'm pretty sure no emulation modes enable the option [08:38:04]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	FoH	[08:39:35] out of curiousity, is there something wrong with  (( abcdef++ ))  ? [08:39:35]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	psprint	[08:39:48] FoH: I don't do typeset for it [08:39:48]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	psprint	[08:41:42] did the setopt wrapping and getting only setopt localoptions warncreateglobal from z-sy-h.. so.. just a curiosity [08:41:42]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	osse	[09:25:11] Seems like --enable-multibyte does nothing on msys2 :( [09:25:11]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	danielsh	[09:28:59] osse, sounds like a bug in configure? [09:28:59]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	danielsh	[09:29:09] if --enable- was passed and the feature wasn't enabled, it ought to error out [09:29:09]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	osse	[09:34:31] Very interesting [09:34:31]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	osse	[09:35:30] danielsh: the following was run from inside the zsh repo: http://sprunge.us/FiFh [09:35:30]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	osse	[09:35:54] Maybe --enable-multibyte should be named --disable-multibyte [09:35:54]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	osse	[09:36:31] seems like multibyte checking happens if I DON'T pass that flag [09:36:31]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	danielsh	[09:40:35] yes and no. [09:40:35]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	danielsh	[09:40:41] if you don't pass the flag, it does auto-detection [09:40:41]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	danielsh	[09:40:55] if you pass the flag, it takes you upon your word and skips the detection [09:40:55]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	danielsh	[09:41:03] diff config.h. [09:41:03]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	danielsh	[09:41:52] psprint, in your email, is that "abcdef" literally?  Or is that redacted for some other parameter name? [09:41:52]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	psprint	[09:53:25] literally [09:53:25]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Mikachu	[09:54:07] danielsh: the descriptioin for 'add-zle-hook-widget: Escape "$@".' should be "Terminate option list" or something like that [09:54:07]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	danielsh	[09:54:27] Mikachu, You mean the log message ? [09:54:27]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Mikachu	[09:54:34] yeah [09:54:34]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	danielsh	[09:55:06] whichever wording you rpefer [09:55:06]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	danielsh	[09:56:52] "Add end-of-options guard." ? [09:56:52]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Mikachu	[10:03:16] sure [10:03:16]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	danielsh	[10:03:54] done [10:03:54]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	danielsh	[10:03:56] thx [10:03:56]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	osse	[10:14:15] danielsh: In that case it seems multibyte Just Doesn't Work (tm) in msys [10:14:15]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	danielsh	[10:18:32] ... then how bash works? [10:18:32]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	osse	[10:28:29] I have no idea [10:28:29]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	osse	[10:28:58] Maybe it just processes bytes in an encoding-agnotic way [10:28:58]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	osse	[10:29:55] Maybe bash thinks I pressed two keys in sequence when I press ø. the \xc3 key and the \xb8 key... [10:29:55]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	osse	[10:36:28] goddammit. everything is fine. wrong locale/input settings in the terminal emulator [10:36:28]

I ended up needing history-search-{backward,forward} bindkeys.

2016-09-29 11:22:48	Mikachu	your question is somewhat unspecified, do you want the history to be saved as you run the commands, or once they exit?
2016-09-29 11:23:04	tater	it keeps nonexistant dirs from getting added to the path, how can i expand it to take another parameter as the path
2016-09-29 11:23:38	tater	addtopath() { [[ -d $1 ]] && $2=($1 $2) } doesnt work

2016-09-29 11:24:29	F1skr	But I don't want to see the command in other already active sessions cause that would mess up my local history there
2016-09-29 11:24:48	Mikachu	that would be controlled by sharehistory, so don't set that

2016-09-29 12:08:21	Mikachu	but the quoting gets tricky
2016-09-29 12:09:37	Somelauw	My zshrc takes long to evaluate. Is there an easy way to profile it and see which statement takes long?
2016-09-29 12:09:53	Mikachu	first step is run zsh -x
2016-09-29 12:09:57	Mikachu	and see if you can just see where it stalls
2016-09-29 12:10:17	Mikachu	for comparison, my .zshrc is 2300 lines and zsh starts up in 40ms
2016-09-29 12:13:58	Somelauw	well zsh -x takes long already, but i don't know what i've learned from it

2016-09-29 12:21:18	Mikachu	if you put zmodload zsh/zprof first in your .zshrc, and then zprof at the end, it will dump out which functions used the most time
2016-09-29 12:21:26	Somelauw	ok
2016-09-29 12:21:48	Mikachu	it might be easier to track down which area is slow if you wrap sections in named functions
2016-09-29 12:22:06	Mikachu	so [buncha code] becomes time1() { [buncha code] }; time1

My current work-around is to run that command, let it fail, type ‘mkdir -p <Alt-.><Ctrl-w>’, run that, press up twice, run that command again but it's annoyingly unnecessary
2016-09-29 14:45:45	haasn	It would be great if I could use some simple syntax to get zsh to create the dirs if necessary for me
2016-09-29 14:46:00	Mikachu	even mkdir -p is a gnu extension

2016-09-30 00:48:26	***	Buffer Playback...
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[08:55:04] It walks $BUFFER because it highlights all brackets, not just the one that matches $CURSOR [08:55:04]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[08:55:16] but yeah, if you want to highlight all brackets i guess you're stuck with that [08:55:16]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[08:55:27] isn't it very slow though? [08:55:27]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[08:55:42] if the commandline is 500+ characters [08:55:42]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[08:56:07] performance on huge buffers is an issue yes [08:56:07]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[08:56:17] I generally try it with 'fned vcs_info' or so [08:56:17]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[08:56:43] (I mean perf of the 'main' highlighter; probably applies to the brackets highlighter too but I have no first-hand experience there) [08:56:43]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[08:57:11] btw, in your initial patch your comment said "now do syntax highlighting", fairly self centered :P you can use the hook for anything [08:57:11]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[08:57:38] mea culpa [08:57:38]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[08:59:02] speaking of which, do you have any thoughts about ordering multiple add-zle-hook-widget hooks ? [08:59:02]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[08:59:27] when two plugins register a (say) pre-redraw hook and they want to specify their relative order [08:59:27]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[08:59:38] to be perfectly honest, i have not read a single one of the mails about add-zle-hook-widget [08:59:38]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[09:00:21] that's great, you can now give tabula rasa feedback :) [09:00:21]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[09:00:29] (only if interested of course) [09:00:29]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[09:00:37] sure [09:00:37]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[09:01:14] so, in 5.3 zsyh will hook itself through add-zle-hook-widget, [09:01:14]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[09:01:22] which solves ~10 distinct reported issues, [09:01:22]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[09:01:29] it just feels somewhat overengineered compared to telling the user "to use this, put "zle myhook" in your <whatever>-hook function at the appropriate place" [09:01:29]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[09:01:42] but the question is, what if another plugin registers a pre-redraw hook that modifies $BUFFER. [09:01:42]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[09:01:58] but i suppose we're targetting users who are lazier than that [09:01:58]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[09:02:21] modifying buffer from pre-redraw would be pretty sick [09:02:21]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[09:02:25] no, it's a valid answer... bypass add-zle-hook-widget altogether. [09:02:25]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[09:02:35] why?  it's "pre" redraw. [09:02:35]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[09:02:53] well, is it supposed to remove the last character every time you move the cursor? [09:02:53]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[09:03:27] but supposing someone somehow has a valid use for doing that [09:03:27]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[09:03:35] I could see it useful, for example, to have the the effect of 'set linebreak' in vim [09:03:35]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[09:03:38] i guess you would want them to run first [09:03:38]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[09:03:46] (never wrap lines in the middle of a word, only between words) [09:03:46]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[09:04:18] you don't really set that for writing shell code... [09:04:18]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[09:04:43] yes, I'd want them to run first... now how would that be achieved? [09:04:43]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[09:05:07] Mikachu, one problem with the "write your own hook" is that it requires all users to replicate work [09:05:07]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[09:05:20] not much work if your way is [09:05:20]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[09:05:26] add-hook pre-redraw syntax-highlight 15 [09:05:26]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[09:05:34] add-hook pre-redraw other-sick-thing 5 [09:05:34]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[09:05:36] and my way is [09:05:36]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[09:05:51] pre-redraw() { zle other-sick-thing; zle syntax-highlight } [09:05:51]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[09:06:04] the differene is that my way, that happens only once in the plugin, [09:06:04]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[09:06:15] whereas your way, every user has to replicate the correct sequence [09:06:15]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[09:06:48] well, z-sy-h is fairly widespread [09:06:48]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[09:07:02] if you pick a priority number you can just hope everyone writing a plugin that modifies the buffer picks a lower number [09:07:02]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[09:07:17] ;) [09:07:17]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[09:07:37] i can't think of another way that is non-specific to pre-redraw [09:07:37]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[09:07:41] popularocracy?  Whoever has the most users lays down the law? :) [09:07:41]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[09:08:24] I thought of using tsort(1), zsyh could register itself as "> buffer-is-stable", othersickthing would register itself as "<buffer-is-stable", then tsort would DTRT without explicit numbers [09:08:24]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	Mikachu	[09:08:29] "If you're not confused, I haven't correctly transferred all the limited information I do have..." heh (pws) [09:08:29]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[09:08:44] heh [09:08:44]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	MoziM	[10:37:40] can someone explain how this alias/function hybrid works? alias f="find . -type f -recursive | xargs cat | sed -n '/^function $1\(\)/,/^}/p'" [10:37:40]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	MoziM	[10:37:53] it's witchcraft to me O.o [10:37:53]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[10:44:34] first of all it has a bug [10:44:34]
2016-09-30 00:48:26	danielsh	[10:44:34] it should exchange the single and double quotes [10:44:34]

2016-09-30 05:10:12	psprint	danielsh: would have to do extra work. For example currently I detect Zsh keywords like "float". Bash doesn't have one. They probably will not accept. And I would have to do work of recognizing Bash "local" keyword, if it can have some surprises, like "+" options.. not soon
2016-09-30 05:10:12		[05:10]
2016-09-30 05:10:45	psprint	I detect float and it isn't real problem for Bash but from maintainer's point of view it is problem
2016-09-30 05:12:03	danielsh	I see...
2016-09-30 05:12:19	danielsh	and I guess we don't want to fork the syntaxes, since then we (zsh) won't benefit from fixes to sh/bash.

2016-09-30 06:24:59	Mikachu	Hi-Angel: ls /etc/zsh*
2016-09-30 06:25:23	Mikachu	you can put setopt noglobalrcs in your ~/.zshenv to prevent most system rcs from starting (/etc/zshenv always runs)
2016-09-30 06:25:24	danielsh	it's called from prompt_grml_precmd_worker... which may or may not be in $precmd_functions

2016-09-30 09:30:17	kahmalo	if there's a multibyte character whose second byte matches e.g. a single-byte backslash
2016-09-30 09:30:47	kahmalo	UTF-8 never has that, IIRC there are some Chinese encodings that do
2016-09-30 09:31:52	kahmalo	When zsh reads such a multibyte character, does it understand that there's no actual backslash?
2016-09-30 09:33:35	kahmalo	It looks like lex.c calls hgetc to read each character, and compares the result to e.g. '\\', so the multibyte character would have to be recognized in hgetc, which is a function pointer that can point to e.g. ingetc
2016-09-30 09:34:41	phy1729	You can't have a multi-byte UTF-8 sequence where any of the bytes match a backslash
2016-09-30 09:34:42	kahmalo	In input.c, ingetc calls itok(lastc = STOUC(*inbufptr++)), then possibly returns lastc
2016-09-30 09:35:03	phy1729	oh I should read better
2016-09-30 09:35:04	kahmalo	phy1729: are you saying that zsh does not support multibyte encodings other than UTF-8?

2016-09-30 09:36:06	kahmalo	psprint: The code writes the shell syntax to the terminal, and the user can copy and paste it from there.  It's not specifically for zsh

2016-09-30 09:40:24	kahmalo	I guess just adding single or double quotes and backslashes isn't the right thing anyway, since there might be control characters that have unexpected effects on the terminal
2016-09-30 09:40:25	psprint	Zsh uses mb_metacharlenconv() to find offset of N-th character, that's how multi-byte characters are handled
2016-09-30 09:41:06	psprint	kahmalo: Zsh has (q) quoting flags, you could reuse that code maybe

2016-10-01 06:08:34	psprint	when testing <( ) I also tested bash and obtained errors about `pwd`/dev/fd/63.. Decided to not risk fancy files and use normal files, already done:
2016-10-01 06:09:25	Karados	Hi, I've got two lines "zmodload zsh/complist" followed by "autoload -U complist" in my zshrc. After I commented out these two I see no difference when using tab completion, nor I can understand exactly what they are useful for after reading the manual, can someone tell me if they are worth it?

2016-10-01 06:10:39	llua	the autoload complist is completely useless. zmodload zsh/complist makes stuff complist avaiable before complist is implictly loaded by compsys
2016-10-01 06:13:11	psprint	horrible API, maybe one would like to participate in writing UI library? Already supporting e.g. hyperlinks, but sometimes bad API arises, this could be done nicer: https://github.com/psprint/zcommodore/blob/master/uizcm#L195-L205
2016-10-01 06:13:52	psprint	The missing "already done" link where I use files: https://github.com/psprint/zcommodore/blob/master/__zcmdr_uizcm_load_tree
2016-10-01 06:16:26	Karados	llua: got it, how is "zmodload zsh/complist" useful if I have "autoload -Uz compinit && compinit"?

2016-10-01 08:28:53	pterodactyl	whoa!! Thanks. but could you explain what exactly is going behind the curtain?
2016-10-01 08:29:17	pterodactyl	I'm curious to know.
2016-10-01 08:29:38	llua	you tell zsh an offset of history entries to print
2016-10-01 08:29:48	llua	zsh does the needful
2016-10-01 08:30:08	llua	well, a starting point.
2016-10-01 08:30:30	psprint	it's event number, i.e. history entry number from which to start displaying
2016-10-01 08:31:10	pterodactyl	Cool! Thanks llua and psprint. :)

2016-10-01 08:46:56	psprint	looking what else to hookup to zcommodore, ag is on the list and I'll add the support tomorrow, but just looking around, thought about .. doxygen, if it could make some use for in-shell actions or Zsh language

2016-10-01 08:48:49	llua	dbus
2016-10-01 08:50:58	psprint	yeah dbus was created in the same spirit "oh so much could be done, integration, endless possibilities, KERNEL yeah add it to kernel, " etc. and eventually it's not used, at least I don't use and don't see or read about using it. Did hard work to not let Zcommodore finish this way, I got some concretes luckily
2016-10-01 08:54:17	psprint	but who knows maybe dbus could have some use, with zsh/net, and expected no requirement for SSL, heh, but I'm on OS X, zero experience with dbus
2016-10-01 08:55:22	llua	you should hook dbus up to it
2016-10-01 08:55:58	psprint	could download Github Issues for current project in Zsh but SSL is needed, however it's possible to find small opensource SSL program that could be shipped with the plugin (I've interrupted research on this not sure, it looked good), however how many people would use it? it's nice to be in touch with Github Issues but how often actually one has a project like zsh-autosuggestions where many issues are submitted

2016-10-01 14:06:36	***	Buffer Playback...
2016-10-01 14:06:36	psprint	[16:13:52] The missing "already done" link where I use files: https://github.com/psprint/zcommodore/blob/master/__zcmdr_uizcm_load_tree [16:13:52]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	Karados	[16:16:26] llua: got it, how is "zmodload zsh/complist" useful if I have "autoload -Uz compinit && compinit"? [16:16:26]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	llua	[16:21:27] you can bind keys to the menuselect keymap before using menuselect for the first time, http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/84867/zsh-completion-enabling-shift-tab/84869#84869 [16:21:27]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	Karados	[16:35:34] llua: got it, thank you [16:35:34]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	pterodactyl	[18:26:43] everytime I issue "history" command, zsh only shows of last 16 commands. I want it to show all the history. How do I change it? [18:26:43]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	llua	[18:27:26] history 1 [18:27:26]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	pterodactyl	[18:28:53] whoa!! Thanks. but could you explain what exactly is going behind the curtain? [18:28:53]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	pterodactyl	[18:29:17] I'm curious to know. [18:29:17]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	llua	[18:29:38] you tell zsh an offset of history entries to print [18:29:38]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	llua	[18:29:47] zsh does the needful [18:29:47]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	llua	[18:30:07] well, a starting point. [18:30:07]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	psprint	[18:30:30] it's event number, i.e. history entry number from which to start displaying [18:30:30]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	pterodactyl	[18:31:10] Cool! Thanks llua and psprint. :) [18:31:10]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	danielsh	[18:31:53] zshbuiltins(1) for more info [18:31:53]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	psprint	[18:38:04] danielsh: how do you use ag, anything special maybe? [18:38:04]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	psprint	[18:46:55] looking what else to hookup to zcommodore, ag is on the list and I'll add the support tomorrow, but just looking around, thought about .. doxygen, if it could make some use for in-shell actions or Zsh language [18:46:55]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	llua	[18:48:49] dbus [18:48:49]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	psprint	[18:50:58] yeah dbus was created in the same spirit "oh so much could be done, integration, endless possibilities, KERNEL yeah add it to kernel, " etc. and eventually it's not used, at least I don't use and don't see or read about using it. Did hard work to not let Zcommodore finish this way, I got some concretes luckily [18:50:58]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	psprint	[18:54:16] but who knows maybe dbus could have some use, with zsh/net, and expected no requirement for SSL, heh, but I'm on OS X, zero experience with dbus [18:54:16]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	llua	[18:55:22] you should hook dbus up to it [18:55:22]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	psprint	[18:55:57] could download Github Issues for current project in Zsh but SSL is needed, however it's possible to find small opensource SSL program that could be shipped with the plugin (I've interrupted research on this not sure, it looked good), however how many people would use it? it's nice to be in touch with Github Issues but how often actually one has a project like zsh-autosuggestions where many issues are submitted [18:55:57]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	psprint	[18:57:10] llua: wonder if mention of dbus support would help or hurt the project, is dbus actually liked after the IMO dissapointment [18:57:10]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	llua	[18:57:23] i think hooking dbus up should be priority number one [18:57:23]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	psprint	[18:57:29] hah OSX has dbus [18:57:29]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	danielsh	[19:07:30] set grepprg=ag\ --case-sensitive\ --vimgrep\ \"$@\" [19:07:30]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	danielsh	[19:07:30] set grepformat=%f:%l:%c:%m [19:07:30]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	danielsh	[19:07:40] psprint, ^^^ that's .vimrc [19:07:40]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	danielsh	[19:08:02] psprint, ag() command ag --case-sensitive --pager='less -FXR' "$@" ← that's .zshrc [19:08:02]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	danielsh	[19:09:51] I meant to paste this cnoremap <unique> <expr> g (getcmdtype() == ':' && getcmdpos() == strlen(':ag')-1 && getcmdline() == 'a' && &grepprg[0:2] == 'ag ') ? "\<BS>grep" : 'g' [19:09:51]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	danielsh	[19:09:57] </OT> [19:09:57]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	BrainDamage	[19:16:36] psprint: you should use XDG dirs instead of hardcoding ~/.config [19:16:36]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	psprint	[20:18:13] re [20:18:13]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	psprint	[20:18:27] danielsh: thanks [20:18:27]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	psprint	[20:19:30] reading about the XDG, interesting idea, although not catched the main point of it [20:19:30]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	psprint	[20:21:07] supporting XDG one could include a cool Github shield maybe, like that one https://img.shields.io/badge/zsh-v5.0.0-orange.svg?style=flat-square [20:21:07]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	psprint	[20:21:24] turns out dbus comes from Homebrew, not directly from OS X [20:21:24]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	llua	[20:32:40] eta on hooking up dbus? [20:32:40]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	larryv	[20:37:22] lolllll [20:37:22]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	APic	[20:37:33] *shrug* [20:37:33]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	krobzaur	[20:44:26] Anyone know if I can make the bgnotify command not give notifications when running certain commands? [20:44:26]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	krobzaur	[20:44:48] Its slightly unnecessary to see a timing notification every time I run my text editor [20:44:48]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	llua	[20:45:37] have you tried reading bgnotify's documentation? [20:45:37]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	krobzaur	[20:55:39] lol I did a quick google and saw nothing immediately so I came here. I am ashamed [20:55:39]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	krobzaur	[20:57:02] I'll read it detail and come back if I still don't know what to do [20:57:02]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	llua	[20:57:36] if the documentation doesn't mention how, it prob can't be done. i doubt we would know [20:57:36]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	psprint	[21:14:02] apropos documentation http://imgur.com/a/GJmsZ [21:14:02]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	llua	[21:15:49] that is misleading [21:15:49]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	psprint	[21:16:39] bash's doc is also that short [21:16:39]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	psprint	[21:16:45] llua: you mean "bash compatible" ? [21:16:45]
2016-10-01 14:06:36	llua	[21:16:53] yea [21:16:53]
