2016-09-15 20:37:21	psprint	that's what can be called "slightly", i.e. not much, traded for robustness
2016-09-15 20:39:49	danielsh	the idiom with [ is      [ x"foo" = x"bar" ] with the 'x' in front
2016-09-15 20:40:03	danielsh	in zsh you'd usually use [[ though.
2016-09-15 20:40:18	psprint	hmm, when will [ cause problems?

2016-09-15 20:41:47	danielsh	other question, what's an easy way to strip leading/trailing whitespace from a variable?
2016-09-15 20:41:53	danielsh	(actually: from each element of an array)
2016-09-15 20:42:59	Mikachu	a=('  hi ' '  h ello '); echo ${${a# #}% #}

2016-09-15 20:43:17	Mikachu	that could have worked, in theory

2016-09-15 20:44:13	danielsh	thanks - I was hoping for something simpler, eg python has foo.strip() for this.
2016-09-15 20:44:13	Mikachu	> a=('  hi ' '  h ello '); echo ${${a## #}%% #}
2016-09-15 20:44:14	machabot	Mikachu: hi h ello
2016-09-15 20:44:21	Mikachu	i forgot # % is shortest possible match
2016-09-15 20:45:20	psprint	just a drop in from my code: cmd="${cmd##[[:space:]]#}" cmd="${cmd%%[[:space:]]#}"   AFAIR [[:space:]] has those unicode spaces (if it's not [[:blank:]], but rather not.. If I'm not confusing this with vim right now.. but easy to check..)
2016-09-15 20:46:47	danielsh	thanks psprint
2016-09-15 20:47:29	psprint	YH, that [[ vs [ test is 66ms vs 546ms on my machine..

2016-09-16 20:51:32	psprint	a=my, myvar${a}=1 doesn't work, such namespacing can be done only via (P) probably?
2016-09-16 20:53:18	Mikachu	to some degree you can also use typeset
2016-09-16 20:53:27	Mikachu	> a=my; typeset $a=hello; echo $my
2016-09-16 20:53:28	machabot	Mikachu: hello
2016-09-16 20:54:28	llua	associative arrays are normally used for this kind of stuff
2016-09-16 20:55:24	danielsh	«parameters[$x]=y» doesn't do it either.
2016-09-16 20:56:12	psprint	thanks
2016-09-16 20:57:34	psprint	I could flood set's output etc. with separate variables, better to migrate to hash
2016-09-16 20:58:16	danielsh	assocs show in `set` too
2016-09-16 21:03:41	psprint	ah right, so will use -h for this
2016-09-16 21:03:41		[21:03]
2016-09-16 21:04:30	psprint	or rather -H

2016-09-16 21:10:12	danielsh	(these are intended for variables where restoring the value doesn't make sense)

2016-09-17 02:24:34	ahacker	I have a small problem, more like an annoyance. As we all know zsh has "command/filename correction" usually in case we mispell or mistype something. however, when i use mv sometimes the new filename is one number off from similar names in the same directory. Is there a way to ommit any instance of mv from the correction checking?
2016-09-17 02:24:49	Mikachu	alias mv=nocorrect\ mv
2016-09-17 02:25:03	Mikachu	i personally would recommend to not use the correctall setting though
2016-09-17 02:25:25	Mikachu	since in the normal case any existing filename on the commandline will have been produced by tabcompletion anyway
2016-09-17 02:25:34	ahacker	and i can just put that in my .zshrc
2016-09-17 02:25:38	ahacker	hmmm, ok
2016-09-17 02:25:42	ahacker	good to know
2016-09-17 02:25:42	Mikachu	you sure can
2016-09-17 02:25:52	Mikachu	i mean, do you type out long filenames without pressing tab?
2016-09-17 02:26:08	ahacker	no
2016-09-17 02:29:13	ahacker	so i can still tab complete, with this alias it just won't try and correct me with a filename that already exists?
2016-09-17 02:29:31	ahacker	I don't want to accidenty overwrite data
2016-09-17 02:31:23	Mikachu	well
2016-09-17 02:31:33	Mikachu	if you want to be really careful you can do alias mv='nocorrect mv -i'
2016-09-17 02:31:44	Mikachu	and mv will also ask you if you're crazy if you give an existing filename, and zsh won't suggest them
2016-09-17 02:35:41	osse	no matter how l33t you are you're allowed to open a file manager two times a year

2016-09-17 02:37:23	veverak	hi folks, I recently switched to zsh as my primary shell and notice one ... problem
2016-09-17 02:37:51	veverak	when I ssh into customers servers (which are using bash and can't be changed) and try to open vim
2016-09-17 02:38:12	veverak	I don't see proper syntax hilighting, like... colors won't change at all and just some things are underlined
2016-09-17 02:38:28	veverak	any tips what to google to get rid of this problem?
2016-09-17 02:38:31	danielsh	check your $TERM value
2016-09-17 02:38:40	osse	it's unlikely that zsh influences that
2016-09-17 02:38:48	osse	unless you use(d) to set TERM in zshrc or bashrc
2016-09-17 02:39:04	danielsh	osse, $TERM propagate over ssh.
2016-09-17 02:39:28	Mikachu	setting TERM in your shell init files is wrong
2016-09-17 02:39:31	danielsh	... so that theory accounts for one mystery here.
2016-09-17 02:39:45	scp1	sendenv TERM=nogood

2016-09-17 02:39:57	danielsh	veverak, is the value different between bash and zsh
2016-09-17 02:40:00	danielsh	?
2016-09-17 02:40:08	veverak	yep
2016-09-17 02:40:13	veverak	bash got xterm-256color
2016-09-17 02:40:24	scp1	veverak, it's likely there's no terminfo for that terminal on your customers server
2016-09-17 02:40:40	Mikachu	you must be doing something incredibly wrong for that to happen
2016-09-17 02:40:55	veverak	hmm
2016-09-17 02:40:58	veverak	manually changed it
2016-09-17 02:41:00	veverak	and now it works
2016-09-17 02:41:02	veverak	scp1: yep
2016-09-17 02:41:19	veverak	thanks!
2016-09-17 02:41:23	scp1	veverak, add sendenv TERM=xterm-256color to your .ssh/config section
2016-09-17 02:41:25	danielsh	veverak, that'll be $5, non-consecutive used bank notes

2016-09-17 02:43:55	danielsh	deal!
2016-09-17 02:44:26	osse	danielsh: yes, I know. my guess is that he sets it in .bashrc but not .zshrc
2016-09-17 02:44:40	veverak	osse: it was not in .bashrc
2016-09-17 02:44:45	veverak	nor the /etc/bash.bashrc
2016-09-17 02:44:54	Mikachu	do you use xterm or urxvt?
2016-09-17 02:45:01	veverak	urxvt
2016-09-17 02:45:16	Mikachu	then it's surprising that the xterm value works better
2016-09-17 02:45:42	veverak	true
2016-09-17 02:45:55	japh	mikachu, missing terminfo on server
2016-09-17 02:46:03	danielsh	by the way, what's that character on veverak 's RPS1?  It looks like a Sigma in hexchat and like <b2> in my terminal
2016-09-17 02:46:25	veverak	error code showed by powershell
2016-09-17 02:46:39	veverak	it should be 'left arrow'

2016-09-17 16:01:38	Celmor	why is zsh not differentiating between $path and $PATH?

2016-09-17 16:03:50	Celmor	how do I enable case-sensitivity for variable names?
2016-09-17 16:04:59	Mikachu	you're maybe a bit confused about what's happening here
2016-09-17 16:05:08	Mikachu	zsh supports tying a scalar parameter to an array parameter
2016-09-17 16:05:16	Mikachu	$path is the array, and $PATH is scalar (separated by colons)
2016-09-17 16:05:34	Celmor	I want to set $path but it causes it no longer to find programs in $PATH
2016-09-17 16:05:37	Mikachu	there's no case insensitivity going on
2016-09-17 16:05:42	Mikachu	use another parameter name

2016-09-17 16:09:21	Celmor	can I get the default POSIX behaviour of ^u? what function would that behaviour be called in zsh?
2016-09-17 16:12:11	llua	there is no posix behaviour for u, so describe what you expect
2016-09-17 16:12:11		[16:12]
2016-09-17 16:13:58	Celmor	then bash behavior
2016-09-17 16:14:12	llua	and that behavior is?
2016-09-17 16:14:17	Celmor	most shells I work with work like bash do as in yanking from cursor to beginning of prompt
2016-09-17 16:14:43	Celmor	zsh just discards the whole line
2016-09-17 16:16:43	larryv	backward-kill-line
2016-09-17 16:17:07	Celmor	does it also tank it so I can paste it with ^y ?
2016-09-17 16:17:11	Celmor	yank*
