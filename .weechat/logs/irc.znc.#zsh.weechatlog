2016-09-15 20:37:21	psprint	that's what can be called "slightly", i.e. not much, traded for robustness
2016-09-15 20:39:49	danielsh	the idiom with [ is      [ x"foo" = x"bar" ] with the 'x' in front
2016-09-15 20:40:03	danielsh	in zsh you'd usually use [[ though.
2016-09-15 20:40:18	psprint	hmm, when will [ cause problems?

2016-09-15 20:41:47	danielsh	other question, what's an easy way to strip leading/trailing whitespace from a variable?
2016-09-15 20:41:53	danielsh	(actually: from each element of an array)
2016-09-15 20:42:59	Mikachu	a=('  hi ' '  h ello '); echo ${${a# #}% #}

2016-09-15 20:43:17	Mikachu	that could have worked, in theory

2016-09-15 20:44:13	danielsh	thanks - I was hoping for something simpler, eg python has foo.strip() for this.
2016-09-15 20:44:13	Mikachu	> a=('  hi ' '  h ello '); echo ${${a## #}%% #}
2016-09-15 20:44:14	machabot	Mikachu: hi h ello
2016-09-15 20:44:21	Mikachu	i forgot # % is shortest possible match
2016-09-15 20:45:20	psprint	just a drop in from my code: cmd="${cmd##[[:space:]]#}" cmd="${cmd%%[[:space:]]#}"   AFAIR [[:space:]] has those unicode spaces (if it's not [[:blank:]], but rather not.. If I'm not confusing this with vim right now.. but easy to check..)
2016-09-15 20:46:47	danielsh	thanks psprint

2016-09-16 20:51:32	psprint	a=my, myvar${a}=1 doesn't work, such namespacing can be done only via (P) probably?
2016-09-16 20:53:18	Mikachu	to some degree you can also use typeset
2016-09-16 20:53:27	Mikachu	> a=my; typeset $a=hello; echo $my
2016-09-16 20:53:28	machabot	Mikachu: hello
2016-09-16 20:54:28	llua	associative arrays are normally used for this kind of stuff
2016-09-16 20:55:24	danielsh	«parameters[$x]=y» doesn't do it either.
2016-09-16 20:56:12	psprint	thanks
2016-09-16 20:57:34	psprint	I could flood set's output etc. with separate variables, better to migrate to hash
2016-09-16 20:58:16	danielsh	assocs show in `set` too
2016-09-16 21:03:41	psprint	ah right, so will use -h for this
2016-09-16 21:03:41		[21:03]
2016-09-16 21:04:30	psprint	or rather -H

2016-09-16 21:10:12	danielsh	(these are intended for variables where restoring the value doesn't make sense)

2016-09-17 02:24:34	ahacker	I have a small problem, more like an annoyance. As we all know zsh has "command/filename correction" usually in case we mispell or mistype something. however, when i use mv sometimes the new filename is one number off from similar names in the same directory. Is there a way to ommit any instance of mv from the correction checking?
2016-09-17 02:24:49	Mikachu	alias mv=nocorrect\ mv
2016-09-17 02:25:03	Mikachu	i personally would recommend to not use the correctall setting though
2016-09-17 02:25:25	Mikachu	since in the normal case any existing filename on the commandline will have been produced by tabcompletion anyway
2016-09-17 02:25:34	ahacker	and i can just put that in my .zshrc
2016-09-17 02:25:38	ahacker	hmmm, ok
2016-09-17 02:25:42	ahacker	good to know
2016-09-17 02:25:42	Mikachu	you sure can
2016-09-17 02:25:52	Mikachu	i mean, do you type out long filenames without pressing tab?
2016-09-17 02:26:08	ahacker	no
2016-09-17 02:29:13	ahacker	so i can still tab complete, with this alias it just won't try and correct me with a filename that already exists?
2016-09-17 02:29:31	ahacker	I don't want to accidenty overwrite data
2016-09-17 02:31:23	Mikachu	well
2016-09-17 02:31:33	Mikachu	if you want to be really careful you can do alias mv='nocorrect mv -i'
2016-09-17 02:31:44	Mikachu	and mv will also ask you if you're crazy if you give an existing filename, and zsh won't suggest them
2016-09-17 02:35:41	osse	no matter how l33t you are you're allowed to open a file manager two times a year

2016-09-17 02:37:23	veverak	hi folks, I recently switched to zsh as my primary shell and notice one ... problem
2016-09-17 02:37:51	veverak	when I ssh into customers servers (which are using bash and can't be changed) and try to open vim
2016-09-17 02:38:12	veverak	I don't see proper syntax hilighting, like... colors won't change at all and just some things are underlined
2016-09-17 02:38:28	veverak	any tips what to google to get rid of this problem?
2016-09-17 02:38:31	danielsh	check your $TERM value
2016-09-17 02:38:40	osse	it's unlikely that zsh influences that
2016-09-17 02:38:48	osse	unless you use(d) to set TERM in zshrc or bashrc
2016-09-17 02:39:04	danielsh	osse, $TERM propagate over ssh.
2016-09-17 02:39:28	Mikachu	setting TERM in your shell init files is wrong
2016-09-17 02:39:31	danielsh	... so that theory accounts for one mystery here.
2016-09-17 02:39:45	scp1	sendenv TERM=nogood

2016-09-17 02:39:57	danielsh	veverak, is the value different between bash and zsh
2016-09-17 02:40:00	danielsh	?
2016-09-17 02:40:08	veverak	yep
2016-09-17 02:40:13	veverak	bash got xterm-256color
2016-09-17 02:40:24	scp1	veverak, it's likely there's no terminfo for that terminal on your customers server
2016-09-17 02:40:40	Mikachu	you must be doing something incredibly wrong for that to happen
2016-09-17 02:40:55	veverak	hmm
2016-09-17 02:40:58	veverak	manually changed it
2016-09-17 02:41:00	veverak	and now it works
2016-09-17 02:41:02	veverak	scp1: yep
2016-09-17 02:41:19	veverak	thanks!
2016-09-17 02:41:23	scp1	veverak, add sendenv TERM=xterm-256color to your .ssh/config section
2016-09-17 02:41:25	danielsh	veverak, that'll be $5, non-consecutive used bank notes

2016-09-17 02:44:26	osse	danielsh: yes, I know. my guess is that he sets it in .bashrc but not .zshrc
2016-09-17 02:44:40	veverak	osse: it was not in .bashrc
2016-09-17 02:44:45	veverak	nor the /etc/bash.bashrc
2016-09-17 02:44:54	Mikachu	do you use xterm or urxvt?
2016-09-17 02:45:01	veverak	urxvt
2016-09-17 02:45:16	Mikachu	then it's surprising that the xterm value works better
2016-09-17 02:45:42	veverak	true
2016-09-17 02:45:55	japh	mikachu, missing terminfo on server
2016-09-17 02:46:03	danielsh	by the way, what's that character on veverak 's RPS1?  It looks like a Sigma in hexchat and like <b2> in my terminal
2016-09-17 02:46:25	veverak	error code showed by powershell
2016-09-17 02:46:39	veverak	it should be 'left arrow'

2016-09-17 16:04:59	Mikachu	you're maybe a bit confused about what's happening here
2016-09-17 16:05:08	Mikachu	zsh supports tying a scalar parameter to an array parameter
2016-09-17 16:05:16	Mikachu	$path is the array, and $PATH is scalar (separated by colons)
2016-09-17 16:05:34	Celmor	I want to set $path but it causes it no longer to find programs in $PATH
2016-09-17 16:05:37	Mikachu	there's no case insensitivity going on
2016-09-17 16:05:42	Mikachu	use another parameter name

2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:01:38] why is zsh not differentiating between $path and $PATH? [02:01:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Mikachu	[02:01:46] yes [02:01:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:03:50] how do I enable case-sensitivity for variable names? [02:03:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Mikachu	[02:04:59] you're maybe a bit confused about what's happening here [02:04:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Mikachu	[02:05:08] zsh supports tying a scalar parameter to an array parameter [02:05:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Mikachu	[02:05:16] $path is the array, and $PATH is scalar (separated by colons) [02:05:16]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:05:34] I want to set $path but it causes it no longer to find programs in $PATH [02:05:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Mikachu	[02:05:37] there's no case insensitivity going on [02:05:37]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Mikachu	[02:05:42] use another parameter name [02:05:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:06:27] how do I disable there also being an array? does there have to be this functionality? [02:06:27]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:06:49] I have scripts that use $path, would be a shame if all of them don't work anymor [02:06:49]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:09:21] can I get the default POSIX behaviour of ^u? what function would that behaviour be called in zsh? [02:09:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	llua	[02:12:11] there is no posix behaviour for u, so describe what you expect [02:12:11]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:13:58] then bash behavior [02:13:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	llua	[02:14:12] and that behavior is? [02:14:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:14:17] most shells I work with work like bash do as in yanking from cursor to beginning of prompt [02:14:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:14:43] zsh just discards the whole line [02:14:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	larryv	[02:16:43] backward-kill-line [02:16:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:17:07] does it also tank it so I can paste it with ^y ? [02:17:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:17:11] yank* [02:17:11]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	llua	[02:17:40] yes [02:17:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Celmor	[02:22:04] thanks, got it working [02:22:04]

2016-09-18 11:35:14	ft	Since we have to guess, I'm going for screwed up value in $TERM (either inside or outside of tmux) or screwed up value in $PS1.
2016-09-18 11:35:56	bryz	This is "out of the box" oh-my-zsh and tmux
2016-09-18 11:36:12	bryz	It's fine outside of tmux btw
2016-09-18 11:36:37	ft	Since omz is known for its quality code.
2016-09-18 11:37:13	ft	What's the value of $TERM inside and outside of tmux?

2016-09-18 11:42:14	ft	omz is just a set of configuration files for zsh. And they caused lots of trouble in here. It's usually: "Do you have a weird problem nobody else has?" "Yeah, and I'm using omz."
2016-09-18 11:42:48	bryz	ah, im getting some results not that i'm searching for omz

2016-09-18 11:44:17	machabot	"omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the channel #oh-my-zsh.

2016-09-18 13:24:38	bryz	[21:40:52] I've just been searching for "zsh" [21:40:52]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:42:14] omz is just a set of configuration files for zsh. And they caused lots of trouble in here. It's usually: "Do you have a weird problem nobody else has?" "Yeah, and I'm using omz." [21:42:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	bryz	[21:42:48] ah, im getting some results not that i'm searching for omz [21:42:48]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	bryz	[21:43:07] now* - thanks for the help [21:43:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:43:33] Could be a tmux problem too. I have no idea how they implement the graphic characters. Maybe they are multi-character wide and something goes wrong with counting. I don't know. [21:43:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:43:54] You're welcome, and good luck. [21:43:54]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	chris2	[21:44:17] !omz [21:44:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	machabot	[21:44:17] "omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the channel #oh-my-zsh. [21:44:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:45:12] chris2: Thanks! I thought they had their own channel, but couldn't remember. [21:45:12]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	 *	chris2 [21:46:26] just checked if there are even people in there :P [21:46:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:46:53] chris2: And the result? :) [21:46:53]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	chris2	[21:47:09] 28 [21:47:09]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:47:37] That's fair. I remember when this channel had about that number of users. :) [21:47:37]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	chris2	[21:48:07] i didnt realize its 400+ now... [21:48:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	ft	[21:48:14] Yes. Crazy. :) [21:48:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	chris2	[21:48:26] felt like 120 perhaps :P [21:48:26]
