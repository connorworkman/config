2016-09-16 02:29:58	Yhg1s	Drexl: there isn't an easy answer for that, I'm afraid. If you specifically want to use ipython, #ipython may be able to offer more specific advice. If you just want some form of interactivity, it really depends on what processing you are doing. You could use something like twisted or asyncio to handle the communication with the terminal as well as the scheduling of your processing.
2016-09-16 02:30:11	Yhg1s	Drexl: or you could put the processing in a separate program which you launch from your terminal, for example.

2016-09-16 02:39:42	Vayl	I tried using an else: return True but it wasn't accepted as correct, whereas this one was.
2016-09-16 02:39:44	Yhg1s	Vayl: so that True is returned if the loop ends without returning False.

2016-09-16 04:42:25	gronke	I'm still in a bit of a shock that python can't modify a line in a text file, that it has to create a brand new text file, and write all the data plus the new line to the new file, then delete the old one

2016-09-16 04:44:52	papna	ReScO: It will take a bit of preprocessing because pandas' read_csv, though powerful, chokes a bit when you have extraneous whitespace between fields and quoted fields.
2016-09-16 04:44:53	gronke	so then how do I do this? I can't give it the same name, so I'd have to create a new "tmp" file, I suppose, write all the data, and once the data has finished, delete the original file and then rename my tmp file to the original name?
2016-09-16 04:45:01	_habnabit	gronke, sounds good
2016-09-16 04:45:07	noizex	are they connected? I thought that separate gevent.spawn() spawns separate thread so I only join with that one, not wait for all the other
2016-09-16 04:45:12	gronke	cool, thanks
2016-09-16 04:45:22	Yhg1s	gronke: yes, except you don't have to delete the old file. You can simply rename the new file to the old name.
2016-09-16 04:45:24	deniska	noizex: (they're not threads, but should behave kinda like them)
2016-09-16 04:45:26	Yhg1s	gronke: that way it's atomic.
2016-09-16 04:45:27	noizex	unlike having group of [t1, t2, t3] and doing joinall() on it
2016-09-16 04:45:30	simpson	gronke: More or less. To avoid the risk of destroying the original, the typical technique is *atomic renaming*; you'd write to a temp file, close the temp file, and then *rename* the temp file to the original filename.
2016-09-16 04:45:32	noizex	yeah I know, using just as a shortcut :P

2016-09-16 05:07:45	ChrisWarrick	ELFrederich: Long story short, this fucks with the global context of your module and adds defn to it
2016-09-16 05:07:46	simpson	ELFrederich: globals() is a dict representing the current global scope. Writing to it causes new names to appear out of thin air. It is *not* a good thing to use.

2016-09-16 09:25:16	sfz-	Sijmen: pylint is saying to capitalize a global variable. Since you're mutating it, it and the for loop should probably live within a function that you call. Then pylint won't complain.

2016-09-16 11:01:31	Yhg1s	kbdkode: it really depends on the iterator. Some iterators provide a size hint, which makes both cases faster, and a tuple has slightly less overhead then.
2016-09-16 11:01:31	_habnabit	Akuli, what about regression tests? do you want to document every bug you ever fixed?
2016-09-16 11:01:33	nedbat	Akuli: you don't need to document that "lol" and "" and "<weird unicode>" will raise exceptions.

2016-09-16 11:03:26	Yhg1s	Akuli: it's hard to say. It depends on how bad your tests will be.
2016-09-16 11:03:34	Akuli	like http://dpaste.com/0EQC4HJ
2016-09-16 11:03:37	pattyG	-bash: pyvenv: command not found :(
2016-09-16 11:03:52	Yhg1s	Akuli: in my experience, there isn't a tremendous differnece there, but it's your project. If you really expect to run without tests, I'm not sure doctests help.
2016-09-16 11:03:52	Akuli	like tests in general, twice as long as the code its testing
2016-09-16 11:03:56	nedbat	Akuli: doctest is better than no tests at all.  kleenex boxes are better than no shoes at all.

2016-09-16 11:04:19	pattyG	Yhg1s: it came stock on the raspberry pi i'm using (via Debian-> Raspbian "NOOBS")
2016-09-16 11:04:25	Akuli	so far unittests just seem like real shit to maintain
2016-09-16 11:04:29	_habnabit	Akuli, with py.test parameterization, it's pretty trivial to template your tests

2016-09-16 19:04:49	simpson	TimeGiver: Any time that you want iterators.

2016-09-16 19:05:14	TimeGiver	Thanks
2016-09-16 19:05:32	ninjaaron	TimeGiver: if __iter__ is implemented, it's used when ever you iterate on it in a for loop, any time the iter(function) is called on it, and... some other times as well.

2016-09-17 01:49:56	sieve	I’m having trouble sticking them all together into one onject
2016-09-17 01:49:59	flavius	deniska: The point is that exceptions are used to decouple error handling from recorgnizing error conditions. So I want to not care what the caller does, but the caller should get all information put together properly
2016-09-17 01:50:21	flavius	deniska: ... just in case the caller opts to handle it
2016-09-17 01:50:31	flavius	deniska: key word here: decoupling
2016-09-17 01:50:32	deniska	flavius: I mean, combining multiple exceptions in a single raise would require some sort of special handling from a caller
2016-09-17 01:50:46	flavius	sure

2016-09-17 01:51:26	flavius	the caller decides, I don't care. My caller is the only one in the position to decide that
2016-09-17 01:51:42	deniska	flavius: so create a new exception class and put exceptions in its instance?
2016-09-17 01:51:47	flavius	because the caller has more semantic context
2016-09-17 01:51:53	deniska	and raise that instance
2016-09-17 01:52:06	flavius	ok, so not possible by chaining
2016-09-17 01:52:09	tech2	flavius: by the time you've exited the function it's too late to traditionally "handle" the exception. So you're not really talking about the traditional use-case of an exception. What you probably want to do is record the types of errors you had and deal with them.
2016-09-17 01:52:44	deniska	flavius: "chaining" refers to exceptions happening during exception handling
2016-09-17 01:52:47	flavius	ok, so as in my original question "without creating new exception objects", it's not possible
2016-09-17 01:52:50	deniska	flavius: your case is different
2016-09-17 01:53:11	tech2	deniska: not entirely true re chaining (raise NewException() from old_exception)
2016-09-17 01:53:22	tech2	flavius: besides, you're not even really decoupling here if you retain the exception since the exception is directly related to what went on inside the black box.

2016-09-17 01:54:50	LightYagami	is it possible to stop beautifulsoup from parsing if it encounters a <br>?
2016-09-17 01:54:58	flavius	thanks, I'll create a new container exception holding all other exceptions, and throw that one after the loop is done, which will provide more information to the caller, i.e. better error reporting
2016-09-17 01:56:18	flavius	or is there any standard exception for that already?
2016-09-17 01:56:23	tech2	LightYagami: not that I'm aware, for that you probably need some kind of streaming parser, I think lxml can do this, if not, something like sax. Not sure about BS.

2016-09-17 11:29:22	KirkMcDonald	Daiwo: The main difference, from the perspective of a user, is that any dependencies will need to be built for the same architecture.
2016-09-17 11:30:03	Daiwo	so if one python script I want to use is 32bit only and I don't have the x86 version installed, it won't work ?

2016-09-17 14:11:36	Aberts10	muscles: its how you prevent sqlinjection, its the way sqlite3 handles your variables so that someone cant just enter in malicious statements using the inputs you give them.

2016-09-17 14:22:01	disappointment	I'm trying to learn how the `object` based classes really work in Python and I'm kind of stuck. What I have understood is that in Python 3.x all new style classes implicitly inherit from the object class, which is an instance of object AND type classes at the same time while it (the object class) doesn't actually inherit from anything. I don't get it. Is there an article that explains how it works under the hood?

2016-09-17 14:33:54	disappointment	[00:22:01] I'm trying to learn how the `object` based classes really work in Python and I'm kind of stuck. What I have understood is that in Python 3.x all new style classes implicitly inherit from the object class, which is an instance of object AND type classes at the same time while it (the object class) doesn't actually inherit from anything. I don't get it. Is there an article that explains how it works under the hood? [00:22:01]

2016-09-17 17:58:06	Mitch-_-	rud0lf, but it's still ok because if i don't get every holiday with this calc... it's just estimating high. so my calc says "i made $xxxxxx and i needed to make $yyyyyyyy" when $yyyyyy should really be like one day less. but i'm setting the mark as higher than it should be
