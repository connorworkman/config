If you just want some form of interactivity, it really depends on what processing you are doing. You could use something like twisted or asyncio to handle the communication with the terminal as well as the scheduling of your processing.
2016-09-16 02:30:11	Yhg1s	Drexl: or you could put the processing in a separate program which you launch from your terminal, for example.

2016-09-16 02:39:42	Vayl	I tried using an else: return True but it wasn't accepted as correct, whereas this one was.
2016-09-16 02:39:44	Yhg1s	Vayl: so that True is returned if the loop ends without returning False.

2016-09-16 04:42:25	gronke	I'm still in a bit of a shock that python can't modify a line in a text file, that it has to create a brand new text file, and write all the data plus the new line to the new file, then delete the old one

2016-09-16 04:44:52	papna	ReScO: It will take a bit of preprocessing because pandas' read_csv, though powerful, chokes a bit when you have extraneous whitespace between fields and quoted fields.
2016-09-16 04:44:53	gronke	so then how do I do this? I can't give it the same name, so I'd have to create a new "tmp" file, I suppose, write all the data, and once the data has finished, delete the original file and then rename my tmp file to the original name?
2016-09-16 04:45:01	_habnabit	gronke, sounds good
2016-09-16 04:45:07	noizex	are they connected? I thought that separate gevent.spawn() spawns separate thread so I only join with that one, not wait for all the other
2016-09-16 04:45:12	gronke	cool, thanks
2016-09-16 04:45:22	Yhg1s	gronke: yes, except you don't have to delete the old file. You can simply rename the new file to the old name.
2016-09-16 04:45:24	deniska	noizex: (they're not threads, but should behave kinda like them)
2016-09-16 04:45:26	Yhg1s	gronke: that way it's atomic.
2016-09-16 04:45:27	noizex	unlike having group of [t1, t2, t3] and doing joinall() on it
2016-09-16 04:45:30	simpson	gronke: More or less. To avoid the risk of destroying the original, the typical technique is *atomic renaming*; you'd write to a temp file, close the temp file, and then *rename* the temp file to the original filename.
2016-09-16 04:45:32	noizex	yeah I know, using just as a shortcut :P

2016-09-16 05:07:45	ChrisWarrick	ELFrederich: Long story short, this fucks with the global context of your module and adds defn to it
2016-09-16 05:07:46	simpson	ELFrederich: globals() is a dict representing the current global scope. Writing to it causes new names to appear out of thin air. It is *not* a good thing to use.

2016-09-16 09:25:16	sfz-	Sijmen: pylint is saying to capitalize a global variable. Since you're mutating it, it and the for loop should probably live within a function that you call. Then pylint won't complain.

2016-09-16 11:01:31	Yhg1s	kbdkode: it really depends on the iterator. Some iterators provide a size hint, which makes both cases faster, and a tuple has slightly less overhead then.
2016-09-16 11:01:31	_habnabit	Akuli, what about regression tests? do you want to document every bug you ever fixed?
2016-09-16 11:01:33	nedbat	Akuli: you don't need to document that "lol" and "" and "<weird unicode>" will raise exceptions.

2016-09-16 11:03:26	Yhg1s	Akuli: it's hard to say. It depends on how bad your tests will be.
2016-09-16 11:03:34	Akuli	like http://dpaste.com/0EQC4HJ
2016-09-16 11:03:37	pattyG	-bash: pyvenv: command not found :(
2016-09-16 11:03:52	Yhg1s	Akuli: in my experience, there isn't a tremendous differnece there, but it's your project. If you really expect to run without tests, I'm not sure doctests help.
2016-09-16 11:03:52	Akuli	like tests in general, twice as long as the code its testing
2016-09-16 11:03:56	nedbat	Akuli: doctest is better than no tests at all.  kleenex boxes are better than no shoes at all.

2016-09-16 11:04:19	pattyG	Yhg1s: it came stock on the raspberry pi i'm using (via Debian-> Raspbian "NOOBS")
2016-09-16 11:04:25	Akuli	so far unittests just seem like real shit to maintain
2016-09-16 11:04:29	_habnabit	Akuli, with py.test parameterization, it's pretty trivial to template your tests

2016-09-16 19:05:14	TimeGiver	Thanks
2016-09-16 19:05:32	ninjaaron	TimeGiver: if __iter__ is implemented, it's used when ever you iterate on it in a for loop, any time the iter(function) is called on it, and... some other times as well.

2016-09-17 01:49:56	sieve	I’m having trouble sticking them all together into one onject
2016-09-17 01:49:59	flavius	deniska: The point is that exceptions are used to decouple error handling from recorgnizing error conditions. So I want to not care what the caller does, but the caller should get all information put together properly
2016-09-17 01:50:21	flavius	deniska: ... just in case the caller opts to handle it
2016-09-17 01:50:31	flavius	deniska: key word here: decoupling
2016-09-17 01:50:32	deniska	flavius: I mean, combining multiple exceptions in a single raise would require some sort of special handling from a caller
2016-09-17 01:50:46	flavius	sure

2016-09-17 01:51:26	flavius	the caller decides, I don't care. My caller is the only one in the position to decide that
2016-09-17 01:51:42	deniska	flavius: so create a new exception class and put exceptions in its instance?
2016-09-17 01:51:47	flavius	because the caller has more semantic context
2016-09-17 01:51:53	deniska	and raise that instance
2016-09-17 01:52:06	flavius	ok, so not possible by chaining
2016-09-17 01:52:09	tech2	flavius: by the time you've exited the function it's too late to traditionally "handle" the exception. So you're not really talking about the traditional use-case of an exception. What you probably want to do is record the types of errors you had and deal with them.
2016-09-17 01:52:44	deniska	flavius: "chaining" refers to exceptions happening during exception handling
2016-09-17 01:52:47	flavius	ok, so as in my original question "without creating new exception objects", it's not possible
2016-09-17 01:52:50	deniska	flavius: your case is different
2016-09-17 01:53:11	tech2	deniska: not entirely true re chaining (raise NewException() from old_exception)
2016-09-17 01:53:22	tech2	flavius: besides, you're not even really decoupling here if you retain the exception since the exception is directly related to what went on inside the black box.

2016-09-17 01:54:50	LightYagami	is it possible to stop beautifulsoup from parsing if it encounters a <br>?
2016-09-17 01:54:58	flavius	thanks, I'll create a new container exception holding all other exceptions, and throw that one after the loop is done, which will provide more information to the caller, i.e. better error reporting
2016-09-17 01:56:18	flavius	or is there any standard exception for that already?
2016-09-17 01:56:23	tech2	LightYagami: not that I'm aware, for that you probably need some kind of streaming parser, I think lxml can do this, if not, something like sax. Not sure about BS.

2016-09-17 11:29:22	KirkMcDonald	Daiwo: The main difference, from the perspective of a user, is that any dependencies will need to be built for the same architecture.
2016-09-17 11:30:03	Daiwo	so if one python script I want to use is 32bit only and I don't have the x86 version installed, it won't work ?

2016-09-17 14:11:36	Aberts10	muscles: its how you prevent sqlinjection, its the way sqlite3 handles your variables so that someone cant just enter in malicious statements using the inputs you give them.

What I have understood is that in Python 3.x all new style classes implicitly inherit from the object class, which is an instance of object AND type classes at the same time while it (the object class) doesn't actually inherit from anything. I don't get it. Is there an article that explains how it works under the hood?

2016-09-17 14:33:54	disappointment	[00:22:01] I'm trying to learn how the `object` based classes really work in Python and I'm kind of stuck. What I have understood is that in Python 3.x all new style classes implicitly inherit from the object class, which is an instance of object AND type classes at the same time while it (the object class) doesn't actually inherit from anything. I don't get it. Is there an article that explains how it works under the hood? [00:22:01]

2016-09-17 17:58:06	Mitch-_-	rud0lf, but it's still ok because if i don't get every holiday with this calc... it's just estimating high. so my calc says "i made $xxxxxx and i needed to make $yyyyyyyy" when $yyyyyy should really be like one day less. but i'm setting the mark as higher than it should be

2016-09-18 01:35:14	ChrisWarrick	Grorco: The general answer is: in your HTML, make a form that sends data to your page (via POST or GET). If you get any data, show whatever text you need associated with the user’s selection. That’s about 10 lines of code (excluding HTML) with Flask.

This is just 1 example, there are many other caveats. - Regardless if a website is small, or big. My point is that it's a good idea to do research, otherwise, you could run into  serious disasters. Even for a small website.

2016-09-18 05:07:49	blz	jwhisnant, I just looked it up.  Yeah it seems like BT uses tcp by default and uTP was created because of some inherent problems with TCP (that don't apply to me).  In any case, I'm building a distributed process-management library, so basically each host (physical machine) needs to be able to start processes and stream stdin/out/err to arbitrary processes on arbitrary hosts.
2016-09-18 05:07:57	jwhisnant	c0mrade: also (whatever you are trying to do) - the steps may be informative to others. if somebody just "fixes it" for you, others may lose out on that interesting information.

2016-09-18 06:34:10	blz	kingplusplus, ah, that's a different question! :)  It's all about readability.  In other words it's a judgement call:  whichever you feel makes your intentions the clearest.
2016-09-18 06:34:40	pombreda	paranoidabhi, just print it, why would there be an issue?
2016-09-18 06:34:40	blz	kingplusplus, personally I stay away from `else` unless it's in a `if` clause.  I find that it's rarely useful.  I think many would agree with that.

2016-09-18 09:13:52	hifriends	[18:41:19] henbruas: thanks. and using from lets me call the method with out the "time namespace" thank you :D [18:41:19]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	paranoidabhi	[18:42:05] how can I convert  in numpy from an array of (n,) to (n,1) ? I need to take dot product. [18:42:05]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	henbruas	[18:42:49] paranoidabhi, .resize [18:42:49]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	henbruas	[18:44:05] Or numpy.resize if you don't want in-place [18:44:05]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	paranoidabhi	[18:44:28] henbruas, by in-place you mean? [18:44:28]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	hifriends	[18:44:37] can I not use - in var names? [18:44:37]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	henbruas	[18:44:56] paranoidabhi, no [18:44:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	henbruas	[18:44:57] err [18:44:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jamesaxl	[18:44:58] hifriends, it is not to use it [18:44:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	henbruas	[18:44:59] hifriends, no [18:44:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	hifriends	[18:45:14] thanks! [18:45:14]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	henbruas	[18:45:15] paranoidabhi, I mean changing the array instead of creating a new one [18:45:15]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	paranoidabhi	[18:47:51] henbruas, https://bpaste.net/show/2831b2d6610b is this correct? Am I doing something wrong? [18:47:51]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jamesaxl	[18:48:30] hifriends, https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ [18:48:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	henbruas	[18:48:37] paranoidabhi, np.resize is the one that is NOT in-place, so in that case you need to assign the result to sample [18:48:37]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	henbruas	[18:49:11] If you use the resize method your solution would work [18:49:11]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Mrgoose	[18:49:39] Is there a way to create a unit test for a decorator [18:49:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	deniska	[18:50:16] Mrgoose: decorator is essentially a callable, so yes [18:50:16]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Mrgoose	[18:50:25] i can call it directly? [18:50:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	deniska	[18:50:25] Might be awkward though depending on what it does [18:50:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	tech2	[18:50:26] hifriends: if you could use it in a variable name how would you tell the difference between subtraction between two variables, and one variable with a hyphen in its name? [18:50:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	deniska	[18:50:29] Mrgoose: sure [18:50:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	deniska	[18:51:21] Mrgoose: `@foo; def f...` is pretty much equivalent to `def f...; f = foo(f)` [18:51:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	henbruas	[18:51:32] tech2, now I'm curious if there are languages that allow it [18:51:32]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	paranoidabhi	[18:51:39] henbruas, it is pandas obj (*** AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'resize' [18:51:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	paranoidabhi	[18:51:39] ) [18:51:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	henbruas	[18:51:58] paranoidabhi, oh, I thought it was a numpy array [18:51:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	deniska	[18:52:15] henbruas: lisp variants usually allow that [18:52:15]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	henbruas	[18:52:41] deniska, makes sense since it doesn't make subtraction ambiguous for them [18:52:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	paranoidabhi	[18:52:43] henbruas, Tried this: sample.values.resize(sample.shape[0],1) *** ValueError: resize only works on single-segment arrays [18:52:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	sidni	[18:53:04] ok [18:53:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	henbruas	[18:53:13] paranoidabhi, sorry, I don't do Pandas [18:53:13]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	paranoidabhi	[18:53:29] sample.values is an numpy array. [18:53:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	paranoidabhi	[18:53:46] http://stackoverflow.com/a/37043071/3646408 [18:53:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	henbruas	[18:54:02] Oh, what's the shape of sample.values? [18:54:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	hifriends	[18:54:20] jamesaxl: thanks! [18:54:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	paranoidabhi	[18:54:28] henbruas, (16,) [18:54:28]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	hifriends	[18:54:32] re pep 8 [18:54:32]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	henbruas	[18:54:57] Uhh, not sure what that means, try using the resize function instead of the method [18:54:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	tech2	[18:54:58] henbruas: possibly something like APL, that language you can do practically anything with. [18:54:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	deniska	[18:56:22] perl6 also doesn't mind a variable called $foo-bar :) [18:56:22]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	henbruas	[18:56:39] paranoidabhi, oh, I think it's because it's a view. np.resize should handle it I think [18:56:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	tech2	[18:58:03] henbruas: lisp/scheme maybe? [18:58:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	tech2	[18:58:15] (because not infix) [18:58:15]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	henbruas	[18:58:21] tech2, deniska mentioned that [18:58:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	tech2	[18:58:44] henbruas: I'm obviously not paying enough attention sorry. [18:58:44]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	sidni	[19:03:08] i have a text file which is a large row. how would i randomize this row? [19:03:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	energizer	[19:03:56] sidni: read the file into a list, shuffle the list, write the file [19:03:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	sidni	[19:04:45] ok thanks [19:04:45]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	rehat	[19:13:18] With Celery, does anyone know if there is a way to set a identifier to a task before queuing it so that I can fetch all task that belong to a client and cancel them if they disconnect? [19:13:18]

2016-09-18 10:18:58	jcadduono	hi. i have a function in a python script (2.7.12) that appears to act differently on some users PCs and i can't understand how or why it would be doing this - https://github.com/zanezam/kali-nethunter/blob/master/nethunter-installer/build.py#L12
2016-09-18 10:19:03	vrach	hey guys
2016-09-18 10:19:03	Yhg1s	bsl10: then you wouldn't be getting that error.
2016-09-18 10:19:12	henbruas	Turns out "replace" isn't a very useful search word in this case, who'd have guessed
2016-09-18 10:19:22	vrach	i wonder if you can recommend a crossplatform gui toolkit for python
2016-09-18 10:19:33	henbruas	vrach, PyQt
2016-09-18 10:19:43	Yhg1s	vrach: pretty much all of the GUIs fit that bill.

2016-09-18 10:19:59	jcadduono	the function (copytree) is supposed to search through all files in a directory and add them to a location if they don't patch an array of ignored file names, however, for one user it seems to not see certain values in the array

2016-09-18 13:24:38	acetakwas	[23:03:12] Paul1337::  That^ one-liner achieves the same thing. [23:03:12]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Paul1337	[23:03:23] i know this function but i read lambda no longer work in python 3? [23:03:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	deniska	[23:03:39] lambda works in py3 [23:03:39]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	acetakwas	[23:04:04] Paul1337::  But like nedbat said, create a new list [23:04:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Paul1337	[23:05:16] http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/587 [23:05:16]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	acetakwas	[23:06:13] Paul1337::  Or create the string as you go. Within the loop, use a conditional check to concatenate valid alphabets from the list. [23:06:13]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Paul1337	[23:06:19] acetakwas: i can append items in new list but i have to remove items from list because question is Define a function called anti_vowel that takes one string, text, as input and returns the text with all of the vowels removed. [23:06:19]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	deniska	[23:06:50] Paul1337: that's a blogpost from 2005 [23:06:50]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	acetakwas	[23:07:24] Paul1337::  What I wrote above achieves that. [23:07:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	acetakwas	[23:07:36] In fact, you don't need a list at all. [23:07:36]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	acetakwas	[23:07:55] You could iterate over the original string in much the same way. [23:07:55]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	yeryry	[23:08:09] return ''.join(_ for _ in text if _ not in "aeiouAEIOU") [23:08:09]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Paul1337	[23:10:22] but can anyone modify my code? [23:10:22]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	acetakwas	[23:10:49] Paul1337::  yeryry has simplified it for you. [23:10:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	acetakwas	[23:11:10] Put that in your function. But try to understand why and how it works. [23:11:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Paul1337	[23:12:10] but lambda works without function ? its anonymous fun?? [23:12:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	deniska	[23:13:41] Paul1337: lambda expression evaluates to a function [23:13:41]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	deniska	[23:13:52] lambda is pretty much def without a name [23:13:52]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Paul1337	[23:15:14] yea but as acetakwas said put it in your function so if lambda is already alternative of def then why put in function? i am confuse [23:15:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	yeryry	[23:15:21] https://paste.pound-python.org/show/SsPBrKRDzSOLXnRDSNgN/ clunky and unpythonic, but pretty close to what you had [23:15:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	krobzaur	[23:17:08] Alright guys I have very little knowledge about building python extensions from C source code so forgive me for my malformed question. I'm trying to compile some open source software (on Ubuntu 16.04). It compiles fine, but whenever I attempt to install with "pip install ./" I get an error about " x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc: error: : No such file or directory" [23:17:08]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	krobzaur	[23:17:53] This executable exists and it is on my path, I'm not sure why I'm seeing this error. [23:17:53]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	krobzaur	[23:18:42] The error seems to occurr when calling the setup function imported from distutils.core. Why can't it find gcc? What do I need to fix? [23:18:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Paul1337	[23:20:24] yeryry:what was difference between iterate through all of the elements in a list and iterate through all of the elements of text? [23:20:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	yeryry	[23:20:44] You aren't modifying text [23:20:44]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Paul1337	[23:21:36] i can't achieve that while iterate through all of the elements in a list?? [23:21:36]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	nedbat	[23:22:08] Paul1337: you can iterate through a list, but you can't change the list while you do it. [23:22:08]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	yeryry	[23:22:15] As has already been said, if you're modifying the same list you're iterating through, it'll cause problems [23:22:15]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	acetakwas	[23:23:00] Paul1337::  https://paste.pound-python.org/show/ACXmbRW0WLYqVKJuZGvw/ [23:23:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	nedbat	[23:23:32] acetakwas: yikes, why _ on line 3? [23:23:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Paul1337	[23:23:37] then how to make new list with changes ? like list.remove(i) now how to store this result in new list? can i do like this? po=list.remove(i) and then liaa.append(po)  where liaa is empty list [23:23:37]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	nedbat	[23:24:10] Paul1337: forget about list.remove.   Build a whole new list with the stuff you want. [23:24:10]

2016-09-18 14:16:46	invapid	yeah, that's basically how you do it - so I just mask it, and if it's signed make that value negative
2016-09-18 14:16:49	_habnabit	invapid, yes, i understand that, but i'm not sure if you understand my point

2016-09-18 19:53:30	mercurytw	I'm using a library that has a function that must be `await`ed. I'd like to be able to execute it in and exec() for debug purposes, but if i exec it, it returns a generator
2016-09-18 19:53:36	swiftsnowman	_habnabit, ControlMonitor() is the function in question. or set_vcp_feature, they're essentially the same
2016-09-18 19:53:46	mercurytw	so i figured if the result is a generator, i'd await the result

2016-09-18 23:10:19	Patabugen	Hey All. I'm not a python developer but I've been asked to install Python at a school for the kids to learn. I suspect the teacher will want an IDE/decent text editor of some sort but hasn't specified (and I can't get hold of them right now). Is there a nice simple IDE for Python where you basically type the code on the left and the console runs it on the right?

If, however, I leave the form empty (without self.request.GET), the page will list filtered objects perfectly, but without pre-populating the form with the last filters. Can anyone tell me what am I doing wrong? Thanks. https://paste.pound-python.org/show/Z7E2M7HUcdZAyOzWNukk/

2016-09-19 02:44:05	aneuron	[12:42:24] hey. I want to prepare python with all needed packages in virtualenv and copy it to several windows machines, and I want that it works without any installations on target computer. Just copy and run. How can I do it? [12:42:24]
2016-09-19 02:44:05	Yhg1s	[12:43:16] aneuron: you can't. virtualenvs aren't complete Python installations. Also, if you were to create a regular Python installation and install everythign in that, it wouldn't include the things Python itself needs. [12:43:16]
2016-09-19 02:44:05	bjs	[12:43:18] DKfrank_: well, how far can you get? [12:43:18]

2016-09-19 06:57:13	[Tritium]	Wulf: that is highly unlikely, but neither here nor there
2016-09-19 06:57:38	blz	Wulf, wait, actually... You probably *can* use twisted or asyncio.  They both have thread-based executors.
2016-09-19 06:57:42	[Tritium]	Wulf: hack the kernel.  Python threads are system threadfs.

2016-09-19 06:58:26	[Tritium]	wulf: they ARE pthreads
2016-09-19 06:58:29	blz	Wulf, if you're on a nix platform they *are* pthread
2016-09-19 06:58:30	papna	Wulf: pyscard releases the GIL, so it's unlikely that a multi-process architecture will buy you much in this case. (Certainly, the multiprocessing module wouldn't be wanted either way, and especially in this case, as it probably isn't necessary.)
2016-09-19 06:58:39	kosh	wake up a specific thread does not sound like the right way to use threads
2016-09-19 06:58:49	kosh	that sounds like you are just trying to cause race and lock problems

Put work that can be done by any of them into a queue and first available thread picks it. But sometimes I'd have to use a specific smartcard reader.

So for instance, rangeFor(5, 10, 3) should return [5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32], but "return [start + (x * step) for x in range(0, length)]" doesn't seem to work correctly... What am I doing wrong?

Rather than getting a list of objects which have attributes, I get a list per attribute.  This is the best way I have found to do filtering on that stuff and keeping all the lists in-sync with each other

2016-09-19 10:10:21	blz	latenite, it's both py3 and py2.  It uses the six module to maintain comptibility.  See the github issues page.
2016-09-19 10:10:21	bensh	The call to basicConfig() should come before any calls to debug(), info() etc. As it’s intended as a one-off simple configuration facility, only the first call will actually do anything: subsequent calls are effectively no-ops.
2016-09-19 10:10:33	bensh	whats the right way to change the logging level?

2016-09-19 10:23:45	CtrlC	Thanks guys.
2016-09-19 10:24:12	ipstatic	is there something special about 'rc-sysinit' being inside an array? I am trying to read in a list of services from the command (initctl list) but when I iterate over the output, the loop stops after hitting the string output that includes 'rc-sysinit'. If I skip over that item via an offset on the array, the rest of the array continues to be processed.

2016-09-19 11:34:04	dude-x	well okay Rpython, but underneath that is C
2016-09-19 11:34:05	kbdkode	I didn't mean to make everyone jump out of their seats. The reason I was using eval is because I coped 6000 lines of these trivia questions and they had to be run with exec (because someone set up it stupidly). Then I decided to do something else and it was a quick fix to just use eval.
2016-09-19 11:34:19	dude-x	is RPython self hosting?

2016-09-19 13:48:41	nedbat	argent0: scikit-learn might not declare the dependencies, and some packages are too complex to declare dependencies
2016-09-19 13:49:11	Yhg1s	In this case, it's an install-time dependency, which are even more annoying.
2016-09-19 13:49:32	_habnabit	there's ... some ways to deal with it, but in general the whole thing is a mess
2016-09-19 13:49:34	Yhg1s	(can't even ask setup.py for the dependencies, since you can't run setup.py without the dependencies ;p)
