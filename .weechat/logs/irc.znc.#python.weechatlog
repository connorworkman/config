2016-09-16 02:29:58	Yhg1s	Drexl: there isn't an easy answer for that, I'm afraid. If you specifically want to use ipython, #ipython may be able to offer more specific advice. If you just want some form of interactivity, it really depends on what processing you are doing. You could use something like twisted or asyncio to handle the communication with the terminal as well as the scheduling of your processing.
2016-09-16 02:30:11	Yhg1s	Drexl: or you could put the processing in a separate program which you launch from your terminal, for example.

2016-09-16 02:39:42	Vayl	I tried using an else: return True but it wasn't accepted as correct, whereas this one was.
2016-09-16 02:39:44	Yhg1s	Vayl: so that True is returned if the loop ends without returning False.

2016-09-16 04:42:25	gronke	I'm still in a bit of a shock that python can't modify a line in a text file, that it has to create a brand new text file, and write all the data plus the new line to the new file, then delete the old one

2016-09-16 04:44:52	papna	ReScO: It will take a bit of preprocessing because pandas' read_csv, though powerful, chokes a bit when you have extraneous whitespace between fields and quoted fields.
2016-09-16 04:44:53	gronke	so then how do I do this? I can't give it the same name, so I'd have to create a new "tmp" file, I suppose, write all the data, and once the data has finished, delete the original file and then rename my tmp file to the original name?
2016-09-16 04:45:01	_habnabit	gronke, sounds good
2016-09-16 04:45:07	noizex	are they connected? I thought that separate gevent.spawn() spawns separate thread so I only join with that one, not wait for all the other
2016-09-16 04:45:12	gronke	cool, thanks
2016-09-16 04:45:22	Yhg1s	gronke: yes, except you don't have to delete the old file. You can simply rename the new file to the old name.
2016-09-16 04:45:24	deniska	noizex: (they're not threads, but should behave kinda like them)
2016-09-16 04:45:26	Yhg1s	gronke: that way it's atomic.
2016-09-16 04:45:27	noizex	unlike having group of [t1, t2, t3] and doing joinall() on it
2016-09-16 04:45:30	simpson	gronke: More or less. To avoid the risk of destroying the original, the typical technique is *atomic renaming*; you'd write to a temp file, close the temp file, and then *rename* the temp file to the original filename.
2016-09-16 04:45:32	noizex	yeah I know, using just as a shortcut :P

2016-09-16 05:07:45	ChrisWarrick	ELFrederich: Long story short, this fucks with the global context of your module and adds defn to it
2016-09-16 05:07:46	simpson	ELFrederich: globals() is a dict representing the current global scope. Writing to it causes new names to appear out of thin air. It is *not* a good thing to use.

2016-09-16 09:25:16	sfz-	Sijmen: pylint is saying to capitalize a global variable. Since you're mutating it, it and the for loop should probably live within a function that you call. Then pylint won't complain.

2016-09-16 11:01:31	Yhg1s	kbdkode: it really depends on the iterator. Some iterators provide a size hint, which makes both cases faster, and a tuple has slightly less overhead then.
2016-09-16 11:01:31	_habnabit	Akuli, what about regression tests? do you want to document every bug you ever fixed?
2016-09-16 11:01:33	nedbat	Akuli: you don't need to document that "lol" and "" and "<weird unicode>" will raise exceptions.

2016-09-16 11:03:26	Yhg1s	Akuli: it's hard to say. It depends on how bad your tests will be.
2016-09-16 11:03:34	Akuli	like http://dpaste.com/0EQC4HJ
2016-09-16 11:03:37	pattyG	-bash: pyvenv: command not found :(
2016-09-16 11:03:52	Yhg1s	Akuli: in my experience, there isn't a tremendous differnece there, but it's your project. If you really expect to run without tests, I'm not sure doctests help.
2016-09-16 11:03:52	Akuli	like tests in general, twice as long as the code its testing
2016-09-16 11:03:56	nedbat	Akuli: doctest is better than no tests at all.  kleenex boxes are better than no shoes at all.

2016-09-16 11:04:19	pattyG	Yhg1s: it came stock on the raspberry pi i'm using (via Debian-> Raspbian "NOOBS")
2016-09-16 11:04:25	Akuli	so far unittests just seem like real shit to maintain
2016-09-16 11:04:29	_habnabit	Akuli, with py.test parameterization, it's pretty trivial to template your tests
