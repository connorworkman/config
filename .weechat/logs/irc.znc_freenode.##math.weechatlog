By Gauss if q(x) factors in Q[x] it also factors in Z[x], and since q(x) and p(x) are monic (by your added hypothesis) this forces t(x) to be integer and monic otherwise the factorization in Z[x] would be of the form [(1/a)*q(x)]*[a*t(x)] which is impossible

2016-10-17 13:15:56	Millennial	if you want to avoid this, you can say that q and p are both monic, so t is monic

In localization, we simply add the inverses as fractions with denominators, with the proviso that denominators are not in P, while in the quotient ring we make P equal zero and then we make all nonzero elements invertible by taking the field of fractions

2016-10-17 15:50:52	bobtehnoob	Cppg: As of right now, the Lagrange Interpolation is being mentioned in the textbook as a sidenote related to sets of polynomials and the replacement theorem. However, given that when solving for the basis of a polynomial space or when solving for some scalars to find some specific polynomial in a polynomial space given a basis, being able to construct a polynomial doesn't seem... particularly relevant.

2016-10-17 20:19:57	Karlo_	But for a problem of the form A*cos(x) + B*sin(x) = C, you can write K = sqrt(A^2+B^2), A/K cos(x) + B/K sin(x) = C/K

2016-10-17 20:20:23	Karlo_	You need to scale them first, so that the sum of their squares is 1.

2016-10-17 20:24:09	p0a	Hm. Whenever those equations would come up I remember there'd be at least 2 of them and you could cancel out the cos's or the sin's
2016-10-17 20:24:20	p0a	I normally wouldn't solve such an equation by itself
2016-10-17 20:24:39	p0a	i.e. C + S = 1, C - S = 2, so you add them, etc
2016-10-17 20:25:12	Karlo_	Sure, for linear equations where you have the same number of constraints as you have variables.
2016-10-17 20:25:41	Karlo_	But if you're treating C and S as the variables that you're solving for, then your second equation is "C^2 + S^2 = 1", which isn't linear.
2016-10-17 20:25:48	somiaj	SwiftMatt: another way to think about it is you have a right triangle with one leg having a length of 30 and another leg having a length of -4. Once you view your problem in terms of a triangle, you can see both what phi needs to be and what cos(phi) and sin(phi) are.

2016-10-17 20:27:28	antonfire	you can also solve the original equation by isolating one of the trig functions, squaring both sides, writing everything in terms of the other trig function, and solving the resulting quadratic, though this will typically give you some extraneous solutions.
2016-10-17 20:27:35	somiaj	SwiftMatt: and once you do that you get cos(phi) = 30/hyp, and sin(phi) = -4/hyp, where hyp is the length of the hypotenuse

2016-10-17 21:03:34	Karlo_	[06:35:23] Heh [06:35:23]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	Karlo_	[06:35:32] I'm not surprised, actually [06:35:32]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:35:39] Hi, can anyone tell me why my solution for question #2 is wrong? [06:35:39]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:35:52] https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/wjO3MEeW/sol.png [06:35:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	SwiftMatt	[06:36:56] why's that Karlo_ [06:36:56]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	Karlo_	[06:38:09] SwiftMatt, the constants just looked awkward.  I misread the 4 as 40 for that same reason. [06:38:09]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	SwiftMatt	[06:38:15] oh [06:38:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:39:21] UidX: If you got the matrices right, the idea is correct [06:39:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	Karlo_	[06:39:29] Anyway, in retrospect, the tangent half-angle formula seems to be the way to get a clean solution.  (t = tan(x/2).) [06:39:29]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:40:03] p0a: so the matrix i need to find is (matrix that changes a's to u's) * (matrix of F in the basis of a's) right? [06:40:03]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:40:15] weird, i found the correct matrices.. [06:40:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:40:38] UidX: yes that should work [06:40:38]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:41:03] changing the basis shouldnt change the eigenvalues right? [06:41:03]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:41:29] or did i get the basis changing matrix wrong [06:41:29]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:41:34] i just used the result i got from (1) [06:41:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:42:44] double check it, go through it again [06:42:44]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:43:28] the answer for #1 is correct, because it's exactly the same as the answer sheet and i checked it multiple times [06:43:28]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:43:44] i actually didnt learn the matrix to "change the basis", did i just get the entire idea wrong regarding this? [06:43:44]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:43:49] i.e. it's not the matrix there [06:43:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:45:57] Let me try solving it [06:45:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:47:07] this is the correct answer https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/yFqCg2vO/ans.png [06:47:07]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:47:35] while this is my answer https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/kJ2vdkAz/wolf.png [06:47:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	math362	[06:47:45] hello [06:47:45]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:48:13] I didn't find the same answer for the matrix of F [06:48:13]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	math362	[06:48:30] Any one to help me understand dx/dt as being causal or non causal or memoryless or has memory? [06:48:30]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:48:45] o_o what did you get for F? [06:48:45]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:49:02] you used {1, x, x^2} as the basis right [06:49:02]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:49:07] F(f) = 2(a0 + a1, a1 + a2, 2a2) [06:49:07]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:49:20] yes that's the basis I used [06:49:20]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:49:41] let me check my F real quick, i saw the same matrix as mine on the solutions manual so i didnt really check it.. [06:49:41]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:51:17] isnt F(f) = (2a0 +a1 + 2a2) + (2 a1 + 2 a2)x + (4 a2)x^2 ? [06:51:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:51:20] i get the same result [06:51:20]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	fckfreenode	[06:51:53] How can i complete the square when A != 1? [06:51:53]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:52:07] yeah you're right. I miscalculated [06:52:07]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	fckfreenode	[06:52:12] from A(x+h)^2 + k [06:52:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:52:52] fckfreenode: A(x+h)^2 + k = A( (x+h)^2 + k/A ) [06:52:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:53:07] UidX: i think your solution is correct then [06:53:07]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:53:17] :s weird, idk how my professor got his answer [06:53:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:53:18] let me look at the correct answer [06:53:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:54:00] this is the entire solution for all the questions https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/d79USnPh/complete.png [06:54:00]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:58:34] UidX: the matrices don't agree I'm trying to think why [06:58:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:59:06] i lost 23 points RIP [06:59:06]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:59:13] ugh [06:59:13]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[07:00:01] oh my matrix is just weird [07:00:01]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[07:00:09] it doesnt really change the basis does it [07:00:09]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[07:00:10] :/ [07:00:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[07:01:54] i think it does [07:01:54]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[07:03:09] the [[2,1,2],[0,2,2],[0,0,4]] has {1, x, x^2} stuff [07:03:09]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[07:03:22] but [[.5, -.5, ~~ just changes a's to u's [07:03:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[07:03:30] so it kinda makes no sense doesnt it? [07:03:30]

2016-10-17 21:37:22	sure	then you know how to solve it
2016-10-17 21:37:36	sure	or you can do as int-e, its even simpler actually
2016-10-17 21:38:05	fckfreenode	sure: hmm not entirely sure what you mean, but the factor is (4-x)^(-1/2), right?

2016-10-17 21:40:30	sure	you have an equation of the form a - b = 0
2016-10-17 21:40:34	sure	do it a = b, then a^2 = b^2

2016-10-17 21:49:38		[21:49]
2016-10-17 21:49:59	sure	yeah, then you have to verify that the solutions you found for the squared equations are also solution of the original one

2016-10-18 00:14:21	edlinde	[09:22:30] ok [09:22:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	harrynoob	[09:22:49] it doesn't seem like it cannot be true [09:22:49]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	edlinde	[09:23:02] thing is that now for higher dimensions I know that my sphere's volume is concentrated on a thin annulus near the surface of the sphere [09:23:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	edlinde	[09:23:14] so I have this empty ball in the middle you can say [09:23:14]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	edlinde	[09:24:12] and you won't find any points there to compute inner product with... so I should ideally be able to tighten the lower bound for the inner product within this sphere [09:24:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	edlinde	[09:24:23] but I don't know if its even feasible [09:24:23]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	adnauseam	[09:27:33] ello gents - ve got the following issue [09:27:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	adnauseam	[09:28:13] ive got a portfolio made of 0.5 of A and 0.5 of B, A and B are uncorrelated and normally distributed with A->Norm(2,1) and B->Norm(4,2) - now combining A and B to get the portfolio gets Z-> Norm(0.5*2 + 0.5*4, 0.5^2*1 + 0.5^2*4) ie Z-> Norm(3,1.25) - what i dont understand is how did B's Var=2 become a 4 in the convolution [09:28:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:31:42] dalcde: is there also a trick to find the normalizer of an element? I can't find one in my textbook [09:31:42]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	dalcde	[09:31:54] Not that I'm aware of. [09:31:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:32:16] So trial & error? [09:32:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	dalcde	[09:32:17] Well you know how elements in S_n act on each other by conjugation. You have a very explicit formula for it. [09:32:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:33:23] The equation of order? [09:33:23]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	dalcde	[09:34:08] I don't know what you mean by that. [09:34:08]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[09:34:27] think of an element of Sn as cycles (abcde...)()()()etc [09:34:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[09:34:40] conjugation acts on those [09:34:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:34:41] Order(G) = order(normalizer of element a) * order(conjugacy class of a) [09:34:41]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	dalcde	[09:35:18] Read what I said again. [09:35:18]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:36:19] Same cycle structure again? Conj only acts on Sn when same amount of cycles of same length in their disj writing [09:36:19]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	dalcde	[09:37:33] Let sigma and rho be elements of S_n. What does sigma rho sigma^{-1} look like? [09:37:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:39:48] Uhh also an element of S_n? [09:39:48]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[09:39:56] if u don't know its advisable that you read a book that has that stuff [09:39:56]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[09:41:52] I like Algebra - Isaacs [09:41:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:42:20] Yeah I should thanks, I'm currently just reading the textbook for this class [09:42:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	dalcde	[09:43:43] Filipino_: You really should have seen that before. [09:43:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	dalcde	[09:43:50] How did you prove that fact about conjugacy classees anyway? [09:43:50]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:45:09] Take sigma and tau conj in Sn, there exists an alpha in Sn such that alpha o sigma o alpha^(-1) = tau [09:45:09]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[09:45:33] thats the definition of conjugate [09:45:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[09:45:34] ... [09:45:34]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:48:26] Yeah then prove that tau has the same cycle structure [09:48:26]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[09:48:46] exactly. you can say more, if you write sigma in cycle notation. [09:48:46]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[09:49:22] i.e. if sigma = (s1s2...) then tau = (alpha(s1),alpha(s2)...) I think [09:49:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:49:31] Yeah [09:49:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[09:49:42] thats how you compute the normalizer [09:49:42]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:50:37] Okay thanks [09:50:37]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:50:46] I can also use that two disj cycles commute right? [09:50:46]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	mantra	[10:00:54] never forget your 2 pi i boys [10:00:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	mantra	[10:01:06] can cause serious complication [10:01:06]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[10:01:44] for a group G [10:01:44]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[10:01:55] What is Hom(G, Sn)/Inn(Sn) ? [10:01:55]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[10:02:22] It should be the n-sheet coverings of X, where G = pi_1(X,x0). But from the group-theoretic point of view, what is it? [10:02:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	harrynoob	[10:08:51] p0a: how do you form the quotient Hom(G, S_n) / Inn(S_n)? [10:08:51]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[10:10:42] harrynoob: that's a good question. it probably reveals some of my confusion [10:10:42]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[10:10:47] ill think about it now [10:10:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[10:12:02] for f:G->Sn and h in Inn(Sn), g in G, h^-1(f(g)) f(g) h(g) for all h in Inn(Sn) [10:12:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[10:12:17] h(f(g)) [10:12:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	harrynoob	[10:13:12] what do you mean by "h^-1 .. .for all h in Inn(S_n)"? how does this give me the quotient? [10:13:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[10:13:23] It's not a quotient, I just realized [10:13:23]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[10:13:32] It's just an identification of Hom(G,Sn) [10:13:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[10:13:38] "by conjugation" [10:13:38]

2016-10-18 01:23:06	Rashad	Hey. My friend wants to make a reservation system and asked for my help. Say you're a service provider that signed up on the app and want to give the app the time slots your customers are going to reserve. How would you like that to be? (I am asking in math because I guess this is fairly a mathematical problem so although I am asking about what would be the most convenient way for you to do...
2016-10-18 01:23:07	Rashad	...this job from a user point of view, you'd also probably have in mind whether such a way would be mathematically possible or not. Anyway, all input would be appreciated).

Plotting those values against the magnitude or partition of the same array gives a nice graph. It looks like the integral of the magnitude of the vector with respect to its average displacement

Then we create a set B wich is a set of all the permutations of elements in A. Then we take x samples with replacement from the set B. Then we look at only y first elements of our samples, and ask what is the probability that within a sum of all this y-length heads there

2016-10-18 05:40:55	kamog	django_: they're used almost everywhere in math. Most theorems are conditionals. Two most important ways to use them that come to my head are 1) You have antecedent (if part) being true, you have the conditional true, then you can be sure that the consequent is true (then part). It's expressed as a rule of inference called Modus ponens; 2) you know that the consequent is false and the conditional is true, then the antecedent is false

Let's say A is a necessary and sufficient condition to B, and I'm investigating the relationship between C and B and I know that for a particular case C reduces to A. Can I say that C is a necessary (but not necessarily sufficient) condition to B just because it is a generalization of A?

2016-10-18 11:11:57	baxx	 acceleration is the speed at a particular point? So that I can't take the acceleration for the interval [a,b] that I have there, because it's a range of values rather than a point... but I could take it for either 'a' or 'b' (or any other point) and it would be the gradient of the tangent line at that point.
2016-10-18 11:12:15	somiaj	baxx: acceleration is the rate of change in the speed.

2016-10-18 13:14:01	PlanckWalk	*First* it scales the vector's x component by 2.  *Then* it rotates about the z axis.

2016-10-18 13:48:07	Relonvar	Hey everyone, probably a simple question... I'm trying to solve for AP in this picture: http://imgur.com/a/08RF8 but can't seem to figure out how to solve it. I've tried using the Pythagoras Theorem to solve for various values but I always seem to end up missing values I don't know how to solve (AQ, PQ, BQ, CQ). The circles in the image are centered on AQ and AC with a diameter equal to AQ and AC, and I figure that would help figurin

2016-10-18 13:49:01	antonfire	Following up on what I said would have hopefully helped you realize the weirdness of the fact that {a,b} are not "linearly independent" and yet neither is a multiple of the other, which should make you go "what the fuck", and investigate the relationship between those two things, which would have made you look at the actual arithmetic involved more closely and see the problem.
2016-10-18 13:49:02	cyclops	SomeT: It looks like only x=2 in case of that question, but yeah
2016-10-18 13:49:23	cyclops	Build a transformation matrix T that first

2016-10-18 14:23:18	antonfire	anyway, write up all the information you have about the relationships between the angles a, b, c, etc., and you'll probably have enough to solve the system of equations.

2016-10-18 14:49:01	kewkidd	plshelp, thats a pretty tough question u got there
2016-10-18 14:49:04	antonfire	:(
2016-10-18 14:49:12	antonfire	did you mean to ask about c and d?
2016-10-18 14:49:57	antonfire	because c and d actually kind of look like they might be equal in that picture (and you're right, you shouldn't just assume that they are based on that).
2016-10-18 14:49:57		[14:49]
2016-10-18 14:49:59	tet_	yes...
2016-10-18 14:50:09	Relonvar	Koro: D in ADC should also be 90°, Q on all directions should also be 90° I think. Since I pretty much sliced the triangles in two to make right triangles (apologies for poor terminology)
2016-10-18 14:50:19	antonfire	a and b don't even look anything like each other.

2016-10-18 16:43:20	PlanckWalk	Just because it involves a lot less memorization for basic arithmetic in the first couple years of primary school
2016-10-18 16:43:35	BobSacamano	PlanckWalk: Never heard of base 6 being used before. Is the benefit that 6 has a lot of factors relative to its size?
2016-10-18 16:43:36	PlanckWalk	While still being reasonably compact for representing numbers
2016-10-18 16:44:01	PlanckWalk	And yes, having a fair few factors
2016-10-18 16:44:25	causative	having less memorization of single digit sums and products can be a downside because it makes it harder to do mental arithmetic
2016-10-18 16:45:11	PlanckWalk	I mean that there would still be memorization, but it would take a lot less time
2016-10-18 16:45:46	PlanckWalk	And would also be easier to fill in the gaps with symmetries and addition where memorization fails

2016-10-18 17:24:51	wyoung	PlanckWalk: the array is indexed by an integer :)  is there more information required?
2016-10-18 17:24:53	antonfire	"data model" is not a phrase for "how the data is stored"

2016-10-18 17:26:34	antonfire	well, considering the fourier transform preserves the L^2 norm (up to scaling), a small change to the input in the L^2 norm sense gives you only a small change in the output in the L^2 sense, so they are literally not that sensitive to perturbation in that way.

2016-10-18 17:27:19	antonfire	"preserve the pattern" doesn't mean much.
2016-10-18 17:27:34	antonfire	The fact that you want to "preserve the pattern" basically means that you want to resample, roughly speaking.
2016-10-18 17:27:44	antonfire	There are still lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of ways to do that.

2016-10-18 17:27:59	PlanckWalk	wyoung: Another question you might want to consider: do you want it to be reversible, in the sense that resampling to a larger array and back to the original size returns the data to the original form?

2016-10-18 17:32:18	antonfire	The ratio between the first two elements of [2, 2, 4, 4, 6] is the same as the ratio between the first two elements of [2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 0]. The ratios between the second and third elements are the same also, and so on, all the way up to the ratios between the fourth and fifth elements. And the sums of both those arrays are the same.
2016-10-18 17:32:18	wyoung	and which algorithm would be a good fit for me to use / base mine off?
2016-10-18 17:32:38	antonfire	So apparently you want something which, when fed the array [2, 2, 4, 4, 6], to output the array [2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 0], does that sound about right?
2016-10-18 17:32:46	PlanckWalk	wyoung: here's a start  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling
2016-10-18 17:33:33	PlanckWalk	Maybe even  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_rate_conversion,  but who knows?  Not us from what you've said so far.
2016-10-18 17:33:36	wyoung	antonfire: no, because if I want to spread it over 8 or 10 elements for example adding 0's to the end will change the pattern.  it will be a flat line at teh end instead of keeping the simular shape
2016-10-18 17:33:56	antonfire	It won't "change the pattern" in the way you described
2016-10-18 17:34:25	antonfire	because apparently by "keeping the pattern", you mean that the ratio between the first two elements should remain unchanged, and the ration between the second two should remain unchanged, and so on.
2016-10-18 17:34:25	wyoung	antonfire: it will as it won't spread the values over all of the elements, it just adds to the end of it
2016-10-18 17:34:58	antonfire	Then you should probably stop pretending that "preserve the pattern" means the thing you said about ratios being unchanged.
2016-10-18 17:35:11	wyoung	ok, so what do I mean then? I don't know maths language
2016-10-18 17:35:16	antonfire	fuck if I know!
2016-10-18 17:35:25	antonfire	What you mean is roughly that you want to resample your data.
2016-10-18 17:35:31	antonfire	There are lots of things that could actually mean.
2016-10-18 17:35:41	antonfire	Start by reading the wikipedia page PlanckWalk linked you about resampling.
2016-10-18 17:35:51	wyoung	antonfire: I want to resample without changing the sum is the primarly rule
2016-10-18 17:36:21	wyoung	(well, it may change slightly due to precision, but it shuld be reversable if possible)
2016-10-18 17:36:29	antonfire	One way to achieve that is to resample "however", and then scale the result so that its sum is the same as the sum of the original.

2016-10-18 17:38:47	antonfire	I'm not suggesting that you add 0's at the end.
2016-10-18 17:38:47		[17:38]
2016-10-18 17:39:21	antonfire	I'm demonstrating that adding 0's at the end fits the actual concrete description you gave of what you want to do, so it's probably a bad description, which you seem to understand now.
2016-10-18 17:39:44	antonfire	So good, do something other than adding 0's at the end.

2016-10-18 21:54:34	antonfire	if X_1 is the number of times that 1 occurs when you roll your n six-sided dice, then X_1 is not an indicator variable.

2016-10-18 21:55:24	antonfire	presumably you are aware that if you roll n six-sided dice, it's possible that more than one of them will display a one.
2016-10-18 21:56:14	antonfire	You seem to be asking about maybe defining some other variable Y_i = "{1 if the dice gives i, 0 otherwise}", which from the way it's written does look like an indicator variable.

2016-10-18 22:01:52	antonfire	The random variable whose value is 1 if the first thrown die displays "one" and 0 otherwise is not the same thing as the random variable whose value is 1 if the second thrown die displays "one" and 0 otherwise.

2016-10-18 23:55:21	antonfire	[07:57:30] do you mean Y_1 = 1 if at least one of these dice displays a 1, and Y_1 = 0 otherwise? [07:57:30]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	antonfire	[07:58:11] or maybe you want to talk about lots of different indicator variables, six for each die, so you end up with 6n of them? [07:58:11]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	antonfire	[07:58:45] Or maybe the phrase "{1 if the dice gives i, 0 otherwise}" was somehow supposed to express the idea of counting how many of these n dice show i? [07:58:45]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	polydo_s	[07:59:57] X_1 = {1 if the threw dice displays 1, 0 otherwise} that's how I defined it. So E[X_1] = 1/6 right ? [07:59:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	antonfire	[08:00:06] You are throwing n dice. [08:00:06]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	antonfire	[08:00:16] "the threw dice displays 1" doesn't make sense. [08:00:16]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	antonfire	[08:00:25] because which one of them are you talking about? [08:00:25]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	polydo_s	[08:00:39] Then I have to do the same for X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5, X_6 and do the some the sum of those for the dice from 1 to n [08:00:39]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	antonfire	[08:01:52] The random variable whose value is 1 if the first thrown die displays "one" and 0 otherwise is not the same thing as the random variable whose value is 1 if the second thrown die displays "one" and 0 otherwise. [08:01:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	antonfire	[08:02:18] So at this rate you are going to be talking about 6n indicator variables, not 6 of them. [08:02:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	polydo_s	[08:06:25] antonfire: What about X_ij = {1 if the i^th dice displays j, 0 otherwise} ? [08:06:25]

2016-10-18 23:55:21	sure	[08:32:13] anyone has an idea how to prove this [08:32:13]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	sure	[08:32:58] let (E,R) be a root system (so E euclidean space of finite dim, R finite set of roots, and R^+ the set of positive root with respect to a basis Delta = {alpha_1, ...., alpha_r}) [08:32:58]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	sure	[08:33:32] we define P: E -> |R by, P(H) = prod_(alpha in R^+) <alpha, H> [08:33:32]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	sure	[08:33:47] and we want to show that for all element of the weyl group w, P(w.H) = det(w) P(H) [08:33:47]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	sure	[08:36:30] it seems that it is enough to prove it with respect to the generators s_alphaj of W, because P(w.H) = P(alpha_j1 ... alpha_jk. H) = det(alphaj1) det(alpha j2) .... det (alpha jk) P(H) = det(w) P(H) [08:36:30]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	sure	[08:36:42] but even there, i have no idea how to prove it [08:36:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	sure	[08:37:03] add some s everywhere in the right of P(w.H) sorry [08:37:03]

2016-10-18 23:55:21	Noidea_	[09:20:16] i love mathematics, I do practice but I i failed in Math today ;-( [09:20:16]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:23:49] hi [09:23:49]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:25:56] Let V be a vectorspace, if rank(V)=2 then dim(V)=2 right? [09:25:56]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:26:43] V is given by a system of equations [09:26:43]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	FilipinosRich	[09:27:19] Yeah the rank of a matrix V is the dimension of the vector space spanned by it's columns [09:27:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:28:48] okay thanks then I must have some stupid mistake somewhere :/ [09:28:48]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:38:29] so let V be the set of all x=(x1,...,x6) in R^6 which solve 3 given equations. Now 3 lienarly independent vectors are given: v1,v2,v3.  I should decie if they are a basis of V. I thought: Since the rank of the system which actually spans up V is 2, we have dim(V)=2, thus 3 vectors can't be a basis. So I assume, that one of these 3 vectors does not solve the equation system - buty they all do. So, are my thought right or wrong? [09:38:29]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:40:19] i don't really understand this part "the rank of the system which actually spans up V is 2" [09:40:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:40:54] Svitkona, 1 minute [09:40:54]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	harrynoob	[09:41:17] if you have 3 linearly independent solutions v_1, v_2, v_3 to the system Ax = b, then the solution set is at least 3-dimensional [09:41:17]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:45:12] harrynoob, yeah I know but the rank is 2, thus they should be linearly indepedet, but they are not. Of course, I make a mistake somwhere. :P Svitkona http://mathb.in/95773 I meant that [09:45:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:45:52] the rank of what? [09:45:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:46:08] the matrix with v_1, v_2 and v_3 as columns? [09:46:08]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	harrynoob	[09:46:13] let me check this numerically balance [09:46:13]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:46:28] that sounds weird because then they aren't linearly independent [09:46:28]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:47:56] Svitkona, yeah I must make some stupid basic mistake somewhere. [09:47:56]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:49:13] maybe you made a mistake while row reducing [09:49:13]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:49:20] that matrix definitely has rank 3 [09:49:20]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:49:30] Svitkona, which one? [09:49:30]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	FilipinosRich	[09:49:37] The mathb.in link [09:49:37]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:49:41] hmm one sec [09:49:41]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:50:18] yeah [09:50:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	harrynoob	[09:50:20] balance: hmm, i'm getting a 4-dimensional solution space... probably numeric issues [09:50:20]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	harrynoob	[09:50:23] whatever [09:50:23]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:50:32] you mean (eq1|eq2|eq3|0|0|0)? [09:50:32]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:50:42] ok wait [09:50:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:50:58] are we talking about the coefficient matrix of that system [09:50:58]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:51:12] i thought we were talking about the matrix where you put v_1, v_2 and v_3 as columns [09:51:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:52:52] Svitkona, I'd expect both of them having the same rank. the coeff. mat is rank 2 (for me) and the one with v1,v2,v3 is 3. (which I guess I did calculate wrong somehow) [09:52:52]

2016-10-19 00:41:21	sure	[08:36:30] it seems that it is enough to prove it with respect to the generators s_alphaj of W, because P(w.H) = P(alpha_j1 ... alpha_jk. H) = det(alphaj1) det(alpha j2) .... det (alpha jk) P(H) = det(w) P(H) [08:36:30]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	sure	[08:36:42] but even there, i have no idea how to prove it [08:36:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	sure	[08:37:03] add some s everywhere in the right of P(w.H) sorry [08:37:03]

2016-10-19 00:41:21	Noidea_	[09:20:16] i love mathematics, I do practice but I i failed in Math today ;-( [09:20:16]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:23:49] hi [09:23:49]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:25:56] Let V be a vectorspace, if rank(V)=2 then dim(V)=2 right? [09:25:56]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:26:43] V is given by a system of equations [09:26:43]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	FilipinosRich	[09:27:19] Yeah the rank of a matrix V is the dimension of the vector space spanned by it's columns [09:27:19]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:28:48] okay thanks then I must have some stupid mistake somewhere :/ [09:28:48]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:38:29] so let V be the set of all x=(x1,...,x6) in R^6 which solve 3 given equations. Now 3 lienarly independent vectors are given: v1,v2,v3.  I should decie if they are a basis of V. I thought: Since the rank of the system which actually spans up V is 2, we have dim(V)=2, thus 3 vectors can't be a basis. So I assume, that one of these 3 vectors does not solve the equation system - buty they all do. So, are my thought right or wrong? [09:38:29]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:40:19] i don't really understand this part "the rank of the system which actually spans up V is 2" [09:40:19]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:40:54] Svitkona, 1 minute [09:40:54]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	harrynoob	[09:41:17] if you have 3 linearly independent solutions v_1, v_2, v_3 to the system Ax = b, then the solution set is at least 3-dimensional [09:41:17]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:45:12] harrynoob, yeah I know but the rank is 2, thus they should be linearly indepedet, but they are not. Of course, I make a mistake somwhere. :P Svitkona http://mathb.in/95773 I meant that [09:45:12]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:45:52] the rank of what? [09:45:52]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:46:08] the matrix with v_1, v_2 and v_3 as columns? [09:46:08]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	harrynoob	[09:46:13] let me check this numerically balance [09:46:13]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:46:28] that sounds weird because then they aren't linearly independent [09:46:28]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:47:56] Svitkona, yeah I must make some stupid basic mistake somewhere. [09:47:56]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:49:13] maybe you made a mistake while row reducing [09:49:13]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:49:20] that matrix definitely has rank 3 [09:49:20]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:49:30] Svitkona, which one? [09:49:30]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	FilipinosRich	[09:49:37] The mathb.in link [09:49:37]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:49:41] hmm one sec [09:49:41]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:50:18] yeah [09:50:18]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	harrynoob	[09:50:20] balance: hmm, i'm getting a 4-dimensional solution space... probably numeric issues [09:50:20]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	harrynoob	[09:50:23] whatever [09:50:23]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:50:32] you mean (eq1|eq2|eq3|0|0|0)? [09:50:32]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:50:42] ok wait [09:50:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:50:58] are we talking about the coefficient matrix of that system [09:50:58]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:51:12] i thought we were talking about the matrix where you put v_1, v_2 and v_3 as columns [09:51:12]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:52:52] Svitkona, I'd expect both of them having the same rank. the coeff. mat is rank 2 (for me) and the one with v1,v2,v3 is 3. (which I guess I did calculate wrong somehow) [09:52:52]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:56:28] harrynoob, u are actually right [09:56:28]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:58:04] yeah the coefficient matrix has rank 2 [09:58:04]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:58:07] and the other one has rank 3 [09:58:07]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[10:01:45] Svitkona, yep, that makes way more sense... thanks, lol. [10:01:45]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[10:07:38] thanks to both of you [10:07:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[10:35:38] fwiw, here's what i did http://mathb.in/95789 [10:35:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[10:36:16] i guess i don't really "fix x_1 and x_2" as much as i fix x_3, x_4, x_5 and x_6 and this determines the values of x_1 and x_2 [10:36:16]

If we now change the Basis to the Basis B' we want to also get somehow f again in respect to this new bases - lets call the transf. matrix of f in respect to B', A'. We do calculate A' using: A'=C^{-1}AC whereas C=(b_1|...|b_n) [change of basis matrix for B]. right?

2016-10-19 07:09:16	Z-module	some people use "countable" to mean that: bijectible with the set N. So then they need to use a phrase like "finite or countable", or "at most countable", when talking about sets no bigger than N.  But I think more people use "countable" to mean this (injectible into N, which includes the finite case), so then we need "countably infinite" for the infinite case specifically.

2016-10-19 08:42:41	ystael	Anthaas_: this is one of those notational issues people argue violently over. Generally if you don't use the word "proper" the word "subset" means "proper subset or equal".

2016-10-19 08:43:09	somiaj	Anthaas_: depends, some texts use \subset to mean any subset, some use it to only mean proper subset, and use \subseteq to mean any. I've seen both though forcing \subset to be a proper subset isn't all that common in my limited exporure.
2016-10-19 08:43:14	iz	what i realized though, is because it's 2^n, you can just bruteforce a smaller space by doing X mod 2^(n-5) or whatever

2016-10-19 12:24:47	illustion	I am solving the following question. Let (Omega, u) be a easure space and f in L_{3/2}(Omega,u).

2016-10-19 13:07:48	somiaj	csguest: lets do an example, lets say m=4, 4^2 - 1 = (4+1)(4-1) according to your formula, does this factoring show if 4^2 - 1 is prime or not?
2016-10-19 13:08:09	Vaelo	mmango, So you have that either a = 0 or v = 0. It would be easier to assume a != 0 and try to prove v = 0.

2016-10-19 13:41:43	brett1479	illustion, it was a reflex ... I think the sgn isn't needed
2016-10-19 13:42:27	mmango	just a really general question that's been bugging me. We only know a matrix can be reduced to reduced row eschelon (with pivots in every row) if the vectors that make up the matrix are linearly independent no?
2016-10-19 13:42:48	mmango	or at least pivots in every row until a column of free variables or a row of zeroes

2016-10-19 13:43:10	brett1479	the number of pivots is the same as the number of linearly independent columns
2016-10-19 13:43:38	mmango	gotcha
2016-10-19 13:43:54	mmango	and in an augmented matrix, using row operations should not affect the solution right?
2016-10-19 13:44:00	mmango	or is that only if the augmented column is all zeroes

2016-10-19 16:04:09	minn	I have a problem asking me to find c such that P(X < c) = 1/10, where X ~ N(12, 4). This is equivalent to c = 2 * InversePhi(9/10) + 12, where InversePhi is the quantile function of N(0, 1). However, we haven't introduced inverse CDFs in my class, and I have no idea how to compute the inverse. Is there another approach that I'm overlooking?

2016-10-19 18:02:52	somiaj	shachaf: what do you mean by the second derivative in this context. If the derivaitive of f(x,y) at the point (a,b) is a linear function. Then as you move (a,b) around you are changing your function. So this object is no longer a mapping into the real numbers (or even R^n). Its a mapping into a function space so what would its derivative mean?

Now, I know derivatives will undo indefinite integrals, but the bounds of this integral really annoy me and make me think that differentiating this will require more than just getting rid of the On top of that, integrating this is nontrivial. Can someone point me in the right direction of solving this?

2016-10-20 00:25:31	elementaru	[08:56:59] I mean... [08:56:59]
2016-10-20 00:25:31	lericson	[08:57:27] because you said B difference […] [08:57:27]
2016-10-20 00:25:31	elementaru	[08:57:42] of course... [08:57:42]
2016-10-20 00:25:31	elementaru	[08:57:44] now I get it [08:57:44]
2016-10-20 00:25:31	elementaru	[08:57:51] it minused a part of B [08:57:51]
2016-10-20 00:25:31	lericson	[08:57:53] and we didn't remove any part of B [08:57:53]
2016-10-20 00:25:31	lericson	[08:57:59] in the final result that is [08:57:59]
2016-10-20 00:25:31	elementaru	[08:58:04] yep [08:58:04]
2016-10-20 00:25:31	lericson	[08:58:21] the link Vyn gave is good, it shows a simplified logic [08:58:21]
2016-10-20 00:25:31	lericson	[08:58:23] A union B [08:58:23]
2016-10-20 00:25:31	lericson	[08:58:23] :D [08:58:23]
2016-10-20 00:25:31	elementaru	[08:58:26] A is union, so every part of A is in the final result [08:58:26]
2016-10-20 00:25:31	elementaru	[08:58:41] no matter what we "removed" before on the other side [08:58:41]
2016-10-20 00:25:31	lericson	[08:58:54] right [08:58:54]
2016-10-20 00:25:31	elementaru	[08:58:57] yes indeed, thanks guys [08:58:57]

2016-10-20 00:25:32	mxms	[09:12:53] didnt mean to highlight you [09:12:53]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	mxms	[09:13:00] how do i find the closest distance on 2x - 3y - z = 4 to the origin using basic methods for finding extrema? [09:13:00]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	mxms	[09:13:42] well, the closest point [09:13:42]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	mxms	[09:14:51] i guess each point on that plane looks like ((4 + 3y + z)/2, ((2x - 4 - z)/3, (2x - 3y - 4)) [09:14:51]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	lieven	[09:20:53] minimize x^2+y^2+z^2 with condition 2x-3y-z-4=0. you can use Lagrange multipliers or just substitute z=2x-3y-4 into the object function and differentiate wrt x and y [09:20:53]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	mxms	[09:22:20] why am i minimizing x^2 + y^2 + z^2? [09:22:20]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	mxms	[09:22:42] i guess its (x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 + (z-0)^2 and square root of that [09:22:42]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	mxms	[09:22:43] eh? [09:22:43]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	lieven	[09:22:47] the square of the distance of point (x,y,z) from the origin [09:22:47]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	mxms	[09:22:49] so then its just distance function [09:22:49]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	mxms	[09:22:51] yeah [09:22:51]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	lieven	[09:24:02] f(x)=x^2 is monotonic on R^+ so no need to bring in annoying roots [09:24:02]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	mxms	[09:24:51] woo [09:24:51]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	mxms	[09:32:21] lieven: hints on using lagrange multipliers? the exercise asks we do both :p [09:32:21]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	mxms	[09:34:11] eh nvm [09:34:11]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Veruso	[09:38:03] How can I solve ∂²u/∂w² = (∂u/∂w)²/u,  u(0,y) = y and u_x(0,y) = 3 + y ln(y) Note: v = y + 3x, w = x, x > 0 and y > 0 [09:38:03]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Veruso	[09:38:21] Its in 1 variable so it reduces to an ODE [09:38:21]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Veruso	[09:40:07] then I substituted z(u) = u', so by the chain rule u'' = zz' ==> uz' = z^2 [09:40:07]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	enthdegree	[09:51:30] how do you show a set is compact [09:51:30]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	enthdegree	[09:51:46] its \ell 2, the collection of modulus-square-summable sequences [09:51:46]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	enthdegree	[09:52:13] well, thats the space. the set i am thinking about is the collection of sequences where |x_n|\leq 1/n for each n [09:52:13]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	enthdegree	[09:52:22] (i want to show this set is compact in \ell^2) [09:52:22]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	enthdegree	[10:10:27] hi all [10:10:27]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	enthdegree	[10:10:51] how do I show that {(x_n): |x_n|<1/n} in l2 is norm-compact? [10:10:51]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	enthdegree	[10:11:17] I'm trying to slice a universal subnet into converging but can't figure out the right way to do that [10:11:17]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	enthdegree	[10:13:01] oh |x_n|^2<1/n^2 [10:13:01]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	enthdegree	[10:13:07] this is easier than i thought it was [10:13:07]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	zehdeh	[10:22:59] I am reconstructing a sphere using a linear combination of spherical harmonics evaluations. I am not evaluating the functions in equally-distributed intervals. How does that influence the quality of the reconstruction? [10:22:59]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	zehdeh	[10:24:20] I am basing this on some measured radii on a actual sphere (like I said, nonequally distributed measurements) [10:24:20]

2016-10-20 01:40:24	a____ptr	also its a morphism of C to C\{0} apparently
2016-10-20 01:40:33	a____ptr	l_coal: no not yet...
2016-10-20 01:40:35	sure	yeah but this morphism is much more ill behaved
2016-10-20 01:40:43	sure	its non injective for example

2016-10-20 01:42:07	sure	a____ptr: its nice to have different equivalent definitions for the same thing

2016-10-20 01:42:17	a____ptr	not a literal question

2016-10-20 01:42:28	a____ptr	FUCK I THOUGHT I KNEW HOW WEIRD THE REAL NUMBERS ARE
2016-10-20 01:42:53	sure	i'm wondering what are those 7 ways tho
2016-10-20 01:42:57	sure	i can only think of 3 or 4
2016-10-20 01:43:15	a____ptr	sure: limit of x->oo = (1 + n/x)^x
2016-10-20 01:43:17	a____ptr	i think is one
2016-10-20 01:43:30	l_coal	Ya, that's the compound interest one
2016-10-20 01:43:32	sure	yes this one is useful in analysis
2016-10-20 01:43:40	l_coal	Then you have the factorial one
2016-10-20 01:43:49	sure	which one is this ?
2016-10-20 01:43:54	sure	the series of exp at 1 ?

2016-10-20 01:45:22	sure	its everywhere
2016-10-20 01:45:23	sure	like pi

2016-10-20 01:46:24	a____ptr	sure: the properties e has is fucking weird

2016-10-20 01:55:05	sure	see what i mean ? :>
2016-10-20 01:55:27	Millennial	oh, i see your point
2016-10-20 01:55:30	Millennial	you mean something else
2016-10-20 01:55:43	Millennial	so you're asking "which abelian groups can be given a ring structure"
2016-10-20 01:55:46	sure	yes
2016-10-20 01:55:56	Millennial	all finitely generated abelian groups can be, trivially
2016-10-20 01:55:58	sure	but i also want to ask "is there abelian groups that cannot be given a ring structure ?"
2016-10-20 01:55:59	enthdegree	you can distinguish multiplicative and additive identities
2016-10-20 01:56:44	sure	maybe i'm actually looking for a field structure

2016-10-20 01:56:46	sure	not a ring one
2016-10-20 01:57:11	Millennial	well, if it's a field structure you will have problems with finite groups also
2016-10-20 01:57:21	Millennial	since finite fields have specific cardinalities
2016-10-20 01:57:23	sure	yes

2016-10-20 01:57:42	Millennial	and the additive group of a finite field is always (Z/pZ)^n

2016-10-20 01:58:45	Millennial	sure: there is no field whose additive group is isomorphic to Z/6Z
2016-10-20 01:58:45	sure	actually, we also use multiplicate in group theory
2016-10-20 01:58:57	Millennial	however, there is a ring whose additive group is Z/6Z: it's Z/6Z
2016-10-20 01:59:06	sure	i think you can really make sense of what it means for a law to be additive or multiplicative with that

2016-10-20 02:20:43	sure	of what additive and multiplicative means
2016-10-20 02:20:48	sure	but its strange because
2016-10-20 02:20:54	sure	if you think of exponentiation for example
2016-10-20 02:20:57	sure	we know that its not associative

2016-10-20 02:51:25	Millennial	if you have f(x) = g(x)h(x) in R[x], you can mod out by the prime P to find that x^n = \bar{g}(x) \bar{h}(x), but then unique factorization in Quot(R/P)[x] implies that \bar{g}(x) and \bar{h}(x) lack constant terms
2016-10-20 02:51:43	Millennial	so both g and h have constant terms in P, so gh = f has one in P^2
2016-10-20 02:52:18	Millennial	note that R/P is a domain, since P is a prime ideal
2016-10-20 02:52:23	Millennial	so it makes sense to talk about its fraction field

Q/Z is torsion but does not have finite exponent. If there were a unital ring structure on Q/Z, then the multiplicative identity 1 would have some finite order n. But then, since n*1 = 0, the ring would have characterisitc n, i.e., na = 0 for all elements a, which means that every element a has order at most n in Q/Z
2016-10-20 06:00:17	antonfire	You could, e.g. see why the traditional delta epsilon definition doesn't tell you that the limit as x goes to 0 of x^2 is -1.

2016-10-20 06:41:18	Cyp_	Indivicivet: To just pick random numbers with equal distribution, then discard the samples which don't fit the distribution (which can discard a lot of samples if the distribution is narrow).
2016-10-20 06:41:34	antonfire	So if your end goal is to be have some geometric picture of what the deal is, then having a not-so-geometric one is a very good place to start.
2016-10-20 06:41:42	antonfire	And having none at all is kind of a bad place to get stuck in.

2016-10-20 07:11:07	antonfire	So if you have a real reason to believe that that statement is false, then you should have a real, non-circular, reason to believe that player 1 can win the game if they play optimally.

2016-10-20 07:29:35	Vyn	Wasn't that for the unital ring case. Or did you generalize that argument?

2016-10-20 09:56:24	antonfire	A very direct analogy is that [cos t, -sin t; sin t, cos t] = exp(t [0, -1; 1, 0]), and [cosh t, sinh t; sinh t, cosh t] = exp(t [0, 1; 1, 0]).

2016-10-20 11:06:09	antonfire	So what does the fact that y is the integral of (bx-a)^-n with respect to x tell you about some derivative or another of y?
2016-10-20 11:06:25	antonfire	Once you actually figure that out, maybe start rearranging shit with the chain rule or whatever.

2016-10-20 11:39:27	finap13	i have a problem with discrete math
2016-10-20 11:39:30	meglomaniac	Indivicivet thats true, but lets say were not trying to get around this by removing points where f is undefined
2016-10-20 11:39:39	Indivicivet	meglomaniac: it doesn't exactly mke sense to say f is defined on an interval and yet not actually defined everywhere there, but you could do that, and in tht case, I would say you should indeed say it's not meaningful to talk fo the limit
2016-10-20 11:39:43	finap13	the lemmas in my book always have 20 different sets and it's hard for me to remember each one
2016-10-20 11:40:05	brett1479	meglomaniac, in a calculus course you would typically want the function defined in an interval containing the point, at least on the side you are computing the limit from

Now I am on medication and trying to feel better. I figured that a good thing to do is to start studying math more now, but it feels hard to get into it. Not necessarily to understand it but to get into the flow and enjoy it

2016-10-20 15:43:51	Z-module	It' "inherits" the property from Y.

2016-10-21 02:32:55	marxS	Cooler: if you rearrange the terms of a non convergent sum then it can often yield odd answers. Take for example 1-1+1-1-1+... which is undefined. Then if you rearrange them to (1-1)+(1-1)+... then you get 0
2016-10-21 02:33:12	marxS	Cooler: however, as we have absolute convergence in your example it allows for rearrangement

2016-10-21 02:41:48	Millennial	meglomaniac: we may choose to use the ratio test in practice
2016-10-21 02:41:58	Millennial	when it works, it can be easier to extract the radius of convergence that way
2016-10-21 02:42:17	Millennial	but there's a theorem that says that the ratio test works on a series if and only if the root test does, and they give the same results

2016-10-21 04:44:32	Millennial	the only non-obvious thing here is why linear algebra would be helpful, that is, why would you consider a graph as a matrix, specifically, rather than just a 2d array of numbers
2016-10-21 04:44:36	Millennial	and that is an interesting question
2016-10-21 04:44:49	koro	that's what a matrix is bro
2016-10-21 04:44:57	Millennial	koro: a matrix has additional structure

2016-10-21 04:46:24	koro	yes. but the matrix iself is just a 2d array of numbers as you said

2016-10-21 05:33:23	kamog	Millennial: wouldn't it work just be weakening requirements on K to be just a ring? The main job of a matrix as a linear map doesn't depend on inverses, so free modules (like K^n and K^m) are as fine as vector spaces. And identification of matrices with linear maps between arbitrary modules A and B as with aribitrary vector spaces requires two maps A -> K^m -(matrix mult)-> K^n -> B. Hmm, but then I don't know how to use
2016-10-21 05:33:23	kamog	finite-generatedness for the domain: it can yield only maps like K^n -> B.

2016-10-21 06:38:31	Z-module	As I said, you write out the entire exercise without ever using the notation A^-1
2016-10-21 06:38:33	Lerom	Z-module, I think it was a yellow book.
2016-10-21 06:38:50	drazak	carothers?
2016-10-21 06:38:51	Z-module	Lerom:  "Real Analysis" by Neil L. Carothers
2016-10-21 06:38:59	goddo2	Yeah, that's my question. How do I do that?
2016-10-21 06:39:03	LKoen	goddo2: you don't have to assume existence of A^-1. Follow Z-module's advice and don't even *use* the notation A^-1. What you have to do is look for some matrix B that satisfies the equation A B = B A = I
2016-10-21 06:39:07	Lerom	drazak, Z-module Yea thanks!
2016-10-21 06:39:25	drazak	(why is that the only yellow real analysis book I know?)
2016-10-21 06:39:44	goddo2	OK, say that we look for a matrix B such that BA = AB = I.
2016-10-21 06:39:47	Z-module	goddo2: start with the equation that A satisfies, and manipulate it. You're aiming to reach a final form of   A(some expression for a matrix here) = I
2016-10-21 06:39:52	goddo2	If we find one, that's the inverse.
2016-10-21 06:40:00	LKoen	exactly
2016-10-21 06:40:21	Z-module	you'll find that the expression that works there (the B) also works on the left of A.  That always happens, for square matrices.
2016-10-21 06:40:24	goddo2	But how do I find a such matrix without knowing its existence?
2016-10-21 06:40:53	Z-module	you play with the equation. Have you ever played with equations in variables that stand for real numbers, to solve high-school algebra types of things?

The first die has a 1/2 probability to hit one of the chosen numbers, the second has a 1/2 probability of hitting a non-chosen one, and the third as well, so it's 1/8 that you get chosen, not chosen, not chosen (CNN). Accounting for the fact that it might be NCN or NNC, which are similar, i

2016-10-21 07:58:15	Cale	You just have to think through what the possibilities are: It's 3/6 to get a hit on the first roll, and then 4/6 to get misses for the two subsequent rolls. Or you can get a miss (probability 3/6) on the first roll, a hit (still probability 3/6) on the second roll, and then the miss on the last roll with probability 4/6

2016-10-21 11:54:50	Millennial	marxS: observe that the polynomial (1 + x)^n + (1 + y)^n is symmetric under the change of variables x <-> y, so by the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials, it may be expressed as a polynomial with integer coefficients in xy and x+y
2016-10-21 11:54:50	MotivicScones	it's fixed by the action of Gal(Q(sqrt(2))/Q), so it's rational
2016-10-21 11:55:17	Millennial	for x = sqrt(2) and y = -sqrt(2), both of these values are integers
2016-10-21 11:55:33	marxS	I'm not aware of such a theorem

2016-10-21 11:56:16	Millennial	even better: it is the trace of the algebraic integer (1 + sqrt(2))^n, so it's an integer

2016-10-21 11:57:15	Millennial	you can use this to cook up a matrix A with integer entries such that the trace of A^n is exactly (1 + sqrt(2))^n + (1 - sqrt(2))^n
2016-10-21 11:57:23	Millennial	so being the trace of a matrix with integer entries, it's an integer

2016-10-21 16:50:02	finap13	when talking about groups, it just says the set, not the binary operation
2016-10-21 16:50:07	finap13	do i assume it's addition?
2016-10-21 16:51:24	Svitkona	can you provide some context?
2016-10-21 16:51:52	finap13	what, the book?

2016-10-21 16:53:03	Svitkona	but if it's (Z/nZ)* then it's probably multiplication

2016-10-21 16:54:57	Lerom	finap13, If they say just "a group", then they are probably talking about the general operator since a group is defined with a binary operator.
2016-10-21 16:55:16	finap13	rove that the circle group is a subgroup of

2016-10-21 16:55:30	finap13	thats weird
2016-10-21 16:55:53	Lerom	C* do you mean (C, *) ? Because C* has other definitions as well.
2016-10-21 16:56:19	finap13	No
2016-10-21 16:56:22	finap13	C is given as

2016-10-21 22:39:15	Vyn	I don't think there's a really general and rigorous definition
2016-10-21 22:40:03	Vyn	Okay, so here you have a combinatorial structure, the graph G

2016-10-21 22:46:36	SwiftMatt	are you sure combinatorial property isn't referring to a property that is a combination of some properties
2016-10-21 22:46:38	SwiftMatt	or something like that
2016-10-21 22:46:51	Vyn	Oh yes, I'm sure it's not that
2016-10-21 22:47:01	SwiftMatt	okay
2016-10-21 22:47:01	Vyn	There's no doubt about that
2016-10-21 22:47:08	Vyn	What's your definition of semiconnected
2016-10-21 22:47:16	SwiftMatt	so you are sure it is called that because it is being applied to a combinatorial structure
2016-10-21 22:47:22	SwiftMatt	in this case the graph or the component graph?
2016-10-21 22:47:41	SwiftMatt	A directed graph G = (V , E ) is semiconnected if, for all pairs of vertices u, v ∈ V , we have u->v or v->u.

2016-10-21 22:49:54	Vyn	SwiftMatt: That's what I'm asking. You said "u -> v or v -> u". So how do you define u -> v?
2016-10-21 22:49:55	drazak	Zakkor: yeah, rotation matrices aren't projections, so you won't find a way to do this with linear algebra
2016-10-21 22:50:04	Vyn	There is a directed path from u to v?
2016-10-21 22:50:07	SwiftMatt	yes

2016-10-22 00:41:16	Boarders	and there is something like a space (not really a space but whatever) called say Vect such that a map X---> Vect corresponds to a vector bundle
2016-10-22 00:41:18	harrynoob	Boarders: isn't sheaves kind of what you're looking for?
2016-10-22 00:41:29	harrynoob	locally attaching data to a space
2016-10-22 00:41:43	Boarders	so in a sense Vect parameterises all vector spaces (perhaps of a given dimension)
2016-10-22 00:42:09	bollu	Boarders: don't know enough diff. geo
2016-10-22 00:42:55	Boarders	yeah sorry I don't have an accessible example to hand
2016-10-22 00:42:55	bollu	Boarders: do we always need a notion of continuity to have parametrisation?
2016-10-22 00:43:05	bollu	Boarders: till now, all the parametrisation examples I've known are with curves
2016-10-22 00:43:19	Boarders	oh sorry that is sort of a different usage
2016-10-22 00:43:21	Forlorn	what do we call the k?         dividend = k * divisor + remainder
2016-10-22 00:43:48	Boarders	harrynoob: one way to make sense of local families is with types of sheaves, yeah
2016-10-22 00:44:11	harrynoob	Forlorn: "quotient"?

2016-10-22 00:45:26	harrynoob	same goes for vector bundles
2016-10-22 00:46:07	Boarders	yeah, but I was ambivalent about a context because you might want to study families in other geometric contexts
2016-10-22 00:46:16	Boarders	e.g. families of curves over a scheme or variety
2016-10-22 00:46:18	Boarders	or that kind of thing
2016-10-22 00:46:26	bollu	Boarders: hm
2016-10-22 00:46:27	bollu	I see
2016-10-22 00:46:36	Boarders	and there are different answers for what that might be so I was vague
2016-10-22 00:46:37	pedro3005	Vect = BGL_k
2016-10-22 00:46:38	bollu	Boarders: wait, what do you mean "over a variety" ?
2016-10-22 00:46:56	bollu	Boarders: an algebraic variety is the set of zeroes of a polynomial, correct?
2016-10-22 00:47:08	Boarders	pedro3005: for precisely what I was talking about yes though I really mean the stack BGL_k rather than the homotopy type
2016-10-22 00:47:25	--	u-ou is now known as no-n
2016-10-22 00:47:33	Boarders	bollu: yes, it is a type of space like that
2016-10-22 00:47:35	--	no-n is now known as u-ou
2016-10-22 00:48:03	bollu	Boarders: so how do you have a curve "over a variety"? the variety *is* the curve right?
2016-10-22 00:48:28	Boarders	well how do you have a space varying over another space
2016-10-22 00:48:45	bollu	Boarders: you give a continuous function from one to the other?
2016-10-22 00:48:46	Boarders	to each point of your space you have another space and it varies in some continuous manner
2016-10-22 00:49:11	Boarders	e.g. on a curve you can attach to each point its tangent line
2016-10-22 00:50:34	bollu	hm, I see. That's what gives you the tangent space?
2016-10-22 00:51:01	pedro3005	tangent bundle i'd guess
2016-10-22 00:51:01		[00:51]

2016-10-22 01:05:07	sure	<Boarders> bollu: in general it is interesting as a sort of 'philosophy' though: to know the intrinsic properties of an object it is enough to know its extrinsic properties i.e. we just need to know how the object relates to other objects
2016-10-22 01:05:14	sure	this lacks precision
2016-10-22 01:05:19	pedro3005	now i'm reminded of that hilbert quote about a student who quit math to become a poet. "good, he wasn't creative enough to be a mathematician"

2016-10-22 01:05:29	bollu	sure: do you have a better characteristaion?
2016-10-22 01:05:36	bollu	pedro3005: are you fooling or are you serious? :)
2016-10-22 01:05:39	sure	one should say "in order to know the n layer of intrinsinc properties of an object, it is sufficient necessary to know its extrinsinc properties up to the n-layer"
2016-10-22 01:06:03	sure	what this means is that in order to "probe" a 2nd layer of structure of y our object, you would need arrows of arrows: 2-cat
2016-10-22 01:06:03		[01:06]
2016-10-22 01:06:15	sure	so the number of layer of a structure is preserved

2016-10-22 01:06:22	sure	take Set

2016-10-22 01:06:37	sure	elements themselves are sets
2016-10-22 01:06:50	sure	what Set does, is that it can know the element throught all 1-arrows between the sets in Sets

2016-10-22 01:13:10	bollu	thanks for the explanation
2016-10-22 01:13:24	sure	it is in any case misleading, to think of Sets as set theory
2016-10-22 01:13:38	sure	you should think of Sets as "category of cardinals of set theory"
2016-10-22 01:14:13	bollu	sure: "category of cardinals of set theory"?
2016-10-22 01:14:16	sure	yes
2016-10-22 01:14:28	sure	all that Sets does is encoding the cardinality structure of set theory
2016-10-22 01:14:40	sure	isomorphism there means "two sets have the same cardinal"

2016-10-22 01:16:56	sure	for Grp, 1 = 0, so the only arrows 1 -> G is the zero arrow
2016-10-22 01:17:08	sure	you can't characterize a group entirely by looking at {f: 1 -> G}, because there is only one
2016-10-22 01:17:12	bollu	ah
2016-10-22 01:17:22	bollu	which categories have distinct 0 and 1?
2016-10-22 01:17:25	sure	so you're forced to look at every morphisms with codomain G and how they interacts within each other

2016-10-22 01:17:32	bollu	Rng
2016-10-22 01:17:41	sure	no, ring neither
2016-10-22 01:17:59	sure	because your morphisms have to preserve the identities

The problem I want to solve is to find the expected value for the index of coincidence for random text, where each character has 1/26 probability of occuring. From the defition of index of coincidence, I need the expected value for \sum_{i=0}^{25} ( f_i * (f_i - 1) ) / ( n * (n - 1) ), where f_i is how many times a character occurs. This reduces I think to finding E[f_i * (f_i -1)]. Am

2016-10-22 03:25:59	pwca	merpnderp: so, considering what I've just said, what can you say about sums of even numbers?
2016-10-22 03:27:02	merpnderp	pwca: I would say they're always even.
2016-10-22 03:27:25	pwca	merpnderp: can you prove it?
2016-10-22 03:27:39	merpnderp	pwca: that's what took me so long to resond.
2016-10-22 03:27:43	merpnderp	Was trying to think of why.
2016-10-22 03:28:25	merpnderp	well, multiplying a number is just adding it that many times.
2016-10-22 03:28:39	FreeFull	Couldn't you just use modular arithmetic?
2016-10-22 03:28:54	FreeFull	A number n is even if   n = 0 (mod 2)

2016-10-22 03:29:00	merpnderp	So if multiplying an even number results in an even, then so would adding.
2016-10-22 03:29:15	pwca	if you don't know what an even number or an integer is, you're unlikely to find modular arithmetic easier, FreeFull.
2016-10-22 03:29:31	FreeFull	Hm, true. Disregard what I said then.
2016-10-22 03:29:55	Boarders	FreeFull: how would you know modular arithmetic works without this fact in the first place?
2016-10-22 03:30:04	pwca	merpnderp: well, let 2n and 2m be your even numbers. then 2n + 2m = 2(n+m). n+m is a sum of integers, hence an integer, so 2n + 2m is on the form 2q with q an integer so it is even.
2016-10-22 03:30:35	pwca	merpnderp: you can do something similar for multiplication.
2016-10-22 03:31:09	Boarders	with multiplication you can do something better

2016-10-22 04:25:48	koro	well then is g continuous at 0?
2016-10-22 04:25:56	pythonsnake	g(0) = 1/(nx+1)
2016-10-22 04:26:14	Atque	Ruinan_Ding: It is "circled dot operator", a unicode character. It has no standard meaning within mathematics, but is sometimes used elementwise multiplication in LTSM equations.
2016-10-22 04:26:15	pythonsnake	well yes
2016-10-22 04:26:24	koro	then no problem?
2016-10-22 04:26:24	pythonsnake	koro: but g is not defined in 0
2016-10-22 04:26:35	pythonsnake	i mean f is not continuous in 0
2016-10-22 04:26:41	koro	what do you mean? both f_n and f are defined in 0

2016-10-22 04:29:05	pythonsnake	can I just derivate like that?
2016-10-22 04:29:15	koro	The formula you got for g_n in (0,1] is that of a continuous nonincreasing function
2016-10-22 04:29:21	koro	which is defined in [0,1] too
2016-10-22 04:29:41	pythonsnake	koro: so I can say it's <= g(0)?
2016-10-22 04:29:44	koro	so you CAN say g_n(x) <= g(0)
2016-10-22 04:29:56	koro	and use that to estimate |f_n(x)-f(x)| for nonzero x
2016-10-22 04:30:09	koro	for x=0 you have nothing to do since that difference is just 0
2016-10-22 04:30:34	pythonsnake	koro: wait
2016-10-22 04:30:38	pythonsnake	let's talk about n fixed
2016-10-22 04:30:45	pythonsnake	g_n(x) <= g_n(0)
2016-10-22 04:30:50	koro	i meant g_n(x) <= g_n(0), yes
2016-10-22 04:31:20	koro	so what you're concluding is that |f_n(x)-f(x)| <= g_n(0) = 1/(nx+1) when x is nonzero, and it's 0 if x =0

2016-10-22 05:25:18	antonfire	anyway, if you have a discrete function with finite difference bounded by, say, 0, then the only way to change one value of that function and retain that bound is to change all values of that function by the same amount.

2016-10-22 06:03:17	AfraidToShootStr	Vyn, porton: so in conclusion the identity requirement is there to make sure H is not empty
2016-10-22 06:03:38	Vyn	You could say that, yes
2016-10-22 06:05:16	Vyn	baxx: I still don't undertstand. You say "Is THIS a shorthand for…". Is WHAT a shorthand for?
2016-10-22 06:05:18	AfraidToShootStr	Vyn: ok that's interesting so there are two ways to go about this: either require H is non-empty and or add the requirement that the identity must be contained in H. I suppose then that an en empty subgroup is avoided entirely since it does not yield anything "interesting"

2016-10-22 09:20:33	dude12312414	ok so to summarize what I have... If d = 2, 3 (mod 4). Then if (p) splits in O_K, the homomorphism from O/(p) to Z/pZ[sqrt(d)] is not an isomorphism (otherwise O/pO would be a field), and thus sqrt(d) is in Z/pZ, i.e. x^2 = d (mod p) has a solution

2016-10-22 09:22:01	dude12312414	the converse is easier, if (p) is prime, then x^2 = d (mod p) means (x + sqrt(d))*(x - sqrt(d)) in (p) or x +/- sqrt(d) in (p) which is impossible since (x + sqrt(d))/p can not be in O_K since p != 2
2016-10-22 09:22:16	dude12312414	(the hypothesis in problem adds p does not divide 2d)

2016-10-22 10:27:22	dude12312414	if O_K is a PID then (p) prime is equivalent to p irreducible. If (p) is not inert then p = ab with N(a) = N(b) = p. In O_K, N(x + y*w) = N(x + y/2 + y/2*sqrt(-d)) = (x + y/2)^2 + d * y^2/4. But p cannot equal N(x + y*w) because p is not a perfect square so y !=0, but then N(x + y*w) >= ceil(d/4)  and p < (d + 1) / 4 = ceil((d + 1)/4)

2016-10-22 10:50:21	antonfire	you can ask a computer algebra system to work out the constant for you, and if it doesn't find an expression for it in terms of standard things like pi and e or whatever, then you probably won't find one by hand either.

So to prove pi is not constructible we need to prove it [Q(pi):Q] is not 2^n for any n... and this is kinda general already

2016-10-22 15:38:31	antonfire	Roughly speaking a bound variable in an expression is one where it doesn't even make sense to talk about "the value of this variable". For example, i is a bound variable in the summation sum_{i = 1)^n i.
2016-10-22 15:38:39	antonfire	You could use another variable in its place, and it would mean the same thing.

2016-10-22 16:36:12	Vornicus	mmango: not ... really
2016-10-22 16:36:13	antonfire	I think if you tried you would have a pretty easy time writing down an augmented matrix for which the final column doesn't have a pivot, but is still nonzero. I suggest you look for an example that's in reduced row echelon form in the first place, to make it easy to tell which columns have pivots.
2016-10-22 16:38:08	mmango	since row operations really aim to reduce the matrix (minus the augmented column) to pivots, there's no guarantee about what the augmented column will end up being right?
2016-10-22 16:38:14	antonfire	ggomsu: If you label the side lengths of those triangles with variables, you can use trigonometry and such to write down relationships between those side lengths, as equations, and then solve for those side lengths in terms of others.
2016-10-22 16:38:27	mmango	So what would the significance of the column not having a pivot be?
2016-10-22 16:38:40	antonfire	Since you know scaling doesn't change angles, you could even declare one of those segments to have whatever length you want, e.g. declare the hypotenuse of the bigger triangle to have length 1, and work out the other lengths explicitly in terms of that.
2016-10-22 16:39:03	antonfire	Once you know all the lengths in the picture, you can use them to answer the question you're interested in.

2016-10-22 16:39:59	antonfire	mmango: typically if you're doing row reduction to solve a system of linear equations, you stop before the augmented colums, and that is enough to read off the information you need.

2016-10-22 16:41:21	antonfire	but there is a pretty nice interpertation of "the augmented column has a pivot" in terms of the original system of equations, which I think becomes fairly obvious when you look at a few examples.
2016-10-22 16:41:48	antonfire	Again, when constructing examples to look at in this case, you might as well construct some that are in reduced row echelon form already.

2016-10-22 16:55:34	antonfire	It kind of does, but typically people don't bother stating and proving it that way, they just prove P(k) holds for k<=0 by using induction to show that P(-k) holds for k>=0.

Don't be too pushy, ask for advice on where to go and ask them to forward the email to other people who might be interested.

2016-10-23 03:27:48	lunatic_	purplex88: the point of euclidian division is that you work on integer and not float
2016-10-23 03:28:09	lunatic_	purplex88: so 3/7 = 0 remind 3
2016-10-23 03:28:17	picturebilly2	Hi there, I am trying to find a full explanation of the MD5 hashing algorithm, however, the original paper, wiki etc all gloss extremely quickly over it. Does anyone have a book/article/video where it is explained and an example is used? I have tried youtube etc as well, but to no avail. Any help would be much appreciated
2016-10-23 03:28:40	purplex88	i easily get remainder from 7/4 by writing on paper 4 * 1 = 4 and 7 - 4 = 3
2016-10-23 03:28:57	purplex88	how to get from 3/7 i haven't learned
2016-10-23 03:29:00	Svitkona	ok well
2016-10-23 03:29:23	PlanckWalk	purplex88: Exactly the same way
2016-10-23 03:29:29	Svitkona	7 * 0 = 0 and 3 - 0 = 3

2016-10-23 03:31:31	Svitkona	it's the same idea. given two integers a and b, you're trying to write a = bq + r for some unique integers b, r and 0 <= r < |b|

2016-10-23 05:32:18	laurus	Well it seems to be the kind of argument they're using in the first thing we discussed.
2016-10-23 05:32:30	laurus	They're sort of saying well treat this as a general function.
2016-10-23 05:32:39	OnlineDater	Any point in the image can be gotten to by a linear combo of the 2nd and 3rd columns
2016-10-23 05:32:42	laurus	And then seeing that the original pdf with its parameters must satisfy that.
2016-10-23 05:32:51	pwca	treat me like a smooth operator.

2016-10-23 08:01:55	brett1479	Z-module, did it ask for the sum or just that it converges/
2016-10-23 08:02:04	Z-module	you can get the sum now
2016-10-23 08:02:13	Z-module	but I think it only asked whether it converges
2016-10-23 08:02:22	math630	thats what i did, i added a term "+cos(n+1)" at the end of the given picture
2016-10-23 08:02:56	math630	therefore to prove it, i should get sin(n+3/2) at the top
2016-10-23 08:03:10	Svitkona	i'd rather keep that as sin((n + 1) + 1/2)

2016-10-23 08:33:03	brett1479	well, P=>Q means P is sufficient for Q, and P<=Q means Q is sufficient for P, so it depends on what they want to say is sufficient

2016-10-23 08:34:36	laurus	How could => be the "necessary" part ?
2016-10-23 08:34:53	Millennial	anderson: alternatively, n^2 < n^2 + 2 < n^2 + 2n + 1 = (n+1)^2 since n is a positive integer
2016-10-23 08:34:54	brett1479	laurus, P=>Q means Q is necessary for P
2016-10-23 08:34:55	anderson	brett1479, Yes! I spent hours not getting anywhere I can see something to do with.
2016-10-23 08:35:02	anderson	oh yea

2016-10-23 08:38:08	brett1479	laurus, P => Q means Q is necessary for P and Q => P implies P is necessary for Q

2016-10-23 09:00:04	laurus	I know it means the same as the other way... but I mean Q comes first in the gramattical statement. of it.
2016-10-23 09:00:13	laurus	brett1479: Theorem 3.5.6 Let f(�) be any pdf. Let mu be any real number, and let sigma be any positive real number. Then X is a random variable with pdf (l/sigma)f((x - mu)/sigma) if and only if there exists a mndom variable Z with pdf f(z) and X = /sigma Z + mu.

2016-10-23 09:40:00	laurus	Yes.
2016-10-23 09:40:13	laurus	I guess I'm just not used to this whole not having a normal argument thing.
2016-10-23 09:40:25	laurus	Like we usually write f(x) = x^2, not f(x - 6) = x^2.

2016-10-23 09:57:32	Trixis	Lyn: damn, that's a neat combination
2016-10-23 09:58:08	Trixis	Lyn: what kind of a degree is that
2016-10-23 09:58:27	MotivicScones	laurus: if you want. oh, also, "f(g(x)) = h(x) for all x" does determine f in more cases than where g(x) is simply equal to x for all x
2016-10-23 09:58:38	Svitkona	in physics, 1 coulomb is so monstrously large
2016-10-23 09:58:43	MotivicScones	it's a good exercise to figure out the exact conditions on g needed to recover f
2016-10-23 09:58:51	laurus	MotivicScones, okay.
2016-10-23 09:58:55	laurus	My additional question is this:
2016-10-23 09:59:11	FilipinosRich	baxx eh idk about drawing but an element of A x R would be (r1,r2) for example with r1 belonging to A and r2 to R
2016-10-23 09:59:40	mmango	ok I need to prove that any affine transformation is of the following type: if T:Rn -> Rm is affine, there exists an mxn matrix A and b in Rm such that T(x)=Ax+b for all x in Rn.
2016-10-23 09:59:41	MotivicScones	laurus: oh, also, you *can* figure out f(1) if you know f(x^2) = x^4 for all x
2016-10-23 09:59:49	mmango	So the teacher gave us some hints
2016-10-23 09:59:54	MotivicScones	but you can't figure out f(x) for all x
2016-10-23 09:59:59	mmango	And we know that T(0)=A(0)+b
2016-10-23 10:00:03	mmango	so T(0)=b
2016-10-23 10:00:05	baxx	FilipinosRich: yeah that's what i've kinda tried  to draw out i think... so it's just a rectangle of height |A| and length R
2016-10-23 10:00:11	laurus	In the above example we had X = mu + sigma Z. We were "plugging in" (X - mu) / sigma to f_Z. This variable happened to equal Z. but in the cases above it didn't. So is there anything special about plugging in the thing that happens to equal the argument in different terms, or something totally different?

2016-10-23 10:00:36	Z-module	flonk: that's not an accident, you prove it in any ring (with 1) at all, even if mutlipication isn't commutative: first, prove that 0*x = 0  for all x. Then you have  0 = 0*x = (1 + (-1))*x = 1*x + (-1)*x = x + (-1)*x, now add -x to both sides.
2016-10-23 10:00:43	baxx	because it also asks to draw R x A , which seems redundant

2016-10-23 10:21:52	Boarders	if you wanted help you should actually explain what you are asking
2016-10-23 10:21:57	eliasf	complex "whole numbers"
2016-10-23 10:22:09	eliasf	i had no idea that these weren't common terms
2016-10-23 10:22:16	mmango	MotivicScones, does that still work when we're working with affine transformations?
2016-10-23 10:22:23	eliasf	they were kind of presented as if they were
2016-10-23 10:22:33	Boarders	you had no idea that span z, w can mean many things?
2016-10-23 10:22:35	Boarders	really?
2016-10-23 10:22:35	drazak	gaussian integers is a standard term, but calling it G isn't
2016-10-23 10:22:47	MotivicScones	mmango: I didn't say anything about affine transformations, just about linear maps
2016-10-23 10:22:57	eliasf	well i didn't use the word span
2016-10-23 10:22:59	Boarders	do you know that the Gaussian integers is a euclidian domain
2016-10-23 10:23:06	Boarders	and do you know the standard proof of this fact for the integers
2016-10-23 10:23:11	drazak	Z[i] is probably the most standard presentatin because you don't really have to understand anything about them to work it out if you know what R[anything] is
2016-10-23 10:23:14	MotivicScones	mmango: the analogous statement for affine transformations is exactly the thing you're trying to prove
2016-10-23 10:23:53	eliasf	no i don't, and no i haven't tried proving it
2016-10-23 10:23:57	mmango	it just feels very strange. I understand what affine transformatinos are now. IT's basically a linear transformation translated by some value
2016-10-23 10:24:00	mmango	so the origin changes MotivicScones

2016-10-23 10:24:19	mmango	So we're basically saying the final transformation minus the amount its scaled by equals the linear transformation component of the affine transformation

2016-10-23 10:27:26	sure	an integral domain is a ring where the product of two non zero element is never zero, so 0 has no non zero divisor
2016-10-23 10:27:26	baxx	sure: not sure i got that :P
2016-10-23 10:27:46	sure	its a relatively strong condition

2016-10-23 10:27:59	mmango	A transformation that preserves the affininity (is that a word) of the input values/combinations but doesnt have to follow the same properties of a linear transformation. So the origin of the new transformation does not have to be the origin of the dimension

2016-10-23 10:34:53	pwca	baxx: whether a relation has the reflexive property depends on how you define ~.
2016-10-23 10:35:08	Svitkona	consider the following relation R on S = {1, 2, 3}: write aRb iff. a < b
2016-10-23 10:35:08	MotivicScones	mmango: still being vague.
2016-10-23 10:35:30	Svitkona	(here < is the usual order relation on the naturals)
2016-10-23 10:35:32	baxx	pwca: oh right, they've not defined it just stated that... that sucks, or is that typical? Maybe i've missed something

2016-10-23 10:35:41	mmango	is being more specific actually going to help

2016-10-23 10:36:00	MotivicScones	mmango: yes, because you can't actually prove anything until you have an actual definition to work with
2016-10-23 10:36:14	baxx	Svitkona: oh ok... so if you're using < then it would be the case that the property fails? For no a can be strictly < a ?
2016-10-23 10:36:31	MotivicScones	because the problem statement uses the words "affine transformation", and if you don't know what "affine transformation" means, you're not going to get anywhere
2016-10-23 10:36:38	Svitkona	yes
2016-10-23 10:36:43	mmango	say there's a dimension n. IN this dimension n there exists a set of vectors v1,...vk. There exists an affine combination of these vectors c1v1,...ckvk such that c1+c2+...+ck=1.
2016-10-23 10:37:01	baxx	Svitkona: so that would mean that < isn't an equivalence class?
2016-10-23 10:37:02	Svitkona	in practice you can define any relation you like
2016-10-23 10:37:02	mmango	is that good enough for affine linear combinations

But now you're saying being of the form Ax + b for some matrix A and vector b is the *definition* of affine transformation? Which is it?

2016-10-23 11:53:07	kadoban	It's at least O(n^2) comparisons, to get to the nth prime, but ... it shouldn't be Ω(n^5) comparisons. Where a comparison is "can I add this prime to this set?".
2016-10-23 11:53:34	__panda	I mean, the primes are infinite, so an upper limit doesn't necessarily make any sense
2016-10-23 11:53:37	kadoban	If it's only 4 digits, I'm guessing it'll be quite quick. I wouldn't think many sets are extendable very often.

2016-10-23 12:22:47	baxx	what does a parallel function mean? "is parallel to" ? It says "The reader is familiar with many functions such as 'less than', 'is parallel to'..." , just in teh geometric sense? Like y = 4x + 4 is parallel to y = 4x + 6 ... ?
2016-10-23 12:22:56	brett1479	laurus, f_Z is a function
2016-10-23 12:23:04	brett1479	laurus, what you plug in is a real number
2016-10-23 12:23:08	laurus	For example when they write f_Z(g^{-1}(x)) there, that seems to work because Z = g^{-1}(X).
2016-10-23 12:23:10	baxx	i'm asking incase there is context with sets or something
2016-10-23 12:23:26	antonfire	ezio: When you said "the line" in the phrase "find the distance to the line so it's the point on the line with the shortest length to BA", were you talking about the line given to you in the problem statement? This is a yes or no question.
2016-10-23 12:23:31	brett1479	laurus, does f_Z(9) make sense?
2016-10-23 12:23:34	laurus	But what if they wrote f_Z(y + j) for example and y + j had nothing to do with Z.

2016-10-23 12:30:45	laurus	my intuition says that wouldn't make sense.
2016-10-23 12:31:00	antonfire	what does "Z is only defined on positive real numbers" mean to you?
2016-10-23 12:31:07	laurus	The random variable Z can only take positive numbers.
2016-10-23 12:31:16	antonfire	then f_Z(-2) = 0
2016-10-23 12:31:25	laurus	Oh! OK.
2016-10-23 12:31:46	laurus	So then why is the formula appearing inside the ( ) always equal to the variable?

2016-10-23 12:32:11	laurus	Now I don't anymore
2016-10-23 12:32:13	antonfire	because z is one of the things that gets plugged into f_Z in the thing you're looking at.

2016-10-23 12:56:08	antonfire	If m and n are distinct primes, then the pair (m,n) does not satisfy the property you stated whenever m and n are distinct primes. Therefore there are infinitely many pairs (m,n) of integers which don's satisfy the property you stated.

2016-10-23 13:04:05	Millennial	but it's not strictly accurate
2016-10-23 13:04:05	antonfire	baxx: e.g. if you have a function f:{a,b,c,d} -> R, then you could consider the related function g:{1,2,3,4}->R given by g(i) = sum_{u in {a,b,c,d} with (i,u) in R) f(i), and the matrix M_R is the matrix of the linear transformation that sends each such f to the corresponding g.

2016-10-23 13:04:31	dude12312414	well it's not strictly the polynomials themselves. The multiplication operation is not the same as that in k[x]

2016-10-23 14:03:29	baxx	 http://imgur.com/a/6NZEs i don't get why I get [2,1] as that vector there... ? For some reason to me it seems as though it should be [1, 2] because I have [1 , 1] as the i column vector from M1, and I'm multiplying it by M2. M2 has i,j column vectors as well which as i = [0 1] and j = [2 0]. So here I have 1 * [0 1] + 1*[2 0] which is  1 * M2(i) + 1 * M2(j) , I don't see why the 1 * M2(j) is set to the x coordinate of the new vector

2016-10-23 14:24:10	halcyon	the other thing that bothers me is the Millennials of today have a huge outreach, and their message equates to someone standing in your face with a megaphone, screaming utterly obvious stuff while we all have to sit here and pretend its "like some god damn new revelation"

But, it is easier to visualize one half than two quarters because the quarters require you to draw extra lines in your mind, if you decide to visualize it as a section of a shape, for example.

2016-10-23 21:29:16	sure	being philosophically motivated to do an activity as hard as pure maths or sciences is a good  thing

2016-10-23 21:29:28	CameBach	I can't help but think mathematics is more fundamental than physics
2016-10-23 21:29:28	Svitkona	blockingthesky, also i don't know what you mean by "i can say that c = 0"
2016-10-23 21:29:34	CameBach	when dealing with reality
2016-10-23 21:29:41	a____ptr	arguing about how to morally choose who to kill with a runaway trolley
2016-10-23 21:29:46	CameBach	And which better way of dealing with reality than the abstract way
2016-10-23 21:29:57	blockingthesky	Svitkona: the polynomial passes through the origin; that's where I'm drawing that conclusion from.
2016-10-23 21:30:08	sure	mathematics is trying to explain abstractions and the phenoemnon of "abstract objects" (like shape, numbers, etc), and that's these things we use to then make sense of physicla reality
2016-10-23 21:30:12	blockingthesky	Svitkona: and I do not think that there exists such a polynomial
2016-10-23 21:30:19	sure	so surely mahtematics is more foundamental than the theory of physics
2016-10-23 21:30:25	CameBach	But do numbers even exist in reality?
2016-10-23 21:30:26	sure	as natural language is more foundamental than formal language
2016-10-23 21:30:30	Svitkona	hmm

2016-10-23 21:30:47	Svitkona	i misread the question
2016-10-23 21:30:51	blockingthesky	Svitkona: not other than P(x) = 0
2016-10-23 21:30:56	sure	it surely exists abstractly, if you recognize that "to exist abstractly" makes sense
2016-10-23 21:30:58	blockingthesky	Svitkona: I'm to prove whether it's a vector space
2016-10-23 21:31:02	sure	it surely exists formally too
2016-10-23 21:31:07	Svitkona	i thought the constant was f, not c

2016-10-23 21:31:33	CameBach	So they exist in this abstract world
2016-10-23 21:31:40	CameBach	that we invented
2016-10-23 21:31:40	sure	my philosophical views tend to think that abstraction is as part of nature as physical interaction
2016-10-23 21:31:51	sure	i can't imagine that the properties of spaces or number we think about are bound to us
2016-10-23 21:32:08	Svitkona	hmm and you said a nonzero
2016-10-23 21:32:24	sure	so if you beleive in such form of (weak) platonism, mathematicians are also trying to make sense of some part of reality
2016-10-23 21:32:33	sure	and can be considered as a science of abstraction

2016-10-23 21:32:42	sure	you also do "experiments" in mathematics
2016-10-23 21:32:43	CameBach	Do physicist care about abstraction
2016-10-23 21:32:46	MiseryMyra	CameBach: This is pretty much the core of Platonism vs. Constructivism
2016-10-23 21:32:49	CameBach	or do they care about the literal universe

2016-10-23 21:33:02	CameBach	or a mixture of both
2016-10-23 21:33:04	sure	physicists care about trying to explain what we call the physical part of the universe
2016-10-23 21:33:06	a____ptr	not to mention that the equations thrown at us during physics lecture seems so arbitrary
2016-10-23 21:33:12	sure	that is, matter, fields, space time, and how they interact
2016-10-23 21:33:14	Svitkona	ok that's slightly different

2016-10-23 21:34:08	CameBach	sure: Why do you say that?
2016-10-23 21:34:23	sure	because lots of people have the misconception that physics would be able to "explain everything"
2016-10-23 21:34:31	sure	that doesn't make any sense by a simple diagonal argument
2016-10-23 21:34:47	sure	if you were able to explain everything, then you would be able to explain why you're actually able to explain everything
2016-10-23 21:34:56	CameBach	I never thought that
2016-10-23 21:34:57	sure	physics is trying to explain "everything related to matters, fields, space and tiem"
2016-10-23 21:35:02	sure	this is probably a good definition
2016-10-23 21:35:03	CameBach	it just aims to explain all physical phenomenon
2016-10-23 21:35:06	sure	yes
2016-10-23 21:35:13	sure	and maths doesn't care about physical phenoemnon at all

2016-10-23 21:38:39	CameBach	ski: that too.. I didn't make that drawing I just found most of the topics in it very exciting
2016-10-23 21:39:00	a____ptr	i cant take geometry because i didnt do vector calculus, which is a shame
2016-10-23 21:39:12	Svitkona	blockingthesky, in fact, even if we assume that there is some 0 vector, then it still wouldn't be closed under addition since if p(x) = x^5 and q(x) = -x^5 + 1 then p(x) + q(x) = 1
2016-10-23 21:39:27	sure	CameBach: enroll into pure maths then

2016-10-23 21:39:33	sure	if you dislike it, stop after your undergrad
2016-10-23 21:39:36	Svitkona	blockingthesky, just to check, are you sure it didn't say "the set of all polynomials with degree <= 4"
2016-10-23 21:39:47	MiseryMyra	I had to take two vector calculus courses for my undergrad math program
2016-10-23 21:39:54	blockingthesky	Svitkona: "the set of all fourth-degree polynomials"
2016-10-23 21:39:55	CameBach	sure: That's what I'm thinking but this doesn't make sense.. I hated maths in highschool and liked science
2016-10-23 21:39:58	sure	studying pure maths for an undergrd is a very good school to teach rigour, abstraction, and stuff

2016-10-24 00:24:13	Nazral	but I am working with finite dimensional vector spaces over R, there is a inner product... I might as well use it

2016-10-24 05:29:48	illustion	yeah Z is actually a subspace of X

But we have  x - x'  in Z, so  0 = d(x - x') >= |d(x) - d(x')|    [I think that's a property of a seminorm, just from triangle, right?]  thus d(x) = d(x')  as needed.

2016-10-24 06:00:20	Z-module	right, I guess you know the rest, you were only wondering what  |f| <= g   means. Mostly when you see things like that, for real-valued functions on the same domain, and there's no function-space metric implied, it just means that holds pointwise.

2016-10-24 06:47:28	flamingspinach	continuation of a question I asked on friday: we established that an nxn matrix A with primitive charpoly has periodicity 2^n - 1, that is, A^{2^n - 1} = I
2016-10-24 06:47:28	flamingspinach	but now I realize that the literature I'm trying to read is claiming more -- namely that the cyclic group generated by A acts freely on the set of nonzero vectors (i.e. that starting from any nonzero vector, you have to multiply it by A a full 2^n - 1 times before it returns to the original vector)
2016-10-24 06:47:28	flamingspinach	I don't see why a priori A's period being 2^n - 1 means it ought to have this property -- the only difficulty is that the sizes of the orbits must both sum to 2^n - 1 and have 2^n - 1 as their LCM, but this doesn't seem impossible on its face...
2016-10-24 06:47:34	LKoen	well, brett's hint was: this problem is actually much simpler than it looks

2016-10-24 09:14:57	Millennial	Indivicivet: one easy way to show that is this: let's say f and g are your measurable functions, choose f_n -> f and g_n -> g simple functions, then f+g is the pointwise limit of f_n + g_n, which is simple, thus measurable
2016-10-24 09:15:01	hallberry	boarders: Exactly, only problem is, while most books use the definition with bundles of abelian groups for good reasons, I need a versions with the universal-covering-definition of twisted homology.

2016-10-24 10:44:02	jreyno40	Hi all; I’m attempting to take a floating point dataset and map it to integers while preserving the relationship between the data (of course, while losing some information). The reason for this is that I’m mapping floating point data to a neural network that has integer inputs
2016-10-24 10:44:11	jreyno40	I’m wondering if there is a good way to do this
2016-10-24 10:44:54	f0x	jreyno40, Given you have a precision-cut off (say, 5 sig figs) why not multiply by a suitably large power of 10?
2016-10-24 10:45:04	jreyno40	for instance, MFCCs are a feature vector, and mfccs follow a normal distribution. I need to take a feature vector, and map it from floating point to integer in such a manner that it preserves the relative information between the elements in the feature vector

2016-10-24 12:24:14	CameBach	It seems to me now that mathematics is capable of an artistic excellence as great as that of any music, perhaps greater; not because the pleasure it gives (although very pure) is comparable, either in intensity or in the number of people who feel it, to that of music, but because it gives in absolute perfection that combination, characteristic of great art, of godlike freedom, with the sense of inevitable destiny; because,
2016-10-24 12:24:14	CameBach	 in fact, it constructs an ideal world where everything is perfect but true.

2016-10-24 12:52:23	math077	a>0  ∫[0 to infinity] ((x^0)*e^(-ax))dx = ∫[0 to infinity] (e^(-ax))dx  Substitute u=-ax   du/dx=-a   ∫(e^(-ax))dx= ∫ (e^u) du = (-e^4)/a  u=-ax  thus -->  ( (-e^(-ax)) / a ) + C  F(∞) - F(0) =  (-e^( -infinity*a= -∞))/ a ) - (-e^0/a)  (-e^(-∞))/ a ) = 1/ -∞a= 1/ -∞ =0  -(-e^0/a)= 1/a  Thus --> F(∞) - F(0)= 0 + 1/a= 1/a  Does anyone know if this is correct?

2016-10-24 14:00:03	math077	So then this is my answer...--> e^(-ax)*x^n and my result has to be n/a ∫(x^(n-1) *e^(-ax)). I know that ∫(u dv) = uv - ∫(v du) So I get : (-e^(-ax)*x^n)/a - ∫(-e^(-ax) * (1/a) * nx^(n-1)=  (-e^(-ax)*x^n)/a + n/a ∫ x^(n-1) * e^(-ax) ---> Because [limx->inf (-e^(-ax)*x^n)/a ] - (-e^(-a0)*0^n)/a = 0 you get n/a ∫ x^(n-1) * e^(-ax)  and thus proven.

2016-10-24 14:29:32	p0a	Hijjg: spacetime has signature (3,1). This means that in spacetime, longer paths take less time. That's SR. Now if you add curvature (black holes, gravity), look at the path of light from you to the person near the black hole; it's curved. thus it takes less time for it to get there and come back; thus its faster, thus you get more input, creating the effect of "slowdown"

2016-10-24 16:59:13	Z-module	So I would write it out as:   Define  PHI: Aut(H) x Aut(K) -> Aut(H x K)  by sending the pair (phi, psi) to the map on H x K that sends (h,k) to (phi(h), psi(k)).  Check that PHI is a homomorphism, and is injective.  The final step is to use the coprime orders of things in H vs. things in K (that I described up there) to get that PHI must be surjective.

But the only interpretation I can come up with is if we're having exactly k different parts, then we place 1 ball in part, and then remaining n-k in any of k boxes. But that obviously is when both balls and boxes are distinct, so overcounts by a lot. What else could I do?

2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:46:04] but after some thought and examination, I realized it would be better to take the FFT on each component and then add up the powers [08:46:04]

2016-10-24 22:59:38	PlanckWalk	[08:49:40] Is this a 1D FFT? [08:49:40]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:51:47] what do you mean PlanckWalk [08:51:47]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:51:57] how is a FFT more than 1D [08:51:57]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:52:18] in both the Swift library and in the matlab one, both take an array in general yes [08:52:18]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:52:45] but matlab can take a matrix, which I pass it a matrix of 3 columns representing the axes [08:52:45]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:53:13] and matlab will do fft's on each column, as if I passed in each column individually I believe (95% sure how it works) [08:53:13]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	PlanckWalk	[08:53:42] Doing FFTs on 2D arrays of vectors in R^3 is very common in image processing [08:53:42]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:54:25] why are they 2D arrays? [08:54:25]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	antonfire	[08:54:30] SwiftMat_: it's not clear what you're actually summing over when you say "doing a summation on the powers..." [08:54:30]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:54:32] 2D arrays in R^3? [08:54:32]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	PlanckWalk	[08:54:47] 2D arrays of vectors, where each vector is from R^3 [08:54:47]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:55:01] what I mean antonfire is I am doing an FFT on each axis basically, then summing the powers of each of the FFTs [08:55:01]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	antonfire	[08:55:09] :( [08:55:09]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:55:11] in the frequency domain [08:55:11]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:55:18] is that clearer? [08:55:18]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	 *	dalcde [08:55:19] wonders why people keep saying FFT when they really mean DFT. [08:55:19]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	antonfire	[08:55:24] no [08:55:24]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:55:29] why is that? [08:55:29]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	antonfire	[08:55:31] what are you summing over [08:55:31]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:55:37] over the frequencies [08:55:37]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:56:01] at each frequency, whatever is going on on all 3-axes [08:56:01]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	antonfire	[08:56:04] so you end up with three numbers in the end [08:56:04]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:56:05] sum it up [08:56:05]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:56:12] no you end up with 1 number at each frequency [08:56:12]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	JX7P	[08:56:17] Mathlab [08:56:17]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	antonfire	[08:56:21] then you're not summing over the frequencies [08:56:21]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:56:29] oh [08:56:29]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:56:32] summing over the axes [08:56:32]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:57:27] so that's like a 5D structure then PlanckWalk ? [08:57:27]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	PlanckWalk	[08:57:36] No, it's not [08:57:36]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:58:23] well I'm not as much interested in whatever structure that is, as I am in how to compare these methods of determining the power at a given frequency [08:58:23]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	antonfire	[08:58:30] okay, for one thing, you seem to be taking the L^2 norms of vectors with three components in the first scenario you described (before taking a DFT), but the L^1 norms in the second scenario (after taking a DFT). [08:58:30]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:59:08] I have heard of different kinds of norms, various vector norms, and various matrix norms [08:59:08]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	antonfire	[08:59:12] Anyway, it's easy to come up with a situation where the norm of a vector doesn't change much with respect to time, but the individual components of the vector do. [08:59:12]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	SwiftMat_	[08:59:13] but what is L^1/L^2 [08:59:13]

2016-10-25 05:41:49	marloi	yes, I'm getting confused by all the change of basis going on
2016-10-25 05:41:53	f0x	If you change basis to an eigenbasis, your linear map will have a diagonal matrix
2016-10-25 05:41:55	brett1479	marloi, so the spectral theorem tells you that you can form an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors
2016-10-25 05:41:58	f0x	whose entries are the eigenvalues
2016-10-25 05:42:22	marloi	I'm also confused by M's eigenvectors vs P's eigenvectors
2016-10-25 05:42:44	brett1479	marloi, if P is that matrix of eigenvectors, then P^T computes the coordinates with respect to that basis

2016-10-25 06:53:02	nick_ett	So speaking about how I learn best, is this an okay strategy? Will I come back and prove everything in all its rigorousity and generality later? I suspect that will be done in differential geometry but not sure
2016-10-25 06:53:21	brett1479	nick_ett, depending on the course, diff geom may touch some of this

2016-10-25 07:03:33	Z-module	illustion:  there's this very handy thing about finite abelian groups. As you know from the structure theorem, such a group A is isomorphic to a finite direct product of cyclic groups of prime-power orders  (p_1)^(e_1), (p_1)^(e_2), ...,   (p_2)^(f_1), (p_2)^(f_2), ...  , ...     where the p_i are distinct primes (uniquely determined by A) and those exponents are all >= 1 but there can be repeated values among them, even within a single
2016-10-25 07:03:33	Z-module	prime base p_i, and the list of those exponents in non-increasing order for each p_i is also uniquely determined by A.  The handy fact I want you to know/remember is this: Given any single group A like that, with its corresponding invariants (p_1)^(e_1), (p_1)^(e_2), ...,   (p_2)^(f_1), (p_2)^(f_2), ...  , ...,  then the list of invariants for any subgroup or any quotient of A uses only the same primes as A's list does (some subset of
2016-10-25 07:03:33	Z-module	those) [that part is obvious, now here's the not-so-obvious part:], and ALSO:  for each single prime p occurring in both lists, say the list is  p^(e_1) >= ... >= p^(e_k)  for A  and   p^(f_1) >= ... >= p^(f_j)  for the subgroup or quotient of A, then:  j <= k  and  f_i <= e_i  for all i=1,...,j.  In your case, the full list for Z_4 x Z_8 is  2^3, 2^2   so the only possible lists for quotients or subgroups of this are:   2^3, 2^2 ;
2016-10-25 07:03:33	Z-module	2^3, 2^1 ;   2^3 ;   2^2, 2^2 ; 2^2, 2^1 ;  2^2  ;  2^1, 2^1 ;  2^1  ;   [nothing, in the case of the trivial group].

2016-10-25 11:42:05	Donald_ET3	[21:20:10] waxy: Then, I used the first vector I got from subtracting point 1 from point 2  as the X axis, and I used that cool algorithm (which might be cross multiplication) to get another vector that I can use as the Y axis because it is perpendicular to the X axis vector and the vector that is perpendicular to the plane (aka the normal vector in 3D graphics).

2016-10-25 11:42:05	brett1479_	[21:20:27] Lyn, x specific numbers, or just that the total number of distinct values is x [21:20:27]

2016-10-25 11:42:05	brett1479_	[21:22:07] marloi, since PMP is diagonal and acts on a space orthgonal to the image of P [21:22:07]
2016-10-25 11:42:05	marloi	[21:22:29] that only gives us that QMQ is diagonal wrt some basis for Q [21:22:29]

2016-10-25 11:47:18	Donald_ET3	[21:20:45] (I'm trying to do 3D graphics even though I don't know much math. Is that okay?) [21:20:45]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	waxy	[21:21:03] Donald_ET3: that's seems correct [21:21:03]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	Lyn	[21:21:07] brett1479_, the total number [21:21:07]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	marloi	[21:21:10] brett1479, I'm understand the spectral theorem proof more on a cenceptual level now: M = QMQ + PMP essentially splits the action of M into what it does to Q space and what it does to P space. How do we use this decomposition to formally show M is diagonal on the whole space? [21:21:10]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	xihiro	[21:21:16] laurus, which book is that? [21:21:16]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	laurus	[21:21:40] xihiro, it's called _Statistical Inference_ 2nd Edition by Casella and Berger, why do you ask? [21:21:40]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	brett1479_	[21:21:47] marloi, apply induction on QMQ acting on a smaller space [21:21:47]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	xihiro	[21:22:04] laurus, seems nice [21:22:04]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	brett1479_	[21:22:07] marloi, since PMP is diagonal and acts on a space orthgonal to the image of P [21:22:07]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	marloi	[21:22:29] that only gives us that QMQ is diagonal wrt some basis for Q [21:22:29]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	laurus	[21:22:39] xihiro, I would hesitantly recommend it if you're interested in the topic and have read some of the basic stuff elsewhere. [21:22:39]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	laurus	[21:22:47] I would not recommend it if you have not seen the basics of that material before. [21:22:47]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	brett1479_	[21:23:02] xihiro, it is a standard well-respected book on Stats [21:23:02]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	waxy	[21:23:43] Donald_ET3: yes it is the cross product. if you label your points o, p, q, and r, then your x axis unit vector could be x_hat = (p - o)/|| p - o || [21:23:43]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	brett1479_	[21:24:15] marloi, by induction you have M = P_1 M P_1 + P_2 M P_2 + ... + P_j M P_j decomposing M into diagonal operators acting on each eigenspace [21:24:15]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	xihiro	[21:24:16] laurus, hmm ok [21:24:16]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	waxy	[21:24:34] your normal vector, say n, would be calculated as n = (q - o) cross product x_hat. Then normalize it to get the unit vector n_hat = n / || n || [21:24:34]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	xihiro	[21:24:48] brett1479_, then which one is, besides Groot? [21:24:48]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	brett1479_	[21:24:57] marloi, if you want a full diagonal matrix, choose the basis of eigenvalues for the image of P1, then image of P2, ... [21:24:57]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	welovfree	[21:25:01] How many zeros are at the end of 100! [21:25:01]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	waxy	[21:25:11] Donald_ET3: then you can calculate the y axis as y_hat = n_hat cross product x_hat [21:25:11]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	Donald_ET3	[21:25:13] waxy: Okay, I got that. [21:25:13]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	marloi	[21:25:17] so the overall good basis for V is the union of each of those individual good basis? [21:25:17]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	brett1479_	[21:25:18] xihiro, DeGroot is a great book.  Casella and Berger is very good too [21:25:18]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	brett1479_	[21:25:41] xihiro, maybe Wasserman too [21:25:41]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	Donald_ET3	[21:25:54] waxy: So, I still have two points that need 2D coordinates. Is there a way to get from here to there, or do I need to try another approach? [21:25:54]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	Z-module	[21:25:57] welovfree: first convince yourself it must be the n where 5^n is the highest power of 5 dividing that number [21:25:57]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	brett1479_	[21:26:22] welovfree, 24 [21:26:22]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	waxy	[21:26:33] Donald_ET3: first move all the points so that your reference point is at the origin [21:26:33]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	Donald_ET3	[21:27:03] sounds good [21:27:03]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	marloi	[21:27:46] brett1479, I guess we also need to extend the basis vectors to the larger V space? [21:27:46]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	waxy	[21:28:05] then, let T be the matrix constructed by putting your x_hat, y_hat, and z_hat as columns together [21:28:05]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	Z-module	[21:28:24] so T is the standard hat-stand [21:28:24]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	waxy	[21:28:26] T = [x_hat; y_hat; z_hat] [21:28:26]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	waxy	[21:28:57] take its inverse and apply it to your other points to find their coordinate in the new frame [21:28:57]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	Donald_ET3	[21:32:13] Okay, I'll try to figure out how matrices work. I never understood how matrices could be useful when I was in highschool. [21:32:13]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	Cale	[21:35:15] Donald_ET3: In order to understand the usefulness of matrices, you should first try to understand the usefulness of linear transformations. [21:35:15]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	Cale	[21:35:54] Matrices' usefulness primarily comes from the fact that they encode entirely with a handful of numbers what a linear transformation is doing. [21:35:54]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	waxy	[21:35:59] Donald_ET3: I would recommend reading up a bit on math for computer graphics. It is really essential [21:35:59]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	waxy	[21:36:25] in any case, best of luck! [21:36:25]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	angular_mike_	[21:39:38] is statistics offtopic? [21:39:38]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	Donald_ET3	[21:41:16] I think statistics is a type of math. [21:41:16]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	angular_mike_	[21:42:49] ok [21:42:49]
2016-10-25 11:47:18	angular_mike_	[21:43:05] why is x(1)^2 considered a separate feature from x(1)? [21:43:05]

2016-10-25 15:12:23	yo____	B0073D: Oh look what I think is this, the article is great in that it gives you an outline of maths and what to learn. But if you want to be a mathematician you need to be somewhere where there are people studying that so you can like discuss your ideas and stuff (your theories)
2016-10-25 15:12:29	yo____	B0073D: what is it that you want to learn
2016-10-25 15:12:31	yo____	?
2016-10-25 15:12:32	B0073D	I've found stuctured self teaching courses can be quite good, but that's usally in applied fields, like programming, where you get feedback.
2016-10-25 15:12:41	B0073D	I want to head down the ML/AI path.
2016-10-25 15:12:44	red1	ye thats kinda what i mean
2016-10-25 15:12:57	p0a	B0073D: it's possible to learn math by yourself. ML/AI requires linear algebra for starters, start with that
2016-10-25 15:12:57	yo____	B0073D: Structured self teaching can be very efficient, i
2016-10-25 15:13:12	yo____	B0073D: I think you can reach your goal
2016-10-25 15:13:17	red1	you can play chess with a computer and read books, but if youre in a club its going to be arguably better
2016-10-25 15:13:20	red1	IMO atleast
2016-10-25 15:13:21	yo____	B0073D: is there a place where you can apply it?

2016-10-25 15:13:31	B0073D	the math?
2016-10-25 15:13:38	yo____	B0073D: yes in your job or something
2016-10-25 15:13:40	mxms	How do i generally approach differential equations which hvae functions of y? i.e. dy/dx = p(x) q(y) for example.
2016-10-25 15:13:52	B0073D	Oh not currently, but I'm hoping to head down that path career wise too.
2016-10-25 15:13:56	mxms	or a more concrete example, dy/dx = p(x) e^(y)
2016-10-25 15:14:05	B0073D	For the time being it's purely as a 'hobby'
2016-10-25 15:14:18	mxms	The one i provided i easily separable, but thats not often the case
2016-10-25 15:14:18	red1	well i suggest you go to uni if you wanna do it in a relatively short time
2016-10-25 15:14:37	B0073D	Not always an option. Maybe I'll win the lotto hehe.
2016-10-25 15:14:39	yo____	B0073D: If you want to learn ML/ AI I think you should go to a university if you are really serious, if you want for a hobby then you should go to workshops as well
2016-10-25 15:14:40	red1	whatever is it that you want to do in your field
2016-10-25 15:14:51	p0a	mxms: that's separable
2016-10-25 15:14:59	mxms	p0a: yes, but they often arent so
2016-10-25 15:14:59	B0073D	But narrowing it down to LA is probably a good start.
2016-10-25 15:15:09	B0073D	It means I can start applying and understanding.
2016-10-25 15:15:11	p0a	mxms: so dy/dx = F(x,y) ?
2016-10-25 15:15:12	B0073D	Which is a  good start.
2016-10-25 15:15:14	mxms	so perhaps that was a bad example
2016-10-25 15:15:20	red1	because you will meet people, mby they will direct you somewhere else, you will have seminars etc. meet other companies what they want how to apply etc etc..

2016-10-25 15:33:47	B0073D	[01:24:56] I haven't studied it in so long. [01:24:56]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	red1	[01:24:59] opraaa basically think of it like this: your "all" passible outcomes are how many? the first dice can have any of 6, second has any of 6 third also any of 6 so 6³ [01:24:59]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	p0a	[01:25:00] B0073D: start with something, like linear algebra or probability and go from there [01:25:00]

2016-10-25 15:33:47	p0a	[01:25:15] B0073D: I like linear algebra myself; it'll teach you a lot of things. I recommend Shilov - linear algebra [01:25:15]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	B0073D	[01:25:21] thanks for that. [01:25:21]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	B0073D	[01:25:29] I appreciate the personal recommendation. [01:25:29]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	red1	[01:25:36] and the "needed" outcomes are how many? well, anyone where all 3 numbers are the same, that is 6 (for example 1,1,1; 2,2,2... till 6,6,6) [01:25:36]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	red1	[01:25:44] so 6 outcomes by 6³ [01:25:44]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	red1	[01:25:47] = 1/36 [01:25:47]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	red1	[01:25:51] or 1/6² [01:25:51]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	red1	[01:25:58] mby you get it now? [01:25:58]

2016-10-25 15:33:47	red1	[01:26:27] basically you gotta study that "all" and "needed" outcomes or idk how you mark that up in english texts [01:26:27]
2016-10-25 15:33:47	red1	[01:26:37] i think its like N with index p [01:26:37]

2016-10-25 15:35:57	xRob_	If you guys are familiar with Java, Math.random() generates a floating-point number in the range [0, 1). How would I manipulate this randomize a number in the range [20, 40)?
2016-10-25 15:36:21	PlanckWalk	Multiply by 20 and add 20

2016-10-25 16:28:43	ollien	Stupid question about the integration by parts formula, integral of udv = uv - integral of vdu. I know that dv is equal to v'(x) * dx, but just thinking it through, the equation calls for the derivative of u with respect to v, which doesn't seem possible. I know I can substitute in in terms of x, but how is it possible for me to be taking the derivative of a function u, with respect to v, a totally different function?

In the way, you cannot define a vertex by saying it is "a point". The definition must be able to tell a vertex apart from other references that we could also call a point.

2016-10-25 23:12:14	Nazral	P(A,W) = P(A)P(W|A) = 1/2 * 3/5
2016-10-25 23:12:19	Vyn	Agreed
2016-10-25 23:12:24	Nazral	and P(W) = 10/13
2016-10-25 23:13:00	Vyn	No
2016-10-25 23:13:03	Nazral	ahhh I should have marginalized
