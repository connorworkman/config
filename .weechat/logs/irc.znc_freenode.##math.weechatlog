And then q(a) = p(a) * t(a) + r(a) is an euclidean division of q(a) and p(a) and so remainder is r(a) which has to be 0.

By Gauss if q(x) factors in Q[x] it also factors in Z[x], and since q(x) and p(x) are monic (by your added hypothesis) this forces t(x) to be integer and monic otherwise the factorization in Z[x] would be of the form [(1/a)*q(x)]*[a*t(x)] which is impossible

2016-10-17 13:15:56	Millennial	if you want to avoid this, you can say that q and p are both monic, so t is monic

In localization, we simply add the inverses as fractions with denominators, with the proviso that denominators are not in P, while in the quotient ring we make P equal zero and then we make all nonzero elements invertible by taking the field of fractions

2016-10-17 15:48:43	dude12312414	Frac(A/P) looks "smaller" than A intuitively, but I can't come up with a precise notion of what exactly is smaller...
2016-10-17 15:48:53	dude12312414	maybe there is none :/

2016-10-17 15:50:10	dude12312414	oh yeah that would make sense, I guess the mapping Frac(A) -> Frac(A/P) is surjective
2016-10-17 15:50:52	bobtehnoob	Cppg: As of right now, the Lagrange Interpolation is being mentioned in the textbook as a sidenote related to sets of polynomials and the replacement theorem. However, given that when solving for the basis of a polynomial space or when solving for some scalars to find some specific polynomial in a polynomial space given a basis, being able to construct a polynomial doesn't seem... particularly relevant.

2016-10-17 15:54:03	mada	then we're in the same boat. They probably have some more info to know how to dig into it with a bit more direction, or maybe a textbook
2016-10-17 15:54:06	Z-module	Need, we'd need to know more details on the assumed geometry of the seam. As someone ignorant of geology, I can't deduce it just from that problem statment.
2016-10-17 15:54:20	Need	Yeah I get that, I've been trying to google it
2016-10-17 15:54:26	dude12312414	so... can A_P and Frac(A/P) be seen as two special cases of something more general... or "two sides of the same coin" in a way?

2016-10-17 15:59:12	Quantumplation	Given matrix A and matrix B, and a guarantee that they represent the same linear transformation under two different bases, is there a way to find the change of basis matrix between them? In particular, A and B are not invertible.
2016-10-17 15:59:14	Cppg	gaspar: I would reccomend expressing sine and cosine as their series and then doing the computation to get another series
