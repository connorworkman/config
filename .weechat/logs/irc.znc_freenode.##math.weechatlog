2016-10-17 12:32:09	Ruka	Look at the number of applicants.
2016-10-17 12:32:16	Ruka	And the number of places available.
2016-10-17 12:32:31	wavy	is there a special term for metrics which measure the distance between two SUBSETS of a metric space rather than the elements?
2016-10-17 12:32:36	wavy	for example the hausdorff distance

2016-10-17 12:35:40	Ruka	a____ptr, What do you mean?
2016-10-17 12:36:20	a____ptr	Idk.. Cambridge is like.. One of the beat uni worldwide.. Thiught everyone would try applying there
2016-10-17 12:36:28	a____ptr	*best
2016-10-17 12:36:43	Ruka	Not for mathematics.
2016-10-17 12:36:54	mada	is that a thing? do you "learn more" than at shit universities? how much is it about the content learned and how much about pedigree?
2016-10-17 12:36:55	Ruka	Princeton, MIT, Stanford would come first.
2016-10-17 12:37:28	Ruka	Berkeley etc
2016-10-17 12:37:50	a____ptr	Ruka: yeah but it's still a pretty substantial uni

2016-10-17 12:38:02	Ruka	Top 10 def.
2016-10-17 12:38:17	Ruka	But look, at Oxford, 2013 there were 13k applicants for graduate research.
2016-10-17 12:38:31	Ruka	For mathematics, ~500 overall.
2016-10-17 12:38:39	a____ptr	Thats a lot :/
2016-10-17 12:38:42	Ruka	We are talking MSc level.
2016-10-17 12:38:54	Ruka	But it's 500 for 5 programs.
2016-10-17 12:38:57	Ruka	~100 per program.

2016-10-17 12:49:45	bobtehnoob	If V is a vector space that is generated by a set G, containing n vectors, and L is some other linearly independant subset of V containing m vectors, then you can take out some m vectors from G and replace them with V and still generate V

2016-10-17 12:51:29	bobtehnoob	The induction proof begins with the subset V containing m = 0 vectors, for which the lemma is obvious.
