And then q(a) = p(a) * t(a) + r(a) is an euclidean division of q(a) and p(a) and so remainder is r(a) which has to be 0.

By Gauss if q(x) factors in Q[x] it also factors in Z[x], and since q(x) and p(x) are monic (by your added hypothesis) this forces t(x) to be integer and monic otherwise the factorization in Z[x] would be of the form [(1/a)*q(x)]*[a*t(x)] which is impossible

2016-10-17 13:15:56	Millennial	if you want to avoid this, you can say that q and p are both monic, so t is monic
