By Gauss if q(x) factors in Q[x] it also factors in Z[x], and since q(x) and p(x) are monic (by your added hypothesis) this forces t(x) to be integer and monic otherwise the factorization in Z[x] would be of the form [(1/a)*q(x)]*[a*t(x)] which is impossible

2016-10-17 13:15:56	Millennial	if you want to avoid this, you can say that q and p are both monic, so t is monic

In localization, we simply add the inverses as fractions with denominators, with the proviso that denominators are not in P, while in the quotient ring we make P equal zero and then we make all nonzero elements invertible by taking the field of fractions

2016-10-17 15:50:52	bobtehnoob	Cppg: As of right now, the Lagrange Interpolation is being mentioned in the textbook as a sidenote related to sets of polynomials and the replacement theorem. However, given that when solving for the basis of a polynomial space or when solving for some scalars to find some specific polynomial in a polynomial space given a basis, being able to construct a polynomial doesn't seem... particularly relevant.

2016-10-17 20:19:57	Karlo_	But for a problem of the form A*cos(x) + B*sin(x) = C, you can write K = sqrt(A^2+B^2), A/K cos(x) + B/K sin(x) = C/K

2016-10-17 20:20:23	Karlo_	You need to scale them first, so that the sum of their squares is 1.

2016-10-17 20:24:09	p0a	Hm. Whenever those equations would come up I remember there'd be at least 2 of them and you could cancel out the cos's or the sin's
2016-10-17 20:24:20	p0a	I normally wouldn't solve such an equation by itself
2016-10-17 20:24:39	p0a	i.e. C + S = 1, C - S = 2, so you add them, etc
2016-10-17 20:25:12	Karlo_	Sure, for linear equations where you have the same number of constraints as you have variables.
2016-10-17 20:25:41	Karlo_	But if you're treating C and S as the variables that you're solving for, then your second equation is "C^2 + S^2 = 1", which isn't linear.
2016-10-17 20:25:48	somiaj	SwiftMatt: another way to think about it is you have a right triangle with one leg having a length of 30 and another leg having a length of -4. Once you view your problem in terms of a triangle, you can see both what phi needs to be and what cos(phi) and sin(phi) are.

2016-10-17 20:27:28	antonfire	you can also solve the original equation by isolating one of the trig functions, squaring both sides, writing everything in terms of the other trig function, and solving the resulting quadratic, though this will typically give you some extraneous solutions.
2016-10-17 20:27:35	somiaj	SwiftMatt: and once you do that you get cos(phi) = 30/hyp, and sin(phi) = -4/hyp, where hyp is the length of the hypotenuse

2016-10-17 21:03:34	Karlo_	[06:35:23] Heh [06:35:23]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	Karlo_	[06:35:32] I'm not surprised, actually [06:35:32]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:35:39] Hi, can anyone tell me why my solution for question #2 is wrong? [06:35:39]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:35:52] https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/wjO3MEeW/sol.png [06:35:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	SwiftMatt	[06:36:56] why's that Karlo_ [06:36:56]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	Karlo_	[06:38:09] SwiftMatt, the constants just looked awkward.  I misread the 4 as 40 for that same reason. [06:38:09]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	SwiftMatt	[06:38:15] oh [06:38:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:39:21] UidX: If you got the matrices right, the idea is correct [06:39:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	Karlo_	[06:39:29] Anyway, in retrospect, the tangent half-angle formula seems to be the way to get a clean solution.  (t = tan(x/2).) [06:39:29]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:40:03] p0a: so the matrix i need to find is (matrix that changes a's to u's) * (matrix of F in the basis of a's) right? [06:40:03]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:40:15] weird, i found the correct matrices.. [06:40:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:40:38] UidX: yes that should work [06:40:38]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:41:03] changing the basis shouldnt change the eigenvalues right? [06:41:03]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:41:29] or did i get the basis changing matrix wrong [06:41:29]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:41:34] i just used the result i got from (1) [06:41:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:42:44] double check it, go through it again [06:42:44]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:43:28] the answer for #1 is correct, because it's exactly the same as the answer sheet and i checked it multiple times [06:43:28]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:43:44] i actually didnt learn the matrix to "change the basis", did i just get the entire idea wrong regarding this? [06:43:44]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:43:49] i.e. it's not the matrix there [06:43:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:45:57] Let me try solving it [06:45:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:47:07] this is the correct answer https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/yFqCg2vO/ans.png [06:47:07]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:47:35] while this is my answer https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/kJ2vdkAz/wolf.png [06:47:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	math362	[06:47:45] hello [06:47:45]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:48:13] I didn't find the same answer for the matrix of F [06:48:13]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	math362	[06:48:30] Any one to help me understand dx/dt as being causal or non causal or memoryless or has memory? [06:48:30]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:48:45] o_o what did you get for F? [06:48:45]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:49:02] you used {1, x, x^2} as the basis right [06:49:02]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:49:07] F(f) = 2(a0 + a1, a1 + a2, 2a2) [06:49:07]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:49:20] yes that's the basis I used [06:49:20]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:49:41] let me check my F real quick, i saw the same matrix as mine on the solutions manual so i didnt really check it.. [06:49:41]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:51:17] isnt F(f) = (2a0 +a1 + 2a2) + (2 a1 + 2 a2)x + (4 a2)x^2 ? [06:51:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:51:20] i get the same result [06:51:20]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	fckfreenode	[06:51:53] How can i complete the square when A != 1? [06:51:53]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:52:07] yeah you're right. I miscalculated [06:52:07]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	fckfreenode	[06:52:12] from A(x+h)^2 + k [06:52:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:52:52] fckfreenode: A(x+h)^2 + k = A( (x+h)^2 + k/A ) [06:52:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:53:07] UidX: i think your solution is correct then [06:53:07]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:53:17] :s weird, idk how my professor got his answer [06:53:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:53:18] let me look at the correct answer [06:53:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:54:00] this is the entire solution for all the questions https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/d79USnPh/complete.png [06:54:00]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[06:58:34] UidX: the matrices don't agree I'm trying to think why [06:58:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:59:06] i lost 23 points RIP [06:59:06]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[06:59:13] ugh [06:59:13]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[07:00:01] oh my matrix is just weird [07:00:01]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[07:00:09] it doesnt really change the basis does it [07:00:09]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[07:00:10] :/ [07:00:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	p0a	[07:01:54] i think it does [07:01:54]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[07:03:09] the [[2,1,2],[0,2,2],[0,0,4]] has {1, x, x^2} stuff [07:03:09]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[07:03:22] but [[.5, -.5, ~~ just changes a's to u's [07:03:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:34	UidX	[07:03:30] so it kinda makes no sense doesnt it? [07:03:30]

2016-10-17 21:37:22	sure	then you know how to solve it
2016-10-17 21:37:36	sure	or you can do as int-e, its even simpler actually
2016-10-17 21:38:05	fckfreenode	sure: hmm not entirely sure what you mean, but the factor is (4-x)^(-1/2), right?

2016-10-17 21:40:30	sure	you have an equation of the form a - b = 0
2016-10-17 21:40:34	sure	do it a = b, then a^2 = b^2

2016-10-17 21:49:38		[21:49]
2016-10-17 21:49:59	sure	yeah, then you have to verify that the solutions you found for the squared equations are also solution of the original one

2016-10-18 00:14:21	edlinde	[09:22:30] ok [09:22:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	harrynoob	[09:22:49] it doesn't seem like it cannot be true [09:22:49]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	edlinde	[09:23:02] thing is that now for higher dimensions I know that my sphere's volume is concentrated on a thin annulus near the surface of the sphere [09:23:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	edlinde	[09:23:14] so I have this empty ball in the middle you can say [09:23:14]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	edlinde	[09:24:12] and you won't find any points there to compute inner product with... so I should ideally be able to tighten the lower bound for the inner product within this sphere [09:24:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	edlinde	[09:24:23] but I don't know if its even feasible [09:24:23]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	adnauseam	[09:27:33] ello gents - ve got the following issue [09:27:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	adnauseam	[09:28:13] ive got a portfolio made of 0.5 of A and 0.5 of B, A and B are uncorrelated and normally distributed with A->Norm(2,1) and B->Norm(4,2) - now combining A and B to get the portfolio gets Z-> Norm(0.5*2 + 0.5*4, 0.5^2*1 + 0.5^2*4) ie Z-> Norm(3,1.25) - what i dont understand is how did B's Var=2 become a 4 in the convolution [09:28:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:31:42] dalcde: is there also a trick to find the normalizer of an element? I can't find one in my textbook [09:31:42]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	dalcde	[09:31:54] Not that I'm aware of. [09:31:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:32:16] So trial & error? [09:32:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	dalcde	[09:32:17] Well you know how elements in S_n act on each other by conjugation. You have a very explicit formula for it. [09:32:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:33:23] The equation of order? [09:33:23]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	dalcde	[09:34:08] I don't know what you mean by that. [09:34:08]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[09:34:27] think of an element of Sn as cycles (abcde...)()()()etc [09:34:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[09:34:40] conjugation acts on those [09:34:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:34:41] Order(G) = order(normalizer of element a) * order(conjugacy class of a) [09:34:41]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	dalcde	[09:35:18] Read what I said again. [09:35:18]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:36:19] Same cycle structure again? Conj only acts on Sn when same amount of cycles of same length in their disj writing [09:36:19]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	dalcde	[09:37:33] Let sigma and rho be elements of S_n. What does sigma rho sigma^{-1} look like? [09:37:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:39:48] Uhh also an element of S_n? [09:39:48]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[09:39:56] if u don't know its advisable that you read a book that has that stuff [09:39:56]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[09:41:52] I like Algebra - Isaacs [09:41:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:42:20] Yeah I should thanks, I'm currently just reading the textbook for this class [09:42:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	dalcde	[09:43:43] Filipino_: You really should have seen that before. [09:43:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	dalcde	[09:43:50] How did you prove that fact about conjugacy classees anyway? [09:43:50]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:45:09] Take sigma and tau conj in Sn, there exists an alpha in Sn such that alpha o sigma o alpha^(-1) = tau [09:45:09]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[09:45:33] thats the definition of conjugate [09:45:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[09:45:34] ... [09:45:34]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:48:26] Yeah then prove that tau has the same cycle structure [09:48:26]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[09:48:46] exactly. you can say more, if you write sigma in cycle notation. [09:48:46]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[09:49:22] i.e. if sigma = (s1s2...) then tau = (alpha(s1),alpha(s2)...) I think [09:49:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:49:31] Yeah [09:49:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[09:49:42] thats how you compute the normalizer [09:49:42]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:50:37] Okay thanks [09:50:37]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	Filipino_	[09:50:46] I can also use that two disj cycles commute right? [09:50:46]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	mantra	[10:00:54] never forget your 2 pi i boys [10:00:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	mantra	[10:01:06] can cause serious complication [10:01:06]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[10:01:44] for a group G [10:01:44]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[10:01:55] What is Hom(G, Sn)/Inn(Sn) ? [10:01:55]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[10:02:22] It should be the n-sheet coverings of X, where G = pi_1(X,x0). But from the group-theoretic point of view, what is it? [10:02:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	harrynoob	[10:08:51] p0a: how do you form the quotient Hom(G, S_n) / Inn(S_n)? [10:08:51]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[10:10:42] harrynoob: that's a good question. it probably reveals some of my confusion [10:10:42]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[10:10:47] ill think about it now [10:10:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[10:12:02] for f:G->Sn and h in Inn(Sn), g in G, h^-1(f(g)) f(g) h(g) for all h in Inn(Sn) [10:12:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[10:12:17] h(f(g)) [10:12:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	harrynoob	[10:13:12] what do you mean by "h^-1 .. .for all h in Inn(S_n)"? how does this give me the quotient? [10:13:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[10:13:23] It's not a quotient, I just realized [10:13:23]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[10:13:32] It's just an identification of Hom(G,Sn) [10:13:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	p0a	[10:13:38] "by conjugation" [10:13:38]

2016-10-18 01:23:06	Rashad	Hey. My friend wants to make a reservation system and asked for my help. Say you're a service provider that signed up on the app and want to give the app the time slots your customers are going to reserve. How would you like that to be? (I am asking in math because I guess this is fairly a mathematical problem so although I am asking about what would be the most convenient way for you to do...
2016-10-18 01:23:07	Rashad	...this job from a user point of view, you'd also probably have in mind whether such a way would be mathematically possible or not. Anyway, all input would be appreciated).

Plotting those values against the magnitude or partition of the same array gives a nice graph. It looks like the integral of the magnitude of the vector with respect to its average displacement

Then we create a set B wich is a set of all the permutations of elements in A. Then we take x samples with replacement from the set B. Then we look at only y first elements of our samples, and ask what is the probability that within a sum of all this y-length heads there

2016-10-18 05:40:55	kamog	django_: they're used almost everywhere in math. Most theorems are conditionals. Two most important ways to use them that come to my head are 1) You have antecedent (if part) being true, you have the conditional true, then you can be sure that the consequent is true (then part). It's expressed as a rule of inference called Modus ponens; 2) you know that the consequent is false and the conditional is true, then the antecedent is false

Let's say A is a necessary and sufficient condition to B, and I'm investigating the relationship between C and B and I know that for a particular case C reduces to A. Can I say that C is a necessary (but not necessarily sufficient) condition to B just because it is a generalization of A?

2016-10-18 11:11:57	baxx	 acceleration is the speed at a particular point? So that I can't take the acceleration for the interval [a,b] that I have there, because it's a range of values rather than a point... but I could take it for either 'a' or 'b' (or any other point) and it would be the gradient of the tangent line at that point.
2016-10-18 11:12:15	somiaj	baxx: acceleration is the rate of change in the speed.

2016-10-18 13:14:01	PlanckWalk	*First* it scales the vector's x component by 2.  *Then* it rotates about the z axis.

2016-10-18 13:48:07	Relonvar	Hey everyone, probably a simple question... I'm trying to solve for AP in this picture: http://imgur.com/a/08RF8 but can't seem to figure out how to solve it. I've tried using the Pythagoras Theorem to solve for various values but I always seem to end up missing values I don't know how to solve (AQ, PQ, BQ, CQ). The circles in the image are centered on AQ and AC with a diameter equal to AQ and AC, and I figure that would help figurin

2016-10-18 13:49:01	antonfire	Following up on what I said would have hopefully helped you realize the weirdness of the fact that {a,b} are not "linearly independent" and yet neither is a multiple of the other, which should make you go "what the fuck", and investigate the relationship between those two things, which would have made you look at the actual arithmetic involved more closely and see the problem.
2016-10-18 13:49:02	cyclops	SomeT: It looks like only x=2 in case of that question, but yeah
2016-10-18 13:49:23	cyclops	Build a transformation matrix T that first

2016-10-18 14:23:18	antonfire	anyway, write up all the information you have about the relationships between the angles a, b, c, etc., and you'll probably have enough to solve the system of equations.

2016-10-18 14:49:01	kewkidd	plshelp, thats a pretty tough question u got there
2016-10-18 14:49:04	antonfire	:(
2016-10-18 14:49:12	antonfire	did you mean to ask about c and d?
2016-10-18 14:49:57	antonfire	because c and d actually kind of look like they might be equal in that picture (and you're right, you shouldn't just assume that they are based on that).
2016-10-18 14:49:57		[14:49]
2016-10-18 14:49:59	tet_	yes...
2016-10-18 14:50:09	Relonvar	Koro: D in ADC should also be 90°, Q on all directions should also be 90° I think. Since I pretty much sliced the triangles in two to make right triangles (apologies for poor terminology)
2016-10-18 14:50:19	antonfire	a and b don't even look anything like each other.

2016-10-18 16:43:20	PlanckWalk	Just because it involves a lot less memorization for basic arithmetic in the first couple years of primary school
2016-10-18 16:43:35	BobSacamano	PlanckWalk: Never heard of base 6 being used before. Is the benefit that 6 has a lot of factors relative to its size?
2016-10-18 16:43:36	PlanckWalk	While still being reasonably compact for representing numbers
2016-10-18 16:44:01	PlanckWalk	And yes, having a fair few factors
2016-10-18 16:44:25	causative	having less memorization of single digit sums and products can be a downside because it makes it harder to do mental arithmetic
2016-10-18 16:45:11	PlanckWalk	I mean that there would still be memorization, but it would take a lot less time
2016-10-18 16:45:46	PlanckWalk	And would also be easier to fill in the gaps with symmetries and addition where memorization fails

2016-10-18 17:24:51	wyoung	PlanckWalk: the array is indexed by an integer :)  is there more information required?
2016-10-18 17:24:53	antonfire	"data model" is not a phrase for "how the data is stored"

2016-10-18 17:26:34	antonfire	well, considering the fourier transform preserves the L^2 norm (up to scaling), a small change to the input in the L^2 norm sense gives you only a small change in the output in the L^2 sense, so they are literally not that sensitive to perturbation in that way.

2016-10-18 17:27:19	antonfire	"preserve the pattern" doesn't mean much.
2016-10-18 17:27:34	antonfire	The fact that you want to "preserve the pattern" basically means that you want to resample, roughly speaking.
2016-10-18 17:27:44	antonfire	There are still lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of ways to do that.

2016-10-18 17:27:59	PlanckWalk	wyoung: Another question you might want to consider: do you want it to be reversible, in the sense that resampling to a larger array and back to the original size returns the data to the original form?

2016-10-18 17:32:18	antonfire	The ratio between the first two elements of [2, 2, 4, 4, 6] is the same as the ratio between the first two elements of [2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 0]. The ratios between the second and third elements are the same also, and so on, all the way up to the ratios between the fourth and fifth elements. And the sums of both those arrays are the same.
2016-10-18 17:32:18	wyoung	and which algorithm would be a good fit for me to use / base mine off?
2016-10-18 17:32:38	antonfire	So apparently you want something which, when fed the array [2, 2, 4, 4, 6], to output the array [2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 0], does that sound about right?
2016-10-18 17:32:46	PlanckWalk	wyoung: here's a start  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling
2016-10-18 17:33:33	PlanckWalk	Maybe even  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_rate_conversion,  but who knows?  Not us from what you've said so far.
2016-10-18 17:33:36	wyoung	antonfire: no, because if I want to spread it over 8 or 10 elements for example adding 0's to the end will change the pattern.  it will be a flat line at teh end instead of keeping the simular shape
2016-10-18 17:33:56	antonfire	It won't "change the pattern" in the way you described
2016-10-18 17:34:25	antonfire	because apparently by "keeping the pattern", you mean that the ratio between the first two elements should remain unchanged, and the ration between the second two should remain unchanged, and so on.
2016-10-18 17:34:25	wyoung	antonfire: it will as it won't spread the values over all of the elements, it just adds to the end of it
2016-10-18 17:34:58	antonfire	Then you should probably stop pretending that "preserve the pattern" means the thing you said about ratios being unchanged.
2016-10-18 17:35:11	wyoung	ok, so what do I mean then? I don't know maths language
2016-10-18 17:35:16	antonfire	fuck if I know!
2016-10-18 17:35:25	antonfire	What you mean is roughly that you want to resample your data.
2016-10-18 17:35:31	antonfire	There are lots of things that could actually mean.
2016-10-18 17:35:41	antonfire	Start by reading the wikipedia page PlanckWalk linked you about resampling.
2016-10-18 17:35:51	wyoung	antonfire: I want to resample without changing the sum is the primarly rule
2016-10-18 17:36:21	wyoung	(well, it may change slightly due to precision, but it shuld be reversable if possible)
2016-10-18 17:36:29	antonfire	One way to achieve that is to resample "however", and then scale the result so that its sum is the same as the sum of the original.

2016-10-18 17:38:47	antonfire	I'm not suggesting that you add 0's at the end.
2016-10-18 17:38:47		[17:38]
2016-10-18 17:39:21	antonfire	I'm demonstrating that adding 0's at the end fits the actual concrete description you gave of what you want to do, so it's probably a bad description, which you seem to understand now.
2016-10-18 17:39:44	antonfire	So good, do something other than adding 0's at the end.

2016-10-18 21:54:34	antonfire	if X_1 is the number of times that 1 occurs when you roll your n six-sided dice, then X_1 is not an indicator variable.

2016-10-18 21:55:24	antonfire	presumably you are aware that if you roll n six-sided dice, it's possible that more than one of them will display a one.
2016-10-18 21:56:14	antonfire	You seem to be asking about maybe defining some other variable Y_i = "{1 if the dice gives i, 0 otherwise}", which from the way it's written does look like an indicator variable.

2016-10-18 22:01:52	antonfire	The random variable whose value is 1 if the first thrown die displays "one" and 0 otherwise is not the same thing as the random variable whose value is 1 if the second thrown die displays "one" and 0 otherwise.

2016-10-18 23:55:21	antonfire	[07:57:30] do you mean Y_1 = 1 if at least one of these dice displays a 1, and Y_1 = 0 otherwise? [07:57:30]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	antonfire	[07:58:11] or maybe you want to talk about lots of different indicator variables, six for each die, so you end up with 6n of them? [07:58:11]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	antonfire	[07:58:45] Or maybe the phrase "{1 if the dice gives i, 0 otherwise}" was somehow supposed to express the idea of counting how many of these n dice show i? [07:58:45]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	polydo_s	[07:59:57] X_1 = {1 if the threw dice displays 1, 0 otherwise} that's how I defined it. So E[X_1] = 1/6 right ? [07:59:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	antonfire	[08:00:06] You are throwing n dice. [08:00:06]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	antonfire	[08:00:16] "the threw dice displays 1" doesn't make sense. [08:00:16]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	antonfire	[08:00:25] because which one of them are you talking about? [08:00:25]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	polydo_s	[08:00:39] Then I have to do the same for X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5, X_6 and do the some the sum of those for the dice from 1 to n [08:00:39]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	antonfire	[08:01:52] The random variable whose value is 1 if the first thrown die displays "one" and 0 otherwise is not the same thing as the random variable whose value is 1 if the second thrown die displays "one" and 0 otherwise. [08:01:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	antonfire	[08:02:18] So at this rate you are going to be talking about 6n indicator variables, not 6 of them. [08:02:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	polydo_s	[08:06:25] antonfire: What about X_ij = {1 if the i^th dice displays j, 0 otherwise} ? [08:06:25]

2016-10-18 23:55:21	sure	[08:32:13] anyone has an idea how to prove this [08:32:13]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	sure	[08:32:58] let (E,R) be a root system (so E euclidean space of finite dim, R finite set of roots, and R^+ the set of positive root with respect to a basis Delta = {alpha_1, ...., alpha_r}) [08:32:58]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	sure	[08:33:32] we define P: E -> |R by, P(H) = prod_(alpha in R^+) <alpha, H> [08:33:32]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	sure	[08:33:47] and we want to show that for all element of the weyl group w, P(w.H) = det(w) P(H) [08:33:47]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	sure	[08:36:30] it seems that it is enough to prove it with respect to the generators s_alphaj of W, because P(w.H) = P(alpha_j1 ... alpha_jk. H) = det(alphaj1) det(alpha j2) .... det (alpha jk) P(H) = det(w) P(H) [08:36:30]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	sure	[08:36:42] but even there, i have no idea how to prove it [08:36:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	sure	[08:37:03] add some s everywhere in the right of P(w.H) sorry [08:37:03]

2016-10-18 23:55:21	Noidea_	[09:20:16] i love mathematics, I do practice but I i failed in Math today ;-( [09:20:16]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:23:49] hi [09:23:49]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:25:56] Let V be a vectorspace, if rank(V)=2 then dim(V)=2 right? [09:25:56]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:26:43] V is given by a system of equations [09:26:43]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	FilipinosRich	[09:27:19] Yeah the rank of a matrix V is the dimension of the vector space spanned by it's columns [09:27:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:28:48] okay thanks then I must have some stupid mistake somewhere :/ [09:28:48]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:38:29] so let V be the set of all x=(x1,...,x6) in R^6 which solve 3 given equations. Now 3 lienarly independent vectors are given: v1,v2,v3.  I should decie if they are a basis of V. I thought: Since the rank of the system which actually spans up V is 2, we have dim(V)=2, thus 3 vectors can't be a basis. So I assume, that one of these 3 vectors does not solve the equation system - buty they all do. So, are my thought right or wrong? [09:38:29]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:40:19] i don't really understand this part "the rank of the system which actually spans up V is 2" [09:40:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:40:54] Svitkona, 1 minute [09:40:54]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	harrynoob	[09:41:17] if you have 3 linearly independent solutions v_1, v_2, v_3 to the system Ax = b, then the solution set is at least 3-dimensional [09:41:17]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:45:12] harrynoob, yeah I know but the rank is 2, thus they should be linearly indepedet, but they are not. Of course, I make a mistake somwhere. :P Svitkona http://mathb.in/95773 I meant that [09:45:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:45:52] the rank of what? [09:45:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:46:08] the matrix with v_1, v_2 and v_3 as columns? [09:46:08]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	harrynoob	[09:46:13] let me check this numerically balance [09:46:13]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:46:28] that sounds weird because then they aren't linearly independent [09:46:28]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:47:56] Svitkona, yeah I must make some stupid basic mistake somewhere. [09:47:56]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:49:13] maybe you made a mistake while row reducing [09:49:13]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:49:20] that matrix definitely has rank 3 [09:49:20]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:49:30] Svitkona, which one? [09:49:30]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	FilipinosRich	[09:49:37] The mathb.in link [09:49:37]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:49:41] hmm one sec [09:49:41]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:50:18] yeah [09:50:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	harrynoob	[09:50:20] balance: hmm, i'm getting a 4-dimensional solution space... probably numeric issues [09:50:20]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	harrynoob	[09:50:23] whatever [09:50:23]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:50:32] you mean (eq1|eq2|eq3|0|0|0)? [09:50:32]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:50:42] ok wait [09:50:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:50:58] are we talking about the coefficient matrix of that system [09:50:58]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Svitkona	[09:51:12] i thought we were talking about the matrix where you put v_1, v_2 and v_3 as columns [09:51:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	balance	[09:52:52] Svitkona, I'd expect both of them having the same rank. the coeff. mat is rank 2 (for me) and the one with v1,v2,v3 is 3. (which I guess I did calculate wrong somehow) [09:52:52]

2016-10-19 00:41:21	sure	[08:36:30] it seems that it is enough to prove it with respect to the generators s_alphaj of W, because P(w.H) = P(alpha_j1 ... alpha_jk. H) = det(alphaj1) det(alpha j2) .... det (alpha jk) P(H) = det(w) P(H) [08:36:30]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	sure	[08:36:42] but even there, i have no idea how to prove it [08:36:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	sure	[08:37:03] add some s everywhere in the right of P(w.H) sorry [08:37:03]

2016-10-19 00:41:21	Noidea_	[09:20:16] i love mathematics, I do practice but I i failed in Math today ;-( [09:20:16]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:23:49] hi [09:23:49]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:25:56] Let V be a vectorspace, if rank(V)=2 then dim(V)=2 right? [09:25:56]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:26:43] V is given by a system of equations [09:26:43]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	FilipinosRich	[09:27:19] Yeah the rank of a matrix V is the dimension of the vector space spanned by it's columns [09:27:19]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:28:48] okay thanks then I must have some stupid mistake somewhere :/ [09:28:48]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:38:29] so let V be the set of all x=(x1,...,x6) in R^6 which solve 3 given equations. Now 3 lienarly independent vectors are given: v1,v2,v3.  I should decie if they are a basis of V. I thought: Since the rank of the system which actually spans up V is 2, we have dim(V)=2, thus 3 vectors can't be a basis. So I assume, that one of these 3 vectors does not solve the equation system - buty they all do. So, are my thought right or wrong? [09:38:29]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:40:19] i don't really understand this part "the rank of the system which actually spans up V is 2" [09:40:19]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:40:54] Svitkona, 1 minute [09:40:54]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	harrynoob	[09:41:17] if you have 3 linearly independent solutions v_1, v_2, v_3 to the system Ax = b, then the solution set is at least 3-dimensional [09:41:17]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:45:12] harrynoob, yeah I know but the rank is 2, thus they should be linearly indepedet, but they are not. Of course, I make a mistake somwhere. :P Svitkona http://mathb.in/95773 I meant that [09:45:12]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:45:52] the rank of what? [09:45:52]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:46:08] the matrix with v_1, v_2 and v_3 as columns? [09:46:08]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	harrynoob	[09:46:13] let me check this numerically balance [09:46:13]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:46:28] that sounds weird because then they aren't linearly independent [09:46:28]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:47:56] Svitkona, yeah I must make some stupid basic mistake somewhere. [09:47:56]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:49:13] maybe you made a mistake while row reducing [09:49:13]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:49:20] that matrix definitely has rank 3 [09:49:20]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:49:30] Svitkona, which one? [09:49:30]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	FilipinosRich	[09:49:37] The mathb.in link [09:49:37]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:49:41] hmm one sec [09:49:41]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:50:18] yeah [09:50:18]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	harrynoob	[09:50:20] balance: hmm, i'm getting a 4-dimensional solution space... probably numeric issues [09:50:20]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	harrynoob	[09:50:23] whatever [09:50:23]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:50:32] you mean (eq1|eq2|eq3|0|0|0)? [09:50:32]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:50:42] ok wait [09:50:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:50:58] are we talking about the coefficient matrix of that system [09:50:58]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:51:12] i thought we were talking about the matrix where you put v_1, v_2 and v_3 as columns [09:51:12]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:52:52] Svitkona, I'd expect both of them having the same rank. the coeff. mat is rank 2 (for me) and the one with v1,v2,v3 is 3. (which I guess I did calculate wrong somehow) [09:52:52]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[09:56:28] harrynoob, u are actually right [09:56:28]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:58:04] yeah the coefficient matrix has rank 2 [09:58:04]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[09:58:07] and the other one has rank 3 [09:58:07]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[10:01:45] Svitkona, yep, that makes way more sense... thanks, lol. [10:01:45]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	balance	[10:07:38] thanks to both of you [10:07:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[10:35:38] fwiw, here's what i did http://mathb.in/95789 [10:35:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:21	Svitkona	[10:36:16] i guess i don't really "fix x_1 and x_2" as much as i fix x_3, x_4, x_5 and x_6 and this determines the values of x_1 and x_2 [10:36:16]

If we now change the Basis to the Basis B' we want to also get somehow f again in respect to this new bases - lets call the transf. matrix of f in respect to B', A'. We do calculate A' using: A'=C^{-1}AC whereas C=(b_1|...|b_n) [change of basis matrix for B]. right?

2016-10-19 07:09:16	Z-module	some people use "countable" to mean that: bijectible with the set N. So then they need to use a phrase like "finite or countable", or "at most countable", when talking about sets no bigger than N.  But I think more people use "countable" to mean this (injectible into N, which includes the finite case), so then we need "countably infinite" for the infinite case specifically.

2016-10-19 08:42:41	ystael	Anthaas_: this is one of those notational issues people argue violently over. Generally if you don't use the word "proper" the word "subset" means "proper subset or equal".

2016-10-19 08:43:09	somiaj	Anthaas_: depends, some texts use \subset to mean any subset, some use it to only mean proper subset, and use \subseteq to mean any. I've seen both though forcing \subset to be a proper subset isn't all that common in my limited exporure.
2016-10-19 08:43:14	iz	what i realized though, is because it's 2^n, you can just bruteforce a smaller space by doing X mod 2^(n-5) or whatever

2016-10-19 12:24:47	illustion	I am solving the following question. Let (Omega, u) be a easure space and f in L_{3/2}(Omega,u).

2016-10-19 13:07:48	somiaj	csguest: lets do an example, lets say m=4, 4^2 - 1 = (4+1)(4-1) according to your formula, does this factoring show if 4^2 - 1 is prime or not?
2016-10-19 13:08:09	Vaelo	mmango, So you have that either a = 0 or v = 0. It would be easier to assume a != 0 and try to prove v = 0.

2016-10-19 13:41:43	brett1479	illustion, it was a reflex ... I think the sgn isn't needed
2016-10-19 13:42:27	mmango	just a really general question that's been bugging me. We only know a matrix can be reduced to reduced row eschelon (with pivots in every row) if the vectors that make up the matrix are linearly independent no?
2016-10-19 13:42:48	mmango	or at least pivots in every row until a column of free variables or a row of zeroes

2016-10-19 13:43:05	wyoung	sup?
2016-10-19 13:43:10	brett1479	the number of pivots is the same as the number of linearly independent columns
2016-10-19 13:43:38	mmango	gotcha
2016-10-19 13:43:54	mmango	and in an augmented matrix, using row operations should not affect the solution right?
2016-10-19 13:44:00	mmango	or is that only if the augmented column is all zeroes

2016-10-19 13:44:27	brett1479	row operations will not effect the solution, correct
2016-10-19 13:44:42	somiaj	they can help find it, hence the use of an augmented matrix
2016-10-19 13:44:45	brett1479	valid row operations, that is
2016-10-19 13:44:52	illustion	brett1479: yes so if we have g defined that way the int( |fg| du) = int( |f|^3/2 du) so we must have ||T|| < ||f||
2016-10-19 13:45:15	brett1479	illustion, what is ||Tg||/||g|| in that case?
