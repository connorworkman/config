2016-09-10 02:46:07	Montop	Now just to be sure, is it safe to remove everything except the gentoo entry and manjaro (which I'll keep until finished)? There's a bunch of lan stuff etc there.

2016-09-10 03:09:36	maolang	from your antergos you can and probably should run the grub create line to add trhe gentoo entry to your antergos boot menu, sometimes when entries dont create properly from chroot environment creating in host system work to boot it off, then once booted you ryun the grub create line again from the running system to fix it from inside  once you are in

2016-09-10 08:15:13	blackflow	I'm using genkernel to create an initramfs for root luks support, otherwise the kernel is configured manually. The part I don't understand is how to set the LUKS name. It seems genkernel defaults to /dev/mapper/root, and looking at the source, REAL_ROOT should be able to change that, but it doesn't. I've set REAL_ROOT to /dev/mapper/sda3_crypt in genkernel.conf, but it still mounts to /dev/mapper/root.

2016-09-10 11:40:51	username234	harwiltz: keeping the USE flags unset allows you to update packages.
2016-09-10 11:41:07	iflema	there would have to be a better guide at least in someones head...
2016-09-10 11:41:18	wip_	harwiltz: both ways work just fine, the handbook mostly focus on getting your system up and running as quick as possible
2016-09-10 11:41:25	username234	if you set your USE flags you're likely to pick up dependent packages that will fail to build until after your system is setup.

2016-09-10 11:42:38	 *	mollox < works for < handbook
2016-09-10 11:43:47	harwiltz	Next question. The next step in my install is kernel configuration. It is recommended that I configure the kernel manually (rather than using genkernel). Other than the extra customization, is there a significant performance increase associated with configuring the kernel manually? Also, I've gone through the options already, and only found myself changing a few of them. Is there anything in particular that I
2016-09-10 11:43:48	harwiltz	should really be looking out for?
2016-09-10 11:44:03	username234	kyan: no idea.  Always just used 'traceroute'

2016-09-10 11:44:18	AFutureGentooUse	I have a *small* problem in my Gentoo install. And obviously an anoying problem :( The bookloader doesn't load at all. I have follow the handbook, customize my install a bit then reboot but when I reboot nothing happen, my bios doesn't load grub at all, I get just a black screen (and then it try to boot to other devices like usb)

2016-09-10 11:45:12	username234	harwiltz: There's not much you have to change to configure a kernel for Virtualbox.  The biggest difference is speed in compiling.  A manually configured kernel typically builds much faster than the kernel created by genkernel.

2016-09-10 11:49:55	harwiltz	Ok, now a question that doesn't have to do with the install... Obviously compiling takes much more processing power than installing a binary. If I were to use gentoo, would I be shortening the lifetime of my cpu significantly? Have any of you had a problem with that?
2016-09-10 11:50:08	iflema	harwiltz: are you on winblows, another linux distro or? You could maybe install and test somewhat in a chroot.

2016-09-10 11:50:57	harwiltz	iflema: I would rather not do that right now because I just started the semester and I don't want to screw up my pc :) Maybe when the semester ends
2016-09-10 11:50:58	username234	harwiltz: CPU life is typically shortened by feeding it more voltage than it was designed to handle.
2016-09-10 11:51:09	+Chiitoo	harwiltz: Cooling and use of electricity are probably your main concerns there.
2016-09-10 11:51:11	jasom	In xev I see mouse events but no keyboard events.  This is really odd
2016-09-10 11:51:34	username234	AFutureGentooUse: emerge wgetpaste
2016-09-10 11:51:41	harwiltz	I thought heat was the only thing that affects the lifetime... then again I don't really know what I'm talking about

2016-09-10 11:53:02	jasom	I see evdev respond in my Xorg log when I plug/unplug the keyboard

2016-09-10 11:54:37	harwiltz	One last thing... What worries me a lot about having gentoo as my main OS is that I'll need software that I don't have, and then I'll end up spending a few hours compiling it when I'm short on time. How likely is that scenario? I'm gonna try gentoo in the vm to get a feel for if this will be a problem, but I guess more experience is better
2016-09-10 11:54:41	iflema	harwiltz: if you dont need to alter compiled in options for your software (arch has rather sane defaults) than avoid the hassle. I can be fun however...

2016-09-10 13:53:35	NotAFutureGentoo	it is perhaps only my computer and I should re-do a whole install for uefi (it is was I should have done since the beginning but I thought configuration with bios will be more easier.. huge mistake I see :D).
2016-09-10 13:54:05	username234	NotAFutureGentoo: so it should work, but well firmware writers aren't the best in the world
2016-09-10 13:54:24	username234	NotAFutureGentoo: I would try UEFI boot, you don't have to restart from the beginning though
2016-09-10 13:54:47	username234	NotAFutureGentoo: just run dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda1 and then boot from an UEFI cd (sysrescuecd is a good choice)
2016-09-10 13:55:04	kyan	ali3nx: It wants app "wi-fi analyser"… what's the package name for that?
2016-09-10 13:55:10	username234	change sda2 back to ESP in fdisk (it's already formatted vFAT so that doesn't have to change)
2016-09-10 13:55:21	username234	and install grub again (this time using the efi target)
2016-09-10 13:55:40	ali3nx	kyan, wifi analyzer is an android app for smartphones
2016-09-10 13:55:59	kyan	So I'll need some sort of emulator or VM?
2016-09-10 13:56:31	NotAFutureGentoo	do I really need to boot from another liveusb? the default image can't handle it (I will firstly try directly from there)?
2016-09-10 13:56:32	ali3nx	i've only ever used it on an android phone
2016-09-10 13:56:46	kyan	I use Gentoo, though…
2016-09-10 13:56:47	kyan	:(
2016-09-10 13:56:51	kyan	which I like
2016-09-10 13:57:08	username234	NotAFutureGentoo: it doesn't support UEFI booting last I checked.  The sysrescucd is a Gentoo derivative that does, so it's a good alternate.
2016-09-10 13:57:24	kyan	but idk how to install apps strangely like that
2016-09-10 13:57:45	kyan	Maybe I could run Ethernet cable to it!
2016-09-10 13:57:58	kyan	Since this video seems to be focused on Wi-fi, maybe that would improve things
2016-09-10 13:58:07	ali3nx	theree may be some way to get that analyzer working with a pc instead of a smartphone or some other wifi analyzer software for pc's but i'm imediatrely unaware of anything as easy to setup and use as that android smartphone app
2016-09-10 13:58:09	NotAFutureGentoo	Ok, I give a last chance to Gentoo so :D (I really want to say "I have installed Gentoo" ;) )

2016-09-11 05:36:26	+iamben	yeah i still haven't rebuilt with them off, since they lost the requirement, that's why i asked

The video in the amd card is working finne, however the hdmi audio is not. and the intel video and audio are not working. all the channels in the intel pch device shows up in alsamixer but i get no output. and the hdmi audio output shows only one channel taht is not "changeble"(i cannot change the volume levels)

2016-09-11 11:19:25	blackflow	badgerSqueegee: yes because of cryptsetup for encrypted root
2016-09-11 11:19:47	badgerSqueegee	just to confirm you mean enabling the option as 'm'?
2016-09-11 11:19:56	blackflow	that will build a module
2016-09-11 11:20:13	Kelsar	badgerSqueegee: depends how you build your initrd, genkernel uses static compiled copies, if the system ones not build static
2016-09-11 11:20:35	blackflow	badgerSqueegee: but since you need that for encrypted disks, no need for a module, just compile it in (hit Y instead of M)
2016-09-11 11:20:44	badgerSqueegee	Kelsar: i saw that, should i recompile genkernel then?
2016-09-11 11:20:54	Kelsar	badgerSqueegee: why?
2016-09-11 11:22:02	badgerSqueegee	" The static USE flag may also be enabled on the sys-fs/cryptsetup so that genkernel will use the system binaries (otherwise it will build its own private copy)."

2016-09-11 15:59:38	generic	ali3nx: qt5 still isn't standard ?
2016-09-11 15:59:51	zyliwax	oh no i have a blocking package
2016-09-11 15:59:58	maolang	i guess a lot more stuff exists using qt4 than qt5 still...
2016-09-11 16:00:15	zyliwax	is an emerge @world still safe under that circumstance?
2016-09-11 16:00:24	ali3nx	i never did manage to get kde plasma working. i unmerged the entire mess and reinstalled gnome xD

2016-09-11 16:03:40	zyliwax	it appears as though one package is being uninstalled to make room for another

2016-09-11 16:05:16	Vaska	generic: so when I'm in F2, it's really not a BIOS? Brand new Asus X99 motherboard, I can choose a boot device, boot order, etc...
2016-09-11 16:05:43	sheep	Vaska: it's firmware. BIOS and UEFI are just different types of firmware
2016-09-11 16:06:38	Monkeh	Vaska: Benefits: Booting directly into a kernel, booting off large GPT partitioned drives, booting signed code (doubtful you care)..
2016-09-11 16:07:06	maolang	Vaska: you should read a bit , get aquainted overall as to what is and what not is EFI / UEFI go to this page at the bottom there are some very good links with lots of info --> http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/
2016-09-11 16:07:20	sheep	UEFI also allows you to configure the firmware without having to reboot into it for some settings
2016-09-11 16:07:26	HeXiLeD	maolang: http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/gentoo/user/271695#271695 this might solve the problem
2016-09-11 16:07:29	maolang	as for me after having moved 2 years ago to UEFI /EFI, i am never going back to MBR
2016-09-11 16:08:08	generic	Monkeh: what does directly into the kernel mean ?
2016-09-11 16:08:28	ali3nx	zyliwax, emerge -uDMpv world and you may need --backtrack=30 to help calculate around dependancy blockers if they persist

2016-09-11 16:11:51	ali3nx	rypervenche, many gentoo users make they're own configs or genkernel also provides a bassic "can of worms" config that often works with many types of pc hardware
2016-09-11 16:12:03	sheep	generic: the efi partition is not the bootloader. it's just a partition full of files, and some of those can be booted

2016-09-11 16:33:38	ali3nx	it's just proactive vs. do it later
2016-09-11 16:34:16	maolang	ok so instead of leaving you the files to deal after, they are dealt with rightaway, orphans would be packages not depended uppon by anyone and not in world,  system etc?

2016-09-11 16:46:24	maolang	i usualy do emerge .... -c ....

2016-09-11 16:48:03	ali3nx	overall the key thing everyone wishing to use gentoo on a regular basis will eventually and hopefully learn to appreciate and can benefit from is picking up little tims to make maintaining system consistency less of an effort

2016-09-11 17:10:40	ryonaloli	i swear i remember once trying @system @world, and it had more to update than @world alone, so i started doing @system @world for a while

2016-09-11 17:11:38	@username234	ryonaloli: emerge -uDN[ap]v @world doesn't update build tools, so that could be it.  Although, I don't recall any build tools being in the system set.
2016-09-11 17:12:07	ryonaloli	so what would update everything, then?
2016-09-11 17:12:11	ryonaloli	if i want to update the entire thing
2016-09-11 17:12:16	generic	of what use is the @world variable anyway if i install every packet by doing a seperated emerge call ?
2016-09-11 17:12:17	maolang	wokko: dont worry i type that by hand each time... select zone in notes copy and in terminal paste :)
2016-09-11 17:12:41	ali3nx	ryonaloli, portage of the golden years grew up a little in the previous 3 to 5 of those years i think. i do recall the older portage being less thorough as you described
2016-09-11 17:12:42	kurly	ryonaloli: you could add --with-bdeps=y

2016-09-11 17:14:10	ryonaloli	i tend to do "emerge -uavDN --with-bdeps=y --keep-going=y @system @world", since the one time when i (seem to have) saw @system @world select more than @world.

2016-09-11 18:57:05	sheep	ARP is used to determine what hardware address an IP address is associated with
2016-09-11 18:57:16	sheep	without it, you can't use IP to communicate a LAN

2016-09-11 22:11:39	exxi	give me suggestions guys, i have another i3 4th gen machine, which i just don't want to use it as a firewall, is it possible to use it for multiple purpose other than firewall ?
2016-09-11 22:11:49	grawity	it depends – frequently they vary between "no" and "hell no"
2016-09-11 22:12:10	exxi	grawity, that means i need to setup my own firewall
2016-09-11 22:12:13	grawity	and... yeah, you technically could use the same PC for multiple tasks
2016-09-11 22:12:26	ali3nx	exxi,  the biggest difference with any of the guides i linked in that post and others you'll find is the easy-rsa cerificate creation tools most recent version is only available from openvpn github. gentoo's easy-rsa ebuild is outdated
2016-09-11 22:12:30	exxi	grawity, by getting multiple nics ?
2016-09-11 22:12:32	grawity	but I dunno if mixing firewall with misc tasks wouldn't sorta defeat the point?

2016-09-11 22:15:51	ali3nx	it should be more than capable of multiple tasks
2016-09-11 22:16:56	ali3nx	also your home router is generally only as secure as the firmware running that router is up to date with software upgrades
2016-09-11 22:17:35	exxi	ali3nx, yeah that's why i just don't want to waste it..
2016-09-11 22:17:40	ali3nx	your router may be able to run open firmware if you suspect you have a vulnerable outdated router
2016-09-11 22:17:41	exxi	yeah the router firmware is latest
2016-09-11 22:17:59	exxi	open firmware ? which one
2016-09-11 22:18:12	ali3nx	dd-wrt or openwrt would be good to resaearch what oem formware your router offers
2016-09-11 22:18:52	ali3nx	openwrt has really good wiki with boot logs for many embedded routers that often reveals linux kernel versions

2016-09-11 22:22:24	ali3nx	learning openvpn can be a challenge but it's worth it
2016-09-11 22:22:36	exxi	one last question to close of this topic here, after using dd-wrt or openwrt i will be in better position in terms of security ?
2016-09-11 22:22:39	exxi	grawity, ^
2016-09-11 22:23:20	ali3nx	exxi, if your router firmware has any possible security issues or an outdated kernel then yes i would believe so

2016-09-12 02:54:04	pavlix	grknight:  Gentoo is probably not willing to accept all those live ebuilds and stuff like that... and also it might be easier to accept already working release based ebuilds from an overlay

2016-09-12 03:53:15	minimalism	I couldn't get sound to work at all without writing an .asoundrc specifying my card
2016-09-12 03:53:37	+iamben	minimalism: did you do that to re-order the cards?
2016-09-12 03:54:03	KlausedSource	hey everyone i want to use GhostPCL (ghostscript component for PCL) is this in portage? i have app-text/ghostscript-gpl installed
2016-09-12 03:54:05	minimalism	no, it just wouldn't play unless I entered "card PCH" for pcm and ctl defaults, and to write card default as 1
2016-09-12 03:54:58	+iamben	minimalism: well IF you make a custom asoundrc, you generally need to take special care to either not override the default device setups, or re-declare them with dmix explicitly enabled

2016-09-12 03:57:41	+grknight	nawks: Maxwell support was temporarily dropped in the xorg component of nouveau; the kernel part works
2016-09-12 03:58:18	nawks	iamben, yeah I noticed that the 950 isn't supported.  can I move it to a different screen in xorg.conf, or do I have to pull it from machine?

2016-09-12 05:26:05	+iamben	Vaska: one possibility for the failed boot is that the usb drive gets the /dev/sda slot and the real sata disk is moved up to sdb

2016-09-12 05:26:50	+iamben	Vaska: you're using grub2 i assume?

2016-09-12 05:27:30	Vaska	iamben: yes, grub2 and uefi install with grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot
2016-09-12 05:27:40	+iamben	another way to work around that, if it is a usb drive issue, is to manually edit grub.cfg (for now) to use root=PARTUUID=something rather than root=/dev/sda3
2016-09-12 05:28:10	+iamben	if you only have remote access for now, you could retry with PARTUUID right away

2016-09-12 07:23:41	damien	I have a friend who just updated to windows 10 and grub (unsurprisingly) doesn't work anymore. I don't know too much about how uefi boot works, but I found the uefi partition that has subdirectories with the grubx64 stuff and the grub.cfg as well as the windows stuf (in a seperate subdirectory) is the --efi-directory just the root of that partition one it's mounted, or is it more complicated than that?
2016-09-12 07:24:08	damien	sorry for the long question, I hadn't realized it was so long
2016-09-12 07:24:21	+iamben	damien: fwiw my win10 upgrades didnt mess with my gentoo grub at all.  but anyway, yes --efi-directory will point to the location where the vfat ESP is mounted

2016-09-12 07:29:51	+grknight	Etothetaui: use the / key to search for _user_helper and then look for the number next to the path and press that number.  i.e. if it says (2) type 2 and it will jump there
2016-09-12 07:29:53	+iamben	thunderrd: you should remove "*" or whatever you have in /etc/eix-sync.conf

2016-09-12 07:31:26	+iamben	thunderrd: * or ALL in /etc/eix-sync.conf explicitly tells eix-sync to call layman -S, then emerge --sync also does a sync of overlays in repos.conf

2016-09-12 07:40:06	maolang	no, for me the partition where refind is, grub is installed on its own partition in my case for gentoo /sda6, there is also a grubx64.efi file in the folder /boot/efi/EFI/gentoo on the fat32 / vfat partition
2016-09-12 07:40:07	+iamben	on gentoo/grub the grub entry is labeled as just "Gentoo" actually, it's 0002 on his
2016-09-12 07:40:35	peedub	iamben: why not just skip grub and use an efi-stub kernel and point directly to it with efibootmgr?
2016-09-12 07:41:11	+iamben	peedub: because when you try to pass an extra kernel param for rescue/diag purposes, you can't.
2016-09-12 07:41:19	+iamben	and it's annoying to maintain multiple kernels that way
2016-09-12 07:41:21	maolang	can be done, this is basically simple config, with no hasle in regards to efi with efibootmgr
2016-09-12 07:42:01	thunderrd	iamben: after removing the asterisk, eix-sync seems to skip the overlays.  this is the bug I was referring to:  https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=591422

2016-09-12 07:42:47	maolang	take not with efibootmgr supplied path, \ path direction should be used inmy case mandatory, but might accept / on  more recent UEFI implementations
2016-09-12 07:43:22	peedub	iamben: ok i get it. but is that totally true? EFI has quite a commandline that you can boot into to help rescue system. but I get your point, you need to be familure with it to make any use of it.

2016-09-12 07:44:11	maolang	if you really want the central info on efi / uefi google up refind homepage and lots of very informative links down on his page
2016-09-12 07:44:23	+iamben	peedub: i think for most cases you're doing yourself a real disservice by using only efistub.  at the very least get a boot manager like refind, but grub2 is what most people will want.

2016-09-12 08:13:29	Etothetaui	video_cards should show up in lspci right?

2016-09-12 19:16:46	ali3nx	looking at other distros for such a solution to help with gentoo form your hardware might yield some results
2016-09-12 19:17:22	_catcatcat	I have though! It means I need to install things. Like wpa-supplicant for wi-fi, or for eth, look at what the livedvd uses... which... requires lspci
2016-09-12 19:17:41	_catcatcat	Both of which I'm SOL in, re: hybrid iso lol
2016-09-12 19:18:10	ali3nx	_catcatcat, you mentioned having used arch. does arch have eufi live media that allows you to use a console?
2016-09-12 19:18:37	_catcatcat	Indeed
2016-09-12 19:18:43	_catcatcat	I have used it in the past, at least
2016-09-12 19:18:47	ali3nx	i mainly mention arch because they tend to be from what i've read fairly modern with kernel support
2016-09-12 19:19:04	_catcatcat	They are, definitely; but how could I possibly use that to my advantage?
2016-09-12 19:19:16	ali3nx	any other ditro's live media can be used to install gentoo as long as it supports your hardware
2016-09-12 19:19:41	_catcatcat	But... how?

2016-09-12 20:43:58	Etothetaui	so I am installing gnome in chroot
2016-09-12 20:44:02	Etothetaui	from the livecd
2016-09-12 20:44:19	Etothetaui	but I'm stuck on this step: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Systemd/Installing_Gnome3_from_scratch#Configuring_the_system

2016-09-12 20:48:41	Etothetaui	So I should just skip the step? I can do it after gnome is installed?
2016-09-12 20:48:42	nagchampa	the livedvd doesn't run systemd, it runs openrc
2016-09-12 20:49:12	kiraslaugh	to make and save changes to the kernel you just have to run "make && make modules_install then make install" right?

2016-09-12 20:51:15	ali3nx	Etothetaui, getting your gentoo booted and wireless running asap could be more fruitful and provide a "real" gentoo environment with a proper running non live dvd/cd kernel. anything your missing after wireless is working is icing on the cake :)
2016-09-12 20:52:28	ali3nx	it's mostly preference but the livedvd kernel differs slightly from a non dvd kernel. compiled softare can benefit from being built on the kernel your intending for it to be used with

2016-09-12 21:02:33	maolang	it affects when you run emerge and from in there it uses make internally, that will use the -jX you have set in there, if you run for kernel etc make and dont specify -j5 etc it wont use -j5 but rather j1....

2016-09-13 05:36:42	+iamben	so it does have logic behind it, it's just really ugly (and still not always persistent)
2016-09-13 05:37:09	HedgeWork	Vaska: There was a specific edge case -- when a machine had multiple interfaces of the same type that did not come up in a predictable order, but the admin was too dumb to force-name them according to hardware ID -- that was not well-served by the old scheme, so we were all forced to change.

2016-09-13 05:39:28	Kelsar	the new scheme has one flaw from the planning stage. the idea was thes PCI stuff would stay the same on the hardware, but modern boards assign these via firmware, so if something changes, the IDs do to. so the predictable part is pretty much gone

2016-09-13 08:31:51	zherlock	tdr: the "problem" i see now is that I need to do too many arch spesific kernel settings in .config to make for one arch that I can loose control between the archs. I soon need i.e. arm as well
2016-09-13 08:32:06	+iamben	Vaska: hmm ok i was hoping it was a python problem, maybe it's a selinux problem
2016-09-13 08:32:16	zherlock	tdr: nice would be if a could like have a .config-common that was kinda sourced for both
2016-09-13 08:32:39	tdr	zherlock, just keep a backup of the .configs into /usr/src/kernel_configs/stash/<arch> ?

2016-09-13 08:33:27	ali3nx	tdr, the issue with gdm not opening a listen port was still an issue after modifying the gdm config which is a bit odd. one thing that comes to mind is the posibility it's related to systemd in some wsay

2016-09-13 08:34:06	tdr	zherlock, well if you kept copies for the different arches, it wouldnt even be that much work, just export ARCH=whatever_works make menuconfig

2016-09-13 09:55:38	ali3nx	sbef, you might consider building your gentoo for the old celeron on a vmware or virtualbox using a newer oc then transpanting it to reduce install time required

2016-09-13 10:50:47	+iamben	xpoint: you can quickpkg it in case you want to be albe to roll back to it
2016-09-13 10:51:14	NullConstant	I might give Gentoo another shot again at some point, and once that happens I'll probably pop into here again. Maybe over this weekend so school doesn't interfere with this plan as much.
2016-09-13 10:51:15	xpoint	well i will try stable now, if it fails with clamav-milter i will report this to gentoo
2016-09-13 10:51:34	+grknight	NullConstant: you can use a self-built kernel and only have genkernel make a generic initramfs (i.e. `genkernel --install initramfs`) to have as a rescue shell

2016-09-13 12:17:27	+iamben	hmm indeed it does still have the ntfs type set, that may be confusing it.  im not sure how to change that, after the fact
2016-09-13 12:17:40	ali3nx	so according to parted partition 1 is ntfs formatted
2016-09-13 12:17:56	ali3nx	hmm right
2016-09-13 12:18:06	ali3nx	changing fstype flag might fix that

2016-09-13 12:25:05	ali3nx	iamben, i'm not a briliant parted wizard but it looks like fstype is read from the filesystem itself on whichever partiton. somehow that 1st partition may be ntfs formatted

2016-09-13 12:26:59	ali3nx	cvaq, this could be an easy fix by just ext2 formatting sda1 then reinstaling grub. also the partiton layout your using resembles eufi based layout since your not using swap

2016-09-13 12:27:11		[12:27]
2016-09-13 12:27:45	+iamben	i think you may just need to write zeros to sda1
2016-09-13 12:28:06	ali3nx	eufi setup's not one of my finer talents but eufi partiton layout may not boot on bios based hardware
2016-09-13 12:28:09	+iamben	though this is news to me, that grub-install wouldn't just clobber whatever's on sda1 autoumatically, since bios_grub flag is set
2016-09-13 12:29:05	ali3nx	cvaq, if you do need to redo your partiton layout fear not i can provide a backup script so to ensure you loose nothing

2016-09-13 13:02:59	ali3nx	i tried setting up bootspash with grub2 not long ago and it was being annoying
2016-09-13 13:03:10	badgerSqueegee	my hone directory is decrypted via crypttab
2016-09-13 13:03:37	badgerSqueegee	oh, I thought bootsplash was solely a kernel thing
2016-09-13 13:03:49	ali3nx	other than that i'm not sure waht else to suggest
2016-09-13 13:04:07	ali3nx	bootspash with old grub required initramfs
2016-09-13 13:04:36	ali3nx	one day i'll dissect the image and investigate the contents ;p
2016-09-13 13:05:47	Kelsar	with bootsplash the image was just added at the end of the initramfs file

Is your current SELinux context allowed to run Portage?".  I'm just not sure what to do.  I tried rlpkg portage, to no avail.

2016-09-13 14:57:49	maolang	you put the two world files in one text file and run this , you should get one output with no doubles
2016-09-13 14:59:02	r3g3x	Vaska:  there is still pax and rbac if you choose, as well as the hardened toolchain.
2016-09-13 15:00:13	Vaska	r3g3x: do you use those?  It's all so new to me that my head is spinning.
2016-09-13 15:01:51	r3g3x	Vaska: yes.  the hardened toolchain is enabled through the hardened profile.  pax and rbac is part of kernel configuration though you need to enable rbac later and create a policy.  you cannot use CONFIG_PAX_RAP though with nvidia-drivers.

2016-09-13 19:56:34	ali3nx	Foad_NH, that could be an issue with dbus-glib. have you run revdep-rebuild recently just to check system consistency? perhaps rebuild dbus and dbus-glib. i had a similar issue iirc getting gnome to work properly. only rebuilding world fully fixed it for me

2016-09-13 21:27:23	ams	Hi, I just wondered if anyone can offer a bit of help please? I am installing gentoo amd64 according to the handbook and Id like to use systemd as the init system. I'm as far as choosing the profile, so I guess i'd select default/linux/amd64/13.0/systemd I have already chosen a hardened stage3 tar earlier on but I just wanted to check if I'm doing
2016-09-13 21:27:23	ams	this right. The reason I ask is because I already tried installing gentoo with this profile and the handbook instructions stopped working when I got to the timezone, I tried following from the systemd reference but I started to get lost

2016-09-14 02:04:49	Tecumseh	roxon, you choose one profile and then you install gnome and systemd that are just packages that come with system-wide use flags. If you choose the gnome profile, I don't think you can have a no-multilib (aka 64bit only) system. I may be wrong.

2016-09-14 03:26:17	username234	Tecumseh: It's (behaving like) a router.  Routers join networks.

2016-09-14 03:26:37	username234	Tecumseh: so on a traditional router, each physical port would be a different network.

2016-09-14 04:26:06	+iamben	you could use grub legacy as well
2016-09-14 04:26:21	ali3nx	cvaq_, running backup will create yourgentoo.tar.bz2 you can copy to a different hard drive or a different pc temporarily so you can correct your partiton layout
2016-09-14 04:26:29	wokko	iamben: with your question on 'but all GPT setups have that protective MBR, how can it tell the difference?' apparently grub looks at sector 0 and if nothing is there it looks at sector 1 , where mbr has its partiton table in sector 0 and gpt has its partition table in sector 1.
2016-09-14 04:27:01	+iamben	wokko: but on gpt there is still an mbr in sector 0, that's normal
2016-09-14 04:27:33	+iamben	so in normal operation, it doesn't consider gpt w/ protective mbr to be "multiple partition labels", but it is doing that today, apparently

2016-09-14 04:28:32	wokko	iamben: Yes, so I think sector 0 is corrupted in someway

2016-09-14 04:33:08	+iamben	well the mbr partition table is pretty simple, im not sure where other partitions could be "hiding" =)
2016-09-14 04:33:50	username234	iamben: it's more suggesting that the table is corrupt so the partitions  would be overlapping (which as we both know isn't really allowed)
2016-09-14 04:34:40	username234	only way to know for sure would be a raw dump, but I don't have the time or interest to do that.  If it really is a corrupt MBR issue, the simplest solution is to tell fdisk/gdisk/parted to regenerate it.

2016-09-14 06:05:28	+iamben	c-pin: 20GB is nice and safe if this will be a headless server.  might want a bit more for a desktop.  you CAN get by with 8GB but you'll have to allocate more than the default # of inodes, and you'll have to be diligent with cleanup.

2016-09-14 16:11:47	jrwebb	I have used overlays for networkmanager 1.2/1.4 and noticed the code is sending log messages to the console because the logger hasn't been started. I put "need rsyslogd" in the init script but this will change with whichever logger is being used. Is there a way to promote the logger before NetworkManager?

2016-09-15 13:56:56	Forkk	is there a way around the conflict if I run into something that needs qt4?
2016-09-15 13:57:15	tdr	Forkk, you can enable it per-package using package.use file
2016-09-15 13:57:23	Forkk	ok
2016-09-15 13:57:33	tdr	catagory/packagename qt4   lines in there would turn it on per package
2016-09-15 13:57:56	tdr	most things are probably ok with just qt5 by now or close to being ok anyway

2016-09-15 14:00:59	tdr	Forkk, hrm, figured it'd be there, i'd add it if you're going to use it.  the alternative would be to enable it for just what needs it using package.use like you could do with qt4

2016-09-15 14:03:01	Forkk	ah, that's all over the place
2016-09-15 14:03:35	tdr	Forkk, ok just watch emerge output for a bit then, turning on qt5 may cause some rebuilds due to it.

2016-09-15 14:05:07	tdr	Forkk, i meant it might flip it to use qt5 since qt4 was on before we diabled it

2016-09-15 17:46:11	A_I	younix: I removed plasma a while back and it did leave a heap of qt packages so i ran 'emerge -ac $(qlist -IC dev-qt/*)' and that removed them all then ran 'emerge -ac' to clean the rest up

2016-09-15 17:46:39	+kent\n	_catcatcat: which as I described, is a result of the fact to upgrade to a newer perl, portage needs to *recompile and reinstall* all existing things that built against perl

2016-09-15 19:20:14	younix	aye makes sense , but i wouldn't assume that 2 fields in the same window would report completely different amounts of disk usage...and a difference that is over 2GB
2016-09-15 19:20:58	ali3nx	if your concerned with disk usage of portage distfiles directory you can manually clean that out yourself with relevant commands
2016-09-15 19:21:15	younix	im just trying to trim my disk usage down from ~7 GB , as i feel this is unrealistic as i only have the stage3 base and minimal xfce installed
2016-09-15 19:21:53	younix	i wasn't sure since eclean-distfiles said that it was 'already clean' even though is was 1.9 GB
2016-09-15 19:22:22	Triffid_Hunter	younix: could be your FS's block size.. even a 1 byte file needs a whole block which can be several kilobytes in size, so used space will report 1b but free space could be total - 4k or so
2016-09-15 19:22:25	tdr	by clean it means it still has what it needs to rebuild your system

2016-10-02 06:23:53	+kent\n	philipp_: nah,. you've got a new version of perl and portage is trying to update it
2016-10-02 06:24:05	+kent\n	but updating perl requires portage to recompile *everything* against perl again
2016-10-02 06:24:18	philipp_	kent\n: so whats the problem?
2016-10-02 06:24:29	+kent\n	and it gets confused because its not trying to recompile them, and instead goes "oh, that might break, lets not upgrade perl"

2016-10-02 06:25:01	+kent\n	philipp_: start with adding --with-bdeps=y --backtrack 100 to your command and try again
2016-10-02 06:25:25	+kent\n	but ideally, you'll probably need to solve other parts of your problem in isolation
2016-10-02 06:25:37	philipp_	kent\n: backtrack 100?
2016-10-02 06:26:01	+kent\n	yeah, that tells portage to try harder with alternative dependencies, whereas its default is to just give up :)

2016-10-02 06:38:34	+kent\n	very likely you just had some 32-bit-only application that needed 32-bit support, and that's what that USE ends up doing: adding 32 bit support for things where needed.
2016-10-02 06:38:41	Ceal	is X 32bit, or can i use 64-bit on it?
2016-10-02 06:38:46	+kent\n	both.
2016-10-02 06:38:49	+kent\n	As I said.
2016-10-02 06:38:54	stqn	Ceal: no but maybe it’s wine or steam that needs some 32 bit libs (or skype, whatever)
2016-10-02 06:39:09	+kent\n	ABI_X86="32 64" will give you 64bit X with 32bit library interop

2016-10-02 06:42:07	mender27	Ceal: if Portage wants to install a 32-bit version of a package means that either you have 32 in your ABI_X86 string in make.conf or you have a 32-bit application that requires a 32-bit version of said library.

2016-10-02 06:54:35	Fretegi	mender27, morning :)  always many successes.  at the moment trying to sort out a whole mess of conflicts during an emerge world ha
2016-10-02 06:55:11	+kent\n	Ceal: the difference is if you use it in one place, it will naturally spread because its a USE_EXPAND flag

2016-10-02 06:55:29	+kent\n	that is, if you have to add it for one thing, you'll have to add it for a whole bunch of deps
2016-10-02 06:55:34	+kent\n	its easier to just do it globally

2016-10-02 06:56:01	stqn	Ceal: if you put it in make.conf then all the packages that can be built for 32 bit will be, even if it’s not needed. But it’s simpler (I guess – haven’t tried it.)
2016-10-02 06:56:13	mender27	I second the global adjustment. For WINE I did everything manually. Spent around an hour adjusting the local USE flags.
2016-10-02 06:56:22	Fretegi	mender27, well done!  i may have to ask for questions.  the new xorg is causing lots of issues for me

2016-10-02 07:21:54	username234	2x isn't needed for that either
2016-10-02 07:22:03	Guest15-en	you can set swapiness so that it doesn't use swap that much, I set mine at 10 default is 60
2016-10-02 07:22:05	username234	you do need more than 1x though
2016-10-02 07:22:32	mrhanky	i've setup 5gb swap with 4gb ram

2016-10-02 07:23:26	+kent\n	if you kept that resident, you're just wasting memory that could be used for VFS cache

2016-10-02 07:24:48	+kent\n	which means you can dump it from ram under pressure instantly. ;)

2016-10-02 09:41:36	_genuser_	I figured I'd spent more on disks. Eventually changing them out to be 2TB SSDs. and keep the hardware the cheapest. Because it's just raid1'ing them.

2016-10-02 22:35:37	justsomeguy	SwifT: I'd also like to suggest that the instructions for chrooting be changed, since 'mount --rbind' commands make it difficult to unmount api filesystems. the 'mount -o bind' option can be used instead. Alternately, could someone include instruction on how to unmount those file systems?

2016-10-02 22:37:30	@SwifT	justsomeguy: I understand your pain. The instructions have been switching from one side to another in its history. Without rbind, we miss either submounts or a misinterpretation of its data which leads to other problems. I think the unmount should be fixed - I had lazy unmounting in there, perhaps it was removed (in which case I'd rather first see why before I introduce regressions ;)

2016-10-02 22:39:23	justsomeguy	Good to know SwifT , I hadn't noticed any unmounting commands in the handbook but I haven't read it in a while. Also, suprisingly, systemd-nspawn works well (if you're installing from a non-gentoo live disk) and it's just one command.
2016-10-02 22:40:09	@SwifT	perhaps an elaborate command like "grep /mnt/gentoo/dev /proc/mounts | cut -f 2 -d " " | sort -r
