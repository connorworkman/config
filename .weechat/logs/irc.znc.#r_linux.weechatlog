2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:34:37] that'd just get in my way. [20:34:37]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:34:48] i use gnome with hide top bar, so i only mostly see my one or two apps and that's it [20:34:48]

2016-09-16 10:39:17	rat	[20:34:59] i'll probably remove the stats if it ever shows up on mr robot [20:34:59]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:35:21] i'd probably be ok with i3 for how i use the computer. i just don't wanna deal with configuring junk.. and i like the integration  [20:35:21]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	rat	[20:35:38] in any case, having an eye on temps, ram usage and network IP is immensely helpful, the rest is just filler [20:35:38]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:36:22] maybe somebody will come up with a cool wm thing that uses all the new "standard" tech so it's easier to fathom the whole system [20:36:22]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	rat	[20:36:38] i tried the conky bar as one line up top but it just got to be to difficult to fit everything in one line [20:36:38]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:36:40] that is, it requires systemd user sessions, and handles xdg autostart and such [20:36:40]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:36:50] my vertical space is too premimum [20:36:50]

2016-09-16 10:39:17	rat	[20:37:09] that's why I shoved the panel to the left side [20:37:09]

2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:38:02] i'd like to see a wm that integrates with packagekit to find widgets  [20:38:02]

2016-09-16 10:40:38	jrobeson	kde is locked in a box now.. they must be configurable forever, or risk the wrath the community
2016-09-16 10:41:32	rat	and it's probably the worst of all the DEs when it comes to dependencies. it's package hell every step of the way.
2016-09-16 10:42:34	rat	i miss yakuake, but just to install that one app on another DE requires about 1.7GB worth of packages to be installed
2016-09-16 10:42:55	rat	because it's dependent on the entie kde package system
2016-09-16 10:43:45	rat	shame, because it really was the best drop down terminal
2016-09-16 10:44:21	jrobeson	well i appreciate that they split the packages up instead of being so monolithc
2016-09-16 10:44:50	jrobeson	you can blame all that on lack of low level primitives imo.
2016-09-16 10:45:30	jrobeson	the only reason it needs 1.7gb is because it has to reimplement the same crap at the system level that gnome/kde does or gtk/qt does 
2016-09-16 10:45:47	jrobeson	so it can't just depend on the generic stuff, because THERE IS NO GENERIC STUFF
2016-09-16 10:46:29	jrobeson	there's huge blank spaces between kernel -> X -> tookit -> DE
2016-09-16 10:47:57	jrobeson	systemd is filling in some of the gaps at least
2016-09-16 10:48:16	jrobeson	like systemd --user 
2016-09-16 10:48:35	jrobeson	heck.. systemd itself, because of the common logging system
2016-09-16 10:51:23	rat	ugh. barf.

2016-09-17 11:04:57	dvdmuckle	[18:05:53] you'd also be hard pressed to find something with those specs for cheap, imo [18:05:53]
2016-09-17 11:04:57	dvdmuckle	[18:06:02] but haswell and broadwell chromebooks are both very good [18:06:02]
2016-09-17 11:04:57	dvdmuckle	[18:06:14] at the very least they have upgradable m.2 ssds [18:06:14]
2016-09-17 11:04:57	dvdmuckle	[18:06:39] and "upgradable" ram if you have patience and a steady hand (it's soldered on) [18:06:39]

2016-09-17 11:04:57	+dhscholb	[18:25:29] no soldering required [18:25:29]
2016-09-17 11:04:57	dvdmuckle	[18:26:51] it's sandy bridge [18:26:51]
2016-09-17 11:04:57	dvdmuckle	[18:26:58] and not a very powerful one at that [18:26:58]
2016-09-17 11:04:57	+dhscholb	[18:27:32] that probably won't matter to most people looking for a cheap laptop [18:27:32]

2016-09-17 16:56:53	jrobeson	we wanna run on the newest debian.. and that means no python 3.5 
2016-09-17 16:57:09	jrobeson	they are the only thing holding us to 3.4 
2016-09-17 16:57:22	jrobeson	well that and ubuntu 14.04  
2016-09-17 17:00:54	airen	virtualenv?
2016-09-17 17:06:00		[17:00]
2016-09-17 17:14:29	jrobeson	virtualenvs don't give you new versions of python
2016-09-17 17:14:44	jrobeson	that's what pyenv does (or anaconda/miniconda)
2016-09-17 17:15:19	jrobeson	however I don't think that debian allows such packages in their repo. and you'd cause way too much confusion if you gave them a new python
2016-09-17 17:16:08	jrobeson	i'm personally of the opinion that that stuff is holding all of us back, but there's nothing i can personally do about it :(

2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[02:56:39] uggh debian is holding me back right now [02:56:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[02:56:53] we wanna run on the newest debian.. and that means no python 3.5  [02:56:53]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[02:57:09] they are the only thing holding us to 3.4  [02:57:09]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[02:57:22] well that and ubuntu 14.04   [02:57:22]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	airen	[03:00:54] virtualenv? [03:00:54]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[03:14:29] virtualenvs don't give you new versions of python [03:14:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[03:14:44] that's what pyenv does (or anaconda/miniconda) [03:14:44]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[03:15:19] however I don't think that debian allows such packages in their repo. and you'd cause way too much confusion if you gave them a new python [03:15:19]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[03:16:08] i'm personally of the opinion that that stuff is holding all of us back, but there's nothing i can personally do about it :( [03:16:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	airen	[03:26:17] jrobeson: You can also build a package [03:26:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	airen	[03:26:19] or put it in opt [03:26:19]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	airen	[03:26:23] I mean, there are plenty of options. [03:26:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[03:55:38] opt can't be used for official packages like that [03:55:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[03:57:42] oh, and we don't wanna maintain our own debian packages anyways. neither of us use it [03:57:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	rat	[14:29:30] dvdmuckle: Wrong. The C710 is upgradable. I put 10GB of Ram in mine and upgraded the drive to an SSD. [14:29:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	rat	[14:30:13] and a 1.1Ghz Dualcore SB based Celeron is about equivalent to a 1.6Ghz Core2Duo. Not a slouch. And good for the price. [14:30:13]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	guccimane_	[18:55:10] if i am attempting to install linux onto my custom build desktop, do i need to disconnect my graphics card for the install and reconnect once ubuntu has been installed with drivers? [18:55:10]

2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[02:22:33] hah..  [02:22:33]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	dhscholb	[02:50:27] we ruin debian where i work [02:50:27]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[02:56:33] :) [02:56:33]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[02:56:39] uggh debian is holding me back right now [02:56:39]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[02:56:53] we wanna run on the newest debian.. and that means no python 3.5  [02:56:53]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[02:57:09] they are the only thing holding us to 3.4  [02:57:09]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[02:57:22] well that and ubuntu 14.04   [02:57:22]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	airen	[03:00:54] virtualenv? [03:00:54]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[03:14:29] virtualenvs don't give you new versions of python [03:14:29]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[03:14:44] that's what pyenv does (or anaconda/miniconda) [03:14:44]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[03:15:19] however I don't think that debian allows such packages in their repo. and you'd cause way too much confusion if you gave them a new python [03:15:19]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[03:16:08] i'm personally of the opinion that that stuff is holding all of us back, but there's nothing i can personally do about it :( [03:16:08]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	airen	[03:26:17] jrobeson: You can also build a package [03:26:17]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	airen	[03:26:19] or put it in opt [03:26:19]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	airen	[03:26:23] I mean, there are plenty of options. [03:26:23]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[03:55:38] opt can't be used for official packages like that [03:55:38]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[03:57:42] oh, and we don't wanna maintain our own debian packages anyways. neither of us use it [03:57:42]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	rat	[14:29:30] dvdmuckle: Wrong. The C710 is upgradable. I put 10GB of Ram in mine and upgraded the drive to an SSD. [14:29:30]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	rat	[14:30:13] and a 1.1Ghz Dualcore SB based Celeron is about equivalent to a 1.6Ghz Core2Duo. Not a slouch. And good for the price. [14:30:13]

2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[20:51:34] no [20:51:34]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[20:51:48] or rather, that's not normal procedure to have to do so [20:51:48]

2016-09-20 02:13:06		[02:13]
2016-09-20 02:13:12	mewshi	I mean... that's... something.
2016-09-20 02:15:34	logiz	NegativeFlare: uninstalled vim-minimal because it conflicted with vim8

2016-09-20 02:16:18	mewshi	And that... took sudo with it? o.o
2016-09-20 02:17:28	logiz	sudo depends on vim-minimal
2016-09-20 02:20:36	mewshi	What system depends on a specific vim package?
2016-09-20 02:20:55	logiz	fedora
2016-09-20 02:21:12	logiz	it's cause of visudo
2016-09-20 02:27:00		[02:21]
2016-09-20 02:45:06	mewshi	I... ok.  Why not just any vi* package?

2016-09-20 03:04:34	dhscholb	or why not just assume that an editor is already installed and forget the dependency altogether
2016-09-20 03:05:10	dhscholb	if you don't have an editor installed, you have bigger problems than not being able to use visudo

2016-09-20 07:33:43	logiz	mewshi: I mean I think sudoers shouldn't have any of those dependencies, since you can edit the config with nano or whatever, but the fact I have vim-minimal and vim8 is annoying
2016-09-20 07:39:00		[07:33]
2016-09-20 07:41:31	dhscholb	yeah, it seems odd that vim8 wouldn't satisfy that dependency, or any other editor for that matter
2016-09-20 07:41:46	dhscholb	but then, i know nothing about how rpm does deps

2016-09-20 18:53:18	mewshi	[12:13:06] logiz, how did you accidentally uninstall sudo? [12:13:06]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	mewshi	[12:13:12] I mean... that's... something. [12:13:12]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	logiz	[12:15:34] NegativeFlare: uninstalled vim-minimal because it conflicted with vim8 [12:15:34]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	logiz	[12:15:41] mewshi: * [12:15:41]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	mewshi	[12:16:18] And that... took sudo with it? o.o [12:16:18]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	logiz	[12:17:28] sudo depends on vim-minimal [12:17:28]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	mewshi	[12:20:36] What system depends on a specific vim package? [12:20:36]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	logiz	[12:20:55] fedora [12:20:55]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	logiz	[12:21:12] it's cause of visudo [12:21:12]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	mewshi	[12:45:06] I... ok.  Why not just any vi* package? [12:45:06]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dhscholb	[13:03:19] lol, fedora [13:03:19]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dhscholb	[13:04:34] or why not just assume that an editor is already installed and forget the dependency altogether [13:04:34]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dhscholb	[13:05:10] if you don't have an editor installed, you have bigger problems than not being able to use visudo [13:05:10]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	logiz	[14:10:48] mewshi: cause that's what the dependency structure is I didn't choose it [14:10:48]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	mewshi	[17:14:55] I wasn't saying it's your fault, just questioning the maintainers :) [17:14:55]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dhscholb	[17:16:17] i still blame logiz  [17:16:17]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	logiz	[17:33:43] mewshi: I mean I think sudoers shouldn't have any of those dependencies, since you can edit the config with nano or whatever, but the fact I have vim-minimal and vim8 is annoying [17:33:43]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dhscholb	[17:41:31] yeah, it seems odd that vim8 wouldn't satisfy that dependency, or any other editor for that matter [17:41:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dhscholb	[17:41:46] but then, i know nothing about how rpm does deps [17:41:46]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	logiz	[18:42:04] fix one bug, find like 100 more [18:42:04]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	logiz	[18:42:13] I'm convinced this thing I wrote will never be free of bugs [18:42:13]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	 *	dhscholb [19:03:05] gives logiz a box of bug spray  [19:03:05]

2016-09-20 18:53:18	jrobeson	[20:23:52] dhscholb, until recently fedora didn't support weak dependencies , or suggests/recommends.  [20:23:52]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	jrobeson	[20:24:01] i think it was related to rpm issues [20:24:01]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	jrobeson	[20:24:24] and since the last two fedora releases, they've been cleaning that up. [20:24:24]

2016-09-20 18:53:18	pheonix991	[02:03:15] I added the IP of the server to my personal dns server so I can now access the north korean web. [02:03:15]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	pheonix991	[02:03:26] well, I can resolve the web site names. [02:03:26]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	pheonix991	[02:03:30] instead of having to use IPs [02:03:30]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dhscholb	[02:04:31] do they resolve porn sites? [02:04:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dhscholb	[02:04:45] i wonder if they've blocked that stuff [02:04:45]

2016-09-21 12:41:38	mewshi	[12:13:06] logiz, how did you accidentally uninstall sudo? [12:13:06]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	mewshi	[12:13:12] I mean... that's... something. [12:13:12]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	logiz	[12:15:34] NegativeFlare: uninstalled vim-minimal because it conflicted with vim8 [12:15:34]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	logiz	[12:15:41] mewshi: * [12:15:41]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	mewshi	[12:16:18] And that... took sudo with it? o.o [12:16:18]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	logiz	[12:17:28] sudo depends on vim-minimal [12:17:28]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	mewshi	[12:20:36] What system depends on a specific vim package? [12:20:36]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	logiz	[12:20:55] fedora [12:20:55]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	logiz	[12:21:12] it's cause of visudo [12:21:12]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	mewshi	[12:45:06] I... ok.  Why not just any vi* package? [12:45:06]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	dhscholb	[13:03:19] lol, fedora [13:03:19]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	dhscholb	[13:04:34] or why not just assume that an editor is already installed and forget the dependency altogether [13:04:34]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	dhscholb	[13:05:10] if you don't have an editor installed, you have bigger problems than not being able to use visudo [13:05:10]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	logiz	[14:10:48] mewshi: cause that's what the dependency structure is I didn't choose it [14:10:48]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	mewshi	[17:14:55] I wasn't saying it's your fault, just questioning the maintainers :) [17:14:55]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	dhscholb	[17:16:17] i still blame logiz  [17:16:17]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	logiz	[17:33:43] mewshi: I mean I think sudoers shouldn't have any of those dependencies, since you can edit the config with nano or whatever, but the fact I have vim-minimal and vim8 is annoying [17:33:43]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	dhscholb	[17:41:31] yeah, it seems odd that vim8 wouldn't satisfy that dependency, or any other editor for that matter [17:41:31]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	dhscholb	[17:41:46] but then, i know nothing about how rpm does deps [17:41:46]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	logiz	[18:42:04] fix one bug, find like 100 more [18:42:04]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	logiz	[18:42:13] I'm convinced this thing I wrote will never be free of bugs [18:42:13]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	 *	dhscholb [19:03:05] gives logiz a box of bug spray  [19:03:05]

2016-09-21 12:41:38	logiz	[19:38:47] raise Exception('all your bugs are belong to us') [19:38:47]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	jrobeson	[20:23:52] dhscholb, until recently fedora didn't support weak dependencies , or suggests/recommends.  [20:23:52]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	jrobeson	[20:24:01] i think it was related to rpm issues [20:24:01]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	jrobeson	[20:24:24] and since the last two fedora releases, they've been cleaning that up. [20:24:24]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	dhscholb	[00:54:40] slycurgus: ya ded? [00:54:40]

2016-09-21 12:41:38	pheonix991	[01:55:20] Anyone else add the North Korean name server to their list of forwarders? [01:55:20]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	dhscholb	[02:01:59] the what now? [02:01:59]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	pheonix991	[02:02:54] North Korean dns server access is open currently. [02:02:54]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	pheonix991	[02:03:15] I added the IP of the server to my personal dns server so I can now access the north korean web. [02:03:15]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	pheonix991	[02:03:26] well, I can resolve the web site names. [02:03:26]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	pheonix991	[02:03:30] instead of having to use IPs [02:03:30]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	dhscholb	[02:04:31] do they resolve porn sites? [02:04:31]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	dhscholb	[02:04:45] i wonder if they've blocked that stuff [02:04:45]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	pheonix991	[02:05:02] let me see if I can figure out their google [02:05:02]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	pheonix991	[02:22:59] not coming up with one... [02:22:59]

2016-09-21 14:25:05	dvdmuckle	bought a vt420 terminal, got my pi hooked up to the network
2016-09-21 14:25:05		[14:25]
2016-09-21 14:25:18	dvdmuckle	now i have to wait for next friday for the terminal to arrive
2016-09-21 14:26:46	logiz	the terminal for potheads
2016-09-21 14:26:53	dvdmuckle	indeed
2016-09-21 14:27:03	logiz	that thing costs more than a chromebook
2016-09-21 14:27:12	dvdmuckle	fitting, as a popular rumor on campus is the guy who invented lsd went here
2016-09-21 14:27:19	dvdmuckle	i don't believe that's true but people still say it
2016-09-21 14:28:04	dvdmuckle	the vt420? i got it for $137, that's with shipping
2016-09-21 14:28:20	dvdmuckle	i have my eyes on a chromebook PAINE that's refurbed from acer for $150
2016-09-21 14:29:02	logiz	albert hoffman?
2016-09-21 14:29:08	logiz	bro do you even ride a bike?
2016-09-21 14:34:18	dvdmuckle	i have a bike, yes
2016-09-21 14:34:27	dvdmuckle	i mostly walk places but that's besides the point
2016-09-21 14:35:18	dvdmuckle	but a lot of the people here are fans of, erm... "vintage" items *coughhipsters* so i hope my project will be appreciated
2016-09-21 14:35:40	dvdmuckle	i know the average age of our computer science professors is somewhere around 60-50 so that's good
2016-09-21 14:35:48	logiz	heh
2016-09-21 14:36:04	logiz	that's cause younger comp sci people are smart enough to know being a professor ain't where the money is
2016-09-21 14:36:26	dvdmuckle	i asked for input on which terminal they would prefer and one (the head of the department) said the one i purchased, while the other (my advisor) suggested the televideo 910 which was... $250 more
2016-09-21 14:36:38	logiz	[M#??heh
2016-09-21 14:36:41	logiz	wtf
2016-09-21 14:36:43	dvdmuckle	well, my advisor did work at amazon for a time
2016-09-21 14:36:54	dvdmuckle	he helped on the amazon echo
2016-09-21 14:36:58	logiz	neat
2016-09-21 14:37:04	logiz	I know a prof that worked on watson
2016-09-21 14:37:10	dvdmuckle	but he's also the only person in the department to actually do something beyond an educational vocation
2016-09-21 14:37:12	logiz	left the school cause of money
2016-09-21 14:37:28	logiz	asked for a 10k raise, they said no, took a 100k raise at ibm
2016-09-21 14:38:14	logiz	we live in kind of an amazing time though
2016-09-21 14:38:43	logiz	almost all professors everywhere are going to be good, gone to better schools than the students could ever hope to get in, have done more interesting projects than students will ever hope to do
2016-09-21 14:38:50	logiz	real foundational shit
2016-09-21 14:39:10	dvdmuckle	it is rather amazing
2016-09-21 14:39:12	logiz	hell over in CA there are plenty of people that teach like one class just for fun, then hope on the bus to google
2016-09-21 14:39:18	logiz	I think that's the way to do it
2016-09-21 14:39:44	logiz	I'd rather have a professor there cause they want to be there, cause they make bank at a company doing cool shit, than the adjunct trying to make tenure and making less than an intern
2016-09-21 14:39:53	logiz	cause they'll get burnt out super fast
2016-09-21 14:41:25	dvdmuckle	i'd like to believe my advisor is doing this because he likes it. i'm currently taking what he calls his favorite class and it's almost my favorite because he's so good at teaching the material
2016-09-21 14:41:25		[14:41]
2016-09-21 14:43:00	dhscholb	yeah, the best teachers that I had in college either currently or formerly worked in industry
2016-09-21 14:43:29	dhscholb	but then again, my focus was for industry, so it kind of makes sense
2016-09-21 14:43:50	dhscholb	if your focus is pure academia, then you might have a different opinion
2016-09-21 14:45:13	logiz	my focus was academia for quite a while
2016-09-21 14:45:31	logiz	but unless you're at absolutely the best school doing the best work, it doesn't matter, life is much happier with a job and doing shit just cause
2016-09-21 14:45:55	dhscholb	yeah, academia is not for me
2016-09-21 14:46:09	dhscholb	i want to build stuff

2016-09-21 17:58:16	logiz	it's not really something you believe until you're turned down from all the internships
2016-09-21 17:58:51	logiz	which is also why I strongly support unionization
2016-09-21 17:59:30	jrobeson	are you more talking about apprenticeships at that point?

2016-09-21 18:01:29	logiz	tech positions are interesting because it kind of is one of the easiest ways for a lot of us to get away from typical blue collar jobs, and you meet a lot of those people, but you meet a lot more people that don't understand because their dads got them a job with [large tech firm] at 13
2016-09-21 18:01:40	logiz	wallstreet is like that too though

2016-09-21 18:04:12	logiz	gotta look a certain way, have certain beliefs, act a certain way, blah blah blah

2016-09-21 19:07:02	dhscholb	[00:43:28] but then again, my focus was for industry, so it kind of makes sense [00:43:28]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	dhscholb	[00:43:49] if your focus is pure academia, then you might have a different opinion [00:43:49]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[00:45:12] my focus was academia for quite a while [00:45:12]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[00:45:30] but unless you're at absolutely the best school doing the best work, it doesn't matter, life is much happier with a job and doing shit just cause [00:45:30]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	dhscholb	[00:45:54] yeah, academia is not for me [00:45:54]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	dhscholb	[00:46:08] i want to build stuff [00:46:08]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	rat	[03:48:07] logiz: honestly. internships (aka slave labor) will get you much further than courses. [03:48:07]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	rat	[03:48:24] if you have the means to do it, 'volunteer' at the kind of place you want to work at and get your experience that way [03:48:24]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	dvdmuckle	[03:51:52] rat: that reminds me, i have an email to write wrt internships [03:51:52]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[03:54:28] rat: that's why internships are reserved for rich kids [03:54:28]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	jrobeson	[03:56:40] terrible .. [03:56:40]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	jrobeson	[03:56:58] true though.. [03:56:58]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[03:58:16] it's not really something you believe until you're turned down from all the internships [03:58:16]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[03:58:51] which is also why I strongly support unionization [03:58:51]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	jrobeson	[03:59:29] are you more talking about apprenticeships at that point? [03:59:29]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[03:59:38] in this case, yes [03:59:38]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	jrobeson	[03:59:38] i know we need more of that [03:59:38]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	 *	jrobeson [03:59:57] pours sugar on logiz (not salt) [03:59:57]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:00:13] I've gotten into a lot of arguments about this in person [04:00:13]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:01:29] tech positions are interesting because it kind of is one of the easiest ways for a lot of us to get away from typical blue collar jobs, and you meet a lot of those people, but you meet a lot more people that don't understand because their dads got them a job with [large tech firm] at 13 [04:01:29]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:01:40] wallstreet is like that too though [04:01:40]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	jrobeson	[04:02:24] i know i know about that.. i grew up around people who never had that sort of money [04:02:24]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:02:39] I'm just saying, it's kind of surreal [04:02:39]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:03:20] I know a handful of people that are having a hell of a time getting a job because they're "not cultural fits" [04:03:20]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:03:51] they have experience too [04:03:51]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:04:12] gotta look a certain way, have certain beliefs, act a certain way, blah blah blah [04:04:12]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:05:01] there's one particular person, where I won't mention the details, but I'd have made a really big scene about, except they didn't want that to happen [04:05:01]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:06:09] funny thing is, I actually turned down that position, which would have paid a hell of a lot more, but I'm glad I did, cause they're a bunch of assholes and I wouldn't want to be around those people [04:06:09]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	jrobeson	[04:08:57] good good good [04:08:57]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	rat	[04:21:53] it sucks that it means you have to work without pay but it's also possible to do without going to school... so you actually do save some money that way [04:21:53]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	rat	[04:22:11] so internships are a double edged sword [04:22:11]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	rat	[04:22:23] you really do get a lot out of them though. [04:22:23]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	rat	[04:22:31] IF you can afford to do it. [04:22:31]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	jrobeson	[04:27:28] at least you can get some free money to go to school, but nobody is gonna fund you to live during your internship [04:27:28]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:30:34] ^ [04:30:34]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:30:56] also getting an internship without going to school, lol [04:30:56]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:31:25] they're just going to tell you "you don't have 5 years of node experience" [04:31:25]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:31:46] "but I thought this was an internship"  "yah, we're not funded yet, and what we really need is a rich college boy who will work 20 hours a day" [04:31:46]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:45:24] huh, amazon will ship me wine within 2 hours [04:45:24]

2016-09-22 00:23:55	logiz	[00:37:27] asked for a 10k raise, they said no, took a 100k raise at ibm [00:37:27]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	logiz	[00:38:13] we live in kind of an amazing time though [00:38:13]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	logiz	[00:38:42] almost all professors everywhere are going to be good, gone to better schools than the students could ever hope to get in, have done more interesting projects than students will ever hope to do [00:38:42]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	logiz	[00:38:49] real foundational shit [00:38:49]

2016-09-22 00:23:55	logiz	[00:39:11] hell over in CA there are plenty of people that teach like one class just for fun, then hope on the bus to google [00:39:11]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	logiz	[00:39:17] I think that's the way to do it [00:39:17]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	logiz	[00:39:43] I'd rather have a professor there cause they want to be there, cause they make bank at a company doing cool shit, than the adjunct trying to make tenure and making less than an intern [00:39:43]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	logiz	[00:39:52] cause they'll get burnt out super fast [00:39:52]

2016-09-22 16:11:34	logiz	why would you want to do that
2016-09-22 16:11:44	dvdmuckle	so i can connect my vt420 terminal to a server
2016-09-22 16:11:54	dvdmuckle	through a rpi

2016-09-22 16:12:10	dvdmuckle	local in the sense that it's on the same network
2016-09-22 16:12:37	dvdmuckle	it's either socat or an ssh thin client script a friend and i were working on

2016-09-23 12:21:09	dvdmuckle	[02:10:41] ssh or socat [02:10:41]
2016-09-23 12:21:09	logiz	[02:11:09] the fuck is socat [02:11:09]
2016-09-23 12:21:09	dvdmuckle	[02:11:17] http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/ [02:11:17]
2016-09-23 12:21:10	dvdmuckle	[02:11:21] can port a tty over a tcp port [02:11:21]
2016-09-23 12:21:10	dvdmuckle	[02:11:32] or something like that [02:11:32]
2016-09-23 12:21:10	logiz	[02:11:33] why would you want to do that [02:11:33]
2016-09-23 12:21:10	dvdmuckle	[02:11:43] so i can connect my vt420 terminal to a server [02:11:43]
2016-09-23 12:21:10	dvdmuckle	[02:11:53] through a rpi [02:11:53]
2016-09-23 12:21:10	dvdmuckle	[02:12:04] so vt420 > rpi > local server [02:12:04]
2016-09-23 12:21:10	dvdmuckle	[02:12:09] local in the sense that it's on the same network [02:12:09]
2016-09-23 12:21:10	dvdmuckle	[02:12:35] it's either socat or an ssh thin client script a friend and i were working on [02:12:35]
2016-09-23 12:21:10	dvdmuckle	[02:13:48] preliminary searches for "raspberry pi thin client" didn't turn up anything too helpful [02:13:48]

2016-09-23 15:37:15	jrobeson	give an example please
2016-09-23 15:38:00	logiz	I assume stuff like clicking since it's in some docs I saw before, but it seems like I might be able to watch values of items through the debugger

2016-09-23 15:44:02	logiz	I consider this a "resolved enough to go home" fix
2016-09-23 15:45:39	jrobeson	so onClick or whatnot?
2016-09-23 15:46:00	jrobeson	you can capture all onClicks and then set whether they should bubble up or not

2016-09-23 15:46:33	logiz	not that i really care about onclick, I just need to learn more
2016-09-23 15:47:10	jrobeson	addEventListener("click", function(){});
2016-09-23 15:47:18	jrobeson	you can add it to any element

2016-09-23 15:48:57	jrobeson	it sorta goes into the complicated aspect of bubbling in there too
2016-09-23 15:49:02	jrobeson	so you should definitely read about that
2016-09-23 15:51:16	logiz	oh that's cool I hung the debug tools
2016-09-23 15:51:30	logiz	guess it really si time to go home then

2016-09-23 17:22:25	jrobeson	fauxm, what do you have that still relies on gtk2? :)
2016-09-23 17:22:32	jrobeson	i have a nearly gtk2 free system
2016-09-23 17:22:56	-->	Kijad (~Kijad@unaffiliated/kijad) has joined #r/linux
2016-09-23 17:22:56	jrobeson	i think flash is the only program i have installed that use often enough that requires gtk2. 
2016-09-23 17:23:08	jrobeson	oh, and firefox's plugin container requires gtk2 too, but it's nothing i see
2016-09-23 17:23:19	fauxm	a lot of stuff
2016-09-23 17:23:20	 *	jrobeson has it set to ask to activate though of course
2016-09-23 17:23:26	fauxm	iirc firefox is built with gtk2
2016-09-23 17:23:35	fauxm	pcmanfm is also gtk2
2016-09-23 17:23:48	jrobeson	firefox has shipped officially with gtk3 for awhile
2016-09-23 17:23:57	jrobeson	unless your distro still builds it with gtk2 for some reason
2016-09-23 17:24:45	jrobeson	but it's been possible to build it with gtk3 and generally work for nearly at year at this point
2016-09-23 17:24:53	fauxm	yeah
2016-09-23 17:25:18	fauxm	I don't know how gentoo works with this
2016-09-23 17:25:23	fauxm	there's a gtk2 useflag for firefox
2016-09-23 17:25:27	jrobeson	should be a useflag right?
2016-09-23 17:25:41	fauxm	so I guess in newer versions of firefox, it defaults to gtk3 and will use gtk2 if the useflag is set
2016-09-23 17:25:51	fauxm	because there is now gtk3 useflag
2016-09-23 17:26:07	jrobeson	well it still depends on gtk2 for the plugin container, otherwise the flash plugin will never work
2016-09-23 17:26:38	fauxm	grumble
2016-09-23 17:26:38	fauxm	hm
2016-09-23 17:26:47	jrobeson	well you know they are trying to end those plugins right?
2016-09-23 17:26:55	jrobeson	so, it is a temporary situation 
2016-09-23 17:27:08	fauxm	yeah
2016-09-23 17:27:09	fauxm	www-client/firefox Use the cairo-gtk2 rendering engine
2016-09-23 17:27:10	jrobeson	who knows though that might change anyways, because flash folks now have a new beta linux plugin for 23
2016-09-23 17:27:26	fauxm	I'll try building without it
2016-09-23 17:27:30	jrobeson	rendering engine is an odd way of saying it
2016-09-23 17:27:37	jrobeson	i think mine uses skia now
2016-09-23 17:28:14	fauxm	well, it's using cairo
2016-09-23 17:28:15	jrobeson	fauxm, don't bother .. do this 
2016-09-23 17:28:16	jrobeson	about:buildconfig

2016-09-23 17:28:58	fauxm	I figured that was the case
2016-09-23 17:29:00	jrobeson	ah
2016-09-23 17:29:03	jrobeson	well now you know for sure
2016-09-23 17:29:07	fauxm	so building with -gtk2 should work
2016-09-23 17:29:21	jrobeson	but you still want that for the plugin container unless you never want flash
2016-09-23 17:29:31	fauxm	wlel
2016-09-23 17:29:33	jrobeson	i guess this is where the commonly named use flags can get in the way
2016-09-23 17:29:38	fauxm	yeah
2016-09-23 17:29:40	jrobeson	i'm glad we brought htis up
2016-09-23 17:29:45	jrobeson	i never thought about a case like this
2016-09-23 17:29:51	fauxm	-gtk2 I think for firefox just builds wihout that being the default
2016-09-23 17:29:54	jrobeson	would probably be better go name something closer to the use flags
2016-09-23 17:29:56	fauxm	we'll see if flash is broken
2016-09-23 17:30:04	jrobeson	err to the compiler flags
2016-09-23 17:30:14	fauxm	right
2016-09-23 17:30:36	jrobeson	err why do i say compiler, i mean configure
2016-09-23 17:30:44	fauxm	I get what you mea
2016-09-23 17:30:45	fauxm	n
2016-09-23 17:32:53	jrobeson	gtk2 is as dead to me as it can be atm i think.

2016-09-23 18:43:16	fauxm	so I think when I timed out, it didn't re-sasl me, so I couldn't change my nick because of a channel mode or something
2016-09-23 18:43:20	fauxm	I don't know
2016-09-23 18:43:33	slycurgus	also, ugh, downloaded an EAGLE schematic pack of ST Micro parts from Element14.... they have lots of MCUs but not the one i bought (from Element14) :I
2016-09-23 18:43:40	slycurgus	fauxm: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-09-23 18:45:19	jrobeson	slycurgus, i've been researching more mcus.. fun times right now
2016-09-23 18:45:26	jrobeson	really cheap really popular chips
2016-09-23 18:45:46	slycurgus	mm, i got a nice cheap one (like $1.50) but it's a bare chip
2016-09-23 18:45:52	slycurgus	so i get to learn quite a bit
2016-09-23 18:46:16	slycurgus	also, a friend pointed out to me that i didn't need a 32-bit chip just to work with a number that exceeds 16-bit space
2016-09-23 18:46:27	slycurgus	so i could have had a nice simple 8-bit chip or something
2016-09-23 18:46:29	slycurgus	oh well
2016-09-23 18:48:57	jrobeson	picking chips based on that isn't reasonable
2016-09-23 18:48:58		[18:48]
2016-09-23 18:49:14	slycurgus	it's the first time i'd picked a chip for anything
2016-09-23 18:49:15	jrobeson	you should pick chips based on how much information is available, how vibrant the community is, etc
2016-09-23 18:49:25	slycurgus	sure
2016-09-23 18:49:38	slycurgus	but i wouldn't know where to look for that stuff anyway :V
2016-09-23 18:49:47	jrobeson	that's easy. subscribe to hackaday 
2016-09-23 18:49:58	jrobeson	and of course, there's the AVR chips that arduino uses
2016-09-23 18:50:00	slycurgus	that's the easy part, then i have to read things
2016-09-23 18:50:03	jrobeson	those are 8 bit
2016-09-23 18:50:20	jrobeson	what's wrong with reading things?
2016-09-23 18:50:33	slycurgus	i hardly have enough time in the day to *do* things
2016-09-23 18:50:42	slycurgus	if i add reading time i will literally not have time to sleep
2016-09-23 18:50:45	slycurgus	:P
2016-09-23 18:50:52	jrobeson	so it's even more important to pick something that's well used
2016-09-23 18:50:56	slycurgus	just gotta forge ahead blindly
2016-09-23 18:50:57	jrobeson	might as well buy an arduino instead
2016-09-23 18:51:02	slycurgus	i have an arduino
2016-09-23 18:51:12	slycurgus	i wanted an mcu :P
2016-09-23 18:51:27	slycurgus	as in, one i can build into a custom board
2016-09-23 18:51:45	jrobeson	thus you should use the AVR then
2016-09-23 18:51:53	jrobeson	aka the one arduino is based on
2016-09-23 18:52:07	slycurgus	mm, i'll see how i go with this one
2016-09-23 18:52:08	slycurgus	or
2016-09-23 18:52:10	slycurgus	hm
2016-09-23 18:52:16	slycurgus	i haven't bought a programmer yet
2016-09-23 18:52:28	slycurgus	and it's a fairly hefty investment compared to the chip
2016-09-23 18:52:29	jrobeson	you can use the arduino as a programmer
2016-09-23 18:52:39	slycurgus	ah, i wondered about that as well
2016-09-23 18:52:53	slycurgus	i just have to talk serial to the chip's data in and out pins, right?
2016-09-23 18:52:55	jrobeson	i don't know about for your particular MCU, but for other AVR chips
2016-09-23 18:53:06	fauxm	talk serial to me, baby
2016-09-23 18:53:10	slycurgus	i sort of wasn't sure why i needed $40 worth of USB thingo for it
2016-09-23 18:53:24	jrobeson	an other reason i suggest AVR.. is that there are even games online that use AVR assembly
2016-09-23 18:53:29	jrobeson	ever heard of microcorruption?
2016-09-23 18:53:33	slycurgus	nope
2016-09-23 18:53:43	jrobeson	https://microcorruption.com/login
2016-09-23 18:53:56	jrobeson	so if you know AVR assembly, you can play games like that too

2016-09-23 18:54:11	jrobeson	that's not the case for most mcus
2016-09-23 18:54:13	slycurgus	heh
2016-09-23 18:54:15	slycurgus	mm
2016-09-23 18:54:22	slycurgus	well, this application is stupidly simple
2016-09-23 18:54:32	slycurgus	really don't need a full 32 bit cpu for it heh
2016-09-23 18:54:46	slycurgus	i summarised the entire application logic in like 9 words the other day
2016-09-23 18:54:53	slycurgus	(probably more but you get the idea)
2016-09-23 18:55:28	jrobeson	I'd never choose a baseline based on that.. that'd be a factor after community (although in this case AVR does fulfill that)
2016-09-23 18:57:28	slycurgus	well, i'll see how i go with this one
2016-09-23 18:57:46	slycurgus	and probably my next project, whatever it may be, will be informed a lot better than this one
2016-09-23 18:58:20	slycurgus	if i recall, when i bought the parts i mentioned it to you and you were like "oh i can help you choose the right MCU!" and i was like ".... i already bought one based on 'what's cheapest' >_> "
2016-09-23 18:58:30	slycurgus	so yeah next time i know to ask first :P
2016-09-23 18:59:14	slycurgus	or, heck, this chip was so cheap that i bought 2 in case i released magic smoke from one... so if this one works well i might just use the spare for whatever's next

2016-09-23 20:11:33	+slycurgus	but it wasn't me you were talking to about that :P
2016-09-23 20:11:43	+fauxm	wait
2016-09-23 20:11:50	+fauxm	you're right
2016-09-23 20:11:54	+slycurgus	:3
2016-09-23 20:12:07	+fauxm	was it jrobeson ?
2016-09-23 20:12:07		[20:12]
2016-09-23 20:12:12	+slycurgus	i think so
2016-09-23 20:12:16	+fauxm	I can't remember shit
2016-09-23 20:12:26	 *	slycurgus scrolls up
2016-09-23 20:12:27	+slycurgus	yep
2016-09-23 20:12:30	jrobeson	yes it was me
2016-09-23 20:12:32	+fauxm	plus I closed the window to try and fix my weird error of things happening
2016-09-23 20:12:39	+fauxm	too lazy to search logs
2016-09-23 20:12:41	+fauxm	thanks lol
2016-09-23 20:13:02	+slycurgus	i keep meaning to make myself a script to search my logs
2016-09-23 20:13:11	jrobeson	or just use grep 
2016-09-23 20:13:19	+slycurgus	so i don't have to grep <word> <full path to log file>
2016-09-23 20:13:28	+slycurgus	mm but tab-completing the path is tedious
2016-09-23 20:13:51	+slycurgus	since generally i want to look in a specific channel's log
2016-09-23 20:14:07	+fauxm	yeah
2016-09-23 20:14:13	+slycurgus	would be nice to just be like "loggrep gtk2 r/linux" or something
2016-09-23 20:14:31	jrobeson	then just make an alias then
2016-09-23 20:14:35	+slycurgus	but not sure how i'd get it to e.g. add missing # to the start of it
2016-09-23 20:14:37	+slycurgus	hmm i guess
2016-09-23 20:14:47	+fauxm	grep foo ~/irclogs/freenode\#r_linux is tedius
2016-09-23 20:14:51	+slycurgus	i'd have to glob the filename a bit but that's probably fine
2016-09-23 20:15:01	jrobeson	ah, so weechat uses # for the log names too?
2016-09-23 20:15:04	+slycurgus	yeah
2016-09-23 20:15:05	jrobeson	i figured they might omit them
2016-09-23 20:15:05	+fauxm	this channel especially since the hash needs to be escaped
2016-09-23 20:15:08	+fauxm	I use irssi
2016-09-23 20:15:14	jrobeson	ah, so in both irssi and weechat

2016-09-23 20:15:36	+fauxm	wii chat
2016-09-23 20:15:39	jrobeson	hah
2016-09-23 20:15:46	jrobeson	i fixed a segfault 
2016-09-23 20:15:50	+slycurgus	yay
2016-09-23 20:16:08	+fauxm	what'd ya fix?
2016-09-23 20:16:12	jrobeson	uggh.. i don't wanna learn docker :(
2016-09-23 20:16:22	jrobeson	also running docker wouold just slow the whole testing thing down
2016-09-23 20:16:24	+fauxm	I don't think it's that complicated
2016-09-23 20:16:30	+slycurgus	fauxm: jeez lern2read he JUST said it was a segfault
2016-09-23 20:16:32	+slycurgus	yeesh
2016-09-23 20:16:35	+fauxm	lol
2016-09-23 20:16:37	+slycurgus	:P
2016-09-23 20:16:37	jrobeson	ha
2016-09-23 20:16:38	+fauxm	I meant what was causing it ;p
2016-09-23 20:16:50	+slycurgus	i'm well aware, i just love being a shit :3
2016-09-23 20:16:51	+fauxm	plus since it's a container, performance should be pretty close to native
2016-09-23 20:16:56	+fauxm	I figured
2016-09-23 20:16:59	+fauxm	I do to, so it's okay
2016-09-23 20:17:28	jrobeson	so we generally treat paths as bytes in beets.  however many python libraries don't 
2016-09-23 20:17:45	jrobeson	i was missing a conversion of a bytestring path to a real string for python3
2016-09-23 20:17:48	+fauxm	ahhhh
2016-09-23 20:17:50	+fauxm	right
2016-09-23 20:17:57	+fauxm	earlier in another channel, someone who was going to china said the chinese food was better
2016-09-23 20:17:59	jrobeson	since python2 strings are bytes while in python 3 they are text/characters
2016-09-23 20:18:11	+fauxm	to which I replied "wait, the chinese food in china is better than it is in the US?"
2016-09-23 20:18:14	+fauxm	right,
2016-09-23 20:18:17	jrobeson	and our test suite wasn't actually testing them which is how we didn't notice
2016-09-23 20:18:52	jrobeson	because pygobject is not available via pip!
2016-09-23 20:19:09	jrobeson	so since we use virtualenvs for tsting them, it doesn't use packages in site-package/dist-packages by default
2016-09-23 20:19:29	+slycurgus	fauxm: US Chinese food is practically its own thing
2016-09-23 20:19:37	+slycurgus	it's more like chin-ish :P
2016-09-23 20:19:43	jrobeson	so i finally figured out the deps I needed, and the toggles in the .travis.yml to actually make the tests run
2016-09-23 20:19:45	+fauxm	chinish
2016-09-23 20:19:46	+slycurgus	see: fortune cookies
2016-09-23 20:20:00	jrobeson	slycurgus, can you buy american style chinese food in australia?
2016-09-23 20:20:04	+slycurgus	note: slycurgus has never eaten in america
2016-09-23 20:20:22	+slycurgus	jrobeson: nop, but i imagine our take on chinese food is similarly not-quite-authentic
2016-09-23 20:20:36	jrobeson	well maybe it's very similiar 
2016-09-23 20:20:42	+slycurgus	or maybe it's pretty good, idk
2016-09-23 20:20:54	jrobeson	do you have lots of restaraunts named like   china one, or great buffet?
2016-09-23 20:21:05	+slycurgus	not that i know of
2016-09-23 20:21:07	jrobeson	hah
2016-09-23 20:21:18	+slycurgus	certainly no chains of chinese food that i've heard of
2016-09-23 20:21:24	+slycurgus	they're usually smaller local places
2016-09-23 20:21:32	jrobeson	but you do know that the american style chinese food places are actually run by chinese people right?
2016-09-23 20:21:46	jrobeson	i've never been to one that isn't run by chinese people 
2016-09-23 20:22:02	+slycurgus	heh yeah, but i assume both here and there they 'dumb down' the dishes a bit for the locals
2016-09-23 20:22:06	jrobeson	definitely
2016-09-23 20:22:13	+fauxm	firefox is telling me flash is disabled, even though flash isn't disabled
2016-09-23 20:22:17	jrobeson	more fried, and more sweet, less spicy
2016-09-23 20:22:19	+fauxm	wat
2016-09-23 20:22:20	+slycurgus	mm
2016-09-23 20:22:25	+slycurgus	less pig trotter, etc
2016-09-23 20:22:32	+slycurgus	(not none, just less)
2016-09-23 20:22:32	jrobeson	this is probably what iw as telling you fauxm 
2016-09-23 20:22:37	+slycurgus	chicken foot etc etc
2016-09-23 20:22:44	jrobeson	yeah no chicken feet
2016-09-23 20:22:54	+slycurgus	i've seen chicken feet in a store here
2016-09-23 20:22:57	jrobeson	although you can get that at american sould food restaurants
2016-09-23 20:23:02	jrobeson	soul food*
2016-09-23 20:23:07	+slycurgus	not in a dish, just for people to take home and use in a dish
2016-09-23 20:23:13	jrobeson	i'm sure you folks have no equivalent to that there :)
2016-09-23 20:23:15	+slycurgus	that was in chinatown in sydney though
2016-09-23 20:23:32	+slycurgus	mm idk exactly what soul food is - american south?
2016-09-23 20:23:37	+fauxm	jrobeson: I loaded a swf, it started playing, noscript blocked it, I allowed it, then firefox was like "nop"
2016-09-23 20:23:38	jrobeson	mostly
2016-09-23 20:23:47	+slycurgus	i assume we have bits and pieces here but i think the closest we have is 'american bbq'
2016-09-23 20:23:47	+fauxm	and yeah, soulfood is southern stuff
2016-09-23 20:23:51	jrobeson	fauxm, was the plugin-container process running?
2016-09-23 20:23:57	jrobeson	but it's not bbq .. or not just bbq..
2016-09-23 20:24:05	+slycurgus	which they probably have a couple of soul dishes but not a full range
2016-09-23 20:24:09	+slycurgus	yeah
2016-09-23 20:24:12	+fauxm	yes
2016-09-23 20:24:16	jrobeson	Soul food is a variety of cuisine that comes from the traditional dishes of the southern United States and originated from the food consumed by slaves and freedmen; later to become a staple of African-American culture. The term may have originated in the mid-1960s, when soul was a common word used to describe African-American culture (for example, soul music).
2016-09-23 20:24:27	+fauxm	plugin container is running
2016-09-23 20:25:13	jrobeson	i just learned something
2016-09-23 20:25:15	jrobeson	"To a far greater degree than anyone realizes, several of the most important food dishes that the Native Americans of the southeastern U.S.A live on today is the "soul food" eaten by both Black and White Southerners. Hominy, for example, is still eaten: Sofkee lives on as grits; cornbread [is] used by Southern cooks; Indian fritters -- variously known as "hoe cake" or "Johnny cake"; Indian boiled cornbread is present in Southern cuisine as 
2016-09-23 20:25:16	jrobeson	"corn meal dumplings" and "hush puppies"; Southerners cook their beans and field peas by boiling them, as did the Native tribes; and, like the Native Americans, Southerners cured their meats and smoked it over hickory coals..."
2016-09-23 20:26:21	jrobeson	OMG
2016-09-23 20:26:24	jrobeson	this is a thing

2016-09-23 20:33:00	jrobeson	i already know about taco rice :)
2016-09-23 20:33:04	+slycurgus	also, bleh, it's been too long since i used Eagle, i don't really remember all the ins and outs

2016-09-23 20:33:15	jrobeson	my cousin was stationed in okinawa

2016-09-23 20:33:40	+slycurgus	jrobeson: million-to-one shot, is your cousin called Wolfgang
2016-09-23 20:34:40	jrobeson	no. she's a she
2016-09-23 20:34:44	+slycurgus	ah
2016-09-23 20:34:51	+slycurgus	....she could still be called Wolfgang!
2016-09-23 20:34:57	+slycurgus	but she wouldn't be the one i knew :P
2016-09-23 20:35:14	jrobeson	i've never known a lady who goes by that name!

2016-09-23 20:55:57	jrobeson	so what iw as saying about docker fauxm is that I'd have to add it to the ci system on every build. so it'll slow down things massively
2016-09-23 20:56:13	+fauxm	yeah, tghat's true
2016-09-23 20:56:20	+fauxm	I thought you were talking about application performance
2016-09-23 20:56:29	jrobeson	just overall testing time. from start to finish
2016-09-23 20:56:35	+fauxm	then I realized you could have been talking about the slowdown of actually doing it
2016-09-23 20:56:59	jrobeson	that's be totally fine, and since it's a cli application, it wouldn't require any trickery
2016-09-23 20:57:20	jrobeson	it's just that travis only has ubuntu 14.04, and we can't even install with the base dependencies on that.
2016-09-23 20:57:35	jrobeson	so we can't even build packages for it
2016-09-23 21:03:00		[20:57]

2016-09-24 00:33:56	jrobeson	[06:24:15] Soul food is a variety of cuisine that comes from the traditional dishes of the southern United States and originated from the food consumed by slaves and freedmen; later to become a staple of African-American culture. The term may have originated in the mid-1960s, when soul was a common word used to describe African-American culture (for example, soul music). [06:24:15]

2016-09-24 00:33:56	jrobeson	[06:25:12] i just learned something [06:25:12]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	jrobeson	[06:25:14] "To a far greater degree than anyone realizes, several of the most important food dishes that the Native Americans of the southeastern U.S.A live on today is the "soul food" eaten by both Black and White Southerners. Hominy, for example, is still eaten: Sofkee lives on as grits; cornbread [is] used by Southern cooks; Indian fritters -- variously known as "hoe cake" or "Johnny cake"; Indian boiled cornbread is present in Southern cuisine as  [06:25:14]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	jrobeson	[06:25:15] "corn meal dumplings" and "hush puppies"; Southerners cook their beans and field peas by boiling them, as did the Native tribes; and, like the Native Americans, Southerners cured their meats and smoked it over hickory coals..." [06:25:15]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	jrobeson	[06:26:21] OMG [06:26:21]

2016-09-24 00:33:56	jrobeson	[06:33:24] also, i saw it in anthony bourdain's show [06:33:24]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	+slycurgus	[06:33:39] jrobeson: million-to-one shot, is your cousin called Wolfgang [06:33:39]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	jrobeson	[06:34:39] no. she's a she [06:34:39]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	+slycurgus	[06:34:43] ah [06:34:43]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	+slycurgus	[06:34:50] ....she could still be called Wolfgang! [06:34:50]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	+slycurgus	[06:34:56] but she wouldn't be the one i knew :P [06:34:56]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	jrobeson	[06:35:13] i've never known a lady who goes by that name! [06:35:13]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	+slycurgus	[06:35:20] there's gotta be one somewhere [06:35:20]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	+slycurgus	[06:35:34] 7+ billion people [06:35:34]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	+slycurgus	[06:55:40] why does nobody have an eagle part for this chip [06:55:40]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	 *	slycurgus [06:55:44] has chosen poorly [06:55:44]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	jrobeson	[06:55:56] so what iw as saying about docker fauxm is that I'd have to add it to the ci system on every build. so it'll slow down things massively [06:55:56]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	+fauxm	[06:56:12] yeah, tghat's true [06:56:12]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	+fauxm	[06:56:19] I thought you were talking about application performance [06:56:19]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	jrobeson	[06:56:28] just overall testing time. from start to finish [06:56:28]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	+fauxm	[06:56:34] then I realized you could have been talking about the slowdown of actually doing it [06:56:34]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	jrobeson	[06:56:58] that's be totally fine, and since it's a cli application, it wouldn't require any trickery [06:56:58]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	jrobeson	[06:57:19] it's just that travis only has ubuntu 14.04, and we can't even install with the base dependencies on that. [06:57:19]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	jrobeson	[06:57:34] so we can't even build packages for it [06:57:34]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	jrobeson	[07:05:42] who knows when travis will get a chance to add 16.04 [07:05:42]

2016-09-24 12:54:02	slycurgus	except i'd basically treat the comic panels as a storyboard already, so the final movie would be multiple continuous hours

2016-09-24 12:54:31	slycurgus	forcing hollywood to cut the good bits out of books etc
2016-09-24 12:55:54	logiz	heh
2016-09-24 12:56:15	logiz	see what book nerds don't understand is that it's more efficient to watch a movie
2016-09-24 12:56:27	logiz	unless you speed read, which most people can't
2016-09-24 12:56:34	logiz	and that get tiring

2016-09-24 12:59:05	slycurgus	so make it longer fuckers and lemme watch it
2016-09-24 12:59:21	logiz	lol I would hate that
2016-09-24 12:59:34	logiz	you kidding me, I've been watching shows all day, and every 5 minutes I take a 15 minute break
2016-09-24 12:59:42	slycurgus	lol
2016-09-24 12:59:54	logiz	but then again, I guess I kind of do like binge watching certain shows
2016-09-24 13:00:16	logiz	get rid of the fluff, and have a 5 hour movie that flows kind of between that and a tv series, and it'd probably be good
2016-09-24 13:00:20	logiz	more time for character development
2016-09-24 13:00:33	logiz	oh I should watch another gits movie
2016-09-24 13:05:58	slycurgus	building this schematic got a lot easier once i remembered i could just name the wires rather than explicitly connecting them all

2016-09-24 13:07:19	slycurgus	>_>
2016-09-24 13:10:32	jrobeson	i just want more shows that are like long movies
2016-09-24 13:10:36	jrobeson	like stranger things for example
2016-09-24 13:12:43	slycurgus	yes
2016-09-24 13:14:48	slycurgus	i've still got a bit of a lump on my finger from getting tossed from the boat during white-water rafting
2016-09-24 13:14:48		[13:14]
2016-09-24 13:14:52	slycurgus	and that was 3 weeks ago
2016-09-24 13:15:01	slycurgus	it's almost gone though
2016-09-24 13:19:50	slycurgus	argh i just realised i did a dumb
2016-09-24 13:19:52	slycurgus	oh well
2016-09-24 13:22:14	logiz	name the wires?
2016-09-24 13:22:23	slycurgus	nah, dumber than that
2016-09-24 13:22:34	logiz	"i'm going to call you red, cause you're the color red"
2016-09-24 13:22:40	slycurgus	i have this part (an LED driver) that i couldn't find a part for
2016-09-24 13:22:53	logiz	man stranger things was terrible
2016-09-24 13:22:59	slycurgus	it's a QSOP-16 package, so i just grabbed some random part in the same package
2016-09-24 13:23:11	logiz	jrobeson: utopia is like a long movie
2016-09-24 13:23:20	slycurgus	but this driver has an extra pad on the underside, and i don't think that's standard
2016-09-24 13:23:31	logiz	heh
2016-09-24 13:24:11	slycurgus	it would take me like... 20 minutes maybe, to put a schematic together for this part
2016-09-24 13:24:19	slycurgus	probably longer because it's been ages since i did it
2016-09-24 13:24:38	slycurgus	orrrrrrr, i could just manually stick a solder pad on the board under the chip
2016-09-24 13:24:43	slycurgus	>_>
2016-09-24 13:26:30	jrobeson	maybe you can teach me how to do that stuff slycurgus :)
2016-09-24 13:27:01	slycurgus	maybe :) but i just google my way along, heh
2016-09-24 13:27:09	slycurgus	only kinda know the basic functions i think
2016-09-24 13:27:44	slycurgus	add parts, connect wires between the parts, switch to board layout mode and click "auto-route" to get it to put the traces so they don't overlap ;P
2016-09-24 13:28:29	jrobeson	designing a board can't be that easy can it?
2016-09-24 13:28:31	jrobeson	hmm
2016-09-24 13:28:48	jrobeson	but i guess it doesn't help you making sure that you have the right other components though
2016-09-24 13:28:56	jrobeson	like say a current protection diode
2016-09-24 13:28:59	slycurgus	it's not super hard tbh, i got the last one done in a couple of weeks i think
2016-09-24 13:29:12	slycurgus	yeah, you need to have all that stuff sorted separately
2016-09-24 13:29:25	slycurgus	there's a library of parts but no recommendations of what you need for what
2016-09-24 13:29:30	slycurgus	just the footprints and pin names
2016-09-24 13:29:35	jrobeson	it's too bad it can't at least figure out the basics for you by the data you put it for the parts
2016-09-24 13:29:58	jrobeson	like if you label a pin as 5v, and hook it up to a part with 3v pins.. it could yell at you :)
2016-09-24 13:29:58		[13:29]
2016-09-24 13:30:01	slycurgus	so you can put a chip in with a VCC pin, but it can't know that you should put a capacitor to ground along with it
2016-09-24 13:30:13	slycurgus	mm, i think it has that kind of feature actually
2016-09-24 13:30:19	slycurgus	i just don't know how to use it :P
2016-09-24 13:30:29	slycurgus	all my stuff can run on 5 for this project i think
2016-09-24 13:30:30	jrobeson	kicad is what i was going to look into
2016-09-24 13:30:31	slycurgus	>_>
2016-09-24 13:30:52	jrobeson	most parts i've dealt with are 3v parts
2016-09-24 13:30:54	jrobeson	3.3v*
2016-09-24 13:30:57	slycurgus	mm, i think i tried kicad but didn't really get it... maybe i just didn't see the right tutorial
2016-09-24 13:31:09	jrobeson	well it's probably not as easy as other things
2016-09-24 13:31:22	slycurgus	yeah, this LED driver is a 3.3 but it can take 5 i think
2016-09-24 13:32:09	slycurgus	so i guess it's multi-mode more than "a 3.3"

2016-09-24 13:33:13	jrobeson	vin isn't the only concern from my understanding. the other pins also have to be tolerant
2016-09-24 13:33:29	slycurgus	mm yeah
2016-09-24 13:33:47	jrobeson	it's too bad that the default arduino is still 5v only
2016-09-24 13:34:09	jrobeson	i run into way more 3.3v components

2016-09-24 13:34:23	slycurgus	this one doesn't state a max for HIGH
2016-09-24 13:34:26	slycurgus	just min 2.4
2016-09-24 13:34:27	logiz	[M#??wait what?
2016-09-24 13:34:31	logiz	5v only?
2016-09-24 13:34:33	jrobeson	i hear that we'll be seeing more 1.8v components soon
2016-09-24 13:34:37	slycurgus	logiz: GPIO
2016-09-24 13:34:47	jrobeson	nah it's not 5v only really.. it does have a 3.3v output pin
2016-09-24 13:34:50	slycurgus	has a 3.3v supply out, but the logic goes to 5
2016-09-24 13:35:00	logiz	ah
2016-09-24 13:35:05	logiz	I assumed it just did both
2016-09-24 13:35:10	jrobeson	it sorta does..
2016-09-24 13:35:13	jrobeson	but not nicely
2016-09-24 13:35:18	jrobeson	better if it was the opposite
2016-09-24 13:35:24	slycurgus	you can just stick a level shifter in between it
2016-09-24 13:35:31	jrobeson	at least you can get any voltage out of the vin pin 
2016-09-24 13:35:37	jrobeson	even 12v
2016-09-24 13:35:37	slycurgus	lots of places have one on a breakout board etc
2016-09-24 13:35:53	jrobeson	i mean with the appropriate supply
2016-09-24 13:35:54	logiz	I think I'm going to try to get back into this microcontroller stuff soon
2016-09-24 13:35:55	slycurgus	so you just get the arduino and a level shifter shield or whatever
2016-09-24 13:36:06	logiz	I figured I don't have to worry about soldering, just breadboard everything, and take it with me wherver I go
2016-09-24 13:36:15	logiz	but then I realized I live in new york, probably a bad idea to have a bag full of wires
2016-09-24 13:36:24	slycurgus	mm, soldering is pretty easy if you need to though
2016-09-24 13:36:35	logiz	it's not so much the soldering, it's the annoyance of it
2016-09-24 13:36:44	logiz	I don't have a well ventilated room, or really any place to solder nicely

2016-09-24 13:37:13	logiz	heh exactly
2016-09-24 13:37:16	slycurgus	i've got this thing half-prototyped on a project board at the moment

2016-09-24 13:37:41	slycurgus	and my components are all SMD (for the final version) so board design it is :P

2016-09-24 16:09:53	slycurgus	i tend to just get whatever as a haircut because 99.99% of the time i can't see it, so it's meaningless to me
2016-09-24 16:10:09	slycurgus	my main concern is that it doesn't bother my face or ears

2016-09-24 17:26:05	logiz	fu slycurgus 
2016-09-24 17:26:27	slycurgus	? :< :<
2016-09-24 17:27:13	logiz	you're too consistent with time
2016-09-24 17:27:24	logiz	I only like wallabies that don't keep a watch in their pouch
2016-09-24 17:27:40	slycurgus	i don't have a watch
2016-09-24 17:27:46	slycurgus	though i am thinking of making one
2016-09-24 17:27:56	slycurgus	when i'm done with this microcontroller project
2016-09-24 17:28:24	logiz	lol
2016-09-24 17:28:46	 *	logiz watches slycurgus make a 300$ watch so huge that not even an arduino looks big next to it
2016-09-24 17:28:47	slycurgus	it wouldn't help me keep time though
2016-09-24 17:29:02	slycurgus	i want it to do this: http://i.imgur.com/RS3GU.gif
2016-09-24 17:29:05	logiz	neither do any of the watches people wear these days
2016-09-24 17:29:10	logiz	they're all "count your steps" bullshit
2016-09-24 17:29:21	slycurgus	so people will be like "what time is it" and i'll be like "...tick. no wait tock. no wait--"
2016-09-24 17:29:47	logiz	TICK
2016-09-24 17:29:49	logiz	TOCK

2016-09-24 17:29:56	logiz	KCIT?
2016-09-24 17:33:06	slycurgus	yes
2016-09-24 17:33:06		[17:33]
2016-09-24 17:33:22	slycurgus	logiz: i also have a step counter thingo
2016-09-24 17:33:35	slycurgus	so idk how that's going to interact with the desire to wear a watch
2016-09-24 17:39:00		[17:33]
2016-09-24 17:40:46	logiz	heh
2016-09-24 17:40:53	logiz	make your step counter show tick tock?
2016-09-24 17:41:37	slycurgus	nah it's a Fitbit Flex
2016-09-24 17:41:42	slycurgus	it has 5 LEDs and that's it
2016-09-24 17:41:53	slycurgus	no actual display
2016-09-24 17:46:41	slycurgus	it's early days for the wristwatch project but i'm thinking i can get one of the teeny little generators they use for charging battery watches, and a stepper motor and some tiny mcu to just do a loop sleeping for a second
2016-09-24 17:47:10	slycurgus	best part is that because there's no long-term timekeeping i don't have to set it if the power goes flat
2016-09-24 17:47:19	slycurgus	could probably just stick a capacitor in there
2016-09-24 17:47:26	slycurgus	idk
2016-09-24 17:49:24	logiz	hmm
2016-09-24 17:49:30	logiz	I need to figure out xlib
2016-09-24 17:50:33	slycurgus	just in general? or doing something specific?
2016-09-24 17:51:32	logiz	I've had a project I've been meaning to work on for like 2 years
2016-09-24 17:51:41	logiz	I've had a couple of hacks every now and again but meh
2016-09-24 17:51:52	logiz	the thing is, I did write an xlib program once, and I fucking hated it
2016-09-24 17:51:54	slycurgus	i know that feel
2016-09-24 17:51:57	slycurgus	heh
2016-09-24 17:51:57	logiz	to do something so simple it was callback hell
2016-09-24 17:52:06	slycurgus	why use it now then?
2016-09-24 17:52:13	logiz	I was getting all excited to use wayland instead
2016-09-24 17:52:28	logiz	but when I read about wayland like a year ago I didn't understand those tech docs and didn't want to waste my time writing a wrapper for something
2016-09-24 17:52:36	logiz	I was hoping to be "the guy that ported shit"
2016-09-24 17:52:45	logiz	slycurgus: cause it's for ~fun~
2016-09-24 17:52:53	logiz	slycurgus: I've been really into automation lately
2016-09-24 17:53:03	logiz	see the thing is automation jobs suck
2016-09-24 17:53:07	slycurgus	"i hated it" "doing it for fun" <-- choose one
2016-09-24 17:53:08	logiz	well the ones that say they are usually
2016-09-24 17:53:08	slycurgus	:V
2016-09-24 17:53:17	logiz	cause it's all QA shit
2016-09-24 17:53:30	logiz	and QA is pretty low on the pay scale
2016-09-24 17:53:35	slycurgus	"automation" == "we used to pay 10 people to do this, now the computer does it and you get to check its work"
2016-09-24 17:53:37	logiz	it's an "introduction to technology job"
2016-09-24 17:53:39	logiz	couldn't get it
2016-09-24 17:53:43	logiz	became developer instead
2016-09-24 17:53:44	logiz	lol
2016-09-24 17:53:47	slycurgus	heh
2016-09-24 17:54:16	logiz	well I mean there are def high paying automation jobs that aren't qa, such as the people that automate others out of jobs
2016-09-24 17:54:16		[17:54]
2016-09-24 17:54:28	logiz	but they are probably called something else, I wouldn't even know where to look
2016-09-24 17:54:32	logiz	probably trader stuff for sure
2016-09-24 17:54:38	slycurgus	well yeah but your ultimate goal for that is to put yourself out of work haha
2016-09-24 17:54:38	logiz	I'd love to get a trader job
2016-09-24 17:54:43	logiz	fucking they're using python now
2016-09-24 17:54:49	slycurgus	really?
2016-09-24 17:54:52	logiz	yup
2016-09-24 17:54:58	slycurgus	i would have thought it was too slow
2016-09-24 17:54:59	logiz	slycurgus: python is HUGE these days
2016-09-24 17:55:03	logiz	well
2016-09-24 17:55:04	slycurgus	i guess if they jit the hell out of it
2016-09-24 17:55:09	logiz	for their absolutely critical stuff it's still c++
2016-09-24 17:55:13	logiz	but a lot of it is python too now
2016-09-24 17:55:13	slycurgus	right, ok
2016-09-24 17:55:28	logiz	so what a lot of companeis do is they write c++ for their nano second stuff and then call it with python
2016-09-24 17:55:31	slycurgus	so the subsystem is C++ and then the algorithm on top is python, or whatever
2016-09-24 17:55:32	slycurgus	yeah
2016-09-24 17:55:44	logiz	so, say I'm doing analytics on trading
2016-09-24 17:55:46	logiz	write that in python
2016-09-24 17:55:53	logiz	cause it's not super time sensative, just needs to be able to read a bunch of shit
2016-09-24 17:56:02	logiz	actually doing trades, you want to be first
2016-09-24 17:56:04	slycurgus	mm
2016-09-24 17:56:09	logiz	also a lot of banks are moving to python
2016-09-24 17:56:33	logiz	I probably shouldn't say which ones, but there are two really big ones I know of off the top of my head, and a few foreign/international ones
2016-09-24 17:56:38	logiz	it's crazy
2016-09-24 17:56:48	logiz	python has been out since before WWW, and now it's become the hot shit
2016-09-24 17:56:54	slycurgus	heh
2016-09-24 17:56:56	logiz	companies are dropping ruby if they're not indebted to ruby
2016-09-24 17:57:02	logiz	this all has happened in like a 3 year time span
2016-09-24 17:57:17	logiz	a lot of people ask why, the reason is, cause python is super simple
2016-09-24 17:57:30	logiz	people ask me every week why I use python and I say something like "i'm not smart enough to know c++"
2016-09-24 17:57:41	slycurgus	huge wealth of developers, or at least people who know enough to learn the rest
2016-09-24 17:58:02	slycurgus	like, "have you used python?" "yeah a bit" "cool we can teach you the rest"
2016-09-24 17:58:28	slycurgus	"have you used C++?" "yeah a bit" "go get a CS degree and then come see us"
2016-09-24 17:58:35	logiz	lol
2016-09-24 17:58:44	logiz	so I want to get a book on programming patterns
2016-09-24 17:58:46	logiz	that's not academic
2016-09-24 17:59:07	slycurgus	i hate to tell you this bud but the jacquard loom has been invented
2016-09-24 17:59:13	logiz	cause acadmic patterns, I mean it's helpful to think about for a real problem, but for something super quick and simple, there's usually just a better way to do it
2016-09-24 17:59:14	slycurgus	nobody needs patterns programmed anymore
2016-09-24 17:59:22	logiz	and I hate going "I know there is a better way but I'm not doing it"
2016-09-24 17:59:30	slycurgus	mm
2016-09-24 17:59:39	logiz	like I seriously get tripped up by stupid shit
2016-09-24 17:59:47	slycurgus	"this *feels* clumsy but i don't know how to make it not"
2016-09-24 18:00:06	logiz	it's usually of the type "I can write all the parts of it in individual functions, but I shouldn't"
2016-09-24 18:00:26	logiz	so how do you break up the code, abstract it correctly the first time, have the forsight for how it's going to look in the end
2016-09-24 18:00:34	logiz	I mean a lot of it is just experience
2016-09-24 18:00:44	logiz	but I have a lot of experience of writing stupid scripts
2016-09-24 18:00:50	+Gr33n3gg	well, yeah
2016-09-24 18:01:26	slycurgus	"a lot of it is just experience" welcome to life son
2016-09-24 18:01:28	logiz	I was asked at work the other day how to do some crazy file system thing, and I was like "oh that's simple" then I wrote a huge line wrapped one line bash script full with pipes, redirects, and shit
2016-09-24 18:01:31	logiz	and then I lolled
2016-09-24 18:01:36	slycurgus	lol
2016-09-24 18:01:44	slycurgus	"that's simple" *does complex thing*
2016-09-24 18:02:01	slycurgus	"that's simple but idk how so here have this unmaintainable mess, enjoy"
2016-09-24 18:02:04	logiz	not that it's complex, it was for a one off thing so I didn't care to think about it too much, I knew how I'd sript it
2016-09-24 18:02:05	slycurgus	:P
2016-09-24 18:02:22	logiz	I think the answer as as simple as two for loops, and putting variables before the loops
2016-09-24 18:02:30	logiz	other person didn't really realize that I guess
2016-09-24 18:02:47	slycurgus	"when you put this in a shell script just put a comment above it saying "DONT CHANGE THIS" and then you don't have to worry about maintaining it"
2016-09-24 18:02:54	slycurgus	simple!
2016-09-24 18:03:19	logiz	lol

2016-09-24 20:28:31	slycurgus	oh, forgot to mention
2016-09-24 20:28:35	slycurgus	went to the hardware store
2016-09-24 20:28:39	slycurgus	got electrical stugg
2016-09-24 20:28:42	slycurgus	stuff*
2016-09-24 20:28:44	slycurgus	BUT
2016-09-24 20:29:02	slycurgus	i couldn't really figure out what i wanted to mount the thing on
2016-09-24 20:29:17	slycurgus	so if i put what i have together it will be less 'lamp' and more 'electrical hazard'
2016-09-24 20:29:21	slycurgus	which doesn't seem great
2016-09-24 20:29:54	slycurgus	need to get a block of wood or something but the dimensions they had available weren't quite right and i don't have any tools or workspace
2016-09-24 20:29:56	slycurgus	>_>
2016-09-24 20:35:00		[20:29]
2016-09-24 21:01:06	slycurgus	i guess i'll hold off on it for a while
2016-09-24 21:01:06		[21:01]
2016-09-24 21:22:41	jrobeson	can you do it at that place you talked about?
2016-09-24 21:22:41		[21:22]
2016-09-24 21:22:50	slycurgus	probably, yes
2016-09-24 21:22:54	jrobeson	also you might wanna consider idling in ##electronics
2016-09-24 21:23:04	jrobeson	there's also ##pcb, but i have no idea how active it is
2016-09-24 21:23:08	slycurgus	that's sort of what i was thinking (the makerspace, not ##electronics)
2016-09-24 21:23:11	slycurgus	mm maybe
2016-09-24 21:23:32	jrobeson	fellow australians are there
2016-09-24 21:23:55	slycurgus	heh
2016-09-24 21:24:35	jrobeson	very helpful folks so far
2016-09-24 21:26:48	slycurgus	i guess all i need is a saw and a drill
2016-09-24 21:27:23	slycurgus	cut a plank into a square block, drill a blind hole in the centre, and one in one of the side faces to meet that centre hole
2016-09-24 21:27:50	slycurgus	then feed wire through that and connect it to the bulb holder
2016-09-24 21:28:18	slycurgus	i'll get to that when i get to it

2016-09-25 06:01:07	HappyMan	i'm switching to rkt
2016-09-25 06:01:11	logiz	the fuck is rkt
2016-09-25 06:01:19	HappyMan	even more pre-release than docker
2016-09-25 06:02:01	logiz	Due to a bug in the Linux kernel, using rkt's overlay support in conjunction with SELinux requires a set of patches that are only currently available on some Linux distributions (for example, CoreOS Linux). Work is ongoing to merge this work into the mainline Linux kernel (#1727).

2016-09-25 11:50:22	logiz	did you know that in the past 60 years of AI we've made almost no notable advances towards what we've considered general artificial intelligence?
2016-09-25 11:50:32	logiz	that all that machine learning is really just advanced pattern matching we were doing 20 years ago?
2016-09-25 11:50:51	logiz	that a roomba is no more than a stupid graph?
2016-09-25 11:50:54	logiz	or a dance

2016-09-25 11:54:11	slycurgus	that sounds like you'd swiftly need a second roomba to follow the first one around
2016-09-25 11:54:22	slycurgus	just get enough roombas to cover your floor entirely
2016-09-25 11:54:28	slycurgus	no more mess ever
2016-09-25 11:54:33	logiz	I'd just get those light up tiles that michael jackson has

2016-09-25 18:01:03	slycurgus	;)
2016-09-25 18:02:07	jrobeson	pattern matching and then fuzzing.. which is pretty much what we're doing with these commputers
2016-09-25 18:02:44	jrobeson	or maybe a little fuzzing and then pattern matching, depends on the situatin

2016-09-25 21:53:02	heftig	TIL google music on android will play ogg+opus files, which is quite nice
2016-09-25 21:54:02	slycurgus	jrobeson: how long is the song? i could only listen to it if it's less than the length of time i can maintain a swaggery 'haters gon h8' type walk
2016-09-25 21:54:14	jrobeson	it's definitely longer than that
2016-09-25 21:54:31	jrobeson	it's 3:05
2016-09-25 21:54:48	slycurgus	pshhh i can swagger for at least twenty
2016-09-25 21:54:52	slycurgus	..........secons
2016-09-25 21:54:53	jrobeson	oh really
2016-09-25 21:54:54	slycurgus	:<
2016-09-25 21:54:55	jrobeson	hah
2016-09-25 21:55:58	jrobeson	it's pop punky for sure
2016-09-25 21:57:02	jrobeson	i wonder if the amount of japanese bands singing in english is increasing so rapidly, or it just seems that way
2016-09-25 21:58:05	jrobeson	japanese people are suprisingly good at replicating some of the socal pop punk and emo voices
2016-09-25 22:04:00		[21:58]
2016-09-25 22:10:42	jrobeson	i also like how there's a band that's just called Chocolate Chip Cookies
2016-09-25 22:13:26	slycurgus	are you sure you're not just in the baking aisle at the store
2016-09-25 22:13:52	jrobeson	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS-bmGyyjBM
2016-09-25 22:16:20	jrobeson	as you can see.. no
2016-09-25 22:16:27	jrobeson	also, I wouldn't irc from the store (probably)
2016-09-25 22:16:46	jrobeson	I've never yet done so, but who knows 
2016-09-25 22:16:55	slycurgus	lol, i was kidding :V
2016-09-25 22:17:12	 *	slycurgus listens to the song
2016-09-25 22:17:30	jrobeson	i don't think it's my favorite by them. i just had forgotten about them until iwas browsing random videos
2016-09-25 22:17:38	jrobeson	finding that ska and emo music is still alive in japan
2016-09-25 22:19:18	slycurgus	hmm, idk, it's not bad but not exactly my taste at the moment i think
2016-09-25 22:19:18		[22:19]
2016-09-25 22:20:01	jrobeson	btw, there's also a band called special thanks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GnLxUKku8Y
2016-09-25 22:26:00		[22:20]
2016-09-25 22:26:29	jrobeson	hmm i found one where they did a video with another band. it's rare to run across a video with two bands together
2016-09-25 22:26:42	jrobeson	seen plenty where a different singer takes over , but not two bands at once
2016-09-25 22:28:40	jrobeson	i wish python 3.6 would come out now

2016-09-26 14:07:56	fauxm	I'd say a startup is like, a new company that has some cool hip idea and gets a bunch of VC
2016-09-26 14:08:06	slycurgus	but i guess you mean in the sense of you're not necessarily doing some industry-disrupting "we're the Uber of <thing>" etc

2016-09-26 17:50:48	jrobeson	slycurgus, you're so knowledgeable :(
2016-09-26 17:51:08	slycurgus	why sadface?
2016-09-26 17:51:38	slycurgus	and i don't think i'm *that* knowledgeable :V
2016-09-26 17:51:54	jrobeson	i shouldn't have sadfaced, because I don't wanna explain why
2016-09-26 17:51:54	slycurgus	i will prove it tonight by losing at trivia at the pub
2016-09-26 17:52:02	slycurgus	ok
2016-09-26 17:52:08	slycurgus	gotta be true to your feelings jrobeson 
2016-09-26 17:52:10	slycurgus	don't hide!
2016-09-26 17:52:16	slycurgus	(but i will let you hide this time)
2016-09-26 17:52:24	jrobeson	we should trivia 
2016-09-26 17:52:48	slycurgus	trivia is fun
2016-09-26 17:52:54	slycurgus	i'm bad at the sport stuff though
2016-09-26 17:52:59	slycurgus	and anything before about 1985
2016-09-26 17:53:01	slycurgus	>_>
2016-09-26 17:53:04	jrobeson	me too, but I might be better than you at sports
2016-09-26 17:53:21	jrobeson	i don't keep up with it, but it's hard to avoid all contact with it
2016-09-26 17:53:38	jrobeson	so i ended up absorbing enough to answer the occasional sports question
2016-09-26 17:53:52	jrobeson	like , i've never played american footbal, but i still know most of the rules
2016-09-26 17:54:07	jrobeson	nor have a sat down and watched a game that wasn't part of a party
2016-09-26 17:55:35	slycurgus	we get things like (last week) who are the top five highest paid sportsplayers in the world
2016-09-26 17:55:46	slycurgus	with the hint of 2 soccer, 2 tennis, one ... some other sport, i forget
2016-09-26 17:56:02	slycurgus	and we're like "uhhhh" *frantic guessing*
2016-09-26 17:56:10	jrobeson	hmm.. tennis could be the williams sisters
2016-09-26 17:56:13	slycurgus	i think we got one of the soccer guys and one of the tennis guys
2016-09-26 17:56:24	jrobeson	oh, but they are ladies, so probably not highly paid :)
2016-09-26 17:56:27	slycurgus	nah i think it was federer and someone
2016-09-26 17:56:29	slycurgus	idk
2016-09-26 17:56:31	jrobeson	yeah
2016-09-26 17:56:41	jrobeson	i don't know my tennis well as i do other sports
2016-09-26 17:56:45	jrobeson	not that i know a lot there either
2016-09-26 17:56:47	slycurgus	it was a week ago so it's like last year for me ;P
2016-09-26 17:57:14	jrobeson	well I couldn't answer a cricket question at all probably
2016-09-26 17:57:31	jrobeson	they do have some cricket in AU right?
2016-09-26 17:57:44	slycurgus	yeah, heaps
2016-09-26 17:57:58	slycurgus	not that i pay attention to it either :P
2016-09-26 17:57:58	jrobeson	it hardly exists in north america 
2016-09-26 17:58:07	jrobeson	i know they got teams in NZ too 
2016-09-26 17:58:09	slycurgus	mm
2016-09-26 17:58:19	slycurgus	yeah, all through the Commonwealth it's popular, i think
2016-09-26 17:58:34	jrobeson	and india.. but not us or canada
2016-09-26 17:58:44	slycurgus	i would honestly be surprised to hear of it in america at all
2016-09-26 17:58:59	jrobeson	lacrosse is more popular
2016-09-26 17:59:10	jrobeson	baseball otehrwise takes up the other aspects of cricket i guess
2016-09-26 17:59:58	jrobeson	how much baseball is there in AU? 
2016-09-26 18:00:04	slycurgus	i don't think i've ever seen or heard of anyone playing lacrosse here
2016-09-26 18:00:12	slycurgus	umm, not a lot, certainly not as much as in the states
2016-09-26 18:00:18	jrobeson	well i know that :)
2016-09-26 18:00:23	slycurgus	maybe some small local teams and stuff
2016-09-26 18:00:33	slycurgus	cricket and football would be the two big games
2016-09-26 18:00:48	slycurgus	my mum likes baseball and she watches the US leagues
2016-09-26 18:00:50	jrobeson	japan has more baseball than AU 
2016-09-26 18:00:58	jrobeson	that's hwo it sounds
2016-09-26 18:00:59	slycurgus	yeah
2016-09-26 18:01:01	slycurgus	definitely
2016-09-26 18:01:07	jrobeson	and lots of latin american countries too
2016-09-26 18:01:17	jrobeson	strangely enough
2016-09-26 18:01:19	slycurgus	mum watches the US ones because i don't think any AU games actually get shown on TV
2016-09-26 18:01:28	slycurgus	if there's even a league
2016-09-26 18:01:31	jrobeson	any basketball?
2016-09-26 18:01:32	slycurgus	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-09-26 18:01:51	jrobeson	i think basketball has the potential to be as popular as soccer is
2016-09-26 18:02:03	slycurgus	there's a couple of teams, yeah
2016-09-26 18:02:06	jrobeson	it's also even cheaper 
2016-09-26 18:02:10	slycurgus	Sydney Kings, from memory?
2016-09-26 18:02:12	slycurgus	or something
2016-09-26 18:02:15	slycurgus	idk
2016-09-26 18:02:15	jrobeson	i mean it's hard to beat how cheap basketball is to play
2016-09-26 18:02:19	slycurgus	mm
2016-09-26 18:02:26	jrobeson	and how few players it requires
2016-09-26 18:02:31	slycurgus	big rectangle, 2 small circles, a sphere, 10 guys
2016-09-26 18:02:33	jrobeson	you can play it by yoruself, you can play it with 2
2016-09-26 18:02:33	slycurgus	done
2016-09-26 18:02:51	jrobeson	you don't even need 10 people. lots of folks play small pickup games all the time
2016-09-26 18:03:09	slycurgus	i meant as a televised sport :P
2016-09-26 18:03:11	jrobeson	you can't play baseball without people on the bases really
2016-09-26 18:03:24	slycurgus	i'm sure there must be a league but i've just never paid attention to it
2016-09-26 18:03:25	jrobeson	but things can more easily become televised because they are so easy to play
2016-09-26 18:03:32	jrobeson	and get popular because

2016-09-26 18:04:04	slycurgus	but really fighting uphill against the more entrenched football and cricket
2016-09-26 18:04:27	jrobeson	end british domination! export australian football back to your motherland!

2016-09-26 18:05:18		[18:05]
2016-09-26 18:05:33	slycurgus	yeah, there's a NZ team in the australian league, even
2016-09-26 18:05:35	slycurgus	the Warriors
2016-09-26 18:05:42	slycurgus	idk which football type it is though
2016-09-26 18:05:55	jrobeson	which football types do you have? i thought there was just one
2016-09-26 18:06:08	jrobeson	i mean.. unless you are talking about soccor now :)
2016-09-26 18:06:20	jrobeson	soccer*
2016-09-26 18:06:20	slycurgus	idk if i'll even get the names right, but there's Rugby League, Rugby Union, and Australian Rules
2016-09-26 18:06:24	jrobeson	ah
2016-09-26 18:06:31	jrobeson	yeah i meant australian rules football
2016-09-26 18:06:32	slycurgus	nah these are still egg-ball ones
2016-09-26 18:06:37	slycurgus	but idk what the differences are etc

2016-09-26 18:06:53	slycurgus	mm
2016-09-26 18:07:08	jrobeson	i think it's mostly at the college level 
2016-09-26 18:07:40	slycurgus	mm
2016-09-26 18:07:52	slycurgus	i think the big leagues of football here are the not-australian ones
2016-09-26 18:07:59	slycurgus	the brits etc play in them as well
2016-09-26 18:09:46	jrobeson	so are you talking about rubgy again?

2016-09-26 18:12:16	jrobeson	i'd like for there to be another sport that's as worldwide as soccer 
2016-09-26 18:12:45	slycurgus	mm
2016-09-26 18:12:48	slycurgus	'the world game'
2016-09-26 18:13:01	jrobeson	heck. it'd be cool enough if the world series was really the world series
2016-09-26 18:13:13	jrobeson	instead of just america and a few canadian teams :)
2016-09-26 18:13:28	slycurgus	baseball world series?
2016-09-26 18:13:32	jrobeson	yes
2016-09-26 18:13:43	jrobeson	like where's america vs japan
2016-09-26 18:13:46	slycurgus	it's amusing that it's even called the 'world' series :P

2016-09-26 21:42:12	jrobeson	[04:13:00] heck. it'd be cool enough if the world series was really the world series [04:13:00]
2016-09-26 21:42:12	jrobeson	[04:13:13] instead of just america and a few canadian teams :) [04:13:13]
2016-09-26 21:42:12	slycurgus	[04:13:27] baseball world series? [04:13:27]
2016-09-26 21:42:12	jrobeson	[04:13:32] yes [04:13:32]
2016-09-26 21:42:12	jrobeson	[04:13:42] like where's america vs japan [04:13:42]
2016-09-26 21:42:12	slycurgus	[04:13:45] it's amusing that it's even called the 'world' series :P [04:13:45]
2016-09-26 21:42:12	jrobeson	[04:13:55] yes it is [04:13:55]

2016-09-26 21:42:12	slycurgus	[04:16:06] m watching a programming stream on Twitch and it keeps crapping out [04:16:06]
2016-09-26 21:42:12	slycurgus	[04:16:09] damn office internet [04:16:09]
2016-09-26 21:42:12	slycurgus	[04:24:58] customer emails our support guy "our licence is abotu to expire, we need a renewal" [04:24:58]
2016-09-26 21:42:12	slycurgus	[04:25:11] support guy emails me "plz renewal thx" [04:25:11]
2016-09-26 21:42:12	slycurgus	[04:25:31] i ask him for the licence holder name, he forwards me what the customer had reported [04:25:31]
2016-09-26 21:42:12	slycurgus	[04:25:59] can't find that holder anywhere i nthe DB, check with a guy who knows the customer better - and he tells me they already solved that renewal and the name was totally different [04:25:59]
2016-09-26 21:42:12	slycurgus	[04:26:11] (well not totally, but pretty different) [04:26:11]

2016-09-26 21:42:12	slycurgus	[04:46:42] heh, on this twitch stream (well, VOD of the recorded stream), in the chat: "chat is too quiet. i think spaces are better than tabs" [04:46:42]

2016-09-26 21:42:12	jrobeson	[05:53:19] tabs are theoretically better, but in practice.. [05:53:19]
2016-09-26 21:42:12	jrobeson	[05:53:28] so i just use 4 spaces except in ruby  [05:53:28]
2016-09-26 21:42:12	jrobeson	[05:53:53] go is like the only camp that's explicitly tabs that i know of [05:53:53]
2016-09-26 21:42:12	slycurgus	[05:59:59] python complained at me the other day when i accidentalyl mixed tabs and spaces [05:59:59]
2016-09-26 21:42:12	slycurgus	[06:00:09] but i guess lots of languages probably don't like that [06:00:09]
2016-09-26 21:42:12	airen	[06:02:17] slycurgus: It does that. [06:02:17]
2016-09-26 21:42:12	airen	[06:02:21] but you can just use tabs [06:02:21]

2016-09-26 21:42:12	airen	[06:02:30] the best part is that it triggers "pythonistas" [06:02:30]
2016-09-26 21:42:12	airen	[06:02:46] they go all warbargarhbal at you because it isn't "pep-8" compliant [06:02:46]

2016-09-27 22:59:36	slycurgus	[04:49:37] hm [04:49:37]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	slycurgus	[04:49:50] this is a reasonably compelling argument [04:49:50]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	slycurgus	[04:50:05] i give it 8/10 compellings [04:50:05]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	airen	[04:50:14] u r8 it 8/8 m8? [04:50:14]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	slycurgus	[04:50:31] no 8/10 uhhh m0? [04:50:31]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	slycurgus	[04:50:47] intention being that 'm0' gets pronounced as 'men' [04:50:47]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	slycurgus	[04:50:50] idk why [04:50:50]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	airen	[04:50:55] lol [04:50:55]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	slycurgus	[04:57:07] i have a crick in my neck.. i think i slept on it funny last night :< [04:57:07]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	jrobeson	[05:53:19] tabs are theoretically better, but in practice.. [05:53:19]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	jrobeson	[05:53:28] so i just use 4 spaces except in ruby  [05:53:28]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	jrobeson	[05:53:53] go is like the only camp that's explicitly tabs that i know of [05:53:53]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	slycurgus	[05:59:59] python complained at me the other day when i accidentalyl mixed tabs and spaces [05:59:59]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	slycurgus	[06:00:09] but i guess lots of languages probably don't like that [06:00:09]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	airen	[06:02:17] slycurgus: It does that. [06:02:17]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	airen	[06:02:21] but you can just use tabs [06:02:21]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	airen	[06:02:23] even in python3 [06:02:23]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	airen	[06:02:30] the best part is that it triggers "pythonistas" [06:02:30]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	airen	[06:02:46] they go all warbargarhbal at you because it isn't "pep-8" compliant [06:02:46]

2016-09-27 22:59:36	slycurgus	[06:08:38] i think i'll stick to spaces though [06:08:38]

2016-09-27 22:59:36	dvdmuckle	[16:50:13] my terminal arrived today :) [16:50:13]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	dvdmuckle	[16:50:30] but of course it's being held captive by the university mail room so i have to wait a couple hours before it become available [16:50:30]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	dvdmuckle	[17:58:02] it would appear freenode is under ddos again [17:58:02]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	+Gr33n3gg	[18:21:01] dvdmuckle: your terminal arrived? [18:21:01]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	dvdmuckle	[18:30:52] Gr33n3gg: it did, but it's being held hostage in the basement of the uni mail room [18:30:52]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	dvdmuckle	[18:31:00] gonna head back in 30 to see if it's up top [18:31:00]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	+Gr33n3gg	[18:31:17] did you buy a physical vt100 terminal or something? [18:31:17]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	dvdmuckle	[18:31:21] yep [18:31:21]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	dvdmuckle	[18:31:24] vt420 [18:31:24]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	+Gr33n3gg	[18:31:27] oooh hell yeah, thats cool af [18:31:27]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	+Gr33n3gg	[18:31:38] neat, take pics when you can [18:31:38]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	dvdmuckle	[18:31:43] better be a vt420-c2, as that's the one i specified [18:31:43]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	dvdmuckle	[18:31:49] the seller had two available [18:31:49]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	dvdmuckle	[18:31:55] c2 is the amber model, other one was green [18:31:55]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	dvdmuckle	[18:32:07] end goal is hooking it up to a pi to give public ssh to people [18:32:07]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	+Gr33n3gg	[18:32:22] oh neat [18:32:22]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	dvdmuckle	[18:35:49] unfortunately, i need to wait a while for all the cables to come in [18:35:49]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	dvdmuckle	[18:36:05] because the thing uses a proprietary jack [18:36:05]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	dvdmuckle	[18:36:25] so basically, i need it to go dec mmj > db9 > gpio/uart [18:36:25]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	dvdmuckle	[18:37:00] i used the gpio for two reasons 1)some usb adapters for db9 have their own buffer, which screws with baud rate and 2) it was way cheaper [18:37:00]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	dvdmuckle	[19:30:35] got the terminal :) [19:30:35]

2016-09-27 22:59:36	slycurgus	[22:27:16] dvdmuckle: noice [22:27:16]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	roadkill	[06:42:30] gotta shut down for the move. should be back online by the 1st. [06:42:30]

2016-09-28 16:48:50	slycurgus	not... exactly my definition of lightweight, but okay
2016-09-28 16:52:11	jrobeson	it requires a lot...
2016-09-28 16:52:22	jrobeson	i mean that means it seems like a bad idea to go too light with something like that
2016-09-28 16:58:00		[16:52]
2016-09-28 17:00:01	slycurgus	yeah
2016-09-28 17:00:41	slycurgus	was just a bit surprised that "lightweight drone control" also appears to have path calculation, simulation, plotting etc capabilities
2016-09-28 17:00:47	slycurgus	all built in to the one thing
2016-09-28 17:01:34	slycurgus	might have made more sense to me to be a core 'drone control' library, and then path simulation etc that require symPy or whatever in addition to the core 'skeleton' library

2016-09-28 17:03:48	slycurgus	i can agree that 'let's control a flying object' is not the sort of thing that you want to throw 50 lines at and call it good, but it struck me as odd to have al lthat bundled in and then call it lightweight
2016-09-28 17:09:00		[17:03]
2016-09-28 17:14:49	jrobeson	isn't path calculation a core part of of it though?

2016-09-28 17:15:08	jrobeson	is building a drone even useful without it?
2016-09-28 17:15:41	jrobeson	it is hard to come up with the right mix of exposed features for a library like that of course.
2016-09-28 17:16:47	jrobeson	theoretically.. splitting everythign up into reusable pieces is better, but then it leads to analysis paralysis or even just things not working well in combination with other things because they weren't tested together
2016-09-28 17:17:06	jrobeson	and in the case of some flying thing, you could actually hurt somebody if somebody switched out component a with b 
2016-09-28 17:17:16	jrobeson	and the library devs never tested it in that combination
2016-09-28 17:17:39	jrobeson	the phrase i'm looking for is combinatorial explosion
2016-09-28 17:19:21	jrobeson	software in general is so very fragile

2016-09-28 18:44:14	slycurgus	plotting and simulations are extra
2016-09-28 18:44:30	slycurgus	and i mean you could probably do a true "lightweight" library that didn't do pathing

2016-09-28 19:52:25	slycurgus	if you need the safety you import the slightly larger one that does pathing
2016-09-28 19:52:38	slycurgus	and then if you need to confirm the paths, or whatever, you bring in the plotting one too
2016-09-28 19:52:48	slycurgus	or maybe because it's 2016 you jsut import the lot and be done with it

2016-09-28 20:04:28	jrobeson	yeah i know denny's is there because anime..

2016-09-28 20:05:33	slycurgus	a super minor one is the "NONO" eraser from Nichijou, the real one is "MONO"
2016-09-28 20:05:36	jrobeson	stylized .. that's a weird one.. because i pronouce it like styleized .. but tha'ts wrong
2016-09-28 20:05:46	slycurgus	i raise this because i happen to have one of those erasers still
2016-09-28 20:05:50	slycurgus	but the paper fell off it
2016-09-28 20:05:58	jrobeson	i mean the spelling is wrong
2016-09-28 20:06:19	slycurgus	of which?
2016-09-28 20:07:33	jrobeson	stylized is the correct spelling in american english dictionaries
2016-09-28 20:08:48	slycurgus	mm..?
2016-09-28 20:09:07	jrobeson	mm..? i'm confused
2016-09-28 20:09:10	slycurgus	and it's stylised in british english... i'm not sure where 'styleized' came in
2016-09-28 20:09:26	jrobeson	because i said it?
2016-09-28 20:09:31	jrobeson	<jrobeson> lots of signs that say "Benny's" but stylized like the Denny's logo
2016-09-28 20:09:58	jrobeson	and then.. i realized i pronounce it as if the e were there.
2016-09-28 20:10:08	jrobeson	style ized
2016-09-28 20:10:20	slycurgus	....how else would you pronounce it?
2016-09-28 20:10:32	slycurgus	i'd pronounce it about the same as 'style ised'
2016-09-28 20:10:51	jrobeson	so again. .english is weird..
2016-09-28 20:11:09	slycurgus	yes

2016-09-29 00:46:14	jrobeson	[06:04:27] yeah i know denny's is there because anime..  [06:04:27]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	jrobeson	[06:04:44] lots of signs that say "Benny's" but stylized like the Denny's logo [06:04:44]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	slycurgus	[06:04:59] heh, yeah [06:04:59]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	slycurgus	[06:05:33] a super minor one is the "NONO" eraser from Nichijou, the real one is "MONO" [06:05:33]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	jrobeson	[06:05:36] stylized .. that's a weird one.. because i pronouce it like styleized .. but tha'ts wrong [06:05:36]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	slycurgus	[06:05:45] i raise this because i happen to have one of those erasers still [06:05:45]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	slycurgus	[06:05:50] but the paper fell off it [06:05:50]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	jrobeson	[06:05:58] i mean the spelling is wrong [06:05:58]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	slycurgus	[06:06:18] of which? [06:06:18]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	jrobeson	[06:07:32] stylized is the correct spelling in american english dictionaries [06:07:32]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	slycurgus	[06:08:48] mm..? [06:08:48]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	jrobeson	[06:09:07] mm..? i'm confused [06:09:07]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	slycurgus	[06:09:10] and it's stylised in british english... i'm not sure where 'styleized' came in [06:09:10]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	jrobeson	[06:09:26] because i said it? [06:09:26]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	jrobeson	[06:09:31] <jrobeson> lots of signs that say "Benny's" but stylized like the Denny's logo [06:09:31]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	jrobeson	[06:09:58] and then.. i realized i pronounce it as if the e were there. [06:09:58]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	jrobeson	[06:10:07] style ized [06:10:07]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	slycurgus	[06:10:20] ....how else would you pronounce it? [06:10:20]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	slycurgus	[06:10:32] i'd pronounce it about the same as 'style ised' [06:10:32]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	jrobeson	[06:10:51] so again. .english is weird.. [06:10:51]

2016-09-29 12:45:19	slycurgus	i made a dangerous piece of electrical equipment yesterday
2016-09-29 12:45:42	slycurgus	making a ghetto lamp, but haven't got the holes drilled in the base to mount the bulb holder yet
2016-09-29 12:45:54	slycurgus	so i jsut went ahead and put the wall plug on the end of the cable
2016-09-29 12:46:10	slycurgus	leaving me with something that i can plug into a wall, and have 240V at the other end of

2016-09-29 13:09:50	slycurgus	also, looks like i might have chosen poorly on the mcu for my clock project too (what a surprise)
2016-09-29 13:10:13	slycurgus	the chip i got was like $1, but for $4 i could get an atmel one that's vastly better-supported
2016-09-29 13:10:16	slycurgus	jrobeson was right 
2016-09-29 13:13:18	dhscholb	you building a clock briefcase to bring to school?

2016-09-29 13:14:35	slycurgus	i mean i guess i could just take it to *a* school
2016-09-29 13:14:46	dhscholb	and be evasive about why you brought it
2016-09-29 13:14:47	slycurgus	like an impromptu science fair
2016-09-29 13:14:58	dhscholb	especially when the police get involved
2016-09-29 13:15:01	slycurgus	i'll just set it up in the middle of the schoolyard and leave it for the kids to investigate
2016-09-29 13:15:09	dhscholb	good plan
2016-09-29 13:15:09	slycurgus	maybe a sign that says "look inside!"
2016-09-29 13:15:23	slycurgus	i should make it tick nice and loud so people will at least have a hint of what's in there

2016-09-29 13:18:03	slycurgus	i'm making a digital clock that just does kiloseconds

2016-09-29 13:18:12	slycurgus	repeat
2016-09-29 13:18:43	slycurgus	when i was looking for MCUs i decided that since the number i needed to count to (86400) exceeded 16-bit space, i'd need a 32-bit chip
2016-09-29 13:19:01	slycurgus	which was apparently entirely unnecessary, and meant i got a fairly niche processor
2016-09-29 13:19:23	slycurgus	as opposed to the common-as-dirt (but still more expensive? whatever) atmel chips
2016-09-29 13:20:06	slycurgus	on the plus side it means my investment in the MCU side of things is like $3 so far so i'm pretty happy to just get a different one instead
2016-09-29 13:20:31	slycurgus	(i did the same thing with the GPS module, and narrowly avoided doing the same with the LED driver)
2016-09-29 13:20:45	slycurgus	((and those are the only three IC components))

2016-09-29 13:22:19	dhscholb	i've been toying with the idea of making a homebrew brainfuck-based computer architecture
2016-09-29 13:23:09	slycurgus	o__o that sounds.... fun
2016-09-29 13:23:15	slycurgus	although
2016-09-29 13:23:25	slycurgus	how would you base an architecture on brainfuck?
2016-09-29 13:23:31	slycurgus	isn't it a higher-level language?
2016-09-29 13:23:46	slycurgus	like, it doesn't have any concept of instructions etc, it just compiles to them

2016-09-29 13:24:10	dhscholb	basically, the "machine instructions" would correspond 1-to-1 with brainfuck operations
2016-09-29 13:24:19	slycurgus	ah ok
2016-09-29 13:24:27	dhscholb	so a brainfuck program would run natively

2016-09-29 17:21:34	slycurgus	jrobeson: your advice to go with an AVR atmel chip looks like it might have been pretty good
2016-09-29 17:21:34		[17:21]
2016-09-29 17:22:17	slycurgus	i still haven't really worked out what ancillary components (caps, resistors) i would need for the chip i have... but i tihnk getting those details for the atmels will be simpler
2016-09-29 17:22:39	slycurgus	dvdmuckle: sounds like you're making progress though :D
2016-09-29 17:23:34	dvdmuckle	slycurgus: i am. at the very least the terminal is currently sitting next to a pc with a serial port (backup server for the cs department. imo something i want to upgrade) so at the very least i can test the terminal with screen
2016-09-29 17:24:04	dvdmuckle	of course, if i had gone with usb, i would know for a fact whether or not the terminal was working because dmesg would report ttyUSB0 as a device handle
2016-09-29 17:24:14	slycurgus	mm
2016-09-29 17:24:17	slycurgus	hindsight!
2016-09-29 17:24:19	dvdmuckle	whereas now ttyS0 already exists as a device handle, it's just basically a null pointer
2016-09-29 17:24:21	dvdmuckle	yeah, kinda
2016-09-29 17:24:35	dvdmuckle	the reason i didn't go with usb is (apparently) some adapters have their own buffer
2016-09-29 17:24:43	dvdmuckle	which fucks with the baud rate of the terminal and host
2016-09-29 17:25:23	dvdmuckle	and you can end up with corrupted characters on large updates (like ls in a dir with lots of subdirs)
2016-09-29 17:25:54	dvdmuckle	but, once this is all done, i'm gonna throw it at someone that uses tmux and vim on the daily, as a sort of stress test

2016-09-29 19:01:39	slycurgus	i just wasn't sure if an ATTiny for instance would have the things i need
2016-09-29 19:01:51	jrobeson	do you know what you need ? :)
2016-09-29 19:02:06	slycurgus	but i think all i need is something that can talk SPI (one device), USART (one device), and... i think that's it
2016-09-29 19:02:20	slycurgus	it needs to read USART from the GPS, and speak SPI to the LED driver
2016-09-29 19:02:59	slycurgus	oh, and do a bit of calculation to turn the USART string data into a group of numbers to say via SPI
2016-09-29 19:03:57	jrobeson	a quick google suggests the atmega328p (what's in an uno r3) has one
2016-09-29 19:04:00	jrobeson	usart i mean
2016-09-29 19:05:00	slycurgus	looks like i could get away with an atmega168, even
2016-09-29 19:05:09	slycurgus	atmega168pb
2016-09-29 19:05:28	slycurgus	or heck the 328 probably comes in a smaller package
2016-09-29 19:05:39	slycurgus	my Uno has the mega in a DIL

2016-09-29 19:06:57	slycurgus	but yeah i think using an atmel chip will vastly help.. i'll look at some options and decide
2016-09-29 19:07:03	jrobeson	be careful with the usage of mega when talking about such things as there is a thing called an arduino mega
2016-09-29 19:07:07	slycurgus	would clock frequency come into it?
2016-09-29 19:07:17	slycurgus	mm i meant atmega
2016-09-29 19:07:25	jrobeson	clock frequency come into what
2016-09-29 19:07:33	jrobeson	how's the chip speed compared to what you got?
2016-09-29 19:07:41	slycurgus	like, the one i have at the moment is a 48MHz, and these are around 20MHz
2016-09-29 19:07:52	slycurgus	would that somehow stop me being able to talk to something?
2016-09-29 19:08:05	slycurgus	not sure what frequencies SPI and USART normally happen at
2016-09-29 19:08:09	jrobeson	it could sure, if your device can't talk fast enough
2016-09-29 19:08:25	jrobeson	well arduino supports at least 115200 baud rate
2016-09-29 19:08:44	jrobeson	i mean an uno (based on the 328p)
2016-09-29 19:09:04	slycurgus	mm, i'll have a look at the spec for my GPS and LED i guess
2016-09-29 19:09:20	jrobeson	or just look them up in combination with arduino
2016-09-29 19:09:20	slycurgus	i seem to recall the LED driver wanting 26MHz but maybe i'm misremembering 26kHz
2016-09-29 19:09:35	slycurgus	because 26M sounds pretty high for a communication frequency
2016-09-29 19:09:37	jrobeson	you'll get a ton of answers that way

2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[03:27:19] heh [03:27:19]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[03:27:58] time for yet another meeting [03:27:58]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[03:28:03] turning out to be a productive fridya [03:28:03]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[03:28:09] at least i got a long lunch :3 [03:28:09]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	dvdmuckle	[03:28:48] ah, right, australia [03:28:48]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	jrobeson	[04:21:43] there are folks who describe how to build an arduino from an atmel chip, so you can follow those [04:21:43]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	jrobeson	[04:22:03] since you can basically crib off that [04:22:03]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	jrobeson	[04:28:16] slycurgus, also at any time (with the right pieces), you can just pop an arduino bootloader on there  [04:28:16]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	jrobeson	[04:28:32] also, you can scrutinize the arduino codebase too [04:28:32]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	jrobeson	[04:28:43] if you ever get confused on how something would work in practice [04:28:43]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[05:01:20] jrobeson: oo, those are all good points in its favour [05:01:20]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[05:01:38] i just wasn't sure if an ATTiny for instance would have the things i need [05:01:38]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	jrobeson	[05:01:50] do you know what you need ? :) [05:01:50]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[05:02:05] but i think all i need is something that can talk SPI (one device), USART (one device), and... i think that's it [05:02:05]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[05:02:19] it needs to read USART from the GPS, and speak SPI to the LED driver [05:02:19]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[05:02:58] oh, and do a bit of calculation to turn the USART string data into a group of numbers to say via SPI [05:02:58]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	jrobeson	[05:03:56] a quick google suggests the atmega328p (what's in an uno r3) has one [05:03:56]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	jrobeson	[05:03:59] usart i mean [05:03:59]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[05:04:59] looks like i could get away with an atmega168, even [05:04:59]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[05:05:08] atmega168pb [05:05:08]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[05:05:27] or heck the 328 probably comes in a smaller package [05:05:27]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[05:05:38] my Uno has the mega in a DIL [05:05:38]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[05:05:42] which is giant :V [05:05:42]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[05:06:56] but yeah i think using an atmel chip will vastly help.. i'll look at some options and decide [05:06:56]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	jrobeson	[05:07:02] be careful with the usage of mega when talking about such things as there is a thing called an arduino mega [05:07:02]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[05:07:06] would clock frequency come into it? [05:07:06]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[05:07:16] mm i meant atmega [05:07:16]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	jrobeson	[05:07:24] clock frequency come into what [05:07:24]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	jrobeson	[05:07:32] how's the chip speed compared to what you got? [05:07:32]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[05:07:41] like, the one i have at the moment is a 48MHz, and these are around 20MHz [05:07:41]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[05:07:51] would that somehow stop me being able to talk to something? [05:07:51]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[05:08:04] not sure what frequencies SPI and USART normally happen at [05:08:04]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	jrobeson	[05:08:08] it could sure, if your device can't talk fast enough [05:08:08]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	jrobeson	[05:08:24] well arduino supports at least 115200 baud rate [05:08:24]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	jrobeson	[05:08:43] i mean an uno (based on the 328p) [05:08:43]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[05:09:03] mm, i'll have a look at the spec for my GPS and LED i guess [05:09:03]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	jrobeson	[05:09:19] or just look them up in combination with arduino [05:09:19]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[05:09:19] i seem to recall the LED driver wanting 26MHz but maybe i'm misremembering 26kHz [05:09:19]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[05:09:34] because 26M sounds pretty high for a communication frequency [05:09:34]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	jrobeson	[05:09:36] you'll get a ton of answers that way [05:09:36]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	slycurgus	[05:09:48] cool cool [05:09:48]

2016-09-30 22:50:35	slycurgus	:3
2016-09-30 22:50:37	 *	slycurgus thrifty
2016-09-30 22:50:48	slycurgus	total cost for each of these is about $15 tops
2016-09-30 22:50:59	slycurgus	as opposed to $35 each for a fancy actual lamp
2016-09-30 22:51:19	slycurgus	(i say fancy but i mean 'cheapest workable one for this purpose that i could find')

2016-09-30 23:33:55	slycurgus	that when shaken just gives you a japanese emoji, like (>°ω°<) etc
2016-09-30 23:34:33	 *	slycurgus too many ideas on the go
2016-09-30 23:39:12	jrobeson	fun
2016-09-30 23:39:24	jrobeson	what's gonna be the output?
2016-09-30 23:39:33	jrobeson	what display i mean
2016-09-30 23:44:58	slycurgus	https://www.adafruit.com/products/326 was the plan
2016-09-30 23:47:26	slycurgus	thinking i'll have to do the emojis as bitmaps because it seems unlikely that it'll handle unicode very well :V

2016-10-01 00:08:22	jrobeson	cute
2016-10-01 00:10:10	slycurgus	and you'll be pleased to hear that i was just gonna buy an arduino and an accelerometer module
2016-10-01 00:10:21	slycurgus	instead of an MCU and an accelerometer *chip* :P
2016-10-01 00:14:53	jrobeson	well you could build your own with a shield
2016-10-01 00:15:07	-->	jemadux (~jemadux@unaffiliated/jemadux) has joined #r/linux
2016-10-01 00:15:33	jrobeson	there are tons of protoshield things.. i got a pack of 3 for $11 USD.. and that was from amazon
2016-10-01 00:15:57	jrobeson	even had a space for an SMD IC
2016-10-01 00:16:06	slycurgus	i'm happy enough just chaining a couple of modules together
2016-10-01 00:16:20	slycurgus	not necessarily building it from scratch
2016-10-01 00:16:41	slycurgus	....i might even swap the MCU of my current project out for an arduino, really
2016-10-01 00:17:03	slycurgus	part of my aim to DIY the whole thing was to keep it on one board for "cleanliness"
2016-10-01 00:17:12	slycurgus	but now my GPS module is gonna be a daughterboard
2016-10-01 00:17:25	slycurgus	and i was thinking i'll probably put it in a housing
2016-10-01 00:17:36	slycurgus	so it doesn't really matter how big it is
2016-10-01 00:17:54	slycurgus	i liked the idea of just a single small board with power in the back and digits out the front
2016-10-01 00:18:21	slycurgus	but having it in a housing makes more sense, and means that the "let's DIY it to be as small as possible!" is no longer a great motivation
2016-10-01 00:18:21		[00:18]
2016-10-01 00:19:03	jrobeson	the nice thing about having some arduinos around is that you can prototype it and then do a real board if you ever want
2016-10-01 00:19:11	slycurgus	mm
2016-10-01 00:19:27	slycurgus	that's what i have ended up using my Uno for, for the clock project
2016-10-01 00:19:27	jrobeson	like, there are places that even take orders for oen board 
2016-10-01 00:19:35	slycurgus	oen?
2016-10-01 00:19:39	slycurgus	oh
2016-10-01 00:19:40	slycurgus	one
2016-10-01 00:19:45	jrobeson	yeah one
2016-10-01 00:19:48	 *	slycurgus can understand words in contexts
2016-10-01 00:19:58	jrobeson	even including assembly..
2016-10-01 00:20:01	jrobeson	not sure of the pricing though
2016-10-01 00:20:03	slycurgus	i thought it was gonna be something like "oem"
2016-10-01 00:20:12	jrobeson	seeedstduio does it, and and so does this microfab
2016-10-01 00:20:12	slycurgus	and i was like "what's the N??"
2016-10-01 00:20:21	slycurgus	mm, i got my last ones done by OSH Park
2016-10-01 00:20:23	slycurgus	liked them
2016-10-01 00:20:30	slycurgus	brb oven
2016-10-01 00:20:32	jrobeson	what did you build it in ?
2016-10-01 00:21:23	jrobeson	ah, they only do pcbs.. i was interested in somebody who also does assembly
2016-10-01 00:21:29	jrobeson	and can source the parts too
2016-10-01 00:22:00	slycurgus	yeah, just the board at OSHPark
2016-10-01 00:22:29	slycurgus	this was the shameful "everything in decade counters" version of the project
2016-10-01 00:22:35	slycurgus	14 DIL16s
2016-10-01 00:22:37	slycurgus	it was gross
2016-10-01 00:23:24	slycurgus	and i did the connections a little wrong anyway so it didn't work right
2016-10-01 00:23:46	slycurgus	would have cost a crazy amount to have it assembled as well as just printed
2016-10-01 00:24:09	jrobeson	a crazy amount? 
2016-10-01 00:24:57	slycurgus	the board was literally at physical capacity of DILs and 7-segment modules, with a couple of switches, and a crystal etc
2016-10-01 00:25:07	slycurgus	compared to just getting the board printed, yes
2016-10-01 00:25:15	slycurgus	crazy amount
2016-10-01 00:25:15	slycurgus	:P
2016-10-01 00:25:47	slycurgus	the board was not much smaller than the max footprint that freeware Eagle allowed, to give you an idea
2016-10-01 00:26:12	slycurgus	or idk about "not much", but i remember trying to make it larger at one point and Eagle told me no
2016-10-01 00:27:30	jrobeson	https://factory.macrofab.com/pcb/mgg5t1  take a look to see if you think that is crazy 
2016-10-01 00:27:55	jrobeson	doesn't eagle limit the board size when you don't pay?
2016-10-01 00:28:25	slycurgus	yes
2016-10-01 00:28:38	slycurgus	and my board was sort of close to that limit
2016-10-01 00:29:06	slycurgus	like.. 3 by 6 inches, at a guesstimate
2016-10-01 00:30:48	jrobeson	so how crazy do you think those prices are? seems like a decent deal to my untrained eye. i'm sure the parts could probably be gotten cheaper.
2016-10-01 00:31:08	jrobeson	the labor cost is very low imo
2016-10-01 00:31:22	slycurgus	well, that price ($44 USD) is how much i paid for 3 copies of my bare board from OSHPark
2016-10-01 00:31:32	slycurgus	3 being the minimum quantity - if you want one, they give you 3
2016-10-01 00:32:03	slycurgus	so i can only assume that getting dozens of dollars worth of components on it as well would have been pricey
2016-10-01 00:32:23	slycurgus	i mean i paid retail for my chips and LEDs etc but still
2016-10-01 00:32:32	jrobeson	hmm? i don't get what you're saying
2016-10-01 00:32:43	jrobeson	so you paid $44 for the pcbs only? 
2016-10-01 00:32:43	slycurgus	also, i guess if i'm comparing "bare board" to "full build" it is of course going to be more
2016-10-01 00:32:46	slycurgus	yeah
2016-10-01 00:32:55	slycurgus	around that much
2016-10-01 00:32:56	jrobeson	well that included shipping?
2016-10-01 00:33:03	slycurgus	....don't recall
2016-10-01 00:33:05	slycurgus	but it may have
2016-10-01 00:33:19	slycurgus	or rather, they shipped for free as part of the deal
2016-10-01 00:33:19	jrobeson	if it did, then it'd be hard to compare.. if it didn't, then this is a pretty good deal
2016-10-01 00:33:22	jrobeson	ah
2016-10-01 00:33:22		[00:33]
2016-10-01 00:33:23	slycurgus	mm
2016-10-01 00:34:40	jrobeson	they have it setup so that house parts don't charge for "labor", but you can use anythign from digikey or mouser, and that does include labor
2016-10-01 00:34:44	jrobeson	i think that's a really neat service there
2016-10-01 00:34:57	slycurgus	mm
2016-10-01 00:35:39	jrobeson	so it'd be easy to do something small for your first run, and then migrate to somewhere else as needed
2016-10-01 00:36:10	jrobeson	i know i wouldn't wanna solder say 20 boards by hand 
2016-10-01 00:36:14	slycurgus	yeah
2016-10-01 00:36:20	slycurgus	in my case i'm doing singles anyway
2016-10-01 00:36:27	slycurgus	like, i'm making a clock for me, not for production
2016-10-01 00:36:28	slycurgus	etc
2016-10-01 00:36:38	jrobeson	i haven't yet found a project that I care about enough on a personal level to just build something for me
2016-10-01 00:36:40	slycurgus	but maybe that'll change in future
2016-10-01 00:36:47	jrobeson	you're such a nerd slycurgus 
2016-10-01 00:36:53	slycurgus	heh i know
2016-10-01 00:37:08	slycurgus	i like making stuff and fiddling and building
2016-10-01 00:37:11	jrobeson	uggh.. i want my esp32
2016-10-01 00:37:35	jrobeson	actually i would prefer something arm based.. but it is going ot be impossible to beat the prices of all this esp32 based stuff
2016-10-01 00:38:14	jrobeson	i know i'll likely never use an arduino again.. even for small projects
2016-10-01 00:38:50	jrobeson	i did get an esp8266 based board ( the adafruit feather huzzah) so i can play with micropython
2016-10-01 00:39:15	jrobeson	i've always wanted a repl for a microcontroller!
2016-10-01 00:39:16	slycurgus	why never use an arduino?
2016-10-01 00:39:29	jrobeson	because I don't care about going as samll as possible 
2016-10-01 00:39:37	jrobeson	liek you care about say .. not using an 32bit chip 
2016-10-01 00:39:51	jrobeson	you wanna use that 8bit thing because you don't need the extra power
2016-10-01 00:39:59	slycurgus	mm, well i don't necessarily care abotu the bitness of the chip
2016-10-01 00:40:09	jrobeson	well you denied using the 32bit one :)
2016-10-01 00:40:13	jrobeson	i mean the original one
2016-10-01 00:40:26	jrobeson	i remember you saying you were looking into some arm 32bit thing
2016-10-01 00:40:29	slycurgus	my main concern is that i picked an unnecessarily large chip and i think that wound me way out of the well-documented area of things
2016-10-01 00:40:45	slycurgus	like, everyone's using the ATMEL 8bits, and here's me with a Cortex that i have no idea how to use
2016-10-01 00:40:56	jrobeson	it was a cortex m0?
2016-10-01 00:41:04	slycurgus	yep
2016-10-01 00:41:09	jrobeson	you never ever said that :(
2016-10-01 00:41:17	slycurgus	didn't i?
2016-10-01 00:41:19	jrobeson	no
2016-10-01 00:41:25	slycurgus	i think i mentioned it waaaay back
2016-10-01 00:41:30	slycurgus	like, months ago when i bought it
2016-10-01 00:41:32	slycurgus	maybe not
2016-10-01 00:42:06	jrobeson	you said something that got me really confused. it sounded likt it was undocumented.. and overpowered
2016-10-01 00:42:23	jrobeson	yeah not just 32bit vs8.. but just the general beefiness
2016-10-01 00:42:48	jrobeson	not that i could have helped you directly with the cortex m0, but i could have pointed you places.. the chips i have are m0
2016-10-01 00:42:50	slycurgus	heh, i dunno about undocumented - there's a datasheet - but definitely nothing like the arduino etc ecosystem where there's code examples galore
2016-10-01 00:43:15	jrobeson	that's so true.. for cortex m0..all the good common stuff is with the mbed platform
2016-10-01 00:43:22	slycurgus	and yeah clock sppeed up to 48MHz which is probably unnecessary for my system
2016-10-01 00:43:26	slycurgus	that sort of thing
2016-10-01 00:43:35	jrobeson	it's certainly not as widespread as the arduino of course, but i did build stuff with it
2016-10-01 00:43:47	jrobeson	i would have pointed you at mbed
2016-10-01 00:44:06	slycurgus	mm
2016-10-01 00:44:07	jrobeson	then again, you probably didn't have cmsis-dap and stuff
2016-10-01 00:44:17	slycurgus	....have what now? >_>
2016-10-01 00:44:26	jrobeson	ah, not worth explaining
2016-10-01 00:44:30	slycurgus	heh k
2016-10-01 00:44:42	jrobeson	anyways.. the mbed stuff had it such that when you plugged it into a usb port, it showed up as a flash drive!
2016-10-01 00:44:47	jrobeson	i mean like a drive in general
2016-10-01 00:45:01	jrobeson	so you could just cp your code there and it would flash it
2016-10-01 00:45:08	slycurgus	i could probably still go for mbed
2016-10-01 00:45:09	jrobeson	no serial flashing
2016-10-01 00:45:22	jrobeson	although that of course was still possible
2016-10-01 00:45:26	jrobeson	there were different firmwares
2016-10-01 00:45:31	slycurgus	i haven't invested much beyond time in the current chips
2016-10-01 00:45:52	slycurgus	the GPS unit i've got en route will work with mbed
2016-10-01 00:45:55	jrobeson	but really it's hard to generalize when it comes to arm, since they are just licensed designs
2016-10-01 00:46:06	slycurgus	and i could just swap in a different LED driver
2016-10-01 00:46:12	slycurgus	and that would be that
2016-10-01 00:46:25	slycurgus	anyway, time for dinner, away for a little bit
2016-10-01 00:46:43	jrobeson	i know a bit about those cortex m0s for sure
2016-10-01 00:46:53	jrobeson	but not everything though
2016-10-01 00:50:02	jrobeson	oh.. i'm an idiot! i should mention that many cortex m0 based boards have arduino framework compatbility
2016-10-01 00:50:02		[00:50]
2016-10-01 00:50:21	jrobeson	for example, the nrf51288 bluetooth thingy i have  has a cortex m0 and an arduino port
2016-10-01 00:50:33	jrobeson	plus, there are other arduino ports for other cortex m0 chips
2016-10-01 00:50:44	jrobeson	so, it's possible that there is an arduino port for yours
2016-10-01 00:51:38	jrobeson	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Arduino_boards_and_compatible_systems 
2016-10-01 00:52:26	jrobeson	although there are cases where the some libraries use atmel specific cpu registers.. it must not be widespread anymore as there are so many ports now
2016-10-01 00:52:49	jrobeson	i don't have experience with that though, as i used mbed instead of that board's arduino port

2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[10:43:35] it's certainly not as widespread as the arduino of course, but i did build stuff with it [10:43:35]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[10:43:47] i would have pointed you at mbed [10:43:47]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	slycurgus	[10:44:05] mm [10:44:05]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[10:44:06] then again, you probably didn't have cmsis-dap and stuff [10:44:06]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	slycurgus	[10:44:17] ....have what now? >_> [10:44:17]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[10:44:25] ah, not worth explaining [10:44:25]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	slycurgus	[10:44:30] heh k [10:44:30]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[10:44:42] anyways.. the mbed stuff had it such that when you plugged it into a usb port, it showed up as a flash drive! [10:44:42]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[10:44:47] i mean like a drive in general [10:44:47]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[10:45:01] so you could just cp your code there and it would flash it [10:45:01]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	slycurgus	[10:45:07] i could probably still go for mbed [10:45:07]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[10:45:09] no serial flashing [10:45:09]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[10:45:21] although that of course was still possible [10:45:21]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[10:45:26] there were different firmwares [10:45:26]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	slycurgus	[10:45:31] i haven't invested much beyond time in the current chips [10:45:31]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	slycurgus	[10:45:52] the GPS unit i've got en route will work with mbed [10:45:52]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[10:45:54] but really it's hard to generalize when it comes to arm, since they are just licensed designs [10:45:54]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	slycurgus	[10:46:06] and i could just swap in a different LED driver [10:46:06]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	slycurgus	[10:46:12] and that would be that [10:46:12]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	slycurgus	[10:46:25] anyway, time for dinner, away for a little bit [10:46:25]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[10:46:43] i know a bit about those cortex m0s for sure [10:46:43]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[10:46:52] but not everything though [10:46:52]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[10:50:02] oh.. i'm an idiot! i should mention that many cortex m0 based boards have arduino framework compatbility [10:50:02]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[10:50:21] for example, the nrf51288 bluetooth thingy i have  has a cortex m0 and an arduino port [10:50:21]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[10:50:33] plus, there are other arduino ports for other cortex m0 chips [10:50:33]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[10:50:44] so, it's possible that there is an arduino port for yours [10:50:44]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[10:51:38] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Arduino_boards_and_compatible_systems [10:51:38]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[10:52:26] although there are cases where the some libraries use atmel specific cpu registers.. it must not be widespread anymore as there are so many ports now [10:52:26]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[10:52:49] i don't have experience with that though, as i used mbed instead of that board's arduino port [10:52:49]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	slycurgus	[11:24:12] those are all *boards*, heh [11:24:12]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	slycurgus	[11:24:27] i'd still need to build mine into that [11:24:27]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	slycurgus	[11:24:43] capacitors as close as possible to certain pins of the chip, etc [11:24:43]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	slycurgus	[11:25:04] pretty sure it will just be easier to get an mbed thing and be done with it >_> [11:25:04]
2016-10-01 14:06:35	jrobeson	[11:28:14] i'm so excited about playing with micropython [11:28:14]

2016-10-02 15:33:41	jrobeson	could be a kernel issue sure..
2016-10-02 15:33:49	jrobeson	depends on what you mean by going beserk..
2016-10-02 15:34:19	xereeto	well it creates a lot of crazy startup messages, but only when I boot into Arch after having booted into windows
2016-10-02 15:34:30	xereeto	if I just reboot arch I get no messages
2016-10-02 15:34:44	roadkill	ugh. wish I could decide whether or not to pull the trigger on this laptop. 
2016-10-02 15:34:46	xereeto	and, devices connected to it don't work unless I unplug them and then plug them back in
2016-10-02 15:35:20	xereeto	roadkill: specs?
2016-10-02 15:35:36	xereeto	or just a product link
2016-10-02 15:35:36	roadkill	xereeto: Razer Blade Stealth.

2016-10-02 15:35:56	roadkill	grrr.
2016-10-02 15:36:00	roadkill	http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-systems/razer-blade-stealth
2016-10-02 15:36:09	xereeto	it looks sexy
2016-10-02 15:36:17	roadkill	Pro to getting it: I no longer need windows on my desktop.
2016-10-02 15:36:32	xereeto	why do you currently need windows on your desktop?
2016-10-02 15:36:35	roadkill	Adobe.
2016-10-02 15:36:52	roadkill	Premiere, After Effects, Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.
2016-10-02 15:37:19	xereeto	ah right
2016-10-02 15:37:31	xereeto	you'd feel comfortable doing those things on a laptop?
2016-10-02 15:37:38	xereeto	cause I know I wouldn't lol
2016-10-02 15:37:52	roadkill	meh. it's mostly GPU offloaded stuff I do
2016-10-02 15:38:01	roadkill	and mech keyboard+mouse is fine
2016-10-02 15:38:39	xereeto	well the display is fuckin awesome for doing creative stuff
2016-10-02 15:39:18	xereeto	8gb ram is great for a laptop
2016-10-02 15:40:07	xereeto	cpu is decent but it's only dual core? that might hurt your render times
2016-10-02 15:41:27	roadkill	nah. GPU offloaded.
2016-10-02 15:41:33	roadkill	The 256GB model has 16GB ram
2016-10-02 15:41:39	roadkill	only thr 128GB model has 8GB ram
2016-10-02 15:41:58	roadkill	the Core addon would allow me to connect a GTX 580 to the laptop and use it as the GPU
2016-10-02 15:42:09	roadkill	and the 580 is explicitly supported by adobe for CUDA rendering
2016-10-02 15:42:21	<--	Lyqyd (~quassel@174-25-88-191.ptld.qwest.net) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2016-10-02 15:42:35	roadkill	can't do rendering on my desktop using the GPU now because I put a GTX 970 in iy
2016-10-02 15:42:39	roadkill	it
2016-10-02 15:42:51	xereeto	wait a second how the fuck do you put a gtx 580 into a laptop
2016-10-02 15:43:10	roadkill	Look at the page.
2016-10-02 15:43:10		[15:43]
2016-10-02 15:43:10	xereeto	I didn't know you could connect an external gpu
2016-10-02 15:43:21	roadkill	The Thunderbolt™ 3 technology in the Razer Blade Stealth brings Thunderbolt to USB-C at speeds up to 40 Gbps, creating one compact port that does it all. With the ability to connect to USB, Display Port, PCI Express, and Thunderbolt devices it is the most versatile connection available. A single cable now provides four times the data and twice the video bandwidth of any other cable, all while also supplying power to the notebook. Whether you’re gaming 
2016-10-02 15:43:43	xereeto	that is insanely awesome
2016-10-02 15:44:02	roadkill	so yeah, upgadeable GPU using the dock
2016-10-02 15:45:15	roadkill	NOW you see why I'd use it for Adobe? :)
2016-10-02 15:45:36	xereeto	for sure
2016-10-02 15:45:41	xereeto	how much extra is the dock
2016-10-02 15:45:50	roadkill	$399 if you buy the laptop. 
2016-10-02 15:46:03	roadkill	Dock is also a 4xUSB 3.1 hub and power supply for the laptop
2016-10-02 15:46:16	roadkill	http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-core
2016-10-02 15:46:32	roadkill	er 3.0 but close enough
2016-10-02 15:46:35	xereeto	fuck it yolo
2016-10-02 15:46:36	roadkill	Ethernet
2016-10-02 15:46:47	roadkill	it's just so pricey
2016-10-02 15:46:48	xereeto	wait, 3.0? that's like half as good as 3.1
2016-10-02 15:47:01	roadkill	meh. drives still don't max out 3.0
2016-10-02 15:47:28	jrobeson	howdy roadkill , wb
2016-10-02 15:47:43	roadkill	I hate talking about this too because it feels like a humblebrag
2016-10-02 15:47:51	roadkill	hey jrobeson 
2016-10-02 15:48:00	jrobeson	talking about what?
2016-10-02 15:48:13	jrobeson	buying an expensive laptop?
2016-10-02 15:48:16	roadkill	whether or not I should pull the trigger on a (expensive) laptop
2016-10-02 15:48:25	xereeto	it's hardly a humblebrag when you don't own the damn thing yet :P
2016-10-02 15:48:29	xereeto	go for it, treat yourself
2016-10-02 15:48:29	roadkill	heh
2016-10-02 15:48:48	roadkill	The thought of having a portable device cost more than my desktop just irks me
2016-10-02 15:48:51	jrobeson	i trust you not to buy something OP for your needs
2016-10-02 15:49:07	jrobeson	i'm still waiting for something that probably will never exist
2016-10-02 15:49:21	roadkill	jrobeson: well. it supports desktop GPUs with a dock and it would allow me to nuke Windows off my desktop.
2016-10-02 15:49:21	jrobeson	something with external graphics but is in itself very light
2016-10-02 15:49:37	jrobeson	like a dell xps13 or thinkpad xp260 
2016-10-02 15:49:40	jrobeson	err x260
2016-10-02 15:49:46	roadkill	or a Razer Blade Stealth. ;)
2016-10-02 15:49:52	jrobeson	that shit is too gamery for me
2016-10-02 15:50:08	roadkill	eh. you don't have to use the RGB.
2016-10-02 15:50:28	roadkill	it's the insane display I like.
2016-10-02 15:50:45	jrobeson	it actually looks decent minus the bakc logo
2016-10-02 15:51:05	jrobeson	i thought it was gonna be over the top, but it's actually not
2016-10-02 15:51:06	roadkill	(DBrand or Slickwrap to over it. ;)
2016-10-02 15:51:14	jrobeson	how heavy is it
2016-10-02 15:51:18	jrobeson	minus dock
2016-10-02 15:51:25	roadkill	2.8lbs IIRC
2016-10-02 15:51:41	jrobeson	nice
2016-10-02 15:51:47	roadkill	insanely light
2016-10-02 15:51:57	jrobeson	so what's the battery life like?
2016-10-02 15:52:02	roadkill	9 hrs max
2016-10-02 15:52:22	jrobeson	i don't mean spec, i mean like real 
2016-10-02 15:52:26	jrobeson	it doesn't use the mobile processors does it
2016-10-02 15:52:31	roadkill	you know how mac fanboys were always like "there's no laptop that beats a macbook on ALL fronts"? This one does.
2016-10-02 15:52:43	jrobeson	does it? on battery life?
2016-10-02 15:53:07	roadkill	pretty much. yeah. it's considered one of the best workstation laptops when you look past the gamer angle
2016-10-02 15:53:09	jrobeson	and.. from what i've heard, it's hard to beet the trackpad
2016-10-02 15:53:41	jrobeson	i still want a mobile processor instead though
2016-10-02 15:53:42	roadkill	I actually hate the MacBook trackpad, but that's me
2016-10-02 15:54:09	jrobeson	high cpu is so irrelevant compared to ssd, moar ram, and good graphics cards
2016-10-02 15:54:36	jrobeson	for me i mean, the occasional gamer
2016-10-02 15:54:59	roadkill	true
2016-10-02 15:54:59	roadkill	the i7, even mobile, is decent
2016-10-02 15:55:03	roadkill	friend has one in the HP Envy 13 laptop and it doesn't lag
2016-10-02 15:55:25	<--	golevka (~golevka@pool-72-73-238-46.cmdnnj.fios.verizon.net) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-10-02 15:56:13	jrobeson	so what do you do with that adobe stuff? what do you make?
2016-10-02 15:56:15	roadkill	i cannot tell you how much I hate having windows on this desktop
2016-10-02 15:56:54	roadkill	I render raytraced graphics in after effects (GPU offloaded with the GTX 580), edit in Adobe Premiere (again, offloaded), Photoshop and Illustrator to clean up assets (dual i7 is fine)
2016-10-02 15:57:11	xereeto	why do you hate windows on desktop so much but don't mind having it on a laptop?
2016-10-02 15:57:22	roadkill	because my desktop is my primary system
2016-10-02 15:57:26	roadkill	I want linux on it
2016-10-02 15:57:28	jrobeson	is that your job?
2016-10-02 15:57:33	jrobeson	i mean, what is your job 
2016-10-02 15:57:45	roadkill	jrobeson: Effectively. It involves asset production for a tv show
2016-10-02 15:57:49	jrobeson	ah
2016-10-02 15:57:53	roadkill	but since I moved... I do things remotely
2016-10-02 15:57:59	jrobeson	keep up the good work then
2016-10-02 15:58:07	roadkill	ugh
2016-10-02 15:58:59	roadkill	part of why I moved. Fuckers that we're contracted to don't pay as often as they should.
2016-10-02 15:58:59		[15:58]
2016-10-02 15:59:10	xereeto	re wanting linux on your desktop: can't you dualboot?
2016-10-02 15:59:23	xereeto	that's what I do and it works a charm
2016-10-02 15:59:26	jrobeson	dual boot is never the answer 
2016-10-02 15:59:31	jrobeson	i never boot into the dual boot os
2016-10-02 15:59:33	jrobeson	ever
2016-10-02 15:59:37	jrobeson	so i scrapped it
2016-10-02 15:59:56	xereeto	or virtualbox GPU w/ passthrough
2016-10-02 16:00:00	jrobeson	when 95% of the stuff i usually run is on one OS and not the other..
2016-10-02 16:00:06	xereeto	w GPU passthrough*
2016-10-02 16:00:11	jrobeson	yeah, that's an alternative
2016-10-02 16:00:26	jrobeson	i couldn't handle dual booting, too much context switching, too much state loss
2016-10-02 16:00:45	roadkill	xereeto: meh. dualbooting is such a mess.
2016-10-02 16:00:52	xereeto	it's not so bad if you write a couple scripts to ease the process
2016-10-02 16:01:03	roadkill	It's bad when Windows decides to hose grub
2016-10-02 16:01:11	xereeto	>2016
2016-10-02 16:01:13	jrobeson	there's no way it's worth the hassle when i can't run the apps i wanna run on the other system
2016-10-02 16:01:14	xereeto	>grub
2016-10-02 16:01:38	jrobeson	i just run windows in a vm occasionally to run tests for my python code
2016-10-02 16:01:39	xereeto	it's the future, windows shouldn't nuke stuff if you have uefi
2016-10-02 16:01:43	jrobeson	uggh.. i need something who really knows windows
2016-10-02 16:01:47	jrobeson	somebody
2016-10-02 16:01:57	roadkill	uefi is another issue. fucking nightmare to deal with
2016-10-02 16:01:58	jrobeson	somebody who can fix these python tests like 10x quicker than I can
2016-10-02 16:02:12	xereeto	am I the only one who likes uefi?
2016-10-02 16:02:48	xereeto	it's a lot cleaner than MBR in my opinion
2016-10-02 16:02:48	roadkill	every kernel update forces my laptop to fail secure boot and PREVENTS ME from entering the BIOS to fix it until I pull the SSD drive and disable the known bootable records.
2016-10-02 16:02:49	xereeto	disable secure boot
2016-10-02 16:02:50	jrobeson	xereeto, i like the theory of uefi
2016-10-02 16:02:55	xereeto	uefi gets a lot of shit because of secure boot but it's not mandatory
2016-10-02 16:03:02	jrobeson	not yet..
2016-10-02 16:03:02	xereeto	you can turn it off
2016-10-02 16:03:14	jrobeson	anyways, i don't have a problem with secure boot 
2016-10-02 16:03:18	xereeto	unless you're on one of these lenovo microsoft boxes
2016-10-02 16:03:21	jrobeson	as long as i can control it
2016-10-02 16:04:03	roadkill	xereeto: not possible with the laptop. Secure Boot or Legacy. Legacy mode means no support for some hardware in it.
2016-10-02 16:04:03	xereeto	then you can't
2016-10-02 16:04:03	xereeto	jesus christ that's horrifying
2016-10-02 16:04:03	xereeto	why would they do that
2016-10-02 16:04:03	roadkill	yep
2016-10-02 16:04:03	roadkill	took me WEEKS to fully figure out
2016-10-02 16:04:03	dhscholb	uefi is a pile of hot garbage
2016-10-02 16:04:03	jrobeson	i think when users can enable and disable secure boot, then it's a good thing
2016-10-02 16:04:03	xereeto	^
2016-10-02 16:04:03	jrobeson	likely with a jumper 
2016-10-02 16:04:09	jrobeson	then somebody can't easily disable it
2016-10-02 16:04:20	xereeto	why not just a config setting
2016-10-02 16:05:01	jrobeson	because then it might be too easy for an adversary to disable it
2016-10-02 16:05:02	roadkill	The laptop came shipped with Windows. All Intel and Linux compatible. Disable secure boot, you lose UEFI and go into legacy mode. Sleep/Suspend was broken, as was touchpad. Enabled UEFI/Secure Boot and the boot menu locks me out of the bios when the kernel gets updated because it's a different boot record.
2016-10-02 16:05:03	xereeto	physical access to your pc = you're fucked
2016-10-02 16:05:07	jrobeson	not really
2016-10-02 16:05:22	jrobeson	just because you can type on the keyboard, doesn't mean people aren't gonna notice you unscrewing things
2016-10-02 16:05:42	xereeto	they won't if you wear overalls and look like a repair man
2016-10-02 16:05:42	jrobeson	sure unrestricted physical access == you're fucked
2016-10-02 16:05:56	jrobeson	it really depends on the circumstance
2016-10-02 16:06:01	roadkill	sledgehammer == you're fucked
2016-10-02 16:06:25	xereeto	depends on your definition of fucked
2016-10-02 16:06:34	jrobeson	true
2016-10-02 16:06:37	xereeto	I'd rather someone smashed my pc than stole my details, cause I have insurance and lots of backups
2016-10-02 16:07:02	jrobeson	but i think too many people say physical access and are assuming unrestricted physical access
2016-10-02 16:07:42	xereeto	then it becomes a physical security issue as opposed to a cybersecurity issue
2016-10-02 16:07:51	xereeto	that's really what it means
2016-10-02 16:07:52	jrobeson	to me, i consider the jumper secure enough for say a group of public terminals where the machines are behind locked cabinets
2016-10-02 16:08:13	jrobeson	then they can't do anything via the exposed keyboard to disable it
2016-10-02 16:09:59	xereeto	counterpoint:
2016-10-02 16:10:06	xereeto	bios admin password
2016-10-02 16:10:22	xereeto	that way you can still have a setting, but what you said still applies
2016-10-02 16:10:35	xereeto	to disable the bios pw you need to open the box and remove the cmos battery
2016-10-02 16:11:10	jrobeson	i guess it would take awhile to crack a decent one!
2016-10-02 16:11:23	xereeto	I'd say it'd be impossible
2016-10-02 16:11:30	xereeto	since you're limited to human input
2016-10-02 16:11:47	jrobeson	are you? fake keyboard would be easy enough
2016-10-02 16:12:00	xereeto	the machine isn't exposed, why should the ports be?
2016-10-02 16:12:02	jrobeson	if it had lockout timeouts like other things, then it'd be really good
2016-10-02 16:12:10	jrobeson	because people like to move the keybaord around
2016-10-02 16:12:22	jrobeson	i've ran public internet terminals, and it's something i noticed

2016-10-02 16:29:43	roadkill	even though it's a decent machine it's probably the cost that bothers me
2016-10-02 16:30:02	+Gr33n3gg	how much is it?
2016-10-02 16:30:34	roadkill	$1249 for the 16GB/256GB model
2016-10-02 16:30:46	+Gr33n3gg	not terrible

2016-10-02 16:31:26	roadkill	9 hour max battery, i7 7500U CPU
2016-10-02 16:31:36	+Gr33n3gg	I spent $3.5k on my computer last year, no regrets
2016-10-02 16:31:42	+Gr33n3gg	get like three of them
2016-10-02 16:31:46	roadkill	$999 for the 8GB Ram 128GB SSD model
2016-10-02 16:32:28	+Gr33n3gg	and you said battery life is 9hrs?
2016-10-02 16:32:33	roadkill	yeah
2016-10-02 16:32:37	+Gr33n3gg	not bad
2016-10-02 16:33:13	roadkill	8GB of ram I can live with, 128GB SSD is kinda squeezing it
2016-10-02 16:33:26	+Gr33n3gg	yeah, I wouldn't
2016-10-02 16:33:34	+Gr33n3gg	I have a surface pro 1, 8gb ram + 128gb ssd
2016-10-02 16:33:38	roadkill	guess I'll just leave one of those tiny USB thumbdrives in the port for storage
2016-10-02 16:33:46	+Gr33n3gg	windows 10 of course, but 128 cuts close
2016-10-02 16:34:05	+Gr33n3gg	if I were you, I'd get the larger drive version
2016-10-02 16:34:05	roadkill	the SSD is user serviceable though
2016-10-02 16:34:13	+Gr33n3gg	ahh yeah, good point
2016-10-02 16:34:30	roadkill	Ram however... is soldered.
2016-10-02 16:34:43	xereeto	what no ram dock? :P
2016-10-02 16:34:44	roadkill	sigh. we need something like a m2 socket for ram 
2016-10-02 16:35:01	roadkill	something lower profile than an sodimm socket so we can stop having soldered (*&^#@!ing ram
2016-10-02 16:35:18	xereeto	soldered ram is horrible
2016-10-02 16:35:57	roadkill	took me ages to find a 
2016-10-02 16:36:04	roadkill	"cloudbook" with a ram socket
2016-10-02 16:36:20	roadkill	that cloudbook is the same laptop I have that has the UEFI/Secure Boot issue
2016-10-02 16:36:40	xereeto	chromebook?
2016-10-02 16:36:40	roadkill	Wanted a fanless laptop. Found a baytrail quadcore atom.
2016-10-02 16:36:44	roadkill	cloudbooks are like windows 10 versions of chromebooks.
2016-10-02 16:36:49	roadkill	small storage.
2016-10-02 16:36:51	xereeto	what the fuck

2016-10-02 16:37:26	xereeto	isn't that a complete ripoff of a chromebook
2016-10-02 16:37:29	roadkill	heh yeah
2016-10-02 16:37:47	roadkill	but no chromebooks have socketed ram, either ;(
2016-10-02 16:37:48	xereeto	yeah that pisses me off
2016-10-02 16:37:54	xereeto	I have an asus c300
2016-10-02 16:37:57	xereeto	2gb ram
2016-10-02 16:38:11	xereeto	runs xubuntu well though
2016-10-02 16:38:14	roadkill	The acer E11 I have has a quadcore atom in it, which I find better for light browsing because if firefox pegs a cpu at 100%, that's only one out of four CPUs affected... instead of one out of two on most systems.
2016-10-02 16:38:36	roadkill	I'd rather have 4 lower powered cores than 2 higher powered ones.
2016-10-02 16:39:13	xereeto	running cables in a college dorm that doesn't allow you to drill holes or use nails is absolutely fucking horrendous
2016-10-02 16:39:13	roadkill	But the E11 has an SATA socket and one ram slot. So I put a 120GB SSD in mine with 8GB of ram and xubuntu flies on it.
2016-10-02 16:39:50	xereeto	it would do
2016-10-02 16:40:53	xereeto	it's pretty lightweight :P
