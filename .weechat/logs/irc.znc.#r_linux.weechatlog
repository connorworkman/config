2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:34:37] that'd just get in my way. [20:34:37]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:34:48] i use gnome with hide top bar, so i only mostly see my one or two apps and that's it [20:34:48]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	rat	[20:34:50] i don't mind it. i like having the stats there. [20:34:50]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	rat	[20:34:59] i'll probably remove the stats if it ever shows up on mr robot [20:34:59]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:35:21] i'd probably be ok with i3 for how i use the computer. i just don't wanna deal with configuring junk.. and i like the integration  [20:35:21]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	rat	[20:35:38] in any case, having an eye on temps, ram usage and network IP is immensely helpful, the rest is just filler [20:35:38]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:36:22] maybe somebody will come up with a cool wm thing that uses all the new "standard" tech so it's easier to fathom the whole system [20:36:22]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	rat	[20:36:38] i tried the conky bar as one line up top but it just got to be to difficult to fit everything in one line [20:36:38]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:36:40] that is, it requires systemd user sessions, and handles xdg autostart and such [20:36:40]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:36:50] my vertical space is too premimum [20:36:50]

2016-09-16 10:39:17	rat	[20:37:09] that's why I shoved the panel to the left side [20:37:09]

2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:38:02] i'd like to see a wm that integrates with packagekit to find widgets  [20:38:02]

2016-09-16 10:40:38	jrobeson	kde is locked in a box now.. they must be configurable forever, or risk the wrath the community
2016-09-16 10:41:32	rat	and it's probably the worst of all the DEs when it comes to dependencies. it's package hell every step of the way.
2016-09-16 10:42:34	rat	i miss yakuake, but just to install that one app on another DE requires about 1.7GB worth of packages to be installed
2016-09-16 10:42:55	rat	because it's dependent on the entie kde package system
2016-09-16 10:43:45	rat	shame, because it really was the best drop down terminal
2016-09-16 10:44:21	jrobeson	well i appreciate that they split the packages up instead of being so monolithc
2016-09-16 10:44:50	jrobeson	you can blame all that on lack of low level primitives imo.
2016-09-16 10:45:30	jrobeson	the only reason it needs 1.7gb is because it has to reimplement the same crap at the system level that gnome/kde does or gtk/qt does 
2016-09-16 10:45:47	jrobeson	so it can't just depend on the generic stuff, because THERE IS NO GENERIC STUFF
2016-09-16 10:46:29	jrobeson	there's huge blank spaces between kernel -> X -> tookit -> DE
2016-09-16 10:47:57	jrobeson	systemd is filling in some of the gaps at least
2016-09-16 10:48:16	jrobeson	like systemd --user 
2016-09-16 10:48:35	jrobeson	heck.. systemd itself, because of the common logging system
2016-09-16 10:51:23	rat	ugh. barf.
