2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:34:37] that'd just get in my way. [20:34:37]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:34:48] i use gnome with hide top bar, so i only mostly see my one or two apps and that's it [20:34:48]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	rat	[20:34:50] i don't mind it. i like having the stats there. [20:34:50]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	rat	[20:34:59] i'll probably remove the stats if it ever shows up on mr robot [20:34:59]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:35:21] i'd probably be ok with i3 for how i use the computer. i just don't wanna deal with configuring junk.. and i like the integration  [20:35:21]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	rat	[20:35:38] in any case, having an eye on temps, ram usage and network IP is immensely helpful, the rest is just filler [20:35:38]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:36:22] maybe somebody will come up with a cool wm thing that uses all the new "standard" tech so it's easier to fathom the whole system [20:36:22]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	rat	[20:36:38] i tried the conky bar as one line up top but it just got to be to difficult to fit everything in one line [20:36:38]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:36:40] that is, it requires systemd user sessions, and handles xdg autostart and such [20:36:40]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:36:50] my vertical space is too premimum [20:36:50]

2016-09-16 10:39:17	rat	[20:37:09] that's why I shoved the panel to the left side [20:37:09]

2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:38:02] i'd like to see a wm that integrates with packagekit to find widgets  [20:38:02]

2016-09-16 10:40:38	jrobeson	kde is locked in a box now.. they must be configurable forever, or risk the wrath the community
2016-09-16 10:41:32	rat	and it's probably the worst of all the DEs when it comes to dependencies. it's package hell every step of the way.
2016-09-16 10:42:34	rat	i miss yakuake, but just to install that one app on another DE requires about 1.7GB worth of packages to be installed
2016-09-16 10:42:55	rat	because it's dependent on the entie kde package system
2016-09-16 10:43:45	rat	shame, because it really was the best drop down terminal
2016-09-16 10:44:21	jrobeson	well i appreciate that they split the packages up instead of being so monolithc
2016-09-16 10:44:50	jrobeson	you can blame all that on lack of low level primitives imo.
2016-09-16 10:45:30	jrobeson	the only reason it needs 1.7gb is because it has to reimplement the same crap at the system level that gnome/kde does or gtk/qt does 
2016-09-16 10:45:47	jrobeson	so it can't just depend on the generic stuff, because THERE IS NO GENERIC STUFF
2016-09-16 10:46:29	jrobeson	there's huge blank spaces between kernel -> X -> tookit -> DE
2016-09-16 10:47:57	jrobeson	systemd is filling in some of the gaps at least
2016-09-16 10:48:16	jrobeson	like systemd --user 
2016-09-16 10:48:35	jrobeson	heck.. systemd itself, because of the common logging system
2016-09-16 10:51:23	rat	ugh. barf.

2016-09-17 11:04:57	dvdmuckle	[18:05:53] you'd also be hard pressed to find something with those specs for cheap, imo [18:05:53]
2016-09-17 11:04:57	dvdmuckle	[18:06:02] but haswell and broadwell chromebooks are both very good [18:06:02]
2016-09-17 11:04:57	dvdmuckle	[18:06:14] at the very least they have upgradable m.2 ssds [18:06:14]
2016-09-17 11:04:57	dvdmuckle	[18:06:39] and "upgradable" ram if you have patience and a steady hand (it's soldered on) [18:06:39]

2016-09-17 11:04:57	+dhscholb	[18:25:29] no soldering required [18:25:29]
2016-09-17 11:04:57	dvdmuckle	[18:26:51] it's sandy bridge [18:26:51]
2016-09-17 11:04:57	dvdmuckle	[18:26:58] and not a very powerful one at that [18:26:58]
2016-09-17 11:04:57	+dhscholb	[18:27:32] that probably won't matter to most people looking for a cheap laptop [18:27:32]

2016-09-17 16:56:53	jrobeson	we wanna run on the newest debian.. and that means no python 3.5 
2016-09-17 16:57:09	jrobeson	they are the only thing holding us to 3.4 
2016-09-17 16:57:22	jrobeson	well that and ubuntu 14.04  
2016-09-17 17:00:54	airen	virtualenv?
2016-09-17 17:06:00		[17:00]
2016-09-17 17:14:29	jrobeson	virtualenvs don't give you new versions of python
2016-09-17 17:14:44	jrobeson	that's what pyenv does (or anaconda/miniconda)
2016-09-17 17:15:19	jrobeson	however I don't think that debian allows such packages in their repo. and you'd cause way too much confusion if you gave them a new python
2016-09-17 17:16:08	jrobeson	i'm personally of the opinion that that stuff is holding all of us back, but there's nothing i can personally do about it :(

2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[02:56:39] uggh debian is holding me back right now [02:56:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[02:56:53] we wanna run on the newest debian.. and that means no python 3.5  [02:56:53]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[02:57:09] they are the only thing holding us to 3.4  [02:57:09]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[02:57:22] well that and ubuntu 14.04   [02:57:22]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	airen	[03:00:54] virtualenv? [03:00:54]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[03:14:29] virtualenvs don't give you new versions of python [03:14:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[03:14:44] that's what pyenv does (or anaconda/miniconda) [03:14:44]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[03:15:19] however I don't think that debian allows such packages in their repo. and you'd cause way too much confusion if you gave them a new python [03:15:19]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[03:16:08] i'm personally of the opinion that that stuff is holding all of us back, but there's nothing i can personally do about it :( [03:16:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	airen	[03:26:17] jrobeson: You can also build a package [03:26:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	airen	[03:26:19] or put it in opt [03:26:19]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	airen	[03:26:23] I mean, there are plenty of options. [03:26:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[03:55:38] opt can't be used for official packages like that [03:55:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[03:57:42] oh, and we don't wanna maintain our own debian packages anyways. neither of us use it [03:57:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	rat	[14:29:30] dvdmuckle: Wrong. The C710 is upgradable. I put 10GB of Ram in mine and upgraded the drive to an SSD. [14:29:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	rat	[14:30:13] and a 1.1Ghz Dualcore SB based Celeron is about equivalent to a 1.6Ghz Core2Duo. Not a slouch. And good for the price. [14:30:13]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	guccimane_	[18:55:10] if i am attempting to install linux onto my custom build desktop, do i need to disconnect my graphics card for the install and reconnect once ubuntu has been installed with drivers? [18:55:10]
