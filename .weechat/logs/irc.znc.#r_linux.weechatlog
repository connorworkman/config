2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:34:37] that'd just get in my way. [20:34:37]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:34:48] i use gnome with hide top bar, so i only mostly see my one or two apps and that's it [20:34:48]

2016-09-16 10:39:17	rat	[20:34:59] i'll probably remove the stats if it ever shows up on mr robot [20:34:59]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:35:21] i'd probably be ok with i3 for how i use the computer. i just don't wanna deal with configuring junk.. and i like the integration  [20:35:21]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	rat	[20:35:38] in any case, having an eye on temps, ram usage and network IP is immensely helpful, the rest is just filler [20:35:38]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:36:22] maybe somebody will come up with a cool wm thing that uses all the new "standard" tech so it's easier to fathom the whole system [20:36:22]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	rat	[20:36:38] i tried the conky bar as one line up top but it just got to be to difficult to fit everything in one line [20:36:38]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:36:40] that is, it requires systemd user sessions, and handles xdg autostart and such [20:36:40]
2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:36:50] my vertical space is too premimum [20:36:50]

2016-09-16 10:39:17	rat	[20:37:09] that's why I shoved the panel to the left side [20:37:09]

2016-09-16 10:39:17	jrobeson	[20:38:02] i'd like to see a wm that integrates with packagekit to find widgets  [20:38:02]

2016-09-16 10:40:38	jrobeson	kde is locked in a box now.. they must be configurable forever, or risk the wrath the community
2016-09-16 10:41:32	rat	and it's probably the worst of all the DEs when it comes to dependencies. it's package hell every step of the way.
2016-09-16 10:42:34	rat	i miss yakuake, but just to install that one app on another DE requires about 1.7GB worth of packages to be installed
2016-09-16 10:42:55	rat	because it's dependent on the entie kde package system
2016-09-16 10:43:45	rat	shame, because it really was the best drop down terminal
2016-09-16 10:44:21	jrobeson	well i appreciate that they split the packages up instead of being so monolithc
2016-09-16 10:44:50	jrobeson	you can blame all that on lack of low level primitives imo.
2016-09-16 10:45:30	jrobeson	the only reason it needs 1.7gb is because it has to reimplement the same crap at the system level that gnome/kde does or gtk/qt does 
2016-09-16 10:45:47	jrobeson	so it can't just depend on the generic stuff, because THERE IS NO GENERIC STUFF
2016-09-16 10:46:29	jrobeson	there's huge blank spaces between kernel -> X -> tookit -> DE
2016-09-16 10:47:57	jrobeson	systemd is filling in some of the gaps at least
2016-09-16 10:48:16	jrobeson	like systemd --user 
2016-09-16 10:48:35	jrobeson	heck.. systemd itself, because of the common logging system
2016-09-16 10:51:23	rat	ugh. barf.

2016-09-17 11:04:57	dvdmuckle	[18:05:53] you'd also be hard pressed to find something with those specs for cheap, imo [18:05:53]
2016-09-17 11:04:57	dvdmuckle	[18:06:02] but haswell and broadwell chromebooks are both very good [18:06:02]
2016-09-17 11:04:57	dvdmuckle	[18:06:14] at the very least they have upgradable m.2 ssds [18:06:14]
2016-09-17 11:04:57	dvdmuckle	[18:06:39] and "upgradable" ram if you have patience and a steady hand (it's soldered on) [18:06:39]

2016-09-17 11:04:57	+dhscholb	[18:25:29] no soldering required [18:25:29]
2016-09-17 11:04:57	dvdmuckle	[18:26:51] it's sandy bridge [18:26:51]
2016-09-17 11:04:57	dvdmuckle	[18:26:58] and not a very powerful one at that [18:26:58]
2016-09-17 11:04:57	+dhscholb	[18:27:32] that probably won't matter to most people looking for a cheap laptop [18:27:32]

2016-09-17 16:56:53	jrobeson	we wanna run on the newest debian.. and that means no python 3.5 
2016-09-17 16:57:09	jrobeson	they are the only thing holding us to 3.4 
2016-09-17 16:57:22	jrobeson	well that and ubuntu 14.04  
2016-09-17 17:00:54	airen	virtualenv?
2016-09-17 17:06:00		[17:00]
2016-09-17 17:14:29	jrobeson	virtualenvs don't give you new versions of python
2016-09-17 17:14:44	jrobeson	that's what pyenv does (or anaconda/miniconda)
2016-09-17 17:15:19	jrobeson	however I don't think that debian allows such packages in their repo. and you'd cause way too much confusion if you gave them a new python
2016-09-17 17:16:08	jrobeson	i'm personally of the opinion that that stuff is holding all of us back, but there's nothing i can personally do about it :(

2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[02:56:39] uggh debian is holding me back right now [02:56:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[02:56:53] we wanna run on the newest debian.. and that means no python 3.5  [02:56:53]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[02:57:09] they are the only thing holding us to 3.4  [02:57:09]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[02:57:22] well that and ubuntu 14.04   [02:57:22]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	airen	[03:00:54] virtualenv? [03:00:54]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[03:14:29] virtualenvs don't give you new versions of python [03:14:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[03:14:44] that's what pyenv does (or anaconda/miniconda) [03:14:44]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[03:15:19] however I don't think that debian allows such packages in their repo. and you'd cause way too much confusion if you gave them a new python [03:15:19]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[03:16:08] i'm personally of the opinion that that stuff is holding all of us back, but there's nothing i can personally do about it :( [03:16:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	airen	[03:26:17] jrobeson: You can also build a package [03:26:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	airen	[03:26:19] or put it in opt [03:26:19]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	airen	[03:26:23] I mean, there are plenty of options. [03:26:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[03:55:38] opt can't be used for official packages like that [03:55:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	jrobeson	[03:57:42] oh, and we don't wanna maintain our own debian packages anyways. neither of us use it [03:57:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	rat	[14:29:30] dvdmuckle: Wrong. The C710 is upgradable. I put 10GB of Ram in mine and upgraded the drive to an SSD. [14:29:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	rat	[14:30:13] and a 1.1Ghz Dualcore SB based Celeron is about equivalent to a 1.6Ghz Core2Duo. Not a slouch. And good for the price. [14:30:13]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	guccimane_	[18:55:10] if i am attempting to install linux onto my custom build desktop, do i need to disconnect my graphics card for the install and reconnect once ubuntu has been installed with drivers? [18:55:10]

2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[02:22:33] hah..  [02:22:33]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	dhscholb	[02:50:27] we ruin debian where i work [02:50:27]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[02:56:33] :) [02:56:33]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[02:56:39] uggh debian is holding me back right now [02:56:39]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[02:56:53] we wanna run on the newest debian.. and that means no python 3.5  [02:56:53]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[02:57:09] they are the only thing holding us to 3.4  [02:57:09]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[02:57:22] well that and ubuntu 14.04   [02:57:22]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	airen	[03:00:54] virtualenv? [03:00:54]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[03:14:29] virtualenvs don't give you new versions of python [03:14:29]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[03:14:44] that's what pyenv does (or anaconda/miniconda) [03:14:44]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[03:15:19] however I don't think that debian allows such packages in their repo. and you'd cause way too much confusion if you gave them a new python [03:15:19]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[03:16:08] i'm personally of the opinion that that stuff is holding all of us back, but there's nothing i can personally do about it :( [03:16:08]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	airen	[03:26:17] jrobeson: You can also build a package [03:26:17]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	airen	[03:26:19] or put it in opt [03:26:19]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	airen	[03:26:23] I mean, there are plenty of options. [03:26:23]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[03:55:38] opt can't be used for official packages like that [03:55:38]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[03:57:42] oh, and we don't wanna maintain our own debian packages anyways. neither of us use it [03:57:42]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	rat	[14:29:30] dvdmuckle: Wrong. The C710 is upgradable. I put 10GB of Ram in mine and upgraded the drive to an SSD. [14:29:30]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	rat	[14:30:13] and a 1.1Ghz Dualcore SB based Celeron is about equivalent to a 1.6Ghz Core2Duo. Not a slouch. And good for the price. [14:30:13]

2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[20:51:34] no [20:51:34]
2016-09-20 00:39:08	jrobeson	[20:51:48] or rather, that's not normal procedure to have to do so [20:51:48]

2016-09-20 02:13:06		[02:13]
2016-09-20 02:13:12	mewshi	I mean... that's... something.
2016-09-20 02:15:34	logiz	NegativeFlare: uninstalled vim-minimal because it conflicted with vim8

2016-09-20 02:16:18	mewshi	And that... took sudo with it? o.o
2016-09-20 02:17:28	logiz	sudo depends on vim-minimal
2016-09-20 02:20:36	mewshi	What system depends on a specific vim package?
2016-09-20 02:20:55	logiz	fedora
2016-09-20 02:21:12	logiz	it's cause of visudo
2016-09-20 02:27:00		[02:21]
2016-09-20 02:45:06	mewshi	I... ok.  Why not just any vi* package?

2016-09-20 03:04:34	dhscholb	or why not just assume that an editor is already installed and forget the dependency altogether
2016-09-20 03:05:10	dhscholb	if you don't have an editor installed, you have bigger problems than not being able to use visudo

2016-09-20 07:33:43	logiz	mewshi: I mean I think sudoers shouldn't have any of those dependencies, since you can edit the config with nano or whatever, but the fact I have vim-minimal and vim8 is annoying
2016-09-20 07:39:00		[07:33]
2016-09-20 07:41:31	dhscholb	yeah, it seems odd that vim8 wouldn't satisfy that dependency, or any other editor for that matter
2016-09-20 07:41:46	dhscholb	but then, i know nothing about how rpm does deps

2016-09-20 18:53:18	mewshi	[12:13:06] logiz, how did you accidentally uninstall sudo? [12:13:06]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	mewshi	[12:13:12] I mean... that's... something. [12:13:12]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	logiz	[12:15:34] NegativeFlare: uninstalled vim-minimal because it conflicted with vim8 [12:15:34]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	logiz	[12:15:41] mewshi: * [12:15:41]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	mewshi	[12:16:18] And that... took sudo with it? o.o [12:16:18]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	logiz	[12:17:28] sudo depends on vim-minimal [12:17:28]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	mewshi	[12:20:36] What system depends on a specific vim package? [12:20:36]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	logiz	[12:20:55] fedora [12:20:55]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	logiz	[12:21:12] it's cause of visudo [12:21:12]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	mewshi	[12:45:06] I... ok.  Why not just any vi* package? [12:45:06]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dhscholb	[13:03:19] lol, fedora [13:03:19]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dhscholb	[13:04:34] or why not just assume that an editor is already installed and forget the dependency altogether [13:04:34]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dhscholb	[13:05:10] if you don't have an editor installed, you have bigger problems than not being able to use visudo [13:05:10]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	logiz	[14:10:48] mewshi: cause that's what the dependency structure is I didn't choose it [14:10:48]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	mewshi	[17:14:55] I wasn't saying it's your fault, just questioning the maintainers :) [17:14:55]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dhscholb	[17:16:17] i still blame logiz  [17:16:17]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	logiz	[17:33:43] mewshi: I mean I think sudoers shouldn't have any of those dependencies, since you can edit the config with nano or whatever, but the fact I have vim-minimal and vim8 is annoying [17:33:43]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dhscholb	[17:41:31] yeah, it seems odd that vim8 wouldn't satisfy that dependency, or any other editor for that matter [17:41:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dhscholb	[17:41:46] but then, i know nothing about how rpm does deps [17:41:46]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	logiz	[18:42:04] fix one bug, find like 100 more [18:42:04]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	logiz	[18:42:13] I'm convinced this thing I wrote will never be free of bugs [18:42:13]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	 *	dhscholb [19:03:05] gives logiz a box of bug spray  [19:03:05]

2016-09-20 18:53:18	jrobeson	[20:23:52] dhscholb, until recently fedora didn't support weak dependencies , or suggests/recommends.  [20:23:52]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	jrobeson	[20:24:01] i think it was related to rpm issues [20:24:01]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	jrobeson	[20:24:24] and since the last two fedora releases, they've been cleaning that up. [20:24:24]

2016-09-20 18:53:18	pheonix991	[02:03:15] I added the IP of the server to my personal dns server so I can now access the north korean web. [02:03:15]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	pheonix991	[02:03:26] well, I can resolve the web site names. [02:03:26]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	pheonix991	[02:03:30] instead of having to use IPs [02:03:30]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dhscholb	[02:04:31] do they resolve porn sites? [02:04:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dhscholb	[02:04:45] i wonder if they've blocked that stuff [02:04:45]

2016-09-21 12:41:38	mewshi	[12:13:06] logiz, how did you accidentally uninstall sudo? [12:13:06]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	mewshi	[12:13:12] I mean... that's... something. [12:13:12]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	logiz	[12:15:34] NegativeFlare: uninstalled vim-minimal because it conflicted with vim8 [12:15:34]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	logiz	[12:15:41] mewshi: * [12:15:41]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	mewshi	[12:16:18] And that... took sudo with it? o.o [12:16:18]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	logiz	[12:17:28] sudo depends on vim-minimal [12:17:28]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	mewshi	[12:20:36] What system depends on a specific vim package? [12:20:36]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	logiz	[12:20:55] fedora [12:20:55]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	logiz	[12:21:12] it's cause of visudo [12:21:12]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	mewshi	[12:45:06] I... ok.  Why not just any vi* package? [12:45:06]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	dhscholb	[13:03:19] lol, fedora [13:03:19]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	dhscholb	[13:04:34] or why not just assume that an editor is already installed and forget the dependency altogether [13:04:34]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	dhscholb	[13:05:10] if you don't have an editor installed, you have bigger problems than not being able to use visudo [13:05:10]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	logiz	[14:10:48] mewshi: cause that's what the dependency structure is I didn't choose it [14:10:48]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	mewshi	[17:14:55] I wasn't saying it's your fault, just questioning the maintainers :) [17:14:55]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	dhscholb	[17:16:17] i still blame logiz  [17:16:17]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	logiz	[17:33:43] mewshi: I mean I think sudoers shouldn't have any of those dependencies, since you can edit the config with nano or whatever, but the fact I have vim-minimal and vim8 is annoying [17:33:43]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	dhscholb	[17:41:31] yeah, it seems odd that vim8 wouldn't satisfy that dependency, or any other editor for that matter [17:41:31]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	dhscholb	[17:41:46] but then, i know nothing about how rpm does deps [17:41:46]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	logiz	[18:42:04] fix one bug, find like 100 more [18:42:04]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	logiz	[18:42:13] I'm convinced this thing I wrote will never be free of bugs [18:42:13]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	 *	dhscholb [19:03:05] gives logiz a box of bug spray  [19:03:05]

2016-09-21 12:41:38	logiz	[19:38:47] raise Exception('all your bugs are belong to us') [19:38:47]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	jrobeson	[20:23:52] dhscholb, until recently fedora didn't support weak dependencies , or suggests/recommends.  [20:23:52]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	jrobeson	[20:24:01] i think it was related to rpm issues [20:24:01]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	jrobeson	[20:24:24] and since the last two fedora releases, they've been cleaning that up. [20:24:24]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	dhscholb	[00:54:40] slycurgus: ya ded? [00:54:40]

2016-09-21 12:41:38	pheonix991	[01:55:20] Anyone else add the North Korean name server to their list of forwarders? [01:55:20]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	dhscholb	[02:01:59] the what now? [02:01:59]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	pheonix991	[02:02:54] North Korean dns server access is open currently. [02:02:54]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	pheonix991	[02:03:15] I added the IP of the server to my personal dns server so I can now access the north korean web. [02:03:15]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	pheonix991	[02:03:26] well, I can resolve the web site names. [02:03:26]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	pheonix991	[02:03:30] instead of having to use IPs [02:03:30]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	dhscholb	[02:04:31] do they resolve porn sites? [02:04:31]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	dhscholb	[02:04:45] i wonder if they've blocked that stuff [02:04:45]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	pheonix991	[02:05:02] let me see if I can figure out their google [02:05:02]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	pheonix991	[02:22:59] not coming up with one... [02:22:59]

2016-09-21 14:25:05	dvdmuckle	bought a vt420 terminal, got my pi hooked up to the network
2016-09-21 14:25:05		[14:25]
2016-09-21 14:25:18	dvdmuckle	now i have to wait for next friday for the terminal to arrive
2016-09-21 14:26:46	logiz	the terminal for potheads
2016-09-21 14:26:53	dvdmuckle	indeed
2016-09-21 14:27:03	logiz	that thing costs more than a chromebook
2016-09-21 14:27:12	dvdmuckle	fitting, as a popular rumor on campus is the guy who invented lsd went here
2016-09-21 14:27:19	dvdmuckle	i don't believe that's true but people still say it
2016-09-21 14:28:04	dvdmuckle	the vt420? i got it for $137, that's with shipping
2016-09-21 14:28:20	dvdmuckle	i have my eyes on a chromebook PAINE that's refurbed from acer for $150
2016-09-21 14:29:02	logiz	albert hoffman?
2016-09-21 14:29:08	logiz	bro do you even ride a bike?
2016-09-21 14:34:18	dvdmuckle	i have a bike, yes
2016-09-21 14:34:27	dvdmuckle	i mostly walk places but that's besides the point
2016-09-21 14:35:18	dvdmuckle	but a lot of the people here are fans of, erm... "vintage" items *coughhipsters* so i hope my project will be appreciated
2016-09-21 14:35:40	dvdmuckle	i know the average age of our computer science professors is somewhere around 60-50 so that's good
2016-09-21 14:35:48	logiz	heh
2016-09-21 14:36:04	logiz	that's cause younger comp sci people are smart enough to know being a professor ain't where the money is
2016-09-21 14:36:26	dvdmuckle	i asked for input on which terminal they would prefer and one (the head of the department) said the one i purchased, while the other (my advisor) suggested the televideo 910 which was... $250 more
2016-09-21 14:36:38	logiz	[M#??heh
2016-09-21 14:36:41	logiz	wtf
2016-09-21 14:36:43	dvdmuckle	well, my advisor did work at amazon for a time
2016-09-21 14:36:54	dvdmuckle	he helped on the amazon echo
2016-09-21 14:36:58	logiz	neat
2016-09-21 14:37:04	logiz	I know a prof that worked on watson
2016-09-21 14:37:10	dvdmuckle	but he's also the only person in the department to actually do something beyond an educational vocation
2016-09-21 14:37:12	logiz	left the school cause of money
2016-09-21 14:37:28	logiz	asked for a 10k raise, they said no, took a 100k raise at ibm
2016-09-21 14:38:14	logiz	we live in kind of an amazing time though
2016-09-21 14:38:43	logiz	almost all professors everywhere are going to be good, gone to better schools than the students could ever hope to get in, have done more interesting projects than students will ever hope to do
2016-09-21 14:38:50	logiz	real foundational shit
2016-09-21 14:39:10	dvdmuckle	it is rather amazing
2016-09-21 14:39:12	logiz	hell over in CA there are plenty of people that teach like one class just for fun, then hope on the bus to google
2016-09-21 14:39:18	logiz	I think that's the way to do it
2016-09-21 14:39:44	logiz	I'd rather have a professor there cause they want to be there, cause they make bank at a company doing cool shit, than the adjunct trying to make tenure and making less than an intern
2016-09-21 14:39:53	logiz	cause they'll get burnt out super fast
2016-09-21 14:41:25	dvdmuckle	i'd like to believe my advisor is doing this because he likes it. i'm currently taking what he calls his favorite class and it's almost my favorite because he's so good at teaching the material
2016-09-21 14:41:25		[14:41]
2016-09-21 14:43:00	dhscholb	yeah, the best teachers that I had in college either currently or formerly worked in industry
2016-09-21 14:43:29	dhscholb	but then again, my focus was for industry, so it kind of makes sense
2016-09-21 14:43:50	dhscholb	if your focus is pure academia, then you might have a different opinion
2016-09-21 14:45:13	logiz	my focus was academia for quite a while
2016-09-21 14:45:31	logiz	but unless you're at absolutely the best school doing the best work, it doesn't matter, life is much happier with a job and doing shit just cause
2016-09-21 14:45:55	dhscholb	yeah, academia is not for me
2016-09-21 14:46:09	dhscholb	i want to build stuff

2016-09-21 17:58:16	logiz	it's not really something you believe until you're turned down from all the internships
2016-09-21 17:58:51	logiz	which is also why I strongly support unionization
2016-09-21 17:59:30	jrobeson	are you more talking about apprenticeships at that point?

2016-09-21 18:01:29	logiz	tech positions are interesting because it kind of is one of the easiest ways for a lot of us to get away from typical blue collar jobs, and you meet a lot of those people, but you meet a lot more people that don't understand because their dads got them a job with [large tech firm] at 13
2016-09-21 18:01:40	logiz	wallstreet is like that too though

2016-09-21 18:04:12	logiz	gotta look a certain way, have certain beliefs, act a certain way, blah blah blah

2016-09-21 19:07:02	dhscholb	[00:43:28] but then again, my focus was for industry, so it kind of makes sense [00:43:28]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	dhscholb	[00:43:49] if your focus is pure academia, then you might have a different opinion [00:43:49]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[00:45:12] my focus was academia for quite a while [00:45:12]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[00:45:30] but unless you're at absolutely the best school doing the best work, it doesn't matter, life is much happier with a job and doing shit just cause [00:45:30]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	dhscholb	[00:45:54] yeah, academia is not for me [00:45:54]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	dhscholb	[00:46:08] i want to build stuff [00:46:08]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	rat	[03:48:07] logiz: honestly. internships (aka slave labor) will get you much further than courses. [03:48:07]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	rat	[03:48:24] if you have the means to do it, 'volunteer' at the kind of place you want to work at and get your experience that way [03:48:24]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	dvdmuckle	[03:51:52] rat: that reminds me, i have an email to write wrt internships [03:51:52]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[03:54:28] rat: that's why internships are reserved for rich kids [03:54:28]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	jrobeson	[03:56:40] terrible .. [03:56:40]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	jrobeson	[03:56:58] true though.. [03:56:58]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[03:58:16] it's not really something you believe until you're turned down from all the internships [03:58:16]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[03:58:51] which is also why I strongly support unionization [03:58:51]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	jrobeson	[03:59:29] are you more talking about apprenticeships at that point? [03:59:29]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[03:59:38] in this case, yes [03:59:38]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	jrobeson	[03:59:38] i know we need more of that [03:59:38]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	 *	jrobeson [03:59:57] pours sugar on logiz (not salt) [03:59:57]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:00:13] I've gotten into a lot of arguments about this in person [04:00:13]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:01:29] tech positions are interesting because it kind of is one of the easiest ways for a lot of us to get away from typical blue collar jobs, and you meet a lot of those people, but you meet a lot more people that don't understand because their dads got them a job with [large tech firm] at 13 [04:01:29]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:01:40] wallstreet is like that too though [04:01:40]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	jrobeson	[04:02:24] i know i know about that.. i grew up around people who never had that sort of money [04:02:24]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:02:39] I'm just saying, it's kind of surreal [04:02:39]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:03:20] I know a handful of people that are having a hell of a time getting a job because they're "not cultural fits" [04:03:20]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:03:51] they have experience too [04:03:51]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:04:12] gotta look a certain way, have certain beliefs, act a certain way, blah blah blah [04:04:12]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:05:01] there's one particular person, where I won't mention the details, but I'd have made a really big scene about, except they didn't want that to happen [04:05:01]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:06:09] funny thing is, I actually turned down that position, which would have paid a hell of a lot more, but I'm glad I did, cause they're a bunch of assholes and I wouldn't want to be around those people [04:06:09]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	jrobeson	[04:08:57] good good good [04:08:57]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	rat	[04:21:53] it sucks that it means you have to work without pay but it's also possible to do without going to school... so you actually do save some money that way [04:21:53]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	rat	[04:22:11] so internships are a double edged sword [04:22:11]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	rat	[04:22:23] you really do get a lot out of them though. [04:22:23]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	rat	[04:22:31] IF you can afford to do it. [04:22:31]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	jrobeson	[04:27:28] at least you can get some free money to go to school, but nobody is gonna fund you to live during your internship [04:27:28]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:30:34] ^ [04:30:34]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:30:56] also getting an internship without going to school, lol [04:30:56]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:31:25] they're just going to tell you "you don't have 5 years of node experience" [04:31:25]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:31:46] "but I thought this was an internship"  "yah, we're not funded yet, and what we really need is a rich college boy who will work 20 hours a day" [04:31:46]
2016-09-21 19:07:02	logiz	[04:45:24] huh, amazon will ship me wine within 2 hours [04:45:24]

2016-09-22 00:23:55	logiz	[00:37:27] asked for a 10k raise, they said no, took a 100k raise at ibm [00:37:27]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	logiz	[00:38:13] we live in kind of an amazing time though [00:38:13]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	logiz	[00:38:42] almost all professors everywhere are going to be good, gone to better schools than the students could ever hope to get in, have done more interesting projects than students will ever hope to do [00:38:42]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	logiz	[00:38:49] real foundational shit [00:38:49]

2016-09-22 00:23:55	logiz	[00:39:11] hell over in CA there are plenty of people that teach like one class just for fun, then hope on the bus to google [00:39:11]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	logiz	[00:39:17] I think that's the way to do it [00:39:17]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	logiz	[00:39:43] I'd rather have a professor there cause they want to be there, cause they make bank at a company doing cool shit, than the adjunct trying to make tenure and making less than an intern [00:39:43]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	logiz	[00:39:52] cause they'll get burnt out super fast [00:39:52]

2016-09-22 16:11:34	logiz	why would you want to do that
2016-09-22 16:11:44	dvdmuckle	so i can connect my vt420 terminal to a server
2016-09-22 16:11:54	dvdmuckle	through a rpi

2016-09-22 16:12:10	dvdmuckle	local in the sense that it's on the same network
2016-09-22 16:12:37	dvdmuckle	it's either socat or an ssh thin client script a friend and i were working on

2016-09-23 12:21:09	dvdmuckle	[02:10:41] ssh or socat [02:10:41]
2016-09-23 12:21:09	logiz	[02:11:09] the fuck is socat [02:11:09]
2016-09-23 12:21:09	dvdmuckle	[02:11:17] http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/ [02:11:17]
2016-09-23 12:21:10	dvdmuckle	[02:11:21] can port a tty over a tcp port [02:11:21]
2016-09-23 12:21:10	dvdmuckle	[02:11:32] or something like that [02:11:32]
2016-09-23 12:21:10	logiz	[02:11:33] why would you want to do that [02:11:33]
2016-09-23 12:21:10	dvdmuckle	[02:11:43] so i can connect my vt420 terminal to a server [02:11:43]
2016-09-23 12:21:10	dvdmuckle	[02:11:53] through a rpi [02:11:53]
2016-09-23 12:21:10	dvdmuckle	[02:12:04] so vt420 > rpi > local server [02:12:04]
2016-09-23 12:21:10	dvdmuckle	[02:12:09] local in the sense that it's on the same network [02:12:09]
2016-09-23 12:21:10	dvdmuckle	[02:12:35] it's either socat or an ssh thin client script a friend and i were working on [02:12:35]
2016-09-23 12:21:10	dvdmuckle	[02:13:48] preliminary searches for "raspberry pi thin client" didn't turn up anything too helpful [02:13:48]

2016-09-23 15:17:18	fauxm	I mostly just want C-w to stop closing my goddamn tabs
2016-09-23 15:18:33	fauxm	I set it in my config files but nothing seems to use it

2016-09-23 15:37:15	jrobeson	give an example please
2016-09-23 15:38:00	logiz	I assume stuff like clicking since it's in some docs I saw before, but it seems like I might be able to watch values of items through the debugger

2016-09-23 15:43:54	logiz	well I kind of fixed something but the stupid name is copying the other names
