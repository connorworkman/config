2016-09-09 00:44:10	Homoiconicity	dmbaturin: eh, they wanted me to teach a musician the songs of a certain play
2016-09-09 00:44:11	dmbaturin	Homoiconicity: Also, lately something happened that made me remember the singer training discussion we had the other day. My mother came in where I've been practicing clarinet. She can't sing even simple stuff in tune, but she always notices when someone sings off key, which I always attributed to familiarity and musical memory. I played concert F major scale up and down, she noted that the next to last note was out of tune. It ...
2016-09-09 00:44:17	dmbaturin	... indeed was, but the familiarity part doesn't work here, it's not like she gets to hear scales any often.
2016-09-09 00:45:49	Homoiconicity	dmbaturin: my guess is, maybe by hearing tonal music in 12TET over time, one comes to expect the degrees to be certain exact pitches.
2016-09-09 00:47:27	dmbaturin	Homoiconicity: Yeah, I think it's something like this, though it would be interesting to research. What surprised me though is the disparity between singing ability and hearing that something is out of tune when it's not familiar.
2016-09-09 00:51:32	Homoiconicity	hm...
2016-09-09 00:52:03	Homoiconicity	I'm experiencing greater success with teaching people with solfege. Even those who have never done solfege before.

2016-09-09 00:53:06	Homoiconicity	the focus goes from the words of the song, and instead there's only one fixed syllable per scale degree, and most of the focus is on the pitch itself.
2016-09-09 00:59:00		[00:53]
2016-09-09 01:02:07	dmbaturin	...the reason I play E natural out of tune so often at this point is that its fingering involves the thumb hole and two trill keys.
2016-09-09 01:02:53	Homoiconicity	o.o
2016-09-09 01:03:11	Homoiconicity	wind instruments are crazy.
2016-09-09 01:03:34	Homoiconicity	atleast on keyboard instruments and string instruments you know exactly what pitches are possible at the very first glance.
2016-09-09 01:04:24	Homoiconicity	on a wind instrument you do all sorts of incantations and dances to get a note, and there's more than one way to get the same one, and you might discover new ways for it, too xD

2016-09-09 03:43:22	dmbaturin	M4l3z: My primary motivation is that if authors give up on it, in the worst case I can just fork it myself and keep using it. Not always feasible with open source, but plain impossible with proprietary.
2016-09-09 03:43:50	dmbaturin	Everything else is a bonus, though yeah, the abundance of proprietary applications that keep calling home is unsettling.
2016-09-09 03:44:05	holstein	one can, if its "mission critical", pay a person or persons to do the fork
2016-09-09 03:44:52	holstein	at least, if its open, there are options
2016-09-09 03:45:06	dmbaturin	Yeah, you can come up with something. Wait for a fork, pay someone, or fork yourself, whatever works for you.
2016-09-09 03:47:09	M4l3z	Very true.
2016-09-09 03:47:23	M4l3z	I dont have the coding skills to fork a soft I like tho.

2016-09-09 03:48:19	M4l3z	yep
2016-09-09 03:48:21	dmbaturin	Though, call home is one issue, but just license registration can be a very big problem, if it gets discontinued. E.g. if hard drive dies and you have to reinstall, but the license registration server was taken down by the vendor after they dropped support for the program, and now you have no way to install it, other than find or write a keygen.
2016-09-09 03:48:28	holstein	i dont either.. and i dont want to invest the time, likely, to do so.. but, if its open, one has the option.. if its not, one doesnt
2016-09-09 03:48:50	dmbaturin	I still have Kylix binaries somewhere that I got when it was supported. ;)
2016-09-09 03:49:20	klopsi-u3	my webcam isn't supported anyway
2016-09-09 03:49:47	rghvdberg	I still have my Cubase Audio 1.0 dongle .. no printerport to put it in though ;-)
2016-09-09 03:51:32	dmbaturin	It was even funnier with an ML compiler that was rescued from the defunct vendor and released as open source, but to make use of the last propritary version to bootstrap it from source code, people had to write a license server emulator.
2016-09-09 03:52:22	rghvdberg	ok, gotta go
2016-09-09 03:52:52	rghvdberg	do bandcoaching :-)  kids from 8 - 12 yrs so much fun

2016-09-09 03:53:27	dmbaturin	Do they play teen pop? ;)
2016-09-09 03:53:40	rghvdberg	just some top 40 stuff
2016-09-09 03:54:49	rghvdberg	we also have two teen groups (13 ~20). already they formed real bands and perform here and there
2016-09-09 03:55:38	dmbaturin	...actually, I've seen companies using keygens and dongle emulators on legitimately licensed software because license activation was so tedious and unreliable they just needed this to keep it from stopping working over license activation glitches.
2016-09-09 03:55:52	rghvdberg	but atm I'm happy if they start and finish the song all at the same time :-)

2016-09-09 04:42:01	holstein	no heat control, on it.. but a nice carrying case :)
2016-09-09 04:42:20	leebre	and as say are sayin here in germany while showing you the cheap chinese iron, you shoulw get the german irons, because its also a matter of security

2016-09-09 04:43:52	holstein	NeoFrontier: what thing, friend?
2016-09-09 04:43:59	dmbaturin	Well, soldering used to be a useful skill when most of electronic equipment used large components that are easy to solder with a soldering iron. Now it's only good for repairing older equipment, or for an increasingly shrinking category of DIY stuff.
2016-09-09 04:44:07	leebre	no we germans are only using gold foil, i told you allready ;)
2016-09-09 04:44:20	NeoFrontier	That thing you play man.

2016-09-09 04:47:16	dmbaturin	Though, it's kind amusing how some things are relatively new even though they are not all that hard to make. Apparently correcting intonation issues across registers with slightly different bore diameter at different places in woodwinds is just last 40 years thing or so. Likewise, truss rods in guitar necks.
2016-09-09 04:47:22	leebre	there is one nice germanbass manufactor who spins the coils themselves
2016-09-09 04:48:36	leebre	you need oscilloscopesto measure such things...now those arent expensive anymore, 20 years ago those devices costed some thousand  escudos i think
2016-09-09 04:49:39	holstein	well, if you want a "hand crafted" oscilloscope, not those shitty, china made, production ones..
2016-09-09 04:49:53	leebre	i have to sell my liver
2016-09-09 04:50:00	leebre	or kidney
2016-09-09 04:50:02	dmbaturin	leebre: There were always relatively cheap oscilloscopes. It didn't change too much, there are still $20k oscilloscopes for serious research use, and $200 ones for less sensitive applications, $200 ones just don't suck that much anymore.
2016-09-09 04:50:03	holstein	and, you want to order it, using a "hand made" computer, to connect to the internet..
2016-09-09 04:50:23	leebre	sure
2016-09-09 04:50:46	leebre	i am here on hand woofen internet i must be a bad ass to use a normal not hand crafted computer for that
2016-09-09 04:51:15	holstein	its the only way.. its a matter of security, really ;)
2016-09-09 04:51:22	dmbaturin	In our school, a lot of lab work classes started with calibrating and fixing equipment. Anecdotally, some people received a grade for fixing it alone, so that actual class can proceed. ;)
2016-09-09 04:51:27	leebre	and security is what matters
2016-09-09 04:51:40	leebre	security and the length of my nose
2016-09-09 04:51:45	dmbaturin	Those 60's cheap oscilloscopes, I hope to never see them again.
2016-09-09 04:51:51	leebre	hehehe
2016-09-09 04:52:43	leebre	we used those at school , we measure transistors and put the values into coordinate system toget the "lines" for the different transistors

2016-09-09 05:04:31	leebre	sure, 500 years ago
2016-09-09 05:05:09	leebre	nowadays, no.....there was even one black guy and one jew on our school though there were rules only christian baptized were allowed to go there
2016-09-09 05:06:54	leebre	female religion and  biology teachers are great fun...music teachers at school were boring as hell
2016-09-09 05:07:32	dmbaturin	Pretty odd considering the rich musical traditions of the catholic church.
2016-09-09 05:07:46	holstein	leebre: i think what you are looking for is called "edutainment"..
2016-09-09 05:08:04	leebre	yeah, i live being entertained, and i love to entertain

2016-09-09 05:08:27	holstein	sure.. just dont expect that from the teachers you have, and it wont be a problem ;)
2016-09-09 05:09:22	dmbaturin	Eastern orthodox church still limits liturgical music to singing, and has a long history of actively fighting instrumental music. Not to say their singing tradition is bad.
2016-09-09 05:09:56	holstein	i actively fight singing, so, i can understand the feeling ;)

2016-09-09 05:11:30	leebre	you must choose a tone scale , tenor, or bass or so, and then you can fake it
2016-09-09 05:11:43	holstein	i was always pretty sure, i sucked, if anyone was around

2016-09-09 05:12:42	dmbaturin	Though sometimes, I've seen people with massive vocal problems, who I just can't call bad singers. What they do is a nice performance, despite all the issues with their voice. This is puzzling.

2016-09-09 05:14:48	nstewart_	my problem is I don't like the basic tone of my voice. It's just too soft for the stuff I want to do
2016-09-09 05:15:06	holstein	one thing about the emotion in someone's work like dylan is,.. you can tell, that guy does not give a shit if you think he sucks or not

2016-09-09 05:28:41	leebre	normally, if they are pro's they should not be emotionally connected
2016-09-09 05:28:59	dmbaturin	I've had interesting experience with assumptions lately. My friend who contributes to OpenSIPs and plays accordion thinks Indirect Kiss is a sad song, and keeps telling me that I should write something happy (rhythm changes contrafact? ;). But, to me, it's not sad.
2016-09-09 05:29:34	holstein	yeah.. theres always that other step, thats challenging to account for.. the interpretation
2016-09-09 05:29:47	holstein	it happens with *all* languages.. and communications..
2016-09-09 05:30:04	dmbaturin	It's definitely not what I was thinking or feeling when writing it, or playing it, or what I wanted to convey. But apparently it can be perceived that way.
2016-09-09 05:30:25	holstein	things can help *guide* that perception.. for sure..
2016-09-09 05:30:25		[05:30]
2016-09-09 05:31:00	holstein	but, we cant always assume anything from the performance, its self.. to do so, is to miss out on that step of interpretation as being part of the process
2016-09-09 05:32:09	holstein	and, im just sidetracked a bit, from the original point.. which was just to say, if we pull up a singer, and we *all* agree, its shitty singing.. we can likely find at least *one* person who likes it.. and in that interpretation is the other part of the process that makes the performance *not* shitty
2016-09-09 05:32:28	leebre	mhhh
2016-09-09 05:32:41	leebre	if you believe in scinece you can adopt their principles
2016-09-09 05:33:15	leebre	if onemillion people would say the voice is not sounding good, the the one person who likes it canbe seen and the exception that defines the rule
2016-09-09 05:33:41	holstein	right. but, its art.. there is no science, or rules with it
2016-09-09 05:33:57	holstein	its just "i have ears, i listen, i discern.. and thats my experience".. thats it
2016-09-09 05:34:36	leebre	sure, but music is based on hearing habbits
2016-09-09 05:34:40	holstein	we can talk, relatively, about what is louder, or higher.. other facts. or, things that we feel personally exhibit emotional traits, but, its not specifically connected to the art
2016-09-09 05:34:43	leebre	its all quite uniformed and generalized
2016-09-09 05:34:54	holstein	its not, though
2016-09-09 05:35:04	holstein	its just a person, with ears, listening.. and thats it
2016-09-09 05:35:27	holstein	we can certainly make more of it, and study the science of the parts of it. but, its not really more than just a person listening..
2016-09-09 05:35:48	leebre	k
2016-09-09 05:35:55	leebre	and its perception
2016-09-09 05:36:05	holstein	not that it has to be isolated to audio perception..

2016-09-09 05:37:40	holstein	all im saying is, the perception is a large part, and, part of where the judgment come in.. the discernment..
2016-09-09 05:37:42	leebre	yes, if you are limiting your input, you can better examine and reflect it maybe

2016-09-09 05:40:42	leebre	nah, a loner can say, i am not interrested in the opinions of others and i dont need any feedback at all
2016-09-09 05:40:53	leebre	the musicians and the artists needs feedback to survive i guess
2016-09-09 05:41:01	holstein	well, "art" doesnt care if you give it feedback

2016-09-09 08:29:29	M4l3z	I like the xylophone lol
2016-09-09 08:29:46	leebre	we should make a central opensource web page
2016-09-09 08:29:57	leebre	with download link collection , reviews and wiki
2016-09-09 08:30:20	leebre	and then a nice logo and name, and every year the best opensource sample lib will be voted by the users
2016-09-09 08:30:36	leebre	not only opensource..opensopurce and freeware sfz samples
2016-09-09 08:30:55	leebre	to bring the scene at that point together

2016-09-09 08:32:02	M4l3z	Oh and the Michael Picher samples were added there too

2016-09-09 08:42:58	leebre	mhhh, maybe some people relying on "breath incumbators" or on brain pacers
2016-09-09 08:43:20	leebre	also , in the age of digitalisation, some people would at least argue against and would say they need it
2016-09-09 08:43:31	holstein	if you need it, you need it..
2016-09-09 08:43:33	leebre	long discussion, what is a reall need...
2016-09-09 08:43:57	leebre	i want to be happy, i dont want to rely on too many things

2016-09-09 08:55:23	klopsi-u3	free soundfonts make happy
2016-09-09 08:55:50	holstein	they make noise, thats for sure
2016-09-09 08:56:23	holstein	i cant say, i have been able to derive any emotional state purely from the existence of a soundfont
2016-09-09 08:56:54	holstein	but, i prolly should just ignore hypothetical sentence fragments..

2016-09-09 09:03:26	leebre	soundfonts were a really big topic for quite some time
2016-09-09 09:03:53	leebre	because you could load em easily into those awe creative labs cards with internal 30 pin ram modules hehehe
2016-09-09 09:04:11	leebre	and then there was even a graphical editor
2016-09-09 09:04:49	leebre	but i really, i really loved my turtle beach pinnacle soundcard with yang chang chipset...this was great, reallynicekurzweil sounds....
2016-09-09 09:05:56	klopsi-u3	yes those were highly rated
2016-09-09 09:05:58	leebre	the k2000 had some more options when programming the sound programs, but the turtlebeach pinnacle was really a great toy

2016-09-09 09:09:43	leebre	samplers existed in three price steps: emu, akai and the roland s-50 for poor people like me
2016-09-09 09:10:02	klopsi-u3	first affordable sampler was ensoniq mirage
2016-09-09 09:10:03	leebre	then came first halion, then kontakt
2016-09-09 09:10:14	edogawa	heh you forgot about fairlight
2016-09-09 09:10:37	leebre	yeah, ensoniq...wasnt that copr not swallowed by emu which was then swallowed by creative
2016-09-09 09:10:39	edogawa	step zero, even less affordable than e-mu
2016-09-09 09:10:42	leebre	farilight cmi hehehe
2016-09-09 09:10:46	klopsi-u3	8-bit sampler
2016-09-09 09:11:07	klopsi-u3	everything sounded like fuzzzzz
2016-09-09 09:11:17	leebre	on 5" floppys hehehe
2016-09-09 09:11:38	leebre	the idea back then was to stay digital, which was rocket science back then
2016-09-09 09:11:46	klopsi-u3	then my friend spent $2000 on the Ensoniq EPS
2016-09-09 09:11:48	 *	edogawa remembers being stunned listening to perter gabriel's 3rd solo album, game without frontiers etc., no fuzz, pretty crystal clear

2016-09-09 09:12:00	leebre	war without tears
2016-09-09 09:12:08	klopsi-u3	and i would stay at his house for days at a time
2016-09-09 09:12:35	leebre	so, staying digital was complicated without vst
2016-09-09 09:12:52	leebre	i routed the sony fx device with spdif....
2016-09-09 09:13:16	leebre	problem was then the master sync clock problem....one must be master the rest must be slaves
2016-09-09 09:13:45	leebre	goal was to had everything in one software, so no more digital analog conversions
2016-09-09 09:14:46	leebre	so, back then, a rme soundcard was not optional, because you needed a card that was able towork as master and as slave...
2016-09-09 09:15:26	leebre	halion came and i started to collect akai sample cds, converted them to halion...til....til kontakt came
2016-09-09 09:15:36	leebre	then i converted the whole sh...to kontakt.....
2016-09-09 09:16:18	leebre	okay, before was gigasampler, but that was standalone, and was quite unstable becauseit was quite resource hungry
2016-09-09 09:16:34	leebre	never collected to feed that monster
2016-09-09 09:18:14	leebre	something is strange, in #openrc they are sayin i should search somewhere else for suggestions....#archbang gives no reaction and the people in #arch are special.....ay

2016-09-09 09:24:41	leebre	about if its still possible touse ffado with latest openrc on arch
2016-09-09 09:25:13	holstein	id ask the folks making the packages.. the distro creators wont have anything to do with it, if they are not in the repo..
2016-09-09 09:25:45	holstein	even if they are, you shouldnt have "package collisions" in repo packages. you can just follow the bug reporting procedures..
2016-09-09 09:26:07	leebre	okay
2016-09-09 09:26:19	leebre	thats what someonein #archbang also suggested
2016-09-09 09:26:19	holstein	if you are using "out of repo", 3rd party, self-supported packages, you are choosing to take it on yourself to maintain things..
2016-09-09 09:26:31	holstein	these are not "archbang" packages..
2016-09-09 09:26:40	leebre	problem is, i dont know exactly where the stuff is coming from, its all quite irritatin

2016-09-09 09:27:21	holstein	right. but, an addition problem is, if you expect the distro maintainers, and supporters to provide you support for things that they cant, and havent promise to support
2016-09-09 09:27:47	holstein	me? im the kind of user that needs to run in repo packages, since, i need that layer of support from that team..
2016-09-09 09:28:30	leebre	i dont expect anything on purpose, i mean, i really just wantto get a hint where i can look for informations,i dont want helpor answer, but a nice go lookin there would help....
2016-09-09 09:28:35	holstein	lol
2016-09-09 09:28:48	holstein	im not questioning or pointing out any intent.. im just saying, you cant get a  hint
2016-09-09 09:29:27	holstein	its like, buying tires for your toyota, from some gas station, on the way out of town.. you hear some noise, and think its the tires, and call toyota.. they just dont do the tires, man
2016-09-09 09:29:53	holstein	its not really anything you can get a hint about, necessarily. though, im sure, someone at toyota can be helpful, and run down a list of possible issues..
2016-09-09 09:29:56	leebre	mmmhh....i am not nervous, but i hope that i canget ffado workin again
2016-09-09 09:30:27	holstein	i use avlinux.. more like an appliance
2016-09-09 09:30:48	holstein	i test it live, when it works, i install. i test the install. then, i dont upgrade, or change, or edit any part of the system
2016-09-09 09:31:12	leebre	iknow, its great, and been around for a longer time, seems grown up serious distribution
2016-09-09 09:31:13	holstein	its a tradeoff.. but, mostly, the new features are not things i need.. and if they are, i'll look for helpful maintainers
2016-09-09 09:31:39	holstein	me? if i wanted "the latest and greatest" all the time, i would get kxstudio, from falktx, and help that community more..

2016-09-09 09:32:11	holstein	sure.. you can do audio work in VM though
2016-09-09 09:32:24	holstein	but, you can mirror, or backup.. etc..
2016-09-09 09:32:34	leebre	there is no greatest, and the latest is very fast ancient....
2016-09-09 09:32:52	dmbaturin	As a distro maintainer, I get my share of those questions. "I did things you explicitly state you don't support, and things broke, please fix". ;)
2016-09-09 09:32:52	holstein	well, im not debating that
2016-09-09 09:33:00	leebre	i want my peace, and somevery lil clean and nice fun
2016-09-09 09:33:19	holstein	im saying, if you want to "break" ffado, by building it yourself, for whatever reason, i would rather just trust falktx to do that for me

2016-09-09 09:33:21	leebre	til now, i came along quite well
2016-09-09 09:33:28	leebre	iamsuprised how easy everything is
2016-09-09 09:33:37	holstein	i maintain peace, by not updating my production machine
2016-09-09 09:33:42	holstein	its not online, so, it doesnt matter..
2016-09-09 09:33:51	leebre	yes
2016-09-09 09:34:25	holstein	there are good things about both ways.. but, "latest and greatest", i just mean, the new stuff, that you are going out of repo for..
2016-09-09 09:34:42	holstein	otherwise, use the repo versions, and you can file bugs, and work with the distro maintainers
2016-09-09 09:34:46	leebre	its not new, its odd
2016-09-09 09:34:50	leebre	hehehe
2016-09-09 09:34:55	holstein	well, it is what it is
2016-09-09 09:34:58	holstein	you either want the things, or not
2016-09-09 09:35:05	holstein	im not speaking to the quality of them
2016-09-09 09:35:09	leebre	yeah, i want openrc
2016-09-09 09:35:13	holstein	im only saying, theres a version, that the repos provice
2016-09-09 09:35:16	holstein	provide*
2016-09-09 09:35:24	holstein	you are choosing, for whatever reason, something else
2016-09-09 09:35:25	leebre	i understand
2016-09-09 09:35:27	holstein	when you do that, you are on your own
2016-09-09 09:35:33	leebre	sure
2016-09-09 09:35:40	holstein	if you dont want to be on your own, use the repo one..
2016-09-09 09:35:46	leebre	youare surely right...but
2016-09-09 09:35:59	holstein	you cant expect the repo maintainers to provide tech support for packages they dont support
2016-09-09 09:36:05	leebre	the arch devs and support people, seem to be quite rought most of the times
2016-09-09 09:36:12	leebre	but they are willing to help people like me hehehe
2016-09-09 09:36:23	leebre	but its very harsh and rough then
2016-09-09 09:36:24	holstein	you cant expect volunteers to volunteer help all the time, when, they are volunteering, and busy
2016-09-09 09:36:25	holstein	me?
2016-09-09 09:36:48	holstein	i *dont* need the latest and greatest... meaning, i can use the stock repo versions.. if i wanted newer/different stuff, i would talk to falktx about it
2016-09-09 09:37:14	holstein	leebre: the "arch folks" dont support people, at all
2016-09-09 09:37:32	leebre	i can go all the ways, like no more updates and then only going online with sandboxed freebsd
2016-09-09 09:37:35	holstein	leebre: they support arch.. its odd to expect them to support "people", and,its why you are hitting friction
2016-09-09 09:38:05	leebre	nothing is frictioned hehehe, yet, i just have tzo stopupdating maybe for some days
2016-09-09 09:38:18	leebre	then maybe the problem will be solved automatically, like allways hehehe
2016-09-09 09:38:21	leebre	but yes
2016-09-09 09:38:22	holstein	leebre: whatever you want to call it, friend.. its why you are not getting help
2016-09-09 09:38:30	holstein	you are asking folks that are not responsible for the things you are doing
2016-09-09 09:38:38	leebre	youare right andi understand every word you just said, no doubt about it
2016-09-09 09:38:46	holstein	cool
2016-09-09 09:38:55	holstein	so *now*, all you have to do is stop bothering those folks ;)
2016-09-09 09:39:03	leebre	okay
2016-09-09 09:39:17	leebre	no more bothering
2016-09-09 09:39:20	holstein	not that thats a demand.. i literally couldnt care less
2016-09-09 09:39:25	leebre	just left #archbang
2016-09-09 09:39:44	holstein	bother whom you like.. but, you wont get your self builds working that way :)
2016-09-09 09:39:47	leebre	i know, you could not care less, you donthave to say it...
2016-09-09 09:40:17	holstein	i mean, about your behavior, in some other channel.. if i had no care, i wouldnt be talking to you
2016-09-09 09:40:30	leebre	til now, ever5ything is working, i just cant update, question is if its my fault...and then i normally really dont like to ask: which fault is it
2016-09-09 09:40:34	holstein	lol
2016-09-09 09:40:43	holstein	leebre: thats bullshit.. you have things broken all the time
2016-09-09 09:40:54	holstein	its not about "fault".. its about, where is the burden of support?
2016-09-09 09:40:59	leebre	youare underlying the wrong impressions
2016-09-09 09:41:12	holstein	if you take it on yourself to make your own packages, thats what you do.. its your responsibility
2016-09-09 09:41:22	holstein	me? i dont do that. since, i dont want to take that responsiblity on
2016-09-09 09:41:55	holstein	i cant do the job better, and, i dont need the newer software..
2016-09-09 09:41:56	leebre	i made maybe 5 songs last month, uploaded it, made virtual machine running, worked on applications, worked on web pages and product pictures, please dont say all the time....that is not true
2016-09-09 09:42:08	holstein	i dont get any benefit,i have only had the same as you.. the breakage
2016-09-09 09:42:24	leebre	there is now one break
2016-09-09 09:42:30	holstein	lol
2016-09-09 09:42:36	leebre	and i will work on it, problems must be solved
2016-09-09 09:42:37	holstein	whatevs..
2016-09-09 09:42:49	leebre	if no one else solves it, i will
2016-09-09 09:42:53	leebre	if i cant, iwil lwork around
2016-09-09 09:43:11	holstein	im not doubting that..
2016-09-09 09:43:46	leebre	switching to freebsd or never doin updates agaun, changing hobby and start  learning skate boardxin
2016-09-09 09:43:57	leebre	hehehehe
2016-09-09 09:44:14	holstein	i dont need updates, on my audio production machine.. to you?
2016-09-09 09:44:26	holstein	this is not a compromise, at all, for me.. maybe it is for you
2016-09-09 09:44:48	leebre	i amused to it, people most times think they help me if they try to, well push my neuralgic points...i mean put saltinmy wounds...hehehe...to wake me up....but i am awake
2016-09-09 09:45:19	leebre	i dont need updates onaudio machine
2016-09-09 09:45:29	holstein	so, the "appliance" scenario would work, fine
2016-09-09 09:45:32	leebre	i dont need updates
2016-09-09 09:45:35	leebre	i dont need dates
2016-09-09 09:45:43	leebre	;)
2016-09-09 09:45:50	holstein	another partition.. install whatever distro you like, set up the environment.. and *boom*.. stop breaking it
2016-09-09 09:46:11	holstein	you can even image it *right* then, so, if the hardware breaks, you are good to go
2016-09-09 09:46:15	leebre	i love now virtual machines....no more installin onpartitions the normal way
2016-09-09 09:46:16	holstein	*when* the hardware breaks
2016-09-09 09:46:26	holstein	sure.. you cant do audio production in VM
2016-09-09 09:46:34	leebre	same with virtualisations
2016-09-09 09:46:50	leebre	okay, this is something...vm is still to slow
2016-09-09 09:47:00	holstein	i mean, maybe you can. and if you can, you can..
2016-09-09 09:47:04	leebre	what about docker containers ? also too slow ?
2016-09-09 09:47:07	holstein	i need the hardware input.. and cant get away with it

2016-09-09 09:49:03	leebre	its a lil annoying, everytime, really, everytime, things are going well, somethinglike this happens....as if...
2016-09-09 09:49:23	holstein	i try my best to plan for the breakage, in advance, since, all hardware fails
2016-09-09 09:49:35	holstein	if i have, for example, a "good" image, in that case, im good to go..
2016-09-09 09:49:45	holstein	but, we all have our own processes..
2016-09-09 09:49:55	holstein	having the latest and greatest is more important to you, and, thats fine
2016-09-09 09:50:05	leebre	no way
2016-09-09 09:50:23	leebre	really ? nah, i am just tryingto be reasonable
2016-09-09 09:51:01	holstein	thats all relative
2016-09-09 09:51:03	leebre	arch linux is a resonable choice, linux-rt is a reasonable choice too, using openrc instead of systemd seems to me like a serious reasonable decision, too
2016-09-09 09:52:35	leebre	look,you would say, dont config linux system after dranken a bottle of vodka, ...thats totally right and reasonable, still there are some people, drinking every day some bottles of vodka and using linux

2016-09-09 09:53:48	leebre	i didnt made it break, it broke by itsself
2016-09-09 09:54:20	holstein	leebre: if you are installing out of repo packages, thats you choosing to maintain it on your own, introducing instability
2016-09-09 09:54:31	holstein	which is fine
2016-09-09 09:54:33	leebre	okay
2016-09-09 09:54:38	leebre	no, now i am unsredtanding
2016-09-09 09:54:38	holstein	its just *you* have to choose to take care of it
2016-09-09 09:54:45	leebre	i thought its all compatible somehow ?
2016-09-09 09:54:59	yann-kaelig	JackWinter, my desktop motherboard is dead. No more usb power, my usb mouse and keyboard are no longer supllied, no video output, :(

2016-09-09 09:55:30	holstein	leebre: sure!.. go for it.. but, you are not doing that
2016-09-09 09:55:43	leebre	noo hehehe
2016-09-09 09:55:49	holstein	leebre: you are installing part of one, changing *large* parts of the os, to self maintain, and not doing that
2016-09-09 09:56:13	holstein	you are not really using stock archbang, or, arch with supported packages..

2016-09-09 09:56:35	holstein	sure
2016-09-09 09:56:54	holstein	me too.. i take care of my systems by  not changing them, since i dont need to
2016-09-09 09:57:21	holstein	if you do? and you want/need unsupported packages, thats *great*, but, you choose to support them
2016-09-09 09:57:21	leebre	i am using arch,not arch bang, noow that i ve found out how to install arch, i dont need toinstall archbang. today i went to #archbang because they are working on openrc and arch linux

2016-09-09 09:59:07	leebre	see,i am reading that completly different
2016-09-09 09:59:09	holstein	your problem is, expecting the support, at this point ;)
2016-09-09 09:59:25	holstein	*you* are not supported. *arch* is supported

2016-09-09 10:00:44	leebre	hehehehe
2016-09-09 10:00:49	holstein	as in.. "arch only supports systemd, officially"
2016-09-09 10:00:57	leebre	its okay, i am really understanding...
2016-09-09 10:01:02	holstein	so, no openrc support, officially.. you are choosing to be on your own..
2016-09-09 10:01:06	JackWinter	yann-kaelig: oop, that's sad..
2016-09-09 10:01:34	leebre	most of the times, i like to go the unofficial way but, yes, youare right
2016-09-09 10:01:39	holstein	which is fine.. *choose* that. its just that you seem to not quite fully understand the gravity, potentially, of being on your own, with a large base chunk of the system, like that
2016-09-09 10:02:17	holstein	leebre: you *can* go, as unofficial, as you like.. you are free to.. the problem is, being surprised, when you dont have the support, or the same experience as the "officially supported" users ;)
2016-09-09 10:02:19	JackWinter	what happened?

2016-09-09 10:05:03	rghvdberg	the whole arch thing ... is it really that much better than debian based distros ? (ubuntu/mint)
2016-09-09 10:05:05	leebre	my maine DAW is allready in a freezed not updated  state since 3 weeks allready hehehe
2016-09-09 10:05:15	leebre	i would say arch is really better, yes
2016-09-09 10:05:27	rghvdberg	can we proove it ?
2016-09-09 10:05:35	leebre	i could give now hundred arguments, tell me which argument are interrestingto you
2016-09-09 10:05:43	rghvdberg	is it faster
2016-09-09 10:05:45	leebre	i can proove
2016-09-09 10:05:49	leebre	its faster
2016-09-09 10:05:51	leebre	yes
2016-09-09 10:05:52	rghvdberg	how much
2016-09-09 10:06:14	yann-kaelig	JackWinter, I don't know, the screen freeze, I thought that firefox again freeze the nouveau driver, but when I trie to reboot the computer start but no more usb supplied and video
2016-09-09 10:06:33	leebre	phew..you start with a small corebase and install then the desktop.....you only have the packages you are really needing , that makes it maybe allready a lil faster
2016-09-09 10:07:01	rghvdberg	I really suspect there's a lot of placebo effect in there
2016-09-09 10:07:18	rghvdberg	because you built it yourself it must be faster so it feels faster
2016-09-09 10:07:26	leebre	most important argument for me: arch is quite self explaining, once you got it, you can switch to freebsd and find it as easy as arch, thats what i am thinkin
2016-09-09 10:08:02	rghvdberg	my pc has a goal, my pc itself is not the goal ...
2016-09-09 10:08:05	JackWinter	so does it start at all?
2016-09-09 10:08:10	leebre	i dont measure my boot times or so, but i know i am doin music with -n2 -p16 without any xrun....do you ?
2016-09-09 10:08:11	rghvdberg	I slap a distro on it and do work
2016-09-09 10:08:33	rghvdberg	I have a different pc so it says nothing
2016-09-09 10:09:37	JackWinter	 -p16 -n2 would trump boot time anyday in my book ;)
2016-09-09 10:09:43	yann-kaelig	JackWinter, it start but i have no video at boot, the lcd has no input, and keyboard is not longer suplied
2016-09-09 10:09:54	rghvdberg	I don't care about boot times :-)
2016-09-09 10:10:05	leebre	I don't care about boot times ;)

2016-09-09 10:10:38	leebre	see, let me guess, you are not using arch ...
2016-09-09 10:10:52	rghvdberg	no ... arch is scary don't you know that ?
2016-09-09 10:11:28	rghvdberg	no, my days of 'computing' are over. don't have the time/need to just fiddle with and trying stuff
2016-09-09 10:11:29	leebre	its not scary at all,its easy, self explaining, logial, quite posix
2016-09-09 10:11:45	leebre	me too, no time anymore
2016-09-09 10:11:57	rghvdberg	I have a buntu distro up and running in 20 min ...
2016-09-09 10:12:21	leebre	but i guess i have to  clean up a lil onelast time befor e freezing all machines
2016-09-09 10:12:25	rghvdberg	still puzzled about arch. does it compile all the stuff like gentoo ?
2016-09-09 10:12:30	leebre	no
2016-09-09 10:12:39	leebre	binary packages
2016-09-09 10:12:47	rghvdberg	ah ok
2016-09-09 10:12:51	leebre	but nice auto build system...
2016-09-09 10:13:22	rghvdberg	I did a Linux from scratch build a long time ago. actually very educating
2016-09-09 10:14:00	leebre	see
2016-09-09 10:14:10	rghvdberg	but I'll stay on Mint for a looonnnggg time. everything is peachy
2016-09-09 10:14:16	klopsi-u3	so arch is a bit like running debian sid?
2016-09-09 10:14:55	leebre	i feel switching to  linux was a great idea, choosing arch was the best for me, using openrc is out of debate for me
2016-09-09 10:15:13	leebre	no arch has nothing to do with sid
2016-09-09 10:15:20	rghvdberg	using linux since about 2007
2016-09-09 10:15:24	leebre	youare talking aboutz the freshness of the packages and the rolling release
2016-09-09 10:15:51	JackWinter	yann-kaelig: maybe there is a jumper to reset the bios?
2016-09-09 10:15:56	leebre	i used si and i did not like it toomuch
2016-09-09 10:15:59	leebre	sid
2016-09-09 10:16:04	JackWinter	though it sounds like something happened to it.
2016-09-09 10:16:51	JackWinter	you can also try to remove all cards and connectors, ram modules, and if you are adventurous reseat the cpu too.  maybe it helps
2016-09-09 10:16:56	klopsi-u3	my first was slackware
2016-09-09 10:16:57	klopsi-u3	then redhat
2016-09-09 10:17:12	klopsi-u3	20 years ago
2016-09-09 10:18:24	rghvdberg	just googled it .. feisty fawn ubuntu 7.04 was my first ubuntu .. before that I used some other distro's

2016-09-09 10:18:37		[10:18]
2016-09-09 10:19:01	rghvdberg	also tried fedora + CCRMA ..then I learned about ubuntu studio
2016-09-09 10:19:03	JackWinter	yes, if it's connected..
2016-09-09 10:19:06	leebre	normally, hardware doent just break, my experiences....heat can change things....or mechanical force.....
2016-09-09 10:19:25	JackWinter	i think if i didn't run arch, i'd probably run fedora..
2016-09-09 10:19:41	leebre	if its not connected, it canbe very easily connected...two lines, polarity not important
2016-09-09 10:19:53	leebre	really ????
2016-09-09 10:19:58	leebre	red hat fedora
2016-09-09 10:19:58	JackWinter	sure it does.  a power surge, some importan capacitor, power supply, etc
2016-09-09 10:20:22	klopsi-u3	my 1986 80c88 still runs
2016-09-09 10:20:33	JackWinter	yes, that's a serious company compared to canonical and co ;)
2016-09-09 10:20:36	leebre	since more then ten years, the expoding electrolyt capacitor problems are solvd, or ?
2016-09-09 10:20:59	JackWinter	they say, but there are still many in stock.
2016-09-09 10:21:16	leebre	you can see, if a capacitor exploded....
2016-09-09 10:21:29	JackWinter	i'm on my second sammsung monitor that has started going out.  think i'll need to buy a new monitor when i get back home
2016-09-09 10:21:51	leebre	firstopen the pc, look if thereis dirt in it, carefully lookin if the fans are mowin after power on
2016-09-09 10:22:20	leebre	if fans are not movin , we have found the problem hehehe, or at least one symptome
2016-09-09 10:22:43	leebre	really??
2016-09-09 10:22:50	JackWinter	that's normally a capacitor problem.  in fact when i opened up the last one, i noticed that the heatsink of a voltage stabilizer was epoxied to some caps.  if i was a cynical guy, i'd think that was done on purpose for it to break after a couple of years..
2016-09-09 10:22:52	klopsi-u3	yah fans sigh

2016-09-09 10:24:37	klopsi-u3	i have a samsung from 2008
2016-09-09 10:24:50	leebre	you can buy servermothetrboards fro gigabyte or intel...these are technical the same boards sometimes like normal desktop mobos but with long life support of the parts built in...these have 5 or 6 years warranty and should live forever
2016-09-09 10:25:00	leebre	prices for these mobos are eternal, too
2016-09-09 10:28:30	yann-kaelig	JackWinter, nothing this is the end of my motherboard, hope that do not affect something else

2016-09-09 11:01:32	JackWinter	yann-kaelig: did you reseat every connector, ram, cards, etc?
2016-09-09 11:02:03	leebre	i am really apreciating help but help can also be irritatin....i think i donthave a problem here,instead, i am readin that ffado,specially dbus-c++ is said by others to beproblematic...and what a coincidence....this is what breaking dependancies....
2016-09-09 11:02:16	leebre	zebra is a synth for linux
2016-09-09 11:02:18	JackWinter	i used to build/repair PCs and in suprisingly many cases that simple maneuver made broken machines work again
2016-09-09 11:02:29	leebre	yes
2016-09-09 11:02:47	klopsi-u3	it's only your privelege that let you repair PCs
2016-09-09 11:03:05	JackWinter	i think sometimes a some vital connection gets coroded with time, and doing the above cleans them so that it works again
2016-09-09 11:03:11	leebre	because things can shift some milimiters, just by time, or by changing temperatures of the year seasons...or a lil mechanical bump...
2016-09-09 11:03:45	leebre	yeah, copper can get oxidized....gold plated connectors wont...
2016-09-09 11:04:02	JackWinter	the reason that the when we hit machines out of frustration, they suddenly start working again ;)
2016-09-09 11:04:15	leebre	hehehe
2016-09-09 11:04:32	yann-kaelig	JackWinter, the computer is working again, video and usb come back and i can boot into the bios. but there is something not good for sure with the motherboard
2016-09-09 11:04:35	leebre	that what black boxes are doin: they will allways suprise us
2016-09-09 11:04:50	JackWinter	the fast way, lift the entire machine 3-4cm up and let it fall down again ;)

2016-09-10 04:15:02	bluebell	rncbc: I'll buy a new PC next year and will have new libs then :)

2016-09-10 10:24:47	holstein	"good" is *always* relative
2016-09-10 10:25:09	holstein	i use av, and its great at what it does.. i say, if you are wanting more of an "as-is" appliance, made for audio production, its a win
2016-09-10 10:25:45	holstein	if you want a more rolling release type thing, with updates coming in, kxstudio is hard to beat.. not that im suggesting its a rolling release..  just that falktx keeps things up to date in it
2016-09-10 10:26:06	yann-kaelig	holstein, all is usable out of the box ? no need of any sort of configuration  ?
2016-09-10 10:26:06		[10:26]
2016-09-10 10:26:21	holstein	id say, the "best" distro, for anything, is just the one that the specific individual is most comfortable with
2016-09-10 10:26:33	holstein	all the tools, are basically the same, and in most major repos..
2016-09-10 10:26:33	contrapunctus	(and with Debian Testing + KX repos, it can be rolling release...just not for the audio bits though ;)
2016-09-10 10:26:54	holstein	yann-kaelig: again, its all about the end user.. it'll be more about do *you* need to 'configure' something to fit your needs
2016-09-10 10:27:04	yann-kaelig	holstein, yep, right hta why I choice funtoo ^^ but I'm always curious about how binary distro are built for Audio prod
2016-09-10 10:27:04	holstein	AV, out of the box, is meant for audio production..
2016-09-10 10:27:12	holstein	its free to download, and easy to try live..
2016-09-10 10:27:35	holstein	i always found it educational to download, and look at, even before i was using it on the audio production machine
2016-09-10 10:27:41	bluebell	I guess jackd hast to be configured in every distribution. It can't know which audio interface it should use
2016-09-10 10:28:25	yann-kaelig	bluebell, yea, I think the problem is alsa, even the devs tell me tht alsa is not so well written ;p
2016-09-10 10:29:05	holstein	well, *i* have no problems with alsa
2016-09-10 10:29:26	holstein	if you have hardware, that is not working well with linux, you cant "fix" that with another distro
2016-09-10 10:32:45	bluebell	yann-kaelig: It's always the same: you can't just buy a device and hope that it works with Linux. There's always a bit of research needed
2016-09-10 10:33:03	bluebell	yann-kaelig: it's the same with printers and graphics cards
2016-09-10 10:33:30	holstein	for me, i need to *see* it, in action, in linux.. for myself. i like to make sure i can return the thing, or try it in the store..
2016-09-10 10:33:56	holstein	even if someone else says it works, its still not their burden to support it, and, it could be a kernel regression, or who knows..
2016-09-10 10:34:04	yann-kaelig	is it possible to connect in parallel with jack two audio card and output audio simultaneously ?
2016-09-10 10:34:14	holstein	nothing about linux is preventing that
2016-09-10 10:34:26	holstein	but, its just not a good idea.. regardless of the OS..
2016-09-10 10:34:39	holstein	you'll want..
2016-09-10 10:34:45	holstein	.g 2 audio devices alsa ardour
2016-09-10 10:34:47	osmpbot	holstein: [ https://community.ardour.org/node/13038 ] Ardour 4 - use 2 soundcards parallel | ardour
2016-09-10 10:35:15	holstein	you'll basically, have 2 "supported" devices, and set them up as one, to alsa, and run jack on that device..
2016-09-10 10:36:22	holstein	i would suggest, getting a "nice" interface, that does what you want/need.. one can certainly cobble together cards, but, it wont be the same as a nice multichannel interface.. and these days, they are so reasonably priced.. behringer makes nice USB ones with 2/4/8, etc.. ins/outs..
2016-09-10 10:38:37	holstein	a hundred for http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/UMC404HD, new.. thats just hard to beat, and, hard to justify cobbling, and hacking, for something that can never compare, in features..

2016-09-11 10:51:53	holstein	i like it a little brighter, dmbaturin
2016-09-11 10:52:56	holstein	much better phrasing on the solo, as well..
2016-09-11 10:53:38	dmbaturin	I kinda admitted defeat and kept the solo to one chorus, lol. I need to work on keeping it any coherent but not repetitive for more than one...
2016-09-11 10:54:25	holstein	nothing wrong with repeating..
2016-09-11 10:54:31	dmbaturin	I'm kinda tempted to call it a release, despite rather uneven time.
2016-09-11 10:54:36	holstein	yeah..
2016-09-11 10:54:47	holstein	nah.. its not "uneven", really.. its still just disagreeing with its self
2016-09-11 10:54:55	holstein	but, it has a nice feel to it..
2016-09-11 10:55:51	holstein	dmbaturin: you should try singing it, with the timing, spelled out..
2016-09-11 10:56:01	dmbaturin	I guess it was written a bit beyond my means, as arranger and performer.
2016-09-11 10:56:16	holstein	" & 2 & 3 & 4 &.. &... &.. & 2 & 3 & 4 &... &.. &..
2016-09-11 10:56:51	dmbaturin	Let me make another take I think.
2016-09-11 10:56:58	holstein	those "&'s", in a row, are really a chance to lay back, and also, you can make the last one, in the sequence short, or more staccato
2016-09-11 10:57:33	willer	is there an alternative to pulseaudio-eq? i'm using bitwig-studio-demo for a system-wide eq atm and it's a bit cumbersome but the eq-5 is pretty nice
2016-09-11 10:59:21	holstein	dmbaturin: let me give you an example.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h3F8GLz0q0#t=1m24s

2016-09-11 10:59:57	holstein	dmbaturin: you can check that whole track out, for a lesson on "laying back".. and check out, how the horn section, is, as a group, laying back, and playing *very* behind the beat, and making the swing feel and groove happen
2016-09-11 11:00:40	holstein	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h3F8GLz0q0#t=2m06s is another spot where they are doing this quite extreme..
2016-09-11 11:00:40	osmpbot	[URL] Charles Mingus - REINCARNATION OF A LOVEBIRD - YouTube
2016-09-11 11:00:59	holstein	anyways.. you are *always* up in front of the beat. which is fine.. but, it would be nice to have both
2016-09-11 11:01:40	holstein	willer: a hardware piece outside the box.. but, a jack host can host the EQ plugin of your choice..
2016-09-11 11:02:12	holstein	id say, look in the player, for example, in vlc.. if you dont need it to be "system-wide". or, look at why you are needing to EQ system-wide, like that..
2016-09-11 11:03:09	dmbaturin	holstein: For this one I came to conclusion that I want it ahead, but let me try something and see if I like that feel better.
2016-09-11 11:03:13	willer	holstein: i need system wide for these bookshelve speakers. they do output decent bass @ about 40hz but it needs EQ
2016-09-11 11:03:13		[11:03]
2016-09-11 11:03:37	holstein	dmbaturin: sure. it just *always* feels anxious, to me.. it feels uncertain, and anxious. never, comfortable and grooving..
2016-09-11 11:04:04	willer	holstein: can you give me an exmaple of a jack host running an eq? not sure how to install that / get it running
2016-09-11 11:04:11	holstein	not that there is anything wrong with that. and i actually *dont* feel that you are making a conscious choice to put the notes where they are..
2016-09-11 11:04:49	dmbaturin	Well, quite often I'm not I guess.
2016-09-11 11:04:54	holstein	willer: you can use an AVlinux live iso, and see *all* the software, basically, that is available to a linux audio workstation
2016-09-11 11:05:13	dmbaturin	As in it doesn't always end up as I intended.
2016-09-11 11:05:18	holstein	there are *many* simple EQ's.. but, again, i wouldnt expect a plugin to make speakers sound better
2016-09-11 11:05:47	holstein	anyways.. most players have a simple EQ onboard..

2016-09-11 11:06:33	dmbaturin	Clementine has pretty nice EQ, with profiles etc.
2016-09-11 11:06:59	holstein	willer: go for it, friend. if you use JACK, you can use *any* EQ from the linux ecosystem, that is intended to EQ.. but, its not intended to "fix shitty speakers"
2016-09-11 11:06:59	dmbaturin	As in you can save custom EQ profiles and switch them easily.
2016-09-11 11:07:02	holstein	thats goiing to be your issue
2016-09-11 11:07:23	holstein	expecting to dial up an EQ, and make tiny, cheap speakers, on a bookshelf, sound like they are producing bass, if they cant

2016-09-11 11:07:54	holstein	otherwise, there are *many* EQ's, and i say, fire up a simple one.. like the one in clementine, ^ and see if you can get the sound you want
2016-09-11 11:08:08	holstein	if so, you can consider something more system wide, or, outside the box..
2016-09-11 11:08:28	willer	holstein: i'm thinking about upgrading my speakers all the time :) these speakers do produce bass if it's EQ'd out
2016-09-11 11:08:43	holstein	cool!.. again, enjoy!
2016-09-11 11:09:00	holstein	if you find, you are trying to solve a hardware problem, with software, we can talk about that

2016-09-11 11:09:47	willer	i'm going to move in a few months so i can't really make any decisions on speakers before that. i'd lovce to have a nice balanced setup with a subwoofer but until then...EQ
2016-09-11 11:10:16	willer	did he get mad?
2016-09-11 11:10:24	dmbaturin	willer: Depends, sometimes the issue is not only that some bands are overemphasized by speakers, but that it's at cost of underemphasizing other bands. In this case software EQ may not get the bands it's bad at back.
2016-09-11 11:11:19	willer	dmbaturin: this is just to enjoy music and not for any procuctive purpåoses
2016-09-11 11:11:31	willer	typos everywhere
2016-09-11 11:12:17	dmbaturin	Well, I've had really sucky headphones a few times where software EQ could solve the overemphasized bass issue, but did nothing to poor response at higher frequencies.
2016-09-11 11:14:49	willer	"if you find, you are trying to solve a hardware problem, with software, we can talk about that"
2016-09-11 11:14:58	willer	that is exactly what i'm doing
2016-09-11 11:15:46	willer	oh well. so, how do i run an eq on a jack host? i'm not sure how to google that
2016-09-11 11:16:08	willer	and by "jack host" what did he mean?
2016-09-11 11:16:25	willer	i'm pretty new to audio stuff in general
2016-09-11 11:17:38	dmbaturin	willer: A plugin host that works with JACK.
2016-09-11 11:17:54	dmbaturin	If it's for listening, it's not what you want though.
2016-09-11 11:18:45	willer	can you give me an example of a plugin host?
2016-09-11 11:18:45		[11:18]
2016-09-11 11:18:59	dmbaturin	In a plugin host, you can run plugins (EQ, compressors, whatever) and route audio signal through them. You technically can route it to a player, but it's an overkill. It's only relevant for audio production.
2016-09-11 11:19:17	dmbaturin	willer: Carla is a popular plugin host.
2016-09-11 11:20:06	willer	looks like i need to install it, it's not bundled with cadence it seems
2016-09-11 11:21:40	willer	"overkill" is subjective :)
2016-09-11 11:21:56	willer	compiling carla
2016-09-11 11:22:51	dmbaturin	You'll need a player that works with JACK. Or use a JACK bridge.
2016-09-11 11:23:04	willer	running bitwig to eq is overkill, that i admit
2016-09-11 11:23:21	willer	i'm using a jack bridge
2016-09-11 11:23:27	dmbaturin	Clementine's EQ will do the trick if it can. If it can't, nothing will. ;)
2016-09-11 11:23:50	willer	i thought clementine wasn't developed any more
2016-09-11 11:24:07	willer	i dropped it a long time ago
2016-09-11 11:24:30	dmbaturin	It's still maintained.
2016-09-11 11:25:14	dmbaturin	Even if it's no longer "developed" I'm fine with it because, well, it's got everything it needs. There isn't much to add.
2016-09-11 11:25:34	willer	ok got carla. can you give me an EQ that looks nice and is really good? :)
2016-09-11 11:26:02	dmbaturin	CALF and guitarix both have multi-band EQ plugins.
2016-09-11 11:26:14	willer	i use cmus...i mostly listen to internet radio
2016-09-11 11:26:38	willer	ok cool, got calf installed already. how do i get this running?
2016-09-11 11:27:13	dmbaturin	Read carla's docs? ;)
2016-09-11 11:27:21	willer	sure
2016-09-11 11:27:48	dmbaturin	I don't even do it myself normally, I load the plugins into ardour instead.
2016-09-11 11:27:59	willer	No manual entry for carla
2016-09-11 11:28:01	willer	damn!

2016-09-12 02:36:33	leetographic	as is tryin to do professional music production aint hard enough, if done right, i am teaming up which brings further "overhead", ...doin it completly with opensource, though i ve never knew how much opensource msucians also try to do cc stuff

2016-09-12 02:37:56	leetographic	do we work for many and produce cc content at nights, or do we believein it and only producing cc and probably stayin poor a lil longer, which would be maybe also the case when selling commercially

2016-09-12 03:39:03	JazzyEagle	leetographic: Sometimes there are delays when there are problems with testing.  Perhaps they identified a snafu in the installation process?
2016-09-12 03:39:22	JazzyEagle	Or library issues...

2016-09-12 03:39:44	JazzyEagle	I'm theorizing why the repo hasn't been updated yet.

2016-09-12 03:43:01	frinknet	Sorry we never got that gig rolling with Mix-a-Lot - I haven't talked to him in a while but he ended up going with a more local company. Haven't heard whether he got the product to production or not.
2016-09-12 03:43:31	wrl	nah, s'alright dude. hope it works out, the space is certainly ripe.
2016-09-12 03:43:37	frinknet	JazzyEagle: yes. I got a new laptop and forgot to have IRC logged in. Work is rolling along bu the studio is close to opening.
2016-09-12 03:44:43	JazzyEagle	Coolies.  :)
2016-09-12 03:44:59	dmbaturin	frinknet: Hhm. What exactly is wrong on the laptop speakers? I'm still rather new to mixing and audio tech in general, so if you have any suggestions how to improve it, I'll be glad to hear.
2016-09-12 03:45:24	frinknet	I need a new USB interface. I'm looking at the Behringer X Air X18. Any other contenders with similar throughput I should be thinking about?
2016-09-12 03:45:52	wrl	frinknet: what's your budget and i/o requirements?
2016-09-12 03:48:22	frinknet	dmbaturin: It's just boosting the frequency in a rather unpleasant way. You know how sometimes highhats, guitars and vocals can get to you if not mixed right? It's usually around 3k where the mudding happens. Yours sounded a little lower than 3k but I'm guessing that my speakers weren't accurate and it is really about there.

2016-09-12 03:53:07		[03:53]
2016-09-12 03:53:20	frinknet	JazzyEagle: As OSM goes we should probably talk more about diy.re and what they are doing. Great company. Open source music hardware is even more rare than software.
2016-09-12 03:55:24	JazzyEagle	That looks cool, but I don't know how much of a DIY guy I am...
2016-09-12 03:55:42	dmbaturin	frinknet: Whats's the usual solution? Turn that range down in the EQ?
2016-09-12 03:57:06	frinknet	dmbaturin: Yes basically you use a parametric EQ to highlight the offending frequency. You move it around until you hear something you just can't stand. Then you dial it back to a more healthy level.
2016-09-12 03:58:26	frinknet	See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xTXEDxfJwA and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K133DdB-CQ

2016-09-12 03:59:19	osmpbot	[URL]
2016-09-12 04:00:29	frinknet	The whole idea of the colour format is to only include the part of circuitry that adds color to the mix. Then you use your DAW normally but you get more colored input so less time spent tweaking the sounds.
2016-09-12 04:00:43	JazzyEagle	Interesting...
2016-09-12 04:01:26	frinknet	Yes. It took me a while to understand the concept and I had to re-read the design spec a couple of times.
2016-09-12 04:02:25	-->	fdcx (357@ceata/consiliu/FDCX) has joined #opensourcemusicians
2016-09-12 04:02:38	JazzyEagle	So how exactly do these work?  I see the circuit boards they're showing, but I don't see connectors...  Would this Pentode color be designed to be a hardware effect, or is it more like a tube amp that I'd plug a guitar directly into?
2016-09-12 04:02:47	frinknet	Basically each POT is a dual pot that is increasingthe gain going in and decreasing it when it comes out so that you can decide how much you want to drive each circuit.
2016-09-12 04:03:19	wrl	JazzyEagle: the color modules are put into a board that has space for them, and then the board is generally mounted inside whatever it's designed to be mounted in
2016-09-12 04:03:22	wrl	a concrete example:
2016-09-12 04:03:40	wrl	there's a board that has space for 3 colour modules, and then mounts in a 500 series rack
2016-09-12 04:03:52	wrl	it's cool if you have a 500 series rack thing
2016-09-12 04:03:54	wrl	not cool if you don't
2016-09-12 04:04:56	JazzyEagle	Yeah, this seems like way out of my league.  As cool as it is to have open hardware...  It's way out of my league.
2016-09-12 04:05:21	frinknet	WRL: I don't have a 500 series rack - I'm looking to build a full rack version with 5 slots using their design specs
2016-09-12 04:05:52	frinknet	It helps that my Dad is an electrical engineer. :-)
2016-09-12 04:06:56	frinknet	JazzyEagle: I've been watching this format mature over the last year or so. I think their could be a lot of promise in a change of workflow.
2016-09-12 04:07:17	JazzyEagle	it seems like a cool concept, but I don't want to be soldering my own boards and what not.
2016-09-12 04:07:42	frinknet	JazzyEagle: if you think that is intimidating - take a lok at the wiki. There is about 500+ projects where you can build your own gear
2016-09-12 04:07:43	JazzyEagle	If the boards were pre-made, and it was a simple matter of plugging in the boards I wanted, I could handle that.
2016-09-12 04:08:00	JazzyEagle	frinknet: Building my own gear in general sounds intimidating.
2016-09-12 04:09:05	frinknet	So does compiling your own gear when you first start ;-)
2016-09-12 04:09:05		[04:09]

2016-09-12 04:10:09	JazzyEagle	But, at the same time, my time is rather limited these days, and so I need to choose what I want to spend my time doing, and building my own gear just doesn't sound like something I'd want to spend my time doing.
2016-09-12 04:10:59	frinknet	Sure. You've gotta decide whether you would enjoy slaving at the job for a few more hours to save the money for the gear or tinkering to build it.
2016-09-12 04:11:16	JazzyEagle	lol
2016-09-12 04:11:33	JazzyEagle	at this point, I slave at two jobs to pay the bills.  Gear doesn't factor into it at all.

2016-09-12 06:33:32	osmpbot	[URL] Disconest - Musical metadata for your Records
2016-09-12 06:34:10	holstein	an interesting thing to think about is, the F# B cluster, that can be part of that entire progression
2016-09-12 06:34:34	holstein	you just have 3 chords repeating.. *some* kind of A, some kind of E, and some kind of B..
2016-09-12 06:35:05	holstein	its tricky, when, we are in the key of B, as in, B is the tonic, but, you have this "flat 7", or bVII chord, right off
2016-09-12 06:35:35	holstein	that throws the simple diatonic concepts right off.. which is not a problem..
2016-09-12 06:36:33	holstein	anyways.. wheres the original track?
2016-09-12 06:36:42	dmbaturin	Checking metadata for a recording to find out information about a different recording is... not very reliable. :)
2016-09-12 06:39:16	dmbaturin	Anyway, key is one thing (you can hear that B is the tonic, and you can call it the key), but it doesn't necessarily define one scale to play over the whole thing.

2016-09-12 06:40:45	holstein	well, i think its good to look at it from all perspectives, though.. like, *why* we think B is the tonic..
2016-09-12 06:41:21	holstein	somtimes, i'll kind of "solve" it like an equation, with a student.. its easier, when there are just the 3 chords.. but, if one is hung up there, as to which is the tonic, we can try them all, and see which makes more sense
2016-09-12 06:41:37	holstein	but, i agree, it "feels" like B is the tonic, in this case..
2016-09-12 06:42:13	holstein	still, we dont have a strong V I, we have, a bVII acting as sub-dominant, and a IV as the dominant.. to the tonic
2016-09-12 06:42:26	holstein	so, its quite "uncommon", in a quirky, cool way

2016-09-12 06:45:30	holstein	this "cluster" is important in the voicing, from the A to the E chord.. the upper voices moving from C#/F#, to B/F#
2016-09-12 06:47:51	yottanami	Yes I see
2016-09-12 06:48:00	yottanami	Thanks for helps
2016-09-12 06:48:33	holstein	i came in late, and just saw something interesting, that i wanted to join in about..
2016-09-12 06:48:45	yottanami	I am newbie in harmony where can I find out more information about Rock/Metal chord progration?
2016-09-12 06:48:55	holstein	but, if you are having issues hearing the notes, thinking of it basically like a small choir may help..
2016-09-12 06:49:06	dmbaturin	Well, there is no specific rock harmony.
2016-09-12 06:49:17	holstein	see if you can find that top voice, and bass voice, and see where they "move" from there
2016-09-12 06:49:41	holstein	sometimes, they can split into 2 voices, or come back together.. but, identifying what you *can* hear, and going from there can help
2016-09-12 06:49:51	holstein	and yes.. the notes are the notes.. regardless of style
2016-09-12 06:49:58	dmbaturin	yottanami: Someone stole Berkeley books. http://davidvaldez.blogspot.ru/2006/04/berklee-jazz-harmony-1-4.html
2016-09-12 06:49:59	osmpbot	[URL] Casa Valdez Studios: Berklee Jazz Harmony 1-4
2016-09-12 06:50:25	holstein	you can see *less* information, with "metal" for example.. like, just a power chord.. we think this should be easier, as in, less notes.. but, its actually more vague, as well
2016-09-12 06:50:34	dmbaturin	Shameless bastard! Anyway, if you want something brief and not delving into voice leading considerations, it's a good book, moral implications of downloading it aside.
2016-09-12 06:51:04	holstein	for example, if i see a dominant 7th chord.. a G7, for example, i can assume, that 99% of the time, that is functioning as a dominant chord in C.. this can help give me some helpful context clues
2016-09-12 06:51:26	dmbaturin	Classical textbooks are good, but tend to spend a lot of time on things that are, for better or worse, almost unused in rock.
2016-09-12 06:51:26	holstein	in metal, where, all we have is the root and 5th, typically, for harmonic substance, you may not have that context to assist
2016-09-12 06:52:39	holstein	thinking of it as a language, and looking at the specifics, such as, simple scale types, and how to construct them.. how are chords made? and spelled, etc..
2016-09-12 06:53:12	dmbaturin	Hard rock/metal tend to be almost modal (clear tonal center and residual functional harmony).
2016-09-12 06:54:20	holstein	and, i think we could get into a talk about what "clear" is to you, vs, me
2016-09-12 06:54:41	holstein	as in, i may not agree that, leaving out extensions makes something more "clear"
2016-09-12 06:55:00	holstein	but, it certainly has less notes in it.. which, i can see why one would make a case for that being more clear
2016-09-12 06:55:24	dmbaturin	holstein: Well, I'm only saying that it's usually clear where the tonal center is.
2016-09-12 06:55:49	holstein	but, i like to think about it in context, as well. i if play a melody of 2 notes.. C and G.. and we may say, "well, thats clearly in C, now that thats the root and 5th".. but, thats not always the case
2016-09-12 06:57:03	holstein	could be, those notes have the "identity", clearly as being the root and 5th.. but, it could also be, the harmony is more in Amin7, and the C and G is the 3rd, and 7th
2016-09-12 06:57:52	holstein	and, the answer is, we dont have enough context, from just the 2 notes C and G, to say.. though, we can, again, "solve" it a bit like an equation, and look at what identity C and G can have in *every* chord
2016-09-12 06:58:54	holstein	like, over Bb.. having the 9 and 6
2016-09-12 06:58:54		[06:58]
2016-09-12 06:59:36	holstein	i think, this concept can help develop an ear for it, rather than always just pressing play on something, and not being able to hear the language
2016-09-12 07:00:09	holstein	we can work at it the other way.. what does a 3rd sound like? how to i make a 3rd? how to i spell a 3rd? whats the difference in a major 3rd and minor 3rd? etc
2016-09-12 07:00:37	holstein	if we take time, and work that out, *before* pressing play on the thing we are trying to hear, we can have a better chance of hearing those things..

2016-09-12 08:32:46	dmbaturin	Yeah, I messed it up there. I need to listen carefully to what Miles does a few more times.
2016-09-12 08:32:56	holstein	also, you are leaving a piece of the tune off, at the end
2016-09-12 08:33:45	dmbaturin	Yeah, I'll make a new take in a bit. Just making sure what I do is not _entirely_ wrong, Straight, No Chaser flashbacks are still haunting me. :)

2016-09-12 09:40:40	eenixon	first-timer: a question about running KXStudio on powerpc -- is this possible. In particular I've been looking for Cadence to manage the traffic jam in audio.
2016-09-12 09:41:18	dmbaturin	I don't think they do PPC builds.
2016-09-12 09:42:11	eenixon	I don't see anything explicit on the web site but some but not all of the packages are 'uninstallable' for various reasons.
2016-09-12 09:42:35	dmbaturin	Well, some packages are installable because they are arch-independent.
2016-09-12 09:43:08	eenixon	And I guess you could try to compile your own but would likely fun into major complications.

2016-09-12 09:45:10	dmbaturin	Well, KXStudio doesn't have any magic audio sauce in it. It's a convenient way to get everything setup, on supported platforms. I use fedora, for instance, and it has most of what I need in the repos.

I did the alsa_out -d (with the device name) and it seems to work, except I get no sound out of the alsa ports created. Any suggestions are appreciated, thanks!

2016-09-12 09:55:44	wolftune	you need to make sure the device has the right settings and isn't muted etc
2016-09-12 09:56:21	wolftune	otherwise, needs the right connections of course… I could check it out and see, not sure

2016-09-12 16:32:50	dmbaturin	Well, at least I seemingly succeeded at not being way too ahead of the beat, lol.
2016-09-12 16:33:19	holstein	i cant quite make out the harmony, against the melody, either
2016-09-12 16:33:29	holstein	if you're hearing it, thats all that matters..
2016-09-12 16:34:42	dmbaturin	I think it's funny how ambiguous it is there, but maybe I should make it less ambiguous.
2016-09-12 16:34:54	dmbaturin	Would it be annoying for the listener?
2016-09-12 16:35:17	holstein	"jazz" is something that most dont listen to, because they find it annoying, or whatever
2016-09-12 16:35:25	holstein	i say, just make sure *you* are meaning what you say
2016-09-12 16:35:42	holstein	if you want to set out to make an ambiguous irony piece, thats not landing as that, for me
2016-09-12 16:36:06	holstein	but, its your thing, and if you are hearing it, i dont find it "annoying".. it sounds more like, a backing track, and a melody, that are not in agreement

2016-09-12 16:37:44	dmbaturin	Well, if it sounds like they don't agree, it's definitely something to fix.
2016-09-12 16:38:58	holstein	could be, the color tones are just making it seem like different harmony to me than you are intending..
2016-09-12 16:39:37	dmbaturin	Maybe I should just switch the harmony to minor blues instead. Then it should agree with the head I think.
2016-09-12 16:45:00		[16:39]
2016-09-12 16:56:24	dmbaturin	Or cut down on color tones.

2016-09-12 17:28:26	dmbaturin	The only good thing is that coming up with some bullshit to play over chords is not that much of a daunting task for me anymore. Coming up with lines at least I would find acceptable still is.
2016-09-12 17:34:00		[17:28]
2016-09-12 18:27:34	holstein	dmbaturin: that sounds more clear to me..
2016-09-12 18:27:34		[18:27]
2016-09-12 18:31:32	dmbaturin	I guess I'll keep it that way then. Though, are there any examples of minor blues other than Mr PC and Equinox?
2016-09-12 18:31:44	holstein	sure
2016-09-12 18:32:03	holstein	but, one of the issues is, the minor 3rd, in the "blues" scale.. the #9, or whatever

2016-09-12 18:32:19	holstein	the "blues" really isnt necessarily major or minor, on some level
2016-09-12 18:32:32	holstein	but, there are quite a few, with the harmony being clearly minor
2016-09-12 18:34:20	holstein	theres this kind of thing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6dBjyj5gBM

2016-09-12 18:34:51	holstein	which, leads to all that "stray cats strut" kind of minor blues

2016-09-12 18:36:57	dmbaturin	Oh, well, good point. Footprints is is minor blues for some definition of minor blues too.
2016-09-12 18:37:32	holstein	you can hear django, there.. way on top of the beat, all the time as well
2016-09-12 18:37:36	holstein	but, never *too* far past it
2016-09-12 18:37:56	holstein	and you can hear, when, and why he plays shorter, staccato notes, and how that helps make it swing
2016-09-12 18:43:00		[18:37]
2016-09-12 18:47:25	dmbaturin	I guess now when I'm a bit better at hitting somewhat right notes I should pay more attention to articulation indeed.
2016-09-12 18:48:10	holstein	well, its all part of the package
2016-09-12 18:48:31	holstein	you cant just plod along, playing "right notes", where you please ;)

2016-09-13 15:18:03	nstewart	don't know for sure, but I noticed it shortly after getting off the highway - and I'm pretty sure it coincided -as my AC quit cooling a few minutes before.
2016-09-13 15:18:12	nstewart	on the highway there's enough airflow as long as water is moving
2016-09-13 15:18:35	nstewart	sorta put it together as they were towing it to the garage.

2016-09-14 00:25:31	yottanami	I have a big directory of sound fonts and it is a little difficult to check different sounds in a software like linux sampler.Is there any software to preview the sounds faster and easier?
2016-09-14 00:27:14	klopsi-u3	lmms lets you click on a .wav or sf2 and hear it
2016-09-14 00:28:21	leebre	carla maybe
2016-09-14 00:30:23	leebre	or just use what you want to , where you are fast and comfortable, ....you can check the wav's directly, or flac or what ever sample files the sfz or sf2 is pointing to ( or is sf2 binary...mmm)

I'm used to use /usr/bin/alsa_out command to add outputs to jack's "juridiction", but pulseaudio-dlna creates pulseaudio outputs, not alsa outputs, any idea how i should proceed ?
2016-09-14 00:38:41	leebre	normally, i say normally, you dont get, lets say, 500 gb of sfz from some one, you get a free multisample, you download, try it out and if you like it, you keep is, ....has ever been this way til the days, internet wasnt really capable of this, the 56k t modem time, analog modem line...at that time you were happy about a german keys or keyboards magazine featuring nice samples on cd, sometimes
2016-09-14 00:39:15	leebre	you liked it , you put it in a directory

2016-09-14 05:45:43	frinknet	They are so hot you have to attenuate which makes signal to noise very high ratio. You attenuate the noise into oblivion.

2016-09-14 05:47:15	frinknet	These sound better than a fully restored original Telefunken U87 restored by the president of Blue mics (had a friend who is a producer at iHeartRadio - long story)... Anyway... Very excited about these miles.
2016-09-14 05:47:39	frinknet	when holstein gets here I'm gonna have to have him check it out. :-)
2016-09-14 05:47:50	wrl	nice :)
2016-09-14 05:47:56	wrl	i've been thinking about doing a ribbon mic build
2016-09-14 05:48:06	wrl	did a microphone-parts build early this year, very happy with it
2016-09-14 05:48:22	frinknet	Which one did you build?
2016-09-14 05:49:02	frinknet	I've been thinking about getting an MXL 990s and doing a capsule + capacitor swap
2016-09-14 05:49:29	wrl	i built the T12
2016-09-14 05:49:35	frinknet	Cool!
2016-09-14 05:49:43	wrl	sounds really good, quite a bit of character
2016-09-14 05:49:52	wrl	cuts through a mix very well
2016-09-14 05:50:00	frinknet	I've been looking at the new Aston Origin. I think I'm gonna get a couple of those next.
2016-09-14 05:50:34	frinknet	I would highly recommend Resto Mod.
2016-09-14 05:51:02	frinknet	These things sound like a pair of RCA 44s on steroids.
2016-09-14 05:51:25	wrl	aston origin look interesting
2016-09-14 05:51:43	wrl	jesus those are cheap
2016-09-14 05:51:47	frinknet	I may end up building a couple ribbons myself. Talking to Michael it seems there is a bit of finess

2016-09-14 05:52:29	frinknet	Listen to this without effects no compression!
2016-09-14 05:53:08	frinknet	It sounds like a TLM 102/103 with a high-end optical compressor
2016-09-14 05:53:48	frinknet	I think we have a new workhorse mic. I've not heard a bad profile of any of the tests anyone has posted
2016-09-14 05:53:51	wrl	damn
2016-09-14 05:54:05	wrl	man i guess the only question is origin or spirit
2016-09-14 05:54:05		[05:54]
2016-09-14 05:54:26	frinknet	The Spirit has a little more color
2016-09-14 05:54:31	wrl	hm
2016-09-14 05:54:41	wrl	i'd like to have at least one figure 8 mic for m/s
2016-09-14 05:54:50	frinknet	I don't like their fet as much as the DIY.RE stuff
2016-09-14 05:55:25	frinknet	I had some cheap Nady ribbons that I'm having Michael re-ribbon
2016-09-14 05:56:18	frinknet	He should have a demo pretty soon. He says that the new ribbon makes it sound pretty good. (And he has amazing ears for ribbons...)

2016-09-14 23:25:31	bartart3d	hi all, latest update of ardour causes problems here, I think I figured out what the problem is, don't know how to solve it though, I think it's a bug in the installer package.
2016-09-14 23:26:11	bartart3d	running from terminal I get this: /usr/bin/ardour: 50: exec: /opt/ardour/bin/ardour-5.3.4: not found
2016-09-14 23:26:33	bartart3d	I checked and the version installed is 5.3.5, so it can't be found indeed
2016-09-14 23:27:18	klopsi-u3	ah packaging error?
2016-09-14 23:28:14	klopsi-u3	you could probably make a symbolic link
2016-09-14 23:28:41	klopsi-u3	ln -s /opt/ardour/bin/ardour-5.3.5 /opt/ardour/bin/ardour-5.3.4
2016-09-14 23:31:46	bartart3d	yep, that worked :-)
2016-09-14 23:34:26	bartart3d	I think it must b a packaging error indeed

2016-09-14 23:55:48	jubo2	And the stupid fucker probably at this moment does not realize that where he hit me for the first time is in front of the north-eastern elevator and therefore CCTV
2016-09-14 23:56:31	jubo2	also: jubo2 got a job today!
2016-09-14 23:56:58	jubo2	So yesterday, get punch in face x 3, drink 21 beers and other mishaps
2016-09-14 23:57:15	jubo2	today: Juho lands a job. And in a field I am very good at.
2016-09-14 23:57:19	jubo2	This calls for beers.

2016-09-15 09:10:20	JackWinter	leetographic: yes, it's in -rt12, it was a slowdown in dcache which made tmpf painfully slow..
2016-09-15 09:11:10	JackWinter	i tried all the harddisk schedulers even tried realtime and priorities on the cfq, nothing helped.  just putting my audio on another disk did..

2016-10-01 19:42:42	wolftune	what is timidity? Why do I want it? Can I just make it go away and not lose anything?
2016-10-01 19:43:46	dmbaturin	wolftune: It's a synth. I think at least some programs may use it as default.
2016-10-01 19:44:01	wolftune	hmm, any idea which ones?
2016-10-01 19:44:22	wolftune	in my case, it keeps overloading upon awake from suspend, so I'm wondering about just getting rid of it
2016-10-01 19:44:35	dmbaturin	Not really. I think everything I've seen has it pluggable, either timidity or fluidsynth or something else.
2016-10-01 19:44:43	wolftune	I can get it to reset by stopping and starting the alsa-midi bridge
2016-10-01 19:44:54	dmbaturin	wolftune: Not sure. Maybe check in the package manager what depends on it?
2016-10-01 19:46:15	contrapunctus	wolftune: same here!
2016-10-01 19:47:23	contrapunctus	wolftune: Solfege has Timidty as a dependency, so last week I eventually resorted to purging both.

2016-10-01 19:49:05	wolftune	oh huh
2016-10-01 19:50:37	wolftune	trying removing of just timidity-daemon
2016-10-01 19:52:28	wolftune	but if that doesn't work, I'll remove solfege. I actually never use solfege, I just wanted it on hand to show to students
2016-10-01 19:52:45	dmbaturin	contrapunctus: Solfege was a nice idea, but it's still so fond of throwing exceptions at every step that it's nearly unusable.
2016-10-01 19:53:00	dmbaturin	Or at least it was last I checked.
2016-10-01 19:53:22	wolftune	thanks folks
