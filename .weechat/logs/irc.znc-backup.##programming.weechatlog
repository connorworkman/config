2016-10-08 11:35:47	sleezy21	I have a quick question regarding MATLab anyone willing to help ? I want to knwo how do I create a function file that takes a vector as an input argument , I'm really struggling with this . I want to evaluate a vector but the function only works when I put a scalar quantity meaning an individual element from my vector . I don't know if I'm making sense but I would appreciate some help
2016-10-08 11:35:47	sleezy21	regarding that . thanks
