2016-10-18 00:14:21	megaTherion	[09:50:47] its the only option if you want native access ^^ [09:50:47]

2016-10-18 00:14:21	High_Priest	[09:53:18] anyone here has any experience with sap hana on sles? specifically, with hw evaluation tool - it's failing for me for 16K block size - overwrite test. All other tests are much higher than minimal. Any ideas? [09:53:18]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	farhad	[09:56:55] jamesax: absolutely you are right. but i cant solve it. [09:56:55]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[09:57:21] DeaDSouL_: ntfs [09:57:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[09:57:37] DeaDSouL_: fat32 sucks bigtime [09:57:37]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[09:58:09] DeaDSouL_: no journal, 4gb file size limit, no sane permissions.... [09:58:09]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	megaTherion	[10:00:00] MrElendig: but I doubt that Mac OSX has native support... :) [10:00:00]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:00:12] megaTherion: that is not a problem [10:00:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	megaTherion	[10:00:25] depends [10:00:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:00:26] it is much less of a problem than the problems with fat32 [10:00:26]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	megaTherion	[10:00:54] *shrugs* one can argue, even ntfs is insufficient these days [10:00:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:01:22] "hmm, should I install fuse or should I use a fs that will eat my data, asuming I can even copy the data to it in ther first place?" [10:01:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	megaTherion	[10:01:46] ntfs eats data too :O [10:01:46]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:01:54] to much lesser extent [10:01:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	RayTracer	[10:02:00] High_Priest: I never did that test, but might 16k overwrite be slow because of large stripe size or readahead? (read >>16k, modify, write >>16k)? [10:02:00]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:02:24] also osX is getting ntfs support out of the box soon™ [10:02:24]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:03:09] rw that is, it already supports read only access out of the box [10:03:09]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	megaTherion	[10:05:35] MrElendig: how would that possible? [10:05:35]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:05:54] how could what be possible? [10:05:54]

2016-10-18 00:14:21	megaTherion	[10:07:06] MrElendig: getting native support for ntfs, wasnt there some license issue's? [10:07:06]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:07:22] megaTherion: apple happens to have a shitload of money [10:07:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	High_Priest	[10:07:42] RayTracer, don't know - read_ahead_kb is set to 4096 [10:07:42]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	High_Priest	[10:08:41] RayTracer, I see that default values usually are 128 or 512 [10:08:41]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	ShapeShifter499	[10:09:54] what program do you guys use if you want to upload to a cloud?    I'm trying to find a proper solution to upload files to amazon cloud encrypted while getting around the limit of 50GB per file.   I was looking at odrive since it has linux and amazon cloud support but I'm not sure if I can trust it. [10:09:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	megaTherion	[10:10:05] MrElendig: I know that, but in that case they could rather implement btrfs or whatever... ntfs stinks like rotten fish - that would also be funny because then MS would be the one who had to act [10:10:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:10:09] ShapeShifter499: scp [10:10:09]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:10:18] ShapeShifter499: or anything that does https [10:10:18]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	ShapeShifter499	[10:10:22] Oh and odrive because it includes support for splitting on files before upload [10:10:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:10:38] megaTherion: ntfs support would make them money, btrfs support would not [10:10:38]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	ShapeShifter499	[10:10:44] MrElendig: uh, I'm not sure how'd I use it with amazon cloud [10:10:44]

2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:12:39] or did you actually mean the horrible cloud drive? [10:12:39]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	farciarz84	[10:12:40] hi, what's better to serve large files: sftp or nginx and http download? [10:12:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	ShapeShifter499	[10:12:45] MrElendig: oh no I'm talking about the "Amazon Cloud Drive" [10:12:45]

2016-10-18 00:14:21	megaTherion	[10:13:21] MrElendig: as you said, they already have a shitload of money... maybe there are other interests which weight higher [10:13:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:13:32] ShapeShifter499: people have written scripts, fuse filesystems etc for it [10:13:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:13:52] megaTherion: they have said that they will add rw ntfs support [10:13:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:14:01] megaTherion: because it lets them compete better with MS [10:14:01]

The workaround is to upload encrypted so they cannot tell with certainty what files you have.

2016-10-18 02:31:49	DriesS	Hi, I use beaglebone black with kernel 3.8.13-bone68 before and there the i2c-2 was on 4802a000.i2c, now when using the new kernel beaglebone 4.4.9-ti-r25 the i2c-2 is on 4819c000.i2c. They inversed i2c-1 and i2c-2. Is this normal? Can I change this or do I need to rewrite my software?

Is a non owner able to rename X into Y? On my machine it says permission denied, but on another it allows the renaming. What should be the right behaviour?

2016-10-18 04:59:06	aw1	trying to ssh -X into a ubuntu server on AWS from an archlinux machine. When I try to launch firefox it takes a long time for the firefox window to come up, IF AT ALL, and I keep getting these messages "Client failed to connect to the D-BUS daemon: //bin/dbus-launch terminated abnormally without any error message". Other users connecting from ubuntu machines say they don't have any problems. What should I look into to fix this problem?

When I try to forcibly remove using "apt-get --purge remove ranger" I still get the same problem.

2016-10-18 10:39:41	Robin___	HMM if i subtract these values in HEX, 83 HEX (-125 DEC) minus E2 HEX (-30 DECIMAL) i get the answer 65 HEX which is NOT -155 DEC, its actually -101 DEC. I suppose this is overflow since im working with 128 bits, but why does it give me 65 HEX and not some other hex number?

2016-10-18 12:31:41	Muzer	Phew. I've got myself into a little bit of a pickle. Through use of pivot_root I've managed to get my environment into a state where I have /mnt/x which contains /mnt/y which contains the file backing the loopback device for /mnt/x. I could reboot and fix it by starting again but it took a little setup to get to this stage so I would rather not. Is there a way to get /mnt/x unmounted?
2016-10-18 12:31:43	roger`	thanks debkad
2016-10-18 12:32:51	Muzer	(turns out you can change loopback device backing files but only if the device is read-only which this one isn't. I would fix that were I to reboot and start again)

2016-10-18 16:18:01	Burrito	so on some Gnome 3/GTK3 applications (gedit, evince), if I click and hold the scrollbar for a few seconds without dragging it, scrolling the same distance takes much more movement. I'm guessing this is a feature. My mouse is pretty good and I find this feature annoying. Anyone know how to turn it off?

2016-10-18 18:10:08	ananke	hassoon: because instead of mentioning _technologies_, you listed linux specific device names. not to mention, specific sequence
2016-10-18 18:10:09	jim	hassoon, right, the person conducting the interview might not know what you're referring to
2016-10-18 18:10:09	[R]	jeffl35: hold on, let me use my ESP(N) to see your message
2016-10-18 18:10:31	jeffl35	[R]: what
2016-10-18 18:10:42	hassoon	ananke: yeah the job is about linux, dunno what they will want me to do though
2016-10-18 18:10:47	[R]	i have a great interview story... my boss told me when he used to interview people, he would saay "jay va"... and see how people reacted
2016-10-18 18:10:55	jim	I see... a fastball in your future...
2016-10-18 18:11:08	rascul	hassoon this is for a specific job? tailor your resume to that, then
2016-10-18 18:11:12	hassoon	well at least i'm referring to some networking commands no ?
2016-10-18 18:11:19	hassoon	rascul: yep
2016-10-18 18:11:22	hassoon	rascul: a specific  job,
2016-10-18 18:11:27	moparisthebest	I wouldn't just list random 'networking commands'
2016-10-18 18:11:32	rascul	research what technologies and whatnot they're using, and if possible, try to show competency in those
2016-10-18 18:11:41	moparisthebest	if I saw a resume that listed 'ping', I'd throw it away
2016-10-18 18:11:42	[R]	rascul: oh... you're supposed to tailor it? hell, when i applied to microsoft mine was full of linux stuff
2016-10-18 18:11:52	jim	hassoon, actually that]s a good question... what job are you applying for?

2016-10-18 18:12:29	daltonx	in my opinion listing "ping" is like seeing "i can turn on a led" on a electronic engineer curriculum

2016-10-18 18:14:06	rascul	hassoon do you know anything about what distros and tooling they use?
2016-10-18 18:14:07	Penguin	I don't speak idiot.
2016-10-18 18:14:15	jeffreylevesque	i know init scripts are like legacy syntax to systemd, anyone know why i have to reboot my vm before my `sass` service is persistent, always running - https://bpaste.net/show/1058da0c2599

2016-10-18 18:15:02	hassoon	holy moley i spend the night writing this resume
2016-10-18 18:15:06	hassoon	* spent *
2016-10-18 18:15:09	[R]	is "applications supervision" a nice way of saying you sit there and restart an application when it crashes?
2016-10-18 18:15:12	[R]	don't they make tools for that?
2016-10-18 18:15:20	jeffreylevesque	i wasted the late night playing a retarded game

2016-10-18 18:15:35	jim	hassoon, for a job like that, -one- of the requirements sounds like system administration (creating users, writing scripts, setting up printers and other devices, backing it up, that kind of stuff)
2016-10-18 18:15:42	rascul	hassoon it kind of does matter, though, and i don't mean just the distro

2016-10-18 18:16:57	rascul	not exactly sure what application supervision means as a job description though, but i imagine some soft of configuration management and possibly virtualization or container stuff could be involved
