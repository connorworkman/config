2016-10-18 00:14:21	megaTherion	[09:50:47] its the only option if you want native access ^^ [09:50:47]

2016-10-18 00:14:21	High_Priest	[09:53:18] anyone here has any experience with sap hana on sles? specifically, with hw evaluation tool - it's failing for me for 16K block size - overwrite test. All other tests are much higher than minimal. Any ideas? [09:53:18]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	farhad	[09:56:55] jamesax: absolutely you are right. but i cant solve it. [09:56:55]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[09:57:21] DeaDSouL_: ntfs [09:57:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[09:57:37] DeaDSouL_: fat32 sucks bigtime [09:57:37]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[09:58:09] DeaDSouL_: no journal, 4gb file size limit, no sane permissions.... [09:58:09]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	megaTherion	[10:00:00] MrElendig: but I doubt that Mac OSX has native support... :) [10:00:00]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:00:12] megaTherion: that is not a problem [10:00:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	megaTherion	[10:00:25] depends [10:00:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:00:26] it is much less of a problem than the problems with fat32 [10:00:26]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	megaTherion	[10:00:54] *shrugs* one can argue, even ntfs is insufficient these days [10:00:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:01:22] "hmm, should I install fuse or should I use a fs that will eat my data, asuming I can even copy the data to it in ther first place?" [10:01:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	megaTherion	[10:01:46] ntfs eats data too :O [10:01:46]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:01:54] to much lesser extent [10:01:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	RayTracer	[10:02:00] High_Priest: I never did that test, but might 16k overwrite be slow because of large stripe size or readahead? (read >>16k, modify, write >>16k)? [10:02:00]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:02:24] also osX is getting ntfs support out of the box soon™ [10:02:24]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:03:09] rw that is, it already supports read only access out of the box [10:03:09]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	megaTherion	[10:05:35] MrElendig: how would that possible? [10:05:35]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:05:54] how could what be possible? [10:05:54]

2016-10-18 00:14:21	megaTherion	[10:07:06] MrElendig: getting native support for ntfs, wasnt there some license issue's? [10:07:06]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:07:22] megaTherion: apple happens to have a shitload of money [10:07:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	High_Priest	[10:07:42] RayTracer, don't know - read_ahead_kb is set to 4096 [10:07:42]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	High_Priest	[10:08:41] RayTracer, I see that default values usually are 128 or 512 [10:08:41]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	ShapeShifter499	[10:09:54] what program do you guys use if you want to upload to a cloud?    I'm trying to find a proper solution to upload files to amazon cloud encrypted while getting around the limit of 50GB per file.   I was looking at odrive since it has linux and amazon cloud support but I'm not sure if I can trust it. [10:09:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	megaTherion	[10:10:05] MrElendig: I know that, but in that case they could rather implement btrfs or whatever... ntfs stinks like rotten fish - that would also be funny because then MS would be the one who had to act [10:10:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:10:09] ShapeShifter499: scp [10:10:09]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:10:18] ShapeShifter499: or anything that does https [10:10:18]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	ShapeShifter499	[10:10:22] Oh and odrive because it includes support for splitting on files before upload [10:10:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:10:38] megaTherion: ntfs support would make them money, btrfs support would not [10:10:38]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	ShapeShifter499	[10:10:44] MrElendig: uh, I'm not sure how'd I use it with amazon cloud [10:10:44]

2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:12:39] or did you actually mean the horrible cloud drive? [10:12:39]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	farciarz84	[10:12:40] hi, what's better to serve large files: sftp or nginx and http download? [10:12:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	ShapeShifter499	[10:12:45] MrElendig: oh no I'm talking about the "Amazon Cloud Drive" [10:12:45]

2016-10-18 00:14:21	megaTherion	[10:13:21] MrElendig: as you said, they already have a shitload of money... maybe there are other interests which weight higher [10:13:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:13:32] ShapeShifter499: people have written scripts, fuse filesystems etc for it [10:13:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:13:52] megaTherion: they have said that they will add rw ntfs support [10:13:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:21	MrElendig	[10:14:01] megaTherion: because it lets them compete better with MS [10:14:01]

The workaround is to upload encrypted so they cannot tell with certainty what files you have.

2016-10-18 02:31:49	DriesS	Hi, I use beaglebone black with kernel 3.8.13-bone68 before and there the i2c-2 was on 4802a000.i2c, now when using the new kernel beaglebone 4.4.9-ti-r25 the i2c-2 is on 4819c000.i2c. They inversed i2c-1 and i2c-2. Is this normal? Can I change this or do I need to rewrite my software?

Is a non owner able to rename X into Y? On my machine it says permission denied, but on another it allows the renaming. What should be the right behaviour?

2016-10-18 04:59:06	aw1	trying to ssh -X into a ubuntu server on AWS from an archlinux machine. When I try to launch firefox it takes a long time for the firefox window to come up, IF AT ALL, and I keep getting these messages "Client failed to connect to the D-BUS daemon: //bin/dbus-launch terminated abnormally without any error message". Other users connecting from ubuntu machines say they don't have any problems. What should I look into to fix this problem?

When I try to forcibly remove using "apt-get --purge remove ranger" I still get the same problem.

2016-10-18 10:39:41	Robin___	HMM if i subtract these values in HEX, 83 HEX (-125 DEC) minus E2 HEX (-30 DECIMAL) i get the answer 65 HEX which is NOT -155 DEC, its actually -101 DEC. I suppose this is overflow since im working with 128 bits, but why does it give me 65 HEX and not some other hex number?

2016-10-18 12:31:41	Muzer	Phew. I've got myself into a little bit of a pickle. Through use of pivot_root I've managed to get my environment into a state where I have /mnt/x which contains /mnt/y which contains the file backing the loopback device for /mnt/x. I could reboot and fix it by starting again but it took a little setup to get to this stage so I would rather not. Is there a way to get /mnt/x unmounted?
2016-10-18 12:31:43	roger`	thanks debkad
2016-10-18 12:32:51	Muzer	(turns out you can change loopback device backing files but only if the device is read-only which this one isn't. I would fix that were I to reboot and start again)

2016-10-18 16:18:01	Burrito	so on some Gnome 3/GTK3 applications (gedit, evince), if I click and hold the scrollbar for a few seconds without dragging it, scrolling the same distance takes much more movement. I'm guessing this is a feature. My mouse is pretty good and I find this feature annoying. Anyone know how to turn it off?

2016-10-18 23:55:21	 *	LordRyan [09:35:36] wonders if zsh tracks -f and -r [09:35:36]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	bocaneri	[09:35:42] Guys, let's keep a lid on the language. [09:35:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	FinalX	[09:35:50] yeah, but I don't really mind it, I don't often delete all files in a dir. it doesn't ask if you want to rm -rf a dir, which is what I'd do more often. [09:35:50]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	High_Priest	[09:35:58] Muyfret, if  windows/linux both, then ntfs is your best bet. There are ext* readers for windows but it's easier just to go with ntfs [09:35:58]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Muyfret	[09:36:07] high_priest windows/linux [09:36:07]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	LordRyan	[09:36:50] ooh [09:36:50]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	LordRyan	[09:36:54] FinalX: there's also rm -I [09:36:54]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	LordRyan	[09:36:59] which i'm def. setting. [09:36:59]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	FinalX	[09:37:32] oh, didn't know that existed actually. that's a nice one. [09:37:32]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	FinalX	[09:37:56] -i was annoying me a lot, so I ditched it.. -I is a good alternative [09:37:56]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	ayogi	[09:38:29] ayecee, i have done some optimization, how should i check now if it has improved the performance [09:38:29]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Muyfret	[09:38:37] i setup my partitions so that i have this nice half a terabyte for operating systems stored on the same drive and outside to access. i consider this a good backup point. i lost 5 years of hard work and all my login details because i didn't choose a goood backup site [09:38:37]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	LordRyan	[09:39:39] FinalX: it actually says in the manpage (at least, on Debian) to use -I for something less intrusive. [09:39:39]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	LordRyan	[09:39:44] :+1: anyways [09:39:44]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Muyfret	[09:41:04] now i ask for a much more difficult solution. how do you hash the entire space your OS takes up? and is that a reliable hash at SHA-256? [09:41:04]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	rumpel	[09:41:42] Muyfret, define "entire space your OS takes up" and "reliable" [09:41:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Muyfret	[09:42:13] rumpel an attacker could not have replaced the OS with one that could spy on me [09:42:13]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	horse	[09:42:51] hi all.  I want to check the patch status of an old RHEL 5 box.  "yum history" dosn't work (presuably cuz it's too old).  rpm -qa --last brings back a load of dates for each package. [09:42:51]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	horse	[09:43:15] is that a reliable way to see when each package was last patched?  or is there a better way? [09:43:15]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	rumpel	[09:43:21] Muyfret, the thing is: the "entire space your OS takes up" usually also changes all the time [09:43:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Muyfret	[09:43:44] rumpel i can do a check with a livecd after i boot off and restart [09:43:44]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	rumpel	[09:44:11] Muyfret, sure. Question is: check what and how reliable would that be? [09:44:11]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Muyfret	[09:44:45] rumpel my home directory would be encrypted so we can ignore that. i also would like to check the applications [09:44:45]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	rumpel	[09:45:23] Muyfret, encryption is only effective as long as you don't access the encrypted data [09:45:23]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	rumpel	[09:45:51] Muyfret, so... you wouldn't be able to use it anymore, if you want it to be "secure" [09:45:51]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Muyfret	[09:46:26] rumpel if the os and the apps hashes checkout then they can't have spied on me [09:46:26]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Muyfret	[09:46:39] i can check the os by hashes before using it again [09:46:39]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	rumpel	[09:46:42] Muyfret, if your system is compromised and it's really important not to be compromised: throw everything away, buy new stuff [09:46:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	rumpel	[09:46:53] Muyfret, nope. Too easy. [09:46:53]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Muyfret	[09:46:57] too broke for that. i can only do all that i can do [09:46:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Muyfret	[09:47:21] so it's too easy to pass a hash check with an infected OS where the original was? [09:47:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	rumpel	[09:47:24] Muyfret, it's just an indication that it might not have changed. [09:47:24]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	rumpel	[09:47:51] Muyfret, a hash of an OS doesn't make sense. [09:47:51]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	rumpel	[09:48:14] Muyfret, the OS changes all the time. Do we speak about read-only OS, which reverts after each boot? then you don't need to check it either. [09:48:14]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Muyfret	[09:49:53] the scenario is you are going away from the machine and leaving the harddisk with it. you use a livecd to do a hash of all the OS files when the OS is not loaded into memory. [09:49:53]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	ayogi	[09:49:59] even the simple cp, command is waiting for disk i/o, there is no other command in 'D' state [09:49:59]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	rumpel	[09:50:02] Muyfret, however as soon as you are compromised, you can't really trust anything anymore. [09:50:02]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Muyfret	[09:50:16] when you return to use the machine you load a livecd to do the hashing agian and do checks to see if any file changed [09:50:16]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	rumpel	[09:50:38] Muyfret, as I said: why not use a read-only system? [09:50:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Muyfret	[09:51:16] rumpel they could replace your harddisk with a not-read only system that resembles yours [09:51:16]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Sharetel	[09:51:38] Hi, a storage device has a frequently changing mount points. Please can someone tell me if there is any option to enter such dynamic mount points in /etc/fstab? [09:51:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	rumpel	[09:51:44] Muyfret, then you already lost. [09:51:44]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Muyfret	[09:52:14] rumpel not entirely. i coul avoid giving up my password by knowing the os had changed [09:52:14]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	rumpel	[09:52:40] Muyfret, they could also replace your keyboard ... or plug something in between keyboard and usb port... or whoknowswhat [09:52:40]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	rumpel	[09:53:16] Muyfret, then you enter your password and voilá ... [09:53:16]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	Muyfret	[09:53:18] that's true. but i have a solution to logging in without revealing what the real password is atleast if keyboard strokes is whats being logged [09:53:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	netnetnert	[09:53:59] Hey guys, running sshd in debug mode gives me a Permission Denied error (Could not open authorized_keys) file. [09:53:59]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	netnetnert	[09:54:04] however, when I log in as this user with password authentication, I can cd to all the way down into .ssh [09:54:04]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	netnetnert	[09:54:17] and I can cat authorized_keys [09:54:17]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	netnetnert	[09:54:22] wouldn't this indicate that the permissions aren't too restrictive? [09:54:22]
2016-10-18 23:55:21	***	Playback Complete.
2016-10-18 23:55:27	Muyfret	rumpel in my case i typically turn on the computer and leave it on while i'm there. so deducing the passwords by what keys you pressed could be defeated by giving them new random key combinations .

2016-10-19 00:41:20	rumpel	[09:47:51] Muyfret, a hash of an OS doesn't make sense. [09:47:51]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	rumpel	[09:48:14] Muyfret, the OS changes all the time. Do we speak about read-only OS, which reverts after each boot? then you don't need to check it either. [09:48:14]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	Muyfret	[09:49:53] the scenario is you are going away from the machine and leaving the harddisk with it. you use a livecd to do a hash of all the OS files when the OS is not loaded into memory. [09:49:53]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	ayogi	[09:49:59] even the simple cp, command is waiting for disk i/o, there is no other command in 'D' state [09:49:59]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	rumpel	[09:50:02] Muyfret, however as soon as you are compromised, you can't really trust anything anymore. [09:50:02]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	Muyfret	[09:50:16] when you return to use the machine you load a livecd to do the hashing agian and do checks to see if any file changed [09:50:16]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	rumpel	[09:50:38] Muyfret, as I said: why not use a read-only system? [09:50:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	Muyfret	[09:51:16] rumpel they could replace your harddisk with a not-read only system that resembles yours [09:51:16]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	Sharetel	[09:51:38] Hi, a storage device has a frequently changing mount points. Please can someone tell me if there is any option to enter such dynamic mount points in /etc/fstab? [09:51:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	rumpel	[09:51:44] Muyfret, then you already lost. [09:51:44]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	Muyfret	[09:52:14] rumpel not entirely. i coul avoid giving up my password by knowing the os had changed [09:52:14]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	rumpel	[09:52:40] Muyfret, they could also replace your keyboard ... or plug something in between keyboard and usb port... or whoknowswhat [09:52:40]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	rumpel	[09:53:16] Muyfret, then you enter your password and voilá ... [09:53:16]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	Muyfret	[09:53:18] that's true. but i have a solution to logging in without revealing what the real password is atleast if keyboard strokes is whats being logged [09:53:18]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	netnetnert	[09:53:59] Hey guys, running sshd in debug mode gives me a Permission Denied error (Could not open authorized_keys) file. [09:53:59]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	netnetnert	[09:54:04] however, when I log in as this user with password authentication, I can cd to all the way down into .ssh [09:54:04]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	netnetnert	[09:54:17] and I can cat authorized_keys [09:54:17]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	netnetnert	[09:54:22] wouldn't this indicate that the permissions aren't too restrictive? [09:54:22]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	Muyfret	[09:55:21] rumpel in my case i typically turn on the computer and leave it on while i'm there. so deducing the passwords by what keys you pressed could be defeated by giving them new random key combinations . [09:55:21]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	Muyfret	[09:56:15] i simply don't login enough for them to deduce the cipher [09:56:15]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	Muyfret	[09:58:54] subsequent use of the operating system can be done by another key. basically one to login to your user, another does all the work. the second doesn't need a cipher since it isn't adequate to access the user data and you can just change its password before shutting down the computer to leave again [09:58:54]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	boodllebat	[10:02:00] i want to rsync two directories one is in /home/pr/work/one and other directory is /home/pr/work/two , so i did this `rsync ~/work/one ~/work/two` but it never syncs says something like `skipping directory` [10:02:00]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	boodllebat	[10:02:15] any help would be appreciated :) [10:02:15]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	rumpel	[10:02:34] Muyfret, I get the impression that you want to protect yourself against stupid people [10:02:34]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	Muyfret	[10:04:06] rumpel what do you mean? [10:04:06]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	boodllebat	[10:04:31] Solved [10:04:31]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	rumpel	[10:05:11] Muyfret, you underestimate the possibilities yet you try to be overcautious at the same time [10:05:11]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	Muyfret	[10:06:38] rumpel it's more like i can only handle so much [10:06:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	Muyfret	[10:06:57] resource-wise [10:06:57]

2016-10-19 00:41:20	netnetnert	[10:11:57] -eumel-, I've recreate ~/.ssh on both the client and server. [10:11:57]

2016-10-19 00:41:20	Muyfret	[10:13:28] rumpel? what am i missing here? you throw a blanket over your head and the monitor. that cuts out the more obvious way to get a user's password [10:13:28]
2016-10-19 00:41:20	rumpel	[10:14:21] Muyfret, you can't trust a compromised system. Especially not physically compromised ones. [10:14:21]

2016-10-19 01:20:24	abhinavmehta	If there is single STDOUT - then what will happen if multiple processes are writing; Let say if I run some service non-daemonized, I dont see other services logs getting mixed and cluttering .. so how this could be managed if there is single STDOUT

2016-10-19 05:03:41	jonah	Hi can anyone help with a spare server I have. I have made a "hotswap" server as a backup box, so if I get a hardware failure on a different machine I can stick the drives in the spare/hotswap and boot that. Now it does boot great when testing with my debian jessie hard drives - BUT the Network card doesn't work as it has a different one to the other systems. I just wondered how I can enable the network card to work with debian jessie if I need to
2016-10-19 05:03:41	jonah	use this backup box... Thanks for any help?

2016-10-19 08:49:48	eahmedshendy	Hi
2016-10-19 08:49:48	eahmedshendy	Here is the situation, when you have a simple network infrastructure, one DSL router for internet and local network, and a local server behind this DSL router. This local server hosts a website. Internet can access application on this local server through a static IP address.
2016-10-19 08:49:49	eahmedshendy	Here is the problem, when local server is connected to the network of the local employee (which means has access to the router and internet), internet bandwidth is getting too low, even google can�t be opened easily. If we disconnected this server from the network, internet connection is getting back to normal, and everyone feels fine against it.
2016-10-19 08:49:50	eahmedshendy	So how do you think as a procedure to identify the problem. After many things (with my little knowledge), I guess the server may be hacked.

2016-10-19 08:49:53	eahmedshendy	The admin of the server (non-IT guy) told me that the server previously can be accessed through static IP address from internet, and locally, but from the localhost itself only you can �ping 8.8.8.8� but not �ping www.google.com�, some friend just edited resolv.conf file with a DNS, and now the server can access internet. After this change in resolv.conf, the problem of internet bandwidth is started.
