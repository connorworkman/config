2016-09-15 22:37:39	steveccc	can i get peoples opinion on something. A clients it company who manage their domain have an ipv6 address set for the domain which is some random server and not the web server running their site. We have asked for it to be deleted as ipv6 internet users were not reaching the site. They have said if they remove the ipv6 address then ipv6 customers will be unable to get to the web server. I was on the understanding it would just use the ipv4 address ins

2016-09-15 22:52:04	rfuentess	but in the last part, if the clients only have IPv6 stacks (ODD)  then yes,  not IPv6, mean, no way to reach the (random? web?) server. But  that hardly will be a todya scenario for normal hosts, the majority will  have the IPv/IPv6 stack, and if they are using DNS should be transparent to them
2016-09-15 22:52:10	bezaban	steveccc: yeah, mostly everyone run dual stack. However you only need to change the DNS entry

2016-09-15 22:54:07	steveccc	rfuentess: the issue has come about as some viewers with a certain isp who uses ipv6 internet connections are unable to reach our site. I would think it stupid if the isp only uses ipv6 - as you say they must run both or half the sites on the web wouldnt be available. So you guys agree the AAAA ipv6 address which goes to a random server must be deleted?
2016-09-15 22:54:07		[22:54]
2016-09-15 22:55:37	rfuentess	then is more a problem of DNS than IPv6 stack, if only some users are having the issue, and more important that those users have a common ISP

2016-09-15 22:58:27	rfuentess	steveccc: Still, assuming users with dual stack, when the translation  of the DNS takes place, will try first IPv6, then IPv4,  if the registry name of your webserver is wrong on the IPv6, then the users will reach the  random server
2016-09-15 22:59:10	rfuentess	the most simple way to detect that, is asking some clients to write directly the IPv6 addresses of your web server, or to print the DNS entry they are getting
2016-09-15 22:59:38	steveccc	rfuentess: thanks - thats what I thought. Their response is that if the ipv6 record isnt present then anyone on ipv6 wont be able to get to the web server. Which is rubbish - how is having an incorrect address better than no address
2016-09-15 23:00:08	steveccc	the issue is our web server is with google compute cloud who dont use ipv6 so there is only an ipv4 address
2016-09-15 23:00:22	steveccc	whats why the dns having an ipv6 address is completely wrong as one doesnt exist

2016-09-16 00:54:51	Gollee	the most popular way is DNS reflection, where you send a DNS query to lots of servers with the victim as the source IP, and each DNS server will respond to that IP, thus attacking it

2016-09-16 01:00:31	Gollee	it's only really effective if the ISP originating the traffic does the uRPF checking. An ISP further down the path doing uRPF doesn't have the same effect because it can't really know where the traffic originated
2016-09-16 01:00:47	Gollee	daemonkeeper: oh, what are sending it nowadays?
2016-09-16 01:01:19	+daemonkeeper	You just need a single Ukrainian dubious hoster, and send spoofed DNS queries to one of the tons of public authoritative DNS servers out there.
2016-09-16 01:02:16	+daemonkeeper	DNS has an amplification factor of 60something so if you got a single pipe with 1 Gb in the Ukraine, you can produce a 60G DDoS.

2016-09-16 02:20:59	Gollee	that's plenty of login attempts stopped right there
2016-09-16 02:21:19	Gollee	if username/password isn't enough, which it shouldn't be, use certs instead. That's proper security
2016-09-16 02:21:43	+daemonkeeper	And SSH for once is very much one of the most secure and safest applications you can use, when you handle it properly. There are tons of other services exposing a lot more risk than SSH

2016-09-16 03:38:30	diggity	Hello, I have an application that pulls a real time data stream from a load balancing server. Using our office fiber or my cellphone hotspot, the application works as expected, on one of our other networks(there are some firewalls etc), during the first few minutes I get a lot of drop outs, i tried looking at some connection logs and from my best guess it seems like the client application
2016-09-16 03:38:30	diggity	has difficulty determining which loadbalancing server to pull the data from, again i only see this behaviour on some networks. On a bad network i also did a test to first connect to a VPN elsewhere and the application ran fine in the tunne. When its dropping out on a 'bad' network it only happens for the first few minutes, I can see it opening and closing a lot of connections, then after
2016-09-16 03:38:30	diggity	about 3 minutes the connection opening seems to settle and the application will stay connected and not drop out anymore.. wondering if anyone has any suggestions on where/what to start looking for? Also application using port 443 and tls

2016-09-16 04:16:05	dockler	sni is needed as "host" field equivalent to http so the client can indicate what cname is the one expected for the same ip address
2016-09-16 04:16:05	diggity	the way i do it is in the rule i specify a 'destination address' as my public ip.. if the destination in the packet is my public ip, forward the traffic to my server, if the destination is not my public ip, the traffic is not for me, so the rule should not match and keep going to check other rules
2016-09-16 04:16:15	dockler	so san seems to be some kind of wildcard cert?
2016-09-16 04:16:31	dockler	san vs wildcard cert - and can a "good" wildcard cert or san make SNI unnecessary?

2016-09-16 04:27:12	diggity	bango, looking at the asus router you gave, it looks like advanced forwarding rule parameters are not supported. they do mention port forwarding port 80 should be ok, so i am guessing when you do that, it will automatically sort out the direction for you. Would need to know the netgear model to check that one..

2016-09-17 00:54:27	+daemonkeeper	Well, if you actually get a HTTP connection they can't be. If you just get a SYN they likely are.

2016-09-17 00:54:59	latenite	daemonkeeper, that ^^ I didn't understand.
2016-09-17 00:56:15	+daemonkeeper	You block clients because they actually establish a connection to your daemon? In that case they can't be spoofed since bidirectional reachability is implied then. For spoofed source only unidirectional communication is possible. That would be the case for SYN floods or similar.
2016-09-17 00:56:19	latenite	Also, is there a nice way to incorporate the ips banned by fail2ban into a set? For reuse on other machines or reboots.

2016-09-17 20:11:55	poplarave	thanks
2016-09-17 20:12:04	Harlock	so if you get out of range of the AP you are connected to it doesn;t swithc to another?
2016-09-17 20:12:20	poplarave	i would say it would
2016-09-17 20:12:24	poplarave	but they overlap
2016-09-17 20:12:38	poplarave	and when the other one is weaker, i want it to switch to the stronger one
2016-09-17 20:12:55	poplarave	but if you are closer to the stronger one first, and you connect it does pick the stronger of the two.  so that is good.

2016-09-17 20:14:55	poplarave	and this guy is saying more what you were saying "Roaming between access points is controlled by the client. The easiest fix is to go to the driver settings on your computer (sorry, MAC lovers, you are out of luck here). You should find a setting for roaming aggressiveness  This tells the driver basically how long to hold on to an association. Change it to a more aggressive setting and see if that fixes the problem."
2016-09-17 20:14:59	Harlock	though without the controller you typically set them to not overlap channels

Using those implies you trust the vendor to secure their access system and not muck with your network.  worst case is the vendor is compromised by a malicious entity and now they have full unfettered access to your network.

2016-09-18 08:41:35	brentaarnold	However, my next question is this: should you have a single entry point such as an SSLVPN firewall (SonicWALL, Fortigate, etc.) or is it just as safe to configure each workstation for direct RDP via WAN?

2016-09-18 08:42:54	genec	brentaarnold: as stated, there has been a history of flaws in RDP plus you need to configure a lot more instead of just build a single solid VPN

2016-09-18 09:13:48	brentaarnold	[18:40:06] genec: I was just thinking this [18:40:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	applegal	[18:40:10] Guys watch this starting from 7 minutes focus on the audience for 30 second https://youtu.be/H-qsQrSkKm0 [18:40:10]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	genec	[18:40:39] applegal: and what is "this"? [18:40:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	applegal	[18:41:02] Some powerful stuff [18:41:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	brentaarnold	[18:41:35] However, my next question is this: should you have a single entry point such as an SSLVPN firewall (SonicWALL, Fortigate, etc.) or is it just as safe to configure each workstation for direct RDP via WAN? [18:41:35]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	genec	[18:41:46] applegal: orly?  more powerful than a Bagger 288? [18:41:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	brentaarnold	[18:42:14] I think I like the single entry point better [18:42:14]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	brentaarnold	[18:42:34] I mean, if you can use an SSLVPN connection you don't need to configure the rest of the bullshit really [18:42:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	brentaarnold	[18:42:43] You can just use a common port on all RDP sessions [18:42:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	genec	[18:42:54] brentaarnold: as stated, there has been a history of flaws in RDP plus you need to configure a lot more instead of just build a single solid VPN [18:42:54]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	brentaarnold	[18:42:56] And use DNS names, etc. [18:42:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	brentaarnold	[18:44:20] What more would you be considering other than your SSLVPN security? [18:44:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	brentaarnold	[18:44:24] @ genec [18:44:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	genec	[18:44:59] brentaarnold: no, with RDP to each and every single workstation, there's a lot to build and ensure it's patched [18:44:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	brentaarnold	[18:45:36] genec: right [18:45:36]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	genec	[18:46:09] applegal: what is this "Some powerful stuff" about? [18:46:09]

2016-09-18 09:13:48	brentaarnold	[18:51:43] When speaking with an ISP about putting their modem into 'passthrough' mode, thereby allowing the WAN IP to be retained by the client's device instead of the modem... what is the proper term for that? Is it passthrough mode? [18:51:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Gollee	[18:52:02] bridged mode [18:52:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	brentaarnold	[18:52:12] Bridged [18:52:12]

2016-09-18 09:13:48	brentaarnold	[18:52:45] I have used the term 'bridged' and certain techs at the ISP companies didn't know what I was talking about [18:52:45]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	applegal	[18:52:54] Just watch from 7mins and focus on the audience for 30 seconds.. You will be amazed by the incoming powerful wave [18:52:54]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	brentaarnold	[18:52:59] So I've been weary to use the term since then, everyon seeems to know thee term 'passthrough' [18:52:59]

2016-09-18 09:13:48	brentaarnold	[18:53:59] Well, I live in Louisiana. We have a very weak infrastructure here and the quality IT people usually do this for a living at some place other than the phone company. [18:53:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	applegal	[18:55:05] I'm not trolling mate.. And I have already said you see the powerful incoming wave. It's only 30 sec [18:55:05]

2016-09-18 13:12:57	WACOMalt	Hey folks. Recently watch the linustechtips video about bonded internet setups. I take his word with a grain of salt but am wondering if my situation could benefit from that setup. Right now I have 2 connections from time warner, a residential and business both at 50/5mbps
2016-09-18 13:13:22	WACOMalt	I also have a dedicated server in atlanta georgia that i could use as the "combiner"
2016-09-18 13:13:57	brentaarnold	Okay, kind of have a big issue: I configured a Dell N3048 the other day at a client's office with an IP of 172.20.20.11. Now i'm remote from the device and I can't access it from a PC on the internal LAN (same subnet.) Using Angry IP I can't find the switch on any range. What should I do?
2016-09-18 13:14:00	WACOMalt	Wondering if this is doable for free with what I have rather than paying some company to do it for me.
2016-09-18 13:15:21	mp19uy	When using DHT, each peer stores the pair (key,value) when its ID is the closest to that key. But what is the content of VALUE? I'm reading the book "Networking a top down approach - Kurose" but it doesn't give details about that and I can't figure out after reading some articles about DHT, because they don't talk about the specific implementation of it.
2016-09-18 13:15:29	Eryn_1983_FL	not sure how to  attach it to the card i cant get it to hook to the  gold things..
2016-09-18 13:16:06	whoa	Eryn_1983_FL, should be pretty simple, if it doesnt fit you might not have the right connector

2016-09-18 13:16:31	whoa	Eryn_1983_FL, those connectors have different polarities too , which can mess things up
2016-09-18 13:16:31	WACOMalt	Well, ideally around 10mbps upload speed.
2016-09-18 13:16:59	Eryn_1983_FL	well the company i bought it from  picked it out

2016-09-18 13:23:32	Fira	WACOMalt: i never setup that kind of thing myself, but my understanding of the principle is that you need boxes on either end capable of running a VPN solution and loadbalance across them. Your dedicated server probably can, for the part in your home, you'll likely need to add something. As for specific software, anything with VPN & LB cap should do it. pfSense could be a starting point, although i recall from people doing

2016-09-18 13:24:35	Fira	[23:23:32] WACOMalt: i never setup that kind of thing myself, but my understanding of the principle is that you need boxes on either end capable of running a VPN solution and loadbalance across them. Your dedicated server probably can, for the part in your home, you'll likely need to add something. As for specific software, anything with VPN & LB cap should do it. pfSense could be a starting point, although i recall from people doing [23:23:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Fira	[23:23:33] that kind of setup that there's a better alternative. you can probably find more information looking around [23:23:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	WACOMalt	[23:24:17] Ok. Thank you for the info! [23:24:17]

2016-09-18 13:24:53	brentaarnold	Okay, kind of have a big issue: I configured a Dell N3048 the other day at a client's office with an IP of 172.20.20.11. Now i'm remote from the device and I can't access it from a PC on the internal LAN (same subnet.) Using Angry IP I can't find the switch on any range. What should I do?

2016-09-18 13:28:35	OMGDoggeh	Mainline DHT is the name given to the Kademlia-based Distributed Hash Table (DHT) used by BitTorrent clients to find peers via the BitTorrent protocol. The idea of utilizing a DHT for distributed tracking was first implemented in Azureus 2.3.0.0 (now
