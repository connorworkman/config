2016-09-15 22:37:39	steveccc	can i get peoples opinion on something. A clients it company who manage their domain have an ipv6 address set for the domain which is some random server and not the web server running their site. We have asked for it to be deleted as ipv6 internet users were not reaching the site. They have said if they remove the ipv6 address then ipv6 customers will be unable to get to the web server. I was on the understanding it would just use the ipv4 address ins

2016-09-15 22:52:04	rfuentess	but in the last part, if the clients only have IPv6 stacks (ODD)  then yes,  not IPv6, mean, no way to reach the (random? web?) server. But  that hardly will be a todya scenario for normal hosts, the majority will  have the IPv/IPv6 stack, and if they are using DNS should be transparent to them
2016-09-15 22:52:10	bezaban	steveccc: yeah, mostly everyone run dual stack. However you only need to change the DNS entry

2016-09-15 22:54:07	steveccc	rfuentess: the issue has come about as some viewers with a certain isp who uses ipv6 internet connections are unable to reach our site. I would think it stupid if the isp only uses ipv6 - as you say they must run both or half the sites on the web wouldnt be available. So you guys agree the AAAA ipv6 address which goes to a random server must be deleted?
2016-09-15 22:54:07		[22:54]
2016-09-15 22:55:37	rfuentess	then is more a problem of DNS than IPv6 stack, if only some users are having the issue, and more important that those users have a common ISP

2016-09-15 22:58:27	rfuentess	steveccc: Still, assuming users with dual stack, when the translation  of the DNS takes place, will try first IPv6, then IPv4,  if the registry name of your webserver is wrong on the IPv6, then the users will reach the  random server
2016-09-15 22:59:10	rfuentess	the most simple way to detect that, is asking some clients to write directly the IPv6 addresses of your web server, or to print the DNS entry they are getting
2016-09-15 22:59:38	steveccc	rfuentess: thanks - thats what I thought. Their response is that if the ipv6 record isnt present then anyone on ipv6 wont be able to get to the web server. Which is rubbish - how is having an incorrect address better than no address
2016-09-15 23:00:08	steveccc	the issue is our web server is with google compute cloud who dont use ipv6 so there is only an ipv4 address
2016-09-15 23:00:22	steveccc	whats why the dns having an ipv6 address is completely wrong as one doesnt exist

2016-09-16 00:54:51	Gollee	the most popular way is DNS reflection, where you send a DNS query to lots of servers with the victim as the source IP, and each DNS server will respond to that IP, thus attacking it

2016-09-16 01:00:31	Gollee	it's only really effective if the ISP originating the traffic does the uRPF checking. An ISP further down the path doing uRPF doesn't have the same effect because it can't really know where the traffic originated
2016-09-16 01:00:47	Gollee	daemonkeeper: oh, what are sending it nowadays?
2016-09-16 01:01:19	+daemonkeeper	You just need a single Ukrainian dubious hoster, and send spoofed DNS queries to one of the tons of public authoritative DNS servers out there.
2016-09-16 01:02:16	+daemonkeeper	DNS has an amplification factor of 60something so if you got a single pipe with 1 Gb in the Ukraine, you can produce a 60G DDoS.

2016-09-16 02:20:59	Gollee	that's plenty of login attempts stopped right there
2016-09-16 02:21:19	Gollee	if username/password isn't enough, which it shouldn't be, use certs instead. That's proper security
2016-09-16 02:21:43	+daemonkeeper	And SSH for once is very much one of the most secure and safest applications you can use, when you handle it properly. There are tons of other services exposing a lot more risk than SSH

2016-09-16 03:38:30	diggity	Hello, I have an application that pulls a real time data stream from a load balancing server. Using our office fiber or my cellphone hotspot, the application works as expected, on one of our other networks(there are some firewalls etc), during the first few minutes I get a lot of drop outs, i tried looking at some connection logs and from my best guess it seems like the client application
2016-09-16 03:38:30	diggity	has difficulty determining which loadbalancing server to pull the data from, again i only see this behaviour on some networks. On a bad network i also did a test to first connect to a VPN elsewhere and the application ran fine in the tunne. When its dropping out on a 'bad' network it only happens for the first few minutes, I can see it opening and closing a lot of connections, then after
2016-09-16 03:38:30	diggity	about 3 minutes the connection opening seems to settle and the application will stay connected and not drop out anymore.. wondering if anyone has any suggestions on where/what to start looking for? Also application using port 443 and tls

2016-09-16 04:16:05	dockler	sni is needed as "host" field equivalent to http so the client can indicate what cname is the one expected for the same ip address
2016-09-16 04:16:05	diggity	the way i do it is in the rule i specify a 'destination address' as my public ip.. if the destination in the packet is my public ip, forward the traffic to my server, if the destination is not my public ip, the traffic is not for me, so the rule should not match and keep going to check other rules
2016-09-16 04:16:15	dockler	so san seems to be some kind of wildcard cert?
2016-09-16 04:16:31	dockler	san vs wildcard cert - and can a "good" wildcard cert or san make SNI unnecessary?

2016-09-16 04:27:12	diggity	bango, looking at the asus router you gave, it looks like advanced forwarding rule parameters are not supported. they do mention port forwarding port 80 should be ok, so i am guessing when you do that, it will automatically sort out the direction for you. Would need to know the netgear model to check that one..
