2016-09-12 00:44:59	gryffus	Hello, i would like to ask for help with batch rename script. I have files with versions in suffix and i would like to change the versioning to different format, example: http://pastebin.com/jz3Wii24 . Newest version has always "A" version. Not all files have multiple versions, some have only the "A" version. Would this be possible?

2016-09-12 14:47:47	rangergord	Any idea why this doesn't work? alias gf='﻿git log --follow -p --'  . "gf somefile" returns "git: command not found". But if I use the expanded command instead of the alias, it works.
2016-09-12 14:48:09	yitz	rangergord: what do you get when you run 'type git' ?
2016-09-12 14:48:19	rangergord	"git is hashed (/usr/bin/git)"
2016-09-12 14:48:23	rangergord	whoa, deja vu :)
2016-09-12 14:48:27	yitz	Yeah. Should work then
2016-09-12 14:48:38	yitz	Are you running it in a different environment somehow?
2016-09-12 14:48:48	yitz	Things more faster in #git and get buried easier
2016-09-12 14:48:49	rangergord	It doesn't work in Gnome Terminal 3.6.2 (Ubuntu 16.04).
2016-09-12 14:49:09	yitz	Simple/instant fix: stop using aliases and use a function
2016-09-12 14:49:27	yitz	gf () { git log --follow -p -- "$@"; }
2016-09-12 14:49:27	rangergord	ah, let me try
2016-09-12 14:49:30	yitz	!lias
2016-09-12 14:49:31	yitz	!alias
2016-09-12 14:49:32	greybot	An alias is a small in-line command name text replacement. They are not commands and cannot take arguments. Only use aliases for expanding things like default command switches: alias l='ls -l'. For everything else, use a function instead: del() { mv -i "$@" ~/.trash; }
2016-09-12 14:49:54	yitz	Though that alias ought to work. I'm not seeing the issue with it.
2016-09-12 14:50:17	rangergord	yeah, it worked as a function
2016-09-12 14:50:28	rangergord	just to be safe, I'm gonna delete bashrc and bash_aliases and see what happens
2016-09-12 14:50:36	rangergord	not safe
2016-09-12 14:50:37	twkm	hahahaha.

2016-09-12 14:51:49	rangergord	jetchisel: haha, yeah, I know. I actually just realized I was using an old local copy, I prefer to symlink a bashrc from an online git repo :)
2016-09-12 14:52:14	rangergord	nope, even with blank environment, that alias doesn't work
2016-09-12 14:52:40	jetchisel	then stop using aliases :)
2016-09-12 14:52:42	rangergord	oh well. I'll use a function a you advised. Thanks!

2016-09-12 18:03:34	mascot66991	http://dpaste.com/0KVQ8XJ why does echo print function name rather than output ?
2016-09-12 18:03:49	izalove	mascot66991: because that's what echo does
2016-09-12 18:03:54	izalove	# echo hello

2016-09-12 18:04:43	mascot66991	but I saw on internet that it should print what function returns. How do I call function?

2016-09-12 18:04:53	larryv	generally commands are only invoked if their name is at the beginning of a line
2016-09-12 18:04:57	larryv	or the moral equivalent
2016-09-12 18:05:05	twkm	remove the echo.
2016-09-12 18:05:07	izalove	functions don't "return" anything other than a 0-255 value

2016-09-12 21:49:51	czwolf	Hello, there is a silly question nobody gave me an answer for it yet. I can run a terminal, e.g. like this: xfce4-terminal -x myscript.sh. The window opens and there are running commands present in the script. When I press CTRL-C, the execution ends and the window disappears. That I do not want. OK, I can use -H (Hold.) to run a terminal. Then I see the output but I cannot write anymore into that window. I want it to stay there, the same way as if I would
2016-09-12 21:49:51	czwolf	start terminal by doubleclick and to write commands there by hand. How to start such a window by script and how to send commands there by script to keep that behavior, if possible?
2016-09-12 21:50:16	twkm	consider reading how to control xfce4-terminal.
2016-09-12 21:50:20	survietamine	see the example that ends with "done < <(some command)"
2016-09-12 21:50:43	BenA	Which example?

2016-09-13 02:31:23	Vonor	hi. I got a folder structure that contains more than 500 video files (but other files too). I need to scp these videos to a different machine. so i did a find ./ -type f -iname *.mp4 -o -iname *.mov -o -iname *.mxf -exec scp {} host:/dest/folder/ \;  the issue i got is, that it transfers the files sequential but using "+" instead of "\;" would try to transfer them all at once. is there a way to transfer them in chunks of like 10 at once?

2016-09-13 02:32:10	stevenm_	geirha, i think I prefer echo though - i only really use printf for one-liners where I don't want a linefeed at the end

2016-09-13 02:37:43	stevenm_	geirha, IFS sets the expected delimiter right ? so instead of setting IFS, can you use 'read' and specify to 'read' which delimiters to expect ? (Kind of like what you can do with awk?)

2016-09-13 04:18:07	JyZyXEL	i didn't wanna do trace-* because that feels too unsafe
2016-09-13 04:19:01	hyper_ch	I like deleting with *

2016-09-13 04:19:48	hyper_ch	maybe something like this:   rm trace-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]*    no real clue if that works though

2016-09-13 04:20:32	JyZyXEL	ill try that one
2016-09-13 04:20:38	hyper_ch	it's probably wrong
2016-09-13 04:20:40	hyper_ch	!..
2016-09-13 04:20:47	hyper_ch	!seq
2016-09-13 04:20:47	greybot	seq(1) is nonstandard, inefficient and useless. For bash2.04+/zsh/ksh93, use for ((i = 1; i <= 10; i++)); do ..., for POSIX and other shells, see !counting
2016-09-13 04:20:53	hyper_ch	hmmm :(
2016-09-13 04:21:26	JyZyXEL	no it actually works

2016-09-13 04:22:09	hyper_ch	another option would be to loop through all files, split at the "-" using IFS, check the second part if it's a number
2016-09-13 04:22:20	JyZyXEL	@daily               bash -c 'rm -f /home/jyz/trace-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]*'
2016-09-13 04:22:38	JyZyXEL	i just wanted something to get rid of all the random trace files that end up in my home dir

2016-09-13 08:59:53	tesaf	Single quotes — protect the text inside them so that it has a literal meaning. With them, generally any kind of interpretation by Bash is ignored: special characters are passed over and multiple words are prevented from being split.

2016-09-13 12:36:59	greybot	nohup is a hacky wrapper that will execute a process while redirecting its output and preventing SIGHUP from reaching it (some implementations ignore additional signals). In bash, you probably want disown instead: ''command ... & disown''. Alternately, run your commands inside screen or tmux.

2016-09-13 21:02:12	beantaxi	In this case both are true - shebang is set and /bin/bash directly executes the script. However, though I have no parallel docs saying so, I'm guessing parallel just uses $SHELL. Tbh I thought that was set by bash, whenever it ran a script, but it is not.

They should *always* be quoted. See: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/073 and "Parameter Expansion" in man bash. Also see http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/pe.

2016-09-14 07:25:28	Muted	Hi, I'm trying to get the number of occurances of the lines in file A that are not contained in file B. I currently have comm -23 <(sort log/action.txt) <(sort log/baseline.txt | uniq) | uniq -c but if a line occurs 10 times in file A and 4 times in file B, the line should be removed instead of having a count of 6. Is there an easy way to accomplish this?

2016-09-14 14:44:20	greybot	joaumg: sh is NOT bash. It is a POSIX/bourne shell. To run bash code, your script MUST have #!/bin/bash at the top and it MUST be either executed directly or with bash (ie. NOT sh myscript). Some /bin/sh link to bash, you cannot rely on this and it will disable most bash features. http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/Practices#Choose_Your_Shell
2016-09-14 14:44:22	joaumg	Even changing the shebang, same output.

2016-10-02 09:05:51	darrend	hello, is there a way to make a function globally available?  I tried adding one to a file in /etc/profile.d/ and also directly in my ~/.bashrc but although I can access this from any terminal, it's not available to scripts I invoke. What should I do to make it accessible from any bash script?

All other variable names should be lowercase. Since variable names are case-sensitive, this convention avoids accidentally overriding environmental and internal variables.

Or `sudo bash -c 'env | sort'` doesn't sort at all, outputs the same as `sudo bash -c 'env'`. Entering a root shell with `sudo bash` and doing the same commands works as expected.
