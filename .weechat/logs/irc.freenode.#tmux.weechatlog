2016-09-09 00:11:40	Nei	it was designed that way
2016-09-09 00:14:09	ij	kakashiAL, The -t is very consistent. For some other commands there are ambiguities, so it's required, but in this case it just would be a little surprising if it wouldn't work that way.
2016-09-09 00:15:06	kakashiAL	Nei, ij: is there a deeper meaning or philosophy why its designed that way?
2016-09-09 00:15:59	ij	Wasn't twhat I said pretty deep already? I should say that I'm speculating even though convincingly.
2016-09-09 00:16:35	kakashiAL	ij: it will not work if you dont use the -t, you will get this error:   usage: kill-session [-a] [-t target-session]
2016-09-09 00:17:22	ij	Well the same way you can't delete directories with «rm» without «-r» — it's for safety.
2016-09-09 00:17:22	kakashiAL	ij: I still dont understand why -t is needed :(
2016-09-09 00:17:38	Nei	it's consistent in that other commands also use -t
2016-09-09 00:18:23	Nei	that way you know always -t and need not remember which command requires ut and which not
2016-09-09 00:18:33	kakashiAL	Nei: sure, but its not needed, I mean it like "killall firefox"  <---its clear, the first word describes what I want to do, and the second word descirbes the object

2016-09-09 00:23:40	Nei	there's no right or wrong, it could be modeled also with a mixture of commands requiring -t and others directly taking the target
2016-09-09 00:23:41	kakashiAL	ij, Nei: it doesnt make sense because its like saying: "you are using -t, you are using the verbose syntax, because everything uses that"
2016-09-09 00:23:57	ij	It's not so overly verbose. It's like three letters.
2016-09-09 00:24:23	ij	By that measure you could also ommit vowels, because you can guess them most of the time.
2016-09-09 00:24:42	kakashiAL	okay, I see it than in this way:
2016-09-09 00:24:44	Nei	each has its merits, the always-t is consistent, the sometimes-t is shorter by 3 chars
2016-09-09 00:25:16	Nei	also it doesn't really matter what you see :-)
2016-09-09 00:25:23	kakashiAL	tmux has many options, each option has also extra arguments, like:  tmux option argument
2016-09-09 00:25:24	ij	Nei, Right! And a choice has been made and that's that.
2016-09-09 00:25:38	kakashiAL	to keep it consitent every command follows this rule
2016-09-09 00:25:42	kakashiAL	even kill-ession
2016-09-09 00:25:51	kakashiAL	Nei, ij: thanks!

2016-09-09 09:19:35	toogley	Fernando-Basso: if you want to start vim in a tmux session/window, you can that directly in the tmux command, or right after that. without the need for using send-keys.
2016-09-09 09:20:08	toogley	i.e. you should be able to type just "vim" after line 19.
2016-09-09 09:20:16	toogley	to start vim in that window, i think.

2016-09-10 00:39:00	Fernando-Basso	I thought my problem was solved yesterday, but I was wrong.
2016-09-10 00:39:40	Fernando-Basso	tmux send-keys $'vim\n' from the shell script does nothing. It works if I run that from the interactive shell.
2016-09-10 00:41:04	Fernando-Basso	This works: tmux new-session -d -s 'foo' -c "$dir" vim, but if I happen to close vim the tmux window goes away as well (that is why I prefer send-keys in this case).
2016-09-10 00:43:47	Fernando-Basso	You can see the comments other places where I tried running send-keys $'vim\n', besides on the last line.
2016-09-10 00:43:50	Fernando-Basso	http://sprunge.us/cZEY?bash
2016-09-10 00:45:27	Fernando-Basso	If I try to run emacs on foo:0, then emacs does not open, and vim in foo:1 works.
2016-09-10 00:45:37	Fernando-Basso	So, my problem is starting an app on foo:0.

2016-09-10 01:13:54	Fernando-Basso	I had "set -g status-utf8 on" on ~/.tmux.conf that I use on my xubuntu machine. But on my arch linux machine that option is "unknon", printing an error on foo:0, preventing the vim\n keys to work on foo:0.

2016-09-10 02:06:12	guardian	it means window title detection is already broken at that point
2016-09-10 02:06:32	guardian	not a symlink (and readlink -f is GNU btw)

2016-09-10 09:40:46	arooni	hey folks;  so someone in this channel helped me by sharing https://gist.github.com/66e6ee03431f32edcbcbab8c8c5a6490 ;; which i alias ta session_name to.  (tmux_attach_or_new) ;  it works ok but i noticed that tmux ls lists about 8 open sessions with no attached clients.  is there a problem with these accumulating?  the desire is to have multiple terminals instances able to conenct to the same session
2016-09-10 09:41:12	arooni	ah ntnn it was you who helped me out apparently :P
2016-09-10 09:41:18	ntnn	ye
2016-09-10 09:41:41	ntnn	are those opened session grouped?

2016-09-10 09:42:17	ntnn	yes, they are
2016-09-10 09:42:20	arooni	man i really like piping things to the gist command line tool;  super useful
2016-09-10 09:42:22	ntnn	they aren't being killed properly
2016-09-10 09:42:42	arooni	ntnn: did i butcher what you wrote?  i may have modified it a bit
2016-09-10 09:42:49	arooni	obviously not well :P

2016-09-10 09:45:29	ntnn	the shuf line is good though
2016-09-10 09:45:39	arooni	shuf line?

2016-09-10 09:46:22	arooni	ah yes
2016-09-10 09:46:44	ntnn	mhm, but not part of the posix spec
2016-09-10 09:48:59	ntnn	i think you're getting the orphaned grouped sessions because of L61-66
2016-09-10 09:48:59		[09:48]
2016-09-10 09:49:24	arooni	i just replaced what i had with the latest on your server
2016-09-10 09:49:29	arooni	and im still getting orphaned sessions
2016-09-10 09:49:35	ntnn	mhm
2016-09-10 09:49:37	arooni	do i need to completely kill all sessions
2016-09-10 09:49:39	arooni	first ?
2016-09-10 09:50:02	ntnn	well, are new orphaned sessions coming up when attaching and detaching?
2016-09-10 09:50:13	arooni	also when i try to move windows; i'm seeing  "Can't move window,  session is grouped"
2016-09-10 09:50:41	ntnn	that'd be a limitation of grouped sessions
2016-09-10 09:51:42	arooni	so your   new version has grouped sessions?
2016-09-10 09:51:46	arooni	whereas the one i was using befoer didnt?
2016-09-10 09:51:48	arooni	before
2016-09-10 09:52:18	ntnn	it had grouped sessions before too
2016-09-10 09:53:03	arooni	ok i killed all the other sessions and i can move windows around again
2016-09-10 09:53:27	ntnn	also, the `if command -v tmuxifier` line isn't needed, the if will fail automatically if tmuxifier isn't installed
2016-09-10 09:53:39	arooni	ah good call
2016-09-10 09:53:46	arooni	i can comment that out; since i dont use tmuxifier currently
2016-09-10 09:54:08	arooni	your new version works great; killing orphaned sesssions immediately
2016-09-10 09:54:16	ntnn	goodie
2016-09-10 09:54:30	arooni	thanks for making my life better ;P
2016-09-10 09:54:39	ntnn	it's a pleasure
2016-09-10 09:55:34	arooni	well looks like youre testing tmuxifier exists before you call it?
2016-09-10 09:56:22	ntnn	not that i'd know
2016-09-10 09:56:42	arooni	ah ; in my case i dont have tmuxifier installed; and it seems to run fine

2016-09-11 00:56:42	Fernando-Basso	Is it possible to create a tmux command that when I invoke it would create a new window with a specific nameand run something like irb or ghci?
2016-09-11 01:02:00		[00:56]
2016-09-11 01:05:24	ntnn	Fernando-Basso: not a tmux command, but you could override tmux to a script which would search for tmux-% in your path, run that and otherwise pass the arguments directly to tmux
2016-09-11 01:09:05	Fernando-Basso	I am sorry but I didn't understand "run that". You mean a shell/tmux script?

2016-09-11 07:04:56	ntnn	if the files create the sessions detached, yes
2016-09-11 07:05:53	kerananw	sorry, i'm not getting it? Do you mean to add a detach command after calling a session?
2016-09-11 07:06:03	kerananw	*calling the first session?
2016-09-11 07:06:09	ntnn	no, i mean adding -d to the new-session command
2016-09-11 07:06:51	kerananw	ah, alright. Thanks. I will try this one out.

2016-09-12 05:43:32	Korhoset	Well because like when the last session exited and you create a new session the daemon is started in the environment where you created the new session
2016-09-12 05:43:55	Korhoset	And I keep finding out about new environment variables I have to add to 'update environment' to ensure stuff does not go wrong.

2016-09-12 06:16:24	nicm	hmm
2016-09-12 06:16:50	nicm	thomas_adam: there is an irritating problem with hooks
2016-09-12 06:17:33	nicm	if i do: tmux set-hook after-split-window 'display'
2016-09-12 06:17:36	nicm	or neww or similarr
2016-09-12 06:17:45	nicm	then it will show the previous pane
2016-09-12 06:17:58	nicm	ie the cur pane before splitw
2016-09-12 06:18:13	nicm	which is obviously wrong and not useful for splitw
2016-09-12 06:18:24	nicm	i can fix this by re-prepareing the state before the after hook
2016-09-12 06:18:36	nicm	which will parse the target again and in this case get the new cur win
2016-09-12 06:19:08	nicm	the problem with that, is that it will be incorrect for commands which do want the old target
2016-09-12 06:19:55	nicm	say you had done movew or joinp or suchlike with a target, you'd want the after hook to continue to use that target, not parse it again which could get a different pane
2016-09-12 06:20:24	nicm	i think we may need a mechanism for commands which changed the cur pane to say so
2016-09-12 06:20:34	nicm	i had code to do that at one point i think

2016-09-12 08:01:39	dx	also proper fontconfig fallback support
2016-09-12 08:02:21	thomas_adam	Well, regardless, xterm is the reference terminal.  Last I checked, st was way, way, way, way, below this point.
2016-09-12 08:03:22	dx	i haven't noticed anything wrong with it other than the endless discussion about backspace and delete
2016-09-12 08:03:53	dx	(which i just solved on my side by editing the config)

2016-09-13 00:35:29	libin_v	I am using tmux on OSX Terminal app. When I quit & launch Terminal(ie with a tmux session still running) and launch tmux again, my keyboard freezes on tmux. Has any one faced this issue?
2016-09-13 00:36:07	depesz	libin_v: the previous client is still attached, detach it. ctrl-b shfit-d, and detach older session
2016-09-13 00:38:15	libin_v	depesz: But I would like to attach to the old session when I launch tmux again. BTW when I kill-session and launch tmux again there is no issue.
2016-09-13 00:38:44	depesz	sorry, wrong word. detrach old client
2016-09-13 00:38:54	depesz	clearly when you close terminal, it doesn't kill tmux *client*
2016-09-13 00:39:07	depesz	and tmux server thinks that client is still attached. so you have to detach it.
2016-09-13 00:39:16	depesz	keeping session is irrelevant
2016-09-13 00:39:38	depesz	or, don't "quit and relaunch terminal" if you had tmux running in it.

2016-09-13 00:56:07	depesz	should
2016-09-13 00:56:11	depesz	i mean, not kill, detach.
2016-09-13 00:56:20	depesz	try, and you'll see.

2016-09-15 06:46:12	Petruchio	Hi. I'm having trouble configuring keys on tmux on a remote server. Specifically, stuff like `bind-key -rn C-Up select-pane -U` isn't working.

2016-09-15 06:46:53	Petruchio	Using ^v to check it out, it looks like within the tmux session control-up and up are the same.
2016-09-15 06:47:16	Glanzmann	Hello, when a process ends in tmux it says 'Pane is dead'. Is it possible to also show the timestamp it went dead similiar to screen: === Command terminated with signal 2 (Sun Jul 31 19:18:50 2016) ===
2016-09-15 06:50:20	Petruchio	Within tmux, control-up and up are both coming across as [[A. Outside, they are [OA and [[A respectively.

2016-09-15 06:51:14	Petruchio	Also, I'm using Putty to connect, at the moment. Searching around, it seemed like that was important in some cases.

2016-09-15 06:52:43	ntnn	well, is there a problem with that?

2016-09-15 06:55:36	ntnn	does term match your terminal outside of tmux and is screen* or tmux* inside of tmux?
2016-09-15 06:55:39	Petruchio	Shift-arrow sequences aren't, either.

2016-09-15 12:48:14	sadbox	With tmux 1.8 I was able to use something like
2016-09-15 12:48:26	sadbox	#10W
2016-09-15 12:48:31	Nei	the syntax changed I think
2016-09-15 12:48:37	sadbox	To truncate the length of the window title
2016-09-15 12:51:15	sadbox	Sweet, that's it
2016-09-15 12:51:35	sadbox	#{=10:window_name}
2016-09-15 12:52:27	aauren	sadbox: For your reference in the future, that's described in the FORMATS section of the man page

2016-09-15 13:04:18	nicm	i don't have it in any of my trees anyway
2016-09-15 13:04:22	nicm	it may be on an issue
2016-09-15 13:04:26	nicm	but i can't spot it
2016-09-15 13:05:04	nicm	it was someone being a fusspot about something so i wasn't taking it too seriously
2016-09-15 13:05:18	nicm	i don't tihnk it was finished anyway
2016-09-15 13:05:58	nicm	and i think it was before the prepare stuff
2016-09-15 13:06:35	nicm	iirc basically it put a "current" struct in the cmdq like we have now and let the commands update it
2016-09-15 13:06:48	nicm	so neww w/o -d would update it, splitw etc

2016-09-15 13:08:23	nicm	i think it'd be even easier now since i think you'd just call cmd_find_from_winlink, maybe adding a flag so it tried to use the same client/session as before if possible
2016-09-15 13:08:55	nicm	i would be keen for this to work since i want to remove set-remain-on-exit
2016-09-15 13:09:44	nicm	ie replace it with set-hook after-new-window 'set remain-on-exit on'
2016-09-15 13:09:55	nicm	maybe a window-created hook instead but you get the idea
2016-09-15 13:10:10	nicm	we still need to resolve what is happening with hooks and notifies
2016-09-15 13:10:10		[13:10]
2016-09-15 13:10:18	nicm	i need to write a list of the stuff i want to do that is outstanding
2016-09-15 13:11:03	nicm	a) panning b) hook notifys c) other hook stuff? d) new choose modes e) no more special mode keys tables
2016-09-15 13:11:07	nicm	i guess that is the list

2016-10-02 09:53:02	guardian	at the end of ~/.tmux.conf, I have a run-shell command that does more configuring. From there, I would like to detect whether tmux has a version supported by my conf and if not, display-message

2016-10-02 09:55:43	thomas_adam	We don't have a hook for that, but I'd go with the first session anyway, since that's how causes are rendered if there are any.

2016-10-03 03:28:18	seventh__	hi all, I am now starting with Tmux ! I think it's an amazing too to use... althought I am having issues using it... I am not sure about how to split a pane horizontally - and when I succeed to do so I have no clue how to go from 1 application to another... here is my config file (that I took from dotshare.it)... i am using a swiss-french keyboard if that helps.. ?
2016-10-03 03:28:20	seventh__	https://gist.github.com/a9332636e97f3dd0a693f7e2dec778ee
2016-10-03 03:28:56	seventh__	i understood that with Crl+A, I can move from 1 pane to another...
2016-10-03 03:29:38	seventh__	any help will be greatly appreciated
2016-10-03 03:30:05	confuseAcat	why start out with such a long config file?
2016-10-03 03:30:34	ntnn	somone for the pandajail, i reckon
2016-10-03 03:31:03	confuseAcat	seventh__: create horizontal splits with c-a "
2016-10-03 03:31:20	seventh__	confuseAcat: no it just changes pane
2016-10-03 03:31:34	seventh__	so far I have 2 : 1 with weechat and another one with htop
2016-10-03 03:31:48	seventh__	c-a brings me from one to another
2016-10-03 03:32:10	confuseAcat	c-a by itself shoudn't do anything at all
2016-10-03 03:32:40	ntnn	he's bound prefix+^a to last-window
2016-10-03 03:33:17	confuseAcat	a conscious choice, I suppose
2016-10-03 03:33:22	seventh__	shall I remove from the config file all the unbind / bind
2016-10-03 03:33:24	seventh__	yes
2016-10-03 03:33:27	seventh__	and start over ?
2016-10-03 03:33:49	confuseAcat	that would be my recommendation
2016-10-03 03:34:10	confuseAcat	don't add anything to your config when you don't know what it does and why you want it.
2016-10-03 03:34:10	ntnn	ye, and read the man page carefully while trying to use the defaults
2016-10-03 03:34:38	seventh__	can I edit tmux.conf while in a tmux ?
2016-10-03 03:34:44	confuseAcat	sure
2016-10-03 03:34:45	seventh__	does the changes take effect ?
2016-10-03 03:35:04	ntnn	the defaults are pretty reasonable and well-suited for general use, so unless you have a deformed hand or something it should be good to use.
2016-10-03 03:35:15	ntnn	no, you hav to run `tmux source ~/.tmux.conf` for the changes to apply
2016-10-03 03:35:35	seventh__	ok
2016-10-03 03:35:39	seventh__	will give a run
2016-10-03 03:35:44	ntnn	though that is only additive. if you've bound something before and removed that bind from the file it won't unbind
2016-10-03 03:36:10	seventh__	ok be right bacck then
2016-10-03 03:36:16	seventh__	gotta close this tmux

2016-10-03 03:36:20	ntnn	iirc there was something that'd cause tmux to reset to default, maybe `tmux source /dev/null`? dunno. either way surefire way is to kill the server
2016-10-03 03:36:44	-->	seventh__ (~seventh__@62.102.148.187) has joined #tmux
2016-10-03 03:38:17	seventh__	ok I have removed the keybinds from the conf file
2016-10-03 03:39:12	seventh__	when I run tmux source .tmux.conf it get "no server running on /tmp/tmux-1000/default"
2016-10-03 03:39:33	ntnn	have you started tmux?
2016-10-03 03:39:33		[03:39]

2016-10-03 03:41:46	seventh__	from the man
2016-10-03 03:41:59	seventh__	but when i c or Ctrl+c it doesnt create a new window
2016-10-03 03:42:18	ntnn	all binds tmux has are accessed with prefix
2016-10-03 03:42:26	seventh__	Ctrl+b ?
2016-10-03 03:42:27	ntnn	which is ^a by default
2016-10-03 03:42:34	ntnn	or ^b, ye
2016-10-03 03:42:42	ntnn	^a was screen <.<
