2016-09-18 00:51:05	digitok	grep doesn't use pcre unless you use -P (Perl mode) does it?
2016-09-18 00:51:24	+lopid	right, it uses BRE afaik
2016-09-18 00:51:38	digitok	php's regex is quite fully feature
2016-09-18 00:51:39	digitok	+d
2016-09-18 00:51:55	digitok	it supports most of Perl's regex features
2016-09-18 00:56:18	regex101-6516	yes correct
2016-09-18 00:56:42	regex101-6516	although grep's P flag is apparently not particularly reliable
2016-09-18 00:56:57	+lopid	not so portable
2016-09-18 00:56:58	regex101-6516	so its more recommended fr you to use pcregrep instead

2016-09-18 09:13:53	Lindrian	[15:05:08] Anyway, feel free to open an issue on it and see what people think. [15:05:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:06:41] it's a lazy reason i guess [15:06:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:07:03] i just don't want to open a new tab if i have a tab on regex101 already [15:07:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Lindrian	[15:07:37] What is with you and opening tabs? [15:07:37]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:07:38] so i just go there and edit, but of course it's totally something else so i don't want to save the current link [15:07:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Lindrian	[15:07:41] why do you need to open more tabs? [15:07:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:07:53] no i don't here [15:07:53]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Lindrian	[15:07:56] Its a single page application [15:07:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:09:40] well if you read what i said [15:09:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:10:35] alright i guess i can elaborate a bit [15:10:35]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[15:57:56] I'm sure this is easy but let's say I wanted to match "\bOPL\b" as long as it isn't preceded by a two character string [15:57:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[15:58:26] so something like "BLUE OPL" would match but "AA OPL" would not [15:58:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:02:03] https://regex101.com/r/uS1cN1/1 [16:02:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:03:04] eh, add you \b's in, too O:) [16:03:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:03:07] your [16:03:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:07:28] that's exactly what I have and it's not working [16:07:28]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:07:30] hmm [16:07:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:07:44] in what environment? [16:07:44]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:08:01] python3 [16:08:01]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:08:30] hmm [16:08:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:08:33] tried this? https://regex101.com/r/uS1cN1/1#python [16:08:33]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:08:40] so I have a \b between OPL and the negative look behind [16:08:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:08:44] apparently that is messing it up [16:08:44]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:09:09] you have this? https://regex101.com/r/uS1cN1/2 [16:09:09]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:09:20] the \b is redundant there [16:09:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:11:34] https://regex101.com/r/dQ4oV4/1 [16:11:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:11:52] curious why the \b is causing a problem [16:11:52]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:12:01] because I also want to match "OPL" [16:12:01]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:12:10] the \b is non-thingy - it doesn't represent a character [16:12:10]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[16:12:21] because you don't deal with the space [16:12:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:13:04] ok right so \b is zero space [16:13:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[16:13:18] zero width yes [16:13:18]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	 *	lopid [16:13:42] reboots [16:13:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[16:14:10] https://regex101.com/r/dQ4oV4/3 [16:14:10]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[16:14:24] but yes, some \b are not useful here i believe [16:14:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[16:14:53] https://regex101.com/r/dQ4oV4/4 [16:14:53]

2016-09-18 13:24:38	+lopid	[21:10:40] substitution? [21:10:40]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	regex101-0982	[21:10:43] the reason I want to check is basically because of this; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39421580/multiline-regex-how-to-skip-lines-to-the-end-of-last-match [21:10:43]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	regex101-0982	[21:11:37] -o flag appears to do more than what seems intuitive [21:11:37]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_slade_	[21:14:43] Is there a more efficient way of matching two words separated by anything than / \b word1 \b .* \b word2 \b /x? [21:14:43]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	regex101-0982	[21:16:07] i think making * operator lazy would be more efficient? [21:16:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	+lyxia	[21:19:48] indeed [21:19:48]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_slade_	[21:22:44] Yeah, it's a bit faster. I'm prematurely optimizing anyway, which I should stop doing. [21:22:44]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	+Zarthus	[21:33:11] _slade_: can't prematurely optimize when using regex ;) [21:33:11]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	+Zarthus	[21:34:04] no need for a space between \b either [21:34:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_slade_	[21:36:24] That was just for readability. [21:36:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	+Zarthus	[21:42:57] for us, or yourself? [21:42:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	+Zarthus	[21:43:11] If you want readability you can save the regex101 thing and link it [21:43:11]
