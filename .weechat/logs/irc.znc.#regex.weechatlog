2016-09-18 00:51:05	digitok	grep doesn't use pcre unless you use -P (Perl mode) does it?
2016-09-18 00:51:24	+lopid	right, it uses BRE afaik
2016-09-18 00:51:38	digitok	php's regex is quite fully feature
2016-09-18 00:51:39	digitok	+d
2016-09-18 00:51:55	digitok	it supports most of Perl's regex features
2016-09-18 00:56:18	regex101-6516	yes correct
2016-09-18 00:56:42	regex101-6516	although grep's P flag is apparently not particularly reliable
2016-09-18 00:56:57	+lopid	not so portable
2016-09-18 00:56:58	regex101-6516	so its more recommended fr you to use pcregrep instead

2016-09-18 09:13:53	Lindrian	[15:05:08] Anyway, feel free to open an issue on it and see what people think. [15:05:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:06:41] it's a lazy reason i guess [15:06:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:07:03] i just don't want to open a new tab if i have a tab on regex101 already [15:07:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Lindrian	[15:07:37] What is with you and opening tabs? [15:07:37]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:07:38] so i just go there and edit, but of course it's totally something else so i don't want to save the current link [15:07:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Lindrian	[15:07:41] why do you need to open more tabs? [15:07:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:07:53] no i don't here [15:07:53]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Lindrian	[15:07:56] Its a single page application [15:07:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:09:40] well if you read what i said [15:09:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:10:35] alright i guess i can elaborate a bit [15:10:35]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[15:57:56] I'm sure this is easy but let's say I wanted to match "\bOPL\b" as long as it isn't preceded by a two character string [15:57:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[15:58:26] so something like "BLUE OPL" would match but "AA OPL" would not [15:58:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:02:03] https://regex101.com/r/uS1cN1/1 [16:02:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:03:04] eh, add you \b's in, too O:) [16:03:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:03:07] your [16:03:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:07:28] that's exactly what I have and it's not working [16:07:28]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:07:30] hmm [16:07:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:07:44] in what environment? [16:07:44]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:08:01] python3 [16:08:01]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:08:30] hmm [16:08:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:08:33] tried this? https://regex101.com/r/uS1cN1/1#python [16:08:33]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:08:40] so I have a \b between OPL and the negative look behind [16:08:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:08:44] apparently that is messing it up [16:08:44]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:09:09] you have this? https://regex101.com/r/uS1cN1/2 [16:09:09]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:09:20] the \b is redundant there [16:09:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:11:34] https://regex101.com/r/dQ4oV4/1 [16:11:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:11:52] curious why the \b is causing a problem [16:11:52]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:12:01] because I also want to match "OPL" [16:12:01]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:12:10] the \b is non-thingy - it doesn't represent a character [16:12:10]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[16:12:21] because you don't deal with the space [16:12:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:13:04] ok right so \b is zero space [16:13:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[16:13:18] zero width yes [16:13:18]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	 *	lopid [16:13:42] reboots [16:13:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[16:14:10] https://regex101.com/r/dQ4oV4/3 [16:14:10]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[16:14:24] but yes, some \b are not useful here i believe [16:14:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[16:14:53] https://regex101.com/r/dQ4oV4/4 [16:14:53]

2016-09-18 13:24:38	regex101-0982	[21:11:37] -o flag appears to do more than what seems intuitive [21:11:37]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_slade_	[21:14:43] Is there a more efficient way of matching two words separated by anything than / \b word1 \b .* \b word2 \b /x? [21:14:43]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	regex101-0982	[21:16:07] i think making * operator lazy would be more efficient? [21:16:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	+lyxia	[21:19:48] indeed [21:19:48]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_slade_	[21:22:44] Yeah, it's a bit faster. I'm prematurely optimizing anyway, which I should stop doing. [21:22:44]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	+Zarthus	[21:33:11] _slade_: can't prematurely optimize when using regex ;) [21:33:11]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	+Zarthus	[21:34:04] no need for a space between \b either [21:34:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_slade_	[21:36:24] That was just for readability. [21:36:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	+Zarthus	[21:42:57] for us, or yourself? [21:42:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	+Zarthus	[21:43:11] If you want readability you can save the regex101 thing and link it [21:43:11]

2016-09-18 19:44:17	digitok	something like that is much more efficient
2016-09-18 19:44:46	digitok	you really need to anchor the start of the pattern to something
2016-09-18 19:44:56	digitok	since [^"] will match at almost every position
2016-09-18 19:45:02	digitok	hence it times out in my browser

2016-09-18 19:45:33	digitok	i'd prefer version 3 as long as it's always href attribute
2016-09-18 19:45:37	digitok	10x quicker
2016-09-18 19:45:44	+lopid	me too
2016-09-18 19:45:50	digitok	but you can always account for more than just href
2016-09-18 19:46:28	digitok	even just anchoring it to =" cuts it by half
2016-09-18 19:46:43	digitok	but if you know the attribute possibilites that'd be preferrable

2016-09-18 19:53:54	Druid05	*
2016-09-18 19:54:29	digitok	if your regex starts with ", the engine will go until it finds a " and then check each char to see if the rest of the pattern matches
2016-09-18 19:54:42	+lopid	fewer steps
2016-09-18 19:56:14	Druid05	But in my example, i find a filename in text, where filename is *filename and is between " " or ' ' or ( )
2016-09-18 19:56:31	Druid05	is not possible in some way, to check where is *filename position first and check after if is true between " " or  ' ' or ()
2016-09-18 19:56:39	digitok	no
2016-09-18 19:56:51	Druid05	in this way will search directly "multiple words" segment
2016-09-18 19:56:52	Druid05	no?
2016-09-18 19:57:04	digitok	that might be possible in .NET as a believe it handles variable-length lookbehinds
2016-09-18 19:57:13	digitok	but not in any other language
2016-09-18 19:57:37	digitok	surely you can figure out which attributes it could possible exist in
2016-09-18 19:57:46	digitok	possibly*
2016-09-18 19:58:03	Druid05	maybe if i try first time, to see if my word is in text, and only after to check it with regex :-?

2016-09-18 19:58:54	Druid05	so if myword is not in myContent, i will skip some useless steps
2016-09-18 19:59:16	digitok	but yeh you could use python's string functions first to check for '9f.css' if you like

2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:15:49] you'll want to single quote that regex [10:15:49]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:16:04] can you fit more options in? [10:16:04]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:17:17] lol [10:17:17]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:17:21] grep -a-z [10:17:21]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lyxia	[10:18:22] you're missing upper case options [10:18:22]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:19:05] grep -A-Za-z [10:19:05]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	acetakwas	[10:19:55] Okay thanks [10:19:55]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:20:14] grep -EHIin '[[:digit:]]{8}7012' <<<123456787012 [10:20:14]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lyxia	[10:24:17] or use -P [10:24:17]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	acetakwas	[10:26:38] What's -P [10:26:38]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	acetakwas	[10:26:47] You mean -EHIinP [10:26:47]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lyxia	[10:26:54] no -P instead of -E [10:26:54]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	acetakwas	[10:26:59] Okay [10:26:59]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:27:00] man grep. but beware, it's less portable [10:27:00]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lyxia	[10:27:57] \d is not in POSIX regex [10:27:57]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lyxia	[10:28:33] -P is an extension of PCRE which has \d [10:28:33]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:29:44] -P is actually Perl regex [10:29:44]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:29:50] isn't it [10:29:50]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:29:58] man grep and find out! [10:29:58]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:30:05] meaning it actually utilizes perl [10:30:05]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:30:11] atleast that's what i assume [10:30:11]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:30:26] in which case it would even include perl-only features [10:30:26]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:30:40] it does not run perl [10:30:40]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:30:49] ah k [10:30:49]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:31:05] it will probably use libpcre or have its own interpretation of it [10:31:05]

2016-09-20 01:28:32	Aristy	this.config = {
2016-09-20 01:28:32	Aristy	        endpoint: "http://192.168.2.37:8100"

2016-09-20 01:28:46	Aristy	I want to replace the URL with gulp task
2016-09-20 01:28:59	Aristy	I can do it like this: .pipe(replace(/foo(.{3})/g, '$1foo'))
2016-09-20 01:29:06	Aristy	What kind of regex should I write?
2016-09-20 01:29:24	Aristy	It looks like black magic so I'm a bit confused :p
2016-09-20 01:32:06	digitok	replace(/endpoint: "[^"]+"/,'endpoint: "foo"') ?

2016-09-20 01:41:22	digitok	or are single quotes allowed inside double and vice versa?
2016-09-20 01:41:25	digitok	or is it always a url

2016-09-20 01:42:03	Aristy	It can be '...' or "..."
2016-09-20 01:43:02	Aristy	Nvm I added another replace pipe and replaced " with '
2016-09-20 01:43:04	digitok	right but do you need to validate that

2016-09-20 03:47:16	xpistos	Hey all I could use a little help with a regex command. I am trying to get the  data I pulled from curl (curl http://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/profile/xpistos/pull-list)  so it will give me the following information,  Aquaman #7 (tab) DC Comic (tab ) Sep 21st, 2016. Can anyone give me a hand? http://pastebin.com/njeUyrYk
2016-09-20 03:48:12	xpistos	I have been able to get just the comic names and issue number using sed -E 's/<[^<>]*>//g'
2016-09-20 03:48:29	+lyxia	looks like something I'd rather do with a HTML parser
2016-09-20 03:49:13	xpistos	lyxia: The only problem is I am not sure how to do that so I can automate it 
2016-09-20 03:51:23	+Zarthus	ask them to create an API
2016-09-20 03:54:21	+lyxia	http://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/api -> "invalid API key" it seems there is one, though probably for internal use.
2016-09-20 03:55:51	+lyxia	can you do multiline substitution with sed?
2016-09-20 03:56:13	xpistos	not really sure. I am kinda of a newb still learning

2016-09-20 13:07:23	+Ouims	i didn't mean this
2016-09-20 13:07:35	+Ouims	i mean you can check the result of your fix
2016-09-20 13:07:47	+Ouims	because it's fairly simple here
2016-09-20 13:07:57	Lindrian	if you dont want to verify just dont

2016-09-20 14:19:16	stranglerfish	hello
2016-09-20 14:19:21	+OnlineCop	Hi.
2016-09-20 14:21:15	stranglerfish	I'm hoping someone can give me a hand with a regex crossword. I've gotten a fair bit into this site but it offers little explanation, and I'm confused about a certain part. the regex is (.)(.)\2\1 and I don't understand what the \2\1 signify
2016-09-20 14:21:23	stranglerfish	https://regexcrossword.com/challenges/experienced/puzzles/3
2016-09-20 14:21:44	<--	morenoh149 (~harry@69.12.26.166) has quit (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
2016-09-20 14:21:48	stranglerfish	that's the puzzle I'm working on, i've got basically the 1st quadrant of it complete, the simple parts
2016-09-20 14:22:11	+Zarthus	hehe, (.)(.) will never get old
2016-09-20 14:22:56	-->	karakedi (~eAC53C340@unaffiliated/orphan) has joined #regex
2016-09-20 14:22:57	+Zarthus	(.)(.) matches two any characters, the first capturing group is \1, the second capturing group is \2
2016-09-20 14:23:20	+Zarthus	so if your string is "saas", it'll match. if it's "sasa" it won't.
2016-09-20 14:23:45	stranglerfish	one sec i gotta look up capturing group lol
2016-09-20 14:24:22	+Zarthus	(.)(.)\2\1 on test string "abba" basically will transform the string/regex into (.)(.)ba
2016-09-20 14:24:36	+Zarthus	if you don't know capturing groups, I wouldn't worry about how \2 \1 works
2016-09-20 14:24:50	+Zarthus	(they're a bit more advanced than just capturing groups alone)
2016-09-20 14:24:52	stranglerfish	hehe, what should I brush up on then
2016-09-20 14:25:17	stranglerfish	hmm, maybe youtube would have a good visual example?
2016-09-20 14:25:28	+Zarthus	do you not understand my explanation?
2016-09-20 14:25:42	stranglerfish	nope
2016-09-20 14:25:55	+Zarthus	okay, let's ease it up
2016-09-20 14:26:12	stranglerfish	sounds good to me
2016-09-20 14:26:23	+Zarthus	your regex is ([ab])\1  -- you've already learned [ab] matches either a or b
2016-09-20 14:26:49	-->	ctcrnitv (~textual@96-90-249-25-static.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) has joined #regex
2016-09-20 14:26:57	+Zarthus	the capturing group takes note of which character was captured (if the first letter is an 'a', it matches a, if it's 'b' b, and c and beyond don't match)

2016-09-20 14:27:48	+Zarthus	with \1 you look back at what the first capturing group had (for this example, let's go with 'a') - the next character now has to be 'a'
2016-09-20 14:27:48		[14:27]
2016-09-20 14:28:13	+Zarthus	so aa matches, bb matches, but ab or ba doesn't.

2016-09-20 14:29:34	+OnlineCop	stranglerfish: A capture group tells the regex that you want to save what you matched into one slot of an array. Each group of parens creates one more array lot, and stores anything that matches into the corresponding array index.
2016-09-20 14:30:30	+OnlineCop	If you have a single capture group, like  (abc)   then when it matches 'abc' somewhere in the text, it stores that value of  'abc'  in the first array:  MyCaptures[1]

2016-09-20 14:30:54	+OnlineCop	If you add another capture group, it will add another array element:  (abc)(def)  will save  MyCaptures[1] = 
2016-09-20 14:30:56	+OnlineCop	'abc'
2016-09-20 14:31:01	+OnlineCop	and MyCaptures[2] = 'def'

2016-09-20 14:31:32	+OnlineCop	The more groups you add, the more array elements get added.
2016-09-20 14:31:51	+OnlineCop	If you want to refer to the stuff inside of one of the groups, you can use   \1  or  \2  or whatever to access it.
2016-09-20 14:32:07	+OnlineCop	So if you captured   (abc)(def)  and then wanted the  MyCaptures[2]   you would use  \2  to refer to 'def'
2016-09-20 14:32:40	+OnlineCop	When you have   (.)(.)\2\1   it says  MyCaptures[1] = '.', MyCaptures[2] = '.'
2016-09-20 14:32:54	+OnlineCop	Where ('.') is actually any single character: a letter, a space, or whatever.
2016-09-20 14:33:41	+OnlineCop	When it says   \2  then it wants the same value that's in  MyCaptures[2]  to match, so   'abba'  will have  MyCaptures[1] = 'a' and MyCaptures[2] = 'b', so  it matches   MyCaptures[1], MyCaptures[2], MyCaptures[2], and then MyCaptures[1]  in that order.

2016-09-20 14:41:23	+OnlineCop	Notice that I added another '(' at the beginning of the pattern, which shifted all the rest of the array elements down by one.
2016-09-20 14:41:32	+OnlineCop	So  \3\4\3  had to be used instead of  \2\3\2
2016-09-20 14:41:41	stranglerfish	so with (.)T*E*\1 from that crossword. is it the (.) that is the first capture group? not the E*, right?
2016-09-20 14:41:50	+OnlineCop	That's correct.
2016-09-20 14:42:17	+OnlineCop	So it pretty much means that the first and last character is going to be the same character.
2016-09-20 14:42:27	+OnlineCop	But there can be any number of T's followed by any number of E's.

2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:31:50] If you want to refer to the stuff inside of one of the groups, you can use   \1  or  \2  or whatever to access it. [00:31:50]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:32:06] So if you captured   (abc)(def)  and then wanted the  MyCaptures[2]   you would use  \2  to refer to 'def' [00:32:06]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:32:39] When you have   (.)(.)\2\1   it says  MyCaptures[1] = '.', MyCaptures[2] = '.' [00:32:39]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:32:53] Where ('.') is actually any single character: a letter, a space, or whatever. [00:32:53]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:33:40] When it says   \2  then it wants the same value that's in  MyCaptures[2]  to match, so   'abba'  will have  MyCaptures[1] = 'a' and MyCaptures[2] = 'b', so  it matches   MyCaptures[1], MyCaptures[2], MyCaptures[2], and then MyCaptures[1]  in that order.

2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:41:22] Notice that I added another '(' at the beginning of the pattern, which shifted all the rest of the array elements down by one. [00:41:22]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:41:31] So  \3\4\3  had to be used instead of  \2\3\2 [00:41:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	stranglerfish	[00:41:40] so with (.)T*E*\1 from that crossword. is it the (.) that is the first capture group? not the E*, right? [00:41:40]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:41:49] That's correct. [00:41:49]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:42:16] So it pretty much means that the first and last character is going to be the same character. [00:42:16]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:42:26] But there can be any number of T's followed by any number of E's. [00:42:26]

2016-09-20 18:53:19	stranglerfish	[00:52:28] so * means 0 or more right? (.)T*E*\1 could be (.)EE(.) or (.)TT(.) or (.)TE(.) but not (.)ET(.), correct? [00:52:28]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:52:43] Correct. [00:52:43]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	stranglerfish	[00:53:29] kk. yeah this crossword probably isn't the best learning resource, it doesn't actually explain it just has a reference on the side. so i've been guessing and just figuring out sort of like it's a sudoku, which taught me some stuff but some other stuff i needed to clarify clearly ;) [00:53:29]

2016-09-20 21:40:10	nschoe	Hi all, I'm trying to write a regex that should match a pattern one or more time, so it's the '+' quantifier. But the pattern is "complex", how do I "group" it? What characters should I use to enclose my complex expression to suffix with '+'?
2016-09-20 21:40:33	nschoe	I've tried ( and ), but this is for remembering a match, so I guess I'm doing something wrong
2016-09-20 21:41:01	amenorrhea	(?: and ) will allow you to group but not remember the match.
2016-09-20 21:41:02	nschoe	I've written this so far: https://regex101.com/r/gE6jB1/1 
2016-09-20 21:42:29	nschoe	amenorrhea, thanks for answering. Yes I've seen that, and tried it. Indeed it doesn't remember the match, but that doesn't work either. In my example, the '.Mycompany', '.SomethingElse' and '.AgainSomethingElse' should be matched by the same "pattern", this is the patter nthat I want to repeat
2016-09-20 21:43:26	nschoe	For information, I'm trying to write a regex to match a dBus interface, so it's this form. There must be at least a dot, so that's why I use -
2016-09-20 21:43:35	nschoe	that's why I used '+' and not '*'
2016-09-20 21:44:37	nschoe	But regex101 shows that my whole string is entirely blue, so it seems to be matched by a '\w*' which doesn't make sense: it should not match dots, right?
2016-09-20 21:44:37		[21:44]
2016-09-20 21:44:41	nschoe	\w is alphanumeric
2016-09-20 21:46:11	amenorrhea	I think the colour of the test string has nothing to do with the colours in the expression. 
2016-09-20 21:46:42	amenorrhea	I think there is just colour (light blue) and it highlights the portion(s) of the test string that are matched by the expression.
2016-09-20 21:46:50	amenorrhea	just one colour**
2016-09-20 21:52:00		[21:46]
2016-09-20 21:52:24	nschoe	amenorrhea, hum okay, seems you're right!
2016-09-20 21:53:53	nschoe	amenorrhea, thanks! Damn, since yesterday I had the right regex, I just thought the colors should match!

2016-09-20 22:57:22	+lopid	an update is a save

2016-09-20 22:57:47		[22:57]
2016-09-20 22:58:35	+Doqnach	thing is, it is more a "save-as with context" than an actual "save"
2016-09-20 22:58:48	+Doqnach	since you save it as a new version of an existing one
2016-09-20 22:59:02	+Doqnach	you don't replace the old one
2016-09-20 22:59:20	+Doqnach	personally I understand this choice and have nothing against it
2016-09-20 23:00:12	+lopid	i think from the user's perspective, they use that button in order to send a link to someone else, not really to save it for later use. that it happens to save it behind the scenes is just a means to the user's end

2016-09-21 05:35:27	+lyxia	what
2016-09-21 05:35:49	+lyxia	startingstrig = dontmatch
2016-09-21 05:35:55	+lyxia	startingstrig = dontmatch cat
2016-09-21 05:36:04	+lyxia	should these match
2016-09-21 05:36:19	jeffreylevesque	just the first
2016-09-21 05:36:52	jeffreylevesque	i mean i could always ad `$` at the end of the solution to have better enforcement
2016-09-21 05:37:02	jeffreylevesque	but i don't have a working solution yet for either cases

2016-09-21 05:38:06	+lyxia	isn't that contradictory
2016-09-21 05:38:20	jeffreylevesque	the second shouldn't match
2016-09-21 05:38:29	+lyxia	why not

2016-09-21 05:50:31	jeffreylevesque	this is my original code - https://bpaste.net/show/a70767211905
2016-09-21 05:51:18	jeffreylevesque	so basically, im trying to add 'startingstring = attribute' line, if there exists a line 'startingstring                 = notattribute'
2016-09-21 05:51:47	jeffreylevesque	it replaces "matches" with what's defined in "line"
2016-09-21 05:52:08	jeffreylevesque	have to escape twice for special chars in puppet
2016-09-21 05:52:17	jeffreylevesque	once for puppet
2016-09-21 05:52:41	jeffreylevesque	i didn't escape my paste properly, but it's not right anyways
2016-09-21 05:53:54	jeffreylevesque	i guess the gears aren't turning in my head
2016-09-21 05:53:58	jeffreylevesque	your solution is good
2016-09-21 05:54:32	jeffreylevesque	startingstrig[ \t=]*.*(?<!dontmatch)$

2016-09-21 07:36:02	kbdkode	hallo. I have a lot of regex expressions that get evaluated for my irc bot in succession (for various parts of the raw irc message that get deconstructed and stored into a dict essentially). I was trying to think of a way to speed this up, and my conclusion was to (before the string gets compiled into a regex object when the event handler is being created), try to find the first letter of what the regex object
2016-09-21 07:36:05	kbdkode	would be (if it can be evaluated) and I just wanted to do it right. For example, if it (stupidly) starts with '^', then I could strip that off. If it starts with '.', then I would know that the first character cannot be evaluated. I just wanted to do it right, so what are all of the possibilities for first characters that are unable to be evaluated, if you will?
2016-09-21 07:36:14	+OnlineCop	I don't mind answering questions. If I minded (or when I'm busy), I simply don't log into IRC that day/week.
2016-09-21 07:36:30	kbdkode	if someone has a better idea, then I would gladly take that into consideration.
2016-09-21 07:38:01	+OnlineCop	kbdkode: So your script takes several regexes as input, and you want to essentially combine them into a single pass so it doesn't keep re-evaluating similar anchors and requirements that always return the same result?
2016-09-21 07:39:36	+OnlineCop	Does your regex script allow the (?x) modifier to allow whitespace and comments?
2016-09-21 07:40:50	kbdkode	for example there must be at least 70 or so (currently and growing) compiled reg. expressions (when the bot loads them) for the "message" part raw irc message (when you do "PRIVMSG nick/#chan :message here"). A lot of them start with the '!' or '@' or '.' characters, while some of them (very few) begin with something else. Some of the "message" attributes are not evaluated immediately (if they have "%nick%" -
2016-09-21 07:40:52	kbdkode	the bots current nick in the string before regex evaluation), but that is irrelevant. Hopefully that makes more sense

2016-09-21 07:41:40	kbdkode	my main concern is something like `message = "(msg1|othermsg2)"
2016-09-21 07:41:50	+OnlineCop	Sure. But you're trying to see whether a few regexes can have certain characters removed?  "^.*stuff"  "^.*different stuff"   where the  ^  can be ignored in the 2nd regex?

2016-09-21 07:42:37	kbdkode	no. I am trying to find a way to (if I don't have to) not evaluate a reg. ex. (because I believe it to be a lot slower than checking to see if a string starts with a certain character)
2016-09-21 07:43:28	kbdkode	so I was trying to figure out how to evaluate the potential first characters. Like re. exp. `(hello|bye)` would produce `['h', 'b']`

2016-09-21 07:45:45	kbdkode	those can change the first character as well. This is why I was hoping that someone could help me find all the "gotchas"

2016-09-21 19:07:03	TeamTerradactyl	[22:11:30] why is that an invalid company name? [22:11:30]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	TeamTerradactyl	[22:11:37] from a regex standpoint, that is [22:11:37]

2016-09-22 07:51:18	devslash	I need help understanding how regex works. I want to match part numbers in a string. the part numbers can be in a few different formats like XX-XXXX-XXX or XX-XXXX-X or XX-XXXX any of these parts may have a comma, space or newline at the end. I am trying to write different regex to match all of these scenarios but I dont understand how to write the regex correctly ?
2016-09-22 07:51:57	devslash	in some cases, the same part num is matched multiple times by different expressions in a string because they match either pattern

2016-09-22 10:34:27	+Zarthus	for the latter, no
2016-09-22 10:34:37	ash_workz	well, it doesn't make sense in the context of what I was saying
2016-09-22 10:34:42	ash_workz	I mean for a single line
2016-09-22 10:34:45	ash_workz	to ensure that it has 2 words
2016-09-22 10:34:59	+Zarthus	Word1.*Word2
2016-09-22 10:35:04	ash_workz	no
2016-09-22 10:35:05	ash_workz	(.*(foo|bar)){2}
2016-09-22 10:35:17	+Zarthus	that'll allow foo twice.
2016-09-22 10:35:18	ash_workz	because word1.*word2, order matters
2016-09-22 10:35:25	ash_workz	oh
2016-09-22 10:35:27	ash_workz	yeah
2016-09-22 10:35:28	ash_workz	damn
2016-09-22 10:35:31	+Zarthus	yes, you need two regexes

2016-09-22 10:35:43	regex101-3999	hi
2016-09-22 10:35:46	+Zarthus	Unless you want to do some complex pcre stuff that's not necessary.
2016-09-22 10:35:54	ash_workz	naw
2016-09-22 10:35:55	+Zarthus	Word1.*Word2|Word2.*Word1 is the simple solution.
2016-09-22 10:35:57	ash_workz	thanks though
2016-09-22 10:36:14	+Zarthus	alternatively your programming language of choice is better
2016-09-22 10:36:36	+Zarthus	if (substr_count("Word1", $string) && substr_count("Word2", $string)) {} in PHP, if you don't care about word boundries
2016-09-22 10:37:11	ash_workz	maybe even strpos
2016-09-22 10:37:16	+Zarthus	yeah, works too.
2016-09-22 10:37:36	+Zarthus	it's not hard to figure it out unless you've no idea what you're doing, but if you're working with regex you hopefully do ;)
2016-09-22 10:39:02	regex101-3999	Hey i have a question for the regex nerds in here ;) i have kind of a tree structure looking like this: (ROOT   (SINV     (VP (VBZ hi))     (NP (RB there))))  root(ROOT-0, hi-1) nsubj(hi-1, there-2) and i need the specific items. like (NP (RB there)). the items can vary. it doesnt have to be NP, it could be CC too. how could i do that?

2016-09-22 10:41:00	+Zarthus	I have a feeling those are newlines, and the web client is omitting them.
2016-09-22 10:41:26	sharazam	Hi. I have a problem with https://regex101.com/r/eX9oG0/1
2016-09-22 10:42:01	sharazam	I am trying to get an angular-like data binding. For that, I need the names of the variables as well as pipes.
2016-09-22 10:42:28	sharazam	I can't really figure out why this regex doesn't work.
2016-09-22 10:44:04	sharazam	for example, for {{ng-bind|mutable|my-group}} I want to have three groups: ng-bind, mutable and my-group and the last two should be optional
2016-09-22 10:44:51	sharazam	Language is c++

2016-09-22 10:45:34	+Zarthus	$. is probably wrong in your regex
2016-09-22 10:45:44	+Zarthus	$ is end of line, then you put something after it
2016-09-22 10:46:02	+Zarthus	https://regex101.com/r/eX9oG0/2 looks better already (also added m flag)
2016-09-22 10:47:16	sharazam	thanks. The hardest thing I've found though was matching the third one (with any whitespace and more than two pipes).

2016-09-22 19:50:43	Siegfried	Hi all, I don't know regex, would someone be willing to help me come up with a regex to count instances of the oxford comma in text?
2016-09-22 19:51:12	Siegfried	I am going through free project gutenberg books and trying to compare usage of oxford comma vs non-usage but not sure how to do this
2016-09-22 19:54:41	+Me-me	There's one question to ask: How do you define an oxford comma, in terms of what characters are surrounding it?
2016-09-22 19:54:41		[19:54]
2016-09-22 19:54:53	+Me-me	or, I suppose, what characters it's made out of
2016-09-22 19:55:02	+Me-me	as far as I know there's only one comma character
2016-09-22 19:57:02	Siegfried	hmm
2016-09-22 19:57:12	Siegfried	Well oxford comma is supposed to be usage of: a, b, and c
2016-09-22 19:57:16	Siegfried	as opposed to: a, b and c

2016-09-22 19:57:52	+Me-me	so, then, an oxford comma would be any comma that is followed by a space, then an a, then an n, then a d. Am I right?
2016-09-22 19:58:41	Siegfried	Me-me I'm trying to figure that out
2016-09-22 19:58:51	Siegfried	Me-me Not sure if there are legitimate uses of a comma before an and that are not oxford comma

I do need to match those arrays but only in lines where echo appears. I tried to figure out something for past few hours but I'm probably too dumb for that.

2016-09-23 00:24:19	+lyxia	what about triple double quotes
2016-09-23 00:24:33	settermjd	yeah. I forgot that. Another requirement is to remove double quotes, but that’s easy enough afterwards
2016-09-23 00:24:39	settermjd	no. no triple quotes.
2016-09-23 00:25:00	+lyxia	so I can assume the last one has single quotes?

2016-09-23 01:18:57	keiserr	problem is if someone modifies their browser string to have HTTP/ in it, it doesn't stop at the first match
2016-09-23 01:20:33	digitok	ok
2016-09-23 01:20:54	keiserr	how can i make it stop at the first match of the end of string, e.g if instead it is GET some string HTTP/1.1 other stuffs HTTP/1.1, it goes to till the final HTTP/1.1
2016-09-23 01:21:01	digitok	it makes sense to use negated character classes like [^(] only if you're actually trying to match "all text up until the next ("
2016-09-23 01:21:42	digitok	do you need to capture all these parts or only the browser string
2016-09-23 01:22:37	keiserr	ahaa fixed witha \b
2016-09-23 01:22:57	digitok	you should answer my questions rather than applying fixes you don't understand ;)
2016-09-23 01:23:00	keiserr	needed only the url part
2016-09-23 01:23:07	keiserr	digitok, :p sorry 
2016-09-23 01:23:13	digitok	can the paths contain spaces at all?
2016-09-23 01:23:19	digitok	or are those encoded with %20 before this
2016-09-23 01:23:21	digitok	i forget

2016-09-23 01:23:53	keiserr	ohh let me check
2016-09-23 01:23:59	digitok	yeh the /data part
2016-09-23 01:24:10	digitok	just wondering if it can have spaces

2016-09-23 07:13:06	+lopid	example, on regex101?
2016-09-23 07:13:14	shonuffdig	I've used regex101 and it looks good..however, my array (I'm using string.match )

2016-09-23 07:24:58	shonuffdig	Sorry, didn't explain it very well.  It shows fine on there.  However, in my javascript function http://pastebin.com/ghN1qap5 my array is populating with the brackets in it.  I'm assuming it's something to do with my regex and not my javascript :)
2016-09-23 07:25:53	+lopid	i don't know js too well, but it looks like you're assigning the whole match instead of the group
2016-09-23 07:25:53		[07:25]
2016-09-23 07:26:29	shonuffdig	so the \> and \< are included in the match eh?
2016-09-23 07:26:45	+lopid	yes, because they matching, being part of the regex

2016-09-23 12:21:11	+lopid	[20:50:01] look into the x modifier [20:50:01]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	+Ouims	[20:50:24] /x modifier is not going to change anything [20:50:24]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	+Ouims	[20:50:33] and would require him to escape space [20:50:33]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	+lopid	[20:50:38] it will change the readability of that regex [20:50:38]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	+Ouims	[20:51:33] what is this supposed to match regex101-7368 [20:51:33]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	+Ouims	[20:51:37] can you anchor with ^$ [20:51:37]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	regex101-7368	[20:52:13] that's the thing, I can't use anchors [20:52:13]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	+Ouims	[20:52:20] why [20:52:20]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	regex101-7368	[20:52:50] because matches can have suffixes [20:52:50]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	regex101-7368	[20:52:57] so I can only use ^ [20:52:57]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	+Ouims	[20:53:08] you could include the suffixes in the regex [20:53:08]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	regex101-7368	[20:54:24] there's no pattern for the suffix [20:54:24]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	regex101-7368	[20:54:43] i'm matching english text [20:54:43]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	regex101-7368	[20:55:16] only strings with a variable length and a given beginning are accepted [20:55:16]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	+Ouims	[20:56:12] and can't you use the captured group [20:56:12]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	+Ouims	[20:56:24] to know if it's matching [20:56:24]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	regex101-7368	[20:58:10] actually this pattern is used against arbitrary strings to test if the string is eligible for further analysis [20:58:10]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	regex101-7368	[20:58:23] it's sort of a sentinel [20:58:23]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	regex101-7368	[20:58:42] so it just needs to give a yes/no answer [20:58:42]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	regex101-7368	[20:59:07] if the string matches and now, every string matches and the match is an empty string [20:59:07]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	+Ouims	[20:59:46] you can check for captured group [20:59:46]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	+Ouims	[20:59:55] to get a yes/no answer [20:59:55]

2016-09-23 12:57:58	Moretz	valvet I meant somethin like this https://regex101.com/r/qP4dG6/2
2016-09-23 12:58:00	+go|dfish	Moretz: what will you be using to do the filtering
2016-09-23 12:58:27	Moretz	the second line should be filtered out
2016-09-23 12:58:45	Moretz	goldfish, I dont understand the Question
2016-09-23 12:59:29	+go|dfish	tool/language
2016-09-23 12:59:50	+go|dfish	it's usually simpler to not use regex for such a task and just get a count of \ characters

2016-09-23 13:01:53	+JohnDoe2	if that's the case you can convert the non capturing group around it to a named capturing group and then check if $match['named
2016-09-23 13:01:55	+JohnDoe2	exists :D
2016-09-23 13:02:33	valvet	JohnDoe2: Ah. I'm trying to catch "all" types of PHP error messages - if html_errors is enabled, the error messages will have <b></b> around Warning|Notice .. so I need to match both <b>Notice</b> and just Notice :)
2016-09-23 13:02:52	+JohnDoe2	yeah then you've got it
2016-09-23 13:03:08	+JohnDoe2	an alternative would be to make each character optional
2016-09-23 13:03:16	+JohnDoe2	but the non capturing group is more readable
2016-09-23 13:03:24	valvet	Alright sweet. (?:..)? just seemed a bit "long", hence it might be a weird way of doing it

2016-09-23 13:16:57	regex101-1184	hey there. I'm really not good with regex ... could someone tell me how to filter all Strings which look like this "\n" or "\n    " or "\n\n "   ?
2016-09-23 13:17:26	regex101-1184	so the " " shouldn't be respected
2016-09-23 13:17:37	+go|dfish	Moretz: perhaps something like: https://regex101.com/r/qP4dG6/3
2016-09-23 13:18:12	+go|dfish	regex101-1184: what does 'the " " shouldn't be respected' mean
2016-09-23 13:18:37	+go|dfish	\n+ to match "one or more \n"
2016-09-23 13:18:44	regex101-1184	well the whats inside "" is the actually string it should run through
2016-09-23 13:18:55	+go|dfish	oh right
2016-09-23 13:19:27	+go|dfish	well + means "1 or more" - so it looks like you want to match "one or more \n followed by one or more space" ? in which case: /\n+ +/

2016-09-23 13:20:02	regex101-1184	and there could be spaces inbetween or also at the beginning

2016-09-23 13:24:26	valvet	Do you have some example lines? If all you're looking for is \n, that probably won't be that hard.. but if you can have eigher 1, 342, or 3 spaces in front, between, after or somewhere else, it might be a bit more difficult (?). How does one determine the good strings, if the spacing between \n is random
2016-09-23 13:24:43	regex101-1184	\\n+ + maybe this way?
2016-09-23 13:24:52	regex101-1184	because the backslash has to be escaped?
2016-09-23 13:25:24	valvet	Sure, if you just need to find lines with \n anywhere, any number of times.. disregarindg any other characters
2016-09-23 13:26:20	valvet	That won't match lines with spaces in front of \n tho.. \\n+ +
2016-09-23 13:26:39	valvet	\\n+ ?+ might

2016-09-24 00:33:57	+lopid	[09:11:28] you're welcome [09:11:28]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	digitok	[09:11:29] :/ [09:11:29]

2016-09-24 00:33:57	+lopid	[09:12:26] regex101 proves it! [09:12:26]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	regex101-6368	[09:12:50] So if I want to find "of WORD(S) as" would I have to write: \b(O|o)f(/w)?(A|a)s)\b ? [09:12:50]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	+Me-me	[09:12:54] "...find a certain word pattern?" [09:12:54]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	+lopid	[09:13:31] /of WORD\(S\) as/ [09:13:31]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	regex101-6368	[09:13:59] Yes, a pattern of words that follow one another, i.e. "of" followed by "as", as in... "They think OF him an her AS friends" [09:13:59]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	+lopid	[09:14:05] ah [09:14:05]

2016-09-24 00:33:57	+Me-me	[09:15:16] 6368: What engine are you using? [09:15:16]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	+lopid	[09:15:41] can you put marked positive and negative test strings into regex101.com? [09:15:41]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	regex101-6368	[09:15:49] I don't know about the engine... I need it to find the pattern in a LibreOffice Calc-Document [09:15:49]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	+Me-me	[09:16:01] I think that uses PCRE... /[Oo]f(?:\W++\w++)*?\W++as/ [09:16:01]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	+Me-me	[09:16:24] that will match "Of" or "of" and then go word by word until it finds as. If it can't, the match fails. If it can, the whole text is the match. [09:16:24]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	regex101-6368	[09:16:28] That was quick! I can only thank you so much... I shall give your versions a try. [09:16:28]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	digitok	[09:16:53] yeh, it lacks support for case-insensitivity, but it supports possessive quantifiers [09:16:53]

2016-09-24 07:26:35	Lindrian	lopid can't be arsed with that channel, someone is going to go like "why do you have a bad db" "why do you want to do this" "why do you suck" bla bla
2016-09-24 07:26:45	Lindrian	i can't bother explaining everything, people in here typically know whats going on

2016-09-24 07:27:01	Lindrian	every channel on freenode is the same
2016-09-24 07:27:16	+lopid	if both db's are on the same server, maybe insert-select will help
2016-09-24 07:28:33	Lindrian	Problem is the new structure uses foreign keys bound on the ids of the inserted rows
2016-09-24 07:28:57	Lindrian	So I literally need to insert each row at a time, and handle that explicitly. And for a million+ rows it takes time

2016-09-24 07:32:30	Lindrian	and I need to select each row individually, i first tried grabbing it all
2016-09-24 07:32:36	Lindrian	but clearly ran out of memory...
2016-09-24 07:32:50	+OnlineCop	Hey Lindrian. Was out of town this last week.
2016-09-24 07:32:54	+lopid	yeah don't do that
2016-09-24 07:33:13	Lindrian	I tried to be lazy and gave it my entire system memory - 24gb
2016-09-24 07:33:15	Lindrian	it almost worked.
2016-09-24 07:33:16	Lindrian	almost.
2016-09-24 07:33:22	+lopid	!
2016-09-24 07:33:32	+OnlineCop	Saw you mentioning some SQL stuff (I'm not very SQL savvy... :-( but I'm good at scripts) for importing stuff across.
2016-09-24 07:33:40	+lopid	i take it programming isn't your day job
2016-09-24 07:33:41	Lindrian	I guess I can do SELECT ... LIMIT 1, offset
2016-09-24 07:33:50	Lindrian	lopid me?
2016-09-24 07:33:53	+lopid	yes
2016-09-24 07:33:57	Lindrian	is that an insult
2016-09-24 07:34:01	+lopid	no…
2016-09-24 07:34:01		[07:34]
2016-09-24 07:34:41	Lindrian	Do you know who I am?
2016-09-24 07:34:48	+lopid	selecting things from a db is usually done with an iterator, not all at once
2016-09-24 07:35:05	+OnlineCop	lopid: You're speaking to Mr. Regex101 Owner himself. :D
2016-09-24 07:35:57	Lindrian	lopid I don't know which language you select your db result with, but I don't use iterators. SQL handles that for me, why write an iterator when you can just write a query to do it for you?
2016-09-24 07:35:58	+lopid	i knew that. i meant interfacing with a database, which is what (most?) programmers do regularly
2016-09-24 07:36:11	OCPoser	Lindrian: If you want, I can go into #mysql and ask them and get all the dumb questions out of the way for you. :D
2016-09-24 07:36:22	Lindrian	Nah I think I know what I need to do
2016-09-24 07:36:44	Lindrian	I'll just select each row at a time
2016-09-24 07:37:06	+lopid	you wouldn't write the iterator, it'd be handled by whatever library your language uses to talk to databases, usually some form of orm. but we digress
2016-09-24 07:38:18	Lindrian	Library to talk to the db?
2016-09-24 07:38:35	+lopid	maybe built in *shrug*
2016-09-24 07:38:36	Lindrian	There is none of the language I use that provides anything like that. I assume you mean something lazy
2016-09-24 07:38:51	+lopid	ok
2016-09-24 07:39:27	Lindrian	I mean something still has to buffer the data
2016-09-24 07:39:33	Lindrian	I don't understand how that would help

2016-09-24 07:41:25	Lindrian	lopid care to educate me?
2016-09-24 07:42:55	+lopid	it's magic servery stuff. you entering "select * from table" at the command line and getting gobs of data from the server straight away isn't the same as when a language iterface does it with an iterator. it waits until you iterate over each row before it starts pulling data
2016-09-24 07:43:20	-->	Na3iL (~Na3iL@ubuntu/member/na3il) has joined #regex
2016-09-24 07:43:31	Lindrian	right, so the only diff is your language does not allocate memory for all the data immediately
2016-09-24 07:43:36	Lindrian	the sql db still has to grab all the data
2016-09-24 07:44:03	+lopid	it will prepare to grab the data but won't do it all at once (i think)
2016-09-24 07:44:39	Lindrian	Yeah, I have no such ability to stream data from the db
2016-09-24 07:44:49	 *	lopid nods
2016-09-24 07:46:09	Lindrian	Regardless, it would not help with anything here really
2016-09-24 07:46:27	Lindrian	The problem is I need to insert the data, commit it, get the ID it returned, and use that for the next inserts, etc.
2016-09-24 07:46:28	+lopid	you can (or used to) actually abuse it pretty easily (especially in mysql) by causing the table to lock in some conditions until you're done
2016-09-24 07:47:02	Lindrian	Perhaps I can keep a local counter available, since all ids will start from 1 anyway
2016-09-24 07:47:10	+lopid	you can get that with mysql_insertid, or whatever it's called in your language 
2016-09-24 07:47:18	Lindrian	Yes,
2016-09-24 07:47:23	Lindrian	but that requires you insert one row at a time
2016-09-24 07:47:27	Lindrian	and commit each insert
2016-09-24 07:47:34	Lindrian	(= very expensive)
2016-09-24 07:47:54	+OnlineCop	It might be expensive, but is it the "right way" to do it in this case?
2016-09-24 07:47:57	+lopid	hmm, does it? what if you lock the table first?
2016-09-24 07:48:00	+OnlineCop	I would hope not, but if it IS...
2016-09-24 07:48:19	Lindrian	lopid you need the db to write to get the id
2016-09-24 07:48:38	+OnlineCop	Could you simply hard-code the ID along with the insert?
2016-09-24 07:48:40	+lopid	i would say not necessarily, but i'm no mysql expert
2016-09-24 07:48:56	+OnlineCop	Then alter the table after the import to auto-increment as normal?
2016-09-24 07:50:43	Lindrian	lopid how do I get each insert id in a multi-insert?
2016-09-24 07:50:43		[07:50]
2016-09-24 07:50:51	+lopid	if you do everything in one transaction, you won't be using the id until you commit, so you won't need to wait

2016-09-24 07:51:06	Lindrian	"If you insert multiple rows using a single INSERT statement, LAST_INSERT_ID() returns the value generated for the first inserted row only. The reason for this is to make it possible to reproduce easily the same INSERT statement against some other server."
2016-09-24 07:51:21	Lindrian	lopid each insert creates its own transaction fyi
2016-09-24 07:51:30	Lindrian	OnlineCop yes, I'm thinking the same.
2016-09-24 07:51:32	+lopid	ah you have autocommit on
2016-09-24 07:51:38	Lindrian	lopid no
2016-09-24 07:51:48	Lindrian	Each insert, update, etc runs inside its own transaction ALWAYS
2016-09-24 07:51:58	+lopid	wat. where from?
2016-09-24 07:52:12	Lindrian	Implicitly
2016-09-24 07:52:26	+lopid	but that is wrong
2016-09-24 07:52:45	+lopid	how would transactions work otherwise?
2016-09-24 07:53:33	Lindrian	Don't know, this was what I was yelled at from #mysql a while back
2016-09-24 07:53:52	+OnlineCop	Maybe there's a new crowd in there currently, so they may have better feedback. :D
2016-09-24 07:54:07	+OnlineCop	Also, you can simply say that you "inherited" a database that you need to convert.
2016-09-24 07:54:17	+OnlineCop	They'll be more sympathetic.
2016-09-24 07:54:30	Lindrian	Keeping the IDs client side and creating batched inserts is the way to go I reckon
2016-09-24 07:55:39	Lindrian	brb dinner
2016-09-24 07:55:44	+OnlineCop	Okay.

2016-09-24 19:33:26	digitok	TikityTik, it finds !\w+! where the text following is anything other than !, followed by $ end of string
2016-09-24 19:33:31	digitok	the magic is [^!]*
2016-09-24 19:33:36	TikityTik	Why?
2016-09-24 19:33:46	+OnlineCop	[^!]+   will match everything except a '!'  but  .*  CAN match the '!' character.
2016-09-24 19:33:48	digitok	because it ensures there are no more !'s between there and the end of the string
2016-09-24 19:33:59	TikityTik	You're telling it to not find a !, oh.
2016-09-24 19:34:02	+OnlineCop	TikityTik: Try throwing a   .*  at the beginning of your string.

2016-09-24 19:34:24	TikityTik	thank you
2016-09-24 19:34:58	digitok	i'd recommend keeping that anyway
2016-09-24 19:35:04	digitok	more efficient
2016-09-24 19:35:43	digitok	+OnlineCop+-digitok++--+-+-
2016-09-24 19:35:56	+OnlineCop	Uh...
2016-09-24 19:36:00	digitok	does that work?
2016-09-24 19:36:01	digitok	:p
2016-09-24 19:36:02	+OnlineCop	I don't know how that translates into karma
2016-09-24 19:36:19	digitok	neither do i, but hopefully the bot does
2016-09-24 19:36:25	digitok	he's a smart bot
2016-09-24 19:37:25	+OnlineCop	Alternately, another solution would be to just match  !(\w+)!  and take the last returned result.
2016-09-24 19:37:30	+OnlineCop	https://regex101.com/r/qF2cQ7/3
2016-09-24 19:37:32	+OnlineCop	12 steps.
2016-09-24 19:39:31	digitok	however if you add a lot more !words! it becomes much less efficient
2016-09-24 19:39:41	digitok	i'd go with the .*... solution
2016-09-24 19:39:59	+OnlineCop	Possibly. But due to optimizations of finding the  !  character before starting the rest of the search, it may be fine.
2016-09-24 19:40:05	TikityTik	for: !first! askjdhf +asdjklfh+ asdf kjh second qwer. How do I make it so it doesnt' select the ! string ! at all?
2016-09-24 19:40:25	TikityTik	basing off +string+
2016-09-24 19:40:26	+OnlineCop	Which string? The 'first' ?
2016-09-24 19:40:35	TikityTik	yeah, I don't want first to return
2016-09-24 19:40:54	+OnlineCop	So you can find  !first!  as long as it's not followed by +stuff+  ?
2016-09-24 19:40:58	TikityTik	I only want !first! to be after +string+
2016-09-24 19:41:03	TikityTik	yes
2016-09-24 19:41:24	+OnlineCop	A look-ahead might be able to peek forward and check that  +string+  doesn't occur.
2016-09-24 19:41:30	+OnlineCop	But I'd need to see some solid examples.
2016-09-24 19:41:44	digitok	yeh give a few more examples and click 'save' on regex101
2016-09-24 19:41:44	+OnlineCop	Otherwise, there will be too many edge cases to keep re-evaluating the regex for.
2016-09-24 19:41:51	digitok	and OnlineCop will get you sorted (:
2016-09-24 19:41:53	+OnlineCop	https://regex101.com/r/qF2cQ7/4 :D
2016-09-24 19:42:02	TikityTik	these are the examples i have so far
2016-09-24 19:42:26	+OnlineCop	So !first! is okay in the first line because it is not followed by +word+
2016-09-24 19:42:28	TikityTik	basically don't want a math for that 2nd line OnlineCop 
2016-09-24 19:42:35	TikityTik	match*
2016-09-24 19:43:01	+OnlineCop	!second! is also good because it also has no +word+ after it, but you want to keep only the last  !thing!  on the line that has no  +word+ after it?
2016-09-24 19:43:13	TikityTik	yeah
2016-09-24 19:43:42	TikityTik	also I don't need to worry about newlines
2016-09-24 19:43:42		[19:43]
2016-09-24 19:44:31	TikityTik	it should only be single lined
2016-09-24 19:44:33	+OnlineCop	https://regex101.com/r/qF2cQ7/5
2016-09-24 19:44:43	+OnlineCop	Trying to think about all the various cases to handle here.
2016-09-24 19:44:50	+OnlineCop	Which regex engine/language are you using?
2016-09-24 19:44:57	TikityTik	javascript
2016-09-24 19:45:19	TikityTik	I only want it so it's the last !group! and doesn't include the first !group! too.
2016-09-24 19:45:35	TikityTik	and i don't have to worry about multiple lines, it's single lines I'm runnig the regex on.
2016-09-24 19:45:54	+OnlineCop	Right. But in the first line, both of those groups are valid, so then we have to "overwrite" the stuff found before.
2016-09-24 19:46:09	+OnlineCop	In the second line, however, the !second! is invalid.
2016-09-24 19:46:13	+OnlineCop	So we want to keep only the !first!
2016-09-24 19:46:19	+OnlineCop	And in the third line, we want nothing at all.
2016-09-24 19:46:25	+OnlineCop	Just trying to think this through.
2016-09-24 19:46:52	TikityTik	This is unbelievable.

2016-09-24 19:48:14	+OnlineCop	Look-aheads for the win.
2016-09-24 19:48:49	+OnlineCop	Should the 2nd line match, though?
2016-09-24 19:49:02	digitok	it's followed by +stuff+
2016-09-24 19:49:10	+OnlineCop	!second! is. But not !first!
2016-09-24 19:49:21	digitok	he only ever wanted the last !word!
2016-09-24 19:49:26	digitok	right?
2016-09-24 19:49:38	digitok	last !word! unless followed by +word+
2016-09-24 19:49:39	+OnlineCop	The last !word! that is not followed by +word+
2016-09-24 19:49:41	TikityTik	do negative look aheads work in javascript?
2016-09-24 19:49:45	digitok	yes
2016-09-24 19:49:46	+OnlineCop	Yes, they do.
2016-09-24 19:50:02	digitok	right so !first! should never match
2016-09-24 19:50:08	digitok	unless i'm mistaken
2016-09-24 19:50:12	+OnlineCop	Incorrect.
2016-09-24 19:50:20	+OnlineCop	!first! this should match !second! this should +not+ match
2016-09-24 19:50:39	+OnlineCop	!first! this should NOT match although it is valid !second! this should +not+ match !third! this should match
2016-09-24 19:50:51	digitok	i don't think that's right lol
2016-09-24 19:51:00	digitok	maybe i misunderstood him :p
2016-09-24 19:51:45	TikityTik	Why the new line thing?

2016-09-24 19:51:55	TikityTik	looks right, going to test it in a sec
2016-09-24 19:52:04	+OnlineCop	The regex101 site doesn't let us do things as single-line inputs.
2016-09-24 19:52:34	+OnlineCop	I guess you could use the 'unit tests' feature on the left to get them all single lines, and also be able to state "this should match" and "this should not match"
2016-09-24 19:52:46	digitok	i thought he never ever wanted !first! (unless there were no more !words!)
2016-09-24 19:52:58	digitok	eg line 1 is ok to match !first!
2016-09-24 19:53:02	digitok	but no other line
2016-09-24 19:53:12	+OnlineCop	He wanted the last valid  !word!  on the line
2016-09-24 19:53:17	digitok	i think he only wants 1 match per line
2016-09-24 19:53:19	digitok	basically
2016-09-24 19:53:23	+OnlineCop	A  !word! is invalid if it is +followed+ by +this+
2016-09-24 19:53:39	digitok	ok
2016-09-24 19:53:47	digitok	then he needs yours :)
2016-09-24 19:54:17	digitok	although line 4 looks like it isn't doing what you described
2016-09-24 19:54:46	digitok	nor line 5
2016-09-24 19:54:58	+OnlineCop	Line 4 as in   !first! should +not+ match !second! should match   ?
2016-09-24 19:55:05	digitok	sorry
2016-09-24 19:55:06	digitok	5 and 6
2016-09-24 19:55:07	digitok	:)
2016-09-24 19:55:37	+OnlineCop	  !first! should +not+ match !second! should not match !third! should match    !second! is valid and WOULD match, but !third! comes after it and is valid, so only !third! should be captured.
2016-09-24 19:55:58	+OnlineCop	My thought it basically, use a single capture group and let it keep getting overwritten until you hit the end of the line.
2016-09-24 19:56:08	+OnlineCop	Whichever one was captured last will be the one you want to extract.

2016-09-24 20:00:10	digitok	TikityTik: regarding the \n, if you're parsing line-by-line, you can remove all of the \n's from whatever regex you end up using
2016-09-24 20:00:28	+OnlineCop	I actually wouldn't, to be honest.
2016-09-24 20:00:40	+OnlineCop	You want to say "match anything until the end of the line OR '!' is found"
2016-09-24 20:00:57	digitok	right but if his input can't contain newlines
2016-09-24 20:01:12	+OnlineCop	True. I guess that's when Unit Tests would really show if it's working.

2016-09-24 23:16:53	+Zarthus	the left-arrow tends to mean "back", in this case, you're just collapsing it.

2016-09-24 23:21:29	re101-wasp-559	I'm able to move vertical separator between the 2nd and 3rd third on the live site
2016-09-24 23:21:43	+Zarthus	ah
2016-09-24 23:21:45	+Zarthus	i see
2016-09-24 23:23:06	valvet	Hi guys. Can someone take a look at this please: https://regex101.com/r/wQ2lI8/1 - I'm trying to match everything in the example, that does not contain \.phtml between template="<here>"
2016-09-24 23:23:15	+Zarthus	anyways, i added a comment on github that was not echod here: If you look at the substitution window suddenly the arrow up makes a lot more sense, re101-wasp-559
2016-09-24 23:23:20	re101-wasp-559	and I would expect to be able to resize the subpanes on the right side too, for example: I already have a regex and looking at why it doesn't match. in that case I would look at match information and explanation
2016-09-24 23:23:46	+Zarthus	re101-wasp-559: by collapsing other times they do resize a bit
2016-09-24 23:24:06	+Zarthus	it's definitely more of a quality of life change there, but a good suggestion nevertheless
2016-09-24 23:24:19	+Zarthus	I think http://i.imgur.com/FJEZN5u.png is plenty of room in general
2016-09-24 23:24:25	re101-wasp-559	yes, but I get 50-50, which is not what's needed: match information is more important than explanation (for me), but I can't tell this to the app right now
2016-09-24 23:25:22	+Zarthus	collapsing both windows gives me plenty of room
2016-09-24 23:25:46	+Zarthus	valvet: Why are you not urlencoding the GET parameters?
2016-09-24 23:26:36	+Zarthus	this sounds like a really insecure way of doing things if you ask me
2016-09-24 23:26:39	valvet	Zarthus: This is for modsecurity, I placed a urldecode :)
2016-09-24 23:26:54	valvet	So working with the result, after it's been urldecoded
2016-09-24 23:27:21	+Zarthus	wouldn't it be easier to run the regex on urldecode($_GET['text']), rather than the full query string?
2016-09-24 23:27:21		[23:27]
2016-09-24 23:27:45	valvet	It would, but seeing as this is Magento, the parameters could change
2016-09-24 23:27:59	valvet	Things could've been overriden, so as to not make it too specific, I just check the entire query
2016-09-24 23:29:06	valvet	Gives a bit of performance hit, but as this is a specific admin URL, and only that one, it should be OK
2016-09-24 23:30:08	valvet	But I understand your concerns and agree - will have to see how it performs
2016-09-24 23:30:24	re101-wasp-559	Zarthus: https://postimg.org/image/9hdgqm5zx/ is an example when matches are more important than explanation. I have to scroll to see all matches, but if I was able to resize it would probably fit.
2016-09-24 23:31:20	+Zarthus	re101-wasp-559: yeah, I agree with that point, it's worth putting that in your issue somewhere / making a new one
2016-09-24 23:31:42	+Zarthus	you can still quickly collapse the top one, but resizing in general is a nice thing to have 
2016-09-24 23:35:03	re101-wasp-559	Zarthus: https://github.com/firasdib/Regex101/issues/639
2016-09-24 23:35:46	+Zarthus	re101-wasp-559; do you mind if i edit that comment  for formatting?
2016-09-24 23:35:58	re101-wasp-559	sure, go ahead
2016-09-24 23:36:04	valvet	I think I figured it out.. leaving for reference: https://regex101.com/r/wQ2lI8/3 - removed type=".." dependency.
2016-09-24 23:36:40	+Zarthus	re101-wasp-559: oh, the bolding is something you did yourself, nevermind :)
2016-09-24 23:37:01	+Zarthus	(sometimes markdown likes to interpret <> as html tags, too)
2016-09-24 23:38:40	re101-wasp-559	yeah, I know, two years daily user of GH issues, a lot of users don't know how to use markdown
2016-09-24 23:38:42	+Zarthus	re101-wasp-559: just as a notice though, the beta is pretty much close to release, so it's likely your feedback (if accepted), will most likely be implemented after release.
2016-09-24 23:39:21	re101-wasp-559	don't mind, I'm used to slow implementation timelines
2016-09-24 23:39:30	+Zarthus	none of them look like critical issues that should hold off release, so they most likely wont.
2016-09-24 23:39:48	+Zarthus	unless it's stupidly easy I just don't foresee them being fixed :)
2016-09-24 23:39:54	+Zarthus	(prior to release)
2016-09-24 23:40:26	re101-wasp-559	what about the horizontal resize? that is available in the live version, and not in beta, so isn't it a regeression?
2016-09-24 23:40:59	+Zarthus	it is, but i'm not sure if many people used it or were even aware of it
2016-09-24 23:41:29	+Zarthus	overall it's not my place to call what will or won't delay release, but officially speaking version 2 was scheduled for release 2 days ago ^^
2016-09-24 23:42:09	valvet	Trying to understand, but is this intentional: https://regex101.com/r/uW3zP8/1 - results are being returned, even tho there is (two actually) non-capture groups
2016-09-24 23:42:35	valvet	Might just be my weird regex
2016-09-24 23:42:35		[23:42]
2016-09-24 23:42:39	+Zarthus	there's also one capturing group
2016-09-24 23:42:47	+Zarthus	https://regex101.com/r/uW3zP8/2
2016-09-24 23:42:48	valvet	Ah after the :
2016-09-24 23:43:00	valvet	Thanks
2016-09-24 23:43:07	+Zarthus	that's redundant, fwiw
2016-09-24 23:43:19	+Zarthus	https://regex101.com/r/uW3zP8/3 works just as well
2016-09-24 23:43:58	valvet	I was trying to figure out why I see entire regex's wrapped in non-capture groups, when there are also non-capture groups inside
2016-09-24 23:44:16	+Zarthus	no reason
2016-09-24 23:44:26	valvet	Thought it might've been performance something sometghing
2016-09-24 23:44:36	+Zarthus	https://regex101.com/r/uW3zP8/5 is totally the same thing
2016-09-24 23:44:47	+Zarthus	generally more steps = worse performance

2016-09-25 07:20:04	+lyxia	develoooooper: When you match a regex, you get a substring, and capture groups (subpatterns in parentheses) are also bound to substrings.
2016-09-25 07:20:11	+lyxia	So here you get a match on 00
2016-09-25 07:20:33	+lyxia	and you iterate on this match and its only capture group, which contains the same substring

2016-09-26 00:26:13	Lindrian	twisterrob The issue with the export match icon is that I want it to be visible regardless of the scroll position of the parent.
2016-09-26 00:26:24	Lindrian	Here's an example you can play with that demonstrates the issue: https://jsfiddle.net/sfth1y6s/
2016-09-26 00:26:51	twisterrob	yep, I gathered you want it always visible from the change of behavior from the live version

2016-09-26 00:27:17	+Zarthus	it looks less broken on ie than on chrome
2016-09-26 00:27:20	Lindrian	ie11 doesn't have object.assign
2016-09-26 00:27:26	Lindrian	I added a polyfill for it

2016-09-26 01:32:48	digitok	so who cares

2016-09-26 01:33:45	digitok	then it'd look funny with the scrollbar

2016-09-26 01:46:38	twisterrob	Lindrian: is that bad UX? I don't know. That way it can be even aligned left above the matches. (e.g. 50% opacity on parent hover and 100% on button hover)

2016-09-26 02:05:34	twisterrob	speaking of collapsing, you should increase the click area for that, currently only text is clickable
2016-09-26 02:06:13	digitok	the whole bar is clickable for me
2016-09-26 02:06:26	@Lindrian	I think he means the height of it

2016-09-26 02:07:27	twisterrob	the red part is clickable, I think the white bits should also be, especially when collapsed
2016-09-26 02:07:30	digitok	you can just increase the size of the anchor and decrease the margin/padding right
2016-09-26 02:07:34	twisterrob	that 10px tall area is hard to hit
2016-09-26 02:08:35	twisterrob	Lindrian: digitok is saying something with putting it in the header, what if it's not aligned to the right, but right after the text?
2016-09-26 02:08:50	digitok	a/clr
2016-09-26 02:08:52	digitok	bah

2016-09-26 02:09:03	twisterrob	"Add resize of panels on top of that and t he same pixels have 3 different things to do" resize panels click area would be between the panels, not in the headers
2016-09-26 02:09:22	+Me-me	Lindrian: I know it's late in development but maybe for 2.0.1 or whatever we could have a feature which let us click and drag to have custom sized match/explanation/quick reference panels? Rather than just even portions of the window size
2016-09-26 02:09:23	@Lindrian	Even so, putting the button in the header is going to be annoying

2016-09-26 02:49:26	TreffnonX	That was my intended goal, yes
2016-09-26 02:49:32	+Zarthus	as far as java goes, i'm pretty sure it supports most of PCRE

2016-09-26 02:49:57	TreffnonX	No, java refuses a lot of stuff that you would expect.

2016-09-26 02:51:29	+Zarthus	yeah, slightly :)
2016-09-26 02:52:07	+Zarthus	you'll be able to utilize PCRE and still set down a java-compatible regex most of the time, but I agree more flavours are better. They're just hard to integrate and everyone wants flavours for their language, it's hard to set priorities.
2016-09-26 02:52:17	TreffnonX	Well, in any case, I can always offer to write up a handler. Whether it will be used is up to the devs.
2016-09-26 02:52:39	+Zarthus	it's hard to say you are willing to do it without knowing what's involved, but yeah - talk to Lindrian ^^

2016-09-26 04:10:44	Doqnach	some things like named groups are a bit different but compatible
2016-09-26 04:14:09	TreffnonX	apparrently you have to write \p{alnum} for [[:alnum:]] e.g.
2016-09-26 04:14:09		[04:14]
2016-09-26 04:14:29	TreffnonX	correction: \p{Alnum}
2016-09-26 04:15:31	+Zarthus	i've always just used [a-zA-Z0-9]
2016-09-26 04:15:59	TreffnonX	hmm... you have more control over the individual characters that way i assume...
2016-09-26 04:16:14	+Zarthus	it's also compatible with every flavour ever.
2016-09-26 04:16:18	TreffnonX	you can do [a-zA-Z0-9_\-]
2016-09-26 04:16:45	TreffnonX	then again you can always do [\p{Alnum}_\-]
2016-09-26 04:16:53	+Zarthus	but yeah, if you're writing regexes of that extent as java programmer you ought to know those differences
2016-09-26 04:18:42	TreffnonX	Funny... In pcre apparrently you can write [[:alnum:]_\-] to reach the same result...
2016-09-26 04:18:53	TreffnonX	Didn't know that...
2016-09-26 04:21:05	TreffnonX	So basically the outer '[' and ']' just represent regular square brackets and the inner ones are just an operator to insert a subgroup.

2016-09-26 05:59:18	DatGuy	This might be a bit confusing but, it's actually a project for Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia.
2016-09-26 06:00:26	DatGuy	What I want is that it goes on talk pages, and looks for WikiProject Belgrade. The WikiProject will usually be like this: WikiProject Belgrade|class=something|importance=something

2016-09-26 06:02:53	DatGuy	If there is |SomethingElse, then it will add it and Text1 after Text2, so it will be Text2|Text1|SomethingElse|And|Other . However, if there isn't |SomethingElse, then it will just add Text1, so it will be Text2|Text1|And|Other
2016-09-26 06:03:10	DatGuy	Would that be possible to do with "if it contains" and "if it does not contain"?

2016-09-26 06:11:20	twisterrob	DatGuy: my version is not fully functional, but you should be able to regroup stuff to get what you want. There's another trick you may also need: if you have (foo)|(bar) that will create two capturing groups, but only one of them will be populated with text so if you say $1$2 in replacement that's kind-of an if-else logic

2016-09-26 08:10:44	+Zarthus	I don't really use the unit testing section
2016-09-26 08:10:59	+OnlineCop	Lindrian: Did you indicate that the bug was fixed?
2016-09-26 08:10:59		[08:10]
2016-09-26 08:11:14	+Zarthus	OnlineCop marked it as a bug, so it probably should be fixed
2016-09-26 08:11:36	+Zarthus	whether it has any merit doesn't matter if it's a bug, it'll just be a very low priority one
2016-09-26 08:12:14	+OnlineCop	Basically, if a user has a capture group that should be empty because some OTHER alternation matched the value instead, there should be a way to test for that in unit tests.
2016-09-26 08:12:26	@Lindrian	Why?
2016-09-26 08:12:45	@Lindrian	You're basically asking for a unit test that ensures a branch did not participate in the match
2016-09-26 08:12:53	@Lindrian	which is the same as asking the other branch if it did participate
2016-09-26 08:13:41	+OnlineCop	There was a user a couple days ago that wanted to match foo but not bar, with this kind of setup.
2016-09-26 08:14:02	+OnlineCop	When I said, "Show me what should and should not match", he reported that one particular regex should not have matched.
2016-09-26 08:14:11	+OnlineCop	So I tried to indicate that in a unit test.

2016-09-26 08:14:35	@Lindrian	Right
2016-09-26 08:14:50	@Lindrian	But in some sense its just the polar opposite of another logical assertion
2016-09-26 08:15:52	+OnlineCop	Possibly. Should the unit test simply be changed to match the invalid alternation, which if it does, we obviously didn't capture anything?

2016-09-26 08:16:17	@Lindrian	Not sure I follow
2016-09-26 08:17:14	+OnlineCop	There are 3 passing unit tests in that example. Notice that two of them "match".
2016-09-26 08:17:45	+OnlineCop	One of them captures (which means that it both matched and captured) and one of them does not capture (which means that the capture group should be NULL)
2016-09-26 08:18:06	+OnlineCop	So is there a way to detect when something matched, but it was NOT captured?
2016-09-26 08:18:48	@Lindrian	Right
2016-09-26 08:19:07	@Lindrian	So, would adding a "did not participate" option suffice?
2016-09-26 08:19:59	+OnlineCop	Actually, I think one of those unit tests is wrong: "Captured item should capture" should be:     given the string `.` assert that `capture group 1` equals `.`
2016-09-26 08:20:04	+OnlineCop	Yes, I think that would be fine.

2016-09-26 08:28:30		[08:28]
2016-09-26 08:29:16	+OnlineCop	If the user leaves a field blank, should we consider an empty string to be different from a `null`? I think that we should.

2016-09-26 08:31:44	+OnlineCop	True. So what's your thought here: will this be something we'll want to implement, or just hope that no one needs this "is null" check?
2016-09-26 08:32:36	@Lindrian	I'll see what I can do to align everything

2016-09-27 06:12:18	destramic	..?
2016-09-27 06:12:18	+OnlineCop	It doesn't handle quoted strings yet.
2016-09-27 06:12:29	+OnlineCop	So if you have  "stuff } like { this"
2016-09-27 06:12:34	+OnlineCop	within literal quotes
2016-09-27 06:12:34		[06:12]
2016-09-27 06:12:47	+OnlineCop	You'll have to say "if I'm in a quote, just ignore everything till I get to the other quote" kind of logic.
2016-09-27 06:13:03	+OnlineCop	I'll leave it up to you to figure it out ;)  Just look at how I had done the    /* ... */  logic.
2016-09-27 06:13:17	+OnlineCop	Lindrian: It won't let me log in via github.
2016-09-27 06:13:23	@Lindrian	OnlineCop hold on

2016-09-27 06:13:47	@Lindrian	I had to leave it last minute because the old site depended on the github login in a different way than the current one
2016-09-27 06:13:48	+OnlineCop	I don't think I logged in any other way before, so I guess I can try Google or Twitter, although it will see me as someone else that way.
2016-09-27 06:13:56	+OnlineCop	Oh, that makes sense.
2016-09-27 06:14:58	destramic	i dont think "stuff } like { this" will be a problem

2016-09-27 06:16:29	+OnlineCop	"[^"]*"  is the naive approach.
2016-09-27 06:16:51	+OnlineCop	"(?>[^"\\]+|\\.)*"  would probably be safer.
2016-09-27 06:17:04	+OnlineCop	That way   "a \"quoted\" string" doesn't break it.

2016-09-27 22:59:36	+Me-me	[07:48:25] why does that exist [07:48:25]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	+Doqnach	[07:48:46] because MS actually does make cross platform software *gasp* [07:48:46]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	SaraDR	[08:10:34] Hi! (PCRE), can I do match on something, I caught earlier in the same pattern? Particularly looking to match html-like tags, <something> ... </something>. [08:10:34]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	+lyxia	[08:12:39] SaraDR: https://regex101.com/r/FkZRr3/1 [08:12:39]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	SaraDR	[08:13:30] lyxia, so \1 is the content of match group 1? [08:13:30]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	+lyxia	[08:13:59] yes [08:13:59]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	SaraDR	[08:14:08] Awesome. Thank you lyxia. [08:14:08]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	+lyxia	[08:14:23] it won't work if you have nested <something> tags [08:14:23]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	+lyxia	[08:14:38] <p><p></p></p> will match <p><p></p> [08:14:38]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	SaraDR	[08:15:05] Right but they can't be nested either way. But worth keeping in mind. [08:15:05]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	+lyxia	[08:15:18] great then [08:15:18]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	digitok	[08:19:10] i don't think spaces before an element name is valid [08:19:10]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	digitok	[08:19:26] nor after i imagine [08:19:26]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	+lyxia	[08:19:31] oh [08:19:31]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	SaraDR	[08:20:03] But it isn't html it needs to match. [08:20:03]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	digitok	[08:20:12] fair enough [08:20:12]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	SaraDR	[08:25:11] But, I think I'll leave the space part out, and leave it strict. Easier to maintain, test and less ambigious I guess digitok. [08:25:11]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	digitok	[08:25:41] :) [08:25:41]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	+Doqnach	[08:35:05] spaces outside of tags are fine [08:35:05]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	+Doqnach	[08:35:20] inside tags it's fine before the >, just not right after the < [08:35:20]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	digitok	[08:35:40] even in closing tags? [08:35:40]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	digitok	[08:35:42] </foo > [08:35:42]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	digitok	[08:35:51] or </ foo> [08:35:51]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	+Doqnach	[08:36:11] not right after < or </ * :-P [08:36:11]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	+Doqnach	[08:36:19] no idea about the > in an end tag actually [08:36:19]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	digitok	[08:36:20] but </foo > is ok? [08:36:20]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	digitok	[08:36:24] hmm [08:36:24]
2016-09-27 22:59:36	+Doqnach	[08:36:32] never tried [08:36:32]

2016-09-27 23:22:51	digitok	Lindrian, when you insert some tabs and then hit enter and it automatically indents the subsequent lines, is there a reason it uses spaces instead of tabs?
2016-09-27 23:22:53	+Doqnach	like the shortcut keystrokes for save etc
2016-09-27 23:23:17	+Doqnach	tabs are horrible in browsers due to browser behaviour
2016-09-27 23:23:24	Lindrian	Doqnach dont see anything obvious

2016-09-27 23:23:51	digitok	if you're gonna auto indent i want tabs not spaces
2016-09-27 23:23:52	digitok	:>
2016-09-27 23:24:15	digitok	don't be spacist
2016-09-27 23:24:18	+Doqnach	I used to be pro tabs, and kind of still am, but switching to spaces gradually due to it being more popular
2016-09-27 23:24:47	digitok	right, i just think that if you indent something with 3 tabs you don't want the next line to have 12 spaces
2016-09-27 23:25:09	digitok	it seems less helpful to automatically prepend the lines with spaces
2016-09-27 23:25:15	digitok	better to do nothing

2016-09-28 09:19:55	+OnlineCop	Switching to the dark theme, it doesn't appear to change, and the darker colors match the theme better. Switching back to the light theme, I'd probably do close to what it's doing: make the background a lighter shade of gray, and then invert the colors to be black-on-light-gray.

2016-09-28 09:43:20	re101-indri-208	what is the use of \number in python regex
2016-09-28 09:43:21	re101-indri-208	??
2016-09-28 09:43:22	+pork_	? is not defined
2016-09-28 09:43:35	+OnlineCop	https://regex101.com/r/AiFXDB/9 would be a bit faster, re101-falcon-382 
2016-09-28 09:43:45	+OnlineCop	You mean  \1  and  \4
2016-09-28 09:44:05	re101-indri-208	yes exactly
2016-09-28 09:44:18	+OnlineCop	You can match text and then extract/capture just the portions that you want. Those are stored in an array, starting at [1] and going to however many capture groups you've defined.
2016-09-28 09:44:36	+OnlineCop	So  \1  will refer to the first captured item in the array,  \4  refers to the  MyCaptures[4]  and so forth.
2016-09-28 09:45:02	re101-indri-208	i have a regular expression r'(.+) \0' that matches 'the the'
2016-09-28 09:45:24	+OnlineCop	Yes,  \0  is the "everything that matched, including all the captures" group.
2016-09-28 09:45:38	+OnlineCop	r'(.+) \1'  would be the same in this context.
2016-09-28 09:46:10	re101-indri-208	sorry it is \1
2016-09-28 09:46:14	re101-indri-208	not \0
2016-09-28 09:47:00	+OnlineCop	Right. You captured some stuff in the first (.+) capture group.
2016-09-28 09:47:01	re101-indri-208	so ill tell u again ..... i have a regular expression r'(.+) \1' that matches 'the the', but same doesn't work if ill change \1 to \0
2016-09-28 09:47:20	+OnlineCop	You referred back to 'the same value' so it checks that one word is followed by another of that same word.
2016-09-28 09:47:28	re101-indri-208	so my doubt is that what is the use of \anyNumber
2016-09-28 09:47:30	re101-indri-208	?
2016-09-28 09:47:43	+OnlineCop	(.)(.)(.)\3\2\1
2016-09-28 09:47:49	+OnlineCop	That will match     abccba
2016-09-28 09:48:08	+OnlineCop	(.)(.)(.)\3\1\2   would match   6a996a
2016-09-28 09:48:22	+OnlineCop	So you can mix-and-match the  \number  in any order that you need at the moment.

2016-09-29 03:20:53	re101-coati-871	Hi everyone 
2016-09-29 03:20:54	+lyxia	I'll be sure to remember it if we ever meet, re101-barb-640 
2016-09-29 03:21:00	re101-coati-871	What is the best regex pattern for email ? 
2016-09-29 03:21:46	re101-barb-640	lyxia I am from Slovakia :)
2016-09-29 03:21:54	+lyxia	re101-coati-871: the best one is the one that sends an email and listens for a response
2016-09-29 03:22:10	+lyxia	re101-barb-640: I've always dreamed of visiting Slovakia.
2016-09-29 03:22:37	+lyxia	Especially if there's free beer waiting for me.
2016-09-29 03:24:09	+abernix	!email
2016-09-29 03:24:09	+perlbot	Like HTML, email is deceptively complex. Whenever possible, avoid rolling your own solution and trust the ones put forth by those who work with it all day, every day. Ask me about sending email or see Task::Email::PEP::All.
2016-09-29 03:24:16	+abernix	I don't feel like we use that often enough. :)
2016-09-29 03:24:49	+abernix	Also, now I want to go to Slovak Pub in Bratislava, thanks.
2016-09-29 03:25:11	+lyxia	how do you ask it about sending email
2016-09-29 03:25:16	+abernix	JUST ASK IT.
2016-09-29 03:25:16	+lyxia	perlbot: about sending email
2016-09-29 03:25:24	+lyxia	perlbot: How do you send email?
2016-09-29 03:25:24	+perlbot	lyxia: No factoid found. Did you mean one of these: [had something about problems in switch but i don't remember what it] [how do we know that money isnt] [how to ask smart questions] [how to seem smart]
2016-09-29 03:25:47	+lyxia	perlbot: email?

2016-09-29 05:16:34	twisterrob	Lindrian: beta deployed?
2016-09-29 05:16:51	Lindrian	twisterrob Whats happening is that webkit/blink is creating a graphical image of the element instead of using vectors to enable hardware acceleration (since I animate the menu). This makes it blurry when you zoom in.
2016-09-29 05:16:53	Lindrian	twisterrob yes....
2016-09-29 05:17:25	Lindrian	Zarthus I intentionally left the menu "dark" in the light theme because I thought it looked better, but a few people seem to dislike it. The menus shown as counter-examples look worse to me, but if the majority agrees I'll change.
2016-09-29 05:17:28	JohnDoe2_	I like twisterrob's color scheme, but I personally do not find it hard to read the way it is right now. An easy way to keep the style you like is to increase contrast for the text.

2016-09-29 05:19:44	Lindrian	Doqnach yes, and a white menu on white bg has little contrast
2016-09-29 05:19:56	+Doqnach	indeed

2016-09-29 05:24:33	+Doqnach	ahuh
2016-09-29 05:25:18	twisterrob	I'm not color blind, I have some very weak glasses. With the light theme I don't need to bend forward to read text. but with the dark one I have to.
2016-09-29 05:25:21	+Doqnach	using the header-blue (#457abb) for the background and changing the color of the text to white-ish seems fine to me
2016-09-29 05:25:50	twisterrob	in comparison this is how I code: http://i.imgur.com/wnOD4In.png
2016-09-29 05:25:58	+Doqnach	I have very strong glasses (minus), light colourblindness (mostly pastells and colours that are very close in spectrum)
2016-09-29 05:26:10	+Zarthus	twisterrob: Sounds to me like you need to get better glasses?
2016-09-29 05:26:17	+Zarthus	or up the font
2016-09-29 05:26:48	+Zarthus	I just have very strong glasses (minus as well), and I can see as well as someone without glasses.
2016-09-29 05:26:54	twisterrob	Zarthus: but if I can read the light site, but not the dark one given nothing else change, don't you think there's something wrong with the dark?
2016-09-29 05:27:04	+Zarthus	no
2016-09-29 05:27:11	+Zarthus	because I can't stand the light theme and I can stand the dark theme
2016-09-29 05:27:51	+Doqnach	I prefer the dark theme since it's softer to read (aka: less bright light in my eyes which is more comfy)
2016-09-29 05:27:57	Lindrian	Doqnach can you show me?

2016-09-29 05:32:53	+Zarthus	it looks okay to me
2016-09-29 05:33:09	Lindrian	But I don't see the issue with it being dark grey
2016-09-29 05:33:12	Lindrian	the tooltips are black
2016-09-29 05:33:40	+Doqnach	I don't have an issue with it either, but then again I don't use the light theme
2016-09-29 05:33:47	+Zarthus	strictly speaking with a white theme I'd just "not expect" a black box.
2016-09-29 05:34:18	+Zarthus	it doesn't bother me, but if it did I'd have made a stylish style for it
2016-09-29 05:34:27	Lindrian	stylish style?
2016-09-29 05:34:29	+Doqnach	Lindrian: needs more contrast to me for sure
2016-09-29 05:34:35	Lindrian	Doqnach I agree.
2016-09-29 05:34:37	+Zarthus	Stylish, the addon that fixes bad websites.
2016-09-29 05:34:51	Lindrian	ok
2016-09-29 05:34:58	+Doqnach	with teh dark theme you play with the different shades of gray which automatically gives you contrast
2016-09-29 05:35:22	+Doqnach	you don't have that as much in the light theme, unless you change the bgcolor to a light gray e.g. #dfdfdf
2016-09-29 05:35:51	Lindrian	yep
2016-09-29 05:35:55	Lindrian	light is way harder

2016-09-29 05:36:56	+Doqnach	no idea how someone with bad contrast on their monitor sees it

2016-09-29 05:58:50	JohnDoe2_	because jay's initial statement was "I use the light theme but the modifiers and delimiters menu show in the dark theme."
2016-09-29 05:59:02	JohnDoe2_	his expectation was to find a light menu with dark text like the rest of the theme
2016-09-29 05:59:26	JohnDoe2_	but yeah that's a valid solution in my opinion, just make the text inside the menu lighter.

2016-09-30 03:03:07	re101-quoll-738	I have the following regex: (?:<@(.+)>|(me))(.+)
2016-09-30 03:03:21	re101-quoll-738	would be it possible to get the first two capture groups as one
2016-09-30 03:03:27	re101-quoll-738	so on the same groupIndex
2016-09-30 03:03:34	re101-quoll-738	since its one or the other
2016-09-30 03:04:06	+Andrio	I'm pretty sure it isn't.
2016-09-30 03:04:45	re101-quoll-738	Currently, if it matches the first part so "<@hello>" it will give "hello" in group 1
2016-09-30 03:04:54	re101-quoll-738	and if it matches "me" it will be in group 2

2016-09-30 03:06:32	+Andrio	Hm... what are you using that for?
2016-09-30 03:07:13	re101-quoll-738	Getting multiple variables from user input.
2016-09-30 03:07:46	re101-quoll-738	A user could say: remind <@someuser> in 5 hours My message

2016-09-30 03:08:07	re101-quoll-738	but <@someuser> can also be "me"

2016-09-30 03:08:59	re101-quoll-738	I can easily just remove the <@ and > from the first group if I put it in one, but I wanted to know if it would be possible iwthout

2016-09-30 07:27:16	re101-gopher-202	i have a query . will you please convert this regex \\x7b[0-9][0-9]*,[0-9][0-9]*\\x7d\\p{Print}\\p{Print}* to oracle regexp
2016-09-30 07:27:42	+OnlineCop	Does Oracle understand the  \p{...} construct?
2016-09-30 07:27:54	re101-gopher-202	yes i does
2016-09-30 07:27:56	re101-gopher-202	*it
2016-09-30 07:28:34	+OnlineCop	I don't see \p on https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B12037_01/appdev.101/b10795/adfns_re.htm
2016-09-30 07:30:21	re101-gopher-202	Thanks. but i tried doing some homework , found somewhere that \p{print} = [:print:] in oracle regex
2016-09-30 07:30:43	+OnlineCop	So you'd use  [[:print:]]  in that case, I'd assume.
2016-09-30 07:30:52	+OnlineCop	As for the other portion,   \\x  would just become  \x
2016-09-30 07:30:58	+OnlineCop	Everything else looks straight-forward.
2016-09-30 07:31:05	re101-gopher-202	[:xdigit:][0-9][0-9]*,[0-9][0-9]*[:xdigit:][:print:][:print:]
2016-09-30 07:31:23	re101-gopher-202	is that fine ?
2016-09-30 07:31:23	+OnlineCop	\x7b  is just the   {   character
2016-09-30 07:32:16	re101-gopher-202	oh  is not hexadecimal ??
2016-09-30 07:32:24	re101-gopher-202	*it
2016-09-30 07:32:31	+OnlineCop	Looks like it's trying to match    {0,0}  followed by   [\x20-\x7E]
2016-09-30 07:32:41	+OnlineCop	Yes, it is hex.  \x##  is the format.
2016-09-30 07:32:56	+OnlineCop	So there,   \\x7b  would just be   \x7b  which is hex for the  '{'  character.
2016-09-30 07:33:03	+OnlineCop	And  \x7d  is just the   '}'  one
2016-09-30 07:33:14	+OnlineCop	Then  \p{Print}   is any value in the range  [\x20-\x7E]
2016-09-30 07:33:29	+OnlineCop	So any visible character (a space, a letter, a ^%&*()  symbol, etc.)

2016-09-30 07:45:34	+OnlineCop	RodrigoBR: (.*)\r?\n(.*)    \1\2
2016-09-30 07:45:55	+OnlineCop	That will get rid of the newline if you simply capture the stuff between the lines and don't replace the newline (just replace the stuff).
2016-09-30 07:46:23	+OnlineCop	re101-gopher-202: The   \{   may not be recognized, which is why the user probably used the hex value in the first place.
2016-09-30 07:46:30	+OnlineCop	But be sure to escape each   \   character.
2016-09-30 07:46:59	+OnlineCop	Otherwise,   "stuff \x20 stuff"  will have the  \x20  translated into a space and THEN the regex will see  "stuff   stuff"
2016-09-30 07:47:43	+OnlineCop	So  \\x20  will translate \\ into a single \  and then keep the   x20   after that. The regex will be able to see that single   \x20  like it's intended and match that hex value.

2016-09-30 08:11:03	+OnlineCop	Not if you want to capture each of the letters separately.
2016-09-30 08:11:17	+OnlineCop	Now, if you have  a.b.c.d.e.f   and want to capture all of them together as one big capture, then yes.
2016-09-30 08:11:43	+OnlineCop	You would have to use a second regex to split those apart, but that would be possible.
2016-09-30 08:12:18	+OnlineCop	(?:...)*    will make that non-capture group repeat, right?  So you would match the first letter followed by repeating    \.[a-z]+   as many times as they occur.
2016-09-30 08:12:28	+OnlineCop	Well,   [a-zA-Z0-9]   to be more specific.
2016-09-30 08:12:53	+OnlineCop	Then just wrap all of those (the repeating group and everything) into one capture group.

2016-09-30 13:51:07	Lindrian	I'm trying to add a max length to the regex field since a lot of users seem to be triggering errors that way
2016-09-30 13:51:18	Lindrian	Problem is, I don't understand how PCRE is handling the max length.
2016-09-30 13:51:43	Lindrian	I can insert 30k chars without any errors, but with different chars it errors at 10k. And no, these are no unicode chars, all ascii.
2016-09-30 13:52:14	Lindrian	This is what the docs say: The maximum length of a compiled  pattern  is  approximately  64K  data units  (bytes  for  the  8-bit  library,  16-bit  units  for the 16-bit library, and 32-bit units for the 32-bit library) if PCRE  is  compiled with  the default internal linkage size, which is 2 bytes for the 8-bit and 16-bit libraries, and 4 bytes for the 32-bit library.
2016-09-30 13:52:45	Lindrian	So my understanding from that is that the max length is 64k BYTES. Is that correct?
2016-09-30 13:54:21	+OnlineCop	64k 32-bit units?
2016-09-30 13:54:42	Lindrian	I use 16 bit library, so I understood it as 64k 16bit units

2016-09-30 20:48:16	Talon_	is there a way to specify not start or not end? I'm doing a replacement using //g to match the space between characters to get it into a seperated list, say "abc" but using //g, returns ",a,b,c,"
2016-09-30 20:49:13	digitok	talon?
2016-09-30 20:49:18	Talon_	sup digitok :)
2016-09-30 20:49:26	digitok	hi:)
2016-09-30 20:49:31	digitok	is this in mirc?
2016-09-30 20:49:56	Talon_	any really, testing the theory with $regsubex() at the moment but should apply to perl/js/whatever
2016-09-30 20:50:11	digitok	!regex abc /(?<!^)(?!$)/,/g
2016-09-30 20:50:11	+pork_	Syntax is: !regex <text> /regex/, !regex <text> s/regex/replacement/
2016-09-30 20:50:15	digitok	!regex abc s/(?<!^)(?!$)/,/g
2016-09-30 20:50:15	+pork_	[Result: 3] a,,b,c
2016-09-30 20:50:44	Talon_	oh right, lookbehind or lookahead, didn't think about that... but that wouldn't work in JS.
2016-09-30 20:50:44	digitok	that's weird
2016-09-30 20:50:46	digitok	it works tho
2016-09-30 20:50:50	digitok	nah
2016-09-30 20:51:22	digitok	how about
2016-09-30 20:51:32	digitok	!regex abc s/(.)(?!$)/\1/g
2016-09-30 20:51:32	+pork_	[Result: 2] abc

2016-09-30 20:52:32	digitok	yeh no lookbehinds in JS  is a real pain
2016-09-30 20:53:15	digitok	ok sec
2016-09-30 20:53:20	digitok	!regex abc s/(?!^)(?=.)/,/g
2016-09-30 20:53:20	+pork_	[Result: 3] a,,b,c
2016-09-30 20:53:33	digitok	i dunno why it's doing that but it works on the site
2016-09-30 20:54:08	digitok	"abc".replace(/(?!^)(?=.)/g,",")
2016-09-30 20:54:08	digitok	"a,b,c"
2016-09-30 20:54:16	Talon_	//say $regsubex(abc,/(?!^)(?=.)/g,$chr(44))
2016-09-30 20:54:17	Talon_	a,b,c
2016-09-30 20:54:20	Talon_	works in msl too
2016-09-30 20:54:23	digitok	yeh i think the bot's bugged
2016-09-30 20:55:30	digitok	(?!^)(?!$) is nicer
2016-09-30 20:55:32	digitok	use that
2016-09-30 20:55:37	digitok	or
2016-09-30 20:55:41	digitok	(?!^|$)
2016-09-30 20:55:43	digitok	even better

2016-09-30 21:07:34	digitok	yea
2016-09-30 21:07:47	Talon_	no, not really.. but $sin(.) should work

2016-09-30 21:08:34	digitok	alias numbers return $sin(.) $+ $regsubex(.........,/./g,\n)
2016-09-30 21:09:29	Talon_	nice
2016-09-30 21:09:54	Talon_	I toyed with it. I came up with the thought that it'll be run in a blank mIRC, so the 1st status windows cid is always 1
2016-09-30 21:10:02	Talon_	numbers return $regsubex($ctime,/./g,$calc(\n -$cid))
2016-09-30 21:10:18	digitok	nice
2016-09-30 21:10:50	Talon_	he didn't specify where it would be loaded, remotes or aliases, so I chose to exclude the "alias " part.
2016-09-30 21:11:11	Talon_	doubt I'll submit tho :)
2016-09-30 21:11:20	digitok	yeh i literally only just looked at it
2016-09-30 21:11:27	digitok	first thought was regsubex
2016-09-30 21:11:35	Talon_	same here
2016-09-30 21:11:39	digitok	yours is 1 char less than mine
2016-09-30 21:12:15	Talon_	just so happens that $ctime is 10 chrs long :)
2016-09-30 21:12:19	digitok	hehe
2016-09-30 21:14:17	Talon_	I had a shorter one too using /gu (u is for unicode) just pick two unicode chrs with the correct numbers in it, and /(.)/gu and $asc(\t) ... super short
2016-09-30 21:15:46	digitok	cool
2016-09-30 21:17:22	Talon_	odds of winning with regsubex is slim, as I bet every entry that uses it will do the same. so you'd just tie everyone on the non-encode/decode side.
2016-09-30 21:17:32	digitok	yeh
2016-09-30 21:18:16	digitok	lucky jaytea's not around
2016-09-30 21:18:16		[21:18]
2016-09-30 21:18:31	Talon_	largest unicode chr is 1114111
2016-09-30 21:19:08	Talon_	so say you wanted 1234, you could use $chr(1234) as a literal
2016-09-30 21:20:17	digitok	yeh
2016-09-30 21:20:18	Talon_	3 chars short of being able to do it with 1 chr :/

2016-09-30 23:11:58	re101-toucan-420	Hey, I got problem that someone here might help me with.
2016-09-30 23:12:13	re101-toucan-420	I have an array with multiple string "objects". These objects are on this form:
2016-09-30 23:12:21	re101-toucan-420	[60.7,66.7,{label:'ABC',type:'0'}]
2016-09-30 23:12:27	re101-toucan-420	and are separated with ,
2016-09-30 23:12:40	re101-toucan-420	like [60.7,66.7,{label:'ABC',type:'0'}], [64.7,62.6,{label:'ABC',type:'0'}], and so on...
2016-09-30 23:12:50	re101-toucan-420	As you can see, the only difference between them is the coordinates at the start.
2016-09-30 23:13:03	re101-toucan-420	My question is, is it possible to make a regex that goes trough this array and replace each string object so the output will be:
2016-09-30 23:13:11	re101-toucan-420	[1] = { 	["gtype"] = 1, 	["x"] = 60,7, 	["y"] = 66,7, 	["count"] = 1, 	["icon"] = 4, }, [2] = { 	["gtype"] = 1, 	["x"] = 64,7, 	["y"] = 62,6, 	["count"] = 1, 	["icon"] = 4, },

2016-10-02 14:33:34	re101-kiwi-453	what are capture groups?
2016-10-02 14:34:26	+JohnDoe2	they're round parenthesis around things that you want captured, not just matched. Capturing is like "setting apart". You get to call the capture group by ID. Which is why you see $1 and $2 in the replacement string. Those stand for contents of capture group 1, and capture group 2.
