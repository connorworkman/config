2016-09-18 00:51:05	digitok	grep doesn't use pcre unless you use -P (Perl mode) does it?
2016-09-18 00:51:24	+lopid	right, it uses BRE afaik
2016-09-18 00:51:38	digitok	php's regex is quite fully feature
2016-09-18 00:51:39	digitok	+d
2016-09-18 00:51:55	digitok	it supports most of Perl's regex features
2016-09-18 00:56:18	regex101-6516	yes correct
2016-09-18 00:56:42	regex101-6516	although grep's P flag is apparently not particularly reliable
2016-09-18 00:56:57	+lopid	not so portable
2016-09-18 00:56:58	regex101-6516	so its more recommended fr you to use pcregrep instead

2016-09-18 09:13:53	Lindrian	[15:05:08] Anyway, feel free to open an issue on it and see what people think. [15:05:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:06:41] it's a lazy reason i guess [15:06:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:07:03] i just don't want to open a new tab if i have a tab on regex101 already [15:07:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Lindrian	[15:07:37] What is with you and opening tabs? [15:07:37]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:07:38] so i just go there and edit, but of course it's totally something else so i don't want to save the current link [15:07:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Lindrian	[15:07:41] why do you need to open more tabs? [15:07:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:07:53] no i don't here [15:07:53]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Lindrian	[15:07:56] Its a single page application [15:07:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:09:40] well if you read what i said [15:09:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:10:35] alright i guess i can elaborate a bit [15:10:35]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[15:57:56] I'm sure this is easy but let's say I wanted to match "\bOPL\b" as long as it isn't preceded by a two character string [15:57:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[15:58:26] so something like "BLUE OPL" would match but "AA OPL" would not [15:58:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:02:03] https://regex101.com/r/uS1cN1/1 [16:02:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:03:04] eh, add you \b's in, too O:) [16:03:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:03:07] your [16:03:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:07:28] that's exactly what I have and it's not working [16:07:28]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:07:30] hmm [16:07:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:07:44] in what environment? [16:07:44]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:08:01] python3 [16:08:01]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:08:30] hmm [16:08:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:08:33] tried this? https://regex101.com/r/uS1cN1/1#python [16:08:33]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:08:40] so I have a \b between OPL and the negative look behind [16:08:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:08:44] apparently that is messing it up [16:08:44]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:09:09] you have this? https://regex101.com/r/uS1cN1/2 [16:09:09]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:09:20] the \b is redundant there [16:09:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:11:34] https://regex101.com/r/dQ4oV4/1 [16:11:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:11:52] curious why the \b is causing a problem [16:11:52]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:12:01] because I also want to match "OPL" [16:12:01]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:12:10] the \b is non-thingy - it doesn't represent a character [16:12:10]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[16:12:21] because you don't deal with the space [16:12:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:13:04] ok right so \b is zero space [16:13:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[16:13:18] zero width yes [16:13:18]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	 *	lopid [16:13:42] reboots [16:13:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[16:14:10] https://regex101.com/r/dQ4oV4/3 [16:14:10]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[16:14:24] but yes, some \b are not useful here i believe [16:14:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[16:14:53] https://regex101.com/r/dQ4oV4/4 [16:14:53]

2016-09-18 13:24:38	regex101-0982	[21:11:37] -o flag appears to do more than what seems intuitive [21:11:37]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_slade_	[21:14:43] Is there a more efficient way of matching two words separated by anything than / \b word1 \b .* \b word2 \b /x? [21:14:43]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	regex101-0982	[21:16:07] i think making * operator lazy would be more efficient? [21:16:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	+lyxia	[21:19:48] indeed [21:19:48]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_slade_	[21:22:44] Yeah, it's a bit faster. I'm prematurely optimizing anyway, which I should stop doing. [21:22:44]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	+Zarthus	[21:33:11] _slade_: can't prematurely optimize when using regex ;) [21:33:11]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	+Zarthus	[21:34:04] no need for a space between \b either [21:34:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_slade_	[21:36:24] That was just for readability. [21:36:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	+Zarthus	[21:42:57] for us, or yourself? [21:42:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	+Zarthus	[21:43:11] If you want readability you can save the regex101 thing and link it [21:43:11]

2016-09-18 19:44:17	digitok	something like that is much more efficient
2016-09-18 19:44:46	digitok	you really need to anchor the start of the pattern to something
2016-09-18 19:44:56	digitok	since [^"] will match at almost every position
2016-09-18 19:45:02	digitok	hence it times out in my browser

2016-09-18 19:45:33	digitok	i'd prefer version 3 as long as it's always href attribute
2016-09-18 19:45:37	digitok	10x quicker
2016-09-18 19:45:44	+lopid	me too
2016-09-18 19:45:50	digitok	but you can always account for more than just href
2016-09-18 19:46:28	digitok	even just anchoring it to =" cuts it by half
2016-09-18 19:46:43	digitok	but if you know the attribute possibilites that'd be preferrable

2016-09-18 19:53:54	Druid05	*
2016-09-18 19:54:29	digitok	if your regex starts with ", the engine will go until it finds a " and then check each char to see if the rest of the pattern matches
2016-09-18 19:54:42	+lopid	fewer steps
2016-09-18 19:56:14	Druid05	But in my example, i find a filename in text, where filename is *filename and is between " " or ' ' or ( )
2016-09-18 19:56:31	Druid05	is not possible in some way, to check where is *filename position first and check after if is true between " " or  ' ' or ()
2016-09-18 19:56:39	digitok	no
2016-09-18 19:56:51	Druid05	in this way will search directly "multiple words" segment
2016-09-18 19:56:52	Druid05	no?
2016-09-18 19:57:04	digitok	that might be possible in .NET as a believe it handles variable-length lookbehinds
2016-09-18 19:57:13	digitok	but not in any other language
2016-09-18 19:57:37	digitok	surely you can figure out which attributes it could possible exist in
2016-09-18 19:57:46	digitok	possibly*
2016-09-18 19:58:03	Druid05	maybe if i try first time, to see if my word is in text, and only after to check it with regex :-?

2016-09-18 19:58:54	Druid05	so if myword is not in myContent, i will skip some useless steps
2016-09-18 19:59:16	digitok	but yeh you could use python's string functions first to check for '9f.css' if you like

2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:15:49] you'll want to single quote that regex [10:15:49]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:16:04] can you fit more options in? [10:16:04]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:17:17] lol [10:17:17]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:17:21] grep -a-z [10:17:21]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lyxia	[10:18:22] you're missing upper case options [10:18:22]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:19:05] grep -A-Za-z [10:19:05]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	acetakwas	[10:19:55] Okay thanks [10:19:55]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:20:14] grep -EHIin '[[:digit:]]{8}7012' <<<123456787012 [10:20:14]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lyxia	[10:24:17] or use -P [10:24:17]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	acetakwas	[10:26:38] What's -P [10:26:38]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	acetakwas	[10:26:47] You mean -EHIinP [10:26:47]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lyxia	[10:26:54] no -P instead of -E [10:26:54]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	acetakwas	[10:26:59] Okay [10:26:59]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:27:00] man grep. but beware, it's less portable [10:27:00]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lyxia	[10:27:57] \d is not in POSIX regex [10:27:57]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lyxia	[10:28:33] -P is an extension of PCRE which has \d [10:28:33]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:29:44] -P is actually Perl regex [10:29:44]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:29:50] isn't it [10:29:50]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:29:58] man grep and find out! [10:29:58]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:30:05] meaning it actually utilizes perl [10:30:05]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:30:11] atleast that's what i assume [10:30:11]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:30:26] in which case it would even include perl-only features [10:30:26]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:30:40] it does not run perl [10:30:40]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:30:49] ah k [10:30:49]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:31:05] it will probably use libpcre or have its own interpretation of it [10:31:05]

2016-09-20 01:28:32	Aristy	this.config = {
2016-09-20 01:28:32	Aristy	        endpoint: "http://192.168.2.37:8100"

2016-09-20 01:28:46	Aristy	I want to replace the URL with gulp task
2016-09-20 01:28:59	Aristy	I can do it like this: .pipe(replace(/foo(.{3})/g, '$1foo'))
2016-09-20 01:29:06	Aristy	What kind of regex should I write?
2016-09-20 01:29:24	Aristy	It looks like black magic so I'm a bit confused :p
2016-09-20 01:32:06	digitok	replace(/endpoint: "[^"]+"/,'endpoint: "foo"') ?

2016-09-20 01:41:22	digitok	or are single quotes allowed inside double and vice versa?
2016-09-20 01:41:25	digitok	or is it always a url

2016-09-20 01:42:03	Aristy	It can be '...' or "..."
2016-09-20 01:43:02	Aristy	Nvm I added another replace pipe and replaced " with '
2016-09-20 01:43:04	digitok	right but do you need to validate that

2016-09-20 03:47:16	xpistos	Hey all I could use a little help with a regex command. I am trying to get the  data I pulled from curl (curl http://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/profile/xpistos/pull-list)  so it will give me the following information,  Aquaman #7 (tab) DC Comic (tab ) Sep 21st, 2016. Can anyone give me a hand? http://pastebin.com/njeUyrYk
2016-09-20 03:48:12	xpistos	I have been able to get just the comic names and issue number using sed -E 's/<[^<>]*>//g'
2016-09-20 03:48:29	+lyxia	looks like something I'd rather do with a HTML parser
2016-09-20 03:49:13	xpistos	lyxia: The only problem is I am not sure how to do that so I can automate it 
2016-09-20 03:51:23	+Zarthus	ask them to create an API
2016-09-20 03:54:21	+lyxia	http://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/api -> "invalid API key" it seems there is one, though probably for internal use.
2016-09-20 03:55:51	+lyxia	can you do multiline substitution with sed?
2016-09-20 03:56:13	xpistos	not really sure. I am kinda of a newb still learning

2016-09-20 12:34:39	Lindrian	if they are open, check if they are still relevant, if not, comment and close.

2016-09-20 12:34:52	+Ouims	there is the unicode issue
2016-09-20 12:35:04	+OnlineCop	May not be able to get a lot done; I'll get as many as I can, though.

2016-09-20 13:03:50	Lindrian	that issue is implementd Ouims 
2016-09-20 13:03:56	Lindrian	just needs verification
2016-09-20 13:04:17	+Ouims	lol
2016-09-20 13:04:26	+Ouims	ok but you can check it when implementing it :p
2016-09-20 13:04:57	Lindrian	...
2016-09-20 13:05:09	Lindrian	im not even gonna dignify with a response
2016-09-20 13:06:01	+Ouims	well, i'm not trying to be annoying
2016-09-20 13:07:05	Lindrian	Of course I have used the issue as reference while implementing, but I want a second pair of eyes to look through out to ensure I did not mess up or missunderstand.
2016-09-20 13:07:23	+Ouims	i didn't mean this
2016-09-20 13:07:35	+Ouims	i mean you can check the result of your fix
2016-09-20 13:07:47	+Ouims	because it's fairly simple here
2016-09-20 13:07:57	Lindrian	if you dont want to verify just dont
2016-09-20 13:08:04	+Ouims	i am
2016-09-20 13:08:08	+Ouims	but
2016-09-20 13:08:14	Lindrian	then whats the problem
2016-09-20 13:09:10	+Ouims	i'm not too sure why you didn't mark the issue as closed once you checked the fix is working
2016-09-20 13:09:17	+Ouims	no problem
