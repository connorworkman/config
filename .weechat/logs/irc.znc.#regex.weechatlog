2016-09-18 00:51:05	digitok	grep doesn't use pcre unless you use -P (Perl mode) does it?
2016-09-18 00:51:24	+lopid	right, it uses BRE afaik
2016-09-18 00:51:38	digitok	php's regex is quite fully feature
2016-09-18 00:51:39	digitok	+d
2016-09-18 00:51:55	digitok	it supports most of Perl's regex features
2016-09-18 00:56:18	regex101-6516	yes correct
2016-09-18 00:56:42	regex101-6516	although grep's P flag is apparently not particularly reliable
2016-09-18 00:56:57	+lopid	not so portable
2016-09-18 00:56:58	regex101-6516	so its more recommended fr you to use pcregrep instead

2016-09-18 09:13:53	Lindrian	[15:05:08] Anyway, feel free to open an issue on it and see what people think. [15:05:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:06:41] it's a lazy reason i guess [15:06:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:07:03] i just don't want to open a new tab if i have a tab on regex101 already [15:07:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Lindrian	[15:07:37] What is with you and opening tabs? [15:07:37]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:07:38] so i just go there and edit, but of course it's totally something else so i don't want to save the current link [15:07:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Lindrian	[15:07:41] why do you need to open more tabs? [15:07:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:07:53] no i don't here [15:07:53]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Lindrian	[15:07:56] Its a single page application [15:07:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:09:40] well if you read what i said [15:09:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[15:10:35] alright i guess i can elaborate a bit [15:10:35]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[15:57:56] I'm sure this is easy but let's say I wanted to match "\bOPL\b" as long as it isn't preceded by a two character string [15:57:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[15:58:26] so something like "BLUE OPL" would match but "AA OPL" would not [15:58:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:02:03] https://regex101.com/r/uS1cN1/1 [16:02:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:03:04] eh, add you \b's in, too O:) [16:03:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:03:07] your [16:03:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:07:28] that's exactly what I have and it's not working [16:07:28]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:07:30] hmm [16:07:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:07:44] in what environment? [16:07:44]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:08:01] python3 [16:08:01]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:08:30] hmm [16:08:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:08:33] tried this? https://regex101.com/r/uS1cN1/1#python [16:08:33]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:08:40] so I have a \b between OPL and the negative look behind [16:08:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:08:44] apparently that is messing it up [16:08:44]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:09:09] you have this? https://regex101.com/r/uS1cN1/2 [16:09:09]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:09:20] the \b is redundant there [16:09:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:11:34] https://regex101.com/r/dQ4oV4/1 [16:11:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:11:52] curious why the \b is causing a problem [16:11:52]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:12:01] because I also want to match "OPL" [16:12:01]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+lopid	[16:12:10] the \b is non-thingy - it doesn't represent a character [16:12:10]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[16:12:21] because you don't deal with the space [16:12:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	QEternity	[16:13:04] ok right so \b is zero space [16:13:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[16:13:18] zero width yes [16:13:18]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	 *	lopid [16:13:42] reboots [16:13:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[16:14:10] https://regex101.com/r/dQ4oV4/3 [16:14:10]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[16:14:24] but yes, some \b are not useful here i believe [16:14:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	+Vimse	[16:14:53] https://regex101.com/r/dQ4oV4/4 [16:14:53]

2016-09-18 13:24:38	regex101-0982	[21:11:37] -o flag appears to do more than what seems intuitive [21:11:37]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_slade_	[21:14:43] Is there a more efficient way of matching two words separated by anything than / \b word1 \b .* \b word2 \b /x? [21:14:43]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	regex101-0982	[21:16:07] i think making * operator lazy would be more efficient? [21:16:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	+lyxia	[21:19:48] indeed [21:19:48]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_slade_	[21:22:44] Yeah, it's a bit faster. I'm prematurely optimizing anyway, which I should stop doing. [21:22:44]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	+Zarthus	[21:33:11] _slade_: can't prematurely optimize when using regex ;) [21:33:11]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	+Zarthus	[21:34:04] no need for a space between \b either [21:34:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_slade_	[21:36:24] That was just for readability. [21:36:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	+Zarthus	[21:42:57] for us, or yourself? [21:42:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	+Zarthus	[21:43:11] If you want readability you can save the regex101 thing and link it [21:43:11]

2016-09-18 19:44:17	digitok	something like that is much more efficient
2016-09-18 19:44:46	digitok	you really need to anchor the start of the pattern to something
2016-09-18 19:44:56	digitok	since [^"] will match at almost every position
2016-09-18 19:45:02	digitok	hence it times out in my browser

2016-09-18 19:45:33	digitok	i'd prefer version 3 as long as it's always href attribute
2016-09-18 19:45:37	digitok	10x quicker
2016-09-18 19:45:44	+lopid	me too
2016-09-18 19:45:50	digitok	but you can always account for more than just href
2016-09-18 19:46:28	digitok	even just anchoring it to =" cuts it by half
2016-09-18 19:46:43	digitok	but if you know the attribute possibilites that'd be preferrable

2016-09-18 19:53:54	Druid05	*
2016-09-18 19:54:29	digitok	if your regex starts with ", the engine will go until it finds a " and then check each char to see if the rest of the pattern matches
2016-09-18 19:54:42	+lopid	fewer steps
2016-09-18 19:56:14	Druid05	But in my example, i find a filename in text, where filename is *filename and is between " " or ' ' or ( )
2016-09-18 19:56:31	Druid05	is not possible in some way, to check where is *filename position first and check after if is true between " " or  ' ' or ()
2016-09-18 19:56:39	digitok	no
2016-09-18 19:56:51	Druid05	in this way will search directly "multiple words" segment
2016-09-18 19:56:52	Druid05	no?
2016-09-18 19:57:04	digitok	that might be possible in .NET as a believe it handles variable-length lookbehinds
2016-09-18 19:57:13	digitok	but not in any other language
2016-09-18 19:57:37	digitok	surely you can figure out which attributes it could possible exist in
2016-09-18 19:57:46	digitok	possibly*
2016-09-18 19:58:03	Druid05	maybe if i try first time, to see if my word is in text, and only after to check it with regex :-?

2016-09-18 19:58:54	Druid05	so if myword is not in myContent, i will skip some useless steps
2016-09-18 19:59:16	digitok	but yeh you could use python's string functions first to check for '9f.css' if you like

2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:15:49] you'll want to single quote that regex [10:15:49]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:16:04] can you fit more options in? [10:16:04]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:17:17] lol [10:17:17]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:17:21] grep -a-z [10:17:21]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lyxia	[10:18:22] you're missing upper case options [10:18:22]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:19:05] grep -A-Za-z [10:19:05]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	acetakwas	[10:19:55] Okay thanks [10:19:55]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:20:14] grep -EHIin '[[:digit:]]{8}7012' <<<123456787012 [10:20:14]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lyxia	[10:24:17] or use -P [10:24:17]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	acetakwas	[10:26:38] What's -P [10:26:38]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	acetakwas	[10:26:47] You mean -EHIinP [10:26:47]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lyxia	[10:26:54] no -P instead of -E [10:26:54]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	acetakwas	[10:26:59] Okay [10:26:59]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:27:00] man grep. but beware, it's less portable [10:27:00]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lyxia	[10:27:57] \d is not in POSIX regex [10:27:57]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lyxia	[10:28:33] -P is an extension of PCRE which has \d [10:28:33]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:29:44] -P is actually Perl regex [10:29:44]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:29:50] isn't it [10:29:50]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:29:58] man grep and find out! [10:29:58]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:30:05] meaning it actually utilizes perl [10:30:05]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:30:11] atleast that's what i assume [10:30:11]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:30:26] in which case it would even include perl-only features [10:30:26]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:30:40] it does not run perl [10:30:40]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	digitok	[10:30:49] ah k [10:30:49]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	+lopid	[10:31:05] it will probably use libpcre or have its own interpretation of it [10:31:05]

2016-09-20 01:28:32	Aristy	this.config = {
2016-09-20 01:28:32	Aristy	        endpoint: "http://192.168.2.37:8100"

2016-09-20 01:28:46	Aristy	I want to replace the URL with gulp task
2016-09-20 01:28:59	Aristy	I can do it like this: .pipe(replace(/foo(.{3})/g, '$1foo'))
2016-09-20 01:29:06	Aristy	What kind of regex should I write?
2016-09-20 01:29:24	Aristy	It looks like black magic so I'm a bit confused :p
2016-09-20 01:32:06	digitok	replace(/endpoint: "[^"]+"/,'endpoint: "foo"') ?

2016-09-20 01:41:22	digitok	or are single quotes allowed inside double and vice versa?
2016-09-20 01:41:25	digitok	or is it always a url

2016-09-20 01:42:03	Aristy	It can be '...' or "..."
2016-09-20 01:43:02	Aristy	Nvm I added another replace pipe and replaced " with '
2016-09-20 01:43:04	digitok	right but do you need to validate that

2016-09-20 03:47:16	xpistos	Hey all I could use a little help with a regex command. I am trying to get the  data I pulled from curl (curl http://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/profile/xpistos/pull-list)  so it will give me the following information,  Aquaman #7 (tab) DC Comic (tab ) Sep 21st, 2016. Can anyone give me a hand? http://pastebin.com/njeUyrYk
2016-09-20 03:48:12	xpistos	I have been able to get just the comic names and issue number using sed -E 's/<[^<>]*>//g'
2016-09-20 03:48:29	+lyxia	looks like something I'd rather do with a HTML parser
2016-09-20 03:49:13	xpistos	lyxia: The only problem is I am not sure how to do that so I can automate it 
2016-09-20 03:51:23	+Zarthus	ask them to create an API
2016-09-20 03:54:21	+lyxia	http://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/api -> "invalid API key" it seems there is one, though probably for internal use.
2016-09-20 03:55:51	+lyxia	can you do multiline substitution with sed?
2016-09-20 03:56:13	xpistos	not really sure. I am kinda of a newb still learning

2016-09-20 13:07:23	+Ouims	i didn't mean this
2016-09-20 13:07:35	+Ouims	i mean you can check the result of your fix
2016-09-20 13:07:47	+Ouims	because it's fairly simple here
2016-09-20 13:07:57	Lindrian	if you dont want to verify just dont

2016-09-20 14:19:16	stranglerfish	hello
2016-09-20 14:19:21	+OnlineCop	Hi.
2016-09-20 14:21:15	stranglerfish	I'm hoping someone can give me a hand with a regex crossword. I've gotten a fair bit into this site but it offers little explanation, and I'm confused about a certain part. the regex is (.)(.)\2\1 and I don't understand what the \2\1 signify
2016-09-20 14:21:23	stranglerfish	https://regexcrossword.com/challenges/experienced/puzzles/3
2016-09-20 14:21:44	<--	morenoh149 (~harry@69.12.26.166) has quit (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
2016-09-20 14:21:48	stranglerfish	that's the puzzle I'm working on, i've got basically the 1st quadrant of it complete, the simple parts
2016-09-20 14:22:11	+Zarthus	hehe, (.)(.) will never get old
2016-09-20 14:22:56	-->	karakedi (~eAC53C340@unaffiliated/orphan) has joined #regex
2016-09-20 14:22:57	+Zarthus	(.)(.) matches two any characters, the first capturing group is \1, the second capturing group is \2
2016-09-20 14:23:20	+Zarthus	so if your string is "saas", it'll match. if it's "sasa" it won't.
2016-09-20 14:23:45	stranglerfish	one sec i gotta look up capturing group lol
2016-09-20 14:24:22	+Zarthus	(.)(.)\2\1 on test string "abba" basically will transform the string/regex into (.)(.)ba
2016-09-20 14:24:36	+Zarthus	if you don't know capturing groups, I wouldn't worry about how \2 \1 works
2016-09-20 14:24:50	+Zarthus	(they're a bit more advanced than just capturing groups alone)
2016-09-20 14:24:52	stranglerfish	hehe, what should I brush up on then
2016-09-20 14:25:17	stranglerfish	hmm, maybe youtube would have a good visual example?
2016-09-20 14:25:28	+Zarthus	do you not understand my explanation?
2016-09-20 14:25:42	stranglerfish	nope
2016-09-20 14:25:55	+Zarthus	okay, let's ease it up
2016-09-20 14:26:12	stranglerfish	sounds good to me
2016-09-20 14:26:23	+Zarthus	your regex is ([ab])\1  -- you've already learned [ab] matches either a or b
2016-09-20 14:26:49	-->	ctcrnitv (~textual@96-90-249-25-static.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) has joined #regex
2016-09-20 14:26:57	+Zarthus	the capturing group takes note of which character was captured (if the first letter is an 'a', it matches a, if it's 'b' b, and c and beyond don't match)

2016-09-20 14:27:48	+Zarthus	with \1 you look back at what the first capturing group had (for this example, let's go with 'a') - the next character now has to be 'a'
2016-09-20 14:27:48		[14:27]
2016-09-20 14:28:13	+Zarthus	so aa matches, bb matches, but ab or ba doesn't.

2016-09-20 14:29:34	+OnlineCop	stranglerfish: A capture group tells the regex that you want to save what you matched into one slot of an array. Each group of parens creates one more array lot, and stores anything that matches into the corresponding array index.
2016-09-20 14:30:30	+OnlineCop	If you have a single capture group, like  (abc)   then when it matches 'abc' somewhere in the text, it stores that value of  'abc'  in the first array:  MyCaptures[1]

2016-09-20 14:30:54	+OnlineCop	If you add another capture group, it will add another array element:  (abc)(def)  will save  MyCaptures[1] = 
2016-09-20 14:30:56	+OnlineCop	'abc'
2016-09-20 14:31:01	+OnlineCop	and MyCaptures[2] = 'def'

2016-09-20 14:31:32	+OnlineCop	The more groups you add, the more array elements get added.
2016-09-20 14:31:51	+OnlineCop	If you want to refer to the stuff inside of one of the groups, you can use   \1  or  \2  or whatever to access it.
2016-09-20 14:32:07	+OnlineCop	So if you captured   (abc)(def)  and then wanted the  MyCaptures[2]   you would use  \2  to refer to 'def'
2016-09-20 14:32:40	+OnlineCop	When you have   (.)(.)\2\1   it says  MyCaptures[1] = '.', MyCaptures[2] = '.'
2016-09-20 14:32:54	+OnlineCop	Where ('.') is actually any single character: a letter, a space, or whatever.
2016-09-20 14:33:41	+OnlineCop	When it says   \2  then it wants the same value that's in  MyCaptures[2]  to match, so   'abba'  will have  MyCaptures[1] = 'a' and MyCaptures[2] = 'b', so  it matches   MyCaptures[1], MyCaptures[2], MyCaptures[2], and then MyCaptures[1]  in that order.

2016-09-20 14:41:23	+OnlineCop	Notice that I added another '(' at the beginning of the pattern, which shifted all the rest of the array elements down by one.
2016-09-20 14:41:32	+OnlineCop	So  \3\4\3  had to be used instead of  \2\3\2
2016-09-20 14:41:41	stranglerfish	so with (.)T*E*\1 from that crossword. is it the (.) that is the first capture group? not the E*, right?
2016-09-20 14:41:50	+OnlineCop	That's correct.
2016-09-20 14:42:17	+OnlineCop	So it pretty much means that the first and last character is going to be the same character.
2016-09-20 14:42:27	+OnlineCop	But there can be any number of T's followed by any number of E's.

2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:31:50] If you want to refer to the stuff inside of one of the groups, you can use   \1  or  \2  or whatever to access it. [00:31:50]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:32:06] So if you captured   (abc)(def)  and then wanted the  MyCaptures[2]   you would use  \2  to refer to 'def' [00:32:06]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:32:39] When you have   (.)(.)\2\1   it says  MyCaptures[1] = '.', MyCaptures[2] = '.' [00:32:39]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:32:53] Where ('.') is actually any single character: a letter, a space, or whatever. [00:32:53]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:33:40] When it says   \2  then it wants the same value that's in  MyCaptures[2]  to match, so   'abba'  will have  MyCaptures[1] = 'a' and MyCaptures[2] = 'b', so  it matches   MyCaptures[1], MyCaptures[2], MyCaptures[2], and then MyCaptures[1]  in that order.

2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:41:22] Notice that I added another '(' at the beginning of the pattern, which shifted all the rest of the array elements down by one. [00:41:22]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:41:31] So  \3\4\3  had to be used instead of  \2\3\2 [00:41:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	stranglerfish	[00:41:40] so with (.)T*E*\1 from that crossword. is it the (.) that is the first capture group? not the E*, right? [00:41:40]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:41:49] That's correct. [00:41:49]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:42:16] So it pretty much means that the first and last character is going to be the same character. [00:42:16]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:42:26] But there can be any number of T's followed by any number of E's. [00:42:26]

2016-09-20 18:53:19	stranglerfish	[00:52:28] so * means 0 or more right? (.)T*E*\1 could be (.)EE(.) or (.)TT(.) or (.)TE(.) but not (.)ET(.), correct? [00:52:28]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	+OnlineCop	[00:52:43] Correct. [00:52:43]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	stranglerfish	[00:53:29] kk. yeah this crossword probably isn't the best learning resource, it doesn't actually explain it just has a reference on the side. so i've been guessing and just figuring out sort of like it's a sudoku, which taught me some stuff but some other stuff i needed to clarify clearly ;) [00:53:29]

2016-09-20 21:40:10	nschoe	Hi all, I'm trying to write a regex that should match a pattern one or more time, so it's the '+' quantifier. But the pattern is "complex", how do I "group" it? What characters should I use to enclose my complex expression to suffix with '+'?
2016-09-20 21:40:33	nschoe	I've tried ( and ), but this is for remembering a match, so I guess I'm doing something wrong
2016-09-20 21:41:01	amenorrhea	(?: and ) will allow you to group but not remember the match.
2016-09-20 21:41:02	nschoe	I've written this so far: https://regex101.com/r/gE6jB1/1 
2016-09-20 21:42:29	nschoe	amenorrhea, thanks for answering. Yes I've seen that, and tried it. Indeed it doesn't remember the match, but that doesn't work either. In my example, the '.Mycompany', '.SomethingElse' and '.AgainSomethingElse' should be matched by the same "pattern", this is the patter nthat I want to repeat
2016-09-20 21:43:26	nschoe	For information, I'm trying to write a regex to match a dBus interface, so it's this form. There must be at least a dot, so that's why I use -
2016-09-20 21:43:35	nschoe	that's why I used '+' and not '*'
2016-09-20 21:44:37	nschoe	But regex101 shows that my whole string is entirely blue, so it seems to be matched by a '\w*' which doesn't make sense: it should not match dots, right?
2016-09-20 21:44:37		[21:44]
2016-09-20 21:44:41	nschoe	\w is alphanumeric
2016-09-20 21:46:11	amenorrhea	I think the colour of the test string has nothing to do with the colours in the expression. 
2016-09-20 21:46:42	amenorrhea	I think there is just colour (light blue) and it highlights the portion(s) of the test string that are matched by the expression.
2016-09-20 21:46:50	amenorrhea	just one colour**
2016-09-20 21:52:00		[21:46]
2016-09-20 21:52:24	nschoe	amenorrhea, hum okay, seems you're right!
2016-09-20 21:53:53	nschoe	amenorrhea, thanks! Damn, since yesterday I had the right regex, I just thought the colors should match!

2016-09-20 22:57:22	+lopid	an update is a save

2016-09-20 22:57:47		[22:57]
2016-09-20 22:58:35	+Doqnach	thing is, it is more a "save-as with context" than an actual "save"
2016-09-20 22:58:48	+Doqnach	since you save it as a new version of an existing one
2016-09-20 22:59:02	+Doqnach	you don't replace the old one
2016-09-20 22:59:20	+Doqnach	personally I understand this choice and have nothing against it
2016-09-20 23:00:12	+lopid	i think from the user's perspective, they use that button in order to send a link to someone else, not really to save it for later use. that it happens to save it behind the scenes is just a means to the user's end

2016-09-21 05:35:27	+lyxia	what
2016-09-21 05:35:49	+lyxia	startingstrig = dontmatch
2016-09-21 05:35:55	+lyxia	startingstrig = dontmatch cat
2016-09-21 05:36:04	+lyxia	should these match
2016-09-21 05:36:19	jeffreylevesque	just the first
2016-09-21 05:36:52	jeffreylevesque	i mean i could always ad `$` at the end of the solution to have better enforcement
2016-09-21 05:37:02	jeffreylevesque	but i don't have a working solution yet for either cases

2016-09-21 05:38:06	+lyxia	isn't that contradictory
2016-09-21 05:38:20	jeffreylevesque	the second shouldn't match
2016-09-21 05:38:29	+lyxia	why not

2016-09-21 05:50:31	jeffreylevesque	this is my original code - https://bpaste.net/show/a70767211905
2016-09-21 05:51:18	jeffreylevesque	so basically, im trying to add 'startingstring = attribute' line, if there exists a line 'startingstring                 = notattribute'
2016-09-21 05:51:47	jeffreylevesque	it replaces "matches" with what's defined in "line"
2016-09-21 05:52:08	jeffreylevesque	have to escape twice for special chars in puppet
2016-09-21 05:52:17	jeffreylevesque	once for puppet
2016-09-21 05:52:41	jeffreylevesque	i didn't escape my paste properly, but it's not right anyways
2016-09-21 05:53:54	jeffreylevesque	i guess the gears aren't turning in my head
2016-09-21 05:53:58	jeffreylevesque	your solution is good
2016-09-21 05:54:32	jeffreylevesque	startingstrig[ \t=]*.*(?<!dontmatch)$

2016-09-21 07:36:02	kbdkode	hallo. I have a lot of regex expressions that get evaluated for my irc bot in succession (for various parts of the raw irc message that get deconstructed and stored into a dict essentially). I was trying to think of a way to speed this up, and my conclusion was to (before the string gets compiled into a regex object when the event handler is being created), try to find the first letter of what the regex object
2016-09-21 07:36:05	kbdkode	would be (if it can be evaluated) and I just wanted to do it right. For example, if it (stupidly) starts with '^', then I could strip that off. If it starts with '.', then I would know that the first character cannot be evaluated. I just wanted to do it right, so what are all of the possibilities for first characters that are unable to be evaluated, if you will?
2016-09-21 07:36:14	+OnlineCop	I don't mind answering questions. If I minded (or when I'm busy), I simply don't log into IRC that day/week.
2016-09-21 07:36:30	kbdkode	if someone has a better idea, then I would gladly take that into consideration.
2016-09-21 07:38:01	+OnlineCop	kbdkode: So your script takes several regexes as input, and you want to essentially combine them into a single pass so it doesn't keep re-evaluating similar anchors and requirements that always return the same result?
2016-09-21 07:39:36	+OnlineCop	Does your regex script allow the (?x) modifier to allow whitespace and comments?
2016-09-21 07:40:50	kbdkode	for example there must be at least 70 or so (currently and growing) compiled reg. expressions (when the bot loads them) for the "message" part raw irc message (when you do "PRIVMSG nick/#chan :message here"). A lot of them start with the '!' or '@' or '.' characters, while some of them (very few) begin with something else. Some of the "message" attributes are not evaluated immediately (if they have "%nick%" -
2016-09-21 07:40:52	kbdkode	the bots current nick in the string before regex evaluation), but that is irrelevant. Hopefully that makes more sense

2016-09-21 07:41:40	kbdkode	my main concern is something like `message = "(msg1|othermsg2)"
2016-09-21 07:41:50	+OnlineCop	Sure. But you're trying to see whether a few regexes can have certain characters removed?  "^.*stuff"  "^.*different stuff"   where the  ^  can be ignored in the 2nd regex?

2016-09-21 07:42:37	kbdkode	no. I am trying to find a way to (if I don't have to) not evaluate a reg. ex. (because I believe it to be a lot slower than checking to see if a string starts with a certain character)
2016-09-21 07:43:28	kbdkode	so I was trying to figure out how to evaluate the potential first characters. Like re. exp. `(hello|bye)` would produce `['h', 'b']`

2016-09-21 07:45:45	kbdkode	those can change the first character as well. This is why I was hoping that someone could help me find all the "gotchas"
