2016-09-15 21:54:46	DarkCthulhu	Yeah, the expressiveness is nice.
2016-09-15 21:54:59	DarkCthulhu	Hmm.. so, some of the type-checking happens at run-time?
2016-09-15 21:55:12	DarkCthulhu	Oh wait, it's an interpreter thing anyway
2016-09-15 21:55:24	arahael	I imagine it would have to be.  But the interpreter might well be able to make use of some type inferrence.
2016-09-15 21:55:48	DarkCthulhu	Yeah.. but there's a definitely overhead I'm guessing. I wonder how the runtime performance compares.
2016-09-15 21:55:51	arahael	But type inferrence in a dynamic language would be difficult.

2016-09-15 21:56:11	arahael	Well... You don't need to do type inference after bytecode generation.

2016-09-16 14:06:16	wrkrcoop	thanks :}
2016-09-16 14:06:20	rangergord	they probably implement some basic "occasional ack" mechanism. no one would just use raw UDP anymore.
2016-09-16 14:06:28	MisterSyntax	udp is common for games because in games you generally just want to update player positions, bullets fired, etc (fps games e.g.)

2016-09-16 14:10:41	rangergord	wrkrcoop: you have a DNS cache, yes. 1st time you get a hostname, you do a DNS request, 2nd time, you used the previously cached DNS entry. Every OS would have different expiration times for DNS entries, I think.

2016-09-16 18:09:23	pyon	ccat: All of this can be done automatically by the runtime system, without you writing a single line of code, and, most importantly, it won't break your program.

2016-09-16 18:43:42	pyon	vendu: Rather than making a single one-size-fits-all malloc(), it would be nice if you wrote several malloc()s, optimized for different use cases.
2016-09-16 18:43:56	pyon	vendu: I bet the code would be a lot simpler.
2016-09-16 18:44:40	+vendu	pyon, how about creating just one and letting people tune it per-application?

2016-09-16 18:49:14	+vendu	pyon, the motto of ptmalloc is/was "one malloc to rule them all"
2016-09-16 18:49:17	dooby	ccat: SPB is not the same, a member can only be in one SPB, and a SPB can have more than one member involved (1..*)

2016-09-16 18:54:05	Kevin	I fear that it's been already compromised by the government.
2016-09-16 18:54:31	Kevin	Anyone out there?

2016-09-16 18:55:40	farrioth	Kevin: Turn it off. If you're paranoid, take the battery out.
2016-09-16 18:55:54	yitz	Did you miss the big FBI case where they couldn't get the info off the iPhone?
2016-09-16 18:56:20	ccat	dooby: but several members can be apart of the SPB
2016-09-16 18:56:23	Kevin	@yitz They did though. They were able to.
2016-09-16 18:56:51	Kevin	The FBI "couldn't" do it, but they hired someone to do it for them.
2016-09-16 18:56:55	dooby	ccat: that's right, and that's why theres a 1..* relationship
2016-09-16 18:56:59	Kevin	And that was the iPhone.
2016-09-16 18:57:04	yitz	With the physical device and older software, sure. Are you planning on shooting up a clinic and leaving a phone behind for them to work on?
2016-09-16 18:57:07	Kevin	iPhone's come encrypted by default.
2016-09-16 18:57:17	Kevin	@yitz Probably ;)
2016-09-16 18:57:34	Kevin	No, I'm just securing the phone in case I ever lose it.
2016-09-16 18:57:36	yitz	Then we shouldn't be helping you encrypt anything
2016-09-16 18:57:49	yitz	Unless you lose it and the FBI really wants in, you're fine
2016-09-16 18:57:59	Kevin	I've already encrypted my SD Card and Phone.
2016-09-16 18:58:03	jack_rabbit	Kevin, nobody's going to spend the time breaking the encryption on your phone when they find it unless they REALLY want something they know is on it.

2016-09-16 18:58:37	yitz	They can just wipe and sell the phone
2016-09-16 18:58:38	Kevin	jack_rabbit, you never know who they are targetting next.

2016-09-16 18:59:39	jack_rabbit	Kevin, If I were you, I'd be more worried about the 3 million lines of kernel code you've never read that's constantly sending god-knows-what out over the network to god-knows-where.
2016-09-16 18:59:58	_W_	Kevin: here's what a state level adversary will do if they find your phone: Take a complete image of the storage on it, clean the device of all data (by physical means if necessary, by replacing the entire phone if necessary) and install software that behaves the same way the image does at startup (asking for password or whatever) then hand it in to lost+found
2016-09-16 19:00:12	dooby	ccat: Round's will be planned...

2016-09-16 20:10:18	ConceptThoughts	yes it is.. after you go thru the data and its stored you go thru the count array.. from 0 to max data.. then go for yy = 1 to datacnt(dataval).. then sorted(cnt)=yy

2016-09-17 14:37:18	jesuslovesyouthi	I'm confused about c++ strings and I'm not even sure the right questions to ask. Als I know is I though a c++ string was == char[] (char array). Haven't I seen string s; s[n]; in the documentations somewhere? Yed, when I attempt to use them with any of the library functions I need them for it blows up my compiler! Even the examples I see (for isdigit() for example) look like c code not c++ and the string declared like
2016-09-17 14:37:20	jesuslovesyouthi	it was c not c++. So what gives? I can't check whether something is a digit or not in a c++ way? I can't convert that/those chars to int in a c++ way? What I mean by c++ way is - using typt string not a char array.
2016-09-17 14:37:34	jesuslovesyouthi	Any insight would be greatly appreciated
2016-09-17 14:37:36	jesuslovesyouthi	thx

2016-09-17 14:45:22	jesuslovesyouthi	but some of the library fucntions don't seem to play nice with strings (or something) - isdigit() and atoi() are examples

2016-09-17 14:47:07	B00gerDaddy1	if isdigit(0 and atoi() is from the c libraries, then they are not c++
2016-09-17 14:47:23	B00gerDaddy1	you can mix the two or use just the c++ libraries
2016-09-17 14:47:46	jesuslovesyouthi	a c type funtion - now I need to learn about that (seems like they just took some c libraries and stuffed em in c++)
2016-09-17 14:48:59	B00gerDaddy1	you really should start with c then go to c++.  it makes c++ easier to understand as it is a descendant of c.

2016-09-17 14:49:02	jesuslovesyouthi	Now I wonder if there are alternative functions in c++ libraries (standard libraries I mean)?? <---- that's the prize (my prize) - to find those alternatives and use them (no offense but screw mixing them)

2016-09-17 15:43:19	ARCADIVS	What their solution allows is for you to program an embedded programming language indirectly with higher-order synxtax in the metalanguage without explicit naming of variables in the object language.
2016-09-17 15:44:17	ARCADIVS	Their "lam" and "app" interface lets you use variable binding in the metalanguage to represent variable binding in the object language.

2016-09-17 15:48:12	ARCADIVS	DarkCthulhu: it's potentially useful to those making a domain specific language that has variable binding and also to those making general purpose programming languages especially when it is bothersome to create a concrete syntax and you'd rather write your programs in a metalanguage (Haskell in this paper).

2016-09-18 02:06:36	ConceptThoughts	rindolf because information is used to do things that you realy arent certain if its what you want to do or not.. because you dont knwo this it isnt knoweldge
2016-09-18 02:06:43	bizarrefish	UX design is needed, but UX is overloaded at the moment, because there's such a huge gap between users and programmers., and there doesn't need to be.

2016-09-18 02:07:37	bizarrefish	We need higher-level primitives that the programmers and the users can both leverage, meaning that the construction of complex software won't just involve building a huge tower of abstraction.

2016-09-18 02:11:48	ConceptThoughts	rindolf ill purposes are always later regreted.. which means they didnt have knowledge of the regret later, that means its only information on how to do what they are doing and not knowledge of the full scope of what they are doing
2016-09-18 02:11:55	bizarrefish	Imagine if the files in your filesystem could be objects exported from a program. Then we wouldn't need to invent new ways for programs to talk to eachother, because it'd just be built into the file abstraction which programs can use already.
2016-09-18 02:12:13	njcomsec	how did we get to the difference between the defnitions of knowledge and information to talking about moral choices lol
2016-09-18 02:12:16	Stefan26	we had to make a GUI with a custom rule set like "always replace leading + with 00" , "reject numbers starting with +44" etc
2016-09-18 02:12:30	bizarrefish	Users need to be educated with good concepts and abstractions, not kept as far away as possible from the shitty ones that programmers are forced to use
2016-09-18 02:12:32	Stefan26	when it could all be done with a single legal_regex

2016-09-18 09:13:48	ezekielnoob	[18:58:50] pretty ugly [18:58:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	+rindolf	[18:58:52] it's huge and inelegant. [18:58:52]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	deniska	[18:59:04] Wilawar: well, you need a function which maps a uniform random number to non-uniform you need [18:59:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	jack_rabbit	[18:59:06] Well it *WAS* designed by committee. [18:59:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	ezekielnoob	[18:59:12] rindolf i understand [18:59:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Wilawar	[18:59:19] … by mapping those numbers stated to be from the closed interval [0;1] to the numbers I’d like to have by bucketing according to their calculated probability. So, if I had three numbers and the probabilities 1/2, 1/3, 1/6, I’d assign 1 to all returns between 0 and 1/2, assign 2 to all between 1/2 and 5/6 and 3 to the rest [18:59:19]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	+rindolf	[18:59:21] jack_rabbit: heh, heh. [18:59:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	ezekielnoob	[18:59:27] i will try scheme also [18:59:27]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	ezekielnoob	[18:59:34] i'l lget a feel on where i want to go from that [18:59:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	ezekielnoob	[19:00:25] rindolf do you have a quick example of what you find ugly? [19:00:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	+rindolf	[19:01:08] ezekielnoob: I forgot the specifics. [19:01:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	deniska	[19:01:12] Wilawar: looks fine so far, what's the problem? :) [19:01:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	ezekielnoob	[19:01:14] alright no problem [19:01:14]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Wilawar	[19:01:25] Now I’m just not sure whether I should use '<=' or '<' for those comparisons, as the first fails for elements with a probability of zero (or very close to it) but the second one for the probability value one. [19:01:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Wilawar	[19:02:25] I’ll also have to admit that my question seems rather trivial in hindsight :D [19:02:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	deniska	[19:03:11] Wilawar: as far as float numbers go, the difference between < and <= is pretty non-important here [19:03:11]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Wilawar	[19:03:52] Which one is more correct dealing with discrete numbers? I don’t need the highest accuracy, it’s for randomly generating playlist queries to Jamendo, but I was still curious which one to use [19:03:52]

2016-09-18 09:13:48	Wilawar	[19:08:00] And there I have to concede again :| [19:08:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Wilawar	[19:08:12] saijanai_: Didn’t hear about that [19:08:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Wilawar	[19:08:38] deniska: ok, must have confused the docs with something else I used, then, maybe. Sorry for that [19:08:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	saijanai_	[19:08:39] Some random greifer walks up claiming to be able to show you something really cool if you type a command into your chat window [19:08:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	saijanai_	[19:08:56] that activates Lua's parsing of all text as commands [19:08:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	saijanai_	[19:09:02] and so... [19:09:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	deniska	[19:09:24] saijanai_: that's not a bigger exploit than asking someone to paste something in a dev console with facebook open [19:09:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Wilawar	[19:09:28] It was never a good idea to blindly execute commands people told you, just about anywhere :P [19:09:28]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	saijanai_	[19:09:53] sure, but most WoW palyers aren't programmers [19:09:53]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	saijanai_	[19:10:20] always assume the end-user hasn't a clue [19:10:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	saijanai_	[19:10:39] Murphy's Law comes from an incident during the testing of the rocket sled back in the late 50's [19:10:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Stefan26	[19:10:43] Hey manuel_ I looked into that 3 glasses problem... I don't think it has a simple closed form [19:10:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	saijanai_	[19:11:02] and Captain Murphy was the systems analyst who designed the thing [19:11:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	saijanai_	[19:11:35] and someone literally hammered the battery in backwards and the sled blew up when it was used (famous film clip -you' ve probably seen it) [19:11:35]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Stefan26	[19:12:01] but I don't know [19:12:01]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Wilawar	[19:12:30] It should be well-known by now not to do that and it can’t really be fixed at any other level. I mean, it’s been around since 'read-mail real-fast' in what must have been the seventies ;) [19:12:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Stefan26	[19:12:49] but that codefights.com page looked fun [19:12:49]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	saijanai_	[19:12:52] According tot he story, Captain Murphy shouted "My GAWD! If you give them a chance to do it wrong, they'll do it wrong" [19:12:52]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Stefan26	[19:12:54] how are solutions rated? [19:12:54]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	saijanai_	[19:13:23] The coloney, suit still smoldering, snapped has fingers and said "Murphy's Law: if things can go wrong, they WILL go wrong" [19:13:23]

2016-09-18 09:38:46	Stefan26	Short version: You have two biased coins that you take to a casino. Coin X produces tails with probability p, Coin Y produces tails with probability q. Casino manager allows you to flip either of these coins 100 times in sequence... At the end you get paid 1$ for each tails landed. The only decisions you have to is whether to use coin X or Y for game number k (k=1,...100)
2016-09-18 09:39:12	Stefan26	But you don't know p and q from the start... but you can use the outcome of previous tosses in order to guess p and q

2016-09-18 09:40:50	manuel_	nah it's just a DP knapsack kind of thing
2016-09-18 09:40:53	Stefan26	the naive strategy is to start with coin X... toss that until heads comes up... then switch to Y and toss that until heads comes up... and after that you always pick the coin with the historically best tail-to-heads-ratio

2016-09-18 09:42:05	+ackpacket	Stefan26, if you start with coin x, and toss it 50 times, and heads comes up, then switch to y, toss it twice, and on the 2nd time head come up, you're saying switch back to X?  Which has a 49:1 in favor of tails, vs Y, which is currently 1:1?
2016-09-18 09:42:11	Stefan26	I can paste the problem in its full context next time :) (although source is in swedish comments)
2016-09-18 09:42:18	+ackpacket	Stefan26, Simply switching when you find heads is non optimal

2016-09-18 09:48:33	+ackpacket	For example given a coin that has 49 heads and 1 tails, vs a coin that has only 1 heads, is it *really* a better choice to use the coin that's at 100% heads?
2016-09-18 09:49:18	manuel_	it's a bernoulli distribution, so the p({n draws} | p) = p^(number_tails) (1 - p)^(n - number_tails)
2016-09-18 09:49:32	manuel_	gives you the probability for the out come of tails out of n draws given p

2016-09-18 09:53:58	manuel_	but the more draws you have, the better your estimate is
2016-09-18 09:54:17	+ackpacket	What I'm saying is, for all possible biases
2016-09-18 09:54:47	+ackpacket	There is a probability function p(bias=X | results_so_far)
2016-09-18 09:54:59	+ackpacket	You don't arrive at a bias

2016-09-18 09:55:16	+ackpacket	But, that's still useful
2016-09-18 09:55:31	+ackpacket	Given a coin with a bias, there is value to tossing it again

2016-09-18 09:57:56	manuel_	but if you assume that p is drawn out of a beta distribution, you actually know that p(bias = X | results_so_far) is the PDF of another beta distribution
2016-09-18 09:58:02	cherim	That's precisely "toss the coin with the current best heads-to-tails ratio".

2016-09-18 10:32:11	B3nszy	before even learning to program?
2016-09-18 10:32:19	Wilawar	It seems likely to me that without access to any programming language, it’ll be a lot harder for you to assess the correctness, quality and performance of any algorithms you design.
2016-09-18 10:32:27	Batholith	Just check the math categories out and start learning from the point where you're not good.
2016-09-18 10:32:54	Siegfried	well you want to do theoretical compsci right

2016-09-18 10:36:17	Wilawar	Like, most people who learn about algorithms pay way too much attention to O() categories and try way too little how fast their stuff actually runs. Irregular jumps can give the branch predictor problems and looping can be faster than just about any elaborate search function if there are only few elements to consider

2016-09-18 12:13:52	von-strauss	Okay
2016-09-18 12:13:53	nb-ben	nooblet: basically with vagrant you commit virtual images and so you just basically type "vagrant up" and you have the thing running locally

2016-09-18 12:15:31	Mechaman	von-strauss: However, depending on how your tree is formatted and whether or not it is balanced etc. you will be able to understand the computational complexity better
2016-09-18 12:15:50	nb-ben	nooblet: perhaps you can shove an IDE in a thumbdrive along with git binaries
2016-09-18 12:16:36	nooblet	nb-ben: The computers are the same everywhere, and have the bare minimum for a diversity of subjects, only one of which, that is also very new, is computer science. The computers just have python, IDLE and scratch installed....
2016-09-18 12:16:39	nb-ben	nooblet: so you can clone your repository somewhere on the current host PC, do your work with the IDE, commit it and then delete the local repository

2016-09-18 13:17:36	Henke37	what is bestness? it is the cost of moving to the node (known) and the estimated cost to go from the node to the target (estimate)
2016-09-18 13:21:47	Henke37	A* is designed under the assumption that as long as the estimated cost to the goal is never larger than the actual cost to the goal
2016-09-18 13:21:47	Henke37	this is why A* aborts the search when it finds the first path. because it knows that any other paths are worse

2016-09-18 13:21:48	Mechaman	True. So precomputing all the H(n) for the whole graph adds unnecessary calculations... however, storing the already computed h(n) could serve useful if space isn't a concern for you

2016-09-18 13:24:35	deniska	[22:35:15] which context? [22:35:15]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	soulisson	[22:35:35] deniska, this sentence "data stored in memory" [22:35:35]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	deniska	[22:36:15] "contained" is more rarely used [22:36:15]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	soulisson	[22:37:38] deniska, indeed, but still a valid synonymous, right? [22:37:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	deniska	[22:38:57] probably? I'm not a native speaker so I can't really feel whether it sounds weird or not [22:38:57]

2016-09-18 13:24:35	Mechaman	[23:15:39] this keeps you from having to compute all the nodes the h(n) that may not even be considered in some remote corner of the graph [23:15:39]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Henke37	[23:16:01] A* is optimal. this means that it always finds the best path. not good enough, best. [23:16:01]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Henke37	[23:16:32] it does this by trying each node in the order of decreasing bestness [23:16:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Henke37	[23:17:36] what is bestness? it is the cost of moving to the node (known) and the estimated cost to go from the node to the target (estimate) [23:17:36]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Henke37	[23:18:19] A* is designed under the assumption that as long as the estimated cost to the goal is never larger than the actual cost to the goal [23:18:19]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Henke37	[23:19:09] this is why A* aborts the search when it finds the first path. because it knows that any other paths are worse [23:19:09]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Mechaman	[23:20:12] True. So precomputing all the H(n) for the whole graph adds unnecessary calculations... however, storing the already computed h(n) could serve useful if space isn't a concern for you [23:20:12]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	max123	[23:24:18] Hey guys, So i have a variable called answers which looks like this: var answers = [['To seek the grail','I don\'t know that','To be in Monty Python'],['African or European?','92', '5']];  How do I push a new array to the same variable? [23:24:18]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	max123	[23:24:28] So a third set of three answers [23:24:28]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	max123	[23:24:32] in javascript [23:24:32]

2016-09-18 15:39:30	manuel_	that's not entirely possible in c++ due to the way c++ works

2016-09-18 15:40:22	manuel_	like, one variable could just be eliminated completely, because it's unused, or because it can be folded together, or stored purely in a register
2016-09-18 15:40:54	manuel_	promach: you can create a binary with something called a symbol table, that tells the debugger "the value of a is at this address in memory" or "the value of A is a this relative index from the top of the current frame"

2016-09-18 15:41:20	manuel_	a debug build is important because often the compiler omits to use a top of frame pointer altogether, which makes it very hard for a debugger to understand what's going on and where things are in memory

2016-09-18 15:42:39	manuel_	-fno-omit-frame-pointer tells the compiler to keep the frame pointer
2016-09-18 15:42:46	manuel_	-g means include DWARF symbols

2016-09-18 16:54:49	Coldseeker	otherwise, we'd have to say that INTERCAL and Piet are legitimate general purpose languages. equal to Java and C.
2016-09-18 16:54:57	bonhoeffer_	is Excel (microsoft) a turing complete language?

2016-09-18 16:55:19	arathald	I would probably personally define something as "domain-specific" if it's an otherwise useful language would be a completely inappropriate choice for very large chunk of programming problems

2016-09-18 16:56:48	_W_	bonhoeffer_: yep
2016-09-18 16:56:49	Menche	probably depends which lisp dialect

2016-09-18 16:57:34	bonhoeffer_	Little languages are small DSLs that do not include many features found in general-purpose programming languages (GPLs) [Bentley 1986, p. 715].

2016-09-18 16:57:36	arathald	considering a domain-specific language could be the exact right choice in a lot of cases, or a general purpose language the wrong choice in a lot of other cases

2016-09-18 16:59:35	bonhoeffer_	they define: Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are languages tailored to a specific application domain. They offer substantial gains in expressiveness and ease of use compared with general-purpose programming languages in their domain of application.

2016-09-18 16:59:59	arathald	SQL, for example, is definitely a DSL, but it's so broadly used that it's not a bad choice for a company to put investment into
2016-09-18 17:00:08	_W_	arathald: narrow in the sense that it's a bad choice to standardize in for arbitrary unknown future tasks
2016-09-18 17:00:15	_W_	because some of those tasks it just can't do very well

2016-09-18 17:00:58	arathald	_W_: I'd say the same thing is true of any language, domain-specific or not, since even general-purpose languages have strengths and weaknesses
2016-09-18 17:01:00	_W_	like, you could probably make a decent web spider in Mirc scripting, but if you needed to make telephony software, Mirc scripting probably will not be suitable

2016-09-18 17:01:36	bonhoeffer_	but, say mips, or x86 32 bit asm is very domain specific to that processor, no?

If I for example read some source code, I usually git blame it if it's not documented enough - that way I can see the commit messages that introduced code with the remarks what the change was supposed to do. Such things go a long way to understand pieces.
2016-09-18 22:23:58	dminuoso	StoBrendo: Such factors weight greatly on how easy it is to grasp some code base.

2016-09-19 06:38:15	jasondockers__	dminuoso, by cooperative multi-tasking do you mean the process decides when to give up control?
2016-09-19 06:38:29	dminuoso	jasondockers__: But most syscalls end up calling the scheduler, cooperating with it that way.

2016-09-19 06:39:44	dminuoso	jasondockers__: So modern kernels are a mixture. They have a watch dog timer running but at a low resolution (think like 100ms)

2016-09-19 06:46:11	dminuoso	jasondockers__: The point is that any syscall makes the expense of flushing your pipeline, hurting cache performance. Now that you made the expensive task of getting into the kernel, you might as well check with the scheduler whether it has something else that deserves some CPU time
2016-09-19 06:46:25	rindolf	Guest47071: are you appending the whole text at once?
2016-09-19 06:46:34	dminuoso	jasondockers__: It's that line of thinking that allows any syscall to effectively cooproate with other multitasks.
2016-09-19 06:46:34	password2	ie , they expand both inward and outward
2016-09-19 06:46:38	dminuoso	But at the schedulers discretion.
2016-09-19 06:46:46	dminuoso	The scheduler might not run something else if it deems so.

2016-09-19 06:47:20	jasondockers__	dminuoso, okay, that makes sense. though I don't exactly know what you mean by flushing the pipeline. I could see how cache locality could be messed up by making a system call, however.

2016-09-19 14:17:07	hpardis	so im a sysadmin learning python right now. im hoping to move into dev work some day, but im getting mixed feelings like i should be learning java to stand a chance getting a job.

2016-09-19 14:21:58	montanonic	Anyways, hpardis, you will get far with Python. It's a good language. I would encourage you to look into a Lisp-like language thought at some point, to get another perspective.

2016-09-19 14:46:39	montanonic	in which case, I'd ask: is C's abstract computer about as close as we want to get?
2016-09-19 14:46:47	montanonic	is it worth making it any more elaborate?
2016-09-19 14:46:58	deniska	Early programming languages were inspired by CPU interface, todays CPU interfaces are inspired by programming languages :)

2016-09-19 14:51:28	marchelzo	deniska: i agree. but the fact that PyPy is faster than CPython doesn't prove anything, since CPython doesn't use JIT.
2016-09-19 14:51:39	montanonic	manuel_: I'm not sure it is a good target, I just imagine it might be, given that the whole goal of Lisp is to having a minimally Turing complete language. This means it has a small surface area, but also, a ton of power and extensibility
2016-09-19 14:51:46	montanonic	I imagine it would just be easier to write compilers for it
2016-09-19 14:52:01	montanonic	and then you could use it to build arbitrarily complicated languages rather easily compared to many other languages
2016-09-19 14:52:03	deniska	Besides Lisp machines there were also Forth machines \o/
2016-09-19 14:52:05	montanonic	given that it is self-extensible
2016-09-19 14:52:30	pyon	deniska: Forth is also interesting, but it doesn't lend itself to building large systems. Which is kind of the point, but still...
2016-09-19 14:52:38	deniska	montanonic: brainfuck is also a minimally turing complete :)
2016-09-19 14:53:00	montanonic	but that's just my pondering; I'm not sure. deniska how easy is it to write a brainfuck interpreter in brainfuck?
2016-09-19 14:53:13	manuel_	why not just write again llvm ir
2016-09-19 14:53:42	deniska	montanonic: https://github.com/canoon/bfbf/blob/master/bf.bf not too hard :P
2016-09-19 14:53:43	pyon	montanonic: Writing a Lisp interpreter in Lisp is only simple if your pre-existing Lisp implementation already has the primitives for implementing a Lisp interpreter. Otherwise, it can get quite hairy.
2016-09-19 14:53:54	montanonic	deniska: lol
2016-09-19 14:54:01	manuel_	a lisp interpreter in c is not the end of the world
2016-09-19 14:54:12	manuel_	you can do a pretty nice one in about a weekend
2016-09-19 14:54:12	adamg	yeah. silicon isn't some self-describing recursive thought process. it's a shit-ton of logic gates. There's a reason why C is widespread and lisp machines are not.
2016-09-19 14:54:34	pyon	manuel_: Yeah, but it won't be a Lisp implementation you'd actually want to use as a systems language.
2016-09-19 14:54:35	manuel_	even th lisp machine had fairly standard computing hardware, with gc tagging support builtin
2016-09-19 14:54:48	deniska	I kinda want to implement a brainfuck CPU in some sort of a logisim
2016-09-19 14:54:53	manuel_	pyon: why not?
2016-09-19 14:54:59	deniska	But I didn't find a logisim which wouldn't be awkward to use
2016-09-19 14:54:59	montanonic	My little experiment is to write a super tiny Lisp, then write some macros that turn into C code, then see if I can enforce some Rust-style memory safety, then rewrite its interpreter in itself.

2016-09-19 14:57:42	montanonic	but if there's already work out there I'd like to see it
2016-09-19 14:58:26	pyon	Another approach that could work is having linear types. That is, every object has to be used exactly once. (Though you may use that object to create two or more clones.)
2016-09-19 14:58:39	pyon	But it's actually not that performant if you do it that naïvely.
2016-09-19 14:58:57	pyon	Might as well use a garbage collector. :-p
2016-09-19 14:59:28	montanonic	oh yeah, that's a cool idea. my naive idea was to just use macros that counted up and tagged the references
2016-09-19 14:59:32	montanonic	and see how far I could get with that
2016-09-19 14:59:48	montanonic	was/is
2016-09-19 14:59:53	pyon	You mean perform the counting at compile time or at runtime?
2016-09-19 15:00:02	pyon	If it's at runtime, reference counting *is* garbage collection.

For example if I'm programming an FTP implementation, how can I continously check for data on the socket say every 500 milliseconds? BufferedReader.readline() seems to hang until there is data to read. I'm using java

2016-09-19 16:59:37	pyon	I can only guess, but perhaps “positional notation” refers to the fact that the “weight” of each digit is determined by its position.

2016-09-19 20:47:14	montanonic	Personally, Go to me is a good language and also a disappointment. I understand that its creators just wanted to be pragmatic and solve current software problems better with Go, but incremental steps in an ecosystem with deep, fundamental flaws that have had better solutions ever since the 60s (that are conveniently forgotten, repeatedly), is just not at all the future of programming.
2016-09-19 20:49:26	montanonic	Erlang, on the other hand, has a great paradigm for scaling software. Shame it's not more mainstream.

2016-09-20 00:45:34	adsc	but it already disgusted me as a student that fellows who didn't understand jack shit could still slide through most courses somehow

2016-09-20 00:46:15	adsc	are you seriously trying to tell me that you can forget loops now that we have the internet? I mean, you can just look them up, right?
2016-09-20 00:46:15	Yaiyan	Yes, most people get A*/A/B in it, but the vast majority of people wouldn't sit the exam

2016-09-20 00:47:51	Yaiyan	The difference is universities aren't made equal

2016-09-20 06:00:39	binarious	Hi, can someone give me a guidance on how to refactor some code via functional programming? I wanted to restructure this method via FP: https://github.com/Sirimangalo/meditation-plus-server/pull/51/files#diff-7a8b30ad3dd7d2204cdbe9df23547f52L83 And ended up with this: https://github.com/Sirimangalo/meditation-plus-server/pull/51/files#diff-3a35397eadc4c1ec50d59e2a1fe44705R5 It’s more code and „feels“ a bit more complicated. Any idea

2016-09-20 07:52:56	pyon	bizarrefish: Actually, if you think about it, what Haskell's type classes do for you is precisely automatically plumbing singletons around.
2016-09-20 07:53:37	jrslepak	pyon: at first glance, it looks rather like the ocaml trick of using modules to represent type class instances
2016-09-20 07:53:41	JX7P	in SmallTalk, singletons are not particularly special
2016-09-20 07:54:03	pyon	jrslepak: Yes, it's precisely that.
2016-09-20 07:54:31	JX7P	really, they are needless, because factories (classes) and objects (class instances) are not in any way different
2016-09-20 07:54:42	jrslepak	(and I'm not sure there's a way to have multiple order relations on the same type without doing something equivalent)
2016-09-20 07:54:53	JX7P	thus one can just define a factory that doesn't make an object in its new messagehandler

2016-09-20 13:31:27	nick5	it is a man who remained a child

2016-09-20 13:33:39	Gryllida	however, as a person, I can say I think a programmer is an artist and not a tool

2016-09-20 15:12:58	stonetear	Hello all- I may be facing a very interesting situation where I need to strip out a VIP's (VERY VIP) email address from a bunch of archived email that I have both in a live Exchange mailbox, as well as a PST file. Basically, they don't want the VIP's email address exposed to anyone, and want to be able to either strip out or replace the email address in the to/from fields in all of the emails we want to send out.
2016-09-20 15:12:58	stonetear	I am not sure if something like this is possible with PowerShell, or exporting all of the emails to MSG and doing find/replaces with a batch processing program of some sort.
2016-09-20 15:12:58	stonetear	Does anyone have experience with something like this, and/or suggestions on how this might be accomplished?

It's made more horrible by the fact that a lot of substandard programmers use it, to the point where it's much much easier to generate total and utter crap with it. Quite frankly, even if the choice of C were to do *nothing* but keep the C++ programmers out, that in itself would be a huge reason to use C.

2016-09-20 18:21:48	noelthermo	sorry ^^ this was the intro to go through that was actually helpful
2016-09-20 18:22:23	pyon	Now that I think about it, what would C programmers think about a language that has Rust-like lifetimes, but no generics taking types as arguments?
2016-09-20 18:22:42	pyon	That is, the language would have generics, but generics could only be parameterized by lifetimes.
2016-09-20 18:23:04	FreeFull	I think C programmers won't generally be opposed to generics on principle, just to overcomplicated stuff like C++ templates
2016-09-20 18:23:14	tmerr	I love C *except* for its lack of generics

2016-09-20 18:24:27	pyon	Lately, I'm of the idea that the combination of sized types and generics is very awkward.
2016-09-20 18:24:28	--	daey_ is now known as daey
2016-09-20 18:24:37	FreeFull	I believe right now Rust's lifetimes don't affect the compiler output at all, they're just a layer of type checking
2016-09-20 18:24:38	pyon	At least generics parameterized by other types.
2016-09-20 18:24:45	pyon	FreeFull: That's right.
2016-09-20 18:25:07	pyon	Which is why I think C programmers could appreciate a language with lifetimes but no type parameters.
2016-09-20 18:25:22	tmerr	Meh I don't see the confusion with sized types
2016-09-20 18:25:56	FreeFull	Generally, being able to parametrise collections and functions by type is something you'll want in most statically-typed languages
2016-09-20 18:25:59	pyon	If you analyze C codebases out there, C programmers are actually not averse to rolling their own dynamic typing.
2016-09-20 18:26:10	pyon	They handroll their own tagged unions all over the place.
2016-09-20 18:26:47	pyon	It seems to me that they'd much rather use dynamic types than generic types.
2016-09-20 18:27:00	pyon	Unlike C++ programmers, who genuinely appreciate compile-time genericity.
2016-09-20 18:27:07	tmerr	They're also not averse to using generic data structure libraries, simulated with void pointers or sketchy ass macros :)

Like you are writing to a database and it's says it fails or your downloading a file and it fails. Since it's automated it's not like you can just have message popup.

2016-09-20 20:40:43	Siegfried	one of the most popular ones is free tuition but they take a cut of your first year salary

2016-09-20 21:23:19	Siegfried	tmerr It was designed to make software development easy for groups of people, which means few ways of doing things, a small set of orthogonal features, and very readable code

2016-09-20 22:20:04	montanonic	with Rust, it's obvious: it's a systems language, you basically need them
2016-09-20 22:20:25	montanonic	but from the little experience I've had, it seems like you should ditch static typing for a dynamic language as soon as you can
2016-09-20 22:20:52	montanonic	and by dynamic, I particularly mean languages with a very high degree of interactivity, run-time introspection, reflection, etc...
2016-09-20 22:21:04	montanonic	and ideally, a very small amount of primitive types, to keep things simple
2016-09-20 22:21:04		[22:21]
2016-09-20 22:21:23	pyon	That very introspection is what makes it difficult to prove anything about programs.

2016-09-20 22:41:56	FreeFull	I'm feeling pretty comfortable with Rust nowadays, although being unable to parametrise over the V in V<T> properly sucks
2016-09-20 22:42:07	extor	Lots of people seem to like Haskell just for the sake of personal enjoyment it seems since it's not really a widely deployed language. Must be something about the syntax that pleases the programming mind.

But it does intrigue me enough to check out this mystery one day because a lot of people seem to want to code in Haskell just for the pleasure of interacting with Haskell's core

2016-09-20 22:45:44	pyon	montanonic: If you're fighting the type system, you're doing it wrong. You're never going to win against the type system.
2016-09-20 22:45:48	montanonic	sbrg: at a certain level, monadic transformer composition, and things like that, start to become more mentally taxing than freeing
2016-09-20 22:45:54	FreeFull	My favourite Prolog-like language is http://picat-lang.org/
2016-09-20 22:46:03	tmerr	The only thing that really bothers me about Haskell is that while you gain certainty about the correctness of your program, you lose certainty about the performance, when you're juggling lazy evaluation and crazy functional abstractions in your head
2016-09-20 22:46:08	montanonic	freeing in terms of: yay, my program is probably reasonable and won't crash at runtime
2016-09-20 22:46:39	FreeFull	montanonic: I find that most of the time that a good type system gives me an error, it's because of a mistake I made
2016-09-20 22:46:43	montanonic	but the fact that things like Erlang say: your program is going to crash at runtime, gives you an entirely different way to think about safe programs
2016-09-20 22:46:50	pyon	montanonic: A type system is ultimately a logic. (Yes, a formal logic.) It tells you what kinds of things make sense. If you have your own ideas, and they're different from the type system's, well, you're wrong, at least if you don't want to switch languages.
2016-09-20 22:46:58	sbrg	montanonic: I don't consider it "fighting the type system" after writing haskell for so long. I can certainly agree that the type errors that you may see when using some of the most advanced features(read: extensions) of the type system can be daunting and hard to figure out. but for the most part, I just think of type errors as the compiler being a bro. it's like "woah, bro. check yourself before you wreck yoself, dude. you can't just
2016-09-20 22:46:58	sbrg	do shit with that Maybe like it always contains a value, ya dumb fuck"
2016-09-20 22:47:08	sbrg	and I'm like "woah, dude. thanks, bro."
2016-09-20 22:47:14	sbrg	yes that is how I speak in real life
2016-09-20 22:47:18	montanonic	FreeFull: likewise; it works. But again, when you're knee deep in a transformer stack, and you see a lisp macro do the same stuff succinctly and legibly, you... question things
2016-09-20 22:47:45	montanonic	pyon: yes and I'm not saying that the type system is wrong
2016-09-20 22:47:53	FreeFull	montanonic: Right, I never got deep into transformers
2016-09-20 22:48:02	montanonic	again, 8 months of Haskell, and I took it seriously
2016-09-20 22:48:04	sbrg	how can a lisp macro do anything remotely similar to what a monad transformer stack can do? I don't see those as things that you can really compare.
2016-09-20 22:48:10	FreeFull	montanonic: Languages related to Haskell, such as Idris, have something called effects
2016-09-20 22:48:16	FreeFull	Which don't carry a lot of the same problems
2016-09-20 22:48:31	FreeFull	Although they aren't strictly 100% equivalent to transformers
2016-09-20 22:48:34	montanonic	sbrg: I mean, what can an arbitrary parser/interpreter do? anything
2016-09-20 22:48:50	montanonic	Lisp is a minimal Turing Complete language expressed in terms of the Lambda Calculus
2016-09-20 22:49:22	sbrg	tmerr: I personally think that this is mostly a non-issue. I have written pretty big and complicated Haskell projects and very rarely have I run into performance issues. And when it happens, it is often very easy to find the culprit. if you can't spot it in your code, you can almost always find it using the profiler.
2016-09-20 22:49:27	pyon	montanonic: Lisp is far from minimalistic. It's full of ad-hoc stuff.
2016-09-20 22:49:38	montanonic	FreeFull: Right, and Haskell has some effect systems. Oleg's Extensible Effects I believe. Though I'm not sure if they're the same to what you're referencing?
2016-09-20 22:49:41	pyon	montanonic: If you want to argue that a language is “small”, you have to actually give a small formal semantics for it.
2016-09-20 22:49:54	pyon	montanonic: Do you have a formal semantics for Common Lisp?

2016-09-20 22:50:45	montanonic	I guess Common Lisp is the de-facto one, so it's unclear when I say Lisp, but I'm not referring to that. Sorry for confusion.
2016-09-20 22:50:47	tmerr	just refer to lambda calculus itself and make life easy :P that's damn small language
2016-09-20 22:50:50	pyon	montanonic: McCarthy's original Lisp didn't even agree with the lambda calculus on one very basic thing: the handling of lexical environments.
2016-09-20 22:50:51	sbrg	I don't see your point. Yes, they are both turing complete languages and they can definitely solve the same problems. I don't really see how monad transformer stacks matter here, unless you are simply stating that you don't like them as an abstraction
2016-09-20 22:50:53	sbrg	which is fair enough
2016-09-20 22:51:09	pyon	montanonic: Not to mention the lambda calculus has no such thing as variadic functions. In the lambda calculus, all lambda abstractions take a single parameter, and that's the end of the story.

2016-09-20 22:51:52	montanonic	sbrg: just that they are heavyweight, is all, and don't save you from logic errors, which are more problematic once you have a safe language
2016-09-20 22:52:03	montanonic	(safe in the sense that: crashing isn't a security vulnerability)
2016-09-20 22:52:10	montanonic	(or undefined behavior, or whatever)
2016-09-20 22:52:15	FreeFull	Since you're mentioning lambda calculus
2016-09-20 22:52:46	JustinHitla	back in days when there was only C and assembler languages to choose from, no one complained about languages
2016-09-20 22:52:47	montanonic	But they are a awesome abstraction, not contesting that at all
2016-09-20 22:53:01	montanonic	Much more well-conceived than a lot of OOP messes
2016-09-20 22:53:03	sbrg	montanonic: well, obviously. we don't have any way to write code that can guarantee we don't have any semantic errors in our code, save the languages where you can automatically prove that your code is correct
2016-09-20 22:53:05	montanonic	(obviously)
2016-09-20 22:53:07	JustinHitla	so why we didn't stop here ?
2016-09-20 22:53:08	sbrg	and even then, it's not so automatic
2016-09-20 22:53:10	pyon	montanonic: Haskell's type system is actually quite lightweight. If you want to see heavyweight, check out Coq.
2016-09-20 22:53:20	pyon	Now that's a monstrosity.
2016-09-20 22:53:25	FreeFull	JustinHitla: "back in the day" a lot of code was actually written in Pascal ;)
2016-09-20 22:53:32	montanonic	pyon: do you have any references Re the lexical scoping stuff?
2016-09-20 22:53:35	sbrg	but Haskell has its abstractions to solve problems, other languages have theirs. none are perfect, but I think that I prefer Haskell's over many others.
2016-09-20 22:53:40	tmerr	sbrg: as far as performance issues go: you're right most of the time it doesn't matter, what worries me isn't so much that haskell will be slow, but that if i read an algorithm from any textbook, i will have to either implement it in a totally different way in haskell, or use an embedded DSL to make it manageable
2016-09-20 22:53:40	montanonic	pyon: I'd love to learn more about that issue / history

2016-09-20 22:54:21	tmerr	I could be totally off because I don't have much experience in it
2016-09-20 22:54:23	pyon	montanonic: Lisp originally had dynamic scoping.
2016-09-20 22:54:23	FreeFull	It's distinctly different from an ML-style type system
2016-09-20 22:54:30	sbrg	tmerr: true. many algorithms are imperative and assume mutability for the right performance characteristics, and aren't easily translated

2016-09-20 22:55:11	montanonic	sbrg: yes, Haskell offers significant advantages over many of those languages if you are comfortable with thinking in its terms and if the ecosystem suits your problem domain

2016-09-20 23:01:14	merijn	tmerr: The problem with quicksort is that it relies on mutation in place. In fact, that's one of it's only benefits. Something which Haskell is obviously not particularly well suited at
2016-09-20 23:01:15	tmerr	merijn: It's easy in any language with procedures though
2016-09-20 23:01:20	FreeFull	The problem is that the compiler still has to try and figure out what the actual intent behind the code is
2016-09-20 23:01:21	sbrg	tmerr: well, it depends on what your demands are in this regard. I suppose you require that if I want to claim that I implemented some algorithm X in haskell then it must perform as has been proven for that algorithm?

2016-09-20 23:03:44	Coldseeker	(usually, the return is better on scanning what optimisations the compiler is applying, and improving the code accordingly)

2016-09-21 06:34:43	marchelzo	manuel_: JSON.parse just attempts to parse the string you pass it as json. The fact that I'm using JSON.parse doesn't imply that I'm necessarily passing arbitrarily large strings to it.

2016-09-21 06:35:39	marchelzo	manuel_: you seem to be under the impression that json is responsible for the memory usage and the slowness
2016-09-21 06:35:44	Trieste	rindolf: those values are two-dimensional, I should add
2016-09-21 06:35:57	rindolf	Trieste: two dimensional?
2016-09-21 06:35:59	Trieste	but actually that doesn't matter now that I think about it
2016-09-21 06:35:59	TehWan	Trieste: It is linear interpolation. Take b - a, divide that by the number of values you want to interpolate, and that give you the increment. (b-a)/dx
2016-09-21 06:36:19	rindolf	Trieste: well, they can be vectors.
2016-09-21 06:36:21	marchelzo	manuel_: it's the data that requires that. JSON /allows/ you to have large nested expressions, but just because you use JSON in your protocol doesn't mean you need to accept arbitrary JSON.

2016-09-21 06:51:14	erebel55	ackpacket, sorry had a call for a sec. well I'm trying to set the 5th bit in bInputReleased. so I would think it would look like 000010
2016-09-21 06:51:33	Trieste	rindolf: thanks! I think I'm starting to understand the formula, but still, how does it work?

2016-09-21 06:51:45	+ackpacket	erebel55, does 000010 have the fifth bit set?
2016-09-21 06:51:46	eindoofus	manual, i'm a qa in an environment that used to pull in data from a lot of third-party vendors (which is where a lot of bugs came from). however, now we're creating a portal and the source of where we will get out data is in a state of flux
2016-09-21 06:52:01	pyon	So, I just noticed this thing. Haskell modules tend to have very large import lists, compared to most other high-level languages.

2016-09-21 06:54:53	pyon	marchelzo: I mean, Haskell *is* good at code reuse, but the reason why it has long import lists is because its module system sucks. For instance, it would be nice if Control.Monad.{Except, Reader, State...} where all literally inside Control.Monad. If you import Control.Monad, then Reader.ReaderT is a valid type.
2016-09-21 06:55:04	Rounin	Anyway, eindoofus, both times when I've been idle too much I've eventually quit

2016-09-21 06:56:04	manuel_	this one is also not zero copy, because of some other requirements (certain messages have a very hard realtime priority and need to be dealt with in the reception irq)

Part of it is because they are seen as folks who lack creativity because they aren't coming up with original solutions instead of working with others' solutions.
2016-09-21 06:58:55	+ackpacket	eindoofus, So that makes it hard I know =\

2016-09-21 07:00:07	jesuslovesyouthi	Where streams in c++ are concerned ...  What is the differnce between how flags work and other ... (for example cout.precision() which does not look like a flag the way cout.setf(ios::stuff) does). So what is under the hood?

2016-09-21 07:33:39	mathu	he doesn't even have to do it twice! just use the -m32 flag in gcc or clang and ship that as his only binary
2016-09-21 07:34:04	mathu	i can get not wanting to ship two binaries, because then his test suite script that invokes the executable has to determine which one to run

2016-09-21 10:48:49	_zoid	I should do some schoolwork - Evolution algorithm. There is a UI (form in CLI) and the question is, if should i use CLI in all application or just in the form part.

2016-09-21 12:41:35	tmerr	[22:29:50] CuriousMind: i don't want to discourage you, i just think it's good to know it's all subjective. for a long time i thought OOP had some theoretical basis for example, and I tried really hard to understand it, then I realized it just evolved over time [22:29:50]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	tmerr	[22:30:15] Smalltalk's OOP is not C++'s OOP for example, it's inconsistent [22:30:15]

2016-09-21 12:41:35	tmerr	[22:31:11] saijanai_: I mean the term OOP is inconsistently used, Alan Kay wouldn't call C++ OOP but others do [22:31:11]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	CuriousMind	[22:31:14] tmerr: The definition of whatever I wanna know in example ruby could differ in Javascript maybe, etc [22:31:14]

2016-09-21 12:41:35	saijanai_	[22:31:51] well, OOP for alan Kay was message-passing and C++ doesn't do messages at all, IMHO [22:31:51]

2016-09-21 12:41:35	cryptc	[22:32:59] I would agree that C++ isn't very OOP.  C# is gloriously OOP. [22:32:59]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	saijanai_	[22:33:19] C# an Java arent' really OOP either [22:33:19]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	saijanai_	[22:33:25] in the ALan Kay sense [22:33:25]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	cryptc	[22:33:29] Although C# doesn't do multiple inheritance. [22:33:29]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	catbadger	[22:33:30] :) [22:33:30]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	marchelzo	[22:33:31] CuriousMind: right. in ruby, you have the same thing. objects augment procedural languages, typically. [22:33:31]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	marchelzo	[22:34:11] CuriousMind: the compiler or interpreter may have code designed for each of them, or they may be procedures that you wrote yourself [22:34:11]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	saijanai_	[22:34:57] cryptic it is a computer scientist invention that OOP (in the original sense intended in Smalltalk) has anything to do with inheritance [22:34:57]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	cryptc	[22:35:36] I consider all of the factor that go into modern OOP languages [22:35:36]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	saijanai_	[22:36:00] so anything C++does is oop by definition? [22:36:00]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	cryptc	[22:36:06] I think C# become more OOP when it added covariance and contravariance [22:36:06]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	yitz	[22:36:21] saijanai_: no [22:36:21]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	marchelzo	[22:37:14] CuriousMind: as you can see, people can't even agree on what OOP means or which languages are object-oriented. [22:37:14]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	saijanai_	[22:37:26] marchelzo: Mpte O [22:37:26]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	CuriousMind	[22:37:54] marchelzo: Yeah, this is why I shouldn't look into it so much and just understand the surface level instead [22:37:54]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	saijanai_	[22:38:09] marchelzo: note I'm using "according to Alan Kay" in this discussion. I learned Object Java/Turbo Pascal and C++ waaaay back [22:38:09]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	CuriousMind	[22:38:21] marchelzo: Thanks again for your explanation [22:38:21]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	cryptc	[22:38:26] Yes we can.  We just split hairs.  OOP covers many aspects and you can argue what languages utilize the various aspects.  Alan Kay is not the only source of OOP, just one of the first. [22:38:26]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	saijanai_	[22:38:40] and thought those were OOP in a "pure" sense [22:38:40]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	saijanai_	[22:38:59] ALan Kay first used the term "Object Oriented" to describe Smalltalk [22:38:59]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	saijanai_	[22:39:10] He now says he should have used "message passig" [22:39:10]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	pyon	[22:39:51] cryptc: Java and C# are object-oriented, but far from purely so. In an object-oriented language, the only thing objects can do is exchange messages. An object bundles data with operations, and only exposes the latter to the rest of the program. [22:39:51]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	saijanai_	[22:40:00] message passing makes it easy to create inhertiance (single at least), but it isn't the essence of what he was trying to accomplish [22:40:00]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	cryptc	[22:40:23] Purity is overrated, imo. [22:40:23]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	pyon	[22:40:25] And C++ is more oriented towards abstract data types than objects lately. Even if the language's built-in support for actual data abstraction is, um, zero. [22:40:25]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	pyon	[22:40:40] cryptc: Oh, I'm not saying that pure OOP is good. [22:40:40]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	cryptc	[22:40:51] I love OOP [22:40:51]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	cryptc	[22:40:58] It just has limited usages [22:40:58]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	pyon	[22:41:05] cryptc: I'm just saying what pure OOP is. In fact, if you ask me, pure OOP is hardly useful. [22:41:05]
2016-09-21 12:41:35	cryptc	[22:41:24] Isn't Snobol that is pure string manipulation [22:41:24]

2016-09-21 12:42:53	cryptc	Yes
2016-09-21 12:43:16	pyon	The main problem with extension methods is that you can't parameterize a generic class over what extension methods have been added to it.
2016-09-21 12:43:27	pyon	Extension methods are an afterthought and a hack.

2016-09-21 12:48:20	farrioth	saijanai_: It's interesting you mention Forth as a prototyping language. I've always found prototyping in Forth hard because of all the groundwork involved. Perhaps you have a different sense in mind?

2016-09-21 12:49:15	cryptc	I'm not really certain mathematics is civilized.  Lots of mathematicans redefine every boundry and even make up their own languages (usually named "L") and recreate all the rules.
2016-09-21 12:49:16	saijanai_	athere's very little else that could have been used at that time
2016-09-21 12:49:17	pyon	saijanai_: Manipulating syntax is far more convenient. Since syntax can *denote*, it can be used to manipulate abstract concepts just as easily as concrete ones.

2016-09-21 12:49:55	saijanai_	farrioth: if you aren't doing the kinds of things for which the Smalltalk IDE was designed, it certainly could seem limiting

2016-09-21 12:51:08	pyon	saijanai_: OTOH, visuals constrain you to the concrete. In fact, TDD was invented by Smalltalkers precisely because they can't reason about program requirements in a general way, and need to use concrete examples as crutches.

2016-09-21 12:53:22	saijanai_	farrioth: no-one but a GNU Smalltalk user (or a Ruby user , maybe) would consider GNU Smalltalk a "real" smalltalk
2016-09-21 12:53:48	cryptc	I think it's too much to ask every programmer to reorient their thinking to a different system of geometry to use a feature of a language.  But I'm probably over-thinking its usage.
2016-09-21 12:53:48	saijanai_	without the IDE, Smalltalk is a kinda wierd language with no redeeming features

If you're trying to select for people who know how to program well among people who can program at all, I'm not sure if people who can quote chapter and verse from the standard are more productive than others.

2016-09-21 14:51:53	tmerr	they are better at wearing suits.
2016-09-21 14:52:05	Cragus_	marchelzo, Is that important? :p I was just using myself as an example that not all people can legally call themselves software engineers, and that it isn't necessarily loosely defined.
2016-09-21 14:52:14	marchelzo	Cragus_: i'm just curious
2016-09-21 14:53:06	tom_mai78101	I should call myself a software engineering developer.
2016-09-21 14:53:14	tom_mai78101	Should throw off most recruiters.
2016-09-21 14:53:31	marchelzo	Cragus_: what school did you go to
2016-09-21 14:53:39	tmerr	i should call myself a cyberspace architect
2016-09-21 14:54:35	Cragus_	marchelzo, I'm not sure I'm comfortable saying, if it's all the same to you.
