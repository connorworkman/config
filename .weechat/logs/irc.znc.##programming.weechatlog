2016-09-15 21:54:46	DarkCthulhu	Yeah, the expressiveness is nice.
2016-09-15 21:54:59	DarkCthulhu	Hmm.. so, some of the type-checking happens at run-time?
2016-09-15 21:55:12	DarkCthulhu	Oh wait, it's an interpreter thing anyway
2016-09-15 21:55:24	arahael	I imagine it would have to be.  But the interpreter might well be able to make use of some type inferrence.
2016-09-15 21:55:48	DarkCthulhu	Yeah.. but there's a definitely overhead I'm guessing. I wonder how the runtime performance compares.
2016-09-15 21:55:51	arahael	But type inferrence in a dynamic language would be difficult.

2016-09-15 21:56:11	arahael	Well... You don't need to do type inference after bytecode generation.

2016-09-16 14:05:50	rangergord	wrkrcoop: cause it can do the job in 30% less packets, like I said. Means your connection can be 30% slower and you can still talk.
2016-09-16 14:06:12	wrkrcoop	yeah …
2016-09-16 14:06:16	wrkrcoop	thanks :}
2016-09-16 14:06:20	rangergord	they probably implement some basic "occasional ack" mechanism. no one would just use raw UDP anymore.
2016-09-16 14:06:28	MisterSyntax	udp is common for games because in games you generally just want to update player positions, bullets fired, etc (fps games e.g.)

2016-09-16 14:10:41	rangergord	wrkrcoop: you have a DNS cache, yes. 1st time you get a hostname, you do a DNS request, 2nd time, you used the previously cached DNS entry. Every OS would have different expiration times for DNS entries, I think.
