2016-09-15 21:54:46	DarkCthulhu	Yeah, the expressiveness is nice.
2016-09-15 21:54:59	DarkCthulhu	Hmm.. so, some of the type-checking happens at run-time?
2016-09-15 21:55:12	DarkCthulhu	Oh wait, it's an interpreter thing anyway
2016-09-15 21:55:24	arahael	I imagine it would have to be.  But the interpreter might well be able to make use of some type inferrence.
2016-09-15 21:55:48	DarkCthulhu	Yeah.. but there's a definitely overhead I'm guessing. I wonder how the runtime performance compares.
2016-09-15 21:55:51	arahael	But type inferrence in a dynamic language would be difficult.

2016-09-15 21:56:11	arahael	Well... You don't need to do type inference after bytecode generation.

2016-09-16 14:06:16	wrkrcoop	thanks :}
2016-09-16 14:06:20	rangergord	they probably implement some basic "occasional ack" mechanism. no one would just use raw UDP anymore.
2016-09-16 14:06:28	MisterSyntax	udp is common for games because in games you generally just want to update player positions, bullets fired, etc (fps games e.g.)

2016-09-16 14:10:41	rangergord	wrkrcoop: you have a DNS cache, yes. 1st time you get a hostname, you do a DNS request, 2nd time, you used the previously cached DNS entry. Every OS would have different expiration times for DNS entries, I think.

2016-09-16 18:09:23	pyon	ccat: All of this can be done automatically by the runtime system, without you writing a single line of code, and, most importantly, it won't break your program.

2016-09-16 18:43:42	pyon	vendu: Rather than making a single one-size-fits-all malloc(), it would be nice if you wrote several malloc()s, optimized for different use cases.
2016-09-16 18:43:56	pyon	vendu: I bet the code would be a lot simpler.
2016-09-16 18:44:40	+vendu	pyon, how about creating just one and letting people tune it per-application?

2016-09-16 18:49:14	+vendu	pyon, the motto of ptmalloc is/was "one malloc to rule them all"
2016-09-16 18:49:17	dooby	ccat: SPB is not the same, a member can only be in one SPB, and a SPB can have more than one member involved (1..*)

2016-09-16 18:54:05	Kevin	I fear that it's been already compromised by the government.
2016-09-16 18:54:31	Kevin	Anyone out there?

2016-09-16 18:55:40	farrioth	Kevin: Turn it off. If you're paranoid, take the battery out.
2016-09-16 18:55:54	yitz	Did you miss the big FBI case where they couldn't get the info off the iPhone?
2016-09-16 18:56:20	ccat	dooby: but several members can be apart of the SPB
2016-09-16 18:56:23	Kevin	@yitz They did though. They were able to.
2016-09-16 18:56:51	Kevin	The FBI "couldn't" do it, but they hired someone to do it for them.
2016-09-16 18:56:55	dooby	ccat: that's right, and that's why theres a 1..* relationship
2016-09-16 18:56:59	Kevin	And that was the iPhone.
2016-09-16 18:57:04	yitz	With the physical device and older software, sure. Are you planning on shooting up a clinic and leaving a phone behind for them to work on?
2016-09-16 18:57:07	Kevin	iPhone's come encrypted by default.
2016-09-16 18:57:17	Kevin	@yitz Probably ;)
2016-09-16 18:57:34	Kevin	No, I'm just securing the phone in case I ever lose it.
2016-09-16 18:57:36	yitz	Then we shouldn't be helping you encrypt anything
2016-09-16 18:57:49	yitz	Unless you lose it and the FBI really wants in, you're fine
2016-09-16 18:57:59	Kevin	I've already encrypted my SD Card and Phone.
2016-09-16 18:58:03	jack_rabbit	Kevin, nobody's going to spend the time breaking the encryption on your phone when they find it unless they REALLY want something they know is on it.

2016-09-16 18:58:37	yitz	They can just wipe and sell the phone
2016-09-16 18:58:38	Kevin	jack_rabbit, you never know who they are targetting next.

2016-09-16 18:59:39	jack_rabbit	Kevin, If I were you, I'd be more worried about the 3 million lines of kernel code you've never read that's constantly sending god-knows-what out over the network to god-knows-where.
2016-09-16 18:59:58	_W_	Kevin: here's what a state level adversary will do if they find your phone: Take a complete image of the storage on it, clean the device of all data (by physical means if necessary, by replacing the entire phone if necessary) and install software that behaves the same way the image does at startup (asking for password or whatever) then hand it in to lost+found
2016-09-16 19:00:12	dooby	ccat: Round's will be planned...

2016-09-16 20:10:18	ConceptThoughts	yes it is.. after you go thru the data and its stored you go thru the count array.. from 0 to max data.. then go for yy = 1 to datacnt(dataval).. then sorted(cnt)=yy

2016-09-17 14:37:18	jesuslovesyouthi	I'm confused about c++ strings and I'm not even sure the right questions to ask. Als I know is I though a c++ string was == char[] (char array). Haven't I seen string s; s[n]; in the documentations somewhere? Yed, when I attempt to use them with any of the library functions I need them for it blows up my compiler! Even the examples I see (for isdigit() for example) look like c code not c++ and the string declared like
2016-09-17 14:37:20	jesuslovesyouthi	it was c not c++. So what gives? I can't check whether something is a digit or not in a c++ way? I can't convert that/those chars to int in a c++ way? What I mean by c++ way is - using typt string not a char array.
2016-09-17 14:37:34	jesuslovesyouthi	Any insight would be greatly appreciated
2016-09-17 14:37:36	jesuslovesyouthi	thx

2016-09-17 14:45:22	jesuslovesyouthi	but some of the library fucntions don't seem to play nice with strings (or something) - isdigit() and atoi() are examples

2016-09-17 14:47:07	B00gerDaddy1	if isdigit(0 and atoi() is from the c libraries, then they are not c++
2016-09-17 14:47:23	B00gerDaddy1	you can mix the two or use just the c++ libraries
2016-09-17 14:47:46	jesuslovesyouthi	a c type funtion - now I need to learn about that (seems like they just took some c libraries and stuffed em in c++)
2016-09-17 14:48:59	B00gerDaddy1	you really should start with c then go to c++.  it makes c++ easier to understand as it is a descendant of c.

2016-09-17 14:49:02	jesuslovesyouthi	Now I wonder if there are alternative functions in c++ libraries (standard libraries I mean)?? <---- that's the prize (my prize) - to find those alternatives and use them (no offense but screw mixing them)

2016-09-17 15:43:19	ARCADIVS	What their solution allows is for you to program an embedded programming language indirectly with higher-order synxtax in the metalanguage without explicit naming of variables in the object language.
2016-09-17 15:44:17	ARCADIVS	Their "lam" and "app" interface lets you use variable binding in the metalanguage to represent variable binding in the object language.

2016-09-17 15:48:12	ARCADIVS	DarkCthulhu: it's potentially useful to those making a domain specific language that has variable binding and also to those making general purpose programming languages especially when it is bothersome to create a concrete syntax and you'd rather write your programs in a metalanguage (Haskell in this paper).

2016-09-18 02:06:36	ConceptThoughts	rindolf because information is used to do things that you realy arent certain if its what you want to do or not.. because you dont knwo this it isnt knoweldge
2016-09-18 02:06:43	bizarrefish	UX design is needed, but UX is overloaded at the moment, because there's such a huge gap between users and programmers., and there doesn't need to be.

2016-09-18 02:07:37	bizarrefish	We need higher-level primitives that the programmers and the users can both leverage, meaning that the construction of complex software won't just involve building a huge tower of abstraction.

2016-09-18 02:11:48	ConceptThoughts	rindolf ill purposes are always later regreted.. which means they didnt have knowledge of the regret later, that means its only information on how to do what they are doing and not knowledge of the full scope of what they are doing
2016-09-18 02:11:55	bizarrefish	Imagine if the files in your filesystem could be objects exported from a program. Then we wouldn't need to invent new ways for programs to talk to eachother, because it'd just be built into the file abstraction which programs can use already.
2016-09-18 02:12:13	njcomsec	how did we get to the difference between the defnitions of knowledge and information to talking about moral choices lol
2016-09-18 02:12:16	Stefan26	we had to make a GUI with a custom rule set like "always replace leading + with 00" , "reject numbers starting with +44" etc
2016-09-18 02:12:30	bizarrefish	Users need to be educated with good concepts and abstractions, not kept as far away as possible from the shitty ones that programmers are forced to use
2016-09-18 02:12:32	Stefan26	when it could all be done with a single legal_regex

2016-09-18 09:13:48	ezekielnoob	[18:58:50] pretty ugly [18:58:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	+rindolf	[18:58:52] it's huge and inelegant. [18:58:52]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	deniska	[18:59:04] Wilawar: well, you need a function which maps a uniform random number to non-uniform you need [18:59:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	jack_rabbit	[18:59:06] Well it *WAS* designed by committee. [18:59:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	ezekielnoob	[18:59:12] rindolf i understand [18:59:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Wilawar	[18:59:19] … by mapping those numbers stated to be from the closed interval [0;1] to the numbers I’d like to have by bucketing according to their calculated probability. So, if I had three numbers and the probabilities 1/2, 1/3, 1/6, I’d assign 1 to all returns between 0 and 1/2, assign 2 to all between 1/2 and 5/6 and 3 to the rest [18:59:19]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	+rindolf	[18:59:21] jack_rabbit: heh, heh. [18:59:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	ezekielnoob	[18:59:27] i will try scheme also [18:59:27]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	ezekielnoob	[18:59:34] i'l lget a feel on where i want to go from that [18:59:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	ezekielnoob	[19:00:25] rindolf do you have a quick example of what you find ugly? [19:00:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	+rindolf	[19:01:08] ezekielnoob: I forgot the specifics. [19:01:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	deniska	[19:01:12] Wilawar: looks fine so far, what's the problem? :) [19:01:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	ezekielnoob	[19:01:14] alright no problem [19:01:14]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Wilawar	[19:01:25] Now I’m just not sure whether I should use '<=' or '<' for those comparisons, as the first fails for elements with a probability of zero (or very close to it) but the second one for the probability value one. [19:01:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Wilawar	[19:02:25] I’ll also have to admit that my question seems rather trivial in hindsight :D [19:02:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	deniska	[19:03:11] Wilawar: as far as float numbers go, the difference between < and <= is pretty non-important here [19:03:11]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Wilawar	[19:03:52] Which one is more correct dealing with discrete numbers? I don’t need the highest accuracy, it’s for randomly generating playlist queries to Jamendo, but I was still curious which one to use [19:03:52]

2016-09-18 09:13:48	Wilawar	[19:08:00] And there I have to concede again :| [19:08:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Wilawar	[19:08:12] saijanai_: Didn’t hear about that [19:08:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Wilawar	[19:08:38] deniska: ok, must have confused the docs with something else I used, then, maybe. Sorry for that [19:08:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	saijanai_	[19:08:39] Some random greifer walks up claiming to be able to show you something really cool if you type a command into your chat window [19:08:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	saijanai_	[19:08:56] that activates Lua's parsing of all text as commands [19:08:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	saijanai_	[19:09:02] and so... [19:09:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	deniska	[19:09:24] saijanai_: that's not a bigger exploit than asking someone to paste something in a dev console with facebook open [19:09:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Wilawar	[19:09:28] It was never a good idea to blindly execute commands people told you, just about anywhere :P [19:09:28]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	saijanai_	[19:09:53] sure, but most WoW palyers aren't programmers [19:09:53]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	saijanai_	[19:10:20] always assume the end-user hasn't a clue [19:10:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	saijanai_	[19:10:39] Murphy's Law comes from an incident during the testing of the rocket sled back in the late 50's [19:10:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Stefan26	[19:10:43] Hey manuel_ I looked into that 3 glasses problem... I don't think it has a simple closed form [19:10:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	saijanai_	[19:11:02] and Captain Murphy was the systems analyst who designed the thing [19:11:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	saijanai_	[19:11:35] and someone literally hammered the battery in backwards and the sled blew up when it was used (famous film clip -you' ve probably seen it) [19:11:35]
2016-09-18 09:13:48	Stefan26	[19:12:01] but I don't know [19:12:01]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Wilawar	[19:12:30] It should be well-known by now not to do that and it can’t really be fixed at any other level. I mean, it’s been around since 'read-mail real-fast' in what must have been the seventies ;) [19:12:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Stefan26	[19:12:49] but that codefights.com page looked fun [19:12:49]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	saijanai_	[19:12:52] According tot he story, Captain Murphy shouted "My GAWD! If you give them a chance to do it wrong, they'll do it wrong" [19:12:52]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	Stefan26	[19:12:54] how are solutions rated? [19:12:54]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	saijanai_	[19:13:23] The coloney, suit still smoldering, snapped has fingers and said "Murphy's Law: if things can go wrong, they WILL go wrong" [19:13:23]

2016-09-18 09:38:46	Stefan26	Short version: You have two biased coins that you take to a casino. Coin X produces tails with probability p, Coin Y produces tails with probability q. Casino manager allows you to flip either of these coins 100 times in sequence... At the end you get paid 1$ for each tails landed. The only decisions you have to is whether to use coin X or Y for game number k (k=1,...100)
2016-09-18 09:39:12	Stefan26	But you don't know p and q from the start... but you can use the outcome of previous tosses in order to guess p and q

2016-09-18 09:40:50	manuel_	nah it's just a DP knapsack kind of thing
2016-09-18 09:40:53	Stefan26	the naive strategy is to start with coin X... toss that until heads comes up... then switch to Y and toss that until heads comes up... and after that you always pick the coin with the historically best tail-to-heads-ratio

2016-09-18 09:42:05	+ackpacket	Stefan26, if you start with coin x, and toss it 50 times, and heads comes up, then switch to y, toss it twice, and on the 2nd time head come up, you're saying switch back to X?  Which has a 49:1 in favor of tails, vs Y, which is currently 1:1?
2016-09-18 09:42:11	Stefan26	I can paste the problem in its full context next time :) (although source is in swedish comments)
2016-09-18 09:42:18	+ackpacket	Stefan26, Simply switching when you find heads is non optimal

2016-09-18 09:48:33	+ackpacket	For example given a coin that has 49 heads and 1 tails, vs a coin that has only 1 heads, is it *really* a better choice to use the coin that's at 100% heads?
2016-09-18 09:49:18	manuel_	it's a bernoulli distribution, so the p({n draws} | p) = p^(number_tails) (1 - p)^(n - number_tails)
2016-09-18 09:49:32	manuel_	gives you the probability for the out come of tails out of n draws given p

2016-09-18 09:53:58	manuel_	but the more draws you have, the better your estimate is
2016-09-18 09:54:17	+ackpacket	What I'm saying is, for all possible biases
2016-09-18 09:54:47	+ackpacket	There is a probability function p(bias=X | results_so_far)
2016-09-18 09:54:59	+ackpacket	You don't arrive at a bias

2016-09-18 09:55:16	+ackpacket	But, that's still useful
2016-09-18 09:55:31	+ackpacket	Given a coin with a bias, there is value to tossing it again

2016-09-18 09:57:56	manuel_	but if you assume that p is drawn out of a beta distribution, you actually know that p(bias = X | results_so_far) is the PDF of another beta distribution
2016-09-18 09:58:02	cherim	That's precisely "toss the coin with the current best heads-to-tails ratio".

2016-09-18 10:32:11	B3nszy	before even learning to program?
2016-09-18 10:32:19	Wilawar	It seems likely to me that without access to any programming language, it’ll be a lot harder for you to assess the correctness, quality and performance of any algorithms you design.
2016-09-18 10:32:27	Batholith	Just check the math categories out and start learning from the point where you're not good.
2016-09-18 10:32:54	Siegfried	well you want to do theoretical compsci right

2016-09-18 10:36:17	Wilawar	Like, most people who learn about algorithms pay way too much attention to O() categories and try way too little how fast their stuff actually runs. Irregular jumps can give the branch predictor problems and looping can be faster than just about any elaborate search function if there are only few elements to consider

2016-09-18 12:13:52	von-strauss	Okay
2016-09-18 12:13:53	nb-ben	nooblet: basically with vagrant you commit virtual images and so you just basically type "vagrant up" and you have the thing running locally

2016-09-18 12:15:31	Mechaman	von-strauss: However, depending on how your tree is formatted and whether or not it is balanced etc. you will be able to understand the computational complexity better
2016-09-18 12:15:50	nb-ben	nooblet: perhaps you can shove an IDE in a thumbdrive along with git binaries
2016-09-18 12:16:36	nooblet	nb-ben: The computers are the same everywhere, and have the bare minimum for a diversity of subjects, only one of which, that is also very new, is computer science. The computers just have python, IDLE and scratch installed....
2016-09-18 12:16:39	nb-ben	nooblet: so you can clone your repository somewhere on the current host PC, do your work with the IDE, commit it and then delete the local repository

2016-09-18 13:17:36	Henke37	what is bestness? it is the cost of moving to the node (known) and the estimated cost to go from the node to the target (estimate)
2016-09-18 13:21:47	Henke37	A* is designed under the assumption that as long as the estimated cost to the goal is never larger than the actual cost to the goal
2016-09-18 13:21:47	Henke37	this is why A* aborts the search when it finds the first path. because it knows that any other paths are worse

2016-09-18 13:21:48	Mechaman	True. So precomputing all the H(n) for the whole graph adds unnecessary calculations... however, storing the already computed h(n) could serve useful if space isn't a concern for you

2016-09-18 13:24:35	deniska	[22:35:15] which context? [22:35:15]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	soulisson	[22:35:35] deniska, this sentence "data stored in memory" [22:35:35]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	deniska	[22:36:15] "contained" is more rarely used [22:36:15]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	soulisson	[22:37:38] deniska, indeed, but still a valid synonymous, right? [22:37:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	deniska	[22:38:57] probably? I'm not a native speaker so I can't really feel whether it sounds weird or not [22:38:57]

2016-09-18 13:24:35	Mechaman	[23:15:39] this keeps you from having to compute all the nodes the h(n) that may not even be considered in some remote corner of the graph [23:15:39]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Henke37	[23:16:01] A* is optimal. this means that it always finds the best path. not good enough, best. [23:16:01]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Henke37	[23:16:32] it does this by trying each node in the order of decreasing bestness [23:16:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Henke37	[23:17:36] what is bestness? it is the cost of moving to the node (known) and the estimated cost to go from the node to the target (estimate) [23:17:36]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Henke37	[23:18:19] A* is designed under the assumption that as long as the estimated cost to the goal is never larger than the actual cost to the goal [23:18:19]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Henke37	[23:19:09] this is why A* aborts the search when it finds the first path. because it knows that any other paths are worse [23:19:09]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	Mechaman	[23:20:12] True. So precomputing all the H(n) for the whole graph adds unnecessary calculations... however, storing the already computed h(n) could serve useful if space isn't a concern for you [23:20:12]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	max123	[23:24:18] Hey guys, So i have a variable called answers which looks like this: var answers = [['To seek the grail','I don\'t know that','To be in Monty Python'],['African or European?','92', '5']];  How do I push a new array to the same variable? [23:24:18]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	max123	[23:24:28] So a third set of three answers [23:24:28]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	max123	[23:24:32] in javascript [23:24:32]

2016-09-18 15:39:30	manuel_	that's not entirely possible in c++ due to the way c++ works

2016-09-18 15:40:22	manuel_	like, one variable could just be eliminated completely, because it's unused, or because it can be folded together, or stored purely in a register
2016-09-18 15:40:54	manuel_	promach: you can create a binary with something called a symbol table, that tells the debugger "the value of a is at this address in memory" or "the value of A is a this relative index from the top of the current frame"

2016-09-18 15:41:20	manuel_	a debug build is important because often the compiler omits to use a top of frame pointer altogether, which makes it very hard for a debugger to understand what's going on and where things are in memory

2016-09-18 15:42:39	manuel_	-fno-omit-frame-pointer tells the compiler to keep the frame pointer
2016-09-18 15:42:46	manuel_	-g means include DWARF symbols

2016-09-18 16:54:49	Coldseeker	otherwise, we'd have to say that INTERCAL and Piet are legitimate general purpose languages. equal to Java and C.
2016-09-18 16:54:57	bonhoeffer_	is Excel (microsoft) a turing complete language?

2016-09-18 16:55:19	arathald	I would probably personally define something as "domain-specific" if it's an otherwise useful language would be a completely inappropriate choice for very large chunk of programming problems

2016-09-18 16:56:48	_W_	bonhoeffer_: yep
2016-09-18 16:56:49	Menche	probably depends which lisp dialect

2016-09-18 16:57:34	bonhoeffer_	Little languages are small DSLs that do not include many features found in general-purpose programming languages (GPLs) [Bentley 1986, p. 715].

2016-09-18 16:57:36	arathald	considering a domain-specific language could be the exact right choice in a lot of cases, or a general purpose language the wrong choice in a lot of other cases

2016-09-18 16:59:35	bonhoeffer_	they define: Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are languages tailored to a specific application domain. They offer substantial gains in expressiveness and ease of use compared with general-purpose programming languages in their domain of application.

2016-09-18 16:59:59	arathald	SQL, for example, is definitely a DSL, but it's so broadly used that it's not a bad choice for a company to put investment into
2016-09-18 17:00:08	_W_	arathald: narrow in the sense that it's a bad choice to standardize in for arbitrary unknown future tasks
2016-09-18 17:00:15	_W_	because some of those tasks it just can't do very well

2016-09-18 17:00:58	arathald	_W_: I'd say the same thing is true of any language, domain-specific or not, since even general-purpose languages have strengths and weaknesses
2016-09-18 17:01:00	_W_	like, you could probably make a decent web spider in Mirc scripting, but if you needed to make telephony software, Mirc scripting probably will not be suitable

2016-09-18 17:01:36	bonhoeffer_	but, say mips, or x86 32 bit asm is very domain specific to that processor, no?

If I for example read some source code, I usually git blame it if it's not documented enough - that way I can see the commit messages that introduced code with the remarks what the change was supposed to do. Such things go a long way to understand pieces.
2016-09-18 22:23:58	dminuoso	StoBrendo: Such factors weight greatly on how easy it is to grasp some code base.

2016-09-19 06:38:15	jasondockers__	dminuoso, by cooperative multi-tasking do you mean the process decides when to give up control?
2016-09-19 06:38:29	dminuoso	jasondockers__: But most syscalls end up calling the scheduler, cooperating with it that way.

2016-09-19 06:39:44	dminuoso	jasondockers__: So modern kernels are a mixture. They have a watch dog timer running but at a low resolution (think like 100ms)

2016-09-19 06:46:11	dminuoso	jasondockers__: The point is that any syscall makes the expense of flushing your pipeline, hurting cache performance. Now that you made the expensive task of getting into the kernel, you might as well check with the scheduler whether it has something else that deserves some CPU time
2016-09-19 06:46:25	rindolf	Guest47071: are you appending the whole text at once?
2016-09-19 06:46:34	dminuoso	jasondockers__: It's that line of thinking that allows any syscall to effectively cooproate with other multitasks.
2016-09-19 06:46:34	password2	ie , they expand both inward and outward
2016-09-19 06:46:38	dminuoso	But at the schedulers discretion.
2016-09-19 06:46:46	dminuoso	The scheduler might not run something else if it deems so.

2016-09-19 06:47:20	jasondockers__	dminuoso, okay, that makes sense. though I don't exactly know what you mean by flushing the pipeline. I could see how cache locality could be messed up by making a system call, however.

2016-09-19 14:17:07	hpardis	so im a sysadmin learning python right now. im hoping to move into dev work some day, but im getting mixed feelings like i should be learning java to stand a chance getting a job.

2016-09-19 14:21:58	montanonic	Anyways, hpardis, you will get far with Python. It's a good language. I would encourage you to look into a Lisp-like language thought at some point, to get another perspective.

2016-09-19 14:46:39	montanonic	in which case, I'd ask: is C's abstract computer about as close as we want to get?
2016-09-19 14:46:47	montanonic	is it worth making it any more elaborate?
2016-09-19 14:46:58	deniska	Early programming languages were inspired by CPU interface, todays CPU interfaces are inspired by programming languages :)

2016-09-19 14:51:28	marchelzo	deniska: i agree. but the fact that PyPy is faster than CPython doesn't prove anything, since CPython doesn't use JIT.
2016-09-19 14:51:39	montanonic	manuel_: I'm not sure it is a good target, I just imagine it might be, given that the whole goal of Lisp is to having a minimally Turing complete language. This means it has a small surface area, but also, a ton of power and extensibility
2016-09-19 14:51:46	montanonic	I imagine it would just be easier to write compilers for it
2016-09-19 14:52:01	montanonic	and then you could use it to build arbitrarily complicated languages rather easily compared to many other languages
2016-09-19 14:52:03	deniska	Besides Lisp machines there were also Forth machines \o/
2016-09-19 14:52:05	montanonic	given that it is self-extensible
2016-09-19 14:52:30	pyon	deniska: Forth is also interesting, but it doesn't lend itself to building large systems. Which is kind of the point, but still...
2016-09-19 14:52:38	deniska	montanonic: brainfuck is also a minimally turing complete :)
2016-09-19 14:53:00	montanonic	but that's just my pondering; I'm not sure. deniska how easy is it to write a brainfuck interpreter in brainfuck?
2016-09-19 14:53:13	manuel_	why not just write again llvm ir
2016-09-19 14:53:42	deniska	montanonic: https://github.com/canoon/bfbf/blob/master/bf.bf not too hard :P
2016-09-19 14:53:43	pyon	montanonic: Writing a Lisp interpreter in Lisp is only simple if your pre-existing Lisp implementation already has the primitives for implementing a Lisp interpreter. Otherwise, it can get quite hairy.
2016-09-19 14:53:54	montanonic	deniska: lol
2016-09-19 14:54:01	manuel_	a lisp interpreter in c is not the end of the world
2016-09-19 14:54:12	manuel_	you can do a pretty nice one in about a weekend
2016-09-19 14:54:12	adamg	yeah. silicon isn't some self-describing recursive thought process. it's a shit-ton of logic gates. There's a reason why C is widespread and lisp machines are not.
2016-09-19 14:54:34	pyon	manuel_: Yeah, but it won't be a Lisp implementation you'd actually want to use as a systems language.
2016-09-19 14:54:35	manuel_	even th lisp machine had fairly standard computing hardware, with gc tagging support builtin
2016-09-19 14:54:48	deniska	I kinda want to implement a brainfuck CPU in some sort of a logisim
2016-09-19 14:54:53	manuel_	pyon: why not?
2016-09-19 14:54:59	deniska	But I didn't find a logisim which wouldn't be awkward to use
2016-09-19 14:54:59	montanonic	My little experiment is to write a super tiny Lisp, then write some macros that turn into C code, then see if I can enforce some Rust-style memory safety, then rewrite its interpreter in itself.

2016-09-19 14:57:42	montanonic	but if there's already work out there I'd like to see it
2016-09-19 14:58:26	pyon	Another approach that could work is having linear types. That is, every object has to be used exactly once. (Though you may use that object to create two or more clones.)
2016-09-19 14:58:39	pyon	But it's actually not that performant if you do it that naïvely.
2016-09-19 14:58:57	pyon	Might as well use a garbage collector. :-p
2016-09-19 14:59:28	montanonic	oh yeah, that's a cool idea. my naive idea was to just use macros that counted up and tagged the references
2016-09-19 14:59:32	montanonic	and see how far I could get with that
2016-09-19 14:59:48	montanonic	was/is
2016-09-19 14:59:53	pyon	You mean perform the counting at compile time or at runtime?
2016-09-19 15:00:02	pyon	If it's at runtime, reference counting *is* garbage collection.

For example if I'm programming an FTP implementation, how can I continously check for data on the socket say every 500 milliseconds? BufferedReader.readline() seems to hang until there is data to read. I'm using java

2016-09-19 16:59:37	pyon	I can only guess, but perhaps “positional notation” refers to the fact that the “weight” of each digit is determined by its position.
