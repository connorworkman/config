2016-09-09 12:52:47	@Revox	you don't know?
2016-09-09 12:53:00	@Revox	so one group releases somethign and there's something wrong with it
2016-09-09 12:53:10	@Revox	then another group quickly release theirs as a proper
2016-09-09 12:53:29	@Revox	if the group that messed up is quick enough they can release a repack
2016-09-09 12:53:40	@Revox	and sometimes the proper get a repack
2016-09-09 12:53:40	@Revox	hehe
2016-09-09 12:54:26	@Revox	which mean it fixes what the first released did wrong and then also fixes what they did wrong
2016-09-09 12:54:40	@Revox	and then all those other releases get nuked
2016-09-09 12:54:52	@Revox	and at the end of the day it's all about being first
2016-09-09 12:54:56	@Revox	to get the pre
2016-09-09 12:55:05	@Revox	and to get the upload credits
2016-09-09 12:55:30	@Revox	and they usualy don't care much for the content

2016-09-09 13:47:28	@Chreddy	well, actually it wasnt free.. in was in the Tivoli Gardens ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivoli_Gardens ), so you have to pay to get in.. and usually it's more expensive when there's concerts (which is almost every friday during the summer)
2016-09-09 13:47:40	@Revox	I know what that is
2016-09-09 13:47:42	@Revox	I've been
2016-09-09 13:47:44	@Chreddy	however my gf is the lucky owner of a season pass.. so free entrance for both of us.. which also means free concert

2016-09-11 11:30:42	%D2T	yea
2016-09-11 11:30:47	@Revox	However, these batteries will cost more to manufacture and have a worse energy density than lithium-ion batteries.
2016-09-11 11:30:51	@Revox	there we go
2016-09-11 11:31:02	@Revox	that's why

2016-09-11 11:31:33	+amp	lol
2016-09-11 11:31:44	%D2T	yea exploding and temp regulation is all on the battery controller/charge controller
2016-09-11 11:31:55	@Revox	I watched some guy on youtube poke holes at the note 7 battery and it started burning
2016-09-11 11:33:51	+amp	hehe

2016-09-11 11:34:45	@Revox	Having stated that her coughing fit last week was due to her suffering from seasonal allergies, and that this morning's fainting episode was due to 'overheating', Hillary Clinton's doctor has now released a statement concluding that she has pneumonia.
2016-09-11 11:35:25	+amp	not true, shes healthy
2016-09-11 11:35:26	%D2T	makes sense

2016-09-11 11:35:54	@Revox	hehe

2016-09-11 11:36:22	+amp	vomiting green goo
2016-09-11 11:36:26	@Revox	and why did they take her to het daughters?
2016-09-11 11:36:30	+amp	stair trips

2016-09-11 11:38:11	@Revox	well it makes sense to have her daughters house be a place to go if something happened right?
2016-09-11 11:38:17	@Revox	that might have been a procedure
2016-09-11 11:38:24	+amp	perhaps holistic methods
2016-09-11 11:38:30	@Revox	a place they already secured
2016-09-11 11:38:39	+amp	non tradiotnal medial forms to prevent real doctors from looking at her
2016-09-11 11:38:48	@Revox	I like to think about things like that
2016-09-11 11:38:58	@Revox	cause you know they have some procedures for when things happen

2016-09-11 12:12:14	@Chreddy	D2T not saying that the Nexus 6 is better than the iPhone 7.. but you can't deny that Nexus have had some features for quite a while (years that is), before they're available on iPhones.. and that is basically what its about (except for maybe the mp and resolution)
2016-09-11 12:12:16	@Chreddy	hehe

2016-09-11 12:13:07	@Chreddy	dunno why, but i thought they stopped making the compact phones?
2016-09-11 12:13:14	@Chreddy	or was it smth else they stopped making?
2016-09-11 12:13:19	+amp	i think they extended the update timeframe
2016-09-11 12:13:30	+amp	not sure
2016-09-11 12:13:45	@Chreddy	oh wait, that was the Z series
2016-09-11 12:13:49	@Chreddy	not the compact phones
2016-09-11 12:13:57	+amp	right
2016-09-11 12:14:45	%D2T	Chreddy yea but generally each apple and google have features on their phones that eventually make it to each other
2016-09-11 12:14:54	%D2T	its not one way
2016-09-11 12:15:06	@Chreddy	true

2016-09-11 12:15:40	@Chreddy	why's that a problem?
2016-09-11 12:16:14	%D2T	it will probably have random quality issues and they will drop support, price too high for whats in it
2016-09-11 12:16:16	%D2T	etc
2016-09-11 12:16:24	%D2T	other than ps4 sony is basically shit anymore
2016-09-11 12:16:34	@Chreddy	Sony is one of the few brands i actually could be buying.. Samsung turned to shit, HTC is just being weird over and over again.. LG is not for me at all
2016-09-11 12:16:48	%D2T	yup

2016-09-13 06:10:48	@Chreddy	i thought he'd release it on FSOE
2016-09-13 06:10:59	+ItsDJ	sounds more like a FSOE tune hehe
2016-09-13 06:11:09	@Chreddy	hehe.. imo it fits in very well on both labels

2016-09-13 06:11:28	@Chreddy	but knowing that Akesson is one of the guys behind the FSOE Excelsior label, he could easily have had it released on the main FSOE label as well :P

2016-09-13 06:42:59	@Revox	virgin or jetblue
2016-09-13 06:43:24	@Revox	well we had some issue getting back home too the last trip
2016-09-13 06:43:26	%D2T	delta had us on a connecting flight and they delayed both of them new crew even at the gates  lots of confused people
2016-09-13 06:43:27	@Revox	but we got snowed in
2016-09-13 06:43:34	+Tu13es	10h isn't too bad
2016-09-13 06:43:50	@Revox	Tu13es: don't forget the jetlag
2016-09-13 06:43:51	%D2T	they wound up having to put us on an american flight at a different terminal and rescheduling our flight from that connection to ams
2016-09-13 06:44:01	@Revox	D2T: yea that's terrible
2016-09-13 06:44:04	%D2T	and of course that means baggage was lost
2016-09-13 06:44:08	+Tu13es	so far i've handled jet lag pretty well
2016-09-13 06:44:14	%D2T	gotta visit the lovely amsterdam H&M
2016-09-13 06:44:17	+Tu13es	the trick is to set your watch/whatever to the destination time as soon as you leave
2016-09-13 06:44:18	@Revox	I mean doesn't matter which airline things like that would happen
2016-09-13 06:44:36	@Revox	Tu13es: you are young?
2016-09-13 06:44:42	@Revox	so imagen this
2016-09-13 06:44:49	@Revox	SFO is 9 hours behind AMS
2016-09-13 06:45:04	+Tu13es	i'm 30
2016-09-13 06:45:08	@Revox	so you wake up and take a flight at lets say 2pm 10 hours
2016-09-13 06:45:19	@Revox	say you wake up at 9
2016-09-13 06:45:32	@Revox	that's 15 hours when you land in AMS at 10am
2016-09-13 06:45:44	@Revox	then you need to stay awake for 10-12 hours more
2016-09-13 06:45:49	+Tu13es	in that case I'd wake myself up at 5am or something so i could sleep on the plane
2016-09-13 06:45:56	@Revox	AHA!
2016-09-13 06:45:59	@Revox	there's the thing

2016-09-13 06:46:43	@Revox	4000-1200=2800 euro is worth it to me to be able to lay down and sleep
2016-09-13 06:46:49	@Revox	(hopefully)

2016-09-13 08:27:27	%D2T	i thoguht they were all terrible after the first one or two
2016-09-13 08:27:32	%D2T	Ahiru except thats not true
2016-09-13 08:27:43	@Chreddy	D2T i really enjoy all the games with Ezio
2016-09-13 08:27:46	+Ahiru	they said the same with lead on ink
2016-09-13 08:27:50	@Chreddy	those games was always the best AC games imo
2016-09-13 08:27:56	@Chreddy	with AC2 standing out as the best one
2016-09-13 08:28:02	@Chreddy	never really played AC1 on the other hand
2016-09-13 08:28:06	%D2T	Ahiru non ionizing radiation wont cause cancer from a one watt transciever
2016-09-13 08:28:14	+Ahiru	oki
2016-09-13 08:28:23	%D2T	or we would all be dead
2016-09-13 08:28:35	+Ahiru	with those radio stations and towers
2016-09-13 08:28:40	%D2T	since 90% of the population lives within a range of a 50,000 watt radio or tv transmitter
2016-09-13 08:28:47	+Ahiru	ya
2016-09-13 08:28:48	+Sub-Zero	stand in front of a multi kilowatt microwave dish and see what happens
2016-09-13 08:29:06	+Sub-Zero	D2T: radio is VHF not microwave
2016-09-13 08:29:10	%D2T	Sub-Zero you would probably get really warm and then die
2016-09-13 08:30:04	%D2T	solar radiation is ionizing and far stronger
2016-09-13 08:30:08	%D2T	go stand outside for 10 minutes
2016-09-13 08:30:11	+Sub-Zero	yeah
2016-09-13 08:30:19	%D2T	youll get your cell phone dose for 10 years 
2016-09-13 08:30:30	+Sub-Zero	I still think holding microwave emitters close to your head is stupid.
2016-09-13 08:30:45	+Sub-Zero	just because it's non ionizing doesn't mean it's harmless
2016-09-13 08:30:52	%D2T	Sub-Zero even if its low enough power it doesnt do anything
2016-09-13 08:31:21	+Sub-Zero	it makes you gay and susceptible to reptilian influence

2016-09-14 12:48:57	+amp	not sure what else it accounts for "auto"

2016-09-14 13:02:55	Straeffs	cyclists are fine if the follow the rules of the road, but they don't. and the police don't enforce them
2016-09-14 13:03:16	%KrissO	we started with more bike lanes cause of the idiot politician parties that make NO sense at all because we are not built for bike traffic
2016-09-14 13:03:21	+amp	they are kings of the road, move aside

2016-09-14 13:04:05	Straeffs	i mean it does seem ridiculous to pull over a cyclist, but I feel like it's necessary with them going wherever they please and not signaling properly

2016-09-14 13:26:15	+USAJerry	10 days vacay..4 floaters....6 national holidays..so i get 20 days
2016-09-14 13:26:26	%KrissO	what is a floater
2016-09-14 13:26:30	+USAJerry	next year starting in september..i get 15 days vacay plus the other stuff
2016-09-14 13:26:45	+USAJerry	floater is essentially an extra vacation day you get every 3 months
2016-09-14 13:26:53	+USAJerry	you can only keep a max of 4
2016-09-14 13:26:56	+USAJerry	so for example..i have 2
2016-09-14 13:27:03	+USAJerry	i get another in november which will be 3
2016-09-14 13:27:07	+USAJerry	and i won't use that one yet

2016-09-14 13:27:49	+USAJerry	another reason why i like to keep a lot of vacay on the books is that if i were to leave the company, they pay me out on the vacay time

2016-09-14 13:31:48	%KrissO	listening over
2016-09-14 13:32:58	%KrissO	long story short club in Drammen (that used to host TranceNight) banned the event. a lot of people/promoters got upset. then it turns out Orjan is playing in November at the same club
2016-09-14 13:33:04	%KrissO	so big conflict of interest
2016-09-14 13:33:24	+USAJerry	banned what event..the party that you guys were supposed to have?
2016-09-14 13:35:47	%KrissO	there's been regular events every year (a bit on and off). at most we had 4 parties a year, nothing the last year, so it's been going down after the EDM guy at the club quit (who really liked the TranceNight concept). so the remaining guys resposible for bookings don't want trance
2016-09-14 13:35:47		[13:35]
2016-09-14 13:35:57	%KrissO	but orjan was booked
