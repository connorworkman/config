2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[22:59:16] typically [22:59:16]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	alad	[22:59:22] if you own a car [22:59:22]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	alad	[22:59:27] otherwise it's a night in a train [22:59:27]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	alad	[22:59:39] well I guess that's less than 10h [22:59:39]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[22:59:55] trains usually have a higher average than 60 [22:59:55]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:00:03] unless you are in norway :p [23:00:03]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	alad	[23:00:39] heh [23:00:39]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:01:00] fun thing: the train between bergen and oslo uses longer time now than 50 years ago, even though the line is quite a bit shorter now.... [23:01:00]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	alad	[23:01:46] -_- [23:01:46]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	alad	[23:02:06] do you also get these huge delays in public transportation in norway ? [23:02:06]

2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:03:01] alad: silly "economists" being in charge runining everything related to maintenance and upgrades for the past 30 years [23:03:01]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	alad	[23:03:08] wonderful [23:03:08]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	ng0	[23:03:36] > it's not like [23:03:36]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:04:06] also the line near me tend to be rather low prioritised even though it has the most trafficed piece of rail in all of europe [23:04:06]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:04:32] when they complained about the bad quality of the old train sets around oslo (the capital) they instantly got new ones [23:04:32]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:04:38] and all the old sets were sent over here..... [23:04:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	ng0	[23:04:46] actually: 237 km [23:04:46]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:04:56] because who cares about us, we are only the ones who actually makes money for the whole country [23:04:56]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	ng0	[23:05:00] just checked the distance [23:05:00]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:07:06] single most trafficed piece of rail in europe, basiclly havent gotten any maintenance at all since 1970 [23:07:06]

2016-10-19 09:56:39	Soni	let's see how it handles no JS?

2016-10-19 09:58:48	Soni	ng0, you did say "*we* are now replaced by tea" linking to something that replaces the T with "tea"?
2016-10-19 09:59:14	Soni	unless I missed something...
2016-10-19 10:00:04	ng0	oh... humor. sorry x.x but recently I came to terms that non-binary is more appropriate to describe me if i have to
2016-10-19 10:00:14	ng0	maybe
2016-10-19 10:00:35	Soni	oh good that website doesn't work at all with JS off
2016-10-19 10:03:00	@fsckd	i don't get what these people have to do with LGBT. looks more like a pretentious marketing thing to get folks to buy their wares.
2016-10-19 10:03:42	ng0	yeah.. some colorful tea bags, that's all
2016-10-19 10:05:05	alad	fsckd: the fact that their website takes longer to load than an AAA game is telling enough
2016-10-19 10:05:21	@fsckd	haha

2016-10-19 10:06:34	alad	yeh, the most bloated browser is the most apt at handling bloat
2016-10-19 10:06:38	Soni	ng0, I thought I had completely lost my ability to detect trans ppl due to not using it, but apparently it still works
2016-10-19 10:07:19	Soni	(altho I didn't say anything before because I was waiting for you to confirm it and it's not a good idea to just go outing ppl just because you think they're trans)
2016-10-19 10:08:03	Soni	and no, idk how to phrase that better .-.
2016-10-19 10:09:15	ng0	"to detect" is, yeah it's not so good. it's like "oh, i have a radar for people who are gay". i understand what you tried to say though :)

2016-10-19 10:14:27	Soni	idk if it's because I'm autistic or because I'm good with regex (or alternatively, if me being good with regex has anything to do with me being autistic), but if I learn the right patterns I can detect anyone/anything
2016-10-19 10:15:01	Soni	maybe even tell if 2 nicks are the same person, altho I never tried that
2016-10-19 10:15:22	alad	Soni: wat

2016-10-19 10:15:38	alad	k
2016-10-19 10:16:05	Soni	I can infodump about regex if you want :P
2016-10-19 10:16:28	alad	feel free, I tried reading a PCRE man page once and it cost me two of my 9 lives
2016-10-19 10:17:25	Soni	uh PCRE can parse HTML
2016-10-19 10:18:34	halosghost	not arbitrary html
2016-10-19 10:19:13	Soni	ok
2016-10-19 10:19:21	Soni	PCRE can parse XML (and XHTML)
2016-10-19 10:19:39	Soni	it's like the only regex flavor that can do that...
2016-10-19 10:19:50	halosghost	1) it's still horrifically slow
2016-10-19 10:20:01	halosghost	2) why would you want to parse XML/XHTML with regex anyway?
2016-10-19 10:20:04	Soni	altho it'll choke if you have too many nested tags (recursion limit) or if the document is too long

2016-10-19 10:21:47	Soni	so yes, I don't expect anyone to be able to read PCRE man pages
2016-10-19 10:22:06	Soni	I'd say reading the source code might be easier?
2016-10-19 10:22:13	halosghost	I sincerely doubt that
2016-10-19 10:22:19	Soni	altho I learned PCRE by probing
2016-10-19 10:25:09	ng0	thompson nfa?
2016-10-19 10:25:26	Soni	[] are sets which are just a different form of | alternations limited to single characters with no special characters like ^ or $ or . but with support for character ranges and stuff and () make a group which stores the data inside it (this is how you use regex to parse and/or tokenize things) and ^ and $ can be used in groups and alternations which creates interesting things and there's a non-matching group syntax which I forgot and this is

2016-10-19 10:26:41	ng0	ah.. thanks
2016-10-19 10:26:58	halosghost	ng0: yw
2016-10-19 10:27:17	Soni	all you need to know is [] [^] () ^ $ | . (in order of importance) and everything else comes naturally
2016-10-19 10:29:18	Soni	... oh right I forgot ? + *
2016-10-19 10:29:23	spider-mario	I wouldn’t say “naturally”
2016-10-19 10:30:18	Soni	(altho ? and + are sort-of sugar for | and *, respectively)
2016-10-19 10:30:32	halosghost	no they're not

2016-10-19 10:30:36	spider-mario	or {,}, one could argue
2016-10-19 10:30:46	Soni	they are if you support empty alternations
2016-10-19 10:31:11	Soni	p? = (?:p|) or something
2016-10-19 10:31:21	Soni	p+ = pp* or something
2016-10-19 10:31:34	halosghost	mk
2016-10-19 10:31:39	spider-mario	but that requires repeating p
2016-10-19 10:31:53	spider-mario	instead, you can define both ?, * and + in terms of {}
2016-10-19 10:31:55	Soni	keyword "sugar"
2016-10-19 10:32:03	@fsckd	regex is very useful to know
2016-10-19 10:32:08	Soni	{} is bleh
2016-10-19 10:32:09	spider-mario	sure, but still
2016-10-19 10:32:16	halosghost	Soni: (?:p|) isn't sugar; it's lookahead
2016-10-19 10:32:24	halosghost	which is not part of regex; it's a pcre extension
2016-10-19 10:32:25	Soni	halosghost, (?=p|) ?
2016-10-19 10:32:34	spider-mario	?: is unnamed group
2016-10-19 10:32:38	spider-mario	I mean non-capturing group
2016-10-19 10:32:39	Soni	eh
2016-10-19 10:32:40	spider-mario	sorry
2016-10-19 10:32:44	Soni	w/e the non-capturing group thing is
2016-10-19 10:32:59	halosghost	my apologies, not lookahead; still an extension
2016-10-19 10:33:15	alad	#archlinux-@#$%+?
2016-10-19 10:33:23	Soni	ik it's an extension but that's only because everyone else puts () as capture groups instead of a syntactical group (i.e. a precedence syntax)

2016-10-19 10:34:16	Soni	if your regex flavor doesn't have non-capturing precedence grouping, well it sucks
2016-10-19 10:34:26	halosghost	phrik: bail
2016-10-19 10:34:27	phrik	Looks like halosghost is bailing out on this one - good luck!
2016-10-19 10:34:52	Soni	in math, x(x+3) isn't a capture on x+3, it just means you should evaluate x+3 first
2016-10-19 10:35:10	alad	I have no idea what you guys are talking about
2016-10-19 10:35:47	Soni	I mean
2016-10-19 10:35:48	spider-mario	regexps
2016-10-19 10:35:49	Soni	technically speaking
2016-10-19 10:35:53	spider-mario	or an approximation of them
2016-10-19 10:35:54	Soni	captures *are* an extension
2016-10-19 10:36:15	Soni	an extension which just so happens to be supported just about everywhere

2016-10-19 10:36:34	spider-mario	I have started to use sigils when taking notes in german class
2016-10-19 10:36:35	Soni	but the mathematical definition of regex doesn't include captures
2016-10-19 10:36:47	spider-mario	$ = nominative, @ = accusative, % = dative
2016-10-19 10:36:51	alad	regex has a mathematical definition?
2016-10-19 10:36:56	spider-mario	yes

2016-10-19 10:37:31	@fsckd	alad: regular expressions match on regular grammars
