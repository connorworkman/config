2016-10-19 00:41:23	alad	[22:59:27] otherwise it's a night in a train [22:59:27]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	alad	[22:59:39] well I guess that's less than 10h [22:59:39]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[22:59:55] trains usually have a higher average than 60 [22:59:55]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:00:03] unless you are in norway :p [23:00:03]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	alad	[23:00:39] heh [23:00:39]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:01:00] fun thing: the train between bergen and oslo uses longer time now than 50 years ago, even though the line is quite a bit shorter now.... [23:01:00]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	alad	[23:01:46] -_- [23:01:46]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	alad	[23:02:06] do you also get these huge delays in public transportation in norway ? [23:02:06]

2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:03:01] alad: silly "economists" being in charge runining everything related to maintenance and upgrades for the past 30 years [23:03:01]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	alad	[23:03:08] wonderful [23:03:08]

2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:04:06] also the line near me tend to be rather low prioritised even though it has the most trafficed piece of rail in all of europe [23:04:06]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:04:32] when they complained about the bad quality of the old train sets around oslo (the capital) they instantly got new ones [23:04:32]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:04:38] and all the old sets were sent over here..... [23:04:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	ng0	[23:04:46] actually: 237 km [23:04:46]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:04:56] because who cares about us, we are only the ones who actually makes money for the whole country [23:04:56]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	ng0	[23:05:00] just checked the distance [23:05:00]

2016-10-19 09:56:39	Soni	let's see how it handles no JS?

2016-10-19 09:58:48	Soni	ng0, you did say "*we* are now replaced by tea" linking to something that replaces the T with "tea"?
2016-10-19 09:59:14	Soni	unless I missed something...
2016-10-19 10:00:04	ng0	oh... humor. sorry x.x but recently I came to terms that non-binary is more appropriate to describe me if i have to
2016-10-19 10:00:14	ng0	maybe
2016-10-19 10:00:35	Soni	oh good that website doesn't work at all with JS off
2016-10-19 10:03:00	@fsckd	i don't get what these people have to do with LGBT. looks more like a pretentious marketing thing to get folks to buy their wares.
2016-10-19 10:03:42	ng0	yeah.. some colorful tea bags, that's all
2016-10-19 10:05:05	alad	fsckd: the fact that their website takes longer to load than an AAA game is telling enough
2016-10-19 10:05:21	@fsckd	haha

2016-10-19 10:06:34	alad	yeh, the most bloated browser is the most apt at handling bloat
2016-10-19 10:06:38	Soni	ng0, I thought I had completely lost my ability to detect trans ppl due to not using it, but apparently it still works
2016-10-19 10:07:19	Soni	(altho I didn't say anything before because I was waiting for you to confirm it and it's not a good idea to just go outing ppl just because you think they're trans)
2016-10-19 10:08:03	Soni	and no, idk how to phrase that better .-.
2016-10-19 10:09:15	ng0	"to detect" is, yeah it's not so good. it's like "oh, i have a radar for people who are gay". i understand what you tried to say though :)

2016-10-19 10:14:27	Soni	idk if it's because I'm autistic or because I'm good with regex (or alternatively, if me being good with regex has anything to do with me being autistic), but if I learn the right patterns I can detect anyone/anything
2016-10-19 10:15:01	Soni	maybe even tell if 2 nicks are the same person, altho I never tried that
2016-10-19 10:15:22	alad	Soni: wat

2016-10-19 10:16:05	Soni	I can infodump about regex if you want :P
2016-10-19 10:16:28	alad	feel free, I tried reading a PCRE man page once and it cost me two of my 9 lives
2016-10-19 10:17:25	Soni	uh PCRE can parse HTML
2016-10-19 10:18:34	halosghost	not arbitrary html
2016-10-19 10:19:13	Soni	ok
2016-10-19 10:19:21	Soni	PCRE can parse XML (and XHTML)
2016-10-19 10:19:39	Soni	it's like the only regex flavor that can do that...
2016-10-19 10:19:50	halosghost	1) it's still horrifically slow
2016-10-19 10:20:01	halosghost	2) why would you want to parse XML/XHTML with regex anyway?
2016-10-19 10:20:04	Soni	altho it'll choke if you have too many nested tags (recursion limit) or if the document is too long

2016-10-19 10:21:47	Soni	so yes, I don't expect anyone to be able to read PCRE man pages
2016-10-19 10:22:06	Soni	I'd say reading the source code might be easier?
2016-10-19 10:22:13	halosghost	I sincerely doubt that
2016-10-19 10:22:19	Soni	altho I learned PCRE by probing
2016-10-19 10:25:09	ng0	thompson nfa?
2016-10-19 10:25:26	Soni	[] are sets which are just a different form of | alternations limited to single characters with no special characters like ^ or $ or . but with support for character ranges and stuff and () make a group which stores the data inside it (this is how you use regex to parse and/or tokenize things) and ^ and $ can be used in groups and alternations which creates interesting things and there's a non-matching group syntax which I forgot and this is

2016-10-19 10:26:58	halosghost	ng0: yw
2016-10-19 10:27:17	Soni	all you need to know is [] [^] () ^ $ | . (in order of importance) and everything else comes naturally
2016-10-19 10:29:18	Soni	... oh right I forgot ? + *
2016-10-19 10:29:23	spider-mario	I wouldn’t say “naturally”
2016-10-19 10:30:18	Soni	(altho ? and + are sort-of sugar for | and *, respectively)
2016-10-19 10:30:32	halosghost	no they're not

2016-10-19 10:30:36	spider-mario	or {,}, one could argue
2016-10-19 10:30:46	Soni	they are if you support empty alternations
2016-10-19 10:31:11	Soni	p? = (?:p|) or something
2016-10-19 10:31:21	Soni	p+ = pp* or something
2016-10-19 10:31:34	halosghost	mk
2016-10-19 10:31:39	spider-mario	but that requires repeating p
2016-10-19 10:31:53	spider-mario	instead, you can define both ?, * and + in terms of {}
2016-10-19 10:31:55	Soni	keyword "sugar"
2016-10-19 10:32:03	@fsckd	regex is very useful to know
2016-10-19 10:32:08	Soni	{} is bleh
2016-10-19 10:32:09	spider-mario	sure, but still
2016-10-19 10:32:16	halosghost	Soni: (?:p|) isn't sugar; it's lookahead
2016-10-19 10:32:24	halosghost	which is not part of regex; it's a pcre extension
2016-10-19 10:32:25	Soni	halosghost, (?=p|) ?
2016-10-19 10:32:34	spider-mario	?: is unnamed group
2016-10-19 10:32:38	spider-mario	I mean non-capturing group
2016-10-19 10:32:39	Soni	eh
2016-10-19 10:32:40	spider-mario	sorry
2016-10-19 10:32:44	Soni	w/e the non-capturing group thing is
2016-10-19 10:32:59	halosghost	my apologies, not lookahead; still an extension
2016-10-19 10:33:15	alad	#archlinux-@#$%+?
2016-10-19 10:33:23	Soni	ik it's an extension but that's only because everyone else puts () as capture groups instead of a syntactical group (i.e. a precedence syntax)

2016-10-19 10:34:52	Soni	in math, x(x+3) isn't a capture on x+3, it just means you should evaluate x+3 first

2016-10-20 09:25:17	ng0	what where got i disconnected? I got cut off at some point
2016-10-20 09:26:00	fsckd	last thing you said was "before I ask for creating a new VM there, I wonder if it's possible with external services"
2016-10-20 09:26:09	ng0	ah.. ok
2016-10-20 09:26:47	ng0	sorry, I meant jflory7 then.
2016-10-20 09:27:21	 *	jflory7 looks up
2016-10-20 09:28:03	jflory7	Yes, Pagure was a homegrown project within Fedora, but it's now evolving to be a project beyond just Fedora.
2016-10-20 09:28:13	jflory7	It's a fairly capable git forge nowadays and is under consistent development.
2016-10-20 09:28:29	jflory7	But... I am a little biased. :) It's at least worth checking out on your own time too.
2016-10-20 09:29:05	ng0	I've looked at its own repo and see no tests.. gm
2016-10-20 09:29:07	ng0	*hm
2016-10-20 09:29:21	ng0	but this whole CI thing is new to me

2016-10-20 09:51:33	jflory7	ng0: Hmmm. I know the existing Pagure has integrated CI... I can't remember how it's visually shown or where to find it, though. I could probably brush up a bit. :P
2016-10-20 09:52:39	ng0	what the ebuild stuff ends up with is running repoman, which creates output like this which is useful: https://travis-ci.org/gentoo/musl

2016-10-20 09:53:28	@meskarune	jflory7: I told the arch devs to check it out since they are looking for a new issue issue tracker :)
2016-10-20 09:53:53	@meskarune	the don't really want to go with trac/redmine
2016-10-20 09:54:01	ng0	i know cuirass might have this feature in the future, but if we could have a mirror of our gnunet.org repo of the overlay on pagure which runs tests, that would be nice
2016-10-20 09:54:12	ng0	cuirass is just not there yet :)
2016-10-20 09:54:57	ng0	meskarune: is it better than those and also supports email interaction? that's the annoying feature some developers at guix need
2016-10-20 09:56:12	@meskarune	pagure is still being developed, but I think if another distro started using it and make patches/feature requests they would happen
2016-10-20 09:56:39	@meskarune	ng0: I don't personally like redmine or trac, but "better" is very subjective.
2016-10-20 09:56:59	jflory7	meskarune: I am almost positive that if ant of the Arch Infrastructure team had questions or wanted advice on implementing it, the developers and Fedora community would be more than happy to oblige
2016-10-20 09:57:17	jflory7	meskarune: Feel free to refer #fedora-apps + #pagure if you pass it along, people there would be best equipped to advise.
2016-10-20 09:57:31	jflory7	ng0: Define email interaction?
2016-10-20 09:57:46	@meskarune	jflory7: there is also the added advantage that arch already uses python/flask for their sites
2016-10-20 09:58:03	@meskarune	so like, adding one more python site means they already know how to admin that stuff
2016-10-20 09:58:04	jflory7	It's worth noting that Pagure is partially influenced by the wish to move away from Trac. A lot of core functionality that we used in Trac has been replicated or implemented in an alternative in Pagure
2016-10-20 09:58:07	ng0	yeah i know.. there's a strong opinion against bugzilla at our side (horrible maintenance) and I think ludovic said they tried many alternatives for bugtracking etc over the last years. Well, a must-have feature for some people is open/close/reply/etc to bugs without logging in to a webinterface
2016-10-20 09:58:18	 *	jflory7 nods to meskarune 
2016-10-20 09:58:40	 *	jflory7 also nods to ng0 
2016-10-20 09:59:01	ng0	then we ended with almost going to gitlab-ce but then there was a news about how the linux devs use email for everything and 'wooo praise email' ... and I just look at my sad 1000 emails / month
2016-10-20 09:59:13	ng0	I only feel better when I ignore most emails
2016-10-20 09:59:18	@meskarune	I hate using email lol
2016-10-20 09:59:54	@meskarune	I don't like how the messages are organized, I don't like trying to keep track of long email conversations and digging up past messages, its just a hassel
2016-10-20 10:00:10	ng0	there's 42 contributors now and just 3 regular reviewers, but I really have strong doubts that this will fix itself when we have more contributors in guix
2016-10-20 10:00:19	ng0	i find email terrible to deal with
2016-10-20 10:00:27	ng0	same
2016-10-20 10:00:58	spider-mario	at least gmail, inbox and kmail can keep message threads together
2016-10-20 10:01:34	ng0	i use notmuch.. this only happened because moving from gentoo to guixsd made franken-mutt disappear for now
2016-10-20 10:03:35	ng0	oh there's a page in docs.. installing pagure-ci
2016-10-20 10:04:30	@meskarune	are you wanting somsething like pagure that can add issues with email?
2016-10-20 10:05:15	ng0	as far as I understand the 6+ months discussions now, yes
2016-10-20 10:05:35	ng0	and for bugs, like debuggs..
2016-10-20 10:08:00	@meskarune	I think there is an email based issue tracker actually
2016-10-20 10:08:00		[10:08]
2016-10-20 10:08:03	ng0	i personally don't care about email, but right now what we have is one interface only.. with mailman3 this wouldn't be an issue (to some degree) but gnu.org doesn't deploy that either
2016-10-20 10:08:09	ng0	so everything is sad
2016-10-20 10:08:46	e^x	i think Debian's issue tracker interfaces with email
2016-10-20 10:09:00	ng0	bugs: debbugs. communication: irc. help/patches: 2 separate email lists
2016-10-20 10:09:09	ng0	that's how it works right now at our side
2016-10-20 10:09:27	ng0	als discussion+patches are one list
2016-10-20 10:09:49	ng0	i get less emails with gentoo due to bugzilla.
2016-10-20 10:10:04	ng0	guix must be ~700 emails/month at least
2016-10-20 10:10:56	ng0	even when filtered it is sensory overload because of information to process just by looking at subjects
2016-10-20 10:13:42	ng0	oh, you just need to use application X and Z or filter better... yeah that's not how you make it more accessible :/

2016-10-22 07:32:22	ng0	when I last used vim I did not need it

2016-10-22 07:35:13	alad	if the modelines are the same for every file, you could use sed to append it to each one

2016-10-22 19:38:16	@meskarune	thanks Riotela
2016-10-22 19:39:07	@meskarune	yeah, homophobic or transphobic sort implies the other person is being fearful rather than actually harmful and attacking
2016-10-22 19:40:17	@meskarune	doctors have started using photosensitivity rather than photophobia too since it means light is painful to the eyes, not that people are fearful of it
2016-10-22 19:41:00	Riotela	does it have connection to oversensitive sense of seeing?
2016-10-22 19:42:05	 *	Riotela is at father for recovering and his bathroom has horribly bright led that is close to hurting and even his living room lightning was hurting when she arrived after being stressed etc.

2016-10-22 19:54:07	@meskarune	Riotela: bright lights make my eyes hurt and being in the sun or under flourescents everything looks white, like looking into the sun, so I'm basically blind
2016-10-22 19:54:24	Riotela	:(
2016-10-22 19:54:33	Riotela	so it's different
2016-10-22 19:54:42	@meskarune	In my bedroom I have only LED lights that I can set to a reddish or orange tone
2016-10-22 19:54:54	@meskarune	since that is fine, but very bright light hurts my eyes
2016-10-22 19:55:01	@meskarune	even a bright computer screen
2016-10-22 19:55:49	@meskarune	when I get a bad migraine I can't even stand dim LEDs and end up unplugging everything in the room
2016-10-22 19:56:01	@meskarune	becuase of the light and sound the electronics make
2016-10-22 19:59:33	Riotela	Riot would probably fail you badly

2016-10-22 20:03:42	+elky	my parents in law bought a house about 18 months ago. their downstairs bathroom has 3 small suns instead of light globes and they still haven't bothered to replace them. they kill my eyes every time.
2016-10-22 20:04:00	Riotela	it's horribly white and bright especially on mobile where you cannot install dark theme with Stylish. They are aware of the problem, but e2ee is their biggest priority
2016-10-22 20:05:12	+elky	you can't use something like twilight?
2016-10-22 20:06:15	+elky	my phone is basically unusable for me without that. sjogren's syndrome makes for sometimes severe photosensitivity
2016-10-22 20:06:47	Riotela	I have some issue with Twilight that I don't remember and f.lux requires root. I have been using OxygenOS night mode (no idea if it's also in stock Android), but it's not so pleasant to use with it either as opposed to some app with dark theme like Conversations
2016-10-22 20:12:00		[20:06]
2016-10-22 20:20:11	@meskarune	I use redshift and mostly dark themes and stylish to set dark themes on sites I use often

2016-10-27 07:06:00		[07:00]
2016-10-27 07:10:02	Riotela	:( this router has habit of making IPv6 disappear hourly unless rebooted and now I did factory reset and its been working for hours and I am thinking it will be broken by morning as it still works
2016-10-27 07:10:25	ng0	ipv6? more like bloAAAAAAAAAt
2016-10-27 07:10:31	alad	phrik: bloat ipv6
2016-10-27 07:10:31	phrik	ipv6 is bloat
2016-10-27 07:11:15	ng0	ipv6: it's there,  but 90% of ISPs don't support it
2016-10-27 07:12:33	Riotela	When did you last check that number?
2016-10-27 07:13:12	ng0	it feels like no one supports it, 2016
2016-10-27 07:13:25	Peng	<- Hurricane Electric tunnel :(
2016-10-27 07:14:57	Riotela	Finland: DNA supports, Elisa supports it on mobile, Sonera has 6rd so 2/3 networks ISPs have it in some form and 2/3 WISPs have it
2016-10-27 07:17:18	fsckd	my ISP supports it but i have to ask for it. a couple of years ago they made a big hullabaloo in tech news about supporting it. but it is off by default.
2016-10-27 07:19:40	Riotela	That sounds weird, it should be just a matter of enabling it in router/modem

2016-10-28 22:29:31	ng0	[17:11:15] ipv6: it's there,  but 90% of ISPs don't support it [17:11:15]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	Riotela	[17:12:33] When did you last check that number? [17:12:33]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	ng0	[17:13:12] it feels like no one supports it, 2016 [17:13:12]

2016-10-28 22:29:31	Riotela	[17:14:57] Finland: DNA supports, Elisa supports it on mobile, Sonera has 6rd so 2/3 networks ISPs have it in some form and 2/3 WISPs have it [17:14:57]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	fsckd	[17:17:18] my ISP supports it but i have to ask for it. a couple of years ago they made a big hullabaloo in tech news about supporting it. but it is off by default. [17:17:18]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	Riotela	[17:19:40] That sounds weird, it should be just a matter of enabling it in router/modem [17:19:40]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	fsckd	[17:24:44] yes it does sound weird [17:24:44]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	@meskarune	[18:26:28] with comcast I had it if I plugged my computer directly into the modem [18:26:28]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	@meskarune	[18:26:38] but the router didn't support ipv6 routing [18:26:38]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	fsckd	[18:27:07] i have comcast too... hmm... [18:27:07]

2016-10-28 22:59:02	ng0	how hard can you fail as parents to deliver continously more reasons why someone doesn't want any contact (currently/at all)... -.-
2016-10-28 22:59:27	ng0	should've walked to the postbox on monday
2016-10-28 22:59:55	alad	what happened?
2016-10-28 23:01:43	spider-mario	did they receive your package and keep it?
2016-10-28 23:03:08	ng0	I opened my postbox, found 3 letters. one I expected, 2 I did not. The 2 were one letter from a private life insurrance I never wanted, started when I was too young to sign valid contracts myself, and the first one was a letter by my parents with a page appended cancel an insurance I never wanted. But the point is they contacted me and how passive agressive the words were again
2016-10-28 23:03:08		[23:03]
2016-10-28 23:05:47	ng0	now I have to decide wether I want to tell the life insurrance they can f'off or if I pay one month and terminate it then
2016-10-28 23:05:48	ng0	what makes me angry the most is this move with the insurance
2016-10-28 23:05:48	ng0	I doubt this is legally binding

2016-10-28 23:06:38	ng0	ok
2016-10-28 23:07:22	ng0	yeah.. without informing me, without any text they moved a rather expensive life-insurance from their payments to mine
2016-10-28 23:07:54	ng0	there's no consent from my side involved, i just got the invoice
2016-10-28 23:09:09	ng0	insurance office opens on monday again, so I can call them.. the added problem is also: I have no clue how much is in there
2016-10-28 23:09:28	ng0	I don't want no money from them
2016-10-28 23:10:27	ng0	but if I have no choice, I have to explain to where I currently get my money from why I suddenly have idk how much money in my account without telling them
2016-10-28 23:10:52	ng0	and my parents are not stupid.. they calculated this
2016-10-28 23:11:04	ng0	eh I mean this was done on purpose
2016-10-28 23:13:10	ng0	I wrote a reply impulsive and quick, but I think I'll talk this through with friends tonight
2016-10-28 23:16:29	ng0	it makes me sad to deal with people who are not capable to: understand no means no, yes means yes; respect boundaries.
2016-10-28 23:20:03	ng0	i can't even remember when they started this life insurance... when I was age 13? age 15? I know it's now at ~40 euro/month

2016-10-29 03:00:46	ng0	past-things.. and also because of what's right now. I told them I currently want no contact and I will get back in touch when it's okay for me again. This lead to the usual behavior of them not respecting my boundaries and not accepting "no" etc for an answer.
2016-10-29 03:00:47	+tigrmesh	my father was wonderful.  but my mother was often cruel
2016-10-29 03:00:52	ng0	it's a toxic relationship
2016-10-29 03:01:42	tlamer	I see... I'm sorry to hear that. :(
2016-10-29 03:01:48	ng0	and my father did nothing, stayed in the neutral zone, and there is some dependency on my mother (and house, insurance, etc) so when she told him to "do" something he did punish us too... so not entirely neutral
2016-10-29 03:01:55	tlamer	With parent's it's probably always complicated... :(
2016-10-29 03:02:10	Soni	parents suck
2016-10-29 03:02:19	ng0	i hate the family of my mother, I have almost no connection to my sister, the only relatives which are okay is the family of my father
2016-10-29 03:02:35	Soni	the worst part is that parents make laws, usually
2016-10-29 03:02:47	tlamer	It's so sad to hear that from so many people..
2016-10-29 03:02:56	ng0	it's sad, but I've saccepted the fact long ago that I will never deal with them normally
2016-10-29 03:03:09	Soni	so if you've ever wondered why laws suck, blame parents
2016-10-29 03:03:24	tlamer	I don't have a good relationship with wider family but I love my parents and my brother and I'd say we come along pretty well...
2016-10-29 03:03:31	ng0	the only thing legal thing I need to achieve is to get them out of any testament / hospital etc things
2016-10-29 03:03:57	ng0	i obviously can't drop the family name just like that, but I would if I could
2016-10-29 03:03:57	tlamer	ng0: that sounds... extreme...

2016-10-29 03:07:44	ng0	Soni: well, for me it would be a statement. but sadly the laws regarding name change are easier when you want to change your first name or if your family name is read as something insulting or so common that there are so many people with the name that it gets you into trouble very often, cases like this which do not apply to my name
2016-10-29 03:08:17	Soni	* libbies gives Soni a booklet of hug vouchers <Soni> a uh what why?

2016-10-29 03:11:33		[03:11]
2016-10-29 03:11:51	Soni	don't you have to ask if you can give the person hug vouchers first?
2016-10-29 03:13:49	tlamer	Soni: But if you get a voucher it's still you who decides if you want a hug...
2016-10-29 03:15:16	tlamer	Soni: And libbies doesn't risk to be rejected...
2016-10-29 03:19:45	libbies	http://www.printingideas.co.uk/images/blog/Rotunda.jpg <-- this is what a booklet looks like
2016-10-29 03:20:00	libbies	a booklet of hug vouchers contains several individual sheets of hug vouchers
2016-10-29 03:20:26	libbies	this is what an individual hug voucher looks like: http://www.leekennedy.id.au/Graphics/Voucher7.jpg
2016-10-29 03:20:36	libbies	hence, a booklet of hug vouchers is a booklet of vouchers like the hug voucher above
2016-10-29 03:21:00	libbies	http://www.leekennedy.id.au/Graphics/Voucher4.jpg
2016-10-29 03:21:23	tlamer	libbies: that's cute :)
2016-10-29 03:21:29	libbies	Soni: giving someone a 'physical' object that they can then choose to throw away is different from physical contact
2016-10-29 03:21:47	libbies	s/physical contact/'physical' contact/
2016-10-29 03:25:59	Soni	libbies, hmm... pedantically speaking, that could be considered manipulative under some circumstances...
2016-10-29 03:26:55	libbies	okay, could you explain that to me, so that i can try to address whatever the underlying issue is, in the future?
2016-10-29 03:26:55		[03:26]
2016-10-29 03:27:45	Soni	say, if ng0 's parents gave them a hug voucher...
2016-10-29 03:27:53	libbies	ng0 can discard it
2016-10-29 03:27:55	Soni	that could be considered manipulative
2016-10-29 03:27:56	libbies	or ignore it
2016-10-29 03:28:06	libbies	or give it to someone else
2016-10-29 03:28:19	libbies	but i suppose that there's some pressure to follow through with some action of some sort
2016-10-29 03:28:33	libbies	but it's still better than ng0's parents hugging them directly
2016-10-29 03:28:34	ng0	I would burn it
2016-10-29 03:28:52	Soni	huh you actually sound like me now

2016-10-29 12:25:05	demize	[17:08:01] libbies: Facebook supports PGP encrypted emails these days, which is interesting. [17:08:01]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	libbies	[17:08:22] interesting indeed [17:08:22]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	demize	[17:08:34] Too bad more things doesn't. [17:08:34]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	@meskarune	[17:11:37] yeah, for sure. I like that facebook allows that. [17:11:37]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	@meskarune	[17:11:46] but honestly I'd rather they never email me >.> [17:11:46]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	@meskarune	[17:11:50] too much spam [17:11:50]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	demize	[17:13:14] They don't email me after disabling all the email notification things now. [17:13:14]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	demize	[17:13:39] Though few weeks ago they had mysteriously forgotten, and started sending me emails anytime any of my friends commented on anything. [17:13:39]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	fsckd	[17:13:56] they do that [17:13:56]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	fsckd	[17:14:13] i gave up trying to get them to stoop emailing me [17:14:13]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	demize	[17:14:39] I recently disabled my account. [17:14:39]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	demize	[17:14:42] No use for it. [17:14:42]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	fsckd	[17:15:38] yeah [17:15:38]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	spider-mario	[17:22:27] a while ago, they made it so that e-mails for new messages would only be sent after 30 minutes (instead of instantaneously) [17:22:27]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	spider-mario	[17:22:41] that’s when I unsubscribed from them [17:22:41]

2016-10-29 12:25:05	spider-mario	[18:13:13] if the maintainer is unresponsive, you can always request that the package be orphaned [18:13:13]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	spider-mario	[18:13:26] and then adopt and fix it yourself [18:13:26]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	spider-mario	[18:13:41] I think I have done that in the past [18:13:41]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	spider-mario	[18:14:01] (the maintainer even wrote me an e-mail accusing me of stealing the package) [18:14:01]

2016-10-29 12:25:05	spider-mario	[18:24:49] ah, found it: not actually an e-mail but a comment on the package page [18:24:49]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	spider-mario	[18:25:12] which got lost when the aur was upgraded [18:25:12]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	spider-mario	[18:25:27] (I gave the package back, since it seemed so important) [18:25:27]

2016-10-29 12:28:11	fsckd	spider-mario: when i started using Arch, i did not know we could do that. there was a maintainer of a package who was doing a *horrible* job. he didn't even use Arch or said package. he was using OpenBSD and the package was a patched kernel.

2016-10-29 12:35:24	fsckd	he refused to give up the package unless a TU adopted it and took it to Community. as no TU was willing, he had the package deleted. i resubmitted the package right after (when a wonderful TU said i could). it took a few months to fix all the bugs in his PKGBUILD. i gave up looking for bugs and rewrote the whole thing.

2016-10-29 12:44:15	@meskarune	there doens't seem to be any good docs for them :/
2016-10-29 12:44:47	fsckd	how long is the class running?
2016-10-29 12:45:50	fsckd	you can see past PKGBUILD classes for what they did
2016-10-29 12:50:04	Soni	I like how pkgbuilds are build scripts
2016-10-29 12:50:11	Soni	I dislike the lack of plugins
2016-10-29 12:50:43	Soni	hmm
2016-10-29 12:50:51	Soni	can a PKGBUILD include other files?
2016-10-29 12:51:10	@meskarune	fsckd: well I got the basic format from past classes, those are listed at the top
2016-10-29 12:51:23	Soni	hmm why am I trying to turn PKGBUILD/makepkg into a macro processor? .-.

2016-10-30 11:49:00	spider-mario	if you were talking about pulseaudio-alsa earlier: it contains a config file for alsalib that makes it uses pulseaudio as the default output device
2016-10-30 11:49:14	spider-mario	so that alsa apps can output sound even if pulseaudio is being used
2016-10-30 11:49:44	ng0	I'm listening to music I've listened to so often, searching for pieces I can use, classical music, and it's a bit annoying skipping through them and still finding relevant parts. takes the joy out of music :)
2016-10-30 11:50:35	ng0	spider-mario: thanks :) meanwhile I've read the readme file of that plugin and moved the relevant files to its own output (not audio, but guix build output)

2016-10-31 00:22:53	spider-mario	[21:48:35] hey ng0 :) [21:48:35]
2016-10-31 00:22:53	spider-mario	[21:49:00] if you were talking about pulseaudio-alsa earlier: it contains a config file for alsalib that makes it uses pulseaudio as the default output device [21:49:00]
2016-10-31 00:22:53	spider-mario	[21:49:14] so that alsa apps can output sound even if pulseaudio is being used [21:49:14]
2016-10-31 00:22:53	ng0	[21:49:44] I'm listening to music I've listened to so often, searching for pieces I can use, classical music, and it's a bit annoying skipping through them and still finding relevant parts. takes the joy out of music :) [21:49:44]
2016-10-31 00:22:53	ng0	[21:50:35] spider-mario: thanks :) meanwhile I've read the readme file of that plugin and moved the relevant files to its own output (not audio, but guix build output) [21:50:35]
2016-10-31 00:22:53	spider-mario	[21:53:08] a track I have discovered recently and listened to a lot during the past week is: https://youtu.be/hrjtwzwYorY [21:53:08]

2016-10-31 00:22:53	spider-mario	[21:53:32] it helped me fall asleep when I had to wake up at 5am to catch a flight on wednesday [21:53:32]

2016-10-31 00:22:53	ng0	[21:55:45] i'm looking for pieces I can take and resample into each other and change in frequency etc, for a start in "how to break up music" [21:55:45]

2016-10-31 13:42:01	j605	[08:46:19] because when it starts again, I will lose one hour sleep :( [08:46:19]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	spider-mario	[08:48:33] yeah, I wish we could get rid of DST [08:48:33]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	j605	[08:53:11] I wish they get something done after the debate [08:53:11]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	j605	[09:00:31] meskarune: that blog by the high school girl brought back a lot of things. How we still do it subconsciously :( [09:00:31]

2016-10-31 13:42:01	spider-mario	[21:48:35] hey ng0 :) [21:48:35]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	spider-mario	[21:49:00] if you were talking about pulseaudio-alsa earlier: it contains a config file for alsalib that makes it uses pulseaudio as the default output device [21:49:00]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	spider-mario	[21:49:14] so that alsa apps can output sound even if pulseaudio is being used [21:49:14]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	ng0	[21:49:44] I'm listening to music I've listened to so often, searching for pieces I can use, classical music, and it's a bit annoying skipping through them and still finding relevant parts. takes the joy out of music :) [21:49:44]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	ng0	[21:50:35] spider-mario: thanks :) meanwhile I've read the readme file of that plugin and moved the relevant files to its own output (not audio, but guix build output) [21:50:35]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	spider-mario	[21:53:08] a track I have discovered recently and listened to a lot during the past week is: https://youtu.be/hrjtwzwYorY [21:53:08]

2016-10-31 13:42:01	spider-mario	[21:53:32] it helped me fall asleep when I had to wake up at 5am to catch a flight on wednesday [21:53:32]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	ng0	[21:54:10] vivaldi has songs I've given up to try and play back when I thought I need to play super fast.. [21:54:10]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	ng0	[21:54:46] not even vivaldi, also others [21:54:46]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	ng0	[21:55:45] i'm looking for pieces I can take and resample into each other and change in frequency etc, for a start in "how to break up music" [21:55:45]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	ng0	[21:56:00] good thing my library of music if very big [21:56:00]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	ng0	[22:21:48] it's incredible how much melodies and names my brain has associated while I sometimes struggle with the most basic actions [22:21:48]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	ng0	[22:22:35] all I refused to do at some point was to learn enough of the grammar to be flexible enough to write notes not in panda speed [22:22:35]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	Soni	[22:35:56] what's a good simple, easy to use pixel editor? [22:35:56]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	Soni	[22:36:08] hmm [22:36:08]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	Soni	[22:36:25] why don't I just use a hex editor... [22:36:25]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	Soni	[22:36:48] hmm... [22:36:48]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	Soni	[22:37:02] I hate vim and emacs but I think one of them might be suitable for this [22:37:02]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	@meskarune	[22:43:44] I've edited hex with vim before [22:43:44]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	@meskarune	[22:43:54] but I think you have to do something for it to work [22:43:54]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	Soni	[22:49:10] no I wanna live-edit a bitmap pixelart [22:49:10]

2016-10-31 13:42:01	@meskarune	[22:49:47] is there a such thing as dead-editing? [22:49:47]
2016-10-31 13:42:01	Soni	[22:50:42] lol [22:50:42]

2016-10-31 13:42:01	jy2wong	[13:50:47] fantastic that someone's working on male birth control but we already said fuckit shipit to something with comparably bad side effects [13:50:47]

2016-10-31 14:50:43	ng0	once you start searching for samples, you start noticing samples and repeated melodies in music you listen to again .. it's true, everything is a remix.

2016-10-31 16:21:02	Soni	[01:20:04] "vapour" as in vapourware, "vapour" as in water vapour (steam) [01:20:04]
2016-10-31 16:21:02	Soni	[01:20:22] and it's basially be a FLOSS reimplementation of steam [01:20:22]
2016-10-31 16:21:02	Soni	[01:20:29] without the DRM bits [01:20:29]
2016-10-31 16:21:02	Soni	[01:20:45] (so you wouldn't be able to play any of the DRMed steam games - but everything else would work fine) [01:20:45]
2016-10-31 16:21:02	ng0	[01:21:32] ah, so not like our cracked, local network only, steam back then :) [01:21:32]
2016-10-31 16:21:02	Soni	[01:22:15] yeah definitely not cracked [01:22:15]
2016-10-31 16:21:02	Soni	[01:23:19] anyway good night o/ [01:23:19]
2016-10-31 16:21:02	ng0	[01:23:29] good night o/ [01:23:29]
2016-10-31 16:21:02	Soni	[01:23:44] (oh btw I've had this idea for a while, but nobody had mentioned anything vaguely similar before) [01:23:44]
2016-10-31 16:21:02	ng0	[01:24:19] this melody is really irritating. seems like a variation of it is used in many songs I listen to right now [01:24:19]
2016-10-31 16:21:02	Soni	[01:24:43] (uh, for context, one of the multimc devs mentioned a similar idea, altho less reimplementy and more integratey) [01:24:43]
2016-10-31 16:21:02	fsckd	[01:24:47] Soni: good night, and that is a nice idea :) [01:24:47]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Soni	[01:25:25] fsckd, if you do decide to work on it [01:25:25]

2016-10-31 16:21:03	fsckd	[01:25:48] lol, you have my word :) [01:25:48]

2016-10-31 16:21:03	ng0	[01:27:26] i'm tired don't take me sirious [01:27:26]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Soni	[01:27:27] (C++ doesn't actually scare me, but its level of crappyness/bloat just hurts me... and it gives me panic attacks sometimes, not entirely sure why...) [01:27:27]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	Soni	[01:27:42] but yeah good night o/ [01:27:42]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	ng0	[01:28:57] I should check out this month what this melody is.. it's used way too often to be just a trademark of this one project [01:28:57]

2016-10-31 20:31:03	@meskarune	I gave a linux live cd to a woman working in a fricken bakery because she was interested after seeing my computer

2016-11-01 06:48:06	Soni	I think you're looking for "latency" instead
2016-11-01 06:48:23	libbies	i am looking for throughput
2016-11-01 06:48:26	libbies	c is not throughput
2016-11-01 06:48:43	libbies	what's the read throughput of moon-data :P
2016-11-01 06:48:49	Soni	same bps as you put in
2016-11-01 06:48:59	Soni	so it's as fast as your laser
2016-11-01 06:49:24	Soni	the latency tho is a few minutes to re-read the same data
2016-11-01 06:49:59	libbies	i don't think you can actually read at the same rate you write here
2016-11-01 06:50:11	libbies	because you can certainly send more data than you can write, it would sound like to me
2016-11-01 06:50:12	Soni	you can
2016-11-01 06:50:18	libbies	er, than you can read*
2016-11-01 06:50:22	Soni	actually you have to be able to
2016-11-01 06:50:30	libbies	no, that's not true
2016-11-01 06:50:34	Soni	uh yes it is
2016-11-01 06:50:39	libbies	not at all
2016-11-01 06:50:39	Soni	otherwise you lose data
2016-11-01 06:50:46	libbies	well

2016-11-02 00:56:13	ng0	[22:08:50] i agree [22:08:50]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	ng0	[22:09:13] i did not say knowledge for career, as you might've noticed. [22:09:13]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	Soni	[22:09:31] by all means do restrict the work, but don't make laws saying you need a degree for something >.> [22:09:31]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	ng0	[22:10:17] in some professions it makes sense [22:10:17]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	Soni	[22:10:33] nah you can just restrict the work [22:10:33]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	ng0	[22:10:40] not for the entry level, but later [22:10:40]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	Soni	[22:11:47] I do my own wiring at home, but AFAIK I can't do that for a living unless I get a degree, which IMO is stupid >.> [22:11:47]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	ng0	[22:12:57] I would want no doctor (depending on which part of me is affected) who just read some books about it and "theoretically" can do it [22:12:57]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	ng0	[22:13:16] some regulations make sense [22:13:16]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	Soni	[22:13:22] <Soni> by all means do restrict the work [22:13:22]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	ng0	[22:13:45] I think we mean different things by degree [22:13:45]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	Soni	[22:14:11] you can require previous experience no problem [22:14:11]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	Soni	[22:14:48] and discrimination on the grounds of having a degree should be allowed [22:14:48]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	ng0	[22:14:50] I think you should reach some degree of knowledge both practical and theoretical, and proof that, before you start certain jobs [22:14:50]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	Soni	[22:15:06] oh [22:15:06]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	Soni	[22:15:21] you're thinking of "some degree" not "a degree" [22:15:21]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	ng0	[22:15:43] college is what again exactly? I was thinking university.. [22:15:43]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	ng0	[22:15:56] I'm not living in a country where a college form exists [22:15:56]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	ng0	[22:16:16] it's before university iirc [22:16:16]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	fsckd	[22:57:13] ng0: in the US a university is made of multiple colleges. and colleges are standalone too. [22:57:13]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	ng0	[23:06:59] so different then just those facilities of universities which can be spread across the city [23:06:59]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	ng0	[23:21:02] facilities might've been the wrong word [23:21:02]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	ng0	[23:21:13] let me try an example: [23:21:13]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	ng0	[23:24:55] University Duisburg/Essen has a buildings all across the city of Essen, and some even in Duisburg, not so tight together like bigger university complexes in other cities because they needed to spread even further.. so for example germanistik is in one building complex, but psychology is in another one at the other end of the city [23:24:55]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	ng0	[23:31:20] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockism there's a word for what I've often discussed with people in a more or less distant past.. interesting [23:31:20]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	phrik	[23:31:21] Title: Rockism - Wikipedia (at en.wikipedia.org) [23:31:21]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	Soni	[23:33:39] brain's regex engine never ceases to amaze me [23:33:39]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	Soni	[23:34:27] I love being able to recognize an artist even without knowing the song [23:34:27]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	Soni	[23:36:00] so many games (and youtube videos) use kevin macleod :P [23:36:00]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	ng0	[23:56:16] hm.. i should watch Carlito's Way. I just learned that the famous used "here comes the pain!" sample is from this movie with al pacino and penelope ann miller [23:56:16]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	kete	[01:49:29] The university in my town has the medical school on the other side of town beside the hospital. [01:49:29]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	jflory7	[05:21:59] o/ [05:21:59]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	Soni	[05:52:02] I should reboot [05:52:02]
2016-11-02 00:56:13	Soni	[05:52:54] things are failing because I haven't rebooted since my last -Syu [05:52:54]

2016-11-03 06:35:07	alad	isn't "dark web" a really broad term that covers about anything not publicly accessible? like it could be some school site
2016-11-03 06:35:09	alad	or whatever
2016-11-03 06:36:38	ng0	the hollywood definition is anything "supposedly" not being indexed (but really .onions etc are indexed by google and more specialized search engines). so yeah
2016-11-03 06:37:27	ng0	we get those hollywood people on our chatserver often.. "hello, is this a chat?" "hello, what is this?"

2016-11-03 09:17:07	demize	Yeah.
2016-11-03 09:17:07	demize	He's currently running under profiling.
2016-11-03 09:17:07	@meskarune	demize: I don't see how the alw plugin could hang anything, but if you find an issue with it I'll try and fix
2016-11-03 09:17:08	demize	Definitely not.
2016-11-03 09:17:08	demize	Well
2016-11-03 09:17:08	demize	I mean, it would hang the bot while doing the request
2016-11-03 09:17:08	@meskarune	I mean, it gets data from json and posts it
2016-11-03 09:17:08	demize	But it's not used often enough where it could be the cause of this problem.
2016-11-03 09:17:08	@meskarune	it would be possible for me to make it threaded
2016-11-03 09:17:08	@meskarune	but that seems liek over kill
2016-11-03 09:17:08	demize	It's really not overkill, and there's a reason limnoria has built in support for it.
2016-11-03 09:17:08	demize	Because things like network request hold the whole bot up, especially if it's used a lot...
2016-11-03 09:17:08	demize	And phrik is in like 40 channels ;p

2016-11-03 09:27:37	@meskarune	I mean, I could probably make it threaded, I think I just have to change the plugin config for htat

2016-11-03 22:49:39	meskarune	[20:10:18] I think all the single word quote grabs should be removed [20:10:18]
2016-11-03 22:49:39	demize	[20:10:18] probably, yeah. [20:10:18]
2016-11-03 22:49:39	meskarune	[20:10:18] more than likely they are stuff like "nograb" and "hi" [20:10:18]
2016-11-03 22:49:39	meskarune	[20:10:38] or the quote grab plugin could have a min number of words check [20:10:38]
2016-11-03 22:49:39	meskarune	[20:10:48] so things with less than 3 words don't get saved [20:10:48]

2016-11-03 22:49:39	meskarune	[20:18:51] for some some reason some IRC bots come across as male or female to me ¯\_(シ)_/¯ [20:18:51]
2016-11-03 22:49:39	alad	[20:19:26] I guess as the profane successor to phrakture, phrik is male [20:19:26]

2016-11-04 14:10:53	alad	[23:10:27] I can do most things with my left hand, apart from writing [23:10:27]
2016-11-04 14:10:53	spider-mario	[23:12:15] I think I used to be somewhat ambidextrous as a kid [23:12:15]
2016-11-04 14:10:53	spider-mario	[23:12:35] but then, one day, my preschool teacher asked me what hand I really wanted to use (since I kept switching) [23:12:35]
2016-11-04 14:10:53	spider-mario	[23:12:44] and I picked the right hand [23:12:44]
2016-11-04 14:10:53	spider-mario	[23:13:02] but there are still a few things I do like a left-handed person [23:13:02]
2016-11-04 14:10:53	spider-mario	[23:13:16] e.g. on a skateboard, I face left [23:13:16]
2016-11-04 14:10:53	spider-mario	[23:14:23] (but it’s also possible that my memory is very warped) [23:14:23]
2016-11-04 14:10:53	alad	[23:14:47] I should learn to write chinese with my left hand, just because [23:14:47]
2016-11-04 14:10:53	spider-mario	[23:14:57] (maybe what I call “ambidextrous” really is “equally clumsy with both hands”) [23:14:57]

2016-11-04 16:45:21	spider-mario	[23:10:01] maybe right-handed people should let their left hand write once in a while [23:10:01]

2016-11-05 00:17:21	spider-mario	[22:41:25] “The neuroscientist V. S. Ramachandran once encountered a split-brain patient whose left hemisphere believed in God, but whose right hemisphere was an atheist.” [22:41:25]
2016-11-05 00:17:21	spider-mario	[22:41:30] doesn’t sound very convenient [22:41:30]
2016-11-05 00:17:21	+tigrmesh	[23:00:36] hehe [23:00:36]
2016-11-05 00:17:21	spider-mario	[23:08:57] I wonder how different most people’s two “personalities” are [23:08:57]
2016-11-05 00:17:21	spider-mario	[23:09:07] after all, it’s the left hemisphere that gets to talk [23:09:07]
2016-11-05 00:17:21	spider-mario	[23:10:01] maybe right-handed people should let their left hand write once in a while [23:10:01]
2016-11-05 00:17:21	alad	[23:10:27] I can do most things with my left hand, apart from writing [23:10:27]
2016-11-05 00:17:21	spider-mario	[23:12:15] I think I used to be somewhat ambidextrous as a kid [23:12:15]
2016-11-05 00:17:21	spider-mario	[23:12:35] but then, one day, my preschool teacher asked me what hand I really wanted to use (since I kept switching) [23:12:35]
2016-11-05 00:17:21	spider-mario	[23:12:44] and I picked the right hand [23:12:44]
2016-11-05 00:17:21	spider-mario	[23:13:02] but there are still a few things I do like a left-handed person [23:13:02]
2016-11-05 00:17:21	spider-mario	[23:13:16] e.g. on a skateboard, I face left [23:13:16]
2016-11-05 00:17:21	spider-mario	[23:14:23] (but it’s also possible that my memory is very warped) [23:14:23]
2016-11-05 00:17:21	alad	[23:14:47] I should learn to write chinese with my left hand, just because [23:14:47]
2016-11-05 00:17:21	spider-mario	[23:14:57] (maybe what I call “ambidextrous” really is “equally clumsy with both hands”) [23:14:57]
2016-11-05 00:17:21	alad	[23:15:09] heh [23:15:09]

2016-11-05 01:36:00		[01:30]
2016-11-05 01:36:31	alad	ahoi
2016-11-05 01:38:20	ng0	i'm confused. the person I maintain the gentoo overlay of gnunet with just added a whole lot of changes in the packages I maintain without any additional comment... yeah, please feel free to take over and mess up my packages so I can entirely ignore gentoo again.
2016-11-05 01:38:22	ng0	-.-
2016-11-05 01:38:40	ng0	really, I would be more than happy to drop gentoo.
2016-11-05 01:39:13	ng0	removed 4 files and droped lots of dependencies I figured out in the last 1.3 years
2016-11-05 01:39:20	alad	phrik: give ng0 doit
2016-11-05 01:39:20	phrik	ng0: Dooooooooo eeeeeeeettttttttt
2016-11-05 01:39:21	ng0	what
2016-11-05 01:39:25	alad	drop gentoo
2016-11-05 01:39:28	alad	:P
2016-11-05 01:40:54	ng0	i mean, I try to maintain some level of quality because this is supposed to go into portage at some point. it's my name on the bugs and my name in the overlay database even if this is collectively maintained
2016-11-05 01:41:53	alad	…remove your name?
2016-11-05 01:42:27	ng0	there has to be a maintainer. it's because of my efforts that the overlay is even listed
2016-11-05 01:43:57	alad	eh, then speak to the person who made those changes and ask them what the fuck they are doing
2016-11-05 01:44:07	ng0	i just did
2016-11-05 01:44:14	alad	so, response?
2016-11-05 01:44:18	ng0	waiting
2016-11-05 01:44:25	alad	mk
2016-11-05 01:44:49	ng0	this was even after I added a package policy to my webspace :D
2016-11-05 01:45:26	ng0	i thought comments in commits or code were standard.. apparently they aren't
2016-11-05 01:46:36	ng0	i started to do more guix than gentoo, maybe i should just stop doing gentoo. i only use it to compile gnurl, and even that will be switched to guixsd soon.
2016-11-05 01:46:52	alad	+1 to "stop using gentoo"
2016-11-05 01:46:56	alad	:P
2016-11-05 01:52:00		[01:46]
2016-11-05 02:05:22	ng0	if I stop doing it, I can just hope someone will pickup what I had at some point and move it to portage. in some way I want to become gentoo developer so I can push this to portage, but then again I don't want to, because I'm already doing so many projects. Positive outcome of all this would be I learned how to do ebuilds.

2016-11-05 02:17:54	ng0	|| was for a reason
2016-11-05 02:18:25	ng0	why do people change stuff without knowing why a change was made when it's clear in the commit message which added the change
2016-11-05 02:18:27	ng0	arghhhh
2016-11-05 02:19:27	spider-mario	maybe they don’t know how to blame
2016-11-05 02:23:46	ng0	starting from head it's the 10th commit after head..
2016-11-05 02:23:52	ng0	you don't even need to blame

2016-11-06 03:24:35	+tigrmesh	are you in a place where many native speakers of german live?
2016-11-06 03:25:08	ng0	in the heart of the Ruhrarea in Germany I'd say so
2016-11-06 03:25:39	ng0	but I have lived in other cities here before
2016-11-06 03:25:54	ng0	and no city had that much volksmusik event..
2016-11-06 03:26:02	+tigrmesh	i see
2016-11-06 03:26:08	ng0	it's like they are just looking for random reasons for volksmusik
2016-11-06 03:27:04	+tigrmesh	someone who has a talent for organizing likes volksmusik
2016-11-06 03:27:43	ng0	a friend recently moved to the next bigger city where their university is, before that they lived like 200 meters away from us, directly above the place where most of these events are
2016-11-06 03:28:53	ng0	there are enough buildings between my place and the events that I can cancel it out by closing the windows and listening to some kind of music or watching movies
2016-11-06 03:28:57	ng0	otherwise I'd still hear it
2016-11-06 03:29:38	alad	ng0: great, now I'm going to listen on youtube to yodeling for 5 hours. thanks ><
2016-11-06 03:29:55	ng0	oO
2016-11-06 03:30:10	ng0	that's not the kind of music i meant
2016-11-06 03:30:31	+tigrmesh	accordions?
2016-11-06 03:30:34	ng0	the bad kind of pop music they play at deutsche hitparade der volksmusik etc
2016-11-06 03:30:39	alad	ng0: lol, link?
2016-11-06 03:30:47	ng0	helene fischer or whatever the names are
2016-11-06 03:31:06	alad	oh, schlager
2016-11-06 03:31:14	alad	that's not volksmusic, that's just garbage
2016-11-06 03:31:22	ng0	that is almost 1:1 with volksmusik now
2016-11-06 03:31:37	alad	meh
2016-11-06 03:32:00	alad	we're plagued with that stuff in belgium as well. awful
2016-11-06 03:32:47	ng0	a friend told me in berlin they mostly have techno at live events
2016-11-06 03:32:53	+tigrmesh	link for good music, link for bad?
2016-11-06 03:33:16	ng0	when i lived in Essen there were all kinds of live music, but no schlager
2016-11-06 03:33:30	+tigrmesh	schlager is bad?
2016-11-06 03:33:45	ng0	depends on your taste of music
2016-11-06 03:33:55	ng0	mine does not cover schlager
2016-11-06 03:33:59	alad	it's very basic pop melodies with trite lyrics
2016-11-06 03:34:35	ng0	repetive melodies and themes
2016-11-06 03:34:45	ng0	schlager is like happy hardcore, only worse

2016-11-06 03:36:37	ng0	then the usual suspects like wolfgang petry (no schlager but comparable BAD), helene fischer, etc
2016-11-06 03:36:56	alad	romantic ballad pop music of the worst kind
2016-11-06 03:37:18	ng0	there's a wiki page which describes it afaik.. it's pop music per definition, but ^
2016-11-06 03:37:38	ng0	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlager_music

2016-11-06 03:37:48	+tigrmesh	no boppy type pop music?
2016-11-06 03:38:16	ng0	"Germans view Schlager as their Country Music and in fact American Country and TexMex are both major elements in the Schlager culture (Is This the Way to Amarillo is regularly played in Schlager contexts, usually in the English original)."
2016-11-06 03:38:31	ng0	I'd not describe it as country music, but it's probably fitting
2016-11-06 03:38:53	+tigrmesh	is there no band?
2016-11-06 03:38:53		[03:38]
2016-11-06 03:39:06	ng0	"Stylistically, schlager continues to influence German "party pop": music most often heard in après-ski bars and Majorcan mass discos. Contemporary schlager is often mingled with Volkstümliche Musik. If it is not part of an ironic kitsch revival, a taste for both styles of music is commonly associated with a lower and lower middle class habitus, typically heard in folksy pubs, at fun fairs, and
2016-11-06 03:39:07	ng0	bowling league venues."
2016-11-06 03:39:24	ng0	sometimes there's a band
2016-11-06 03:40:11	+tigrmesh	so eurovision is more upscale
2016-11-06 03:40:42	alad	eurovision was pretty good in the late 80s
2016-11-06 03:40:45	ng0	I've only watched that 2 times, many years ago
2016-11-06 03:40:51	alad	now it's just a sad joke
2016-11-06 03:42:19	ng0	there are playlist with what people label these days as "eurotrash" music which are better to my ears than schlager
2016-11-06 03:42:42	+tigrmesh	work with me here.  youtube needs specifics.  what i know about german music are something yodeling, something accordion, polka beat
2016-11-06 03:42:49	ng0	it's the kind of electro and pop of the 90s and late 80s I grew up with
2016-11-06 03:43:04	+tigrmesh	which i am not familiar with
2016-11-06 03:43:08	+tigrmesh	ok
2016-11-06 03:43:17	+tigrmesh	electro pop.  gotcha
2016-11-06 03:43:45	ng0	hm.. that's a specific style. if you look at the singers listed in the wikiarticle you'll get samples for german schlager
2016-11-06 03:43:57	ng0	german music has a very broad range though :)
2016-11-06 03:49:00		[03:43]
2016-11-06 03:50:38	ng0	first time I heard rammstein was when I stayed at someones place on La Réunion.. so i didn#t have much regional preference :)

2016-11-06 04:18:16	+meskarune	and miike is a treasure to all mankind
2016-11-06 04:20:04	ng0	is it correct that googlecode gets shutdown end of this year? I understood the recent thread on the gentoo developer list like this
2016-11-06 04:20:04		[04:20]
2016-11-06 04:24:10	tlamer	miike?
2016-11-06 04:24:22	tlamer	Ow
2016-11-06 04:24:27	tlamer	the director
2016-11-06 04:25:50	+meskarune	yeah
2016-11-06 04:26:17	tlamer	meskarune: "Miike has garnered international notoriety for depicting shocking scenes of extreme violence and sexual perversions. Many of his films contain graphic and lurid bloodshed, often portrayed in an over-the-top, cartoonish manner."
2016-11-06 04:27:14	+meskarune	yes
2016-11-06 04:27:29	tlamer	meskarune: His movies aren't suitable for a romantic evening... :D
2016-11-06 04:27:33	+meskarune	but happiness of the katakuris is a comedy drama
2016-11-06 04:27:40	tlamer	meskarune: Okay
2016-11-06 04:28:04	tlamer	meskarune: I'll try to find it. I like korean and japanese movies
2016-11-06 04:28:06	+meskarune	tlamer: miike is famous for horror and weird gory action movies which are also incredibly well done
2016-11-06 04:28:25	tlamer	meskarune: I see
2016-11-06 04:28:26	+meskarune	but thats the one movie that is totally different from his regular style
2016-11-06 04:28:29	+meskarune	but still miike
2016-11-06 04:28:40	+meskarune	honestly I love all his movies
2016-11-06 04:29:10	+meskarune	gozu and ichi the killer are probably his most famous
2016-11-06 04:29:30	tlamer	I don't know these.
2016-11-06 04:29:43	+meskarune	"His films range from violent and bizarre to dramatic and family-friendly."
2016-11-06 04:29:51	tlamer	But I like "different" movies.
2016-11-06 04:30:08	tlamer	Most of Hollywood production is all the same.
2016-11-06 04:30:20	+meskarune	not just different, but the production on his films are always really high quality
2016-11-06 04:30:41	+meskarune	every scene is very well planned and throught out
2016-11-06 04:30:42	tlamer	meskarune: do you know Park-Chan Wook?
2016-11-06 04:30:44	tlamer	meskarune: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Chan-wook

2016-11-06 15:23:35	alad	has a tl;dr
2016-11-06 15:23:45	APNG	yeah I re-read it
2016-11-06 15:23:53	APNG	~/.local/share is correct
2016-11-06 15:23:59	-->	xocket (~xocket@unaffiliated/xocket) has joined #archlinux-women
2016-11-06 15:24:17	APNG	(well, $XDG_DATA_HOME, but that's ~/.local/share when $XDG_DATA_HOME is unset)

2016-11-06 15:28:08	APNG	so how do I make such script? .-.
2016-11-06 15:28:34	APNG	I'll ask a bash channel .-.
2016-11-06 15:29:45	alad	I don't even know what you're trying to do
2016-11-06 15:30:23	APNG	I kinda have an addiction problem but I don't keep track of my "clean" time
2016-11-06 15:30:41	APNG	so I wanna make a shell script to do that for me
2016-11-06 15:30:47	APNG	replace myself with a shell script
2016-11-06 15:30:53	alad	may I suggest a specialized solution like org-mode, task, calcurse, etc. ?
2016-11-06 15:31:15	alad	but assuming a script; how are you supposed to interact with it?
2016-11-06 15:31:23	APNG	./relapse --today
2016-11-06 15:31:46	APNG	or ./relapse <unixtimestamp>
2016-11-06 15:31:59	alad	so basically some timer that resets when you send it a command?
2016-11-06 15:32:10	APNG	no
2016-11-06 15:32:23	APNG	*append* to a file when I relapse
2016-11-06 15:32:38	alad	append the elapsed "clean" time when you do so ?
2016-11-06 15:32:44	APNG	no
2016-11-06 15:32:48	alad	<_<
2016-11-06 15:32:54	alad	can you make a diagram or something
2016-11-06 15:32:59	APNG	I wanna keep a log of all the times I relapsed
2016-11-06 15:33:10	alad	oh
2016-11-06 15:33:10		[15:33]
2016-11-06 15:33:13	alad	that's pretty simple
2016-11-06 15:33:27	APNG	I could calculate stuff but meh
2016-11-06 15:33:42	alad	alias relapse='date -Iminutes >> ~/relapse.txt'
2016-11-06 15:33:44	alad	:P
2016-11-06 15:33:58	APNG	unix time please >.>
2016-11-06 15:34:02	alad	uh, man date
2016-11-06 15:34:06	alad	can't remember it :D
2016-11-06 15:34:21	APNG	ok so
2016-11-06 15:34:28	APNG	does that create the file if it doesn't exist?
2016-11-06 15:34:33	Peng	yes
2016-11-06 15:34:41	APNG	does that create the dirtree?
2016-11-06 15:34:55	Peng	no, but ~ should always exist
2016-11-06 15:35:02	alad	date -u '%s'
2016-11-06 15:35:21	APNG	Peng, ~/.local/share/ tho
2016-11-06 15:35:31	alad	or wait
2016-11-06 15:35:32	Peng	ohh
2016-11-06 15:35:48	Peng	sorry, it overflowed my brain's scrollback
2016-11-06 15:36:00	alad	invalid date blah blah
2016-11-06 15:36:03	alad	stupid date nonsense
2016-11-06 15:36:34	alad	date '+%s'
2016-11-06 15:36:39	alad	I just googled that one as date(1) is garbage
2016-11-06 15:38:32	alad	APNG: alias relapse='date +%s >> ~/.local/share/relapse.txt'
2016-11-06 15:38:54	APNG	ok
2016-11-06 15:39:04	APNG	how do I pick between --today and a unix timestamp?
2016-11-06 15:40:23	alad	if [[ $1 == --today ]]; then date <somethingformatter>; else date +%s; fi >> ~/.local/share/relapse.txt
2016-11-06 15:40:58	alad	for somethingformatter, `info date` has some examples
2016-11-06 15:41:22	alad	section 21.1.7 :-P
2016-11-06 15:47:00		[15:41]
2016-11-06 15:51:09	APNG	no I mean
2016-11-06 15:51:11	APNG	eh nvm
2016-11-06 15:56:23	alad	meh
2016-11-06 15:56:25	alad	#bash
2016-11-06 16:02:00		[15:56]
2016-11-06 16:06:18	fsckd	unix epoch is irrespective of local time zone :)
2016-11-06 16:07:03	fsckd	based on UTC but isn't quite UTC. eventually they will differ. but by then humans will be extinct and cockroaches will tell time by the ripples in the air.
2016-11-06 16:07:06	APNG	--today should use the current time in unix time
2016-11-06 16:07:31	APNG	if --today is not specified then a valid unix timestamp must be passed, and that's gonna be used as the relapse time

2016-11-06 16:08:04	fsckd	valid unix timestamp is just a positive integer
2016-11-06 16:08:22	fsckd	so something like...
2016-11-06 16:08:24	APNG	yes
2016-11-06 16:08:31	fsckd	one moment, i lost my mouse
2016-11-06 16:08:40	APNG	"stuff" is not a valid unix timestamp
2016-11-06 16:09:05	fsckd	simple regex to verify it is all integers
2016-11-06 16:09:54	fsckd	if [[ $1 == --today ]] blah elif [[ $1 =~ whatever regex ]] blah else error
2016-11-06 16:10:13	fsckd	the first blah would be the date command, the second blah is just appending to the file
2016-11-06 16:11:13	fsckd	you can make the test stronger by making sure teh integer is greater than a number, to make sure you haven't left off a few digits
2016-11-06 16:12:59	APNG	in theory I'd never use unix time directly but rather call it as ./relapse $(date <whatever>)
2016-11-06 16:13:14	APNG	why convert time myself if there's a tool for it
2016-11-06 16:13:21	APNG	unix philosophy and all
2016-11-06 16:13:42	fsckd	yeah. you can have that date command in the script
2016-11-06 16:14:10	fsckd	since you would be calling date anyways to get today's time
