2016-10-19 00:41:23	alad	[22:59:27] otherwise it's a night in a train [22:59:27]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	alad	[22:59:39] well I guess that's less than 10h [22:59:39]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[22:59:55] trains usually have a higher average than 60 [22:59:55]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:00:03] unless you are in norway :p [23:00:03]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	alad	[23:00:39] heh [23:00:39]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:01:00] fun thing: the train between bergen and oslo uses longer time now than 50 years ago, even though the line is quite a bit shorter now.... [23:01:00]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	alad	[23:01:46] -_- [23:01:46]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	alad	[23:02:06] do you also get these huge delays in public transportation in norway ? [23:02:06]

2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:03:01] alad: silly "economists" being in charge runining everything related to maintenance and upgrades for the past 30 years [23:03:01]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	alad	[23:03:08] wonderful [23:03:08]

2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:04:06] also the line near me tend to be rather low prioritised even though it has the most trafficed piece of rail in all of europe [23:04:06]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:04:32] when they complained about the bad quality of the old train sets around oslo (the capital) they instantly got new ones [23:04:32]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:04:38] and all the old sets were sent over here..... [23:04:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	ng0	[23:04:46] actually: 237 km [23:04:46]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	MrElendig	[23:04:56] because who cares about us, we are only the ones who actually makes money for the whole country [23:04:56]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	ng0	[23:05:00] just checked the distance [23:05:00]

2016-10-19 09:56:39	Soni	let's see how it handles no JS?

2016-10-19 09:58:48	Soni	ng0, you did say "*we* are now replaced by tea" linking to something that replaces the T with "tea"?
2016-10-19 09:59:14	Soni	unless I missed something...
2016-10-19 10:00:04	ng0	oh... humor. sorry x.x but recently I came to terms that non-binary is more appropriate to describe me if i have to
2016-10-19 10:00:14	ng0	maybe
2016-10-19 10:00:35	Soni	oh good that website doesn't work at all with JS off
2016-10-19 10:03:00	@fsckd	i don't get what these people have to do with LGBT. looks more like a pretentious marketing thing to get folks to buy their wares.
2016-10-19 10:03:42	ng0	yeah.. some colorful tea bags, that's all
2016-10-19 10:05:05	alad	fsckd: the fact that their website takes longer to load than an AAA game is telling enough
2016-10-19 10:05:21	@fsckd	haha

2016-10-19 10:06:34	alad	yeh, the most bloated browser is the most apt at handling bloat
2016-10-19 10:06:38	Soni	ng0, I thought I had completely lost my ability to detect trans ppl due to not using it, but apparently it still works
2016-10-19 10:07:19	Soni	(altho I didn't say anything before because I was waiting for you to confirm it and it's not a good idea to just go outing ppl just because you think they're trans)
2016-10-19 10:08:03	Soni	and no, idk how to phrase that better .-.
2016-10-19 10:09:15	ng0	"to detect" is, yeah it's not so good. it's like "oh, i have a radar for people who are gay". i understand what you tried to say though :)

2016-10-19 10:14:27	Soni	idk if it's because I'm autistic or because I'm good with regex (or alternatively, if me being good with regex has anything to do with me being autistic), but if I learn the right patterns I can detect anyone/anything
2016-10-19 10:15:01	Soni	maybe even tell if 2 nicks are the same person, altho I never tried that
2016-10-19 10:15:22	alad	Soni: wat

2016-10-19 10:16:05	Soni	I can infodump about regex if you want :P
2016-10-19 10:16:28	alad	feel free, I tried reading a PCRE man page once and it cost me two of my 9 lives
2016-10-19 10:17:25	Soni	uh PCRE can parse HTML
2016-10-19 10:18:34	halosghost	not arbitrary html
2016-10-19 10:19:13	Soni	ok
2016-10-19 10:19:21	Soni	PCRE can parse XML (and XHTML)
2016-10-19 10:19:39	Soni	it's like the only regex flavor that can do that...
2016-10-19 10:19:50	halosghost	1) it's still horrifically slow
2016-10-19 10:20:01	halosghost	2) why would you want to parse XML/XHTML with regex anyway?
2016-10-19 10:20:04	Soni	altho it'll choke if you have too many nested tags (recursion limit) or if the document is too long

2016-10-19 10:21:47	Soni	so yes, I don't expect anyone to be able to read PCRE man pages
2016-10-19 10:22:06	Soni	I'd say reading the source code might be easier?
2016-10-19 10:22:13	halosghost	I sincerely doubt that
2016-10-19 10:22:19	Soni	altho I learned PCRE by probing
2016-10-19 10:25:09	ng0	thompson nfa?
2016-10-19 10:25:26	Soni	[] are sets which are just a different form of | alternations limited to single characters with no special characters like ^ or $ or . but with support for character ranges and stuff and () make a group which stores the data inside it (this is how you use regex to parse and/or tokenize things) and ^ and $ can be used in groups and alternations which creates interesting things and there's a non-matching group syntax which I forgot and this is

2016-10-19 10:26:58	halosghost	ng0: yw
2016-10-19 10:27:17	Soni	all you need to know is [] [^] () ^ $ | . (in order of importance) and everything else comes naturally
2016-10-19 10:29:18	Soni	... oh right I forgot ? + *
2016-10-19 10:29:23	spider-mario	I wouldn’t say “naturally”
2016-10-19 10:30:18	Soni	(altho ? and + are sort-of sugar for | and *, respectively)
2016-10-19 10:30:32	halosghost	no they're not

2016-10-19 10:30:36	spider-mario	or {,}, one could argue
2016-10-19 10:30:46	Soni	they are if you support empty alternations
2016-10-19 10:31:11	Soni	p? = (?:p|) or something
2016-10-19 10:31:21	Soni	p+ = pp* or something
2016-10-19 10:31:34	halosghost	mk
2016-10-19 10:31:39	spider-mario	but that requires repeating p
2016-10-19 10:31:53	spider-mario	instead, you can define both ?, * and + in terms of {}
2016-10-19 10:31:55	Soni	keyword "sugar"
2016-10-19 10:32:03	@fsckd	regex is very useful to know
2016-10-19 10:32:08	Soni	{} is bleh
2016-10-19 10:32:09	spider-mario	sure, but still
2016-10-19 10:32:16	halosghost	Soni: (?:p|) isn't sugar; it's lookahead
2016-10-19 10:32:24	halosghost	which is not part of regex; it's a pcre extension
2016-10-19 10:32:25	Soni	halosghost, (?=p|) ?
2016-10-19 10:32:34	spider-mario	?: is unnamed group
2016-10-19 10:32:38	spider-mario	I mean non-capturing group
2016-10-19 10:32:39	Soni	eh
2016-10-19 10:32:40	spider-mario	sorry
2016-10-19 10:32:44	Soni	w/e the non-capturing group thing is
2016-10-19 10:32:59	halosghost	my apologies, not lookahead; still an extension
2016-10-19 10:33:15	alad	#archlinux-@#$%+?
2016-10-19 10:33:23	Soni	ik it's an extension but that's only because everyone else puts () as capture groups instead of a syntactical group (i.e. a precedence syntax)

2016-10-19 10:34:52	Soni	in math, x(x+3) isn't a capture on x+3, it just means you should evaluate x+3 first

2016-10-20 09:25:17	ng0	what where got i disconnected? I got cut off at some point
2016-10-20 09:26:00	fsckd	last thing you said was "before I ask for creating a new VM there, I wonder if it's possible with external services"
2016-10-20 09:26:09	ng0	ah.. ok
2016-10-20 09:26:47	ng0	sorry, I meant jflory7 then.
2016-10-20 09:27:21	 *	jflory7 looks up
2016-10-20 09:28:03	jflory7	Yes, Pagure was a homegrown project within Fedora, but it's now evolving to be a project beyond just Fedora.
2016-10-20 09:28:13	jflory7	It's a fairly capable git forge nowadays and is under consistent development.
2016-10-20 09:28:29	jflory7	But... I am a little biased. :) It's at least worth checking out on your own time too.
2016-10-20 09:29:05	ng0	I've looked at its own repo and see no tests.. gm
2016-10-20 09:29:07	ng0	*hm
2016-10-20 09:29:21	ng0	but this whole CI thing is new to me

2016-10-20 09:51:33	jflory7	ng0: Hmmm. I know the existing Pagure has integrated CI... I can't remember how it's visually shown or where to find it, though. I could probably brush up a bit. :P
2016-10-20 09:52:39	ng0	what the ebuild stuff ends up with is running repoman, which creates output like this which is useful: https://travis-ci.org/gentoo/musl

2016-10-20 09:53:28	@meskarune	jflory7: I told the arch devs to check it out since they are looking for a new issue issue tracker :)
2016-10-20 09:53:53	@meskarune	the don't really want to go with trac/redmine
2016-10-20 09:54:01	ng0	i know cuirass might have this feature in the future, but if we could have a mirror of our gnunet.org repo of the overlay on pagure which runs tests, that would be nice
2016-10-20 09:54:12	ng0	cuirass is just not there yet :)
2016-10-20 09:54:57	ng0	meskarune: is it better than those and also supports email interaction? that's the annoying feature some developers at guix need
2016-10-20 09:56:12	@meskarune	pagure is still being developed, but I think if another distro started using it and make patches/feature requests they would happen
2016-10-20 09:56:39	@meskarune	ng0: I don't personally like redmine or trac, but "better" is very subjective.
2016-10-20 09:56:59	jflory7	meskarune: I am almost positive that if ant of the Arch Infrastructure team had questions or wanted advice on implementing it, the developers and Fedora community would be more than happy to oblige
2016-10-20 09:57:17	jflory7	meskarune: Feel free to refer #fedora-apps + #pagure if you pass it along, people there would be best equipped to advise.
2016-10-20 09:57:31	jflory7	ng0: Define email interaction?
2016-10-20 09:57:46	@meskarune	jflory7: there is also the added advantage that arch already uses python/flask for their sites
2016-10-20 09:58:03	@meskarune	so like, adding one more python site means they already know how to admin that stuff
2016-10-20 09:58:04	jflory7	It's worth noting that Pagure is partially influenced by the wish to move away from Trac. A lot of core functionality that we used in Trac has been replicated or implemented in an alternative in Pagure
2016-10-20 09:58:07	ng0	yeah i know.. there's a strong opinion against bugzilla at our side (horrible maintenance) and I think ludovic said they tried many alternatives for bugtracking etc over the last years. Well, a must-have feature for some people is open/close/reply/etc to bugs without logging in to a webinterface
2016-10-20 09:58:18	 *	jflory7 nods to meskarune 
2016-10-20 09:58:40	 *	jflory7 also nods to ng0 
2016-10-20 09:59:01	ng0	then we ended with almost going to gitlab-ce but then there was a news about how the linux devs use email for everything and 'wooo praise email' ... and I just look at my sad 1000 emails / month
2016-10-20 09:59:13	ng0	I only feel better when I ignore most emails
2016-10-20 09:59:18	@meskarune	I hate using email lol
2016-10-20 09:59:54	@meskarune	I don't like how the messages are organized, I don't like trying to keep track of long email conversations and digging up past messages, its just a hassel
2016-10-20 10:00:10	ng0	there's 42 contributors now and just 3 regular reviewers, but I really have strong doubts that this will fix itself when we have more contributors in guix
2016-10-20 10:00:19	ng0	i find email terrible to deal with
2016-10-20 10:00:27	ng0	same
2016-10-20 10:00:58	spider-mario	at least gmail, inbox and kmail can keep message threads together
2016-10-20 10:01:34	ng0	i use notmuch.. this only happened because moving from gentoo to guixsd made franken-mutt disappear for now
2016-10-20 10:03:35	ng0	oh there's a page in docs.. installing pagure-ci
2016-10-20 10:04:30	@meskarune	are you wanting somsething like pagure that can add issues with email?
2016-10-20 10:05:15	ng0	as far as I understand the 6+ months discussions now, yes
2016-10-20 10:05:35	ng0	and for bugs, like debuggs..
2016-10-20 10:08:00	@meskarune	I think there is an email based issue tracker actually
2016-10-20 10:08:00		[10:08]
2016-10-20 10:08:03	ng0	i personally don't care about email, but right now what we have is one interface only.. with mailman3 this wouldn't be an issue (to some degree) but gnu.org doesn't deploy that either
2016-10-20 10:08:09	ng0	so everything is sad
2016-10-20 10:08:46	e^x	i think Debian's issue tracker interfaces with email
2016-10-20 10:09:00	ng0	bugs: debbugs. communication: irc. help/patches: 2 separate email lists
2016-10-20 10:09:09	ng0	that's how it works right now at our side
2016-10-20 10:09:27	ng0	als discussion+patches are one list
2016-10-20 10:09:49	ng0	i get less emails with gentoo due to bugzilla.
2016-10-20 10:10:04	ng0	guix must be ~700 emails/month at least
2016-10-20 10:10:56	ng0	even when filtered it is sensory overload because of information to process just by looking at subjects
2016-10-20 10:13:42	ng0	oh, you just need to use application X and Z or filter better... yeah that's not how you make it more accessible :/

2016-10-22 07:32:22	ng0	when I last used vim I did not need it

2016-10-22 07:35:13	alad	if the modelines are the same for every file, you could use sed to append it to each one

2016-10-22 19:38:16	@meskarune	thanks Riotela
2016-10-22 19:39:07	@meskarune	yeah, homophobic or transphobic sort implies the other person is being fearful rather than actually harmful and attacking
2016-10-22 19:40:17	@meskarune	doctors have started using photosensitivity rather than photophobia too since it means light is painful to the eyes, not that people are fearful of it
2016-10-22 19:41:00	Riotela	does it have connection to oversensitive sense of seeing?
2016-10-22 19:42:05	 *	Riotela is at father for recovering and his bathroom has horribly bright led that is close to hurting and even his living room lightning was hurting when she arrived after being stressed etc.

2016-10-22 19:54:07	@meskarune	Riotela: bright lights make my eyes hurt and being in the sun or under flourescents everything looks white, like looking into the sun, so I'm basically blind
2016-10-22 19:54:24	Riotela	:(
2016-10-22 19:54:33	Riotela	so it's different
2016-10-22 19:54:42	@meskarune	In my bedroom I have only LED lights that I can set to a reddish or orange tone
2016-10-22 19:54:54	@meskarune	since that is fine, but very bright light hurts my eyes
2016-10-22 19:55:01	@meskarune	even a bright computer screen
2016-10-22 19:55:49	@meskarune	when I get a bad migraine I can't even stand dim LEDs and end up unplugging everything in the room
2016-10-22 19:56:01	@meskarune	becuase of the light and sound the electronics make
2016-10-22 19:59:33	Riotela	Riot would probably fail you badly

2016-10-22 20:03:42	+elky	my parents in law bought a house about 18 months ago. their downstairs bathroom has 3 small suns instead of light globes and they still haven't bothered to replace them. they kill my eyes every time.
2016-10-22 20:04:00	Riotela	it's horribly white and bright especially on mobile where you cannot install dark theme with Stylish. They are aware of the problem, but e2ee is their biggest priority
2016-10-22 20:05:12	+elky	you can't use something like twilight?
2016-10-22 20:06:15	+elky	my phone is basically unusable for me without that. sjogren's syndrome makes for sometimes severe photosensitivity
2016-10-22 20:06:47	Riotela	I have some issue with Twilight that I don't remember and f.lux requires root. I have been using OxygenOS night mode (no idea if it's also in stock Android), but it's not so pleasant to use with it either as opposed to some app with dark theme like Conversations
2016-10-22 20:12:00		[20:06]
2016-10-22 20:20:11	@meskarune	I use redshift and mostly dark themes and stylish to set dark themes on sites I use often

2016-10-27 07:06:00		[07:00]
2016-10-27 07:10:02	Riotela	:( this router has habit of making IPv6 disappear hourly unless rebooted and now I did factory reset and its been working for hours and I am thinking it will be broken by morning as it still works
2016-10-27 07:10:25	ng0	ipv6? more like bloAAAAAAAAAt
2016-10-27 07:10:31	alad	phrik: bloat ipv6
2016-10-27 07:10:31	phrik	ipv6 is bloat
2016-10-27 07:11:15	ng0	ipv6: it's there,  but 90% of ISPs don't support it
2016-10-27 07:12:33	Riotela	When did you last check that number?
2016-10-27 07:13:12	ng0	it feels like no one supports it, 2016
2016-10-27 07:13:25	Peng	<- Hurricane Electric tunnel :(
2016-10-27 07:14:57	Riotela	Finland: DNA supports, Elisa supports it on mobile, Sonera has 6rd so 2/3 networks ISPs have it in some form and 2/3 WISPs have it
2016-10-27 07:17:18	fsckd	my ISP supports it but i have to ask for it. a couple of years ago they made a big hullabaloo in tech news about supporting it. but it is off by default.
2016-10-27 07:19:40	Riotela	That sounds weird, it should be just a matter of enabling it in router/modem

2016-10-28 12:28:11	fsckd	[17:24:44] yes it does sound weird [17:24:44]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	@meskarune	[18:26:28] with comcast I had it if I plugged my computer directly into the modem [18:26:28]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	@meskarune	[18:26:38] but the router didn't support ipv6 routing [18:26:38]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	fsckd	[18:27:07] i have comcast too... hmm... [18:27:07]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	fsckd	[19:02:26] phoo, so glad it's only three [19:02:26]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	ng0	[07:39:54] my twitter account just canceled itself.. didn't exist very long until the one time, throwaway, phonenumber + tor usage got someone to let me check it again [07:39:54]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	ng0	[07:39:56] :D [07:39:56]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	ng0	[07:40:25] well some months, but still not so long when they did not have mandatory phonenumbers [07:40:25]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	ng0	[07:44:28] *not as long as when they did not have [07:44:28]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	ng0	[10:36:25] I'm trapped in a horrible callcenter music loop >.< [10:36:25]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Riotela	[10:49:23] :( [10:49:23]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	ng0	[11:09:22] omg. I just read your nick the first time correct I think.. somehow I swapped the t and l before, Rioleta [11:09:22]

2016-10-28 12:28:12	jy2wong	[14:57:50] tigrmesh: I'm not brave enough for pants yet :) [14:57:50]

2016-10-28 12:28:12	Soni	[19:29:02] I wish ppl were honest that they just don't like bitcoin, instead of coming up with hollow excuses for not supporting it :/ [19:29:02]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	libbies	[19:37:02] well [19:37:02]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	libbies	[19:37:26] without saying about about bitcoin itself, lots of people are looking at using blockchains for stuff [19:37:26]
