2016-09-16 02:26:14	dunz0r	Zelest: W10 and W10 means I can run motherfucking bash
2016-09-16 02:26:25	Zelest	sorry to hear :/
2016-09-16 02:26:35	dunz0r	YoungPython: You can change the screensaver but not modify the "Screen" iirc
2016-09-16 02:26:39	Zelest	does it have retarded shit like sudo as well? :(
2016-09-16 02:27:01	dunz0r	Zelest: Yes, I installed and configured sudo instead of constantly running as root
2016-09-16 02:27:05	dunz0r	Because I'm not hitler

2016-09-16 02:27:59	Zelest	doas(1) - execute commands as another user
2016-09-16 02:28:10	dunz0r	So it's the same as sudo but different?
2016-09-16 02:28:11	Zelest	sudo was inscure.. according to theo ;)
2016-09-16 02:28:20	dunz0r	Ah. Theo <3
2016-09-16 02:28:32	Zelest	nah, but non-supported and unmaintained code
2016-09-16 02:28:41	Zelest	so they rewrote their own implementation to do that
2016-09-16 02:28:49	Zelest	with pledge and privsep and what not
2016-09-16 02:29:00	Zelest	also
2016-09-16 02:29:05	dunz0r	Might replace sudo then, as long as it has the features that I use in sudo.
2016-09-16 02:29:19	dunz0r	Like insults. That's the best feature
2016-09-16 02:29:22	Zelest	"i'm running sudo instead of constantly running as root becuase I'm not hitler"

2016-09-16 07:01:08	du5tball	neuroserpens: what i'm wondering... while the steam-runtime-thingy sets the system libraries before the steam-shipped libs (as far as i know), how'd he manage to get that kinda error?
2016-09-16 07:01:12	du5tball	steam ships that shit!
2016-09-16 07:01:50	neuroserpens	du5tball: i don't even mess with that anymore. i just accept the steam runtime
2016-09-16 07:02:04	neuroserpens	du5tball: and i won't even write the story
2016-09-16 07:02:07	neuroserpens	du5tball: too long
2016-09-16 07:02:22	du5tball	i think i delete some shit from time to time (which was once in the wiki), but if steam runs, i'm happy
2016-09-16 07:03:02	du5tball	i couldn't give less of a shit which libs it uses, as long as it works
2016-09-16 07:03:52	neuroserpens	du5tball: i just hope you don't come to regret deleting anything lol
2016-09-16 07:04:01	neuroserpens	du5tball: steam can be pretty strange at times
2016-09-16 07:04:08	neuroserpens	du5tball: like... almost self bricking strange
2016-09-16 07:04:32	neuroserpens	du5tball: and always... ALWAYS keep your games in a separate folder
2016-09-16 07:04:37	du5tball	neuroserpens: nah and if so, i move the whole steam-folder somewhere else, let steam pull it's stuff again, and merge the two folders
2016-09-16 07:04:53	du5tball	neuroserpens: yeah. move the steam folder to a separate partition and ln -s it
2016-09-16 07:04:56	neuroserpens	du5tball: sometimes even that doesn't work

2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:31:42] sounds good for my little tor-hidden-service-inside-VM setuo [20:31:42]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:31:55] deltasquared: Beware, that's in the edge repository. [20:31:55]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:32:06] Alpine has two settings basically.. a versioned repository setting like 3.4 [20:32:06]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:32:08] or the edge repository [20:32:08]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:32:13] minimalism: is that like unstable? [20:32:13]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:32:15] I see. [20:32:15]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:32:20] hmm [20:32:20]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:32:29] they have stable/versioned, edge, and testing [20:32:29]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:32:57] hmmm [20:32:57]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:32:57] The creator gets paid by docker to just maintain it though now, I believe [20:32:57]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:33:07] lol [20:33:07]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:33:26] I kinda like tor, not really because anonymous anymore (didn't that break?) but because neither side has to port forward or have public IP [20:33:26]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:33:29] why have edge, if you have a testing, though o.o [20:33:29]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mankypirate	[20:33:37] alpine's python packages are all for py2.7 which sucks [20:33:37]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:33:46] because they offer you the choice to used stable versioned if you prefer that [20:33:46]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:33:50] or use something more like arch with edge [20:33:50]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:33:55] as a rolling release [20:33:55]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:33:59] use stable* [20:33:59]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:34:17] hmmm i guess [20:34:17]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:34:38] there iiis a bit of a difference [20:34:38]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	*buffextras	[20:36:12] dandels_!~Dandels@unaffiliated/dandels joined [20:36:12]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:36:15] maybe edge and testing would be the same then? and testing stuff would go to stable after? o.o [20:36:15]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:36:26] nah [20:36:26]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:36:41] I think it's testing to edge, then to a versioned repository for a new release [20:36:41]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:36:44] on a separate subject though, is it widely believed that tor's *anonymity* is compromised? [20:36:44]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:36:54] hmmm [20:36:54]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:37:11] well I wouldn't use it bareback [20:37:11]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:37:20] depends on where you enter and exit afiak [20:37:20]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:37:39] hue [20:37:39]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:38:47] is it still viable from an encryption standpoint though? (ignore leaving exit node or assume hidden service for now) [20:38:47]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:39:06] I uh... may have used it in a starbucks [20:39:06]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:39:10] I think the network is okay, but that issue with whoever controls the exit node is a problem [20:39:10]

2016-09-16 10:44:45	Kirito	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nYdpnkXVY The Gear Fit 2 is pretty sexy but it lacks some basic smart watch functionality
2016-09-16 10:44:51	Kirito	since it's designed more as a fitness tracker
2016-09-16 10:44:57	deltasquared	night mode filter is the shit.
2016-09-16 10:45:00	SolidSaltySwan	possibly. ZNC might have a module for the auth, though, alyptik. It has one for Q (quakenet) and one for SASL
2016-09-16 10:45:09	Kirito	it looks like a smart watch actually SHOULD look though, in my opinion

2016-09-16 11:53:41	DarkFeather	u means upgrade only?
2016-09-16 11:53:49	DarkFeather	Is -Su safe to use?
2016-09-16 11:53:54	eris	It means upgrade, period.
2016-09-16 11:54:05	eris	Sure, but it's pointless without the -y.
2016-09-16 11:54:32	alyptik	it is the pacman NOP
2016-09-16 11:54:56	DarkFeather	Not necessarily -- I'm using Makefiles to install dependencies for some of my code, and so if I want to upgrade deps (and not override packages with a newer version that I've added like yours), -Su is useful.
2016-09-16 11:54:56		[11:54]
2016-09-16 11:55:23	DarkFeather	Because if it's newer on local, it'll get left alone; if it's missing, it'd get installed to mirror latest,and if it's older it'd get updated, right?

2016-09-16 11:55:52	DarkFeather	Because that feels like a deficiency.
2016-09-16 11:56:07	eris	No, just read the damned manpage....

2016-09-16 11:56:35	alyptik	fuck that shit
2016-09-16 11:56:50	eris	Literally the only way that -Su would do anything is if you had done a -Sy without -u.
2016-09-16 11:57:07	eris	Well, also if you manually downgrade a package.
2016-09-16 11:58:27	DarkFeather	Uhhhh, eris? man pacman in the --sysupgrade option section, says that it will do exactly what I said... Might upgrade some other things along the way, but it will install new things and upgrade things that are out of date. It says specifically that -u will upgrade packages only if newer.
2016-09-16 11:59:08	eris	And without a -y what it does is useless.
2016-09-16 11:59:11	DarkFeather	Which is not the acted behavior -_-; So the "if newer" bit in the manpage is a lie. Yay.
