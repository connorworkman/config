2016-09-16 02:26:35	dunz0r	YoungPython: You can change the screensaver but not modify the "Screen" iirc
2016-09-16 02:26:39	Zelest	does it have retarded shit like sudo as well? :(
2016-09-16 02:27:01	dunz0r	Zelest: Yes, I installed and configured sudo instead of constantly running as root
2016-09-16 02:27:05	dunz0r	Because I'm not hitler

2016-09-16 02:27:59	Zelest	doas(1) - execute commands as another user
2016-09-16 02:28:10	dunz0r	So it's the same as sudo but different?
2016-09-16 02:28:11	Zelest	sudo was inscure.. according to theo ;)
2016-09-16 02:28:20	dunz0r	Ah. Theo <3
2016-09-16 02:28:32	Zelest	nah, but non-supported and unmaintained code
2016-09-16 02:28:41	Zelest	so they rewrote their own implementation to do that
2016-09-16 02:28:49	Zelest	with pledge and privsep and what not
2016-09-16 02:29:00	Zelest	also
2016-09-16 02:29:05	dunz0r	Might replace sudo then, as long as it has the features that I use in sudo.
2016-09-16 02:29:19	dunz0r	Like insults. That's the best feature
2016-09-16 02:29:22	Zelest	"i'm running sudo instead of constantly running as root becuase I'm not hitler"

2016-09-16 07:01:50	neuroserpens	du5tball: i don't even mess with that anymore. i just accept the steam runtime
2016-09-16 07:02:04	neuroserpens	du5tball: and i won't even write the story
2016-09-16 07:02:07	neuroserpens	du5tball: too long
2016-09-16 07:02:22	du5tball	i think i delete some shit from time to time (which was once in the wiki), but if steam runs, i'm happy
2016-09-16 07:03:02	du5tball	i couldn't give less of a shit which libs it uses, as long as it works
2016-09-16 07:03:52	neuroserpens	du5tball: i just hope you don't come to regret deleting anything lol
2016-09-16 07:04:01	neuroserpens	du5tball: steam can be pretty strange at times
2016-09-16 07:04:08	neuroserpens	du5tball: like... almost self bricking strange
2016-09-16 07:04:32	neuroserpens	du5tball: and always... ALWAYS keep your games in a separate folder
2016-09-16 07:04:37	du5tball	neuroserpens: nah and if so, i move the whole steam-folder somewhere else, let steam pull it's stuff again, and merge the two folders
2016-09-16 07:04:53	du5tball	neuroserpens: yeah. move the steam folder to a separate partition and ln -s it
2016-09-16 07:04:56	neuroserpens	du5tball: sometimes even that doesn't work

2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:31:42] sounds good for my little tor-hidden-service-inside-VM setuo [20:31:42]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:31:55] deltasquared: Beware, that's in the edge repository. [20:31:55]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:32:06] Alpine has two settings basically.. a versioned repository setting like 3.4 [20:32:06]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:32:08] or the edge repository [20:32:08]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:32:13] minimalism: is that like unstable? [20:32:13]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:32:15] I see. [20:32:15]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:32:20] hmm [20:32:20]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:32:29] they have stable/versioned, edge, and testing [20:32:29]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:32:57] hmmm [20:32:57]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:32:57] The creator gets paid by docker to just maintain it though now, I believe [20:32:57]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:33:07] lol [20:33:07]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:33:26] I kinda like tor, not really because anonymous anymore (didn't that break?) but because neither side has to port forward or have public IP [20:33:26]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:33:29] why have edge, if you have a testing, though o.o [20:33:29]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mankypirate	[20:33:37] alpine's python packages are all for py2.7 which sucks [20:33:37]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:33:46] because they offer you the choice to used stable versioned if you prefer that [20:33:46]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:33:50] or use something more like arch with edge [20:33:50]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:33:55] as a rolling release [20:33:55]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:33:59] use stable* [20:33:59]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:34:17] hmmm i guess [20:34:17]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:34:38] there iiis a bit of a difference [20:34:38]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	*buffextras	[20:36:12] dandels_!~Dandels@unaffiliated/dandels joined [20:36:12]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:36:15] maybe edge and testing would be the same then? and testing stuff would go to stable after? o.o [20:36:15]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:36:26] nah [20:36:26]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:36:41] I think it's testing to edge, then to a versioned repository for a new release [20:36:41]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:36:44] on a separate subject though, is it widely believed that tor's *anonymity* is compromised? [20:36:44]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:36:54] hmmm [20:36:54]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:37:11] well I wouldn't use it bareback [20:37:11]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:37:20] depends on where you enter and exit afiak [20:37:20]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:37:39] hue [20:37:39]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:38:47] is it still viable from an encryption standpoint though? (ignore leaving exit node or assume hidden service for now) [20:38:47]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:39:06] I uh... may have used it in a starbucks [20:39:06]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:39:10] I think the network is okay, but that issue with whoever controls the exit node is a problem [20:39:10]

2016-09-16 10:44:45	Kirito	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nYdpnkXVY The Gear Fit 2 is pretty sexy but it lacks some basic smart watch functionality
2016-09-16 10:44:51	Kirito	since it's designed more as a fitness tracker
2016-09-16 10:44:57	deltasquared	night mode filter is the shit.
2016-09-16 10:45:00	SolidSaltySwan	possibly. ZNC might have a module for the auth, though, alyptik. It has one for Q (quakenet) and one for SASL
2016-09-16 10:45:09	Kirito	it looks like a smart watch actually SHOULD look though, in my opinion

2016-09-16 11:53:41	DarkFeather	u means upgrade only?
2016-09-16 11:53:49	DarkFeather	Is -Su safe to use?
2016-09-16 11:53:54	eris	It means upgrade, period.
2016-09-16 11:54:05	eris	Sure, but it's pointless without the -y.
2016-09-16 11:54:32	alyptik	it is the pacman NOP
2016-09-16 11:54:56	DarkFeather	Not necessarily -- I'm using Makefiles to install dependencies for some of my code, and so if I want to upgrade deps (and not override packages with a newer version that I've added like yours), -Su is useful.
2016-09-16 11:54:56		[11:54]
2016-09-16 11:55:23	DarkFeather	Because if it's newer on local, it'll get left alone; if it's missing, it'd get installed to mirror latest,and if it's older it'd get updated, right?

2016-09-16 11:55:52	DarkFeather	Because that feels like a deficiency.
2016-09-16 11:56:07	eris	No, just read the damned manpage....

2016-09-16 11:56:35	alyptik	fuck that shit
2016-09-16 11:56:50	eris	Literally the only way that -Su would do anything is if you had done a -Sy without -u.
2016-09-16 11:57:07	eris	Well, also if you manually downgrade a package.
2016-09-16 11:58:27	DarkFeather	Uhhhh, eris? man pacman in the --sysupgrade option section, says that it will do exactly what I said... Might upgrade some other things along the way, but it will install new things and upgrade things that are out of date. It says specifically that -u will upgrade packages only if newer.
2016-09-16 11:59:08	eris	And without a -y what it does is useless.
2016-09-16 11:59:11	DarkFeather	Which is not the acted behavior -_-; So the "if newer" bit in the manpage is a lie. Yay.

2016-09-17 00:35:16	dunz0r	phillid: It improves the read speed.
2016-09-17 00:35:24	phillid	RAID0 is just I PAID FOR ALL THIS SPACE, MAKE IT LOOK CONTINOUS
2016-09-17 00:35:27	phillid	dunz0r, cool
2016-09-17 00:35:29	alyptik	lol
2016-09-17 00:35:38	dunz0r	'RAID 0 (also known as a stripe set or striped volume) splits ("stripes") data evenly across two or more disks, without parity information, redundancy, or fault tolerance. '
2016-09-17 00:35:43	dunz0r	If one drive fails, all data is lost
2016-09-17 00:36:14	phillid	I might need to rethink my storage
2016-09-17 00:36:16	dunz0r	RAID0 is faster than a single drive though.
2016-09-17 00:36:18	alyptik	i wonder why flac only goes to 8 instead of 10
2016-09-17 00:36:23	alyptik	fuckers thinking in octal
2016-09-17 00:36:48	dunz0r	phillid: Go for "prosumer"-disks. Like WD Red NAS or something. It'll help you sleep better :)
2016-09-17 00:36:54	phillid	Yeah
2016-09-17 00:37:31	phillid	I want an SSD for / and then I just want a huge "cum dumpster" for storage which I can mount to /mnt/something
2016-09-17 00:37:42	phillid	But I don't wanna fork out for RAID on the SSD
2016-09-17 00:37:52	phillid	I guess / shouldn't hold precious stuff anyway
2016-09-17 00:38:02	phillid	Except config, but that can be backed up
2016-09-17 00:38:27	phillid	Oh and /home and pacman cache would be on the magnetic
2016-09-17 00:38:32	phillid	All the non-perfomant stuff
2016-09-17 00:39:02	phillid	I suppose I could rethink the size of my SSD
2016-09-17 00:39:15	dunz0r	phillid: If you're just going to keep / on it, it can be pretty small
2016-09-17 00:39:23	phillid	240GB might be too much if I have magnetic mounted all over the filesystem
2016-09-17 00:39:27	alyptik	am i the only who uses /store?

2016-09-17 01:59:24	mar77i	grawity: ah, it's been added to it in some cases
2016-09-17 01:59:38	Zelest	Boohbah, seeing llvm is in base soon, I assume/hope they migrate towards it
2016-09-17 01:59:52	dunz0r	llvm is pretty sweet though.

2016-09-17 02:04:13	dunz0r	And mount was called something silly instead of mount.
2016-09-17 02:04:18	Zelest	no idea about mount though

2016-09-17 11:11:09	cra1g321	mm. arch seems to be the only distro ive checked so far that has fixed/resolved the recent php CVE's simply because it stays up to date, debian is vulnerble, ubuntu LTS has no update, suse, RH have no cve pages

2016-09-17 11:27:18	sudokode	also, it's much easier for arch to fix something like this than an LTS distro
2016-09-17 11:27:29	minimalism	Should drop PHP from the repositories is what you should do. Do some of that reactionary/boycotting whatever, except it'll actually have meaning instead of complaining about how Starbucks pissed you off.

2016-09-17 11:27:43	MrElendig	that doesn't say that RH closed it with "wontfix"
2016-09-17 11:27:47	sudokode	but LTS distros need to get it fixed because they're basically the web
2016-09-17 11:27:58	cra1g321	just surprised gentoo, suse, RH dont have any pages for it, and debian has no indication of fixing them

2016-09-17 22:38:07	deltasquared	I'm just wondering whether it would be worth encrypting the entire disk, or better still that AND a second layer for this particular partition
2016-09-17 22:38:10	serialoverflow	Boohbah: that is the old way, yes. but as far as i know, you can use a lightning cable directly to connect your apple earpods with the iphone 7 via lightning port
2016-09-17 22:38:13	Boohbah	alyptik: yakuake?
2016-09-17 22:38:23	serialoverflow	Boohbah: and in that case, where is the conversion to analogue?
2016-09-17 22:38:24	deltasquared	this volume will be holding "secret" data as it were, keys and the like

2016-09-17 22:40:42	deltasquared	I would have thought a pair of headphones connected via thunderbolt (which AFAIK apple wants to be their USB as it were) would present an audio device.
2016-09-17 22:41:04	deltasquared	as for where, well, apple magic? :P they seem to be pretty good at squeezing stuff in
2016-09-17 22:41:08	serialoverflow	Boohbah: i think it has to be in the headphones because the lightning cable can only transmit digital data

2016-09-18 02:54:21	mkoskar	e.g., only recently there was a change that the owner has strict liability for his/her car, so if there is photo of the car going over speed limit and it's not clear who is driving, owner is liable ... it wasn't the case till recently here, so if they haven't your face on picture, you could say "it wasn't me", they ask "who it was", you say "I refuse to say, because I could inflict on member of my

By contrast VP9 is open source and royalty free. It was developed by Google as a successor to VP8, the moderately successful alternative to H.264.

2016-09-18 15:06:47	phillid	I should find a clock to compare against that is equivalent of wall clock, but without skews
2016-09-18 15:07:33	phillid	So my multicore efficiency for this program is calculated by taking the total wall clock time of the job, and comparing that against the total of time each thread ran, in parallel
2016-09-18 15:07:55	phillid	So if 8 cores took 100s in parallel, you get 100s wall clock and 800s taken

2016-09-18 15:08:13	phillid	Assuming 100% efficiency
2016-09-18 15:08:29	phillid	Otherwise, you might have 100% wall and like 900s taken

2016-09-18 19:20:54	Kirito	For DAC playback
2016-09-18 19:21:08	Kirito	PulseAudio always molests audio in some manner no matter what
2016-09-18 19:21:14	Kirito	Even if you tell it to use S/PDIF
2016-09-18 19:21:17	Kirito	it will molest your audio
2016-09-18 19:21:35	Kirito	tl;dr pulseaudio is too stupid to use DAC's correctly
2016-09-18 19:23:41	Kirito	I actually never even realized this until one day I discovered that music from my Android device somehow sounded significantly better with my DAC than when streaming via my laptop, which made no sense
2016-09-18 19:23:51	Kirito	Then eventually figured out pulse was to blame for that
2016-09-18 19:24:51	Boohbah	That doesn't make sense.
2016-09-18 19:27:07	Kirito	What part doesn't?
2016-09-18 19:30:46	Boohbah	That pulseaudio is too stupid to use DACs correctly.
2016-09-18 19:31:35	Kirito	Why dosn't that make sense? You know what a DAC is right? And what Pulseaudio is for?
2016-09-18 19:31:45	Boohbah	It works for me.
2016-09-18 19:32:00	phillid	Aren't all soundcards dacs?
2016-09-18 19:32:08	Boohbah	Yeah.
2016-09-18 19:32:11	Kirito	Do you even have a DAC?
2016-09-18 19:32:25	phillid	I have several, if it stand fro Digital to Analogue convertor
2016-09-18 19:32:35	Boohbah	I have an USB sound card with 2 in, 2 out.
2016-09-18 19:32:45	Boohbah	It has two DACs and two ADCs.
2016-09-18 19:32:48	phillid	Yes
2016-09-18 19:32:50	Kirito	phillid, Yes, but you call soundcards soundcards and DAC's DAC's for a reason, it's marketing terminology
2016-09-18 19:33:02	phillid	Kirito, I don't
2016-09-18 19:33:13	Kirito	Boohbah, Yes, it "works", I never said it doesn't work, but it doesn't work as it should
2016-09-18 19:33:16	phillid	I have never heard of such a distinction
2016-09-18 19:33:20	Boohbah	It works fine.
2016-09-18 19:33:23	phillid	Are DACs different?
2016-09-18 19:33:29	Kirito	You're wrong but okay.
2016-09-18 19:33:48	Kirito	When using pulseaudio it will not send digital audio directly to the external DAC as it is supposed to
2016-09-18 19:34:04	minimalism	I'm adjusting to pure ALSA since gentoo
2016-09-18 19:34:10	minimalism	just have to add a softvol increase to go above 100%
2016-09-18 19:34:12	Kirito	Try playing back a decent uncompressed audio file with pulseaudio, then stream it directly to your DLC with alsa and compare the two
2016-09-18 19:34:20	Boohbah	What the hell is getting transmitted through my USB cable then?
2016-09-18 19:34:29	phillid	Boohbah, ghosts
2016-09-18 19:34:30	Kirito	molested audio, as I said
2016-09-18 19:34:53	Kirito	It's better than audio from your laptops soundcard for sure, but nowhere near as good as it could be
2016-09-18 19:34:54	Boohbah	That doesn't make sense, as I said.
2016-09-18 19:35:03	Kirito	It doesn't make sense because you can't understand it then
2016-09-18 19:35:16	phillid	Enlighten us
2016-09-18 19:35:16		[19:35]
2016-09-18 19:35:17	Boohbah	It is still digital audio. Do you mean it is downsampling it?
2016-09-18 19:35:34	Boohbah	Setup the right bit depth and sample rate.
2016-09-18 19:35:46	phillid	Just get vinyls bro
2016-09-18 19:35:53	Boohbah	Heh.
2016-09-18 19:36:09	minimalism	the real solution is pacman -Rns pulseaudio
2016-09-18 19:36:11	Kirito	I already did explain it above, not my problem if you're too incompetent to understand it
2016-09-18 19:36:57	Boohbah	Vinyls are cool and I have them, but I wouldn't call them "high fidelity".

2016-09-18 19:54:21	eto	anyway speaking of multiple sound cards - here is the tricky question - if you have multiple one after some time, they desync, how do you keep them ticking same?
2016-09-18 19:54:47	minimalism	My only issue with alsa from what I can see is that if you use an .asoundrc, it ignores the default alsa.conf, and it doesn't just add or override.
2016-09-18 19:55:05	eto	i saw some mods on net for old cards that you can wire up to sue same clocks, is there something modern you can sync together electrically and does it work over usb?

2016-09-18 20:14:57	mpan	eto: cheap, chinese 32.767kHz oscillators have error in range of hundreds of milliseconds per month. What error do you expect in a decent hardware during 10 minutes?
2016-09-18 20:14:57	Kirito	but the documentation says it's not well supported in most applications so I never bothered with it
2016-09-18 20:14:59	Kirito	Yeah, dmix
2016-09-18 20:15:00	alyptik	should be default nowadays

2016-09-18 20:16:12	eto	mpan: well i plan to mess with this one day - i for example read xruns can be serious problem under heavy load (eg when syntehtizer is maxing cpus so much they cannot deliver samples to cards in time)
2016-09-18 20:16:17	mpan	alyptik: but this is a different issue. You need to reset timers on under-/overrun, not just keep them in sync.
2016-09-18 20:16:54	Kirito	One thing I noticed recently
2016-09-18 20:17:16	alyptik	how do you know where to start up again? the rest of the audio keeps chugging along
2016-09-18 20:17:35	alyptik	if you never care about cracks/pops cool, but for most it's a big deal 
2016-09-18 20:17:40	Kirito	Is there's a large disparity between speexrate_medium and speexrate_best
2016-09-18 20:17:48	eto	also pci commands will arrive with some skew to devices i believe
2016-09-18 20:18:00	Kirito	Maybe there really isn't much of a difference between the two, but
2016-09-18 20:18:23	Kirito	speexrate_medium is basically a quality level of 5, while speexrate_best is 9 (or 10? I can't remember which, I think 9)
2016-09-18 20:18:36	eto	so syncing the cards, should make them "move" samle pointer at same time, no mpan ?
2016-09-18 20:18:41	eto	sample
2016-09-18 20:19:04	alyptik	muh speex
2016-09-18 20:19:14	mpan	Yes, indeed. But this doesn’t require their clocks to be nearly¹ perfectly synced (perfect syncing is physically impossible).
2016-09-18 20:19:15	Kirito	Seems like you should be able to drop the quality level down 1 or 2 and possibly significantly reduce CPU overhead while still improving quality, but I haven't actually bothered to try and compare the two

2016-09-18 20:19:49	alyptik	mpan: also "As a result, when using two cards at once one can have a real sample rate of 44.099 kHz in one card and a samplerate of 44.101 kHz in the other. This is no problem when recording with one card only, but the difference in the sample rates will cause phase shifts in the recording when using two cards. Phase shifts make the high frequencies of the recording e.g. cymbals sound bad.
2016-09-18 20:19:49	alyptik	Further, not all audio drivers can drive cards that are not in exact samplerate sync."

2016-09-18 20:23:18	mpan	alyptik: ±0.001kHz error in 10 minutes playback is few milliseconds. Even the best musicians can’t sync on so small scale and no one is able to hear that. The only case I would see this to be a problem, if one records stereo track with each channel going through a different card. Then indeed things would be totally messed up. But which sane person would do that?

2016-09-19 02:52:00	mpan	Well… machete is just a tool. Nothing suspicious in buying it. It’s just like one would buy an axe. I doubt anyone checks your ID when you buy an axe. The fact that hooligans are using it for fights is a different story.

2016-09-19 02:53:03	tetero	mpan: Technically sure, but the thing is that a machete is a tool for cutting in tropical climates and Poland isn't really that tropical :D

2016-09-19 13:03:23	phrik	BKC: In kinematics, absement is a measure of sustained displacement of an object from its initial position, i.e. a measure of how far away and for how long. Absement changes as an object remains displaced and stays constant as the object resides at the initial position. It is the first time-integral of the displacement, so the displacement is the rate of change of the absement. The (1 more message)

2016-09-19 13:03:54	phrik	BKC: dimension of absement is length multiplied by time. Its SI unit is meter second, which corresponds to an object having been displaced by 1 meter for 1 second. This is not to be confused with a meter per second, a unit of velocity, the time-derivative of position. (Wikipedia)

2016-09-19 19:09:46	Kirito	I still can't understand why alsa thinks it is justified in resampling my audio even when I'm telling it not to
2016-09-19 19:09:46	numero	Hi.
2016-09-19 19:10:27	alyptik	Default Sample Specification: s16le 2ch 44100Hz
2016-09-19 19:10:33	alyptik	happens to me too it seems
2016-09-19 19:10:50	Kirito	it seems to be dmix, even though I don't have it explicitly enabled
2016-09-19 19:10:56	Kirito	it just enabled it anyways, even though I don't want it
2016-09-19 19:11:22	alyptik	jack never resamples me thank god
2016-09-19 19:11:43	alyptik	then i guess it would be pointless to use if it did
2016-09-19 19:13:05	Kirito	Software that thinks it knows what you want better than you do is insanely annoying
2016-09-19 19:13:05		[19:13]
2016-09-19 19:13:41	alyptik	unless it does
2016-09-19 19:13:43	alyptik	like gcc
2016-09-19 19:14:52	Kirito	Linux manages to make achieving bit perfect audio sensationally difficult
2016-09-19 19:15:16	Kirito	You can nuke pulseaudio completely and you still have to wage war against alsa to prevent resampling
2016-09-19 19:15:34	alyptik	Kirito: easy solution: jack2-dbus
2016-09-19 19:15:48	Kirito	I'll look into jack >_>

2016-09-19 19:16:55	Kirito	http://audiokarma.org/forums/index.php?threads/stop-resampling-under-linux.575308/ lol get fucked
2016-09-19 19:17:36	Kirito	Apparently that's the only way to accomplish this, you have to jump through 4 different hoops to trick Alsa into doing what you want
2016-09-19 19:18:06	alyptik	or set sample rate with qjackctl
2016-09-19 19:18:07	alyptik	ez
2016-09-19 19:18:08	Kirito	By using a fake plugin to override dmix
2016-09-19 19:18:10	mnrmnaugh	alsa is pretty gunky imo
2016-09-19 19:19:54	Kirito	I've never used jack before and am largely unfamiliar with it. I have no doubt it will probably make my life worlds easier though >_>

2016-09-20 05:00:19	voidead	mnrmnaugh› so I found out that if you have a fallback symbol font (such as Symbola for example) your fallback font has to be configured to display at a smaller size than your main font or else it won't show up

2016-09-20 05:06:04	mnrmnaugh	the first one reminds me of whatever rediculous font i have... i see horrid blockiness in hexchat all dae
2016-09-20 05:06:17	voidead	ST has a similar setup as urxvt.. but works better.. you'll never see blocks but you'll just see something like "    " where the symbol should be
2016-09-20 05:06:24	mkoskar	it's urxvt limitation, I think it's documented somewhere and I was reading it (maybe man 7 urxvt) ... it has it's own strict box model
2016-09-20 05:06:47	mnrmnaugh	so, maybe its not actually using the font you told it?
2016-09-20 05:07:05	voidead	mnrmnaugh› well st has changed its setting to use fallback fonts too

2016-09-20 21:48:11	Kirito	Want to encrypt your phone and require a password to decrypt it on boot? You have to use the stock lock screen. No exceptions. Doesn't matter if you want to have a lock screen after you unlock the device or not

2016-09-20 21:50:03	Kirito	I'm sure there's a way to get around that with root but I haven't looked. The only reason I haven't rooted my phone yet is because it will disable access to Samsung Pay :/

2016-09-21 01:05:49	dunz0r	I've been considering getting a car just to have something more to tinker with. But I think I'll get a motorcycle instead :>
2016-09-21 01:06:08	minimalism	That's the only reason I even think about cars being interesting. Playing with it like a computer.

2016-09-21 14:29:15	phillid	check out the zipman option in makepkg.conf, which is enabled by default
2016-09-21 14:29:22	alyptik	ahh
2016-09-21 14:29:49	phillid	It also means that if someone doesn't want their manpages compressed, they won't have to patch the PKGBUILD

2016-09-22 01:12:39	mkoskar	phillid: i.e., you want to have "having near death experience" there?
2016-09-22 01:13:17	phillid	Yeah
2016-09-22 01:13:26	phillid	One of those ones where your heart stops and they revive you

2016-09-22 01:13:47	dunz0r	Then it's actual death
2016-09-22 01:14:01	dunz0r	Your brain is dead that time. 
2016-09-22 01:14:03	phillid	well they did say "death" on bucket list
2016-09-22 01:14:06	phillid	So
2016-09-22 01:14:08	phillid	That works \o/
2016-09-22 01:14:17	MK_FG	I'd say it's not even near-death if you know you'll be revived
2016-09-22 01:14:29	phillid	We need more directly-English-derived words in English
2016-09-22 01:14:39	phillid	revive should just be relife
2016-09-22 01:14:43	phillid	Or relive
2016-09-22 01:15:00	MK_FG	Relive sounds agonizing
2016-09-22 01:15:04	dunz0r	Or just not die at all. 
2016-09-22 01:15:21	dunz0r	I'd love to live forever. Imagine all the cool shit you'd get to experience.
2016-09-22 01:15:23	phillid	I think perhaps the most pretentious thing to put on your bucket list is "live"
2016-09-22 01:16:22	MK_FG	dunz0r, And all the worst stuff to balance it out
2016-09-22 01:16:47	phillid	Let's be honest, this universe is full of infinitely more bad things than good
2016-09-22 01:17:15	MK_FG	Unless you wear pink glasses
2016-09-22 01:17:19	MrElendig	the universe is neutral
2016-09-22 01:17:28	phillid	So to live is to seek those good things out while numbing the bad shit out
2016-09-22 01:17:29	MrElendig	good and bad are human constructs
2016-09-22 01:17:48	MK_FG	You can't numb only bad, you numb good as well
2016-09-22 01:17:57	phillid	True
2016-09-22 01:17:58	dunz0r	phillid: Assuming that anything is "good" or "bad"
2016-09-22 01:18:30	MK_FG	MrElendig, There're atoms of good and atoms of bad, you know nothing

2016-09-22 01:19:14	phillid	jelle, wow
2016-09-22 01:19:17	MrElendig	we should rewrite openssl in erlang
2016-09-22 01:19:28	dunz0r	MK_FG: Not atoms, silly. It's particles. Goodotrons, badotrons and uglotrons.
2016-09-22 01:19:37	dunz0r	And they make up atoms.
2016-09-22 01:20:00	dunz0r	Like, uranium's pretty bad, but really cool, so it's 3 goodtrons and one badotron.
2016-09-22 01:20:06	MK_FG	Reminds me of terry pratchett
2016-09-22 01:20:07	dunz0r	And no uglotrons
2016-09-22 01:20:29	dunz0r	Because uranium looks pretty cool
2016-09-22 01:20:33	jelle	hmm reminds me of a radiation meater I found at our hackerspace

2016-09-22 01:21:03	jelle	phillid: well you wear something around your arm, put it in the machine, detects if your going to die or not
2016-09-22 01:21:15	jelle	well radiation level ofc.

2016-09-22 01:21:25	dunz0r	phillid: It tells you how much radiation there is by cooking meat to a certain temperature
2016-09-22 01:21:28	MK_FG	It's called Death Clock
2016-09-22 01:21:32	phillid	Else it "meats" radiation

2016-09-22 02:16:03	eris	CaptainCrunch: If there's a reason for you to have an AUR account it's very likely that you maintain a package, and if you have taken that responsibility, there should be a public way to contact you.
2016-09-22 02:16:55	eris	CaptainCrunch: And either way, the checkbox about hiding the email is both on the account registration page and the my\ account page.
2016-09-22 02:18:14	CaptainCrunch	eris, both true. My point is a) it's show by default b) i'M not informed about it

2016-09-22 20:52:19	Kirito	The difference in font clarity between 1080p and 3k on a 15" screen is enormous

2016-09-22 20:52:53	Tear	but i have to say i'm excited for the age of hidpi, not because of the display quality but because individual pixels are going to become an implementation detail that end users don't even have to know about
2016-09-22 20:52:55	Sapphirus	I'll deal with a 1080P 23.8" monitor til then

2016-09-22 20:54:16	Sapphirus	1080P at 23-24" will be fine
2016-09-22 20:54:32	Kirito	Sure, a lot of things will be "fine"

2016-09-22 20:54:56	Kirito	You could do "fine" with an old CRT monitor
2016-09-22 20:55:38	Sapphirus	I feel as if 1440p will be the new 720p when 4k becomes standard.
2016-09-22 20:55:42	SysGhost	Oh... those electron cannons with a photon converter grill infront?
2016-09-22 20:55:52	Kirito	Just like you could do "fine" driving a Prius
2016-09-22 20:56:10	Sapphirus	Hence, the reason, I'll wait until I could get a high dpi 24" monitor in my favourite form factor.

2016-09-22 21:07:37	Sapphirus	Also, at such high resolutions, you don't necessarily need high amounts of anti aliasing anymore
2016-09-22 21:07:45	Sapphirus	So that also reduces the load on the gpu
2016-09-22 21:08:01	jelle	NextHendrix: LOL
2016-09-22 21:08:02	Tear	yeah, antialiasing is just a workaround for low spatial resolution

2016-09-22 23:48:39	Sapphirus	but no, that'll never happen, because your elected representatives love money

2016-09-23 00:27:01	vin	iamawesome: the problem is, everyone has a different idea. You probably have too. So install what seems cool. If you put in some reading effort you can do it all
2016-09-23 00:27:09	vin	and if not, ask questions on irc

2016-09-23 00:28:09	minimalism	iamawesome: When all the apt-get commands make you want to cut yourself, take your drive outside, smash it with a hammer, and burn it. Then you can install arch on a clean one.
2016-09-23 00:29:07	iamawesome	Some people say that archlinux has latest packages, so the system breaks often or there are more bugs with latest packages, then you have to fix the system or pacman manually, so it doesn't work as a stable linux, is it true?

2016-09-23 02:23:58	iamawesome	jelle: Why are you dying?
2016-09-23 02:24:05	chee	jelle: no but i am considering that
2016-09-23 02:24:09	jelle	iamawesome: the bugs are killing me
2016-09-23 02:24:12	jelle	chee: we use nwjs
2016-09-23 02:24:25	jelle	chee: it's prolly much more awful then electron, but the "architect" thought I'd be great
2016-09-23 02:24:26	voidead	but generally speaking.. especially for a desktop.. its hard on the hardware during startup as that is when the most power consumption is.. letting the RAM fill up can be helpful for the performance
2016-09-23 02:24:36	iamawesome	jelle: Bugs of which package?
2016-09-23 02:24:43	jelle	chee: nwjs == some single guy in a basement, electron => loads of people :p
2016-09-23 02:25:05	iamawesome	jelle: Are you on archlinux or debian? I saw you on #debian.
2016-09-23 02:25:16	jelle	iamawesome: no, that is my evil nephew
2016-09-23 02:26:13	iamawesome	jelle: What does that mean?

2016-09-23 02:27:53	chee	this would be better with electron probably
2016-09-23 02:28:11	chee	at the moment we are trying to use cordova but that is a living nightmare and it means i have to use windows to debug problems
2016-09-23 02:28:27	chee	instead of just being able to do everything on this computer

2016-09-23 14:57:23	sudokode	minimalism: I think those two things are slightly counterintuitive
2016-09-23 14:57:44	sudokode	you already have to get permission from the SEC to merge public companies
2016-09-23 14:57:52	sudokode	you even have to get permission to sell shares of your own company
2016-09-23 14:58:28	sudokode	it's not like this isn't regulated.. but there is a lot of hidden data that doesn't go away. it just gets bigger and more unwieldy until someone leaks it
2016-09-23 14:58:55	minimalism	the SEC and the DOJ have proven useless
2016-09-23 14:59:12	minimalism	they're allowing these giant conglomerates to buy each other out, but they block anyone who isn't paying them off

2016-09-23 15:00:13	minimalism	I still firmly believe we need strict laws for companies to destroy all data on a customer after a short period of time
2016-09-23 15:00:30	sudokode	data is tricky

2016-09-23 15:01:23	sudokode	it might be more worthwhile to regulate proper data security

2016-09-23 15:02:29	minimalism	You can force them to just not keep it.

2016-09-23 15:03:18	sudokode	but you can't really trust it to be kept private. even if they attempt to do that

2016-09-23 15:57:19	kbdkode	what
2016-09-23 15:57:52	alyptik	how do you view a diff between current HEAD and stash of a single file?
2016-09-23 15:58:00	alyptik	is that even doable
2016-09-23 15:58:08	kbdkode	git diff --cached something?
2016-09-23 15:58:23	alyptik	nope :/
2016-09-23 15:58:37	kbdkode	and by something I mean something other than the name of the file
2016-09-23 15:58:41	kbdkode	but pretty sure it's doable
2016-09-23 15:58:54	alyptik	oh ok, but not what is that something hah

2016-09-23 15:59:46	alyptik	i am prob not finding anything in google because my terminology is wrong
2016-09-23 16:01:01	kbdkode	well git diff HEAD filename will show you diff of head to prev commit I believv
2016-09-23 16:01:23	kbdkode	and git diff --cached HEAD filename
2016-09-23 16:01:27	kbdkode	might be what you want

2016-09-23 16:02:48	kbdkode	nvm applause not a verb lol
2016-09-23 16:02:53	alyptik	applause is a noun that's why heh

2016-09-23 16:03:31	kbdkode	strange verb. to applaud (v): to show enjoyment or approval of something such as a performance or speech by clapping the hands repeatedly to make a noise
2016-09-23 16:03:51	alyptik	i think it's from the words lauds
2016-09-23 16:03:56	alyptik	like laudable
2016-09-23 16:04:16	kbdkode	if you think about it ... clapping/applauding is really fucking weird. You smack your hands together (thereby disrupting someone's speech or act) in order to show your approval.

2016-09-24 00:33:55	taskene	[10:04:54] There's only one kind of bourbon. [10:04:54]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	taskene	[10:05:27] And it's whiskey. With an e. [10:05:27]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	voidead	[10:05:30] taskene› a tragedy [10:05:30]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	voidead	[10:05:39] poor Bourbon :( [10:05:39]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	parchd	[10:06:42] taskene: I'm never sure about the spelling when it comes to American styles - always just remembered it as whisky for Scotch and whiskey for Irish Whiskey [10:06:42]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	voidead	[10:07:08] I like Crown Royal myself [10:07:08]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	voidead	[10:07:15] but Bourbon is awesome as well [10:07:15]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	taskene	[10:07:19] That's why it's just usually bourbon, to limit the misunderstandings. [10:07:19]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	parchd	[10:07:51] taskene: but then there are bigger misunderstandings, regarding the biscuits [10:07:51]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	parchd	[10:08:10] Can you imagine, if you went to a bar and ordered "Bourbon", and the barman got it wrong [10:08:10]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	parchd	[10:08:13] ? [10:08:13]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	voidead	[10:08:21] uh no [10:08:21]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	voidead	[10:08:22] I can't [10:08:22]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	voidead	[10:08:25] because if he did [10:08:25]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	voidead	[10:08:28] he should be fired [10:08:28]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	parchd	[10:08:30] Like, if you were really hungry and desperate for a biscuit, and he brought you a drink? [10:08:30]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	voidead	[10:08:30] fucking moron [10:08:30]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	NextHendrix	[10:08:36] id be happy with the biscuits [10:08:36]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	taskene	[10:09:36] I'd ask for a biscuit if I wanted a biscuit. Because I'm a normal person. [10:09:36]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	parchd	[10:10:34] taskene: but if you just say "I'd like a biscuit please", you might not get the kind you want. You might get digestive instead of bourbon [10:10:34]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	parchd	[10:10:51] If you were lucky, though, you'd at the least get a custard cream [10:10:51]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	parchd	[10:11:06] certainly at a respectible biscuit-serving establishment [10:11:06]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	voidead	[10:11:14] only morons go to a bar just to order a biscuit [10:11:14]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	taskene	[10:11:29] Then I would specify the type of biscuit. And hobnob every damn time. [10:11:29]
2016-09-24 00:33:55	minimalism	[10:11:41] You Americans wouldn't happen to have a spare Trump, would you? I just saw a post of an American actually moving to Canada, and now I'm getting a bit worried without a wall being up. [10:11:41]

2016-09-24 00:33:55	minimalism	[10:13:26] We will need Farage on loan in advance though. [10:13:26]

2016-09-24 00:33:55	taskene	[10:17:05] voidead: Okay, so the US is the British East India Company. Same difference. [10:17:05]

2016-09-24 19:28:47	minimalism	So I guess there must be some point where they're willing to try it, and they devolve into nutjobs.

2016-09-25 06:54:06	prg318	you mean if the whole team quits at the same time? because if someone quits and gets an abandon the rest of the team can quit for a loss once the first player gets their abandon

2016-09-25 07:07:58	th0rne	Like, I don't mind playing even if two racks down and things looking pretty grim if the opposing team is at least remotely on the same level, but sometimes you're in a situation where at the 10 min mark your entirely team has a grand total of 20 last hits because you've only played 50 games and the guys on the other team have played 3,000.

2016-09-25 07:09:52	prg318	if you just stand around you'll get an abandon (no XP for 5 minutes == abandon AFAIK - but like i said i havne't really played in a while - this could have changed)
2016-09-25 07:10:24	prg318	i wonder if the new consumable XP item resets abandon timer when you use it (forget what its called)
2016-09-25 07:11:07	prg318	there's also scrub-tier games where the other team will prolong the game because they're actually winning so they want to enjoy it while it lasts

2016-09-25 22:28:41	phillid	Because their architecture sucks compared to intel's so they need to crank up the voltage and frequency to compete
2016-09-25 22:28:57	phillid	But intel's so expensive

2016-09-26 02:01:40	sammyf	dunz0r: the more interesting question is : what kidn of sensors are you planning to use
2016-09-26 02:01:43	sammyf	?
2016-09-26 02:02:23	dunz0r	sammyf: Combination of cheap ultrasound-sensors, IR-sensors from Sharp and plain old bump sensors in case the sonar/IR isn't enough.
2016-09-26 02:02:59	jelle	:D
2016-09-26 02:03:19	jelle	hmm multiprocessing how did it werk
2016-09-26 02:03:20	dunz0r	sammyf: Can't remember what the sonar-sensors are called, but I have like 10 of them.
2016-09-26 02:04:06	dunz0r	Probably 5x2 sensors at the front, mounted in a half circle
2016-09-26 02:04:17	dunz0r	Possibly some side mounted ones just in case as well
2016-09-26 02:04:52	dunz0r	Then the RPI will do gps-coordinates and give the arduino a heading.
2016-09-26 02:05:33	sammyf	ahh ... GPS through the rpi. I missed that bit :)
2016-09-26 02:05:42	sammyf	sounds like a plan! :)
2016-09-26 02:05:48	dunz0r	(the reason for using an arduino for the sensors and servo is that an RPI doesn't have ADC nor PWM)
2016-09-26 02:06:10	dunz0r	And I'm not sure an arduino is powerful enough to do GPS-navigation at a sane speed.
2016-09-26 02:06:30	dunz0r	You need to do a crapload of filtering since GPS is so jumpy

2016-09-26 10:57:48	demize	I mean, NFC is essentially a specialized subset of RFID.

2016-09-26 10:59:40	Kirito	Yeah, but I mean if it's what you use to make credit card transactions then that's probably what Samsung Pay utilizes, yes? Maybe. Maybe it's something else, there are two different types of credit card things. The magnet strip and the chip. I think Samsung Pay emulates the prior
2016-09-26 11:00:19	demize	Samsung Pay uses NFC.
2016-09-26 11:00:21	Kirito	"Unlike the current incumbents, Samsung Pay supports MST – Magnetic Secure Transmission – alongside NFC, which means it works with any payment terminal that accepts contactless payments or the more traditional method of swiping your card through the reader."

2016-09-26 23:14:18	MemesOfMagic	MrElendig: that's a bit of a mischaracterisation. 
2016-09-26 23:14:54	MemesOfMagic	we don't have the rhetoric here that they're all criminals and terrorists. More of the rhetoric is that of strain on our (already streched-thin) health service
2016-09-26 23:15:02	MrElendig	btw, hard to intigrate when you are not given proppern language/social education, gets discriminated against when it comes to jobs etc
2016-09-26 23:15:10	MrElendig	MemesOfMagic: ukip certainly do
2016-09-26 23:15:26	MrElendig	so does many random people on the street
2016-09-26 23:15:29	MemesOfMagic	MrElendig: some MPs might, but their official rhetoric was that of strain on services
2016-09-26 23:15:40	MrElendig	MemesOfMagic: which is actually wrong
2016-09-26 23:15:48	MemesOfMagic	and as someone that was denied healthcare due to lack of funding
2016-09-26 23:15:53	MemesOfMagic	I'm inclined to agree
2016-09-26 23:15:58	MrElendig	MemesOfMagic: because most of them come to work, pay taxes, and then leave before they get old/become a burden
2016-09-26 23:16:08	Rabbitnightmare	i like you people, seems all the nice people went to arch
2016-09-26 23:16:18	MemesOfMagic	I'm on a 2-year-long waiting list for treatment

2016-09-26 23:16:29	MemesOfMagic	that's streched thin if ever I could say that
2016-09-26 23:16:39	MrElendig	the work immigration is a benefit for the UK
2016-09-26 23:16:41	Rabbitnightmare	whats your prognosis

2016-09-26 23:17:12	ZnarqXrant	MrElendig: ahem...at least some of those immigrants have a wholly different concept of taxation, just mentioning it...
2016-09-26 23:17:15	MemesOfMagic	Rabbitnightmare: not quite as bad as I am
2016-09-26 23:17:17	minimalism	There are signs with Chinese in Vancouver
2016-09-26 23:17:31	Rabbitnightmare	MemesOfMagic: yeah life effects some more than others
2016-09-26 23:17:31	MrElendig	ZnarqXrant: the natives are no better
2016-09-26 23:17:32	minimalism	These people need to be forced to learn English like the French do with people from Quebec
2016-09-26 23:17:38	MemesOfMagic	I walked down a street near where i lived and everything was in arabic
2016-09-26 23:17:53	MemesOfMagic	MrElendig: HMRC is notoriously intrusive
2016-09-26 23:18:01	MrElendig	ZnarqXrant: the service sector and construction industy as a whole have a really low tax moral
2016-09-26 23:18:06	MemesOfMagic	the natives don't get away with anything tax-wise
2016-09-26 23:18:20	MrElendig	they do
2016-09-26 23:18:27	MemesOfMagic	HMRC can and will fuck you up
2016-09-26 23:18:33	ZnarqXrant	MrElendig: i don't know. it's not that obvious, except when it is in the local or national news.
2016-09-26 23:18:38	MemesOfMagic	they are the all-seeing eye of tax
2016-09-26 23:18:54	MrElendig	MemesOfMagic: you have a "friend" come over and fix your plumbing in exchange for some cash
2016-09-26 23:19:01	MrElendig	everyone does that
2016-09-26 23:19:18	minimalism	The French send all people from Quebec to camps to correct the wrong accent and pronunciation of the French language. They pronounce "ça" correctly or it's another volt from shocky.
2016-09-26 23:19:24	MrElendig	and something like 80% of resturants, bars, barber shops etc scam on the taxes
2016-09-26 23:19:31	MemesOfMagic	MrElendig: but if you put that in your bank account, you get fucked by HMRC
2016-09-26 23:19:44	MemesOfMagic	trust me, they're over-zealous
2016-09-26 23:19:52	ZnarqXrant	minimalism: what movie was that!?
2016-09-26 23:20:03	minimalism	ZnarqXrant: That's reality except for the shocky part.
2016-09-26 23:20:06	MrElendig	MemesOfMagic: do they spy in the bushes? they do here
2016-09-26 23:20:10	minimalism	It's probably just verbal discipline
2016-09-26 23:20:19	MrElendig	and we still have an insanely large black economy
2016-09-26 23:20:28	MrElendig	really, most get away with it
2016-09-26 23:20:29	MemesOfMagic	we have a proto-police-state here
2016-09-26 23:20:35	MemesOfMagic	all internet is monitored
2016-09-26 23:20:43	javaisnom	^ @ the mods tbh
2016-09-26 23:20:52	ZnarqXrant	what about cctv everywhere?
2016-09-26 23:20:56	MemesOfMagic	EVERYWHERE

2016-09-26 23:21:09	MemesOfMagic	in every shop
2016-09-26 23:21:17	MemesOfMagic	good luck finding a CCTV blindspot
2016-09-26 23:21:26	minimalism	The most troubling thing about that isn't just being monitored, but the people handling it are morons. And they're banking a ton of data they aren't able to keep secure.
2016-09-26 23:21:51	minimalism	We need laws on people being their own intellectual property.
2016-09-26 23:22:11	MemesOfMagic	sadly it's more likley that the snooper's charter will get pushed through
2016-09-26 23:22:50	ZnarqXrant	you know, a looooong time ago i've been to amsterdam with my gf. there we saw an advert on the street, bus to london only 20 gulden, or some such. so we did it. anyways, got late, been too cheep for a hotel, only two hours left until drive back.
2016-09-26 23:23:01	minimalism	People should be actively sabotaging those in power with their own machinations.
2016-09-26 23:23:12	minimalism	Let all the monitoring backfire on them to catch them doing something they didn't want known.
2016-09-26 23:23:49	ZnarqXrant	so. what happened? been unsure about which road to take out of some park, and went around this to see which went where. came a bobby and asked if he could help me?

2016-09-27 05:21:24	demize	Where "old distros" are distros with generally old packages.
2016-09-27 05:22:14	mar77i	the whole question is based on idiotic premises. bitrot is neither limited to nor prevalent in old distros.
2016-09-27 05:23:11	mar77i	most distros fare better today. only hipster distros like arch have bitrot.

2016-09-27 05:25:47	mar77i	how can an old distro become disliked if its bits haven't rotted?
2016-09-27 05:26:18	demize	By being old and because of that not having recent enough versions of software I need.
2016-09-27 05:28:07	mar77i	demize: but then it's already out of favor. over which the very question is posed.
2016-09-27 05:28:22	demize	Bugger off.
2016-09-27 05:29:06	dandels_	Wikipedia seems to struggle with clearly defining bitrot.

2016-09-27 05:31:22	dandels_	I suppose if an Arch package, which other packages depend on, stops upstream development but doesn't get replaced, it's bitrot. Generally I wouldn't say that Arch accumulates it since packages tend to get updated. Then there's OpenSSL, which is both updated and rotten.

2016-09-27 11:21:33	ekkelett	basically uses the slack api do it all.
2016-09-27 11:21:45	ekkelett	I don't think they've ever said it's built on top of an IRCd, but there's an IRC gateway.
2016-09-27 11:22:08	ekkelett	Unfortunately because it's IRC, it lacks some features that you expect from Slack. Hence, why not implement Slack in weechat using their API instead? :D

2016-09-27 15:03:34	mpan	phillid: the `type` attribute became confusing, because everything that surrounds script’s element execution has changed. Any language can be specified, but the browsers must act as if they don’t execute the script. So the website must provide interpreter for script elements with non-JS content. This is a sane solution that prevents people from requiring users from instaling 3rd party

2016-09-28 06:33:16	mpan	bug2000: this is a secondary issue, I believe. The main is that 94% of traffic that is 0.01% of all their traffic, is still 0.0094%… hence unimportant.
2016-09-28 06:33:46	mkoskar	bug2000: what you mean?
2016-09-28 06:34:01	bug2000	mkoskar, People would be confused it youtube would stop playing their music when they switch tab.
2016-09-28 06:34:39	bug2000	mpan, They want to make sure the amount of tor traffic doesn't increase, so they block it early.
2016-09-28 06:34:44	bug2000	Just speculating.
2016-09-28 06:34:46	mkoskar	bug2000: nah, what it does is that it enables you to mute tabs audio by clicking that little speaker icon in title
2016-09-28 06:34:48	mpan	bug2000: but the reason they don’t decrease can be explained easily IMO: these are requests from script kiddies that are using Tor to hide, because they’re afraid mom will gonna ban them from using computer if a police knock to the door. Serious attackers rarely use Tor for that purpose, because of its very low bandwidth.
2016-09-28 06:35:03	mkoskar	*tab's
2016-09-28 06:35:28	bug2000	mkoskar, Maybe it's still experimental?
2016-09-28 06:35:31	mpan	bug2000: there is possibility of using Tor for probing specific targets, but that’s close to the end of possibilities to use Tor for serious purposes.
2016-09-28 06:36:04	mkoskar	bug2000: yep, could be
2016-09-28 06:36:27	bug2000	mpan, How many script kiddies are there?! And how much can they abuse tor? As you said, limited bandwidth.
2016-09-28 06:38:01	mpan	bug2000: how many? Hard to tell, but I doubt it’s less than dozens of millions. How much they can abuse Tor? Dunno, because it depends on the meaning of word “abuse” :D. However, now I don’t see your point. My argument was that CF overreacts, which seemed the same as your opinion. Now me’s not sure.
2016-09-28 06:38:39	bug2000	I think I'm just confusing myself.
2016-09-28 06:38:58	bug2000	Other than that, I think cloudflare overreacts.
2016-09-28 06:39:18	 *	mpan agrees
2016-09-28 06:40:49	mpan	Also I don’t see how Tor could be used to harm CF. Of course their clients may have badly written, vulnerable apps — that’s true. But it shouldn’t be CF’s problem. CF is about preventing DDoS…

2016-09-28 08:18:33	mpan	Doing this manually and separately becomes inconvenient if you need some processing to be done on them (for example to get meaningful info instead of being faced with “document #1234 has been released”) or duplicates has to be eliminated.

2016-09-28 08:26:09	mpan	Unless you know a read that can process RSS an item. For example opens its URL, gets the logically parent page, finds the last element of specific characteristics on it, follows its link to get information from there, and replaces the RSS item with a combination of information from all the three locations…

2016-09-28 08:28:30	polyzen	you could probably automate it
2016-09-28 08:28:48	mpan	The next thing that would be nice is combining all items that refer to the same “third page” into one item, which links directly to all new PDFs that appeared for that subject.

2016-09-28 08:42:11	mpan	Because in my scenarios writing rules for that would be not much less complex than just wrting own software :D
2016-09-28 08:42:37	polyzen	true ^^
2016-09-28 08:42:49	demize	"rules" are really just a list of URLs pretty much.
2016-09-28 08:43:11	demize	Oh, reading the scrollback..
2016-09-28 08:43:28	demize	Eh, if it's more or less standardized, that would be a simple python script.
2016-09-28 08:43:33	demize	And then just a list of URLs.
2016-09-28 08:43:40	mpan	demize: as I said: “writing own software”.
2016-09-28 08:44:01	demize	Writing a simple python hook for urlwatch doesn't really fall under that IMO.
2016-09-28 08:44:03	mpan	I know I can always do that. But I will first search for already existing solutions.
2016-09-28 08:44:38	demize	That exact description isn't really anything I've seen /anything/ ever do.
2016-09-28 08:44:42	polyzen	I forget urlwatch has the shell job..
2016-09-28 08:44:44	demize	And can't see why anything would, because that's highly site specific.
2016-09-28 08:44:56	polyzen	should add lsupd to that

2016-09-28 08:46:23	mpan	urlwatch would have to observe thousands of pages to do that, and on change its rules would have to be dynamically re-created as new pages arrive. It’s not a fixed set. This is why RSS is good here, because I’m notified only about these few things that have actually changed (or more specifically: new pages that have appeared).
2016-09-28 08:46:43	mpan	But I believe it’s still possible to handle this in a generic way. Just a matter of specifying the problem properly.

2016-09-28 19:04:03	kbdkode	grawity​» that is quite a bit, though. I don't want to call it excessive, but that is quuiiite a bit
2016-09-28 19:05:16	grawity	kbdkode: well, it actually got much simpler when I rewrote it as a template
2016-09-28 19:05:27	grawity	kbdkode: rather than one huge blob of logic and variables
2016-09-28 19:06:21	grawity	some of my bashrc-$HOSTNAMEs change colors and └[decorations>} based on host type
2016-09-28 19:06:57	alyptik	grawity: DEMONstrator does that too it's a cool concept
2016-09-28 19:09:22	grawity	alyptik: does it also adapt to window width though
2016-09-28 19:09:49	alyptik	not sure 
2016-09-28 19:09:57	alyptik	wait you change color based on window width
2016-09-28 19:09:58	alyptik	wtf
2016-09-28 19:10:02	grawity	no
2016-09-28 19:10:10	grawity	just shrink the $PWD
2016-09-28 19:10:15	alyptik	oh hah
2016-09-28 19:11:15	kbdkode	grawity​» you know branch="$(git symbolic-ref --short -q HEAD 2> /dev/null)" (even if git isn't a command) will either be "" or branch name ;)
2016-09-28 19:11:30	kbdkode	but I will have to look at all of your stuff. it's a lot
2016-09-28 19:11:32	grawity	kbdkode: your point being?
2016-09-28 19:11:49	kbdkode	you don't have to check if git is a command and if inside git repo
2016-09-28 19:11:58	grawity	HEAD isn't /always/ a symbolic ref; sometimes it's detached and points directly to a commit
2016-09-28 19:12:45	kbdkode	what case would that be?
2016-09-28 19:13:00	grawity	like when you check out a commit directly
2016-09-28 19:13:06	grawity	anything that's not a local branch will also detach
2016-09-28 19:13:10	grawity	or when you're in the middle of a rebase
2016-09-28 19:13:26	grawity	anyway, the $git checks are slightly overkill, but they do have the side effect of setting $git to the git-dir
2016-09-28 19:13:34	grawity	which is used for those 'REBASE' &c. tags
2016-09-28 19:14:21	kbdkode	I guess I have not considered (or known about) these edge cases
2016-09-28 19:14:48	kbdkode	when I checkout a commit directly, then I will update :P

2016-09-29 01:19:39	mar77i	the thing that surprised me most was probably that there's a base image but only with kernel sources included.

2016-09-29 01:28:39	alyptik	i do compile faster i guess

2016-09-29 01:29:05	mar77i	BL4DE: well I have an amd geode LX800 on the gentoo machine I have, so arch isn't really an option

2016-09-29 01:36:17	mar77i	the geode doesn't have a nopl instruction. of course there's a kernel thing which can emulate the behavior by ignoring sigill in that case, but that's just terrible.
2016-09-29 01:37:12	BL4DE	is it better idea to try it in chroot first? compiling kernel in VM feels like would take an eternity?
2016-09-29 01:37:23	raijin	so you would have to recompile everything for the geode?
2016-09-29 01:38:48	mar77i	raijin: basically, yes. the other option is to live with the terrible performance the above sigill kernel trick gives, I think bluewind does that.
2016-09-29 01:40:15	mar77i	I followed the recent sse2 thread closely and would like to see an easy port infrastructure for arch.

2016-09-29 01:40:51	raijin	The Geode LX 800 is an i586 processor.
2016-09-29 01:40:51	raijin	Which is wrong. Yes, the Geode lacks of the NOPL instruction, but this instruction never was part of Intel's i686 specification. Unfortunately, it became an unofficial standard. But as it seems, new versions of binutils or gcc or whatever realized that fact and stopped building NOPLs into executables, because ARCH i686 works on the Geode (using arch's November 2012 iso).
2016-09-29 01:40:51	raijin	I have just installed Arch Linux on my ALIX Board (3d3) with a Geode LX 800 processor. The only things you have to take care of is to press TAB at the installer's boot screen and add the option "arch=i686", and set "Architecture = i686" in your pacman.conf. That's it.
2016-09-29 01:41:40	mar77i	but with gentoo I can have native optimisation.
2016-09-29 01:41:56	raijin	. . . 
2016-09-29 01:42:00	raijin	you can with arch

2016-09-29 01:42:36	raijin	 what's the problem
2016-09-29 01:43:05	raijin	there is not special proprietary gentoo kernel patchset?
2016-09-29 01:43:25	raijin	and I didn't realize Geode is from the MediaGX family
2016-09-29 01:43:51	raijin	I loved that proc, it ran windows 98 with no heatsink

2016-09-29 11:12:33	dviola	I'm all for reducing income inequality
2016-09-29 11:13:10	dviola	but that was one of the PT's goals, to reduce income inequality with things like "bolsa familia" and giving house to the poor, they invested a lot on this
2016-09-29 11:13:23	dviola	and you have all the rightwingers hating on PT for this

2016-09-29 11:42:20	sudokode	do you have to get the whole blockchain just to keep a wallet?

2016-09-29 11:42:52	sudokode	also, there are third party wallets, but that comes with its own risk

2016-09-29 11:45:04	dviola	yes
2016-09-29 11:45:24	dviola	the other nodes send you the blockchain data, so you can help bootstrap other nodes as well
2016-09-29 11:45:26	sudokode	guess that makes sense. it has to know what transactions are allowed
2016-09-29 11:45:59	dviola	but as part of the downloading time, you are also verifying the many tx
2016-09-29 11:46:09	dviola	making sure those tx are real
2016-09-29 11:46:13	sudokode	dviola: BTC reminds me of git

2016-09-29 11:46:41	sudokode	I guess it would be since git uses sha1
2016-09-29 11:46:46	sudokode	BTC uses sha256 though iirc
2016-09-29 11:47:02	dviola	"Note: Bitcoin Core requires syncing the blockchain (current size is about 90GB as of Sept. 2016); each transaction in a block gets verified by verifying the ECDSA signatures that spend each transaction, which is a time-consuming mathematical operation, so having a good CPU, sufficient storage and bandwidth is highly recommended."
2016-09-29 11:47:02		[11:47]
2016-09-29 11:47:09	sudokode	and it has to verify the history based on the checksum
2016-09-29 11:47:12	sudokode	in both cases
2016-09-29 11:47:27	dviola	yep
2016-09-29 11:47:53	dviola	sudokode: the lightweight wallets just use bitcoin core at the other end
2016-09-29 11:48:08	sudokode	ic
2016-09-29 11:48:09	dviola	or SPV wallets
2016-09-29 11:48:14	dviola	electrum, etc
2016-09-29 11:48:23	dviola	so they are doing the "verifying" part
2016-09-29 11:48:48	dviola	but you still hold the keys
2016-09-29 11:48:57	dviola	you can still dump your priv keys with lightwight wallets and import them into core, or vice versa

2016-09-29 14:09:24	mkoskar	strangely enough, Sid always makes me think about Pink Floyd's Syd Barrett
2016-09-29 14:09:28	nshp	but debian has that ... and systemd ... and it uses both for different things?
2016-09-29 14:09:57	sudokode	taskene: nope, think about where the toys come from. how they all instinctively know to play fake around people
2016-09-29 14:10:13	taskene	That's just human development. Everyone plays fake.
2016-09-29 14:10:46	sudokode	no, clearly they're enslaved, perhaps unknowingly... though I can't imagine the toy makers aren't aware
2016-09-29 14:10:58	sudokode	or they're alien race lying in wait
2016-09-29 14:11:18	taskene	Nah, if they were an alien race they would have reacted worse to a space man coming by.
2016-09-29 14:11:53	sudokode	but the space man was also a toy that played fake

2016-09-30 06:58:06	SolidSaltySwan	then you should avoid the AUR tbh
2016-09-30 06:58:26	Phryq	though I guess my original question was what was the coolest - and self builds are indeed cooler than auto-things

2016-09-30 07:00:23	SolidSaltySwan	but in general it is incredibly stupid for inexperienced users to automate the AUR
2016-09-30 07:00:36	houn	But if you're just grabbing niche software and the latest hot gtk-theme-git packages...
2016-09-30 07:01:54	SolidSaltySwan	you should always be fully aware of which of your packages are from the AUR, and whether or not they have dependencies that could break on a system upgrade

2016-09-30 20:44:59	Shoe16	if people wanna transition, then complete the transition and then start referring to yourself as that

2016-10-02 15:34:34	poisonby	mpan: Yes, and that's the point. It's to protect protsitutes who probably often gets into the business unwillingly, and to attempt to reduce prostitution by making it illegal for clients to purcahse their services.

2016-10-02 19:58:52	phillid	Yeah
2016-10-02 19:59:20	phillid	I remember looking at a table of features comparing nouveau to the blob drivers and nouveau had a bunch of gaps, or version clauses
2016-10-02 19:59:34	phillid	This was a few years ago though
2016-10-02 20:00:08	polyzen	how about these versions
2016-10-02 20:00:08		[20:00]
2016-10-02 20:00:16	phillid	Ooh underline
2016-10-02 20:00:31	GaivsIvlivs	Yeah, there are still a lot of gaps
2016-10-02 20:00:54	GaivsIvlivs	but at least the client is running for me now, and pretty zippy too
2016-10-02 20:00:59	phillid	Is there an AMD/NVIDIA performance gap in the video world like there is in the CPU world ?
2016-10-02 20:01:15	GaivsIvlivs	They always one-up each other with the next generation
2016-10-02 20:01:19	phillid	That's good
2016-10-02 20:01:27	phillid	AMD hasn't been one-upping on CPUs for a while
2016-10-02 20:01:39	GaivsIvlivs	That. And AMD drivers historically suck in general.
2016-10-02 20:01:53	phillid	Hopefully Zen will bring price drops in intel CPUs
2016-10-02 20:01:58	phillid	I dunno though
2016-10-02 20:02:17	MK_FG	Zen?
2016-10-02 20:02:18	phillid	and/or radical price drops in AMD's own hardware so I can nab some cheap stuff
2016-10-02 20:02:25	phillid	MK_FG, new microarchitecture
2016-10-02 20:02:45	GaivsIvlivs	You'd hope. But I've liked Intel for a while, for drivers and power efficiency, and heat handling
2016-10-02 20:02:45	phillid	One of AMD's new ones
2016-10-02 20:02:47	MK_FG	Oh
2016-10-02 20:02:59	phillid	Yeah, I was looking at an 8-core AMD, but it's TDP was 220W
2016-10-02 20:03:18	phillid	Compare that to an i7 twice the price and 1.5× as performant, with less than 45% of the TDP
2016-10-02 20:03:34	GaivsIvlivs	That. You pay for what you get.
2016-10-02 20:03:35	phillid	Suddenly "cheap" hardware isn't such great value
2016-10-02 20:03:54	phillid	There are people who believe the contrary is true, and that AMD is good value
2016-10-02 20:04:11	GaivsIvlivs	Those people are dumb.
2016-10-02 20:04:13	phillid	I will admit a lot of intel's prices are indeed over-inflated, but they're mostlybetter value
2016-10-02 20:04:20	GaivsIvlivs	AMD GPUs are better for bitmining, though
2016-10-02 20:04:40	phillid	Like, I wouldn't call the 8 core i7s good value, at like $2k compared to a 4 or 6 core at $500 or $600
2016-10-02 20:04:46	MK_FG	Last comp I built was AMD, but was more than a year ago, maybe you're looking at diff stuff
2016-10-02 20:04:53	phillid	MK_FG, probably not
2016-10-02 20:04:55	GaivsIvlivs	I'll try an easy game first with my setup
2016-10-02 20:05:00	phillid	AMD hasn't released new CPUs for ages
2016-10-02 20:05:11	GaivsIvlivs	MK_FG it's been true for at least the 2010s
2016-10-02 20:05:25	MK_FG	Then guess you're just wrong
2016-10-02 20:05:29	phillid	We still have to credit AMD for x86_64 architecture
2016-10-02 20:05:30	MK_FG	Oh well
2016-10-02 20:05:39	phillid	And I think Intel still pays royalties or license fees to AMD for that
2016-10-02 20:06:09	phillid	If I was building just a gaming box, I'd probably go AMD for the CPU and gfx
2016-10-02 20:06:18	phillid	But I'm looking at a workstation/gaming build
2016-10-02 20:06:34	phillid	I'll pay more for Intel, but I won't regret it
2016-10-02 20:06:42	GaivsIvlivs	If AMD were wiser they'd be investing those royalties in better R&D
2016-10-02 20:07:07	phillid	Well I mean, Zen is ready to be put into production, but their foundry is behind in their own R&D
2016-10-02 20:07:28	phillid	GlobalFoundries or whatever their name is
2016-10-02 20:07:45	phillid	Something about not having the tech ready for 14nm lithography or something
2016-10-02 20:08:01	MK_FG	Why'd price drop when it goes into production?
2016-10-02 20:08:13	MK_FG	I'd think it'd take at least year or two for that
2016-10-02 20:08:31	MK_FG	When people actually can and will start buying the new stuff
2016-10-02 20:09:01	MK_FG	Assuming they even will be doing that, ofc...
2016-10-02 20:09:21	MK_FG	No idea why there's pretty much any demand for new CPUs
2016-10-02 20:09:27	GaivsIvlivs	so phillid, Snapshot looks good on my setup, though it runs a little laggy
2016-10-02 20:09:45	MK_FG	Well, except for mobile SoCs, ofc
2016-10-02 20:10:11	phillid	I guess you will have fanboys
2016-10-02 20:10:24	phillid	There will be a bunch of people who will stop and buy AMD instead
2016-10-02 20:10:35	GaivsIvlivs	Fanboys will be boys.
2016-10-02 20:11:00	phillid	I guess there will be people like me, who are about to build a PC, and they'll be less settled on choosing Intel
2016-10-02 20:11:09	phillid	I'm not an expert in the field though
2016-10-02 20:11:20	GaivsIvlivs	My recommendation for processor is go with Intel if you have the money.
2016-10-02 20:11:42	GaivsIvlivs	Intel is more worth it in the long run.
2016-10-02 20:11:53	phillid	I put together numerous builds on pcpartpicker and found AMD to only be about 5 or 10% cheaper, all up
2016-10-02 20:12:03	phillid	The motherboard was spesive
2016-10-02 20:12:08	phillid	*'spensive
2016-10-02 20:12:16	GaivsIvlivs	espensif
2016-10-02 20:12:20	phillid	hehe yeha
2016-10-02 20:12:23	phillid	*yeah
2016-10-02 20:12:40	GaivsIvlivs	*yeehaw
2016-10-02 20:12:40	phillid	Plus, when you consider that atm, AMD chips are all DDR3, so you're buying into old tech

2016-10-03 11:26:41	MK_FG	Is satellite hacking really a thing?
2016-10-03 11:27:44	tbo	no idea, the company says they don't why the satellite failed

2016-10-03 11:33:30	phillid	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-10-03 11:33:30	MK_FG	People use mil sats as free relays with cheap radios no problem
2016-10-03 11:34:10	phillid	mil satellites might use or support dumber, older protocols
2016-10-03 11:34:19	phillid	Which are cheaper to implement in hardware
2016-10-03 11:34:24	phillid	I dunno though
2016-10-03 11:34:29	tbo	I like to have a little satellite but it must be one with an EMP weapon or so
2016-10-03 11:34:39	phillid	heh
2016-10-03 11:34:58	MK_FG	They just relays specific rf freqs back, but point is that getting signal there isn't the issue
2016-10-03 11:35:18	MK_FG	And I bet it's all security-by-obscurity from there
2016-10-03 11:36:16	tbo	MK_FG: they won't use some kind of ssh with key stored in the satellite
2016-10-03 11:37:58	phillid	Coming from a ham radio background, it's not as simple as "relaying freqs"
2016-10-03 11:38:17	phillid	Especially when moving to digital communications satellites
2016-10-03 11:39:16	tbo	this one is a geo one

2016-10-03 11:39:40	MK_FG	Satellites are for spacemen
2016-10-03 11:39:45	phillid	hams and cheap radios tend to deal with low-eath orbit sats

2016-10-03 14:59:41	phillid	The histories are unrelated

2016-10-03 15:04:18	sudokode	silly sudokode 
2016-10-03 15:04:28	phillid	I still think the AUR will have issues with your history
2016-10-03 15:04:43	phillid	But I'm not sure on this matter, I haven't merged unrelated histories before
2016-10-03 15:04:53	phillid	Trying it now in some synthetic repos on /tmp
2016-10-03 15:07:19	alyptik	it kinda works if i git rm PKGBUILD, pull, and cp it back in
2016-10-03 15:07:28	alyptik	no idea why or what is going on though
2016-10-03 15:07:50	phillid	Just finished my tests ofn/tmp

2016-10-03 15:08:05	phillid	Merging unrelated histories and fixing the conflict I created on purpose seemed to work for both remotes

2016-10-03 15:11:41	alyptik	my normal github
2016-10-03 15:11:56	alyptik	basically i want to just pull that and push to update aur package
2016-10-03 15:12:09	alyptik	can i make aur a branch of it somehow?
2016-10-03 15:12:26	phillid	As you found, they have different histories
2016-10-03 15:12:46	phillid	I can give you a nice and easy "Not The Right Way™" of doing it
2016-10-03 15:13:09	alyptik	hit me
2016-10-03 15:13:11	phillid	The Right Way™ would be to you'd merge like you did, and fix the conflicts, then complete the merge
2016-10-03 15:13:21	phillid	The Not The Right Way™, however
2016-10-03 15:14:51	phillid	Is to clone your github one, clone the aur one (into a separate directory), copy all the files from the github clone into your AUR one (except .git) then commit any changes in the AUR one.
2016-10-03 15:14:56	phillid	Then,
2016-10-03 15:15:12	alyptik	that is what i have been going
2016-10-03 15:15:18	alyptik	s/goi/doi
2016-10-03 15:15:26	phillid	Add a remote to the repo cloned from AUR pointing to your github
2016-10-03 15:15:26	phillid	Then just force push over your github one
2016-10-03 15:15:30	alyptik	i'll google merges then
2016-10-03 15:15:45	alyptik	for push?
2016-10-03 15:15:46	phillid	Mmm
2016-10-03 15:15:49	alyptik	force*
2016-10-03 15:15:51	phillid	The proper way should work for you
2016-10-03 15:16:06	phillid	Force push disregards any history on the remote
2016-10-03 15:16:38	phillid	It overwrites the remote tree as necessary to fit it with the one being pushed
2016-10-03 15:16:40	alyptik	so you mean force pull then force push
2016-10-03 15:16:49	phillid	No

2016-10-03 22:31:27	mkoskar	I've perfected my basically pointless FF exercise of moving reload button from far right to beginning of the urlbar. Looks good :p. Lesson to take away is that FF UI is very much tweakable (though overwriting builtin rules is pain), as opposed to Chrome, which doesn't allow you to change anything at all.

2016-10-04 08:03:40	mpan	Do you think Python is a good language for teaching algorithms (basic course)? I’ve recommended it to a fellow college teacher to replace C or C++, but I’m not entirely sure if there are no better options.
2016-10-04 08:03:53	demize	mpan: I'd say Haskell honestly
2016-10-04 08:03:56	demize	But Python works too.
2016-10-04 08:04:09	DarkFeather	mkoskar: I agree with you -- I don't like small fonts for terminals.
2016-10-04 08:04:13	SAYITFORALWAYS	mpan: personally, no.
2016-10-04 08:04:39	SAYITFORALWAYS	IMO C is the best language to learn algorithms, because then you'll realy have to implement each part of the algorithm yourself.
2016-10-04 08:05:03	SAYITFORALWAYS	Unlike Java, you can just use BuckSort of NumberSort or COuntingSort and not know whats going on underneath
2016-10-04 08:05:14	SAYITFORALWAYS	Or you might use their "maps" without knowing its a red and black tree underneath
2016-10-04 08:05:16	demize	SAYITFORALWAYS: Problem with that is that most beginners end up thinking too much about the implementation and not really grokking the algorithm itself.
2016-10-04 08:05:24	DarkFeather	^ and it's great for learning efficiency. From there on, prototyping in PHP/Bash works alright, and then C# is pretty much a web/console standard these days.
2016-10-04 08:05:27	SAYITFORALWAYS	demize: hm? true true
2016-10-04 08:05:48	DarkFeather	demize: To be honest, though, that teaches matching the actual way a computer works to the thought process.
2016-10-04 08:06:01	SAYITFORALWAYS	C is also grt for algorithms because its concise

2016-10-04 08:06:14	phrik	<mar77i> ass is always funny, because gender neutral despite one might assume I had a gender..
2016-10-04 08:06:18	SAYITFORALWAYS	with python/java/C++ you will get too confused with all the OOP stuff unrelated to algorithm design
2016-10-04 08:06:18	demize	DarkFeather: C# is neither a web nor a console standard.  It's being used relatively commonly with MS shops, but those are honestly not even close to a majority.
2016-10-04 08:06:24	SAYITFORALWAYS	C is more straightforward and algorithm oriented
2016-10-04 08:06:46	demize	SAYITFORALWAYS: You wouldn't do any OOP thing for the algorithms
2016-10-04 08:06:47	mkoskar	DarkFeather: 32px is bit too much for regular work, but I really like big terminus, very nice technical glyphs, imo ... I should go off-X periodically, although kmscon is better than linux console
2016-10-04 08:06:50	DarkFeather	demize: I'm using it for Linux dev with a mono dependency.

2016-10-04 08:07:17	demize	DarkFeather: Irrelevant to it really not being anything close to a standard.

2016-10-04 08:07:33	mpan	SAYITFORALWAYS: I would not get this as a sound argument, as you’re making strange assumption about that someone is forced to use language’s standard data structures when learning algorithms.

2016-10-04 08:21:11	mpan	ThatsTheWayItSho: in C you need to care about things that have nothing to do with algorithms themselves, and it takes most of the time.
2016-10-04 08:21:30	ThatsTheWayItSho	C++/Java/Python users would use builtins without knowing how the algorithm actually works

2016-10-04 08:21:57	mpan	ThatsTheWayItSho: yeah, and they would work much better than most C programmers could implement ever in their life.
2016-10-04 08:22:00	mar77i	ThatsTheWayItSho: no, a good programmer uses a library and tells everyone his understanding of how an avl tree works while the library actually does a completely different (but correct) thing.
2016-10-04 08:22:09	ThatsTheWayItSho	mpan: or good programmers can reimplement specific to a certain case in a couple minuets
2016-10-04 08:22:21	mpan	ThatsTheWayItSho: we’re talking about beginners and teaching algorithms, so the code is not reusable. Also there is rarely good level of reausability in C.
2016-10-04 08:22:41	mpan	ThatsTheWayItSho: strange, because deriving a good hash function can take days if not weeks of work.
2016-10-04 08:22:47	andrewSC	I wish I knew how to show of my nerdiness like you guys
2016-10-04 08:22:48	demize	Not to mention that you can't really write generic algorithms in C.
2016-10-04 08:22:54	ThatsTheWayItSho	mpan: yeah, but its better. see, in C if you write a binary search alg specific to your senario, itllbe faster than a builtin binary search alg.

2016-10-04 08:23:45	mpan	ThatsTheWayItSho: that’s a myth spread by C programmers who still live in 80s and can’t even define word “performance”, much less can measure it.
2016-10-04 08:23:51	mar77i	but the story is always the same...
2016-10-04 08:24:02	ThatsTheWayItSho	mostly about checking when you should get out of the search. do you go by index? by value?
2016-10-04 08:24:12	ThatsTheWayItSho	which leads back to the questin about which search you should use.
2016-10-04 08:24:14	mpan	Also there are some assembly programmers who still live in their nearly-religious assumption that their code is faster than C (Despite both of them are slower than PHP).

And, you know, it could be faster than `malloc` if tailored for particular use. “Could”, because you will not implement that well enough to even match `malloc`’s worst case.

2016-10-04 16:16:43	KKKrx	fnord termite uses a gui by default thats why it needs an x seever and doesnt work in console

2016-10-04 16:17:03	KKKrx	st also uses a gui, but its much more minimal

2016-10-05 02:23:18	vrmxm	Puppet over Ansible, eh?
2016-10-05 02:23:18		[02:23]
2016-10-05 02:23:29	 *	dunz0r prefers salt over both ansible and puppet
2016-10-05 02:23:33	vrmxm	(He said, to a conversation that was probably finished hours ago)
2016-10-05 02:23:39	dunz0r	vrmxm: Ansible/puppet aren't really the same though
2016-10-05 02:23:47	dunz0r	Salt vs puppet is probably more "correct"
2016-10-05 02:23:50	vrmxm	Well
2016-10-05 02:24:00	dunz0r	And there I pick salt, because puppet is so bloody complex and enormous
2016-10-05 02:24:13	vrmxm	How do you see them as incomparably different?
2016-10-05 02:24:30	vrmxm	Granted, I haven't used Puppet since it was new
2016-10-05 02:24:42	dunz0r	vrmxm: Ansible is more for just doing stuff on many machines at once, where salt/puppet is for that and config handling as well

2016-10-05 02:24:58	dunz0r	Ansible can be made to handle configs and "states", but it isn't built for it
2016-10-05 02:25:09	vrmxm	That's an odd thing to say
2016-10-05 02:25:20	vrmxm	It has a templating system
2016-10-05 02:25:23	vrmxm	And file vault
2016-10-05 02:25:35	dunz0r	Then I might misremember. Disregard everything I just said :D
2016-10-05 02:25:42	vrmxm	LOL, fair enough
2016-10-05 02:25:45	mar77i	oh god, dev@sl is killing me.
2016-10-05 02:26:20	vrmxm	I'd like a Puppet/Salt/Chef/Ansaible type system that lets me craft a LFS/Gentoo install and execute it, end to end
2016-10-05 02:26:46	dunz0r	vrmxm: Well, they all do that, if you put enough effort in :)
2016-10-05 02:27:00	dunz0r	I know I can do it with salt, not sure why I would want to though :D
2016-10-05 02:27:01	mar77i	a bash script would be enough, I guess
2016-10-05 02:27:11	vrmxm	mar77i -- Yeah, I was thinking along those lines
2016-10-05 02:27:28	vrmxm	But there are some modules in Ansible (so likely in the others) that would make some things much easier than a bash script
2016-10-05 02:27:38	vrmxm	The main issue is connectivity
2016-10-05 02:27:44	dunz0r	Salt has sweet ass templating
2016-10-05 02:27:54	dunz0r	And it can do it over ssh
2016-10-05 02:28:25	vrmxm	Installing Gen from boot to chroot would be simple, I think, but can these devops tools handle working inside a chroot?
2016-10-05 02:28:34	vrmxm	Then the whole reboot-and-wait phase
2016-10-05 02:28:51	vrmxm	I might play around with it today, see what I can manage
2016-10-05 02:29:03	dunz0r	vrmxm: Salt can do stuff like act on events from external sources. Like when a machine connects.
2016-10-05 02:29:29	vrmxm	Yeah
2016-10-05 02:29:44	vrmxm	There's hackish ways of making Ansible do reboot-and-wait too
2016-10-05 02:29:49	vrmxm	The main issue is the chroot
2016-10-05 02:30:12	mar77i	you can always drop a script into a chroot and run it.
2016-10-05 02:30:13	dunz0r	I think that salt would have issues with that as well
2016-10-05 02:30:28	dunz0r	You'd have to write a bash-script which logs in to the chroot or something
2016-10-05 02:30:29	mar77i	depends on the specifics of one's setup
2016-10-05 02:30:56	vrmxm	I was thinking that the main point of the chroot is installing the kernel and some tools, so I could just do that, back them up, then skip the chroot and insert them during the install
2016-10-05 02:31:16	mar77i	yeah, and setting up the bootloader
2016-10-05 02:31:30	mar77i	if you still use any
2016-10-05 02:31:53	vrmxm	UEFI, for better or worse
2016-10-05 02:32:31	vrmxm	Presently I'm trying to figure out btrfs on full disk encryption on UEFI
2016-10-05 02:32:34	vrmxm	Not having luck

2016-10-05 14:31:35	sudokode	Greybus also adds a network routing layer internally and a set of class protocols for specific device types. This is something that USB and PCI got right, Greg said. When they adhere to the class protocols, devices like keyboards or WiFi adapters just work with no additional software development needed. This is important for Project Ara; it would like to see a lively market in third-party modules,
2016-10-05 14:31:35		[14:31]
2016-10-05 14:31:35	sudokode	and that is much more likely to happen if new modules simply work in existing systems. 
2016-10-05 14:31:45	sudokode	that's also how USB can fail
2016-10-05 14:32:02	sudokode	because evil devices don't give a shit about the protocol
