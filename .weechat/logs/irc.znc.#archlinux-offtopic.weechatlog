2016-09-16 02:26:35	dunz0r	YoungPython: You can change the screensaver but not modify the "Screen" iirc
2016-09-16 02:26:39	Zelest	does it have retarded shit like sudo as well? :(
2016-09-16 02:27:01	dunz0r	Zelest: Yes, I installed and configured sudo instead of constantly running as root
2016-09-16 02:27:05	dunz0r	Because I'm not hitler

2016-09-16 02:27:59	Zelest	doas(1) - execute commands as another user
2016-09-16 02:28:10	dunz0r	So it's the same as sudo but different?
2016-09-16 02:28:11	Zelest	sudo was inscure.. according to theo ;)
2016-09-16 02:28:20	dunz0r	Ah. Theo <3
2016-09-16 02:28:32	Zelest	nah, but non-supported and unmaintained code
2016-09-16 02:28:41	Zelest	so they rewrote their own implementation to do that
2016-09-16 02:28:49	Zelest	with pledge and privsep and what not
2016-09-16 02:29:00	Zelest	also
2016-09-16 02:29:05	dunz0r	Might replace sudo then, as long as it has the features that I use in sudo.
2016-09-16 02:29:19	dunz0r	Like insults. That's the best feature
2016-09-16 02:29:22	Zelest	"i'm running sudo instead of constantly running as root becuase I'm not hitler"

2016-09-16 07:01:50	neuroserpens	du5tball: i don't even mess with that anymore. i just accept the steam runtime
2016-09-16 07:02:04	neuroserpens	du5tball: and i won't even write the story
2016-09-16 07:02:07	neuroserpens	du5tball: too long
2016-09-16 07:02:22	du5tball	i think i delete some shit from time to time (which was once in the wiki), but if steam runs, i'm happy
2016-09-16 07:03:02	du5tball	i couldn't give less of a shit which libs it uses, as long as it works
2016-09-16 07:03:52	neuroserpens	du5tball: i just hope you don't come to regret deleting anything lol
2016-09-16 07:04:01	neuroserpens	du5tball: steam can be pretty strange at times
2016-09-16 07:04:08	neuroserpens	du5tball: like... almost self bricking strange
2016-09-16 07:04:32	neuroserpens	du5tball: and always... ALWAYS keep your games in a separate folder
2016-09-16 07:04:37	du5tball	neuroserpens: nah and if so, i move the whole steam-folder somewhere else, let steam pull it's stuff again, and merge the two folders
2016-09-16 07:04:53	du5tball	neuroserpens: yeah. move the steam folder to a separate partition and ln -s it
2016-09-16 07:04:56	neuroserpens	du5tball: sometimes even that doesn't work

2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:31:42] sounds good for my little tor-hidden-service-inside-VM setuo [20:31:42]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:31:55] deltasquared: Beware, that's in the edge repository. [20:31:55]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:32:06] Alpine has two settings basically.. a versioned repository setting like 3.4 [20:32:06]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:32:08] or the edge repository [20:32:08]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:32:13] minimalism: is that like unstable? [20:32:13]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:32:15] I see. [20:32:15]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:32:20] hmm [20:32:20]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:32:29] they have stable/versioned, edge, and testing [20:32:29]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:32:57] hmmm [20:32:57]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:32:57] The creator gets paid by docker to just maintain it though now, I believe [20:32:57]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:33:07] lol [20:33:07]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:33:26] I kinda like tor, not really because anonymous anymore (didn't that break?) but because neither side has to port forward or have public IP [20:33:26]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:33:29] why have edge, if you have a testing, though o.o [20:33:29]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mankypirate	[20:33:37] alpine's python packages are all for py2.7 which sucks [20:33:37]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:33:46] because they offer you the choice to used stable versioned if you prefer that [20:33:46]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:33:50] or use something more like arch with edge [20:33:50]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:33:55] as a rolling release [20:33:55]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:33:59] use stable* [20:33:59]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:34:17] hmmm i guess [20:34:17]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:34:38] there iiis a bit of a difference [20:34:38]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	*buffextras	[20:36:12] dandels_!~Dandels@unaffiliated/dandels joined [20:36:12]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:36:15] maybe edge and testing would be the same then? and testing stuff would go to stable after? o.o [20:36:15]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:36:26] nah [20:36:26]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:36:41] I think it's testing to edge, then to a versioned repository for a new release [20:36:41]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:36:44] on a separate subject though, is it widely believed that tor's *anonymity* is compromised? [20:36:44]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:36:54] hmmm [20:36:54]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:37:11] well I wouldn't use it bareback [20:37:11]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	mnrmnaugh	[20:37:20] depends on where you enter and exit afiak [20:37:20]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:37:39] hue [20:37:39]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:38:47] is it still viable from an encryption standpoint though? (ignore leaving exit node or assume hidden service for now) [20:38:47]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	deltasquared	[20:39:06] I uh... may have used it in a starbucks [20:39:06]
2016-09-16 10:39:15	minimalism	[20:39:10] I think the network is okay, but that issue with whoever controls the exit node is a problem [20:39:10]

2016-09-16 10:44:45	Kirito	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1nYdpnkXVY The Gear Fit 2 is pretty sexy but it lacks some basic smart watch functionality
2016-09-16 10:44:51	Kirito	since it's designed more as a fitness tracker
2016-09-16 10:44:57	deltasquared	night mode filter is the shit.
2016-09-16 10:45:00	SolidSaltySwan	possibly. ZNC might have a module for the auth, though, alyptik. It has one for Q (quakenet) and one for SASL
2016-09-16 10:45:09	Kirito	it looks like a smart watch actually SHOULD look though, in my opinion

2016-09-16 11:53:41	DarkFeather	u means upgrade only?
2016-09-16 11:53:49	DarkFeather	Is -Su safe to use?
2016-09-16 11:53:54	eris	It means upgrade, period.
2016-09-16 11:54:05	eris	Sure, but it's pointless without the -y.
2016-09-16 11:54:32	alyptik	it is the pacman NOP
2016-09-16 11:54:56	DarkFeather	Not necessarily -- I'm using Makefiles to install dependencies for some of my code, and so if I want to upgrade deps (and not override packages with a newer version that I've added like yours), -Su is useful.
2016-09-16 11:54:56		[11:54]
2016-09-16 11:55:23	DarkFeather	Because if it's newer on local, it'll get left alone; if it's missing, it'd get installed to mirror latest,and if it's older it'd get updated, right?

2016-09-16 11:55:52	DarkFeather	Because that feels like a deficiency.
2016-09-16 11:56:07	eris	No, just read the damned manpage....

2016-09-16 11:56:35	alyptik	fuck that shit
2016-09-16 11:56:50	eris	Literally the only way that -Su would do anything is if you had done a -Sy without -u.
2016-09-16 11:57:07	eris	Well, also if you manually downgrade a package.
2016-09-16 11:58:27	DarkFeather	Uhhhh, eris? man pacman in the --sysupgrade option section, says that it will do exactly what I said... Might upgrade some other things along the way, but it will install new things and upgrade things that are out of date. It says specifically that -u will upgrade packages only if newer.
2016-09-16 11:59:08	eris	And without a -y what it does is useless.
2016-09-16 11:59:11	DarkFeather	Which is not the acted behavior -_-; So the "if newer" bit in the manpage is a lie. Yay.

2016-09-17 00:35:16	dunz0r	phillid: It improves the read speed.
2016-09-17 00:35:24	phillid	RAID0 is just I PAID FOR ALL THIS SPACE, MAKE IT LOOK CONTINOUS
2016-09-17 00:35:27	phillid	dunz0r, cool
2016-09-17 00:35:29	alyptik	lol
2016-09-17 00:35:38	dunz0r	'RAID 0 (also known as a stripe set or striped volume) splits ("stripes") data evenly across two or more disks, without parity information, redundancy, or fault tolerance. '
2016-09-17 00:35:43	dunz0r	If one drive fails, all data is lost
2016-09-17 00:36:14	phillid	I might need to rethink my storage
2016-09-17 00:36:16	dunz0r	RAID0 is faster than a single drive though.
2016-09-17 00:36:18	alyptik	i wonder why flac only goes to 8 instead of 10
2016-09-17 00:36:23	alyptik	fuckers thinking in octal
2016-09-17 00:36:48	dunz0r	phillid: Go for "prosumer"-disks. Like WD Red NAS or something. It'll help you sleep better :)
2016-09-17 00:36:54	phillid	Yeah
2016-09-17 00:37:31	phillid	I want an SSD for / and then I just want a huge "cum dumpster" for storage which I can mount to /mnt/something
2016-09-17 00:37:42	phillid	But I don't wanna fork out for RAID on the SSD
2016-09-17 00:37:52	phillid	I guess / shouldn't hold precious stuff anyway
2016-09-17 00:38:02	phillid	Except config, but that can be backed up
2016-09-17 00:38:27	phillid	Oh and /home and pacman cache would be on the magnetic
2016-09-17 00:38:32	phillid	All the non-perfomant stuff
2016-09-17 00:39:02	phillid	I suppose I could rethink the size of my SSD
2016-09-17 00:39:15	dunz0r	phillid: If you're just going to keep / on it, it can be pretty small
2016-09-17 00:39:23	phillid	240GB might be too much if I have magnetic mounted all over the filesystem
2016-09-17 00:39:27	alyptik	am i the only who uses /store?

2016-09-17 01:59:24	mar77i	grawity: ah, it's been added to it in some cases
2016-09-17 01:59:38	Zelest	Boohbah, seeing llvm is in base soon, I assume/hope they migrate towards it
2016-09-17 01:59:52	dunz0r	llvm is pretty sweet though.

2016-09-17 02:04:13	dunz0r	And mount was called something silly instead of mount.
2016-09-17 02:04:18	Zelest	no idea about mount though

2016-09-17 11:11:09	cra1g321	mm. arch seems to be the only distro ive checked so far that has fixed/resolved the recent php CVE's simply because it stays up to date, debian is vulnerble, ubuntu LTS has no update, suse, RH have no cve pages

2016-09-17 11:27:18	sudokode	also, it's much easier for arch to fix something like this than an LTS distro
2016-09-17 11:27:29	minimalism	Should drop PHP from the repositories is what you should do. Do some of that reactionary/boycotting whatever, except it'll actually have meaning instead of complaining about how Starbucks pissed you off.

2016-09-17 11:27:43	MrElendig	that doesn't say that RH closed it with "wontfix"
2016-09-17 11:27:47	sudokode	but LTS distros need to get it fixed because they're basically the web
2016-09-17 11:27:58	cra1g321	just surprised gentoo, suse, RH dont have any pages for it, and debian has no indication of fixing them

2016-09-17 22:38:07	deltasquared	I'm just wondering whether it would be worth encrypting the entire disk, or better still that AND a second layer for this particular partition
2016-09-17 22:38:10	serialoverflow	Boohbah: that is the old way, yes. but as far as i know, you can use a lightning cable directly to connect your apple earpods with the iphone 7 via lightning port
2016-09-17 22:38:13	Boohbah	alyptik: yakuake?
2016-09-17 22:38:23	serialoverflow	Boohbah: and in that case, where is the conversion to analogue?
2016-09-17 22:38:24	deltasquared	this volume will be holding "secret" data as it were, keys and the like

2016-09-17 22:40:42	deltasquared	I would have thought a pair of headphones connected via thunderbolt (which AFAIK apple wants to be their USB as it were) would present an audio device.
2016-09-17 22:41:04	deltasquared	as for where, well, apple magic? :P they seem to be pretty good at squeezing stuff in
2016-09-17 22:41:08	serialoverflow	Boohbah: i think it has to be in the headphones because the lightning cable can only transmit digital data

2016-09-18 02:54:21	mkoskar	e.g., only recently there was a change that the owner has strict liability for his/her car, so if there is photo of the car going over speed limit and it's not clear who is driving, owner is liable ... it wasn't the case till recently here, so if they haven't your face on picture, you could say "it wasn't me", they ask "who it was", you say "I refuse to say, because I could inflict on member of my

By contrast VP9 is open source and royalty free. It was developed by Google as a successor to VP8, the moderately successful alternative to H.264.

2016-09-18 15:06:47	phillid	I should find a clock to compare against that is equivalent of wall clock, but without skews
2016-09-18 15:07:33	phillid	So my multicore efficiency for this program is calculated by taking the total wall clock time of the job, and comparing that against the total of time each thread ran, in parallel
2016-09-18 15:07:55	phillid	So if 8 cores took 100s in parallel, you get 100s wall clock and 800s taken

2016-09-18 15:08:13	phillid	Assuming 100% efficiency
2016-09-18 15:08:29	phillid	Otherwise, you might have 100% wall and like 900s taken

2016-09-18 19:20:54	Kirito	For DAC playback
2016-09-18 19:21:08	Kirito	PulseAudio always molests audio in some manner no matter what
2016-09-18 19:21:14	Kirito	Even if you tell it to use S/PDIF
2016-09-18 19:21:17	Kirito	it will molest your audio
2016-09-18 19:21:35	Kirito	tl;dr pulseaudio is too stupid to use DAC's correctly
2016-09-18 19:23:41	Kirito	I actually never even realized this until one day I discovered that music from my Android device somehow sounded significantly better with my DAC than when streaming via my laptop, which made no sense
2016-09-18 19:23:51	Kirito	Then eventually figured out pulse was to blame for that
2016-09-18 19:24:51	Boohbah	That doesn't make sense.
2016-09-18 19:27:07	Kirito	What part doesn't?
2016-09-18 19:30:46	Boohbah	That pulseaudio is too stupid to use DACs correctly.
2016-09-18 19:31:35	Kirito	Why dosn't that make sense? You know what a DAC is right? And what Pulseaudio is for?
2016-09-18 19:31:45	Boohbah	It works for me.
2016-09-18 19:32:00	phillid	Aren't all soundcards dacs?
2016-09-18 19:32:08	Boohbah	Yeah.
2016-09-18 19:32:11	Kirito	Do you even have a DAC?
2016-09-18 19:32:25	phillid	I have several, if it stand fro Digital to Analogue convertor
2016-09-18 19:32:35	Boohbah	I have an USB sound card with 2 in, 2 out.
2016-09-18 19:32:45	Boohbah	It has two DACs and two ADCs.
2016-09-18 19:32:48	phillid	Yes
2016-09-18 19:32:50	Kirito	phillid, Yes, but you call soundcards soundcards and DAC's DAC's for a reason, it's marketing terminology
2016-09-18 19:33:02	phillid	Kirito, I don't
2016-09-18 19:33:13	Kirito	Boohbah, Yes, it "works", I never said it doesn't work, but it doesn't work as it should
2016-09-18 19:33:16	phillid	I have never heard of such a distinction
2016-09-18 19:33:20	Boohbah	It works fine.
2016-09-18 19:33:23	phillid	Are DACs different?
2016-09-18 19:33:29	Kirito	You're wrong but okay.
2016-09-18 19:33:48	Kirito	When using pulseaudio it will not send digital audio directly to the external DAC as it is supposed to
2016-09-18 19:34:04	minimalism	I'm adjusting to pure ALSA since gentoo
2016-09-18 19:34:10	minimalism	just have to add a softvol increase to go above 100%
2016-09-18 19:34:12	Kirito	Try playing back a decent uncompressed audio file with pulseaudio, then stream it directly to your DLC with alsa and compare the two
2016-09-18 19:34:20	Boohbah	What the hell is getting transmitted through my USB cable then?
2016-09-18 19:34:29	phillid	Boohbah, ghosts
2016-09-18 19:34:30	Kirito	molested audio, as I said
2016-09-18 19:34:53	Kirito	It's better than audio from your laptops soundcard for sure, but nowhere near as good as it could be
2016-09-18 19:34:54	Boohbah	That doesn't make sense, as I said.
2016-09-18 19:35:03	Kirito	It doesn't make sense because you can't understand it then
2016-09-18 19:35:16	phillid	Enlighten us
2016-09-18 19:35:16		[19:35]
2016-09-18 19:35:17	Boohbah	It is still digital audio. Do you mean it is downsampling it?
2016-09-18 19:35:34	Boohbah	Setup the right bit depth and sample rate.
2016-09-18 19:35:46	phillid	Just get vinyls bro
2016-09-18 19:35:53	Boohbah	Heh.
2016-09-18 19:36:09	minimalism	the real solution is pacman -Rns pulseaudio
2016-09-18 19:36:11	Kirito	I already did explain it above, not my problem if you're too incompetent to understand it
2016-09-18 19:36:57	Boohbah	Vinyls are cool and I have them, but I wouldn't call them "high fidelity".

2016-09-18 19:54:21	eto	anyway speaking of multiple sound cards - here is the tricky question - if you have multiple one after some time, they desync, how do you keep them ticking same?
2016-09-18 19:54:47	minimalism	My only issue with alsa from what I can see is that if you use an .asoundrc, it ignores the default alsa.conf, and it doesn't just add or override.
2016-09-18 19:55:05	eto	i saw some mods on net for old cards that you can wire up to sue same clocks, is there something modern you can sync together electrically and does it work over usb?

2016-09-18 20:14:57	mpan	eto: cheap, chinese 32.767kHz oscillators have error in range of hundreds of milliseconds per month. What error do you expect in a decent hardware during 10 minutes?
2016-09-18 20:14:57	Kirito	but the documentation says it's not well supported in most applications so I never bothered with it
2016-09-18 20:14:59	Kirito	Yeah, dmix
2016-09-18 20:15:00	alyptik	should be default nowadays

2016-09-18 20:16:12	eto	mpan: well i plan to mess with this one day - i for example read xruns can be serious problem under heavy load (eg when syntehtizer is maxing cpus so much they cannot deliver samples to cards in time)
2016-09-18 20:16:17	mpan	alyptik: but this is a different issue. You need to reset timers on under-/overrun, not just keep them in sync.
2016-09-18 20:16:54	Kirito	One thing I noticed recently
2016-09-18 20:17:16	alyptik	how do you know where to start up again? the rest of the audio keeps chugging along
2016-09-18 20:17:35	alyptik	if you never care about cracks/pops cool, but for most it's a big deal 
2016-09-18 20:17:40	Kirito	Is there's a large disparity between speexrate_medium and speexrate_best
2016-09-18 20:17:48	eto	also pci commands will arrive with some skew to devices i believe
2016-09-18 20:18:00	Kirito	Maybe there really isn't much of a difference between the two, but
2016-09-18 20:18:23	Kirito	speexrate_medium is basically a quality level of 5, while speexrate_best is 9 (or 10? I can't remember which, I think 9)
2016-09-18 20:18:36	eto	so syncing the cards, should make them "move" samle pointer at same time, no mpan ?
2016-09-18 20:18:41	eto	sample
2016-09-18 20:19:04	alyptik	muh speex
2016-09-18 20:19:14	mpan	Yes, indeed. But this doesn’t require their clocks to be nearly¹ perfectly synced (perfect syncing is physically impossible).
2016-09-18 20:19:15	Kirito	Seems like you should be able to drop the quality level down 1 or 2 and possibly significantly reduce CPU overhead while still improving quality, but I haven't actually bothered to try and compare the two

2016-09-18 20:19:49	alyptik	mpan: also "As a result, when using two cards at once one can have a real sample rate of 44.099 kHz in one card and a samplerate of 44.101 kHz in the other. This is no problem when recording with one card only, but the difference in the sample rates will cause phase shifts in the recording when using two cards. Phase shifts make the high frequencies of the recording e.g. cymbals sound bad.
2016-09-18 20:19:49	alyptik	Further, not all audio drivers can drive cards that are not in exact samplerate sync."

2016-09-18 20:23:18	mpan	alyptik: ±0.001kHz error in 10 minutes playback is few milliseconds. Even the best musicians can’t sync on so small scale and no one is able to hear that. The only case I would see this to be a problem, if one records stereo track with each channel going through a different card. Then indeed things would be totally messed up. But which sane person would do that?

2016-09-19 02:52:00	mpan	Well… machete is just a tool. Nothing suspicious in buying it. It’s just like one would buy an axe. I doubt anyone checks your ID when you buy an axe. The fact that hooligans are using it for fights is a different story.

2016-09-19 02:53:03	tetero	mpan: Technically sure, but the thing is that a machete is a tool for cutting in tropical climates and Poland isn't really that tropical :D

2016-09-19 13:03:23	phrik	BKC: In kinematics, absement is a measure of sustained displacement of an object from its initial position, i.e. a measure of how far away and for how long. Absement changes as an object remains displaced and stays constant as the object resides at the initial position. It is the first time-integral of the displacement, so the displacement is the rate of change of the absement. The (1 more message)

2016-09-19 13:03:54	phrik	BKC: dimension of absement is length multiplied by time. Its SI unit is meter second, which corresponds to an object having been displaced by 1 meter for 1 second. This is not to be confused with a meter per second, a unit of velocity, the time-derivative of position. (Wikipedia)

2016-09-19 19:09:46	Kirito	I still can't understand why alsa thinks it is justified in resampling my audio even when I'm telling it not to
2016-09-19 19:09:46	numero	Hi.
2016-09-19 19:10:27	alyptik	Default Sample Specification: s16le 2ch 44100Hz
2016-09-19 19:10:33	alyptik	happens to me too it seems
2016-09-19 19:10:50	Kirito	it seems to be dmix, even though I don't have it explicitly enabled
2016-09-19 19:10:56	Kirito	it just enabled it anyways, even though I don't want it
2016-09-19 19:11:22	alyptik	jack never resamples me thank god
2016-09-19 19:11:43	alyptik	then i guess it would be pointless to use if it did
2016-09-19 19:13:05	Kirito	Software that thinks it knows what you want better than you do is insanely annoying
2016-09-19 19:13:05		[19:13]
2016-09-19 19:13:41	alyptik	unless it does
2016-09-19 19:13:43	alyptik	like gcc
2016-09-19 19:14:52	Kirito	Linux manages to make achieving bit perfect audio sensationally difficult
2016-09-19 19:15:16	Kirito	You can nuke pulseaudio completely and you still have to wage war against alsa to prevent resampling
2016-09-19 19:15:34	alyptik	Kirito: easy solution: jack2-dbus
2016-09-19 19:15:48	Kirito	I'll look into jack >_>

2016-09-19 19:16:55	Kirito	http://audiokarma.org/forums/index.php?threads/stop-resampling-under-linux.575308/ lol get fucked
2016-09-19 19:17:36	Kirito	Apparently that's the only way to accomplish this, you have to jump through 4 different hoops to trick Alsa into doing what you want
2016-09-19 19:18:06	alyptik	or set sample rate with qjackctl
2016-09-19 19:18:07	alyptik	ez
2016-09-19 19:18:08	Kirito	By using a fake plugin to override dmix
2016-09-19 19:18:10	mnrmnaugh	alsa is pretty gunky imo
2016-09-19 19:19:54	Kirito	I've never used jack before and am largely unfamiliar with it. I have no doubt it will probably make my life worlds easier though >_>

2016-09-20 05:00:19	voidead	mnrmnaugh› so I found out that if you have a fallback symbol font (such as Symbola for example) your fallback font has to be configured to display at a smaller size than your main font or else it won't show up

2016-09-20 05:06:04	mnrmnaugh	the first one reminds me of whatever rediculous font i have... i see horrid blockiness in hexchat all dae
2016-09-20 05:06:17	voidead	ST has a similar setup as urxvt.. but works better.. you'll never see blocks but you'll just see something like "    " where the symbol should be
2016-09-20 05:06:24	mkoskar	it's urxvt limitation, I think it's documented somewhere and I was reading it (maybe man 7 urxvt) ... it has it's own strict box model
2016-09-20 05:06:47	mnrmnaugh	so, maybe its not actually using the font you told it?
2016-09-20 05:07:05	voidead	mnrmnaugh› well st has changed its setting to use fallback fonts too
