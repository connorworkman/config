2016-10-27 17:07:27	Cannon	[22:07:14] if I remove Whitelisting IP addresses to my wordpress site, and only have 2 factor authentication to the login page, is this secure? [22:07:14]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	 *	phillw [22:21:25] is having loads of fun, I will not flood this channel as I have my own. I'm re-purposing a pi2 to be a print server with a static ipV4 address using WiFi and not ethernet... the channel is my name and swift110[m] comes and asks me on here, so I'm not poaching people! [22:21:25]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	Mathias	[22:21:29] Cannon: it's wordpress [22:21:29]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	Mathias	[22:22:29] phillw: well, the irc protocol allows people to be in multiple channels, for some weird reason [22:22:29]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	Mathias	[22:22:46] so it's not technically poaching [22:22:46]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	Cannon	[22:23:08] Mathias, meaning its not secure? [22:23:08]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	phillw	[22:23:20] Mathias: stop being so cruel, there are some fairly decent security things you can bolt on to FailPress.... :P [22:23:20]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	Mathias	[22:23:54] Cannon: just make sure to harden it properly [22:23:54]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	Cannon	[22:24:30] Mathias, well I have Cloudproxy, Sucuri, Two Factor Authentication, Firewall, Whitelisted IP's etc at the moment [22:24:30]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	phillw	[22:24:39] Cannon: you can have security things added, but the major one is that who ever runs it installs the updates a.s.a.p. (Or, as we decided.. have security updates install them selves). [22:24:39]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	Mathias	[22:25:07] Cannon: should be ok [22:25:07]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	Mathias	[22:25:44] but remember that wordpress probably has a lot of holes and is attacked really often [22:25:44]

2016-10-27 22:29:51	Mathias	[22:21:29] Cannon: it's wordpress [22:21:29]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Mathias	[22:22:29] phillw: well, the irc protocol allows people to be in multiple channels, for some weird reason [22:22:29]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Mathias	[22:22:46] so it's not technically poaching [22:22:46]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Cannon	[22:23:08] Mathias, meaning its not secure? [22:23:08]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	phillw	[22:23:20] Mathias: stop being so cruel, there are some fairly decent security things you can bolt on to FailPress.... :P [22:23:20]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Mathias	[22:23:54] Cannon: just make sure to harden it properly [22:23:54]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Cannon	[22:24:30] Mathias, well I have Cloudproxy, Sucuri, Two Factor Authentication, Firewall, Whitelisted IP's etc at the moment [22:24:30]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	phillw	[22:24:39] Cannon: you can have security things added, but the major one is that who ever runs it installs the updates a.s.a.p. (Or, as we decided.. have security updates install them selves). [22:24:39]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Mathias	[22:25:07] Cannon: should be ok [22:25:07]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Mathias	[22:25:44] but remember that wordpress probably has a lot of holes and is attacked really often [22:25:44]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	phillw	[22:26:28] Cannon: the kernel was found to have a 7 year old bug that linus himself buggered up. No one and nothing is perfect, just linux is faster off the blocks to fix things. [22:26:28]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Cannon	[22:27:41] kernal? [22:27:41]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	phillw	[22:27:55] Mathias: and Cannon are either you from UK ? [22:27:55]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Cannon	[22:27:59] USA [22:27:59]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	phillw	[22:28:35] cannon try to access http://cyac.eu/ [22:28:35]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Mathias	[22:28:46] you could say everything is holey :p [22:28:46]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	phillw	[22:28:48] it should block you. [22:28:48]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Mathias	[22:28:58] but the amount of holes is another matter [22:28:58]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	phillw	[22:29:32] Mathias: and the amount of people looking at them for good reasons and not bad, is also a massive reason. [22:29:32]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Cannon	[22:30:14] I can access it phillw [22:30:14]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	phillw	[22:30:16] Mathias: if not UK, that address ^^ should also block you. [22:30:16]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	phillw	[22:30:42] Cannon: okies, thanks for telling me.... I'll let Rafael know. [22:30:42]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	phillw	[22:33:08] Cannon: you can understand why the attempt to geo-lock was made. Determined people can spoof IPv4's but it should deter. [22:33:08]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Mathias	[22:35:40] just make it v6-only :p [22:35:40]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	phillw	[22:35:43] Well, that'll keep him out mischief over the weekend :) [22:35:43]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Mathias	[22:35:59] should deter most attackers [22:35:59]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	phillw	[22:37:40] Mathias: the people in my village are just about used to the fact we have fibre to cabinet instead of dial up!!! I reckon I have immediate access more computer in this house than whole of the village!!! [22:37:40]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	phillw	[22:40:08] oooh , reboot needed on my pi2 .... I'll update on #phillw as I will need to pull the logs to make a write up as to how much 'fun' it all was!! [22:40:08]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	phillw	[22:40:22] have fun, guys! [22:40:22]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Mathias	[22:40:42] hah, ftth! [22:40:42]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Cannon	[22:40:45] Mathias, the problem is on v6 my ip keeps changing [22:40:45]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Cannon	[22:40:47] so i cant whitelist [22:40:47]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Mathias	[22:41:06] i can even use my own gear on the fibre :o [22:41:06]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Mathias	[22:41:33] Cannon: don't you have a range? [22:41:33]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Cannon	[22:41:48] yeh but it didnt seem to be working with /24 [22:41:48]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Cannon	[23:04:54] Mathias, I asked my ISP and they said "It's public we don't have a range here "? [23:04:54]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Cannon	[23:05:39] is that a BS answer? [23:05:39]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Mathias	[23:06:35] that answer does not make any sense [23:06:35]

2016-10-27 22:29:51	Cannon	[23:07:41] Is there a site that can find the range? [23:07:41]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Cannon	[23:09:57] Mathias, yeh I think they are BSing me [23:09:57]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Cannon	[23:10:01] Is there a good way to find the range? [23:10:01]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Mathias	[23:11:03] it depends on your setup [23:11:03]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Mathias	[23:11:46] but sounds like you have a dynamic v6 [23:11:46]
2016-10-27 22:29:51	Cannon	[23:13:31] I wish they would just give me a static IP but they said not for residential clients [23:13:31]
