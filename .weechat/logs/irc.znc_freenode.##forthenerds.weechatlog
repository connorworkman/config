2016-10-27 09:06:41	ChinnoDog	Only if you are going by the maxim that poor people own the most expensive things. Chihuahua doesn't each much food or produce much waste or destroy my apartment as much as a big dog would.
2016-10-27 09:07:16	ChinnoDog	Nah. It needs a harness but it is currently so small that even its extra small collar is too big.
