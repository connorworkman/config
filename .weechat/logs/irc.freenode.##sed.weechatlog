2016-09-13 14:51:15	alyptik	eyeamaye: it matches nothing but also does nothing
2016-09-13 14:51:20	alyptik	so sed prints input
2016-09-13 14:51:53	alyptik	you prob want sed -n
2016-09-13 14:52:48	eyeamaye	alyptik, what i'm actually trying to do is do a replace… just trying to understand the syntax to do what i need first.
2016-09-13 14:52:55	eyeamaye	earlier today i figured out how to do this
2016-09-13 14:53:13	alyptik	ah ok so what you did was a regex match then if it matches do 'p'
2016-09-13 14:53:14	eyeamaye	sed -i -- 's/2016\/08\/\(.*.\)png/\/201608\/\1jpg/g' text
2016-09-13 14:53:27	eyeamaye	that solves one of my problems
2016-09-13 14:53:31	alyptik	eyeamaye:www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html
2016-09-13 14:53:34	eyeamaye	but now my next one is a lot harder
2016-09-13 14:53:47	alyptik	best guide i've ever seen on sed
2016-09-13 14:53:56	eyeamaye	i've been reading through this
2016-09-13 14:54:19	eyeamaye	what im trying to do right now though is
2016-09-13 14:55:11	eyeamaye	logo-test-32x14.png
2016-09-13 14:55:11	eyeamaye	test-7-300x225.png
2016-09-13 14:55:11	eyeamaye	and replace to
2016-09-13 14:55:11	eyeamaye	logo-test-32x14.jpg
2016-09-13 14:55:11	eyeamaye	test-7-300x225.jpg
2016-09-13 14:55:28	eyeamaye	maybe i shouldn't be using sed for this though.
2016-09-13 14:55:36	eyeamaye	need to do some 10k replaces
2016-09-13 14:55:42	eyeamaye	so manually fixing definitely isn't an option
2016-09-13 14:56:17	alyptik	sed -i -- 's/2016\/08\/\(.*.\)png/\/201608\/\1jpg/g;s/\(.*\)\.png/\1.jpg/' text
2016-09-13 14:56:42	alyptik	semicolon seperates commands
2016-09-13 14:56:54	eyeamaye	oh sweet, good to know
2016-09-13 14:57:02	eyeamaye	i need to run like 5 different commands total
2016-09-13 14:57:07	eyeamaye	so that should be helpful
2016-09-13 14:57:18	alyptik	yeah but once you get syntax down it'll be done without even thinking
2016-09-13 14:57:26	eyeamaye	but uh
2016-09-13 14:57:35	alyptik	i sed everything when i should prob be using awk
2016-09-13 14:57:37	alyptik	lol
2016-09-13 14:58:03	eyeamaye	are you sure /\(.*\)\.png/\1.jpg/ is a good way to match that?
2016-09-13 14:58:24	eyeamaye	for some reason i was thinking i needed to match the groups of numbers
2016-09-13 14:58:28	eyeamaye	i was trying something like this lol
2016-09-13 14:58:41	alyptik	eyeamaye: yeah it is fine, you could use something instead of .* but i can't think of a case it would fail 
2016-09-13 14:58:56	alyptik	unless you have a filename with .png.png
2016-09-13 14:58:59	eyeamaye	's/\(.[0-9]*-\(.[0-9]*.\)\)png/\1\2jpg/g'
2016-09-13 14:59:03	eyeamaye	which did nothing
2016-09-13 14:59:27	eyeamaye	err wait
2016-09-13 14:59:34	eyeamaye	this is the one i tried that was most "complete"
2016-09-13 14:59:35	eyeamaye	's/\(.*\(.[0-9]*-\(.[0-9]\).\)\)png/\1\2\3jpg/g'
2016-09-13 14:59:41	alyptik	because test isn't a match for .[0-9]*
2016-09-13 14:59:52	alyptik	and that last one works too
2016-09-13 14:59:57	eyeamaye	oh really?
2016-09-13 15:00:03	eyeamaye	so i'm just executing it wrong?
2016-09-13 15:00:11	alyptik	oh you still need 2 commands
2016-09-13 15:00:21	alyptik	i thought that was your 2nd command
2016-09-13 15:00:48	eyeamaye	though actually
2016-09-13 15:00:56	eyeamaye	i found [0-9]* isn't what i wanted
2016-09-13 15:00:58	eyeamaye	i actually want
2016-09-13 15:01:03	eyeamaye	[0-9]\+
2016-09-13 15:01:04	eyeamaye	's/\(.*\(.[0-9]\+-\(.[0-9]\+\).\)\)png/\1\2\3jpg/g'
2016-09-13 15:01:20	alyptik	why escape the +?
2016-09-13 15:01:25	eyeamaye	uh
2016-09-13 15:01:36	eyeamaye	i think that's what the link you sent me said to do
2016-09-13 15:01:39	eyeamaye	let me double check
2016-09-13 15:01:42	eyeamaye	but the + is for
2016-09-13 15:01:44	eyeamaye	one or more matches
2016-09-13 15:01:49	alyptik	+ only works with sed -r
2016-09-13 15:02:02	eyeamaye	oh...
2016-09-13 15:02:02		[15:02]
2016-09-13 15:02:13	eyeamaye	hmm
2016-09-13 15:02:23	eyeamaye	so i need to learn what this -n and -r flag are
2016-09-13 15:02:34	eyeamaye	that's probably why they don't work
2016-09-13 15:02:34	eyeamaye	but
2016-09-13 15:02:38	eyeamaye	let me try the one you proposed
2016-09-13 15:02:42	alyptik	-n is no print, -r is extended regex
2016-09-13 15:02:45	eyeamaye	and see if i can remember why i didn't think i was able to use that.
2016-09-13 15:03:02	eyeamaye	oh okay
2016-09-13 15:03:07	eyeamaye	thanks
2016-09-13 15:03:08	alyptik	eyeamaye: with r you need to unescape (
2016-09-13 15:03:16	alyptik	the rules are fuckier
2016-09-13 15:03:17	eyeamaye	unescape?

2016-09-13 15:04:33	eyeamaye	ah okay
2016-09-13 15:04:36	alyptik	some distros use older sed

2016-09-13 15:04:43	alyptik	but if it's just for you you can use -r

2016-09-13 15:17:47	eyeamaye	alyptik: so at what point does sed kinda fall off and you need to be using awk or perl?
2016-09-13 15:17:47		[15:17]
2016-09-13 15:18:11	eyeamaye	im not good with any of them, but i've used sed more than the others
2016-09-13 15:18:48	alyptik	when you get to the point where you are using like 3 labels and 10 backreferences to do something
2016-09-13 15:18:59	alyptik	then you should take a step back lol
2016-09-13 15:19:44	eyeamaye	lol
2016-09-13 15:19:56	eyeamaye	backreferences are uh, () and \1 right?
2016-09-13 15:20:00	alyptik	yeah
2016-09-13 15:20:26	eyeamaye	i read that awk doesn't have anything akin to backreferences though?
2016-09-13 15:21:30	alyptik	you just use regex to replace 
2016-09-13 15:22:05	alyptik	and print relevant fields
2016-09-13 15:22:35	alyptik	my awk is admittedly not that great though
2016-09-13 15:22:56	eyeamaye	from my limited understanding of the 3
2016-09-13 15:23:13	eyeamaye	i feel like it makes the most sense to be good with sed and perl
2016-09-13 15:23:21	eyeamaye	and awk is just a 3rd wheel :3
2016-09-13 15:23:49	alyptik	heh 
2016-09-13 15:24:16	alyptik	yeah I always preferred sed

2016-09-13 15:25:47	eyeamaye	yeah no doubt

2016-09-13 22:18:43	Soliton	a and b are labels to branch to.
2016-09-13 22:20:27	stevenm_	Soliton, yeah I've figured that much with a lot of head scratching... trouble is I couldn't tell the difference between which { and } are sed's stuff and which are the original file
2016-09-13 22:20:35	stevenm_	Soliton, and which b's are labels and which b's are actually options lol
2016-09-13 22:20:50	stevenm_	I've simplified it a bit to help me understand
2016-09-13 22:20:50	stevenm_	# printf 'block-start\n\tmeow\nblock-end\nblock-start\n\tfoo = bar\n\txyz \nblock-end\n' | sed '/block-start/{ :START; /block-end/bEND; N; bSTART; :END; /foo = bar/!b; s/^/# /; s/\n/&# /g; }'

2016-09-13 22:21:14	stevenm_	yeah but I didn't know about labels - or that b jumps to labels
2016-09-13 22:21:37	stevenm_	and he used b also as a label name!
2016-09-13 22:22:04	stevenm_	i'm grateful to him, don't get me wrong - but I was hoping to understand too
2016-09-13 22:22:20	Soliton	if you come in with a foo and bar question i don't think you can complain about a and b labels. :-)
2016-09-13 22:22:34	stevenm_	foo, bar, qux and baz !

2016-09-13 22:46:55	stevenm_	Soliton, ok so the bit that says /block-end/  surely after that (since it just found where the end is) it should say :END not bEND (as it'd be marking where the end is? no?)
2016-09-13 22:47:55	stevenm_	if anything it says find the end, jump to the end (already at it?), go back to the start, then mark that as the end
2016-09-13 22:53:00		[22:47]
2016-09-13 23:02:09	go|dfish	:END is defining the end label
2016-09-13 23:02:41	go|dfish	so /block-end/bEND means jump to the END label when /block-end/ matches

2016-09-14 09:46:40	garbageyard	In bash, if i have to replace 1st and 3rd occurence of dot (.) char in /etc/hosts file with # sign, why do i need to use "sed -e 's/\./#/' -e 's/\./#/2' /etc/hosts" instead of "sed -e 's/\./#/' -e 's/\./#/3' /etc/hosts" ?
2016-09-14 09:48:38	larryv	doesn't have anything to do with bash. same would happen under any shell
2016-09-14 09:49:06	larryv	after the first substitution, the first period is gone
2016-09-14 09:49:18	larryv	so to the second substitution, the third period is the second period
2016-09-14 09:51:18	garbageyard	Ok but does it has anything to do with buffer?
2016-09-14 09:51:47	larryv	there's no context here, so "buffer" is meaningless
2016-09-14 09:52:08	larryv	but no

2016-09-14 20:47:32	lindylex	geirha: let me try.
2016-09-14 20:47:34	geirha	and every line has a leading space, so there are no empty lines
2016-09-14 20:47:48	geirha	actually, it was old mac endings; \r instead of \n

2016-09-15 13:58:54	izalove	just open the file in a text editor and edit it like a normal person
2016-09-15 13:59:36	sift	yes, if it was for one server. I have 100 servers to put it on.
2016-09-15 14:00:24	izalove	edit it once then deploy it?
2016-09-15 14:00:51	izalove	"no it has to be done in production so i have to edit a sed script with sed and i don't know sed"
2016-09-15 14:01:34	sift	the file in question has different commands, ips and hosts, so no.
2016-09-15 14:03:27	izalove	whatever...   write a sed script with no escapes, upload it to each server and then run     ssh user@server sed -i -f myscript myfile

2016-10-02 10:23:41	hush_	hey i have this file: http://pastebin.com/7Tt6CdeU
2016-10-02 10:24:20	hush_	trying to print the first occurence of everything between 'New Question' and 'Answer'
2016-10-02 10:24:24	hush_	i just can't figure it out
2016-10-02 10:24:52	hush_	it should be as simple as sed -n '/New\ Question/,/Answer/p'
2016-10-02 10:24:58	hush_	but that prints the whole file
2016-10-02 10:25:53	Riviera	hush_: 4.24. How do I address all the lines between RE1 and RE2, excluding the lines themselves?
2016-10-02 10:25:59	Riviera	hush_: that's what you're after, right?
2016-10-02 10:27:08	Riviera	hush_: The link to the FAQ (which includes that question) is in the topic, additionally note that a space is not special in sed, so don't escape it.
2016-10-02 10:27:08		[10:27]
2016-10-02 10:27:57	hush_	i don't even want to remove the matched range lines
2016-10-02 10:28:07	hush_	just stop after the first END keyword
2016-10-02 10:28:55	hush_	even sed -n '/New Question,MC/,/Answer: 1/p'
2016-10-02 10:29:04	hush_	still matches all the way down to 'Answer: 2'
2016-10-02 10:29:10	hush_	i feel like i'm missing something obvious

2016-10-02 10:43:42	Riviera	hush_: You should notice that it is not "all the way down" because the line between "Answer: 1" and the next "New Question,MC" line is not printed (the empty line is not printed).
2016-10-02 10:44:41	hush_	it looks like it prints when it matches, but also prints when there is no match
2016-10-02 10:44:50	hush_	sed -n '/New Question,MC$/{:a;N;/Answer.*/!ba;p}'
2016-10-02 10:44:55	Riviera	hush_: there is a match
2016-10-02 10:45:19	Riviera	hush_: a range starts with the match and ends when the second pattern matches,
2016-10-02 10:45:22	hush_	this one works if i specify 'Answer: 1' but i need it to stop completely after the first time matching the range
2016-10-02 10:45:33	Riviera	hush_: the second pattern does not match so the range does not end.
2016-10-02 10:45:42	hush_	ok
2016-10-02 10:45:46	hush_	i got it actually
2016-10-02 10:45:50	hush_	sed -n '/New Question,MC$/{:a;N;/Answer.*/!ba;p;q}'
2016-10-02 10:46:07	hush_	that stops when the second regex is matched for the first time
