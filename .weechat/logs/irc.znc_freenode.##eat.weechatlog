2016-10-20 09:59:57	@elky	traditionally? your cheapest white sliced bread with butter or margerine, topped with cake sprinkles
2016-10-20 10:01:19	@Hamburgero	so for us yanks wonderbread, land o'lakes butter and sprinkles
2016-10-20 10:05:12	@elky	it's a children's party food
2016-10-20 10:06:05	@elky	less sugar and effort than cake with almost as much gratitude from kids 6 and under
2016-10-20 10:06:27	@Hamburgero	we had something similar in the south (florida i guess) breat butter sugar and cinnamon
2016-10-20 10:06:57	@Hamburgero	sometimes it would be toasted/broiled along with the butter if you went really fancy
2016-10-20 10:07:02	@elky	bread butter and scant toppings i think was quite a common thing after ww2
2016-10-20 10:08:09	@Hamburgero	poverty french toast
2016-10-20 10:08:10	@Hamburgero	heh
2016-10-20 10:09:40	@elky	a common poor people food in aus is cheap bread, a slick of cheap mayonnaise, a slice of store brand "chicken" lunch meat, and a piece of "plastic cheese"/kraft singles
2016-10-20 10:09:40		[10:09]
2016-10-20 10:10:22	@hoglahoo	that sounds pretty desperate :(
2016-10-20 10:11:45	@Hamburgero	ah
2016-10-20 10:12:00	@Hamburgero	same thing in the us but with balogna or ham
2016-10-20 10:14:12	@Hamburgero	i'm going to make some hella fairy bread this weekend lol
2016-10-20 10:16:14	@elky	well... "chicken" lunchmeat is about 10 times more awful and usually cheaper than bologna/devon
2016-10-20 10:16:51	@Peng	Can food be ten times as awful as convenience store ham?
2016-10-20 10:16:54	@elky	bologna goes with a tomato sauce which isn't quite like ketchup but close enough to
2016-10-20 10:17:42	@elky	Peng: reformed "chicken" which is probably 60% filler/starch/gum and garlic/onion powder.
2016-10-20 10:17:53	@elky	which you then broil in the concoction i mentioned
2016-10-20 10:18:12	@elky	with mayo and basically government cheese
2016-10-20 10:18:52	@Peng	D:
2016-10-20 10:20:19	@elky	literally the chicken version of bologna
2016-10-20 10:20:25	@elky	if that exists here
2016-10-20 10:20:31	@elky	i can't eat that stuff anymore so i have no clue
2016-10-20 10:22:13	@elky	apparently yes http://viennameatfish.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Chicken-Bologna.jpg
2016-10-20 10:22:14	@Hamburgero	hmm we dont have 100 and 1000s in the US
2016-10-20 10:22:18	@Hamburgero	not easily available
2016-10-20 10:22:55	@elky	Hamburgero: funfetti is comparable
2016-10-20 10:23:36	@elky	it's not like most people use the brand name "100s and 1000s" anyway, they get whatever is the cheapest sprinkle in the desired color/s
2016-10-20 10:24:33	@elky	Hamburgero: over here the pretty much exact thing gets sold as non-pariels

2016-10-20 10:26:03	@elky	but i'd use funfetti because fondant sprinkles are less crunchy
2016-10-20 10:26:25	@elky	non-pariels are kind of a bad idea for bad teeth
2016-10-20 10:26:41	@Hamburgero	right
2016-10-20 10:26:54	@elky	they're the size of poppyseeds
2016-10-20 10:27:15	@Hamburgero	soft bread and the butter should interact with crunch of the funfetti
2016-10-20 10:27:57	@elky	yeah, non-pariels are pretty hard, funfetti should be enough if it doesn't sit around for too long

2016-10-27 11:50:35	DrCate	it was like "Apologies, here... taco."
2016-10-27 11:56:00		[11:50]
2016-10-27 11:58:52	@MacGyver	DrCate: So next time you go, make sure they take too long on the order of the free taco.
2016-10-27 11:58:59	@MacGyver	DrCate: Perpetual free food.
2016-10-27 11:59:24	DrCate	ikr
2016-10-27 12:00:13	DrCate	there is one shift that can't count, and will make one too many of something, they will just toss it in my bag instead >_>
2016-10-27 12:00:42	@hoglahoo	I used to deliver pizza - easiest scam ever is to order pizza for delivery, then donâ€™t answer the door when the driver arrives.  call the store an hour later to say you never got the pizza and get a free one sent :P
2016-10-27 12:01:02	@hoglahoo	well maybe not easiest ever.  but easy
2016-10-27 12:01:10	DrCate	ah you just reminded me
2016-10-27 12:01:10	@MacGyver	hoglahoo: Surely after two or three times, they'll catch on.
2016-10-27 12:01:27	DrCate	i need to call newspaper and complain about my last two sunday papers not being delivered
2016-10-27 12:01:52	@hoglahoo	MacGyver: maybe, maybe not :)
2016-10-27 12:03:29	@hoglahoo	especially during busy hours - management where I worked was more than happy to solve a problem customer with a free pizza or two rather than drop what theyâ€™re doing to contest an issue
