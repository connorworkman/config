2016-10-20 09:59:57	@elky	traditionally? your cheapest white sliced bread with butter or margerine, topped with cake sprinkles
2016-10-20 10:01:19	@Hamburgero	so for us yanks wonderbread, land o'lakes butter and sprinkles
2016-10-20 10:05:12	@elky	it's a children's party food
2016-10-20 10:06:05	@elky	less sugar and effort than cake with almost as much gratitude from kids 6 and under
2016-10-20 10:06:27	@Hamburgero	we had something similar in the south (florida i guess) breat butter sugar and cinnamon
2016-10-20 10:06:57	@Hamburgero	sometimes it would be toasted/broiled along with the butter if you went really fancy
2016-10-20 10:07:02	@elky	bread butter and scant toppings i think was quite a common thing after ww2
2016-10-20 10:08:09	@Hamburgero	poverty french toast
2016-10-20 10:08:10	@Hamburgero	heh
2016-10-20 10:09:40	@elky	a common poor people food in aus is cheap bread, a slick of cheap mayonnaise, a slice of store brand "chicken" lunch meat, and a piece of "plastic cheese"/kraft singles
2016-10-20 10:09:40		[10:09]
2016-10-20 10:10:22	@hoglahoo	that sounds pretty desperate :(
2016-10-20 10:11:45	@Hamburgero	ah
2016-10-20 10:12:00	@Hamburgero	same thing in the us but with balogna or ham
2016-10-20 10:14:12	@Hamburgero	i'm going to make some hella fairy bread this weekend lol
2016-10-20 10:16:14	@elky	well... "chicken" lunchmeat is about 10 times more awful and usually cheaper than bologna/devon
2016-10-20 10:16:51	@Peng	Can food be ten times as awful as convenience store ham?
2016-10-20 10:16:54	@elky	bologna goes with a tomato sauce which isn't quite like ketchup but close enough to
2016-10-20 10:17:42	@elky	Peng: reformed "chicken" which is probably 60% filler/starch/gum and garlic/onion powder.
2016-10-20 10:17:53	@elky	which you then broil in the concoction i mentioned
2016-10-20 10:18:12	@elky	with mayo and basically government cheese
2016-10-20 10:18:52	@Peng	D:
2016-10-20 10:20:19	@elky	literally the chicken version of bologna
2016-10-20 10:20:25	@elky	if that exists here
2016-10-20 10:20:31	@elky	i can't eat that stuff anymore so i have no clue
2016-10-20 10:22:13	@elky	apparently yes http://viennameatfish.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Chicken-Bologna.jpg
2016-10-20 10:22:14	@Hamburgero	hmm we dont have 100 and 1000s in the US
2016-10-20 10:22:18	@Hamburgero	not easily available
2016-10-20 10:22:55	@elky	Hamburgero: funfetti is comparable
2016-10-20 10:23:36	@elky	it's not like most people use the brand name "100s and 1000s" anyway, they get whatever is the cheapest sprinkle in the desired color/s
2016-10-20 10:24:33	@elky	Hamburgero: over here the pretty much exact thing gets sold as non-pariels
2016-10-20 10:25:14	@elky	for example https://cakeart.com/Non-Pareils-4-OZ-Mixed-Colors-78-520M/?gclid=CjwKEAjw1qHABRDU9qaXs4rtiS0SJADNzJis5bXFgo2yVsfnYpLoCfqW-AgQ5CK3JH5Ma3gNzs5moRoCQM3w_wcB

2016-10-20 10:25:26	@Hamburgero	ah cool
2016-10-20 10:26:03	@elky	but i'd use funfetti because fondant sprinkles are less crunchy
2016-10-20 10:26:25	@elky	non-pariels are kind of a bad idea for bad teeth
2016-10-20 10:26:41	@Hamburgero	right
2016-10-20 10:26:54	@elky	they're the size of poppyseeds
2016-10-20 10:27:15	@Hamburgero	soft bread and the butter should interact with crunch of the funfetti
2016-10-20 10:27:57	@elky	yeah, non-pariels are pretty hard, funfetti should be enough if it doesn't sit around for too long

2016-10-31 11:33:45	@libbies	not really, they're not that hot
2016-10-31 11:34:10	@hoglaboo	why is salmon at the asian mart only 5.99/lb but it’s like 12 - 15 everywhere else around here

2016-10-31 11:35:48	@libbies	eh
2016-10-31 11:36:01	@libbies	it might be less about cutting corners and more about what consumers want
2016-10-31 11:36:11	@libbies	american consumers tend to want leaner cuts/etc.
2016-10-31 11:36:15	@hoglaboo	well thats true
2016-10-31 11:36:18	@libbies	because fat is seen as unhealthy
2016-10-31 11:36:34	@hoglaboo	and it was a pretty fatty piece of fish

2016-10-31 16:21:00	@libbies	[21:33:45] not really, they're not that hot [21:33:45]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	@hoglaboo	[21:34:10] why is salmon at the asian mart only 5.99/lb but it’s like 12 - 15 everywhere else around here [21:34:10]

2016-10-31 16:21:00	@libbies	[21:35:01] i think it's probably quality rather than the others [21:35:01]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	@hoglaboo	[21:35:14] yeah surely they’re cutting corners somewhere [21:35:14]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	@libbies	[21:35:48] eh [21:35:48]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	@libbies	[21:36:01] it might be less about cutting corners and more about what consumers want [21:36:01]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	@libbies	[21:36:11] american consumers tend to want leaner cuts/etc. [21:36:11]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	@hoglaboo	[21:36:15] well thats true [21:36:15]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	@libbies	[21:36:18] because fat is seen as unhealthy [21:36:18]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	@hoglaboo	[21:36:34] and it was a pretty fatty piece of fish [21:36:34]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	@libbies	[21:36:36] while asian people might care less and might buy the less 'desirable' cut [21:36:36]
2016-10-31 16:21:00	@libbies	[21:38:01] certainly the purchasers at each have their own desires as well too [21:38:01]

2016-11-03 14:30:18	@elky	she peeled large potatos and just chopped them in thick slices then dumped them in far too much oil in a dish in the oven.

2016-11-04 14:10:46	@elky	[00:24:07] and no i don't know why we need 3 meats for 5 people. [00:24:07]
2016-11-04 14:10:46	@elky	[00:25:44] and the only reason there's 3 pies is because otherwise she would spend $40 to fucking preorder at least a pumpkin pie from her local supermarket and then act surprised when i can't eat it. [00:25:44]
2016-11-04 14:10:46	@Boohbah	[00:28:06] What's a potato-flavored hockey puck supposed to be? [00:28:06]
2016-11-04 14:10:46	@elky	[00:28:33] it was potato that had been cooked in a puddle of oil for about 45 minutes longer than necessary [00:28:33]
2016-11-04 14:10:46	@elky	[00:30:18] she peeled large potatos and just chopped them in thick slices then dumped them in far too much oil in a dish in the oven. [00:30:18]
2016-11-04 14:10:46	@elky	[00:30:31] they were black on both sides. [00:30:31]

2016-11-04 14:10:46	@elky	[00:34:31] it was on the dark side of milk chocolate colored in reality [00:34:31]
2016-11-04 14:10:46	@elky	[00:34:45] so effectively blackened by most people's standards [00:34:45]

2016-11-04 14:10:46	@elky	[00:41:41] i believe FIL has decided we are going to a rich people's golf course resort type place for their xmas dinner buffet because he likes showing off and i guess doesn't want to have to do both thanksgiving and xmas. [00:41:41]
2016-11-04 14:10:46	@elky	[00:45:01] i can't say i'm pleased about that. the last time we went there they didn't label allergens and i had to ask about each thing and wait ages for the attendants to go check with the chef :( [00:45:01]
2016-11-04 14:10:46	@libbies	[00:47:08] buffets are impossible though [00:47:08]

2016-11-04 14:10:46	shinycat	[02:19:52] when i was growing up it was years before i found out that pickles werent something entirely different [02:19:52]
2016-11-04 14:10:46	@elky	[02:54:45] libbies: rich people buffets (like a bain-marie of food every few feet) are quite a bit less of an issue than your regular person buffet, but yes, my parents in law are kind of too self absorbed to understand that i literally am making myself sick to make them happy. [02:54:45]
2016-11-04 14:10:46	@libbies	[02:55:30] no buffet is safe from contamination :( [02:55:30]
2016-11-04 14:10:46	@elky	[02:55:38] i'm aware [02:55:38]
2016-11-04 14:10:46	@elky	[02:58:34] i'm fortunate to not be significantly impacted by contamination like some other celiacs [02:58:34]
2016-11-04 14:10:46	@libbies	[02:59:51] there's probably to be said about damage that you're not immediately realizing the impact of :x [02:59:51]

2016-11-04 16:45:19	@elky	[00:36:59] the pumpkin pie turned out ok. it's supposed to be just-barely-set-basically-pudding in the middle right? [00:36:59]
2016-11-04 16:45:19	@Boohbah	[00:42:09] Yeah. But did you know that canned pumpkin is not actually pumpkin? [00:42:09]
2016-11-04 16:45:19	@elky	[00:42:28] what butternut squash? [00:42:28]
2016-11-04 16:45:19	@Boohbah	[00:42:38] Yeah. [00:42:38]
2016-11-04 16:45:19	@elky	[00:42:46] that's pumpkin where i'm from :P [00:42:46]
2016-11-04 16:45:19	@Boohbah	[00:42:57] These fresh walnuts have some nice oil that store bought walnuts lack [00:42:57]
2016-11-04 16:45:19	@Boohbah	[00:43:02] But they are tough. [00:43:02]
2016-11-04 16:45:19	@Boohbah	[00:43:06] Tough to crack. [00:43:06]
2016-11-04 16:45:19	@Boohbah	[00:43:30] Sweet oily nut meats. :) [00:43:30]
2016-11-04 16:45:19	@elky	[00:43:46] oh yeah fresh walnuts are amazing [00:43:46]
2016-11-04 16:45:19	@Boohbah	[00:44:39] Pecans are good too and good in a pie, but I think walnut is the best nut. [00:44:39]
2016-11-04 16:45:19	@elky	[00:46:22] i find pecans can be too oily to eat on their own [00:46:22]

2016-11-05 00:17:18	@elky	[01:13:09] while looking for recipes for the pie i also came across http://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/2011/11/21/no-bake-chocolate-pumpkin-pie/ [01:13:09]
