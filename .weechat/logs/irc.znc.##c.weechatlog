2016-09-15 22:15:41	twkm	scanf and printf aren't exact mirrors.  scanf needs pointer to float for its %f, but printf just needs a double (not a pointer to a double) to which the float will be promoted.  i.e., lose the second ampersand.
2016-09-15 22:15:43	Ascender	but it's obviously irritated by the data type selected there...and I could've sworn that's not been an issue in the past

2016-09-15 22:17:58	twkm	all arguments to scanf must be pointers, which scanf needs so it can assign to the caller's objects.  printf only needs a pointer in a few cases, mostly it just wants the value to print.
2016-09-15 22:18:48	twkm	they are similar, but they have some surprising differences too.

2016-09-15 22:36:37	Ascender	Can anyone explain why Visual studio is automatically creating the main function like this: int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])  -- the way I'm being taught is simply int main();  nothing else goin on with it
2016-09-15 22:36:54	Boohbah	So it might be -32768 on one machine, or -2147483648 on another, or another negative number.
2016-09-15 22:36:55	kb_	inb4 thats not a C problem

2016-09-15 22:37:55	@candide	Ascender: That is not a C issue. This channel exists for discussion of the Standard C Language itself; not tools such as Makefiles, IDEs, compilers (see ##workingset for these things) or random libraries (including OS-specific ones such as POSIX or Windows; see ##posix or #winapi).
2016-09-15 22:38:05	ap0c	you can make empty projects in vs and just create an empty file with the correct extensions and create everything manually
2016-09-15 22:38:37	Ascender	I understand...I wasn't sure if it was IDE-related but I'm not surprised
2016-09-15 22:38:50	ap0c	it's a pretty clunky program for creating small beginner projects though, feels like starting up AutoCAD or Photoshop with the loading

2016-09-16 07:32:49	Stragus	Oh, right.
2016-09-16 07:32:53	haasn	I could use an allocation type that has VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIt as well
2016-09-16 07:33:03	haasn	that would technically allow host to efficiently read it out again as if it was in local RAM
2016-09-16 07:34:26	haasn	Stragus: I guess the weird thing is that the memcpy() itself isn't really a performance problem, it runs more than fast enough
2016-09-16 07:34:31	haasn	but every now and then it just spikes
2016-09-16 07:34:47	Stragus	If the buffers are already allocated, locked/pinned, touched, and you just write them over again... I can't really see why performance would vary that much
2016-09-16 07:35:19	Stragus	Do you get the same spikes with memset()?

2016-09-16 08:02:12	latch	meh. I've deployed and used doxygen docs just fine. Biggest annoying thing IMO is how much you have to document your source to get it in doxygen (eg, having to document all the enums)
2016-09-16 08:02:34	latch	It turns from some lightly documented mess into some over-documented mess
2016-09-16 08:02:58	doppel	hah.

2016-09-16 08:13:41	masochist	as I said, organization is my problem with doxygen. it starts off with expecting you to know the implementation to know how to use it, which is precisely backwards

2016-09-16 10:39:14	atk	[20:32:57] I've been looking through the linux kernel and trying to work out a nice fix for this USB device I have that is misbehaving. (the kernel is too strict on it) But two years ago now I started the Eudyptula challenge as a fun thing I though I could get through. About a year ago it hit a snag on one question - they had a bug, a few hundred people got stuck in a queue for a task with no response and it took them a [20:32:57]
2016-09-16 10:39:14	atk	[20:32:57] year to realise. Now they realise and I got onto the next task which involved some basic (they said it was going to be difficult but it really wasn't in the slightest) sysfs stuff. And the next task seems to be to get code accepted into the kernel. So I am hoping I will have some spare time over the next few weeks, I can finally implement that fix for that device. [20:32:57]

2016-09-16 13:07:26	Stragus	But all libm functions like sqrt(), log() or whatever are not safe
2016-09-16 13:08:49	Stragus	Also, watch out for old x86 with the x87 and its 80 bits intermediary results... Just use SSE, -mfpmath=sse
2016-09-16 13:09:21	Stragus	Actually, the Intel compiler enables unsafe float optimizations by default, they must be explicitely disabled
2016-09-16 13:09:36	undecim	So as long as optimizations are disabled, all non-library float operations will have the exact same behavior?

2016-09-16 13:11:59	fizzie	"A floating expression may be /contracted/, that is, evaluated as though it were a single operation, thereby omitting rounding errors implied by the source code and the expression evaluation method. The FP_CONTRACT pragma in <math.h> provides a way to disallow contracted expressions. Otherwise, whether and how expressions are contracted is implementation-defined."
2016-09-16 13:12:27	fizzie	So that's not true with even a moderately strict interpretation of "all platforms".

2016-09-16 23:55:42	atk	[09:15:09] but it's not something you can do without setting up the web server first. [09:15:09]
2016-09-16 23:55:42	iamawesome	[09:15:18] Everyone will connect to that server program, how can i do it? [09:15:18]

2016-09-17 12:51:11	@candide	A memory leak occurs when a dynamically allocated memory is left without the free() counterpart being called. Valgrind is a tool to check memory leaks.

2016-09-17 12:52:43	sh4z	the other option is wait for a new version of the package
2016-09-17 12:53:10	sh4z	but I'm impatient and frankly the idea of searching through code for bugs intrests me ^^; I'm weird

2016-09-17 16:48:38	buu	So
2016-09-17 16:51:25	buu	v8 is a javascript interpreter. v8 runs as a virtual machine. I want to thread v8. v8 isn't at all threadsafe and needs to create a new v8 context object inside the new thread and store its stuff inside the new object. Given all that, will the pthreads still share memory for linked libraries in a similar way to fork's cow behavior?
2016-09-17 16:51:44	buu	And is there a tool that will tell me precisely how much non-shared memory a pthread is using?
2016-09-17 16:51:49	buu	Or a process for that matter

2016-09-17 16:55:15	buu	good point
2016-09-17 16:56:01	buu	So from my perspective each thread has its own instance of the v8 context object, but obviously they're all shared because they're threads..

2016-09-17 16:56:54	buu	So I mean, at a very basic level, if I have thread A and it uses 1mb of ram, then I spawn a pthread B and inside that thread I malloc 1kb of memory, my total process size only increases by 1kb right?
2016-09-17 16:56:56	Maxdamantus	"threads" in Linux are just what people call processes (well, tasks) that share an address space.

2016-09-17 17:04:45	Maxdamantus	If you have a 150 MiB library and run two separate programs that use it, you wouldn't expect it to use 300 MiB for the two programs.
2016-09-17 17:06:13	Maxdamantus	it wouldn't even immediately load 150 MiB usually. It would just denote that some pages map to places in that file, and when the processes pagefault trying to access those pages it'll load them into memory.

2016-09-17 20:42:07	Kaslai	The linker also needs to be able to tell the binary that it needs to load xyz library when starting up. How do you expect it to do that if you don't tell it what libraries you need to run the application?
2016-09-17 20:43:01	joebobjoe	Kaslai: to your second point, yes, I see now why you need the name of the .dylib at run time to load
2016-09-17 20:43:54	sjohnson	Kaslai: to play devil's advocate, "the header files".
2016-09-17 20:43:56	joebobjoe	Kaslai: but many times we distribute binaries where we don't know what the actual dylib will be. so why bother checking the machine local dylib
2016-09-17 20:44:29	sjohnson	in response to: "... if you don't tell it what libraries you need to run the application?"
2016-09-17 20:44:42	joebobjoe	I just did an otool -l a.out, and apparently the -l libraries I linked to have their absolute path embedded in a.out
2016-09-17 20:44:43	Kaslai	To make sure that it actually has the function "foo_do_bar()" in it or whatever
2016-09-17 20:44:51	sjohnson	#include "/blah/openssl.h"
2016-09-17 20:45:03	sjohnson	kind of hints that openssl might be used.
2016-09-17 20:45:25	Kaslai	The linker needs to map any function call to a code address, and the linker will complain if it can't do that
2016-09-17 20:45:30	joebobjoe	sjohnson: but openssl does have different names for the actual libraries, and verion numbers in those names
2016-09-17 20:45:40	joebobjoe	libcrypto and libssl
2016-09-17 20:45:59	joebobjoe	Kaslai: but it only does that at run time I thought
2016-09-17 20:45:59	sjohnson	yeah, that confuses me a lot too, especially when you see 3 or 4 dll's lying around.
2016-09-17 20:46:04	Kaslai	If you don't specify the library to link to, the compiler doesn't know that there are all of these foo_* functions in a library which can be relied upon
2016-09-17 20:46:23	sjohnson	libeay, libssl, etc.

2016-09-17 20:49:25		[20:49]
2016-09-17 20:49:39	joebobjoe	Kaslai: do you actually have to name your functions after thelibrary name like that?
2016-09-17 20:49:50	Kaslai	It's platform specific. It would be possible for an application loader to fill in stubs left by the linker with direct calls into a shared binary (dll)
2016-09-17 20:49:54	Kaslai	And no you don't
2016-09-17 20:50:02	Kaslai	It's just conventional
2016-09-17 20:50:36	Kaslai	Most of SDL's functions begin with sdl_, however that's a choice of the SDL authors, so that name collisions won't happen.
2016-09-17 20:50:55	sjohnson	Kaslai: one thing i don't understand is why just using -L isn't enough.  e.g., can't it scan through all the libraries to find the function calls it needs?  or does the -l foo narrow it down a bit, in case > 1 libraries has the same function name or something.

2016-09-17 20:51:47	Kaslai	It would be a pointless waste of resources to scan through potentially 10k+ libraries for a given function name, and there could be a name collision.
2016-09-17 20:51:56	joebobjoe	Kaslai: so using the linker at compile time for linking to shared libs is just a verification step
2016-09-17 20:52:04	joebobjoe	Kaslai: you don't *actually* need it
2016-09-17 20:52:11	Kaslai	No, you do actually need it
2016-09-17 20:52:47	joebobjoe	Kaslai: but I mean the dynamic linker resolves the names right?
2016-09-17 20:52:51	Kaslai	As I said, the linker needs to connect all of the stub function calls in the object code to actually valid code
2016-09-17 20:53:07	sjohnson	you just said though that it could be done, albeit a waste of time.
2016-09-17 20:53:18	sjohnson	provided that function names don't collide, and you have time to kill.

2016-09-17 20:54:46	Kaslai	If the code you're trying to call is in a dynamic library, the linker needs to know that the function is in fact inside the dynamic library so that it can put hooks in the executable format to tell the loader to load said libraries, as well as leave the stub function calls in so that they actually do what is expected at run time.

2016-09-17 20:59:22	Kaslai	joebobjoe: shared objects export their function names so that they can be loaded by name at runtime. On Linux, this is done by default, on Windows, you have to explicitly export them with __declspec(dllexport) (or whatever it is; it's been a while since I did Windows programming)

2016-09-17 21:05:12	Kaslai	Not really, because most software developers strive to use a unique name
2016-09-17 21:06:03	Xgc	sjohnson: No.  There's also no mechanism for dealing out names, like domains.  So you just have to be careful.
2016-09-17 21:06:49	Kaslai	And there is a semi-defined order of directories to search. The linker proceeds through the list of directories one by one, checking for a library by the given name. When the library is found, that is the library the linker uses.
2016-09-17 21:06:53	Xgc	sjohnson: That name space is just not controlled.

2016-09-17 21:24:35	Kaslai	sjohnson: It's a link time problem though. Even if the translation units (".c files") were separate and included the prototypes for the different functions, when it comes time to link the translation units together, all the references to the function will use the local version.

2016-09-17 21:28:27	Kaslai	The linker doesn't really care about things like calling conventions or arguments or anything like that. It just sees that a symbol has an address, and that other places in the code are referring to that symbol, so paste in the address!

2016-09-17 23:06:00	atk	It doesn't solve any problem, it just creates more problems.
2016-09-17 23:06:09	Kaslai	Red Hat is trying to take over the linux ecosystem, basically. People don't like that.
2016-09-17 23:06:38	Kaslai	They've been forbidden from tainting the kernel, so they're trying to make everything else depend on systemd, so that they get a similar level of control.
2016-09-17 23:08:13	atk	It doesn't solve sequencing startup correctly (one of the things it claims to solve). There's two things they provide: specifying a service is "up" when a pidfile is written (pidfiles suck and are most often not an indicator of a service being "up"), or you can call a library function - not really portable, systemd specific - there are better ways to solve these problems.
2016-09-17 23:09:04	atk	People should first of all write software which doesn't catastrophically fail if the right conditions of network state or related supporting software are not met.

2016-09-17 23:09:20	atk	It's usually not difficult to have a timeout which waits for syslog or network to be up.
2016-09-17 23:09:27	atk	No need to "sequence" anything then
2016-09-17 23:09:44	atk	you just start everything in parallel and it sequences itself on its own accord (this is the best and simplest solution)
2016-09-17 23:10:09	atk	The second option is to do what certain runit derivatives which support sequencing boot do: use a file

2016-09-17 23:11:35	atk	But this is sub-optimal since it makes the supervisor's code more complicated, the easier solution would be if software could just wait on its own accord.
2016-09-17 23:11:50	atk	Honestly not a difficult thing to implement and means that this "sequencing" becomes a non-issue.

2016-09-18 09:13:46	CodFection	[18:15:49] which compiler and text editor / ide is preferred? for C [18:15:49]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	Moto-chan	[18:19:17] Whatever code editor you prefer, your compiler of choice, and make. [18:19:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	TommyC	[18:19:23] Pick one and get coding. [18:19:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	Moto-chan	[18:19:26] Screw IDEs imo. [18:19:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	atk	[18:19:33] Hmm. [18:19:33]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	TommyC	[18:19:35] Ain't nobody got time for that shit. :3 [18:19:35]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	Moto-chan	[18:19:37] They're mostly just noise and template code that you'll never use. [18:19:37]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	CodFection	[18:20:16] TommyC, that pretty much tells me. thanks [18:20:16]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	atk	[18:21:29] Use vim [18:21:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	atk	[18:21:31] Or emacs [18:21:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	atk	[18:21:39] Implement the IDE _inside_ the editor. [18:21:39]

2016-09-18 09:13:46	@candide	[18:22:01] Title of Moto-chan's link: xkcd: Real Programmers [18:22:01]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	Moto-chan	[18:22:04] ^ relevant [18:22:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	jonbryan	[18:22:35] You can watch youtube in emacs now. time to make the switch. [18:22:35]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	CodFection	[18:22:40] lol Moto-chan [18:22:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:23:04] emacs is a pretty good operating system, has everything but a good text editor. [18:23:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	atk	[18:24:22] This is why you just run vim inside emacs terminal emulator. [18:24:22]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	hypnopothesis	[18:27:55] there is spacemacs that is focused on vim [18:27:55]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	atk	[18:29:29] for spackers? [18:29:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	hypnopothesis	[18:34:02] not sure what a spacker is but you can use vim bindings in emacs [18:34:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	atk	[18:36:41] It's an insult commonly used here in the UK. Or well, the area of the UK that I live in. [18:36:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	atk	[18:36:45] It means "spastic" [18:36:45]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	atk	[18:37:20] I was just commenting on how the name, when said aloud, sounds a bit like: spack-emacs [18:37:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	atk	[18:37:39] You can also say it as such: space-macs. [18:37:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	sjohnson	[18:41:09] atk are you a UK native? [18:41:09]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	sjohnson	[18:41:23] like, have the british accent and everything? [18:41:23]

2016-09-18 09:13:47	Veltas	[18:41:52] No such thing as real British people, move along [18:41:52]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	atk	[18:42:13] I guess some people try to insist I don't, but I also certainly don't have a Polish accent, I have confused plenty of brits who thought I was from all sorts of parts of the UK. [18:42:13]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	atk	[18:42:21] I have lived here for most of my life now so... [18:42:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	atk	[18:42:40] I certainly call people twats and wankers. [18:42:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	pragma-	[18:42:48] so what you're saying is that you don't know how to speak? [18:42:48]

2016-09-18 20:04:33	ap0c	that loop just prints numbers from 5 to -1
2016-09-18 20:05:10	ap0c	why would you use the indicator value in that situation if you aren't dealing with text streams and it's just a static loop?

2016-09-18 20:05:35	ap0c	In computing, end-of-file (commonly abbreviated EOF) is a condition in a computer operating system where no more data can be read from a data source. The data source is usually called a file or stream.

2016-09-18 20:49:08	spal	Another thing worth noting is that on Linux (I am being implementation specific here), pressing ^D does not necessarily indicate EOF. ^D is used to indicate an EOF only when you haven't typed anything in the line yet. What happens in reality is that pressing ^D causes the underlying read() call to return with whatever data it has put into the buffe
2016-09-18 20:49:08	spal	r.
2016-09-18 20:49:29	spal	For example, if you have a getchar() in a loop, e.g. while (1) { int c = getchar(); printf("%c (%d)\n", c); }, and if you type a string immediately followed by "foo^D", you'll see "f", "o", "o" consumed and printed immediately. ^D merely forces read() to return which ultimately results in getchar() consuming the characters read by read() into a buf
2016-09-18 20:49:30	spal	fer.
2016-09-18 20:49:43	spal	Note that a similar thing happens when you enter a newline. That's why if you type "foo<ENTER>", you'll see "f", "o", "o" consumed and printed immediately.

2016-09-19 08:26:37	kst	Promotion occurs when the visible declaration is not a prototype (don't do that, always use prototypes), or for variadic functions like printf.  For those cases, the compiler can't tell what the expected type is.  Integers narrower than int are promoted to int (if int can hold all values in the range of the source type) or to unsigned int.  float is promoted to double.  Other types are not converted.

2016-09-19 14:09:01	marchelzo	oh, ok. i thought maybe the first two were placed on the heap, the third one was statically allocated, and the rest were on the stack.

2016-09-20 03:37:16	atk	The simplest one I can find which doesn't require installing all of kde with it (/me stares at kcachegrind) would be https://sourceforge.net/projects/tceetree/

2016-09-20 12:40:13	PinkTieGuy	Hey all - hoping for some guidance. I'm quite new to C. The majority of what I've done in C is programming AVRs. I've got decent experience using Matlab for doing some numerical method work and I'd really like to start doing it in C. My question has to do with how I should be setting up arrays. Say I'm doing a simple theta method where I'll end up with an 4x10000 array - should I be using static allocation or
2016-09-20 12:40:13	PinkTieGuy	 dynamic allocation to set up that array? Thanks :)
2016-09-20 12:40:42	Stragus	Definitely dynamic for anything that isn't tiny

2016-09-20 12:41:40	PinkTieGuy	Stragus : So it's unlike Matlab where I would preallocate a certain empty array?

2016-09-20 13:21:27	PinkTieGuy	montanonic : Thanks will take a look. What about Fortran? I guess I'm wondering which would be the most widely used, if not necessarily the absolute fastest as well...
2016-09-20 13:22:45	montanonic	PinkTieGuy: Fortran was created around 1955. You don't want to write Fortran, you just want to use the crazy fast libraries it has to do sci-comp. Julia, like all other languages targetting sci-comp, uses many Fortran libraries under the hood, and makes it easy to call into arbitrary Fortran code natively.
2016-09-20 13:23:36	Stragus	I would suggest sticking to C, then you also would be able to read or write other software if you ever need it

2016-09-20 18:31:41	caze	Okay, and this point is crucial: Initialization is not the same as assignment.

2016-09-20 18:53:20	Boobuigi	[04:29:03] walb0: You can initialize an array but not with malloc(). [04:29:03]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	Boobuigi	[04:29:14] int n[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; [04:29:14]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:29:18] I've done it many times before though [04:29:18]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	caze	[04:29:42] What? array{0,1,2}? [04:29:42]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:30:00] array = {0,1,2} you know what I mean, [04:30:00]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:30:21] array = {0} is simply make each index = 0 [04:30:21]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	caze	[04:30:22] No, you have not. [04:30:22]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	caze	[04:30:46] You may have initialized arrays like that, but you've never assigned arrays like that. [04:30:46]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:31:16] Yes I meant initialise [04:31:16]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:31:41] so when I calloc some memory, can i then use the location[i] like that < [04:31:41]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	caze	[04:31:41] Okay, and this point is crucial: Initialization is not the same as assignment. [04:31:41]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:31:43] using [] [04:31:43]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:31:57] yes okay, caze didn't know what you meant before by assign [04:31:57]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	caze	[04:33:08] Now, going back to your original question, how would you initialize a malloc'ed array? [04:33:08]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:35:39] no idea [04:35:39]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:39:35] how do u caze [04:39:35]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	caze	[04:40:43] You cannot. [04:40:43]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:41:42] can i use it like an array? [04:41:42]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:41:51] e.g. location[i] = 1 [04:41:51]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	caze	[04:42:07] Yes. [04:42:07]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:42:12] great [04:42:12]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:42:55] my teacher has typedef'd all these words to int, it's weird [04:42:55]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	pthreat	[04:44:13] I've grown used to stupid high level languages, fuck [04:44:13]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	pthreat	[04:44:27] walb0, what, typedef uint8 stuff like that ? [04:44:27]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:50:41] like typdef LocationID as int [04:50:41]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:50:50] so you use LocationID variable instead of int variable [04:50:50]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	caze	[04:51:00] Neither of those are variables. [04:51:00]

2016-09-20 19:52:10	caze	Okay, but you put the return type as int. How is that returning the array?
2016-09-20 19:53:07	walb0	isn't that how you do that? the array has type ints
2016-09-20 19:53:23	walb0	the type of the array is int isn't it?
2016-09-20 19:53:36	caze	Nope, and nope.
2016-09-20 19:53:54	caze	walb0: into foo(void) { return 42; } Is this function returning an array of ints?

2016-09-20 19:54:26	walb0	it doesn't necessarily mean array but what is the correct way then

2016-09-21 06:53:21	tumeric	thanks marchelzo. struct _WisdomList  *head = NULL; is it setting the struct to NULL?

2016-09-21 07:12:19	bone	Malkrith: well, when you run strlen on a buffer that may or may not have a null terminator, you'll potentially get a very large length returned, and strcpy is going to go blast away at that length.

2016-09-21 10:21:52	cousteau	when you say it "uses both", do you mean you can write standard C for Arduino (the IDE, not the board) and it will work?
2016-09-21 10:22:15	cousteau	like   char *new = "hello";
2016-09-21 10:22:54	cousteau	or that you can code in C for Arduino using AVR Studio?

2016-09-21 10:23:44	megaTherion	Arduino sucks
2016-09-21 10:23:47	cousteau	or that "the documentation says that it uses C/C++"?
2016-09-21 10:24:06	cousteau	matkatmusic, you can't really code in C unless that C is also C++
2016-09-21 10:24:34	matkatmusic	well, you seem to know more about it than me so why are you asking me if you can code in C on it lol
2016-09-21 10:24:41	cousteau	because the Arduino IDE interprets its stuff as C++, not as C
2016-09-21 10:24:43	matkatmusic	I just wrote some C functions.
2016-09-21 10:24:47	matkatmusic	and they worked fine
2016-09-21 10:25:11	bone	not having a class does not make them C functions.  they're still C++.
2016-09-21 10:25:17	cousteau	"I just did X and it worked fine"... yeah, good luck with that learning technique
2016-09-21 10:25:26	megaTherion	he has no clue what he does at all
2016-09-21 10:25:54	megaTherion	but anyways arduino is for people who cant even get some wire and an chip and solder themselfs some oscilator on some board... so what to expect
2016-09-21 10:26:14	matkatmusic	anyway.  Just need to know the syntax to pass in the address of a single byte from a byte array into a function expecting a pointer to a byte
2016-09-21 10:26:27	megaTherion	matkatmusic: how about get a book for C (or C++)?
2016-09-21 10:26:30	megaTherion	!books
2016-09-21 10:26:30	@candide	See http://www.iso-9899.info/wiki/Books for some useful book recommendations, including free online resources!
2016-09-21 10:26:40	cousteau	C++ is similar to C but with some extra features; therefore it is likely that pure C code will work as C++, but that's all, it doesn't mean that it supports C, it means that it supports C++ that is also valid C, sometimes
2016-09-21 10:26:55	matkatmusic	anyway.  Just need to know the syntax to pass in the address of a single byte from a byte array into a function expecting a pointer to a byte

2016-09-21 10:28:13	matkatmusic	er, byteArray + index
2016-09-21 10:28:13	cousteau	yes... then again, that's one of the "fun" things in C++: there you can overload the [] and & operators, so obscure stuff can happen if the array isn't really an array but a weird class
2016-09-21 10:28:35	cousteau	yes, byteArray will behave as a pointer in that case, and pointer arithmetic works like that
2016-09-21 10:29:01	cousteau	(in that expression I mean; not that byteArray is really a pointer)
2016-09-21 10:29:16	matkatmusic	awesome.  Thank you so much!  Way more helpful than megaTherion, who seems lonely and needs a puppy

2016-09-22 07:37:11	seanrdev	My issue is when comparing the strings in 2 files one is One hundred million and the second is 11 million. So I wrote it in python and it was so slow. Thought about threading but can't because of a Global Interpreter Lock. So I decided to try and implement in C. I love coding and learning however I'm not strong in C (obviously). So where I have a bottleneck is after the lists are loaded into arrays comparing takes a while. So

2016-09-22 17:14:27	Zhivago	You need to store them somewhere.

2016-09-22 17:17:06	_max_	I thought of double linked lists because, once I find the minimum element on the list, I had to access the previous element to make it point to the next of the minimum element
2016-09-22 17:17:18	Zhivago	Selection sort is fine on singly linked lists.
2016-09-22 17:17:47	Zhivago	You don't need a pointer to the previous element.
2016-09-22 17:18:03	Zhivago	You just need a pointer to the pointer to the current element.
2016-09-22 17:19:27	_max_	hmmmm
2016-09-22 17:19:29	Zhivago	This is important because you'll aways have a pointer to the current element, but you won't always have a previous element (consider when the current is the first).

2016-09-22 22:02:06	twkm	yes you can, but you don't have an array in the struct.

2016-09-22 23:05:59	fizzie	"Ragged array" and "jagged array" are the names I've seen, referring to the fact that the "rows" don't need to be of equal length in that case.
2016-09-22 23:06:02	garyserj	you do use array like notation with that char** style implementation though, right?

2016-09-22 23:22:39	fizzie	In retrospect, the terminology ambiguity is probably whether you use "array" in terms of the C types, or as the general data structure concept. In the first case, multidimensional arrays are contiguous. In the second, you can implement one in various ways, including as a (C) array of arrays, or by using an array of pointers.

2016-09-23 09:05:51	soulisson	Hi, in the following sentence"The for statement lets you repeat a statement or compound statement a specified number of times", why the author chose to write "THE for statement", instead of "A for statement"?
2016-09-23 09:06:34	nevodka	it would be the same meaning either way
2016-09-23 09:06:34		[09:06]
2016-09-23 09:07:10	nevodka	hes referring to the identifier 'for' of which there is only one
2016-09-23 09:07:26	nevodka	rather than an occurrence of 'for' of which there can be zero or many
2016-09-23 09:07:34	nevodka	but it makes sense either way
2016-09-23 09:07:57	caze	for isn't an identifier.

2016-09-23 09:08:19	latch1	its an indefinite article vs a definite article but the meaning in this context is the same. English can be pretty illogical
2016-09-23 09:08:30	soulisson	nevodka, ah I see, "the for statement" is here for the author simply the reserved word "for"?

2016-09-23 10:43:57	Murii	lol
2016-09-23 10:44:36	bone	Murii: you need a counter to track where in the finalBuffer you are.
2016-09-23 10:44:57	bone	you can also use that to index into the buffer when you do the next memcpy.
2016-09-23 10:45:01	latch1	but barfod has the general idea. you store the offset. you can use a ptrdiff_t type to hold the difference between the starting pointer and the ending pointer or some other count mechanism

2016-09-23 10:46:22	bone	alternatively, if you know the size ahead of time, you can allocate a buffer per whatever and store pointers to those.

2016-09-23 11:00:03	fizzie	There are people who cast malloc out of some sort of a desire to write C-and-C++ polyglots.
2016-09-23 11:00:20	bone	okay, if that is the case, i would suggest looking at one of the recommended C books on the wiki.
2016-09-23 11:00:26	UniFreak	I buyed K&R's second edition for reference. Is that an old one, too?
2016-09-23 11:00:51	bone	it is, but it is a good source to learn C.  be sure to check the errata for k&r.

2016-09-23 12:20:47	dogbert2	[20:58:41] must be older than moses...Practical C has suggestions of casting malloc() for old K&R style compilers, but anything C89 or better shouldn't need it [20:58:41]
2016-09-23 12:20:47	bone	[20:58:51] which book is it? [20:58:51]
2016-09-23 12:20:47	UniFreak	[20:59:45] bone: you won't know. It's a Chinese textbook for the higher educatio self-study exam [20:59:45]
2016-09-23 12:20:47	fizzie	[21:00:02] There are people who cast malloc out of some sort of a desire to write C-and-C++ polyglots. [21:00:02]
2016-09-23 12:20:47	bone	[21:00:19] okay, if that is the case, i would suggest looking at one of the recommended C books on the wiki. [21:00:19]
2016-09-23 12:20:47	UniFreak	[21:00:25] I buyed K&R's second edition for reference. Is that an old one, too? [21:00:25]
2016-09-23 12:20:47	bone	[21:00:50] it is, but it is a good source to learn C.  be sure to check the errata for k&r. [21:00:50]
2016-09-23 12:20:47	dogbert2	[21:01:10] K&R 2nd Ed is a good book, but bone is right, check the errata... [21:01:10]
2016-09-23 12:20:47	UniFreak	[21:18:12] uh... seems dummy to ask this, but where is K&R second edition's errata? I searched google, and https://gist.github.com/ttilley/1159475 is the best I could find [21:18:12]
2016-09-23 12:20:47	latch1	[21:18:20] ,errata [21:18:20]
2016-09-23 12:20:47	@candide	[21:18:21] When reading The C Programming Language, 2nd edition, by Kernighan and Ritchie, make sure you check the errata as well: http://www.iso-9899.info/2ediffs.html [21:18:21]
2016-09-23 12:20:47	UniFreak	[21:20:00] latch1: thanks :) [21:20:00]

2016-09-23 12:42:48	sarbs	kind of actually, yeah lol. i'm doing some funky shit mucking around with ART's internals on android and one of the things i'm trying to modify is a pointer to an mmap'ed region - need to point it to a larger region, but i need to figure out a way to find the pointer within the object i'm modifying first
2016-09-23 12:43:19	sarbs	was hoping to examine my mmaps and find the one i'm looking for, then use that address as a sentinel value to search for starting at the holding object's address

2016-09-23 14:11:54	r7st	i'm trying to pull the last byte of a file and i'm getting a value that looks like \333 when it's a char. when i put it into a uint, i get some large such as 121. Do these values have some other representation?

2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:19:58] but it's only a matter of time until they converge given that the major compilers already support it [10:19:58]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	caze	[10:20:38] I thought you were for backwards compatibility? [10:20:38]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:20:39] Note: This is a pretty silly feature to discuss. [10:20:39]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	caze	[10:21:38] Yeah, suggesting #pragma once was pretty silly. [10:21:38]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:21:45] I love backwards compatibility but not at the sacrifice of utility of the language. [10:21:45]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:21:56] For a specific project.. especially not. [10:21:56]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	caze	[10:22:01] Paradigum: If C and C++ converge, then lots of backwards compatibility will be lost. [10:22:01]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:22:23] such as? [10:22:23]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:22:41] given c++ is already maintaining backwards compatability [10:22:41]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:23:03] compile your old c programs with g++ rather than gcc and whoooooo!  They compile! heh [10:23:03]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	caze	[10:23:06] Paradigum: Any C program ever written that happened to use "new" or "class" as an identifier. [10:23:06]

2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:23:31] Ok...  a nice search/replace regex. [10:23:31]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:23:32] done [10:23:32]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:23:38] and? [10:23:38]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:23:39] next? [10:23:39]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	caze	[10:25:10] Paradigum: Also, why would you want them to converge? Why not just abandon C, and make a clean break? Why do the extra work to make them converge? [10:25:10]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:25:25] There are a lot of reasons to use C [10:25:25]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:25:31] I am a C programmer. =P [10:25:31]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	caze	[10:25:48] Paradigum: Why aren't you using C++? [10:25:48]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:26:00] Ever tried to do byte processing on a stream? [10:26:00]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:26:03] really annoying [10:26:03]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	caze	[10:26:12] Paradigum: Then why do you want them to converge? [10:26:12]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:26:28] The standards from one are linked to the other [10:26:28]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:26:44] preprocessing directives like pragma once... [10:26:44]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:26:46] a good idea [10:26:46]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:26:49] should be in both [10:26:49]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	caze	[10:26:54] Paradigum: Have you ever looked at the C standard? [10:26:54]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:26:59] and supported in both.. on any modern compiler [10:26:59]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:27:12] many times actually yes [10:27:12]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	caze	[10:27:23] Paradigum: How is it linked to the C++ standard? [10:27:23]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:27:52] I've worked with a tad too many custom silicon soc's in my time...  with buggy compilers. [10:27:52]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:28:05] my recolleciton is the inverse. ;) [10:28:05]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:28:21] yes I get your point [10:28:21]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	caze	[10:28:23] Are you sure you didn't just have buggy, non-portable code? [10:28:23]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	caze	[10:28:42] Dues to too much reliance on GNU, perhaps? [10:28:42]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:28:48] No [10:28:48]

2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:29:01] My life was proprietary [10:29:01]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:29:13] Only over the last 5 or so years the inverse has occured. [10:29:13]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:29:28] People are increasinly wanting c++ in the embedded space..  My sacred space [10:29:28]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:30:38] So lets turn this on you then caze... You...  Your exposure to the latest standards. [10:30:38]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:31:25] A simple language extention that is EXTREMLY usful to even a C programmer with pthreads.  c++11...  the atomic keyword [10:31:25]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:31:45] You see no benifit in writing c code but using a c++11 compiler? =P [10:31:45]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:32:30] `benefit`  blah.. damn spelling. [10:32:30]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:33:06] Hell..  The addition to using a bool in C99?! hah [10:33:06]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:33:22] I kinda like having true and false defined [10:33:22]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:33:31] How far back do you wanna go? [10:33:31]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	Paradigum	[10:33:43] I know a boolean is such a difficult type for C to understand. ;) [10:33:43]

2016-09-24 03:16:05	rerumnovarum	sup; say i've got module N and it has procedures some of which take pointers to complex numbers (say defined as complex long double) arrays and some take pointers to comlpex-valued functions of complex parameters; and say i've also got module P which does e.g. function graph plotting and for some reason needs to use mentioned procedures from module N; Everything in module P operates on real values (and
2016-09-24 03:16:11	rerumnovarum	deals with arrays and functors); Problem: need to wrap somehow these arrays and functors to pass to module N and backward; I've been using C# and Java for a while before, so my culture and thus thinking are kinda shifted away from C and his low-level abstractions; In OOP language i'd use iterators and lambdas to wrap these pointers and functors; E.g. in C++ i'd use struct { double (*f)(double); complex
2016-09-24 03:16:17	rerumnovarum	double operator(complex z); } to wrap functors; In C it would require me to implement OOP myself by passing some void* into procedures; I.e. i'd need to change lots of interfaces; So the question is what do i do (except realizing that i'm solving wrong problem &c)?

2016-09-24 14:40:58	kate	you're welcome
2016-09-24 14:41:09	kate	is there any reason you're implementing a doubly-linked list?
2016-09-24 14:41:45	c123	yes, the assignment is to add two very large numbers of any size via linked list nodes with single digits
2016-09-24 14:41:59	c123	I need to be able to populate, traverse, and manipulate the values
2016-09-24 14:42:10	kate	why do you need to traverse backwards for that?
2016-09-24 14:42:52	c123	if you add 2 digits in a certain position and it goes over 10, you have to perform a carry operation. a borrow operation is needed for subtraction
2016-09-24 14:43:21	kate	oh, i see. that's not a bad use-case

2016-09-24 15:25:29	graygoose124	but, admittedly, not as simple. so I suppose it's valid :/

2016-09-24 15:25:48	graygoose124	also, c123 try walking through your code on a notebook paper
2016-09-24 15:25:52	masochist	now printf is faster than the debugger \o/
2016-09-24 15:25:58	kate	graygoose124: formulate it before writing your printf :)
2016-09-24 15:26:33	graygoose124	kate: true
2016-09-24 15:27:03	c123	okay. line 19 i think is correct. I should be changing previous_node to the next_node, not the other way around. That is why first_node is always being changed
2016-09-24 15:27:45	graygoose124	c123: It kinda slipped my mind, but either way that statement really doesn't have any effect because it's overwritten with a new node next loop
2016-09-24 15:27:47	cores	i justed listened to a talk were the speaker said that basically the reason why C programmers wont use C++ is because they love debugging so much
2016-09-24 15:28:10	graygoose124	if I'm gonna go to C++, I'll just use python with c extensions for critical code
2016-09-24 15:28:12	c123	or you are forced to like me in school
2016-09-24 15:28:13	kate	cores: wtf
2016-09-24 15:28:31	masochist	sounds like someone has an anti-C agenda
2016-09-24 15:28:34	cores	kate, yeah it's mad, innit?
2016-09-24 15:29:01	graygoose124	is it just me or is C...like elegant in it's simplicity and power...then C++ is just...well you know.
2016-09-24 15:29:02	cores	masochist, it was at "cppcon 2016"
2016-09-24 15:29:09	masochist	not surprising
2016-09-24 15:29:11	c123	yes i do haha
2016-09-24 15:29:59	cd80	c123: make a char how nodes are linked

2016-09-24 15:30:30	masochist	at this point I just find language bashing tiresome. unless it's php, which is empirically bad.

2016-09-24 17:48:14	Akahige	That's why I asked for clarification on what a null string actually is CaZe
2016-09-24 17:48:27	Akahige	Does he mean the pointer to the string is null, or the string is just a null char
2016-09-24 17:48:44	Akahige	Zero length string, or null ptr
2016-09-24 17:48:52	popi	hey, i have a question. I want to be a kernel dev. in the near future, and i'm currently learning C. Should I focus on learning C or learning more about the kernel itself?
2016-09-24 17:49:00	CaZe	He probably doesn't understand the difference.
2016-09-24 17:49:04	Akahige	"String is null" is ill defined, considering C doesn't really have strings for them to be null

2016-09-24 17:50:09	d0x1p2	They can likely give you a better and more accurate roadmap to becoming a linux dev.
2016-09-24 17:50:11	Akahige	popi: You should probably already know C, C++ and probably some ASM for your target system, then intimately know the kernel, system calls, etc..
2016-09-24 17:50:25	CaZe	popi: Probably learn C first, since it might be harder to learn C once you've been tainted with kernel stuff.
2016-09-24 17:51:11	CaZe	anonrate: In that case, there is no string, so you shouldn't be trying to check if it's null.
2016-09-24 17:51:13	popi	CaZe: yeah, while(1); to halt the module was... interesting
2016-09-24 17:51:21	CaZe	anonrate: Rather, you should check to see if the pointer is null.
2016-09-24 17:52:07	anonrate	so &string == 0x0?...  Lol
2016-09-24 17:52:24	CaZe	popi: If you try to learn both concurrently, or you learn kernel stuff first, the danger in either one of these is that you confuse Linux specific behavior with being C.
2016-09-24 17:52:54	Akahige	anonrate: stop blindly hammering code without understanding really what it does.
2016-09-24 17:53:00	CaZe	anonrate: What is the type of string?
2016-09-24 17:53:08	graygoose124	CaZe: but you should only be using linux, so there is no other behaviour to worry abuot

2016-09-24 17:53:17	Akahige	Also... &string = 0x0; is illegal.

2016-09-24 17:53:28	anonrate	&string points to the pointer of the string, ya?
2016-09-24 17:53:45	popi	CaZe: oh I see. good point. I will focus on C for a couple of months then. Thank you!

2016-09-24 18:04:45	anonrate	So how is a char array made then?  Because I'm totally lost.  I thought char str[n] was an array of pointer of chars to represent a character array, and char* was a pointer to either a single character or multiple points of characters depending on the definition..
2016-09-24 18:05:09	Akahige	anonrate: char str[n]; is an array of n chars
2016-09-24 18:05:22	Akahige	It just so happens, that arrays implicitly convert to pointers to their first element.

2016-09-24 18:13:29	Akahige	You may understand it in your head, maybe you're still confused. But you're not explaining it well.
2016-09-24 18:13:32	CaZe	More like: "a pointer that may have other pointers following it".
2016-09-24 18:13:39	Akahige	char** is a pointer to a pointer to a char.

2016-09-24 18:17:43	Akahige	It just so happens that that one is the first one, and you can find the rest after that.

2016-09-24 20:04:33	Akahige	If you're copying, do whatever you want. Keep it or free it.
2016-09-24 20:05:06	Akahige	If you're just linking it to the end. Scrap the old list, you don't want to have to track 2 different ownerships of the same nodes if you don't have to.

However, the size of the binary file is incorrect. It should be about 1.5mb, but it is 338kB. Can someone tell me why this doesn't work?
2016-09-25 03:29:01	szwetsloot	Structures and save method are here: http://pastebin.com/wyACme9L

2016-09-25 04:53:25	doppel	c469: no, casting is not required because c already supports implicit casting of void * to and from any object pointer type.

2016-09-25 23:41:33	stemid	so I'm getting ready to package a c program for the first time in 10 years. is autoconf still what I should be using or is there some other, simpler, way to prepare a Makefile for different platforms?

2016-09-26 11:16:07	Richard_Cavell	Hello everyone. I have been reading about the 8 address registers of the 68000 CPU. It seems to me that the only reasonable use for these registers is to hold pointers, including function pointers. Is there such an equivalence?

2016-09-26 11:18:14	dho	this depends on how you look at it.
2016-09-26 11:18:30	Richard_Cavell	And does the existence of these general purpose address registers anticipate that the 68K will be programmed in a language that has pointers?

2016-09-26 11:19:17	dho	however, there would be no reason you couldn't use data registers to do pointer math

2016-09-26 11:28:09	kate	well really they are equivalent to void *, aren't they? there's no notion of C's type system there
2016-09-26 11:28:15	dho	you're drawing equivalence for a physical hardware implementation to a language that knows literally nothing about that hardware. (and the hardware knows nothing about the language).

2016-09-26 14:39:09	Kaslai	That's also why sometimes you'll get really bizzare library link ordering requirements, as one library will need its references defined by another library, which needs to have references defined by yet another.
2016-09-26 14:39:26	Kaslai	So you can end up with a chain of several libraries that must be linked in a specific relative order.

2016-09-26 14:40:15	enso	jancoow: Okay, well in that case, make a struct with the "same 7 fields" and use that as one of the values in the other structs. when you do the logic for every struct, you can call another function to filter that scruct so you don't have to rewrite that logic.

2016-09-26 16:57:12	dfrey	For a generic hashtable, you are going to have at a minimum a create, insert and get function.  What I am struggling with is that if we have void insert(HashTable_t ht, const void* key, const void* value) void* get(HashTable_t ht, const void* key) then you can insert a const value pointer and when it comes back out const has silently been removed.  You can make the get return const void*, but then every client
2016-09-26 16:57:14	dfrey	has to cast away the constness if they want to mutate the value.  A third option is to make insert take a void* for the value, but that means that clients will have to cast away the const if they want to insert const data into the hash table.  Are there any options that don't suck?

2016-09-26 17:28:28	_max_	its selection sort, and the struct node just has two properties, ptr and value.

2016-09-26 17:29:21	Akahige	But on a theory side, mergesort is much more efficient.
2016-09-26 17:29:55	Akahige	Selection sort is O(n^2) merge sort is O(n log n)

2016-09-26 18:47:49	Akahige	Just wondering, as I've always used it with brackets for consistency with everything else that's in my expressions.
2016-09-26 18:48:35	CaZe	Akahige: Really? You add extra parenthesis everywhere?
2016-09-26 18:48:46	Akahige	No, just for consistency.

2016-09-26 18:49:25	CaZe	But sizeof isn't a function.
2016-09-26 18:49:36	Akahige	Yes, but it's generally used alongside others.
2016-09-26 18:49:49	Akahige	Also, decltype requires brackets, but I don't think I'll get a good reception mentioning that here xD

2016-09-26 18:53:06	Akahige	If it was called prefix_operator I probably would put bracket around it rather than a space

2016-09-26 18:53:57	Stragus	Yes well, you kind of need parenthesis for more complex sizeof statements

2016-09-26 18:56:01	Stragus	I'm always willing to put more parenthsis than strictly necessary in expressions, it seems to speed up the brain's parsing of the expression

2016-09-26 18:56:39	CaZe	That question doesn't even make sense.
2016-09-26 18:56:42	Akahige	So I'll continue to use my brackets, as I like the consistency.

2016-09-26 21:49:31	Ploppz	don't know where I can get help with MPI, but..: http://mpi.deino.net/mpi_functions/MPI_Scatterv.html the MPI_Send line hints that displs[i] is in units of length of sendtype... What I'm trying to do is to partition a 2D grid into subdomains. The `sendtype`s are MPI vector types, so they are strided. If displs[i] is in sendtypes, and not in floats, that means I can't do that.

"Compilable" means that there is enough code to compile it on our machines, and therefore use our debuggers. Please paste a testcase at http://ideone.com or http://codepad.org to help us assist you.

2016-09-26 23:43:12	mthowe	fseek just moves your file position indicator. It doesn't read anything.
2016-09-26 23:43:32	mthowe	Can't you just loop over reading 4x1.6MB until you hit EOF?

2016-09-26 23:48:24	mthowe	On your first iteration, you're going to read from st.st_size - sizeof(Recording) * 0
2016-09-26 23:48:36	mthowe	Which will put you at exactly the end of the file. ;)

2016-09-27 01:06:04	HelloShitty	Is this correct or wrong?
2016-09-27 01:06:07	heck_	Ohhh, I think it's just because the int that is passed is declared as let's say int i = 0; while the other one is char *s = NULL; so it's already an address if no *to dereference while the other is just an int if passed as it is ?
2016-09-27 01:06:20	dminuoso	heck_: That's correct. :)
2016-09-27 01:06:30	heck_	thank you!!!
2016-09-27 01:06:33	dminuoso	heck_: "s" is of type "char *"
2016-09-27 01:06:48	Richard_Cavell	HelloShitty: why not putchar() instead of printf()?
2016-09-27 01:07:09	HelloShitty	Sure, but is the syntax correct?
2016-09-27 01:07:25	Richard_Cavell	Yes

2016-09-27 07:39:15	Aginor23	Hello, I'm trying to figure out the best way to manage threads in a server/client program. I have a limit of NUM_THDS that I will make. When I receive a communication from a client machine, I want to use a thread to deal with the response while the server continues to wait for another connection. Each connection in turn will be handled by a new thread. What is the best way of recycling those threads when they terminate? Should I use

2016-09-27 08:02:03	Waldo	Its complicated.  Im doing a CTF right now where I need to change the B variable to a very specific number to get the desired execution. It needs to be done through an overflow is my assertion, b starts out as 0x=41414141 which printf gives as 1111638594.  A buf=[010] is set, which means we are limited to 8 characters, 9+ chars starts changing things.  I noticed upon adding anything new past 8 I got my B
2016-09-27 08:02:10	Waldo	variable to change from 1111638594 to 707406378 for example using ****.  Just for some backstory...in case you guys are curious.

2016-09-27 08:42:53	twkm	if you must thus write to it after its creation you shouldn't use the const qualifier, however you can return a const qualified object from a function even if it is the same unqualified object used as the argument (more likely a pointer to it).

2016-09-27 11:41:12	Bomber4Chats	Someone please correct me - given an empty array, say char array_a[20], and another array char array_b[10] which has char values within, I was thinking of using pointers to easily copy the contents of array_b starting from some index (not 0) in array_a
2016-09-27 11:41:28	twkm	arrays cannot be empty, every element always has a value.
2016-09-27 11:41:37	Bomber4Chats	say, index 5, so elements 5 to 14 will be the contents of array_b

2016-09-27 17:44:56	pthreat	*besides* that 5
2016-09-27 17:44:59	barfod	looks like it should be 6
2016-09-27 17:45:21	mthowe	If it's 6, he'll overflow the buffer. So that and the malloc should both be 6.

2016-09-27 17:45:39	barfod	so malloc more
2016-09-27 17:45:44	pthreat	So, besides the 5/6 incident, is it ... bad to return a char pointer to a struct
2016-09-27 17:45:54	pthreat	I mean, not mallocing anything in the struct
2016-09-27 17:45:54	barfod	i think you should use a string and run strlen on it
2016-09-27 17:46:05	pthreat	this is my actual question
2016-09-27 17:46:13	barfod	and not hard code all the numbers, just pass the "len" return value from strlen as size_t
2016-09-27 17:46:32	pthreat	barfod, it's ok, that's not the question, I'm trying to explain the question
2016-09-27 17:46:34	mthowe	There's nothing particularly wrong with doing it that way. Sometimes it's the only option. If you do it frequently though, it can be a mess remembering what you need to cleanup.
2016-09-27 17:46:48	barfod	pthreat: the way you are using malloc() there is bad yeah. it will be difficult to free all the memory as the project grows
2016-09-27 17:46:52	pthreat	The function returns a char pointer to a struct ... I'm I supposed to malloc anything BEFORE calling the test function in the structure ?
2016-09-27 17:46:54	chrisf	^ be very clear on who owns what memory.
2016-09-27 17:47:16	pthreat	barfod, I have another function which wipes the entire structure, frees everything
2016-09-27 17:47:21	pthreat	chrisf, I'm listening
2016-09-27 17:47:30	mthowe	No, your struct is in automatic storage.
2016-09-27 17:47:45	barfod	pthreat: there are _tons_ of ways to implement functions, and one common way that is much less error prone is to ave the programmer allocate the memory.
2016-09-27 17:47:56	mthowe	But that's the part everyone is referring to, it can get tricky remembering who owns what and what needs free'd.
2016-09-27 17:48:19	barfod	then the memory is allocated from the function that called it and is generally more accessible to whatever memory management model you have created
2016-09-27 17:48:35	pthreat	say I have a function which is named .. freePersonStruct(Person *p)
2016-09-27 17:49:03	pthreat	this is how I'm thinking to free my "Person" structure when I'm done with it
2016-09-27 17:49:09	mthowe	But you don't need to free your Person struct. Not in this case.

2016-09-27 17:51:08	barfod	it's more the way you are allocating memory within the function and then passing it out that needs some further explanation

2016-09-27 17:53:06	mthowe	Then as chrisf said, it's clear who owns what, and you free up the name when you freePerson()

2016-09-27 17:54:14	mthowe	Yep, that's better if possible. Like I said that's what I usually try to do. But obviously it's not always possible, and you have to mess around with flexible array members.
2016-09-27 17:54:29	pthreat	Yes I malloced space for the structure inside the functionThatReturnsAPersonStructPointer
2016-09-27 17:54:49	mthowe	So say you had char *first_name; char *last_name; now it's no longer really an option if you want those 2 kept in separate fields.
2016-09-27 17:55:05	barfod	you can use some statically allocated char buffer in the person struct
2016-09-27 17:55:26	pthreat	the whole point is for it to be dynamic, Person is Url in my code
2016-09-27 17:55:27	barfod	even, really the important thing here is allocating memory for N person structs eventually

2016-09-27 17:57:44	barfod	and each one could feasibly have the malloced region for the "name", however I think it would be easier to code the first time through by making them static char [1024] buffers

2016-09-27 17:59:26	barfod	well anyway. you can allocate to a member of the struct then

2016-09-27 22:59:31	baxt	[07:06:27] Good good, just testing the water. Thanks [07:06:27]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	jim	[07:09:05] baxt, how are you learning c now? studying from a book? class? both? [07:09:05]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	baxt	[07:10:18] Well I started by doing an online free study on Alison. [07:10:18]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	baxt	[07:10:37] Smashed that now I am reading a book while sat with my laptop. [07:10:37]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	baxt	[07:10:53] The book is learn c in 21days. [07:10:53]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	baxt	[07:11:24] Early days.. [07:11:24]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	baxt	[07:12:36] Got any pointers for resources [07:12:36]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	Stragus__	[07:14:56] Channel's topic appears to suggest http://www.iso-9899.info/wiki/Books [07:14:56]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	baxt	[07:16:27] I got a smash load of books already. [07:16:27]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	twkm	[07:17:13] then what other sort of resources were you hoping to find, so you can continue to avoid the books? [07:17:13]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	baxt	[07:17:13] Looking for people who know and places to read how it is used. Also where I can see other people's code. [07:17:13]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	twkm	[07:18:20] search engines should be able to find you a boat-load of code. [07:18:20]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	baxt	[07:18:20] Twkm: I read everyday, I do hours of study [07:18:20]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	twkm	[07:19:13] and you've found a place where there are people. [07:19:13]

2016-09-27 22:59:31	omx	[07:53:59] hey guys, for the past 13 months I've been working on my game framework. I reached a point where I'd like to start a new project,a game engine, but I do not know if I stll have to write it in C or I can go with C++ [07:53:59]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	izalove	[07:54:23] go with c++ [07:54:23]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	Algebr```	[07:54:51] What was wrong with SDL2 [07:54:51]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	omx	[07:55:04] do you think that will be the best option izalove ? [07:55:04]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	izalove	[07:55:12] yeah [07:55:12]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	omx	[07:56:16] I would not like to use anything newer then c11 [07:56:16]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	omx	[07:56:19] c++11 [07:56:19]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	omx	[07:56:24] even that is too new for me [07:56:24]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	omx	[07:56:29] is it still okay? [07:56:29]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	izalove	[07:56:59] sure [07:56:59]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	omx	[07:57:08] alright [07:57:08]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	twkm	[08:00:15] /me chuckles [08:00:15]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	kstar	[08:33:38] If I have a 2D array int **a, am I guaranteed that the locations are contiguous so that I may use int *p = *a and access linearly as for( i = 0; i < N * N; ++i ) { *p += 2; p++; } [08:33:38]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	twkm	[08:34:47] as an aside, a's not an array. [08:34:47]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	kstar	[08:35:48] I'm aware that there are subtle differences between arrays and int ** pointers, but sorry, I should've said int a[N][N] [08:35:48]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	phantomcircuit_	[08:38:18] is memset guaranteed to actually zero memory? or can optimization stuff prevent it? [08:38:18]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	twkm	[08:38:51] the latter is possible, and all bits zero isn't necessarily a zero value for all types. [08:38:51]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	twkm	[08:40:04] the classic example of the latter is when the thing being zeroed isn't obviously used again, thus there's no reason to actually do it. [08:40:04]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	twkm	[08:40:50] zeroing critical plaintext doesn't always happen, leaving them visible in memory for some period of time. [08:40:50]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	twkm	[08:41:00] e.g., passwords. [08:41:00]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	dv-_	[08:41:35] twkm: why not use a[n*n] [08:41:35]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	twkm	[08:42:27] why ask me?  maybe you want to ask kstar. [08:42:27]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	dv-_	[08:43:16] oh [08:43:16]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	omx	[08:52:57] I know #ifdef WIN32 works but does WIN64 work too? [08:52:57]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	Stragus__	[08:53:43] I use #elif defined(_WIN64) || defined(__WIN64__) || defined(WIN64) [08:53:43]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	omx	[08:53:59] I see [08:53:59]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	omx	[08:54:03] I'll try that,thx [08:54:03]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	Xanather	[08:57:42] typedef's are interchangeable right? [08:57:42]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	twkm	[08:58:15] with what? [08:58:15]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	twkm	[08:58:53] the alias they create is the same as the aliased type.  but are all aliases somehow compatible?  no. [08:58:53]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	Xanather	[08:59:02] As in "typedef int INT;" and INT could be used where parameters accept an int [08:59:02]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	twkm	[08:59:16] some compilers and all lints will bitch about that. [08:59:16]
2016-09-27 22:59:31	twkm	[08:59:29] also, all upper-case identifiers are expected to be macros. [08:59:29]

2016-09-27 23:00:58	Ploppz	I'm puzzled that 1 and 2 here isn't the same https://bpaste.net/show/9bc2f19abbc1 . I get a segfault on 1, but 2 works as expected. local_temp is an array of float*.

2016-09-27 23:03:20	twkm	Xanather: the one is an alias for the other.  some compilers these days believe they should be lints too, so don't expect much love for bothering with a typedef then ignoring it (which seems kooky, but whatever).

2016-09-28 04:28:15	aep4Ayai	That memmove question made me think: Is it even possible to write memmove that doesn't copy on a system where the same memory can be mapped in multiple locations? does the standard in some way disallow this case?
2016-09-28 04:28:15		[04:28]
2016-09-28 04:29:05	dminuoso	aep4Ayai: Mapped memory is something that the standard does not know about.
2016-09-28 04:29:26	dminuoso	aep4Ayai: The C language operates on a virtual machine, not on hardware.
2016-09-28 04:29:39	nHeck	so, the uintptr is not portable?
2016-09-28 04:29:57	dminuoso	nHeck: Well, the mapping from a pointer to uintptr is implementation defined.
2016-09-28 04:30:03	nHeck	damn
2016-09-28 04:30:08	aep4Ayai	alright let me formulate that differently: are memmove implementations such as the one above incorrect on systems that allow memory to be mapped multiple times?
2016-09-28 04:30:24	dminuoso	nHeck: Generally you can get away with assuming that its a 1:1 mapping for all common implementations though.
2016-09-28 04:30:50	nHeck	why would it be incorrect ? If it doesnt overlap it copy and its ok no?
2016-09-28 04:31:58	nHeck	~àdminuoso i don't know what a 1:1 mapping is :p

2016-09-28 10:12:00	twkm	you should expect the first statements of realloc to be: if (!ptr) return malloc(size); if (!size) { free(ptr); return 0; }
2016-09-28 10:12:44	twkm	if you want a reference i suggest h&s.
2016-09-28 10:12:52	hanshenrik_	not really, presumably for optimization purposes, you might get back the same pointer as you put in, even if it's a different size than before
2016-09-28 10:13:30	twkm	at any rate, there is no such guarantee as you seem to think exists.

2016-09-28 10:14:02	anonnumberanon	chrisf, So sorting the PWMs makes it so that you can write them in order to the pins while polling a timer that tells you whether or not it is the correct time to be sending that pwm at that specific time.
2016-09-28 10:14:51	pragma-	always use newp = realloc(oldp, size); if (!newp) { /* error */ } else { oldp = newp; /* optional */ }
