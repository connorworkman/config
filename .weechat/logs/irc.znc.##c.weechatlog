2016-09-15 22:15:41	twkm	scanf and printf aren't exact mirrors.  scanf needs pointer to float for its %f, but printf just needs a double (not a pointer to a double) to which the float will be promoted.  i.e., lose the second ampersand.
2016-09-15 22:15:43	Ascender	but it's obviously irritated by the data type selected there...and I could've sworn that's not been an issue in the past

2016-09-15 22:17:58	twkm	all arguments to scanf must be pointers, which scanf needs so it can assign to the caller's objects.  printf only needs a pointer in a few cases, mostly it just wants the value to print.
2016-09-15 22:18:48	twkm	they are similar, but they have some surprising differences too.

2016-09-15 22:36:37	Ascender	Can anyone explain why Visual studio is automatically creating the main function like this: int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])  -- the way I'm being taught is simply int main();  nothing else goin on with it
2016-09-15 22:36:54	Boohbah	So it might be -32768 on one machine, or -2147483648 on another, or another negative number.
2016-09-15 22:36:55	kb_	inb4 thats not a C problem

2016-09-15 22:37:55	@candide	Ascender: That is not a C issue. This channel exists for discussion of the Standard C Language itself; not tools such as Makefiles, IDEs, compilers (see ##workingset for these things) or random libraries (including OS-specific ones such as POSIX or Windows; see ##posix or #winapi).
2016-09-15 22:38:05	ap0c	you can make empty projects in vs and just create an empty file with the correct extensions and create everything manually
2016-09-15 22:38:37	Ascender	I understand...I wasn't sure if it was IDE-related but I'm not surprised
2016-09-15 22:38:50	ap0c	it's a pretty clunky program for creating small beginner projects though, feels like starting up AutoCAD or Photoshop with the loading

2016-09-16 07:32:49	Stragus	Oh, right.
2016-09-16 07:32:53	haasn	I could use an allocation type that has VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIt as well
2016-09-16 07:33:03	haasn	that would technically allow host to efficiently read it out again as if it was in local RAM
2016-09-16 07:34:26	haasn	Stragus: I guess the weird thing is that the memcpy() itself isn't really a performance problem, it runs more than fast enough
2016-09-16 07:34:31	haasn	but every now and then it just spikes
2016-09-16 07:34:47	Stragus	If the buffers are already allocated, locked/pinned, touched, and you just write them over again... I can't really see why performance would vary that much
2016-09-16 07:35:19	Stragus	Do you get the same spikes with memset()?

2016-09-16 08:02:12	latch	meh. I've deployed and used doxygen docs just fine. Biggest annoying thing IMO is how much you have to document your source to get it in doxygen (eg, having to document all the enums)
2016-09-16 08:02:34	latch	It turns from some lightly documented mess into some over-documented mess
2016-09-16 08:02:58	doppel	hah.

2016-09-16 08:13:41	masochist	as I said, organization is my problem with doxygen. it starts off with expecting you to know the implementation to know how to use it, which is precisely backwards

2016-09-16 10:39:14	atk	[20:32:57] I've been looking through the linux kernel and trying to work out a nice fix for this USB device I have that is misbehaving. (the kernel is too strict on it) But two years ago now I started the Eudyptula challenge as a fun thing I though I could get through. About a year ago it hit a snag on one question - they had a bug, a few hundred people got stuck in a queue for a task with no response and it took them a [20:32:57]
2016-09-16 10:39:14	atk	[20:32:57] year to realise. Now they realise and I got onto the next task which involved some basic (they said it was going to be difficult but it really wasn't in the slightest) sysfs stuff. And the next task seems to be to get code accepted into the kernel. So I am hoping I will have some spare time over the next few weeks, I can finally implement that fix for that device. [20:32:57]

2016-09-16 13:07:26	Stragus	But all libm functions like sqrt(), log() or whatever are not safe
2016-09-16 13:08:49	Stragus	Also, watch out for old x86 with the x87 and its 80 bits intermediary results... Just use SSE, -mfpmath=sse
2016-09-16 13:09:21	Stragus	Actually, the Intel compiler enables unsafe float optimizations by default, they must be explicitely disabled
2016-09-16 13:09:36	undecim	So as long as optimizations are disabled, all non-library float operations will have the exact same behavior?

2016-09-16 13:11:59	fizzie	"A floating expression may be /contracted/, that is, evaluated as though it were a single operation, thereby omitting rounding errors implied by the source code and the expression evaluation method. The FP_CONTRACT pragma in <math.h> provides a way to disallow contracted expressions. Otherwise, whether and how expressions are contracted is implementation-defined."
2016-09-16 13:12:27	fizzie	So that's not true with even a moderately strict interpretation of "all platforms".

2016-09-16 23:55:42	atk	[09:15:09] but it's not something you can do without setting up the web server first. [09:15:09]
2016-09-16 23:55:42	iamawesome	[09:15:18] Everyone will connect to that server program, how can i do it? [09:15:18]

2016-09-17 12:51:11	@candide	A memory leak occurs when a dynamically allocated memory is left without the free() counterpart being called. Valgrind is a tool to check memory leaks.

2016-09-17 12:52:43	sh4z	the other option is wait for a new version of the package
2016-09-17 12:53:10	sh4z	but I'm impatient and frankly the idea of searching through code for bugs intrests me ^^; I'm weird

2016-09-17 16:48:38	buu	So
2016-09-17 16:51:25	buu	v8 is a javascript interpreter. v8 runs as a virtual machine. I want to thread v8. v8 isn't at all threadsafe and needs to create a new v8 context object inside the new thread and store its stuff inside the new object. Given all that, will the pthreads still share memory for linked libraries in a similar way to fork's cow behavior?
2016-09-17 16:51:44	buu	And is there a tool that will tell me precisely how much non-shared memory a pthread is using?
2016-09-17 16:51:49	buu	Or a process for that matter

2016-09-17 16:55:15	buu	good point
2016-09-17 16:56:01	buu	So from my perspective each thread has its own instance of the v8 context object, but obviously they're all shared because they're threads..

2016-09-17 16:56:54	buu	So I mean, at a very basic level, if I have thread A and it uses 1mb of ram, then I spawn a pthread B and inside that thread I malloc 1kb of memory, my total process size only increases by 1kb right?
2016-09-17 16:56:56	Maxdamantus	"threads" in Linux are just what people call processes (well, tasks) that share an address space.

2016-09-17 17:04:45	Maxdamantus	If you have a 150 MiB library and run two separate programs that use it, you wouldn't expect it to use 300 MiB for the two programs.
2016-09-17 17:06:13	Maxdamantus	it wouldn't even immediately load 150 MiB usually. It would just denote that some pages map to places in that file, and when the processes pagefault trying to access those pages it'll load them into memory.

2016-09-17 20:42:07	Kaslai	The linker also needs to be able to tell the binary that it needs to load xyz library when starting up. How do you expect it to do that if you don't tell it what libraries you need to run the application?
2016-09-17 20:43:01	joebobjoe	Kaslai: to your second point, yes, I see now why you need the name of the .dylib at run time to load
2016-09-17 20:43:54	sjohnson	Kaslai: to play devil's advocate, "the header files".
2016-09-17 20:43:56	joebobjoe	Kaslai: but many times we distribute binaries where we don't know what the actual dylib will be. so why bother checking the machine local dylib
2016-09-17 20:44:29	sjohnson	in response to: "... if you don't tell it what libraries you need to run the application?"
2016-09-17 20:44:42	joebobjoe	I just did an otool -l a.out, and apparently the -l libraries I linked to have their absolute path embedded in a.out
2016-09-17 20:44:43	Kaslai	To make sure that it actually has the function "foo_do_bar()" in it or whatever
2016-09-17 20:44:51	sjohnson	#include "/blah/openssl.h"
2016-09-17 20:45:03	sjohnson	kind of hints that openssl might be used.
2016-09-17 20:45:25	Kaslai	The linker needs to map any function call to a code address, and the linker will complain if it can't do that
2016-09-17 20:45:30	joebobjoe	sjohnson: but openssl does have different names for the actual libraries, and verion numbers in those names
2016-09-17 20:45:40	joebobjoe	libcrypto and libssl
2016-09-17 20:45:59	joebobjoe	Kaslai: but it only does that at run time I thought
2016-09-17 20:45:59	sjohnson	yeah, that confuses me a lot too, especially when you see 3 or 4 dll's lying around.
2016-09-17 20:46:04	Kaslai	If you don't specify the library to link to, the compiler doesn't know that there are all of these foo_* functions in a library which can be relied upon
2016-09-17 20:46:23	sjohnson	libeay, libssl, etc.

2016-09-17 20:49:25		[20:49]
2016-09-17 20:49:39	joebobjoe	Kaslai: do you actually have to name your functions after thelibrary name like that?
2016-09-17 20:49:50	Kaslai	It's platform specific. It would be possible for an application loader to fill in stubs left by the linker with direct calls into a shared binary (dll)
2016-09-17 20:49:54	Kaslai	And no you don't
2016-09-17 20:50:02	Kaslai	It's just conventional
2016-09-17 20:50:36	Kaslai	Most of SDL's functions begin with sdl_, however that's a choice of the SDL authors, so that name collisions won't happen.
2016-09-17 20:50:55	sjohnson	Kaslai: one thing i don't understand is why just using -L isn't enough.  e.g., can't it scan through all the libraries to find the function calls it needs?  or does the -l foo narrow it down a bit, in case > 1 libraries has the same function name or something.

2016-09-17 20:51:47	Kaslai	It would be a pointless waste of resources to scan through potentially 10k+ libraries for a given function name, and there could be a name collision.
2016-09-17 20:51:56	joebobjoe	Kaslai: so using the linker at compile time for linking to shared libs is just a verification step
2016-09-17 20:52:04	joebobjoe	Kaslai: you don't *actually* need it
2016-09-17 20:52:11	Kaslai	No, you do actually need it
2016-09-17 20:52:47	joebobjoe	Kaslai: but I mean the dynamic linker resolves the names right?
2016-09-17 20:52:51	Kaslai	As I said, the linker needs to connect all of the stub function calls in the object code to actually valid code
2016-09-17 20:53:07	sjohnson	you just said though that it could be done, albeit a waste of time.
2016-09-17 20:53:18	sjohnson	provided that function names don't collide, and you have time to kill.

2016-09-17 20:54:46	Kaslai	If the code you're trying to call is in a dynamic library, the linker needs to know that the function is in fact inside the dynamic library so that it can put hooks in the executable format to tell the loader to load said libraries, as well as leave the stub function calls in so that they actually do what is expected at run time.

2016-09-17 20:59:22	Kaslai	joebobjoe: shared objects export their function names so that they can be loaded by name at runtime. On Linux, this is done by default, on Windows, you have to explicitly export them with __declspec(dllexport) (or whatever it is; it's been a while since I did Windows programming)

2016-09-17 21:05:12	Kaslai	Not really, because most software developers strive to use a unique name
2016-09-17 21:06:03	Xgc	sjohnson: No.  There's also no mechanism for dealing out names, like domains.  So you just have to be careful.
2016-09-17 21:06:49	Kaslai	And there is a semi-defined order of directories to search. The linker proceeds through the list of directories one by one, checking for a library by the given name. When the library is found, that is the library the linker uses.
2016-09-17 21:06:53	Xgc	sjohnson: That name space is just not controlled.

2016-09-17 21:24:35	Kaslai	sjohnson: It's a link time problem though. Even if the translation units (".c files") were separate and included the prototypes for the different functions, when it comes time to link the translation units together, all the references to the function will use the local version.

2016-09-17 21:28:27	Kaslai	The linker doesn't really care about things like calling conventions or arguments or anything like that. It just sees that a symbol has an address, and that other places in the code are referring to that symbol, so paste in the address!

2016-09-17 23:06:00	atk	It doesn't solve any problem, it just creates more problems.
2016-09-17 23:06:09	Kaslai	Red Hat is trying to take over the linux ecosystem, basically. People don't like that.
2016-09-17 23:06:38	Kaslai	They've been forbidden from tainting the kernel, so they're trying to make everything else depend on systemd, so that they get a similar level of control.
2016-09-17 23:08:13	atk	It doesn't solve sequencing startup correctly (one of the things it claims to solve). There's two things they provide: specifying a service is "up" when a pidfile is written (pidfiles suck and are most often not an indicator of a service being "up"), or you can call a library function - not really portable, systemd specific - there are better ways to solve these problems.
2016-09-17 23:09:04	atk	People should first of all write software which doesn't catastrophically fail if the right conditions of network state or related supporting software are not met.

2016-09-17 23:09:20	atk	It's usually not difficult to have a timeout which waits for syslog or network to be up.
2016-09-17 23:09:27	atk	No need to "sequence" anything then
2016-09-17 23:09:44	atk	you just start everything in parallel and it sequences itself on its own accord (this is the best and simplest solution)
2016-09-17 23:10:09	atk	The second option is to do what certain runit derivatives which support sequencing boot do: use a file

2016-09-17 23:11:35	atk	But this is sub-optimal since it makes the supervisor's code more complicated, the easier solution would be if software could just wait on its own accord.
2016-09-17 23:11:50	atk	Honestly not a difficult thing to implement and means that this "sequencing" becomes a non-issue.

2016-09-18 09:13:46	CodFection	[18:15:49] which compiler and text editor / ide is preferred? for C [18:15:49]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	Moto-chan	[18:19:17] Whatever code editor you prefer, your compiler of choice, and make. [18:19:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	TommyC	[18:19:23] Pick one and get coding. [18:19:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	Moto-chan	[18:19:26] Screw IDEs imo. [18:19:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	atk	[18:19:33] Hmm. [18:19:33]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	TommyC	[18:19:35] Ain't nobody got time for that shit. :3 [18:19:35]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	Moto-chan	[18:19:37] They're mostly just noise and template code that you'll never use. [18:19:37]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	CodFection	[18:20:16] TommyC, that pretty much tells me. thanks [18:20:16]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	atk	[18:21:29] Use vim [18:21:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	atk	[18:21:31] Or emacs [18:21:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	atk	[18:21:39] Implement the IDE _inside_ the editor. [18:21:39]

2016-09-18 09:13:46	@candide	[18:22:01] Title of Moto-chan's link: xkcd: Real Programmers [18:22:01]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	Moto-chan	[18:22:04] ^ relevant [18:22:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	jonbryan	[18:22:35] You can watch youtube in emacs now. time to make the switch. [18:22:35]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	CodFection	[18:22:40] lol Moto-chan [18:22:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:23:04] emacs is a pretty good operating system, has everything but a good text editor. [18:23:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	atk	[18:24:22] This is why you just run vim inside emacs terminal emulator. [18:24:22]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	hypnopothesis	[18:27:55] there is spacemacs that is focused on vim [18:27:55]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	atk	[18:29:29] for spackers? [18:29:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	hypnopothesis	[18:34:02] not sure what a spacker is but you can use vim bindings in emacs [18:34:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	atk	[18:36:41] It's an insult commonly used here in the UK. Or well, the area of the UK that I live in. [18:36:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	atk	[18:36:45] It means "spastic" [18:36:45]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	atk	[18:37:20] I was just commenting on how the name, when said aloud, sounds a bit like: spack-emacs [18:37:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	atk	[18:37:39] You can also say it as such: space-macs. [18:37:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	sjohnson	[18:41:09] atk are you a UK native? [18:41:09]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	sjohnson	[18:41:23] like, have the british accent and everything? [18:41:23]

2016-09-18 09:13:47	Veltas	[18:41:52] No such thing as real British people, move along [18:41:52]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	atk	[18:42:13] I guess some people try to insist I don't, but I also certainly don't have a Polish accent, I have confused plenty of brits who thought I was from all sorts of parts of the UK. [18:42:13]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	atk	[18:42:21] I have lived here for most of my life now so... [18:42:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	atk	[18:42:40] I certainly call people twats and wankers. [18:42:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	pragma-	[18:42:48] so what you're saying is that you don't know how to speak? [18:42:48]

2016-09-18 20:04:33	ap0c	that loop just prints numbers from 5 to -1
2016-09-18 20:05:10	ap0c	why would you use the indicator value in that situation if you aren't dealing with text streams and it's just a static loop?

2016-09-18 20:05:35	ap0c	In computing, end-of-file (commonly abbreviated EOF) is a condition in a computer operating system where no more data can be read from a data source. The data source is usually called a file or stream.

2016-09-18 20:49:08	spal	Another thing worth noting is that on Linux (I am being implementation specific here), pressing ^D does not necessarily indicate EOF. ^D is used to indicate an EOF only when you haven't typed anything in the line yet. What happens in reality is that pressing ^D causes the underlying read() call to return with whatever data it has put into the buffe
2016-09-18 20:49:08	spal	r.
2016-09-18 20:49:29	spal	For example, if you have a getchar() in a loop, e.g. while (1) { int c = getchar(); printf("%c (%d)\n", c); }, and if you type a string immediately followed by "foo^D", you'll see "f", "o", "o" consumed and printed immediately. ^D merely forces read() to return which ultimately results in getchar() consuming the characters read by read() into a buf
2016-09-18 20:49:30	spal	fer.
2016-09-18 20:49:43	spal	Note that a similar thing happens when you enter a newline. That's why if you type "foo<ENTER>", you'll see "f", "o", "o" consumed and printed immediately.

2016-09-19 08:26:37	kst	Promotion occurs when the visible declaration is not a prototype (don't do that, always use prototypes), or for variadic functions like printf.  For those cases, the compiler can't tell what the expected type is.  Integers narrower than int are promoted to int (if int can hold all values in the range of the source type) or to unsigned int.  float is promoted to double.  Other types are not converted.

2016-09-19 14:09:01	marchelzo	oh, ok. i thought maybe the first two were placed on the heap, the third one was statically allocated, and the rest were on the stack.

2016-09-20 03:37:16	atk	The simplest one I can find which doesn't require installing all of kde with it (/me stares at kcachegrind) would be https://sourceforge.net/projects/tceetree/

2016-09-20 12:40:13	PinkTieGuy	Hey all - hoping for some guidance. I'm quite new to C. The majority of what I've done in C is programming AVRs. I've got decent experience using Matlab for doing some numerical method work and I'd really like to start doing it in C. My question has to do with how I should be setting up arrays. Say I'm doing a simple theta method where I'll end up with an 4x10000 array - should I be using static allocation or
2016-09-20 12:40:13	PinkTieGuy	 dynamic allocation to set up that array? Thanks :)
2016-09-20 12:40:42	Stragus	Definitely dynamic for anything that isn't tiny

2016-09-20 12:41:40	PinkTieGuy	Stragus : So it's unlike Matlab where I would preallocate a certain empty array?

2016-09-20 13:21:27	PinkTieGuy	montanonic : Thanks will take a look. What about Fortran? I guess I'm wondering which would be the most widely used, if not necessarily the absolute fastest as well...
2016-09-20 13:22:45	montanonic	PinkTieGuy: Fortran was created around 1955. You don't want to write Fortran, you just want to use the crazy fast libraries it has to do sci-comp. Julia, like all other languages targetting sci-comp, uses many Fortran libraries under the hood, and makes it easy to call into arbitrary Fortran code natively.
2016-09-20 13:23:36	Stragus	I would suggest sticking to C, then you also would be able to read or write other software if you ever need it

2016-09-20 18:31:41	caze	Okay, and this point is crucial: Initialization is not the same as assignment.

2016-09-20 18:53:20	Boobuigi	[04:29:03] walb0: You can initialize an array but not with malloc(). [04:29:03]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	Boobuigi	[04:29:14] int n[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; [04:29:14]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:29:18] I've done it many times before though [04:29:18]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	caze	[04:29:42] What? array{0,1,2}? [04:29:42]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:30:00] array = {0,1,2} you know what I mean, [04:30:00]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:30:21] array = {0} is simply make each index = 0 [04:30:21]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	caze	[04:30:22] No, you have not. [04:30:22]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	caze	[04:30:46] You may have initialized arrays like that, but you've never assigned arrays like that. [04:30:46]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:31:16] Yes I meant initialise [04:31:16]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:31:41] so when I calloc some memory, can i then use the location[i] like that < [04:31:41]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	caze	[04:31:41] Okay, and this point is crucial: Initialization is not the same as assignment. [04:31:41]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:31:43] using [] [04:31:43]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:31:57] yes okay, caze didn't know what you meant before by assign [04:31:57]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	caze	[04:33:08] Now, going back to your original question, how would you initialize a malloc'ed array? [04:33:08]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:35:39] no idea [04:35:39]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:39:35] how do u caze [04:39:35]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	caze	[04:40:43] You cannot. [04:40:43]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:41:42] can i use it like an array? [04:41:42]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:41:51] e.g. location[i] = 1 [04:41:51]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	caze	[04:42:07] Yes. [04:42:07]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:42:12] great [04:42:12]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:42:55] my teacher has typedef'd all these words to int, it's weird [04:42:55]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	pthreat	[04:44:13] I've grown used to stupid high level languages, fuck [04:44:13]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	pthreat	[04:44:27] walb0, what, typedef uint8 stuff like that ? [04:44:27]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:50:41] like typdef LocationID as int [04:50:41]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	walb0	[04:50:50] so you use LocationID variable instead of int variable [04:50:50]
2016-09-20 18:53:20	caze	[04:51:00] Neither of those are variables. [04:51:00]

2016-09-20 19:52:10	caze	Okay, but you put the return type as int. How is that returning the array?
2016-09-20 19:53:07	walb0	isn't that how you do that? the array has type ints
2016-09-20 19:53:23	walb0	the type of the array is int isn't it?
2016-09-20 19:53:36	caze	Nope, and nope.
2016-09-20 19:53:54	caze	walb0: into foo(void) { return 42; } Is this function returning an array of ints?

2016-09-20 19:54:26	walb0	it doesn't necessarily mean array but what is the correct way then

2016-09-21 06:53:21	tumeric	thanks marchelzo. struct _WisdomList  *head = NULL; is it setting the struct to NULL?

2016-09-21 07:12:19	bone	Malkrith: well, when you run strlen on a buffer that may or may not have a null terminator, you'll potentially get a very large length returned, and strcpy is going to go blast away at that length.

2016-09-21 10:21:52	cousteau	when you say it "uses both", do you mean you can write standard C for Arduino (the IDE, not the board) and it will work?
2016-09-21 10:22:15	cousteau	like   char *new = "hello";
2016-09-21 10:22:54	cousteau	or that you can code in C for Arduino using AVR Studio?

2016-09-21 10:23:44	megaTherion	Arduino sucks
2016-09-21 10:23:47	cousteau	or that "the documentation says that it uses C/C++"?
2016-09-21 10:24:06	cousteau	matkatmusic, you can't really code in C unless that C is also C++
2016-09-21 10:24:34	matkatmusic	well, you seem to know more about it than me so why are you asking me if you can code in C on it lol
2016-09-21 10:24:41	cousteau	because the Arduino IDE interprets its stuff as C++, not as C
2016-09-21 10:24:43	matkatmusic	I just wrote some C functions.
2016-09-21 10:24:47	matkatmusic	and they worked fine
2016-09-21 10:25:11	bone	not having a class does not make them C functions.  they're still C++.
2016-09-21 10:25:17	cousteau	"I just did X and it worked fine"... yeah, good luck with that learning technique
2016-09-21 10:25:26	megaTherion	he has no clue what he does at all
2016-09-21 10:25:54	megaTherion	but anyways arduino is for people who cant even get some wire and an chip and solder themselfs some oscilator on some board... so what to expect
2016-09-21 10:26:14	matkatmusic	anyway.  Just need to know the syntax to pass in the address of a single byte from a byte array into a function expecting a pointer to a byte
2016-09-21 10:26:27	megaTherion	matkatmusic: how about get a book for C (or C++)?
2016-09-21 10:26:30	megaTherion	!books
2016-09-21 10:26:30	@candide	See http://www.iso-9899.info/wiki/Books for some useful book recommendations, including free online resources!
2016-09-21 10:26:40	cousteau	C++ is similar to C but with some extra features; therefore it is likely that pure C code will work as C++, but that's all, it doesn't mean that it supports C, it means that it supports C++ that is also valid C, sometimes
2016-09-21 10:26:55	matkatmusic	anyway.  Just need to know the syntax to pass in the address of a single byte from a byte array into a function expecting a pointer to a byte

2016-09-21 10:28:13	matkatmusic	er, byteArray + index
2016-09-21 10:28:13	cousteau	yes... then again, that's one of the "fun" things in C++: there you can overload the [] and & operators, so obscure stuff can happen if the array isn't really an array but a weird class
2016-09-21 10:28:35	cousteau	yes, byteArray will behave as a pointer in that case, and pointer arithmetic works like that
2016-09-21 10:29:01	cousteau	(in that expression I mean; not that byteArray is really a pointer)
2016-09-21 10:29:16	matkatmusic	awesome.  Thank you so much!  Way more helpful than megaTherion, who seems lonely and needs a puppy

2016-09-21 15:18:41	catern	marchelzo: no no, this is on system calls
2016-09-21 15:18:47	Malkrith	today I learned that C does not take care of anything for me
2016-09-21 15:18:49	Malkrith	Unlike perl
2016-09-21 15:18:55	Malkrith	Which saddens me

2016-09-21 15:19:59	Malkrith	I am
2016-09-21 15:20:09	catern	hmmmmmmmmmm this is tricky. I want a macro that can turn:
2016-09-21 15:20:09	catern	val = try(syscall());
2016-09-21 15:20:12	catern	into the equivalent of
2016-09-21 15:20:31	mamooth_ponyboy	im totally clueless about this annotation thing - I better go search
2016-09-21 15:20:31	catern	int ret = syscall(); if (ret < 0) exit(1); val = ret;

2016-09-21 15:20:38	sjohnson	Malkrith: yep, C won't do anything automatic for you like higher-level languages like Perl, Python, PHP, etc.
2016-09-21 15:20:55	Malkrith	I am quite aware of that now
2016-09-21 15:20:58	marchelzo	Malkrith: is it because Larry Wall is religious?
2016-09-21 15:21:04	catern	marchelzo: do you have a suggestion on how to do it? it seems kind of tricky because I want to actually return the value as well as check it
2016-09-21 15:21:05	Hello71	catern: macros are *text*
2016-09-21 15:21:08	sjohnson	Malkrith: the cost though with perl (or others) is slower code than C.
2016-09-21 15:21:13	Malkrith	Who is larry wall
2016-09-21 15:21:20	sjohnson	wow.
2016-09-21 15:21:21	catern	Hello71: I am aware, yet this still may be possible
2016-09-21 15:21:21	Hello71	lucky for you though you can implement that in a function
