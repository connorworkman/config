2016-09-15 22:15:41	twkm	scanf and printf aren't exact mirrors.  scanf needs pointer to float for its %f, but printf just needs a double (not a pointer to a double) to which the float will be promoted.  i.e., lose the second ampersand.
2016-09-15 22:15:43	Ascender	but it's obviously irritated by the data type selected there...and I could've sworn that's not been an issue in the past

2016-09-15 22:17:58	twkm	all arguments to scanf must be pointers, which scanf needs so it can assign to the caller's objects.  printf only needs a pointer in a few cases, mostly it just wants the value to print.
2016-09-15 22:18:48	twkm	they are similar, but they have some surprising differences too.

2016-09-15 22:36:37	Ascender	Can anyone explain why Visual studio is automatically creating the main function like this: int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])  -- the way I'm being taught is simply int main();  nothing else goin on with it
2016-09-15 22:36:54	Boohbah	So it might be -32768 on one machine, or -2147483648 on another, or another negative number.
2016-09-15 22:36:55	kb_	inb4 thats not a C problem

2016-09-15 22:37:55	@candide	Ascender: That is not a C issue. This channel exists for discussion of the Standard C Language itself; not tools such as Makefiles, IDEs, compilers (see ##workingset for these things) or random libraries (including OS-specific ones such as POSIX or Windows; see ##posix or #winapi).
2016-09-15 22:38:05	ap0c	you can make empty projects in vs and just create an empty file with the correct extensions and create everything manually
2016-09-15 22:38:37	Ascender	I understand...I wasn't sure if it was IDE-related but I'm not surprised
2016-09-15 22:38:50	ap0c	it's a pretty clunky program for creating small beginner projects though, feels like starting up AutoCAD or Photoshop with the loading

2016-09-16 07:32:49	Stragus	Oh, right.
2016-09-16 07:32:53	haasn	I could use an allocation type that has VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIt as well
2016-09-16 07:33:03	haasn	that would technically allow host to efficiently read it out again as if it was in local RAM
2016-09-16 07:34:26	haasn	Stragus: I guess the weird thing is that the memcpy() itself isn't really a performance problem, it runs more than fast enough
2016-09-16 07:34:31	haasn	but every now and then it just spikes
2016-09-16 07:34:47	Stragus	If the buffers are already allocated, locked/pinned, touched, and you just write them over again... I can't really see why performance would vary that much
2016-09-16 07:35:19	Stragus	Do you get the same spikes with memset()?

2016-09-16 08:02:12	latch	meh. I've deployed and used doxygen docs just fine. Biggest annoying thing IMO is how much you have to document your source to get it in doxygen (eg, having to document all the enums)
2016-09-16 08:02:34	latch	It turns from some lightly documented mess into some over-documented mess
2016-09-16 08:02:58	doppel	hah.

2016-09-16 08:13:41	masochist	as I said, organization is my problem with doxygen. it starts off with expecting you to know the implementation to know how to use it, which is precisely backwards
2016-09-16 08:14:12	masochist	you don't say `man stdlib.h` to get the docs for, e.g. malloc; that doesn't make sense

2016-09-16 10:39:14	atk	[20:32:57] I've been looking through the linux kernel and trying to work out a nice fix for this USB device I have that is misbehaving. (the kernel is too strict on it) But two years ago now I started the Eudyptula challenge as a fun thing I though I could get through. About a year ago it hit a snag on one question - they had a bug, a few hundred people got stuck in a queue for a task with no response and it took them a [20:32:57]
2016-09-16 10:39:14	atk	[20:32:57] year to realise. Now they realise and I got onto the next task which involved some basic (they said it was going to be difficult but it really wasn't in the slightest) sysfs stuff. And the next task seems to be to get code accepted into the kernel. So I am hoping I will have some spare time over the next few weeks, I can finally implement that fix for that device. [20:32:57]

2016-09-16 13:07:26	Stragus	But all libm functions like sqrt(), log() or whatever are not safe
2016-09-16 13:08:49	Stragus	Also, watch out for old x86 with the x87 and its 80 bits intermediary results... Just use SSE, -mfpmath=sse
2016-09-16 13:09:21	Stragus	Actually, the Intel compiler enables unsafe float optimizations by default, they must be explicitely disabled
2016-09-16 13:09:36	undecim	So as long as optimizations are disabled, all non-library float operations will have the exact same behavior?

2016-09-16 13:11:59	fizzie	"A floating expression may be /contracted/, that is, evaluated as though it were a single operation, thereby omitting rounding errors implied by the source code and the expression evaluation method. The FP_CONTRACT pragma in <math.h> provides a way to disallow contracted expressions. Otherwise, whether and how expressions are contracted is implementation-defined."
2016-09-16 13:12:27	fizzie	So that's not true with even a moderately strict interpretation of "all platforms".

2016-09-16 16:55:53	izalove	when fixed size integers were added, did nobody think about stuff like strtouint32_t?

2016-09-16 17:00:53	rawrawrer	wow didn't know about strtoumax, but for those classes, you'd just get the intmax_t or uintmax_t type and cast.
2016-09-16 17:02:04	izalove	thanks that's why strtol strtoul strtoll strtoull exist

2016-09-16 17:04:14	twkm	i.e., just because the intN_t's must be 2's complement doesn't mean the system cannot trap on overflow, though it is pretty unlikely.
2016-09-16 17:05:57	twkm	that there's no strtointN is merely because nobody raised a ruckus.

2016-09-16 17:09:52	twkm	it wouldn't be wrong to couple the existence of intN_t with a corresponding strtointN(), it just isn't likely to be needed or wasn't considered worth fighting about.
