I would like to look over all folders in /var/log/customers There's a load of folders inside that one, but I'm only interested in 2 formats. core* and uas* Is there a way to combine these loops in 1 loop as something like "  for foldername in /var/log/customers/core0*/ OR /var/log/customers/uas*/ ; do   "    This is what I have as two seperate loops right now http://pastebin.com/t

2016-09-16 04:39:49	larryv	where
2016-09-16 04:39:59	F1act	just after the bash script is complete
2016-09-16 04:40:30	larryv	after the bash script that sources the ~/dev_env file finishes?

2016-09-16 04:40:38	F1act	yes
2016-09-16 04:40:43	greycat	If you type "source /foo" in an interactive shell, and "/foo" contains "export FOO=bar" and nothing else, and then you run "env | grep FOO", you should see it.
2016-09-16 04:41:04	greycat	One of these assumptions must be false.
2016-09-16 04:41:08	larryv	the bash script cannot modify the environment of the parent
2016-09-16 04:41:13	greycat	At this point my money is on "and nothing else".
2016-09-16 04:41:29	greycat	If you use source, you're not running a script.  You're sourcing a file.
2016-09-16 04:42:01	F1act	Then how I can changing it using a bash_script?
2016-09-16 04:42:13	F1act	Would python work?
2016-09-16 04:42:26	F1act	btw.. I'm new to bash scripting.
2016-09-16 04:42:28	larryv	i'm guessing (since it was never explicitly stated) that F1act has a script "foo" that sources "dev_env", and is running "./foo; env" or "bash foo; env" or whatever
2016-09-16 04:42:40	greycat	You CANNOT change an interactive shell's variables using ANY kind of child process, whether that be a bash script, a python script, or whatever.
2016-09-16 04:42:43	greycat	You must use source.
2016-09-16 04:42:58	F1act	Ok, thanks for clearing that up.
2016-09-16 04:43:02	greycat	F1act: What *exactly* are you typing in your interactive shell?

2016-09-16 17:10:39	stacks88	when i put that in file.txt and do cat file.txt | jq '.' like i would w/ usual json output, i instead get parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 18 so i guess i wont be able to use jq for this

2016-09-16 17:13:45	izalove	and slap them in the face
2016-09-16 17:14:03	twkm	else you are just guessing and it might later come back to bite you.
2016-09-16 17:14:26	stacks88	ok np thx
