2016-09-16 04:39:59	F1act	just after the bash script is complete
2016-09-16 04:40:30	larryv	after the bash script that sources the ~/dev_env file finishes?

2016-09-16 04:40:38	F1act	yes
2016-09-16 04:40:43	greycat	If you type "source /foo" in an interactive shell, and "/foo" contains "export FOO=bar" and nothing else, and then you run "env | grep FOO", you should see it.
2016-09-16 04:41:04	greycat	One of these assumptions must be false.
2016-09-16 04:41:08	larryv	the bash script cannot modify the environment of the parent
2016-09-16 04:41:13	greycat	At this point my money is on "and nothing else".
2016-09-16 04:41:29	greycat	If you use source, you're not running a script.  You're sourcing a file.
2016-09-16 04:42:01	F1act	Then how I can changing it using a bash_script?
2016-09-16 04:42:13	F1act	Would python work?
2016-09-16 04:42:26	F1act	btw.. I'm new to bash scripting.
2016-09-16 04:42:28	larryv	i'm guessing (since it was never explicitly stated) that F1act has a script "foo" that sources "dev_env", and is running "./foo; env" or "bash foo; env" or whatever
2016-09-16 04:42:40	greycat	You CANNOT change an interactive shell's variables using ANY kind of child process, whether that be a bash script, a python script, or whatever.
2016-09-16 04:42:43	greycat	You must use source.
2016-09-16 04:42:58	F1act	Ok, thanks for clearing that up.
2016-09-16 04:43:02	greycat	F1act: What *exactly* are you typing in your interactive shell?

2016-09-16 17:10:09	pasteban	Paste is available without javascript on http://hastebin.com/raw/meboyobixo
2016-09-16 17:10:39	stacks88	when i put that in file.txt and do cat file.txt | jq '.' like i would w/ usual json output, i instead get parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 18 so i guess i wont be able to use jq for this

2016-09-16 20:39:09	sjohnson	i think it can be done that way but i'm not positive.
2016-09-16 20:39:14	sjohnson	"visudo"
2016-09-16 20:39:24	sjohnson	might fire up nano and not vi, depending on your computer.
2016-09-16 20:39:53	yitz	It will fire up $EDITOR or vi

2016-09-16 20:47:45	sjohnson	i sometimes do it.
2016-09-16 20:47:55	sjohnson	uuos maybe.
2016-09-16 20:48:00	yitz	Sometimes mindless?
2016-09-16 20:48:22	sjohnson	i don't make that mistake as much when i colour-code my prompt when i'm su'd in to remind me.
2016-09-16 20:49:32	tom99	I just have a terminal window open with root access at all times.
2016-09-16 20:49:36	tom99	makes things like apt-get much easier
2016-09-16 20:50:39	sjohnson	yitz: looks like the root being in sudoers is to explicitly allow root to run commands as other users.
2016-09-16 20:50:50	sjohnson	maybe the thing i mentioned above too, but i haven't tested it.
2016-09-16 20:51:09	Celmor	so... anyone got tips how I could get my sudoers rules behave like one would expect?

2016-09-16 21:07:16	sjohnson	instead of copying all of that bullshit over to root's .bash_aliases or .bashrc, etc.

All other variable names should be lowercase. Since variable names are case-sensitive, this convention avoids accidentally overriding environmental and internal variables.

It deploys php-fpm+CMS jails on freeBSD. i pass variables to the script such as domains, tlds, subdomains, ip, etc. i wish to make the script read in a file that has the config information in it, that way if i ever need to reinstall i can simply foreach through each conf file for each website and a lot of the hard work is done. How might i accomplish this best and how do i pass variables between them?

2016-09-18 09:13:50	iamawesome	[16:36:05] I'm in tht 3rd tab of gnome-terminal. I want to see the history of 2nd terminal. [16:36:05]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	pragma-	[16:36:19] shibly returns. [16:36:19]

2016-09-18 09:13:50	greybot	[16:36:46] iamawesome: Not a #bash question. We're no experts in that software or OS; consider asking the channel or mailing list with experts on that topic (eg. ##linux #openssh #ubuntu #zsh). [16:36:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	Mohan	[16:37:18] you can setup bash to update history immediately [16:37:18]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	llua	[16:37:19] sounds like a bash question [16:37:19]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	Mohan	[16:38:27] http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/088 [16:38:27]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	Mohan	[16:40:05] iamawesome, checkout that link.. its not ideal but gives you an option. [16:40:05]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	Mohan	[16:43:38] dfib, http://blog.hellosa.org/2013/07/27/log-bash-history-to-syslog-on-centos-6.html it seems you can log all bash commands to syslog via a recompiled bash. [16:43:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	lopid	[16:44:54] or you could use logger [16:44:54]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	Mohan	[16:45:36] like a wrapper around bash ? [16:45:36]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	lopid	[16:46:23] in PROMPT_COMMAND, for example [16:46:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	dfib	[16:46:27] Mohan i love you [16:46:27]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	Mohan	[16:47:32] lopid, Just noticed it. thanks. [16:47:32]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	llua	[17:03:12] that syslog option is pretty dumb, since a user can disable history and bash will stop forwarding stuff to syslog [17:03:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	lopid	[17:03:44] yes [17:03:44]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	llua	[17:09:01] dfib: anything you do at the shell level can be circumvented pretty easily [17:09:01]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	dfib	[17:14:00] But I should atleast know when its circumvented. Because the command to disable it will be tracked before it's run right? and i could set up a tripwire on bash{rc,_profile} to tell when it was modified [17:14:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	dfib	[17:14:50] It's meant for basically tracking tech support that is working on the servers. I dont expect a high level of espionage, and it's also good for if "mysql crashed, who did it" [17:14:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	grawity	[17:15:14] better enable tty logging in sudo [17:15:14]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	dfib	[17:15:25] For use-case, I think it would work. I'm tottally down for better options if you guys have any however [17:15:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	lopid	[17:17:29] process accounting would be a "better" option [17:17:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	dfib	[17:18:01] Additional* ? [17:18:01]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	lopid	[17:18:20] could be [17:18:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	lopid	[17:18:51] you could at least question why someone in the team disabled bash logging [17:18:51]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	llua	[17:19:40] don't have to disable to avoid it either [17:19:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	llua	[17:19:59] just one of the many ways to escape the playpen [17:19:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	dfib	[17:22:31] I just find it hard to believe this isn't a more common requirement for environments. track wtf is going on. know of any better playpens llua? [17:22:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	llua	[17:22:57] dfib: i don't remember if the shopt to disable history is sent before logging is disabled, pretty sure it isn't [17:22:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	dfib	[17:22:59] I'd still rather have this as opposed to nothing. [17:22:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	llua	[17:23:17] you can do that interactively without changing a .bashrc [17:23:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	lopid	[17:23:47] if mysql crashed, it's probably mysql's fault :) [17:23:47]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	dfib	[17:23:52] But with the modified bash, it should track that before it's executed. [17:23:52]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	llua	[17:24:53] i habatually disable history in shells when working on client machines, if its the first command a person does, you have nothing in the history. or the stuff they don't mind someone seeing [17:24:53]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	storge	[17:27:59] llua: hwo do you do that [17:27:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	phy1729	[17:33:50] auditd can track every exec [17:33:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	llua	[17:48:41] storge: depends on the shell, but bash is just set +o history [17:48:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	no_gravity	[18:02:24] "ls somedir" shows me 26 files. but "ls somedir | wc" tells me it's 27. Any ideas why? [18:02:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	no_gravity	[18:02:42] Ah, it outputs a total. [18:02:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	phy1729	[18:04:32] # touch $'\n\n\n\n\n\n'; ls | wc [18:04:32]

2016-09-18 09:13:50	no_gravity	[18:05:36] Man, I was hoping for a fancy bash bot. [18:05:36]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	phy1729	[18:05:38] seems the bot died [18:05:38]

2016-09-18 10:52:07	larryv	it's easy to write something fragile. for instance, your find has to support -print0
2016-09-18 10:52:26	larryv	i'd only do that if i really had a lot of stuff to do for each result. maybe you do, i don't know
2016-09-18 10:53:39	larryv	i would consider -exec first

2016-09-18 13:24:36	greybot	[20:28:26] Process Substitution: <(command) or >(command) is replaced by a FIFO or /dev/fd/* entry. Basically shorthand for setting up a named pipe. See <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ProcessSubstitution>. Example: diff -u <(sort file1) <(sort file2) [20:28:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	llua	[20:28:42] or that if the second < is what you were referring to [20:28:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	dodobrain	[20:31:40] yeah the first one is simply setting up the input to the loop [20:31:40]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	dodobrain	[20:31:58] didn;t know about <() , thanks [20:31:58]

2016-09-18 13:24:36	dirty_pages_joe	[20:34:49] whats the difference w/ a pipe? like: sort file2 | sort file1 | diff [20:34:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	geirha	[20:35:27] sort file2 | sort file1 | diff   is gibberish. It doesn't do anything like diff -u <(sort file1) <(sort file2) [20:35:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	larryv	[20:35:33] some commands don't read stdin [20:35:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	larryv	[20:35:35] …like diff [20:35:35]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	grawity	[20:35:42] diff can read stdin, but there's *only one* stdin [20:35:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	dodobrain	[20:35:46] sort file1 | sort file2   is ... what the heck is that? [20:35:46]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	dodobrain	[20:35:56] you cannot do that without the process subs there [20:35:56]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	dodobrain	[20:36:16] diff -u <(sort file1) <(sort file2)    works beautifully [20:36:16]

2016-09-18 13:24:36	geirha	[20:39:18] see, diff gets two filenames, and when it reads from those files, it gets the output of those commands [20:39:18]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	dirty_pages_joe	[20:40:35] uh... now its clear [20:40:35]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	dodobrain	[20:44:23] would i also be able to save the output of find, then output the number of matches and then process each match in a loop? [20:44:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	dodobrain	[20:45:34] essentially i want to output: 37 dirs found. processing [blahblah]... processing [foo]... ... Completed processing [20:45:34]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	larryv	[20:47:12] you shouldn't really use the output of find [20:47:12]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	dodobrain	[20:48:01] eh? even when processing the results of find in a while loop? [20:48:01]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	larryv	[20:52:07] it's easy to write something fragile. for instance, your find has to support -print0 [20:52:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	larryv	[20:52:26] i'd only do that if i really had a lot of stuff to do for each result. maybe you do, i don't know [20:52:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	larryv	[20:53:39] i would consider -exec first [20:53:39]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	sushemsu	[22:22:44] why does (when values are hex) ; for i in ${b[@]}; do echo -n ${b} | xxd -r; done ; ## produce a different result than ## xxd -r <<< ${b[@]}; ## or ## echo ${b[@]} | xxd -r; ## http://pastebin.com/26izbauN [22:22:44]

2016-09-18 13:24:36	SHANP	[23:15:56] Hi, why is it that /bin/yes | echo "hello" just prints "hello". I would have expected it to hang [23:15:56]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	hyphenated	[23:16:39] SHANP: because 'echo' doesn't care about reading any input [23:16:39]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	SHANP	[23:17:47] hyphenated: but wouldn't yes keep reading to the pipe [23:17:47]

2016-09-18 13:24:36	Riviera	[23:18:17] SHANP: Would that be a good design for a "yes" utility? [23:18:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	hyphenated	[23:18:58] SHANP: it might try, until the pipe is closed, eg: when echo exits [23:18:58]

2016-09-18 13:27:10	SHANP	Whenever the process exits, don't all the file descriptors get closed. From yes's perspective, there isn't anything stopping it from writing to stdout which is redirected to the write end of the pipe.
2016-09-18 13:27:36	SHANP	The read side gets closed when echo exits correct?

2016-09-18 13:28:23	Riviera	SHANP: Even if that were correct, would that not be a silly design, for both yes and pipelines in general?
2016-09-18 13:29:47	Riviera	SHANP: You chose "echo" as an example, but would what you say not apply to the great majority of "yes" use cases?  Most of the times it is not intended to have a writing command that never stops running.
2016-09-18 13:30:05	SHANP	Perhaps in this example, but it means that the pipeline should close when the first process exits. If I have a program that only writes a little bit but then sends data across the network for a little while should it get killed early?
2016-09-18 13:30:40	Riviera	SHANP: Yup, that depends.  And in this particular case the choice was made that yes should exit.
2016-09-18 13:30:51	Riviera	SHANP: And the operating system provides a means for that, the PIPE signal.

2016-09-18 22:43:18	twkm	learn how to use xargs.
2016-09-18 22:43:22	twkm	or curl.

2016-09-19 12:06:46	jayjo	Everything I now have is working kind of "how I want it". But I have an AWS s3 bucket that is updated from kissmetrics, an analytics firm. This is the structure: https://bpaste.net/show/724b20070219. It's mainly a index.csv file keeping track of what files are present and when they were updated. tail of the index.csv file looks like this: https://bpaste.net/show/e65ece16f8e8. I originally had this in python do
2016-09-19 12:06:47	twkm	and long options confuse everything.  (posix long options, which you generally never even see mentioned)
2016-09-19 12:06:52	jayjo	ing a lot more processing, etc. but it was slow... using bash and mongoimport is exponentially faster bc mongoimport is written in GO I believe. Can I parse this file in bash and keep track of what files have been written and when they have been written just by writing to the filesystem, or is that considered bad practice and I should keep to my slow python solution?

2016-09-19 17:48:53	beantaxi	I'm seeing an answer on SO, which begins a script with OLDIFS=$IFS and ends with IFS=$OLDIFS. I am thinking it would be better with OLDIFS="$IFS" and then trap 'IFS="$OLDIFS"; exit 255' SIGINT SIGTERM instead of assuming the script fully executes (esp since the body of the script consumes a large CSV file).

2016-09-20 00:39:06	lopid	[07:59:43] 61 is…? [07:59:43]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	Carmageddon	[08:00:01] I have no idea, is sed counting from the beginning of sed expression, or the whole bash line? [08:00:01]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	lopid	[08:00:05] you've escaped them in the replacement, haven't you? [08:00:05]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	Carmageddon	[08:00:29] what do you mean? whom am I supposed to escape in replacement? [08:00:29]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	lopid	[08:00:29] you don't need to escape /'s [08:00:29]

2016-09-20 00:39:06	lopid	[08:01:16] it looks like it [08:01:16]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	Carmageddon	[08:01:24] why? I am using # as delimiter [08:01:24]

2016-09-20 04:21:18	jayjo	I have a bunch of json files that I'm still trying to upload. I have bad characters like \342\200\231 that I need to convert to ' ... the mime type of the file is text/plain; charset=us-ascii
2016-09-20 04:21:37	vktec	russ_: Try with either --noprofile or --norc, then you'll be able to rule out some of the files
2016-09-20 04:21:38	russ_	vktec: yep... that works

2016-09-20 04:23:21	russ_	??? both --nobash and --norc fix it.  Weird.
2016-09-20 04:23:27	russ_	One must be sourcing the other??
2016-09-20 04:23:32	russ_	ok.. back to digging
