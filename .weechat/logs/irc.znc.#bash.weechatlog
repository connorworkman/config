2016-09-16 04:39:59	F1act	just after the bash script is complete
2016-09-16 04:40:30	larryv	after the bash script that sources the ~/dev_env file finishes?

2016-09-16 04:40:38	F1act	yes
2016-09-16 04:40:43	greycat	If you type "source /foo" in an interactive shell, and "/foo" contains "export FOO=bar" and nothing else, and then you run "env | grep FOO", you should see it.
2016-09-16 04:41:04	greycat	One of these assumptions must be false.
2016-09-16 04:41:08	larryv	the bash script cannot modify the environment of the parent
2016-09-16 04:41:13	greycat	At this point my money is on "and nothing else".
2016-09-16 04:41:29	greycat	If you use source, you're not running a script.  You're sourcing a file.
2016-09-16 04:42:01	F1act	Then how I can changing it using a bash_script?
2016-09-16 04:42:13	F1act	Would python work?
2016-09-16 04:42:26	F1act	btw.. I'm new to bash scripting.
2016-09-16 04:42:28	larryv	i'm guessing (since it was never explicitly stated) that F1act has a script "foo" that sources "dev_env", and is running "./foo; env" or "bash foo; env" or whatever
2016-09-16 04:42:40	greycat	You CANNOT change an interactive shell's variables using ANY kind of child process, whether that be a bash script, a python script, or whatever.
2016-09-16 04:42:43	greycat	You must use source.
2016-09-16 04:42:58	F1act	Ok, thanks for clearing that up.
2016-09-16 04:43:02	greycat	F1act: What *exactly* are you typing in your interactive shell?

2016-09-16 17:10:09	pasteban	Paste is available without javascript on http://hastebin.com/raw/meboyobixo
2016-09-16 17:10:39	stacks88	when i put that in file.txt and do cat file.txt | jq '.' like i would w/ usual json output, i instead get parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 18 so i guess i wont be able to use jq for this

2016-09-16 20:39:09	sjohnson	i think it can be done that way but i'm not positive.
2016-09-16 20:39:14	sjohnson	"visudo"
2016-09-16 20:39:24	sjohnson	might fire up nano and not vi, depending on your computer.
2016-09-16 20:39:53	yitz	It will fire up $EDITOR or vi

2016-09-16 20:47:45	sjohnson	i sometimes do it.
2016-09-16 20:47:55	sjohnson	uuos maybe.
2016-09-16 20:48:00	yitz	Sometimes mindless?
2016-09-16 20:48:22	sjohnson	i don't make that mistake as much when i colour-code my prompt when i'm su'd in to remind me.
2016-09-16 20:49:32	tom99	I just have a terminal window open with root access at all times.
2016-09-16 20:49:36	tom99	makes things like apt-get much easier
2016-09-16 20:50:39	sjohnson	yitz: looks like the root being in sudoers is to explicitly allow root to run commands as other users.
2016-09-16 20:50:50	sjohnson	maybe the thing i mentioned above too, but i haven't tested it.
2016-09-16 20:51:09	Celmor	so... anyone got tips how I could get my sudoers rules behave like one would expect?

2016-09-16 21:07:16	sjohnson	instead of copying all of that bullshit over to root's .bash_aliases or .bashrc, etc.

All other variable names should be lowercase. Since variable names are case-sensitive, this convention avoids accidentally overriding environmental and internal variables.

It deploys php-fpm+CMS jails on freeBSD. i pass variables to the script such as domains, tlds, subdomains, ip, etc. i wish to make the script read in a file that has the config information in it, that way if i ever need to reinstall i can simply foreach through each conf file for each website and a lot of the hard work is done. How might i accomplish this best and how do i pass variables between them?

2016-09-18 09:13:50	iamawesome	[16:36:05] I'm in tht 3rd tab of gnome-terminal. I want to see the history of 2nd terminal. [16:36:05]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	pragma-	[16:36:19] shibly returns. [16:36:19]

2016-09-18 09:13:50	greybot	[16:36:46] iamawesome: Not a #bash question. We're no experts in that software or OS; consider asking the channel or mailing list with experts on that topic (eg. ##linux #openssh #ubuntu #zsh). [16:36:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	Mohan	[16:37:18] you can setup bash to update history immediately [16:37:18]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	llua	[16:37:19] sounds like a bash question [16:37:19]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	Mohan	[16:38:27] http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/088 [16:38:27]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	Mohan	[16:40:05] iamawesome, checkout that link.. its not ideal but gives you an option. [16:40:05]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	Mohan	[16:43:38] dfib, http://blog.hellosa.org/2013/07/27/log-bash-history-to-syslog-on-centos-6.html it seems you can log all bash commands to syslog via a recompiled bash. [16:43:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	lopid	[16:44:54] or you could use logger [16:44:54]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	Mohan	[16:45:36] like a wrapper around bash ? [16:45:36]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	lopid	[16:46:23] in PROMPT_COMMAND, for example [16:46:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	dfib	[16:46:27] Mohan i love you [16:46:27]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	Mohan	[16:47:32] lopid, Just noticed it. thanks. [16:47:32]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	llua	[17:03:12] that syslog option is pretty dumb, since a user can disable history and bash will stop forwarding stuff to syslog [17:03:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	lopid	[17:03:44] yes [17:03:44]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	llua	[17:09:01] dfib: anything you do at the shell level can be circumvented pretty easily [17:09:01]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	dfib	[17:14:00] But I should atleast know when its circumvented. Because the command to disable it will be tracked before it's run right? and i could set up a tripwire on bash{rc,_profile} to tell when it was modified [17:14:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	dfib	[17:14:50] It's meant for basically tracking tech support that is working on the servers. I dont expect a high level of espionage, and it's also good for if "mysql crashed, who did it" [17:14:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	grawity	[17:15:14] better enable tty logging in sudo [17:15:14]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	dfib	[17:15:25] For use-case, I think it would work. I'm tottally down for better options if you guys have any however [17:15:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	lopid	[17:17:29] process accounting would be a "better" option [17:17:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	dfib	[17:18:01] Additional* ? [17:18:01]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	lopid	[17:18:20] could be [17:18:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	lopid	[17:18:51] you could at least question why someone in the team disabled bash logging [17:18:51]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	llua	[17:19:40] don't have to disable to avoid it either [17:19:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	llua	[17:19:59] just one of the many ways to escape the playpen [17:19:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	dfib	[17:22:31] I just find it hard to believe this isn't a more common requirement for environments. track wtf is going on. know of any better playpens llua? [17:22:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	llua	[17:22:57] dfib: i don't remember if the shopt to disable history is sent before logging is disabled, pretty sure it isn't [17:22:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	dfib	[17:22:59] I'd still rather have this as opposed to nothing. [17:22:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	llua	[17:23:17] you can do that interactively without changing a .bashrc [17:23:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	lopid	[17:23:47] if mysql crashed, it's probably mysql's fault :) [17:23:47]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	dfib	[17:23:52] But with the modified bash, it should track that before it's executed. [17:23:52]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	llua	[17:24:53] i habatually disable history in shells when working on client machines, if its the first command a person does, you have nothing in the history. or the stuff they don't mind someone seeing [17:24:53]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	storge	[17:27:59] llua: hwo do you do that [17:27:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	phy1729	[17:33:50] auditd can track every exec [17:33:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	llua	[17:48:41] storge: depends on the shell, but bash is just set +o history [17:48:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	no_gravity	[18:02:24] "ls somedir" shows me 26 files. but "ls somedir | wc" tells me it's 27. Any ideas why? [18:02:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	no_gravity	[18:02:42] Ah, it outputs a total. [18:02:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	phy1729	[18:04:32] # touch $'\n\n\n\n\n\n'; ls | wc [18:04:32]

2016-09-18 09:13:50	no_gravity	[18:05:36] Man, I was hoping for a fancy bash bot. [18:05:36]
2016-09-18 09:13:50	phy1729	[18:05:38] seems the bot died [18:05:38]

2016-09-18 10:52:07	larryv	it's easy to write something fragile. for instance, your find has to support -print0
2016-09-18 10:52:26	larryv	i'd only do that if i really had a lot of stuff to do for each result. maybe you do, i don't know
2016-09-18 10:53:39	larryv	i would consider -exec first

2016-09-18 13:24:36	greybot	[20:28:26] Process Substitution: <(command) or >(command) is replaced by a FIFO or /dev/fd/* entry. Basically shorthand for setting up a named pipe. See <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ProcessSubstitution>. Example: diff -u <(sort file1) <(sort file2) [20:28:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	llua	[20:28:42] or that if the second < is what you were referring to [20:28:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	dodobrain	[20:31:40] yeah the first one is simply setting up the input to the loop [20:31:40]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	dodobrain	[20:31:58] didn;t know about <() , thanks [20:31:58]

2016-09-18 13:24:36	dirty_pages_joe	[20:34:49] whats the difference w/ a pipe? like: sort file2 | sort file1 | diff [20:34:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	geirha	[20:35:27] sort file2 | sort file1 | diff   is gibberish. It doesn't do anything like diff -u <(sort file1) <(sort file2) [20:35:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	larryv	[20:35:33] some commands don't read stdin [20:35:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	larryv	[20:35:35] …like diff [20:35:35]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	grawity	[20:35:42] diff can read stdin, but there's *only one* stdin [20:35:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	dodobrain	[20:35:46] sort file1 | sort file2   is ... what the heck is that? [20:35:46]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	dodobrain	[20:35:56] you cannot do that without the process subs there [20:35:56]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	dodobrain	[20:36:16] diff -u <(sort file1) <(sort file2)    works beautifully [20:36:16]

2016-09-18 13:24:36	geirha	[20:39:18] see, diff gets two filenames, and when it reads from those files, it gets the output of those commands [20:39:18]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	dirty_pages_joe	[20:40:35] uh... now its clear [20:40:35]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	dodobrain	[20:44:23] would i also be able to save the output of find, then output the number of matches and then process each match in a loop? [20:44:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	dodobrain	[20:45:34] essentially i want to output: 37 dirs found. processing [blahblah]... processing [foo]... ... Completed processing [20:45:34]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	larryv	[20:47:12] you shouldn't really use the output of find [20:47:12]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	dodobrain	[20:48:01] eh? even when processing the results of find in a while loop? [20:48:01]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	larryv	[20:52:07] it's easy to write something fragile. for instance, your find has to support -print0 [20:52:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	larryv	[20:52:26] i'd only do that if i really had a lot of stuff to do for each result. maybe you do, i don't know [20:52:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	larryv	[20:53:39] i would consider -exec first [20:53:39]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	sushemsu	[22:22:44] why does (when values are hex) ; for i in ${b[@]}; do echo -n ${b} | xxd -r; done ; ## produce a different result than ## xxd -r <<< ${b[@]}; ## or ## echo ${b[@]} | xxd -r; ## http://pastebin.com/26izbauN [22:22:44]

2016-09-18 13:24:36	SHANP	[23:15:56] Hi, why is it that /bin/yes | echo "hello" just prints "hello". I would have expected it to hang [23:15:56]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	hyphenated	[23:16:39] SHANP: because 'echo' doesn't care about reading any input [23:16:39]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	SHANP	[23:17:47] hyphenated: but wouldn't yes keep reading to the pipe [23:17:47]

2016-09-18 13:24:36	Riviera	[23:18:17] SHANP: Would that be a good design for a "yes" utility? [23:18:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:36	hyphenated	[23:18:58] SHANP: it might try, until the pipe is closed, eg: when echo exits [23:18:58]

2016-09-18 13:27:10	SHANP	Whenever the process exits, don't all the file descriptors get closed. From yes's perspective, there isn't anything stopping it from writing to stdout which is redirected to the write end of the pipe.
2016-09-18 13:27:36	SHANP	The read side gets closed when echo exits correct?

2016-09-18 13:28:23	Riviera	SHANP: Even if that were correct, would that not be a silly design, for both yes and pipelines in general?
2016-09-18 13:29:47	Riviera	SHANP: You chose "echo" as an example, but would what you say not apply to the great majority of "yes" use cases?  Most of the times it is not intended to have a writing command that never stops running.
2016-09-18 13:30:05	SHANP	Perhaps in this example, but it means that the pipeline should close when the first process exits. If I have a program that only writes a little bit but then sends data across the network for a little while should it get killed early?
2016-09-18 13:30:40	Riviera	SHANP: Yup, that depends.  And in this particular case the choice was made that yes should exit.
2016-09-18 13:30:51	Riviera	SHANP: And the operating system provides a means for that, the PIPE signal.

2016-09-18 22:43:18	twkm	learn how to use xargs.
2016-09-18 22:43:22	twkm	or curl.

2016-09-19 12:06:46	jayjo	Everything I now have is working kind of "how I want it". But I have an AWS s3 bucket that is updated from kissmetrics, an analytics firm. This is the structure: https://bpaste.net/show/724b20070219. It's mainly a index.csv file keeping track of what files are present and when they were updated. tail of the index.csv file looks like this: https://bpaste.net/show/e65ece16f8e8. I originally had this in python do
2016-09-19 12:06:47	twkm	and long options confuse everything.  (posix long options, which you generally never even see mentioned)
2016-09-19 12:06:52	jayjo	ing a lot more processing, etc. but it was slow... using bash and mongoimport is exponentially faster bc mongoimport is written in GO I believe. Can I parse this file in bash and keep track of what files have been written and when they have been written just by writing to the filesystem, or is that considered bad practice and I should keep to my slow python solution?

2016-09-19 17:48:53	beantaxi	I'm seeing an answer on SO, which begins a script with OLDIFS=$IFS and ends with IFS=$OLDIFS. I am thinking it would be better with OLDIFS="$IFS" and then trap 'IFS="$OLDIFS"; exit 255' SIGINT SIGTERM instead of assuming the script fully executes (esp since the body of the script consumes a large CSV file).

2016-09-20 00:39:06	lopid	[07:59:43] 61 is…? [07:59:43]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	Carmageddon	[08:00:01] I have no idea, is sed counting from the beginning of sed expression, or the whole bash line? [08:00:01]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	lopid	[08:00:05] you've escaped them in the replacement, haven't you? [08:00:05]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	Carmageddon	[08:00:29] what do you mean? whom am I supposed to escape in replacement? [08:00:29]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	lopid	[08:00:29] you don't need to escape /'s [08:00:29]

2016-09-20 00:39:06	lopid	[08:01:16] it looks like it [08:01:16]
2016-09-20 00:39:06	Carmageddon	[08:01:24] why? I am using # as delimiter [08:01:24]

2016-09-20 04:51:02	brendyn	russ_: I think that is generally bad practice. You should put things in .bash_profile when they don't need to be in .bashrc, and not source .bashrc. .bash_profile is loading only when a login shell is started, but .bashrc is executed everytime `bash' is run, so if you set some environment variables and then start an inferior terminal, .bashrc can bork those changes

2016-09-20 05:02:43	brendyn	russ_: ;) If you move any cases of VAR=foo in and function bar() {...} .bash_profile, you will want to change them to export VAR=foo and function bar() {...}; export -f bar so that they are actually visible to sub processes of your login shell (i.e., everything). I think probably people dump things in .bashrc without realising they can do that.

2016-09-20 05:05:30	russ_	brendyn: yes, I have always found the .bash_profile and .bashrc distinction somewhat confusing.

2016-09-20 06:31:16	larryv	well "sh" is usually some other shell emulating Bourne or trying to stick to POSIX, so it probably won't be 100% faithful either
2016-09-20 06:31:26	russ_	I guess the most portable way to make escapes strings is going to be with printf, then?

2016-09-20 17:39:25	tom99	it still doesn't tell me what other tools in the *nix toolset I should know to know my way around my linux system.
2016-09-20 17:40:02	tom99	I just rely on python unless it's not available. i'm not sure i even remember how to use bath to do calculations
2016-09-20 17:40:39	han-solo	python is simple
2016-09-20 17:40:59	han-solo	and python3* is better

2016-09-20 17:43:33	han-solo	yeah
2016-09-20 17:43:39	subvhome_	http://paste.ubuntu.com/23209914/ my results.. still get an error
2016-09-20 17:44:30	subvhome_	forgot a semi colon on then echo line.. placed it same results
2016-09-20 17:44:39	dreisner	subvhome_: the syntax is [[ $(awk ...) ]]
2016-09-20 17:44:54	dreisner	not  [[$(awk ...)]]
2016-09-20 17:45:06	yitz	subvhome_: [[ is a command/word that needs space after it
2016-09-20 17:45:15	subvhome_	oh i see.. spaces matter there..
2016-09-20 17:45:29	yitz	subvhome_: But there's far better approaches that parsing the output of awk
2016-09-20 17:45:36	yitz	Like, have awk use an exit status
2016-09-20 17:45:40	han-solo	![[
2016-09-20 17:45:40	greybot	[[ is a bash keyword similar to (but more powerful than) the [ command. See <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/031> and <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/TestsAndConditionals>. Unless you're writing for POSIX sh, we recommend [[.
2016-09-20 17:45:46	tom99	oh so if i invoke awk or sed there is gonna be no change but if i invoke python it could be version 2 or 3?
2016-09-20 17:46:08	subvhome_	guys thanks.. i thought it was just for easy reading.. i will take a look at that wiki.. thanks a bunch
2016-09-20 17:46:08	yitz	tom99: There's awk, sed, python2 and python3. Four distinct tools
2016-09-20 17:46:51	tom99	Now I remember why I have wheezy, it's because it has python 2.7
2016-09-20 17:47:08	yitz	subvhome_: if ! awk '$5 > 50 {print "Results"; exit 1}' file; then : ; fi

2016-09-20 18:53:16	han-solo	[03:40:59] and python3* is better [03:40:59]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	yitz	[03:41:17] Moving away from the language wars and back to the channel topic... [03:41:17]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	yitz	[03:41:27] tom99: a=$((a + b * c)) [03:41:27]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	dreisner	[03:43:22] han-solo: given PEP 394, python might already be python3 [03:43:22]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	han-solo	[03:43:33] yeah [03:43:33]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	subvhome_	[03:43:39] http://paste.ubuntu.com/23209914/ my results.. still get an error [03:43:39]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	subvhome_	[03:44:30] forgot a semi colon on then echo line.. placed it same results [03:44:30]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	dreisner	[03:44:39] subvhome_: the syntax is [[ $(awk ...) ]] [03:44:39]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	dreisner	[03:44:54] not  [[$(awk ...)]] [03:44:54]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	yitz	[03:45:06] subvhome_: [[ is a command/word that needs space after it [03:45:06]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	subvhome_	[03:45:15] oh i see.. spaces matter there.. [03:45:15]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	yitz	[03:45:29] subvhome_: But there's far better approaches that parsing the output of awk [03:45:29]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	yitz	[03:45:36] Like, have awk use an exit status [03:45:36]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	han-solo	[03:45:40] ![[ [03:45:40]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	greybot	[03:45:40] [[ is a bash keyword similar to (but more powerful than) the [ command. See <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/031> and <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/TestsAndConditionals>. Unless you're writing for POSIX sh, we recommend [[. [03:45:40]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	tom99	[03:45:46] oh so if i invoke awk or sed there is gonna be no change but if i invoke python it could be version 2 or 3? [03:45:46]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	subvhome_	[03:46:08] guys thanks.. i thought it was just for easy reading.. i will take a look at that wiki.. thanks a bunch [03:46:08]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	yitz	[03:46:08] tom99: There's awk, sed, python2 and python3. Four distinct tools [03:46:08]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	tom99	[03:46:51] Now I remember why I have wheezy, it's because it has python 2.7 [03:46:51]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	yitz	[03:47:08] subvhome_: if ! awk '$5 > 50 {print "Results"; exit 1}' file; then : ; fi [03:47:08]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	larryv	[03:47:12] eh there are different awks and seds [03:47:12]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	yitz	[03:48:11] larryv: There's different versions and extensions but they all support the same POSIX language [03:48:11]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	dreisner	[03:48:27] except for mawk [03:48:27]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	dreisner	[03:48:34] mawk doesn't give a shit. [03:48:34]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	larryv	[03:48:55] yitz: i know, i just don't want tom99 to think they're uniform [03:48:55]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	llua	[03:50:31] mawk or the ancient version of mawk that debian ships? [03:50:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	yitz	[04:10:38] Quashie, dreisner. dreisner, Quashie. You two may have worked together in the last month or two. [04:10:38]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	Quashie	[04:10:53] Hey [04:10:53]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	 *	yitz [04:13:04] wanders off to read the SRE book [04:13:04]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	tom99	[04:41:53] lol [04:41:53]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	tom99	[04:42:07] someone linked me a thread of somebody begging the debian maintainer to update mawk to 1.3.4 [04:42:07]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	tom99	[04:42:13] and it was a long list of excuses why it won't happe [04:42:13]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	tom99	[04:42:15] *happen [04:42:15]
2016-09-20 18:53:16	tom99	[04:42:55] I arbitrarily chose debian to learn on though so <shrug> [04:42:55]

2016-09-21 05:15:19	greybot	The backquote (`) is used in the old-style command substitution, e.g. foo=`command`. The foo=$(command) syntax is recommended instead. Backslash handling inside $() is less surprising, and $() is easier to nest. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/082

2016-09-21 10:38:58	greycat	Yes, you can store counts in an associative array (bash or awk).  No, that wasn't readily possible before bash 4.  Yes, it may be more efficient that way (sorting is O(n log n), counting is O(n)).  Yes, counting & storing takes more memory.  Yes, it's cheating to ignore how much memory the sort takes.
2016-09-21 10:39:06	greycat	Yes, it's faster TO WRITE sort |uniq -c and be done.

2016-09-21 11:40:11	Waldo	I need it to be the ONLY argument ran, because if -h comes after it, the -l still executes, but the -h does not
2016-09-21 11:40:25	Waldo	Id like -l to be the only argument detected, or throw an error and exit 0

2016-09-21 12:41:36	alxlu	[22:10:55] I'm trying to run a bash function i have in my .bashrc using the custom keyboard shortcuts (on ubuntu 16.04). It works when I type it into a shell, but it doesn't do anything as a shortcut. I have the Command set to gnome-terminal -e "/bin/bash -c mycommand". Do I need to somehow source .bashrc? [22:10:55]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	larryv	[22:18:35] alxlu: .bashrc is not automatically sourced for non-interactive, non-login shells https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Bash-Startup-Files [22:18:35]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	alxlu	[22:23:02] thanks larryv. I tried adding a "source ~/.bashrc &&" to the command, but it seems to do nothing. I aslo added a "& sleep 3s" after to see the output. It looks like without the source ~/.bashrc, it says it can't find the command, but with sourcing, the output is just empty. [22:23:02]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	larryv	[22:23:47] what does the function actually do [22:23:47]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	alxlu	[22:24:42] so I have this app called Synergy that lets me use my keyboard and mouse on my Ubuntu box on my MacBook Pro. Unfortunately, it's really buggy and needs to be restarted. So the function quits Synergy on both devices and relaunches it (using ssh -t to control the mac) [22:24:42]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	alxlu	[22:27:30] basically one of the commands is "synergy & ssh -t alxlu@rmbp \"nohub pint -i .2 workstation >/dev/null 2>&1 & open /Applications/Synergy.app && exit && bash\"". That one's an alias. Then I have a function that does ssh -t alxlu@rmbp "osascript -e 'quit app \"Synergy"' && kill -SIGINT \`pgrep ping\` && exit && bash"; pkill synergy (for some reason adding && pikill synergy didn't work there) [22:27:30]

2016-09-21 12:41:36	jetchisel	[22:32:50] like the other syntax i saw:  if (grep -q foo bar); then blah; fi  ##: dunno where did the subshell came from ^^ [22:32:50]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Asterfield	[22:33:08] I have a python script called 'docker-env' which I want to use in a shell script to help assemble a larger command [22:33:08]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Asterfield	[22:34:07] docker-env outputs this http://hastebin.com/iritifinib.bash [22:34:07]

2016-09-21 12:41:36	alxlu	[22:34:11] larryv: yeah, i guess I'll try that. is /opt generally the best place to store these? I've avoided creating custom bash scripts in the past [22:34:11]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Asterfield	[22:34:21] When I try to use the output of this inside another command like [22:34:21]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Asterfield	[22:34:45] docker run $(docker-env api) some_image [22:34:45]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	larryv	[22:34:59] alxlu: doesn't really matter. you could use /usr/local/bin or ~/bin or anything [22:34:59]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Asterfield	[22:35:07] bash seems to ignore the quotes and gives me an error [22:35:07]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	larryv	[22:35:18] your keyboard shortcut thing can just specify the absolute path [22:35:18]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:35:31] Asterfield: yup, it does; but it's your fault for assuming these quotes would have any meaning to the shell. [22:35:31]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	jetchisel	[22:35:45] ~/bin is the most common for a single user and /usr/local/bin for scripts created by sysadmins that should available for everyone else [22:35:45]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Asterfield	[22:36:19] Riviera: Ok, that's great. How should I approach solving this? I can't quote the whole subshell, since the subshell is supposed to echo several flags [22:36:19]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	alxlu	[22:36:26] ah ok, thanks larryv and jetchisel [22:36:26]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	jetchisel	[22:37:08] assuming /usr/local/bin is in everyones PATH ^^ [22:37:08]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:37:50] Asterfield: Make docker-env print each argument \0-terminated, its output into an array, and use the array expansion for the docker run command. [22:37:50]
2016-09-21 12:41:36	Riviera	[22:38:17] err, "read its outp..." [22:38:17]

2016-09-21 12:51:34	Riviera	Asterfield: That assumes you modified docker-env to print arguments \0 (ASCII nul) terminated, each argument \0-terminated, without any characters intended as shell quoting.
2016-09-21 12:51:45	Asterfield	Riviera: Oh interesting, you quote the array expansion even if you want the output to be treated like separate arguments?
2016-09-21 12:52:01	Riviera	Asterfield: Yup.
2016-09-21 12:52:12	Asterfield	Okay, I didn't know that

2016-09-21 12:53:01	Riviera	Asterfield: Quoting is counter-intuitive in the shell, but essential; if you plan to continue writing shell scripts you should ("must") take the time to learn it; the links above would help.

2016-09-21 19:07:00	k_sze[work]	[03:42:18] but that seems to work. :D [03:42:18]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	k_sze[work]	[03:42:19] thanks [03:42:19]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	izalove	[03:42:42] uh...  it should work with { } as well [03:42:42]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	k_sze[work]	[03:43:22] If I use { }, bash thinks my command is unfinished for some reason. [03:43:22]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	izalove	[03:43:31] what do you mean? [03:43:31]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	k_sze[work]	[03:43:39] This is bash 4.3.11 on Ubuntu 14.04 [03:43:39]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	izalove	[03:43:45] did you forget ; before } ? [03:43:45]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	k_sze[work]	[03:44:01] It gives me a new line and waits for me to type some more. [03:44:01]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	izalove	[03:44:28] yeah, copying code verbatim from irc is hard [03:44:28]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	Strykar	[03:44:39] I'm trying to alias find in bash_profile so it doesn't try and look in /proc and this works, but it appends /proc to the end of every search. how do I get rid of the last entry of /proc besides invoking sed?: alias find="find . / -path /proc -prune -o -noleaf -name" [03:44:39]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	k_sze[work]	[03:44:56] ah, ok. [03:44:56]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	k_sze[work]	[03:46:04] What's the difference between { } and ( )? [03:46:04]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	izalove	[03:46:24] nothing in that case [03:46:24]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	izalove	[03:46:43] ( ) creates a subshell, { } is just a group [03:46:43]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	izalove	[03:46:51] but you're already in a subshell so it doesn't matter [03:46:51]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	k_sze[work]	[03:47:18] I suppose group is very very slightly more efficient? [03:47:18]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	izalove	[03:47:30] in that case they're the same [03:47:30]
2016-09-21 19:07:00	izalove	[03:49:53] Strykar: maybe use find /!(proc) [03:49:53]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	Strykar	[03:57:29] izalove, find . /!(proc) -prune -o -noleaf -name [03:57:29]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	izalove	[03:57:47] what [03:57:47]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	izalove	[03:57:48] no [03:57:48]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	izalove	[03:57:52] remove -prune [03:57:52]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	Strykar	[03:58:00] izalove, find . /!(proc) -noleaf -name [03:58:00]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	izalove	[03:58:08] that looks ok [03:58:08]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	Strykar	[03:59:19] that doesn't appear to start looking in / [03:59:19]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	izalove	[03:59:52] # find . /!(proc) -noleaf -name bash [03:59:52]

2016-09-21 19:07:01	izalove	[04:01:02] do you use history expansion? [04:01:02]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	Strykar	[04:01:19] tab completion? [04:01:19]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	izalove	[04:01:30] no not that [04:01:30]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	izalove	[04:01:47] history expansion means things like !! !$ etc [04:01:47]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	Strykar	[04:01:58] not [04:01:58]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	Strykar	[04:01:59] no [04:01:59]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	izalove	[04:02:09] then disable it with set +H [04:02:09]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	Strykar	[04:02:39] just to get find working? :/ [04:02:39]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	izalove	[04:03:24] i don't know a way to use !() without disabling history expansion [04:03:24]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	izalove	[04:04:05] and !() is far more useful to me [04:04:05]

They should *always* be quoted. See: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/073 and "Parameter Expansion" in man bash. Also see http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/pe. [08:41:56]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	ormaaj	[08:41:59] there's nothing you can really do about that redundant element other than copy the values as a separate step [08:41:59]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	Kartagis	[08:49:16] hello [08:49:16]

2016-09-22 00:23:54	stevenm_	[08:50:24] ormaaj, that seems a tad overkill for my needs - how about something along these lines (can it be improved?) https://pastebin.com/raw/iBvjQfBX [08:50:24]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	Kartagis	[08:50:29] how can I do PE to fetch the part after prod/ ? [08:50:29]

2016-09-22 00:23:54	Kartagis	[08:51:37] echo $url | cut -d \/ -f 5 seems to do what I want, but I'd be interested in knowing the PE way [08:51:37]

2016-09-22 00:23:54	stevenm_	[08:58:35] ormaaj, the key thing though I have picked up from you is quoting the arrays you want read to put stuff into e.g.   'a[n]' [08:58:35]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	stevenm_	[08:58:41] i was having difficulty working that bit out [08:58:41]

2016-09-22 00:23:54	izalove	[09:25:04] what does ${#__[@]} expand to? [09:25:04]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	ormaaj	[09:26:13] depends on context [09:26:13]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	ormaaj	[09:26:22] either itself or the parent of the current element [09:26:22]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	ormaaj	[09:26:31] works in my version [09:26:31]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	izalove	[09:27:35] __     When following a variable name and .  this expands to the parent of variable when vari‐ [09:27:35]

2016-09-22 00:23:54	izalove	[09:27:39]        expands to variable. [09:27:39]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	izalove	[09:27:41] this is all the documentation in man ksh [09:27:41]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	ormaaj	[09:27:53] # ksh -c 'typeset -a a; printf "%s %s %s\n" {0..8} | { while IFS=" " read -rA "a[${#a[@]}].."; do :; done; unset -v "a[-1]"; typeset -p a; }' [09:27:53]

2016-09-22 00:23:54	ormaaj	[09:29:27] the man page is somewhat incomplete on the meaning of these. there's a bit more info in TYPES (in the source) but even that is incomplete [09:29:27]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	ormaaj	[09:34:46] i had to run a zillion tests to sort of figure it out. any of __, _., ., .sh.{name,value,subscript} have some self-referential function that differs depending on the context [09:34:46]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	izalove	[09:39:01] that sounds like a very productive use of your time [09:39:01]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	izalove	[09:40:18] isn't this similar to one of the reasons in those anti-csh essays? [09:40:18]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	izalove	[09:40:30] csh had a custom parser that behaved in unexpected ways [09:40:30]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	ormaaj	[09:42:00] it could have been if it wasn't so strange. The interesting part is when you combine it builtins that use the nval library which just automatically exposes types in C in either direction [09:42:00]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	ormaaj	[09:44:02] i don't remember.. the weirdness isn't the parser, mostly. [09:44:02]

2016-09-22 02:00:40	apus	the error goes to stdin but i don't know how to catch it beforehand ?!
2016-09-22 02:00:58	apus	just try if ssh -oBatchMode=yes "$ssh_ip" "$(printf 'sudo /sbin/zfs list -Hr -t filesystem,volume -o name -s name %q\n' "$backup_dataset")"; then ... beforehand?

2016-09-22 02:02:10	geirha	why does that mean you have to run the command twice?
2016-09-22 02:02:30	geirha	oh, I missed the while ... < <(ssh...)
2016-09-22 02:02:50	geirha	in bash 4.4, you can check the exit status of the process substitution
2016-09-22 02:03:15	geirha	in earlier versions, you can use a named pipe
2016-09-22 02:03:19	apus	just how can i integrate that into the while loop? or better: "where" can i check that?
2016-09-22 02:03:20	geirha	coproc (maybe)
2016-09-22 02:03:38	apus	or is $? available after the while loop?

2016-09-22 02:04:07	geirha	if you have bash 4.4,  $!  will expand to the pid of the process substitution, so you can wait for it to retrieve its exit status
2016-09-22 02:04:24	geirha	another option could be lastpipe

2016-09-22 02:14:58	alyptik	braces are for when text next to it can be mistaken for part of the variable name like echo ${foo}cat"
2016-09-22 02:15:15	CustosLimen	kerframil, hmm
2016-09-22 02:15:16	alyptik	or when you need stuff like ${bar/x/y}
2016-09-22 02:15:37	CustosLimen	alyptik, that would be a case where its necesiary I guess
2016-09-22 02:15:53	CustosLimen	alyptik, I prefer to always put braces as that gives it a more consistent look

2016-09-22 06:29:32	soulisson	Hi, can I ask you a question, a command is an instruction typed by the user in the shell, is that correct?

2016-09-22 06:30:44	ormaaj	if it's a file that contains a collection of commands or something like that then depends again. i might encode them into an array, source the file, then eval the elements of the array

2016-09-22 06:31:07	sjohnson	you could stick wait / pause instructions in the source file too.

Use ed(1) or ex(1) instead: eg. ex -sc '%s/a/b/|wq' file

2016-09-23 05:40:42	biax	what does $@ in ./configure .....options..... $@ || return 1 ; actually do?
2016-09-23 05:40:49	greycat	It is a bug.
2016-09-23 05:40:53	greycat	"$@" should always be quoted.
2016-09-23 05:41:12	greycat	!$@
2016-09-23 05:41:12	greybot	The difference between $@ and $*: Without quotes (don't do this!), there is no difference. With double quotes, "$@" expands to each positional parameter as its own argument: "$1" "$2" ..., while "$*" expands to the single argument "$1c$2c...", where 'c' is the first character of IFS. You almost always want "$@" (QUOTED!). The same goes for arrays: "${array[@]}".

2016-09-23 05:41:25	biax	its in a function

2016-09-23 05:41:49	greybot	Jakey3: bash has a special form of quoting, $'string' in which backslash-character combinations are expanded. For example, IFS=$' \t\n' or echo $'It\'s embedded!' http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Quotes

2016-09-23 06:15:25	Vonor|Work	not all IPs have a name associated with them. so the resulting list should contain all the ips and for thus that have names the names (can be more than one) should be added

2016-09-23 07:13:17	apus	hi, i am unsure if this is bash related: sshd allows for a command="" option in front of the ssh pubkey in authorized_keys. using command="cd dir && rbash" should more or less chroot the user to that directory. using command="/usr/lib64/misc/sftp-server" should limit the usability to sftp. now i need to do both. man sftp-server gives me:
2016-09-23 07:13:30	apus	-d start_directory             specifies an alternate starting directory for users.  The pathname may contain the following tokens that are expanded at runtime: % is replaced by a literal '%', %d is replaced by the home directory
2016-09-23 07:13:31	apus	             of the user being authenticated, and %u is replaced by the username of that user.  The default is to use the user's home directory.  This option is useful in conjunction with the sshd_config(5)
2016-09-23 07:13:33	apus	             ChrootDirectory option.

2016-09-23 10:43:29	kojiro	I'm trying to come up with a way to sanity check the shell. A file with function definitions will be sourced. If the shell that sources that file isn't "sane" according to my definition, it should abort sourcing the file. A "sane" shell is one where standard posix commands like set/unset/declare are builtins and not functions.

2016-09-23 12:21:02	husel	[21:45:44] As far as I understand, the single quotes should prevent this expansion? [21:45:44]

2016-09-23 12:21:02	acresearch	[21:56:50] izalove: i have a question, i am running the loop as you reccomended: for f in inputlist_*; do printf -v num %05d "$((i++))"; mv "$f" "inputlist_$num.split"; done but there is an issue, everytime i run it the sequence continues, it does not start from the begining, (1,2,3,4) then when i delete the files and rename them again (5,6,7,8) etc... how do i prevent that? [21:56:50]
2016-09-23 12:21:02	koala_man	[21:58:03] you can use i=0; to reset the sequence whenever you want [21:58:03]

You can put ''set -x'' just before the code you want to debug (turn off with ''set +x''). To add more information, change PS4 first: eg. PS4='+($?) $BASH_SOURCE:$FUNCNAME:$LINENO:'
