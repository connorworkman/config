2016-10-14 15:10:34	minimalism	Gentoo almost killed me last night
2016-10-14 15:10:34		[15:10]
2016-10-14 15:19:21	alyptik	what happened
2016-10-14 15:19:55	minimalism	It can break your spirit when you set a wrong USE flag somewhere among a hundred packages
2016-10-14 15:20:05	minimalism	and something doesn't work, which can cause other things to malfunction
2016-10-14 15:20:18	alyptik	yeah i still don't 100% understand USE flags
2016-10-14 15:20:28	minimalism	I was honestly decided in my mind I'd try Alpine as a desktop, or go back to Arch, and maybe make additional modifications in arch to compensate for the loss of gentoo's flexibility
2016-10-14 15:20:38	minimalism	I'll say this
2016-10-14 15:20:44	minimalism	be extremely careful about setting X as a global
2016-10-14 15:20:46	minimalism	in make.conf
2016-10-14 15:20:54	alyptik	shit i did exactly that lol
2016-10-14 15:20:55	alyptik	what broke
2016-10-14 15:20:57	minimalism	if you do, make sure to check all packages
2016-10-14 15:20:59	minimalism	that do use X
2016-10-14 15:21:03	minimalism	as a USE flag
2016-10-14 15:21:07	minimalism	conky
2016-10-14 15:21:09	alyptik	and why?
2016-10-14 15:21:20	minimalism	I assumed X USE flag would be fine since it has a cli output option
2016-10-14 15:21:31	minimalism	and then it just wouldn't use the X functionality to render
2016-10-14 15:21:40	minimalism	but it did, and it was casting a shadow of itself in text output on the monitor
2016-10-14 15:21:43	minimalism	in multiple dimensions
2016-10-14 15:21:47	alyptik	lol wtf
2016-10-14 15:21:56	minimalism	and then tmux..
2016-10-14 15:21:58	alyptik	thats insane
2016-10-14 15:22:04	minimalism	there was some version confusion there and malfunction with it and terminals
2016-10-14 15:22:23	minimalism	weechat took a little working as well because I took full advantage of its USE flags
2016-10-14 15:22:31	alyptik	well thanks for saving me a bunch of headache down the road heh
2016-10-14 15:22:36	minimalism	Gentoo will really make you think since you have to find out what each USE flag actually does
2016-10-14 15:22:45	minimalism	arch hides this from you, and you only know if you read the PKGBUILD
2016-10-14 15:23:02	alyptik	i should prob just put USE flags to default and only put in what i absolutely need
2016-10-14 15:23:11	minimalism	even then it may not work as desired
2016-10-14 15:23:27	minimalism	you really have to know what the USE flags are, and what they do
2016-10-14 15:23:41	minimalism	just don't install chromium or some huge thing while you experiment with USE flags and upgrade
2016-10-14 15:23:47	minimalism	or you can get stuck on upgrading for 2 hours
2016-10-14 15:24:02	alyptik	well i am not nuking my arch install for a while, so i have that as backup at least
2016-10-14 15:24:04	minimalism	secondly.. don't run commands to clean/remove unneeded deps
2016-10-14 15:24:11	minimalism	while running an upgrade in another window/term
2016-10-14 15:24:26	alyptik	hah yeah i did that by accident first install
2016-10-14 15:24:30	alyptik	didn't end well
2016-10-14 15:24:38	minimalism	I tried it once, but it was noticeable that it was wrong lol
2016-10-14 15:24:45	minimalism	it wanted to drag out way too much
2016-10-14 15:24:50	alyptik	lol
2016-10-14 15:24:54	minimalism	Mind testing something on arch if you're using it right now?
2016-10-14 15:24:57	alyptik	sure
2016-10-14 15:25:02	minimalism	what term do you use
2016-10-14 15:25:09	alyptik	urxvt and stjerm
2016-10-14 15:25:14	minimalism	open urxvt
2016-10-14 15:25:18	minimalism	on the command, type nothing
2016-10-14 15:25:25	minimalism	just the default when it opens
2016-10-14 15:25:29	alyptik	ok
2016-10-14 15:25:33	minimalism	now press tab
2016-10-14 15:25:37	minimalism	does it move forward or do nothing?
2016-10-14 15:25:37		[15:25]
2016-10-14 15:25:45	alyptik	forward
2016-10-14 15:25:50	minimalism	Really?
2016-10-14 15:25:53	alyptik	yep
2016-10-14 15:25:55	alyptik	i am using zsh though
2016-10-14 15:25:57	minimalism	Could've sworn it didn't do that on arch..
2016-10-14 15:25:59	minimalism	I am too
2016-10-14 15:25:59	alyptik	not sure if that's why
2016-10-14 15:26:04	minimalism	I just don't remember it doing that on arch
2016-10-14 15:26:08	minimalism	I remember it doing nothing
2016-10-14 15:26:11	minimalism	but on gentoo it's moving forward
2016-10-14 15:26:17	alyptik	are you trying to complete?
2016-10-14 15:26:24	minimalism	nah, just the blank command line
2016-10-14 15:26:29	minimalism	wondering what tab would do in that case
2016-10-14 15:26:35	alyptik	ah heh
2016-10-14 15:26:41	alyptik	stjerm same thing
2016-10-14 15:26:47	alyptik	also xterm
2016-10-14 15:26:59	minimalism	retroarch appears to work better here
2016-10-14 15:27:06	minimalism	using an overlay's packages
2016-10-14 15:27:23	minimalism	I think I may be missing a font or encoding somewhere though
2016-10-14 15:27:31	minimalism	because certain Japanese characters won't display in term
2016-10-14 15:27:35	alyptik	urxvt?
2016-10-14 15:27:35	minimalism	and a smaller number won't display in browser
2016-10-14 15:27:38	alyptik	oh
2016-10-14 15:27:39	minimalism	yeah
2016-10-14 15:27:44	alyptik	in browser too weird
2016-10-14 15:28:01	alyptik	what is your system font?
2016-10-14 15:28:17	minimalism	I only have ohsnap, liberation, dejavu, and droid
2016-10-14 15:28:25	minimalism	droid used to handle all the japanese characters on fallback perfectly
2016-10-14 15:28:34	minimalism	ohsnap was what I used in term, and it fell back to something
2016-10-14 15:28:36	minimalism	I'm not sure what
2016-10-14 15:28:57	alyptik	dejavu renders it all perfect for me, not sure why yours is doing that
2016-10-14 15:34:00		[15:28]
2016-10-14 15:36:51	minimalism	ah well
2016-10-14 15:36:56	minimalism	I'll figure it out soon enough
2016-10-14 15:37:38	minimalism	Gentoo really is a pain to get working, but it really is a rewarding feeling
2016-10-14 15:37:51	minimalism	Especially since it's more about knowledge rather than fighting a broken system
2016-10-14 15:38:07	minimalism	It's not some bug or quirk, it's just lacking knowledge of how all the software is built and how it functions
2016-10-14 15:38:23	alyptik	very true
2016-10-14 15:38:34	minimalism	I kept a copy of /var/abs/
2016-10-14 15:38:42	minimalism	so I can take a look at what options they use to build packages on arch
2016-10-14 15:38:42	alyptik	i have learned a lot just from the installation
2016-10-14 15:39:05	minimalism	Do you use ncmpcpp?
2016-10-14 15:39:10	alyptik	yup
2016-10-14 15:39:15	minimalism	You might like this
2016-10-14 15:39:19	minimalism	but I fucking hated the clock display
2016-10-14 15:39:24	minimalism	because it doesn't let you customize the clock format
2016-10-14 15:39:33	minimalism	so you can just remove it on gentoo with a USE flag
2016-10-14 15:39:52	minimalism	 - - clock      : Enable clock screen
2016-10-14 15:39:54	minimalism	 - - curl       : Add support for client-side URL transfer library
2016-10-14 15:39:56	minimalism	 - - outputs    : Enable outputs screen
2016-10-14 15:39:58	minimalism	 - - taglib     : Enable tagging support with taglib
2016-10-14 15:40:00	minimalism	 + + unicode    : Add support for Unicode
2016-10-14 15:40:02	minimalism	 + + visualizer : Enable visualizer screen with sound wave/frequency spectrum modes
2016-10-14 15:40:04	minimalism	removed outputs too
2016-10-14 15:40:08	minimalism	and taglib since I just use picard now
2016-10-14 15:40:30	alyptik	hah i use all of those but clock and curl
2016-10-14 15:40:37	alyptik	nice to know about the - - clock though
2016-10-14 15:40:42	minimalism	I only have unicode and visualizer
2016-10-14 15:41:21	minimalism	I think I came up with an interesting solution to skype
2016-10-14 15:41:28	minimalism	as much as I hate it.. unfortunately have to use it
2016-10-14 15:41:38	minimalism	gentoo doesn't really want to play nice on letting me install the skype client so
2016-10-14 15:41:54	minimalism	I started using the in browser "Skype for Web" client, but I didn't want it existing in my sandboxed chromium browser
2016-10-14 15:42:07	minimalism	so now I'm thinking of aliasing surf to run that one single thing exclusively in another workspace
2016-10-14 15:42:20	minimalism	surf itself has nothing the skype site could leverage for monitoring
2016-10-14 15:42:42	alyptik	i don't think ive used skype since windows
2016-10-14 15:42:46	minimalism	I could run surf through privoxy too
2016-10-14 15:42:55	minimalism	I don't recommend skype at all.. but normals, you know
2016-10-14 15:42:55	alyptik	i guess it's easier for me since none of my friends use it
2016-10-14 15:42:59	alyptik	hah
2016-10-14 15:43:06	minimalism	I use toxic client for tox now
2016-10-14 15:43:21	minimalism	thinking about picking up using OTR with something too
2016-10-14 15:43:50	alyptik	OTR?
2016-10-14 15:44:00	minimalism	Off-the-Record messaging
2016-10-14 15:44:04	minimalism	it uses PGP
2016-10-14 15:44:08	minimalism	with existing chat protocols
2016-10-14 15:44:09	minimalism	even skype
2016-10-14 15:44:14	minimalism	mostly XMPP and such though
2016-10-14 15:44:27	minimalism	Snowden used it when he was communicating with a journalist to leak the NSA stuff and beyond
2016-10-14 15:44:28	alyptik	ah
2016-10-14 15:44:47	alyptik	only real messaging thing i use is irc
2016-10-14 15:45:03	minimalism	the whole world should be using tox
2016-10-14 15:45:08	minimalism	it's so much better than skype
2016-10-14 15:45:21	alyptik	i hear everyone talk about it
2016-10-14 15:45:26	alyptik	i should install just to see what it is
2016-10-14 15:45:35	minimalism	not many talk about it at all sadly
2016-10-14 15:45:45	minimalism	but it's an excellent protocol that lets you use whatever tox client you want
2016-10-14 15:45:50	minimalism	I use the ncurses one called toxic
2016-10-14 15:45:52	minimalism	since I can use it in tty
2016-10-14 15:45:56	minimalism	even make audio calls in tty
2016-10-14 15:45:59	minimalism	it's fucking amazing
2016-10-14 15:46:08	minimalism	it even has this sick anti-spam feature
2016-10-14 15:46:10	alyptik	woah that is cool
2016-10-14 15:46:14	alyptik	free?
2016-10-14 15:46:19	minimalism	of course
2016-10-14 15:46:26	minimalism	it's like P2P between the users using it
2016-10-14 15:46:35	alyptik	so like tor for messaging
2016-10-14 15:46:37	minimalism	group chat can have a delay for messages to be posted, but
2016-10-14 15:46:40	minimalism	basically yeah
2016-10-14 15:46:41	alyptik	nodes and such
2016-10-14 15:46:43	minimalism	it's end-to-end
2016-10-14 15:46:55	minimalism	I don't think it goes through an exit node though
2016-10-14 15:47:00	minimalism	it uses a nameserver
2016-10-14 15:47:23	minimalism	The nice thing about it though..
2016-10-14 15:47:36	minimalism	a tox ID is a long alphanumeric string
2016-10-14 15:47:39	alyptik	i am gonna install it now and check it out
2016-10-14 15:47:46	minimalism	and that displays in friends list for your contacts
2016-10-14 15:47:49	minimalism	what their ID is
2016-10-14 15:47:56	minimalism	but you set display name via /nick like in IRC
2016-10-14 15:48:08	minimalism	but the thing is.. you can't add someone just by knowing their ID
2016-10-14 15:48:25	minimalism	the user you want to add would have to use the client's native function for outputting their id
2016-10-14 15:48:34	minimalism	which appends a 12 character alphanumeric to their ID string
2016-10-14 15:48:42	minimalism	that 12 character string is an anti-spam feature
2016-10-14 15:48:51	minimalism	you can't add them just by knowing the ID, you need that anti-spam string
2016-10-14 15:48:56	alyptik	oo
2016-10-14 15:48:59	minimalism	and the user could change that anti-spam string to something else right after
2016-10-14 15:49:02	minimalism	so if they block/delete you
2016-10-14 15:49:02		[15:49]
2016-10-14 15:49:04	alyptik	that is clever
2016-10-14 15:49:08	minimalism	you can't be sending them new contact requests
2016-10-14 15:49:11	minimalism	it just won't work
2016-10-14 15:49:29	minimalism	so even if you posted someone's tox ID all over the internet
2016-10-14 15:49:35	minimalism	or tox ID+antispam
2016-10-14 15:49:38	minimalism	it'd be meaningless
2016-10-14 15:49:47	minimalism	because you either don't have the antispam, or they changed it right after you did
2016-10-14 15:50:15	alyptik	when did this come out
2016-10-14 15:50:18	alyptik	tox i mean
2016-10-14 15:50:20	minimalism	It's the best designed chat protocol no one's talking about
2016-10-14 15:50:26	minimalism	I think 2-3 years ago
2016-10-14 15:50:31	minimalism	some guys on /g/ made it
2016-10-14 15:50:38	minimalism	but the guy who originally "led" the project
2016-10-14 15:50:41	alyptik	i only really started hearing about it past couple months
2016-10-14 15:50:45	minimalism	and I mean lead in a non-development sense
2016-10-14 15:50:51	minimalism	was a drama queen and stole money from the tox foundation
2016-10-14 15:51:09	minimalism	but the lead developer is a super anonymous dude who's never revealed his real name or anything
2016-10-14 15:51:19	minimalism	and he splintered the project and resumed the development on a new domain
2016-10-14 15:51:30	minimalism	while that drama queen is lying to everyone and pretending the lead developer is a rogue and a thief
2016-10-14 15:51:45	alyptik	lol
2016-10-14 15:51:53	minimalism	the old domain was tox.im, now it's tox.chat with the lead developer who actually created tox running it
2016-10-14 15:51:56	alyptik	FOSS politics
2016-10-14 15:52:05	minimalism	heh, it was just one idiot though
2016-10-14 15:52:10	minimalism	the lead developer is a legit person
2016-10-14 15:52:20	minimalism	The guy's name is irungentoo
2016-10-14 15:52:23	alyptik	i am on the site checking it out now while i build it
2016-10-14 15:52:25	minimalism	He also runs the Tox overlay for gentoo
2016-10-14 15:52:36	alyptik	i am gonna make the static package, gtk3 broke everything
2016-10-14 15:52:53	minimalism	so he's a hyper private gentoo user
2016-10-14 15:52:59	minimalism	I think he's trustworthy
2016-10-14 15:53:24	minimalism	the fact he hasn't revealed his identity and uses many secure things himself speaks volumes to his intent
2016-10-14 15:53:38	alyptik	what is toxcore-newgc?
2016-10-14 15:53:49	minimalism	that's a new version of the tox core
2016-10-14 15:53:53	minimalism	the protocol basically
2016-10-14 15:54:00	alyptik	yeah i respect devs who do that
2016-10-14 15:54:06	alyptik	ah gotcha
2016-10-14 15:54:09	minimalism	it has new functionality in regards to groupchat
2016-10-14 15:54:21	minimalism	I don't know if it's really there yet though.. I'm just using the original toxcore
2016-10-14 15:54:28	minimalism	NextHendrix was or is using the newgc though
2016-10-14 15:54:34	alyptik	the only static package is newgc
2016-10-14 15:54:40	alyptik	is it backwards compatible?
2016-10-14 15:54:49	minimalism	I'm actually not sure
2016-10-14 15:55:04	alyptik	well i guess i will find out
2016-10-14 15:55:05	minimalism	I don't think the lead developer cares or not about B/C
2016-10-14 15:55:12	minimalism	his entire focus is security and making sure this project works
2016-10-14 15:55:34	minimalism	net-im/toxic-9999
2016-10-14 15:55:36	minimalism	net-libs/tox-0_pre20160904
2016-10-14 15:55:38	minimalism	this is what I have installed
2016-10-14 15:55:50	minimalism	for all I know, that is newgc just not labeled as such
2016-10-14 15:56:12	alyptik	i guess toxcore is tox 
2016-10-14 15:56:20	minimalism	it is
2016-10-14 15:56:20	alyptik	so i think they are different
2016-10-14 15:56:23	minimalism	but you need a client as well
2016-10-14 15:56:37	alyptik	yeah i am installing toxic-newgc-static-git
2016-10-14 15:56:42	alyptik	pulls in toxcore-newgc
2016-10-14 15:56:49	minimalism	since irungentoo runs the tox overlay here
2016-10-14 15:56:54	minimalism	and "tox" is the only one in here
2016-10-14 15:56:57	minimalism	it could be newgc, or
2016-10-14 15:57:03	minimalism	he deems newgc to still be experimental
2016-10-14 15:57:06	minimalism	and so he didn't include it yet
2016-10-14 15:57:33	alyptik	ah
2016-10-14 15:57:47	alyptik	how is gentoo in regards to bleeding edge?
2016-10-14 15:57:55	alyptik	compared to say arch [testing]
2016-10-14 16:00:09	minimalism	to use bleeding edge packages in gentoo
2016-10-14 16:00:15	minimalism	you'd have to unmask the package
2016-10-14 16:00:21	minimalism	to use the latest (unstable version)
2016-10-14 16:00:25	minimalism	by default, it'll only let you use stable
2016-10-14 16:01:45	alyptik	oh ok, still trying to wrap my head around emerge
2016-10-14 16:03:39	minimalism	what about it
2016-10-14 16:03:53	alyptik	everything hah
2016-10-14 16:03:59	alyptik	atoms, searching
2016-10-14 16:04:02	minimalism	it's pretty straight forward mostly
2016-10-14 16:04:02		[16:04]
2016-10-14 16:04:23	minimalism	searching is just
2016-10-14 16:04:27	minimalism	emerge -s query
2016-10-14 16:04:52	minimalism	for title
2016-10-14 16:04:54	alyptik	oh wow that works
2016-10-14 16:04:58	minimalism	emerge -S query to search description
2016-10-14 16:05:16	alyptik	wait what
2016-10-14 16:05:28	minimalism	results include a description of the package
2016-10-14 16:05:37	alyptik	is -S title or disc?
2016-10-14 16:05:38	minimalism	uppercase S will allow you to exclusively search description
2016-10-14 16:05:42	minimalism	desc
2016-10-14 16:05:43	alyptik	oh my font
2016-10-14 16:05:44	minimalism	-s is title
2016-10-14 16:05:45	alyptik	hah
2016-10-14 16:06:00	alyptik	looked the same to me
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:49:08] you can't be sending them new contact requests [01:49:08]
2016-10-14 16:13:23		[16:13]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:49:11] it just won't work [01:49:11]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:49:29] so even if you posted someone's tox ID all over the internet [01:49:29]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:49:35] or tox ID+antispam [01:49:35]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:49:38] it'd be meaningless [01:49:38]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:49:47] because you either don't have the antispam, or they changed it right after you did [01:49:47]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:50:20] It's the best designed chat protocol no one's talking about [01:50:20]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:50:26] I think 2-3 years ago [01:50:26]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:50:31] some guys on /g/ made it [01:50:31]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:50:38] but the guy who originally "led" the project [01:50:38]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:50:45] and I mean lead in a non-development sense [01:50:45]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:50:51] was a drama queen and stole money from the tox foundation [01:50:51]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:51:09] but the lead developer is a super anonymous dude who's never revealed his real name or anything [01:51:09]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:51:19] and he splintered the project and resumed the development on a new domain [01:51:19]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:51:30] while that drama queen is lying to everyone and pretending the lead developer is a rogue and a thief [01:51:30]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:51:53] the old domain was tox.im, now it's tox.chat with the lead developer who actually created tox running it [01:51:53]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:52:05] heh, it was just one idiot though [01:52:05]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:52:10] the lead developer is a legit person [01:52:10]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:52:20] The guy's name is irungentoo [01:52:20]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:52:25] He also runs the Tox overlay for gentoo [01:52:25]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:52:53] so he's a hyper private gentoo user [01:52:53]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:52:59] I think he's trustworthy [01:52:59]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:53:24] the fact he hasn't revealed his identity and uses many secure things himself speaks volumes to his intent [01:53:24]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:53:49] that's a new version of the tox core [01:53:49]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:53:53] the protocol basically [01:53:53]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:54:09] it has new functionality in regards to groupchat [01:54:09]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:54:21] I don't know if it's really there yet though.. I'm just using the original toxcore [01:54:21]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:54:28] NextHendrix was or is using the newgc though [01:54:28]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:54:49] I'm actually not sure [01:54:49]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:55:05] I don't think the lead developer cares or not about B/C [01:55:05]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:55:12] his entire focus is security and making sure this project works [01:55:12]

2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:55:38] this is what I have installed [01:55:38]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:55:50] for all I know, that is newgc just not labeled as such [01:55:50]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:56:20] it is [01:56:20]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:56:23] but you need a client as well [01:56:23]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:56:49] since irungentoo runs the tox overlay here [01:56:49]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:56:54] and "tox" is the only one in here [01:56:54]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:56:57] it could be newgc, or [01:56:57]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:57:03] he deems newgc to still be experimental [01:57:03]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[01:57:06] and so he didn't include it yet [01:57:06]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[02:00:09] to use bleeding edge packages in gentoo [02:00:09]

2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[02:06:24] a lot of developers deem emerge kind of obsolete/default [02:06:24]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[02:06:35] and believe eix to be a better replacement [02:06:35]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[02:06:53] gentoolkit and eix are necessary packages [02:06:53]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[02:06:59] equery-list "*" lists all packages installed [02:06:59]

2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[02:07:34] then there's eclean.. haven't really used that yet [02:07:34]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[02:07:39] and revdep-rebuild [02:07:39]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[02:09:18] another important one is equery belongs [02:09:18]
2016-10-14 16:13:23	minimalism	[02:09:21] equivalent to pacman -Qo [02:09:21]
2016-10-14 16:14:06	alyptik	there we go
2016-10-14 16:14:33	alyptik	i need to figure out what is crashing it, it's something to do with a kernel module i know for sure
2016-10-14 16:15:15	alyptik	oh wow i was looking for a -Qo option too
2016-10-14 16:15:30	alyptik	s/was/was just
2016-10-14 16:15:55	minimalism	I had to write a .zsh file of aliases to include
2016-10-14 16:16:04	minimalism	just to remember all of the emerge and portage related tools
2016-10-14 16:16:16	alyptik	i keep all mine in aliases.sh
2016-10-14 16:16:31	alyptik	i should make .zsh modules 
2016-10-14 16:16:31	minimalism	I have $ZDOTDIR/includes/, with
2016-10-14 16:16:35	alyptik	it is too big already
2016-10-14 16:16:53	minimalism	aliases.zsh, functions.zsh, gentoo.zsh, keybindings.zsh
2016-10-14 16:16:56	alyptik	ah crap but i share it with bash
2016-10-14 16:17:04	minimalism	fuck bash
2016-10-14 16:17:12	minimalism	I don't think it matters though
2016-10-14 16:17:18	minimalism	it's just a file extension for syntax highlighting
2016-10-14 16:17:22	minimalism	it should still function the same
2016-10-14 16:17:33	alyptik	good point
2016-10-14 16:19:05	alyptik	oh my syntax highlight is done via my shebang
2016-10-14 16:19:11	alyptik	i don't even need the ,zsh heh
2016-10-14 16:25:00		[16:19]
2016-10-14 16:32:45	minimalism	ah, I don't include the shebang for .zsh file
2016-10-14 16:33:22	alyptik	i use it because i initially had zsh-only stuff in there 
2016-10-14 16:33:26	alyptik	just never took it out
2016-10-14 16:33:33	alyptik	still works ok in bash oddly enough
2016-10-14 16:34:11	minimalism	I try to pretend bash doesn't exist
2016-10-14 16:34:21	minimalism	I'm hoping one of these days we remove it from linux distributions
2016-10-14 16:34:29	minimalism	and just have plain bourne shell
2016-10-14 16:34:31	minimalism	and zsh
2016-10-14 16:34:31	alyptik	i only use it on my root account incase zhs ever breaks
2016-10-14 16:34:51	alyptik	i am pretty sure sh is just bash in arch

2016-10-16 00:01:58	minimalism	[02:09:18] another important one is equery belongs [02:09:18]
2016-10-16 00:01:58	minimalism	[02:09:21] equivalent to pacman -Qo [02:09:21]
2016-10-16 00:01:58	minimalism	[02:15:55] I had to write a .zsh file of aliases to include [02:15:55]
2016-10-16 00:01:58	minimalism	[02:16:04] just to remember all of the emerge and portage related tools [02:16:04]
2016-10-16 00:01:58	minimalism	[02:16:31] I have $ZDOTDIR/includes/, with [02:16:31]
2016-10-16 00:01:58	minimalism	[02:16:53] aliases.zsh, functions.zsh, gentoo.zsh, keybindings.zsh [02:16:53]
2016-10-16 00:01:58	minimalism	[02:17:04] fuck bash [02:17:04]
2016-10-16 00:01:58	minimalism	[02:17:12] I don't think it matters though [02:17:12]
2016-10-16 00:01:58	minimalism	[02:17:18] it's just a file extension for syntax highlighting [02:17:18]
2016-10-16 00:01:58	minimalism	[02:17:22] it should still function the same [02:17:22]
2016-10-16 00:01:58	minimalism	[02:32:45] ah, I don't include the shebang for .zsh file [02:32:45]
2016-10-16 00:01:58	minimalism	[02:34:11] I try to pretend bash doesn't exist [02:34:11]
2016-10-16 00:01:58	minimalism	[02:34:21] I'm hoping one of these days we remove it from linux distributions [02:34:21]
2016-10-16 00:01:58	minimalism	[02:34:29] and just have plain bourne shell [02:34:29]
2016-10-16 00:01:58	minimalism	[02:34:31] and zsh [02:34:31]
2016-10-16 16:43:15	minimalism	Try out tox yet?
2016-10-16 16:43:15		[16:43]
2016-10-16 16:46:05	alyptik	hah i actually haven't
2016-10-16 16:46:12	alyptik	i keep getting distracted reading zsh man pages
2016-10-16 16:46:23	alyptik	it has so much cool shit i didn't know about like extended globbing
2016-10-16 16:48:05	minimalism	I've been working on more gentoo stuff today
2016-10-16 16:48:14	minimalism	forked/wrote a minimal init script to run openvpn
2016-10-16 16:48:22	minimalism	got savedconfig USE flag working for suckless stuff
2016-10-16 16:48:27	alyptik	tun or tap?
2016-10-16 16:48:33	minimalism	then learned more about how it separates users a lot
2016-10-16 16:48:40	minimalism	like how emerge really is just portage user/group
2016-10-16 16:48:48	minimalism	so I couldn't perm 600/700 files and dirs in /etc/portage
2016-10-16 16:48:52	minimalism	always a learning experience on gentoo
2016-10-16 16:48:54	minimalism	and tun
2016-10-16 16:49:11	alyptik	wait what
2016-10-16 16:49:20	alyptik	emerge the binary you mean
2016-10-16 16:49:41	alyptik	what is emerge in this context
2016-10-16 16:49:59	minimalism	emerge the command
2016-10-16 16:50:10	minimalism	it's used as the portage user/group
2016-10-16 16:50:11	alyptik	yeah why does that stop chmod?
2016-10-16 16:50:13	alyptik	oh as
2016-10-16 16:50:16	minimalism	so if something belongs to root and isn't readable to everyone
2016-10-16 16:50:19	minimalism	it just can't do anything
2016-10-16 16:50:28	minimalism	even if it's portage's own config
2016-10-16 16:50:33	alyptik	yeah that is the best way of handling it
2016-10-16 16:50:54	alyptik	pacman is just root hah
2016-10-16 16:53:18	alyptik	i restarted myself with tab complete again today
2016-10-16 16:53:35	alyptik	still confuses me why that is even possible
2016-10-16 16:53:42	alyptik	i have a lot to learn about zsh
2016-10-16 16:54:11	minimalism	I don't know how much I know/don't know about zsh
2016-10-16 16:54:16	minimalism	but my configs are pretty organized and great
2016-10-16 16:54:34	alyptik	the rabbit whole is deep as fuck
2016-10-16 16:54:54	alyptik	i started reading things like the file that does systemd completions and jesus
2016-10-16 16:56:08	alyptik	http://ix.io/1wPr
2016-10-16 16:56:21	alyptik	i admit i don't understand even 10% of that
2016-10-16 16:56:45	minimalism	Haven't looked into it, but I'm honestly not concerned with that type of functionality
2016-10-16 16:56:54	minimalism	it's more of a convenience type functionality that probably took a lot of black magic
2016-10-16 16:57:31	alyptik	i guess i just like taking apart things 
2016-10-16 16:57:41	minimalism	I do as well, but not in that particular context
2016-10-16 16:57:52	minimalism	I like learning how to use shell, but it's not something I really feel like taking apart
2016-10-16 16:57:55	minimalism	at least not now..
2016-10-16 16:58:04	minimalism	maybe the shell functions, but autocomplete doesn't seem that interesting
2016-10-16 16:58:06	alyptik	heh that's what i like about zsh
2016-10-16 16:58:12	alyptik	you can super customize it, or just not
2016-10-16 16:58:16	alyptik	works great both ways
2016-10-16 16:58:16		[16:58]
2016-10-16 16:58:20	minimalism	right now I just have a rager for the machine
2016-10-16 16:58:28	minimalism	the kernel, init, scripting, overall config, security
2016-10-16 16:58:31	minimalism	ricing in general
2016-10-16 16:58:35	alyptik	it is interesting how it completes things like git
2016-10-16 16:58:42	alyptik	it know when to complete subcommands and such
2016-10-16 16:58:47	alyptik	s/know/knows
2016-10-16 16:59:00	minimalism	all I know is
2016-10-16 16:59:15	alyptik	kernels are cool too
2016-10-16 16:59:18	minimalism	arch is basically dead to me until they get rid of systemd, make ABS more of a first class citizen alternative to pacman
2016-10-16 16:59:25	alyptik	i am trying to learn more about kernel modules
2016-10-16 16:59:31	minimalism	yeah
2016-10-16 16:59:47	minimalism	I have to handle modules now as well since I'm trimming my kernel more, and have to customize an initramfs with dracut
2016-10-16 16:59:57	alyptik	do you use an initramfs?
2016-10-16 17:00:00	alyptik	thought it wasn't needed
2016-10-16 17:00:05	minimalism	yeah, but it's a bad one
2016-10-16 17:00:13	minimalism	I do want/need support for some things during boot
2016-10-16 17:00:17	alyptik	ah
2016-10-16 17:00:22	minimalism	I want radeon in place to properly set resolution from the start, and
2016-10-16 17:00:29	minimalism	to support PARTUUID
2016-10-16 17:00:40	minimalism	so I can use that to specify the partition for boot and root in my efibootmgr line
2016-10-16 17:00:54	minimalism	right now it only allows me to specify device like /dev/sda1
2016-10-16 17:02:07	alyptik	do you use secure boot?
2016-10-16 17:02:11	minimalism	no
2016-10-16 17:02:24	minimalism	if you have two drives, or want to create another vm
2016-10-16 17:02:27	minimalism	you should really try alpine
2016-10-16 17:02:46	minimalism	I think you'd like it.. its minimal build and choice of tools makes me think of unix machines from the 80s for some reason
2016-10-16 17:02:49	alyptik	i am gonna install gentoo in one of my lvm lv's
2016-10-16 17:02:55	alyptik	i cna do it form a chroot in arch right
2016-10-16 17:02:56	minimalism	even though I've never used one.. It just feels that way
2016-10-16 17:03:00	alyptik	maybe will try alpine after
2016-10-16 17:03:13	minimalism	you can chroot them, yeah
2016-10-16 17:03:15	alyptik	s/form/from
2016-10-16 17:03:18	minimalism	I was using gentoo in a chroot
2016-10-16 17:03:24	minimalism	before installing for real
2016-10-16 17:03:28	alyptik	i don't need live cd i mean right? i can just do it booted
2016-10-16 17:03:34	alyptik	or is that a bad idea
2016-10-16 17:03:36	minimalism	you don't need a gentoo cd
2016-10-16 17:03:39	minimalism	you can use archiso
2016-10-16 17:03:40	alyptik	any live cd
2016-10-16 17:03:47	alyptik	i want to do it with system running
2016-10-16 17:03:51	minimalism	archiso is oddly enough, the best possible livecd
2016-10-16 17:03:53	minimalism	for gentoo
2016-10-16 17:04:11	minimalism	and yeah, you can do that too
2016-10-16 17:04:20	alyptik	cool, saves me a lot of trouble
2016-10-16 17:04:25	minimalism	the first time I did that, because I was still learning
2016-10-16 17:04:31	minimalism	but I was only using it as a chroot mostly
2016-10-16 17:04:41	minimalism	this time when I installed for real, I didn't
2016-10-16 17:04:46	minimalism	stayed in the tty and just suffered through
2016-10-16 17:05:44	alyptik	it will make setting up boatloader easier for me 
2016-10-16 17:05:52	alyptik	archiso doesn't boot in secure boot mode
2016-10-16 17:05:57	alyptik	and gentoo iso is not efi
2016-10-16 17:06:17	minimalism	nope, that's the issue for me
2016-10-16 17:06:32	minimalism	people who want efi either use archiso or systemrescuecd, but systemrescuecd imo is tacky and it pissed me off
2016-10-16 17:06:41	minimalism	archiso is the best general purpose rock solid livecd
2016-10-16 17:07:40	alyptik	yeah i looked at systemrescue
2016-10-16 17:07:42	alyptik	seems meh to me
2016-10-16 17:07:47	minimalism	Did I tell you how my system booted at?
2016-10-16 17:07:49	minimalism	in X
2016-10-16 17:07:52	alyptik	i use alt linux when i need to fix bootloader
2016-10-16 17:07:58	alyptik	at?
2016-10-16 17:08:05	minimalism	like in terms of resource usage
2016-10-16 17:08:19	alyptik	oh nope what is your pid1 usage?
2016-10-16 17:08:28	minimalism	I can't say atm, but
2016-10-16 17:08:41	minimalism	I haven't trimmed everything wasting resources just yet, but I did remove the extra tty2-6
2016-10-16 17:08:48	minimalism	and I that on arch as well, however
2016-10-16 17:09:05	minimalism	on arch even trimmed as much as I could mostly, X would boot at about 230-260MiB of RAM in use
2016-10-16 17:09:09	minimalism	on gentoo.. 100
2016-10-16 17:09:11	minimalism	started mpv too
2016-10-16 17:09:13	minimalism	148
2016-10-16 17:09:23	alyptik	i am using 5.6G RAM atm
2016-10-16 17:09:25	alyptik	damned chromium
2016-10-16 17:09:50	minimalism	1.49 here with chromium also open
2016-10-16 17:09:59	minimalism	depending on # of tabs, it can be about 900 MiB
2016-10-16 17:10:19	minimalism	I also have my ncmpcpp visualizer running
2016-10-16 17:10:59	alyptik	what are your chromium flags?
2016-10-16 17:11:17	alyptik	using --memory-model=low
2016-10-16 17:11:18	alyptik	?
2016-10-16 17:11:19	minimalism	+proprietary-codecs
2016-10-16 17:11:21	minimalism	+suid
2016-10-16 17:11:23	minimalism	+system-ffmpeg
2016-10-16 17:11:25	minimalism	+tcmalloc
2016-10-16 17:11:39	alyptik	oh not USE flags
2016-10-16 17:11:47	alyptik	the .config file
2016-10-16 17:11:52	alyptik	do you use one?
2016-10-16 17:11:59	minimalism	nope
2016-10-16 17:12:08	alyptik	damn wtf
2016-10-16 17:12:14	alyptik	how is it using so little ram for you
2016-10-16 17:12:19	minimalism	because gentoo, negro
2016-10-16 17:12:23	alyptik	hah
2016-10-16 17:12:32	alyptik	also why suid?
2016-10-16 17:12:38	minimalism	that's just default
2016-10-16 17:12:47	alyptik	ah, wonder what it uses suid for
2016-10-16 17:12:53	minimalism	sandboxing
2016-10-16 17:12:59	minimalism	that's why a lot of people argue firefox isn't secure
2016-10-16 17:13:02	minimalism	chromium can sandbox
2016-10-16 17:13:15	alyptik	oh didn't think of that
2016-10-16 17:13:52	minimalism	you should really take a shot at installing toxic now
2016-10-16 17:13:52		[17:13]
2016-10-16 17:13:59	minimalism	pretty easy to configure and use
2016-10-16 17:15:03	alyptik	alright i'll start compiling it while i work on my aliases file
2016-10-16 17:15:17	minimalism	damn, already forgot how to read the syntax of my PS1
2016-10-16 17:16:19	alyptik	oh it finished
2016-10-16 17:16:27	alyptik	i was expecting a bigger compile
2016-10-16 17:17:54	alyptik	ok i am configuring it now
2016-10-16 17:23:00		[17:17]
2016-10-16 17:27:02	minimalism	writing functions for amixer now
2016-10-16 17:32:59	minimalism	tempted to just install pulse as much as I only want to use alsa
2016-10-16 17:33:12	alyptik	it does make life easier at times
2016-10-16 17:33:20	alyptik	or you could just run jack2 24/7 hah
2016-10-16 17:33:24	minimalism	the way it interprets levels and volumes
2016-10-16 17:33:26	minimalism	it just wrong
2016-10-16 17:35:34	alyptik	i mostly use it for easy switching between multiple cards
2016-10-16 17:35:40	minimalism	yeah
