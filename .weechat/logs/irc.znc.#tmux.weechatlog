2016-09-16 00:43:53	andjjj23	I'm hoping for some help. I'm trying to ensure that when i launch a new tmux session, the environment variable SESSION_MANAGER gets set on all of the bash instances of any panes in create in that session
2016-09-16 00:44:34	andjjj23	I tried putting the following in my .tmux.conf - set-option -ga update-environment " SESSION_MANAGER"
2016-09-16 00:45:29	andjjj23	then starting a new tmux session. But the SESSION_MANAGER env variable's value is not the same as it was in the shell i launched it from, as expected
2016-09-16 00:45:29		[00:45]
2016-09-16 00:45:58	andjjj23	anyone know how to get this env var passed along to the new tmux+bash sessions properly?

2016-09-16 00:50:10	nicm	are you sure you restarted tmux entirely?
2016-09-16 00:50:56	andjjj23	I believe so. I don't need to restart all the tmux processes on my system, right? Just starting a brand new tmux session should be sufficient to ensure the configuration change is working?
2016-09-16 00:51:19	nicm	no
2016-09-16 00:51:27	nicm	config file is only read when the server starts

2016-09-16 00:51:42	nicm	you will need to restart tmux entirely or set it manually in the existing server
2016-09-16 00:51:55	andjjj23	right but i'm running a bunch of servers on my system
