2016-09-09 01:20:29	Zeno`	sh4z, and think about how you can free that memory after a successful call to realloc()
2016-09-09 01:20:49	rawrawrer	sh4z, where is hostsfn used later? It's probably reassigned and so you lose the reference. Or just not freed?
2016-09-09 01:20:52	sh4z	i think maybe the order is incorrect and it may be setting it null but not actually deleting it

2016-09-09 01:22:18	Zeno`	look, when you call realloc() it mallocs and returns a pointer to a *new* block of memory (if successful)
2016-09-09 01:22:28	Zeno`	it's up to the programmer to free the *old* block of memory

2016-09-09 05:12:51	gr33n3r2	UniFreak: to clarify about 'const' - it does declare a variable as unmodifiable, but you can create a non-const pointer to that variable and cast it, and that would allow you to modify it.
2016-09-09 05:12:59	cousteau	whereas e is actually an object; when you use `e` you're referring to an object called "e", which is a const object.  Since it's const, it'll probably be optimized so that whenever you use `e` the compiler will replace that with the actual value rather than looking up its value in memory

2016-09-09 09:08:33	dstolfa	EEVV: so, Linux has LXC/LXD for it's containers, they're quite difficult to set up securely, FreeBSD offers jails, which are quite stable(first appeared in 2000). they are alot easier to set up securely and people often use them to jail services they deem insecure. their overhead is really low, as i ran over 100k jails and had no issues on a core i3 and 8GB of RAM, which can't be said for Linux LXC/LXD, but
2016-09-09 09:08:35	dstolfa	that's probably due to the non O(1) scheduler(afaik). Linux thrashed after 10k containers.

2016-09-09 23:26:20	Kaslai	Of course. The reason for !strcmp is because *cmp functions usually provide more than just equality data
2016-09-09 23:26:38	atk	the reason stdbool.h exists is to prevent collisions
2016-09-09 23:26:48	Kaslai	The return value is usually the difference between the first mismatched bytes

2016-09-09 23:30:30	Kaslai	The  sign  of  a  nonzero  value  returned  by  the  comparison  functions memcmp, strcmp, and strncmp is determined by the sign of the difference between the values of the first pair of characters (both interpreted as unsigned char) that differ in the objects being compared.

2016-09-09 23:32:12	Kaslai	...But how is that defined? :p

2016-09-09 23:41:02	slevin	high all! simple question on preventing buffer overflows: i want to use argv[1] as function argument. how can i safely do that? was thinking something like `char a[20]; strncpy(a, argv[1], 20); fun(a);` ?

2016-09-09 23:43:24	Kaslai	slevin: first, it's safe to assume that any argv values are valid C strings, but you need to make sure that you have as many arguments as you think you do by checking argc
2016-09-09 23:44:14	rawrawrer	slevin, also, strncpy won't null-terminate a[] if the string is longer than 20 bytes.
2016-09-09 23:44:35	Kaslai	And one gotcha about many string functions which fill limited buffers like strncpy is that they often won't null terminate the string if the buffer is smaller than the input string

2016-09-09 23:48:41	Kaslai	You can also pass argc values directly into functions if you wish, as they are normal C strings. If you want to change them within the functions though, then I would recommend passing in a copy.

2016-09-10 12:10:50	tom99	i mean these textbooks go on for ever about objects and inheritance and how awesome it is that you can have the Dog object inherit its functions from the Pet object which inherits from the Animal object
2016-09-10 12:10:50		[12:10]
2016-09-10 12:11:54	Kaslai	Just my 2 cents: ideal OOP is hard to come by
2016-09-10 12:12:47	Kaslai	Usually objects can't 100% match the interface of the object from which they inherit, or some inherited functionality doesn't make sense
2016-09-10 12:12:53	Stragus	My main problem with OOP (the way it's generally written) is that it makes everything depends on everything, modularity and specificity of purposes are lost, and all the code related to any piece of code is spread all over the place, everywhere

2016-09-10 12:13:44	Kaslai	In trivial applications with just one or two levels of inheritance in very rigorously defined areas, it can be okay, but it's not uncommon to see a class which inherits from a class which inherits from a class which partially inherits from a class...
2016-09-10 12:14:09	hypnopothesis	I think OOP keeps you in a box and the 'real' programmers actually build the objects
2016-09-10 12:14:54	Stragus	Also, many "cute" features of OOP often have serious runtime performance costs
2016-09-10 12:15:00	Kaslai	Games are one of few instances where OOP concepts can make some sense, though even then it doesn't make sense for all cases, and you'll still see some really awkward constructs shoehorned into the likes of Unreal or Crytek

2016-09-10 12:16:09	Kaslai	And dynamic_cast*
2016-09-10 12:16:52	Kaslai	It's easy to forget that a virtual function call involves looking up a function pointer and calling it, where calling a function directly could even mean it gets inlined
2016-09-10 12:17:28	Kaslai	And if you didn't author the class, how would you even know that it's a virtual function without dumping the internals?
2016-09-10 12:17:32	hypnopothesis	Kaslai: are you relating virtual functions in C to OOP?
2016-09-10 12:17:36	Stragus	And the whole "everything is an object that must be individually allocated on the heap" is terrible
2016-09-10 12:18:10	Kaslai	hypnopothesis: no. However OOP does a lot to mask things with real run-time penalties, wheras in C you have to build and index into your own virtual function table

2016-09-10 13:14:55	bone	Khudher: no, the standard libraries are very limited, and in fact you typically need to be writing the implementation of malloc to use OS facilities, not the other way around.

2016-09-10 13:17:51	bone	Khudher: eventually you wind up relying on an operating system API of some sort to do the real i/o type work for you.
2016-09-10 13:17:57	Kaslai	C for systems programming is done much differently than standard C, to the extent that they can be considered almost totally different disciplines

2016-09-10 13:18:33	bone	you may not really want to do that due to the sheer volume of labor and due diligence required compared to other languages.
2016-09-10 13:18:52	Kaslai	Sure all the language constructs are still there, but you have to write everything yourself, even the code to directly deal with any hardware IO and anything which builds on top of that

2016-09-10 13:46:33	Emil	C is a high level abstraction and it's implementarion is always tightly connected to the underlying system. However, programming in C is not coupled in any way to the hardware. The only thing "guaranteed" is that if I write x=y*9+1 is that I will have the value of that expression somewhere in orderly matter. I however dont know when it happens, there are no guarantees about deterministic time execution or that
2016-09-10 13:46:39	Emil	it will even happen in the order I wrote it would.
2016-09-10 13:46:53	Emil	C is not machine code, not even close.

You dont have the time nor the effort to study the compiler behaviour to a degree that you can say "this does exactly that at this precise moment".

2016-09-10 14:20:46	Kaslai	There are a few issues at play here
2016-09-10 14:21:16	Kaslai	When you promote an integer type to another integer type (such as a char to an int) then the new value will have the same numerical value as the original value

2016-09-10 15:16:50	joebobjoe	Emil: look right here, pixel = *((Uint32*)surface->pixels);, they are casting void* to Uint32* in https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_PixelFormat second example

2016-09-10 15:41:05	Gr33nCam3l	Ah, i see! Yep that fixes my error. But I'm confused why "wasPresent = false" works but not "wasPresent = true"
2016-09-10 15:41:23	doppel	because false = 0, and 0 is a null pointer constant.
2016-09-10 15:41:57	Gr33nCam3l	Ok, gotcha. So I can just leave that line as is then, right?
2016-09-10 15:42:12	doppel	the problem would have become more evident when you noticed the bool had in fact not changed in value at all.

2016-09-10 20:10:04	rawrawrer	Is position a pointer? You only need to allocate the memory for pointers.
2016-09-10 20:10:16	Stragus	No need to strdup() or malloc() every single word
2016-09-10 20:10:41	koro	it depends what he wants to do

2016-09-10 20:12:02	Stragus	Depends on the problem, yes, but it's wasteful and inefficient to malloc() many such tiny chunks of memory; should be avoided when possible
2016-09-10 20:12:35	koro	for the kind of thing he's doing, i'd strongly suggest doing precisely that

2016-09-10 20:13:32	beardedmouse	I wanted to have a hash_table array of 20011 slots of struct Data. Then be able to pass that hash table back and forth. The function Hash_File would tokenize a wordfile into the hash_table. Then the FileCompare function would compare words in the hash_table and another file.
2016-09-10 20:13:52	Stragus	Then malloc() the whole text and be done with it
2016-09-10 20:14:21	beardedmouse	doesn't strcpy do that for me?
2016-09-10 20:14:51	Stragus	No, it copies from a to b, it doesn't allocate
2016-09-10 20:15:00	koro	strcpy still requires you to alloc the memory for the string
2016-09-10 20:17:30	beardedmouse	So because word in my structure is a pointer instead of a static array I would need to further malloc memory for it? As opposed to position which is already set or would I need to goahead and malloc that too?
2016-09-10 20:18:07	Stragus	You don't need to malloc memory for it, you just need to make sure it points to some valid chunk of memory
2016-09-10 20:18:16	rawrawrer	No, position is a static array inside the structure, it's included in the size of the structure.
2016-09-10 20:18:21	Stragus	The stack was valid until you returned from the function, so that's not a good option
2016-09-10 20:18:35	rawrawrer	beardedmouse, on line 71 you allocate 20 kB on the stack to store the file, Stragus is saying to change that into a malloc. So the pointers in the hash table entries would point into that block of memory, and be valid until you freed the block.
2016-09-10 20:18:37	Stragus	Therefore, just malloc() the whole text instead of putting it on the stack, done

But since that stack/chunk of memory is local scope it will get released once the function is done? Thus when I was defining hash_table[hash_key]->word=word I was merely coping pointers and not copying the actual string.

2016-09-10 21:02:55	caze	You cast aside the abstraction provided by the specification, as if knowledge of the implementation somehow influences behavior.

2016-09-11 06:03:07	dstolfa	fizzie: i'll probably end up doing that, just wanted to see if someone knew what was going on before i dive into that
2016-09-11 06:03:11	warchild	my gut instinct is that you are running into caching issues and flushing stdout is affecting the timing enough to make it go away
2016-09-11 06:03:53	warchild	i would try to run it in gdb and put a watchpoint on the stack variables after they are pushed and see where the writes are coming from

2016-09-11 09:40:24	SkyWanker	I guess the way the recursivity check each index of the arrays is thanks to the s1 or s2 + 1

2016-09-11 09:50:12	marchelzo	i thought that was written by someone else?
2016-09-11 09:50:18	Emil	Suppose I have a expensive function called from main and during execution of said expensive function I catch a signal. Based on that signal, can I stop executing that expensive function somehow and perform an early return or go somewhere else?

2016-09-11 09:51:42	Emil	jack_rabbit: but how? Suppose I'm performing a blocking write or read that I want to cancel. I can use gotos but I do wonder if there are better ways
2016-09-11 09:51:42	marchelzo	Emil: use setjmp and longjmp perhaps
2016-09-11 09:51:54	Emil	marchelzo: but isn't that a bit dirty?
2016-09-11 09:52:20	jack_rabbit	Ahh, I see.
2016-09-11 09:52:23	marchelzo	that's really subjective
2016-09-11 09:52:32	SkyWanker	Well it is supposed to compare two strings, s2 can have one wildcard anywhere so test.c will match *.c or hello match *ello.
2016-09-11 09:52:35	twkm	you can't use goto.  sigjmp is just a goto.
2016-09-11 09:52:55	SkyWanker	if both strings match, i need to return 1. Zero if not.
2016-09-11 09:52:55	twkm	SkyWanker: the phrase divide and conquer might be useful to consider.

2016-09-11 14:01:48	Stragus	In practice, that undefined behavior is either a segfault or slower access
2016-09-11 14:01:49	n0p_quake	I dunno, you see programming as set of rules..
2016-09-11 14:01:57	joebobjoe	Chris: it's just weird to me that a spec says undefined, if, rather than just undefined, always
2016-09-11 14:02:27	Chris	joebobjoe: why? there are practical reasons to cast(or implicitly convert) void * to another pointer type. That's sort of the entire basis of malloc.
2016-09-11 14:03:15	Chris	Lots of things are conditionally undefined. For example the ++ operator is undefined on a signed integer if it's at the maximum value of that type already.
2016-09-11 14:03:51	joebobjoe	Chris: why doesn't the C specification just disallow undefined behvaior
2016-09-11 14:04:07	Chris	Because some undefined behavior is impossible to detect until runtime.
2016-09-11 14:04:16	joebobjoe	Chris: I saw that. they claim that allows you to optimize x + 1 > x to TRUE
2016-09-11 14:04:21	Chris	And as was said above, it's often useful as an extension to defined undefined behavior.
2016-09-11 14:04:54	joebobjoe	Chris: But the possibility of undefined behavior isn't impossible to detect at runtime
2016-09-11 14:05:00	joebobjoe	compile time*
2016-09-11 14:05:08	tom99	[19:01] <Chris> Then sure. It must be correctly aligned otherwise the behavior is undefined.
2016-09-11 14:05:11	tom99	That's the C rap yo
2016-09-11 14:05:12	n0p_quake	Well it defeats the implementation. That's like granting some kind of interface to the system call API on something like the JVM
2016-09-11 14:05:32	Chris	joebobjoe: You'd get false negatives. It's equivalent to the halting problem in that regard.
2016-09-11 14:05:55	Chris	joebobjoe: How would you tell at compile time if a given algorithm caused an integer overflow for any possible input?
2016-09-11 14:05:59	joebobjoe	How can x + 1 > x be optimized to TRUE, if MAX_INT + 1 is undefined. x + 1 could be *less* than x. So how can you claim this optimization is valid
2016-09-11 14:06:13	Chris	joebobjoe: what?
2016-09-11 14:06:22	Chris	joebobjoe: how can x + 1 be less than x?
2016-09-11 14:06:34	joebobjoe	Chris: if x is 2's complement and wraps?
2016-09-11 14:06:42	Chris	joebobjoe: that's undefined behavior in C. We just went through that.
2016-09-11 14:06:42	n0p_quake	Yeah precadence
2016-09-11 14:07:08	Chris	joebobjoe: You just said yourself that's [one reason] why integer overflow is undefined.
2016-09-11 14:07:11	joebobjoe	Chris: right. it is undefined behavior. so it *could* wrap and be less than X
2016-09-11 14:07:22	Chris	joebobjoe: sure, but the program's already undefined so who cares?
2016-09-11 14:07:23	Stragus	Some things being undefined behavior actually allow the compiler to produce faster code
2016-09-11 14:07:31	Chris	Implementations are permitted to assume undefined behavior never happens.

2016-09-11 14:08:19	joebobjoe	Chris: so in theory. to make a valid C program, you have to check that you never cause MAX_INT + 1

Sometimes this is difficult to do in my own code when I would like to include a string that was allocated by the called function in the error message. Go fixes this by replacing int error returns with error types that can hold strings I think. What do you a

In C, if I want to include a string in an error message that a called function created, I have to either break the convention of error propagation and print the error in the called function, return the string and rely on the caller to free it, or have the caller recreate the string based on the error code. Can anyone suggest a good compromise in C?

2016-09-11 16:41:30	rawrawrer	You could have something like a global char buffer for storing error messages, and just pass back an int error code and let the caller look up the message.
2016-09-11 16:41:53	Chris	Gross.
2016-09-11 16:41:53	gs6	For example, if main calls open with some string and open sets errno to ENOENT, main has access to the argument it provided open. But if main calls my function foo and foo creates a path and calls open, the issue is printing path: No such file or directory in main when main doesn't have access to "path"

2016-09-11 16:42:55	Chris	So do what I suggested, if you must.
2016-09-11 16:43:14	Chris	You'll have to have main pass a pointer to where you want the error stored.

2016-09-11 16:44:14	gs6	Chris: The issue I have with that is that either it fails if the buffer is fixed size or the caller has to free the string if the called function dynamically allocates the buffer of the apropriate size
2016-09-11 16:44:31	Chris	How does it "fail if the buffer is fixed size"?
2016-09-11 16:44:34	Chris	Make sure the buffer is big enough.

2016-09-11 16:46:36	Chris	gs6: for example, since you're using open (POSIX), you can use strerror_r to specify the size and PATH_MAX to ensure it's big enough for the path.

2016-09-11 17:03:04	Chris	And if you want to take the crazy further, what error do you propagate (and how) if foo can't allocate the memory for the buffer to store the error message?
2016-09-11 17:03:40	gs6	foo could allocate a buffer

2016-09-11 18:40:19	Chris	Of course you can do int blah = 2 / 3;

2016-09-12 01:16:29	hiwk	walb0: ok. so that pointer takes up 4 bytes in a (packed) struct. Note that there is no associated memory area for your actual chars yet

2016-09-12 05:50:01	twkm	for your program you don't actually need an array, though if it is a test case for something else you must find a way to size your array before reading the data or use realloc as you go (not with an array, their size cannot be changed).

2016-09-13 03:49:06	netzach	rather max_number+1, but if you consider 0...
2016-09-13 03:49:30	netzach	zxd: it's because in say n bits, as 4, max number is 1111, and 10000 is 2^5
2016-09-13 03:49:31	netzach	get it?
2016-09-13 03:49:58	netzach	so if you have n bits, the next number that can no longer be encoded in b bits is 2^n
2016-09-13 03:50:15	netzach	but if you count the actual numbers you get 2^n because of 0
2016-09-13 03:50:17	netzach	does that make sense zxd ?
2016-09-13 03:50:28	zxd	so you are counting '0' as a posibility aswell?
2016-09-13 03:50:39	zxd	so you are counting '0' as a posibility aswell?
2016-09-13 03:50:50	netzach	yes, that's why 2^n works as the number of "possibilities" but if you want hte max number its 2^n - 1
2016-09-13 03:50:57	netzach	unsigned of course
2016-09-13 03:51:38	zxd	ah
2016-09-13 03:52:13	zxd	so it's a trick I shouldn't take the exponent literally as the representation of the number of bits
2016-09-13 03:52:46	netzach	why do you say representation of the number of bits?
2016-09-13 03:53:19	netzach	if you know you have x specific values and want to find the minimal number of bits it can be encoded in you can use log2
2016-09-13 03:53:19		[03:53]
2016-09-13 03:54:36	netzach	zxd: 2^n works as the number of possibilities simply because the way numbers work? if I told you in base 10 you have 3 digits, you know max number after 3 is 10^3 = 1000, that is 999+1, so there are 1000 numbers that can be encoded in 3 digits (not exactly 3, but 0 - 999)
2016-09-13 03:55:57	zxd	but when counting ipv4 octects  I would do a table like 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
2016-09-13 03:56:01	zxd	where did the 1 come from?
2016-09-13 03:56:03	zxd	2^0 ?
2016-09-13 03:56:41	netzach	yes
2016-09-13 03:57:02	netzach	those are powers of two, but I don't know what you mean by that table, you mean splitting it in bytes?
2016-09-13 03:58:29	zxd	yes
2016-09-13 03:58:35	treehug88	what problem are you guys trying to solve?
2016-09-13 03:58:43	netzach	you want to transform a base 2 to base 10?

This is to allow C the freedom to be implemented on systems with different architectures. Programs invoking undefined behavior may appear to compile and even run without errors at first, only to fail on another system, or even at a later time. If you want to write reliable code, don't use such behaviors.

2016-09-13 08:43:28	atk	open, write, read, close are all posix and will work on file descriptors.

2016-09-13 08:51:55	Kaslai	Well you've got x ++ ++ + y. Suffix ++ has the highest precedence so first we can transform it to (x++)+++y. Prefix ++ and unary + have the next precedence level and are right to left, so we then get (x++)(++(+y)). +y is an rvalue, so ++(+y) fails, and there's no binary operator between (x++) and (++(+y)) so it fails in more ways than one.

2016-09-13 10:53:26	fizzie	Calling automatic the "default storage duration of objects" is a bit incomplete, since the default also depends on linkage. (Which doesn't make 'auto' any more useful, since it isn't allowed in any place the default would be different.)

2016-09-13 12:04:05	snood1205	el24: The I portion of IO I agree with, but not the O part. I feel like stdout can be useful on a machine without an os.
2016-09-13 12:04:09	atk	when you're dealing with MCUs you're usually dealing with freestanding C and nothing is implemented anyway
2016-09-13 12:04:21	atk	freestanding c and a replacement non-standard libc
2016-09-13 12:04:33	atk	usually not providing a full hosted implementation

2016-09-13 15:13:33	masochist	so reinventing the wheel is the solution you take? I guess if your only experience is with closed source apps it's your only choice...

2016-09-13 15:16:21	benllben	Maybe it is just time to move away from windows
2016-09-13 15:17:04	masochist	yes.
2016-09-13 15:17:20	masochist	or get a dedicated gaming machine.
2016-09-13 15:17:48	benllben	Only problem is linux acts weird on my laptop. And i cant go desktop because i live on a uni campus and need my computer to be portable
2016-09-13 15:18:08	masochist	get a dedicated Linux laptop then
2016-09-13 15:18:24	benllben	Linux sometimes boots up in a weird mode where it loads the screen line by line in layers. and then takes 5-10 seconds to respond to input / clicks
2016-09-13 15:18:42	benllben	Even with Linux being the only installation on a fresh ssd
2016-09-13 15:18:42	masochist	that sounds like a problem that can be solved by not using systemd
2016-09-13 15:19:11	bone	given that it is a gaming machine, you could probably run it in a virtual machine.
2016-09-13 15:19:22	bone	assuming you have enough ram and a reasonably fast disk.

2016-09-13 17:48:52	Kaslai	On at least 4.8.5, std=c99 does not enable many of POSIX feature test macros, wheras gnu99 enables a ton of them
2016-09-13 17:49:15	_Raiz	caze, I'm afraid of harming portability
2016-09-13 17:50:00	nchambers	portability is silly, and I'm pretty sure thats a pebkac error preventing you from using getaddrinfo
2016-09-13 17:50:25	_Raiz	never heard of that error, I actually find it convenient to use getaddrinfo
2016-09-13 17:50:36	nchambers	paste your code?
2016-09-13 17:50:39	Kaslai	You have to tie yourself to some platform. POSIX is one of the most liberal platforms there is. If you really need a mega-portable library, write as much as you can in ISO C, and then concentrate all platform specific stuff as much as possible.
2016-09-13 17:51:07	mthowe	inet_pton is also a POSIX function conforming to the same standards as getaddrinfo, according to my man pages.
2016-09-13 17:51:08	Kaslai	So to port it, you have a much smaller surface to port.
2016-09-13 17:51:20	mthowe	So I don't think you'd be harming portability by using one over the other regardless.

2016-09-13 17:55:40	Moto-chan	Also, this code will fail in the case that the first char is an EOF since you skip the first check.
2016-09-13 17:56:10	Moto-chan	Instead of the goto, just write "break;" it'll break out of the loop and begin the next one.

2016-09-13 18:12:12	mthowe	_Raiz: The linux man pages are generally very good about listing what standards each function conforms to. So, even if you're not on Linux, you can still find them online.
2016-09-13 18:12:18	_Raiz	one thing I learned here is I have to read the manpage carefully
2016-09-13 18:12:33	Moto-chan	C++ (don't kill me for mentioning it) has a networking ts in progress iirc, perhaps it may lead to C getting some standard networking aswell. No idea though.
2016-09-13 18:13:14	mthowe	You can also find the POSIX documentation, but that's not quite as user friendly IMO.

2016-09-14 08:50:26	Manis	Hi. I'm trying to read a line from stdin into a buffer that automatically resizes. I have written a Loop that uses fgets to read chars into a buffer and if the buffer runs full, I realloc a bigger one and fgets again. It was working (the realloc), but now whenever I call malloc/calloc/realloc, I get a pointer but sizeof(__ptr) is still 4.
2016-09-14 08:50:52	Stragus	bball: You can use offsetof(), although that'll break if you reorder members of the struct
2016-09-14 08:51:17	atk	Manis: you can't determine the size that a buffer points to.
2016-09-14 08:51:27	atk	Manis: you must know it
2016-09-14 08:51:28	bball	Stragus: ah, I think that is OK
2016-09-14 08:51:33	atk	since you called malloc/realloc, you do know it
2016-09-14 08:51:46	Stragus	Manis: sizeof can't know the size of whatever the pointer points to, it gives you the size of the pointer
2016-09-14 08:52:04	Stragus	So yes, as atk said, it's your job to track the size of the buffer
2016-09-14 08:52:10	bball	so something like offsetof(foo, bar) + sizeof(bar), or offsetof(foo, y) + sizeof(y)
2016-09-14 08:52:35	Stragus	Correct, bball
2016-09-14 08:52:38	Manis	atk, Makes sense actually. I think I've seen a code snippet that does this somewhere. :-/

2016-09-14 09:07:19	Stragus	Also, think fo a switch() like a jump table based on the some integer value, it wouldn't make sense to have multiple cases for the same values
2016-09-14 09:07:22	Manis	Just doing some exerices for university. The exercise is to read a line from stdin and do something with it. They suggest to use getchar() in a while loop because it will not return until the line is finished.

If it makes sense. Was getting errors earlier but it faded. Now I'm still not getting similarities (collisions) on my output.

2016-09-14 13:16:51	Kaslai	As is endianness, for that matter.
2016-09-14 13:17:02	ajf	sure
2016-09-14 13:17:21	Kaslai	I've gotten different results for bitfields between MSVC and GCC though
2016-09-14 13:17:51	ajf	oh, that's disconcerting
2016-09-14 13:18:19	Kaslai	If you absolutely need a bit at a given position on any platform, you need to do the bit shifting yourself and account for endianness, since most implementations will give you at least that much information.
2016-09-14 13:19:07	Kaslai	You can only really rely on bitfields if you tie yourself to a particular platform and implementation. There's also nothing preventing a compiler from changing bitfield layout between revisions of the implementation as well.
2016-09-14 13:20:24	Kaslai	Unless of course there's no need to know how it's laid out in memory, which then there's no issue. If you need to read or write bits in an implementation and platform independent way though, bitfields are not what you want.

2016-09-14 13:49:32	koollman_	Chris: why ?
2016-09-14 13:49:36	Kaslai	When I'm hiring for a junior dev position, the first "technical" question I ask is "Have you heard of fizzbuzz?" If their answer is "yes," then we proceed with the interview. If the answer is no, I ask them to do it. This accomplishes a few things.
2016-09-14 13:49:59	marchelzo	Chris: that's part of what makes it useful. because if they can't do it despite it being the most commonly-known question in the universe, you have confirmed that they are fucking retarded.
2016-09-14 13:50:07	Chris	koollman_: because if they succeed in writing fizzbuzz, you only know that they know how to write fizzbuzz. That might be one of the only programs they've written because they've seen it online and practiced.
2016-09-14 13:50:18	Kaslai	The primary thing is that it shows that the candidate is at least somewhat interested in programming culture, rather than someone who just didn't give a shit and got a hot degree.
2016-09-14 13:50:25	koollman_	Chris: the point is not to see if they succeed. it's to stop early if they fail
2016-09-14 13:50:28	Chris	Yes, it's good in the sense of eliminating (no false negatives), but it's not reliable (false positives)

2016-09-14 13:51:02	Kaslai	The secondary thing is that if they do know it, it provides room for a joke. If they don't, then I get to see them work through a very easy problem and can identify trouble spots almost immediately.

2016-09-14 14:41:46	Kaslai	So you have a limited pool of atoms to draw from to create the symbol which the codepoint is to represent

2016-09-14 14:46:14	Kaslai	Think of it this way: To ascribe meaning, there must be a concious being with perception of the connection between the number and the meaning which has been ascribed to it. That connection consumes atoms.
2016-09-14 14:46:17	atk	marchelzo: where would you store the table which says which codepoint maps to which codepoint name / description?

2016-09-14 14:47:27	atk	without such a table, the codepoints which are not ascribed a name / description / example image are meaningless.
2016-09-14 14:47:34	marchelzo	atk: but the meaning could be part of the codepoint's representation
2016-09-14 14:47:37	marchelzo	c172: hi
2016-09-14 14:47:43	atk	Then it's not a codepoint.
2016-09-14 14:47:51	marchelzo	i guess not
2016-09-14 14:47:51	atk	It's a file.
2016-09-14 14:48:03	marchelzo	what is the difference, really
2016-09-14 14:48:13	Kaslai	The point is that a codepoint is an indivisible unit to which meaning has been ascribed.
2016-09-14 14:48:19	ixor	my design is slimmer on materials
2016-09-14 14:48:25	ixor	and more flexible
2016-09-14 14:48:40	Kaslai	A file contains a collection of codepoints which collectively describe something more complex.
2016-09-14 14:48:51	ixor	so ext4 has 16T file limit
2016-09-14 14:48:55	atk	Well the difference is that codepoints are all numbers which are ascribed a meaning / reserved for future use, they come with a name, a description and an example image.
2016-09-14 14:48:58	ixor	I could use multiple sqlite files tho
2016-09-14 14:49:03	atk	They're meant for compression
2016-09-14 14:49:17	atk	So you don't have to store the bits used to represent the letter f in a bitmap every time you want to write f
2016-09-14 14:49:29	ixor	it seems you can use a platoon of sqlite databases
2016-09-14 14:49:42	marchelzo	the observable universe is constantly growing, so by 2050 maybe we'll have enough atoms
2016-09-14 14:49:43	ixor	and weave together an app

2016-09-14 14:50:17	Kaslai	The ultimate point is that a codepoint has no meaning in and of itself. Meaning must be ascribed, and that information which links the codepoint to a meaning must be stored somewhere.
2016-09-14 14:50:39	atk	There will be a time when the universe is stretching faster than any light from anything can reach us (many many years in the future))

2016-09-14 14:56:31	Kaslai	tl;dr: Codepoints will never be 1GB. I think that even if we found millions of disparate alien civilizations, we might cap out around 16 bytes per codepoint.
2016-09-14 14:56:32	marchelzo	c172: the condition for your for loop is 'j < nt - 1', but you increment both j and nt each iteration. so 'j < nt - 1' is essentially a constant

2016-09-14 17:55:26	Akahige	Far easier, it's perfectly possible in C or C++. But much easier in Python.

2016-09-15 05:39:27	@candide	There is no need to cast the result of library functions that return void *; it makes your code hard to read, adds no value, and can hide a bug if you don't have a valid prototype in scope. See http://c-faq.com/malloc/mallocnocast.html
2016-09-15 05:39:47	marchelzo	c170: you want one hash table. M. given a sequence (which is a string) s, M[s] yields an array A of 30 ints. A[i] is the number of times the sequence s occurs in file number i.

2016-09-15 05:55:44	damien__	the nice thing about calloc is that since the kernel alocates it to 0, it's still virtual mem until you actually use it. So if 0 is the right value, then calloc is good. whereas if you malloc and memset or loop and instantialize the data it will not be virt mem anymore and increases your footprint. Has advantages and disadvantages I think

2016-09-15 06:11:59	cousteau	if you have different types, but the collections always have the same set of elements of the same types, then a struct could do

2016-09-15 07:24:22	TrevorDaSorte	yes, I've been told about Knuth also, programming Tex in the paper
2016-09-15 07:24:52	Kaslai	ed and cc are all you need, right?

2016-09-15 07:28:01	twkm	merely bad programming, which due to the far larger number of programmers ...
2016-09-15 07:28:03	dogbert2	I use vi/vim on a regular basis...
2016-09-15 07:28:10	Kaslai	There's zero reason to use such archaic methods these days.
2016-09-15 07:28:24	dogbert2	twkm, exactly...the one thing that galls me today is the lack of ****ing comments in code
2016-09-15 07:28:55	dogbert2	Kaslai, the command line will always work when X11+Desktop Environment is kaput

2016-09-15 07:30:00	Kaslai	dogbert2: X11 is lame. The distinction is between basically hand-assembling code you wrote on paper onto punch cards versus using vim/emacs, screen/tmux, git, etc

2016-09-15 07:30:57	twkm	today many tend to compose, throwing junk at the compiler until it stop complaining, rather than being careful because it was going to take minutes or worse to attempt a compilation.

2016-09-15 12:34:00	fizzie	You're not assigning anything (it's an initializer), and it's not *in* main, it's outside of it.
2016-09-15 12:34:12	fizzie	The standard has a fairly restrictive list (C11 6.6p7-9) of what can be used in an initializer that requires a constant expression, which initializers of objects of static storage duration do (6.7.9p4), and the declaration of d at file scope makes it one of those (6.2.2p5, 6.2.4p3).

2016-09-15 18:04:52	c170	So I would have while (token2 != NULL) then another while.. After that one done. can't I just have a break after that bracket so if it is = group_length then it'll just break? But at the same time I want it to keep starting over once it hits that tho right? so it isn't just one sequence recorded?
2016-09-15 18:04:57	c170	That is a good idea doppel

2016-10-01 21:03:19	joe9	I am trying to replace an existing C library that has defined the "struct opaque_data_type;" in it's public header.
2016-10-01 21:03:50	joe9	In my library, I do not have much need for that data structure. I just need that data structure to hold a reference to another data structure.
2016-10-01 21:04:57	joe9	so, from "struct opaque_data_type {field1,..}" ==> "struct opaque_data_type {void;}"(not sure if I can have a field of void).

2016-10-01 21:05:22	Maxdamantus	You can't have a field of type void.

2016-10-01 21:05:45	Maxdamantus	The closest you'll get is having a struct with a char in it.
2016-10-01 21:06:12	joe9	Maxdamantus: oh, ok. so, I would have to define "struct opaque_data_type {void * state;}" for just that 1 field, correct?
2016-10-01 21:06:27	Maxdamantus	It'd be nice if C had used a real unit type instead of a pseudo-void pseudo-unit type.
2016-10-01 21:06:40	joe9	Maxdamantus: I was hoping there would be a way to typedef the struct to be a void * .

2016-10-01 21:17:14	Maxdamantus	The point of the calloc or the compound literal is to initialise all elements of the struct to their respective zero values.
2016-10-01 21:17:24	Maxdamantus	Though calloc doesn't do that, and you only have one field now anyway.

2016-10-03 00:28:39		[00:28]
2016-10-03 00:29:13	mar77i	12 only works on some architectures.
2016-10-03 00:29:43	nHeck	12 for what?
2016-10-03 00:30:00	mar77i	block_size
2016-10-03 00:30:16	nHeck	ofc it does, if size_of (int) == 4 like on ideone
2016-10-03 00:30:31	nHeck	12%4 indeed = 0
2016-10-03 00:31:04	mar77i	sigh
2016-10-03 00:31:09	nHeck	what sigh?
2016-10-03 00:31:47	mar77i	I don't understand the problem.
2016-10-03 00:32:05	nHeck	the problem was that my recycler worked on ideone but not on the laptop i use

2016-10-03 00:32:21	nHeck	and it was due to a test failing where i try to check if blocksize is a multiple of sizeof sizet
2016-10-03 00:32:33	nHeck	because on some computers, an int is 4 byte, and on iother its 8
2016-10-03 00:32:36	nHeck	i just forgot that
2016-10-03 00:32:42	nHeck	problem solved, i figured it out ^'
2016-10-03 00:33:40	mar77i	move malloc() on line 15 to 28 and save two conditional calls to free().
2016-10-03 00:34:52	mar77i	also, I kind of got used to creating an immediate object in the caller instead of malloc'ing it in a _create function. but that's a matter of personal taste, I guess.
2016-10-03 00:34:59	nHeck	oh yeah, thanks ^^
2016-10-03 00:35:06	nHeck	was anoyed of that splitting just cause of 80cols

2016-10-03 00:37:09	nHeck	mar77i: I got what you said, I think i'd rather do that too, it's just that it was a school assignment and I tried to do the func as they wanted, but i'd reuse it differently for sure, when it'll work for less implistic cases^

2016-10-03 00:43:29	fievel	long time I didn't have written an API, could you tell what the best practice is for handling error within a function returning an int: returning the useful value as return value and giving the error code as a parameter of the function or the opposite (return an error code and assign the return value to a parameter) ?

2016-10-03 01:00:27		[01:00]
2016-10-03 01:00:29	mar77i	fievel: that's a matter of personal taste. as the return value itself is only one value and data you want to read or write may be multiple things, returning an error indicator and writing to argument pointers is another common pattern. usually you decide for one and stick with it.
2016-10-03 01:02:08	mar77i	with the above reasoning, I'm obviously more of an data-through-arguments/error-through-return-value guy.
2016-10-03 01:03:44	fievel	yes I think this is perhaps the best solution, because I have some other function which will have no arguments and only return error code, so if all functions of the API have errors return code it will be more coherent

2016-10-05 21:49:55	mthowe	Personally, I do not like this practice of "one header file to include them all". It seems like bad form to me. I prefer to just include specifically what I know that I need.
2016-10-05 21:50:18	Xanather	I mean I am trying to do that

2016-10-05 21:51:03	mthowe	Then depending on the specifics, you need those headers to include what they need as appropriate, or you just need forward declarations.
2016-10-05 21:51:21	mthowe	There's nothing wrong with a header including another header if there are really things in there it depends on, of course.
2016-10-05 21:51:43	mthowe	But that's a bit different than having everyheader.h which just includes every header in the entire project. :)

2016-10-05 21:53:42	mthowe	No, there's nothing like that.
2016-10-05 21:54:14	Xanather	mthowe, I read that the best technique is to include header files in a .c file even if the used symbols we're pulled in before hand by a included .h file which includes other .h files. The problem is I have a hard time determining if I have missed something which was pulled in by something else.

2016-10-05 21:56:06	mthowe	Xanather: It depends. If I have header A which depends on and includes header B, but my .c is not using anything from header B, to me it makes no sense to still include it. If I AM using things from header B, even though it's already included by header A, I will usually include it in the .c just for sake of self-documenting.

2016-10-05 23:04:35	dminuoso	soulisson: Brilliant, I just asked and found the answer in n1570 myself already.
