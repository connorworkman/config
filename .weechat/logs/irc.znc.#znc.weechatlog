2016-09-18 00:44:13	Zarthus	I don't think you can, pretty sure providers manually edit the source code for that
2016-09-18 00:44:26	Zarthus	other than the good old asking them "please don't edit your networks"
2016-09-18 00:45:06	Zarthus	I don't think ZNC was designed with much of the idea of letting strangers on your bouncer, permissions are lacking in that regard.
2016-09-18 00:45:16	nextloop	does znc bind to it's default port for outgoing connections? Zarthus

2016-09-18 00:45:56	nextloop	okay. so i can limit it on a firewall basis maybe
2016-09-18 00:46:03	Zarthus	well if they trust you to host their bouncer they trust you with their entire IRC career :)

2016-09-18 00:46:53	Zarthus	it doesn't always apply in the real world because people are stupid, but theoretically speaking you guys have a strong enough bond to let politely asking be sufficient
2016-09-18 00:48:08	Uber	Just setup the User/Network for them and don't tell them the IP:Port of the webadmin.
2016-09-18 00:48:19	Zarthus	Uber: that doesn't work. And why would you?
2016-09-18 00:48:37	Uber	Why would you what?
2016-09-18 00:48:48	Zarthus	why would you not tell them about the webadmin
2016-09-18 00:48:54	Uber	Why would they need it?
2016-09-18 00:48:58	Zarthus	it's one of the more userfriendly features for configuring ZNC
2016-09-18 00:49:17	Uber	Once they connect via client they don't need to configure anything thing else
2016-09-18 00:49:45	Zarthus	it'd be better to disable the webadmin entirely if you follow that philosophy
2016-09-18 00:49:53	Zarthus	nothing prevents you from running /znc addservr, delserver
2016-09-18 00:50:05	Zarthus	hiding the webadmin does nothing
2016-09-18 00:50:17	Uber	unless you set the Max network to 1
2016-09-18 00:50:41	Zarthus	yeah, but what stops them from editing the existing networ
2016-09-18 00:50:44	Uber	They could then change the network
2016-09-18 00:50:56	Uber	but still would be only be limited to 1 at a time
2016-09-18 00:51:01	Zarthus	if you don't trust them not to mess with the settings, I just wouldn't provide them with a bouncer.
2016-09-18 00:51:48	Uber	Guess that would be a matter of opinion
2016-09-18 00:52:07	Uber	If you want to provide a bouncer service at a limited capacity
2016-09-18 00:52:13	Lartza	My friends don't touch their settings if I tell them to
2016-09-18 00:52:18	Lartza	Otherwise they'd get the boot
2016-09-18 00:52:35	Zarthus	I think if you let people on your bouncer you don't trust on an unmodified ZNC you're making a mistake.

2016-09-18 01:12:57	Zarthus	I assumed that because I assumed you knew your own username.
2016-09-18 01:13:03	Andrio	If it's only a wrong password, you'd get a PM saying so.
2016-09-18 01:14:12	Uber	Zarthus I mean you can enter anything in the box User "Sugar" Pass "Bean" and it will always return the output "Invlid Login" because there is not output
2016-09-18 01:15:26	Zarthus	yes
2016-09-18 01:15:27	Uber	no other output*
2016-09-18 01:15:32	Zarthus	but is it so wrong for me to think you know what you're doing

2016-09-18 01:20:59	Filiaes	but what's the problem to unload webadmin and controlpanel ... a user wont be able to configure the bot anymore, or?
2016-09-18 01:22:23	Filiaes	if there is really a need to get a non trusted user access for the bot i would handle it in that way
2016-09-18 01:23:17	Filiaes	then chroot the bot and run it exclusivly for non trusted user
2016-09-18 01:23:53	Filiaes	exclusively*

2016-09-18 09:13:52	Zarthus	[11:01:19] on 1.6.x and 1.7 [11:01:19]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:01:31] 1.6.3 [11:01:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	@Mikaela	[11:01:34] Username should also be case sensitive [11:01:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	@Mikaela	[11:02:02] Normal users can login into webadmin AFAIK and do for me [11:02:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Andrio	[11:02:06] Mine can. [11:02:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:02:17] maybe mine is just broken [11:02:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Zarthus	[11:02:28] I think its PEBCAK [11:02:28]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:02:39] PEBCAK ? [11:02:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Zarthus	[11:02:46] An user error. [11:02:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:02:46] English only, sorry [11:02:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	@Mikaela	[11:04:06] Problem Error(?) Between Chair And Keyboard [11:04:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Zarthus	[11:04:11] exists [11:04:11]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	@Mikaela	[11:04:23] Thanks [11:04:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:04:43] Well Guess it would be between Chrome and LastPass [11:04:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Zarthus	[11:05:32] no, PEBCAK explicitly indicates it is not a hardware nor a software problem. [11:05:32]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:06:21] Well then I guess your thought would be incorrect since I'm not entering the data into the input boxd [11:06:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:06:23] box. [11:06:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Zarthus	[11:07:05] I'll not continue this discussion. [11:07:05]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Andrio	[11:07:18] Can you log in via IRC with that password? [11:07:18]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	mB-PiBox	[11:07:47] I'm logged in now with it [11:07:47]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Andrio	[11:07:58] Uber, can you log in via IRC with that password? [11:07:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	mB-PiBox	[11:08:17] I answered you Andrio [11:08:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Andrio	[11:08:23] mm [11:08:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Uber	[11:09:27] Well I'm not worried if the user(s) can log in or not. Wasn't my question/issue. [11:09:27]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Uber	[11:12:20] and Zarthus to make the assumption that the password is entered incorrectly because it says "Invalid Login" is not accurate; as there is not alternative output coded such as "user doesn't exist [11:12:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Andrio	[11:12:38] Hm [11:12:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Andrio	[11:12:49] Are you currently connected to IRC with the same account on the same ZNC? [11:12:49]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Zarthus	[11:12:57] I assumed that because I assumed you knew your own username. [11:12:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Andrio	[11:13:03] If it's only a wrong password, you'd get a PM saying so. [11:13:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Uber	[11:14:12] Zarthus I mean you can enter anything in the box User "Sugar" Pass "Bean" and it will always return the output "Invlid Login" because there is not output [11:14:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Zarthus	[11:15:26] yes [11:15:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Uber	[11:15:27] no other output* [11:15:27]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Zarthus	[11:15:32] but is it so wrong for me to think you know what you're doing [11:15:32]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Filiaes	[11:20:59] but what's the problem to unload webadmin and controlpanel ... a user wont be able to configure the bot anymore, or? [11:20:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Filiaes	[11:22:23] if there is really a need to get a non trusted user access for the bot i would handle it in that way [11:22:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Filiaes	[11:23:17] then chroot the bot and run it exclusivly for non trusted user [11:23:17]

2016-09-18 09:13:53	thinkpad	[11:33:47] why are there global and user settings with seemingly the same options? [11:33:47]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	knolle	[11:45:00] because you might want global defaults and still give users the ability to change them [11:45:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	_MaDaLiN_	[13:03:23] awaynick on detach? Has znc this ? [13:03:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	JeDa	[13:08:05] _MaDaLiN_: that's been removed since 1.4 [13:08:05]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	JeDa	[13:08:41] you could get it from GitHub and compile/install it yourself though [13:08:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	JeDa	[13:09:04] but it isn't supported by ZNC developers (nor half people in this net probably) [13:09:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	_MaDaLiN_	[13:10:33] Ok i compiled the module .. i got .so file moves it to modules dir but when i use /znc loadmodule i still get that message that awaynick is retired from this version [13:10:33]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	_MaDaLiN_	[13:10:38] How can i get rid of that [13:10:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	hx0requiem	[13:24:49] Hello [13:24:49]

2016-09-18 09:13:53	MetaNova	[13:29:01] _MaDaLiN_: we don't encourage or condone the use of that module [13:29:01]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Jay2k1	[13:44:15] sarek: that, or patch it yourself if you can, or don't use the module ;) [13:44:15]

2016-09-18 13:24:38	Zarthus	[11:04:11] exists [11:04:11]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@Mikaela	[11:04:23] Thanks [11:04:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:04:43] Well Guess it would be between Chrome and LastPass [11:04:43]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Zarthus	[11:05:32] no, PEBCAK explicitly indicates it is not a hardware nor a software problem. [11:05:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:06:21] Well then I guess your thought would be incorrect since I'm not entering the data into the input boxd [11:06:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:06:23] box. [11:06:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Zarthus	[11:07:05] I'll not continue this discussion. [11:07:05]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Andrio	[11:07:18] Can you log in via IRC with that password? [11:07:18]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	mB-PiBox	[11:07:47] I'm logged in now with it [11:07:47]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Andrio	[11:07:58] Uber, can you log in via IRC with that password? [11:07:58]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	mB-PiBox	[11:08:17] I answered you Andrio [11:08:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Andrio	[11:08:23] mm [11:08:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:09:27] Well I'm not worried if the user(s) can log in or not. Wasn't my question/issue. [11:09:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:12:20] and Zarthus to make the assumption that the password is entered incorrectly because it says "Invalid Login" is not accurate; as there is not alternative output coded such as "user doesn't exist [11:12:20]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Andrio	[11:12:38] Hm [11:12:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Andrio	[11:12:49] Are you currently connected to IRC with the same account on the same ZNC? [11:12:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Zarthus	[11:12:57] I assumed that because I assumed you knew your own username. [11:12:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Andrio	[11:13:03] If it's only a wrong password, you'd get a PM saying so. [11:13:03]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:14:12] Zarthus I mean you can enter anything in the box User "Sugar" Pass "Bean" and it will always return the output "Invlid Login" because there is not output [11:14:12]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Zarthus	[11:15:26] yes [11:15:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:15:27] no other output* [11:15:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Zarthus	[11:15:32] but is it so wrong for me to think you know what you're doing [11:15:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Filiaes	[11:20:59] but what's the problem to unload webadmin and controlpanel ... a user wont be able to configure the bot anymore, or? [11:20:59]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Filiaes	[11:22:23] if there is really a need to get a non trusted user access for the bot i would handle it in that way [11:22:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Filiaes	[11:23:17] then chroot the bot and run it exclusivly for non trusted user [11:23:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Filiaes	[11:23:53] exclusively* [11:23:53]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	thinkpad	[11:33:47] why are there global and user settings with seemingly the same options? [11:33:47]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	knolle	[11:45:00] because you might want global defaults and still give users the ability to change them [11:45:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_MaDaLiN_	[13:03:23] awaynick on detach? Has znc this ? [13:03:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	JeDa	[13:08:05] _MaDaLiN_: that's been removed since 1.4 [13:08:05]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	JeDa	[13:08:41] you could get it from GitHub and compile/install it yourself though [13:08:41]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	JeDa	[13:09:04] but it isn't supported by ZNC developers (nor half people in this net probably) [13:09:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_MaDaLiN_	[13:10:33] Ok i compiled the module .. i got .so file moves it to modules dir but when i use /znc loadmodule i still get that message that awaynick is retired from this version [13:10:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_MaDaLiN_	[13:10:38] How can i get rid of that [13:10:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	hx0requiem	[13:24:49] Hello [13:24:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Cthulhux	[13:27:04] hi [13:27:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	MetaNova	[13:29:01] _MaDaLiN_: we don't encourage or condone the use of that module [13:29:01]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Jay2k1	[13:44:15] sarek: that, or patch it yourself if you can, or don't use the module ;) [13:44:15]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	KindOne	[20:03:59] Good news everyone! freenode now supports SASL EXTERNAL! [20:03:59]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@kerio	[20:04:38] we did it \o/ [20:04:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	vectr0n	[20:04:49] haven't they for awhile now? o0 [20:04:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@kerio	[20:04:50] honestly *cert needs a way to generate a cert [20:04:50]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@kerio	[20:04:53] vectr0n: nope [20:04:53]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@kerio	[20:05:06] only recently, with the readdition of the tor hidden service [20:05:06]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	vectr0n	[20:05:41] just thought they had, my mistake :) [20:05:41]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@kerio	[20:05:49] they had certfp for a long while [20:05:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	vectr0n	[20:05:59] aha thats what i am thinking of, lol [20:05:59]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@kerio	[20:06:15] but it was the somewhat disappointing implementation that causes nickserv to yell at you and then go "yep ty for telling me your password" immediately [20:06:15]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	vectr0n	[20:07:09] it's been so long since ive had to add anything to znc so networks melt together at times, lol [20:07:09]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	KindOne	[20:08:15] Now to do sasl external by telnet! [20:08:15]

2016-09-18 14:41:19	juggs	ezio, in your irc client (connected to your znc instance) if you enter /znc do you get a response from *status ?
2016-09-18 14:41:41	ezio	yup
2016-09-18 14:42:04	ezio	i just made some changes to stickychan
2016-09-18 14:42:08	ezio	but i've made them before
2016-09-18 14:42:40	juggs	then in that *status dialog enter    SaveConfig
2016-09-18 14:43:12	juggs	You should get a response like...   Wrote config to [/home/znc/.znc/configs/znc.conf]

2016-09-18 15:51:40	Uber	kinda an of-the-wall example though
2016-09-18 15:52:01	MetaNova	well now that the freenode tor hidden service is enabled again
2016-09-18 15:52:12	MetaNova	perhaps that particular article could use a makeover
2016-09-18 15:52:38	Uber	Perhaps.
2016-09-18 15:52:48	MetaNova	the difficulty with that is that it's not a clean example, given the need for SASL EXTERNAL
2016-09-18 15:53:25	Uber	yeah, it's kinda missing a big step.

2016-09-18 15:56:32	MetaNova	a writeup on how to connect ZNC to freenode using tor/sasl-external would prove useful, though

2016-09-18 15:57:42	Uber	It would.. and would save a lot of Q&A here
2016-09-18 15:58:04	MetaNova	should really get ahead of the curve on that
2016-09-18 15:58:32	MetaNova	I'd have to walk through it myself before feeling comfortable even answering questions about it, let alone writing it up
2016-09-18 15:58:48	MetaNova	maybe that'll be my project on my next day off from work
2016-09-18 15:59:11	Uber	Yeah, that's kinda what I'm doing right now... It's been a while since I messed with tor
2016-09-18 15:59:36	Uber	so I'm wiping an old RPi, to do a fresh install of ZNC/Tor
2016-09-18 15:59:48	MetaNova	good for you!
2016-09-18 15:59:56	Rockwolf	Is connecting through tor really necessary for IRC?
2016-09-18 16:00:11	MetaNova	Rockwolf: in very few cases it is
2016-09-18 16:00:20	MetaNova	example: an irc server only being available via Tor
2016-09-18 16:00:40	MetaNova	or, for people in countries with extraordinary internet filtering in place, Tor is the only way to access most of the internet

2016-09-18 16:00:59	MetaNova	so, it's not unheard of, but it's not often required
2016-09-18 16:01:35	Rockwolf	I see
2016-09-18 16:01:37	MetaNova	some people feel naked connecting without it, though
2016-09-18 16:02:05	Rockwolf	Why?
2016-09-18 16:02:25	MetaNova	paranoia, or perhaps even legitimate privacy concerns
2016-09-18 16:02:43	Rockwolf	I suppose.
2016-09-18 16:02:54	MetaNova	I've read about reporters not feeling comfortable using internet services without tor due to fears of them being specific monitoring targets
2016-09-18 16:03:22	Rockwolf	So connect through a vpn
2016-09-18 16:04:05	MetaNova	a VPN would still be able to track down to a person, if the entity doing the monitoring has enough leverage with the provider to make them disclose customer information
2016-09-18 16:04:21	MetaNova	part of the appeal of tor is the lack of user records like that
2016-09-18 16:04:26	MetaNova	as I understand it
2016-09-18 16:04:36	Uber	I'm gonna install tor and get stuck on the NSA/CIA watch list :|
2016-09-18 16:05:00	MetaNova	meh, I already assume I'm there
2016-09-18 16:05:08	Uber	lol
2016-09-18 16:05:22	Rockwolf	Be careful when a pizza van is parked outside you house for days on end
2016-09-18 16:05:25	Uber	ZNC still doesn't support SOCKS correct?

2016-09-18 22:36:27	Uber	http://www.howtogeek.com/265994/how-to-sync-android-notifications-to-your-windows-10-pc/
2016-09-18 22:36:40	Uber	but I look at my phone more than my computer so...
2016-09-18 22:37:42	Uber	I just use the notification sync -- and turn the other crap from the Cortana app off
2016-09-18 22:37:59	Lartza	I don't have a problem picking up my computer
2016-09-18 22:38:06	Lartza	The notifications are just delayed on the phone
2016-09-18 22:38:30	Uber	Oh sorry, misunderstood your issue.
2016-09-18 22:38:55	Uber	What kinda Android phone?
2016-09-18 22:41:59	Lartza	It's Android doze causing it I'm pretty sure
2016-09-18 22:44:20	Uber	idk, not familiar with Android. I have a Note 5, but only for work.
2016-09-18 22:44:36	Uber	Personal Phone is iPhone 6S+
2016-09-18 22:45:43	Uber	and I use pushover for sending notification from.. everything
2016-09-18 22:45:43		[22:45]
2016-09-18 22:46:22	Lartza	It goes to a sleep state when left alone and only lets important notifications to come through
2016-09-18 22:46:23	Lartza	saves battery
2016-09-18 22:46:37	Lartza	It's not a huge delay like 5 minutes but still
2016-09-18 22:46:48	Uber	No way of setting a certain app as "important"
2016-09-18 22:46:54	Uber	or does the Doze make the choice
2016-09-18 22:51:47	TorZNC	MetaNova .. We Have Achieved Success! Connected.
2016-09-18 22:51:51	Lartza	Maybe if I make znc-push send the notifications of irc as higher level I dunno
2016-09-18 22:51:55	Lartza	Need to look into it :)
2016-09-18 22:52:47	Uber	I don't see anything on my Note5 called Doze; App Manager > System Apps
2016-09-18 22:53:06	Uber	Maybe Samsung took it out, since they use their own power/battery manager.
2016-09-18 22:54:29	Uber	Do you not use a IRC client on your mobile that has notifications?
2016-09-18 22:57:35	Lartza	Android 6+ only
2016-09-18 22:58:08	Lartza	And no not always
2016-09-18 22:58:14	Lartza	I can open it up when ZNC notificates me :)
2016-09-18 22:59:47	Uber	Well it's Android 6.0.1, but still different battery manager.
2016-09-18 23:00:53	Lartza	I am not sure you can even configure doze so
2016-09-18 23:00:53		[23:00]
2016-09-18 23:01:48	Uber	I have "IRC for Android" installed on the Note5, and never had issue with notifications.
2016-09-18 23:05:05	Lartza	I get push notifications from ZNC
2016-09-18 23:05:19	Lartza	IRC for Android is running constantly it would have no issue with doze
2016-09-18 23:06:00	Uber	assumed so; just though using a client might be more reliable.
2016-09-18 23:06:07	Uber	thought*
2016-09-18 23:06:50	Uber	I use PUSH also, but only for my iPhone, since I don't really care about getting notifications on the Note5.

2016-09-19 02:44:08	MetaNova	[03:20:54] which, I don't blame you if you don't [03:20:54]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[03:21:53] I just get it from git. [03:21:53]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	MetaNova	[03:22:02] great [03:22:02]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[03:25:02] when is 1.7 expected to be "stable" [03:25:02]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	zoid	[03:30:41] Anyone here use ZNC Push with Pushjet? [03:30:41]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[03:46:37] ..waits while make takes hours to complete :| [03:46:37]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[07:41:30] Ugh, what do people use for push notifications now that pushbullet is crap? [07:41:30]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[07:41:42] notify my android has gone down and is buggy [07:41:42]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[07:42:50] Or my phone is doing something weird but NMA notifications are slow to arrive [07:42:50]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[07:43:51] Oh actually it's probably Android's doze... [07:43:51]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:32:22] Lartza, do you use Windows 10? [08:32:22]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[08:33:55] Yeah [08:33:55]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:36:26] Probably not the most 100% efficient [08:36:26]

2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:36:40] but I look at my phone more than my computer so... [08:36:40]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:37:42] I just use the notification sync -- and turn the other crap from the Cortana app off [08:37:42]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[08:37:59] I don't have a problem picking up my computer [08:37:59]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[08:38:06] The notifications are just delayed on the phone [08:38:06]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:38:30] Oh sorry, misunderstood your issue. [08:38:30]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:38:55] What kinda Android phone? [08:38:55]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[08:41:59] It's Android doze causing it I'm pretty sure [08:41:59]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:44:20] idk, not familiar with Android. I have a Note 5, but only for work. [08:44:20]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:44:36] Personal Phone is iPhone 6S+ [08:44:36]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:45:43] and I use pushover for sending notification from.. everything [08:45:43]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[08:46:22] It goes to a sleep state when left alone and only lets important notifications to come through [08:46:22]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[08:46:23] saves battery [08:46:23]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[08:46:37] It's not a huge delay like 5 minutes but still [08:46:37]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:46:48] No way of setting a certain app as "important" [08:46:48]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:46:54] or does the Doze make the choice [08:46:54]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	TorZNC	[08:51:47] MetaNova .. We Have Achieved Success! Connected. [08:51:47]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[08:51:51] Maybe if I make znc-push send the notifications of irc as higher level I dunno [08:51:51]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[08:51:55] Need to look into it :) [08:51:55]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:52:47] I don't see anything on my Note5 called Doze; App Manager > System Apps [08:52:47]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Uber	[08:53:05] Maybe Samsung took it out, since they use their own power/battery manager. [08:53:05]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Uber	[08:54:29] Do you not use a IRC client on your mobile that has notifications? [08:54:29]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Lartza	[08:57:35] Android 6+ only [08:57:35]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Lartza	[08:58:07] And no not always [08:58:07]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Lartza	[08:58:14] I can open it up when ZNC notificates me :) [08:58:14]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Uber	[08:59:47] Well it's Android 6.0.1, but still different battery manager. [08:59:47]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Lartza	[09:00:53] I am not sure you can even configure doze so [09:00:53]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Uber	[09:01:48] I have "IRC for Android" installed on the Note5, and never had issue with notifications. [09:01:48]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Lartza	[09:05:05] I get push notifications from ZNC [09:05:05]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Lartza	[09:05:19] IRC for Android is running constantly it would have no issue with doze [09:05:19]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Uber	[09:06:00] assumed so; just though using a client might be more reliable. [09:06:00]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Uber	[09:06:07] thought* [09:06:07]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Uber	[09:06:50] I use PUSH also, but only for my iPhone, since I don't really care about getting notifications on the Note5. [09:06:50]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Uber	[09:08:08] I could use Prowl but since I already have Pushover, didn't see the need [09:08:08]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Uber	[09:08:51] in conjunction with I meant [09:08:51]

2016-09-19 12:53:03	TimBlo	i use the ip directly? this isnt a problem, is it? i set the CN like in the tutorial above

2016-09-19 12:55:15	Lartza	And the exact error is that the common name is invalid?
2016-09-19 12:57:01	TimBlo	could i track it this specifically? the error report is in german, so copy paste may not be helpful
2016-09-19 12:57:46	Lartza	You can change hexchat to english from the settings
2016-09-19 12:57:46		[12:57]
2016-09-19 12:59:10	TimBlo	hexchat does not provide a detailed error but asks if it`s self signed (which would not matter because i installed the rootCA on this computer)
2016-09-19 12:59:24	TimBlo	i get this in Chrome There are issues with the site's certificate chain (net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID).
2016-09-19 13:04:13	Lartza	Then that's not a ZNC bug but a problem with your cert setup
2016-09-19 13:04:55	Lartza	Chrome + Windows should work when you install the root cert to Windows

2016-09-19 13:10:56	TimBlo	maybe i made an error when creating it in frist place, the public keys do not match their sizes. this i a bit offtopic, but could this be causing the problem?
2016-09-19 13:16:00		[13:10]
2016-09-19 13:17:22	TimBlo	or other question. why are there that many tabs in the cert management window? it´s kind of confusing
2016-09-19 13:18:19	Lartza	In certlm?
2016-09-19 13:18:39	Lartza	Why even do this and not just accept invalid?
2016-09-19 13:22:00	TimBlo	i did accept invalids atm.
2016-09-19 13:22:29	Lartza	Yeah why even bother with root
2016-09-19 13:22:39	Lartza	Just accept self-signed
2016-09-19 13:23:17	TimBlo	but it seems like i installed it as intermediate authority. why the heck did i just do this?

2016-09-19 13:28:08	TimBlo	ok. i had to explicitly tell it to store it as root authority. it works! yeay! :D
2016-09-19 13:28:37	TimBlo	Thanks Lartza :)
2016-09-19 13:28:56	Lartza	Because having any old certificate in your root cert is insecure it probably does intermediate by default
2016-09-19 13:29:47	TimBlo	it is valid until 2022, what does old mean? :)
2016-09-19 13:30:18	MetaNova	'any old certificate' == 'any random certificate'
2016-09-19 13:30:27	MetaNova	as far as this context goes
2016-09-19 13:31:01	TimBlo	yep, think youre right :)

2016-09-19 17:56:06	arooni	hey folks; seeing Disconnected from IRC (Can't resolve server hostname). Reconnecting... ... how can i see which specific efnet server weechat is trying to connect to?
2016-09-19 17:56:24	arooni	it's connecting to one of the ones i set up via znc
2016-09-19 17:57:47	MetaNova	you can do '/msg *status listservers' and the one with '*' next to it is the one it's trying at that moment
2016-09-19 17:57:59	MetaNova	meaning the previous one is the one which it can't resolve
2016-09-19 17:58:20	MetaNova	you should always check http://www.efnet.org/?module=servers for which server addresses are valid
