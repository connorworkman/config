2016-09-18 00:44:13	Zarthus	I don't think you can, pretty sure providers manually edit the source code for that
2016-09-18 00:44:26	Zarthus	other than the good old asking them "please don't edit your networks"
2016-09-18 00:45:06	Zarthus	I don't think ZNC was designed with much of the idea of letting strangers on your bouncer, permissions are lacking in that regard.
2016-09-18 00:45:16	nextloop	does znc bind to it's default port for outgoing connections? Zarthus

2016-09-18 00:45:56	nextloop	okay. so i can limit it on a firewall basis maybe
2016-09-18 00:46:03	Zarthus	well if they trust you to host their bouncer they trust you with their entire IRC career :)

2016-09-18 00:46:53	Zarthus	it doesn't always apply in the real world because people are stupid, but theoretically speaking you guys have a strong enough bond to let politely asking be sufficient
2016-09-18 00:48:08	Uber	Just setup the User/Network for them and don't tell them the IP:Port of the webadmin.
2016-09-18 00:48:19	Zarthus	Uber: that doesn't work. And why would you?
2016-09-18 00:48:37	Uber	Why would you what?
2016-09-18 00:48:48	Zarthus	why would you not tell them about the webadmin
2016-09-18 00:48:54	Uber	Why would they need it?
2016-09-18 00:48:58	Zarthus	it's one of the more userfriendly features for configuring ZNC
2016-09-18 00:49:17	Uber	Once they connect via client they don't need to configure anything thing else
2016-09-18 00:49:45	Zarthus	it'd be better to disable the webadmin entirely if you follow that philosophy
2016-09-18 00:49:53	Zarthus	nothing prevents you from running /znc addservr, delserver
2016-09-18 00:50:05	Zarthus	hiding the webadmin does nothing
2016-09-18 00:50:17	Uber	unless you set the Max network to 1
2016-09-18 00:50:41	Zarthus	yeah, but what stops them from editing the existing networ
2016-09-18 00:50:44	Uber	They could then change the network
2016-09-18 00:50:56	Uber	but still would be only be limited to 1 at a time
2016-09-18 00:51:01	Zarthus	if you don't trust them not to mess with the settings, I just wouldn't provide them with a bouncer.
2016-09-18 00:51:48	Uber	Guess that would be a matter of opinion
2016-09-18 00:52:07	Uber	If you want to provide a bouncer service at a limited capacity
2016-09-18 00:52:13	Lartza	My friends don't touch their settings if I tell them to
2016-09-18 00:52:18	Lartza	Otherwise they'd get the boot
2016-09-18 00:52:35	Zarthus	I think if you let people on your bouncer you don't trust on an unmodified ZNC you're making a mistake.

2016-09-18 01:12:57	Zarthus	I assumed that because I assumed you knew your own username.
2016-09-18 01:13:03	Andrio	If it's only a wrong password, you'd get a PM saying so.
2016-09-18 01:14:12	Uber	Zarthus I mean you can enter anything in the box User "Sugar" Pass "Bean" and it will always return the output "Invlid Login" because there is not output
2016-09-18 01:15:26	Zarthus	yes
2016-09-18 01:15:27	Uber	no other output*
2016-09-18 01:15:32	Zarthus	but is it so wrong for me to think you know what you're doing

2016-09-18 01:20:59	Filiaes	but what's the problem to unload webadmin and controlpanel ... a user wont be able to configure the bot anymore, or?
2016-09-18 01:22:23	Filiaes	if there is really a need to get a non trusted user access for the bot i would handle it in that way
2016-09-18 01:23:17	Filiaes	then chroot the bot and run it exclusivly for non trusted user
2016-09-18 01:23:53	Filiaes	exclusively*

2016-09-18 09:13:52	Zarthus	[11:01:19] on 1.6.x and 1.7 [11:01:19]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:01:31] 1.6.3 [11:01:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	@Mikaela	[11:01:34] Username should also be case sensitive [11:01:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	@Mikaela	[11:02:02] Normal users can login into webadmin AFAIK and do for me [11:02:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Andrio	[11:02:06] Mine can. [11:02:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:02:17] maybe mine is just broken [11:02:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Zarthus	[11:02:28] I think its PEBCAK [11:02:28]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:02:39] PEBCAK ? [11:02:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Zarthus	[11:02:46] An user error. [11:02:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:02:46] English only, sorry [11:02:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	@Mikaela	[11:04:06] Problem Error(?) Between Chair And Keyboard [11:04:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Zarthus	[11:04:11] exists [11:04:11]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	@Mikaela	[11:04:23] Thanks [11:04:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:04:43] Well Guess it would be between Chrome and LastPass [11:04:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Zarthus	[11:05:32] no, PEBCAK explicitly indicates it is not a hardware nor a software problem. [11:05:32]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:06:21] Well then I guess your thought would be incorrect since I'm not entering the data into the input boxd [11:06:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:06:23] box. [11:06:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Zarthus	[11:07:05] I'll not continue this discussion. [11:07:05]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Andrio	[11:07:18] Can you log in via IRC with that password? [11:07:18]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	mB-PiBox	[11:07:47] I'm logged in now with it [11:07:47]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Andrio	[11:07:58] Uber, can you log in via IRC with that password? [11:07:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	mB-PiBox	[11:08:17] I answered you Andrio [11:08:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Andrio	[11:08:23] mm [11:08:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Uber	[11:09:27] Well I'm not worried if the user(s) can log in or not. Wasn't my question/issue. [11:09:27]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Uber	[11:12:20] and Zarthus to make the assumption that the password is entered incorrectly because it says "Invalid Login" is not accurate; as there is not alternative output coded such as "user doesn't exist [11:12:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Andrio	[11:12:38] Hm [11:12:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Andrio	[11:12:49] Are you currently connected to IRC with the same account on the same ZNC? [11:12:49]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Zarthus	[11:12:57] I assumed that because I assumed you knew your own username. [11:12:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Andrio	[11:13:03] If it's only a wrong password, you'd get a PM saying so. [11:13:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Uber	[11:14:12] Zarthus I mean you can enter anything in the box User "Sugar" Pass "Bean" and it will always return the output "Invlid Login" because there is not output [11:14:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Zarthus	[11:15:26] yes [11:15:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Uber	[11:15:27] no other output* [11:15:27]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Zarthus	[11:15:32] but is it so wrong for me to think you know what you're doing [11:15:32]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Filiaes	[11:20:59] but what's the problem to unload webadmin and controlpanel ... a user wont be able to configure the bot anymore, or? [11:20:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Filiaes	[11:22:23] if there is really a need to get a non trusted user access for the bot i would handle it in that way [11:22:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Filiaes	[11:23:17] then chroot the bot and run it exclusivly for non trusted user [11:23:17]

2016-09-18 09:13:53	thinkpad	[11:33:47] why are there global and user settings with seemingly the same options? [11:33:47]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	knolle	[11:45:00] because you might want global defaults and still give users the ability to change them [11:45:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	_MaDaLiN_	[13:03:23] awaynick on detach? Has znc this ? [13:03:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	JeDa	[13:08:05] _MaDaLiN_: that's been removed since 1.4 [13:08:05]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	JeDa	[13:08:41] you could get it from GitHub and compile/install it yourself though [13:08:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	JeDa	[13:09:04] but it isn't supported by ZNC developers (nor half people in this net probably) [13:09:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	_MaDaLiN_	[13:10:33] Ok i compiled the module .. i got .so file moves it to modules dir but when i use /znc loadmodule i still get that message that awaynick is retired from this version [13:10:33]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	_MaDaLiN_	[13:10:38] How can i get rid of that [13:10:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	hx0requiem	[13:24:49] Hello [13:24:49]

2016-09-18 09:13:53	MetaNova	[13:29:01] _MaDaLiN_: we don't encourage or condone the use of that module [13:29:01]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Jay2k1	[13:44:15] sarek: that, or patch it yourself if you can, or don't use the module ;) [13:44:15]

2016-09-18 13:24:38	Zarthus	[11:04:11] exists [11:04:11]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@Mikaela	[11:04:23] Thanks [11:04:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:04:43] Well Guess it would be between Chrome and LastPass [11:04:43]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Zarthus	[11:05:32] no, PEBCAK explicitly indicates it is not a hardware nor a software problem. [11:05:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:06:21] Well then I guess your thought would be incorrect since I'm not entering the data into the input boxd [11:06:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:06:23] box. [11:06:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Zarthus	[11:07:05] I'll not continue this discussion. [11:07:05]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Andrio	[11:07:18] Can you log in via IRC with that password? [11:07:18]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	mB-PiBox	[11:07:47] I'm logged in now with it [11:07:47]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Andrio	[11:07:58] Uber, can you log in via IRC with that password? [11:07:58]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	mB-PiBox	[11:08:17] I answered you Andrio [11:08:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Andrio	[11:08:23] mm [11:08:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:09:27] Well I'm not worried if the user(s) can log in or not. Wasn't my question/issue. [11:09:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:12:20] and Zarthus to make the assumption that the password is entered incorrectly because it says "Invalid Login" is not accurate; as there is not alternative output coded such as "user doesn't exist [11:12:20]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Andrio	[11:12:38] Hm [11:12:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Andrio	[11:12:49] Are you currently connected to IRC with the same account on the same ZNC? [11:12:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Zarthus	[11:12:57] I assumed that because I assumed you knew your own username. [11:12:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Andrio	[11:13:03] If it's only a wrong password, you'd get a PM saying so. [11:13:03]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:14:12] Zarthus I mean you can enter anything in the box User "Sugar" Pass "Bean" and it will always return the output "Invlid Login" because there is not output [11:14:12]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Zarthus	[11:15:26] yes [11:15:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:15:27] no other output* [11:15:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Zarthus	[11:15:32] but is it so wrong for me to think you know what you're doing [11:15:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Filiaes	[11:20:59] but what's the problem to unload webadmin and controlpanel ... a user wont be able to configure the bot anymore, or? [11:20:59]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Filiaes	[11:22:23] if there is really a need to get a non trusted user access for the bot i would handle it in that way [11:22:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Filiaes	[11:23:17] then chroot the bot and run it exclusivly for non trusted user [11:23:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Filiaes	[11:23:53] exclusively* [11:23:53]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	thinkpad	[11:33:47] why are there global and user settings with seemingly the same options? [11:33:47]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	knolle	[11:45:00] because you might want global defaults and still give users the ability to change them [11:45:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_MaDaLiN_	[13:03:23] awaynick on detach? Has znc this ? [13:03:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	JeDa	[13:08:05] _MaDaLiN_: that's been removed since 1.4 [13:08:05]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	JeDa	[13:08:41] you could get it from GitHub and compile/install it yourself though [13:08:41]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	JeDa	[13:09:04] but it isn't supported by ZNC developers (nor half people in this net probably) [13:09:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_MaDaLiN_	[13:10:33] Ok i compiled the module .. i got .so file moves it to modules dir but when i use /znc loadmodule i still get that message that awaynick is retired from this version [13:10:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_MaDaLiN_	[13:10:38] How can i get rid of that [13:10:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	hx0requiem	[13:24:49] Hello [13:24:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Cthulhux	[13:27:04] hi [13:27:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	MetaNova	[13:29:01] _MaDaLiN_: we don't encourage or condone the use of that module [13:29:01]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Jay2k1	[13:44:15] sarek: that, or patch it yourself if you can, or don't use the module ;) [13:44:15]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	KindOne	[20:03:59] Good news everyone! freenode now supports SASL EXTERNAL! [20:03:59]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@kerio	[20:04:38] we did it \o/ [20:04:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	vectr0n	[20:04:49] haven't they for awhile now? o0 [20:04:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@kerio	[20:04:50] honestly *cert needs a way to generate a cert [20:04:50]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@kerio	[20:04:53] vectr0n: nope [20:04:53]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@kerio	[20:05:06] only recently, with the readdition of the tor hidden service [20:05:06]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	vectr0n	[20:05:41] just thought they had, my mistake :) [20:05:41]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@kerio	[20:05:49] they had certfp for a long while [20:05:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	vectr0n	[20:05:59] aha thats what i am thinking of, lol [20:05:59]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@kerio	[20:06:15] but it was the somewhat disappointing implementation that causes nickserv to yell at you and then go "yep ty for telling me your password" immediately [20:06:15]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	vectr0n	[20:07:09] it's been so long since ive had to add anything to znc so networks melt together at times, lol [20:07:09]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	KindOne	[20:08:15] Now to do sasl external by telnet! [20:08:15]

2016-09-18 14:41:19	juggs	ezio, in your irc client (connected to your znc instance) if you enter /znc do you get a response from *status ?
2016-09-18 14:41:41	ezio	yup
2016-09-18 14:42:04	ezio	i just made some changes to stickychan
2016-09-18 14:42:08	ezio	but i've made them before
2016-09-18 14:42:40	juggs	then in that *status dialog enter    SaveConfig
2016-09-18 14:43:12	juggs	You should get a response like...   Wrote config to [/home/znc/.znc/configs/znc.conf]

2016-09-18 15:51:40	Uber	kinda an of-the-wall example though
2016-09-18 15:52:01	MetaNova	well now that the freenode tor hidden service is enabled again
2016-09-18 15:52:12	MetaNova	perhaps that particular article could use a makeover
2016-09-18 15:52:38	Uber	Perhaps.
2016-09-18 15:52:48	MetaNova	the difficulty with that is that it's not a clean example, given the need for SASL EXTERNAL
2016-09-18 15:53:25	Uber	yeah, it's kinda missing a big step.

2016-09-18 15:56:32	MetaNova	a writeup on how to connect ZNC to freenode using tor/sasl-external would prove useful, though

2016-09-18 15:57:42	Uber	It would.. and would save a lot of Q&A here
2016-09-18 15:58:04	MetaNova	should really get ahead of the curve on that
2016-09-18 15:58:32	MetaNova	I'd have to walk through it myself before feeling comfortable even answering questions about it, let alone writing it up
2016-09-18 15:58:48	MetaNova	maybe that'll be my project on my next day off from work
2016-09-18 15:59:11	Uber	Yeah, that's kinda what I'm doing right now... It's been a while since I messed with tor
2016-09-18 15:59:36	Uber	so I'm wiping an old RPi, to do a fresh install of ZNC/Tor
2016-09-18 15:59:48	MetaNova	good for you!
2016-09-18 15:59:56	Rockwolf	Is connecting through tor really necessary for IRC?
2016-09-18 16:00:11	MetaNova	Rockwolf: in very few cases it is
2016-09-18 16:00:20	MetaNova	example: an irc server only being available via Tor
2016-09-18 16:00:40	MetaNova	or, for people in countries with extraordinary internet filtering in place, Tor is the only way to access most of the internet

2016-09-18 16:00:59	MetaNova	so, it's not unheard of, but it's not often required
2016-09-18 16:01:35	Rockwolf	I see
2016-09-18 16:01:37	MetaNova	some people feel naked connecting without it, though
2016-09-18 16:02:05	Rockwolf	Why?
2016-09-18 16:02:25	MetaNova	paranoia, or perhaps even legitimate privacy concerns
2016-09-18 16:02:43	Rockwolf	I suppose.
2016-09-18 16:02:54	MetaNova	I've read about reporters not feeling comfortable using internet services without tor due to fears of them being specific monitoring targets
2016-09-18 16:03:22	Rockwolf	So connect through a vpn
2016-09-18 16:04:05	MetaNova	a VPN would still be able to track down to a person, if the entity doing the monitoring has enough leverage with the provider to make them disclose customer information
2016-09-18 16:04:21	MetaNova	part of the appeal of tor is the lack of user records like that
2016-09-18 16:04:26	MetaNova	as I understand it
2016-09-18 16:04:36	Uber	I'm gonna install tor and get stuck on the NSA/CIA watch list :|
2016-09-18 16:05:00	MetaNova	meh, I already assume I'm there
2016-09-18 16:05:08	Uber	lol
2016-09-18 16:05:22	Rockwolf	Be careful when a pizza van is parked outside you house for days on end
2016-09-18 16:05:25	Uber	ZNC still doesn't support SOCKS correct?

2016-09-18 22:36:27	Uber	http://www.howtogeek.com/265994/how-to-sync-android-notifications-to-your-windows-10-pc/
2016-09-18 22:36:40	Uber	but I look at my phone more than my computer so...
2016-09-18 22:37:42	Uber	I just use the notification sync -- and turn the other crap from the Cortana app off
2016-09-18 22:37:59	Lartza	I don't have a problem picking up my computer
2016-09-18 22:38:06	Lartza	The notifications are just delayed on the phone
2016-09-18 22:38:30	Uber	Oh sorry, misunderstood your issue.
2016-09-18 22:38:55	Uber	What kinda Android phone?
2016-09-18 22:41:59	Lartza	It's Android doze causing it I'm pretty sure
2016-09-18 22:44:20	Uber	idk, not familiar with Android. I have a Note 5, but only for work.
2016-09-18 22:44:36	Uber	Personal Phone is iPhone 6S+
2016-09-18 22:45:43	Uber	and I use pushover for sending notification from.. everything
2016-09-18 22:45:43		[22:45]
2016-09-18 22:46:22	Lartza	It goes to a sleep state when left alone and only lets important notifications to come through
2016-09-18 22:46:23	Lartza	saves battery
2016-09-18 22:46:37	Lartza	It's not a huge delay like 5 minutes but still
2016-09-18 22:46:48	Uber	No way of setting a certain app as "important"
2016-09-18 22:46:54	Uber	or does the Doze make the choice
2016-09-18 22:51:47	TorZNC	MetaNova .. We Have Achieved Success! Connected.
2016-09-18 22:51:51	Lartza	Maybe if I make znc-push send the notifications of irc as higher level I dunno
2016-09-18 22:51:55	Lartza	Need to look into it :)
2016-09-18 22:52:47	Uber	I don't see anything on my Note5 called Doze; App Manager > System Apps
2016-09-18 22:53:06	Uber	Maybe Samsung took it out, since they use their own power/battery manager.
2016-09-18 22:54:29	Uber	Do you not use a IRC client on your mobile that has notifications?
2016-09-18 22:57:35	Lartza	Android 6+ only
2016-09-18 22:58:08	Lartza	And no not always
2016-09-18 22:58:14	Lartza	I can open it up when ZNC notificates me :)
2016-09-18 22:59:47	Uber	Well it's Android 6.0.1, but still different battery manager.
2016-09-18 23:00:53	Lartza	I am not sure you can even configure doze so
2016-09-18 23:00:53		[23:00]
2016-09-18 23:01:48	Uber	I have "IRC for Android" installed on the Note5, and never had issue with notifications.
2016-09-18 23:05:05	Lartza	I get push notifications from ZNC
2016-09-18 23:05:19	Lartza	IRC for Android is running constantly it would have no issue with doze
2016-09-18 23:06:00	Uber	assumed so; just though using a client might be more reliable.
2016-09-18 23:06:07	Uber	thought*
2016-09-18 23:06:50	Uber	I use PUSH also, but only for my iPhone, since I don't really care about getting notifications on the Note5.

2016-09-19 02:44:08	MetaNova	[03:20:54] which, I don't blame you if you don't [03:20:54]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[03:21:53] I just get it from git. [03:21:53]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	MetaNova	[03:22:02] great [03:22:02]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[03:25:02] when is 1.7 expected to be "stable" [03:25:02]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	zoid	[03:30:41] Anyone here use ZNC Push with Pushjet? [03:30:41]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[03:46:37] ..waits while make takes hours to complete :| [03:46:37]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[07:41:30] Ugh, what do people use for push notifications now that pushbullet is crap? [07:41:30]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[07:41:42] notify my android has gone down and is buggy [07:41:42]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[07:42:50] Or my phone is doing something weird but NMA notifications are slow to arrive [07:42:50]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[07:43:51] Oh actually it's probably Android's doze... [07:43:51]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:32:22] Lartza, do you use Windows 10? [08:32:22]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[08:33:55] Yeah [08:33:55]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:36:26] Probably not the most 100% efficient [08:36:26]

2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:36:40] but I look at my phone more than my computer so... [08:36:40]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:37:42] I just use the notification sync -- and turn the other crap from the Cortana app off [08:37:42]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[08:37:59] I don't have a problem picking up my computer [08:37:59]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[08:38:06] The notifications are just delayed on the phone [08:38:06]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:38:30] Oh sorry, misunderstood your issue. [08:38:30]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:38:55] What kinda Android phone? [08:38:55]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[08:41:59] It's Android doze causing it I'm pretty sure [08:41:59]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:44:20] idk, not familiar with Android. I have a Note 5, but only for work. [08:44:20]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:44:36] Personal Phone is iPhone 6S+ [08:44:36]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:45:43] and I use pushover for sending notification from.. everything [08:45:43]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[08:46:22] It goes to a sleep state when left alone and only lets important notifications to come through [08:46:22]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[08:46:23] saves battery [08:46:23]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[08:46:37] It's not a huge delay like 5 minutes but still [08:46:37]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:46:48] No way of setting a certain app as "important" [08:46:48]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:46:54] or does the Doze make the choice [08:46:54]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	TorZNC	[08:51:47] MetaNova .. We Have Achieved Success! Connected. [08:51:47]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[08:51:51] Maybe if I make znc-push send the notifications of irc as higher level I dunno [08:51:51]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Lartza	[08:51:55] Need to look into it :) [08:51:55]
2016-09-19 02:44:08	Uber	[08:52:47] I don't see anything on my Note5 called Doze; App Manager > System Apps [08:52:47]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Uber	[08:53:05] Maybe Samsung took it out, since they use their own power/battery manager. [08:53:05]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Uber	[08:54:29] Do you not use a IRC client on your mobile that has notifications? [08:54:29]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Lartza	[08:57:35] Android 6+ only [08:57:35]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Lartza	[08:58:07] And no not always [08:58:07]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Lartza	[08:58:14] I can open it up when ZNC notificates me :) [08:58:14]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Uber	[08:59:47] Well it's Android 6.0.1, but still different battery manager. [08:59:47]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Lartza	[09:00:53] I am not sure you can even configure doze so [09:00:53]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Uber	[09:01:48] I have "IRC for Android" installed on the Note5, and never had issue with notifications. [09:01:48]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Lartza	[09:05:05] I get push notifications from ZNC [09:05:05]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Lartza	[09:05:19] IRC for Android is running constantly it would have no issue with doze [09:05:19]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Uber	[09:06:00] assumed so; just though using a client might be more reliable. [09:06:00]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Uber	[09:06:07] thought* [09:06:07]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Uber	[09:06:50] I use PUSH also, but only for my iPhone, since I don't really care about getting notifications on the Note5. [09:06:50]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Uber	[09:08:08] I could use Prowl but since I already have Pushover, didn't see the need [09:08:08]
2016-09-19 02:44:09	Uber	[09:08:51] in conjunction with I meant [09:08:51]

2016-09-19 12:53:03	TimBlo	i use the ip directly? this isnt a problem, is it? i set the CN like in the tutorial above

2016-09-19 12:55:15	Lartza	And the exact error is that the common name is invalid?
2016-09-19 12:57:01	TimBlo	could i track it this specifically? the error report is in german, so copy paste may not be helpful
2016-09-19 12:57:46	Lartza	You can change hexchat to english from the settings
2016-09-19 12:57:46		[12:57]
2016-09-19 12:59:10	TimBlo	hexchat does not provide a detailed error but asks if it`s self signed (which would not matter because i installed the rootCA on this computer)
2016-09-19 12:59:24	TimBlo	i get this in Chrome There are issues with the site's certificate chain (net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID).
2016-09-19 13:04:13	Lartza	Then that's not a ZNC bug but a problem with your cert setup
2016-09-19 13:04:55	Lartza	Chrome + Windows should work when you install the root cert to Windows

2016-09-19 13:10:56	TimBlo	maybe i made an error when creating it in frist place, the public keys do not match their sizes. this i a bit offtopic, but could this be causing the problem?
2016-09-19 13:16:00		[13:10]
2016-09-19 13:17:22	TimBlo	or other question. why are there that many tabs in the cert management window? it´s kind of confusing
2016-09-19 13:18:19	Lartza	In certlm?
2016-09-19 13:18:39	Lartza	Why even do this and not just accept invalid?
2016-09-19 13:22:00	TimBlo	i did accept invalids atm.
2016-09-19 13:22:29	Lartza	Yeah why even bother with root
2016-09-19 13:22:39	Lartza	Just accept self-signed
2016-09-19 13:23:17	TimBlo	but it seems like i installed it as intermediate authority. why the heck did i just do this?

2016-09-19 13:28:08	TimBlo	ok. i had to explicitly tell it to store it as root authority. it works! yeay! :D
2016-09-19 13:28:37	TimBlo	Thanks Lartza :)
2016-09-19 13:28:56	Lartza	Because having any old certificate in your root cert is insecure it probably does intermediate by default
2016-09-19 13:29:47	TimBlo	it is valid until 2022, what does old mean? :)
2016-09-19 13:30:18	MetaNova	'any old certificate' == 'any random certificate'
2016-09-19 13:30:27	MetaNova	as far as this context goes
2016-09-19 13:31:01	TimBlo	yep, think youre right :)

2016-09-19 17:56:06	arooni	hey folks; seeing Disconnected from IRC (Can't resolve server hostname). Reconnecting... ... how can i see which specific efnet server weechat is trying to connect to?
2016-09-19 17:56:24	arooni	it's connecting to one of the ones i set up via znc
2016-09-19 17:57:47	MetaNova	you can do '/msg *status listservers' and the one with '*' next to it is the one it's trying at that moment
2016-09-19 17:57:59	MetaNova	meaning the previous one is the one which it can't resolve
2016-09-19 17:58:20	MetaNova	you should always check http://www.efnet.org/?module=servers for which server addresses are valid

2016-09-20 00:39:09	MetaNova	[21:19:18] I've been asking you how you connect to that network [21:19:18]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	MetaNova	[21:19:25] and you're telling me it's another ZNC instance? [21:19:25]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	MetaNova	[21:19:40] oh [21:19:40]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	MetaNova	[21:19:44] I misread [21:19:44]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	MagicalWill	[21:20:12] I can send screenshots? Or is what I said okay? [21:20:12]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	MetaNova	[21:20:27] also, you're going to have a bad time if you rely on separation of the username and password [21:20:27]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	MetaNova	[21:20:41] it's better to simply put the entire username/networkname:password as the password argument [21:20:41]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	MetaNova	[21:21:39] if your target network actually does discriminate by 'username' (ident) and supplying username:password as the password fails, then you'll need to change the ident in znc to match your intended username [21:21:39]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	MagicalWill	[21:22:16] Alright I'll try that, thanks [21:22:16]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	MetaNova	[21:22:43] should be changeable via *controlpanel or webadmin [21:22:43]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	TimBlo	[22:47:52] hi. is there a known issue about znc servers not beeing able to proof that they are who they are? [22:47:52]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	TimBlo	[22:49:13] i used this tutorial https://datacenteroverlords.com/2012/03/01/creating-your-own-ssl-certificate-authority/ - so i installed my own root CA [22:49:13]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	TimBlo	[22:50:00] and im not getting any issue when using ssl with it for my python program [22:50:00]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	Lartza	[22:50:34] What is the issue? [22:50:34]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	TimBlo	[22:51:39] when using webadmin i get notified that the server did not proof beeing the one mentioned by it`? address [22:51:39]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	TimBlo	[22:52:02] and hexchat is less detailed but also mentions an error [22:52:02]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	Lartza	[22:52:11] So your certificate common name doesn't match the server domain? [22:52:11]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	TimBlo	[22:53:03] i use the ip directly? this isnt a problem, is it? i set the CN like in the tutorial above [22:53:03]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	Lartza	[22:53:48] It shouln't be a probllem, ZNC ip is the same as the common name? [22:53:48]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	TimBlo	[22:54:48] yes, and hexchat acually displays it [22:54:48]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	Lartza	[22:55:15] And the exact error is that the common name is invalid? [22:55:15]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	TimBlo	[22:57:00] could i track it this specifically? the error report is in german, so copy paste may not be helpful [22:57:00]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	Lartza	[22:57:46] You can change hexchat to english from the settings [22:57:46]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	TimBlo	[22:59:10] hexchat does not provide a detailed error but asks if it`s self signed (which would not matter because i installed the rootCA on this computer) [22:59:10]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	TimBlo	[22:59:24] i get this in Chrome There are issues with the site's certificate chain (net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID). [22:59:24]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	Lartza	[23:04:13] Then that's not a ZNC bug but a problem with your cert setup [23:04:13]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	Lartza	[23:04:55] Chrome + Windows should work when you install the root cert to Windows [23:04:55]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	TimBlo	[23:06:08] i thought i did it, but in details about the recieved cert, it`s telling i didn`t [23:06:08]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	TimBlo	[23:10:56] maybe i made an error when creating it in frist place, the public keys do not match their sizes. this i a bit offtopic, but could this be causing the problem? [23:10:56]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	TimBlo	[23:17:22] or other question. why are there that many tabs in the cert management window? it´s kind of confusing [23:17:22]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	Lartza	[23:18:19] In certlm? [23:18:19]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	Lartza	[23:18:39] Why even do this and not just accept invalid? [23:18:39]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	TimBlo	[23:22:00] i did accept invalids atm. [23:22:00]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	Lartza	[23:22:29] Yeah why even bother with root [23:22:29]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	Lartza	[23:22:39] Just accept self-signed [23:22:39]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	TimBlo	[23:23:17] but it seems like i installed it as intermediate authority. why the heck did i just do this? [23:23:17]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	TimBlo	[23:28:08] ok. i had to explicitly tell it to store it as root authority. it works! yeay! :D [23:28:08]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	TimBlo	[23:28:37] Thanks Lartza :) [23:28:37]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	Lartza	[23:28:56] Because having any old certificate in your root cert is insecure it probably does intermediate by default [23:28:56]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	TimBlo	[23:29:47] it is valid until 2022, what does old mean? :) [23:29:47]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	MetaNova	[23:30:18] 'any old certificate' == 'any random certificate' [23:30:18]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	MetaNova	[23:30:27] as far as this context goes [23:30:27]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	TimBlo	[23:31:01] yep, think youre right :) [23:31:01]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	Lartza	[23:31:06] Yeah, an idiom [23:31:06]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	arooni	[03:56:06] hey folks; seeing Disconnected from IRC (Can't resolve server hostname). Reconnecting... ... how can i see which specific efnet server weechat is trying to connect to? [03:56:06]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	arooni	[03:56:24] it's connecting to one of the ones i set up via znc [03:56:24]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	MetaNova	[03:57:47] you can do '/msg *status listservers' and the one with '*' next to it is the one it's trying at that moment [03:57:47]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	MetaNova	[03:57:59] meaning the previous one is the one which it can't resolve [03:57:59]
2016-09-20 00:39:09	MetaNova	[03:58:20] you should always check http://www.efnet.org/?module=servers for which server addresses are valid [03:58:20]

2016-09-20 04:52:07	canopus	SM0TVI: it seems to remember only the channel name, because when I restart my ZNC, it doesn't join the channel with the password
2016-09-20 04:53:30	Andrio	Is it up to date?
2016-09-20 04:54:02	canopus	the password? yes, it didn't change.
2016-09-20 04:54:18	Andrio	No, your ZNC installation.

2016-09-20 04:54:50	SM0TVI	canopus: It's called "key" in the documentation.

2016-09-20 04:58:25	canopus	No, SM0TVI. It didn't.
2016-09-20 04:59:58	canopus	I wrote the "key" manually again. Let's see if it works next time.
2016-09-20 05:01:59	SM0TVI	canopus: Do you have the *controlpanel module loaded?

2016-09-20 05:04:29	SM0TVI	canopus: so, in the *controlpanel query, type getchan key <your znc username> <network name> #<channel>

2016-09-20 05:07:02	canopus	ah, ok
2016-09-20 05:07:26	 *	SM0TVI is still a relative n00b to ZNC but hopes he is helpful to canopus.

2016-09-20 05:09:15	canopus	I really appreaciate your help SM0TVI
2016-09-20 05:09:31	canopus	I did GetChan key again and it's ok

2016-09-20 14:26:44	Intee	I have added my znc server to my irssi client to auto connect that works fine but I'm wondering if there is a way to auto login my ZNC user.
2016-09-20 14:27:09	Intee	Maybe I could write a script or something that just asks for a password so I don't have to always type the /quote pass blah/blah:blah every time.

2016-09-20 14:29:51	vectr0n	or pass it via the server password option all clients have

2016-09-20 14:31:35	vectr0n	you just set the server password as your user/network:password

2016-09-20 15:23:19	sarek	damn. clearing the buffer would mean the conversation is deleted. all i want to do is mark it as read, and if i close it, delete(clear it)
2016-09-20 15:24:21	Andrio	Some clients can do that with a script or plugin.
2016-09-20 15:24:34	Andrio	Send `/znc clearbuffer <nickname>` when the query window is closed

2016-09-20 15:25:36	sarek	i had that that installed and loaded MetaNova but the problem was it cleared it once read. i want to only clear when closed

2016-09-20 18:53:19	Intee	[00:27:08] Maybe I could write a script or something that just asks for a password so I don't have to always type the /quote pass blah/blah:blah every time. [00:27:08]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	Yunis	[00:29:34] on 1:connect: { /quote pass user/network:password } [00:29:34]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	vectr0n	[00:29:50] or pass it via the server password option all clients have [00:29:50]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	vectr0n	[00:30:06] most* [00:30:06]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	Intee	[00:31:17] I'm not really sure what you mean Yunis sorry.. vectr0n I'll do some googling now :) Thanks. [00:31:17]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	vectr0n	[00:31:34] you just set the server password as your user/network:password [00:31:34]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	vectr0n	[00:31:46] just like you would if you wanted to connected to a normal ircd that is passworded [00:31:46]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	vectr0n	[00:32:04] that has a password* lol [00:32:04]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	Zarthus	[00:34:16] Yunis: that's insecure and .. not for his client [00:34:16]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	vectr0n	[00:34:19] Intee, [[irssi]] [00:34:19]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	ZNC-Linker	[00:34:19] http://wiki.znc.in/irssi [00:34:19]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	Intee	[00:34:39] Got it! :D [00:34:39]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	vectr0n	[00:34:44] :) [00:34:44]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	Intee	[00:34:51] Thanks vectr0n.. That isn't too unsecure is it? [00:34:51]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	Zarthus	[00:35:23] no, yunis'  thing was insecure because it sends your ZNC password to every server you connect to [00:35:23]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	vectr0n	[00:35:26] if you are using ssl you are fine [00:35:26]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	Intee	[00:35:31] I'm using ssl :D [00:35:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	Intee	[00:35:35] Sweet. Thanks guys <3 [00:35:35]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	Robby`	[00:42:40] o_O [00:42:40]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	sarek	[01:20:33] You can't close a query in znc? Every time i close a query in textual, i close textual and re-open, the query is back [01:20:33]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	MetaNova	[01:21:20] if you don't clear the buffer, it'll return [01:21:20]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	MetaNova	[01:21:37] this is normally the default behavior [01:21:37]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	MetaNova	[01:21:43] unless you've disabled it [01:21:43]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	Andrio	[01:21:51] It is? [01:21:51]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	sarek	[01:23:19] damn. clearing the buffer would mean the conversation is deleted. all i want to do is mark it as read, and if i close it, delete(clear it) [01:23:19]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	Andrio	[01:24:21] Some clients can do that with a script or plugin. [01:24:21]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	Andrio	[01:24:34] Send `/znc clearbuffer <nickname>` when the query window is closed [01:24:34]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	sarek	[01:24:36] No plugin to clear buffer only when closed/ [01:24:36]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	MetaNova	[01:24:42] sarek: look into http://wiki.znc.in/Playback [01:24:42]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	MetaNova	[01:25:31] it's the best solution I can think of to retain persistent buffers while also not forcefully reopening queries without you specifically asking [01:25:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	sarek	[01:25:36] i had that that installed and loaded MetaNova but the problem was it cleared it once read. i want to only clear when closed [01:25:36]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	MetaNova	[01:26:21] znc was never designed to emulate "display previous session activity each time, every time" [01:26:21]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	MetaNova	[01:26:35] that's a function better handled by a client, so all current methods are workarounds [01:26:35]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	sarek	[01:27:32] thats a bit surprising, but thanks. my only alternative is irc cloud, which i dont want so i can live with this i suppose [01:27:32]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	clorophormo	[01:58:29] Any idea why ZNC would start using 100% cpu? [01:58:29]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	clorophormo	[01:58:44] first time seeing this [01:58:44]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	milky	[02:04:58] How can I disable ZNC reconnecting if I time out, or other reason [02:04:58]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	milky	[02:05:33] Unchecking “Connect to IRC & automatically re-connect” disconnects me and using “/znc connect” enables it [02:05:33]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	milky	[02:05:52] When is the way to perform a connect also related to a way to disable re-connect [02:05:52]
2016-09-20 18:53:19	KindOne	[02:19:54] you cant [02:19:54]

2016-09-21 08:02:24	KindOne	Lartza: lol... simply restarting my modem i get a new ip or whever it freaks out from under heavy load (~70% of the time) or when my lease is up somewhere between ~72 hours to a week
2016-09-21 08:02:26	canopus	so my IP changes every 12 hours
2016-09-21 08:03:02	Lartza	KindOne, Restarting does nothing for me, or even few hours without a modem
2016-09-21 08:04:14	KindOne	I have windstream... only issue is the ip changes and the modem forgetting my identd settings
2016-09-21 08:04:31	KindOne	sometimes forgetting *

2016-09-21 08:09:26	Lartza	But I guess that's rural ADSL

2016-09-21 09:59:37	zoid	I can't figure out how to configure it in a way that only notifies me if I'm not attached.
2016-09-21 09:59:38	MetaNova	joecool: per http://wiki.znc.in/Compiling_modules the user module directory is in ~/.znc/modules/
2016-09-21 09:59:50	MetaNova	assuming your data directory is ~/.znc (which is the default)
2016-09-21 10:00:05	MetaNova	if you specified a different data directory, it would be in <datadir>/modules/
2016-09-21 10:00:22	joecool	MetaNova: yeah I read that much but the data directory is set to /var/lib/znc/ and I figured it'd make sense to create a modules folder there and put it in
2016-09-21 10:00:24	joecool	no good though
2016-09-21 10:00:51	MetaNova	are you saying that ZNC does not see any user modules in /var/lib/znc/modules/ ?
2016-09-21 10:00:56	joecool	this is a python module.. i noted in the global directory there is a modpython directory there
2016-09-21 10:01:04	joecool	MetaNova: correct
2016-09-21 10:01:30	MetaNova	perl and python scripts are also to be placed in the /var/lib/znc/modules/ directory
2016-09-21 10:02:16	joecool	whelp, didn't work there... maybe i'm loading it wrong way
2016-09-21 10:02:27	joecool	i tried loadmod scriptname
2016-09-21 10:02:28	MetaNova	what command are you issuing?
2016-09-21 10:02:31	joecool	not loadmod scriptname.py
2016-09-21 10:02:45	MetaNova	okay, that was my next question, because that is the correct way
2016-09-21 10:02:56	joecool	which way is correct, former or latter?
2016-09-21 10:03:03	MetaNova	the former
2016-09-21 10:03:19	joecool	i will try to load it from global directory now and see if works
2016-09-21 10:03:25	MetaNova	example, I have aka.py, doing 'loadmod aka' works, doing 'loadmod aka.py' does not work
2016-09-21 10:05:13	joecool	globally not working either... my only guess is that it's python2 and i built for python3?

2016-09-21 10:57:46	|M1971|	several ways, but first you have to know which module it is
2016-09-21 10:58:58	|M1971|	are you the admin?  do you have access to the web ui?
2016-09-21 10:59:16	joecool	yeah
2016-09-21 10:59:32	|M1971|	web ui is the easiest, just uncheck the module on whichever network/user you want to disable it on
2016-09-21 10:59:36	joecool	it's weird cause simple_away appears to be loaded but admin doesn't show it under global or user modules
2016-09-21 10:59:52	joecool	i'm guessing it's simple_away setting the away message

2016-09-21 11:03:49	joecool	having marked away would dissuade people from doing that

2016-09-21 11:06:05	|M1971|	ah yeah i can understand that,  i'm usually connected with one device or another so rarely do i d/c and get set away

2016-09-21 12:41:38	dx	[20:37:48] for anyone using irssi: 0.8.20 is out fixing two remote crash bugs, update asap or apply the workaround script https://irssi.org/2016/09/21/irssi-0.8.20-released/ [20:37:48]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	joecool	[20:51:11] hey how can i disable the autoaway? [20:51:11]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	|M1971|	[20:57:46] several ways, but first you have to know which module it is [20:57:46]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	|M1971|	[20:58:58] are you the admin?  do you have access to the web ui? [20:58:58]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	joecool	[20:59:16] yeah [20:59:16]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	|M1971|	[20:59:32] web ui is the easiest, just uncheck the module on whichever network/user you want to disable it on [20:59:32]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	joecool	[20:59:36] it's weird cause simple_away appears to be loaded but admin doesn't show it under global or user modules [20:59:36]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	joecool	[20:59:52] i'm guessing it's simple_away setting the away message [20:59:52]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	|M1971|	[21:00:36] yeah, that's what i use [21:00:36]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	|M1971|	[21:01:01] simple_away only shows for each user/network for me [21:01:01]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	joecool	[21:01:44] ah i see it, didn't realize there was a third section [21:01:44]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	|M1971|	[21:01:53] yep [21:01:53]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	|M1971|	[21:02:14] i like the simple away module,  been running it for years [21:02:14]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	joecool	[21:03:30] i just don't feel like having my nick set away, i registered push so anyone needing me can just pm or highlight [21:03:30]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	joecool	[21:03:49] having marked away would dissuade people from doing that [21:03:49]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	joecool	[21:04:04] but i can understand where it'd be useful (this is for my mobile though, not laptop) [21:04:04]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	|M1971|	[21:06:05] ah yeah i can understand that,  i'm usually connected with one device or another so rarely do i d/c and get set away [21:06:05]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	joecool	[21:07:41] yeah this is a second nick, so i can go offline on this one and people can 'page' my other one... something quick i'd answer on phone, otherwise i'd hop on laptop to handle [21:07:41]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	|M1971|	[21:11:59] Used to leave irc open on my phone all the time but it tends to drain the bat after a few hours so only call it up when i'm out, leave it up on DT 24/7 usually [21:11:59]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	joecool	[21:22:08] oh lame, i have to revert to older version of this script... it only does push if marked away in current form loll [21:22:08]
2016-09-21 12:41:38	Geronimo	[21:30:53] how can I see the server-time sent by znc to textual irc? [21:30:53]

2016-09-21 19:07:03	|M1971|	[21:01:53] yep [21:01:53]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	|M1971|	[21:02:14] i like the simple away module,  been running it for years [21:02:14]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	joecool	[21:03:30] i just don't feel like having my nick set away, i registered push so anyone needing me can just pm or highlight [21:03:30]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	joecool	[21:03:49] having marked away would dissuade people from doing that [21:03:49]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	joecool	[21:04:04] but i can understand where it'd be useful (this is for my mobile though, not laptop) [21:04:04]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	|M1971|	[21:06:05] ah yeah i can understand that,  i'm usually connected with one device or another so rarely do i d/c and get set away [21:06:05]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	joecool	[21:07:41] yeah this is a second nick, so i can go offline on this one and people can 'page' my other one... something quick i'd answer on phone, otherwise i'd hop on laptop to handle [21:07:41]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	|M1971|	[21:11:59] Used to leave irc open on my phone all the time but it tends to drain the bat after a few hours so only call it up when i'm out, leave it up on DT 24/7 usually [21:11:59]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	joecool	[21:22:08] oh lame, i have to revert to older version of this script... it only does push if marked away in current form loll [21:22:08]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Geronimo	[21:30:53] how can I see the server-time sent by znc to textual irc? [21:30:53]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	milky	[21:48:50] Geronimo, Textual has a “/debug raw on” command to log traffic to Console.app [21:48:50]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	Geronimo	[21:54:33] what log file should I check? [21:54:33]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	milky	[21:56:18] Geronimo it logs to the All Messages section of the Console application [21:56:18]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	milky	[21:56:27] Probably wanna filter by “Textual” in search box [21:56:27]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	milky	[21:56:31] Maybe move conversation to #textual [21:56:31]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	zoid	[03:22:23] Does anyone here use ZNC Push? [03:22:23]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	user1234_	[04:44:07] Anyone know where I can buy IRC bouncer or shell account/access? [04:44:07]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	MetaNova	[04:44:54] user1234_: there are both free and paid ZNC accounts at the [[Providers]] page [04:44:54]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	ZNC-Linker	[04:44:54] http://wiki.znc.in/Providers [04:44:54]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	MetaNova	[04:45:06] but those don't come with shell access [04:45:06]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	MetaNova	[04:45:36] you would need to google 'shell service' or 'shell provider' to actually find organizations/companies/services which offer/shell shell accounts [04:45:36]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	grawity	[04:45:46] these days, if you want shell access, might as well rent a full VPS [04:45:46]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	grawity	[04:45:49] they're that cheap [04:45:49]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	MetaNova	[04:45:54] and it's my personal recommendation .. ^ yeah what grawity said [04:45:54]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	MetaNova	[04:46:02] if you're looking for shell access, just rent a cheap VPS [04:46:02]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	MetaNova	[04:46:12] which should give you not just shell access, but full root access [04:46:12]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	jswe	[04:47:35] how do i change my whois ip to something comical? [04:47:35]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	MetaNova	[04:49:00] jswe: buy a domain, rent a server, point the domain (or a subdomain) at the server's IP address, set the rDNS on the server's IP address to point to the domain [04:49:00]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	jswe	[04:50:38] im already running znc off my vps but i thought you could spoof it... thanks anyways [04:50:38]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	MetaNova	[04:52:34] no, ZNC is not designed to do that [04:52:34]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	MetaNova	[04:52:40] in fact, you cannot do that, period [04:52:40]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	MetaNova	[04:52:51] custom/vanity host addresses are all rDNS records [04:52:51]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	jswe	[04:53:32] thanks, those are the terms i should be googling [04:53:32]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	jswe	[04:54:15] i just didnt want to expose my ip publicly ^^ [04:54:15]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	grawity	[04:57:16] rDNS doesn't hide your IP address [04:57:16]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	MetaNova	[04:57:30] ^ [04:57:30]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	grawity	[04:57:40] though it's not like your rented server's address is useful for anyone, anyway [04:57:40]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	grawity	[04:58:10] for a *slight* level of privacy, you could try the *other* method of 'spoofing' – ask network staff to set a cloak/vhost on your account [04:58:10]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	grawity	[04:58:36] freenode only gives out generic ones, and they're not 100% effective, but if it makes you feel better then *shrug* [04:58:36]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	MetaNova	[04:58:52] it'll prevent anyone doing a simple /whois from seeing it [04:58:52]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	MetaNova	[04:58:59] which is all most people do [04:58:59]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	 *	grawity [04:59:32] finds it enough to just connect to IRC off a linode [04:59:32]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	MetaNova	[05:00:27] I connect through one of my VPSs, and then have a cloak on top of that [05:00:27]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	MetaNova	[05:00:36] if I were more paranoid, I'd use something like a VPN [05:00:36]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	jswe	[05:01:37] any better than digitalocean grawity? [05:01:37]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	MetaNova	[05:02:02] there are arguably 'better' services, but digitalocean has the best price-to-value ratio [05:02:02]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	grawity	[05:02:16] jswe: I dunno, I just like them [05:02:16]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	MetaNova	[05:02:16] and their $5/month plans are very sufficient for ZNC and hard to beat at that price [05:02:16]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	MetaNova	[05:02:21] DO is great [05:02:21]
2016-09-21 19:07:03	jswe	[05:02:36] yes i am happy with DO [05:02:36]

2016-09-22 00:23:56	jswe	[04:54:15] i just didnt want to expose my ip publicly ^^ [04:54:15]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	grawity	[04:57:16] rDNS doesn't hide your IP address [04:57:16]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	MetaNova	[04:57:30] ^ [04:57:30]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	grawity	[04:57:40] though it's not like your rented server's address is useful for anyone, anyway [04:57:40]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	grawity	[04:58:10] for a *slight* level of privacy, you could try the *other* method of 'spoofing' – ask network staff to set a cloak/vhost on your account [04:58:10]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	grawity	[04:58:36] freenode only gives out generic ones, and they're not 100% effective, but if it makes you feel better then *shrug* [04:58:36]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	MetaNova	[04:58:52] it'll prevent anyone doing a simple /whois from seeing it [04:58:52]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	MetaNova	[04:58:59] which is all most people do [04:58:59]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	 *	grawity [04:59:32] finds it enough to just connect to IRC off a linode [04:59:32]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	MetaNova	[05:00:27] I connect through one of my VPSs, and then have a cloak on top of that [05:00:27]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	MetaNova	[05:00:36] if I were more paranoid, I'd use something like a VPN [05:00:36]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	jswe	[05:01:37] any better than digitalocean grawity? [05:01:37]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	MetaNova	[05:02:02] there are arguably 'better' services, but digitalocean has the best price-to-value ratio [05:02:02]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	grawity	[05:02:16] jswe: I dunno, I just like them [05:02:16]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	MetaNova	[05:02:16] and their $5/month plans are very sufficient for ZNC and hard to beat at that price [05:02:16]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	MetaNova	[05:02:21] DO is great [05:02:21]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	jswe	[05:02:36] yes i am happy with DO [05:02:36]

2016-09-22 00:23:56	mniip	[08:56:39] why doesn't ZNC log statusmsgs separately from regular channel messages [08:56:39]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	mniip	[08:58:31] indeed https://github.com/znc/znc/issues/1239 [08:58:31]

2016-09-22 00:23:56	Zarthus	[09:36:02] Eh, I don't think that's inconsistent [09:36:02]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Zarthus	[09:36:12] that sounds like expected behaviour to me [09:36:12]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Zarthus	[09:36:26] so long as you can omit them with grep [09:36:26]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Zarthus	[09:36:45] (i.e. it's logged with @# somewhere in there) [09:36:45]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	unborn	[09:39:18] hi guys.. is it possible to add to my znc bouncer the python bot? its just helper to answer faqs on channel [09:39:18]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Zarthus	[09:39:44] you mean the other way around? [09:39:44]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Zarthus	[09:39:48] Give your python bot a bouncer? [09:39:48]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Zarthus	[09:40:11] (that's entirely up to your bouncer provider) [09:40:11]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	unborn	[09:42:33] Zarthus: you mean connect python script via znc as normal user? [09:42:33]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Zarthus	[09:42:55] I don't know what your python bot does, but it's not different from connecting to a passworded network. [09:42:55]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	unborn	[09:43:48] Zarthus: basically if someone say on channel !dpkg then bot will give out info about package etc.. [09:43:48]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Zarthus	[09:44:00] We don't assist with third party bots. [09:44:00]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	unborn	[09:44:13] sure.. is there anything build in? [09:44:13]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	unborn	[09:44:17] for znc then? [09:44:17]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	Zarthus	[09:44:32] You'd have to write your own bot using znc modules if you want that functionality, or connect your bot through znc. [09:44:32]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	juggs	[10:07:42] unborn, most bot frameworks (eggdrop, pircbot et al.) just join an IRC network as a regular client and have facilities for identifying with nickserv, passing a server passwd on connect etc. - so there should be no reason you can't set one of them up to connect via your ZNC instance to w/e irc network. Can be handy to have a bot you can "perform" things via i.e. get it to "say" things on command to w/e channel - then you can control the bot to config [10:07:42]
2016-09-22 00:23:56	juggs	[10:07:43] ure it's own ZNC config as needed. It's not really a ZNC question though as Zarthus says. [10:07:43]

2016-09-22 09:46:56	ILoveMe	maybe someone can help me , as I'm quite noob at znc , and googling didn't help me so far
2016-09-22 09:47:26	ILoveMe	I'm looking for a way to save all conversations that happen on the channels . As far as I've noticed , znc will save a handfull of pages , but I would like all
2016-09-22 09:47:30	ILoveMe	is that possible ? :)

2016-09-22 09:52:25	ILoveMe	I guess both . mostly to replay once reconnecting :)
2016-09-22 09:53:22	Bubi	usually, if you connect again, you get all of the text since your last disconnect, BUT a certain maximum is set, or the playback could take ages
2016-09-22 09:54:23	Bubi	I have set mine to 500 lines, which is enough

2016-09-23 05:43:29	Angelique21	i have a small ishue
2016-09-23 05:43:36	Angelique21	if any can help
2016-09-23 05:45:07	MetaNova	with?
2016-09-23 05:46:08	Angelique21	i have a znc and i cant get in...
2016-09-23 05:46:37	Angelique21	i get this error  <*status> Network (irc.znc.in) doesn't exist.
2016-09-23 05:46:53	MetaNova	well that's because there is no such irc.znc.in network
2016-09-23 05:46:55	Angelique21	strange enugh cuz the znc is still online

2016-09-23 05:47:07	Angelique21	it was
2016-09-23 05:47:29	Angelique21	cuz i have it saved as server
2016-09-23 05:47:35	MetaNova	no
2016-09-23 05:47:41	Angelique21	and it worke fine till this mrning
2016-09-23 05:47:45	MetaNova	there is no such thing as irc.znc.in
2016-09-23 05:48:14	MetaNova	you need to make sure your network(s) are named correctly, then make sure your server(s) for each network are specified correctly
2016-09-23 05:48:23	Angelique21	193.183.99.239 this was the ip
2016-09-23 05:48:23	MetaNova	I'd recommend doing this through the webadmin interface
2016-09-23 05:49:00	MetaNova	what port are you listening on, and are you using ssl?
2016-09-23 05:49:30	MetaNova	because for SSL, you'd open a web browser and navigate to https://zncaddress:zncport
2016-09-23 05:49:46	MetaNova	without SSL you'd open a web browser and navigate to http://zncaddress:zncport
2016-09-23 05:49:56	Bubi	for me it sounds like you configured your client to use Angelique21/irc.znc.in:password, so *status complains about the lack of a network called irc.znc.in
2016-09-23 05:49:56	MetaNova	log in and make sure your networks and servers are specified correctly
2016-09-23 05:50:33	MetaNova	once that is done, make sure your client is configured to connect to znc using the proper address and port, and more importantly, log in with the server password of username/networkname:password

2016-09-23 05:54:38	Angelique21	can i just ginve you the web admin interface..?
2016-09-23 05:54:46	Angelique21	and see what is going on there?

2016-09-23 05:55:20	MetaNova	and it's a very simple fix, just specify the network correctly

2016-09-23 05:57:06	MetaNova	this isn't working because you don't have a network named irc.znc.in
2016-09-23 05:57:13	MetaNova	but you do have a network named filelist
2016-09-23 05:57:27	MetaNova	so .. specify the network name correctly

2016-09-23 06:27:04	Zarthus	it's sorted by "whoever added them where they wanted"
2016-09-23 06:27:37	Zarthus	i think it's better if longer-established providers would be higher up
2016-09-23 06:27:44	Zarthus	although you could argue it should just be sorted by newest znc version

2016-09-23 07:36:06	Zarthus	yes
2016-09-23 07:37:32	TorZNC	So why add "date of establishment" if its already there?
2016-09-23 07:38:01	MetaNova	I think he means when each service began operating as a service
2016-09-23 07:38:12	Zarthus	I just added it, TorZNC
2016-09-23 07:38:21	Zarthus	establishment is just too long winded, so i went with started
2016-09-23 07:38:47	MetaNova	hey, that's awesome
2016-09-23 07:38:55	Zarthus	the date sorting doesn't work though
2016-09-23 07:39:02	MetaNova	yes it does
2016-09-23 07:39:02	Zarthus	it worked at one point in previewing, then broke
2016-09-23 07:39:07	Zarthus	i went with numeric as workaround
2016-09-23 07:39:17	MetaNova	oh
2016-09-23 07:39:40	Zarthus	they're also WHOIS dates, might be inaccurate.

2016-09-23 07:49:36	Zarthus	but yeah, I went with WHOIS registration dates, which is a bit unfair for certain things like previously-existing stores. I added a comment stating the preference is official start, then WHOIS date, then znc-added-to-table-date.
2016-09-23 07:50:04	Zarthus	the numeric sorting breaks for example with 2016-01 and 2016-09, 01 goes before 09 in desc sorting.
2016-09-23 07:50:33	Zarthus	It worked up until one point in editing, I'm not sure what broke it but it's an issue I'll revisit later.
2016-09-23 07:51:15	Zarthus	stormbnc, for example, probably started being an ircd in 2009, but might've provided a znc service later.

2016-09-23 10:04:40	DarthGandalf	Even ISO 8601 dates?
2016-09-23 10:05:16	DarthGandalf	2016-09-23 is sorted lexicographically like a string
2016-09-23 10:05:35	Dessa	i fixed it now.
2016-09-23 10:06:01	Dessa	added <span style="display:none">&{{#expr:3e11+{{#time:U|..}}}}</span> infront of each date
2016-09-23 10:06:25	Dessa	i didn't try to change the date format back though :p
2016-09-23 10:06:45	Dessa	the decending sorting was broken without this anyway.

2016-09-23 12:21:11	Zarthus	[17:39:01] it worked at one point in previewing, then broke [17:39:01]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	Zarthus	[17:39:06] i went with numeric as workaround [17:39:06]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	MetaNova	[17:39:16] oh [17:39:16]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	Zarthus	[17:39:39] they're also WHOIS dates, might be inaccurate. [17:39:39]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	TorZNC	[17:39:41] Zarthus, sorry, it said the page was last updated 20 November 2015 [17:39:41]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	Zarthus	[17:39:45] but it sets a good baseline [17:39:45]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	TorZNC	[17:39:51] So didn't know was just added [17:39:51]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	Zarthus	[17:39:55] np :) [17:39:55]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	Zarthus	[17:39:59] the table is a different page [17:39:59]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	Zarthus	[17:40:03] go to url + /table [17:40:03]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	TorZNC	[17:40:11] I see now; checked source [17:40:11]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	Zarthus	[17:49:35] but yeah, I went with WHOIS registration dates, which is a bit unfair for certain things like previously-existing stores. I added a comment stating the preference is official start, then WHOIS date, then znc-added-to-table-date. [17:49:35]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	Zarthus	[17:50:03] the numeric sorting breaks for example with 2016-01 and 2016-09, 01 goes before 09 in desc sorting. [17:50:03]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	Zarthus	[17:50:32] It worked up until one point in editing, I'm not sure what broke it but it's an issue I'll revisit later. [17:50:32]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	Zarthus	[17:51:14] stormbnc, for example, probably started being an ircd in 2009, but might've provided a znc service later. [17:51:14]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	TorZNC	[17:54:37] Network Specific providers looks so 'plain' now [17:54:37]
2016-09-23 12:21:11	TorZNC	[17:54:43] lol [17:54:43]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Zarthus	[17:57:30] I don't know why anyone would use znc.bg [17:57:30]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Zarthus	[17:57:31] Join our IRC channel every 2 weeks [17:57:31]

2016-09-23 12:21:12	MetaNova	[18:09:33] which module? [18:09:33]

2016-09-23 12:21:12	Zarthus	[18:10:18] you need to be an admin [18:10:18]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Berzerker	[18:10:27] so I added the plugin, and enabled it myself [18:10:27]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Berzerker	[18:10:30] is that all that needs to be done? [18:10:30]

2016-09-23 12:21:12	Zarthus	[18:11:04] if you can find other error messages and ctrl+f them there that might help you find the cause(s) as well [18:11:04]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Berzerker	[18:11:27] that makes sense [18:11:27]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Berzerker	[18:15:49] hmm.. [18:15:49]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Berzerker	[18:16:08] the instructions specifically leave out information on how to actually *register* a user lol [18:16:08]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Berzerker	[18:18:04] ok never mind, user didn't disconnect/reconnect to register it [18:18:04]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Berzerker	[18:18:22] thanks for the help Zarthus [18:18:22]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	flix-	[19:13:15] hi [19:13:15]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	flix-	[19:13:35] i have removed loadmodule webadmin from the config but still the webadmin is reachable [19:13:35]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Dessa	[19:13:53] Zarthus: how do you want the date to be displayed? [19:13:53]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Zarthus	[19:15:43] Dessa: I don't really mind, but I suppose for user friendliness the 00 Mon 2016 would be the most readable [19:15:43]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	DarthGandalf	[20:02:51] Zarthus: it could just be sortable table, with clickable header to change sorting [20:02:51]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Dessa	[20:03:24] DarthGandalf: it doesn't work well with dates.. [20:03:24]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	DarthGandalf	[20:04:39] Even ISO 8601 dates? [20:04:39]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	DarthGandalf	[20:05:15] 2016-09-23 is sorted lexicographically like a string [20:05:15]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Dessa	[20:05:34] i fixed it now. [20:05:34]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Dessa	[20:06:00] added <span style="display:none">&{{#expr:3e11+{{#time:U|..}}}}</span> infront of each date [20:06:00]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Dessa	[20:06:24] i didn't try to change the date format back though :p [20:06:24]
2016-09-23 12:21:12	Dessa	[20:06:44] the decending sorting was broken without this anyway. [20:06:44]

2016-09-23 12:21:12	Zarthus	[20:41:50] i'm kind of busy right now, but if you can put the things the table asks for in here i can add it later /someone else can add it when they see it [20:41:50]

2016-09-24 00:33:57	midnightmagic	[10:06:17] Hello ZNC people. I am piecing together code logic slowly but perhaps it's easier to simply ask -- the last little while my ZNC has been informing me that there was a timeout so it's disconnecting -- and it promptly disconnects me from the IRC daemon and reconnects. However, it looks like the socket timeout: SetTimeout(CIRCNetwork::NO_TRAFFIC_TIMEOUT, TMO_READ);  -- is unlimited from znc's perspective. [10:06:17]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	midnightmagic	[10:06:23] Why is it then disconnecting me from freenode? [10:06:23]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	midnightmagic	[10:09:44] Or I guess.. "why might it be disconnecting me from freenode" :-) [10:09:44]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	Zarthus	[10:10:54] midnightmagic: it's worth noting freenode has been having network connectivity issues from their side [10:10:54]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	Zarthus	[10:11:18] It's not always znc thinking "hey, I think I'm timing out", it's usually the server saying  "hey, you're not responding to my pings, you've timed out. We're closing the socket" [10:11:18]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	midnightmagic	[10:26:02] Zarthus: is it possible that a server operator is disconnecting people and this is somehow being registered as a "Quit"? [10:26:02]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	Zarthus	[10:26:14] the quit message is not always relevant [10:26:14]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	midnightmagic	[10:26:20] Zarthus: In this case, the quit message looks like this, from the perspective of ..  oh. [10:26:20]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	Zarthus	[10:26:38] and no, freenode's staff are not disconnecting you [10:26:38]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	midnightmagic	[10:26:48] :-) [10:26:48]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	Zarthus	[10:26:56] i'm heavily betting on network problems from freenode's side, because that's what the recent events have shown to be the case [10:26:56]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	midnightmagic	[10:27:37] Zarthus: *status says: <*status> IRC connection timed out.  Reconnecting... <*status> Disconnected from IRC. Reconnecting... <*status> Connected! [10:27:37]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	midnightmagic	[10:28:07] The znc message that says "IRC connection timed out" is in exactly one place, in the socket ::Timeout() method. [10:28:07]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	midnightmagic	[10:28:52] Me too, but if I can correct my disconnects just by telling znc to ignore timeouts or increase that timeout to something longer, I figure. . . [10:28:52]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	Zarthus	[10:29:31] that's not going to fix it [10:29:31]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	Zarthus	[10:29:42] just deal with it and reconnect, it's not really that problematic [10:29:42]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	midnightmagic	[10:30:21] Zarthus: in the grand scheme of things, it's a total non-problem, I agree. :) But. well, you know, I want to understand what's actually going on, on some level too. [10:30:21]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	midnightmagic	[10:30:52] I have *raw on, and a tcpdump running. I guess that'll be enough. Thanks man, nice to bounce comments off someone at least. [10:30:52]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	Zarthus	[10:30:53] You send a PING to the server, the server remains silent. You do it again, server still remains silent. It indicates a connection problem so you reconnect [10:30:53]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	midnightmagic	[10:31:10] znc pings the server? [10:31:10]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	Zarthus	[10:31:17] i think it does, might be other way around [10:31:17]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	Zarthus	[10:31:25] if you stop receiving them the same problem occurs though [10:31:25]
2016-09-24 00:33:57	Andrio	[10:32:44] Most *clients* ping the server, anyway. [10:32:44]

2016-09-24 00:36:04	midnightmagic	Oh, I see. In RFC 2812, the PING is only sent from the server if it detects no activity for X time.
2016-09-24 00:37:27	midnightmagic	So watching *raw while chatting and sending comments to #znc isn't going to show any server-side pings, and won't generate a freenode timeout... :-)

2016-09-24 12:34:54	SporkWitch	but yeah, overall i wish it just ran android; MUCH better applications ecosystem, and as far as i can tell the only thing the chromebook does that android doesn't is native overlapping windows

2016-09-24 12:37:52	SporkWitch	works about 1000x better than the native ssh plugin (which doesn't even support keys, so far as i could tell before giving up), and a million times better than crosh lol

2016-09-24 12:40:52	SporkWitch	and i'm on the beta build of that, that the openkeychain dev has been workingon, so other than some seriously asinine design choices i'm still fighting with him on, it works great

2016-09-24 12:45:26	SporkWitch	i'm thinking i might pick up a 32GB SDHC card and see about getting a proper linux install running on this thing.  From my cursory searching it should work, my only concern is whether i'd have to fight to not lose the whole notebook/tablet mode switching and the touchscreen functionality

2016-09-24 14:41:56	MetaNova	I mean, if they had autoclearbuffers disabled and you logged in as them, you could retrieve them
2016-09-24 14:42:08	MetaNova	but that requires disabling that setting by hand prior

2016-09-24 15:11:36	Apport	hi
2016-09-24 15:12:27	Apport	just wondering how I go about making ZNC use my home ip address rather than the vhost ip address when I try to DCC a bot
2016-09-24 15:13:04	MetaNova	by default ZNC hands off the client IP address
2016-09-24 15:13:14	MetaNova	if DCC isn't working, it's likely a client issue
2016-09-24 15:13:18	Apport	ok
2016-09-24 15:13:23	SporkWitch	i can't help you, i've not mucked about with dcc in years, never mind with znc; more detail, in particular what you've tried and the symptoms you're seeing, would probably help
2016-09-24 15:13:34	MetaNova	the best way to use DCC is to not use DCC
2016-09-24 15:13:39	SporkWitch	^
2016-09-24 15:13:43	Apport	ok
2016-09-24 15:13:49	MetaNova	stupid broken outdated inconvenient POS
2016-09-24 15:13:55	SporkWitch	unfortunately some bots want it; eggbot springs to mind as REALLY wanting dcc for management
2016-09-24 15:14:00	Apport	so just telnet into bots if what you'd do?
2016-09-24 15:14:05	SporkWitch	(or at least it did the last i messed with it)
2016-09-24 15:14:19	MetaNova	if you're dealing with an eggdrop, just use telnet
2016-09-24 15:14:23	SporkWitch	Apport: _please_ tunnel that over ssh...
2016-09-24 15:14:49	 *	SporkWitch has seen way too many people in the last month using telnet to something other than localhost...

2016-09-24 21:37:55	ljc	funny thing is is that it's only just started doing it (without me having changed any settings for a while), since about a week or so ago

2016-09-25 01:19:05	nagetier	Mikaela: Ok, thanks, that helps me, I will inform myself
2016-09-25 01:19:20	@Mikaela	You're welcome

2016-09-25 01:45:00	EckyPtang	I keep trying to connect to other irc networks and ZNC each time says: Network (Snoonet) doesn't exist
2016-09-25 01:45:09	EckyPtang	Even though I named it like that in the ZNC panel
2016-09-25 01:45:42	EckyPtang	On Freenode it works fine, just not on other networks... can anyone go over the settings with me and see what the problem is?

2016-09-25 10:22:06	adrian17	hello, I have a weird problem after updating from 1.4 to 1.6.2. ZNC can't connect to one server anymore. When I connect, it just says "welcome to ZNC" and doesn't do anything more.
2016-09-25 10:22:42	adrian17	when I change the server to Freenode, it instantly connects to it. but with that server, there's nothing.
2016-09-25 10:23:56	MetaNova	adrian17: /msg *status connect
2016-09-25 10:24:48	adrian17	"Connecting..." and nothing else.
2016-09-25 10:25:20	adrian17	Connecting directly from Weechat works correctly.
2016-09-25 10:25:57	adrian17	I can give the hostname if you want to check it

2016-09-25 10:27:52	adrian17	damn
2016-09-25 10:28:09	MetaNova	can you connect from the ZNC host using a regular client, like irssi?
2016-09-25 10:28:23	adrian17	actually, I didn't try that

2016-09-25 15:04:46	stac	it makes the assumption that the command "PONG" will be the 2nd token (Token(1)) on the line
2016-09-25 15:05:23	stac	that's normally true of most irc servers since they include a prefix (ie. line starts with ":server.domain PONG")
2016-09-25 15:06:13	stac	the gitter server doesn't include the (optional) prefix so the message is exactly "PONG :irc.gitter.im"
2016-09-25 15:06:41	stac	so znc 1.6.3 doesn't recognize that as a PONG and then it fails to suppress it toward the client.
2016-09-25 15:10:12	stac	In 1.7.x/HEAD, the message parsing code is quite a bit better and deals with the prefix being optional and discards it before looking for the command

2016-09-25 17:31:40	stac	i have no idea.  only joining it to interact with a project that is using it.
2016-09-25 17:32:05	dx	i had moderate luck getting PRs merged in their irc bridge

2016-09-25 17:32:23	dx	the last one has been stuck for a few months :(. i'll rebase and poke them again
2016-09-25 17:33:10	stac	well, this one looks to be a znc bug triggered by the unusual (but valid) PONG format that their irc-bridge is using
2016-09-25 17:34:09	dx	valid enough to not be worth fixing on their side?
2016-09-25 17:34:35	stac	all i wanted to do was push some changes to the exabgp project... which led to joining gitter to talk to devs which led to PONGs leaking through znc

2016-09-25 17:34:54	stac	which led to chatting here

2016-09-26 06:18:24	SylvieLorxu	Hey everyone, I'm hit by #1291 on ZNC 1.6.3 (Fedora 24) with Weechat 1.5 as client. A described solution in https://github.com/znc/znc/issues/1291#issuecomment-231319558 is to run /znc reloadmod sasl but where do I actually run this? I figured I should just type "reloadmod sasl" in a chat with *status but that doesn't seem to do anything so I'm a bit lost here

2016-09-26 06:21:16	MetaNova	SylvieLorxu: '/znc' implies '/quote znc' which is the same as '/msg *status'
2016-09-26 06:22:22	SylvieLorxu	MetaNova: Thanks. In that case, "reloadmod sasl" in a chat with *status should work but typing "Verbose" in *sasl after doing that just returns "Verbose: true"
2016-09-26 06:22:22		[06:22]
2016-09-26 06:22:41	SylvieLorxu	Could it be the bug makes my attempt to check the value set it already?

2016-09-26 06:25:57	MetaNova	from my understanding of the bug, the 'verbose' argument doesn't actually take effect in turning verbose off, but upon initial loading, verbose is disabled (non-persistent across loadings), so the workaround to turn verbose off is to reload the module
2016-09-26 06:26:52	SylvieLorxu	Yeah, I'm just trying to check if it's really off after using reloadmod sasl, just to be sure, oh well, we'll see soon enough I suppose :P
2016-09-26 06:27:22	MetaNova	a reconnect would be the only way to test, I think
2016-09-26 06:28:11	SylvieLorxu	Seems a bit overkill to do again, but thanks for the suggestion

2016-09-26 21:42:13	jwitko	[21:40:45] I have attempted to run the service with the "-D" flag to get debug information but nothing additional is output [21:40:45]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[21:40:56] then you're doing something wrong [21:40:56]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[21:41:04] there is tons of output with znc -D [21:41:04]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[21:41:20] sounds like you didn't actually kill the process before running znc -D [21:41:20]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	jwitko	[21:42:31] well, I ran it as " /usr/bin/znc --datadir=/var/lib/znc -f -D" via systemd init file [21:42:31]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	jwitko	[21:42:39] and no additional output went to syslog,  but i can try it again [21:42:39]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[21:42:54] you need to call it by hand [21:42:54]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	jwitko	[22:06:21] MetaNova ok thanks I am debugging now. looks like a PEM error on my SSL cert [22:06:21]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	jwitko	[22:06:33] however the cert is copied directly from the letsencrypt directory [22:06:33]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	jwitko	[22:06:39] where it currently works fine on a nginx server [22:06:39]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[22:07:13] might want to reference http://wiki.znc.in/Signed_SSL_certificate#LetsEncrypt [22:07:13]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	jwitko	[22:08:59] awesome! [22:08:59]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	jwitko	[22:09:00] that worked [22:09:00]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	jwitko	[22:09:01] thank you [22:09:01]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[22:09:54] np [22:09:54]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	Hepar	[22:50:40] how to restart back znc from putty [22:50:40]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[22:52:56] Hepar: the command to run znc is 'znc' [22:52:56]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	Hepar	[22:54:40] but i try can't [22:54:40]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[22:55:43] how did you start it the first time? [22:55:43]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	Hepar	[22:55:54] login [22:55:54]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	Hepar	[22:56:04] username and password [22:56:04]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[22:57:37] I'm not sure what you're talking about anymore, you asked how to restart ZNC, and the command to do so is 'znc' [22:57:37]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[22:57:47] if you're talking about logging in, that's different [22:57:47]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	Hepar	[22:58:46] im ready logging [22:58:46]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	Hepar	[22:59:02] but my znc can't connect [22:59:02]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	Hepar	[22:59:13] Unable to connect to server (Connection refused) [22:59:13]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[22:59:31] is that a client error or a ZNC error? [22:59:31]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	Hepar	[23:00:41] znc not sure [23:00:41]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	Hepar	[23:00:53] but must something wrong in putty [23:00:53]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[23:01:18] I can't help you if you don't even know which program is causing the error [23:01:18]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[23:01:41] can you log into the server using putty? [23:01:41]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	Hepar	[23:01:59] yes [23:01:59]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[23:02:13] can you run ZNC? (type 'znc') [23:02:13]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	Hepar	[23:02:54] but comand not found [23:02:54]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[23:03:07] then how did you start ZNC the first time? [23:03:07]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[23:03:10] did you even install it? [23:03:10]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	Hepar	[23:03:34] yes [23:03:34]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	Hepar	[23:03:40] before that is running [23:03:40]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[23:04:06] then try the following: /bin/znc [23:04:06]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[23:04:08] or /usr/bin/znc [23:04:08]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[23:04:10] or /usr/local/bin/znc [23:04:10]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[23:04:24] one of those should work. why it's not in your path, I don't know [23:04:24]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	Hepar	[23:07:30] ok MetaNova problem solve [23:07:30]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[23:07:44] great [23:07:44]

2016-09-26 21:42:13	Hepar	[23:08:36] then ./znc [23:08:36]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[23:08:50] oh, you installed it to your user directory [23:08:50]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	MetaNova	[23:08:53] that's useful to remember [23:08:53]
2016-09-26 21:42:13	Hepar	[23:09:34] yeahh [23:09:34]

2016-09-27 04:55:53	Rocangus	Hello! I am a (-hopeless-) znc and ubuntu nob trying to set up a ZNC on a VPS running Ubuntu 16.04. I have managed to install znc and configures ssl so that the server responds and shows the default apache page on port 80 when connecting with SSL. However, despite having taken the .pem I made for the SSL and copied it both into ~./znc/znc.pem and into a znc.pem in the folder where I got all my .so-files after making
2016-09-27 04:55:54	Rocangus	and installing ZNC, ZNC refuses to find SSL being enabled.
2016-09-27 04:56:56	grawity	um
2016-09-27 04:57:11	grawity	"shows the default apache page on port 80 when connecting with SSL"
2016-09-27 04:57:16	grawity	there's quite a few things wrong with that
2016-09-27 04:57:24	grawity	port 80, for one
2016-09-27 04:57:32	grawity	even for HTTP, the SSL (HTTPS) port is 443
2016-09-27 04:57:36	grawity	apache, for another
2016-09-27 04:57:47	grawity	since when does apache have to do *anything* with znc?

2016-09-27 05:03:16	binia	could probably setup reverse proxy, thats how it can have something to do with znc
2016-09-27 05:03:24	grawity	yes, but
2016-09-27 05:03:37	grawity	if you're configuring znc, but somehow end up with the default apache page
2016-09-27 05:03:45	grawity	then your story is missing quite a few parts
2016-09-27 05:03:47	Rocangus	I literally got the VPS... 22 hours ago? I'm really new.
2016-09-27 05:04:02	binia	did you set port for znc?

2016-09-27 05:04:55	binia	ah so you can get no ssl but ssl not working
2016-09-27 05:04:57	grawity	how did you install ZNC in the first place?
2016-09-27 05:05:01	binia	^
2016-09-27 05:05:25	binia	nnormally znc sets up self signed ssl cert for ssl
2016-09-27 05:05:53	Rocangus	I went for the tarball option of 1.6.3.
2016-09-27 05:06:00	grawity	ah yeah I had this feeling
2016-09-27 05:06:12	grawity	you compiled it yourself, but didn't have libssl-dev (or equivalent) installed?
2016-09-27 05:06:19	binia	seems like it
2016-09-27 05:06:42	binia	still
2016-09-27 05:06:48	binia	if you have ssl certs on that machine
2016-09-27 05:07:07	binia	just make .pem fromit and add to znc directory
2016-09-27 05:07:21	Rocangus	Yeah, I do not have libssl-dev. This can be fixed...
2016-09-27 05:07:46	grawity	it must be present at compile time
2016-09-27 05:07:54	binia	well, if you about to use self signed cert, would recommend to use letsencrypt
2016-09-27 05:07:59	binia	at least get signed cert
2016-09-27 05:07:59	Rocangus	There, installed for the next update at least.
2016-09-27 05:08:59	Rocangus	letsencrypt installed, let me check the wiki for this part...
2016-09-27 05:09:36	grawity	letsencrypt won't help you much while znc lacks SSL support in general
2016-09-27 05:09:43	Rocangus	Ah, actually, there's a problem with letsencrypt. I do not have a domain just yet.

2016-09-27 05:43:13	Zarthus	the server, or znc
2016-09-27 05:43:33	znc|help|needed	probably server...
2016-09-27 05:43:46	Zarthus	"probably"
2016-09-27 05:43:57	Zarthus	find out which one it is. does connecting without znc prompt you for a password?
2016-09-27 05:44:30	znc|help|needed	yes.. when supply password set in --makeconf..  not allow to connect
2016-09-27 05:44:47	Zarthus	yes to connecting without znc prompting you for a password?
2016-09-27 05:45:31	znc|help|needed	nop.. connect trough znc ask for password.. try several times but no results..
2016-09-27 05:45:42	Zarthus	read the notice znc sends with that
2016-09-27 05:46:03	znc|help|needed	password need for connect.. says.
2016-09-27 05:46:09	Zarthus	so do that
2016-09-27 05:46:14	znc|help|needed	so i set the password and nothing.
2016-09-27 05:46:19	Zarthus	"nothing"
2016-09-27 05:46:31	Zarthus	Is it saying you're using the correct password?
2016-09-27 05:47:11	znc|help|needed	yes.. i set simple passwd and prompt for passwd... when supply passwd returns to ask for pass..
2016-09-27 05:47:30	Zarthus	it's saying "the password is correct"?
2016-09-27 05:47:51	znc|help|needed	nop.. prompt for passwd again and again...
2016-09-27 05:47:57	Zarthus	so then it's probably wrong.

2016-09-27 05:50:22	binia	i usually when installing znc, ading only some basic connection without any passwords and such
2016-09-27 05:50:31	binia	then adding all networks thru web admin
2016-09-27 05:50:33	binia	never failed
2016-09-27 05:50:48	binia	sometimes gotta add ssl fingerprint in irc client thats all
2016-09-27 05:51:05	binia	in=through
2016-09-27 05:51:28	znc|help|needed	Yes.. this is idea but --makeconf says user and password needed.. when i erase from config get error.. and try to connect 6667 port with no ssl.. and not.
2016-09-27 05:51:42	binia	well, its user and pass for znc
2016-09-27 05:51:56	binia	not for the irc server
2016-09-27 05:52:28	znc|help|needed	yes..  but i supply correct and not connect to irc server so ask again for pass..
2016-09-27 05:52:42	binia	i thing you missing the point here
2016-09-27 05:52:45	binia	think
2016-09-27 05:52:47	binia	sorry
2016-09-27 05:53:00	binia	you set znc
2016-09-27 05:53:10	binia	then go to the web page and add networks
2016-09-27 05:53:21	binia	in that networks you set irc server with password to connect to it
2016-09-27 05:53:39	binia	then you just connect in irc client to znc which is already connected to irc servers
2016-09-27 05:53:42	binia	so
2016-09-27 05:53:44	binia	that said

2016-09-27 05:55:29	binia	yes, if irc server has password, its not related to what --makeconf asks for

2016-09-27 22:59:37	KindOne	[23:09:53] no, like the old json version, you could merge multiple db's [23:09:53]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	MuffinMedic	[23:10:47] What do you mean? Unfortunately, this one doesnt have anything as far as touching the old JSON format. [23:10:47]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	MuffinMedic	[23:10:55] you mean an import/export feature? [23:10:55]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	KindOne	[23:11:56] yeah, import/export [23:11:56]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	MuffinMedic	[23:12:11] It doesn't as of now but I can look into adding that in. [23:12:11]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	MetaNova	[23:15:19] MuffinMedic: same failure [23:15:19]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	MetaNova	[23:15:36] not really sure what's going on, the errors indicate a python3.5 path, I have 3.4 installed [23:15:36]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	MuffinMedic	[23:16:03] Do you have 3.5 installed as well? [23:16:03]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	MetaNova	[23:16:30] nope [23:16:30]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	MuffinMedic	[23:16:32] cause it seems like that is what ZNC is using [23:16:32]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	Rocangus	[23:18:04] Channel conversations are being inconsistently logged. Some channels are fully logged while other channels are not... Log module is on and active. :S [23:18:04]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	MetaNova	[23:18:31] aha, I think I found the problem [23:18:31]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	MetaNova	[23:22:47] yeah, that was a PEBCAK [23:22:47]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	MuffinMedic	[23:23:40] LOL [23:23:40]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	Rocangus	[23:24:34] Meanwhile, I found the reason for my own woes... Some directories were created as root using sftp which meant znc couldn't access them. [23:24:34]

2016-09-27 22:59:37	MetaNova	[23:42:12] sure do [23:42:12]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	MuffinMedic	[23:42:32] Nice. Glad it worked well. That's a bit hard to test out with limited sample data (a lot, but just 1 user0 [23:42:32]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	MetaNova	[23:42:46] imported over 50k records without incident [23:42:46]

2016-09-27 22:59:37	MuffinMedic	[23:43:40] I should do a user-wide stats. Right now they are just for the network. [23:43:40]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	MuffinMedic	[01:49:03] Oh MetaNova , KindOne - I want to add wildcard searches as well at some point too. [01:49:03]

2016-09-27 22:59:37	ZNC-Linker	[07:23:07] mib, ZNC is free software. Just install and use it. If you wanted a free BNC account instead, go somewhere else. http://wiki.znc.in/Providers may be a good start. [07:23:07]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	mib	[07:41:09] thanks [07:41:09]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	sleo	[07:52:41] hmm, we should change that "go somewhere else" to "try your luck elsewhere" to be less mean [07:52:41]
2016-09-27 22:59:37	mib	[07:54:24] what is BNC ?? [07:54:24]

2016-09-28 04:18:55	de-facto	currently im using socat to proxy localhost tcp to socks4a tor onion address
2016-09-28 04:19:16	de-facto	but there has to be a more direct way (socks5 support in znc?)
2016-09-28 04:19:24	de-facto	or better proxy than socat?
2016-09-28 04:20:28	Lartza	http://wiki.znc.in/Tor
2016-09-28 04:20:53	Lartza	And no there is no proxy support
2016-09-28 04:21:18	de-facto	hmm but running the whole znc under proxychains seems a bit of a hack to me
2016-09-28 04:22:10	Lartza	There are also other solutions like that, but that is the only way
2016-09-28 04:23:36	Lartza	I mean you could tor the whole machine with iptables, or possibly just znc?
2016-09-28 04:24:27	de-facto	yeah i thought about using redsocks or such
2016-09-28 04:25:21	de-facto	but ideally i only want to proxy the outgoing irc connection of znc
2016-09-28 04:25:33	Lartza	then wrap ZNC
2016-09-28 04:26:23	de-facto	will it be able to function behind a nginx proxy then still (i mean if i wrap the whole znc process)?
2016-09-28 04:26:36	de-facto	for webui that is

2016-09-28 10:32:36	keigel2001	hey, i'm looking for a znc-module that can announce/write things. many irc-bots have this functionality. they spawn on a port where i can send them messages they write on a channel (f.e. with php). i know i can just run a bot and connect it with znc.
2016-09-28 10:33:30	keigel2001	but i'm looking for a znc-module, that has this functionality. is there anything around already? might be easy to code, but i'm not yet familiar with znc developing

2016-09-28 10:41:37	keigel2001	channel). then i could send it directly to znc and don't need a bot.

2016-09-28 11:28:28	MetaNova	sam-lap: by default, that's what ZNC does, out-of-the-box
2016-09-28 11:28:42	MetaNova	are you saying you want ZNC to replay lines you've already seen?
2016-09-28 11:29:41	MetaNova	because ZNC will normally replay what you missed, then clear those lines, meaning if you disconnect then reconnect, you won't see the same playback as before
2016-09-28 11:29:48	sam-lap	just when i connect to the znc ( i want to see the last X lines from the channels during the time i was off

2016-09-29 00:46:15	***	Buffer Playback...
2016-09-29 00:46:15	DarthGandalf	[07:32:33] keigel2001: schat or dcc or bouncedcc modules open sockets AFAIR [07:32:33]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	DarthGandalf	[07:33:55] But ZNC-Linker is easier than that - it just gets IRC connections from github, and accepts/relays messages as usual ZNC does. [07:33:55]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Janko	[08:39:31] is it possible to always get backlog, even if I have one client online already? [08:39:31]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:41:46] yes, you'll need to disable AutoClearChanBuffer and AutoClearQueryBuffer [08:41:46]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Uber	[08:42:29] Janko you could use clientbuffer (each client gets their own buffer) or just disable AutoClearBuffer [08:42:29]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:42:50] clientbuffer relies on autoclearbuffer being disabled anyway [08:42:50]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:43:32] [[clientbuffer]] and [[playback]] are basically how to manage the buffers after that point [08:43:32]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	ZNC-Linker	[08:43:32] http://wiki.znc.in/clientbuffer http://wiki.znc.in/playback [08:43:32]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Uber	[08:43:49] yeah.. but would have different end results than just disabling and not using clientbuffer [08:43:49]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:45:41] Uber: my understanding of clientbuffer is for the channel activity to be cached for multiple clients [08:45:41]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:45:57] each client won't receive repeat messages, though, which sounds like what they're after [08:45:57]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:46:05] "always get backlog" [08:46:05]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:46:41] although .. they could just be looking for multiple clients to see the same thing, not necessarily see the same thing every time (activity which has already been viewed by each) [08:46:41]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:47:36] Janko: the disabling of the autoclear settings is a must, but depending on how you want the backlog handled, you may or may not want additional modules for backlog management [08:47:36]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Uber	[08:47:38] guess it would depend one what is meant by "backlog" [08:47:38]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:47:46] yeah [08:47:46]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Uber	[08:48:36] with clientbuffer connecting with 2nd client the current convo would be played back upto set buffer limit -- instead of without clientbuffer connecting with 2nd client there would be not channel history played back [08:48:36]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Janko	[08:49:26] Thanks... Well I need history played back when connecting with another client while one is already connected [08:49:26]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:50:09] if you disconnect from that 2nd client and connect with it again, do you need to see everything it saw previously, or just the difference in activity from the last time it connected? [08:50:09]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:50:49] if you want to see everything again (plus what's new), then your quest is over by just disabling the autoclear variables [08:50:49]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:51:01] if you only want to see what's new, then you need to use [[clientbuffer]] [08:51:01]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	ZNC-Linker	[08:51:01] http://wiki.znc.in/clientbuffer [08:51:01]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Janko	[08:51:39] either is fine - but I'd rather just see everything again [08:51:39]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:52:17] well, there you go [08:52:17]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:52:24] just disable AutoClearChanBuffer and AutoClearQueryBuffer [08:52:24]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:52:44] you can do that from the *controlpanel module through IRC, or log in through the webadmin interface to do it [08:52:44]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Janko	[08:53:37] set AutoClearQueryBuffer Janko off : Error: Unknown variable [08:53:37]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:55:25] <MetaNova> set AutoClearChanBuffer zero-one on [08:55:25]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:55:25] <*controlpanel> AutoClearChanBuffer = true [08:55:25]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:55:39] are you sure you have *controlpanel loaded? what ZNC version? [08:55:39]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Janko	[08:56:07] setting AutoClearChanBuffer worked, just not Query buffer [08:56:07]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:56:57] must be using an older version [08:56:57]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:57:03] <MetaNova> set AutoClearQueryBuffer zero-one on [08:57:03]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:57:03] <*controlpanel> AutoClearQueryBuffer = true [08:57:03]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Janko	[08:57:25] Yeah, ZNC 1.4 from debian repo [08:57:25]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:57:38] you may want to consider upgrading [08:57:38]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[08:58:31] are you using Debian or Ubuntu? [08:58:31]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Janko	[09:00:18] I have stable Debian 8 (jessie) [09:00:18]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[09:01:00] ah [09:01:00]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[09:05:12] you would need to append 'jessie-backports' to the man deb mirror in your /etc/apt/sources.list [09:05:12]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[09:05:27] jessie-backports has znc_1.6.2 [09:05:27]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Janko	[09:08:43] I already have backports... let's try installing znc from there... [09:08:43]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[09:09:03] I'd imagine an 'apt-get update' and 'apt-get upgrade' might be in order [09:09:03]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Janko	[09:14:33] successfully installed znc 1.6.2, and disabled AutoClear{Chan,Query}Buffer [09:14:33]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Janko	[09:15:30] But I don't get any history printed when I connect through second client :( [09:15:30]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Janko	[09:16:58] Oh, wait, I do [09:16:58]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	Janko	[09:17:34] Looks like it works, thanks [09:17:34]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[09:17:37] cache isn't persistent across instance restarts [09:17:37]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[09:17:41] so, it'd take a moment [09:17:41]
2016-09-29 00:46:15	MetaNova	[09:17:44] Janko: you're welcome [09:17:44]

2016-09-29 13:56:40	KindOne	so... ask it
2016-09-29 13:56:52	SoBlindWolf	I got ZNC setup I have all my certificate information in a znc-domain.pem and it sees my *.domain.com, .domain.com but I am missing something because I am using cloudflare to do my dns and I want it to be irc.domain.com
2016-09-29 13:57:07	SoBlindWolf	Sorry was working on something my bad
2016-09-29 13:57:20	SoBlindWolf	irc.domain.com:1337

2016-09-29 13:58:17	SoBlindWolf	Oh its the connection between cloudflare and the dedi...
2016-09-29 13:59:23	SoBlindWolf	it times out when I do https://irc.domain.com:1337 but when I do https://ip.add.ress:1337 it shows security issue because it needs to go through cloudflares dns system
2016-09-29 13:59:56	MetaNova	so, how exactly is this a ZNC issue?
2016-09-29 14:00:28	MetaNova	still trying to understand what the actual issue is
2016-09-29 14:00:39	SoBlindWolf	Eh... good question? I guess its not really but I was wanting to see if you guys could provide any info on how you guys have it setup if anyone does
2016-09-29 14:01:20	SoBlindWolf	Do I need a virtualhost to listen on 1337 to irc.domain.com?
2016-09-29 14:01:42	MetaNova	I don't know how you have your dns set up
2016-09-29 14:01:48	MetaNova	so, no real answer to that
2016-09-29 14:01:59	MetaNova	on a regular configuration, say, on a simple VPS, no
2016-09-29 14:02:01	MetaNova	no you don't

2016-09-29 14:02:33	MetaNova	and if you've already read http://wiki.znc.in/Signed_SSL_certificate and are still having issues, it sounds like you need to contact cloudflare about what you're trying to do
2016-09-29 14:03:14	SoBlindWolf	Okay thank you
2016-09-29 14:03:22	SoBlindWolf	Sorry about that...
2016-09-29 14:03:29	MetaNova	no worries
2016-09-29 14:03:31	SoBlindWolf	Thank you for your time :) and have a nice night.
2016-09-29 14:03:33	MetaNova	best of luck
2016-09-29 14:04:28	MetaNova	to be honest it sounds like you just need to create a simple A record
2016-09-29 14:04:39	MetaNova	but not having used cloudflare, I'm not sure how to go about doing that

2016-09-29 14:05:56	SoBlindWolf	Its really simple for the rest of the stuff I have setup but its just ugh...
2016-09-29 14:06:11	SoBlindWolf	Imma work on this and give ya feedback
2016-09-29 14:07:24	MetaNova	I mean, for example, with my domain, which I administer via namecheap, I'd just create a single A record by the name of 'irc' and point it to my IP address, which would make irc.domain.com accessible
2016-09-29 14:07:41	MetaNova	assuming domain.com was my domain
2016-09-29 14:10:35	SoBlindWolf	What about the port number?
2016-09-29 14:10:35		[14:10]
2016-09-29 14:10:39	SoBlindWolf	and do you have ssl?
2016-09-29 14:16:00		[14:10]
2016-09-29 14:18:43	MetaNova	the port number is fine as long as it's >1024
2016-09-29 14:18:46	MetaNova	and yes, I do

2016-09-29 14:41:01	kay4	Don't shoot me.. but running znc 1.2 -- is there a way to recover my own stored nickserv password that's encrypted in the config? when it sends the command to the server upon connection, i can't see it in the status window of my client as being a message sent to nickserv.
2016-09-29 14:41:41	KindOne	kay4: what? znc does not encrypt the nickserv password...
2016-09-29 14:42:19	KindOne	its in the ~/znc/users/USERNAME/networks/NETWORK/moddata/nickserv/.registry

2016-09-29 14:42:27	kay4	oh.. let me check
2016-09-29 14:42:40	MetaNova	just because it doesn't show you it sending it doesn't mean it's encrypted
2016-09-29 14:42:53	MetaNova	"encrypted"
2016-09-29 14:42:54	kay4	i hear ya on that, didn't think of it being someplace other than znc.conf tbh
