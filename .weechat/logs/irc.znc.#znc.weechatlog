2016-09-18 00:44:13	Zarthus	I don't think you can, pretty sure providers manually edit the source code for that
2016-09-18 00:44:26	Zarthus	other than the good old asking them "please don't edit your networks"
2016-09-18 00:45:06	Zarthus	I don't think ZNC was designed with much of the idea of letting strangers on your bouncer, permissions are lacking in that regard.
2016-09-18 00:45:16	nextloop	does znc bind to it's default port for outgoing connections? Zarthus

2016-09-18 00:45:56	nextloop	okay. so i can limit it on a firewall basis maybe
2016-09-18 00:46:03	Zarthus	well if they trust you to host their bouncer they trust you with their entire IRC career :)

2016-09-18 00:46:53	Zarthus	it doesn't always apply in the real world because people are stupid, but theoretically speaking you guys have a strong enough bond to let politely asking be sufficient
2016-09-18 00:48:08	Uber	Just setup the User/Network for them and don't tell them the IP:Port of the webadmin.
2016-09-18 00:48:19	Zarthus	Uber: that doesn't work. And why would you?
2016-09-18 00:48:37	Uber	Why would you what?
2016-09-18 00:48:48	Zarthus	why would you not tell them about the webadmin
2016-09-18 00:48:54	Uber	Why would they need it?
2016-09-18 00:48:58	Zarthus	it's one of the more userfriendly features for configuring ZNC
2016-09-18 00:49:17	Uber	Once they connect via client they don't need to configure anything thing else
2016-09-18 00:49:45	Zarthus	it'd be better to disable the webadmin entirely if you follow that philosophy
2016-09-18 00:49:53	Zarthus	nothing prevents you from running /znc addservr, delserver
2016-09-18 00:50:05	Zarthus	hiding the webadmin does nothing
2016-09-18 00:50:17	Uber	unless you set the Max network to 1
2016-09-18 00:50:41	Zarthus	yeah, but what stops them from editing the existing networ
2016-09-18 00:50:44	Uber	They could then change the network
2016-09-18 00:50:56	Uber	but still would be only be limited to 1 at a time
2016-09-18 00:51:01	Zarthus	if you don't trust them not to mess with the settings, I just wouldn't provide them with a bouncer.
2016-09-18 00:51:48	Uber	Guess that would be a matter of opinion
2016-09-18 00:52:07	Uber	If you want to provide a bouncer service at a limited capacity
2016-09-18 00:52:13	Lartza	My friends don't touch their settings if I tell them to
2016-09-18 00:52:18	Lartza	Otherwise they'd get the boot
2016-09-18 00:52:35	Zarthus	I think if you let people on your bouncer you don't trust on an unmodified ZNC you're making a mistake.

2016-09-18 01:12:57	Zarthus	I assumed that because I assumed you knew your own username.
2016-09-18 01:13:03	Andrio	If it's only a wrong password, you'd get a PM saying so.
2016-09-18 01:14:12	Uber	Zarthus I mean you can enter anything in the box User "Sugar" Pass "Bean" and it will always return the output "Invlid Login" because there is not output
2016-09-18 01:15:26	Zarthus	yes
2016-09-18 01:15:27	Uber	no other output*
2016-09-18 01:15:32	Zarthus	but is it so wrong for me to think you know what you're doing

2016-09-18 01:20:59	Filiaes	but what's the problem to unload webadmin and controlpanel ... a user wont be able to configure the bot anymore, or?
2016-09-18 01:22:23	Filiaes	if there is really a need to get a non trusted user access for the bot i would handle it in that way
2016-09-18 01:23:17	Filiaes	then chroot the bot and run it exclusivly for non trusted user
2016-09-18 01:23:53	Filiaes	exclusively*

2016-09-18 09:13:52	Zarthus	[11:01:19] on 1.6.x and 1.7 [11:01:19]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:01:31] 1.6.3 [11:01:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	@Mikaela	[11:01:34] Username should also be case sensitive [11:01:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	@Mikaela	[11:02:02] Normal users can login into webadmin AFAIK and do for me [11:02:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Andrio	[11:02:06] Mine can. [11:02:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:02:17] maybe mine is just broken [11:02:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Zarthus	[11:02:28] I think its PEBCAK [11:02:28]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:02:39] PEBCAK ? [11:02:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Zarthus	[11:02:46] An user error. [11:02:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:02:46] English only, sorry [11:02:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	@Mikaela	[11:04:06] Problem Error(?) Between Chair And Keyboard [11:04:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Zarthus	[11:04:11] exists [11:04:11]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	@Mikaela	[11:04:23] Thanks [11:04:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:04:43] Well Guess it would be between Chrome and LastPass [11:04:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Zarthus	[11:05:32] no, PEBCAK explicitly indicates it is not a hardware nor a software problem. [11:05:32]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:06:21] Well then I guess your thought would be incorrect since I'm not entering the data into the input boxd [11:06:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Uber	[11:06:23] box. [11:06:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:52	Zarthus	[11:07:05] I'll not continue this discussion. [11:07:05]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Andrio	[11:07:18] Can you log in via IRC with that password? [11:07:18]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	mB-PiBox	[11:07:47] I'm logged in now with it [11:07:47]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Andrio	[11:07:58] Uber, can you log in via IRC with that password? [11:07:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	mB-PiBox	[11:08:17] I answered you Andrio [11:08:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Andrio	[11:08:23] mm [11:08:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Uber	[11:09:27] Well I'm not worried if the user(s) can log in or not. Wasn't my question/issue. [11:09:27]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Uber	[11:12:20] and Zarthus to make the assumption that the password is entered incorrectly because it says "Invalid Login" is not accurate; as there is not alternative output coded such as "user doesn't exist [11:12:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Andrio	[11:12:38] Hm [11:12:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Andrio	[11:12:49] Are you currently connected to IRC with the same account on the same ZNC? [11:12:49]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Zarthus	[11:12:57] I assumed that because I assumed you knew your own username. [11:12:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Andrio	[11:13:03] If it's only a wrong password, you'd get a PM saying so. [11:13:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Uber	[11:14:12] Zarthus I mean you can enter anything in the box User "Sugar" Pass "Bean" and it will always return the output "Invlid Login" because there is not output [11:14:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Zarthus	[11:15:26] yes [11:15:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Uber	[11:15:27] no other output* [11:15:27]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Zarthus	[11:15:32] but is it so wrong for me to think you know what you're doing [11:15:32]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Filiaes	[11:20:59] but what's the problem to unload webadmin and controlpanel ... a user wont be able to configure the bot anymore, or? [11:20:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Filiaes	[11:22:23] if there is really a need to get a non trusted user access for the bot i would handle it in that way [11:22:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Filiaes	[11:23:17] then chroot the bot and run it exclusivly for non trusted user [11:23:17]

2016-09-18 09:13:53	thinkpad	[11:33:47] why are there global and user settings with seemingly the same options? [11:33:47]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	knolle	[11:45:00] because you might want global defaults and still give users the ability to change them [11:45:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	_MaDaLiN_	[13:03:23] awaynick on detach? Has znc this ? [13:03:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	JeDa	[13:08:05] _MaDaLiN_: that's been removed since 1.4 [13:08:05]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	JeDa	[13:08:41] you could get it from GitHub and compile/install it yourself though [13:08:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	JeDa	[13:09:04] but it isn't supported by ZNC developers (nor half people in this net probably) [13:09:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	_MaDaLiN_	[13:10:33] Ok i compiled the module .. i got .so file moves it to modules dir but when i use /znc loadmodule i still get that message that awaynick is retired from this version [13:10:33]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	_MaDaLiN_	[13:10:38] How can i get rid of that [13:10:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	hx0requiem	[13:24:49] Hello [13:24:49]

2016-09-18 09:13:53	MetaNova	[13:29:01] _MaDaLiN_: we don't encourage or condone the use of that module [13:29:01]
2016-09-18 09:13:53	Jay2k1	[13:44:15] sarek: that, or patch it yourself if you can, or don't use the module ;) [13:44:15]

2016-09-18 13:24:38	Zarthus	[11:04:11] exists [11:04:11]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@Mikaela	[11:04:23] Thanks [11:04:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:04:43] Well Guess it would be between Chrome and LastPass [11:04:43]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Zarthus	[11:05:32] no, PEBCAK explicitly indicates it is not a hardware nor a software problem. [11:05:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:06:21] Well then I guess your thought would be incorrect since I'm not entering the data into the input boxd [11:06:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:06:23] box. [11:06:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Zarthus	[11:07:05] I'll not continue this discussion. [11:07:05]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Andrio	[11:07:18] Can you log in via IRC with that password? [11:07:18]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	mB-PiBox	[11:07:47] I'm logged in now with it [11:07:47]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Andrio	[11:07:58] Uber, can you log in via IRC with that password? [11:07:58]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	mB-PiBox	[11:08:17] I answered you Andrio [11:08:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Andrio	[11:08:23] mm [11:08:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:09:27] Well I'm not worried if the user(s) can log in or not. Wasn't my question/issue. [11:09:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:12:20] and Zarthus to make the assumption that the password is entered incorrectly because it says "Invalid Login" is not accurate; as there is not alternative output coded such as "user doesn't exist [11:12:20]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Andrio	[11:12:38] Hm [11:12:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Andrio	[11:12:49] Are you currently connected to IRC with the same account on the same ZNC? [11:12:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Zarthus	[11:12:57] I assumed that because I assumed you knew your own username. [11:12:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Andrio	[11:13:03] If it's only a wrong password, you'd get a PM saying so. [11:13:03]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:14:12] Zarthus I mean you can enter anything in the box User "Sugar" Pass "Bean" and it will always return the output "Invlid Login" because there is not output [11:14:12]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Zarthus	[11:15:26] yes [11:15:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Uber	[11:15:27] no other output* [11:15:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Zarthus	[11:15:32] but is it so wrong for me to think you know what you're doing [11:15:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Filiaes	[11:20:59] but what's the problem to unload webadmin and controlpanel ... a user wont be able to configure the bot anymore, or? [11:20:59]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Filiaes	[11:22:23] if there is really a need to get a non trusted user access for the bot i would handle it in that way [11:22:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Filiaes	[11:23:17] then chroot the bot and run it exclusivly for non trusted user [11:23:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Filiaes	[11:23:53] exclusively* [11:23:53]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	thinkpad	[11:33:47] why are there global and user settings with seemingly the same options? [11:33:47]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	knolle	[11:45:00] because you might want global defaults and still give users the ability to change them [11:45:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_MaDaLiN_	[13:03:23] awaynick on detach? Has znc this ? [13:03:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	JeDa	[13:08:05] _MaDaLiN_: that's been removed since 1.4 [13:08:05]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	JeDa	[13:08:41] you could get it from GitHub and compile/install it yourself though [13:08:41]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	JeDa	[13:09:04] but it isn't supported by ZNC developers (nor half people in this net probably) [13:09:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_MaDaLiN_	[13:10:33] Ok i compiled the module .. i got .so file moves it to modules dir but when i use /znc loadmodule i still get that message that awaynick is retired from this version [13:10:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	_MaDaLiN_	[13:10:38] How can i get rid of that [13:10:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	hx0requiem	[13:24:49] Hello [13:24:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Cthulhux	[13:27:04] hi [13:27:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	MetaNova	[13:29:01] _MaDaLiN_: we don't encourage or condone the use of that module [13:29:01]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	Jay2k1	[13:44:15] sarek: that, or patch it yourself if you can, or don't use the module ;) [13:44:15]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	KindOne	[20:03:59] Good news everyone! freenode now supports SASL EXTERNAL! [20:03:59]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@kerio	[20:04:38] we did it \o/ [20:04:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	vectr0n	[20:04:49] haven't they for awhile now? o0 [20:04:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@kerio	[20:04:50] honestly *cert needs a way to generate a cert [20:04:50]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@kerio	[20:04:53] vectr0n: nope [20:04:53]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@kerio	[20:05:06] only recently, with the readdition of the tor hidden service [20:05:06]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	vectr0n	[20:05:41] just thought they had, my mistake :) [20:05:41]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@kerio	[20:05:49] they had certfp for a long while [20:05:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	vectr0n	[20:05:59] aha thats what i am thinking of, lol [20:05:59]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	@kerio	[20:06:15] but it was the somewhat disappointing implementation that causes nickserv to yell at you and then go "yep ty for telling me your password" immediately [20:06:15]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	vectr0n	[20:07:09] it's been so long since ive had to add anything to znc so networks melt together at times, lol [20:07:09]
2016-09-18 13:24:38	KindOne	[20:08:15] Now to do sasl external by telnet! [20:08:15]
