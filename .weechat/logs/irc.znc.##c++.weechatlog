2016-09-15 21:31:07	ville	[21:31:01] having signed and unsgined was a silly distinction. having unchecked and checked integer types would have been a better one. because presumably you could make the checked one generic so you define the bounds and the operation that occurs at the bounds for checking.

2016-09-15 22:03:01	ville	of course had c++ gone that route people would complain that it's too fuzzy what underlying type and assembly gets generated. if you define 0,255 range but there's no 8 bit type and so on

2016-09-15 22:05:32	cbreak	ville: uint8_t is better than unsigned char because of precision

2016-09-16 02:17:57	cbreak	why bother?
2016-09-16 02:18:02	cbreak	uniform int distribution is better.
2016-09-16 02:18:15	kline	its just sad to see 10m run time compared to fractions of a second with rust ( http://sprunge.us/gQFK )

2016-09-16 02:18:54	urdh	kline, you'll get a skew anyway so you should figure out if that makes your simulation less accurate
2016-09-16 02:18:59	kline	cbreak, no
2016-09-16 02:19:41	kline	cbreak, https://pulham.info/static/img/no_flags.png suggests about 75% of the runtime is in the generator, with about 25% in the distribution, and a tiny fraction in business logic

2016-09-16 02:21:51	kline	even with -O3 its taking far longer than it intuitively should - similar rust code runs in fractions of the time

2016-09-16 02:22:32	kline	cbreak, cool, maybe im just doing it wrong with the profiler, since with -g -pg and -O3, i get this as my profiler output: https://pulham.info/static/img/flags.png

2016-09-16 02:23:24	cbreak	it gives per-line output. Of course quite unreliable with all the optimizations compilers can do, but more than yours :)
2016-09-16 02:23:26	ville	Oxyd: well your recollection is as good as mine then
2016-09-16 02:23:29	flux	though I suppose these tools aren't very helpful in finding what happens inside your function

2016-09-16 08:27:09	bsdbeard	right, thats what i was asking in the last question
2016-09-16 08:27:19	w3z	and as soon as you take rhs by & or && youll need to check against self assignment
2016-09-16 08:27:41	bsdbeard	it seems its better to have one to reduce code complexity if constructing a new node cache isnt a big issue
2016-09-16 08:27:51	bsdbeard	that is one operator=()

2016-09-16 12:15:44	nolyc	STL can mean: (1) C++ standard library; (2) the library Stepanov designed; (3) the parts of [1] based on [2]; (4) specific vendor implementations of [1], [2], or [3]; (5) the underlying principles of [2]; (6) The parts of [1] only in C++03; (7) Stephan T. Lavavej. So, the term is highly ambiguous. If you meant [1] and insist on abbreviating, stdlib is a better choice.

2016-09-16 16:25:06	doppel	okay, so if the array is supposed to be declared when the user passes in NULL, why does the declaration of the array precede the place where this is checked?
2016-09-16 16:26:20	SoItBegins	As I had it, the array is declared either way, because of the copy (either current_array is declared and filled, or declared and copied). If I didn’t need to copy, I’d change the declaration to only occur when NULL was passed in, because then it would only be declared in that circumstance.

2016-09-16 17:09:52	gp5st	constrain and check the stack size*
2016-09-16 17:10:34	gp5st	however, I'd also like to avoid generating code for each layer in the stack, but I'm stuck on that part if anyone has feedback on how to go about that

2016-09-17 11:14:55	wolf_1	so I have a function that sends packets to a server
2016-09-17 11:15:02	wolf_1	and I have another function
2016-09-17 11:15:05	wolf_1	that calls that function
2016-09-17 11:15:17	wolf_1	and uses it to send console input to the server
2016-09-17 11:15:28	wolf_1	but whenever I use it to send the console input
2016-09-17 11:15:40	wolf_1	if I were to send this: "hello bye hi"
2016-09-17 11:15:48	wolf_1	it would send "hello\n bye\n hi\n"
2016-09-17 11:15:56	wolf_1	but if I call the function anywhere else
2016-09-17 11:16:01	wolf_1	it sends the entire packet without \n
2016-09-17 11:16:05	wolf_1	here's the code

2016-09-17 16:51:11	ubsan	well, that it's called vector<bool>
