2016-09-15 21:31:07	ville	[21:31:01] having signed and unsgined was a silly distinction. having unchecked and checked integer types would have been a better one. because presumably you could make the checked one generic so you define the bounds and the operation that occurs at the bounds for checking.

2016-09-15 22:03:01	ville	of course had c++ gone that route people would complain that it's too fuzzy what underlying type and assembly gets generated. if you define 0,255 range but there's no 8 bit type and so on

2016-09-16 02:17:57	cbreak	why bother?
2016-09-16 02:18:02	cbreak	uniform int distribution is better.
2016-09-16 02:18:15	kline	its just sad to see 10m run time compared to fractions of a second with rust ( http://sprunge.us/gQFK )

2016-09-16 02:18:54	urdh	kline, you'll get a skew anyway so you should figure out if that makes your simulation less accurate
2016-09-16 02:18:59	kline	cbreak, no
2016-09-16 02:19:41	kline	cbreak, https://pulham.info/static/img/no_flags.png suggests about 75% of the runtime is in the generator, with about 25% in the distribution, and a tiny fraction in business logic

2016-09-16 02:22:32	kline	cbreak, cool, maybe im just doing it wrong with the profiler, since with -g -pg and -O3, i get this as my profiler output: https://pulham.info/static/img/flags.png

2016-09-16 02:23:24	cbreak	it gives per-line output. Of course quite unreliable with all the optimizations compilers can do, but more than yours :)
2016-09-16 02:23:26	ville	Oxyd: well your recollection is as good as mine then
2016-09-16 02:23:29	flux	though I suppose these tools aren't very helpful in finding what happens inside your function

2016-09-16 08:27:41	bsdbeard	it seems its better to have one to reduce code complexity if constructing a new node cache isnt a big issue
2016-09-16 08:27:51	bsdbeard	that is one operator=()

2016-09-16 12:15:44	nolyc	STL can mean: (1) C++ standard library; (2) the library Stepanov designed; (3) the parts of [1] based on [2]; (4) specific vendor implementations of [1], [2], or [3]; (5) the underlying principles of [2]; (6) The parts of [1] only in C++03; (7) Stephan T. Lavavej. So, the term is highly ambiguous. If you meant [1] and insist on abbreviating, stdlib is a better choice.

2016-09-16 16:25:06	doppel	okay, so if the array is supposed to be declared when the user passes in NULL, why does the declaration of the array precede the place where this is checked?
2016-09-16 16:26:20	SoItBegins	As I had it, the array is declared either way, because of the copy (either current_array is declared and filled, or declared and copied). If I didn’t need to copy, I’d change the declaration to only occur when NULL was passed in, because then it would only be declared in that circumstance.

2016-09-16 17:09:52	gp5st	constrain and check the stack size*
2016-09-16 17:10:34	gp5st	however, I'd also like to avoid generating code for each layer in the stack, but I'm stuck on that part if anyone has feedback on how to go about that

2016-09-17 11:15:02	wolf_1	and I have another function
2016-09-17 11:15:05	wolf_1	that calls that function
2016-09-17 11:15:17	wolf_1	and uses it to send console input to the server
2016-09-17 11:15:28	wolf_1	but whenever I use it to send the console input
2016-09-17 11:15:40	wolf_1	if I were to send this: "hello bye hi"
2016-09-17 11:15:48	wolf_1	it would send "hello\n bye\n hi\n"
2016-09-17 11:15:56	wolf_1	but if I call the function anywhere else
2016-09-17 11:16:01	wolf_1	it sends the entire packet without \n
2016-09-17 11:16:05	wolf_1	here's the code

2016-09-18 00:01:30	Levitator	So anyway, are there any state transitions stored in a UTF-8 stream between the characters, or are all characters stand-alone and complete?
2016-09-18 00:01:32	TinoDidriksen	wstring_convert tracks that internally. The output has no idea what shift state is. You can't have shift state between code points - it's a thing inside code points.
2016-09-18 00:02:18	Levitator	Ahhh. Great. I was curious as to why I could find no reference to shift-state in the UTF-8 spec, and that's because it's a C++ thing.
2016-09-18 00:02:50	Levitator	They should have just called it character-state, but that would be too intuitive.

2016-09-18 00:05:58	Levitator	If what you are saying is accurate, then that begs the question of what it could possibly mean to unshift a partially written character.
2016-09-18 00:07:32	Levitator	Unless maybe what you say is true for UTF-8, and not for some other encoding, which really does have state transitions outside of characters.

2016-09-18 00:08:36	Levitator	That doesn't make sense. Then you wouldn't need unshift() in the first place. You would just call out() again.

2016-09-18 08:28:57	Moto-chan	Such is DLL Hell
2016-09-18 08:29:35	Orpheon	yes, the DLL is there, and MSYS2 lists only two versions, one for 64-bit and one for 32-bit, and the latter is installed

2016-09-18 09:13:47	Orpheon	[18:27:11] Hello, I'm trying to use Allegro 5 with MSYS2 on windows 32 bit, and after installing both allegro5.1 and g++ through MSYS2's pacman I get https://puu.sh/rfDR6/538268524f.png [18:27:11]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Orpheon	[18:27:33] the PATH does not point to any other versions of either [18:27:33]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Orpheon	[18:27:45] does anyone know how I could find out what is going on? [18:27:45]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:28:03] Well [18:28:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:28:07] do you have that dll? [18:28:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:28:30] Or are you sure the one you have is the one it wants [18:28:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:28:45] For this winblobs stuff, there's often 2 or 3 versions of the same version dll [18:28:45]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:28:53] Slightly modified or whatever [18:28:53]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:28:57] Such is DLL Hell [18:28:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Orpheon	[18:29:35] yes, the DLL is there, and MSYS2 lists only two versions, one for 64-bit and one for 32-bit, and the latter is installed [18:29:35]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	RokerHRO	[18:29:41] !stdcpp DLL [18:29:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	nolyc	[18:29:42] Standard C++ has no notion of `DLL', so you must be talking about some specific OS- or library API (or tool), which is beyond the scope of this channel (which focuses on standard C++). [18:29:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Orpheon	[18:30:06] which channel should I go to? [18:30:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:30:20] ##c++-general [18:30:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:30:25] Or ##winapi [18:30:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:30:31] or was is #winapi [18:30:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:30:33] iono [18:30:33]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Orpheon	[18:31:06] alright, thank you [18:31:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	WalrusPony	[18:32:14] well this isn't a winapi issue [18:32:14]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	WalrusPony	[18:32:27] Orpheon: In this case you'd want a mingw or msys irc channel specifically [18:32:27]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Orpheon	[18:32:48] msys would be nice, but the #msys channel on freenode is pretty dead [18:32:48]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	WalrusPony	[18:33:21] Orpheon: there is msys2 and mingw-w64 channels on oftc irc [18:33:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Orpheon	[18:34:34] did not see that, thank you [18:34:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	mads-	[18:43:03] Given an enum class, can I compare a string with the keys in my enum and maybe even return the value of that key? [18:43:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	RokerHRO	[18:43:25] ? [18:43:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:44:32] mads-: No, there's no way to get what you have called an enum member [18:44:32]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:44:41] You'd have to make manual functions to convert back and forth [18:44:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:44:57] At least, there isn't yet. :3 C++ compile time reflection may arrive. [18:44:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	mads-	[18:45:14] Moto-chan: roger. Thanks. Seems a bit tedious if you add/delete enum members. [18:45:14]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:45:34] Yup [18:45:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	et	[18:51:37] mads-: there is things like https://github.com/aantron/better-enums [18:51:37]

Is there something similar I can do to read n chars from a file into a vector without having to use a for or while loop?
2016-09-18 10:06:52	Rialynn	Currently I just open the file and then run a for loop for i = 0; i < numCharsToRead and each iteration i just do charVector.push_back(infile.get()); which is working, but I'm wondering if I can make it cleaner

2016-09-18 11:43:11	Levitator	I mean, WTF is this? If you can delete the damned things in the first place, then why did they delete the destructor? That's asinine.
2016-09-18 11:44:53	w3z	KrzaQ: i dunno, if you find a link post it, but i think they go up after the conference is over
2016-09-18 11:45:14	Levitator	So, I guess, if you want to make wstring_convert from a conversion facet from a locale object, you have to find out the locale's string name and instantiate a deletable codecvt adapter from the same name string.

2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[21:37:00] And you can't copy facet's either, so you it's as if they intentionally decided "Yeah, we want to make string conversion easier, but we want to deliberately break compatibility with streams and make you special-case it all" [21:37:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	KrzaQ	[21:42:13] Is Cppcon livestreamed? [21:42:13]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[21:42:51] Look at the workaround at the bottom: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/locale/wstring_convert/wstring_convert [21:42:51]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[21:43:11] I mean, WTF is this? If you can delete the damned things in the first place, then why did they delete the destructor? That's asinine. [21:43:11]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	w3z	[21:44:53] KrzaQ: i dunno, if you find a link post it, but i think they go up after the conference is over [21:44:53]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[21:45:14] So, I guess, if you want to make wstring_convert from a conversion facet from a locale object, you have to find out the locale's string name and instantiate a deletable codecvt adapter from the same name string. [21:45:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[21:45:24] Because it's fun to make shit pointlessly inefficient and convoluted. [21:45:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	KrzaQ	[21:45:28] Will do, w3z [21:45:28]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	KrzaQ	[21:45:41] Going Natives were livestreamed and the quality was great :< [21:45:41]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[21:49:48] Oh, boy! std::codecvt_byname! That's utter genius. How about just std::new_facet<whatever_t>(locale)? [21:49:48]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[21:50:15] I'm either missing something, or the C++ committee has turned to crack smoking. [21:50:15]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	ville	[21:56:27] turned? [21:56:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	ville	[21:56:42] it's not like it's a recent development [21:56:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:03:56] Ok, so if I want a deletable codecvt from an extant locale, I can use something like std::codecvt_byname<...>(locale.name) [22:03:56]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:04:28] And THEN, I can finally use wstring_convert [22:04:28]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:05:53] Which implies both an allocation operation and a string lookup when they could have just made codecvt copy-assignable instead! [22:05:53]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:06:23] But, hey, whatever, I'm not a genius on the language committee. [22:06:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:06:58] Well, they could have made it copy-assignable and then not arbitrarily delete it for no reason in a function that uses is. [22:06:58]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:07:00] *it [22:07:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	w3z	[22:07:14] you're not a genius anywhere, no need to equivocate [22:07:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:08:48] You have no knowledge of me, and can fuck off. [22:08:48]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	decimad	[22:10:34] Feel the love! [22:10:34]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	w3z	[22:18:51] i remember your dumb ass from a couple months ago, and i have the evidence of your ongoing rant in my scrollback buffer .... [22:18:51]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	SoItBegins	[22:19:03] . . . [22:19:03]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	SoItBegins	[22:19:20] What’s the bot command for ‘cut it out, you two’? [22:19:20]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Oxyd	[22:19:40] That would be !ops. [22:19:40]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:22:09] Yeah, I mean, because you have to be dumb not to misunderstand a language you don't use every day. [22:22:09]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:22:20] Or to do so, anyway. [22:22:20]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	hesperos	[22:22:24] I'm wondering what is a better option. Implementing getter/setters or rather templated operator=() & operator*() ? So, far operators seems problematic since in case of type deduction failure, calling x.operator*<int>() seems rather ugly [22:22:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:23:19] I regard operators as being mostly useful when you need a generic algorithm to operate on your class as if it were some other type. [22:23:19]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:23:42] Sometimes, they are useful for clarity of syntax, like the IO insertion and extraction operators. [22:23:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	w3z	[22:23:52] nobody points at locales/codecvt/facets and thinks theyre wonderful ... but more importantly nobody wants to hear an uninformed diatribe without a solution or an attempt at improving the situation [22:23:52]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:24:57] Excuse me, then, we'll leave the floor open to all of the boost devs who hang out here. [22:24:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	pragma-	[22:25:16] w3z: speak for yourself. I, for one, am enjoying the show. [22:25:16]

2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:25:58] Either that or not deleting for no reason. [22:25:58]
