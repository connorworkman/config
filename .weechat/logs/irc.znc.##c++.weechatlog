2016-09-15 21:31:07	ville	[21:31:01] having signed and unsgined was a silly distinction. having unchecked and checked integer types would have been a better one. because presumably you could make the checked one generic so you define the bounds and the operation that occurs at the bounds for checking.

2016-09-15 22:03:01	ville	of course had c++ gone that route people would complain that it's too fuzzy what underlying type and assembly gets generated. if you define 0,255 range but there's no 8 bit type and so on

2016-09-16 02:17:57	cbreak	why bother?
2016-09-16 02:18:02	cbreak	uniform int distribution is better.
2016-09-16 02:18:15	kline	its just sad to see 10m run time compared to fractions of a second with rust ( http://sprunge.us/gQFK )

2016-09-16 02:18:54	urdh	kline, you'll get a skew anyway so you should figure out if that makes your simulation less accurate
2016-09-16 02:18:59	kline	cbreak, no
2016-09-16 02:19:41	kline	cbreak, https://pulham.info/static/img/no_flags.png suggests about 75% of the runtime is in the generator, with about 25% in the distribution, and a tiny fraction in business logic

2016-09-16 02:22:32	kline	cbreak, cool, maybe im just doing it wrong with the profiler, since with -g -pg and -O3, i get this as my profiler output: https://pulham.info/static/img/flags.png

2016-09-16 02:23:24	cbreak	it gives per-line output. Of course quite unreliable with all the optimizations compilers can do, but more than yours :)
2016-09-16 02:23:26	ville	Oxyd: well your recollection is as good as mine then
2016-09-16 02:23:29	flux	though I suppose these tools aren't very helpful in finding what happens inside your function

2016-09-16 08:27:41	bsdbeard	it seems its better to have one to reduce code complexity if constructing a new node cache isnt a big issue
2016-09-16 08:27:51	bsdbeard	that is one operator=()

2016-09-16 12:15:44	nolyc	STL can mean: (1) C++ standard library; (2) the library Stepanov designed; (3) the parts of [1] based on [2]; (4) specific vendor implementations of [1], [2], or [3]; (5) the underlying principles of [2]; (6) The parts of [1] only in C++03; (7) Stephan T. Lavavej. So, the term is highly ambiguous. If you meant [1] and insist on abbreviating, stdlib is a better choice.

2016-09-16 16:25:06	doppel	okay, so if the array is supposed to be declared when the user passes in NULL, why does the declaration of the array precede the place where this is checked?
2016-09-16 16:26:20	SoItBegins	As I had it, the array is declared either way, because of the copy (either current_array is declared and filled, or declared and copied). If I didn’t need to copy, I’d change the declaration to only occur when NULL was passed in, because then it would only be declared in that circumstance.

2016-09-16 17:09:52	gp5st	constrain and check the stack size*
2016-09-16 17:10:34	gp5st	however, I'd also like to avoid generating code for each layer in the stack, but I'm stuck on that part if anyone has feedback on how to go about that

2016-09-17 11:15:02	wolf_1	and I have another function
2016-09-17 11:15:05	wolf_1	that calls that function
2016-09-17 11:15:17	wolf_1	and uses it to send console input to the server
2016-09-17 11:15:28	wolf_1	but whenever I use it to send the console input
2016-09-17 11:15:40	wolf_1	if I were to send this: "hello bye hi"
2016-09-17 11:15:48	wolf_1	it would send "hello\n bye\n hi\n"
2016-09-17 11:15:56	wolf_1	but if I call the function anywhere else
2016-09-17 11:16:01	wolf_1	it sends the entire packet without \n
2016-09-17 11:16:05	wolf_1	here's the code

2016-09-18 00:01:30	Levitator	So anyway, are there any state transitions stored in a UTF-8 stream between the characters, or are all characters stand-alone and complete?
2016-09-18 00:01:32	TinoDidriksen	wstring_convert tracks that internally. The output has no idea what shift state is. You can't have shift state between code points - it's a thing inside code points.
2016-09-18 00:02:18	Levitator	Ahhh. Great. I was curious as to why I could find no reference to shift-state in the UTF-8 spec, and that's because it's a C++ thing.
2016-09-18 00:02:50	Levitator	They should have just called it character-state, but that would be too intuitive.

2016-09-18 00:05:58	Levitator	If what you are saying is accurate, then that begs the question of what it could possibly mean to unshift a partially written character.
2016-09-18 00:07:32	Levitator	Unless maybe what you say is true for UTF-8, and not for some other encoding, which really does have state transitions outside of characters.

2016-09-18 00:08:36	Levitator	That doesn't make sense. Then you wouldn't need unshift() in the first place. You would just call out() again.

2016-09-18 08:28:57	Moto-chan	Such is DLL Hell
2016-09-18 08:29:35	Orpheon	yes, the DLL is there, and MSYS2 lists only two versions, one for 64-bit and one for 32-bit, and the latter is installed

2016-09-18 09:13:47	Orpheon	[18:27:11] Hello, I'm trying to use Allegro 5 with MSYS2 on windows 32 bit, and after installing both allegro5.1 and g++ through MSYS2's pacman I get https://puu.sh/rfDR6/538268524f.png [18:27:11]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Orpheon	[18:27:33] the PATH does not point to any other versions of either [18:27:33]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Orpheon	[18:27:45] does anyone know how I could find out what is going on? [18:27:45]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:28:03] Well [18:28:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:28:07] do you have that dll? [18:28:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:28:30] Or are you sure the one you have is the one it wants [18:28:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:28:45] For this winblobs stuff, there's often 2 or 3 versions of the same version dll [18:28:45]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:28:53] Slightly modified or whatever [18:28:53]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:28:57] Such is DLL Hell [18:28:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Orpheon	[18:29:35] yes, the DLL is there, and MSYS2 lists only two versions, one for 64-bit and one for 32-bit, and the latter is installed [18:29:35]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	RokerHRO	[18:29:41] !stdcpp DLL [18:29:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	nolyc	[18:29:42] Standard C++ has no notion of `DLL', so you must be talking about some specific OS- or library API (or tool), which is beyond the scope of this channel (which focuses on standard C++). [18:29:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Orpheon	[18:30:06] which channel should I go to? [18:30:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:30:20] ##c++-general [18:30:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:30:25] Or ##winapi [18:30:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:30:31] or was is #winapi [18:30:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:30:33] iono [18:30:33]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Orpheon	[18:31:06] alright, thank you [18:31:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	WalrusPony	[18:32:14] well this isn't a winapi issue [18:32:14]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	WalrusPony	[18:32:27] Orpheon: In this case you'd want a mingw or msys irc channel specifically [18:32:27]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Orpheon	[18:32:48] msys would be nice, but the #msys channel on freenode is pretty dead [18:32:48]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	WalrusPony	[18:33:21] Orpheon: there is msys2 and mingw-w64 channels on oftc irc [18:33:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Orpheon	[18:34:34] did not see that, thank you [18:34:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	mads-	[18:43:03] Given an enum class, can I compare a string with the keys in my enum and maybe even return the value of that key? [18:43:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	RokerHRO	[18:43:25] ? [18:43:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:44:32] mads-: No, there's no way to get what you have called an enum member [18:44:32]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:44:41] You'd have to make manual functions to convert back and forth [18:44:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:44:57] At least, there isn't yet. :3 C++ compile time reflection may arrive. [18:44:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	mads-	[18:45:14] Moto-chan: roger. Thanks. Seems a bit tedious if you add/delete enum members. [18:45:14]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	Moto-chan	[18:45:34] Yup [18:45:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:47	et	[18:51:37] mads-: there is things like https://github.com/aantron/better-enums [18:51:37]

Is there something similar I can do to read n chars from a file into a vector without having to use a for or while loop?
2016-09-18 10:06:52	Rialynn	Currently I just open the file and then run a for loop for i = 0; i < numCharsToRead and each iteration i just do charVector.push_back(infile.get()); which is working, but I'm wondering if I can make it cleaner

2016-09-18 11:43:11	Levitator	I mean, WTF is this? If you can delete the damned things in the first place, then why did they delete the destructor? That's asinine.
2016-09-18 11:44:53	w3z	KrzaQ: i dunno, if you find a link post it, but i think they go up after the conference is over
2016-09-18 11:45:14	Levitator	So, I guess, if you want to make wstring_convert from a conversion facet from a locale object, you have to find out the locale's string name and instantiate a deletable codecvt adapter from the same name string.

2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[21:37:00] And you can't copy facet's either, so you it's as if they intentionally decided "Yeah, we want to make string conversion easier, but we want to deliberately break compatibility with streams and make you special-case it all" [21:37:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	KrzaQ	[21:42:13] Is Cppcon livestreamed? [21:42:13]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[21:42:51] Look at the workaround at the bottom: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/locale/wstring_convert/wstring_convert [21:42:51]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[21:43:11] I mean, WTF is this? If you can delete the damned things in the first place, then why did they delete the destructor? That's asinine. [21:43:11]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	w3z	[21:44:53] KrzaQ: i dunno, if you find a link post it, but i think they go up after the conference is over [21:44:53]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[21:45:14] So, I guess, if you want to make wstring_convert from a conversion facet from a locale object, you have to find out the locale's string name and instantiate a deletable codecvt adapter from the same name string. [21:45:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[21:45:24] Because it's fun to make shit pointlessly inefficient and convoluted. [21:45:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	KrzaQ	[21:45:28] Will do, w3z [21:45:28]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	KrzaQ	[21:45:41] Going Natives were livestreamed and the quality was great :< [21:45:41]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[21:49:48] Oh, boy! std::codecvt_byname! That's utter genius. How about just std::new_facet<whatever_t>(locale)? [21:49:48]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[21:50:15] I'm either missing something, or the C++ committee has turned to crack smoking. [21:50:15]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	ville	[21:56:27] turned? [21:56:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	ville	[21:56:42] it's not like it's a recent development [21:56:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:03:56] Ok, so if I want a deletable codecvt from an extant locale, I can use something like std::codecvt_byname<...>(locale.name) [22:03:56]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:04:28] And THEN, I can finally use wstring_convert [22:04:28]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:05:53] Which implies both an allocation operation and a string lookup when they could have just made codecvt copy-assignable instead! [22:05:53]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:06:23] But, hey, whatever, I'm not a genius on the language committee. [22:06:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:06:58] Well, they could have made it copy-assignable and then not arbitrarily delete it for no reason in a function that uses is. [22:06:58]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:07:00] *it [22:07:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	w3z	[22:07:14] you're not a genius anywhere, no need to equivocate [22:07:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:08:48] You have no knowledge of me, and can fuck off. [22:08:48]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	decimad	[22:10:34] Feel the love! [22:10:34]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	w3z	[22:18:51] i remember your dumb ass from a couple months ago, and i have the evidence of your ongoing rant in my scrollback buffer .... [22:18:51]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	SoItBegins	[22:19:03] . . . [22:19:03]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	SoItBegins	[22:19:20] What’s the bot command for ‘cut it out, you two’? [22:19:20]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Oxyd	[22:19:40] That would be !ops. [22:19:40]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:22:09] Yeah, I mean, because you have to be dumb not to misunderstand a language you don't use every day. [22:22:09]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:22:20] Or to do so, anyway. [22:22:20]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	hesperos	[22:22:24] I'm wondering what is a better option. Implementing getter/setters or rather templated operator=() & operator*() ? So, far operators seems problematic since in case of type deduction failure, calling x.operator*<int>() seems rather ugly [22:22:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:23:19] I regard operators as being mostly useful when you need a generic algorithm to operate on your class as if it were some other type. [22:23:19]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:23:42] Sometimes, they are useful for clarity of syntax, like the IO insertion and extraction operators. [22:23:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	w3z	[22:23:52] nobody points at locales/codecvt/facets and thinks theyre wonderful ... but more importantly nobody wants to hear an uninformed diatribe without a solution or an attempt at improving the situation [22:23:52]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:24:57] Excuse me, then, we'll leave the floor open to all of the boost devs who hang out here. [22:24:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	pragma-	[22:25:16] w3z: speak for yourself. I, for one, am enjoying the show. [22:25:16]

2016-09-18 13:24:34	Levitator	[22:25:58] Either that or not deleting for no reason. [22:25:58]

2016-09-18 18:21:43	Akahige	I actually made a similar function.
2016-09-18 18:22:39	Akahige	However, the way I actually did it was to read it to big endian, and call ntoh on it
2016-09-18 18:22:56	Akahige	So in the rare case it's used on a big endian system, it'll still work.
2016-09-18 18:23:50	decimad	well, my lib is configured with source order and host order and can transform a sequential packet definition into a struct

2016-09-18 20:07:40	xaxxon	in c++, if you made it in a function, return it by value.
2016-09-18 20:07:53	xaxxon	if you allocated memory for it on the heap, return a unique_ptr

2016-09-18 20:22:10	kstar	Okay, so essentially, what the return-value optimization does is very similar to std::move() / returning an rvalue reference implicitly?
2016-09-18 20:22:25	xaxxon	however, push_back will default construct the element before move assigning it (less efficient) vs emplace_back move constructs the object
2016-09-18 20:23:17	xaxxon	kstar:  move semantics only help with dynamically allocated memory.   it doesn't help with the data members in the class.   If you have a huge array inside your class, move semantics don't make it faster.  It still copies the whole thing
2016-09-18 20:23:47	xaxxon	move sematics are good when your class has a pointer and then a bunch of memory is allocated with new

2016-09-18 21:39:04	V-ille	!windows
2016-09-18 21:39:05	nolyc	You should ask your Windows programming questions in ##c++-general, #winapi, ##windows-coding or irc://irc.efnet.org/winprog
2016-09-18 21:39:27	elderK	nolyc: It's not really specific to Windows - imagine a Linux system using multiple C/C++ runtimes.
2016-09-18 21:39:56	w3z	if they all use the same version of the shared crt, then you get a little windows magic that maps a segment between all the instances of the crt dll, its whack-a-doo and yes off-topic
2016-09-18 21:40:01	elderK	V-ille: I mean this problem could technically happen in Linux too, if you were using multiple runtimes.
2016-09-18 21:40:05	V-ille	you can imagine such things all you want, but because linux has abi standards, these issues don't arise
2016-09-18 21:40:50	elderK	Yes - but even so, the runtimes could be different - and how templates are defined, etc, also different?

2016-09-18 21:41:18	w3z	again, off-topic, but in linux the big problem is late binding and dynamically gathering type information
2016-09-18 21:41:35	elderK	V-ille: Yes - but what about how the templates expand for say std::string?

2016-09-18 21:43:06	V-ille	"how templates expand" is just one aspect of the abi stability, and they don't "expand" in incompatible ways

2016-09-19 00:17:26	velco	zack_s_: tl;dr mutex is there to prevent concurrent modifications to the condition (in the example, the value of variable `i`); hence both these who read and these who modify `i` must lock the  mutex. The condition wait *atomically* unlocks the mutex and blocks the thread: that means that when if someone changes the condition (while holding the lock) a su sequent notify will in fact wake up the thread

2016-09-19 01:16:03	xaxxon	this is just fundamentla behavior of condition variable waits -- they don't act like they ever unlocked your mutex
2016-09-19 01:16:06	lh_mouse	velco, basically you are correct. But if I am sure I need the mutex I could lock it explicitly thereafter.
2016-09-19 01:16:50	lh_mouse	If I am sure I don't need it I just won't do that, instead of letting the cond var lock the mutex implicitly then unlock it explicitly.
2016-09-19 01:17:09	Adrinael	It makes some sense to be able to just if (bool got_it = timed_wait_on_condvar()) { do stuff } else { return "fuck"; }
2016-09-19 01:17:47	velco	if you are sure you won;t need it in the case of timeout, you could pass some flag to the cond, indeed; but that seems awkward and also throws the lock RAII out of the window

2016-09-19 07:46:24	Cohedrin	hoping someone can clear something up for me:
2016-09-19 07:46:48	Cohedrin	here, it looks like VectorTransform is being called with an single float argument: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/0d8dceea4310fde5706b3ce1c70609d72a38efdf/mp/src/public/mathlib/mathlib.h#L899
2016-09-19 07:47:12	Cohedrin	however, VectorTransform takes an array of floats as its first argument: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/0d8dceea4310fde5706b3ce1c70609d72a38efdf/mp/src/mathlib/mathlib_base.cpp#L259

2016-09-19 12:37:13	d34df00d	Let's say I have the std::cout and some other output stream. Is it possible to swap their rdbufs so that writes to cout will actually write to that output stream?

2016-09-20 00:39:03	tgy	[08:59:06] but i think it's not the proper way to do it with CMake [08:59:06]
2016-09-20 00:39:03	w3z	[09:01:29] afaik clang has not packaged the fs ts in any official build, it may be in the repo though [09:01:29]

2016-09-20 02:04:14	w3z	i wouldnt go that far, the simplest solution is to provide a dispatch/swizzle function that knows about the instance of the lambda and calls it on the c routines behalf
2016-09-20 02:04:35	w3z	there will of course be lifetime issues
2016-09-20 02:05:22	Olipro	yeah, but, knowing about the instance of the lambda is the trick
2016-09-20 02:05:51	Olipro	which I can only see a way out of by doing something gross like either a global/static member
2016-09-20 02:07:31	cbreak	Olipro: you have to create a new function for every lambda
2016-09-20 02:07:40	cbreak	you need runtime code generation

2016-09-20 04:33:17	slavanap	w3z, except they are using different methods.
2016-09-20 04:33:20	w3z	the free store may be implemented on top of the os or c heap, but doesnt have to
2016-09-20 04:33:36	slavanap	w3z, well it should be implemented somehow.
2016-09-20 04:33:50	w3z	it is implemented "some how"
2016-09-20 04:33:50	slavanap	and it works the same.
2016-09-20 04:33:50	h4k1m	slavanap: whereas if I use the other syntax (), once I get out of the {} block, it's freed automatically...
2016-09-20 04:34:04	slavanap	h4k1m, yes.
2016-09-20 04:34:07	w3z	that some how may be a static fixed size block
2016-09-20 04:34:09	ppf	yes, one is the abstract concept, the other a possible implementation, but is that truely such a big difference?

2016-09-20 04:35:00	w3z	anyway, its the way the language is specified, a distinction is made
2016-09-20 04:35:28	w3z	if you want to use your own jargon instead go ahead, youll just be potentially wrong
2016-09-20 04:35:40	slavanap	the distinction for me is new/delete, new T[]/delete[]   vs.   malloc or calloc / free.

2016-09-20 04:38:23	slavanap	w3z, people writing standards. They are not much different from us. Sometimes it's better to be more simple than precise.

2016-09-20 08:12:06	hs_	although that does have some limitations when compared to the switch.. like early returns

2016-09-20 08:14:14	Eelis	you can also only do 1-level matching that way

2016-09-20 08:14:42	hs_	Eelis, yeah, and you end up with hierarchical visitors
2016-09-20 08:14:53	Lenore	pattern matching looks like it would make a lot of code patterns a lot easier to follow.
