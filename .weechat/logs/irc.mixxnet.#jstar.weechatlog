2016-09-13 03:32:00	@jstar	Vaccines don't cause Autism 
2016-09-13 03:32:00		[03:32]
2016-09-13 03:32:03	@jstar	the current research supports that autism is a genetic condition, genetic doesn't necessarily mean inherited, but in some cases there appears to be a family history. The research also supports that it is something that develops in utero. It's also important to remember that autism isn't a singular condition with a variety of symptoms. Research now supports
2016-09-13 03:32:03	@jstar	that there are many different types of autism with varying degrees of symptoms and onset.
2016-09-13 03:38:00		[03:32]
