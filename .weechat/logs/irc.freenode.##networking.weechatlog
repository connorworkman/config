2016-09-09 02:19:00	Lope	I'm connecting to the internet with openvpn over 3G-with-packet-loss. When I use openVPN over UDP, some sites fail to load. Even after I set my DNS to run over TCP. I've compared many times. OpenVPN over TCP provides MUCH more stability for me. This is a little strange, that TCP over TCP is better than TCP over UDP. But it's what I'm experiencing. Perhaps the reason is that my OpenVPN connection is a single, long running connection and the TCP-IP protocol
2016-09-09 02:19:01	Lope	adapts itself well to my 3G connection, whereas new TCP connections may experience problems before they stabilize. So the net effect is a much better experience tunneling everything over my TCP connection.

2016-09-09 03:06:15	djph	if it's a flat network, you can either have a second box just watching what goes over the wire, or use tcpdump on your main router (if you have the spare CPU cycles) or any number of other things that don't involve a second router

My concern with bring the router in to do the routing is you are then limited to the 1gbps pipes for intervlan routing and because it will be using the same cable it is really 500mbps

2016-09-09 04:49:38	zapotah	1921 is still perfectly valid hardware

2016-09-09 04:51:50	scotepi	my my concern is intervlan routing. At this point I don't have much going acrross vlans. Voice, small amounts of data and internet.

2016-09-09 04:52:18	scotepi	k, the switch is at about 10% cpu usage so it's not maxed out but something I want to keep thinking about
2016-09-09 04:52:39	+daemonkeeper	Your switch hopefully won't do IP routing in CPU
2016-09-09 04:53:05	scotepi	especially if I move the servers to another VLAN
2016-09-09 04:53:17	Oliber	it should be l3 switching, which the spec sheet claims is line rate, so i'd keep your intervlan routing on that

2016-09-09 04:53:57	zapotah	gossew: did you have an actual question?

2016-09-09 04:54:43	Oliber	scotepi: do you know what the CPU usage is when it has no L3 traffic active? some devices can report a few % just for idling
2016-09-09 04:54:48	+daemonkeeper	It's a gross misunderstanding to assume a switch, just because it's sold as a switch, couldn't do very reliable and fast IP forwarding.
2016-09-09 04:54:51	zapotah	gossew: its end of life anyway so i wouldnt recommend it regardless

2016-09-09 05:41:58	Masurini	would it be best to work with different routingtables?
2016-09-09 05:43:10	Masurini	so just set a second gateway
2016-09-09 05:43:10	+pppingme	Masurini in most cases, probably not..  give more details?  do you have a router hooked to two networks and you're trying to get the networks to talk?

2016-09-09 07:59:46	E1ephant	it can be, generally is bawb5
2016-09-09 07:59:58	styler2go	i don't get the problem to be honest :(

2016-09-09 08:01:39	bawb5	I am just a bit confused, in cisco IOS to configure console connections you type 'line console 0/0' but to do serial port you type 'interface serial 0/0' not sure what the difference is
2016-09-09 08:01:44	Dagger	the fritzbox is rejecting the packets, so the second router doesn't even get a say in it
2016-09-09 08:01:53	Dagger	nettly: actually no, no NAT here at all
2016-09-09 08:02:38	E1ephant	bawb5: ah, so a serial interface is for networking, like connecting to other serial interfaces, for IP/IPX/AppleTalk. in your context
2016-09-09 08:03:22	E1ephant	you have serial, "hssi" high speed serial interface, and a few others that are not ethernet/FastE/GigE

2016-09-09 08:03:45	bawb5	E1ephant yes in this context it was between two routers. so it's kind of like a console cable between the two
2016-09-09 08:03:55	styler2go	can i somehow narrow the error?
2016-09-09 08:03:57	E1ephant	POS or Packet over SONET, ATM interfaces, the world is converging to ethernet though
2016-09-09 08:04:05	bawb5	E1ephant but why can't the routers communicate with just ethernet?
2016-09-09 08:04:14	E1ephant	bawb5: eh, console is for "out of band" as in, non-IP communication

2016-09-09 08:05:08	E1ephant	for instance, if you order a TDM circuit, like T1/DS3, you are likely to receive it over hssi/serial interface in some instances.

2016-09-09 08:05:28	bawb5	E1ephant yes in the lab the serial connection was used for cisco discovery protocol.
2016-09-09 08:05:52	E1ephant	again though, with everyone converging on ethernet, providers these days will usually have CPE that converts whatever the link is, to ethernet
2016-09-09 08:06:20	zapotah	E1ephant: as it should be
2016-09-09 08:06:32	nettly	hm, I read that for real time ethernet, some extensions are required though

2016-09-09 08:42:17	queshun	hi. I am not understanding Unique Local Addresses. Is there some free material that one could refer me to that gives an example of how to go about configuring the ip addresses on a LAN with more than 1 subnet?
2016-09-09 08:42:41	queshun	I have tried generating a prefix with sixxs ula generator
2016-09-09 08:42:51	Dagger	Apachez: in the process of reading that, I found this: "The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements section 6.1.5 requires that only these three curves [US NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521] be used for elliptic curve keys in certs covered by the BRs."
2016-09-09 08:42:53	queshun	but Windows says the ip address is invalid

2016-09-09 10:35:34	catpig	hi, i'm trying to setup a reverse ssh tunnel but when i then try to ssh into the other machine over that tunnel the last output from ssh is "debug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.7p1-hpn14v5". on the other machine the tunnel was opened to this one with "ssh -N -R 2222:localhost:22 catpig-alpha1.ddns.net" and i'm using "ssh -vvvv -l root -p 2222 localhost" to try to connect. the log on this machine shows a successful login so
2016-09-09 10:35:34	catpig	i'm quite sure my friend on the other end did it correctly. any ideas?
2016-09-09 10:36:03	catpig	i know ssh+root is bad, but my end of the tunnel is a live cd i booted solely to serve as my end of the tunnel ;)

2016-09-09 10:48:46	RtMF	the big difference in fact between -R and -L is the context for the 2nd parameter, hostname, namely -R connects to it from the far end of the ssh link, as resolved there, while -L does it locally (and thus listens on the remote host instead)

2016-09-09 12:12:47	thuryn	catphish, i think 802.11 was defined that way because they were using frequencies that were already in use for other things (like amateur television) and they were trying to provide some flexibility to avoid interference with that sort of thing.

Have set up manual ips (192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.3) and netmask (255.255.255.0). But when I try to ping from either end, I get error messages like "Network is unreachable". Any ideas? I've disabled the wifi interfaces on both boxes.

Router 1 has internet connected to WAN and I have a ubuntu computer connected to its wifi. Router 2 has a LAN port from router 1 to connected to its WAN. I have a RPI connected to router 2. I can ping router 1 and ubuntu from the RPI but not the other way. Any ideas?

2016-09-09 22:25:49	zapotah	siimin: disable dhcp on router 2 and stick the cable from LAN to LAN
2016-09-09 22:25:56	siimin	I am thinking the cause of the problem is router 1 which I can't access the settings on. Everything seems to be OK with router 2.
2016-09-09 22:26:05	zapotah	siimin: no, youre doing double nat
2016-09-09 22:26:17	zapotah	siimin: do as i said and magic will happen
2016-09-09 22:26:19	Wulf	siimin: problem is router 2. Why do you need two routers?
2016-09-09 22:26:40	siimin	zapotah, OK, not familiar with that. Will do as you said! Thanks for the help.

This detection is initiated when a router identifies itself in a Hello protocol packet. Upon acknowledgment, this establishes a two-way state and the most basic relationship. The routers in an Ethernet or Frame Relay network select a Designated Router (DR) and a Backup Designated Router (BDR) which act as a hub to reduce traffic between routers."

2016-09-10 02:57:07	OMGDoggeh	Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a routing protocol for Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It uses a link state routing (LSR) algorithm and falls into the group of interior routing protocols, operating within a single autonomous system (AS). It is
2016-09-10 02:57:08	OMGDoggeh	defined as OSPF Version 2 in RFC 2328 (1998) for IPv4. The updates for IPv6 are specified as OSPF Version 3 in RFC 5340 (2008). OSPF is perhaps the most widely used interior gateway protocol (IGP) in large enterprise networks.

2016-09-10 06:53:32	OMGKitteh	So if it's faster to route on the linux kernel, why do all the services layered on top of it decide to NAT?

2016-09-10 08:57:52	hugge	a splice is expensive because a good splicer is pretty expensive, also requires abit of training, and takes time

2016-09-10 08:58:01	hugge	pigtails is like 50c

2016-09-10 08:58:25	+catphish	hugge: oh ok, so actually the difference between splicing one and splicing 2 is like 50c in material and 2 mins of time
2016-09-10 08:59:06	hugge	catphish: yeah maybe more like 10 minutes including all the job surrounding doing a good fusion splice
2016-09-10 08:59:49	+catphish	really, i watched a guy doing mine today, took like 2 minutes, he just cleaned the pair with alcohol, put them in the machine and pressed the button

2016-09-10 09:01:27	hugge	and hope all splices fits into their quality-matrix

2016-09-10 12:13:56	teprrr	although people here may be willing to help others, doing extra work to go through old drafts and other doesn't really encourage one to do so

2016-09-10 12:17:52	dogbert2	LOL: Smartphones equipped with special programming can become a sophisticated spy sensor capable of stealing designs from a 3D printer -- just by measuring the noise and electromagnetic radiation the printer emits. Researchers from the University of Buffalo recently discovered how a smartphone on a bench about 8 inches away from a 3D printer could allow someone to reconstruct a simple object being printed with 94 percent accura

2016-09-10 18:57:21	ryonaloli	however when i use tcpdump, i'm able to see the connection established and an outgoing connection attempted.
2016-09-10 18:57:56	ryonaloli	at first i thought it must have been a problem with my iptables setup, gre tunnel, routes, or something like that, but considering it also happens when i try to ssh in, i think it must be something out of my control.
2016-09-10 18:58:25	ryonaloli	but the fact that tcpdump can see it makes it seem like it's not simply the incoming traffic from certain ips being blocked outright. it's very confusing.

2016-09-11 04:46:47	SAngeli	I have a set of devices for surveillance that need to use static IP from 192.168.0.200 to 192.168.0.254 Can I set DHCP on the modem from 192.168.0.2 to 192.168.0.199 so that I have the rest of IP free and then set up my surveillance devices with static IP not being in the DHCP range? I think so but wish to ask and double check before doing anything.

I think so but wish to ask and double check before doing anything.

2016-09-11 05:56:19	SAngeli	longxia, BenderRodriguez 2. If I connect an additional router to the modem is it possible to use the router as a "switch" and WiFi rather than having to configure it with its own subnet being different than what the modem has? I wish to have the router in the same subnet of the modem. If so, what is the Ip and Gateway of the router?

2016-09-11 10:37:39	forestbits	Trying to learn a bit more about network theory (no specific problem presently). This is in the context of cable modem setups. I know that from the clients perspective, they send packets to the router, which then sends it onward to the ISP. What ip address does the router have on the internet interface? Which ip does the modem have? Are they both public addresses?

For example, what protocols exist between modem and ISP that deliver ip addresses? How would a router (that is not part of the modem) fulfill its normal function? I assume these things are somewhat like DHCP in that they work together by themselves without further configuration, or at least have the

2016-09-12 03:05:55	teprrr	those networks are in the same vlan, they have routes between them and you are not blocking them correctly?
2016-09-12 03:06:01	verderon	it's the main router with three interfaces. One connected to the cablemodem (public IP), another connected to my workstation, and the other connected to the second router
2016-09-12 03:06:10	djph	WHAT ROUTER?!
2016-09-12 03:06:18	teprrr	my router provides 192.168.100.0/24, 192.168.200.0/24 and 192.168.250.0/24 for me
2016-09-12 03:06:30	djph	I get the concept that it has two "LAN" networks defined ... what make/model?

2016-09-12 03:08:07	verderon	well I think this problem has to do with my network setup.

2016-09-12 03:08:38	verderon	I can configure the firewall at the ERL to block traffic, I just want to know if my network topology is correct before doing that
2016-09-12 03:08:46	djph	as for the ddwrt box ... you could always just plug one of its lan ports into the secondary lna from the ERL, rather than having it do more NAT

2016-09-12 04:38:19	+daemonkeeper	Why would they? Set an access port on your switch and you're done. It's not like you could build DMZs or PBR with home routers.

2016-09-12 06:48:08	pticochon	second dumb question: IF the NIC is responsible for implementing the physical and data link layers (ethernet) and knows nothing about higher level protocols such as IP... does this mean that the hardware and software "on the other side of the PCI express bridge" (I'm communicating with the NIC via PCI express) conversely knows nothing about the data link and physical layers? I mean, which component adds the Ethernet header, preamble and all
2016-09-12 06:48:08	pticochon	that? the NIC I guess, not the software running on my computer. Is that correct?

2016-09-13 03:54:35	Gollee	so when you ping a router it has to process the ping in its CPU before it replies
2016-09-13 03:55:12	Gollee	so that's why pinging routers is a poor way to show packetloss, because ICMP is the last thing the CPU will process in a router, it has lots of other more important things to do that are prioritized

2016-09-13 03:55:50	vans163	dami0, Gollee: Come to think of it, if 12.5MB takes 1 second to transfer on 1gbps.  Then 3MB should take 250ms?
2016-09-13 03:56:01	Gollee	r or so ago routers always had 70% load, sometimes peacking 90%+, so they were busy
2016-09-13 03:56:30	vans163	dami0, Gollee: Wait no! thats 100mbps!
2016-09-13 03:56:42	dami0	vans163: gbps is bits, 12.5MB/s yeah
2016-09-13 03:56:48	Gollee	vans163: way to go ignoring everything I've said and linked to you. It's not that simple. Every segment has to be acked, you need  a 3way handshake, all of that takes time.
2016-09-13 03:56:49	dami0	125*, my bda
2016-09-13 03:57:08	dami0	but that's ideal case. tcp has overhead like Gollee said

2016-09-13 03:57:38	vans163	Gollee, dami0: Yea overhead I understand, also the ACKs, but local network it should never ACK anything atleast very very rarely
2016-09-13 03:57:47	vans163	ACK I mean retrammit
2016-09-13 03:57:50	vans163	it ACKs everything
2016-09-13 03:57:59	Gollee	still requires an ACK before next segment is sent
2016-09-13 03:58:12	dami0	vans163: on the flipside, if your maths is correct, 3mb takes 250ms in an ideal case, you can easily see how (@ 1ms latency) a certain amount of transmission control packets would bump it to 300ms
2016-09-13 03:58:18	Gollee	so 2000 segments require lots of ACKs
2016-09-13 03:58:27	dami0	that's 2ms to go both ways before transmission begins again
2016-09-13 03:58:40	dami0	vans163: that's also assuming all your hosts can handle 1gbps.
2016-09-13 03:59:17	vans163	dami0, Gollee: Afaik the speed of the light in the wire is neglible at local network distance, the switch overhead is negligle, the send and recv system calls + nic overhead is like 2000nano second at most?
2016-09-13 03:59:31	dami0	2k nano is 2ms
2016-09-13 03:59:37	Gollee	isn't 2000 nano like 2 ms

2016-09-13 07:16:44	inire	Frequently, with the low cost plus the high cost of my time, i tend to just purchase a new one
2016-09-13 07:16:51	zapotah	and their dismal support for the hardware is because the hardware itself is dismal

One VM will be running pfSense so I want it to bridge the vlan-tagged feed too.  Should i set up vlan interfaces off of bond0 and then bridge each of those as needed, or bridge the bond0 first and then set up vlan interfaces off of br0 ?

2016-09-13 08:48:43	zsoc	I have a consumer grade router that shows a list of devices connected to it, and some of them it knows what they are (will show like a windows 'computer' name, or it will recognize an iphone etc). What is the network protocol or service that would be used in this instance that broadcasts this device info to the router?
2016-09-13 08:48:58	lupine	zsoc: probably just the MAC addresses

2016-09-13 08:52:23	zsoc	Alright, upnp or mdns. Got it. I'm looking specifically because the router has some (unconfigurable) dnsmasq implementation and i want to see if i can hijack it to make it do what i want, rather then try to run my own around it heh.
2016-09-13 08:52:40	disi	i currently forward email from gmail to a forward-only email that forwards to my real email... is there a max number of forwards before a service will refuse to send my mail thru? is that just up to each service?
2016-09-13 08:52:53	zsoc	teprrr: yes, and it resolves it as a hostname also on LAN (so maybe mdns..)

2016-09-13 08:53:17	teprrr	netbios, upnp instead of it

2016-09-13 09:03:45	zsoc	So then that's my problem. The client isn't sending anything because it's assigning itself an address in the same subnet (although outside of the dhcp range)
2016-09-13 09:04:05	brianx	there you go.
2016-09-13 09:04:07	zsoc	So then there's no good way to broadcast this name except dhclient or the like
2016-09-13 09:04:52	lupine	the client can include a hostname in its request
2016-09-13 09:05:00	brianx	on my dnsmasq using router device, there is an option to assign a static IP and if you do that, the entry gets into the list of names even if the client never sends a dhcp request.

In this router the only way to assign this info is by putting it in the DHCP reservation table.. which means the ip must be in the dhcp range. It's alright, I'll make it work.

2016-09-13 11:16:31	networknoob	i am trying to setup untangle as a 2nd router on my home network. I have a cable modem running into a dumb switch, which runs into both a hardware router that I have my main network on as well as a dl360 that i have esxi > untangle on. So im trying to use this untangle VM as an "edge router" right behind my cable modem > switch
2016-09-13 11:17:48	networknoob	but i cannot get it to pickup a dhcp address, nor can get it to connect with any static config i've thrown at it. So my questions are: can i split my cable modem into 2 different routers? if so, why is my untangle VM not seeing any IP? I have confirmed the NICS and MAC's line up and im using the right nic port connection to my VM
2016-09-13 11:17:51	squib	cable modems typically only assign 1 IP address which is probably bound to your first router
2016-09-13 11:18:28	networknoob	that was my concern, any way around this or any way to confirm this with my ISP?

2016-09-13 11:20:03	_AxS_	squib: depends, most ISPs around here give you two - mainly because people tend to forget to set bridge mode and the ISPs dont want to bother helping them un-set it.  This is more common on DSL though
2016-09-13 11:20:14	squib	if you intend to publish any reachable services or applications on your untangle router, you will first have to publish on the 1st router
2016-09-13 11:20:46	squib	other than that not much difference. it's just IP subnetting and routing
2016-09-13 11:20:46	networknoob	thats what i was trying to avoid, so now i have to configure rules both on untangle and my hardware router to publish it to the internet?

Then we had 'internet of people' as devices became more portable... now with have Internet of Things where 'things' are on the internet (ie. WITHOUT people). Things with sensors on them will upload their status to the internet for people to use. Eg. wether stations etc

2016-09-13 14:34:24	Jaykaye	basically saying that in the past if something was on the internet it was controlled by a person. Now, we have things on the internet that arent interacted with people.... they have sensors to do their own thing and upload data to be used by people
2016-09-13 14:34:47	Jaykaye	Its not, its the next step up in the tech ladder... I build IoT and embedded devices for a job

2016-09-13 21:12:39	Simon_	Sorry for repeating the question, had to reboot. If I want to PC_A to start a program over internet in PC_B, when both machines run Windows, my options are: ssh, or a background process that listen to TCP/IP and starts the desired program when a certain messaged is received. Does this make sense, or are there better solutions?

2016-09-14 07:36:11	skyroveRR	Is it typical for an edge router running linux to receive IGMP traffic? I don't do IGMP anywhere, and yet there's a sizeable number of packets at the edge (saw a couple of them intermittently over a period of time)
2016-09-14 07:36:12	+pppingme	ZombieAnon whats the goal of your vpn?  to get back to your own network?

2016-09-14 13:00:40	nightrider97	good day all.  I have a question about vlan.  I havent done vlan yet but I am kinda researching about it to understand it and how it differs to what I currently know about routers.  so on router, I can configure dhcp there and the ports may go directly to computer or to another switch or hub.   But on switch configured with vlan, does the connection from its port should ONLY be directly to computer OR can also be to another switch / hub ?
2016-09-14 13:01:41	+catphish	nightrider97: you can still chain multiple switches together
2016-09-14 13:02:11	+catphish	VLAN is just a way of dividing up one physical switch to act like multiple virtual switches on different network
2016-09-14 13:02:39	shrdlu68	I have an OVH-networked (kimsufi) server. I can't ping6 anything successfully. What could be the problem? The machine has a global-scope IPV4.
2016-09-14 13:03:50	_AxS_	nightrider97: think of vlans as separating your switch and physical ports into individual units.  IE, instead of having 2 switches, you can have two vlans' separating the ports that are on one switch.

2016-09-14 13:37:32	dwsr	forgotten: The problem is that the kernel panics because of lack of a kernel driver for the MSFT Virtual disk.
2016-09-14 13:37:36	Mr_Midnight	I'm not sure if the Linux box that it runs would be able to get the necessary drivers to run on Hyper-V even though in theory it should...  However it is Cisco so who knows if they allow it to go download drivers

2016-09-14 13:39:15	Mr_Midnight	and Cisco's only workarounds are a) log less or b) use Firesight management on ESXi instead of the built in

2016-09-14 14:00:53	TandyUK	if its a single site, we do the server as a full blown gui with hyperv, and all mgmt tools, and all other services run on dedicated core vms

2016-09-14 14:01:09	hypercube32	one phys nic can now do all the virtual nics with the new intel cards, so may see that also
2016-09-14 14:01:15	Viddax	Yea that port appear to connect to another switch
2016-09-14 14:01:23	TandyUK	tiny customers with hardly any users and a single on premises server
2016-09-14 14:01:32	Mr_Midnight	Viddax: need to go into that other switch then and find it

2016-09-14 14:04:01	Mr_Midnight	hypercube32: he used to be a highly paid consultant that I worked alongside of at another job so I know he can actually do the majority of the management
2016-09-14 14:04:06	dwsr	Mr_Midnight: And unless he can demonstrate that he has superior technical knowledge, he can't be a domain admin
2016-09-14 14:04:06	_AxS_	hypercube32: heh, require knowledge of how to root a system before they're allowed to do it the official way? :)
2016-09-14 14:04:10	hypercube32	Mr_Midnight, ive done even more, i pulled all root and sudo su - (to get to shell) from everyone in entire companies and they flip out for about 10 days, then are fine after that like nothing happened

2016-09-14 14:04:55	Mr_Midnight	hypercube32: yup I'm trying to pull domain admin from one person's User account and force him to use his domain admin account when he goes into servers so he doesn't logon locally as a domain admin but he is trying to fight it
2016-09-14 14:05:06	hypercube32	dwsr, start with all things new thats the way its gonna be and start migrating now
2016-09-14 14:05:12	dwsr	Mr_Midnight: Then it's simple. Constrain his domain admin account.

2016-09-14 14:49:16	devilspgd	It would make for a miserable experience if you had to touch a switch whenever this happened, so unmanaged switches just cache based on what they've seen. When a machine moves, it sends a packet (any packet), the switch updates it's table and routes traffic to that new port.
2016-09-14 14:50:01	devilspgd	Managed switches can do all sorts of cleverness if programmed to do so, depending on the switch, but it's generally not necessary.

2016-09-14 16:05:08	turtzuo_	Anyone have experience with remote app terminal services on a LAN with 1Gb server>1Gb Switch>Patch>Wall>100Mb IP phone>1Gb PC? Previous guy had the phones installed and they're all 100Mb, limiting the PC's to 100Mb with POE coming from the switch. Am I wrong to throw a 5 port hub at each wall jack, and get power adapters for the phones to get things to 1Gb at the PC?

2016-09-14 16:38:49	BenderRodriguez	I believe it uses WiFi direct to make a point-to-point link with your configuration device
2016-09-14 16:39:00	BenderRodriguez	In such case, you would need to use the Chromecast config tool that Google provides

2016-09-14 16:42:04	BenderRodriguez	You must first use one of the chromecast apps on your phone or the windows installer google provides to set it up
2016-09-14 16:42:25	sly_f0xxx	i don't have a compatible android device and im using linux

2016-09-14 16:43:42	Network2501	you could download the android SDK
2016-09-14 16:43:44	BenderRodriguez	either way you'll probably end up doing some manual labor to get it configured
2016-09-14 16:43:49	Network2501	emulate an android device

2016-09-14 16:45:54	BenderRodriguez	I think you can also configure via iOS/Apple

2016-09-14 23:54:28	shingshang	so, what are my options for if I want to monitor the bandwidth usage of devices in my house? an expensive router?
2016-09-14 23:54:52	shingshang	between me and my family members' iOS devices (which downloads ios updates so secretly in the background) and all the streaming, internet gets slow as at times
2016-09-14 23:54:53	djph	allamoox: connect to something other than 802.11g
2016-09-14 23:55:15	shingshang	or should I get a dedicated PC to do all the network routing?

2016-09-14 23:56:20	allamoox	djph:   What do you mean? It's the only Network card I have now.. and I have no way to upgrade the computer
2016-09-14 23:56:26	allamoox	is  there is any software solution?
2016-09-14 23:56:42	djph	allamoox: read the screenshot, the computer believes it's connected to an 802.11g AP
2016-09-14 23:57:38	allamoox	I have router .. and the router is connected to Access Point.. and from this Access point My computer connect to the internet
2016-09-14 23:57:39	djph	given that the SSID is "TP_LINK" ... I'd say you have a crap all-in-one router and should probably replace it
2016-09-14 23:57:55	allamoox	as I don't have a port for RJ45
2016-09-14 23:57:55	djph	or, you have a crap AP, and should replace it

2016-09-14 23:58:50	djph	Or, your AP is misconfigured; and you should fix it
2016-09-14 23:58:51	allamoox	so there are no other way
2016-09-14 23:59:09	allamoox	the only solution is a hardware upgrade?
2016-09-14 23:59:23	djph	well, if you're only using an 802.11g AP, an 802.11ac card in your PC won't matter
2016-09-14 23:59:38	djph	You've not said anything about what the AP is
2016-09-15 00:01:25	allamoox	but 802.11 g cann allow up to  54 Mbit/s
2016-09-15 00:01:31	allamoox	So it would be decent speed
2016-09-15 00:01:51	allamoox	I will try to get all the details
2016-09-15 00:02:10	allamoox	It's just a family computer located oversea... and I don't have physical access to it
2016-09-15 00:02:38	djph	assuming a perfect environment (no interference, few other APs on the same channel, no obstructions), yes, you can get 54mbps PHY and approx 20 mbps throughput one way

2016-09-15 02:22:10	lunaphyte	in that scenario, you wouldn't really have "two" wireless networks.  you'd have one, and one of the two access point would connect to the other, just like a client would [more or less], and ast as a bridge, as nazarewk says
2016-09-15 02:22:32	Haris	yep
2016-09-15 02:22:35	Haris	that's the scenario
2016-09-15 02:22:39	Haris	from the image
2016-09-15 02:23:16	lunaphyte	so it's just a matter of is your equipment capable.  it should be easy to determine that by inspecting the configuration interface and consulting the documentation

2016-09-15 08:43:00	Phenx_	I have a wcf service running as a singleton insatance basically its an http listener currently, but I need to be able to have a healthcheck status that can be called from another client while the currently run singleton (http listener) is doing work. My immediate goal is to be able to make calls to which will hook into a delegate event that I already have implemented which is basically an event variable that is the State of
2016-09-15 08:43:00	Phenx_	the service. I need to be able to get that state every minute or so. So basically the idea is that my method will poll the service for the state continuously and client can ask for that state while service is doing work. Anyone know the best way to setup a wcf service to be able to have multi threads or do i even need multi thread? Could i use something like service bus?

2016-09-15 08:48:41	potatoe	A friend signed up for a domain hosting service, and redirected his NS settings at the registrar to point to the companies nameservers. However, even after a day, there is no A record being shown and only SOA on the dig. Now I'm not familiar with this host and I usually host baremetal/AWS so can I ask if this is normal?

2016-09-15 12:26:24	Neutron-sl	you can try disabling it if it's on..
2016-09-15 12:26:31	Neutron-sl	it can make or break the performance..
2016-09-15 12:26:35	Neutron-sl	or not make a change at all

When I connected the laptop directly to the modem with a working cat5, I was able to run DHCP client and get an external IP. I used that IP as an IP for the upstream port on the router and added a default routing rule that matched what the laptop got after running

2016-10-01 15:08:53	_yitz	However, getting told external hosts are still not reachable when I try to ping from the router.

2016-10-01 16:48:22	Ouroboros	i vaguely remember that was a thing for older protocols/older version of wireshark
2016-10-01 16:50:17	Ouroboros	basically you would need the private key if you couldnt dump these temporary keys (whatever they are actually called), but that doesnt work now anyway because of ephemeral cipher suites and perferct forward secrecy and all that

2016-10-01 16:50:57	SporkWitch	Ouroboros: i don't see how that would work.  asymmetric keys are not used for bulk encryption, they're used to encrypt the symmetric key to be used for the bulk encryption.

2016-10-01 16:52:17	BenderRodriguez	For basic home network firewall setup, do I need anything more than an inbound rule on the WAN interface to drop invalid packets?

2016-10-01 16:52:22	SporkWitch	Ouroboros: if that's true, that's an abysmal implementation, as it means that the transit key is mathematically related to the private key.  That means that since I, the client, have the private key, and the logs, i could derive your private key.
2016-10-01 16:52:23	BenderRodriguez	invalid and new*

2016-10-01 16:58:44	SporkWitch	what i'm talking about is that if the private key lets you obtain a transit key (for which a copy no longer exists), then it follows that you might be able to derive the private key from the transit key.
2016-10-01 16:59:32	Ouroboros	SporkWitch: and you are implying since the latter is obviously false, then the premise is also false?

2016-10-01 16:59:57	SporkWitch	when we talk about, for instance, pgp lacking forward secrecy, it's because the transit key is stored WITH the encrypted file.  The bundle includes the encrypted payload, as well as the symmetric key that was used to encrypt it.  This symmetric key is encrypted with the public keys of the intended recipients.  As a result, if i have the encrypted file and your privkey, i have the transit key, i

2016-10-01 17:04:48	Ouroboros	you need to make a dump file and a key file for it, and just work with that

2016-10-01 17:08:22	SporkWitch	the reason to do deterministic systems is use-cases such as lastpass, where you don't want to have the hash stored anywhere.  The encryption key used to secure your vault is deterministically generated by the combination of your account email, passphrase, and a couple other things; the idea is that lastpass themselves never have anything but the encrypted vaults themselves, and you generate your
2016-10-01 17:08:40	SporkWitch	private key deterministically when you "log in" (actually decrypting your local copy of the vault)
2016-10-01 17:08:51	yitz	Huh. I didn't know Lastpass does that.

2016-10-01 18:38:40	HEROnymous	yeah?  I don't really pay any attention to that stuff (I use a ubiquiti edgerouter at home, even, and it's great for my setup with two internet connections, some PBR to use them fancy-ways, and some ipsec tunnels.)
2016-10-01 18:38:41	nando293921	SporkWitch: Can you give me a example of a highend soho model.

2016-10-01 18:39:42	HEROnymous	there's definitely a market there.  lots of places that don't need enterprise-level power, but want something better than, y'know, a typical soho junker.
2016-10-01 18:39:44	SporkWitch	nando293921: the main difference is going to be capacity, ports, and user interface; SOHO you're still looking at a GUI (though the asus offerings support telnet and ssh in a busybox shell)

2016-10-02 03:16:01	+pppingme	two ways, you can add the keys to sysctl to make it (and I forget their names off the top of my head), or you can use ebtables (essentially iptables at L2).

2016-10-02 03:19:49	+pppingme	its horrible because you shouldn't bridge wifi and ethernet on the same box

2016-10-02 03:20:25	skyroveRR	pppingme: o.O why not?
2016-10-02 03:20:42	skyroveRR	openwrt does that by default..
2016-10-02 03:20:50	genec	drac_boy: have you bothered looking at the signal levels?  do you have an issue at the current time?
2016-10-02 03:21:03	drac_boy	and hmm it -does- have to be a new antenna .. because tbh the old (and often faulty, probably from running hot a bit at times) wireless is actually a wrt54g in less than ideal position wifi-wise and these antennas on it doesn't even look like type n's at all
2016-10-02 03:21:16	+pppingme	using a real AP is always best..  something about hanging a computer off the ceiling just doesn't work as well
2016-10-02 03:21:53	skyroveRR	You mean to say you shouldn't  use the wireless chipset at all that comes with the router? O.o

2016-10-02 03:21:56	drac_boy	new setup is a solid giga-rated router to be placed under the table instead .. and then a poe cable off it to run the small wap mounted in a much better position several feet away :)
2016-10-02 03:22:15	+pppingme	my routers don't do wifi
2016-10-02 03:22:17	drac_boy	kinda nice to only need one single power cord for two separate network boxes this way

2016-10-02 03:23:18	genec	drac_boy: but have you tested your WAP yet?  without proper data, you can't be sure which antenna will fit better.  7dBi gain antenna may form a torridal shape and reduce coverage above the antenna

2016-10-02 04:38:15	genec	Swyper: subnet ID is the first IP of a subnet.  broadcast is last.  for 192.0.2.16/28 (same subnet mask as yours), what's the subnet ID?  broadcast IP address?

2016-10-02 04:39:54	Swyper	genec I understand that, I mean what I am confused about is like the range, do I write out 200.200.200.0-200.200.200.15, 200.200.200.16 - 200.200.200.31 and keep going like that for the range ? or is just 0-15, 16-31 etc ?
2016-10-02 04:40:16	rapha	genec: there's a grey distribution box that /might/ be our relatives' DSLAM down the street in which case distance would be around 200M. Not sure though. Deutsche Telekom say they've measured the signal and it's of very good quality. IMO the pipe supplying the village's DSLAMs with internet is too thin.
2016-10-02 04:40:30	Swyper	I get that the block size is 16
2016-10-02 04:40:31	genec	Swyper: the range would be the first form.
2016-10-02 04:41:15	Swyper	ahh alright, also what would be the difference between valid host range and range ? Valid host range does not include the subnet ID and Broadcast address right ?

2016-10-02 04:41:59	rapha	genec: another question about that multiple-AP-one-SSID-one-gateway-setup. If the TP-Link router only gives out IPs between 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.254, that's not a DHCP limitation but that router's firmare's limitation, correct?
2016-10-02 04:42:04	genec	Swyper: right.  typically the first and last IP addresses in a subnet are not usable.
2016-10-02 04:42:34	genec	rapha: probably.
2016-10-02 04:42:41	genec	rapha: what's the actual subnet?
2016-10-02 04:43:27	Swyper	genec so 200.200.200.1-200.200.200.14 is the correct format to write it in?

2016-10-02 05:40:07	wonderer	do i take out ports out of vlan so their solely become UPLINK ports?
2016-10-02 05:40:22	BenderRodriguez	Tools: well, you'll have to do some custom coding, but Windows 10 has a notification API
2016-10-02 05:40:31	Tools	I could stay using PushBullet on Android, but that has a limit for free accounts. :p
2016-10-02 05:40:35	BenderRodriguez	You just open a TCP port to listen on, and on received, show the toast
2016-10-02 05:40:47	genec	wonderer: use the text menu interface.  HP will use tag/untag on that 29xx
2016-10-02 05:41:06	Tools	Yeah, well, that'll be a problem as it will be a corporate network which won't allow incoming connections. >:(

2016-10-02 05:41:40	wonderer	but liek i said before
2016-10-02 05:41:41	genec	wonderer: untagged, aka native, VLAN will exit the port without a tag.  tagged will have an 802.1q tag indicating VLAN membership
2016-10-02 05:41:46	wonderer	cant seem to get this working
2016-10-02 05:41:58	Tools	Well, that could work, but then I'd still need a different push client on my android, as previously mentioned; PB is only limited for free users. :p
2016-10-02 05:42:26	wonderer	i understand the tag/untag
2016-10-02 05:42:37	genec	wonderer: let's say vlan 1; untag 1-16,A1; vlan 2; untag 17-32; tag A1; vlan 3 untag 33-48; tag A1.
2016-10-02 05:42:39	wonderer	but how to get A1 as an uplink?
2016-10-02 05:42:42	Tools	Then the new question would be: Does anyone know of any PushBullet alternatives to receive push messages on phone (that will have >500 push messages for a free account)?
2016-10-02 05:42:58	wonderer	right
2016-10-02 05:42:59	Kappa	genec: secure as in having the same type of encryption and no ip or dns leaks when using applications inside the VM while on the main I can continue using the normal stuff without VPN
2016-10-02 05:42:59	nupro	tools, amazon sns. Apparently microsoft also has one called wns
2016-10-02 05:43:06	genec	wonderer: but you need to know the VLAN config of the 1950

2016-10-02 05:45:13	genec	wonderer: btw, we typically just drop printers into an IP range that's not issued via DHCP in the PC data subnet since we don't need the two separated.

2016-10-02 05:46:04	genec	wonderer: the SOLE issue I've seen was a bunch of i217/i218 NICs spewing a 3Mb/s multicast stream, knocking devices offline due to CPU saturation

2016-10-02 05:53:37	BenderRodriguez	Your make a small android app that will send notifications to google, then your windows client will poll google for any notifications queued up

2016-10-02 10:40:09	datarubber	the ISP doesn't have a full ipv6 network internally (yet) - and to offer ipv6 addresses to the outside world, the isp maps internal ipv4 to ipv6 - but not like a nat - but with a range of valid ipv6 addresses

2016-10-02 12:31:09	s0cks	and looking at the bottom it should be orange-white on the far left.
2016-10-02 12:31:27	 *	s0cks had to go look, never remembers either, despite doing this all the damn time.
2016-10-02 12:31:35	gp5st	s0cks: bottom being the clipless side?
2016-10-02 12:31:38	s0cks	yes.
2016-10-02 12:31:57	gp5st	its backwards then
2016-10-02 12:31:58	s0cks	bottom as you described "bottom" before - opposite the clip.
2016-10-02 12:32:13	devilspgd	s0cks: Me too. I can cut and wire ethernet without looking at the diagram, but I still need it in front of me if I stop to think about it.

2016-10-02 12:32:24	gp5st	is there a better term? honestly curious
2016-10-02 12:32:43	devilspgd	Although I mostly buy pre-cut cables now if I'm not going into a patch panel.
2016-10-02 12:32:45	s0cks	idk i've wondered that myself. i call it the bottom too so.
2016-10-02 12:32:58	gp5st	ok
2016-10-02 12:33:12	gp5st	well, yeah, if that is my issue, it's not a hard one to solve

2016-10-02 12:33:21	s0cks	devilspgd: i refuse to pay $20 for a 6' pre-terminated cat5e cable.
2016-10-02 12:33:23	gp5st	i guess i wish he would have tested them before leaving though
2016-10-02 12:33:55	gp5st	s0cks: i used to go to a goodwill with computer parts
2016-10-02 12:33:57	gp5st	far cheaper
2016-10-02 12:34:07	gp5st	now i have a crimper, so it's even cheaper

2016-10-02 12:34:46	devilspgd	s0cks: Amazon.ca's first hit is a 5 pack for that price. You can do better with monoprice.com or others, although from Canada shipping is pricy.
2016-10-02 12:34:52	soloz	so how do you get skills close to what ICANN uses?

2016-10-02 12:35:23	s0cks	i have a crimper, rj45 & a big box of cat5e
2016-10-02 12:35:41	s0cks	devilspgd: if i need 6ft of cat5e i don't have time to wait for shipping :p
2016-10-02 12:35:59	devilspgd	But when you're ordering a new patch panel and need 48 keystone jacks, wall plates, and everything else, it's nice to have 24 1' precut ones coming off the panel to the switch
2016-10-02 12:36:01	soloz	s0cks, you program with C#?
2016-10-02 12:36:04	gp5st	soloz: law school? i'm sure they have a legal team
2016-10-02 12:36:19	soloz	laws of fiber optics and networking
2016-10-02 12:36:19		[12:36]
2016-10-02 12:36:27	s0cks	soloz: negative.
2016-10-02 12:36:29	devilspgd	But for a handful of custom length cables, I've got a 1000' box a few feet from me right now :)
2016-10-02 12:37:13	soloz	C++?
2016-10-02 12:37:15	s0cks	see if i'm ordering a new patch panel the customer is paying and idgaf :p
2016-10-02 12:38:07	s0cks	soloz: perl and bash, mostly. i rarely do anything which would require C/C++/C#.
2016-10-02 12:38:13	s0cks	though I'm passingly familiar with them.

2016-10-02 12:38:56	soloz	is perl handy?
2016-10-02 12:39:03	SB^Omega	nice
2016-10-02 12:39:07	soloz	with sockets
