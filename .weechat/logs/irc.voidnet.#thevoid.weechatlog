2016-09-15 06:35:27	halfwit	Heh, neat 
2016-09-15 06:35:47	skope	why flac
2016-09-15 06:38:59	voidead	skope› why not?
2016-09-15 06:39:28	voidead	jerring› also why did they record the conversation?
2016-09-15 06:39:43	skope	seems pretty overpower for cassette recording
2016-09-15 06:40:06	halfwit	When my mom was alive, we got a videocamera and just recorded her chatting at the table 
2016-09-15 06:40:18	skope	you still have the recording?
2016-09-15 06:40:21	halfwit	It's on a VHS somewhere, but no one has a fucking VCR anymore
2016-09-15 06:40:25	skope	i have
2016-09-15 06:40:32	skope	and i have lots of vhs cassettes
2016-09-15 06:40:35	halfwit	Nice
2016-09-15 06:40:38	jerring	i dont know, i figured id use the best quality for everything, its a super shitting recording, not sure who or why they were recording it
2016-09-15 06:40:55	skope	yeah, you can't improve the quality by processing it to flac
2016-09-15 06:41:03	skope	it just takes disk space unnecessarily
2016-09-15 06:41:11	skope	but on the other hand, it's just one recording
2016-09-15 06:41:15	skope	so it doesn't matter
2016-09-15 06:41:21	skope	i wish i'd have some recordings of my dad
2016-09-15 06:41:28	skope	would be nice to hear his voice again
2016-09-15 06:42:38	voidead	I'm glad my cousin has a lot of recordings of his guitar and voice etc..

2016-09-15 06:44:05	skope	pillu means pussy in finnish
2016-09-15 06:47:01	jerring	what difference does it make if its flac or mp3 or wav though
2016-09-15 06:47:01		[06:47]
2016-09-15 06:47:05	jerring	why not use flac
2016-09-15 06:48:20	skope	space when you got lots of files
2016-09-15 06:50:07	jerring	fucking around with audacity and the effects
2016-09-15 06:50:18	voidead	jerring› all I have to say about that is.. if you have a .wav file then convert it to .flac as its the same quality but .wav is a shitty format
2016-09-15 06:50:55	voidead	converting .wav or .flac to .mp3 doesn't make sense unless you are trying to save space as skope put it
2016-09-15 06:51:00	voidead	even then you lose quality
2016-09-15 06:52:20	Max`P	wav<>flac not, mp3/ogg/aac yes
2016-09-15 06:53:27	skope	but when the source is bad, you don't lose that much quality
2016-09-15 06:53:33	skope	with mp3 etc converting
2016-09-15 06:53:39	voidead	yeah if the source is bad.. its bad regardless
2016-09-15 06:53:49	voidead	you can't add data if it isn't there
2016-09-15 06:53:51	skope	afaik it just cuts out some frequencies which are not in there in this case
2016-09-15 06:54:25	voidead	the main reason I converted all my .wav files to .flac was because mpd doesn't play .wav files
2016-09-15 06:54:36	skope	it doesn't?
2016-09-15 06:54:39	skope	whoa
2016-09-15 06:54:48	voidead	skope› well it _did_
2016-09-15 06:54:56	voidead	and a new update made it so it didn't anymore
2016-09-15 06:54:58	voidead	either way
2016-09-15 06:55:00	voidead	fuck wav
2016-09-15 06:55:10	skope	wat :D
2016-09-15 06:55:40	voidead	cmus will play .wav though
2016-09-15 06:55:45	voidead	but I prefer mpd

2016-09-15 06:59:32	voidead	ncmpcpp is merely the frontend for mpd

2016-09-15 07:53:28	cirkit	did some update remove certain fonts ST depended on?

2016-09-15 07:53:56	cirkit	well glad it's working for you now
2016-09-15 07:54:00	voidead	probably a bunch of bullshit fonts in that directory that needed to be removed
2016-09-15 07:54:14	voidead	yeah seriousl
2016-09-15 07:54:17	voidead	seriously*
2016-09-15 07:54:21	voidead	I was losing my fucking mind
2016-09-15 07:55:00	voidead	I thought it had something to do with the code or fontconfig.. all sorts of shit
2016-09-15 07:55:28	voidead	but when my laptop is working fine and my desktop isn't.. then I just thought.. well it must be related to the fonts on my laptop
2016-09-15 07:55:37	voidead	which both computers use the same fonts
2016-09-15 07:55:46	voidead	so I have no idea why it wasn't working in the first place lol
2016-09-15 07:55:53	voidead	anyways
2016-09-15 07:56:06	voidead	I completely removed the directory and synced my laptop's directory to it
2016-09-15 07:56:09	voidead	and bam it works
2016-09-15 07:56:46	cirkit	that is just weird...were any fonts removed from the desktop prior to ST acting up?
2016-09-15 07:57:04	voidead	not really nah
2016-09-15 07:57:13	cirkit	hmm
2016-09-15 07:57:14	voidead	everything was exactly the same as it was when ST was working

2016-09-15 08:42:32	cirkit	voidead: why would a professor go to prison for having sex with students? I mean, if the students are of legal age and all..
2016-09-15 08:43:24	voidead	cirkit› no lie.. my professor said he found some panties laying in one of the chairs in the classroom.. and he saw it while giving a lecture.. he said he immediately says "and that is how we..... there are some pink panties laying in this chair hmmm... thats how we get the raster data for the map" he didn't even react lol
2016-09-15 08:43:51	cirkit	goddamn lolol
2016-09-15 08:44:25	voidead	cirkit› well its against the law for a professor to have sex with a student

2016-09-16 16:57:12	voidead	apparently
2016-09-16 16:57:19	voidead	even after changing my fontconfig
2016-09-16 16:57:30	voidead	nothing affects the Korean and Japanese fonts displayed
2016-09-16 16:57:49	voidead	only termite changes lol
2016-09-16 16:58:00	voidead	termite has consistently been my go to terminal
2016-09-16 16:58:04	voidead	so it will stay that way
2016-09-16 16:58:29	alyptik	voidead: first world problems brother
2016-09-16 16:58:31	alyptik	you and me both
2016-09-16 16:58:35	voidead	yeah lol
2016-09-16 16:58:56	voidead	its whatever.. I just wanted to fix whatever was fucked up honestly I don't really even care about the terminal lol
2016-09-16 16:59:27	voidead	"it's broken... GOD DAMMIT" "*fixed*.. ok I'll never use that application again"

2016-09-16 17:01:37	voidead	this is funny.. because Seoul's subway system is extremely efficient and not that complicated
2016-09-16 17:03:33	voidead	also.. my cousin is an idiot
2016-09-16 17:03:46	voidead	so she assumes that because I teach English
2016-09-16 17:04:15	voidead	I can you know.. somehow teach her kids because they are being homeschooled.. like.. teach them remotely here in Korea
2016-09-16 17:04:23	voidead	she must be out of her fucking mind
2016-09-16 17:04:38	alyptik	voidead: charge her like 100 bucks/hour
2016-09-16 17:05:01	voidead	I'm teaching Korean kids a _second_ language and helping them with understanding two different languages.. I'm not teaching native English kids
2016-09-16 17:05:49	voidead	alyptik› get this.. she said "call me at ***-***-**** I really need your help with some grammar questions" LOL
2016-09-16 17:06:12	voidead	I'm going to call her from Seoul Korea on my regular phone?
2016-09-16 17:06:16	voidead	god damn she is stupid
2016-09-16 17:06:31	voidead	I haven't called anyone from my regular phone yet
2016-09-16 17:06:41	voidead	I use the internet for voice calls and shit
2016-09-16 17:06:48	alyptik	rofl wow
2016-09-16 17:06:52	voidead	it would be extremely expensive to call someone that far away
2016-09-16 17:07:08	voidead	this is on Facebook too.. so I just ignore it lol
2016-09-16 17:07:16	voidead	she can keep messaging me all she wants I won't answer
2016-09-16 17:08:52	voidead	even after telling this bitch at least twice.. she still doesn't understand that _anything_ she already knows about English I also know.. in order to teach her kids she needs to actually go to school and learn some advanced concepts in English in order for her teaching to be effective for her kids
2016-09-16 17:08:57	voidead	thats my suggestion to her
2016-09-16 17:08:58	voidead	but nah.. 
2016-09-16 17:09:31	voidead	the kids I teach are just trying to comprehend a new language 
2016-09-16 17:09:42	voidead	they haven't even learned much of their own language yet
2016-09-16 17:09:43	+Anna	a lot of fucking crap
2016-09-16 17:11:24	voidead	so like.. asking me about some "grammar questions" is dumb as she should already be able to answer them
2016-09-16 17:11:38	voidead	unless she failed English
2016-09-16 17:12:23	voidead	I think what killed me was when she puts her cellphone number down and is like "hey when you get a chance call me at this number"

2016-09-16 17:15:59	voidead	I'm going to ignore her and see how angry and desperate she gets.. and if she still doesn't get it I'll finally say something lol
2016-09-16 17:16:50	voidead	she can you know.. hire a tutor... or refresh herself on some English concepts etc.. its not that fucking hard god damn she is teaching her own kids at home.. she has plenty of time to figure that shit out
2016-09-16 17:16:58	alyptik	any idea why tmux sends  ^[[1;5Q while it should be ^[[12^
2016-09-16 17:17:04	voidead	her husband works so she doesn't have anything to do during the day
2016-09-16 17:17:04	alyptik	for ^F2
2016-09-16 17:17:15	voidead	alyptik› probably $TERM issue

2016-09-16 17:17:19	voidead	issues*
2016-09-16 17:18:21	alyptik	happens with xterm, screen, and tmux
2016-09-16 17:18:22	alyptik	QQ
2016-09-16 17:18:24	voidead	alyptik› I think she doesn't send her kids to school not because she is against it.. she just wants to save money because public schools in that area suck ass and private schools are _way_ too expensive.. so that makes sense but if you are going to homeschool your kids you better have your shit together
2016-09-16 17:18:40	voidead	alyptik› yeah but tmux uses its own $TERM regardless
2016-09-16 17:18:47	alyptik	oh shit

2016-09-16 17:26:27	voidead	but like my VPS.. I had to do that
2016-09-16 17:27:00	voidead	some computers don't have the terminal installed and don't have the terminfo
2016-09-16 17:27:13	voidead	so you have to just install the term info

2016-09-17 18:47:31	voidead	alyptik› well I didn't say its znc's fault 
2016-09-17 18:47:32	voidead	but
2016-09-17 18:47:49	voidead	I've been using weechat's irc proxy for a while and I like it much more than znc
2016-09-17 18:48:08	alyptik	i use weechat relay too
2016-09-17 18:48:13	alyptik	or is proxy diff?
2016-09-17 18:48:51	voidead	well its weechat's relay..but using the irc proxy instead of weechat's weechat protocol
2016-09-17 18:49:13	alyptik	ah
2016-09-17 18:49:17	alyptik	what's the diff?
2016-09-17 18:50:39	voidead	so my VPS has the main weechat session running and my local weechat is using that connection via the weechat relay.. the only difference is that its using the irc protocol instead of the weechat protocol.. this is because applications like glowing bear use the weechat protocol and the weechat devs don't want two weechat sessions relaying via the weechat protocol for some reason
2016-09-17 18:51:26	voidead	their argument is "well the irc protocol already exists and works fine between two irc clients.. so no reason to use the weechat protocol in that regard"
2016-09-17 18:51:49	voidead	in short.. the protocol is the only difference
2016-09-17 18:51:50	voidead	lol
2016-09-17 18:52:01	voidead	its still using the weechat relay

2016-09-17 18:55:38	voidead	just using weechat instead of znc

2016-09-17 20:17:16	Max`P	What is it about?
2016-09-17 20:18:06	cirkit	basically how Snowden started in the CIA before going to NSA
2016-09-17 20:18:13	cirkit	it was really interesting
2016-09-17 20:18:29	cirkit	Glenn Greenwald and others were there with him 
2016-09-17 20:18:41	cirkit	don't wanna spoil it, but i think a lot of it was pretty accurate 
2016-09-17 20:19:05	cirkit	SALUTE A TRUE PATRIOT LIKE EDWARD SNOWDEN

2016-09-17 20:20:03	voidead	there are negative consequences from what he did.. positive as well.. either way I'm glad he did it
2016-09-17 20:20:03		[20:20]
2016-09-17 20:20:06	cirkit	that dude is smart as fuck
2016-09-17 20:20:14	cirkit	the programs he wrote and all
2016-09-17 20:20:42	cirkit	yeah voidead it's unfortunate
2016-09-17 20:20:56	voidead	no good deed goes unpunished as they say
2016-09-17 20:20:59	cirkit	if you're not part of the system the way REAL criminals are (i.e Hillary Clinton) then you're treated differently
2016-09-17 20:21:01	voidead	which is true in this case
2016-09-17 20:21:10	cirkit	Clinton has done far WORSE and should be in prison
2016-09-17 20:21:45	voidead	Hillary isn't perfect.. but its either Trump or Hillary.. so
2016-09-17 20:22:28	voidead	noone likes Hillary.. in fact I wish Bill Clinton was running I'd vote for his ass
2016-09-17 20:23:34	voidead	but I've said it before voting won't make an impact on anything as its the ruling elite who decides what the president will do ultimately
2016-09-17 20:23:59	voidead	its not like the president has anyone's best interest in mind
2016-09-17 20:24:07	voidead	they are just some corporate monkey
2016-09-17 20:24:17	cirkit	they're just puppets essentially

2016-09-17 20:24:38	Max`P	Nice
2016-09-17 20:25:19	voidead	cirkit› however.. I will say this.. _any_ change good or bad is ultimately what the US needs at this point.. doing the same fucking thing over and over will only make it worse for everyone
2016-09-17 20:25:49	voidead	Obama promised change and he only brought political gridlock

2016-09-17 20:26:36	cirkit	Snowden made a statement in the movie where he talked about how he believes Obama would have been better...would have brought real actual change, but he was disappointed to find he was wrong
2016-09-17 20:26:43	cirkit	believed*
2016-09-17 20:27:14	cirkit	voidead: got weed but no niggers

2016-09-17 20:28:48	voidead	I don't agree 100% with what Snowden did.. ultimately he could have done all this shit anonymously or something but instead he wanted to give himself some media attention and become some martyr
2016-09-17 20:28:55	bridgesfreezefirst	honestly, if Obama were smart he would pardon Snowden before Putin has a chance to exploit him further
2016-09-17 20:29:00	cirkit	the Japanese waitress and I caught each other's eyes a few times lol
2016-09-17 20:29:06	bridgesfreezefirst	it's chess, not checkers

2016-09-17 20:30:34	cirkit	even Putin has made statements criticizing Obama and pretty much all US administrations
2016-09-17 20:30:45	cirkit	i like how Putin is very blunt and doesn't sugar coat things
2016-09-17 20:31:20	cirkit	Putin pretty much explained who created ISIS -- US leaders/government

2016-09-17 21:17:18	MHD	i never understood it
2016-09-17 21:17:37	MHD	i was saying in 2008 'this is all BS, sloganeering. he has nothing, wont change anything'
2016-09-17 21:17:55	MHD	but cos he's part of some racial fairytale everyone lost it for him
2016-09-17 21:20:42	voidead	yeah the whole reason he was voted twice was merely because of race

2016-09-18 17:57:51	cirkit	neat, LDAP queries now work over TLS from VPS #1 -> #2 and back \o
2016-09-18 17:57:58	cirkit	now need to setup replication
2016-09-18 17:58:04	cirkit	but first, weed
2016-09-18 17:59:04	halfwit	That sounds fancy, but not sure what exactly it all means
2016-09-18 18:00:49	cirkit	ideally i'd like to setup a slave LDAP node...already technically have a master LDAP host...basically data from the master LDAP server will copy to the slave LDAP server (vps #2) as read-only
2016-09-18 18:01:45	cirkit	so if Linode is DDoS'd or something then the 2nd node will continue serving LDAP 
2016-09-18 18:02:14	cirkit	that's just the start...then will need to configure the mail server's IMAP/SMTP to also do similar
2016-09-18 18:02:38	cirkit	or if Digital Ocean is DDoS'd hopefully Linode isn't at the same time LOL
2016-09-18 18:04:03	halfwit	Oh, that's fancy actually
2016-09-18 18:04:50	cirkit	it's just directory services is all
2016-09-18 18:05:19	halfwit	Yeah, but you described it so well.
2016-09-18 18:05:54	cirkit	Ah, thanks :P

2016-09-18 18:45:53	Max`P	It's not really used so I can force it blank

2016-09-18 18:47:35	alyptik	maybe Anna got stoned and deleted you by mistake
2016-09-18 18:47:41	Max`P	It's like you don't have an account... Maybe you didn't reregister since the last VoidNet in december?
2016-09-18 18:48:33	Max`P	I'm sure I saw you registered tho, that's really weird... Register again and hope it will stay o.O
2016-09-18 18:48:53	bridgesfreezefirst	ok Max`P i just sent the registration, but i didn't get a confirmation e-mail
2016-09-18 18:49:24	Max`P	Humm, that's prob still broke, will activate manually
2016-09-18 18:49:31	bridgesfreezefirst	you can activate me now?

2016-09-18 18:54:12	Max`P	The services weren't quite setted up until recently so it may have expired for some weird reason, settings should be a lot more saner and serious now

2016-09-20 05:31:19	voidead	but if more people are aware of the issue there might be more urgency to do something about it
2016-09-20 05:31:36	voidead	and of course.. put more sanctions on North Korea.. or hell.. even invade them
2016-09-20 05:32:20	halfwit1	I'm on board with it, the only shit part is that you're gonna end up killing innocents that were conscripted.
2016-09-20 05:32:23	voidead	invading North Korea would be a horrible horrible idea though
2016-09-20 05:32:39	halfwit1	I like the idea of a targetted takedown of the government, but that's very much non-trivial
2016-09-20 05:32:52	voidead	its like invading Iran 
2016-09-20 05:32:56	voidead	thats a horrible idea
2016-09-20 05:33:15	voidead	but you know.. everyone wants to use the US military to do their dirty work
2016-09-20 05:33:37	voidead	its not like South Korea can just invade North Korea on their own
2016-09-20 05:33:39	voidead	it would be nice though

2016-09-21 05:09:09	prg	i don't have some huge opinion one way or the other about the refugees but i mean just calling people racist for having different opinions is literally cancer
2016-09-21 05:09:32	voidead	well racist is a blanket term
2016-09-21 05:09:41	voidead	and doesn't even mean anything
2016-09-21 05:09:41	prg	its super overused
2016-09-21 05:09:44	prg	yeah
2016-09-21 05:09:50	prg	it should be saved for people that are actually racist
2016-09-21 05:10:04	voidead	I mean god damn.. humans are inherently racist.. unless we are all the same fucking race
2016-09-21 05:10:33	voidead	hell you may as well call everyone culturist too.. we are all different cultures as well
2016-09-21 05:10:44	prg	how dare you voidead :P
2016-09-21 05:10:45	jerring	i dont think so
2016-09-21 05:10:53	voidead	humans cannot and will not adhere to other people's way of life
2016-09-21 05:10:58	jerring	i think racsim is a learned thing
2016-09-21 05:11:24	jerring	its like religion almost
2016-09-21 05:11:29	jerring	indoctrination
2016-09-21 05:12:09	voidead	but the point I'm making is.. there shouldn't be some stigma at all with any of these terms.. they literally mean nothing at all and noone should be triggered because someone is different
2016-09-21 05:12:57	voidead	I think there should be one term for people who are violent.. assholism
2016-09-21 05:13:04	voidead	that pretty much explains it all
2016-09-21 05:13:16	prg	i just really wish people would stop throwing RACIST out there as soon as someone makes a point someone else doesn't agree with
2016-09-21 05:13:43	voidead	all these specific terms: homophobic, racist.. etc.. they are all pointing to one thing.. "you are a fucking asshole"
2016-09-21 05:14:07	jerring	my kids have no concept of race, muchless racism at this point.. unless youre talking about difference races of beings of course..

2016-09-21 05:14:22	voidead	jerring› yeah exactly
2016-09-21 05:14:30	prg	well that's the thing the term is so overloaded now
2016-09-21 05:14:41	prg	you point out a difference between racists around some people and its RACIST
2016-09-21 05:14:45	prg	between races**
2016-09-21 05:15:04	prg	facts are racist
2016-09-21 05:15:13	jerring	dont be racist prg
2016-09-21 05:15:16	voidead	I think the meaning of these terms have almost completely been washed away.. all of our cultures and races have mixed so much that racism is a thing of the past.. calling someone a racist is just as stupid as the thing they are accusing said racist of
2016-09-21 05:16:52	prg	yeah i hear you
2016-09-21 05:17:24	voidead	lets say.. you have _only_ white or _only_ black people living in one place.. and just within the past year or so (maybe lets roll this back to the 1700s or 1800s) well calling someone a racist makes sense.. because essentially they have no experience with any other race except their own.. hence why they are racist... fast forward to today.. being a racist is a fucking joke and calling people
2016-09-21 05:17:26	voidead	a racist is a fucking joke
2016-09-21 05:17:42	jerring	racism is GREAT for controlling people
2016-09-21 05:17:58	jerring	dudes in prison LOVE that shit
2016-09-21 05:18:23	voidead	but people use "racism" or even "terrorism" as buzzwords for something completely different from what those people should be called "violent assholes"

2016-09-21 05:21:44	prg	i did get hit up about this PHP job though.. normally not that interested in PHP but this company is designing a linux based router w/ a PHP web front end
2016-09-21 05:22:00	prg	could be interesting and they said they would pay way more than what i'm getting now
2016-09-21 05:23:59	prg	oh wow this company is partnered with the NSA to make router fw YIKES
2016-09-21 05:23:59		[05:23]
2016-09-21 05:24:22	prg	but it looks like the router would be for military/government so that makes sense i guess

2016-09-21 06:38:13	voidead	I'm sure its nice

2016-09-21 09:34:40	prg	i was interested in one position (the router fw position) and now they are trying to set me up interviews with companies i give 0 shits about and trying to pressure me into coming in to meet the recruiters for some fucking reason?
2016-09-21 09:34:56	prg	i would understand if i had no job, but then they also told me if i had no job they wouldn't be interested lol

2016-09-21 09:36:51	prg	that's how i feel
2016-09-21 09:36:52	Max`P	Wanting someone because he's got a job already? That's kinda stupid
2016-09-21 09:37:04	prg	well they were insinuating that if you don't have a job you're not qualified 
2016-09-21 09:37:10	prg	or less qualified
2016-09-21 09:37:15	prg	which is probably true in many cases
2016-09-21 09:37:45	Max`P	That's still pretty bullshit. If I were to look for a new job, I'd make sure to quit first because overlapping two jobs is a pain
2016-09-21 09:37:48	prg	but like they want me to drive to center city philly and just fucking talk with them about my skills so they can try to fit me somewhere.. during work hours
2016-09-21 09:38:20	prg	it is bullshit but it's also nice to be like "yeah i dont *need* this job; i like my job but would be willing to move if its worth my while"
2016-09-21 09:38:30	prg	and i'm fine interviewing with people while i have a job

2016-09-21 09:39:21	prg	they were like bragging themselves up "yeah we're one of the most reputable headhunters in philly etc" and then i get an email from one of the companies that i was interested in and they were like "so did they actually talk to you about this or are they a monster/indeed scraper?"
2016-09-21 09:39:32	Max`P	And not on the clock, that's just stupid
2016-09-21 09:39:42	prg	yeah def not on the clock
2016-09-21 09:39:56	Max`P	It's like they want you to lose your job
2016-09-21 09:40:21	prg	they set me up with this bullshit phone interview that i don't think i even agreed to
2016-09-21 09:40:32	Max`P	The whole thing contradicts with itself it's so bad, I'd just give them the finger
2016-09-21 09:40:37	prg	just sent me the email like "oh yeah so your phone interview with<shitty company idc/idk> is at <time>"
2016-09-21 09:41:14	prg	i'm going to do the phone interview i guess but i told him like dude i'm not this desperate chill out
2016-09-21 09:42:51	Max`P	Send them an email like "So, lets get this straight. You want me because I already have a job, because you consider unemployed people to be unqualified. Then you expect me to be available in the middle of my work day. So, you are guys are looking to hire people that take random days off to go to interviews for other companies, do I understand right
2016-09-21 09:42:51	Max`P	?"
2016-09-21 09:45:22	prg	lol i should
2016-09-21 09:46:06	prg	i sent the guy basically a thing saying "i appreciate your enthusiasm, but i'm not desperate enough for a job to the point where i'll have to reschedule my current work obligations just to talk in person with recruiters"
2016-09-21 09:48:36	prg	it's funny because the guy at the router fw gig is being super respectful of my time

2016-09-21 09:50:40	Max`P	Yeah, it's the first thing I do when someone approaches me. The recruiter is UNDER me. They're a client. They have to respect me if they want my business. Typically it filters out the bad companies that treat their employees like crap
2016-09-21 09:51:34	prg	exactly - like there is no reason that i should feel obligated to meet up with them like they are trying to do
2016-09-21 09:51:54	prg	i think its just the sales mentality... headhunting is the new phone sales you know?
2016-09-21 09:52:16	prg	"oh so you can come in on monday right?" "no? well how about sometime next week" like dude take a hint - never
2016-09-21 09:52:17	prg	fuck off

2016-09-21 09:54:04	Max`P	When we arrange a meeting if I'm interested, I ask _them_ when they are available and *I* find a hole in my schedule for them. I can be flexible a bit, but I'm certainly not gonna behave like if I was an employee there because I'm not

2016-09-21 13:53:57	Halfwit	cirkit: o/
2016-09-21 13:54:01	cirkit	Halfwit: cheers \o
2016-09-21 13:54:07	Halfwit	Did you do the interview shit?
2016-09-21 13:54:12	cirkit	not yet...that's Friday
2016-09-21 13:54:16	Halfwit	Oh ok.
2016-09-21 13:54:23	Halfwit	I'm excited for you.
2016-09-21 13:54:35	cirkit	went to my Psychiatrist and then got my LG's phone screen replaced
2016-09-21 13:54:42	Halfwit	Nice.
2016-09-21 13:55:06	cirkit	he wants me (psychiatrist) to see a therapist....i forgot what kind..there were like 2 types of therapist
2016-09-21 13:55:16	cirkit	he also prescribed Zoloft to me but i'm not very fond of taking pills
2016-09-21 13:55:20	cirkit	gonna toke
2016-09-21 13:55:52	cirkit	his 1st recommendation was Zoloft followed by Prozac and then Effexor 
2016-09-21 13:55:59	cirkit	but fuck Effexor...seems like it fucks up Max`P 
2016-09-21 13:56:02	Halfwit	Neither am I. So fucking little actual research is done on the long term, etc effects. It's like... They only fucking do anything reactively
2016-09-21 13:56:23	cirkit	he said he could be "wrong", but according to him he thinks i have PTSD and an anxiety disorder
2016-09-21 13:56:34	cirkit	but i think that's just his assumptions 
2016-09-21 13:56:45	Max`P	wat, PTSD? xD
2016-09-21 13:56:53	Max`P	What's your issues?
2016-09-21 13:57:05	cirkit	hi Max`P - PTSD stands for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
2016-09-21 13:57:14	cirkit	but i don't know if he is even correct on his analysis for me
2016-09-21 13:57:42	cirkit	Max`P: mainly anxiety i guess...some depression according to him
2016-09-21 13:57:52	cirkit	he doesn't think i'm autistic...but then again he isn't even 100% sure what i have lel
2016-09-21 13:58:17	cirkit	but anyway i'd rather not take zoloft...he wants to start me off with a light dosage...still need to pick it up from the pharmacy
2016-09-21 13:58:27	cirkit	but i think seeing a therapist would be way better
2016-09-21 13:58:37	cirkit	will probably take time to find one i really trust and all
2016-09-21 13:58:49	+Anna	Lel

2016-09-21 13:59:48	cirkit	Max`P: thank goodness you're not as fucked up as me

2016-09-21 13:59:51	Halfwit	lOL
2016-09-21 14:00:02	Halfwit	Fucking Anna, don't laugh at him!
2016-09-21 14:00:42	cirkit	i told my Psychiatrist i'd just prefer to toke weed since it helps me with the shit those pills allegedly help with
2016-09-21 14:00:49	cirkit	he nodded in agreement...i suspect he tokes too
2016-09-21 14:01:55	Max`P	I'd say Effexor helped me nicely, but you don't seem like you're having panic attacks or anything
2016-09-21 14:02:30	Max`P	And yeah I know what PTSD means, but do you know of anything that would have caused the trauma or did he just pull that straight out of his ass?
2016-09-21 14:03:52	cirkit	Max`P: childhood experiences going through abuse both mental and physical
2016-09-21 14:03:56	cirkit	so yeah, i'm fucked up
2016-09-21 14:04:12	Max`P	Ah, I see. Yeah...
2016-09-21 14:04:45	Max`P	You never talked about anything really so it's hard to know :P
2016-09-21 14:04:57	Max`P	Do you feel that affects you today?
2016-09-21 14:05:04	cirkit	according to him he said he doesn't see me fit with autism and he's worked with a lot of children and adults who were apparently autistic
2016-09-21 14:05:14	cirkit	yeah Max`P ...at times
2016-09-21 14:05:27	cirkit	i've gotten better, but it's still there
2016-09-21 14:05:43	Max`P	Seems like he might be right then

2016-09-21 14:09:03	cirkit	"Treatment for post traumatic stress disorder can involve counseling, cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, antidepressant drugs, antipsychotic medications, or a combination of one or more of these treatments."
2016-09-21 14:09:03		[14:09]
2016-09-21 14:09:25	cirkit	hmm...seems about right
2016-09-21 14:09:41	halfwit	I thought they had a bunch of successes with strange drugs lately
2016-09-21 14:10:49	cirkit	apparently what i'm reading states PTSD can lead to panic attacks too
2016-09-21 14:10:55	cirkit	Max`P: so wonder if you have PTSD, too
2016-09-21 14:10:56	cirkit	hmm
2016-09-21 14:11:06	Max`P	cirkit: don't think so. I have burnout
2016-09-21 14:11:17	cirkit	ah
2016-09-21 14:11:37	Max`P	I feel a whole lot better these days actually, with the new job and the meds. Considering reducing the Effexor and Adderall
2016-09-21 14:12:16	cirkit	Max`P: yeah, that's really good. Effexor was recommended as a 3rd choice...ever taken Zoloft?
2016-09-21 14:12:57	Max`P	No, they gave me Effexor right away. Seems like they like Effexor here, but it also fitted my profile somewhat well since it deals with both depression and anxiety
2016-09-21 14:13:01	cirkit	"Individuals with PTSD often have fatigue from poor sleep patterns, trouble concentrating, and memory problems, all of which can interfere with the individual's ability to work and maintain a job."
2016-09-21 14:13:06	Max`P	apparently helps focusing a bit too
2016-09-21 14:14:10	halfwit	Max`P: Awesome man
2016-09-21 14:14:19	cirkit	yeah, glad it's working out 
2016-09-21 14:14:23	Max`P	Hmm yeah, that would make sense. I wish you the best to discover yourself cirkit!
2016-09-21 14:14:39	Max`P	It's quite interesting to dig deep into yourself and understand that kind of stuff
2016-09-21 14:14:44	cirkit	Thanks :)
2016-09-21 14:14:54	cirkit	Zoloft has side affects, too...hopefully not too major for me
2016-09-21 14:15:05	cirkit	apparently they go away after 1 or 2 weeks if you do have affects
2016-09-21 14:15:16	 *	cirkit tokes
2016-09-21 14:15:35	Max`P	pretty much unavoidable, the side effects
2016-09-21 14:16:08	halfwit	Are they depressive for a bit?
2016-09-21 14:17:47	cirkit	from what i remember my psychiatrist telling me it could cause things like: nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, loss of appetite, increased sweating, upset stomach
2016-09-21 14:17:55	halfwit	Oh, ok. 
2016-09-21 14:18:01	halfwit	Chantix was wildly depressive
2016-09-21 14:18:07	cirkit	but those seem pretty common with most prescription drugs
2016-09-21 14:19:34	halfwit	sBut also really weird dreams and shit, hallucinations, 
2016-09-21 14:19:41	halfwit	Thinking that everyone was out to get me... uh
2016-09-21 14:19:44	halfwit	What's that one called
2016-09-21 14:19:49	halfwit	That persisted a while after
2016-09-21 14:19:51	cirkit	ah
2016-09-21 14:20:10	cirkit	that sounds similar to what some people feel on speed
2016-09-21 14:20:27	cirkit	i know for sure things like meth make you feel like someone's around the corner trying to get you
2016-09-21 14:20:32	cirkit	paranoia on meth lel

2016-09-21 14:21:06	halfwit	I am so fucking glad that it was just the drugs that did it, fucking hell it'd be hard to live like that.

2016-09-21 16:31:00		[16:25]
2016-09-21 16:40:35	cirkit	hrm...apparently the black screen of doom problem seems to be due to using iCloud authentication...probably retarded shit is enabled in the newer macOS releases
2016-09-21 16:40:42	cirkit	can you even boot into safe mode?
2016-09-21 16:40:45	Max`P	nope

2016-09-22 11:54:07	alyptik	Max`P: how many servers is it? 2-3?
2016-09-22 11:55:44	Max`P	2
2016-09-22 11:56:22	alyptik	ah
2016-09-22 11:57:31	Max`P	that's because when the original voidnet imploded, I created a quick server on irc.max-p.me temporarly
2016-09-22 11:57:53	alyptik	how come it imploded?
2016-09-22 11:57:57	Max`P	Eventually it never went back on, so I created voidnet.max-p.me as the real server, but never unlinked the backup one
2016-09-22 11:58:22	Max`P	The admin disappeared and left the server unpaid, so the hosting company pulled the plug
2016-09-22 11:58:29	alyptik	ouch

2016-09-22 12:05:36	cirkit	the tech at Best Buy said it's one of the worse jobs/installation's he has seen LOL
2016-09-22 12:05:43	cirkit	i believe it

2016-09-22 12:06:22	cirkit	but the stock USB port is disabled for som reason, so gonna bring it back..dude at Worse Buy said he'd take a look to hook it back up
2016-09-22 12:06:25	alyptik	i used to work in a car upholstery shop, omg some cars that came in had aftermarket system that were so fucked
2016-09-22 12:07:09	cirkit	alyptik: it's amazing how those car audio "techs" get hired when they do TERRIBLE jobs that are quite apparent 
2016-09-22 12:07:22	cirkit	the guys at Best Buy are far more knowledgeable
2016-09-22 12:07:27	cirkit	at least here
2016-09-22 12:07:39	Max`P	The problem is that the entry level for this stuff is so low you can hire pretty much anyone to do it and they do it quite poorly
2016-09-22 12:08:00	Max`P	and Worst Buy isn't a car shop, so they likely only touch cars to do car audio
2016-09-22 12:08:01	alyptik	lol yeah
2016-09-22 12:08:54	cirkit	i need to reinstall the apps that come with my stock unit, but i can't do that since the USB is currently disabled LOL
2016-09-22 12:09:01	cirkit	i took it to Toyota and they were absolutely clueless

2016-09-22 14:32:12	Max`P	It's a router, they certainly can afford to run something decent

2016-09-22 17:08:12	voidead	I was considering getting a really expensive and fast road bike but then I realized that the roads would fuck the suspension up or something
2016-09-22 17:08:31	voidead	I'd have to ride it only in certain places
2016-09-22 17:08:34	voidead	and thats annoying
2016-09-22 17:08:47	voidead	so I guess I could put nice tires on the bike I already have
2016-09-22 17:08:54	voidead	its a pretty damn fast bike as is
2016-09-22 17:09:01	voidead	but it could be faster
2016-09-22 17:09:39	voidead	oh and I realized something.. I was looking at all these bikes parked near the subway entrance and every bike is almost exactly the same
2016-09-22 17:09:47	voidead	fucking rusty ass mountain bike
2016-09-22 17:10:08	voidead	and every fucking one of those bikes has the gears in the worst position possible lol
2016-09-22 17:11:05	voidead	like.. if you are on the 6th or 7th gear on the back tire.. then you should be on the 2nd or 3rd gear on the front gears on the pedals too.. otherwise you will put too much strain on the chain
2016-09-22 17:11:39	voidead	but they have their bike on the 1st small gear on the front and the 6th or 7th gear on the back
2016-09-22 17:11:41	voidead	which is dumb
2016-09-22 17:12:00	voidead	but what is strange is.. its literally every fucking bike I saw parked is like that lol

2016-09-24 00:54:51	skope	you still have to got some WHITE GUILT
2016-09-24 00:55:28	voidead	skope› I'm from the Confederate States.. where there is no guilt about being white
2016-09-24 00:55:28		[00:55]
2016-09-24 00:55:37	skope	and there should not be anywhere
2016-09-24 00:55:41	skope	the whole concept is fucking moronic
2016-09-24 00:55:51	voidead	agreed
2016-09-24 00:55:52	alyptik	lol
2016-09-24 00:56:06	voidead	skope› I'm so tired of hearing about these fucking Black Lives Matter faggots
2016-09-24 00:56:21	skope	indeed, they don't want rights to black people
2016-09-24 00:56:25	skope	they want to riot
2016-09-24 00:56:41	skope	they're like feminazis of the black world
2016-09-24 00:56:51	voidead	more like Nigger Lives Matter.. because black people are quite ashamed of their behavior 
2016-09-24 00:56:59	skope	yeah
2016-09-24 00:57:30	voidead	I'm not black but I'm pretty sure black people are just as tired of this stupid bullshit as everyone else is
2016-09-24 00:57:44	skope	i am sure too
2016-09-24 00:57:51	voidead	it brings unwanted attention to them
2016-09-24 00:57:55	voidead	makes them a target
2016-09-24 00:57:57	voidead	for no reason
2016-09-24 00:58:01	skope	blm does the opposite they're saying
2016-09-24 00:58:10	skope	they're showing that black people are fucking stupid

2016-09-24 00:58:14	voidead	when its the fucking niggers who need to be put in prisons where the rightfully belong
2016-09-24 00:58:18	skope	even though most of them isn't
2016-09-24 00:58:21	skope	aren't*
2016-09-24 00:59:42	voidead	I think "nigger" should be known as the universal word for "a fucking moronic asshole" because I don't think black people deserve to be called nigger thats completely wrong.. all races can be a nigger I think
2016-09-24 01:00:19	skope	damn straight
2016-09-24 01:01:37	voidead	and actually.. since we are on the subject.. I'm from Mississippi which is regarded as one of the most racist places in the US.. at least that is what the media wants you to think.. but the people from MS are the opposite because we grew up surrounded by black and white people mingling and getting along perfectly fine because our parents didn't want us to be racist
2016-09-24 01:02:01	voidead	in fact my family has more black friends than white 
2016-09-24 01:02:22	voidead	the reason is.. well.. I mean there is a high number of black people living in MS
2016-09-24 01:02:31	voidead	so of course we have black friends
2016-09-24 01:02:33	skope	yeh, i've been thinking about the same
2016-09-24 01:02:42	skope	there are lots of black people in most "racist" places
2016-09-24 01:04:00	voidead	it turns out though.. they are very kind and so hospitable to each other.. there is this guy named Wayne who lives near my grandparents.. his family has always dropped by to talk and ask us how we are doing.. he shows up at funerals and gives food.. he gave my mom like a whole plate dinner for her birthday
2016-09-24 01:04:13	voidead	I think its more about the type of people in that community than about race
2016-09-24 01:04:34	voidead	he was the only black person who showed up to my grandparent's funerals
2016-09-24 01:04:40	voidead	him and his wife
2016-09-24 01:04:45	+Anna	you have two separate insurance plans which both cover medical expenses unlimited and high on md pills? haha probably makes the most giving and kind of meth?
2016-09-24 01:05:28	voidead	I'd trust him around my mom to keep her safe than _any_ white guy in that town
2016-09-24 01:06:15	voidead	we were always taught to be nice to each other basically.. 
2016-09-24 01:06:38	voidead	and of course most people are christian so they all go to church together and shit
2016-09-24 01:06:43	voidead	which I didn't give a fuck about
2016-09-24 01:06:46	alyptik	same here
2016-09-24 01:06:50	alyptik	super religious
2016-09-24 01:06:53	voidead	but still.. its very good for the community
2016-09-24 01:07:13	skope	i've only been in church when there has been a funeral or a wedding
2016-09-24 01:07:17	skope	never been "for fun"
2016-09-24 01:07:22	voidead	yeah same here
2016-09-24 01:07:42	skope	i honestly don't get people who go to church every sunday
2016-09-24 01:07:44	skope	it's weird
2016-09-24 01:07:59	voidead	well actually I used to show up at friend's churches so that we can go to church trips and shit lol
2016-09-24 01:08:00	voidead	that was fun
2016-09-24 01:08:04	skope	haha nice
2016-09-24 01:08:40	voidead	we never did anything church related.. just fucking hop on the church bus and take off to several states with friends.. for like 1/8th of the cost lol
2016-09-24 01:09:03	voidead	we went to New Mexico and had a fucking blast
2016-09-24 01:09:06	voidead	shit was fun
2016-09-24 01:09:15	voidead	just paid them like $100 for the whole trip lol
2016-09-24 01:09:18	voidead	everything included
2016-09-24 01:09:47	voidead	the whole trip would end up costing one person at least 6 or 700 dollars
2016-09-24 01:10:05	voidead	food and hotels and shit
2016-09-24 01:10:07	voidead	gets expensive
2016-09-24 01:10:20	voidead	going with a church saves so much money
2016-09-24 01:10:35	voidead	also I found out "christians" are more wild than non-christians

2016-09-24 01:13:45	voidead	oh that reminds me.. that guy Wayne talked to my mom the other day about those riots and BLM bullshit you know what he said? "well, that stuff is crazy.. why would they do that shit? why can't they just talk about that shit? you don't see me beatin' people's asses because of the police"
2016-09-24 01:14:14	voidead	alyptik› yeah all that pinned up sexual rage
2016-09-24 01:14:25	voidead	alyptik› Jesus doesn't want me to fuck.. BUT I HAVE TO
2016-09-24 01:15:42	alyptik	voidead: lmao that is basically it
2016-09-24 01:16:39	alyptik	not hyperbole either, that is exactly christian/mormon girls here heh

2016-09-24 05:09:32	sampson	pacman says i have qutebrowser-git r9004-705a4f-1 installed, the aur package has version r8448.5c1401b-1, and cower doesnt notice an update for it.. so im wondering how i installed this..because if i had used makepkg and pacman then id have that older version, but if i had used a git clone, which i usually dont do, then pacman would pacman still see it installed? i wouldnt have used pacman if
2016-09-24 05:09:34	sampson	i built it from the git package
2016-09-24 05:09:50	sampson	or did i smoke too much weed
2016-09-24 05:10:51	voidead	sampson› well you should pacman -Qs qutebrowser-git
2016-09-24 05:10:55	voidead	find out the version installed
2016-09-24 05:11:21	voidead	also you should remove old build/package/source files that were installed via cower
2016-09-24 05:11:57	voidead	when you makepkg qutebrowser-git it gets it straight from github
2016-09-24 05:12:59	sampson	l@me ~ % cower -s qutebrowser                                                                                                                             :(
2016-09-24 05:13:01	sampson	aur/qutebrowser-git r8448.5c1401b-1 (40, 2.76) [installed: r9004.7605a4f-1]
2016-09-24 05:13:03	voidead	sampson› the AUR package will probably not change the version
2016-09-24 05:13:25	voidead	but actually when you makepkg.. it will get it straight from github regardless
2016-09-24 05:13:32	sampson	thats stupid
2016-09-24 05:13:39	voidead	so the version in the PKGBUILD won't change unless you change it yourself
2016-09-24 05:13:55	voidead	sampson› lazy package maintainers
2016-09-24 05:14:18	voidead	they just think "ah well it updates straight from github.. so why should I change the version every 5 seconds?"
2016-09-24 05:14:28	sampson	i cant do cower -u with shit like that
2016-09-24 05:14:38	voidead	you have to manually keep track
2016-09-24 05:14:40	voidead	yeah
2016-09-24 05:14:44	sampson	THATS HORSE SHIT
2016-09-24 05:14:50	voidead	just check github for any changes I guess
2016-09-24 05:14:59	voidead	or pacman -S qutebrowser

2016-09-24 08:47:00	voidead	holy shit
2016-09-24 08:47:02	prg	yup
2016-09-24 08:47:06	voidead	"you may not reregister"
2016-09-24 08:47:08	voidead	god damn
2016-09-24 08:47:15	voidead	someone has really fucked Freenode badly this time
2016-09-24 08:47:25	skope	i got in normally
2016-09-24 08:47:31	cirkit	opal is fucking hacking!!
2016-09-24 08:48:35	voidead	lol just joined again
2016-09-24 08:48:54	voidead	lol what an insane netsplit
2016-09-24 08:49:06	cirkit	i was able to identify on freenode
2016-09-24 08:49:26	skope	same
2016-09-24 08:49:34	cirkit	big DDoS this time
2016-09-24 08:52:35	Max`P	Working fine for me
2016-09-24 08:52:59	voidead	according to a few people there are like two servers that have been completely disconnected
2016-09-24 08:53:12	voidead	but whatever
2016-09-24 08:53:31	skope	dayum
2016-09-24 08:54:46	voidead	I'd like a status report at some point
2016-09-24 08:54:58	voidead	I know they are probably working hard on dealing with the issue... or not
2016-09-24 08:55:13	voidead	or maybe they are just smoking weed and not giving a fuck like most system admins lol
2016-09-24 08:59:17	cirkit	i wonder if any of those freenode staff smoke weed
2016-09-24 08:59:17		[08:59]
2016-09-24 08:59:19	cirkit	lol
2016-09-24 08:59:29	voidead	everyone smokes weed
2016-09-24 08:59:39	voidead	well I don't.. but I'd consume weed
2016-09-24 08:59:46	cirkit	yeah, weed is no biggie
2016-09-24 08:59:47	voidead	weed is pretty cool
2016-09-24 08:59:48	cirkit	so common now
2016-09-24 09:00:05	voidead	I hate smoking though.. so I don't want to smoke weed at all
2016-09-24 09:00:06	cirkit	lots of hot asian chicks smoke weed
2016-09-24 09:00:08	cirkit	or vape it
2016-09-24 09:00:09	voidead	but I'll consume it
2016-09-24 09:00:32	cirkit	yeah, consuming weed edibles would probably be better or vaping it for those that don't like smoking anything
2016-09-24 09:00:37	cirkit	i like edibles
2016-09-24 09:01:01	skope	another disconnect
2016-09-24 09:01:06	cirkit	damn lol
2016-09-24 09:01:29	cirkit	niggas probably got a huge botnet or something
2016-09-24 09:01:56	voidead	wow
2016-09-24 09:02:00	voidead	yeah
2016-09-24 09:02:09	cirkit	i wonder why it's always seemed to be a challenge for freenode to mitigate attacks
2016-09-24 09:02:15	voidead	because
2016-09-24 09:02:23	cirkit	i would like to see a status report too
2016-09-24 09:02:24	voidead	its one of the largest networks
2016-09-24 09:02:33	voidead	its ran by volunteers
2016-09-24 09:02:48	voidead	also
2016-09-24 09:03:02	voidead	its super hard to mitigate attacks and keep your clients happy
2016-09-24 09:03:11	voidead	you have to be super restrictive
2016-09-24 09:03:54	voidead	they recently allowed TOR access
2016-09-24 09:03:59	voidead	maybe that is why they are getting fucked
2016-09-24 09:04:13	voidead	but anyways
2016-09-24 09:04:33	voidead	Freenode is fucked for the foreseeable future until they get this shit taken care of 
2016-09-24 09:05:11	cirkit	ahh didn't know about TOR
2016-09-24 09:05:21	cirkit	that's ironic considering freenode had TOR connections banned for a long time
2016-09-24 09:05:24	voidead	or they might just be having technical issues.. not related to a DDoS or some attack
2016-09-24 09:05:50	voidead	cirkit› yeah they brought it back because they added some security feature or something
2016-09-24 09:06:12	cirkit	ah
2016-09-24 09:06:26	cirkit	well shit, i think i have identified the "problem" i was having with ansible
2016-09-24 09:06:36	cirkit	fucking forgot Arch uses python3 by default
2016-09-24 09:06:40	cirkit	ansible is fucking python2
2016-09-24 09:06:52	cirkit	why python3 can't be fucking backwards compatible is beyond me
2016-09-24 09:07:28	cirkit	well, guess i'll change point ansible to python2 and hope it works
2016-09-24 09:07:32	voidead	man my twitter client written in python is broken.. it is written with python2 but the issue is more complicated than just python2/3
2016-09-24 09:07:36	cirkit	ill point ** ffs
2016-09-24 09:07:51	cirkit	shit, voidead ..yeah pia with shit like that
2016-09-24 09:08:02	voidead	I know how to troubleshoot it but honestly I don't give a fuck lol
2016-09-24 09:08:02	+Anna	r/legaladvice is a piece of meat
2016-09-24 09:08:10	skope	:D
2016-09-24 09:08:29	voidead	I'll rewrite a new twitter client 
2016-09-24 09:08:37	voidead	I don't feel like fucking with it though
2016-09-24 09:09:42	cirkit	nope, still fails with python2
2016-09-24 09:09:50	 *	cirkit puts bullet through his head
2016-09-24 09:10:17	cirkit	at least it isn't complaining about not establishing a connection on the non-default SSH port
2016-09-24 09:10:19	voidead	that is one thing I'm glad I don't have to deal with.. like having to deal with issues like this for money.. like some changes upstream basically leave you with no way of fixing some issues or bugs.. some applications are completely broken because of some upstream changes etc..
2016-09-24 09:10:22	cirkit	just bitching about a fucking module
2016-09-24 09:10:39	voidead	I'd lose my mind if I had to deal with that shit everyday
2016-09-24 09:10:50	cirkit	voidead: yeah, big pia
2016-09-24 09:10:52	Max`P	cirkit: because if you want python2, you can use python2 so fuck backwards compat
2016-09-24 09:11:00	cirkit	definitely need to test new shit in testing before rolling it out

2016-09-24 09:16:48	Max`P	if you need to force python2 on a program that calls /usr/bin/python, you can always make a folder with just a python->python2 symlink and add it to your $PATH
2016-09-24 09:16:48		[09:16]
2016-09-24 09:16:58	Max`P	Or use virtualenv
2016-09-24 09:20:55	voidead	ah
2016-09-24 09:21:20	voidead	from Freenode's twitter page they said it is a DDoS

2016-09-24 09:33:55	cirkit	looks like ansible does work with /usr/bin/python defaulting to version 3
2016-09-24 09:34:16	cirkit	ffs....need to figure out why it's crapping on remote sessions
2016-09-24 09:34:20	cirkit	crapping out *

2016-09-24 20:20:33	voidead	something I've noticed recently that really pisses me off when skating is when I try to do heelflip variations and the board keeps hitting a part on my shoe which causes some serious bruising and it hurts like a MFer
2016-09-24 20:20:39	voidead	I need to put some padding there

2016-09-26 10:14:19	voidead	I just told them not to install Debian
2016-09-26 10:14:42	voidead	also.. things "not working" is not a valid excuse to abandon some distro
2016-09-26 10:14:55	voidead	also.. if you want a server
2016-09-26 10:15:02	voidead	you don't need to specify some distro
2016-09-26 10:15:08	voidead	_anything_ can be a server
2016-09-26 10:15:43	voidead	I've been running Arch Linux as a server for years
2016-09-26 10:16:18	voidead	I don't know why people can't get that in their thick heads
2016-09-26 10:16:40	voidead	just because some distro doesn't update very often doesn't inherently mean they are a "server distro"
2016-09-26 10:17:42	voidead	lol I said "hell even fucking TempleOS can be a server"

2016-09-27 02:59:37	SeferYetzirah	and some clips
2016-09-27 03:02:03	voidead	I mean I don't like either one of them
2016-09-27 03:02:12	voidead	but Hillary was certainly accurate
2016-09-27 03:02:20	voidead	but that was all she was
2016-09-27 03:02:54	voidead	but its obvious.. Trump is a fucking idiot
2016-09-27 03:05:09	skope	still people vote for him
2016-09-27 03:05:12	skope	the fuck is wrong with people
2016-09-27 03:05:20	skope	that kind of stupidity should be banned
2016-09-27 03:05:48	voidead	skope› well he represent's their interests.. they don't like him personally but you know.. he is republican and they are republican so.. they vote for a republican
2016-09-27 03:05:50	voidead	like sheep
2016-09-27 03:06:02	skope	he has said shit which would concern anyone with a brain
2016-09-27 03:06:16	skope	that two party system is so fucked
2016-09-27 03:06:41	voidead	skope› I don't see Trump being president.. but holy fuck if he becomes president I fucking swear.. I'm not coming near the US for at least another 4 years
2016-09-27 03:07:05	voidead	I don't give a fuck what is going on
2016-09-27 03:07:13	voidead	I'll fucking live homeless
2016-09-27 03:07:24	voidead	but fuck that ignorant asshole
2016-09-27 03:07:41	voidead	Hillary isn't really good either
2016-09-27 03:07:42	skope	is it true that if you vote for 3rd party, you basically lose your vote?
2016-09-27 03:07:47	voidead	I'm quite annoyed with both of them
2016-09-27 03:07:56	voidead	skope› well not necessarily
2016-09-27 03:08:40	voidead	skope› unfortunately.. when you have such a strong binary system.. it takes years for people to switch their views enough so that a third part could even be valid
2016-09-27 03:08:50	voidead	party*
2016-09-27 03:08:52	skope	dayum
2016-09-27 03:08:55	voidead	skope› however
2016-09-27 03:09:10	voidead	skope› that doesn't rule out the possibility of a third party being valid
2016-09-27 03:09:27	voidead	I think people are quite annoyed with the binary system
2016-09-27 03:09:34	skope	they should be
2016-09-27 03:10:31	voidead	most Americans grew with the thought that there was only two.. so its not like they are ignorant to a third party.. its just they don't see voting for a third party effective ultimately
2016-09-27 03:10:38	voidead	grew up
2016-09-27 03:11:52	voidead	well you know.. if whoever you like has no possibility of being presdident (Bernie Sanders) for example.. you just vote for the next best person that represents your interest
2016-09-27 03:12:02	voidead	president*
2016-09-27 03:12:02		[03:12]
2016-09-27 03:12:25	voidead	many Americans are actually voting for a third party
2016-09-27 03:12:30	voidead	but it has fell on deaf ears
2016-09-27 03:12:50	voidead	and the sad part of that is.. it was all rigged from the beginning anyways
2016-09-27 03:12:59	voidead	doesn't matter if you vote for Jesus.. he won't win
2016-09-27 03:13:18	voidead	thats how politics works anyways
2016-09-27 03:13:33	voidead	its all about the benefit of whoever has the money
2016-09-27 03:13:52	voidead	I know a lot of people say "ah well not my country!!"
2016-09-27 03:13:55	voidead	yeah right.. thats bullshit
2016-09-27 03:14:59	voidead	South Korea would be considered a liberal utopia by many standards.. but when you actually read between the lines South Korea is no different from any other fairly major world power
2016-09-27 03:15:09	skope	it's fucking shit that you have to "vote for the next best person"
2016-09-27 03:15:18	skope	that's the reason i don't vote, every candidate is so shitty
2016-09-27 03:15:29	skope	and they have no obligation of keeping their promises
2016-09-27 03:15:35	voidead	right
2016-09-27 03:15:42	voidead	politics is a complete scam
2016-09-27 03:15:48	voidead	a puppet show
2016-09-27 03:16:20	skope	yeah
2016-09-27 03:17:22	voidead	the whole reason all of this exists is simply to control billions of people.. so that there isn't ridiculous chaos everywhere
2016-09-27 03:17:39	voidead	you control the masses with religion, hate, racism and politics
2016-09-27 03:17:45	voidead	and military control
2016-09-27 03:17:50	skope	and drugs
2016-09-27 03:17:59	voidead	ah yeah.. drugs are quite effective at least
2016-09-27 03:18:01	skope	keep them medicated, they don't oppose
2016-09-27 03:18:07	voidead	and not just illegal drugs..
2016-09-27 03:18:09	voidead	yeah
2016-09-27 03:18:17	voidead	hell fucking beer and cigs.. holy shit
2016-09-27 03:18:20	voidead	thats all legal
2016-09-27 03:18:49	voidead	but anyways.. it has and always will be rigged for control
2016-09-27 03:18:58	voidead	there isn't anyway out of it
2016-09-27 03:18:58	skope	sure
2016-09-27 03:19:03	skope	i have accepted it
2016-09-27 03:19:05	skope	it doesn't bother me
2016-09-27 03:19:18	skope	it's still fucked up, but let it be
2016-09-27 03:19:20	voidead	you just have to exist in the system as happily as possible.. you can't escape it.. you can do nothing about it of course
2016-09-27 03:19:44	skope	lol just got to know that my friend plays drums in archgoat
2016-09-27 03:20:19	voidead	which is odd to me.. people who know the facts.. yet they complain.. "you do nothing! you should vote! you are just letting shit happen!!" which is complete bullshit anyone with a fucking brain in their skull knows its rigged 
2016-09-27 03:20:51	skope	those people don't know shit
2016-09-27 03:20:56	skope	or don't want to admit the shittiness of the system
2016-09-27 03:21:28	voidead	"your country is destroying other countries and murdering innocents!! and you just let it happen! you voted for them!" thats complete bullshit.. I have no control over any of that shit
2016-09-27 03:22:06	voidead	if the US military wants to murder millions.. well god dammit they will do it at the behest of everyone opposing them
2016-09-27 03:22:12	skope	exactly
2016-09-27 03:22:41	voidead	hell the military _is_ the president.. has been all along since its inception
2016-09-27 03:22:58	voidead	thats where all of our god damn money goes to anyways
2016-09-27 03:23:34	skope	us army budget is fucking ridiculous :D
2016-09-27 03:23:34	voidead	in fact most of Trump supporters are probably involved with the military in some way
2016-09-27 03:25:33	voidead	with any superpower on earth.. the answer lies in the military it has.. _nothing_ else matters.. we live, eat, breath and die for the military machine.. that is all of humanity's existence whether anyone wants to face that reality or not.. there will come a time when World War 3 breaks out.. who is to blame? every god damn military on earth that is who is to blame as they are the _real_
2016-09-27 03:25:35	voidead	presidents of these superpowers
2016-09-27 03:26:09	skope	well said
2016-09-27 03:26:28	skope	but armies are still necessary
2016-09-27 03:26:29	voidead	just so happens the US has the most money.. and we gained it from... no doubt.. fucking World War 2
2016-09-27 03:26:45	skope	there are always people who are fucked up in the head
2016-09-27 03:27:22	voidead	there is nothing wrong with having a military.. except for the fact humans are inherently fucking greedy ignorant faggots who can't leave well enough alone
2016-09-27 03:27:22		[03:27]
2016-09-27 03:27:58	skope	yeah
2016-09-27 03:28:04	skope	it's always too much
2016-09-27 03:28:28	voidead	hell if fucking Japan had their way our world would be literal hell on earth.. probably a mirrored version of North Korea
2016-09-27 03:28:35	voidead	thats why they don't have a strong military
2016-09-27 03:28:38	voidead	we disarmed them
2016-09-27 03:28:46	voidead	fucking savages
2016-09-27 03:28:48	voidead	god damn
2016-09-27 03:29:19	voidead	some people are inherently more savage than others.. thats the truth
2016-09-27 03:29:48	skope	yeah
2016-09-27 03:30:01	skope	and it's utopistic to think that people will be good to each other some day
2016-09-27 03:30:03	skope	they won't
2016-09-27 03:30:09	voidead	if you live on an island with a high frequency of natural disasters.. on top of poverty and not that many natural resources but very high population.. well of course you'll be as savage as Japan
2016-09-27 03:30:48	skope	yah, high population introduces things such as that individuals life is not that worthy because you got too much people
2016-09-27 03:31:10	voidead	Japan has a very fucked up culture/society
2016-09-27 03:31:17	voidead	for many many reasons
2016-09-27 03:31:37	voidead	Korea has always been more stable than Japan in that regard.. yet Japan is like 10 times more aggressive
2016-09-27 03:31:48	skope	except for the north :D
2016-09-27 03:32:01	skope	well i guess they are stable too, but their leaders and military isn't
2016-09-27 03:32:26	voidead	yeah that was all decided between Russia and the US.. the North exists simply to pander to the remnants of the cold war and who as shadow control over what
2016-09-27 03:32:41	voidead	has*
2016-09-27 03:33:23	skope	yeah
2016-09-27 03:33:59	voidead	its mind boggling to me how fucking stupid these assholes are who support communism or whatever ridiculous regime from the past as if that "alternative" political view/society is somehow even relevant to life today
2016-09-27 03:34:13	skope	i get the support on communism
2016-09-27 03:34:21	skope	it's very good in theory
2016-09-27 03:34:24	voidead	communism _could_ work 
2016-09-27 03:34:26	voidead	but it didn't
2016-09-27 03:34:27	skope	but in practise, it's horrible
2016-09-27 03:34:32	voidead	hence why its not relevant
2016-09-27 03:34:36	skope	yeah, since some people don't settle
2016-09-27 03:34:39	+Anna	cirkit: Everyone dies!
2016-09-27 03:34:45	voidead	Anna› correct
2016-09-27 03:35:01	voidead	Russia alone suffered massive casualties from WW2
2016-09-27 03:35:26	voidead	hell look at China.. they have a very strange version of communism
2016-09-27 03:35:33	voidead	a very unsustainable version
2016-09-27 03:36:03	skope	still they pull it off pretty well
2016-09-27 03:36:06	voidead	China is a perfect example of a superpower that will faily very quickly
2016-09-27 03:36:07	skope	it's not pure communism though
2016-09-27 03:36:14	skope	woot, why would they fail
2016-09-27 03:36:28	voidead	they can't do what they are doing sustainably
2016-09-27 03:36:35	voidead	its not practical
2016-09-27 03:36:39	skope	they've been like that for thousands of years, only thing has changed is that they don't have dynasties anymore
2016-09-27 03:36:42	skope	howso?
2016-09-27 03:37:04	skope	mao fucked shit up pretty badly, and they're somehow still recovering from that
2016-09-27 03:37:13	voidead	skope› technology, climate change, resource depletion, famine that results from said resource depletion.. the list goes on
2016-09-27 03:38:32	skope	climate change is a thing absolutely, but how do they deplete their resources?
2016-09-27 03:38:50	skope	and their technology is pretty advanced compared to western societies
2016-09-27 03:39:06	skope	source: woman is doing her studies party about china
2016-09-27 03:42:55	voidead	skope› well
2016-09-27 03:42:55		[03:42]
2016-09-27 03:43:02	voidead	skope› its quite simple
2016-09-27 03:43:14	voidead	think of how the US had the "dust bowl" back in the day
2016-09-27 03:43:20	skope	yeah
2016-09-27 03:43:29	voidead	unsustainable farming practices
2016-09-27 03:43:34	voidead	too many people
2016-09-27 03:43:43	voidead	there is no way China can stay sustainable
2016-09-27 03:43:54	skope	nope, not with what they're doing now
2016-09-27 03:43:57	voidead	they have too many people to support and not enough resources to do it
2016-09-27 03:44:07	skope	but i think they're going to change stuff when it isn't effective anymore
2016-09-27 03:44:33	voidead	skope› if they go back to being modest peasants then they can do what they have always done for centuries.. but they want to be a superpower and.. nah its not going to happen
2016-09-27 03:44:55	skope	hmm superpower like how?
2016-09-27 03:44:56	voidead	sure they can try
2016-09-27 03:45:00	skope	they're not interested in expanding
2016-09-27 03:45:50	voidead	skope› its pretty obvious they want a very strong military.. they are starting to become imperialistic in nature.. and its only a matter of time before they are imperialistic.. its like the US back in the 1920s all over again
2016-09-27 03:46:49	voidead	skope› from what they are doing over here on this side of the Pacific.. its very obvious they want control and power
2016-09-27 03:46:58	skope	i think they want it because usa and russia have a lot of soldiers just behind their borders
2016-09-27 03:47:01	voidead	South Korea and Japan are being pressured pretty heavily on this
2016-09-27 03:47:31	skope	well they have fuckton of grudges towards japan because of what they did to mantsurians
2016-09-27 03:47:40	skope	basically invaded and killed a lot of people
2016-09-27 03:48:27	voidead	well sure.. but I'm just warning you.. China isn't just going to sit around and be some passive aggressive country
2016-09-27 03:48:54	skope	yeah, it's interesting to see
2016-09-27 03:48:58	skope	what happens in like 30 years
2016-09-27 03:49:02	voidead	they want power just like the US did back in the 20s
2016-09-27 03:49:02	skope	shit might be pretty damn different
2016-09-27 03:49:13	+Anna	welp, time to get it working with meskarune and she is sensitive to any substances, the one whos scumbag friends beat each other for meth and it's getting closer to summer here in South Korea one day i'll get 1 tat
2016-09-27 03:49:20	skope	:DDDDDDDD
2016-09-27 03:49:22	skope	WAT
2016-09-27 03:50:51	voidead	in fact.. back even before Hitler was defeated the US was already taking complete control of the Americas one country at a time.. they created the Panama Canal and completely dominated trade and once WW2 broke out.. it was like the perfect opportunity for the US to gain massive power and advantage.. not only against Japan and Hitler but also against its own allies
2016-09-27 03:51:11	voidead	all of this
2016-09-27 03:51:13	voidead	while
2016-09-27 03:51:22	voidead	the US was dealing with horrible financial depression
2016-09-27 03:51:25	voidead	and the dust bowl
2016-09-27 03:51:27	voidead	famine
2016-09-27 03:51:29	voidead	all sorts of shit
2016-09-27 03:51:40	voidead	and they bounced back and became the most powerful country in the world 
2016-09-27 03:51:48	skope	was the famine result of the war?
2016-09-27 03:51:52	voidead	skope› actually
2016-09-27 03:52:06	voidead	it was the result of bad farming practices.. which had nothing to do with the war at all
2016-09-27 03:52:12	voidead	BUT
2016-09-27 03:52:19	voidead	it nearly crippled the US
2016-09-27 03:52:40	voidead	it turned croplands into deserts
2016-09-27 03:52:48	voidead	noone could feed their family
2016-09-27 03:53:03	voidead	took a while to bounce back from that bullshit
2016-09-27 03:53:04	skope	was this countrywide, or just in south?
2016-09-27 03:53:33	skope	nice information btw, haven't been reading about usa during early 1900s
2016-09-27 03:53:55	voidead	but I see China doing that in the future.. and failing to bounce back.. we only had like maybe 70 million or 100 millino people living in the US at the time.. the whole country.. but imagine like 3 billion people dealing with massive famine
2016-09-27 03:54:04	voidead	skope› the _whole_ country dealt with this
2016-09-27 03:54:19	skope	that is true, but they have a lot more acres to farm though
2016-09-27 03:54:21	voidead	it was focused on the areas where the most food was being produced
2016-09-27 03:54:25	skope	okay
2016-09-27 03:54:29	voidead	skope› actually no they don't
2016-09-27 03:54:32	+Anna	🍁  keepp talking bad about me  🍂
2016-09-27 03:54:37	voidead	they have much less than the US does
2016-09-27 03:54:43	voidead	stfu Anna 
2016-09-27 03:55:49	voidead	the US had the benefit of first of all.. not having that many people.. secondly.. also having plenty of natural resources that can regenerate fairly easily.. and finally the money that came rushing in after WW2
2016-09-27 03:56:00	+Anna	i developed the majority of Apple's developers are Indian who write a compatibility later for something quick. Most productive work hour of the kids
2016-09-27 03:56:07	voidead	GOD DAMMIT Anna 
2016-09-27 03:56:12	voidead	let me get a fucking word in 
2016-09-27 03:56:15	voidead	fucking cunt
2016-09-27 03:57:09	skope	:D
2016-09-27 03:57:25	skope	Of this approximately 1.4 million square kilometers of arable land, only about 1.2% (116,580 square kilometers) permanently supports crops and 525,800 square kilometers are irrigated.
2016-09-27 03:57:31	skope	damn that's low
2016-09-27 03:57:47	skope	while us has 3,730,000 km2
2016-09-27 03:58:17	voidead	South Korea had serious issues historically with crops because they live in a very mountainous region
2016-09-27 03:58:17		[03:58]
2016-09-27 03:58:27	voidead	you can't grow crops effectively in the mountains
2016-09-27 03:58:32	skope	would think that fishing is more popular?
2016-09-27 03:58:34	voidead	not crops you need
2016-09-27 03:59:33	voidead	skope› its hard to say really how they drove their economy effectively for so long.. but essentially they relied on rice and grain to feed their families and in some areas of South Korea they relied very heavily on seafood
2016-09-27 03:59:46	voidead	but 
2016-09-27 03:59:52	voidead	they always lived in near poverty
2016-09-27 04:00:02	voidead	had a hard time with the land
2016-09-27 04:00:10	skope	yeah
2016-09-27 04:00:16	voidead	very little natural resources
2016-09-27 04:00:22	voidead	which reminds
2016-09-27 04:00:24	voidead	me
2016-09-27 04:00:24	skope	china has longest roots of us all
2016-09-27 04:00:31	skope	somehow documented history
2016-09-27 04:01:28	voidead	the reason why Koreans talk about eating dog is.. well they can't raise cattle like the US can as there really isn't enough land to take care of that many livestock.. so instead they would raise "livestock dogs" to eat when the food becomes really scarce
2016-09-27 04:01:49	skope	i don't see why it's so weird that people eat dogs
2016-09-27 04:01:51	skope	and cats
2016-09-27 04:01:52	voidead	these aren't your ordinary dogs of course
2016-09-27 04:01:56	voidead	but yeah
2016-09-27 04:02:18	skope	i bet indians are disgusted that we eat beef
2016-09-27 04:02:23	voidead	it shouldn't be tabboo.. but they ate dog usually when it was needed
2016-09-27 04:02:26	skope	it's just a matter of different cunture
2016-09-27 04:02:29	skope	yeah
2016-09-27 04:02:32	skope	cunture
2016-09-27 04:02:32	skope	:DD:D
2016-09-27 04:02:34	skope	culture
2016-09-27 04:02:34	voidead	lol
2016-09-27 04:02:47	voidead	my Korean friend mentioned that
2016-09-27 04:03:32	voidead	in Korean language when you meet people for the first time or you meet friends you would say "did you eat yet?" just as a friendly hello.. this gives you perspective on just how harsh it was 
2016-09-27 04:03:45	skope	dayum
2016-09-27 04:03:49	voidead	people would have to give each other food just to survive
2016-09-27 04:04:01	skope	well that happened basically everywhere
2016-09-27 04:04:05	skope	in north at least
2016-09-27 04:04:05	voidead	so neighbors would ask "did you eat yet?" and give them rice if they are starving etc..
2016-09-27 04:04:42	voidead	thats why Koreans are so friendly and sharing to each other
2016-09-27 04:04:52	voidead	they all were raised in this type of culture
2016-09-27 04:05:03	voidead	the elderly know exactly what it was like 
2016-09-27 04:05:10	voidead	so they passed down this culture
2016-09-27 04:05:29	skope	yeah, same in the north after ww2
2016-09-27 04:05:36	voidead	even before the Korean war.. Koreans have always had it kind of rough
2016-09-27 04:05:41	skope	people didn't have much to eat
2016-09-27 04:05:48	skope	so they started being creative
2016-09-27 04:05:53	+Anna	wow
2016-09-27 04:05:58	skope	and it's still passed to the next generation
2016-09-27 04:06:06	voidead	I will say though.. Koreans are _extremely_ creative and inventive
2016-09-27 04:06:09	skope	dying thing now though since soon we don't know anyone who was in the war
2016-09-27 04:06:19	skope	they are and their technological abilities are damn good
2016-09-27 04:07:02	voidead	just the small things you don't realize get to you.. like just walking down the street you will see shit and you think to yourself "god damn these Koreans are fucking bad ass"
2016-09-27 04:07:25	skope	haha nice
2016-09-27 04:07:49	voidead	living in this country is like.. installing Arch Linux and living in it lol
2016-09-27 04:07:53	voidead	everything is so efficient
2016-09-27 04:07:56	voidead	and minimalistic
2016-09-27 04:08:07	+Anna	decrepit› what up
2016-09-27 04:09:32	 *	prg yawns
2016-09-27 04:09:39	prg	o/
2016-09-27 04:10:33	voidead	I love how open minded people are here... I have been wearing this pink sports shirt around a lot lately when riding my bike or whatever.. I never have people walk up to me like "hey why are you wearing pink you fucking fag"
2016-09-27 04:10:59	voidead	in the US I'm sure someone would say something stupid
2016-09-27 04:11:18	prg	i had some pink shirts that i would rock in high school that would get reactions
2016-09-27 04:11:34	prg	my thing was that if you are too scared to wear a pink shirt you're a pussy
2016-09-27 04:11:38	voidead	if you see two women holding hands.. you would automatically say "ah they are lesbian" in the US.. but in Korea its like "they are friends or sisters *shrugs*"
2016-09-27 04:11:50	skope	how about two men
2016-09-27 04:11:54	prg	lol
2016-09-27 04:12:50	voidead	skope› actually men here grab each other and "play fight" and do shit that would be quite gay in the US I guess.. but here its just normal shit.. certainly not considered gay at all.. even if you hold hands noone gives a fuck here
2016-09-27 04:13:25	skope	nice
2016-09-27 04:13:25		[04:13]
2016-09-27 04:13:27	skope	that's good
2016-09-27 04:13:38	voidead	I mean.. if you pull your cock out and get some dude to grab it.. I'm pretty sure they would say "THATS GAY!! I'M CALLING THE POLICE!"
2016-09-27 04:13:47	skope	:D
2016-09-27 04:13:49	prg	yeah that's good shit; idk why everyone feels the need to be in everyone else's business here
2016-09-27 04:13:56	voidead	that reminds me
2016-09-27 04:13:59	voidead	one of my students
2016-09-27 04:14:00	skope	i fucking hate SJWs
2016-09-27 04:14:06	prg	skope: same
2016-09-27 04:14:09	voidead	this is how innocent these kids are.. I love it
2016-09-27 04:14:12	voidead	story:
2016-09-27 04:14:41	voidead	so I just started class and I'm wearing the bright pink sports shirt as I've been doing all week since I ride around on the bike a lot after work
2016-09-27 04:14:43	voidead	well
2016-09-27 04:15:53	voidead	I said to one of the girls in the class "hey you have a grapefruit colored cardigan.. its similar in color to my shirt.. neat" and she was like.. aw yeah.. very cool..  LOL and one of the boys says _very_ sincerely "teacher, are you gay?"
2016-09-27 04:16:02	voidead	like in a very serious respectful way lol
2016-09-27 04:16:09	voidead	but.. 
2016-09-27 04:16:16	voidead	here is the thing about this
2016-09-27 04:16:23	voidead	these kids have no clue what gay actually means
2016-09-27 04:16:37	voidead	they have just heard it from somewhere.. and they associate pink with "gay"
2016-09-27 04:16:54	voidead	so they are simply asking.. are you gay.. you wear a pink shirt
2016-09-27 04:17:10	voidead	but its awesome how innocent they are to all of that
2016-09-27 04:17:27	voidead	noone has told them anything about sexuality or even sex for that matter
2016-09-27 04:17:50	voidead	I'm sure the kids learn on their own.. but at age 11 or 12 they are completely innocent
2016-09-27 04:18:31	skope	there isn't sex ed in schools?
2016-09-27 04:18:48	voidead	no nothing like that
2016-09-27 04:18:50	voidead	however
2016-09-27 04:19:18	voidead	they do have something like sex ed but I mean
2016-09-27 04:19:30	voidead	its just not something people discuss normally
2016-09-27 04:19:42	voidead	most kids just discover it on their own
2016-09-27 04:19:58	skope	it's pretty fucked up not to teach people about their sexuality
2016-09-27 04:20:06	skope	things get repressed and shit happens
2016-09-27 04:20:08	voidead	the girls.. they may not discover it until well into college..
2016-09-27 04:20:09	skope	very bad shit
2016-09-27 04:20:33	voidead	skope› well here in South Korea.. its not as bad as you would expect
2016-09-27 04:20:45	skope	no youngster suicides?
2016-09-27 04:20:51	voidead	the culture and everything about the people here.. its fascinating
2016-09-27 04:21:39	voidead	skope› suicide is a problem everywhere.. but kids here learn about sex in their own way without sex ed people corrupting their minds
2016-09-27 04:22:14	voidead	its not like they don't know about sex
2016-09-27 04:22:21	voidead	they just prefer to not talk about it
2016-09-27 04:22:42	skope	is us sex ed corrupting peoples minds?
2016-09-27 04:22:51	skope	i remember having pretty educational shit in school about sex
2016-09-27 04:23:46	voidead	my honest opinion on the matter is.. I think kids should learn on their own what sex is.. and if they ask their parents questions about sex then answer in a very open minded way.. they shouldn't teach kids to be a certain way
2016-09-27 04:24:39	voidead	I mean I had sex ed.. but it was completely worthless for me
2016-09-27 04:24:53	voidead	I already knew what I needed to know without them 
2016-09-27 04:27:43	skope	nowadays porn is so damn easily available that if you base your sex knowledge on that, you're going to have a bad time
2016-09-27 04:28:42	voidead	well
2016-09-27 04:28:42		[04:28]
2016-09-27 04:28:49	voidead	from what I know
2016-09-27 04:29:01	voidead	young Korean teens have pretty normal sex lives
2016-09-27 04:29:13	voidead	but they do it without _anyone_ knowing
2016-09-27 04:29:21	voidead	their parents have no clue 
2016-09-27 04:29:32	voidead	and they have sex at the various "love motels"
2016-09-27 04:29:38	voidead	which are designed for couples
2016-09-27 04:30:08	voidead	everyone lives with their parents or grandparents so they must find somewhere else to be alone with their partnet
2016-09-27 04:30:12	voidead	partner*
2016-09-27 04:30:45	skope	yeah, that's pretty fucked up if you ask me :D
2016-09-27 04:31:10	voidead	I think teen sex can be pretty fucked up in general though
2016-09-27 04:31:25	voidead	they don't know what the fuck they are doing.. even if you told them and gave them a handbook on the matter
2016-09-27 04:31:43	voidead	I think its best to just let them figure the shit out on their own
2016-09-27 04:32:06	skope	education about protection is important imo
2016-09-27 04:32:12	voidead	well actually
2016-09-27 04:32:18	voidead	the love motels provide condoms
2016-09-27 04:32:24	voidead	and explain what they are for
2016-09-27 04:32:26	voidead	so I mena
2016-09-27 04:32:28	voidead	mean*
2016-09-27 04:32:35	voidead	they get their educatino
2016-09-27 04:32:37	voidead	education*
2016-09-27 04:32:47	voidead	but as far as everything else
2016-09-27 04:32:55	voidead	they can figure that shit out on their own
2016-09-27 04:33:08	skope	yeah, do they do that differently in us?
2016-09-27 04:33:28	skope	we got basic biology of sex and then people tell about protection and stds
2016-09-27 04:33:32	skope	and that's basically it
2016-09-27 04:33:37	skope	you gotta fuck on your own
2016-09-27 04:34:28	voidead	in the US they are quite clear and blatant about the whole matter.. trying to encourage safe sex among teens etc.. but what ends up happening is the opposite because they were exposed to this knowledge in such a blatant manner they just get horny and start fucking immediately regardless of the safe sex lecture
2016-09-27 04:34:57	voidead	of course.. they were exposed like you were skope and I 
2016-09-27 04:35:01	voidead	but you know
2016-09-27 04:35:04	voidead	kids will fuck 
2016-09-27 04:35:09	skope	that is true
2016-09-27 04:35:12	voidead	and they do exactly what you don't want them to
2016-09-27 04:35:28	voidead	Koreans.. they just.. you know.. learn gradually on their own time
2016-09-27 04:36:30	voidead	among teen girls though.. rape is a real issue
2016-09-27 04:36:42	voidead	but I think that is the case everywhere

2016-09-27 12:37:46	Max`P	I have that thought that if a management tool is this hard to get working, then that piece of shit management tool can go fuck itself and i'll use a very small bash script instead.
2016-09-27 12:38:19	cirkit	i cannot believe simply passing /usr/bin/python2 can't fucking work the same 
2016-09-27 12:38:22	skope	it gets fucked up when you're deploying a lot of servers
2016-09-27 12:38:30	cirkit	instead i have to pass a stupid -e argument

2016-09-27 12:39:27	cirkit	first post the user was also running Arch
2016-09-27 12:39:43	cirkit	i can probably just slap the interpreter in ansible's global config...hopefully
2016-09-27 12:39:55	cirkit	otherwise i guess i could alias ansible to include python2
2016-09-27 12:40:15	cirkit	goddamn you Python
2016-09-27 12:42:01	cirkit	haven't used puppet, but compared to chef and maybe jenkins - ansible is easy as fuck to use for automation as long as you don't run into that stupid problem i was facing with Python
2016-09-27 12:42:39	cirkit	Max`P: i need a goddamn bong toke after all that broken shit
2016-09-27 12:43:24	skope	jenkins is ci runner, not provisioner?

2016-09-27 12:46:06	Max`P	If ansible thinks python is python2, it should work no?
2016-09-27 12:46:58	cirkit	Max`P: I tried the ladder, not former
2016-09-27 12:47:01	cirkit	you would think so

2016-09-27 12:48:44	Max`P	Seriously, if the "tool" doesn't save me work, fuck that tool
2016-09-27 12:49:17	skope	puppet provisioning was slow to learn
2016-09-27 12:49:25	skope	but it will save me lots of time in the future
2016-09-27 12:49:25	cirkit	Max`P: all I want is to run simple automation tests to get more familiar with how the shit works, but I'v sent close to a week just trying to get the goddamn thing to cooperate with Python

2016-09-27 15:35:49	Max`P	I run the PI version that uses the GPU directly, Xorg is just unusable on this thing
2016-09-27 15:36:09	Max`P	Personally I have a bit of a love hate relationship with Kodi. On paper, it's great. In practice, it's buggy as fuck
2016-09-27 15:36:23	sampson	yeah
2016-09-27 15:36:33	sampson	most of the time, when its working right, its cool
2016-09-27 15:36:40	sampson	the rest of the time it sucks balls
2016-09-27 15:36:46	Max`P	The way it insists on organizing everything is full of shit. You really need to have your stuff sorted properly otherwise it's not working
2016-09-27 15:36:51	sampson	yeah
2016-09-27 15:36:53	sampson	thats bullshit
2016-09-27 15:36:58	Max`P	tried adding my video collection to it, it didn't want anything of it
2016-09-27 15:37:04	sampson	thats my biggest peeve with kodi is the naming schemes
2016-09-27 15:37:10	Max`P	Have to add it as movies or TV shows, and i'm like well that's neither of that...
2016-09-27 15:37:17	sampson	right
2016-09-27 15:38:05	Max`P	And lets just say my collection is very... suboptimal: https://d.max-p.me/irc/Capture%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran_2016-09-27_21-37-42.png
2016-09-27 15:38:11	sampson	it only sees about half of my movie and tv shit
2016-09-27 15:38:26	sampson	and a lot of stuff is in my download dir
2016-09-27 15:38:38	sampson	which is a mix, so i have to view it as files
2016-09-27 15:39:30	Max`P	And my music is even worse. 250 GB of music copied from other people, most of it I never heard nor care. I'm at my third attempt at sorting this shit out, full of hardlinks so at least I can use my old structure to find my shit while I sort it out
2016-09-27 15:39:56	Max`P	I think I'm going to give up and sort it like 5 different ways and hardlink shit all over the place ><
2016-09-27 15:40:48	Max`P	Or I'll dump all the stuff I actually listen to into a giant folder of 5000 files or whatever
2016-09-27 15:41:38	Max`P	What I need is a freaking database.
2016-09-27 15:45:10	sampson	https://ptpb.pw/CEcA.txt this is what my shit looks like
2016-09-27 15:45:26	sampson	i bet i have 30+ gigs worth of sample video files and shit
2016-09-27 15:45:26		[15:45]
2016-09-27 15:45:55	sampson	unrared files with the rar's still there taking up two times as much space
2016-09-27 15:46:08	sampson	all kinds of crazy shit going on
2016-09-27 15:52:00		[15:46]
2016-09-27 15:55:37	Max`P	yeah, that's pretty much how my drive is
2016-09-27 15:56:01	Max`P	with like a bunch of unzipped old backups all over the place with all kinds of shit I probably want/should delete

2016-09-27 17:23:41	Max`P	How the fuck can ANYONE think Trump would be any better than Obama? Dammmmn
2016-09-27 17:25:26	prg	he's better on trade
2016-09-27 17:25:34	prg	anti-tpp for one
2016-09-27 17:26:03	prg	there are some legit reaosns for both candidates just a lot of retard fanbois on both sides that won't admit both are overall terrible
2016-09-27 17:26:20	prg	better on h1b's as well
2016-09-27 17:26:46	Max`P	Yeah this years elections are just a disaster

2016-09-27 17:27:35	prg	but douchier and turdier
2016-09-27 17:27:42	Max`P	What makes be go wtf is just how much people hate Obama
2016-09-27 17:28:25	Max`P	I think pretty much everywhere else in the world agrees Obama was probably one of the best presidents, I don't even know who were the other candidates at the previous election
2016-09-27 17:29:12	prg	yeah that baffled me for a while... people are using him as a scapegoat and i mean he does legitimately have some bad policies.. but he'sw way better than bush
2016-09-27 17:29:21	Max`P	that
2016-09-27 17:29:59	prg	people are crazy about it though and i think they're feel justified in their hate based off all the GWB disrespect that was so rampant.. it kinda made talking shit/making fun of the president much less taboo
2016-09-27 17:30:08	prg	was/is
2016-09-27 17:30:08		[17:30]
2016-09-27 17:30:35	prg	so all the hardcore rightwingers are just like GOD DAMN OBAMA
2016-09-27 17:30:44	prg	my favorite is the dark souls mod where you can change "YOU DIED" to "THANKS OBAMA"

2016-09-28 11:40:17	Max`P	Nah, just the typical 4L one
2016-09-28 11:40:36	Max`P	I just inhale and put my face in it and breath in there for a minute or so

2016-09-28 11:40:50	skope	why
2016-09-28 11:41:29	Max`P	Allows breathing without coughing, but I still rebreath the THC a few times, maximizing the efficiency of each toke
2016-09-28 11:41:41	+Anna	damn, hope u stoned and deleted you by an expert I assume so

2016-09-28 11:42:07	skope	i don't see how it prevent coughing though
2016-09-28 11:42:11	skope	you still inhale it
2016-09-28 11:42:15	Max`P	Basically, same effect as the closet, or breathing in the bathroom with the shower running
2016-09-28 11:42:54	Max`P	Ah it's just that you don't need to hold it as long
2016-09-28 11:43:11	skope	well it doesn't matter how long you hold it in

2016-09-28 11:44:30	skope	absorbed in the first few seconds so breath holding is quite pointless.
2016-09-28 11:44:40	skope	page 27
2016-09-28 11:45:29	Max`P	Works for me some reason
2016-09-28 11:45:40	skope	yeah, it's oxygen deprivation

2016-09-29 05:27:00	voidead	he didn't do anything
2016-09-29 05:27:04	voidead	just stood there

2016-09-29 05:28:22	voidead	didn't find him

2016-09-29 05:29:35	voidead	but I think.. he wasn't being a perv.. I think he was sort of pissed off that a foreigner is dating a Korean chick
2016-09-29 05:29:53	voidead	so he was watching us in a sort of mean way
2016-09-29 05:30:12	voidead	I didn't get close enough to the guy to identify him

2016-09-29 05:30:38	voidead	what makes me a little concerned is the fact he lives in that apartment complex somewhere

2016-09-29 11:19:37	alyptik	voidead: i use tmux mostly but i figure i should know how to use screen
2016-09-29 11:20:18	prg	the only advantage screen has imo is that it's more likely to be installed on some machine that you don't have root on
2016-09-29 11:21:01	prg	screen keybinds are way more sane by default imo but you can rebind tmux to your liking - my tmux keybinds are basically screen defaults-ish
2016-09-29 11:21:31	Max`P	^ pretty much why I use screen most of the time. Just couldn't figure tmux's bindings
2016-09-29 11:21:36	alyptik	yea that is my thinking prg 
2016-09-29 11:21:41	alyptik	i like tmux bindings a lot more
2016-09-29 11:21:49	Max`P	screen all you need to know is ^A^D
2016-09-29 11:21:53	prg	tmux default binds make no sense to me
2016-09-29 11:22:47	alyptik	Max`P: can i attach all windows of other session to current in new windows?
2016-09-29 11:22:51	alyptik	that is only thing i cant figure out
2016-09-29 11:23:04	Max`P	no idea
2016-09-29 11:23:24	Max`P	I only use screen when I may lose connection to the server or want to be able to grab back the tty of something running in the background
2016-09-29 11:24:28	alyptik	yeah the screen -x thing is nice

2016-09-29 12:17:48	alyptik	lol
2016-09-29 12:18:18	Max`P	I was like "well this isn't looking like it's going to activate my Windows"
2016-09-29 12:18:34	Max`P	found a bat script with all fake progress in it. Welp, got owned
2016-09-29 12:18:40	 *	Max`P rolls back machine
2016-09-29 12:19:04	alyptik	kmspico?
2016-09-29 12:19:10	alyptik	or microsoft toolkit
2016-09-29 12:20:22	Max`P	kmspico
2016-09-29 12:20:46	Max`P	The one I already had didn't work so I tried downloading one from the net, seems like I got one of the several fakes
2016-09-29 12:21:00	alyptik	it happens
2016-09-29 12:24:28	Max`P	oh, apparently you can't activate Windows 7 Ultimate with kmspico because it's not a KMS version
2016-09-29 12:26:24	alyptik	it's not?
2016-09-29 12:26:28	alyptik	what does it use
2016-09-29 12:26:43	Max`P	apparently I need to use Daz's loader or something, trying it out now
2016-09-29 12:28:57	Max`P	which should be easy to try as soon as that piece of shit connects to the network share
2016-09-29 12:29:16	Max`P	THAT is why I don't and will never pay for Windows.
2016-09-29 12:33:12	alyptik	Max`P: how come you don't want to use win10?
2016-09-29 12:33:12		[12:33]
2016-09-29 12:33:30	Max`P	Because that specific user uses Windows 7 so I send screenshots in Windows 7
2016-09-29 12:33:41	Max`P	because if it doesn't match to the pixel and color customers can't figure shit out
2016-09-29 12:34:12	Max`P	Hurray, activated, now I can take my damned screenshots
2016-09-29 12:40:00		[12:34]
2016-09-29 12:49:29	Max`P	Oh great, now we have a Windows XP user

2016-09-29 13:00:05	Max`P	Spotify be like "I see you disliked 10 songs of this artist, so here's more juuuust in case we figure one of her you don't hate"
2016-09-29 13:00:29	halfwit	Spotify is pretty poor that way
2016-09-29 13:00:42	halfwit	They seem to push commercially viable products 
2016-09-29 13:00:44	Max`P	Seriously, the more I use it the more I notice that it's kind of shit
2016-09-29 13:00:50	halfwit	Same thing I noticed with iTunes.
2016-09-29 13:00:52	halfwit	I fucking hated that.
2016-09-29 13:01:23	halfwit	Looked at my play history over the course of a few months, the two popular tunes had an insane disproportionate play rate to others, despite being ranked by me much lower.
2016-09-29 13:01:31	halfwit	Got rid of the device, never looked back heh
2016-09-29 13:06:09	Max`P	Yeah I think I may end my subscription soon-ish and just download everything the old fashionned way
2016-09-29 13:06:28	alyptik	Max`P: vk.com is my goto for music
2016-09-29 13:06:30	Max`P	I subscribed to them specifically to discover music and so far it's work just as good as YouTube's automatic suggestions
2016-09-29 13:06:32	voidead	I never liked spotify honestly
2016-09-29 13:06:46	alyptik	easiest 320kbps downloading i have found since mp3fy.com died 
2016-09-29 13:09:14	halfwit	I like Google Play music's suggestions and stations and stuff so far for discovery, but it's getting to be a bit of a bubble 
2016-09-29 13:09:38	Max`P	Well to be honest, some of their suggestions in the weekly discovery were pretty decent, but it's getting repetititive quick
2016-09-29 13:09:45	Max`P	Hmm, I hated Google Play Music personally
2016-09-29 13:09:46	halfwit	Mhm.
2016-09-29 13:09:54	alyptik	for discovery i listen to DJ in that genre
2016-09-29 13:09:59	alyptik	not sure if that works for metal
2016-09-29 13:09:59	Max`P	I thought it was very slow and the radios were really terrible, I'd be skipping songs all the time
2016-09-29 13:10:06	alyptik	never seen a metal DJ yet
2016-09-29 13:10:09	halfwit	We just use BridgesFreezeFirst
2016-09-29 13:10:22	voidead	steel republic
2016-09-29 13:10:25	halfwit	Max`P — May be better now? I dunno. It's decent the way I use it. 
2016-09-29 13:10:26	Max`P	I listen to EDM and I do have a bunch of radios, but I get tired quick of the same shit coming back
2016-09-29 13:10:37	alyptik	yeah radios are meh to me
2016-09-29 13:10:53	alyptik	shit like ASOT is horrible and gives edm a bad name
2016-09-29 13:10:55	halfwit	Who knows. The radios I only hit once in a blue moon now, I just use my own personal playlists, death.fm, etc.
2016-09-29 13:11:55	halfwit	Max`P — You can script it so you grab links to whole discographies from Google play, so I have about 12,000 streaming links that I randomize in mpd. Then I have my personal collection, I'm working on mixing that all in as soon as I get around to it
2016-09-29 13:12:33	Max`P	Ok seriously, Spotify must have some big ass contract to push "Carly Rae Jepson" because I keep having that shit on the radio
2016-09-29 13:12:33		[13:12]
2016-09-29 13:12:39	halfwit	Lol
2016-09-29 13:13:21	halfwit	Try Sirius Xm, holy fuck is it repetitive.
2016-09-29 13:13:36	halfwit	We had "The Blend" at one job. All day, about 30 songs would mix.
2016-09-29 13:13:37	Max`P	lol yeah, tried it once, didn't last 20 minutes
2016-09-29 13:13:54	Max`P	oh look, it's Carly again
2016-09-29 13:13:58	halfwit	:D
2016-09-29 13:14:19	Max`P	It's either that or the thumbs down and thumbs up buttons are somewhat reversed
2016-09-29 13:16:42	halfwit	I like this though. "!radio foo
2016-09-29 13:16:55	halfwit	And I get to listen to that station, but it doesn't save the tracks on my shit

2016-09-29 16:19:20	halfwit	(But really, I don't have a VPN but have been considering one for a while to use)
2016-09-29 16:20:00	halfwit	We download and shit sometimes, and our ISP would be the first fucks to turn us in
2016-09-29 16:21:42	halfwit	Also, thanks Google. I really wanted a "recommended video link"
2016-09-29 16:25:29	halfwit	Ugh. Now I'm all confused again. Whatever, I can't afford a VPN anyways so it doesn't even matter whether the fuck I should or shouldn't use it, or would gain anything from using it

2016-09-30 05:26:16	sampson	so i dragged my desktop upstairs and hooked it up to the google fiber box with a good piece of cat5e and im maxing out around 650Mbit i think
2016-09-30 05:26:26	sampson	i cant get any of these speed test sites to work right
2016-09-30 05:26:30	sampson	they all give bs readings

2016-09-30 05:28:44	halfwit	cat5e caps pretty near there I thought, hm.
2016-09-30 05:29:20	sampson	i keep getting told there is no cap
2016-09-30 05:29:57	sampson	people keep telling me there isnt a difference between cat5e and cat6 as far as being able to handle gigabit internet
2016-09-30 05:31:34	sampson	google fibers speed test shows 700MBps down and 928MBps up

2016-09-30 05:38:13	halfwit	All things perfect, with no crosstalk, you'd hit your nominal gigabit speed on cat5e. But that's short runs, perfect cables with no crosstalking and shit, etc. 
2016-09-30 05:38:34	halfwit	You just use the fiber router?

2016-09-30 09:48:38	Max`P	haavard: yea. Well, bad, it's okay. He's just very protective of the company's stuff so I got declined code access in a weird way. And he's basically trying to isolate employees
2016-09-30 09:49:26	Max`P	It's more like, disagreeing personnalities. If you hire me as a manager and ask me to improve shit, I take a lot of space and improve shit.
2016-09-30 09:49:43	haavard	I can see how that's annoying 
2016-09-30 09:50:43	Max`P	Yeah, it's just a LOVE to sneak in everywhere and poke around.
2016-09-30 09:51:17	Max`P	So what happened is I asked the developer's manager to get code access because i'd rather fix shit than write public documentation on how to work around bugs
2016-09-30 09:52:00	Max`P	And the next day there was a global announce that repo access cannot be shared and can only be granted by approval by the boss himself and the co-founder, and anyone caught with access they shouldn't have will be terminated immediately
2016-09-30 09:52:22	Max`P	It doesn't mention anyone by name but I'm fairly sure that was me.
2016-09-30 09:52:43	Max`P	So my response to that is... that's a multiplayer game. Challenge Accepted.

2016-09-30 14:07:47	voidead	he didn't push me the whole way.. just pushed me to get started
2016-09-30 14:08:14	voidead	catching reliable waves is hard sometimes though.. you need to go out at the right time or else the waves will suck

2016-09-30 15:02:23	ominous	how do you change the timestamp level?
2016-09-30 15:02:24	ominous	rather
2016-09-30 15:02:31	ominous	which variables are available for that in the config?
2016-09-30 15:03:20	ominous	hmm
2016-09-30 15:03:34	cirkit	like /format timestamp {timestamp %%H:%%M:%%S}
2016-09-30 15:03:37	ominous	also how do you change the nick thing "<ominous>" I hate that

2016-09-30 15:06:58	cirkit	# treated "normally", you could change the time/user name to whatever time = "{sb $Z}";
2016-09-30 15:07:11	cirkit	ominous: that's in my config ^ ... the $Z variable 
2016-09-30 15:07:26	ominous	ah yeah?
2016-09-30 15:07:26	cirkit	like for me it just shows the hour/minute 
2016-09-30 15:07:37	cirkit	i assume thre are other vars besides $Z you can use

2016-09-30 15:10:05	cirkit	oh..it seems in the irssi config `time = "{sb $Z}";` defines the clock shown as hour/minute in the bar

2016-09-30 15:10:43	cirkit	so /FORMAT timestamp {timestamp %%H:%%M:%%S} will be only for the chat time (not bar)

2016-09-30 15:11:03	ominous	I just need the bar to show hour/minute only

2016-09-30 15:19:47	ominous	I mean.. I guess it related to the theme or something.. like when you talk everyone has 10:18:36 < cirkit> ominous: you could just /nick <nick> and then /save so it updates the config

2016-09-30 15:35:12	cirkit	and a permanent entry for how the timestmap should look will be in the config

2016-09-30 15:37:14	ominous	yeah there we go.. but now the bar has the seconds ticking again
2016-09-30 15:37:22	Max`P	Yeah I wouldn't feel that great either knowing I could get fired for absolutely no reason other than a random drug test
2016-09-30 15:37:23	cirkit	ah
2016-09-30 15:38:00	prg	Max`P: exactly - and then if other employers call and say why did you let him go they can say failed drug test

2016-09-30 15:38:38	ominous	Max`P: right
2016-09-30 15:38:41	ominous	thats what matters
2016-09-30 15:38:47	cirkit	exactly...they're basically discriminating against someone's personal life choices outside of work
2016-09-30 15:38:53	ominous	you are getting paid to do some service.. not tell everyone your secrets 
2016-09-30 15:38:55	cirkit	it's not relevant to the job what you do in your personal life
2016-09-30 15:39:02	cirkit	therefore...turn down all those fuckers
2016-09-30 15:39:26	Max`P	Anyway, so far I still haven,t gotten anyone call my previous employers. I'm usually hired because they know I do the job, how I do it they don't give a shit
2016-09-30 15:39:26		[15:39]
2016-09-30 15:39:41	Max`P	Althought I can probably be drug test except because of my meds
2016-09-30 15:40:18	ominous	cirkit: I do.. but
2016-09-30 15:40:25	ominous	I guess its related to the theme itself
2016-09-30 15:40:31	ominous	because the default theme does what I want
2016-09-30 15:40:35	ominous	gothic doesn't
2016-09-30 15:40:42	ominous	so I have to search and see what is different
2016-09-30 15:41:12	ominous	irssi is nice.. but this is why I stopped using it years ago in the first place
2016-09-30 15:41:50	cirkit	yeah, i've pretty much been an irssi user since my early days of using Linux
2016-09-30 15:42:19	cirkit	irssi is totally hackable
2016-09-30 15:42:37	prg	yeah i wrote some irssi scripts back in the day
2016-09-30 15:42:43	prg	i used irssi until like maybe 6 months ago
2016-09-30 15:43:07	prg	never realized how sick weechat is... although i am having some memory leak problem but i also have a very lowmem vps w/ mysql running on it and no swap
2016-09-30 15:43:13	cirkit	yeah, wish i knew more Perl to write some scripts for it
2016-09-30 15:44:16	cirkit	maybe i'll launch a weechat instance on the 2nd Arch host after it's all good to go as a backup mail relay 
2016-09-30 15:44:56	ominous	alright I'm switching back to weechat lol

I use OpenLDAP on the backend and have `virtual_mailbox_domains = ldap:/etc/postfix/ldap/ldap-virtual-domains.cf`, but the problem is with an MX relay you must not list the primary domain like example.com (MX1) in `virtual_mailbox_domains`. My question: Is it okay for me to comment out `virtual_mailbox_domains` on MX2 since MX1 already has this defined? Do I even need any of the virtual LDAP entries f

2016-10-01 19:10:51	halfwit	Yeah, but I know how easy it is to build a listener for the clipboard.
2016-10-01 19:10:53	cirkit	the problem probably has a lot to do with shitty firmwares
2016-10-01 19:10:55	halfwit	Can run unpriviledged.
2016-10-01 19:11:00	cirkit	so the WiFi is shit by default

2016-10-01 19:44:43	halfwit	I need to stop learning, before I dislike everything xD
2016-10-01 19:49:30	voidead	which is better mpv or mplayer?
2016-10-01 19:49:53	halfwit	Think mpv was a rewrite of mplayer, to be less bloated; but I've never actually used mplayer
2016-10-01 19:50:40	voidead	I'm glad I got this mobile battery charger
2016-10-01 19:50:47	voidead	going to be useful for when I'm riding my bike long distances

2016-10-01 19:52:58	halfwit	Was having trouble removing it, lol. Needed to use full path.
2016-10-01 19:53:06	halfwit	"invalid option -- 'g'
2016-10-01 19:54:21	voidead	yeah thats what you get for naming it -g

2016-10-01 20:03:00		[19:57]
2016-10-01 20:16:52	alyptik	halfwit: when that happens to me i tab complete, i think i had a file named * once
2016-10-01 20:17:52	alyptik	that needs zsh though
2016-10-01 20:18:19	halfwit	Holy shit, lol.
2016-10-01 20:18:19		[20:18]
2016-10-01 20:18:29	halfwit	But tab complete didn't help in this case.
2016-10-01 20:19:51	alyptik	ah heh it is likely because \* is fine but \-\g is the same thing
2016-10-01 20:19:59	alyptik	just thought about it
2016-10-01 20:20:37	halfwit	I ended with `rm /home/halfwit/-g`
2016-10-01 20:21:49	alyptik	oh rm -- -g might have worked too, your way i like better though
2016-10-01 20:21:59	alyptik	i am afraid to rm relative paths without -i heh
2016-10-01 20:22:00	halfwit	Fuck, yep. You're right.
2016-10-01 20:22:17	halfwit	`touch -- -g`
2016-10-01 20:22:22	halfwit	`rm -- -g`
2016-10-01 20:22:29	voidead	I typically use full path anyways though
2016-10-01 20:22:32	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-01 20:22:36	alyptik	it's safer
2016-10-01 20:22:55	alyptik	rm ./* is fine rm * will end you

2016-10-01 20:46:28	Max`P	All my devices now have globally resolvable hostname with a globally routable address, and my local DNS server (the Pi) has an override to have those resolve to the corresponding local addresses
2016-10-01 20:46:39	+Anna	reminds me a raise once I adjusted
2016-10-01 20:46:52	voidead	Max`P› nice
2016-10-01 20:47:02	voidead	Max`P› configured via what?
2016-10-01 20:47:06	voidead	nginx?
2016-10-01 20:48:08	Max`P	so, if you're on my WiFi, desktop.max-p.me will resolve to 192.168.2.50. On the internet, it resolves to 2607:5300:60:594f:20:5540:0:1
2016-10-01 20:48:11	alyptik	Max`P: i was debating doing that for my server
2016-10-01 20:48:16	alyptik	was it a pain to setup?
2016-10-01 20:48:30	alyptik	bind right?
2016-10-01 20:48:30	Max`P	voidead: nah, just unbound. nginx doesn't do DNS
2016-10-01 20:48:48	voidead	yeah I know
2016-10-01 20:48:59	voidead	but I wasn't sure what you were configuring
2016-10-01 20:48:59		[20:48]
2016-10-01 20:49:22	Max`P	alyptik: unbound. Well, unbound and nsd. My real DNS server runs nsd but my Pi runs unbound to cache and resolve DNS all on its own
2016-10-01 20:49:57	Max`P	and yes it was easy. `local-data: "pi.max-p.me A 192.168.2.10"`, couple of these and done.
2016-10-01 20:49:59	alyptik	oo
2016-10-01 20:50:06	voidead	yeah I was considering using my laptop as a DNS server
2016-10-01 20:50:15	voidead	I'd rather just get a pi though
2016-10-01 20:50:16	alyptik	i wanted to setup unbound but learning was too much of pain 
2016-10-01 20:50:24	alyptik	so i just forgot about it after, heh
2016-10-01 20:50:33	alyptik	s/ was/ bind was
2016-10-01 20:50:33	+Anna	alyptik meant to say: i wanted to setup unbound but learning bind was too much of pain
2016-10-01 20:51:34	alyptik	wait so how do you have both listening on 53?
2016-10-01 20:51:41	Max`P	oh yeah, bind is a massive pain in the ass
2016-10-01 20:51:57	Max`P	alyptik: no. The pi runs unbound, my dedi runs nsd
2016-10-01 20:52:10	alyptik	oh hah
2016-10-01 20:52:34	Max`P	web and dns is served by hosting.max-p.me, which is a VM on srv1.max-p.me
2016-10-01 20:52:46	halfwit	Heh, https://ptpb.pw/1dZr.mkv is a start. There's no possible way on linux to have it write to an input box of an alternate program without first having had opened a socket, or a fifo. Firefox lets you telnet and do wizardry, but it's not worth it to me.
2016-10-01 20:53:04	halfwit	But at least I don't have to use the clip
2016-10-01 20:53:18	alyptik	so what are you trying to do halfwit 
2016-10-01 20:53:24	voidead	you should be using dem stacks nigga
2016-10-01 20:53:43	halfwit	alyptik — Use masterpassword in a simple enough way, but without clipboards
2016-10-01 20:53:47	alyptik	ah
2016-10-01 20:53:50	halfwit	x clipboards are a bit sketchy.

2016-10-02 08:50:36	halfwit	Yeah. everyone lies to save face, etc
2016-10-02 08:51:26	voidead	Hillary and Trump are huge distractions.. everything is a huge distraction.. we have the Brexit thing.. we have militaries amassing in bulk all over the world.. but everyone just wants to focus on politics and stupidity
2016-10-02 08:51:41	voidead	the military controls _everyone_ regardless of race or nationality
2016-10-02 08:51:59	halfwit	voidead — have you seen the more recent videos by Anonymous by chance?
2016-10-02 08:52:10	voidead	nah
2016-10-02 08:52:12	halfwit	I mean, they're not what they used to be, but it's still interesting to see 
2016-10-02 08:52:21	halfwit	They have that more global perspective 
2016-10-02 08:52:55	halfwit	They talk about all that thought, military movements and such
2016-10-02 08:52:58	voidead	well anonymous isn't anything special imo.. but they are at least a collective idea that everyone can relate to
2016-10-02 08:53:09	halfwit	Though *
2016-10-02 08:55:46	halfwit	I get tired of this seemingly omnipresent sickness that manifests as a lust for power. Why can't we just start killing off people that try to undermine basic human rights to better themselves ;-;
2016-10-02 08:56:13	voidead	because thats considered "wrong"
2016-10-02 08:56:15	voidead	lol
2016-10-02 08:56:47	halfwit	Sure, they're just doing what they have every right to, to get ahead. But I don't feel any person should ever have it fundamentally better than anyone else, without that being a necessity or an indictment of their locale. And, to be honest, we have the fucking technology and infrastructure that the latter point is no longer relevent.
2016-10-02 08:56:57	halfwit	I dunno. I just dream of nicer things :p
2016-10-02 08:57:40	voidead	just because we statistically can all live together and share resources quite well.. doesn't mean its possible for our species
2016-10-02 08:58:06	halfwit	Lol, yeah. We're useless like that.
2016-10-02 08:58:21	halfwit	Need machines to manage our useless human nature :p
2016-10-02 08:58:32	voidead	which leads to the fact that billions of people need to die in order for our species to live comfortably for the next 1,000 years or more
2016-10-02 08:58:55	halfwit	WWIII soon I guess.
2016-10-02 08:59:06	voidead	if we were controlled effectively then we wouldn't have all these issues we are facing now
2016-10-02 08:59:13	halfwit	I know
2016-10-02 08:59:15	voidead	control being.. mass death
2016-10-02 08:59:23	halfwit	Lol, that's one way. 
2016-10-02 08:59:25	voidead	the earth has its own way of dealing with that
2016-10-02 08:59:27	voidead	in due time
2016-10-02 08:59:35	halfwit	In due time my ass
2016-10-02 08:59:44	halfwit	It's started already
2016-10-02 09:00:01	voidead	we are currently experiencing the 6th great extinction yeah this is true
2016-10-02 09:00:27	halfwit	Coffee time. 
2016-10-02 09:00:45	halfwit	Maybe it'll perk my mood up.
2016-10-02 09:03:51	voidead	thats the thing people don't fully grasp
2016-10-02 09:03:51		[09:03]
2016-10-02 09:04:08	voidead	the earth was here before us and will continue to be here after we are all dead
2016-10-02 09:04:20	halfwit	They really don't seem to get that we're not gods
2016-10-02 09:04:23	voidead	some new species will pop up in our place 
2016-10-02 09:04:25	voidead	and so on
2016-10-02 09:04:26	halfwit	They presume divine providence
2016-10-02 09:04:51	halfwit	And that pisses me off the most, we're fantastic creatures capable of nearly infinite things, but that doesn't mean that we're immortal as a species.
2016-10-02 09:05:23	halfwit	So we're going to fucking rot in the ground, all of our achievements beneath us, for no gain. (Unless some other being takes up the torch, and learns from what we've done)
2016-10-02 09:05:47	voidead	no species is perfect you know.. our inherent behavior will be our undoing.. the next species will not be perfect either
2016-10-02 09:06:00	halfwit	Well, yeah.
2016-10-02 09:06:57	voidead	I'm sure there were species before us that were quite successful.. I don't think people realize just how much time has passed before our existence
2016-10-02 09:07:10	voidead	no evidence of their existence? of course not
2016-10-02 09:07:25	voidead	same goes for us too
2016-10-02 09:07:34	voidead	everything we ever accomplished will be lost
2016-10-02 09:08:25	halfwit	I mean, there exists a possibilty that we'll continue on, fix our shitfest, maybe even get multiplanetary. But the chances are way, way the fuck lower than humans seem to want to believe
2016-10-02 09:08:32	halfwit	It's improbable
2016-10-02 09:08:52	voidead	with that said.. that doesn't mean we can't enjoy life while we are able to enjoy it.. thats the whole point anyways.. why exist if we dwell on not existing at some point
2016-10-02 09:09:05	halfwit	Haha
2016-10-02 09:09:11	halfwit	so you get it.

2016-10-02 09:11:05	voidead	its like.. when you are a kid you never could sit still and stare at the wall.. you wanted to play or do _something_ well that is who we are and why we exist.. we are here to do what we are capable of doing and continue to do it until we can't anymore.. then another species comes along and does the same thing
2016-10-02 09:11:38	voidead	why is that so hard for people to accept?
2016-10-02 09:12:01	halfwit	Instead we go through school, learning prescribed doctrines so that people in power can continue to say, "What a good job we've done! Money well spent"
2016-10-02 09:12:01	voidead	why do we need a magical God to control us?
2016-10-02 09:14:12	voidead	when we die we are simply recycled back into the fabric of space and reformed one day as whatever shape comes together
2016-10-02 09:14:35	voidead	this is quite a beautiful thing if you think about it

2016-10-02 09:15:26	halfwit	What bugs me is we're challenging that, in quite the cavalier manner.
2016-10-02 09:15:33	halfwit	Like, fucking up the planet
2016-10-02 09:15:57	halfwit	Since I find life to be something of a worthwhile thing to preserve, even if it means nothing really
2016-10-02 09:17:44	voidead	the whole notion of "life after death" doesn't need some philosophy or religion for it to be absolutely true in some aspect.. life and death are the exact same thing.. in fact we were dead and alive since the beginning the only change is at this moment we are formed this way for about 100 years or so
2016-10-02 09:22:10	voidead	and you know.. people want to say "ah you are a nihilist" or "you are an atheist" actually I'm neither of those.. I've just come to the realization that we can't possibly label or categorize the reality of things even though we want to so badly
2016-10-02 09:22:10		[09:22]
2016-10-02 09:22:25	voidead	the truth is simply that

2016-10-02 14:50:31	cirkit	alyptik: yeah, can be as many mailboxes or even single should still work the same..basically it works between paired backend dovecot hosts to sync all mail
2016-10-02 14:51:14	cirkit	basically if you have a replicated backend like MySQL or LDAP, dsync works nicely in syncing since anyways the replicated user data is the same 
2016-10-02 14:51:56	cirkit	i did it using tcp but you can also setup dsync to use ssh
2016-10-02 14:51:56	alyptik	ahh gotcha

2016-10-02 21:05:01	haavard	From what channel? Is it not allowed to say "fuck" there?
2016-10-02 21:05:34	Max`P	AOT, so probably because of "fag"
2016-10-02 21:05:40	haavard	But that's english
2016-10-02 21:05:48	haavard	Well, all of it is lol
2016-10-02 21:05:53	haavard	But it's british english for "cigarette"

2016-10-02 21:06:23	cirkit	LOL voidead 
2016-10-02 21:06:27	haavard	cirkit: some of those words make sense
2016-10-02 21:06:28	cirkit	those fapanese tho
2016-10-02 21:07:07	voidead	apparently you can't say gay either
2016-10-02 21:07:10	voidead	which is dumb
2016-10-02 21:07:22	voidead	gay is a perfectly acceptable word for homosexual
2016-10-02 21:07:27	cirkit	they don't believe in freedom?
2016-10-02 21:07:38	cirkit	why can't you say gay?
2016-10-02 21:07:39	cirkit	lol
2016-10-02 21:07:43	voidead	if you say "that is so gay" you will get banned
2016-10-02 21:08:10	voidead	mostly because the ops are feminist SJWs

2016-10-02 21:08:18	voidead	lol
2016-10-02 21:08:20	cirkit	politically correct nazis must perish
2016-10-02 21:08:42	bridgesfreezefirst	i think it's more a matter of what kind of channel it is
2016-10-02 21:08:57	voidead	now don't get me wrong.. that channel needed to be cleaned up.. but god damn tigrmesh is a raging SJW feminist
2016-10-02 21:09:02	bridgesfreezefirst	like, this is a small private channel, it's all good whatever we say here
2016-10-02 21:09:11	bridgesfreezefirst	yeah people go way too far with it
2016-10-02 21:09:16	haavard	Saying "that is so gay" isn't about the word usage
2016-10-02 21:09:22	haavard	"that is so homosexual" is just as bad
2016-10-02 21:09:23	bridgesfreezefirst	esp. the "cultural appropriation" nonsense
2016-10-02 21:09:24	voidead	haavard› its the context yeah
2016-10-02 21:09:37	voidead	haavard› but they ban _anytime_ you say gay
2016-10-02 21:09:40	voidead	for any reason
2016-10-02 21:09:41	bridgesfreezefirst	yeah exactly, the context is what matters
2016-10-02 21:09:48	voidead	either ban or kick you
2016-10-02 21:09:55	voidead	or at least say some shit
2016-10-02 21:10:06	voidead	"I have this gay friend, she is cool" might be acceptable
2016-10-02 21:10:06		[21:10]
2016-10-02 21:10:52	voidead	I like our rules here.. "don't be an asshole" how much more clear can you be?
2016-10-02 21:11:19	Max`P	this is kind of the only time it is valid tho. Understandable with faggot but gay I'm kinda meh about it
2016-10-02 21:11:58	voidead	yeah if you say "this piece of shit <insert application name> is fucking gay"
2016-10-02 21:12:04	voidead	that can be offensive
2016-10-02 21:12:18	haavard	voidead: because "asshole" is ambiguous
2016-10-02 21:12:41	Max`P	faggot is kind of synonym to moron, pussy. But with gay it's kind of the only purpose it has
2016-10-02 21:12:43	bridgesfreezefirst	yeah but in metal culture "gay" doesn't really mean "homosexual"
2016-10-02 21:13:09	Max`P	Yeah, that would be an exception
2016-10-02 21:13:20	bridgesfreezefirst	like Rob Halford is gay, but not "gay" as in "everything Cryptopsy has done since The Unspoken King is gay"
2016-10-02 21:13:25	voidead	haavard› but everyone knows what being an asshole means.. its obvious.. I mean the rules aren't perfectly clear but really if people are calling you an asshole for doing certain things.. then you are in fact being an asshole
2016-10-02 21:14:00	voidead	bridgesfreezefirst› yeah skateboard culture too
2016-10-02 21:14:20	voidead	"man that 360 flip he landed looked gay as fuck"
2016-10-02 21:15:12	voidead	but yeah I guess if someone is offended then it should be regulated.. in this case our server has mostly like minded people so none of us are offended easily
2016-10-02 21:15:23	voidead	unless you say "fuck you, you fucking druggy piece of shit"
2016-10-02 21:15:25	Max`P	Well it's the intent
2016-10-02 21:15:31	voidead	drugs are apparently a hot topic around here lol
2016-10-02 21:16:42	voidead	I might be a faggot.. but I DON'T NEED REHAB! I can handle MY drugs!
2016-10-02 21:17:53	bridgesfreezefirst	i think on a smaller channel it is obvious when people are kidding and when they are seriously being dicks
2016-10-02 21:18:25	Max`P	a lot of people in AOT are dicks, don't need a smaller channel to notice
2016-10-02 21:18:58	voidead	Max`P› yeah I'm glad the vast majority of those assholes aren't here
2016-10-02 21:19:10	voidead	thats why none of them have been invited
2016-10-02 21:19:14	voidead	only a few maybe
2016-10-02 21:19:23	haavard	My only experience with AOT is that one guy got so triggered by my trolling he raged and got himself banned while I got nothing
2016-10-02 21:19:27	+Anna	Gotta love when i study to be unproductive the next semester
2016-10-02 21:19:28	bridgesfreezefirst	AOT?

2016-10-02 21:20:11	bridgesfreezefirst	that's why i went into law instead of medicine like my grandfather wanted
2016-10-02 21:20:13	voidead	I'm still laughing
2016-10-02 21:20:57	Max`P	Anna is seriously starting to have kind of a really hilariously bad personality
2016-10-02 21:21:04	bridgesfreezefirst	lol yeah Max`P 
2016-10-02 21:21:14	voidead	I will admit though.. on Snoonet I'm quite abrasive.. as you've experienced first hand bridgesfreezefirst lol
2016-10-02 21:21:22	bridgesfreezefirst	well yeah
2016-10-02 21:21:32	bridgesfreezefirst	that's why i don't go into the bigger channels anymore
2016-10-02 21:21:40	bridgesfreezefirst	only the shitposting channels
2016-10-02 21:21:49	haavard	I mean, there's a reason so many retards come here with their botnets
2016-10-02 21:21:59	haavard	You guys have a special ability to step on people's toes
2016-10-02 21:22:08	voidead	not really
2016-10-02 21:22:27	voidead	in fact we wanted to be hidden.. but by chance trolls find us
2016-10-02 21:22:41	voidead	just so happens wowaname found #thelounge
2016-10-02 21:22:47	voidead	and went straight in

2016-10-02 21:23:11	voidead	he doesn't give a shit
2016-10-02 21:23:36	voidead	but you know.. I pissed off demize once because I told him pulseaudio is a piece of shit
2016-10-02 21:23:54	voidead	you know.. its all about how much of a fag you are for certain applications
2016-10-02 21:23:55	bridgesfreezefirst	wowaname is on freenode now?
2016-10-02 21:24:05	voidead	bridgesfreezefirst› wowaname is from Freenode isn't she?
2016-10-02 21:24:16	voidead	bridgesfreezefirst› she was on Snoonet?
2016-10-02 21:24:19	bridgesfreezefirst	cirkit told me she was from Rizon
2016-10-02 21:24:23	voidead	bridgesfreezefirst› ah

2016-10-02 21:24:45	haavard	I didn't know people identified IRC networks from which they are "from"
2016-10-02 21:24:46	bridgesfreezefirst	i really don't know...i rarely go on Rizon now, and only occasionally go on freenode
2016-10-02 21:24:52	voidead	I first saw wowaname in #freenode and ##chanzilla

2016-10-02 21:26:06	voidead	#freenode is a trollfest.. but for obvious reasons

2016-10-02 21:34:57	bridgesfreezefirst	Stallman is fucking creepy
2016-10-02 21:35:19	voidead	yeah 
2016-10-02 21:35:26	voidead	he is dirty
2016-10-02 21:35:34	voidead	also he is kind of annoying
2016-10-02 21:35:44	voidead	but he does make some solid points
2016-10-02 21:35:47	haavard	He's right, though
2016-10-02 21:36:15	haavard	If he announced that some numbers would win the lottery, I'd buy tickets because fuck me if he isn't always right
2016-10-02 21:36:24	voidead	some of what he says is stupid.. but for the most part he isn't wrong about most things

2016-10-02 21:37:14	voidead	but... *cough*
2016-10-02 21:37:18	voidead	just saw this in AOT
2016-10-02 21:37:30	+Anna	yo
2016-10-02 21:38:23	voidead	but this is reddit
2016-10-02 21:38:28	voidead	and likely taken out of context
2016-10-02 21:38:42	haavard	No I've heard about that before, I think he actually thinks that's true
2016-10-02 21:38:48	haavard	Which, I concede, is a little on the edge
2016-10-02 21:39:34	voidead	maybe its another one of his "social experiments"
2016-10-02 21:39:37	voidead	as he calls them
2016-10-02 21:39:42	alyptik	sheesh
2016-10-02 21:39:46	voidead	like when he ate some shit from his feet
2016-10-02 21:40:21	haavard	I don't think his opinions on child pornography and necrophilia will ever show up in r/stallmanwasright
2016-10-02 21:40:21		[21:40]
2016-10-02 21:40:28	voidead	LOL
2016-10-02 21:40:32	alyptik	rofl
2016-10-02 21:40:50	voidead	well we shouldn't be concerned with his opinions on that shit anyways.. I'm concerned with his opinions on software
2016-10-02 21:40:56	voidead	which he is mostly right about
2016-10-02 21:42:08	voidead	damn I just made the perfect cup of coffee
2016-10-02 21:42:37	voidead	and I realized something.. as I was watching it brew I saw the grains falling to the bottom.. when most of them have fallen that is when you can pour
2016-10-02 21:42:51	voidead	has the most flavor
2016-10-02 21:43:01	haavard	What kind of coffee is this? French press?
2016-10-02 21:43:30	voidead	yeah French press coarse grained coffee.. they grinded it at this coffee shop
2016-10-02 21:43:41	voidead	ground*
2016-10-02 21:43:52	voidead	grinded*
2016-10-02 21:43:54	voidead	hmm
2016-10-02 21:43:59	voidead	its ground coffee
2016-10-02 21:44:01	voidead	LOL
2016-10-02 21:44:13	voidead	I think ground is the correct grammar
2016-10-02 21:44:20	haavard	I had to ask my flatmate the other day why he keeps buying the same coffee, it tastes like shit
2016-10-02 21:44:28	haavard	"It's not the same one I'm trying different ones"
2016-10-02 21:44:31	voidead	LOL
2016-10-02 21:44:42	haavard	"Really", I say, "how come all of them taste like shit?"
2016-10-02 21:44:52	haavard	Then I proceeded to brew two cups and it tasted good
2016-10-02 21:44:59	haavard	And he's like "holy shit this is good what did you do?"
2016-10-02 21:45:04	voidead	yeah I've become jaded when it comes to coffee.. I know which ones taste like shit and which ones taste awesome
2016-10-02 21:45:16	+Anna	nope
2016-10-02 21:45:21	voidead	fuck off Anna 
2016-10-02 21:45:21	haavard	I have no idea what I did. I just made two regular cups of coffee. The bigger question is how the fuck did he manage to fuck up brewing coffee?
2016-10-02 21:45:33	voidead	haavard› with a french press?
2016-10-02 21:45:42	voidead	maybe he doesn't know how to brew that shit yeah
2016-10-02 21:45:50	haavard	No, that's possible to fuck up.. this is like a regular coffee machine
2016-10-02 21:45:56	voidead	oh
2016-10-02 21:45:56	haavard	Put in a filter, coffee and water and press the button
2016-10-02 21:45:57	voidead	welll
2016-10-02 21:46:00	voidead	LOL
2016-10-02 21:46:03	voidead	yeah thats dumb
2016-10-02 21:46:03	haavard	Like what the fuck, how does his coffee taste so bad
2016-10-02 21:46:27	voidead	haavard› then it all comes down to how much coffee he puts in there
2016-10-02 21:47:03	haavard	Yeah, I guess
2016-10-02 21:47:03	alyptik	maybe he burned it or something too
2016-10-02 21:47:07	voidead	true
2016-10-02 21:47:13	voidead	burnt coffee does taste like shit
2016-10-02 21:47:21	voidead	thats possible with a machine
2016-10-02 21:47:22	haavard	I also double-filtered it, but that can't be it alone
2016-10-02 21:47:28	haavard	What how do you burn coffee?
2016-10-02 21:47:35	voidead	haavard› water being too hot
2016-10-02 21:47:37	alyptik	leave it on burner for a day
2016-10-02 21:47:40	alyptik	or that
2016-10-02 21:47:40	voidead	but yeah
2016-10-02 21:47:42	voidead	that too
2016-10-02 21:47:44	voidead	LOL
2016-10-02 21:47:48	voidead	leaving it on the burner for sure
2016-10-02 21:47:49	haavard	Oh, this was just fresh coffee every time
2016-10-02 21:47:54	haavard	No burner
2016-10-02 21:47:54	voidead	that is a sure fire way to burn it
2016-10-02 21:47:59	alyptik	also percolator is murder
2016-10-02 21:48:04	haavard	Tasting like shit though
2016-10-02 21:48:04	voidead	haavard› then maybe he is leaving the shit on there for too long
2016-10-02 21:48:13	haavard	Not like the gourmet shit from Pulp Fiction
2016-10-02 21:48:42	alyptik	distccd actually halves my compiling time wow
2016-10-02 21:48:44	voidead	thats why I like this french press.. you brew it and there is no burner.. its just brewing and you press that shit and drink it.. if you don't it will just get cold
2016-10-02 21:48:50	voidead	cold coffee isn't bad either
2016-10-02 21:49:07	haavard	French press coffee is the shit, I have one in Norway
2016-10-02 21:49:17	cirkit	there's too much text on my screen to read
2016-10-02 21:49:25	cirkit	time to get more stoned 
2016-10-02 21:49:29	voidead	I forgot which country Bodom is from haavard 
2016-10-02 21:49:35	haavard	Finland?
2016-10-02 21:49:42	alyptik	lol cirkit 
2016-10-02 21:49:43	voidead	I can't be sure
2016-10-02 21:49:48	voidead	could be Finnish
2016-10-02 21:49:58	haavard	Bodom is a lake, and Finland has a gorillion lakes
2016-10-02 21:50:00	+Anna	Holy fucking shit!!!

2016-10-02 21:51:41	voidead	"Bodom gets French pressed by federal court"
2016-10-02 21:52:46	voidead	being French pressed sounds like the equivalent of being pegged by a chick in a French maid outfit lol
2016-10-02 21:53:08	voidead	I'm sure Anna will recycle that a month later and we will laugh pretty hard
2016-10-02 21:55:08	haavard	It's certainly embedded in the Markov model

2016-10-02 22:18:30		[22:18]
2016-10-02 22:18:33	cirkit	so incoming messages will be encrypted as they hit the backend mail store
2016-10-02 22:18:55	cirkit	pickfire: perhaps
2016-10-02 22:22:54	cirkit	pickfire: any clue how to encrypt user mail as it comes in?
2016-10-02 22:23:15	pickfire	cirkit: tls?
2016-10-02 22:23:20	cirkit	if the user's mail is simply forwarded to their preferred address it  doesn't matter i guess
2016-10-02 22:23:25	cirkit	pickfire: ???
2016-10-02 22:23:34	pickfire	starttls
2016-10-02 22:23:43	cirkit	it does use starttls
2016-10-02 22:23:51	cirkit	that does not encrypt mailstore data
2016-10-02 22:23:53	pickfire	cirkit: Do you mean to encrypt the mail sent from another mail server?
2016-10-02 22:24:08	cirkit	yes, pickfire 
2016-10-02 22:24:22	pickfire	cirkit: Well, I don't think gmail, yahoo and stuff use gpg
2016-10-02 22:24:35	pickfire	tls is the best option
2016-10-02 22:24:42	cirkit	maybe using gpg on a per-user basis is the best solution
2016-10-02 22:24:48	cirkit	well yeah, pickfire 
2016-10-02 22:24:53	pickfire	cirkit: is archlinux.email whitelisted by office365?
2016-10-02 22:24:53	cirkit	the server supports starttls for sure

2016-10-02 22:25:02	cirkit	should it be?

2016-10-02 23:29:51	alyptik	voidead: yeah but the 3rd party ones in /script
2016-10-02 23:29:54	voidead	irssi has a hard time syncing to multiple relay connections

2016-10-02 23:31:44	cirkit	bitlbee is nice
2016-10-02 23:31:59	voidead	yeah I really like it
2016-10-02 23:32:03	voidead	I've been using it for years
2016-10-02 23:32:50	voidead	man there is this old lady living next door to me.. she will have her door open every once in a while and I'll glance in.. holy shit man her house looks so trashed out
2016-10-02 23:32:54	voidead	like one of those hoarders
2016-10-02 23:33:36	cirkit	LOL
2016-10-02 23:33:42	cirkit	voidead: why doesn't she clean that shithole
2016-10-02 23:33:48	voidead	she is old?
2016-10-02 23:33:50	voidead	who knows
2016-10-02 23:33:56	cirkit	ah
2016-10-02 23:34:18	voidead	she is completely alone.. I remember seeing her sitting there I guess watching tv or something all alone.. looks depressing
2016-10-02 23:34:40	voidead	being that old and alone can be rough
2016-10-02 23:34:43	voidead	I could image
2016-10-02 23:34:45	voidead	imagine*
2016-10-02 23:35:39	cirkit	that's fucked up..no family to see her wow
2016-10-02 23:36:04	voidead	this happens 
2016-10-02 23:36:13	voidead	and its why there is a high suicide rate among the elderly
2016-10-02 23:36:24	voidead	there are plenty of reasons
2016-10-02 23:36:49	voidead	its not that people don't care about their grandparents.. its just.. there isn't a very strong social security for the elderly here
2016-10-02 23:37:15	voidead	because Korea developed so fast they haven't had the capability to develop it
2016-10-02 23:37:35	voidead	all of their money was spent on roads and infrastructure etc..
2016-10-02 23:38:18	voidead	almost all the taxi drivers around here are just old retired men
2016-10-02 23:38:39	voidead	they don't have anything else going on so they just drive taxis and that really is the only job they can get
2016-10-02 23:38:42	voidead	its a good job though
2016-10-02 23:38:44	voidead	for old men
2016-10-02 23:39:17	voidead	my girlfriend's dad opened up a billards hall
2016-10-02 23:39:25	voidead	but he isn't that happy with it

2016-10-02 23:55:52	voidead	cirkit: well not everyone.. but yeah Korea developed so fast people have been sort of left behind in a lot of aspects

2016-10-03 00:04:07	cirkit	Korea doesn't sound like a bad place to bike in...would be fun i'm sure
2016-10-03 00:04:38	cirkit	USA is getting worse...almost risky to be out and spotted by thugs or some niggers trying to rob you
2016-10-03 00:06:04	voidead	I can go anywhere and do anything in Korea without much danger 
2016-10-03 00:06:04		[00:06]

2016-10-03 00:10:26	SeferYetzirah	you one of thse hipsters
2016-10-03 00:10:31	voidead	Koreans are very open minded they listen to anything really
2016-10-03 00:10:32	SeferYetzirah	living in some gentiried neighborhood 
2016-10-03 00:10:46	cirkit	i'm far from a hipster

2016-10-03 00:11:14	SeferYetzirah	if youre going off what the media reports
2016-10-03 00:11:15	cirkit	but niggers and thugs are mainly targeting elderly asians from what is being reported everywhere

2016-10-03 00:11:49	voidead	>the world

2016-10-03 00:12:09	SeferYetzirah	us crime rates are at some of the lowest numers in decades
2016-10-03 00:12:09	cirkit	although San Francisco and surrounding cities are urban'ish so lots of hipsters
2016-10-03 00:12:15	SeferYetzirah	so i think you are exaggerating

2016-10-03 00:12:29	voidead	depends solely on the neighborhood SeferYetzirah 
2016-10-03 00:12:35	SeferYetzirah	indeed void it does
2016-10-03 00:12:42	SeferYetzirah	so its hard to generalize things like crime
2016-10-03 00:12:48	SeferYetzirah	maynbe specify where you live
2016-10-03 00:13:05	cirkit	I'm in California
2016-10-03 00:13:10	cirkit	places like Oakland are fucked up
2016-10-03 00:13:16	voidead	in Hattiesburg it was quite rough actually.. but I lived directly next to the university which was fairly safe because the cops patrolled 24/7 there but that town is pretty rough actually
2016-10-03 00:13:17	cirkit	it's like Detroit
2016-10-03 00:13:18	SeferYetzirah	oh damn son
2016-10-03 00:15:10	voidead	even though I lived in a gated community some of the niggers that lived there who pay rent with drug money brought their nigger friends over to party and shit started getting stolen.. so yeah

2016-10-05 12:35:16	sampson	even when i had arch on it, it was shitty because nothing worked right
2016-10-05 12:35:28	sampson	x was a pita to get going

2016-10-05 12:53:30	sampson	whats a vt switch
2016-10-05 12:56:06	haavard	So you have like, virtual terminals
2016-10-05 12:56:08	haavard	And shit
2016-10-05 12:56:39	haavard	And if you hit Ctrl-alt-capslock-right mouse button-clutch-Fn, you changge between them
2016-10-05 12:56:49	haavard	I can never remember the keyboard shortcut

2016-10-05 13:04:57	Max`P	Fi-F6 are usually text consoles, and F7 and above graphical consoles where the X server lives
2016-10-05 13:05:13	Max`P	Unless you startx from the console, in which case the graphical session starts on that same console.

2016-10-05 13:41:35	prg	yeah i know the guy that wrote it lol
2016-10-05 13:41:59	prg	he lives at my friend's house
2016-10-05 13:42:09	halfwit	Not sure why he's always a cunt to me, but
2016-10-05 13:42:17	prg	hahaha
2016-10-05 13:42:18	halfwit	I want nothing to do with him on IRC
2016-10-05 13:43:11	halfwit	Whatever though. Not gonna get along with everyone in the world.
2016-10-05 13:43:38	prg	that's hilarious to me; he is a polarizing person irl imo
2016-10-05 13:44:48	halfwit	Stick with X thouh
2016-10-05 13:44:50	prg	i remember getting drunk at my friend's house and i thought he was kind of a dick
2016-10-05 13:45:06	halfwit	Wayland is broken fundamentally for people who don't want to use a polished solution.
2016-10-05 13:45:16	prg	but i've chilled with him since and he's cool in my book; i mean i'm kind of a dick too we are all
2016-10-05 13:46:18	prg	i like the idea of wayland and hope it becomes great someday but i'm not keen on using it yet; especially without nvidia support
2016-10-05 13:46:31	prg	well i mean there's limited nvidia support atm
2016-10-05 13:47:11	prg	there's no functional reason to switch yet imo
2016-10-05 13:49:49	halfwit	It's certainly much more sane code, better in most ways; and more secure
2016-10-05 13:50:26	halfwit	unfortunately, the big DE's had their say, and bastardized the original vision
2016-10-05 13:50:52	prg	what do you mean by that?
2016-10-05 13:52:20	halfwit	Just that so much code has been changed to accomodate the Gnomes and KDE and such that it's very difficult for those that are using small systems, orbment and sway, say - to stay afloat in the maelstrom, as they're all single coder solutions. 
2016-10-05 13:53:19	prg	interesting
2016-10-05 13:54:23	prg	well fuck gnome and kde lol
2016-10-05 13:54:44	prg	unfortunately for widespead adoption gnome/kde is necessary tho
2016-10-05 13:54:48	halfwit	Luckily both Cloudef and SirCmpwn are good coders
2016-10-05 13:54:58	halfwit	But for people like me that want to play with Wayland, holy fuck no.
2016-10-05 13:56:18	prg	SirCmpwn is probably one of the better coders for their age that i've met irl
2016-10-05 13:56:18		[13:56]
2016-10-05 13:57:28	halfwit	Oh, what he's young?
2016-10-05 13:57:34	prg	idk i think he's my age
2016-10-05 13:57:39	halfwit	How old is that?
2016-10-05 13:57:39	prg	late 20s
2016-10-05 13:57:43	halfwit	That makes sense.
2016-10-05 13:58:12	prg	i live in new jersey too; so it's not like the place people typically go to for tech you know?
2016-10-05 13:58:25	halfwit	Heh. Better than here.
2016-10-05 13:58:46	prg	but i do know a lot of programmers in the area because there are jobs and whatever
2016-10-05 13:59:24	prg	it's crazy how many bad programmers there are lol
2016-10-05 13:59:47	halfwit	A healthy majority of them
2016-10-05 14:00:09	prg	the university near me churns out computer science graduates and has a fucking attrocious cs program
2016-10-05 14:00:53	prg	the "hardest" thing i ever had to do programming wise was implement a linked list in java
2016-10-05 14:01:52	prg	basically if you could do that programming wise and just put up with the other bullshit classes that you have to take you can get a cs degree at this uni
2016-10-05 14:02:56	halfwit	Sad
2016-10-05 14:03:05	halfwit	Lol, i'm glad that I know I'm shit still.

2016-10-05 14:03:29	halfwit	Because of this.
2016-10-05 14:05:53	halfwit	I can make anything I want, but I know it's not great code yet.
2016-10-05 14:09:41	prg	great code is subjective though
2016-10-05 14:10:58	halfwit	I guess.
2016-10-05 14:11:37	prg	i think it's more important to have your code be functional and focus on consistency then to strive for 'perfect' code

2016-10-05 14:13:02	prg	i'm really excited to get out of this contracting job so i can get out of the habits that public sector contracting implements
2016-10-05 14:13:05	halfwit	Lol. Yeah, anyways, the crap code out there is pretty easy to pick out. The best line in there is, you can't deny when code is effective
2016-10-05 14:13:37	prg	refactoring/improving code for the sake of improving it outside of the inital dev phase is discouraged due to the risks of possibly breaking things
2016-10-05 14:13:45	halfwit	Heh. Relaly.
2016-10-05 14:13:48	halfwit	Really *
2016-10-05 14:13:53	halfwit	You should get out of that job! 
2016-10-05 14:14:25	prg	well yeah; i quit a couple days ago
2016-10-05 14:14:45	prg	got a new gig :D gonna be working on embedded linux for routers
2016-10-05 14:14:51	halfwit	Very neat
2016-10-05 14:15:15	prg	not kernel specifically but just the router software in general that runs linux
2016-10-05 14:15:35	halfwit	I really should check out OBSD and friends, because I know i'm not comfortable putting Linux as my front line
2016-10-05 14:16:11	prg	why not?
2016-10-05 14:16:33	prg	my asus router runs linux out of the box
2016-10-05 14:22:00		[14:16]
2016-10-05 14:22:56	halfwit	Mhm, they do certainly. 
2016-10-05 14:28:00		[14:22]
2016-10-05 14:29:19	prg	referring to linux being a larger targer?

2016-10-05 14:35:00		[14:29]
2016-10-05 14:35:40	halfwit	Full disclosure, I defer on the matter to other people who have the expertise I lack :(
2016-10-05 14:36:57	halfwit	the guys I talk to in infosec are very adamant on the matter, and time and time again I've asked why, but fucked if I can remember outright what their reasoning was. 
2016-10-05 14:37:10	halfwit	They prefer OBSD mostly
2016-10-05 14:37:22	+Anna	neither for me
2016-10-05 14:38:05	Max`P	I think the reason is just the much smaller code base and that the whole kernel is heavily designed around safety
2016-10-05 14:39:12	prg	iirc there is also an official openBSD band which is cool too
2016-10-05 14:39:57	prg	oh i guess it's a bunch of contributions; but yeah it's kinda lol https://www.openbsd.org/lyrics.html

2016-10-05 14:40:08	halfwit	Lmfao
2016-10-05 14:40:12	halfwit	Worthwhile.
2016-10-05 14:40:39	halfwit	prg: sorry, I know it's a let down to have someone say, "Well someone else told me..."
2016-10-05 14:40:50	halfwit	prg: But I do trust their insight on the matter ;P
2016-10-05 14:41:11	prg	oh i understand; i just trying to get where you were coming from
2016-10-05 14:41:29	halfwit	It's my dirty little secret, I don't even know everything! 
2016-10-05 14:41:30	prg	if i were to run my own mail server or something like that i would stick it on openBSD
2016-10-05 14:41:59	prg	or any kind of server where i don't need the latest something and don't need linux specifically 
2016-10-05 14:42:58	prg	if you look at cve lists you'll see way more for linux than openBSD
2016-10-05 14:43:25	halfwit	Linux proper, not that many more. But if you're looking at a particular distro, hells yeah.
2016-10-05 14:43:51	prg	yeah some distros are security nightmares
2016-10-05 14:45:50	halfwit	Arch isn't bad.
2016-10-05 14:46:01	halfwit	Close to upstream certainly helps, they don't have to backport fixes
2016-10-05 14:46:20	prg	arch has the advantage of being a moving target and very quick updates direct from upstream
2016-10-05 14:47:05	prg	and being mainly vanilla is nice imo because no need to re-implement many "arch-specific" patches delaying the time before security updates come out
2016-10-05 14:47:05	halfwit	CentOS and all that, they have swathes of devs on it, so I mean that works well enough for thm
2016-10-05 14:47:33	prg	yeah it's crazy; redhat5 even has a very robust/secure kernel
2016-10-05 14:47:58	prg	it's 2.6.something but redhat constantly patches it
2016-10-05 14:48:11	prg	and rhel5 is oooooollllldd
2016-10-05 14:48:51	prg	but when you have that money enterprise customers paying you to support it; it's totally fesaible

2016-10-06 04:14:50	voidead	I haven't posted on Facebook in years
2016-10-06 04:15:06	skope	i post like once a year
2016-10-06 04:15:18	skope	why is it once a year but it's an year?
2016-10-06 04:15:23	skope	is it like that
2016-10-06 04:16:09	MHD	what do u mean 'an year'
2016-10-06 04:16:25	skope	is it
2016-10-06 04:16:30	skope	"an year" instead of "a year"
2016-10-06 04:16:38	skope	if you reference it in some other situation
2016-10-06 04:16:43	skope	context*
2016-10-06 04:22:00		[04:16]
2016-10-06 04:23:12	prg	i can't think of a context where you would use an year
2016-10-06 04:23:17	skope	okay
2016-10-06 04:24:00	skope	shouldn't you use an if the word starts with a vowel
2016-10-06 04:24:10	skope	ah, vowel sound
2016-10-06 04:24:17	skope	that's fucking logical
2016-10-06 04:25:23	voidead	actually
2016-10-06 04:25:34	voidead	it depends on whether its a uncountable noun or not
2016-10-06 04:25:40	skope	oh?
2016-10-06 04:25:42	voidead	you can count years though
2016-10-06 04:25:43	skope	damn that's, good to know
2016-10-06 04:25:45	skope	yeah
2016-10-06 04:25:47	voidead	2 years 3 years
2016-10-06 04:25:50	voidead	etc..
2016-10-06 04:26:30	voidead	but ultimately
2016-10-06 04:26:40	voidead	because year starts with a y.. consonant
2016-10-06 04:26:44	voidead	a is the correct use
2016-10-06 04:30:45	SeferYetzirah	yup
2016-10-06 04:34:25	skope	isn't y vowel
2016-10-06 04:35:15	skope	In the English writing system it sometimes represents a vowel and sometimes a consonant.
2016-10-06 04:35:18	skope	;SDD;D
2016-10-06 04:38:29	SeferYetzirah	why would
2016-10-06 04:38:29		[04:38]
2016-10-06 04:38:39	SeferYetzirah	does any word contain
2016-10-06 04:38:43	SeferYetzirah	3 vowels in a row
2016-10-06 04:38:55	SeferYetzirah	y at the start or end of a word has a consonant poositon
2016-10-06 04:39:14	SeferYetzirah	y is so rarely a vowel
2016-10-06 04:39:33	SeferYetzirah	like, daily word use, you might use a word  but porlly not
2016-10-06 04:40:33	skope	yeah
2016-10-06 04:40:41	skope	in finnish it's always vowel so it confused me
2016-10-06 04:41:00	voidead	ah yeah
2016-10-06 04:41:04	voidead	makes sense

2016-10-06 08:18:39	Max`P	Agreed. Warnings as errors is ok when developing, but definitely should be turned off for releases
2016-10-06 08:18:52	Max`P	and holy shit if you need Debian oldstable that's really old
2016-10-06 08:19:18	haavard	I'm on jessie now, and it's not building.. dunno how old this particular version is
2016-10-06 08:19:45	haavard	We're supposed to use "3.13" because that's what some other stuff is tested with, but I'm very tempted to just roll the latest and see where it goes

2016-10-06 09:08:34	Max`P	Not sure if I should get an FPGA or an oscilloscope first. Technically I could make an oscilloscope with the FPGA, but then I'd have no tools to debug the FPGA to make said oscilloscope

2016-10-06 09:17:21	Max`P	It's kind of specialized hardware. Basically, it's kind of a CPU, but instead of reading computer codes, you actually program the chip itself.

2016-10-06 10:33:19	haavard	Yeah tell me about it
2016-10-06 10:33:25	haavard	Trying to get ns3 working
2016-10-06 10:33:31	+Anna	so anyways.. thats why it won't even work out little all winter, end up encountering it very simple
2016-10-06 10:33:40	haavard	Taking a nap in the library waiting for it to compile and some asshole slams the desk waking me up
2016-10-06 10:39:00		[10:33]
2016-10-06 10:41:17	Max`P	Oh great, just caught the user not following instructions
2016-10-06 10:47:00		[10:41]
2016-10-06 10:49:41	haavard	"Many of the standard C++ library include files have been edited to no longer include <unistd.h>"
2016-10-06 10:49:46	haavard	So this is why it doesn't work
2016-10-06 10:50:14	haavard	I wish I had something to punch right now
2016-10-06 10:50:31	Max`P	Ah, software built like ass as usual.
2016-10-06 10:51:03	Max`P	You'd think a fucking SCHOOL would write about perfect programs, you know, to show the example to the students.
2016-10-06 10:51:06	haavard	I'll tattoo "include what you use" on their asscheeks
2016-10-06 10:51:37	haavard	Max`P: this isn't school code, it's a library or framework or something that builds on top of this network simulator
2016-10-06 10:51:39	haavard	I don't even kno
2016-10-06 10:52:09	haavard	Still, your point stands, any code that is ever handed out as part of an assignment, at least at my home university, is atrocious
2016-10-06 10:53:30	haavard	Even oldstable uses gcc 4.7 (which includes the above change to C++ headers)
2016-10-06 10:53:38	haavard	How the fuck am I supposed to get this working?
2016-10-06 10:54:28	Max`P	You may have to install something like Debian Lenny or something
2016-10-06 10:54:51	Max`P	Basically a distro that was mainstream in the era the software was made

2016-10-06 11:15:38	Max`P	I just learned that our ticketing system, Zendesk, costs freakin' $125/mo PER ACCOUNT. We have 40 accounts, so that's $5000/mo just for a ticket system, or $60000 for the whole year 
2016-10-06 11:16:01	Max`P	We're paying this bullshit pretty much DOUBLE my salary and it goes down weekly. That's pure horseshit
2016-10-06 11:19:04	haavard	lmao

2016-10-06 11:21:52	Max`P	They keep having slowdowns and shit, but for fucks sake a dedi costs $42, and VPSes are even cheaper. Throw each client on their individual VPS, there, super reliable.
2016-10-06 11:24:21	haavard	A guy on my team claims he got it working
2016-10-06 11:24:25	haavard	I don't believe him

2016-10-07 09:26:19	voidead	no.. no it isn't
2016-10-07 09:26:22	voidead	at all
2016-10-07 09:26:24	sampson	exactly
2016-10-07 09:26:33	sampson	drugs are drugs
2016-10-07 09:26:40	voidead	not necessarily
2016-10-07 09:26:50	sampson	coffee probably has more of a noticable effect than microdosing lsd
2016-10-07 09:27:03	sampson	hes basically using it like a medication
2016-10-07 09:27:08	voidead	uh.. have you ever microdosed on lsd at work?
2016-10-07 09:27:23	sampson	its a micro does
2016-10-07 09:27:27	cirkit	LSD ain't shit 
2016-10-07 09:27:30	sampson	its not a whole dose

2016-10-07 09:27:34	sampson	hes not tripping balls
2016-10-07 09:27:49	sampson	its negligible
2016-10-07 09:28:01	voidead	I mean.. I can microdose on meth too and be perfectly fine right?

2016-10-07 09:28:34	voidead	I think its pretty stupid to say.. oh you know.. caffeine and LSD are the same thing
2016-10-07 09:29:04	sampson	i think youre misunderstanding what a microdose is though
2016-10-07 09:29:17	sampson	a cup of coffee will have more of an effect
2016-10-07 09:29:18	voidead	I think you are trying to make a biased point
2016-10-07 09:29:31	voidead	because.. coffee isn't LSD.. microdosing or not
2016-10-07 09:29:41	sampson	lsd is safer than coffee
2016-10-07 09:29:51	cirkit	I'm guilty of injecting marijuana
2016-10-07 09:29:53	cirkit	DON'T TELL THE NSA!!!!
2016-10-07 09:30:20	sampson	mushrooms are safer than coffee
2016-10-07 09:30:35	voidead	thats quite one sided
2016-10-07 09:31:01	sampson	just science
2016-10-07 09:31:05	cirkit	take 5 GRAMS of SHROOMZ and enjoy one hell of a cartoon
2016-10-07 09:31:37	voidead	nah thats just being ridiculous.. coffee is in fact much safer than all of that bullshit
2016-10-07 09:31:58	sampson	heh
2016-10-07 09:32:01	sampson	look it up
2016-10-07 09:32:06	sampson	check the ld50

2016-10-07 09:32:27	voidead	yeah I'll go look it up on some biased bullshit website with false information
2016-10-07 09:33:19	sampson	you can do the math
2016-10-07 09:33:27	sampson	if you think math is biased...
2016-10-07 09:33:32	sampson	i dont know what to tell youy
2016-10-07 09:35:58	voidead	anyways the point I made before and the point I'll make again.. people _always_ defend the drugs like its the last god damn thing they will do with their life before they die
2016-10-07 09:36:04	voidead	I mean god damn.. 
2016-10-07 09:36:18	voidead	I'll just microdose on meth and heroine
2016-10-07 09:36:32	sampson	meth and heroine wont open up that third eye
2016-10-07 09:36:32	voidead	and say "ah you know.. its all safe.. I can do my job!.. fuck you!"
2016-10-07 09:36:40	sampson	its all about mind expansion
2016-10-07 09:37:34	voidead	_all_ drugs are the same too.. meth, heroine, LSD.. I can do all of them and be perfectly fine!
2016-10-07 09:38:15	voidead	lets go look up some bullshit on this wasted faggot's website that disproves you 
2016-10-07 09:38:21	voidead	because.. fuck the system!
2016-10-07 09:38:22	sampson	obviously not, some drugs will kill you and have harmful side effects, others less so
2016-10-07 09:38:35	sampson	science is fake and the moon is a hologram

2016-10-07 09:38:45	sampson	the earth is flat
2016-10-07 09:39:07	voidead	sampson› and thats my point.. obviously.. you know.. hell I'll even admit smoking weed at work is perfectly fine compared to LSD
2016-10-07 09:39:27	sampson	right but hes not taking lsd to trip
2016-10-07 09:39:30	sampson	hes not getting high
2016-10-07 09:39:37	sampson	hes *microdosing*
2016-10-07 09:39:41	sampson	there is no notiable effect
2016-10-07 09:39:48	voidead	then why the fuck is he doing it in the first place if he isn't going to get wasted
2016-10-07 09:40:24	sampson	because like i said, hes using it responibly, like medication in a sense.. hes taking extremely small amounts
2016-10-07 09:40:25	prg	i really don't know enough about microdosing to really call that tbh; i can see potential for lots of fail though
2016-10-07 09:40:29	sampson	micro amounts even
2016-10-07 09:41:02	voidead	the bottom line is.. I mean.. who the fuck call themselves a professional and does shit like that?
2016-10-07 09:41:04	sampson	you dont have to go bat shit crazy with every drug and trip fucking balls
2016-10-07 09:41:09	voidead	he is obviously an idiot
2016-10-07 09:41:12	sampson	only crackheads do shit like that

2016-10-07 12:41:59	sampson	why do people prefer weechat over mirc in wine?
2016-10-07 12:41:59		[12:41]
2016-10-07 12:42:04	sampson	I DONT UNDERSTAND
2016-10-07 12:42:59	Max`P	sampson: well, running _anything_ in wine I'd consider absolute last ressort, even if the native options are slightly inferior
2016-10-07 12:43:41	alyptik	yeah
2016-10-07 12:43:55	alyptik	weechat in wine y tho
2016-10-07 12:43:59	alyptik	that is ridiculous
2016-10-07 12:45:39	sampson	but mirc is raaaaad
2016-10-07 12:51:00		[12:45]
2016-10-07 14:18:28	prg	weechat is open source; plugins are sweet; relay is awesome and supports SSL; i can leave weechat running on a box in tmux and attach to it whenever (don't need a bouncer); and there are scripting interfaces for a ton of languages so you can extend it how you want to
2016-10-07 14:18:29		[14:18]
2016-10-07 14:18:46	prg	and its free as in beer
2016-10-07 14:19:27	alyptik	but why not just do it out of wine?
2016-10-07 14:19:33	alyptik	speaking as someone who loves weechat
2016-10-07 14:19:55	prg	why would i run weechat in wine?
2016-10-07 14:20:35	prg	oh is sampson making the comparison of weechat in wine vs mirc in wine? i thought he was saying weechat vs mirc in wine
2016-10-07 14:21:31	alyptik	oh wait weechat likely has no windows version
2016-10-07 14:21:36	alyptik	nevermind heh
2016-10-07 14:24:14	prg	you can probs build it for cygwin

2016-10-08 06:22:18	voidead	well.. its a requirement anyways

2016-10-08 06:25:47	voidead	that isn't true.. in fact.. I'm quite sure your English isn't that good
2016-10-08 06:25:55	voidead	compared to many Koreans I know
2016-10-08 06:26:00	pickfire	Wait, there is a but.
2016-10-08 06:26:41	pickfire	But the younger generations in korea speaks a lot better from what I heard.
2016-10-08 06:26:58	pickfire	I mean their english is better than the older generatins.
2016-10-08 06:28:04	voidead	well every culture is the same in that regard
2016-10-08 06:28:04		[06:28]
2016-10-08 06:28:19	pickfire	Yup
2016-10-08 06:28:20	voidead	the older generations in any culture speak their own language better
2016-10-08 06:28:28	voidead	the new generations all have to speak English
2016-10-08 06:28:30	voidead	as its required

2016-10-08 06:28:53	+Anna	I think "nigger" should be used as the important part of some shit.. i just talk to us

2016-10-08 06:29:27	pickfire	now*
2016-10-08 06:30:10	voidead	also there is the idea of old languages becoming extinct due to urbanization.. which is actually very true for Singapore and probably for Malaysia too
2016-10-08 06:30:34	voidead	so many cultures are trying to preserve the languages.. but the people who still speak them are dying
2016-10-08 06:31:29	pickfire	I don't mean something like that.
2016-10-08 06:31:36	pickfire	They do speak chinese though.
2016-10-08 06:31:44	pickfire	I mean they prioritize english.
2016-10-08 06:31:57	pickfire	Some malaysians did the same thing.
2016-10-08 06:32:15	pickfire	And I find them bad.
2016-10-08 06:33:10	 *	pickfire feel like those "banana"s is a bit strange, like they are not from this country
2016-10-08 06:33:31	pickfire	"banana" refer to those chinese that doesn't speak chinese. (not 100% though)
2016-10-08 06:33:48	voidead	ah yeah

2016-10-08 06:33:54	pickfire	My father can be considered one, he can only write his own chinese name but he speaks chinese badly.
2016-10-08 06:33:55	voidead	in fact
2016-10-08 06:34:13	voidead	Hong Kong is a good example of English destroying the native Chinese speaking
2016-10-08 06:34:16	pickfire	Well, he speaks cantonese a lot better than mandarin
2016-10-08 06:34:38	pickfire	voidead: nope, the situation isn't so
2016-10-08 06:34:54	voidead	well English is very important in Hong Kong
2016-10-08 06:35:04	pickfire	In Chinese, there are many dialects and two different writing style.
2016-10-08 06:35:13	pickfire	Let me talk about dialects first.
2016-10-08 06:35:17	voidead	everyone has to speak English.. thats what I heard from this Hong Kong businessman

2016-10-08 06:36:09	voidead	ah
2016-10-08 06:36:11	pickfire	I can also understand some hokien
2016-10-08 06:36:57	pickfire	mandarin is like a standard that has been around for quite some time (100+ years)
2016-10-08 06:37:29	pickfire	cantonese is one of the dialect that most people from guang zhou, hong kong speak
2016-10-08 06:37:53	pickfire	Well, most of us (in my area) who speak mandarin knows cantonese as well.
2016-10-08 06:38:55	pickfire	But in penang and singapore is different, they speak mostly hokien dialect which most used by fu zhou
2016-10-08 06:38:58	cirkit	[11:28:53]<+Anna> I think "nigger" should be used as the important part of some shit.. i just talk to us

2016-10-08 06:44:38	voidead	pickfire› I just read the example configuration
2016-10-08 06:44:45	voidead	its pretty clear
2016-10-08 06:44:47	pickfire	Now, in modern china they created simplified chinese since the traditional chinese is hard to write
2016-10-08 06:44:53	voidead	but still it is confusing I'll admit pickfire 
2016-10-08 06:44:57	pickfire	But it was still used by taiwan and hong kong

2016-10-08 06:46:35	pickfire	Not sure
2016-10-08 06:47:02	pickfire	Why are singaporeans ignorant? I think it's because back then it was RM1:SGD1, now RM3:SGD1

2016-10-08 06:47:34	pickfire	T_T that singapore split from malaysia
2016-10-08 06:47:48	voidead	cirkit› I had to use it because.. the only way to get internet where I was.. was through this shitty verizon usb modem card.. but.. my laptop is the only thing that could pick up the signal.. so I used my laptop as a "router" of sorts using dnsmasq and so my laptop picked up the internet signal and sent it via LAN to my desktop.. very very strange setup

2016-10-08 06:50:40	voidead	I was literally putting my laptop somewhere on the other side of the house.. and it picked up the cell tower.. then it took the signal and sent it to my LAN router via _wifi_ lol not even ethernet.. and then my desktop was connected to the router via ethernet

2016-10-08 20:40:24	bridgesfreezefirst	btw this "October Surprise" is anything but
2016-10-08 20:40:33	Max`P	haavard: think I heard of it yeah. Would be pretty cool
2016-10-08 20:40:54	Max`P	I assume the open-sourcing of .NET helps a lot for that
2016-10-08 20:40:59	MHD	hey bridges
2016-10-08 20:41:04	voidead	surprise?
2016-10-08 20:41:05	bridgesfreezefirst	Trump is a lecherous scumbag, and Hillary is a too of the big banks and law firms
2016-10-08 20:41:09	bridgesfreezefirst	tool*
2016-10-08 20:41:13	voidead	lol yeah
2016-10-08 20:41:16	bridgesfreezefirst	this changes NOTHING
2016-10-08 20:41:24	bridgesfreezefirst	hi MHD 
2016-10-08 20:41:31	haavard	I don't think it's relayed to the open-sourcing actually, Max`P.. it's just a rewrite that uses OpenGL instead of whatever Windows-only framework it uses now
2016-10-08 20:41:35	voidead	bridgesfreezefirst› Alex Jones 2016.. GOD ALMIGHTY
2016-10-08 20:41:37	+Anna	but really I'm very tempted to just keep yourself inspired to keep me going
2016-10-08 20:42:00	bridgesfreezefirst	yes, thanks Anna 
2016-10-08 20:42:07	Max`P	haavard: didn't it have OpenGL support since like, a long time ago?
2016-10-08 20:42:08	bridgesfreezefirst	that's exactly what Trump said
2016-10-08 20:42:29	Max`P	Thr DirectX version always worked better even in Wine but it's always been there for me
2016-10-08 20:42:30	voidead	lol
2016-10-08 20:43:13	bridgesfreezefirst	new title "come to #thevoid for a combination of boring tech talk and gross sexual humor"

2016-10-08 20:43:57	bridgesfreezefirst	lol thank you
2016-10-08 20:44:04	haavard	Max`P: hmm I think you're right.. 
2016-10-08 20:44:15	voidead	bridgesfreezefirst› man that video of trump talking shit was hilarious
2016-10-08 20:44:30	voidead	GRAB HER RIGHT IN THE PUSSY
2016-10-08 20:44:33	haavard	Well anyway, there's *something* that changed in the new thing that made it possible with a Linux/macOS version
2016-10-08 20:45:19	Max`P	I'm fairly sure it was a problem with Mono back in the days
2016-10-08 20:46:41	Max`P	I know ppy mentionned a lot of C# issues back in the days even on Windows
2016-10-08 20:46:47	cirkit	$ ./check_openvpn_clients
2016-10-08 20:46:47	cirkit	OK: 2 OpenVPN Client Connections

2016-10-08 20:47:34	voidead	cirkit› lol
2016-10-08 20:47:34		[20:47]
2016-10-08 20:47:55	bridgesfreezefirst	loooooooooool
2016-10-08 20:48:04	voidead	bridgesfreezefirst› reminds me of Phil Anselmo's heroin monologue
2016-10-08 20:48:09	Max`P	fucking piece of shit AP
2016-10-08 20:48:27	bridgesfreezefirst	Phil Anselmo has said a lot of really dumb shit over the years
2016-10-08 20:48:36	bridgesfreezefirst	Trump should have picked him as his running mate
2016-10-08 20:49:05	voidead	"wake up with a vengeance.. call someone about fixing some rotten wood on the front porch.. do two bags.. smoke break"
2016-10-08 20:49:21	haavard	Max`P: there's also the fact that peppy didn't want to prioritize Linux and macOS, but since the new version is open source that helps a lot
2016-10-08 20:49:22	bridgesfreezefirst	seriously though that video is disturbing as fuck
2016-10-08 20:49:34	voidead	bridgesfreezefirst› which one?
2016-10-08 20:49:46	bridgesfreezefirst	the Phil Anselmo one, talking about heroin
2016-10-08 20:50:14	voidead	yeah
2016-10-08 20:50:22	voidead	he says it like it is
2016-10-08 20:50:42	cirkit	bridgesfreezefirst: the elite are now trying to ruin Trump's image over political correctness so the only unfortunate option left is Clinton
2016-10-08 20:51:14	bridgesfreezefirst	Trump doesn't have any image to ruin though, everyone knows he's a pig
2016-10-08 20:51:37	bridgesfreezefirst	Clinton is a tool of the big banks and law firms, which everyone also knows
2016-10-08 20:51:40	bridgesfreezefirst	so it's a wash
2016-10-08 20:51:53	bridgesfreezefirst	all this stuff being leaked is ultimately meaningless
2016-10-08 20:52:59	voidead	its all decided by the electoral college anyways
2016-10-08 20:53:07	voidead	the people have no voice
2016-10-08 20:55:10	bridgesfreezefirst	it's indirect democracy
