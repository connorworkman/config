2016-09-15 06:35:27	halfwit	Heh, neat 
2016-09-15 06:35:47	skope	why flac
2016-09-15 06:38:59	voidead	skope› why not?
2016-09-15 06:39:28	voidead	jerring› also why did they record the conversation?
2016-09-15 06:39:43	skope	seems pretty overpower for cassette recording
2016-09-15 06:40:06	halfwit	When my mom was alive, we got a videocamera and just recorded her chatting at the table 
2016-09-15 06:40:18	skope	you still have the recording?
2016-09-15 06:40:21	halfwit	It's on a VHS somewhere, but no one has a fucking VCR anymore
2016-09-15 06:40:25	skope	i have
2016-09-15 06:40:32	skope	and i have lots of vhs cassettes
2016-09-15 06:40:35	halfwit	Nice
2016-09-15 06:40:38	jerring	i dont know, i figured id use the best quality for everything, its a super shitting recording, not sure who or why they were recording it
2016-09-15 06:40:55	skope	yeah, you can't improve the quality by processing it to flac
2016-09-15 06:41:03	skope	it just takes disk space unnecessarily
2016-09-15 06:41:11	skope	but on the other hand, it's just one recording
2016-09-15 06:41:15	skope	so it doesn't matter
2016-09-15 06:41:21	skope	i wish i'd have some recordings of my dad
2016-09-15 06:41:28	skope	would be nice to hear his voice again
2016-09-15 06:42:38	voidead	I'm glad my cousin has a lot of recordings of his guitar and voice etc..

2016-09-15 06:44:05	skope	pillu means pussy in finnish
2016-09-15 06:47:01	jerring	what difference does it make if its flac or mp3 or wav though
2016-09-15 06:47:01		[06:47]
2016-09-15 06:47:05	jerring	why not use flac
2016-09-15 06:48:20	skope	space when you got lots of files
2016-09-15 06:50:07	jerring	fucking around with audacity and the effects
2016-09-15 06:50:18	voidead	jerring› all I have to say about that is.. if you have a .wav file then convert it to .flac as its the same quality but .wav is a shitty format
2016-09-15 06:50:55	voidead	converting .wav or .flac to .mp3 doesn't make sense unless you are trying to save space as skope put it
2016-09-15 06:51:00	voidead	even then you lose quality
2016-09-15 06:52:20	Max`P	wav<>flac not, mp3/ogg/aac yes
2016-09-15 06:53:27	skope	but when the source is bad, you don't lose that much quality
2016-09-15 06:53:33	skope	with mp3 etc converting
2016-09-15 06:53:39	voidead	yeah if the source is bad.. its bad regardless
2016-09-15 06:53:49	voidead	you can't add data if it isn't there
2016-09-15 06:53:51	skope	afaik it just cuts out some frequencies which are not in there in this case
2016-09-15 06:54:25	voidead	the main reason I converted all my .wav files to .flac was because mpd doesn't play .wav files
2016-09-15 06:54:36	skope	it doesn't?
2016-09-15 06:54:39	skope	whoa
2016-09-15 06:54:48	voidead	skope› well it _did_
2016-09-15 06:54:56	voidead	and a new update made it so it didn't anymore
2016-09-15 06:54:58	voidead	either way
2016-09-15 06:55:00	voidead	fuck wav
2016-09-15 06:55:10	skope	wat :D
2016-09-15 06:55:40	voidead	cmus will play .wav though
2016-09-15 06:55:45	voidead	but I prefer mpd

2016-09-15 06:59:32	voidead	ncmpcpp is merely the frontend for mpd

2016-09-15 07:53:28	cirkit	did some update remove certain fonts ST depended on?

2016-09-15 07:53:56	cirkit	well glad it's working for you now
2016-09-15 07:54:00	voidead	probably a bunch of bullshit fonts in that directory that needed to be removed
2016-09-15 07:54:14	voidead	yeah seriousl
2016-09-15 07:54:17	voidead	seriously*
2016-09-15 07:54:21	voidead	I was losing my fucking mind
2016-09-15 07:55:00	voidead	I thought it had something to do with the code or fontconfig.. all sorts of shit
2016-09-15 07:55:28	voidead	but when my laptop is working fine and my desktop isn't.. then I just thought.. well it must be related to the fonts on my laptop
2016-09-15 07:55:37	voidead	which both computers use the same fonts
2016-09-15 07:55:46	voidead	so I have no idea why it wasn't working in the first place lol
2016-09-15 07:55:53	voidead	anyways
2016-09-15 07:56:06	voidead	I completely removed the directory and synced my laptop's directory to it
2016-09-15 07:56:09	voidead	and bam it works
2016-09-15 07:56:46	cirkit	that is just weird...were any fonts removed from the desktop prior to ST acting up?
2016-09-15 07:57:04	voidead	not really nah
2016-09-15 07:57:13	cirkit	hmm
2016-09-15 07:57:14	voidead	everything was exactly the same as it was when ST was working

2016-09-15 08:42:32	cirkit	voidead: why would a professor go to prison for having sex with students? I mean, if the students are of legal age and all..
2016-09-15 08:43:24	voidead	cirkit› no lie.. my professor said he found some panties laying in one of the chairs in the classroom.. and he saw it while giving a lecture.. he said he immediately says "and that is how we..... there are some pink panties laying in this chair hmmm... thats how we get the raster data for the map" he didn't even react lol
2016-09-15 08:43:51	cirkit	goddamn lolol
2016-09-15 08:44:25	voidead	cirkit› well its against the law for a professor to have sex with a student

2016-09-16 16:57:12	voidead	apparently
2016-09-16 16:57:19	voidead	even after changing my fontconfig
2016-09-16 16:57:30	voidead	nothing affects the Korean and Japanese fonts displayed
2016-09-16 16:57:49	voidead	only termite changes lol
2016-09-16 16:58:00	voidead	termite has consistently been my go to terminal
2016-09-16 16:58:04	voidead	so it will stay that way
2016-09-16 16:58:29	alyptik	voidead: first world problems brother
2016-09-16 16:58:31	alyptik	you and me both
2016-09-16 16:58:35	voidead	yeah lol
2016-09-16 16:58:56	voidead	its whatever.. I just wanted to fix whatever was fucked up honestly I don't really even care about the terminal lol
2016-09-16 16:59:27	voidead	"it's broken... GOD DAMMIT" "*fixed*.. ok I'll never use that application again"

2016-09-16 17:01:37	voidead	this is funny.. because Seoul's subway system is extremely efficient and not that complicated
2016-09-16 17:03:33	voidead	also.. my cousin is an idiot
2016-09-16 17:03:46	voidead	so she assumes that because I teach English
2016-09-16 17:04:15	voidead	I can you know.. somehow teach her kids because they are being homeschooled.. like.. teach them remotely here in Korea
2016-09-16 17:04:23	voidead	she must be out of her fucking mind
2016-09-16 17:04:38	alyptik	voidead: charge her like 100 bucks/hour
2016-09-16 17:05:01	voidead	I'm teaching Korean kids a _second_ language and helping them with understanding two different languages.. I'm not teaching native English kids
2016-09-16 17:05:49	voidead	alyptik› get this.. she said "call me at ***-***-**** I really need your help with some grammar questions" LOL
2016-09-16 17:06:12	voidead	I'm going to call her from Seoul Korea on my regular phone?
2016-09-16 17:06:16	voidead	god damn she is stupid
2016-09-16 17:06:31	voidead	I haven't called anyone from my regular phone yet
2016-09-16 17:06:41	voidead	I use the internet for voice calls and shit
2016-09-16 17:06:48	alyptik	rofl wow
2016-09-16 17:06:52	voidead	it would be extremely expensive to call someone that far away
2016-09-16 17:07:08	voidead	this is on Facebook too.. so I just ignore it lol
2016-09-16 17:07:16	voidead	she can keep messaging me all she wants I won't answer
2016-09-16 17:08:52	voidead	even after telling this bitch at least twice.. she still doesn't understand that _anything_ she already knows about English I also know.. in order to teach her kids she needs to actually go to school and learn some advanced concepts in English in order for her teaching to be effective for her kids
2016-09-16 17:08:57	voidead	thats my suggestion to her
2016-09-16 17:08:58	voidead	but nah.. 
2016-09-16 17:09:31	voidead	the kids I teach are just trying to comprehend a new language 
2016-09-16 17:09:42	voidead	they haven't even learned much of their own language yet
2016-09-16 17:09:43	+Anna	a lot of fucking crap
2016-09-16 17:11:24	voidead	so like.. asking me about some "grammar questions" is dumb as she should already be able to answer them
2016-09-16 17:11:38	voidead	unless she failed English
2016-09-16 17:12:23	voidead	I think what killed me was when she puts her cellphone number down and is like "hey when you get a chance call me at this number"

2016-09-16 17:15:59	voidead	I'm going to ignore her and see how angry and desperate she gets.. and if she still doesn't get it I'll finally say something lol
2016-09-16 17:16:50	voidead	she can you know.. hire a tutor... or refresh herself on some English concepts etc.. its not that fucking hard god damn she is teaching her own kids at home.. she has plenty of time to figure that shit out
2016-09-16 17:16:58	alyptik	any idea why tmux sends  ^[[1;5Q while it should be ^[[12^
2016-09-16 17:17:04	voidead	her husband works so she doesn't have anything to do during the day
2016-09-16 17:17:04	alyptik	for ^F2
2016-09-16 17:17:15	voidead	alyptik› probably $TERM issue

2016-09-16 17:17:19	voidead	issues*
2016-09-16 17:18:21	alyptik	happens with xterm, screen, and tmux
2016-09-16 17:18:22	alyptik	QQ
2016-09-16 17:18:24	voidead	alyptik› I think she doesn't send her kids to school not because she is against it.. she just wants to save money because public schools in that area suck ass and private schools are _way_ too expensive.. so that makes sense but if you are going to homeschool your kids you better have your shit together
2016-09-16 17:18:40	voidead	alyptik› yeah but tmux uses its own $TERM regardless
2016-09-16 17:18:47	alyptik	oh shit

2016-09-16 17:26:27	voidead	but like my VPS.. I had to do that
2016-09-16 17:27:00	voidead	some computers don't have the terminal installed and don't have the terminfo
2016-09-16 17:27:13	voidead	so you have to just install the term info
