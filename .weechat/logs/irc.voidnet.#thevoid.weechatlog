2016-09-15 06:35:27	halfwit	Heh, neat 
2016-09-15 06:35:47	skope	why flac
2016-09-15 06:38:59	voidead	skope› why not?
2016-09-15 06:39:28	voidead	jerring› also why did they record the conversation?
2016-09-15 06:39:43	skope	seems pretty overpower for cassette recording
2016-09-15 06:40:06	halfwit	When my mom was alive, we got a videocamera and just recorded her chatting at the table 
2016-09-15 06:40:18	skope	you still have the recording?
2016-09-15 06:40:21	halfwit	It's on a VHS somewhere, but no one has a fucking VCR anymore
2016-09-15 06:40:25	skope	i have
2016-09-15 06:40:32	skope	and i have lots of vhs cassettes
2016-09-15 06:40:35	halfwit	Nice
2016-09-15 06:40:38	jerring	i dont know, i figured id use the best quality for everything, its a super shitting recording, not sure who or why they were recording it
2016-09-15 06:40:55	skope	yeah, you can't improve the quality by processing it to flac
2016-09-15 06:41:03	skope	it just takes disk space unnecessarily
2016-09-15 06:41:11	skope	but on the other hand, it's just one recording
2016-09-15 06:41:15	skope	so it doesn't matter
2016-09-15 06:41:21	skope	i wish i'd have some recordings of my dad
2016-09-15 06:41:28	skope	would be nice to hear his voice again
2016-09-15 06:42:38	voidead	I'm glad my cousin has a lot of recordings of his guitar and voice etc..

2016-09-15 06:44:05	skope	pillu means pussy in finnish
2016-09-15 06:47:01	jerring	what difference does it make if its flac or mp3 or wav though
2016-09-15 06:47:01		[06:47]
2016-09-15 06:47:05	jerring	why not use flac
2016-09-15 06:48:20	skope	space when you got lots of files
2016-09-15 06:50:07	jerring	fucking around with audacity and the effects
2016-09-15 06:50:18	voidead	jerring› all I have to say about that is.. if you have a .wav file then convert it to .flac as its the same quality but .wav is a shitty format
2016-09-15 06:50:55	voidead	converting .wav or .flac to .mp3 doesn't make sense unless you are trying to save space as skope put it
2016-09-15 06:51:00	voidead	even then you lose quality
2016-09-15 06:52:20	Max`P	wav<>flac not, mp3/ogg/aac yes
2016-09-15 06:53:27	skope	but when the source is bad, you don't lose that much quality
2016-09-15 06:53:33	skope	with mp3 etc converting
2016-09-15 06:53:39	voidead	yeah if the source is bad.. its bad regardless
2016-09-15 06:53:49	voidead	you can't add data if it isn't there
2016-09-15 06:53:51	skope	afaik it just cuts out some frequencies which are not in there in this case
2016-09-15 06:54:25	voidead	the main reason I converted all my .wav files to .flac was because mpd doesn't play .wav files
2016-09-15 06:54:36	skope	it doesn't?
2016-09-15 06:54:39	skope	whoa
2016-09-15 06:54:48	voidead	skope› well it _did_
2016-09-15 06:54:56	voidead	and a new update made it so it didn't anymore
2016-09-15 06:54:58	voidead	either way
2016-09-15 06:55:00	voidead	fuck wav
2016-09-15 06:55:10	skope	wat :D
2016-09-15 06:55:40	voidead	cmus will play .wav though
2016-09-15 06:55:45	voidead	but I prefer mpd

2016-09-15 06:59:32	voidead	ncmpcpp is merely the frontend for mpd

2016-09-15 07:53:28	cirkit	did some update remove certain fonts ST depended on?

2016-09-15 07:53:56	cirkit	well glad it's working for you now
2016-09-15 07:54:00	voidead	probably a bunch of bullshit fonts in that directory that needed to be removed
2016-09-15 07:54:14	voidead	yeah seriousl
2016-09-15 07:54:17	voidead	seriously*
2016-09-15 07:54:21	voidead	I was losing my fucking mind
2016-09-15 07:55:00	voidead	I thought it had something to do with the code or fontconfig.. all sorts of shit
2016-09-15 07:55:28	voidead	but when my laptop is working fine and my desktop isn't.. then I just thought.. well it must be related to the fonts on my laptop
2016-09-15 07:55:37	voidead	which both computers use the same fonts
2016-09-15 07:55:46	voidead	so I have no idea why it wasn't working in the first place lol
2016-09-15 07:55:53	voidead	anyways
2016-09-15 07:56:06	voidead	I completely removed the directory and synced my laptop's directory to it
2016-09-15 07:56:09	voidead	and bam it works
2016-09-15 07:56:46	cirkit	that is just weird...were any fonts removed from the desktop prior to ST acting up?
2016-09-15 07:57:04	voidead	not really nah
2016-09-15 07:57:13	cirkit	hmm
2016-09-15 07:57:14	voidead	everything was exactly the same as it was when ST was working

2016-09-15 08:42:32	cirkit	voidead: why would a professor go to prison for having sex with students? I mean, if the students are of legal age and all..
2016-09-15 08:43:24	voidead	cirkit› no lie.. my professor said he found some panties laying in one of the chairs in the classroom.. and he saw it while giving a lecture.. he said he immediately says "and that is how we..... there are some pink panties laying in this chair hmmm... thats how we get the raster data for the map" he didn't even react lol
2016-09-15 08:43:51	cirkit	goddamn lolol
2016-09-15 08:44:25	voidead	cirkit› well its against the law for a professor to have sex with a student

2016-09-16 16:57:12	voidead	apparently
2016-09-16 16:57:19	voidead	even after changing my fontconfig
2016-09-16 16:57:30	voidead	nothing affects the Korean and Japanese fonts displayed
2016-09-16 16:57:49	voidead	only termite changes lol
2016-09-16 16:58:00	voidead	termite has consistently been my go to terminal
2016-09-16 16:58:04	voidead	so it will stay that way
2016-09-16 16:58:29	alyptik	voidead: first world problems brother
2016-09-16 16:58:31	alyptik	you and me both
2016-09-16 16:58:35	voidead	yeah lol
2016-09-16 16:58:56	voidead	its whatever.. I just wanted to fix whatever was fucked up honestly I don't really even care about the terminal lol
2016-09-16 16:59:27	voidead	"it's broken... GOD DAMMIT" "*fixed*.. ok I'll never use that application again"

2016-09-16 17:01:37	voidead	this is funny.. because Seoul's subway system is extremely efficient and not that complicated
2016-09-16 17:03:33	voidead	also.. my cousin is an idiot
2016-09-16 17:03:46	voidead	so she assumes that because I teach English
2016-09-16 17:04:15	voidead	I can you know.. somehow teach her kids because they are being homeschooled.. like.. teach them remotely here in Korea
2016-09-16 17:04:23	voidead	she must be out of her fucking mind
2016-09-16 17:04:38	alyptik	voidead: charge her like 100 bucks/hour
2016-09-16 17:05:01	voidead	I'm teaching Korean kids a _second_ language and helping them with understanding two different languages.. I'm not teaching native English kids
2016-09-16 17:05:49	voidead	alyptik› get this.. she said "call me at ***-***-**** I really need your help with some grammar questions" LOL
2016-09-16 17:06:12	voidead	I'm going to call her from Seoul Korea on my regular phone?
2016-09-16 17:06:16	voidead	god damn she is stupid
2016-09-16 17:06:31	voidead	I haven't called anyone from my regular phone yet
2016-09-16 17:06:41	voidead	I use the internet for voice calls and shit
2016-09-16 17:06:48	alyptik	rofl wow
2016-09-16 17:06:52	voidead	it would be extremely expensive to call someone that far away
2016-09-16 17:07:08	voidead	this is on Facebook too.. so I just ignore it lol
2016-09-16 17:07:16	voidead	she can keep messaging me all she wants I won't answer
2016-09-16 17:08:52	voidead	even after telling this bitch at least twice.. she still doesn't understand that _anything_ she already knows about English I also know.. in order to teach her kids she needs to actually go to school and learn some advanced concepts in English in order for her teaching to be effective for her kids
2016-09-16 17:08:57	voidead	thats my suggestion to her
2016-09-16 17:08:58	voidead	but nah.. 
2016-09-16 17:09:31	voidead	the kids I teach are just trying to comprehend a new language 
2016-09-16 17:09:42	voidead	they haven't even learned much of their own language yet
2016-09-16 17:09:43	+Anna	a lot of fucking crap
2016-09-16 17:11:24	voidead	so like.. asking me about some "grammar questions" is dumb as she should already be able to answer them
2016-09-16 17:11:38	voidead	unless she failed English
2016-09-16 17:12:23	voidead	I think what killed me was when she puts her cellphone number down and is like "hey when you get a chance call me at this number"

2016-09-16 17:15:59	voidead	I'm going to ignore her and see how angry and desperate she gets.. and if she still doesn't get it I'll finally say something lol
2016-09-16 17:16:50	voidead	she can you know.. hire a tutor... or refresh herself on some English concepts etc.. its not that fucking hard god damn she is teaching her own kids at home.. she has plenty of time to figure that shit out
2016-09-16 17:16:58	alyptik	any idea why tmux sends  ^[[1;5Q while it should be ^[[12^
2016-09-16 17:17:04	voidead	her husband works so she doesn't have anything to do during the day
2016-09-16 17:17:04	alyptik	for ^F2
2016-09-16 17:17:15	voidead	alyptik› probably $TERM issue

2016-09-16 17:17:19	voidead	issues*
2016-09-16 17:18:21	alyptik	happens with xterm, screen, and tmux
2016-09-16 17:18:22	alyptik	QQ
2016-09-16 17:18:24	voidead	alyptik› I think she doesn't send her kids to school not because she is against it.. she just wants to save money because public schools in that area suck ass and private schools are _way_ too expensive.. so that makes sense but if you are going to homeschool your kids you better have your shit together
2016-09-16 17:18:40	voidead	alyptik› yeah but tmux uses its own $TERM regardless
2016-09-16 17:18:47	alyptik	oh shit

2016-09-16 17:26:27	voidead	but like my VPS.. I had to do that
2016-09-16 17:27:00	voidead	some computers don't have the terminal installed and don't have the terminfo
2016-09-16 17:27:13	voidead	so you have to just install the term info

2016-09-17 18:47:31	voidead	alyptik› well I didn't say its znc's fault 
2016-09-17 18:47:32	voidead	but
2016-09-17 18:47:49	voidead	I've been using weechat's irc proxy for a while and I like it much more than znc
2016-09-17 18:48:08	alyptik	i use weechat relay too
2016-09-17 18:48:13	alyptik	or is proxy diff?
2016-09-17 18:48:51	voidead	well its weechat's relay..but using the irc proxy instead of weechat's weechat protocol
2016-09-17 18:49:13	alyptik	ah
2016-09-17 18:49:17	alyptik	what's the diff?
2016-09-17 18:50:39	voidead	so my VPS has the main weechat session running and my local weechat is using that connection via the weechat relay.. the only difference is that its using the irc protocol instead of the weechat protocol.. this is because applications like glowing bear use the weechat protocol and the weechat devs don't want two weechat sessions relaying via the weechat protocol for some reason
2016-09-17 18:51:26	voidead	their argument is "well the irc protocol already exists and works fine between two irc clients.. so no reason to use the weechat protocol in that regard"
2016-09-17 18:51:49	voidead	in short.. the protocol is the only difference
2016-09-17 18:51:50	voidead	lol
2016-09-17 18:52:01	voidead	its still using the weechat relay

2016-09-17 18:55:38	voidead	just using weechat instead of znc

2016-09-17 20:17:16	Max`P	What is it about?
2016-09-17 20:18:06	cirkit	basically how Snowden started in the CIA before going to NSA
2016-09-17 20:18:13	cirkit	it was really interesting
2016-09-17 20:18:29	cirkit	Glenn Greenwald and others were there with him 
2016-09-17 20:18:41	cirkit	don't wanna spoil it, but i think a lot of it was pretty accurate 
2016-09-17 20:19:05	cirkit	SALUTE A TRUE PATRIOT LIKE EDWARD SNOWDEN

2016-09-17 20:20:03	voidead	there are negative consequences from what he did.. positive as well.. either way I'm glad he did it
2016-09-17 20:20:03		[20:20]
2016-09-17 20:20:06	cirkit	that dude is smart as fuck
2016-09-17 20:20:14	cirkit	the programs he wrote and all
2016-09-17 20:20:42	cirkit	yeah voidead it's unfortunate
2016-09-17 20:20:56	voidead	no good deed goes unpunished as they say
2016-09-17 20:20:59	cirkit	if you're not part of the system the way REAL criminals are (i.e Hillary Clinton) then you're treated differently
2016-09-17 20:21:01	voidead	which is true in this case
2016-09-17 20:21:10	cirkit	Clinton has done far WORSE and should be in prison
2016-09-17 20:21:45	voidead	Hillary isn't perfect.. but its either Trump or Hillary.. so
2016-09-17 20:22:28	voidead	noone likes Hillary.. in fact I wish Bill Clinton was running I'd vote for his ass
2016-09-17 20:23:34	voidead	but I've said it before voting won't make an impact on anything as its the ruling elite who decides what the president will do ultimately
2016-09-17 20:23:59	voidead	its not like the president has anyone's best interest in mind
2016-09-17 20:24:07	voidead	they are just some corporate monkey
2016-09-17 20:24:17	cirkit	they're just puppets essentially

2016-09-17 20:24:38	Max`P	Nice
2016-09-17 20:25:19	voidead	cirkit› however.. I will say this.. _any_ change good or bad is ultimately what the US needs at this point.. doing the same fucking thing over and over will only make it worse for everyone
2016-09-17 20:25:49	voidead	Obama promised change and he only brought political gridlock

2016-09-17 20:26:36	cirkit	Snowden made a statement in the movie where he talked about how he believes Obama would have been better...would have brought real actual change, but he was disappointed to find he was wrong
2016-09-17 20:26:43	cirkit	believed*
2016-09-17 20:27:14	cirkit	voidead: got weed but no niggers

2016-09-17 20:28:48	voidead	I don't agree 100% with what Snowden did.. ultimately he could have done all this shit anonymously or something but instead he wanted to give himself some media attention and become some martyr
2016-09-17 20:28:55	bridgesfreezefirst	honestly, if Obama were smart he would pardon Snowden before Putin has a chance to exploit him further
2016-09-17 20:29:00	cirkit	the Japanese waitress and I caught each other's eyes a few times lol
2016-09-17 20:29:06	bridgesfreezefirst	it's chess, not checkers

2016-09-17 20:30:34	cirkit	even Putin has made statements criticizing Obama and pretty much all US administrations
2016-09-17 20:30:45	cirkit	i like how Putin is very blunt and doesn't sugar coat things
2016-09-17 20:31:20	cirkit	Putin pretty much explained who created ISIS -- US leaders/government

2016-09-17 21:17:18	MHD	i never understood it
2016-09-17 21:17:37	MHD	i was saying in 2008 'this is all BS, sloganeering. he has nothing, wont change anything'
2016-09-17 21:17:55	MHD	but cos he's part of some racial fairytale everyone lost it for him
2016-09-17 21:20:42	voidead	yeah the whole reason he was voted twice was merely because of race

2016-09-18 17:57:51	cirkit	neat, LDAP queries now work over TLS from VPS #1 -> #2 and back \o
2016-09-18 17:57:58	cirkit	now need to setup replication
2016-09-18 17:58:04	cirkit	but first, weed
2016-09-18 17:59:04	halfwit	That sounds fancy, but not sure what exactly it all means
2016-09-18 18:00:49	cirkit	ideally i'd like to setup a slave LDAP node...already technically have a master LDAP host...basically data from the master LDAP server will copy to the slave LDAP server (vps #2) as read-only
2016-09-18 18:01:45	cirkit	so if Linode is DDoS'd or something then the 2nd node will continue serving LDAP 
2016-09-18 18:02:14	cirkit	that's just the start...then will need to configure the mail server's IMAP/SMTP to also do similar
2016-09-18 18:02:38	cirkit	or if Digital Ocean is DDoS'd hopefully Linode isn't at the same time LOL
2016-09-18 18:04:03	halfwit	Oh, that's fancy actually
2016-09-18 18:04:50	cirkit	it's just directory services is all
2016-09-18 18:05:19	halfwit	Yeah, but you described it so well.
2016-09-18 18:05:54	cirkit	Ah, thanks :P

2016-09-18 18:45:53	Max`P	It's not really used so I can force it blank

2016-09-18 18:47:35	alyptik	maybe Anna got stoned and deleted you by mistake
2016-09-18 18:47:41	Max`P	It's like you don't have an account... Maybe you didn't reregister since the last VoidNet in december?
2016-09-18 18:48:33	Max`P	I'm sure I saw you registered tho, that's really weird... Register again and hope it will stay o.O
2016-09-18 18:48:53	bridgesfreezefirst	ok Max`P i just sent the registration, but i didn't get a confirmation e-mail
2016-09-18 18:49:24	Max`P	Humm, that's prob still broke, will activate manually
2016-09-18 18:49:31	bridgesfreezefirst	you can activate me now?

2016-09-18 18:54:12	Max`P	The services weren't quite setted up until recently so it may have expired for some weird reason, settings should be a lot more saner and serious now

2016-09-20 05:31:19	voidead	but if more people are aware of the issue there might be more urgency to do something about it
2016-09-20 05:31:36	voidead	and of course.. put more sanctions on North Korea.. or hell.. even invade them
2016-09-20 05:32:20	halfwit1	I'm on board with it, the only shit part is that you're gonna end up killing innocents that were conscripted.
2016-09-20 05:32:23	voidead	invading North Korea would be a horrible horrible idea though
2016-09-20 05:32:39	halfwit1	I like the idea of a targetted takedown of the government, but that's very much non-trivial
2016-09-20 05:32:52	voidead	its like invading Iran 
2016-09-20 05:32:56	voidead	thats a horrible idea
2016-09-20 05:33:15	voidead	but you know.. everyone wants to use the US military to do their dirty work
2016-09-20 05:33:37	voidead	its not like South Korea can just invade North Korea on their own
2016-09-20 05:33:39	voidead	it would be nice though

2016-09-21 05:09:09	prg	i don't have some huge opinion one way or the other about the refugees but i mean just calling people racist for having different opinions is literally cancer
2016-09-21 05:09:32	voidead	well racist is a blanket term
2016-09-21 05:09:41	voidead	and doesn't even mean anything
2016-09-21 05:09:41	prg	its super overused
2016-09-21 05:09:44	prg	yeah
2016-09-21 05:09:50	prg	it should be saved for people that are actually racist
2016-09-21 05:10:04	voidead	I mean god damn.. humans are inherently racist.. unless we are all the same fucking race
2016-09-21 05:10:33	voidead	hell you may as well call everyone culturist too.. we are all different cultures as well
2016-09-21 05:10:44	prg	how dare you voidead :P
2016-09-21 05:10:45	jerring	i dont think so
2016-09-21 05:10:53	voidead	humans cannot and will not adhere to other people's way of life
2016-09-21 05:10:58	jerring	i think racsim is a learned thing
2016-09-21 05:11:24	jerring	its like religion almost
2016-09-21 05:11:29	jerring	indoctrination
2016-09-21 05:12:09	voidead	but the point I'm making is.. there shouldn't be some stigma at all with any of these terms.. they literally mean nothing at all and noone should be triggered because someone is different
2016-09-21 05:12:57	voidead	I think there should be one term for people who are violent.. assholism
2016-09-21 05:13:04	voidead	that pretty much explains it all
2016-09-21 05:13:16	prg	i just really wish people would stop throwing RACIST out there as soon as someone makes a point someone else doesn't agree with
2016-09-21 05:13:43	voidead	all these specific terms: homophobic, racist.. etc.. they are all pointing to one thing.. "you are a fucking asshole"
2016-09-21 05:14:07	jerring	my kids have no concept of race, muchless racism at this point.. unless youre talking about difference races of beings of course..

2016-09-21 05:14:22	voidead	jerring› yeah exactly
2016-09-21 05:14:30	prg	well that's the thing the term is so overloaded now
2016-09-21 05:14:41	prg	you point out a difference between racists around some people and its RACIST
2016-09-21 05:14:45	prg	between races**
2016-09-21 05:15:04	prg	facts are racist
2016-09-21 05:15:13	jerring	dont be racist prg
2016-09-21 05:15:16	voidead	I think the meaning of these terms have almost completely been washed away.. all of our cultures and races have mixed so much that racism is a thing of the past.. calling someone a racist is just as stupid as the thing they are accusing said racist of
2016-09-21 05:16:52	prg	yeah i hear you
2016-09-21 05:17:24	voidead	lets say.. you have _only_ white or _only_ black people living in one place.. and just within the past year or so (maybe lets roll this back to the 1700s or 1800s) well calling someone a racist makes sense.. because essentially they have no experience with any other race except their own.. hence why they are racist... fast forward to today.. being a racist is a fucking joke and calling people
2016-09-21 05:17:26	voidead	a racist is a fucking joke
2016-09-21 05:17:42	jerring	racism is GREAT for controlling people
2016-09-21 05:17:58	jerring	dudes in prison LOVE that shit
2016-09-21 05:18:23	voidead	but people use "racism" or even "terrorism" as buzzwords for something completely different from what those people should be called "violent assholes"

2016-09-21 05:21:44	prg	i did get hit up about this PHP job though.. normally not that interested in PHP but this company is designing a linux based router w/ a PHP web front end
2016-09-21 05:22:00	prg	could be interesting and they said they would pay way more than what i'm getting now
2016-09-21 05:23:59	prg	oh wow this company is partnered with the NSA to make router fw YIKES
2016-09-21 05:23:59		[05:23]
2016-09-21 05:24:22	prg	but it looks like the router would be for military/government so that makes sense i guess

2016-09-21 06:38:13	voidead	I'm sure its nice

2016-09-21 09:34:40	prg	i was interested in one position (the router fw position) and now they are trying to set me up interviews with companies i give 0 shits about and trying to pressure me into coming in to meet the recruiters for some fucking reason?
2016-09-21 09:34:56	prg	i would understand if i had no job, but then they also told me if i had no job they wouldn't be interested lol

2016-09-21 09:36:51	prg	that's how i feel
2016-09-21 09:36:52	Max`P	Wanting someone because he's got a job already? That's kinda stupid
2016-09-21 09:37:04	prg	well they were insinuating that if you don't have a job you're not qualified 
2016-09-21 09:37:10	prg	or less qualified
2016-09-21 09:37:15	prg	which is probably true in many cases
2016-09-21 09:37:45	Max`P	That's still pretty bullshit. If I were to look for a new job, I'd make sure to quit first because overlapping two jobs is a pain
2016-09-21 09:37:48	prg	but like they want me to drive to center city philly and just fucking talk with them about my skills so they can try to fit me somewhere.. during work hours
2016-09-21 09:38:20	prg	it is bullshit but it's also nice to be like "yeah i dont *need* this job; i like my job but would be willing to move if its worth my while"
2016-09-21 09:38:30	prg	and i'm fine interviewing with people while i have a job

2016-09-21 09:39:21	prg	they were like bragging themselves up "yeah we're one of the most reputable headhunters in philly etc" and then i get an email from one of the companies that i was interested in and they were like "so did they actually talk to you about this or are they a monster/indeed scraper?"
2016-09-21 09:39:32	Max`P	And not on the clock, that's just stupid
2016-09-21 09:39:42	prg	yeah def not on the clock
2016-09-21 09:39:56	Max`P	It's like they want you to lose your job
2016-09-21 09:40:21	prg	they set me up with this bullshit phone interview that i don't think i even agreed to
2016-09-21 09:40:32	Max`P	The whole thing contradicts with itself it's so bad, I'd just give them the finger
2016-09-21 09:40:37	prg	just sent me the email like "oh yeah so your phone interview with<shitty company idc/idk> is at <time>"
2016-09-21 09:41:14	prg	i'm going to do the phone interview i guess but i told him like dude i'm not this desperate chill out
2016-09-21 09:42:51	Max`P	Send them an email like "So, lets get this straight. You want me because I already have a job, because you consider unemployed people to be unqualified. Then you expect me to be available in the middle of my work day. So, you are guys are looking to hire people that take random days off to go to interviews for other companies, do I understand right
2016-09-21 09:42:51	Max`P	?"
2016-09-21 09:45:22	prg	lol i should
2016-09-21 09:46:06	prg	i sent the guy basically a thing saying "i appreciate your enthusiasm, but i'm not desperate enough for a job to the point where i'll have to reschedule my current work obligations just to talk in person with recruiters"
2016-09-21 09:48:36	prg	it's funny because the guy at the router fw gig is being super respectful of my time

2016-09-21 09:50:40	Max`P	Yeah, it's the first thing I do when someone approaches me. The recruiter is UNDER me. They're a client. They have to respect me if they want my business. Typically it filters out the bad companies that treat their employees like crap
2016-09-21 09:51:34	prg	exactly - like there is no reason that i should feel obligated to meet up with them like they are trying to do
2016-09-21 09:51:54	prg	i think its just the sales mentality... headhunting is the new phone sales you know?
2016-09-21 09:52:16	prg	"oh so you can come in on monday right?" "no? well how about sometime next week" like dude take a hint - never
2016-09-21 09:52:17	prg	fuck off

2016-09-21 09:54:04	Max`P	When we arrange a meeting if I'm interested, I ask _them_ when they are available and *I* find a hole in my schedule for them. I can be flexible a bit, but I'm certainly not gonna behave like if I was an employee there because I'm not

2016-09-21 13:53:57	Halfwit	cirkit: o/
2016-09-21 13:54:01	cirkit	Halfwit: cheers \o
2016-09-21 13:54:07	Halfwit	Did you do the interview shit?
2016-09-21 13:54:12	cirkit	not yet...that's Friday
2016-09-21 13:54:16	Halfwit	Oh ok.
2016-09-21 13:54:23	Halfwit	I'm excited for you.
2016-09-21 13:54:35	cirkit	went to my Psychiatrist and then got my LG's phone screen replaced
2016-09-21 13:54:42	Halfwit	Nice.
2016-09-21 13:55:06	cirkit	he wants me (psychiatrist) to see a therapist....i forgot what kind..there were like 2 types of therapist
2016-09-21 13:55:16	cirkit	he also prescribed Zoloft to me but i'm not very fond of taking pills
2016-09-21 13:55:20	cirkit	gonna toke
2016-09-21 13:55:52	cirkit	his 1st recommendation was Zoloft followed by Prozac and then Effexor 
2016-09-21 13:55:59	cirkit	but fuck Effexor...seems like it fucks up Max`P 
2016-09-21 13:56:02	Halfwit	Neither am I. So fucking little actual research is done on the long term, etc effects. It's like... They only fucking do anything reactively
2016-09-21 13:56:23	cirkit	he said he could be "wrong", but according to him he thinks i have PTSD and an anxiety disorder
2016-09-21 13:56:34	cirkit	but i think that's just his assumptions 
2016-09-21 13:56:45	Max`P	wat, PTSD? xD
2016-09-21 13:56:53	Max`P	What's your issues?
2016-09-21 13:57:05	cirkit	hi Max`P - PTSD stands for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
2016-09-21 13:57:14	cirkit	but i don't know if he is even correct on his analysis for me
2016-09-21 13:57:42	cirkit	Max`P: mainly anxiety i guess...some depression according to him
2016-09-21 13:57:52	cirkit	he doesn't think i'm autistic...but then again he isn't even 100% sure what i have lel
2016-09-21 13:58:17	cirkit	but anyway i'd rather not take zoloft...he wants to start me off with a light dosage...still need to pick it up from the pharmacy
2016-09-21 13:58:27	cirkit	but i think seeing a therapist would be way better
2016-09-21 13:58:37	cirkit	will probably take time to find one i really trust and all
2016-09-21 13:58:49	+Anna	Lel

2016-09-21 13:59:48	cirkit	Max`P: thank goodness you're not as fucked up as me

2016-09-21 13:59:51	Halfwit	lOL
2016-09-21 14:00:02	Halfwit	Fucking Anna, don't laugh at him!
2016-09-21 14:00:42	cirkit	i told my Psychiatrist i'd just prefer to toke weed since it helps me with the shit those pills allegedly help with
2016-09-21 14:00:49	cirkit	he nodded in agreement...i suspect he tokes too
2016-09-21 14:01:55	Max`P	I'd say Effexor helped me nicely, but you don't seem like you're having panic attacks or anything
2016-09-21 14:02:30	Max`P	And yeah I know what PTSD means, but do you know of anything that would have caused the trauma or did he just pull that straight out of his ass?
2016-09-21 14:03:52	cirkit	Max`P: childhood experiences going through abuse both mental and physical
2016-09-21 14:03:56	cirkit	so yeah, i'm fucked up
2016-09-21 14:04:12	Max`P	Ah, I see. Yeah...
2016-09-21 14:04:45	Max`P	You never talked about anything really so it's hard to know :P
2016-09-21 14:04:57	Max`P	Do you feel that affects you today?
2016-09-21 14:05:04	cirkit	according to him he said he doesn't see me fit with autism and he's worked with a lot of children and adults who were apparently autistic
2016-09-21 14:05:14	cirkit	yeah Max`P ...at times
2016-09-21 14:05:27	cirkit	i've gotten better, but it's still there
2016-09-21 14:05:43	Max`P	Seems like he might be right then

2016-09-21 14:09:03	cirkit	"Treatment for post traumatic stress disorder can involve counseling, cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, antidepressant drugs, antipsychotic medications, or a combination of one or more of these treatments."
2016-09-21 14:09:03		[14:09]
2016-09-21 14:09:25	cirkit	hmm...seems about right
2016-09-21 14:09:41	halfwit	I thought they had a bunch of successes with strange drugs lately
2016-09-21 14:10:49	cirkit	apparently what i'm reading states PTSD can lead to panic attacks too
2016-09-21 14:10:55	cirkit	Max`P: so wonder if you have PTSD, too
2016-09-21 14:10:56	cirkit	hmm
2016-09-21 14:11:06	Max`P	cirkit: don't think so. I have burnout
2016-09-21 14:11:17	cirkit	ah
2016-09-21 14:11:37	Max`P	I feel a whole lot better these days actually, with the new job and the meds. Considering reducing the Effexor and Adderall
2016-09-21 14:12:16	cirkit	Max`P: yeah, that's really good. Effexor was recommended as a 3rd choice...ever taken Zoloft?
2016-09-21 14:12:57	Max`P	No, they gave me Effexor right away. Seems like they like Effexor here, but it also fitted my profile somewhat well since it deals with both depression and anxiety
2016-09-21 14:13:01	cirkit	"Individuals with PTSD often have fatigue from poor sleep patterns, trouble concentrating, and memory problems, all of which can interfere with the individual's ability to work and maintain a job."
2016-09-21 14:13:06	Max`P	apparently helps focusing a bit too
2016-09-21 14:14:10	halfwit	Max`P: Awesome man
2016-09-21 14:14:19	cirkit	yeah, glad it's working out 
2016-09-21 14:14:23	Max`P	Hmm yeah, that would make sense. I wish you the best to discover yourself cirkit!
2016-09-21 14:14:39	Max`P	It's quite interesting to dig deep into yourself and understand that kind of stuff
2016-09-21 14:14:44	cirkit	Thanks :)
2016-09-21 14:14:54	cirkit	Zoloft has side affects, too...hopefully not too major for me
2016-09-21 14:15:05	cirkit	apparently they go away after 1 or 2 weeks if you do have affects
2016-09-21 14:15:16	 *	cirkit tokes
2016-09-21 14:15:35	Max`P	pretty much unavoidable, the side effects
2016-09-21 14:16:08	halfwit	Are they depressive for a bit?
2016-09-21 14:17:47	cirkit	from what i remember my psychiatrist telling me it could cause things like: nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, loss of appetite, increased sweating, upset stomach
2016-09-21 14:17:55	halfwit	Oh, ok. 
2016-09-21 14:18:01	halfwit	Chantix was wildly depressive
2016-09-21 14:18:07	cirkit	but those seem pretty common with most prescription drugs
2016-09-21 14:19:34	halfwit	sBut also really weird dreams and shit, hallucinations, 
2016-09-21 14:19:41	halfwit	Thinking that everyone was out to get me... uh
2016-09-21 14:19:44	halfwit	What's that one called
2016-09-21 14:19:49	halfwit	That persisted a while after
2016-09-21 14:19:51	cirkit	ah
2016-09-21 14:20:10	cirkit	that sounds similar to what some people feel on speed
2016-09-21 14:20:27	cirkit	i know for sure things like meth make you feel like someone's around the corner trying to get you
2016-09-21 14:20:32	cirkit	paranoia on meth lel

2016-09-21 14:21:06	halfwit	I am so fucking glad that it was just the drugs that did it, fucking hell it'd be hard to live like that.

2016-09-21 16:31:00		[16:25]
2016-09-21 16:40:35	cirkit	hrm...apparently the black screen of doom problem seems to be due to using iCloud authentication...probably retarded shit is enabled in the newer macOS releases
2016-09-21 16:40:42	cirkit	can you even boot into safe mode?
2016-09-21 16:40:45	Max`P	nope

2016-09-22 11:54:07	alyptik	Max`P: how many servers is it? 2-3?
2016-09-22 11:55:44	Max`P	2
2016-09-22 11:56:22	alyptik	ah
2016-09-22 11:57:31	Max`P	that's because when the original voidnet imploded, I created a quick server on irc.max-p.me temporarly
2016-09-22 11:57:53	alyptik	how come it imploded?
2016-09-22 11:57:57	Max`P	Eventually it never went back on, so I created voidnet.max-p.me as the real server, but never unlinked the backup one
2016-09-22 11:58:22	Max`P	The admin disappeared and left the server unpaid, so the hosting company pulled the plug
2016-09-22 11:58:29	alyptik	ouch

2016-09-22 12:05:36	cirkit	the tech at Best Buy said it's one of the worse jobs/installation's he has seen LOL
2016-09-22 12:05:43	cirkit	i believe it

2016-09-22 12:06:22	cirkit	but the stock USB port is disabled for som reason, so gonna bring it back..dude at Worse Buy said he'd take a look to hook it back up
2016-09-22 12:06:25	alyptik	i used to work in a car upholstery shop, omg some cars that came in had aftermarket system that were so fucked
2016-09-22 12:07:09	cirkit	alyptik: it's amazing how those car audio "techs" get hired when they do TERRIBLE jobs that are quite apparent 
2016-09-22 12:07:22	cirkit	the guys at Best Buy are far more knowledgeable
2016-09-22 12:07:27	cirkit	at least here
2016-09-22 12:07:39	Max`P	The problem is that the entry level for this stuff is so low you can hire pretty much anyone to do it and they do it quite poorly
2016-09-22 12:08:00	Max`P	and Worst Buy isn't a car shop, so they likely only touch cars to do car audio
2016-09-22 12:08:01	alyptik	lol yeah
2016-09-22 12:08:54	cirkit	i need to reinstall the apps that come with my stock unit, but i can't do that since the USB is currently disabled LOL
2016-09-22 12:09:01	cirkit	i took it to Toyota and they were absolutely clueless

2016-09-22 14:32:12	Max`P	It's a router, they certainly can afford to run something decent

2016-09-22 17:08:12	voidead	I was considering getting a really expensive and fast road bike but then I realized that the roads would fuck the suspension up or something
2016-09-22 17:08:31	voidead	I'd have to ride it only in certain places
2016-09-22 17:08:34	voidead	and thats annoying
2016-09-22 17:08:47	voidead	so I guess I could put nice tires on the bike I already have
2016-09-22 17:08:54	voidead	its a pretty damn fast bike as is
2016-09-22 17:09:01	voidead	but it could be faster
2016-09-22 17:09:39	voidead	oh and I realized something.. I was looking at all these bikes parked near the subway entrance and every bike is almost exactly the same
2016-09-22 17:09:47	voidead	fucking rusty ass mountain bike
2016-09-22 17:10:08	voidead	and every fucking one of those bikes has the gears in the worst position possible lol
2016-09-22 17:11:05	voidead	like.. if you are on the 6th or 7th gear on the back tire.. then you should be on the 2nd or 3rd gear on the front gears on the pedals too.. otherwise you will put too much strain on the chain
2016-09-22 17:11:39	voidead	but they have their bike on the 1st small gear on the front and the 6th or 7th gear on the back
2016-09-22 17:11:41	voidead	which is dumb
2016-09-22 17:12:00	voidead	but what is strange is.. its literally every fucking bike I saw parked is like that lol
