2016-10-05 19:16:42	Abbott	What is a change-summary?
2016-10-05 19:16:59	Abbott	also why do you use -t only and not -a if you want to preserve stuff?

2016-10-05 19:36:39	BasketCase	you should not ever run rsync without -t
2016-10-05 19:38:16	BasketCase	-a is a reasonable minimum option.  -t is  something that you should do on the rare  occasion that -a is not appropriate.
2016-10-05 19:39:41	BasketCase	rsync should not ever be run without either --times or --archive (which includes --times).
