2016-10-17 12:54:20	rgareus	Somethis: which version of ardour is that?
2016-10-17 12:54:37	Somethis	rgareus: checking ...
2016-10-17 12:54:57	Somethis	Ardour 4.6.0
2016-10-17 12:54:58	Somethis	"Evening Star"
2016-10-17 12:54:58	Somethis	(built from revision 1:4.6~dfsg-1)
2016-10-17 12:55:13	Somethis	... oops, multiline
2016-10-17 12:55:43	rgareus	most likely issue is that some external files are missing
2016-10-17 12:55:55	rgareus	next likeley: disk full.
2016-10-17 12:56:52	rgareus	Somethis: can you try to uncheck "Copy external media into new session" ?
2016-10-17 12:57:34	Somethis	rgareus: 90 gigs of free space on internal HD .. that's plenty
2016-10-17 12:57:52	Somethis	rgareus: ok ... unchecking that
2016-10-17 12:58:14	rgareus	Somethis: maybe you're used "external" files (not copied into session-dir) and those files are no longer available.
2016-10-17 13:00:54	Somethis	rgareus: looks good so far ... no error message ... I'm manually checking the files.

2016-10-17 13:03:14	the_CLA	Hm, if files were missing there should also be the missing files dialog on session load.

2016-10-17 13:03:51	Somethis	the_CLA: Yes, there was a dialog on session load

2016-10-17 13:07:41	rgareus	I'm not sure what the proper solution is in this case. maybe simply follow the initial "ignore missing" and keep copying.

2016-10-17 13:09:19	the_CLA	rgareus: Or an additional option "skip missing..." in the Save as. Hmmm...
2016-10-17 13:09:57	the_CLA	But I guess the proper solution would be if the user cleaned up the session first, so that there are no files missing anymore. ;)
2016-10-17 13:09:58	Somethis	rgareus: Ardour crashed hard on me when I tried that. That's when things got out of hand. Luckily, I made some backups with "rsync -lr ..."
2016-10-17 13:11:36	Somethis	rgareus: ... but now It seems like a better practice to run "Session > Save as" for backups
2016-10-17 13:11:59	the_CLA	Somethis: Tried what? Cleanup?
2016-10-17 13:12:41	Somethis	the_CLA: no, when I tried to use "skip missing ..." the first time.

2016-10-17 13:14:47	Somethis	the_CLA: Ardour doesn't like bongos, I guess.
2016-10-17 13:15:59	the_CLA	Somethis: But who knows: Maybe the Bongo-Bug has been fixed in the meantime. ;)

2016-10-17 13:30:08	Somethis	ok, I'm switching back to Cubase (urgh).
2016-10-17 13:31:07	Bitrunner	;)

2016-10-17 13:36:32	Bitrunner	and of course, Drummers will appreciate a "correct timing" function...
2016-10-17 13:37:08	Somethis	something along the line of autotune for guitars :-D
2016-10-17 13:37:08		[13:37]
2016-10-17 13:37:41	Bitrunner	well, autotune won't help if you press the "F" key when a "E" is notated...
2016-10-17 13:38:10	Bitrunner	(ok, somtetimes maybe you just found a Bug in the Composition and instantly corrected the composer, maybe...)
2016-10-17 13:38:47	Somethis	... and I was wondering why the "E" key never worked on my Telecaster!
2016-10-17 13:39:18	Bitrunner	"E" is too low for a Telecaster. Try an "e" ;)
2016-10-17 13:39:27	Somethis	turns out, it's the volume knob
2016-10-17 13:39:56	Somethis	an "e" ... mrpf
2016-10-17 13:40:06	 *	Bitrunner detex: it is helpful to know the own tools... ;)
2016-10-17 13:40:55	Bitrunner	but reading manuals is "out" these days I think
2016-10-17 13:41:38	ristic	Melodyne can change particualr notes in a guitar chord.
2016-10-17 13:41:45	ristic	Turn a G into a Gm for example.
2016-10-17 13:43:05	Somethis	Melodyne was really impressive ... five years back, already
2016-10-17 13:44:02	Bitrunner	ristic: the point is, the plugin would have to know that "Gm" instead of "G" is right that time
2016-10-17 13:44:44	Bitrunner	and /dev/crystal_ball is dysfunctional even on newest Linux Kernels :-(
2016-10-17 13:44:54	Somethis	would work ... unless it's Jazz or an REM song.
2016-10-17 13:45:05	Bitrunner	or may be some modern avant garde composition
2016-10-17 13:47:07	Bitrunner	ok, you never need that plugin for Free Jazz by Definition ;)
2016-10-17 13:49:47	Somethis	rgareus: ... I just reopened the project and am getting a brand new "Ardour cannot find the audio file ..." dialogue ...

2016-10-17 13:51:03	rgareus	Somethis: not really. if external files are removed, there's not much we can do.
2016-10-17 13:51:50	Somethis	rgareus: mhmm, yes that makes sense. I didn't (re)move any files, though.
2016-10-17 13:52:25	rgareus	I suppose "a remove all missing files from session" option or something could be added
2016-10-17 13:52:25		[13:52]
2016-10-17 13:52:38	Somethis	ok, it's a file in a subfolder called *interchange*

2016-10-17 14:00:36	Somethis	the_CLA: that's the saved as one ... I'm checking the logfile for entries of the missing file.
2016-10-17 14:01:24	Somethis	the_CLA: ok ... the last entry reads ...

2016-10-17 14:02:13	Somethis	I presume "dead" is a folder full of intentionally deleted files?
2016-10-17 14:03:23	the_CLA	O.o
2016-10-17 14:04:16	the_CLA	Well, it's the place where session cleanup copies the files first. Just confusing that the save as function tries to copy anything from there.

2016-10-17 14:10:27	Somethis	the_CLA: ok, thanks, though.
2016-10-17 14:11:27	the_CLA	I guess before trying to debug things you should update to the latest release to see if the issues still exist.
