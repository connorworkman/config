2016-10-17 12:54:37	Somethis	rgareus: checking ...
2016-10-17 12:54:57	Somethis	Ardour 4.6.0

2016-10-17 12:55:13	Somethis	... oops, multiline
2016-10-17 12:55:43	rgareus	most likely issue is that some external files are missing
2016-10-17 12:55:55	rgareus	next likeley: disk full.

2016-10-17 12:57:52	Somethis	rgareus: ok ... unchecking that
2016-10-17 12:58:14	rgareus	Somethis: maybe you're used "external" files (not copied into session-dir) and those files are no longer available.
2016-10-17 13:00:54	Somethis	rgareus: looks good so far ... no error message ... I'm manually checking the files.

2016-10-17 13:09:57	the_CLA	But I guess the proper solution would be if the user cleaned up the session first, so that there are no files missing anymore. ;)

2016-10-17 13:37:08	Somethis	something along the line of autotune for guitars :-D
2016-10-17 13:37:08		[13:37]

2016-10-17 13:39:18	Bitrunner	"E" is too low for a Telecaster. Try an "e" ;)
2016-10-17 13:39:27	Somethis	turns out, it's the volume knob

2016-10-17 13:40:55	Bitrunner	but reading manuals is "out" these days I think
2016-10-17 13:41:38	ristic	Melodyne can change particualr notes in a guitar chord.
2016-10-17 13:41:45	ristic	Turn a G into a Gm for example.
2016-10-17 13:43:05	Somethis	Melodyne was really impressive ... five years back, already
2016-10-17 13:44:02	Bitrunner	ristic: the point is, the plugin would have to know that "Gm" instead of "G" is right that time
2016-10-17 13:44:44	Bitrunner	and /dev/crystal_ball is dysfunctional even on newest Linux Kernels :-(
2016-10-17 13:44:54	Somethis	would work ... unless it's Jazz or an REM song.
2016-10-17 13:45:05	Bitrunner	or may be some modern avant garde composition
2016-10-17 13:47:07	Bitrunner	ok, you never need that plugin for Free Jazz by Definition ;)

2016-10-17 13:52:25	rgareus	I suppose "a remove all missing files from session" option or something could be added

2016-10-17 14:02:13	Somethis	I presume "dead" is a folder full of intentionally deleted files?
2016-10-17 14:03:23	the_CLA	O.o
2016-10-17 14:04:16	the_CLA	Well, it's the place where session cleanup copies the files first. Just confusing that the save as function tries to copy anything from there.

2016-10-17 14:11:27	the_CLA	I guess before trying to debug things you should update to the latest release to see if the issues still exist.

2016-10-17 21:03:36	Bitrunner	[23:44:44] and /dev/crystal_ball is dysfunctional even on newest Linux Kernels :-( [23:44:44]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[23:44:54] would work ... unless it's Jazz or an REM song. [23:44:54]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Bitrunner	[23:45:05] or may be some modern avant garde composition [23:45:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Bitrunner	[23:47:07] ok, you never need that plugin for Free Jazz by Definition ;) [23:47:07]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[23:49:47] rgareus: ... I just reopened the project and am getting a brand new "Ardour cannot find the audio file ..." dialogue ... [23:49:47]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[23:50:16] rgareus: would it help if I document what happens? [23:50:16]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	rgareus	[23:51:03] Somethis: not really. if external files are removed, there's not much we can do. [23:51:03]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[23:51:50] rgareus: mhmm, yes that makes sense. I didn't (re)move any files, though. [23:51:50]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	rgareus	[23:52:25] I suppose "a remove all missing files from session" option or something could be added [23:52:25]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[23:52:38] ok, it's a file in a subfolder called *interchange* [23:52:38]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	rgareus	[23:53:03] mmh. that's inside of the session-dir [23:53:03]

2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[23:56:58] The file's not there (and neither a similar one) ... strange. [23:56:58]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	the_CLA	[23:59:52] Somethis: Is that the original session or the saved-as one? [23:59:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:00:36] the_CLA: that's the saved as one ... I'm checking the logfile for entries of the missing file. [00:00:36]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:01:24] the_CLA: ok ... the last entry reads ... [INFO]: attempting to copy /home/gemini/Desktop/Files/Media/Music Composition/20160923-GoodbyeBrigitte_Backup09/dead/Vocals Temp-1.wav to /home/gemini/Desktop/Files/Media/Music Composition/20171018-GoodbyeBrigitte/dead/Vocals Temp-1.wav [00:01:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:02:13] I presume "dead" is a folder full of intentionally deleted files? [00:02:13]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	the_CLA	[00:03:22] O.o [00:03:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	the_CLA	[00:04:16] Well, it's the place where session cleanup copies the files first. Just confusing that the save as function tries to copy anything from there. [00:04:16]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:06:36] the_CLA: and Ardour looks for the file in /interchange .. on restart [00:06:36]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:08:40] any suggestions ... last time "Skip all missing files" crashed Ardour. [00:08:40]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	the_CLA	[00:10:02] Somethis: No idea. I think there were also some changes to "save as" after 4.6 - but not sure if those matter in that case. [00:10:02]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:10:27] the_CLA: ok, thanks, though. [00:10:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	the_CLA	[00:11:27] I guess before trying to debug things you should update to the latest release to see if the issues still exist. [00:11:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:11:39] yup ... [00:11:39]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	the_CLA	[00:11:55] Anyway. Time to get some sleep for me! [00:11:55]

2016-10-18 00:14:23	rgareus	[23:52:25] I suppose "a remove all missing files from session" option or something could be added [23:52:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[23:52:38] ok, it's a file in a subfolder called *interchange* [23:52:38]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	rgareus	[23:53:03] mmh. that's inside of the session-dir [23:53:03]

2016-10-18 00:14:23	LAbot	[23:54:52] Title: Saving to a new Session in Ardour - Album on Imgur (at imgur.com) [23:54:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[23:54:57] step 4 ... [23:54:57]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[23:55:27] checking if that file exists [23:55:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[23:56:58] The file's not there (and neither a similar one) ... strange. [23:56:58]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	the_CLA	[23:59:52] Somethis: Is that the original session or the saved-as one? [23:59:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:00:36] the_CLA: that's the saved as one ... I'm checking the logfile for entries of the missing file. [00:00:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:01:24] the_CLA: ok ... the last entry reads ... [INFO]: attempting to copy /home/gemini/Desktop/Files/Media/Music Composition/20160923-GoodbyeBrigitte_Backup09/dead/Vocals Temp-1.wav to /home/gemini/Desktop/Files/Media/Music Composition/20171018-GoodbyeBrigitte/dead/Vocals Temp-1.wav [00:01:24]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:02:13] I presume "dead" is a folder full of intentionally deleted files? [00:02:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	the_CLA	[00:03:22] O.o [00:03:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	the_CLA	[00:04:16] Well, it's the place where session cleanup copies the files first. Just confusing that the save as function tries to copy anything from there. [00:04:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:06:36] the_CLA: and Ardour looks for the file in /interchange .. on restart [00:06:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:08:40] any suggestions ... last time "Skip all missing files" crashed Ardour. [00:08:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	the_CLA	[00:10:02] Somethis: No idea. I think there were also some changes to "save as" after 4.6 - but not sure if those matter in that case. [00:10:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:10:27] the_CLA: ok, thanks, though. [00:10:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	the_CLA	[00:11:27] I guess before trying to debug things you should update to the latest release to see if the issues still exist. [00:11:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:11:39] yup ... [00:11:39]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	the_CLA	[00:11:55] Anyway. Time to get some sleep for me! [00:11:55]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:13:25] the_CLA: good night ;-) [00:13:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:13:35] same here, mhmpf [00:13:35]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[02:39:54] rgareus: the vamp_audio_to_midi script. if I'm reading it right it wants ONE audio region and ONE midi region the same size to hold output? How to create the empty midi region? (It's not obvious. I had a  couple ideas I tried that didn't work) [02:39:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[02:55:28] nstewart, what did you try? [02:55:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[03:55:45] one thing I tried was creating markers at the ends of the audio region, then try to create a region in the midi track, but without content, I can't seem to do region operations [03:55:45]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[03:57:30] paas44 (I think it was) and myself scratched our heads a bit and came up with some ideas which I don't recall but were unsuccessful [03:57:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:02:50] nstewart, creating a region always requires having a source [04:02:50]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:03:04] nstewart, so you'd need an SMFSource to get started [04:03:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[04:06:32] I don't see that it knows about anything higher than a midi region.  [04:06:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:12:11] nstewart, reviewing the lua bindings, what you need isn't there [04:12:11]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[04:12:27] so the track already IS an SMF  on disk? [04:12:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:12:49] nstewart, don't get the levels confused [04:12:49]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:13:17] nstewart, the only thing that knows about files on disk are diskstreams (hidden component in a Track) and regions [04:13:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:13:33] nstewart, for playback purposes, a track is just a playlist; no sources [04:13:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:13:47] nstewart, for recording purposes, a track is a diskstream, and it has 1 or more sources to write to [04:13:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[04:13:56] if I can figure out what is needed I'll take a stab at it. But I have to drop.  [04:13:56]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:14:12] nstewart, regions are the main thing that reference sources because they are the objects that actually read data from them [04:14:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:14:28] rgareus, there's no constructor for a MIDI region [04:14:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:15:13] nstewart, ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ [04:15:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:15:17] rgareus, sorry, not for you [04:15:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[04:21:02] is there a Region constructor for that matter? Didn't see it. I thought I recalled something in one of the docs or examples that there was a reason - like you shouldn't create them directly. but I'm foggy  [04:21:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	cglocke	[08:35:28] good morning! [08:35:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	cglocke	[08:36:16] any plugin recommendations for frequency "sweeping"? I want to start at a specific freq and increase or decrease the frequency over time until another freq is reached (e.g. to create a simple siren)...  [08:36:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	rgareus	[08:38:07] cglocke: you could automate invada's test-tone generator -- but I don't know if it's a smooth ramp. [08:38:07]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	cglocke	[08:41:17] ok thx, I'll try that :) [08:41:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	cglocke	[08:47:59] rgareus... any tip on atomation btw? :D [08:47:59]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	cglocke	[08:48:02] *automation [08:48:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	cglocke	[08:53:55] ah xD found it :) [08:53:55]

2016-10-18 04:14:09	nstewart	rgareus: had some questions about the _vamp_audio_to_midi plugin. It seems to want ONE audio region and ONE MIDI region (presumably the same size, but empty to hold the output.) I haven't been able to figure out how to create an empty midi region, and it doesn't appear that I can create one in the script. 
2016-10-18 04:14:27	nstewart	I know constructors aren't exported, but I wasn't sure how to create it looking at the bindings.
2016-10-18 04:15:28	nstewart	If the tracks are selected instead, it makes it simpler to decide where to put it I suppose. But you can't currently select one region and one track. They must be like things
2016-10-18 04:15:28		[04:15]

2016-10-18 05:18:08	IOhannes	including en (even though it doesn't do anything)
2016-10-18 05:18:43	IOhannes	i could have also just fixed the english "translation", but i think it better to just remove all occurences of the spelling error.

2016-10-18 11:45:36	rgareus	and apart from that.. it does not fit in 1920px in width :)  http://robin.linuxaudio.org/tmp/funny_midi.png

2016-10-18 11:46:45	rgareus	aah I've switched forth and back a couple of times..  it kept adding table headers

2016-10-18 11:55:32	jpt9	Is there any way to have Ardour play audio files you've imported at a different sample rate (i.e. changing both tempo/pitch), similar to changing the sample rate for a track in Audacity?
2016-10-18 11:55:59	rgareus	jpt9: there's a time-stretch tool
2016-10-18 11:56:41	rgareus	but that preserves pitch
2016-10-18 11:57:20	rgareus	the only other option is vari-speed playback -- but that's the complete session.

2016-10-18 11:58:56	jpt9	rgareus: Actually, in the list of resample methods, it's got an option for just resampling without preserving pitch.
2016-10-18 11:58:56		[11:58]
2016-10-18 11:59:44	rgareus	las: and incorrect function name on my part.

2016-10-18 12:00:14	the_CLA_2	rgareus: Doesn't the timestretch tool also have a mode that varies the pitch... I seem to remember that this had been added at some point.
2016-10-18 12:01:11	las	rgareus: should be fixed now

2016-10-18 12:05:39	las	Defcronyke: that if *their* "standard" wins, they will make a fortune on licensing fees

2016-10-18 12:12:22	rgareus	for the case at hand (auto-configure plugin chain) you also need _very_ detailed knowledge about the blocks. e.g. "How does this EQ affect signal phase depending on <parameters>"
2016-10-18 12:14:01	rgareus	I don't see auto-config happen with a random set of plugins.  they'll all come from one maker. and the  tool that does the analysis is trained (neural network) and optimized (heuristics) for the given set of plugins.

2016-10-18 23:55:22	las	[23:01:24] Defcronyke, i'm pessimistic because (a) it actually IS hard (b) the payoff is small (b) the politics are awful [23:01:24]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Defcronyke	[23:01:50] las those are fair points, but just don't say it won't happen please [23:01:50]

2016-10-18 23:55:22	las	[23:02:19] Defcronyke, everything i say should be prefixed by "i think" or "i doubt". i am not trying to say "i know" [23:02:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Defcronyke	[23:02:28] then prefix it ;) [23:02:28]

2016-10-18 23:55:22	barjac	[23:04:10] rgareus: Great, thanks :) [23:04:10]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:04:25] barjac: it's uscan compatible (machine readable latest version) [23:04:25]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:06:02] barjac: the uscan config is http://paste.debian.net/856636/  [23:06:02]

2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:06:42] barjac: it'll stop working once 5.5 is out. you only get the latest version [23:06:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	barjac	[23:07:13] rgareus: but then wget https://community.ardour.org/src/Ardour-5.5.0.tar.bz2 will work - no? [23:07:13]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:07:28] correct [23:07:28]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Defcronyke	[23:07:31] rgareus, if the current technologies make it unrealistic, the technologies will have to change once it becomes in high demand [23:07:31]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:07:51] Defcronyke: yeah, never say never. [23:07:51]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	barjac	[23:08:33] rgareus: It's for our spec file so the link is automatically tied to the version [23:08:33]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:09:42] Defcronyke: "Siri, make me a pancake." :) [23:09:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Defcronyke	[23:09:49] rgareus: anyway, I'm not totally convinced that the OP on that isn't a troll [23:09:49]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Defcronyke	[23:10:27] seems like they start all the threads these days [23:10:27]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	tom-	[23:10:53] plugins that somehow do hard work and then share their results is not totally absurd [23:10:53]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	tom-	[23:11:56] i've just read the "plugins future" thread [23:11:56]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Defcronyke	[23:12:07] that's the one I'm talking about [23:12:07]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:12:15] barjac: so that'll break once ardour updates, but the spec file is not updated -- unless you mirror the source [23:12:15]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	tom-	[23:12:30] and was speculating Defcronyke was the one of that thread :) [23:12:30]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:12:33] barjac: las-at-work had a strong opinion about not making old versions available, so that's what it's now. [23:12:33]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Defcronyke	[23:12:42] tom- i am Jeremy [23:12:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Defcronyke	[23:12:58] not the OP [23:12:58]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	tom-	[23:13:13] okie [23:13:13]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	tom-	[23:13:54] not a troll i think [23:13:54]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	tom-	[23:14:38] maybe a bit fuzzy, more like a broad field of generic "networked nodes" stuff [23:14:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	barjac	[23:14:53] rgareus: Well old versions will be in our svn so it's not an issue - just makes updates much easier for maintainer (me) when a new release comes out. [23:14:53]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:15:44] barjac: yeah, the debian team wanted the same -- which is why I've hacked that /src/ page.   [23:15:44]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	barjac	[23:16:18] rgareus: :) Thanks [23:16:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:16:48] the tar ball is also the /last step of a release  (git tag is the very first;   debian wrongly watched github's tags) [23:16:48]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:17:22] if something goes amiss after the tag ... release builds .. testing   ....  NO TAR BALL  ; start over  -> debian was screwed (happend with ardour 5.2) [23:17:22]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:20:53] Defcronyke: personally, I'd also rather have a good overdrive and amp-sim first that can match the Fender Twin here.  Rather than a couple of crap plugins talking to each other... [23:20:53]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:21:34] just to set priorities straight. [23:21:34]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:22:02] and nylon guitar strings that don't need 5 hours or re-tuning after changing them... please! [23:22:02]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Defcronyke	[23:22:06] hehe okay [23:22:06]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Defcronyke	[23:22:28] yes unless our time on the earth was infinite, we have to consider priorities [23:22:28]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:24:19] well, dreams and crazy ideas are important. [23:24:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Defcronyke	[23:24:45] so first priority should be solving death [23:24:45]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Defcronyke	[23:25:11] second, space colonization so the earth doesn't fill up too much from the first [23:25:11]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	rgareus	[23:25:18] that'll create more problems than it's worth :) [23:25:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tom-	[23:28:13] from a plugins' host perspective, plugins that self-organize must look like a flash-mob :) [23:28:13]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Defcronyke	[23:32:46] solving death though... nah I'll just produce with Ardour [23:32:46]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tom-	[00:04:51] las: can you hear me? [00:04:51]

2016-10-19 00:08:22	touil76	Hello everyone. I'm experiencing a problem when trying to load an ardour 2 session into ardour 4: I get a window saying :
2016-10-19 00:08:42	touil76	"session {name of my session} did not load successfully: Cannot configure audio/midi engine with session parameters"
2016-10-19 00:09:18	touil76	Would there be a trick to get ardour 4 opening my previous work ?
2016-10-19 00:09:41	nick_m	touil76, u think you'd have a better chance with 5.4

2016-10-19 00:10:26		[00:10]
2016-10-19 00:11:22	touil76	It is weird because other work that were made with ardour 2 are opened without problem with ardour 4
2016-10-19 00:13:49	touil76	I still have an installation of ardour 2 on another computer. Is there a way to export this session with ardour 2 in a special format so that it could be then imported with ardour 4 ?

2016-10-19 00:41:23	rgareus	[23:03:50] barjac: https://community.ardour.org/src/ [23:03:50]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	barjac	[23:04:10] rgareus: Great, thanks :) [23:04:10]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	rgareus	[23:04:25] barjac: it's uscan compatible (machine readable latest version) [23:04:25]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	rgareus	[23:06:02] barjac: the uscan config is http://paste.debian.net/856636/  [23:06:02]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	barjac	[23:06:16] rgareus: wget https://community.ardour.org/src/Ardour-5.4.0.tar.bz2 works - that's all I need :) [23:06:16]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	rgareus	[23:06:42] barjac: it'll stop working once 5.5 is out. you only get the latest version [23:06:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	barjac	[23:07:13] rgareus: but then wget https://community.ardour.org/src/Ardour-5.5.0.tar.bz2 will work - no? [23:07:13]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	rgareus	[23:07:28] correct [23:07:28]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	Defcronyke	[23:07:31] rgareus, if the current technologies make it unrealistic, the technologies will have to change once it becomes in high demand [23:07:31]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	rgareus	[23:07:51] Defcronyke: yeah, never say never. [23:07:51]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	barjac	[23:08:33] rgareus: It's for our spec file so the link is automatically tied to the version [23:08:33]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	rgareus	[23:09:42] Defcronyke: "Siri, make me a pancake." :) [23:09:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	Defcronyke	[23:09:49] rgareus: anyway, I'm not totally convinced that the OP on that isn't a troll [23:09:49]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	Defcronyke	[23:10:27] seems like they start all the threads these days [23:10:27]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	tom-	[23:10:53] plugins that somehow do hard work and then share their results is not totally absurd [23:10:53]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	tom-	[23:11:56] i've just read the "plugins future" thread [23:11:56]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	Defcronyke	[23:12:07] that's the one I'm talking about [23:12:07]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	rgareus	[23:12:15] barjac: so that'll break once ardour updates, but the spec file is not updated -- unless you mirror the source [23:12:15]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	tom-	[23:12:30] and was speculating Defcronyke was the one of that thread :) [23:12:30]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	rgareus	[23:12:33] barjac: las-at-work had a strong opinion about not making old versions available, so that's what it's now. [23:12:33]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	Defcronyke	[23:12:42] tom- i am Jeremy [23:12:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	Defcronyke	[23:12:58] not the OP [23:12:58]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	tom-	[23:13:13] okie [23:13:13]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	tom-	[23:13:54] not a troll i think [23:13:54]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	tom-	[23:14:38] maybe a bit fuzzy, more like a broad field of generic "networked nodes" stuff [23:14:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	barjac	[23:14:53] rgareus: Well old versions will be in our svn so it's not an issue - just makes updates much easier for maintainer (me) when a new release comes out. [23:14:53]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	rgareus	[23:15:44] barjac: yeah, the debian team wanted the same -- which is why I've hacked that /src/ page.   [23:15:44]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	barjac	[23:16:18] rgareus: :) Thanks [23:16:18]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	rgareus	[23:16:48] the tar ball is also the /last step of a release  (git tag is the very first;   debian wrongly watched github's tags) [23:16:48]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	rgareus	[23:17:22] if something goes amiss after the tag ... release builds .. testing   ....  NO TAR BALL  ; start over  -> debian was screwed (happend with ardour 5.2) [23:17:22]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	rgareus	[23:20:53] Defcronyke: personally, I'd also rather have a good overdrive and amp-sim first that can match the Fender Twin here.  Rather than a couple of crap plugins talking to each other... [23:20:53]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	rgareus	[23:21:34] just to set priorities straight. [23:21:34]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	rgareus	[23:22:02] and nylon guitar strings that don't need 5 hours or re-tuning after changing them... please! [23:22:02]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	Defcronyke	[23:22:06] hehe okay [23:22:06]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	Defcronyke	[23:22:28] yes unless our time on the earth was infinite, we have to consider priorities [23:22:28]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	rgareus	[23:24:19] well, dreams and crazy ideas are important. [23:24:19]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	Defcronyke	[23:24:45] so first priority should be solving death [23:24:45]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	Defcronyke	[23:25:11] second, space colonization so the earth doesn't fill up too much from the first [23:25:11]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	rgareus	[23:25:18] that'll create more problems than it's worth :) [23:25:18]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	tom-	[23:28:13] from a plugins' host perspective, plugins that self-organize must look like a flash-mob :) [23:28:13]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	Defcronyke	[23:32:46] solving death though... nah I'll just produce with Ardour [23:32:46]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	tom-	[00:04:51] las: can you hear me? [00:04:51]

2016-10-19 00:41:24	touil76	[10:08:22] Hello everyone. I'm experiencing a problem when trying to load an ardour 2 session into ardour 4: I get a window saying : [10:08:22]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	touil76	[10:08:42] "session {name of my session} did not load successfully: Cannot configure audio/midi engine with session parameters" [10:08:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	touil76	[10:09:18] Would there be a trick to get ardour 4 opening my previous work ? [10:09:18]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	nick_m	[10:09:41] touil76, u think you'd have a better chance with 5.4 [10:09:41]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	touil76	[10:10:26] Maybe, but I would prefer to stick with the version provided with my ubuntu installation. [10:10:26]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	touil76	[10:11:22] It is weird because other work that were made with ardour 2 are opened without problem with ardour 4 [10:11:22]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	touil76	[10:13:48] I still have an installation of ardour 2 on another computer. Is there a way to export this session with ardour 2 in a special format so that it could be then imported with ardour 4 ? [10:13:48]

2016-10-19 05:49:33	nstewart	rgareus: thanks for the "draw region" tip - was able to replicate my manual import from SV's use of the plugin. 
2016-10-19 05:49:53	rgareus	nstewart: cool.
2016-10-19 05:49:55	nstewart	Now that I can kick the process off - I guess its time to look at how to refine it. 
2016-10-19 05:50:20	rgareus	nstewart: there's currently no GUI (to allow users to set settings of a lua plugin)  -- except instantiaion parameters for action- scripts
2016-10-19 05:50:55	nstewart	especially since SV can do a pretty good job at categorizing chord changes - seems like knowing "we" are in "G major" could help polyphonic transcription a bunch.
2016-10-19 05:51:01	rgareus	nstewart: that's also something to be done. -- though in this case it's proabaly less important since the  qm-transcription plugin has no parameters
2016-10-19 05:51:08	nstewart	although that info might not reside in the track being transcribed
2016-10-19 05:51:30	rgareus	yes  SV is definitly some miles ahead there
2016-10-19 05:52:51	rgareus	then again, meta-data tracks in ardour are coming closer by the day,   and exposing more of the API as lua-bindings is also underway.
2016-10-19 05:53:10	nstewart	wonder if you could beat the transcribed part against the original for error detection
2016-10-19 05:53:31	nstewart	certainly here it when you play the two parts together
2016-10-19 05:53:33	nstewart	hear
2016-10-19 05:56:16	rgareus	that's not a bad idea.

2016-10-19 06:25:06	las	king_: since JACK could use ALSA, OSS, FFADO, etc.
2016-10-19 06:25:33	king_	where do i select that from the start up manual in adour because i dont see that optiuon?

2016-10-19 06:35:58	king_	i went on youtube and and put in some commands for realtime useage and that still didnt work

2016-10-19 06:37:35	las	king_: you must still have your system set up correctly

2016-10-19 06:41:25	king_	like lmms?

2016-10-19 06:41:45	las	king_: how much clearer can i make this?
2016-10-19 06:42:16	las	king_: if you mean "does ardour have all the instruments etc. to make electronic beat-centric music, without using JACK to connect to other tools", then the answer is "maybe"
2016-10-19 06:42:32	king_	i understand im saying can i use synthesiers ?
2016-10-19 06:42:59	las	king_: they would have to be plugins
2016-10-19 06:43:07	las	king_: and you would install them separately from ardour
2016-10-19 06:43:18	las	king_: you may or may not be satisfied with the options available
2016-10-19 06:43:19	the_CLA	...or external hardware.
2016-10-19 06:43:41	las	king_: Ardour 5.4 comes with a synth plugin that can load SF2 soundfonts; no other built-in sound generation
2016-10-19 06:44:41	king_	so its better to make the beat on another program and just do the vocal nd mixing on ardour?
2016-10-19 06:44:51	las	king_: there's no answer to that question
2016-10-19 06:44:55	las	king_: let's put it this way
2016-10-19 06:45:15	las	king_: ardour is currently more focused on being used to record, edit and mix people actually playing instruments
2016-10-19 06:45:31	las	king_: some people do use it to do "electronic music production" without other tools
2016-10-19 06:45:35	king_	ok ok now i get it
2016-10-19 06:45:42	king_	similar to pro tools
2016-10-19 06:45:51	las	king_: yes, closer to PT, further from Ableton Live

2016-10-19 09:50:59	rgareus	and the issue that is solved in 3.3.5 has been around for > 18months. so you might just as well wait until Ubuntu gets around to update the lib.

2016-10-19 10:39:54	 *	Bollie is a bitwig user
2016-10-19 10:40:25	ktao	my question is how to implement buses in bitwig to load a sampler into the bus instead of having several copies of it in separate tracks
2016-10-19 10:41:04	Bollie	Err
2016-10-19 10:41:08	Bollie	Good question. ;)
2016-10-19 10:41:33	Bollie	Several midi tracks that adress a sampler in a single track or bus?
2016-10-19 10:41:39	Bollie	address*
2016-10-19 10:41:46	ktao	several midi tracks
2016-10-19 10:41:52	ktao	right
2016-10-19 10:42:27	Bollie	Hm... I've never tried that... but hold on. Sounds like an interesting challenge. ;)
2016-10-19 10:42:33	ktao	as far as i understood bitwig tracks have only ch1 inside
2016-10-19 10:43:00	ktao	and ignore chns 2-16
2016-10-19 10:44:07	ktao	bitwig website also confirms it that their tracks can have only ch1 and you can't assign other chns to them
2016-10-19 10:44:30	las	the opposite of Live ... all channels available except ... you can't tell them apart
2016-10-19 10:44:41	las	something wrong with someone's thinking there, methinks
2016-10-19 10:46:42	Bollie	Hm, indeed, the sampler (I
2016-10-19 10:46:57	Bollie	Hm, indeed, the sampler (I'd rather call it sample player) only accepts a single channel.
2016-10-19 10:47:31	ktao	las: if you load something like lv2 unisono into a track but in a vst form and duplicate ch1 to ch2 and then you load a sampler into the chain of the same track and load sfs into ch 1 and ch2 and try to play, only ch1 will be played
2016-10-19 10:48:03	ktao	i solved that via carla-vst
2016-10-19 10:48:17	ktao	within carla vst you may have 16 chs
2016-10-19 10:48:53	ktao	and duplicate and do other midi operations but the track still has only ch1 and will work with the midi keyboard via that ch1

2016-10-19 10:52:14	ktao	so i wonder if there is a way to inplement a bus and have the sampler in 1 track or bus. Maybe it can be possible via some special vst if tracks can send midi messages we can add some additional midi event as a marker of a separate track and another vst will recognize those markers and assigns chs 2-16 to those notes
2016-10-19 10:56:33	ktao	Bollie: any ideas?

2016-10-19 13:35:09	Bitrunner	isn't there a way to open a project without connecting to an audio Backend?
2016-10-19 13:36:47	avlinux	Bitrunner, Can you use another Audio device? ie on onboard sound card or something?
2016-10-19 13:36:48	las	Bitrunner, why would that be possible?
2016-10-19 13:36:57	las	Bitrunner, lets figure out the problem
2016-10-19 13:37:04	las	Bitrunner, use pastebin to show the actual error output
2016-10-19 13:39:24	Bitrunner	Hmmm last message is ERROR: JACK: cannot continue execution of the processing graph (Daten�bergabe unterbrochen (broken pipe))
2016-10-19 13:39:27	Bitrunner	ERROR: JACK: graph error - calling shutdown handler
2016-10-19 13:39:52	Bitrunner	before, there are hundreds of "ERROR: JACK: cannot read server event (Erfolg)

2016-10-19 13:41:22	Bitrunner	Is there a way to double-check the project file? Some kind of validator?
2016-10-19 13:41:22	tom-	sound like wrong sampling rate or so
2016-10-19 13:41:34	las	Bitrunner, it has nothing to do with the session
2016-10-19 13:41:36	rgareus	Bitrunner: can you run ardour from the commandline?  there may be some more elaborate message.
2016-10-19 13:41:40	Bitrunner	tom-: 48 kHz should be correct fot the project

2016-10-19 13:42:33	Bitrunner	I think jackd is crashing because of "graph Error" (whatever that means, looks like some problem with patching between plugins?)
2016-10-19 13:42:42	Bitrunner	and then ardour says "no jackd - no work". 
2016-10-19 13:42:49	Bitrunner	and ALSA Backend seems not to work here
2016-10-19 13:43:28	rgareus	Bitrunner: maybe jack is still running (hence ALSA cannot start)?
2016-10-19 13:44:00	rgareus	Bitrunner: when opening the session:  try  "Safe mode: disable all plugins"  maybe
2016-10-19 13:44:17	Bitrunner	rgareus: no jackd process, maybe some pulseaudio crap I could not stop without stopping my X11 Session
2016-10-19 13:44:31	rgareus	Bitrunner: ardour's alsa backend should ask pulse to release the device
2016-10-19 13:44:37	Bitrunner	ah "safe mode" opens and complains about 2 unavailable plugins on the system
2016-10-19 13:45:11	Bitrunner	rgareus: ALSA backend gives dialog box "Konnte Audioger�t nicht �ffnen" (means: could not open Audio device)
2016-10-19 13:45:23	rgareus	ja, ich verstehe Deutsch :)
2016-10-19 13:45:25	rgareus	danke
2016-10-19 13:45:30	Bitrunner	ah kok
2016-10-19 13:45:32	Bitrunner	ok
2016-10-19 13:45:35	rgareus	Bitrunner: in any case, the issue is most likely plugin related.
2016-10-19 13:46:08	rgareus	Bitrunner: make a backup of the session (file).   launch with safe-mode,  remove some plugins,  save.  retry  without safe-mode...
2016-10-19 13:46:12	rgareus	until you find the culprit
2016-10-19 13:46:18	Bitrunner	Hmm
2016-10-19 13:46:54	avlinux	Bitrunner, Just curious, are you using Guitarix Amplifier-X?

2016-10-19 13:47:53	rgareus	well, you could also      sudo chmod 0 /usr/lib/lv2/SOMEPLUGINS.lv2   to check
2016-10-19 13:48:06	avlinux	Bitrunner, Ok, never mind..
2016-10-19 13:48:20	Bitrunner	Ah safe mode says "graph error" as well but then opens the project complaining about missing calf 5 Band eq and calf gate then
2016-10-19 13:49:03	rgareus	BSE
2016-10-19 13:49:27	rgareus	Bitrunner: "graph error" is odd though. 
2016-10-19 13:49:58	Bitrunner	Hmm second try . "graph "ERror" - "cannot open projec" - and back to open Project dialog
2016-10-19 13:50:16	rgareus	maybe a duplicate installation of jack?  or jack is running out of ports..
2016-10-19 13:50:40	rgareus	Bitrunner: which version of ardour is that? 
2016-10-19 13:50:40	Bitrunner	hmmm

2016-10-19 20:40:04	avlinux	[23:48:06] Bitrunner, Ok, never mind.. [23:48:06]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	Bitrunner	[23:48:20] Ah safe mode says "graph error" as well but then opens the project complaining about missing calf 5 Band eq and calf gate then [23:48:20]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	rgareus	[23:49:03] BSE [23:49:03]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	rgareus	[23:49:27] Bitrunner: "graph error" is odd though.  [23:49:27]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	Bitrunner	[23:49:58] Hmm second try . "graph "ERror" - "cannot open projec" - and back to open Project dialog [23:49:58]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	rgareus	[23:50:16] maybe a duplicate installation of jack?  or jack is running out of ports.. [23:50:16]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	rgareus	[23:50:40] Bitrunner: which version of ardour is that?  [23:50:40]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	Bitrunner	[23:50:40] hmmm [23:50:40]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	Bitrunner	[23:50:56] ok, have to sleep now. Will analyze that tomorrow, maybe reboot the machine [23:50:56]

2016-10-19 20:40:04	the_CLA	[23:51:27] rgareus: How many ports does Ardour configure when starting jack from it? [23:51:27]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	Bitrunner	[23:51:28] und thx anyway [23:51:28]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	rgareus	[23:51:48] the_CLA: I don't think ardour asks for a specific port-count [23:51:48]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	rgareus	[23:52:18] the_CLA: so jack's default (or whatever's in jack's config) [23:52:18]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	rgareus	[23:52:37] in jackdbus' case  ~/.config/jack/conf.xml [23:52:37]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	 *	rgareus [23:53:16] never launches jack using ardour's dialog [23:53:16]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	the_CLA	[23:53:22] Here man jackd sais the default is 256 - could be a bit low indeed, I guess. [23:53:22]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	 *	the_CLA [23:54:40] has qjackctl configured to start it with 1024 ports. [23:54:40]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	avlinux	[00:05:40] the_CLA, That's a lot of ports, what about your workflow in particular influences a need for more ports? High track counts? [00:05:40]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	the_CLA	[00:07:56] avlinux: Not that overly high counts, but I once ran out of ports many years ago, and I simply like to have some headroom. [00:07:56]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	avlinux	[00:09:44] the_CLA, Makes sense, I use the same philosophy for timeouts and set them high after a JACK Zombie apocalypse session one time [00:09:44]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	the_CLA	[00:10:05] avlinux: Same here with timeouts. [00:10:05]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	avlinux	[00:11:13] the_CLA, I have them set to 2000 by default in AV Linux, perhaps I should consider upping the default ports settings.. [00:11:13]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	the_CLA	[00:12:54] avlinux: Looking again I currently have the timeout set to 500 ms for the regular profile. [00:12:54]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	 *	avlinux [00:13:28] better go and get ready for the horrors of the presidential debate... see y'all! [00:13:28]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	the_CLA	[00:13:37] Ah, no - that was only the internal soundcard... ;) [00:13:37]
2016-10-19 20:40:04	the_CLA	[00:13:59] USB I upped it to 10000 ms - so it's also better when debugging in gdb... [00:13:59]

2016-10-20 00:25:33	avlinux	[23:48:06] Bitrunner, Ok, never mind.. [23:48:06]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	Bitrunner	[23:48:20] Ah safe mode says "graph error" as well but then opens the project complaining about missing calf 5 Band eq and calf gate then [23:48:20]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	rgareus	[23:49:03] BSE [23:49:03]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	rgareus	[23:49:27] Bitrunner: "graph error" is odd though.  [23:49:27]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	Bitrunner	[23:49:58] Hmm second try . "graph "ERror" - "cannot open projec" - and back to open Project dialog [23:49:58]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	rgareus	[23:50:16] maybe a duplicate installation of jack?  or jack is running out of ports.. [23:50:16]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	rgareus	[23:50:40] Bitrunner: which version of ardour is that?  [23:50:40]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	Bitrunner	[23:50:40] hmmm [23:50:40]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	Bitrunner	[23:50:56] ok, have to sleep now. Will analyze that tomorrow, maybe reboot the machine [23:50:56]

2016-10-20 00:25:33	the_CLA	[23:51:27] rgareus: How many ports does Ardour configure when starting jack from it? [23:51:27]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	Bitrunner	[23:51:28] und thx anyway [23:51:28]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	rgareus	[23:51:48] the_CLA: I don't think ardour asks for a specific port-count [23:51:48]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	rgareus	[23:52:18] the_CLA: so jack's default (or whatever's in jack's config) [23:52:18]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	rgareus	[23:52:37] in jackdbus' case  ~/.config/jack/conf.xml [23:52:37]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	 *	rgareus [23:53:16] never launches jack using ardour's dialog [23:53:16]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	the_CLA	[23:53:22] Here man jackd sais the default is 256 - could be a bit low indeed, I guess. [23:53:22]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	 *	the_CLA [23:54:40] has qjackctl configured to start it with 1024 ports. [23:54:40]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	avlinux	[00:05:40] the_CLA, That's a lot of ports, what about your workflow in particular influences a need for more ports? High track counts? [00:05:40]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	the_CLA	[00:07:56] avlinux: Not that overly high counts, but I once ran out of ports many years ago, and I simply like to have some headroom. [00:07:56]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	avlinux	[00:09:44] the_CLA, Makes sense, I use the same philosophy for timeouts and set them high after a JACK Zombie apocalypse session one time [00:09:44]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	the_CLA	[00:10:05] avlinux: Same here with timeouts. [00:10:05]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	avlinux	[00:11:13] the_CLA, I have them set to 2000 by default in AV Linux, perhaps I should consider upping the default ports settings.. [00:11:13]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	the_CLA	[00:12:54] avlinux: Looking again I currently have the timeout set to 500 ms for the regular profile. [00:12:54]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	 *	avlinux [00:13:28] better go and get ready for the horrors of the presidential debate... see y'all! [00:13:28]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	the_CLA	[00:13:37] Ah, no - that was only the internal soundcard... ;) [00:13:37]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	the_CLA	[00:13:59] USB I upped it to 10000 ms - so it's also better when debugging in gdb... [00:13:59]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	rhydermike	[00:15:29] Building tonight's git build. I'll see if that note skipping bug is stilla around. [00:15:29]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	las	[00:21:38] rhydermike, no work has been done to fix it, AFAIK [00:21:38]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	rhydermike	[00:21:52] ah [00:21:52]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	rhydermike	[00:23:01] Be ironic if a new style of music emerged that omited the kick drum on the 1 beat due to that bug. [00:23:01]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	Stuzz	[00:29:38] There's no shortage of styles that do that (and everything else) already [00:29:38]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	las	[00:41:43] rhydermike, that would be called "good music" :) [00:41:43]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	las	[00:41:53] rhydermike, all good music has the emphasis on the 2 and the 4 [00:41:53]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	las	[00:42:01] rhydermike, all bad music has the emphasis on the 1 and the 2 [00:42:01]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	rhydermike	[00:43:25] heh [00:43:25]

2016-10-20 00:25:33	rgareus	[00:48:38] what's the movie with some black guy:  "I had this horrible nightmare last night....   I could only clap on the 2 and 4" [00:48:38]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	rgareus	[00:49:12] maybe a scene from Uncle Tom's Cabin. [00:49:12]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	Stuzz	[01:05:13] Err..  Aren't you supposed to clap on 2 and 4? [01:05:13]

2016-10-20 00:25:33	las	[01:07:38] but yes, almost any music with a real groove has the emphasis on the 2 and the 4 [01:07:38]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	las	[01:07:49] some surf music is an exception [01:07:49]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	rgareus	[01:08:04] Stuzz: try 1+, 3+, 4 [01:08:04]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	Stuzz	[01:09:13] rgareus: Wazzat now? [01:09:13]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	nstewart	[01:52:22] I killed the qm-polyphonic-transcription plugin.  [01:52:22]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	nstewart	[01:55:51] it appears it just ran out of memory but ... I have 24gb ram.  and I've never been able to use most of it [01:55:51]
2016-10-20 00:25:33	nstewart	[02:27:16] yeah. qm-transcription crashes if you give it 11m worth of wav to chew on. even in SV. Running valgrind on it now, looks like it'll be a while.

2016-10-20 01:38:48	sHARPY_	Hi - In a nut shell I can't get any plugins to show in Adour. I'm not a linux expert but pretty reasonable with IT.  Seems to be a LV2 path issue but tried setting it but the Calf plugin I have down loaded will not show - hours spent - very tierd of this issue!
2016-10-20 01:39:07	sHARPY_	I have the basic plugings supllied with the software
2016-10-20 01:40:07	sHARPY_	Ubuntu 16.04 - Ardour 5.0.0 - Start up with JACK service

2016-10-20 01:43:04	rgareus	sHARPY_: in a terminal, run:      lv2ls        that will list all lv2-plugins
2016-10-20 01:43:12	the_CLA_2	sHARPY_: Did you install the plugins via the package manager?
2016-10-20 01:44:23	-->	Sharpy__ (5ec31341@gateway/web/freenode/ip.94.195.19.65) has joined #ardour
2016-10-20 01:44:25	rgareus	actually what the_CLA_2 suggests is way easier, especially if you're new to linux.
2016-10-20 01:48:00	sHARPY_	OK - Done this in the terminal and says not installed - lol....
2016-10-20 01:48:05	sHARPY_	Now installed
2016-10-20 01:49:40	sHARPY_	Ok - installed and lists them when I run the command lv2ls
2016-10-20 01:49:42	rgareus	sHARPY_: how did you install the calf-plugins?  did you get them from Ubuntu's software-center?
2016-10-20 01:49:47	sHARPY_	not showing to Ardour yet
2016-10-20 01:50:04	rgareus	sHARPY_: you need to restart Ardour to pick up new plugins.
2016-10-20 01:50:48	sHARPY_	I think (but not sure as it was a few nights ago) was NOT via Ubuntu S/W center
2016-10-20 01:51:57	rgareus	sHARPY_:  I suggest to install     calf-plugins zam-plugins x42-plugins    using the S/C centre
2016-10-20 01:52:33	rgareus	also search for "LV2" and "LADSPA"  there are a couple of more packages that provide pluins,  but above 3 should get you started at least
2016-10-20 01:52:43	Headwar	rgareus, doesn't the calf-plugins from ubuntu's SC have an issue with fftw3 ?
2016-10-20 01:52:53	rgareus	Headwar: probably.
2016-10-20 01:53:40	Headwar	so maybe installing it from SC is not optimal imho
2016-10-20 01:53:54	rgareus	Headwar: ..and not only that..  my thoughts on calf DSP in general can't be written down.
2016-10-20 01:54:19	Headwar	though I already read it ;) and saw the graphs
2016-10-20 01:55:02	sHARPY_	Ah - at the end of the day I am just after a half decent (simpler) set of effects but mostly a decent reverb...
2016-10-20 01:55:06	ristic	nick_m: Thanks for the commits, unfortunately it seems the action of inserting time is not working now: http://tracker.ardour.org/view.php?id=7072

2016-10-20 01:55:08	Headwar	but just in the context of helping sHARPY_, maybe it should be said that he'd rather get them from git or KX repos
2016-10-20 01:55:12	rgareus	Headwar: graphs are fine :)  bug-reports and and solid objective criticism..
2016-10-20 01:55:58	sHARPY_	gonna try this lot first as a bit desparate today - band round tonight.........eek
2016-10-20 01:56:00	sHARPY_	zam-plugins x42-plugins
2016-10-20 01:56:16	the_CLA_2	I also would suggest trying other alternatives rather than Calf first.
2016-10-20 01:56:16		[01:56]
2016-10-20 01:56:22	Headwar	rgareus, because of your criticism, I'm trying my best to avoid them now, even though they were my go-tos before

2016-10-20 01:57:27	Headwar	sHARPY_, do you know of kx repositories ?

2016-10-20 03:43:48	Headwar	Sure is !
2016-10-20 03:44:17	IOhannes	if you have a multi-arch system (mixing i686 and amd64) you need a way to keep the binaries separate
2016-10-20 03:44:42	IOhannes	unfortunately the LV2 specs predate any multi-arch attempts

2016-10-20 03:45:16	IOhannes	but to be honest: most plugin specs i know of have the same problem
2016-10-20 03:45:26	tartina	yes on Fedora too
2016-10-20 03:45:50	IOhannes	tartina: ok, so you have your precious amd64 LV2 binaries in /usr/lib/lv2
2016-10-20 03:46:02	IOhannes	and then you install ardour5:i386
2016-10-20 03:46:03	Headwar	IOhannes, does 'export LV2_PATH' keep the setting after a reboot ?
2016-10-20 03:46:11	IOhannes	Headwar: no
2016-10-20 03:46:39	Headwar	how to keep it after a reboot then ? (interesting for sHARPY_ )
2016-10-20 03:46:42	IOhannes	tartina: so how is ardour5:i386 supposed to find any suitable LV2 binaries?
2016-10-20 03:46:48	IOhannes	put it into .profile

2016-10-20 04:18:25	rgareus	so you can copy plugin bundles across systems
2016-10-20 04:18:38	tartina	IOhannes: nothing
2016-10-20 04:18:57	rgareus	host support for this is lacking (except on OSX)  but that's just because we're all lazy :)
2016-10-20 04:20:48	IOhannes	actually, i'
2016-10-20 04:20:51	IOhannes	m not sure i can follow
2016-10-20 04:21:02	 *	IOhannes is sure that the [Return] key is too close on this keyboard
2016-10-20 04:21:22	IOhannes	rgareus: as in: how does this differ from what we already do?
2016-10-20 04:21:51	tartina	rgareus: do you mean releasing 32 and 64 bit versions in the same bundle?
2016-10-20 04:22:04	rgareus	IOhannes: debian is fine so far. plugins are in /usr/lib/lv2
2016-10-20 04:22:40	IOhannes	rgareus: so what would be needed to make the multi-arch capable
2016-10-20 04:22:49	tartina	rgareus: Fedora is not, plugins are in /usr/lib64/lv2 for 64 bit and /usr/lib/lv2 for 32 bit
2016-10-20 04:22:49	IOhannes	that is: co-installable for multiple archs
2016-10-20 04:22:50	rgareus	IOhannes: given the regexp, I was under the impression you're moving them to /usr/lib/<arch-triplet>/lv2
2016-10-20 04:24:11	IOhannes	rgareus: i'm not moving anything; i was merely trying to fix the suggestion by Headwar who was trying to fix a package that was (supposedly) installing into /usr/lib/<arch-triplet>/lv2
2016-10-20 04:24:16	rgareus	you cah have  all binaries inside   /usr/lib/lv2/SomePlugin.v2/    plugin.i386-linux-gnu.so   plugin.osx.dylib  plugin.dll
2016-10-20 04:24:24	rgareus	all inside the bundle
2016-10-20 04:24:45	tartina	rgareus: the host should pick the right one
2016-10-20 04:24:45		[04:24]
2016-10-20 04:24:57	IOhannes	rgareus: not very feasible from a distro pov
2016-10-20 04:25:08	rgareus	tartina: yes, you can have multiple  lv2:binary <>  ihe manifest
2016-10-20 04:25:34	rgareus	the spec is in place for that.  but host support lacking :(
2016-10-20 04:25:34	IOhannes	that is: if you build each arch separately
2016-10-20 04:26:11	IOhannes	but wouldn't that work out of the box: /usr/lib/lv2/SomePlugin.<arch-triplet>.lv2/ ?
2016-10-20 04:26:17	tartina	as IOhannes said distros would not accept this
2016-10-20 04:26:22	rgareus	or maybe not.  I'll have to re-check liblilv.   it may just try to dlopen() all and go with the first that loads
2016-10-20 04:26:43	the_CLA_2	Making that stuff multi arch capable on the distro side sounds like a huge mess to me. Far more room for user errors.
2016-10-20 04:27:22	rgareus	the_CLA_2: you do have a point
2016-10-20 04:27:42	tartina	the_CLA_2: I agree, and I see no reason for a 64 bit system to have 32 bit too
2016-10-20 04:27:57	IOhannes	the_CLA_2: the alternative is to not multi-archify a given plugin. which means that you cannot have hosts of different archs installed on the system and both use plugins
2016-10-20 04:28:11	tartina	or worse for a linux system to have osx libraries
2016-10-20 04:28:35	the_CLA_2	I guess the only reason why someone might want to use multi arch for audio would be the use of some commercial stuff that might not be available on the original arch of the system.
2016-10-20 04:28:56	IOhannes	the_CLA_2: i don't see any good reason to have anything but linux/x86_64/gnu
2016-10-20 04:28:59	IOhannes	but others disagree
2016-10-20 04:29:00	rgareus	it's indeed mainly useful for proprietary plugins
2016-10-20 04:29:29	rgareus	you could symlink  $PREFIX/lib/lv2 
2016-10-20 04:29:37	rgareus	to the given arch

2016-10-20 04:31:21	rgareus	jack can no longer run mixed applications these days

2016-10-20 04:32:01	IOhannes	and your host app could just be an offline renderer, not requiring jack at all
2016-10-20 04:33:21	IOhannes	so you are (ab)using democratic principles (to suppress minorities) based on numbers out of thin air? erm...
2016-10-20 04:33:24	IOhannes	:-)
2016-10-20 04:33:49	rgareus	certianly not.
2016-10-20 04:34:05	rgareus	those users know what they're doing and don't want to be nannied by distros anyway.
2016-10-20 04:34:23	IOhannes	tartina: btw, on fedora you might just hardcode LV2_PATH=/usr/lib64/lv2:/usr/lib/lv2 because there are no other architectures anyhow
2016-10-20 04:34:28	IOhannes	rgareus: not necessarily.

2016-10-20 04:36:07	IOhannes	if you have your perfect "making music" machine in your studio, that is 64bit only and offline for security and procrastination reasons, then you are probably right
2016-10-20 04:39:15	the_CLA_2	I think if someone really wants or needs to use audio stuff from a different arch, they should know how to handle this and setup environment variables and other stuff for that themselves. This is really an advanced topic, and I don't think that it is the distribution's task to solve it.
2016-10-20 04:41:27	the_CLA_2	At least that would be better than adding additional ways to probably mess up the regular setup.
2016-10-20 04:41:27		[04:41]
2016-10-20 04:43:17	IOhannes	i'm aware that i look like a stupid troll, for continuing this thread.
2016-10-20 04:43:20	IOhannes	but my point really is that distros (like Debian) are already way down the path to allow people to use "stuff" from multiple archs. that's totally unrelated to "audio stuff". but if this just works for the other "stuff", why should the "audio stuff" *not* work?
2016-10-20 04:45:55	the_CLA_2	IOhannes: I guess the problem is that - in comparison to for example running google earth - the audio stuff often involves multiple software elements, like jack, host, plugins, maybe others, that makes it far more complex to use. Is there already anything else that compares to such a mixed setup?
2016-10-20 04:49:15	IOhannes	but i really wonder: adding an arch-specifier to the bundle-name (e.g. x86_64-linux-gnu.fat1.lv2 instead of fat1.lv2) and just put these into the standard paths (/usr/lib/lv2/) should allow to co-install plugins for multiple archs *and* work out of the box with all the existing hosts.
2016-10-20 04:49:24	IOhannes	what would the catch be?
2016-10-20 04:52:11	rgareus	IOhannes: no it won't :(
2016-10-20 04:52:43	rgareus	IOhannes: a host would scan all manifests. in /usr/lib/lv2  
2016-10-20 04:52:57	rgareus	and the URIs will show up as duplicates
2016-10-20 04:53:55	nick_m	ristic, your regions do not move at all? even after selecting the menu item?
2016-10-20 04:53:57	rgareus	in which case liblilv will use the one with the latest version  in the manifest or in case of ambiguity the first one that was scanned
2016-10-20 04:54:16	IOhannes	because the .so file is not dlopen()ed until requested (which is long after the list was created)?
2016-10-20 04:54:56	rgareus	yes, it's only dlopen()ed when used
2016-10-20 04:55:08	rgareus	which could be "never" for some plugins.

2016-10-20 05:00:09	nick_m	ristic, initially the dialog ignores mouse position. the duration calculation does not do that.
2016-10-20 05:00:30	IOhannes	rgareus: darn
2016-10-20 05:00:50	nick_m	ristic, but if this were the problem, you would be able to do it using the playhead edit position
2016-10-20 05:01:12	ristic	nick_m: Regions are not glued.
2016-10-20 05:01:38	nick_m	ristic, what bbt duration dod you put in?
2016-10-20 05:02:27	the_CLA_2	IOhannes: I'd say just leave it as is and don't worry about it. ;)
2016-10-20 05:03:53	IOhannes	the_CLA_2: that's because you are probably not involved in packaging :-)

2016-10-20 05:07:07	the_CLA_2	IOhannes: Probably. But don't you generally just package and the package management system does the multi arch stuff itself when installing on a system? *not very familiar with this*
2016-10-20 05:07:10	ristic	Maybe I'm doing something wrong, idk

2016-10-20 05:10:45	nick_m	ristic, ok so i guess before, any region that was covering the playhead was moved? i expected that only the regions at or after the playhead would be moved

2016-10-20 05:12:40	nick_m	ristic, if there was another region after this one, would it be moved?

2016-10-20 05:18:31	nick_m	not sure how..
2016-10-20 05:18:46	ristic	Also, what I was thinking is to remove the options that don't currently work.
2016-10-20 05:19:00	nick_m	ristic, which ones?
2016-10-20 05:19:12	ristic	Fro example the move tempo and meters checkbox, it currently says something like this may mess up your tempo map.
2016-10-20 05:19:36	ristic	I don't think many users are going to try that option.
2016-10-20 05:20:10	nick_m	ristic, well it works, but moving a meter by a fixed number of frames decidedly won't work.
2016-10-20 05:20:30	ristic	The other ones I need to test now that you have made these changes to see if they are working. I remember in the past some things not doing what I expected.

2016-10-20 12:21:26	nstewart	rgareus:  how does exception handling work for vamp plugins? If I kill it - how should we recover?
2016-10-20 12:22:40	nstewart	I fed my 11Mb guitar track to qm-transcription and it barfed. (Not sure why - I had enough memory for what it died on, but it was a bad alloc).  
2016-10-20 12:23:17	rgareus	nstewart: no immediate idea, I'd have to check the source
2016-10-20 12:23:20	nstewart	No problem, I fed it to rhythm ferret first, modified the lua script to grab the midi region, and iterate over the audio regions.  Now it blows up, kills ardour, and I don't get a stack trace even if I attach my debugger before
2016-10-20 12:23:49	rgareus	nstewart: ./ardbg # ?
2016-10-20 12:25:18	nstewart	?
2016-10-20 12:28:11	nstewart	ok, only did a couple regions, and my region loop works, but in the output I get some MIDI notes playing when there are no MIDI notes showing in the region.
2016-10-20 12:29:53	rgareus	nstewart: in the ardour-src dir, after compiling it;     cd gtk2_ardour; ./ardbg    # runs ardour inside gdb
2016-10-20 12:30:01	rgareus	that's handy to get backtraces
2016-10-20 12:30:38	rgareus	or ./arval # to run it in valgrind  ;   or just   ./ardev    to run it from the source-dir
2016-10-20 12:30:42	nstewart	ah - what I normally do is launch it, get everything set up, then do a gdb -p `pidof ardour5-xx`.

2016-10-20 17:38:00		[17:32]
2016-10-20 17:38:36	las_	nstewart_, it is not a "Location"
2016-10-20 17:39:01	las_	nstewart_, start defines the offset within the Region's Source(s) where the first data for Region can be found
2016-10-20 17:39:10	las_	nstewart_, modifying the length will never change the start
2016-10-20 17:40:41	nstewart_	sorry that wsn't clear. I was modifying both start and length. expecting the start and end to move
2016-10-20 17:41:03	Ricardus	OvenWerks, do we really need more? All I need is a strong EQ, compressor, delay, etc... and I'm good.
2016-10-20 17:41:32	las_	nstewart_, a region has 3 fundamental properties: start, length and position
2016-10-20 17:41:47	las_	nstewart_, "end" is a computed property
2016-10-20 17:41:52	nstewart_	whats the difference in start and position?
2016-10-20 17:42:10	las_	nstewart_, position is where the beginning of the region lives on the timeline
2016-10-20 17:42:48	nstewart_	order in the playlist it belongs to? Not the timestamp for the beginning of the region?
2016-10-20 17:44:37	las_	nstewart_, not order: position in samples on the timeline
2016-10-20 17:44:49	las_	nstewart_, look, region's have two "reference timestamps"
2016-10-20 17:44:55	las_	(1) where they begin in a source file
2016-10-20 17:45:05	las_	(2) their position on the timeline
2016-10-20 17:45:16	las_	nstewart_, these are 100% orthogonal and unrelated and independent

2016-10-20 17:46:04	las_	nstewart_, this second region has start == 5secs, position = 1 minute
2016-10-20 17:47:41	nstewart_	ok. i get it now. so if I want to just resize the region without moving contents on the time line, I need to move both position and start to avoid shifting things?

2016-10-20 17:51:12	las_	nstewart_, if you mean "chop the front off the region", then yes, you would have to adjust start  +  position
2016-10-20 17:52:57	nstewart_	If start = 0 and pos = 30 seconds. I move pos back to 20 seconds, start will have to move to 10seconds to keep it in the same place.

2016-10-20 17:53:38		[17:53]
2016-10-20 17:53:57	las_	nstewart_, there is already a way in the GUI to "slip" content inside the region, which just involves changing start and not position

2016-10-21 05:31:07	nstewart_	it looks like my next phase is dive into vamp plugins and see what I can do there.  Since qm-transcription claims to be faster than real time, feedback might be feasible.
2016-10-21 05:31:54	nstewart_	as long as there's a bunch of cleanup needed though I don't think realtime is a worthwhile goal.
2016-10-21 05:32:15	rgareus	nstewart_: git push'ed as-is. it's indeed a step forward
2016-10-21 05:32:41	rgareus	nstewart_: the problem with qm-transcript is that analysis is done at the end
2016-10-21 05:33:00	rgareus	nstewart_: and there's not even progress feedback during that stage.
2016-10-21 05:33:56	rgareus	feeding data into it is fast,  the final analyis (get remaining features) can take ages.
2016-10-21 05:34:54	rgareus	I suppose it chunking it might work
2016-10-21 05:36:34	nstewart_	by feedback I meant feedback loop in the detection algorithm. ie - beat intereference as pitch correction.  But yeah, it can take a while and some progress would be nice
2016-10-21 05:38:08	rgareus	_vamp_note_example.lua has some basic progress info -  feeding data into the plugin.

2016-10-21 08:09:01	ristic	I had done a whole bunch of mixing (adding, removing plugins, moving the playhead around during playback, adding/removing tracks/busses) which resulted in all the xruns.

2016-10-21 08:20:54	rgareus	ristic: with HT, GUI performance can be a tad better and control/automation things maybe with the CPU threads.   But if a core blocks (concurrent FPU access), linux re-schedules things
2016-10-21 08:21:35	rgareus	ristic: correct, either boot option noht   or just runtime

2016-10-21 08:48:54	ristic	It's like a tremolo, touch of overdrive and a nice lowpass combined.
2016-10-21 08:49:34	rgareus	and some chrous 
2016-10-21 08:49:43	ristic	Yep
2016-10-21 08:49:44	rgareus	it has a doppler effect
2016-10-21 08:50:04	ristic	Also been using the setbfree overdrive a fair amount.
2016-10-21 08:50:17	rgareus	really?  does that work for you?
2016-10-21 08:50:17	ristic	Works well with guitars as well.
2016-10-21 08:50:38	ristic	Yeah, for something light in the blusey sort of range.

2016-10-21 08:50:50	rgareus	it's the weakest point of setBfree. overdrives are harder than hard
2016-10-21 08:51:12	ristic	Well if it's going to improve then great :)
2016-10-21 08:52:08	rgareus	I'm 50/50  I'd like to have on that only has 1 control or maybe 2.
2016-10-21 08:52:18	ristic	My favorite thing for dirtying up a signal is "Lo Fi". I don't know where it comes from or how I installed it.
2016-10-21 08:52:50	rgareus	the Organ overdrive currently exposes the low-levels of the DSP and I never managed to collapse that down.  I was planning to go back to the drawing board
2016-10-21 08:52:58	ristic	Like a strong compressor mixed with some sort of drive that thing is.
2016-10-21 08:54:22	 *	rgareus has no "Lo Fi" plugin here

2016-10-21 09:02:10	rgareus	ristic: the a-reverb (which comes with ardour) is an overhauled stereo variant of the b_reverb (from setBfree). same DSP
2016-10-21 09:07:25	ristic	I've found it quite hard to get a decent reverb sound within the free software plugin world tbh. I really like the IR sort of reverb but it is very CPU intensive.
2016-10-21 09:10:13	rghvdberg	I like TAL Reverb II
2016-10-21 09:12:11	ristic	I've tried the TAL ones and for some reason they seem a bit plastic to me. I don't know what it is. That said, I have used them on some specific things and they have worked nicely. I can't remember what though.

2016-10-21 09:21:51	ristic	Yep, offical ardour doesn't want to load it though "because its buffer-size requirements cannot be satisfied."

2016-10-21 09:24:51	rghvdberg	ristic: and it does work in another DAW ? or plugin host (carla)
2016-10-21 09:25:35	ristic	No biggie, I can just use IR.

2016-10-21 11:34:11	rob-vir-u16	hmmm, ok thanks for pointing out
2016-10-21 11:34:29	rgareus	the generic-plugin GUI layout is pretty much fixed.  the girth of the bars is some hard-coded multiple of the font-size
2016-10-21 11:35:11	rob-vir-u16	it becomes a bit of aproblem with plugins such as tap eq/bw but I can live with that
2016-10-21 11:35:39	rob-vir-u16	also, can the colours of ladspa plugin meters be changed? e.g. tap dynamics, invada compressor (ladspa) the blue doesn't make good contrast with the dark grey background
2016-10-21 11:36:07	rgareus	last I looked Invada was LV2 and had a custom GUI.
2016-10-21 11:36:16	rgareus	but the 'meter colors' can be changed.

2016-10-21 12:34:31	MaurizioB	I've seen the latest mail from las about MIDI input follows selection, but I'm not sure I've understood what that means...
2016-10-21 12:38:18	rgareus	MaurizioB: in short: dynamic port connections.
2016-10-21 12:38:40	rgareus	MaurizioB: you can designate one midi-input-port (eg. a physical keyboard).    when you have many midi-tracks in ardour.  that keyboard is automatically connect to the selected track
2016-10-21 12:38:48	rgareus	(and disconnected from other midi tracks)
2016-10-21 12:39:53	MaurizioB	rgareus: aaaaaaah, so it's used only for instrumental midi input when recording midi within ardour, it's dynamically selected according to the current track selection?
2016-10-21 12:40:07	rgareus	yep
2016-10-21 12:40:17	MaurizioB	rgareus: got it, thanks... well, it's useful, indeed

2016-10-21 14:21:39	mc888	Ive been trying out the new version 5.4.xxx and having an issue with midi files
2016-10-21 14:22:31	mc888	midi files from old sessions are clipping the audio outpouts
2016-10-21 14:23:16	mc888	finding duplicate notes in midi track that werent there before, and it clips
2016-10-21 14:23:21	mc888	is this a known issue?
2016-10-21 14:24:24	rgareus	mc888: not really
2016-10-21 14:24:44	rgareus	mc888: however if you've used meters other than N/4  - then 5.4 has a "known issue"
2016-10-21 14:25:18	rgareus	or rather ardour 5.0 .. 5.3  did save the metrum of files always in  N/4 (quarter notes)  and there's a tool to convert those files
2016-10-21 14:26:02	mc888	right, I read about that one
2016-10-21 14:26:25	mc888	lots of updates since the last time I used this stuff
2016-10-21 14:26:26	rgareus	maybe clipping may be a side-effect of notes overlapping now  due to meter changes
2016-10-21 14:26:43	rgareus	mc888: did you use ardour 5.0 .. 5.3 ?  or did you switch from 4.7 ?
2016-10-21 14:26:54	mc888	its weird, a fresh clean midi region does fine
2016-10-21 14:27:02	mc888	I went from 4.7 to 5.4
2016-10-21 14:27:11	rgareus	ok. so this is a different issue
2016-10-21 14:27:39	mc888	oh well I needed to do better on those drum tracks anyway :)
2016-10-21 14:28:42	mc888	btw, great job on the new features
2016-10-21 14:28:42		[14:28]
2016-10-21 14:28:43	rgareus	If you have a 4.7 session that reproduces the issue, it'd be great if you could upload that to tracker.ardour.org 
2016-10-21 14:29:09	mc888	the ingen graph in a channel strip is HUGE
2016-10-21 14:29:11	rgareus	maybe tempo-ramps  or some related change
2016-10-21 14:29:31	rgareus	nick_m: any guesses ?
2016-10-21 14:30:29	rgareus	mc888: ingen as LV2 in ardour?  that's very cool and powerful.  too few users venture that path.
2016-10-21 14:30:38	mc888	yeah I was thinking of the new tempo ramp when I noticed the BBT errors
2016-10-21 14:30:55	rgareus	mc888: what do you use ingen for?  synth?
2016-10-21 14:31:19	mc888	no, I was trying to build a sungroup as a plugin
2016-10-21 14:31:27	mc888	*subgroup*
2016-10-21 14:31:32	mc888	now I can!
2016-10-21 14:32:11	rgareus	interesting. that never occured to me.
2016-10-21 14:32:12	mc888	my first project with the exposed pinout was to take a small subgroup and put the whole thing in one channel
2016-10-21 14:32:43	mc888	its just a 2-band crossover, but I can pan the tops and bypass the subs
2016-10-21 14:33:01	mc888	using balance.lv2
2016-10-21 14:33:26	rgareus	fancy
2016-10-21 14:33:35	mc888	haha yeah
2016-10-21 14:33:46	rgareus	So now with pin-management in ardour5  you can do that directly.
2016-10-21 14:35:09	mc888	yes, and I can also save the channel as a routing template
2016-10-21 14:35:16	mc888	this is HUGE\
2016-10-21 14:35:48	rgareus	well, depending on the x-over plugin's pinout,  ingen may still be easier.
2016-10-21 14:36:22	mc888	calf 2-band, its 2 in by 4 out
2016-10-21 14:36:38	mc888	so I have L and R kick drum going in
2016-10-21 14:37:12	mc888	then the outputs get doubled for the stereo bus, and tops can be panned with balance.lv2
2016-10-21 14:37:37	rgareus	OK, and you could just put 2 balance.lv2 in sequence after that  and route around  like  http://manual.ardour.org/images/left_right_eq.png
2016-10-21 14:37:48	mc888	exactly
2016-10-21 14:37:49	rgareus	still summing the result can't be done yet.
2016-10-21 14:38:06	rgareus	well, it can, via port-connections.
2016-10-21 14:38:31	mc888	8 outs just go to L and R group bus in
2016-10-21 14:38:48	mc888	I can give you the channel template if you want to check it out
2016-10-21 14:39:44	rgareus	mc888: I'll wait until Ardour6.  Where you can click on  "share track"  and I click on "get mc888's track 5" :)
2016-10-21 14:39:51	rgareus	or maybe Ardour7  who knows...
2016-10-21 14:40:00	mc888	huh? no please not 'the cloud'
2016-10-21 14:40:15	rgareus	s/the cloud/wherever/
2016-10-21 14:40:37	rgareus	archive.org  and freesound.org come to mind
2016-10-21 14:40:51	rgareus	and we won't say no to github :)
2016-10-21 14:41:36	rgareus	but we'll make sure you can also run your own server if you want to.    just http & scp/rsync

2016-10-21 14:41:59	mc888	so as long as youre here, let me ask about these plugins in the embedded graph - I only get meters or FFT on the first plugin instance 
2016-10-21 14:42:32	rgareus	mc888: can you be more specific?
2016-10-21 14:42:54	mc888	using pin assignments on plugins - like the EQ example
2016-10-21 14:43:17	mc888	if you turn on the FFT, only the top plugin in the chain will get the graphic display
2016-10-21 14:43:48	rgareus	FFT? do you mean "Plugin Analysis" in the generic plugin gui?
2016-10-21 14:43:48		[14:43]
2016-10-21 14:43:56	mc888	all the controls still work on the others, but you wont get meters on the stereo balance, or FFT in the x42 eq
2016-10-21 14:44:11	mc888	'spec'
2016-10-21 14:45:21	mc888	your eq example - turn on 'spec' in the topmost plugin, you get spec. second plugin in the chain doesnt get it
2016-10-21 14:45:39	rgareus	mc888: maybe it's set to "L" or "R" and not "All" channels?
2016-10-21 14:47:19	rgareus	mc888: can you make a screenshot? of the pin connections?
2016-10-21 14:48:14	mc888	yeah I could set it up again - on the stereo balance I dont get meters on either channel, but everything works
2016-10-21 14:48:18	rgareus	aah, do you use the Mono version..  on a stereo track?
2016-10-21 14:48:35	rgareus	ie  there multiple instances of the plugin.
2016-10-21 14:48:36	mc888	right, like the example 2 mono in a stereo track
2016-10-21 14:48:49	mc888	top of the chain gets the grahics, others dont
2016-10-21 14:48:53	rgareus	only the first instance gets GUI messages
2016-10-21 14:49:20	rgareus	use "manual config"  in the pin dialog  and remove unused instances.
2016-10-21 14:49:29	mc888	right, the controls still work from the GUI, its just displays like meters or Spec
2016-10-21 14:49:50	mc888	oh you can do that?
2016-10-21 14:50:11	rgareus	The GUI is for the "Instance #1"   and all others just are just copies..
2016-10-21 14:50:12	mc888	what if the unused instances are on the left
2016-10-21 14:50:30	mc888	it adds andf removes from the right
2016-10-21 14:50:50	mc888	just repatch then
2016-10-21 14:50:52	rgareus	yep
2016-10-21 14:50:59	rgareus	or route around. them
2016-10-21 14:51:02	mc888	ok Ill have to try that
2016-10-21 14:51:15	mc888	right now Im trying to avoid rewriting midi tracks
2016-10-21 14:51:24	rgareus	check  http://manual.ardour.org/images/left_right_eq.png   again.
2016-10-21 14:51:37	rgareus	that's also a stereo in, stereo out.    but only 1 instance

2016-10-21 14:52:58	mc888	ok yeah, I got the patching but didnt notice theres no unused instancestheres
2016-10-21 14:53:41	mc888	so just clean those up and instance 1 will see meters
2016-10-21 14:53:48	mc888	got it, thank you
2016-10-21 14:53:57	rgareus	mc888: you're welcome
2016-10-21 14:54:12	rgareus	removing unused instances also reducing DSP load a bit.
2016-10-21 14:54:48	mc888	i would expect so, but if theyre bypassed...
2016-10-21 14:55:05	rgareus	ardour does not care
2016-10-21 14:55:17	mc888	aaah so
2016-10-21 14:56:12	rgareus	mc888: In case plugin instances are replicated, I don't see a good way for GUIs.   replicating the GUI  as well would probably be more confusing. 
2016-10-21 14:57:40	mc888	I dont know, if its replicated to instance 1 it should just show up
2016-10-21 14:58:19	rgareus	ardour also runs "bypassed" plugns BTW. you can unbypass them at any time.   and in case of reverbs  just not running them may eat or replay the reverb tail.
2016-10-21 14:59:11	mc888	ok yeah so latency is always synched up
2016-10-21 14:59:11		[14:59]
2016-10-21 14:59:47	rgareus	latency is a different story.. there's a dedicated delayline.
2016-10-21 15:01:24	rgareus	mc888: if you have recent x42-eq  in Ardour5  the "bypass" button actually controlls the EQ's  "enable"
2016-10-21 15:01:28	mc888	is that a new thing - the latency adjustment in the channel properties? or did I just miss that before
2016-10-21 15:01:29	rgareus	so you can click-free bypas
2016-10-21 15:01:30	rgareus	s
2016-10-21 15:01:51	mc888	yes, very nicely integrated
2016-10-21 15:02:25	rgareus	mc888: it's always been there. just hidden in generic GUIs  and  Menu > Window > Tracks/Busses
2016-10-21 15:02:30	mc888	Im diggin some of the inline displays too, like phase correlation and midi monitor
2016-10-21 15:02:48	mc888	found a bug in the a-team high/low pass tho
2016-10-21 15:03:33	rgareus	mc888: what bug?
2016-10-21 15:03:36	mc888	the frequency parameters need to be multiplied
2016-10-21 15:03:51	mc888	open the plugin analysis and look at the corner freq

2016-10-21 15:08:17	rgareus	if you lower resonance to 0.1 or thereabouts a factor of 10 sounds about right
2016-10-21 15:08:24	mc888	I was trying for highpass at zero res
2016-10-21 15:09:05	mc888	I wanted to see if it had feedback - like yours doesnt
2016-10-21 15:09:23	rgareus	the "default" is 1/sqrt(2)~ 0.707  (half an octave) 
2016-10-21 15:09:52	rgareus	which has no gain
2016-10-21 15:10:27	mc888	no gain meaning no added resonance?
2016-10-21 15:10:31	rgareus	yep
2016-10-21 15:10:36	rgareus	it only falls off
2016-10-21 15:10:40	mc888	right, thats why I did it
2016-10-21 15:10:48	rgareus	and in case of 12dB/Octave  the specified freq is at -3dB
2016-10-21 15:11:14	mc888	Im on a kick removing as much resonant eq from a mix as possible
2016-10-21 15:11:19	rgareus	mc888: shift+click on the resonance and it resets to that value: default is no resonance
2016-10-21 15:12:06	mc888	.70 is none but sounds different than 0
2016-10-21 15:12:12	mc888	?
2016-10-21 15:13:00	rgareus	the curve and phase response is different
2016-10-21 15:14:51	rgareus	we should have labeled it "Bandwidth"
2016-10-21 15:14:51		[15:14]
2016-10-21 15:15:01	rgareus	same thing really in case of a EQ
2016-10-21 15:15:50	mc888	like on a bell
2016-10-21 15:21:00		[15:15]

2016-10-21 15:29:35	nstewart_	rgareus: -  has running lua scripts in their own thread been mapped out for the future? Are there peculiarities that affect different script types (editor command vs dsp, etc..)
2016-10-21 15:31:26	rgareus	nstewart_: it's in the design already.   DSP and session-scripts run in realtime-context.   all other scripts in the GUI thread
2016-10-21 15:31:44	rgareus	there is always only one UI thread.
2016-10-21 15:33:38	rgareus	nstewart_: there are currently no plans to allow a [GUI] script to start another script interpreter in the background.
2016-10-21 15:34:39	rgareus	inter-thread communication is hard.   I guess someday we'll have to bite that bullet (it's also needed for control surfaces)

2016-10-22 08:29:51	OvenWerks	Joeboy: I have been able to control Ardour from some of the free android OSC applets out there. I have not gotten any feedback working outside of open-stage-control. The feedback part does work... it is a matter of figuring out the android end.
2016-10-22 08:29:51		[08:29]
2016-10-22 08:32:14	OvenWerks	Joeboy: in order to use these, it is best to use the OSC GUI (not documented yet) set to manual and set all of your setting there before trying to connect with the android.

2016-10-22 08:44:36	MaurizioB	Joeboy: sorry, no source, if you really want I can send it to you, but with the current situation with OSC I don't see the point; I'm going to begin some work on a "Ardour 5 compliant" version in about a month
2016-10-22 08:47:31	OvenWerks	Joeboy: yuck, just tried out QuickOSC - no editing I can see, andOSC - x/y control only, AndrOSC - faders work, buttons I can't set, MyOSC - can't edit net port.
2016-10-22 08:48:48	OvenWerks	Joeboy: it would be possible to get AndrOSC to work using only faders... touch the top of the fader to turn a button on the bottom for off...

2016-10-22 09:55:04	las	OvenWerks, i tend to favor the idea of sharing the "message dispatch" code with OSC rather than actually wiring liblo to an sctp socket, but who knows ...
2016-10-22 09:55:06	OvenWerks	las: I am sure it would. Shouls that replace OSC or add to it
2016-10-22 09:55:36	las	OvenWerks, the idea would be that we have an existing callback that is invoked when OSC has a message for us; webrtc can do more or less the same thing
2016-10-22 09:55:55	tom-	nice midi flow logic is far more important
2016-10-22 09:55:56	las	OvenWerks, google's examples of this are really small and easy (a bit ugly too)
2016-10-22 09:55:57	OvenWerks	las: so both in one

2016-10-22 09:57:46	las	OvenWerks, that's it: that much code sends a message between the two
2016-10-22 09:58:08	las	OvenWerks, obviously, in the real case, one side would be JS in a browser
2016-10-22 10:00:14	OvenWerks	las: and also there needs to be a page that displays the widgets in the first place.
2016-10-22 10:00:42	OvenWerks	las: but the ardour end could be quite simple yes.
2016-10-22 10:00:45	las	OvenWerks, sure, but that's a whole different set of issues
2016-10-22 10:01:03	las	OvenWerks, my role in this is just to make webrtc possible as a transport for OSC messages (duplex)
2016-10-22 10:01:59	OvenWerks	las: then some one could make a "modern" looking webpage to connect to....
2016-10-22 10:02:54	las	OvenWerks, or whatever ... :)
2016-10-22 10:05:30	tom-	just showing webrtc from/to the same api as osc is using won't make the api any better

2016-10-22 10:12:53	tom-	OvenWerks: lua is not the reason for this per se
2016-10-22 10:13:13	tom-	OvenWerks: but now that the scripting is done with lua, it's lua
2016-10-22 10:13:49	tom-	it's the right spot to attach these kinds of interaction with ardour imo
2016-10-22 10:15:15	tom-	i'm sure there are already more lua scripts and plugins around than there were ardour-osc-taylored programs ever
2016-10-22 10:15:55	rghvdberg	still have much much problems with midi
2016-10-22 10:16:33	rghvdberg	but I'm working with flaky win32/wine synth so I'm not complaining / reporting atm
2016-10-22 10:17:10	rghvdberg	dunno if ardour or synth is the culprit.
2016-10-22 10:17:42	rghvdberg	I did notice Ardour not sending midi notes when entering the 2nd loop when in loop mode.
2016-10-22 10:17:50	rghvdberg	I put a-midimonitor on it
2016-10-22 10:18:11	tom-	that was working at some point
2016-10-22 10:18:15	rghvdberg	no hanging notes though, so that's better
2016-10-22 10:18:36	rghvdberg	also , compiled 5.4 from git .. so ..
2016-10-22 10:18:38	rghvdberg	mm
2016-10-22 10:18:55	tom-	the problem starts when using busses which is the only reasonable way for some workflows
2016-10-22 10:18:58	rghvdberg	I have a crazy use cage :-)
2016-10-22 10:19:09	rghvdberg	case
2016-10-22 10:19:37	rghvdberg	midi bus, or audio bus ?
2016-10-22 10:20:02	tom-	a midi bus, to hold a synth, receiving input from other tracks
2016-10-22 10:20:14	tom-	it's missing stuff on roll stop iirc
2016-10-22 10:20:14	rghvdberg	I use 3 or 4 tracks with the same midi notes but different synth patches
2016-10-22 10:20:32	rghvdberg	usually I use the 'share playlist' stuff
2016-10-22 10:20:47	rghvdberg	then i route those to a bus for further processing
2016-10-22 10:21:05	rghvdberg	the track that doesn't play notes is a single midi track (with synth)
2016-10-22 10:21:31	rghvdberg	audio from that track goes in the drumbus with the other drum sounds of course

2016-10-22 10:23:00	rghvdberg	not a big problem when exporting, in the end it's all good
2016-10-22 10:23:31	tom-	audio is said to be sample accurate, but midi seems just not doable

2016-10-22 10:27:51	las	rghvdberg, there is a commit that is believed to be "solid" for MIDI, but unfortunately corresponds to neither 5.3 nor 5.4
2016-10-22 10:27:55	tom-	if note on beat 1 doesn't play, that's a problem not bitching

2016-10-22 10:54:07	tom-	rgareus: for a given region that's trimmed, it would be sometimes very useful to untrim it "make full original length" with a simple action
2016-10-22 10:54:30	tom-	rgareus: i wondered if that's easy for a script (i.e. do for selected regions)
2016-10-22 10:54:55	tom-	rgareus: or if that should be a core method that's then easily bound to a shortcut
2016-10-22 10:55:37	rgareus	tom-: I thought that's already possible
2016-10-22 10:55:51	rghvdberg	oh .. forgot to ask : is it possible to scroll through a project with clicking and draging ? Thought about this while using gimp : middle mouse button - drag
2016-10-22 10:56:22	rgareus	tom-: http://manual.ardour.org/lua-scripting/class_reference/#ARDOUR:Region   has set_length()

2016-10-22 10:57:12	rgareus	tom-: and you can  cast it    to_readable()   readable_length() to get the full length
2016-10-22 10:57:37	rgareus	tom-: and subtract the start offset..
2016-10-22 10:58:24	tom-	rgareus: im just booting ardour to see if i missed it
2016-10-22 10:58:31	tom-	rgareus: sounds good that lua can do it
2016-10-22 10:59:48	rgareus	the goal is that you can do everything in lua that the ardour GUI can do. and we're more than halfway there.
2016-10-22 11:00:27	tom-	rgareus: there is "move to origianl position"
2016-10-22 11:00:52	tom-	rgareus: there could be "extend to original length" as core function
2016-10-22 11:00:57	rgareus	no
2016-10-22 11:01:02	rgareus	there's no API for that
2016-10-22 11:01:16	tom-	?
2016-10-22 11:01:28	tom-	in the gui, there is "move to original position" for a selection region
2016-10-22 11:01:51	tom-	rgareus: the same, for length
2016-10-22 11:01:53	rgareus	I bet move_to_natural_position() is not doing what you think it does :)
2016-10-22 11:02:11	tom-	it does, it puts it where it was recorded
2016-10-22 11:02:34	rgareus	tom-: an essential part of API design is  DRY (do not repeat yourself)
2016-10-22 11:02:43	tom-	now if it was trimmed. i would move to original position, extend to original length and have the original situatio
2016-10-22 11:02:46	tom-	n
2016-10-22 11:02:55	rgareus	there are only a handful of exceptions "convenience function"

2016-10-22 11:06:23	avlinux	Hi, can the 'a-Fluid Synth' plugin be forklifted into a Mixbus bundle and work? In theory?
2016-10-22 11:06:27	tom-	rgareus: can you do it easily? i'd spend a couple of beers for that
2016-10-22 11:06:45	tom-	for such a script. extend region (and optionally place start at playhead)
2016-10-22 11:07:09	rghvdberg	las: any other combination would work, middle mouse button was just an example.
2016-10-22 11:07:15	tom-	"tom's region extend that shold be a core method presented as a script" :)
2016-10-22 11:08:11	tom-	it would accompany loop recordings where you have a dozen of chunks but want just one long chunk (after loop recording)
2016-10-22 11:08:30	rghvdberg	example: searching for something in the project, look down at the overview pane .. clicking .. draging .. aaaaand I'm lost ..

2016-10-23 23:57:23	IOhannes	rgareus: the OP posted some more information, basically stating that the problem seems to be related to upgrading.
2016-10-23 23:57:58	IOhannes	ah i think it is as follows: the color-themes are in 'ardour-common', but when upgrading the binary from 4 to 5, the ardour-common package might stay at 4.
2016-10-23 23:58:13	IOhannes	so we need some versioned depends.
2016-10-23 23:58:15	IOhannes	thanks :-)
2016-10-23 23:59:23	IOhannes	rgareus: however, shouldn't ardour *not* segfault when it cannot find theme-files?
2016-10-24 00:04:14	rgareus	IOhannes: it's gtkmm that segfaults
2016-10-24 00:05:01	rgareus	IOhannes: i've seen some similar issues.  those color-definitions define placeholders for clearlooks.
2016-10-24 00:05:01		[00:05]
2016-10-24 00:07:33	rgareus	I don't think we can compile-in defaults for those in the binary itself.
2016-10-24 00:07:49	IOhannes	+1
2016-10-24 00:08:18	IOhannes	also, this wouldn't necessarily fix the underlying problem (missing theme files resulting in a segfault)

2016-10-24 00:09:59	IOhannes	afaict, ardour detects that the "@bases" is invalid (at least, the error-message has an "ardour:" prefix).
2016-10-24 00:10:11	rgareus	IOhannes: that's gtkmm's doing.

2016-10-24 00:10:38	IOhannes	would *you* mind reporting a bug with gtkmm?
2016-10-24 00:10:42	IOhannes	i just know too little
2016-10-24 00:10:48	IOhannes	ok, ttl
2016-10-24 00:11:04	rgareus	IOhannes: it's a known issue in gtkmm2 
2016-10-24 00:11:15	rgareus	and a won't fix. they're moving to gtk4 these days.
2016-10-24 00:11:16	IOhannes	even better.
2016-10-24 00:11:22	IOhannes	oops
2016-10-24 00:11:42	IOhannes	well, i can kinda fix the problem on the debian side for now

2016-10-24 09:33:22	zequence	A custom alsa config does not work well, but alsa_in and alsa_out works ok, from very initial tests.
2016-10-24 09:33:50	zequence	I'm moving away from using the Focusrite as the sound device, and only using it as a pre-amp.
2016-10-24 09:34:23	zequence	It works with ALSA these days, but not well (the focusrite)
2016-10-24 09:34:52	shalokshalom	tnaugle: ah, ok

2016-10-24 09:35:31	zequence	Even though I'm syncing the cards with spdif, jack has a lot of xruns from running the two cards as one.
2016-10-24 09:35:33	shalokshalom	where is the difference to a soundcard?
2016-10-24 09:36:00	zequence	shalokshalom: I do a lot of audio recording, so, no. I mean A/D.
2016-10-24 09:36:13	shalokshalom	ah, ok

2016-10-24 09:36:57	zequence	The difference in soundcards is at many levels. Both in hardware and software. 
2016-10-24 09:37:15	zequence	But, again, the best way to know which works best is to try it out.
2016-10-24 09:37:23	zequence	The only way to know

2016-10-24 11:29:02	MaurizioB	you really have to focus on production, not on "translating" what you want to do; an app should make your work simpler, not more complex

2016-10-24 11:53:41	rghvdberg	Kick Bus latency .. right there
2016-10-24 11:53:44	rghvdberg	I can touch it

2016-10-24 11:54:22	rghvdberg	THANK YOU MAURIZIOB ;-)
2016-10-24 11:54:41	rghvdberg	so .. how to fix ? 
2016-10-24 11:54:46	MaurizioB	rghvdberg: don't thank me, I'm just a humble user :)
2016-10-24 11:54:48	rgareus	rghvdberg: some day in the glorious future it'll work for busses, too.   also if ther's a single track feeding the bus, it may me pushed up
2016-10-24 11:55:22	rghvdberg	what if I delay all tracks that are not in the bus
2016-10-24 11:55:35	rghvdberg	there's buses everywhere

2016-10-24 11:56:25	rgareus	rghvdberg: are you working around an issue with latent FX (on the bus)  or is the audio in the editor already not aligned?

2016-10-24 11:56:41	rghvdberg	just midi

2016-10-24 12:00:17	rgareus	"No Delayline"  is a simple audio delay (after synth)  and there's also a MIDI-delay (but that's in bpm)

2016-10-24 12:01:07	rgareus	No Delay can work inverse (on a track)  only report latency...  then again  I'm not sure if ardour actually compensates for latency on MIDI tracks.

2016-10-24 12:12:50	rgareus	rghvdberg: right click on the master meter and change it to K12  for EDM

2016-10-24 12:15:05	rghvdberg	+10 !!
2016-10-24 12:15:26	rgareus	with K-12  that's fine.  in that case +12  would be clipping
2016-10-24 12:15:39	rgareus	with K-20  that's fine.  +20  would be digital clipping
2016-10-24 12:16:02	rghvdberg	well +6 db on the limiter was maybe a bit to much
2016-10-24 12:16:23	rghvdberg	but wait. doesn't a limiter limit the output to 0 db ?
2016-10-24 12:16:40	rghvdberg	I really need to read some books ...
2016-10-24 12:16:45	rgareus	the difference between  RMS (the k-meter bar)  and the digital peak (the stip on top)  is called "crest factor"  and a good indication for dynamic-range.
2016-10-24 12:17:21	rghvdberg	EDM = no dynamics ;-)
2016-10-24 12:17:27	rgareus	K-20 is designed for good handmade music.   20dB  of dynamic range, provides good kicks and snare onsets
2016-10-24 12:17:38	rgareus	right 
2016-10-24 12:17:42	rghvdberg	that's no music .. it just boom boom boom

2016-10-24 12:54:29	Stuzz	Also, I could choose a patch with my controller for each track I had a-fluid synth on.  This worked, but as far as I can tell, didn't actually go anywhere.  So when I restarted Ardour, all was back to patch 00

2016-10-24 22:59:39	rgareus	[22:27:25] weird [22:27:25]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	rgareus	[22:27:44] braxtons12: you need to re-start ardour to re-layout. [22:27:44]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	rgareus	[22:28:27] braxtons12: can you make a screenshot? [22:28:27]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	braxtons12	[22:29:34] rgareus: yes, one moment [22:29:34]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	rgareus	[22:32:30] here it fits nicely on 1920x1080 with lots of space: http://robin.linuxaudio.org/tmp/ardour1920.png [22:32:30]

2016-10-24 22:59:39	rgareus	[22:33:26] yep [22:33:26]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	MaurizioB	[22:33:38] :) [22:33:38]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	rgareus	[22:34:08] and screen which you don't see :) [22:34:08]

2016-10-24 22:59:39	rgareus	[22:36:11] braxtons12: can you detach the "preferences"  and try to reduce height of the window after that? [22:36:11]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	rgareus	[22:37:04] braxtons12: did you try to manually reduce height of the window? [22:37:04]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	braxtons12	[22:38:09] rgareus: detaching preferences works, and yes i did, that doesn't work because it locks to a minimum vertical size > 1080px [22:38:09]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	rgareus	[22:39:32] I don't see how that could be. there's nothing in the Editor nor mixer window that'd impose that size constraint [22:39:32]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	rgareus	[22:40:41] braxtons12: quit ardour;    mv ~/.config/ardour5/instant.xml /tmp;      create a new session [22:40:41]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	braxtons12	[22:41:04] I know its strange. detaching preferences did allow the window to behave normally though. [22:41:04]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	rgareus	[22:41:04] maybe it's ardour trying to restore its previous window size + position  (instant.xml)   that screws things up [22:41:04]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	rgareus	[22:41:34] K, some preference pane imposes a minium size. [22:41:34]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	braxtons12	[22:43:28] moving the instant.xml didn't change anything [22:43:28]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	braxtons12	[22:44:49] also, when preferences is detached, the preferences window itself is also resizable like normal. so attached, the window is locked to a min vertical size > 1080px, but detached both windows are resizable [22:44:49]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	Stuzz	[22:52:52] Anyone in the know see my messages about a-fluid synth ~12 hours ago?  Basically, how are you supposed to choose a patch? [22:52:52]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	rgareus	[22:54:07] Stuzz: on a midi region. right click > MIDI > insert patch change [22:54:07]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	rgareus	[22:54:17] then play through it [22:54:17]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	Stuzz	[22:54:29] Also, I could choose a patch with my controller for each track I had a-fluid synth on.  This worked, but as far as I can tell, didn't actually go anywhere.  So when I restarted Ardour, all was back to patch 00 [22:54:29]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	Stuzz	[22:54:44] rgareus: OK.  That's what I did [22:54:44]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	rgareus	[22:55:27] Stuzz: that's currently how it is.  a-fluidsynth is currently not unlike a hardware synth.  it forgets its settings on power-cycle. [22:55:27]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	rgareus	[22:56:17] if you need to get work done *now*, I suppose some other synth might be more appropriate [22:56:17]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	Stuzz	[22:56:41] rgareus: OK, no problem then.  I hadn't used it before so I didn't really know what to expect [22:56:41]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	Stuzz	[22:56:42] No, I was just playin' around [22:56:42]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	Stuzz	[22:57:46] I'm new to this MIDI controller business too.  Is a patch change something that can be sent to Ardour, or it right-click etc the option? [22:57:46]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	Stuzz	[22:57:56] or is* [22:57:56]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	las	[23:03:26] Stuzz, right click on a MIDI track to add a patch change to Ardour's track; if Ardour receives a patch change it will do nothing itself - that is up to a plugin [23:03:26]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	rgareus	[23:04:31] it's a normal midi message -- ardour will also record it [23:04:31]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	braxtons12	[23:06:29] rgareus: sorry, had to take a call, did i miss anything about that window issue? [23:06:29]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	Stuzz	[23:08:55] Record it.. yeah, thought so [23:08:55]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	nstewart_	[23:10:13] looking at the qm transcription plugin... I'm surprised they didn't decide to write their own c compiler for it.  I will admit - I have turned a screw on a lathe for the heck of it, instead of grabbing one out of a box. But... it was purely an indulgence in OCD. [23:10:13]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	nstewart_	[23:11:45] or rather just for the heck of it.  [23:11:45]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	nstewart_	[23:12:13] OCD would imply I expected my screw to be better than one I could buy. [23:12:13]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	IvanDSM	[03:18:36] Hey everyone, I've got a quick question: I have a track that has tempo errors. I was wondering: Can I make a ramped tempo curve for that track and have Ardour shift it to a constant BPM with the stretch function? [03:18:36]
2016-10-24 22:59:39	nick_m	[03:25:34] IvanDSM, i'm not syre what you mean by tempo errors.. [03:25:34]

2016-10-24 23:19:16	rgareus	[22:27:25] weird [22:27:25]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	rgareus	[22:27:44] braxtons12: you need to re-start ardour to re-layout. [22:27:44]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	rgareus	[22:28:27] braxtons12: can you make a screenshot? [22:28:27]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	braxtons12	[22:29:34] rgareus: yes, one moment [22:29:34]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	rgareus	[22:32:30] here it fits nicely on 1920x1080 with lots of space: http://robin.linuxaudio.org/tmp/ardour1920.png [22:32:30]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	MaurizioB	[22:33:22] rgareus: is that irssi? [22:33:22]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	rgareus	[22:33:26] yep [22:33:26]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	MaurizioB	[22:33:38] :) [22:33:38]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	rgareus	[22:34:08] and screen which you don't see :) [22:34:08]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	MaurizioB	[22:34:21] rgareus: I figured that ;) [22:34:21]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	braxtons12	[22:34:30] i did a few showing different scaling factors, first is one tick < default, second is 3, third is smallest possible [22:34:30]

2016-10-24 23:19:16	rgareus	[22:36:11] braxtons12: can you detach the "preferences"  and try to reduce height of the window after that? [22:36:11]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	rgareus	[22:37:04] braxtons12: did you try to manually reduce height of the window? [22:37:04]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	braxtons12	[22:38:09] rgareus: detaching preferences works, and yes i did, that doesn't work because it locks to a minimum vertical size > 1080px [22:38:09]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	rgareus	[22:39:32] I don't see how that could be. there's nothing in the Editor nor mixer window that'd impose that size constraint [22:39:32]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	rgareus	[22:40:41] braxtons12: quit ardour;    mv ~/.config/ardour5/instant.xml /tmp;      create a new session [22:40:41]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	braxtons12	[22:41:04] I know its strange. detaching preferences did allow the window to behave normally though. [22:41:04]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	rgareus	[22:41:04] maybe it's ardour trying to restore its previous window size + position  (instant.xml)   that screws things up [22:41:04]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	rgareus	[22:41:34] K, some preference pane imposes a minium size. [22:41:34]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	braxtons12	[22:43:28] moving the instant.xml didn't change anything [22:43:28]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	braxtons12	[22:44:49] also, when preferences is detached, the preferences window itself is also resizable like normal. so attached, the window is locked to a min vertical size > 1080px, but detached both windows are resizable [22:44:49]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	Stuzz	[22:52:52] Anyone in the know see my messages about a-fluid synth ~12 hours ago?  Basically, how are you supposed to choose a patch? [22:52:52]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	rgareus	[22:54:07] Stuzz: on a midi region. right click > MIDI > insert patch change [22:54:07]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	rgareus	[22:54:17] then play through it [22:54:17]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	Stuzz	[22:54:29] Also, I could choose a patch with my controller for each track I had a-fluid synth on.  This worked, but as far as I can tell, didn't actually go anywhere.  So when I restarted Ardour, all was back to patch 00 [22:54:29]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	Stuzz	[22:54:44] rgareus: OK.  That's what I did [22:54:44]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	rgareus	[22:55:27] Stuzz: that's currently how it is.  a-fluidsynth is currently not unlike a hardware synth.  it forgets its settings on power-cycle. [22:55:27]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	rgareus	[22:56:17] if you need to get work done *now*, I suppose some other synth might be more appropriate [22:56:17]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	Stuzz	[22:56:41] rgareus: OK, no problem then.  I hadn't used it before so I didn't really know what to expect [22:56:41]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	Stuzz	[22:56:42] No, I was just playin' around [22:56:42]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	Stuzz	[22:57:46] I'm new to this MIDI controller business too.  Is a patch change something that can be sent to Ardour, or it right-click etc the option? [22:57:46]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	Stuzz	[22:57:56] or is* [22:57:56]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	las	[23:03:26] Stuzz, right click on a MIDI track to add a patch change to Ardour's track; if Ardour receives a patch change it will do nothing itself - that is up to a plugin [23:03:26]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	rgareus	[23:04:31] it's a normal midi message -- ardour will also record it [23:04:31]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	braxtons12	[23:06:29] rgareus: sorry, had to take a call, did i miss anything about that window issue? [23:06:29]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	Stuzz	[23:08:55] Record it.. yeah, thought so [23:08:55]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	nstewart_	[23:10:13] looking at the qm transcription plugin... I'm surprised they didn't decide to write their own c compiler for it.  I will admit - I have turned a screw on a lathe for the heck of it, instead of grabbing one out of a box. But... it was purely an indulgence in OCD. [23:10:13]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	nstewart_	[23:11:45] or rather just for the heck of it.  [23:11:45]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	nstewart_	[23:12:13] OCD would imply I expected my screw to be better than one I could buy. [23:12:13]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	IvanDSM	[03:18:36] Hey everyone, I've got a quick question: I have a track that has tempo errors. I was wondering: Can I make a ramped tempo curve for that track and have Ardour shift it to a constant BPM with the stretch function? [03:18:36]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	nick_m	[03:25:34] IvanDSM, i'm not syre what you mean by tempo errors.. [03:25:34]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	nick_m	[03:27:17] IvanDSM, oh i think i know what you mean .. the performance  isn't linear?  [03:27:17]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	nick_m	[03:27:31] IvanDSM, no you can't do that yet. [03:27:31]
2016-10-24 23:19:16	nick_m	[03:30:30] IvanDSM, ..but you can use the ramps to track the tempo if you're that way inclined [03:30:30]

2016-10-25 02:10:20	the_CLA	I guess Ardour should have a function built in that warns the user about using certain sets of known-to-be-troublesome plugins. ;)

2016-10-25 02:14:24	christophski	I think the problem was actually to do with sidechain routing pin connections. Once I removed the sends from the Kick channel I could then add any plugins without Ardour crashing
2016-10-25 02:14:44	christophski	I could then re-add the sends 
2016-10-25 02:15:02	christophski	maybe that is Calf's fault, maybe it's ardour's, I don't know!

2016-10-25 02:17:29	the_CLA	Ok, I haven't used sidechains that extensively, so I don't know if there might be some corner cases that might cause trouble. But there are often crashes related to Calf plugins reported on this channel.
2016-10-25 02:23:00		[02:17]
2016-10-25 02:23:22	the_CLA	Personnaly I don't use Calf and don't even have it installed anymore because I think the quality is quite low. The ones that I found to be interesting had really bad DSP, causing crackles, behaving very strangely or where broken (by design) in other ways. :(

2016-10-25 07:45:07	OvenWerks	rgareus: ^^^^ does this work?

2016-10-25 07:46:47	OvenWerks	gcrk: that may be a bug in qjackctl. I think that line should not be translated

2016-10-25 07:47:39	rgareus	nstewart_: vamp-sdk and vamp-host-sdk is system wide (build stack),    qm-lib  is included with ardour, but you can   ./waf configure --use-external-libs (fedora does that) to use system-wide qm-lib.  plugins are included with ardour in libs/vamp-plugins/
2016-10-25 07:47:55	rgareus	gcrk, OvenWerks: sounds like a bug in qjackctl  with translations
2016-10-25 07:48:17	rgareus	"(default)" is special it means don't add sever-name
2016-10-25 07:48:19	OvenWerks	(or a bug in the packaging)
2016-10-25 07:48:35	rgareus	it does not  add  -n(default)
2016-10-25 07:48:40	OvenWerks	rgareus: ya what I thought
2016-10-25 07:49:42	OvenWerks	Thanks for the info
2016-10-25 07:50:48	rgareus	gcrk: which version of qjackctl is that?

2016-10-25 07:51:07	nstewart_	rgareus: sorry - this is a vamp /qm plugin mismatch. crashes in SV too

2016-10-25 07:53:27	gcrk	rgareus: i simply changed the string back to default, now it works

2016-10-25 07:55:45	the_CLA	Argh! That translation bug in qjackctl still exists? O.o
2016-10-25 07:56:12	the_CLA	I stumbled over this some years ago.
2016-10-25 07:56:25	gcrk	rgareus: i moved the config and everything is allright.

2016-10-25 07:56:49	gcrk	but: i use this config since some months or years so this problem could came up in a earlier version

2016-10-25 11:42:06	OvenWerks	[17:48:19] (or a bug in the packaging) [17:48:19]

2016-10-25 11:42:06	gcrk	[17:51:07] OvenWerks: 0.4.3 [17:51:07]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	nstewart_	[17:51:07] rgareus: sorry - this is a vamp /qm plugin mismatch. crashes in SV too [17:51:07]

2016-10-25 11:42:06	rgareus	[17:52:42] gcrk: you could try to  quit qjackctl    mv ~/.config/rncbc.org/QjackCtl.conf /tmp/ ;  re-start qjackctl and not touch the "advanced" settings [17:52:42]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	gcrk	[17:53:27] rgareus: i simply changed the string back to default, now it works [17:53:27]

2016-10-25 11:42:07	the_CLA	[17:56:12] I stumbled over this some years ago. [17:56:12]

2016-10-25 11:42:07	rgareus	[17:56:36] I've ping'ed Rui on #lad about it [17:56:36]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	gcrk	[17:56:49] but: i use this config since some months or years so this problem could came up in a earlier version [17:56:49]

2016-10-25 11:42:07	OvenWerks	[18:04:45] gcrk: good stuff [18:04:45]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	gcrk	[18:05:31] OvenWerks: i could say this about your mcpdisp [18:05:31]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	rgareus	[18:11:41] gcrk: I just checked with rncb (Rui, qjackctl's author) he said in 0.4.3  "(default") is not translated [18:11:41]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	rgareus	[18:11:56] gcrk: where did you get qjackctl from?  [18:11:56]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	gcrk	[18:12:20] rgareus: this time from arch repos, but the config is quite old [18:12:20]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	rgareus	[18:12:32] gcrk: indeed that makes sense, then [18:12:32]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	rgareus	[18:12:57] so you got  "(voreingestellt)"  from an older version  and the bug was meanwhile fixe.. [18:12:57]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	gcrk	[18:13:27] rgareus: i guess [18:13:27]
2016-10-25 11:42:07	gcrk	[18:13:44] rgareus: in fact i never thought about... [18:13:44]

2016-10-25 13:50:09	rgareus	and you probably recorded it in mono originally, right?
2016-10-25 13:50:24	vald	yes I added a port.  Also note that the "Bass" track is mono as well but has dual VU meters
2016-10-25 13:50:34	rgareus	the level meter (post == before panner)  only has a signal on the left channel
2016-10-25 13:50:39	--	Channel created on Sat, 25 Nov 2006 20:42:44
2016-10-25 13:50:52	vald	I did record mono.  I added that second "audio port" after doing some reading.  I can remove it.  But I have the same problem
2016-10-25 13:50:57	rgareus	the "Calf compressor" that you've added  is a stereo effect
2016-10-25 13:51:03	vald	yes
2016-10-25 13:51:17	rgareus	so the signal becomes stereo  on the Bass track

2016-10-25 13:52:42	Bitrunner	hmm looks like "realtime" export is ignored in 5.1 unter certain circumstances? 
2016-10-25 13:52:51	vald	is there a way to reset or default the audio routing grid?
2016-10-25 13:52:52	rgareus	vald: that way it'll stay mono (like your Acoustic track)
2016-10-25 13:53:02	rgareus	vald: as for the vocals..  
2016-10-25 13:53:21	rgareus	vald: probably the best is to remove that 2nd port that you've added again.

2016-10-25 13:54:03	vald	but I want to be able to pan tracks left and right and I don't seem to be able to do that
2016-10-25 13:54:21	vald	for some reason, the master buss is only taking audio from the left channel
2016-10-25 13:54:48	rgareus	vald: does it work for the "Acoustic"  track (which you've already panned right)?
2016-10-25 13:55:08	rgareus	aah wait.  on master.. you've added a   MONO  GVERB

2016-10-25 13:55:56	vald	thank you SO much
2016-10-25 13:55:59	rgareus	it's indicated by the  wiring  if you look top-right'ish in he screenshot
2016-10-25 13:56:19	vald	is there a stereo verb you would recommend for mastering?
2016-10-25 13:56:29	Bitrunner	zita is fine IMHO
2016-10-25 13:56:34	vald	I removed it
2016-10-25 13:56:36	rgareus	I would not put it on the master bus itself
2016-10-25 13:56:46	rgareus	I'd use a "reverb bus"
2016-10-25 13:56:52	Bitrunner	yep I would suggest that, too
2016-10-25 13:57:05	Bitrunner	and feeding that with post fader aux sends from channels or groups
2016-10-25 13:57:18	rgareus	vald: if you have recent ardour5.X  there's a stereo  a-reverb included with ardour which is not bad.
2016-10-25 13:57:19	vald	where are you from rgareus
2016-10-25 13:57:30	vald	I have 5.3
2016-10-25 13:57:42	rgareus	vald: Europe
2016-10-25 13:58:30	vald	I cannot thank you enough.  I am pleased with what we are recording.  Is there a place I might post for you people in the Ardour community to listen?
2016-10-25 13:58:50	Bitrunner	in general, it is always a good idea to use effect busses for effects which add something to the signal
2016-10-25 13:59:10	rgareus	Bitrunner: Region export, I think, is always freewheeling.
2016-10-25 13:59:16	Bitrunner	rgareus: ah ok. 
2016-10-25 13:59:19	vald	But for mastering, (at least in the old studio days) it was the last thing before tape
2016-10-25 13:59:49	rgareus	vald: there was a soundcloud group... until soundcloud disabled groups a couple of weeks ago
2016-10-25 13:59:53	Bitrunner	even in the old studio days many people wanted different reverb levels on different tracks
2016-10-25 14:00:13	rgareus	vald: some users post in  https://community.ardour.org/forum/9
2016-10-25 14:00:20	vald	Yes and I use them there as well, but a very light final verb is sometimes used for overall smoothing
2016-10-25 14:01:39	 *	rgareus 's personal general-purpose reverb is zita-rev1
2016-10-25 14:02:11	Bitrunner	yep, zita is very fine once you found out good parameter values ;)
2016-10-25 14:02:33	rgareus	the defaults are good for 99% in my case on a reverb bus
2016-10-25 14:03:42	Bitrunner	the defaults are reasonable,yep. Sometimes I prefer longer times and a little more damping 
2016-10-25 14:04:23	rgareus	Bitrunner: indeed.
2016-10-25 14:05:20	Bitrunner	but zita has a very broad "good sounding" range. Many plate reverbs are much more "beasty" tending to metallic sounds
2016-10-25 14:05:20		[14:05]
2016-10-25 14:06:08	Bitrunner	of course, if you have a good impulse answer, some convolver plugin will give good results, too. But that will neet much more effort for the result. 
2016-10-25 14:07:51	Bitrunner	finally, I was much more comfortable using zita. Not-so-much-worse results in much less time.

2016-10-25 14:24:23	Stuzz	Most people who listen to music aren't musicians
2016-10-25 14:24:41	Stuzz	Probably better to get feedback from them
2016-10-25 14:24:45	vald	thats not true!
2016-10-25 14:24:56	vald	I am a big music fan and a musician
2016-10-25 14:25:40	vald	http://www.northstarhost.com/ardour.  There is a track called Silhouette.  I just mixed (thanks to your help)
2016-10-25 14:25:42	Stuzz	What's not true?
2016-10-25 14:26:24	Stuzz	I'd listen... but can't right now :(
2016-10-25 14:26:42	vald	Stuzz, I misread your statement.  I suppose "most" music lovers probably aren't musicians.  I am more interested in musicians feedback.
2016-10-25 14:26:54	Stuzz	Sure :)
2016-10-25 14:27:01	 *	rgareus listens
2016-10-25 14:27:21	rgareus	starts out as a well mixed rock/pop song. nice
2016-10-25 14:27:45	vald	I do all guitars, etc.  the vocalist "Britt" did the drums
2016-10-25 14:27:53	Stuzz	"Probably better" I meant non-musicians outnumber musicians, so they'd make up a larger portion of your audience
2016-10-25 14:27:57	rgareus	female drummer?
2016-10-25 14:28:26	vald	Everything is Ardour/Linux except the drums which were exported from Logic and imported as a .wav file
2016-10-25 14:28:28	Stuzz	Either way, both camps can give feedback
2016-10-25 14:28:43	rgareus	it's a bit "bassey" on the monitors here.  I suspect on laptop speakers it'd be fine.
2016-10-25 14:29:08	vald	I have small studio monitors, but it sounds ok in my car though I haven't heard this mix there yet
2016-10-25 14:29:13	rgareus	but well balanced overall.  the vocals are in front and don't compete with guitars..
2016-10-25 14:29:47	vald	good to hear.  do you like her voice?
2016-10-25 14:29:54	rgareus	yeah.
2016-10-25 14:30:06	rgareus	what I don't like is the snare drum..
2016-10-25 14:30:12	vald	we are doing an album and performing live.
2016-10-25 14:30:15	rgareus	it could use a bit more punch.
2016-10-25 14:30:29	vald	I HATE the logic drums, but its what I have for now
2016-10-25 14:30:49	vald	I don't know how to use Hydrogen well enough to use it
2016-10-25 14:30:49	Stuzz	I was 'bout to ask.  how were the drums did?
2016-10-25 14:30:56	vald	Logic
2016-10-25 14:31:07	Stuzz	So, programmed?
2016-10-25 14:31:12	vald	yes
2016-10-25 14:31:36	vald	there is a drum builder in logic that does a pretty good job
2016-10-25 14:31:42	Stuzz	aha
2016-10-25 14:31:47	NoteOn	hi
2016-10-25 14:32:07	Stuzz	rgareus would be referring to the sound of the snare, not the programming of it
2016-10-25 14:32:13	vald	ok
2016-10-25 14:32:19	Stuzz	Doesn't matter where the programming comes from
2016-10-25 14:32:39	rgareus	vald: the whole thing could be a bit brighter.   guitar solo + overheads.  but its fine overall.
2016-10-25 14:32:51	rgareus	Stuzz: both really.
2016-10-25 14:33:04	vald	yes, with Hyrdrogen you can output the drums in individual tracks so you can process and eq each piece alone.  with Logic its a stereo file all mixed
2016-10-25 14:33:35	NoteOn	What loginc means?
2016-10-25 14:33:40	Stuzz	rgareus: You don't like the programming of the snare drum?
2016-10-25 14:33:50	Stuzz	Logic is a DAW
2016-10-25 14:34:01	vald	overall, the double bass, some of the cymbals.
2016-10-25 14:34:04	rgareus	Stuzz: it's the same sound always.
2016-10-25 14:34:09	NoteOn	u use non linux? or is there logic in linux?
2016-10-25 14:34:27	vald	Logic is apple
2016-10-25 14:34:33	Stuzz	rgareus: Oh..  so velocity 'n all that
2016-10-25 14:34:49	NoteOn	ah ic, so you use logic /mac to make drums.
2016-10-25 14:34:51	 *	Stuzz bookmarks for later listening
2016-10-25 14:34:59	rgareus	Stuzz: e.g. around 1:27  that tripple hit.. all the same.
2016-10-25 14:35:07	vald	if I could process each piece alone, it would be better

2016-10-25 14:35:45	rgareus	drumgizmo  would be a bit "smarter" choosing samples  to avoid the maschine-gun effect

2016-10-25 14:36:26	vald	yes

2016-10-25 14:36:42	rgareus	but nothing beats a real snare and HH.  the rest (toms, overheads, kick..) can be sequenced/programmed.
2016-10-25 14:37:02	vald	I am putting up another track if you like.  Its called Midnight Train.  Different feel.  But I am thrilled to be finally producing music in Linux

2016-10-25 14:38:45	vald	No, the only electronic instrument is drums.  Everything else is guitar, bass etc.  I play them
2016-10-25 14:39:04	NoteOn	anyway, I did lots of mid based before... with all in sound module.
2016-10-25 14:39:12	rgareus	Stuzz: heh. you won this round.
2016-10-25 14:39:36	vald	NoteOn, I love midi...
2016-10-25 14:39:39	Stuzz	rgareus: Just by a whisker :)
2016-10-25 14:39:41	NoteOn	and now many ppl uses loop, today's pc power and daw does more I can do

2016-10-25 14:40:03	NoteOn	but seems me, if its very good loop, it needs time shift. each part.
2016-10-25 14:40:32	NoteOn	so best way is each sound, and like midi, each track needs timnig shft most case before.
2016-10-25 14:40:52	NoteOn	cause each sound has own point, ie. low soound is more after point,
2016-10-25 14:40:55	vald	Thank you all for your help.  I am going home now.  Good chatting and I will return.

2016-10-25 14:41:08	rgareus	Stuzz: then again, it may also be played on a MIDI drum-kit  with some  regions looped/replicated

2016-10-25 14:41:22	tom-	NoteOn: like low notes come "later"
2016-10-25 14:41:26	NoteOn	why loop its good listen is they do well in inside ie. hh fast, BD before etc.
2016-10-25 14:41:27	rgareus	vald: where are you based, these days?
2016-10-25 14:41:57	NoteOn	but if diffrent soungs to same loop, ajust temp to fit. then it chagnes,
2016-10-25 14:42:08	NoteOn	we can't edit inside of loop sound 
2016-10-25 14:42:28	NoteOn	loop means drum loop 120T etc that I mean
2016-10-25 14:43:07	NoteOn	so Im not sure arodor can do easy, but if we can do, like midi each track as BD SD HH Cymb..
2016-10-25 14:43:36	NoteOn	wile playback, track parameter -1 -2 +-0 +1 to ajust.. 
2016-10-25 14:43:38	Stuzz	rgareus: I would go all Ardour if I could replace the piano keys with drum names, and have an quicker way to adjust velocities.  Don't suppose there's any work on that front?
2016-10-25 14:43:50	NoteOn	midi is easy, but wave is .. heavy
2016-10-25 14:44:03	NoteOn	that I feel for drum sound.
2016-10-25 14:44:07	Stuzz	Ideally I'd just play my MIDI kit too, but at the moment I can program better than I can play :)
2016-10-25 14:44:17	rgareus	Stuzz: isn't that already possible using  the midnam selectors in the track-header?
2016-10-25 14:44:26	NoteOn	todays, most case, point is late, 
2016-10-25 14:45:10	NoteOn	that makes looks machin-nable? even using good sound and loop.
2016-10-25 14:45:34	tom-	heh
2016-10-25 14:46:36	rgareus	Stuzz: like http://robin.linuxaudio.org/tmp/midnam_drum.png  ?
2016-10-25 14:47:02	Stuzz	rgareus: Well, that just changes the tool-tip when you hover over a MIDI note (I think?).  I mean, replacing the graphic of the piano keys with words
2016-10-25 14:47:44	Stuzz	Or, perhaps that's just fine.  I haven't actually used a midnam file yet
2016-10-25 14:47:57	rgareus	in ^^ case it's just "General MIDI"  channel 10
2016-10-25 14:48:21	Stuzz	I'll have to give that a go
2016-10-25 14:48:38	rgareus	(defined  in ./patchfiles/MIDI.midnam )
2016-10-25 14:48:41	NoteOn	is there old cakewalk(win) like tool in linux?
2016-10-25 14:48:52	NoteOn	wait example,
2016-10-25 14:49:15	Stuzz	rgareus:  And velocities?  We can either use the scrollwheel, or double-click a note and change the velocity number at the moment?
2016-10-25 14:49:56	rgareus	Stuzz:  one "secret": when drawing notes using the "draw" tool   ardour uses the most recently selected channel in the "Chns"  playback selector
2016-10-25 14:50:14	rgareus	that's hard to discover and not really right..  but that's what it is currently

2016-10-25 14:51:44		[14:51]
2016-10-25 14:52:25	Stuzz	rgareus: yes yes, you can draw notes.  I'm not sure what your talking about with channels (we're on names/velocities at the moment)
2016-10-25 14:52:51	Stuzz	General MIDI, channel 10 gets the note names when you hover... I get that
2016-10-25 14:53:46	rgareus	Stuzz: I was musing on the workflow in general..   how it can be useful in its current state.
2016-10-25 14:53:47	Stuzz	NoteOn: What do you want from Sekaiju that you don't have?
2016-10-25 14:54:02	NoteOn	?
2016-10-25 14:54:22	NoteOn	it wine and midi mapper (poor midi routing etc) in llinux
2016-10-25 14:54:31	Stuzz	rgareus: OK.  So I'll try setting to channel 10 'n all that
2016-10-25 14:54:39	NoteOn	for operation that is light, so no problem with wine.
2016-10-25 14:55:08	NoteOn	and sekaixx is not powerfull as cakewalk(old version of sonar)
2016-10-25 14:55:30	NoteOn	well as its OSS, I need to make own .. ha ha

2016-10-25 15:13:09	Bitrunner	I tried using qsynth as a gui
2016-10-25 15:13:25	NoteOn	ok good test is #11 value 0  Note Value 127
2016-10-25 15:13:39	NoteOn	this makes volume 0 to max you can check
2016-10-25 15:13:56	Bitrunner	my problem is fluidSynth seems not to change volume of already playing notes on CC #11 (but it should IMHO)
2016-10-25 15:14:44	NoteOn	huum where you set flud?
2016-10-25 15:14:50	NoteOn	as plugin?
2016-10-25 15:15:00	Bitrunner	the events coming in are kind of "Note on" - "CC #11 64" - "CC #11 32" - "Note off" and so on

2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:11:02] so this kind, you can do note event but in event list its easy to check... [01:11:02]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	Bitrunner	[01:11:06] I got volume changes on new notes, but not in the presently playing one [01:11:06]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:11:36] and there are tool to put control change with mouse, but most case its many data.. so you need to thin process. [01:11:36]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	Bitrunner	[01:11:39] and I cannot change the behaviour of that controller since it is proprietary hardware [01:11:39]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	Bitrunner	[01:12:01] well, there are definitely cc #11 messages on the midi channel [01:12:01]

2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:15:55] now I can't check but I rememover full midi controlled midi data and play it with rose etc.. and  [01:15:55]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:16:35] sampler to set fluid (setup *.sf2) then it sounds full so fluid has that finction. [01:16:35]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:16:47] qsynth yes I use it [01:16:47]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:16:59] and jack patch to it. [01:16:59]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:17:28] ok so this kind check, like sekaijyu type is good. [01:17:28]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:18:05] cause we can play 1 event each by each... event list,  space bar to play 1 event -- next -- next etc. [01:18:05]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:19:07] ? above note on off is ??? [01:19:07]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:19:40] its organ tone? [01:19:40]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	Stuzz	[01:19:41] Bitrunner: Maybe try in jsampler/linuxsampler? [01:19:41]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	Bitrunner	[01:20:10] NoteOn: tried several gm sounds of the sound font. Normally, this is used with brass or woodwind or string sounds [01:20:10]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	Bitrunner	[01:20:34] NoteOn: does make less sense on organ and almost none on percussive instruments [01:20:34]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:20:42] Bitrunner: ic [01:20:42]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	Bitrunner	[01:21:31] but an oboist may in nature of course play a tone starting very silent and swellin up without interruption  [01:21:31]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	Bitrunner	[01:21:54] and of course, such things are used all the day in classic orchestras [01:21:54]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	Bitrunner	[01:22:12] (but they mostly don't use MIDI of course) [01:22:12]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:22:51] yes, I did midi control its complex so with external programming need  [01:22:51]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:23:12] and organ tone to make real acordin playing style.. like [01:23:12]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:23:51] thats midi control to make sound wave in midi. expression curve and timing each note.  [01:23:51]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	Bitrunner	[01:24:00] well, historic organs normally cannot change loudness of a single tone if they were built before around 1900 [01:24:00]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	Bitrunner	[01:25:10] they used registration for that. around 1900 the "Schwellwerk" was invented, then they theoretically could. But it's much less differential than violinists or woodwind players can do.  [01:25:10]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:25:32] I mean organ tone means no end part volume down sound. [01:25:32]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:25:45] = wave style is orgran like [01:25:45]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:26:34] anywya I try and find best way for me, now Im checking rich all in sound in module  [01:26:34]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:26:45] like old midi with GM GS like style.. [01:26:45]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:27:05] linux sampler can do maybe but can't find sound...  [01:27:05]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	Bitrunner	[01:29:07] fluidsynth soundfont is gm complete I think [01:29:07]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:31:04] ya [01:31:04]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:32:18] well, how is arodor new one vs before [01:32:18]
2016-10-25 15:33:48	NoteOn	[01:32:25] let me know > all [01:32:25]

2016-10-25 15:54:53	Stuzz	OH, ok
2016-10-25 15:55:50	Stuzz	I suppose it's this Fluid R3 GM one - https://musescore.org/en/handbook/soundfont#list
2016-10-25 15:56:09	Stuzz	Bitrunner: Maybe a different soundfont would respond to expression?
2016-10-25 15:56:10	Bitrunner	yep 
2016-10-25 15:56:18	Bitrunner	maybe, dunno
2016-10-25 15:56:23	Bitrunner	is there a free one?
2016-10-25 15:56:36	Stuzz	Err...  all the ones in that list
2016-10-25 15:56:51	Stuzz	I've been using GeneralUser most recently
2016-10-25 15:56:55	Bitrunner	ah ic
2016-10-25 15:57:44	Bitrunner	will have to try. But now it's time for Bed. 
2016-10-25 15:57:50	Stuzz	Seems a little strange to me that the control messages an SF2 would respond to would be controlled by the SF2
2016-10-25 15:57:58	Stuzz	But, I don't know how they work
2016-10-25 15:58:08	NoteOn	that url what I meant is  like Acoustic grand piano, release 2008-09-10 (132 MB uncompressed)
2016-10-25 15:58:08		[15:58]
2016-10-25 15:58:15	Bitrunner	maybe it is a simple routing or config problem
2016-10-25 15:58:27	Stuzz	I suppose it makes sense that a piano SF2 would respond the the modulation wheel or pitch bend etc
2016-10-25 15:58:37	Bitrunner	yep
2016-10-25 15:58:52	NoteOn	I like to set 1 patch to this kind big one. to make full rich one then all full midi control using vst effect plugin. my dream setup now..

2016-10-25 16:05:23	rgareus	the Salamander is quite good.   Still pianoteq (if you can afford it) goes a step further -- and hey, they have linux LV2s.
2016-10-25 16:05:44	rgareus	depends what you do.  if it's /just a piano in a rock song/   or a piano concerto.
2016-10-25 16:06:04	Stuzz	I got an Axiom 61 the other week and tried the Pianoteq demo.  It is very nice

2016-10-25 16:07:05	Stuzz	Still sounds good to me

2016-10-25 16:08:47	rgareus	yeah there are lots of piano samples which are more than good enough for a lot of things.  Piano, I have a hard time to hear the "real" one.
2016-10-25 16:09:37	rgareus	it needs a good pianist and piece to noice the diffeence.

2016-10-25 16:29:24	NoteOn	sorry I mean player uses looper that means realtime recording and loop. not pre recorded.

2016-10-25 17:57:02	Bitrunner	[01:57:44] will have to try. But now it's time for Bed.  [01:57:44]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Stuzz	[01:57:50] Seems a little strange to me that the control messages an SF2 would respond to would be controlled by the SF2 [01:57:50]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Stuzz	[01:57:58] But, I don't know how they work [01:57:58]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	NoteOn	[01:58:08] that url what I meant is  like Acoustic grand piano, release 2008-09-10 (132 MB uncompressed) [01:58:08]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Bitrunner	[01:58:15] maybe it is a simple routing or config problem [01:58:15]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Stuzz	[01:58:27] I suppose it makes sense that a piano SF2 would respond the the modulation wheel or pitch bend etc [01:58:27]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Bitrunner	[01:58:37] yep [01:58:37]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	NoteOn	[01:58:52] I like to set 1 patch to this kind big one. to make full rich one then all full midi control using vst effect plugin. my dream setup now.. [01:58:52]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Stuzz	[01:59:14] NoteOn: Have you used pianoteq? [01:59:14]

2016-10-25 17:57:02	NoteOn	[01:59:26] where URL? [01:59:26]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	NoteOn	[02:00:07] https://www.pianoteq.com/ [02:00:07]

2016-10-25 17:57:02	NoteOn	[02:00:09] this one? [02:00:09]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Stuzz	[02:00:42] Yes [02:00:42]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	rgareus	[02:01:16] _FrnchFrgg_ linked the crisisGM  a while back:  http://www.bismutnetwork.com/04CrisisGeneralMidi/Soundfont3.0Sheet.htm   http://www.emu-france.com/?wpfb_dl=4229 [02:01:16]

2016-10-25 17:57:02	rgareus	[02:01:35] it's a few 1.6 GB though [02:01:35]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	NoteOn	[02:01:51] Stuzz: u use this? [02:01:51]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Stuzz	[02:02:01] NoCode: No [02:02:01]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Stuzz	[02:03:19] I use this Salamander Grand Piano - http://freepats.zenvoid.org/Piano/acoustic-grand-piano.html [02:03:19]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	LAbot	[02:03:21] Title: FreePats project - Acoustic Grand Piano (at freepats.zenvoid.org) [02:03:21]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	rgareus	[02:05:23] the Salamander is quite good.   Still pianoteq (if you can afford it) goes a step further -- and hey, they have linux LV2s. [02:05:23]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	rgareus	[02:05:44] depends what you do.  if it's /just a piano in a rock song/   or a piano concerto. [02:05:44]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Stuzz	[02:06:04] I got an Axiom 61 the other week and tried the Pianoteq demo.  It is very nice [02:06:04]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Stuzz	[02:06:20] I currently attempting the learn piano [02:06:20]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Stuzz	[02:06:57] I'm actually using the LittleLizzardPiano which is based on the Salamander, but much smaller [02:06:57]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Stuzz	[02:07:05] Still sounds good to me [02:07:05]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Stuzz	[02:07:51] It's here (amongst other things) - http://www.bandshed.net/sounds/sfz/ [02:07:51]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	LAbot	[02:07:52] Title: Index of /sounds/sfz (at www.bandshed.net) [02:07:52]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	rgareus	[02:08:47] yeah there are lots of piano samples which are more than good enough for a lot of things.  Piano, I have a hard time to hear the "real" one. [02:08:47]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	rgareus	[02:09:37] it needs a good pianist and piece to noice the diffeence. [02:09:37]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Stuzz	[02:10:12] True [02:10:12]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	rgareus	[02:10:13] *notice* [02:10:13]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Stuzz	[02:10:32] Maybe if I can play piano one day, I'd *need* Pianoteq [02:10:32]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	rgareus	[02:11:28] Stuzz: after seeing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aln6DztAsMQ I was tempted to challenge pianoteq to also emulate that :) [02:11:28]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	 *	Stuzz [02:12:26] bookmarks for later [02:12:26]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	rgareus	[02:13:08] if you get a chance to see Nils Frahm live,   take it.  after that you'll either be doubly motivated to learn piano even faster ... or give up immediately :) [02:13:08]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Stuzz	[02:13:10] Nils Frahm?  Not to be confused with nils who's 'round these parts sometimes [02:13:10]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	NoteOn	[02:24:17] is that using looper? [02:24:17]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	NoteOn	[02:24:19] =tube [02:24:19]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	NoteOn	[02:24:59] a-aa-a-a--a-a-a-a--a-a-a-a-a- this kind part ... biibibibibibibibibibib------ [02:24:59]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	rgareus	[02:27:59] ? [02:27:59]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	rgareus	[02:29:18] do you mean the part around 6:30 in the "Toilet Brushes" video? [02:29:18]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	NoteOn	[02:29:24] sorry I mean player uses looper that means realtime recording and loop. not pre recorded. [02:29:24]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	rgareus	[02:29:46] I'm not even sure if it's a looper.  [02:29:46]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	NoteOn	[02:30:09] ya 0:39 to 1:32 etc [02:30:09]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	rgareus	[02:30:39] there's a "echo/delay" fx [02:30:39]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	rgareus	[02:32:06] but some things that sound like a loop are actually played...  slighly different nuances [02:32:06]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	NoteOn	[02:36:35] ic [02:36:35]

2016-10-26 03:07:13	rgareus	ristic: and yes it fixes that issue if you have latent effects on the master bus (such as a lookahead limiter)
2016-10-26 03:09:01	ristic	So if I disable those latency creating plugins on the mater bus, in theory (before this fix) the exported audio should be aligned correctly?

2016-10-26 03:10:41	rgareus	that's another long story. Tdeally there'd be 3 way bypass:      "hard-bypass (no latency)",  "bypass (latent)",  "active (latent)".

2016-10-26 03:16:03	rgareus	ristic: since you've had issues in the past, it'd be great if you could confirm the fix when you have some time.
2016-10-26 03:16:38	ristic	A send before the plugins? Something like this: https://imgur.com/a/OT1dC

2016-10-26 03:18:05	rgareus	ristic: that send is a feeback loop
2016-10-26 03:18:12	ristic	What I mean by the screenshot rgareus is, could I in theory export the 'master no latency' track and
2016-10-26 03:18:15	rgareus	ristic: it goes to a track which itself is connected to master
2016-10-26 03:18:24	ristic	Oops, forot to disconnect the master.
2016-10-26 03:18:59	rgareus	ristic: with current git, you don't need that workaround
2016-10-26 03:19:49	ristic	But it would in theory work with 5.4? I don't really want to work on my current projects with a git build.
2016-10-26 03:20:17	rgareus	ristic: in theory, yes.
2016-10-26 03:20:54	ristic	Ok, well I'll give it and the fix a shot and give some feedback later.
2016-10-26 03:21:14	rgareus	but the export won't be "limited" by the limiter.. which somewhat defeats the purpose of adding it in the first place :)
2016-10-26 03:21:31	ristic	Yeah
2016-10-26 03:22:05	ristic	What I was thinking was to simplify not having to delete the plugins and then load them up and set the setting again etc.
2016-10-26 03:22:26	ristic	I guess having two sessions, one for mix and one for master is the way to go.
2016-10-26 03:23:30	ristic	But it's nice to hear a demo of something that is limited :)
2016-10-26 03:23:35	ristic	LOUDER
2016-10-26 03:27:01	rgareus	ristic: actually since Ardour 5.4, bypass should properly update the latency (no need to remove the plugin anymore)
2016-10-26 03:30:57	the_CLA_2	Does the Calf Limiter actually WORK? Last time I tested it didn't really limit to the set value.
2016-10-26 03:32:06	ristic	Seems to for me. I have aur/calf-git 0.0.60.r2370.e7daf55-1 from the Arch Linux AUR.
2016-10-26 03:32:29	ristic	What would you recommend in terms of limiters the_CLA_2?

2016-10-26 03:36:11	ristic	Hmm, will have to check the zam one. Didn't know there was a limiter in the pack.

2016-10-26 05:20:18	vald	I would love to be able to edit tracks in the editor windows (meaning reverse, etc)
2016-10-26 05:21:08	rgareus	reverse should be possible.  but waveform editing in general is not planned (arodur is non destructive)
2016-10-26 05:22:09	rgareus	vald:  Region > Edit > Reverse  (Alt+4)
2016-10-26 05:22:34	vald	really?
2016-10-26 05:23:01	vald	can I add a reverb to a reverse track, then put the track back forward and let the reverb stay reversed?
2016-10-26 05:23:19	rgareus	vald: no. not directly.  
2016-10-26 05:23:24	rgareus	effects are always added "live".
2016-10-26 05:23:29	nick_m	vald, sure. i do it a lot
2016-10-26 05:23:53	vald	I could route the reverb output to a track input and record the reverb to a track?
2016-10-26 05:23:54	rgareus	but you can duplicate the region onto a different track,  reverse it there for reverb
2016-10-26 05:24:08	rgareus	vald: yes, or "bounce with processing"
2016-10-26 05:24:26	vald	I just want the reverb, not the orignal track
2016-10-26 05:24:33	nick_m	vald, you have to to it "manually" .. reverse the track, set up a new track to record the reverb, record the reverb, trim, reverse the original and the reverb again.
2016-10-26 05:24:41	vald	the reverse "ghost" of the track
2016-10-26 05:25:04	vald	I will try tonight

2016-10-26 05:25:44	vald	thanks nick_m
2016-10-26 05:26:23	nick_m	vald, jconvolver is great for this kind of stuff, but a bit fiddly. its the old school way where getting it right may take some time
2016-10-26 05:27:03	the_CLA_2	nick_m: What is your favorite reverb to do reverse effects? I think zita kinda sounded "too natural" for such an effect, when I tried it, IIRC.

2016-10-26 06:28:00	OvenWerks	MaurizioB: anyway, the point is that for ardouvy you should use a good size buffr to not loose anything on a refresh.

2016-10-26 06:44:37	OvenWerks	tom meter values are sent on a timed basis
2016-10-26 06:44:51	tom-	are we talking a *java applet* running in the browser or standalone?
2016-10-26 06:45:12	OvenWerks	tom-: in the end we don't know... 
2016-10-26 06:45:38	tom-	OvenWerks: metering is a prime case to make compromises
2016-10-26 06:46:01	OvenWerks	for Control it runs on top of the phonegap app.
2016-10-26 06:46:31	tom-	you can either be late (i.e. collect some before sending), have a datastorm or a meter that is not very fluid and anything in between
2016-10-26 06:46:31		[06:46]
2016-10-26 06:46:32	OvenWerks	tom-: that is why it uses a timer. It can also be turned off. head possition is a nother case

2016-10-26 06:47:52	tom-	meter position less so

2016-10-26 06:52:31	OvenWerks	tom-: banking on the Ardour side means data tranfer is limited to bank size.

2016-10-26 06:55:01	OvenWerks	(it allows manual port setting)
2016-10-26 06:55:23	tom-	OvenWerks: my last experiments were lower-level, trying out to send these "packed" osc bundles from a microcrontroller and process it like osc on the host

2016-10-26 07:01:22	tom-	well it was a bit out of the blue
2016-10-26 07:03:04	tom-	there could be generic test procedures to test compliance and compatibility of/between ocs libraries
2016-10-26 07:03:04		[07:03]

2016-10-26 07:06:16	tom-	OvenWerks: re metering: if ardour would be very smart, it could send chunks of metering data in advance as one message
2016-10-26 07:06:41	tom-	but that again would imply a lot. so nothing realistic
2016-10-26 07:07:57	tom-	and movements of divs or similar in a browser at the same rate as in ardour ui aren't that practical

2016-10-26 07:31:23	OvenWerks	tom-: control surfaces are generally for humans to read. meter sync in this case is not very important.
2016-10-26 07:33:47	OvenWerks	tom-: I think bundling will make a large difference from perpacket. Worrying about the savings of omitting parameter type is more trouble than it is worth I think.
2016-10-26 07:34:38	OvenWerks	tom-: to do that means the controler has to be increasingly smart... my findings are that controllers are incredibly dumb
2016-10-26 07:40:00		[07:34]
2016-10-26 07:41:34	tom-	OvenWerks: that calls for scripting glue :)

2016-10-26 07:42:46	tom-	doesn't exclude scripting glue!
2016-10-26 07:42:56	OvenWerks	tom-: the average user already thinks this stuff is too hard to set up and needs a tutorial...
2016-10-26 07:43:16	tom-	a script could customly guide the user!
2016-10-26 07:43:50	tom-	you don't want to hardcode that!
2016-10-26 07:43:51	OvenWerks	tom-: Control has scripting (it is the only way I could get things working well)
2016-10-26 07:44:42	tom-	the scripting can be on either side, but assuming there are dump controllers without it, it's safe to put it to the other side
2016-10-26 07:45:33	tom-	because a 3rd "side" intermediary is a no-go PNP wise, it seems
2016-10-26 07:45:41	OvenWerks	tom-: I used scripting just to be able to send a 4 parameter message, most android controllers (including paid for) only do one... and do not allow you to choose type.
2016-10-26 07:46:25	OvenWerks	tom-: I know you love scripting :) you will have to work that out with rg
2016-10-26 07:46:33	tom-	it's absurd to think that you can handle all controllers with static api
2016-10-26 07:46:50	tom-	controller variability can only be handled with glue in a reasonable way
2016-10-26 07:46:59	OvenWerks	tom-: effectively the API OSC connects to is static

2016-10-26 07:47:59	OvenWerks	tom there are settings that can be changed on the fly.
2016-10-26 07:48:19	OvenWerks	midnams are not scripts, just settings
2016-10-26 07:48:20	tom-	and osc could be so much more useful than midnam
2016-10-26 07:48:46	OvenWerks	tom-: feel free to add to my code.
2016-10-26 07:49:08	tom-	OvenWerks: the midnam says (iirc): "i send you this, you do that"
2016-10-26 07:49:27	tom-	OvenWerks: the osc api says "you need to send me this for me to do that"
2016-10-26 07:49:49	tom-	OvenWerks: with a scripting layer you can make that better. and also add minimal state handling that's probably missing on device
2016-10-26 07:49:53	OvenWerks	tom-: I will only move as fast as I move, and my priorities are mine. (I have a list)
2016-10-26 07:50:34	OvenWerks	actually that is not correct, settings can change what OSC sends back or does for at least some incoming messages.
2016-10-26 07:51:09	tom-	OvenWerks: we just have a different design approach on how to easily couple ardour with other stuff osc-wise i guess
2016-10-26 07:51:53	OvenWerks	tom-: you are thinking in the, I am making a controller, right now I am thinking in the what do most people use/need to work with.

2016-10-26 07:58:18	tom-	OvenWerks: it's some years ago though. the intermediary helped greatly to make a nice initial handshake and keep some state
2016-10-26 07:58:31	tom-	OvenWerks: for a touchosc surface
2016-10-26 07:59:15	tom-	OvenWerks: it was using a slightly modified osc api. las was at the time not interested to have a look at it
2016-10-26 08:00:01	tom-	the tests were quite promising. i'd say it was better than anything i've seen since (does that sound arrogant?)
2016-10-26 08:00:04	rgareus	nyntx: there are very few good use-cases in Ardour for  freezing midi to audio.
2016-10-26 08:00:22	tom-	then scripting arrived in ardour. great! now let's close the gap
2016-10-26 08:02:08	rgareus	nyntx: the only ones I can think of is to save CPU power (heavy synths)  or to share sessions with someone who does not have a given synth (plugin/hardware)

2016-10-26 08:17:44	tom-	i agree that hardcoded support for a specific controller like push2 can be PNP
2016-10-26 08:19:59	melanie__	what do you mean with middlewear?
2016-10-26 08:20:08	tom-	but to support *many* controllers, the path of hardcoding should be left

2016-10-26 08:21:27	rgareus	some software in the middle.    ardour talks to  /middleware/ ;  middleware talks to the actual controller

2016-10-26 08:23:04	tom-	and portable
2016-10-26 08:23:23	rgareus	it's quite common for translating OSC messages.
2016-10-26 08:24:03	tom-	you could look at it in a graphical way
2016-10-26 08:24:18	rgareus	UX sucks though.  but hackers love the flexibility of middleware for control surfaces
2016-10-26 08:24:18	tom-	you have the ardour library and the gtk gui
2016-10-26 08:24:34	tom-	the gtk gui can change, the function remain the same
2016-10-26 08:24:46	rgareus	tom-: there's no middleware there
2016-10-26 08:24:58	tom-	a view onto the ardour's methods etc should be like a gui, a customized view on it
2016-10-26 08:25:08	rgareus	tom-: you describe an API
2016-10-26 08:25:28	tom-	that's why mapping (and in case of osc scripting to access other info) is good
2016-10-26 08:25:28		[08:25]
2016-10-26 08:25:43	melanie__	it would be more interessing to find a way to send over the osc funktions to a controller

2016-10-26 08:26:08	rgareus	melanie__: the other way 'round
2016-10-26 08:26:19	rgareus	melanie__: have a controller announce its functions to the host.

2016-10-26 08:26:33	melanie__	that would be best ;)
2016-10-26 08:27:00	melanie__	and zeroconf for finding together
2016-10-26 08:27:31	melanie__	network needs dhcp though but that is easy to do
2016-10-26 08:28:43	tom-	controller announces to host, host announces to controller. who cares? as long as there is middleware that can solve it :)
2016-10-26 08:30:06	rgareus	tom-: those users who need to launch and configure the middleware care :)
2016-10-26 08:30:25	rgareus	and it's one more API to maintain.
2016-10-26 08:30:34	melanie__	one mre piece that can make it harder to configure

2016-10-26 08:30:53	melanie__	one more piece of software to have bugs and fail
2016-10-26 08:31:27	tom-	we know that ardour lua has access to and control over most things in ardour. it's scriptable. controller integration with the help of it seems almost served on a silver tablet
2016-10-26 08:31:44	tom-	what is obvious for some is bs for others :)
2016-10-26 08:32:49	tom-	rgareus: melanie__ the middleware lives as a script inside ardour, what i'm trying to say
2016-10-26 08:33:32	tom-	if a controller wants to use osc, that's just a middleware that maps some ardour methods
2016-10-26 08:33:45	melanie__	hm
2016-10-26 08:33:48	tom-	living inside ardour
2016-10-26 08:34:01	rgareus	tom-: probably not in the foreseeable future
2016-10-26 08:34:09	tom-	if another controller wants to send other osc messages, you just put another mapping
2016-10-26 08:34:15	rgareus	tom-: at least not in a scriptable way
2016-10-26 08:34:17	tom-	or slightly different protocol handling
2016-10-26 08:34:26	tom-	concerning feedbak etc

2016-10-26 08:34:46	rgareus	tom-: I tried again.. and gave up on scriptable control surfaces recently
2016-10-26 08:35:20	rgareus	getting scriptable surfaces right is more complicated than just writing one in C++
2016-10-26 08:35:31	melanie__	to make it clear i say it with the word of the linux god torvald "if you want to interface with hardware use c not even c++"
2016-10-26 08:35:39	melanie__	and he s right

2016-10-26 08:36:17	tom-	rgareus: what did you try?
2016-10-26 08:36:34	OvenWerks	tom-: most OSC controllers have mappings (because OSC is so open/unstandardised) Ardour should now be able to work well with touch OSC.
2016-10-26 08:36:39	rgareus	melanie__: for complex interaction, particularly surfaces with displays and such.  I'd built on top in C++
2016-10-26 08:36:44	melanie__	rgareus: yes but we can keep that for us ;)
2016-10-26 08:37:28	melanie__	i usually devide it in higher level and lower level code 
2016-10-26 08:37:48	tom-	melanie__: if you stick in a usb-key, that's hardware at it's best. but the things that it triggers can be very high-levelish (ie show a mount dialog or similar)
2016-10-26 08:37:58	melanie__	but in the end it comes down to use c c++ or a dialect of them
2016-10-26 08:37:59	tom-	don't want to hack an xdialog in c
2016-10-26 08:39:03	tom-	i think you underestimate the power of pre compiled vs. interpreted (or similar)

2016-10-26 08:40:03	tom-	could we agree it needs less to change a script and make it run again
2016-10-26 08:40:14	rgareus	tom-: I tried using a lua script for the maschine2 interface.  and threading bit bad.
2016-10-26 08:40:51	OvenWerks	tom-, melanie__: OSC controllers are really _still_ very young even considering how long OSC has been around. Most of them are effectively broken when it comes to reacting to feedback.
2016-10-26 08:40:51		[08:40]
2016-10-26 08:41:02	tom-	this means someone doesn't even need the ardour build stack. just a device, some interest and he/she can come up with a script that can be added like a midnam to ardour
2016-10-26 08:41:30	melanie__	hm change a script fast reminds me of someone at work and then nothing works anymore
2016-10-26 08:41:53	tom-	rgareus: interesting
2016-10-26 08:42:11	tom-	rgareus: did i dream that or do you also have studio montiros now?
2016-10-26 08:42:17	rgareus	tom-: binding signals from at least 3 different thread contexts into a single interpreter pushes a lot of complexity into the script.  the alternative to use different interpreters likewise.
2016-10-26 08:42:18	melanie__	OvenWerks: yes they are
2016-10-26 08:42:31	OvenWerks	for example, most tablet OSC controllers set the state of a button based on what the user does rather than what the feedback says.
2016-10-26 08:42:54	rgareus	tom-: one cannot just interrupt a script interpreter.  so there'll have to be "sync" points.
2016-10-26 08:43:13	tom-	rgareus: if the script gets more complicated than needed in c++ it's certainly not convenient
2016-10-26 08:43:36	tom-	rgareus: why are there 3 threads needed?
2016-10-26 08:43:42	MaurizioB	OvenWerks: good to know, thanks
2016-10-26 08:44:44	OvenWerks	so a user touches a button-> sends "1"-> surface coulrs button to signify on->DAW sends button on->user lifts finger->surface turns switch off :P
2016-10-26 08:44:50	tom-	OvenWerks: yes, but that's not even at the level of any decades old midi device that knows "local off" ;)
2016-10-26 08:45:12	tom-	OvenWerks: why? because the feedback path would require middleware
2016-10-26 08:45:14	MaurizioB	OvenWerks: I think that I might be able to use a variable size buffer (so I'd be able to change its size as the tracklist grows), but I really need to get the documentation, I don't even remember what I used for OSC
2016-10-26 08:46:03	OvenWerks	tom-: no tyhe feedback does not require middle ware only a working button...

2016-10-26 08:48:00	tom-	well there are round buttons, square buttons, toggle buttons, tri-state buttons, mutli-super-duper buttons, and more. how would you possibly handle them without middleware or an agreed-on protocol
2016-10-26 08:49:01	tom-	you can handle a case that makes some assumptions already
2016-10-26 08:49:43	rgareus	tom-: gui actions (e.g. toggle snap, selection chage),  libardour callbacks (e.g. solo/mute change)   and device communication itself (read/write to hw)
2016-10-26 08:49:46	OvenWerks	tom-: all controllers at this time seem to assume there will be no feedback
2016-10-26 08:50:25	OvenWerks	tom-: if there is anything that allows feedback, it expects the feedback to exactly mirror the sent messages
2016-10-26 08:52:06	OvenWerks	making switches work correctly means only one extra parameter that determines if the switch on indication is local or remote. Toggles can be both, momentary buttons not.
2016-10-26 08:52:19	tom-	rgareus: the maschine is a nice device. does it feel / work good?
2016-10-26 08:54:08	tom-	OvenWerks: if i could give you a hint you should not hardcode against that standard (no feedback) but accept middleware to make it work
2016-10-26 08:54:14	tom-	OvenWerks: :)
2016-10-26 08:54:22	melanie__	momentary are better in my opinion anyways you have the switch and for indication the led which is in that case advantage

2016-10-26 08:55:28	tom-	how do they relate to the button etc
2016-10-26 08:56:04	tom-	it's hard to imply every controllers logic and principles in a static osc api
2016-10-26 08:56:04		[08:56]
2016-10-26 08:56:08	OvenWerks	middleware can't make up for broken controllers.
2016-10-26 08:56:15	melanie__	thay light up the button you toggled ?
2016-10-26 08:56:24	tom-	that's designed for a non-middleware scenario that cannot work for 99% of controllers
2016-10-26 08:57:01	tom-	well, you can trigger "play" for sure

2016-10-26 08:57:16	tom-	huge step from midi
2016-10-26 08:58:18	melanie__	just trigger play?
2016-10-26 08:58:27	melanie__	not much
2016-10-26 08:59:29	OvenWerks	toggles that light their led on press are ok so long as the LED is set before sending message. The daw can then turn it off again in the case of invalide press. (record not available for example.)
2016-10-26 08:59:55	tom-	if you have to hardcode multiple entry points for the same method thats violating the DRY rule
2016-10-26 09:00:07	OvenWerks	transport needs "press buttons" that send 1 one on press and maybe a 0 on release
2016-10-26 09:00:30	melanie__	yes the toggle comes exclusive from ardour 
2016-10-26 09:01:33	OvenWerks	Most OSC surfaces will only accept feddback the same a sent, so it it only sends 1 it will not receive 0. If the LED is set locally... the LED state will most of the time be wrong
2016-10-26 09:02:02	tom-	please remind the gui analogy. a controller wants to look at ardour in a custom way, like a user changing colors and fontsizes in the editor ui
2016-10-26 09:02:16	OvenWerks	melanie__: not true, togglable state buttons for rec/mute/solo are common in the OSC world.
2016-10-26 09:02:32	tom-	a user is also just a special human case of a controller
2016-10-26 09:02:52	OvenWerks	in such case the controller becomes middleware
2016-10-26 09:05:11	melanie__	interaction hardware human nad software is not easy 
2016-10-26 09:05:35	melanie__	arour send move that strip human touches and strip moves away 
2016-10-26 09:06:03	OvenWerks	melanie__: there are two ways to deal with state buttons, the button sends a press and the daw decides what to do with it (probably toogle, select from a radio set, etc). Others are more open if just the state is sent 1 for on 0 for off. In this case a toggle on the controller side is better. This does mean the controller can send a 1 and always know it is turning rec on not off or sending a 0 is always off.
2016-10-26 09:06:19	melanie__	in that case the controller needs to have the last word 
2016-10-26 09:07:11	tom-	OvenWerks: there is no standard for these kinds of things, best practices at best
2016-10-26 09:07:48	OvenWerks	I think mute/solo/record (and some others) are good canididates for the controllers sends the state rather than the press.
2016-10-26 09:08:41	melanie__	yes if done in software or mechanical does not matter but for mute/solo/record true
2016-10-26 09:09:15	OvenWerks	other button presses are better done with no feedback and rather a text display.
2016-10-26 09:09:53	OvenWerks	banking for example needs the feedback not that the bank has changed but where to.
2016-10-26 09:09:58	melanie__	or other indication but yes some ndication is needed for feedback
2016-10-26 09:10:22	OvenWerks	in that case track names change
2016-10-26 09:11:40	OvenWerks	The way things are now in Ardour's OSC, there are some things the controller would have to remember the state of... for example the user has switches to only audio inputs or just buses

2016-10-26 09:43:40	OvenWerks	[19:43:34] they are both tuned towards MB use with some things Ben mentioned he would like to see. I could make others though. [19:43:34]

2016-10-26 09:44:40	tom-	a massiv block, to be operated with two hands!?
2016-10-26 09:44:57	OvenWerks	tom-: the comments I got where that OSC seems to be unreliable for anything more than that.
2016-10-26 09:46:01	tom-	OvenWerks: with a middleware or script in-between, touchosc can be very very powerful
2016-10-26 09:46:16	tom-	OvenWerks: you can't even get a gist of that if you only see the surface in the designer
2016-10-26 09:46:42	tom-	OvenWerks: las should donate the money for you to get touchosc to do the ping pong
2016-10-26 09:46:50	OvenWerks	tom-: to be honest, for what the mb one does I would use a second computer keyboard with middleware like midikb
2016-10-26 09:47:43	OvenWerks	tom-: the money is not the thing, it is cheap. google doesn't seem to have a payonce option.
2016-10-26 09:48:02	OvenWerks	(google playstore)
2016-10-26 09:48:47	OvenWerks	tom-: I have money sitting in paypal right now.
2016-10-26 09:49:27	tom-	OvenWerks: las should donate anyway the money for you to get touchosc :)
2016-10-26 09:50:17	OvenWerks	tom-: he already speads some money around to other devs once the limit is passed.
2016-10-26 09:50:53	tom-	sounds good

2016-10-26 09:56:40	MaurizioB	tom-: pressure for positive things, I hope
2016-10-26 09:57:01	tom-	yes, not bad things. interesting et al
2016-10-26 09:57:08	MaurizioB	tom-: that's good, then :)
2016-10-26 09:58:10	tom-	yes, but time is limited :|
2016-10-26 09:58:49	MaurizioB	I know, but that doesn't always mean it's a bad thing
2016-10-26 09:58:49		[09:58]
2016-10-26 09:59:40	tom-	it's natural. we can measure it
2016-10-26 10:00:11	MaurizioB	and can be a stimulus
2016-10-26 10:00:23	MaurizioB	imagine what would happen if we had all the time we want
2016-10-26 10:00:32	tom-	in some instances indeed
2016-10-26 10:00:45	MaurizioB	but, yes, I get what you mean
2016-10-26 10:01:02	tom-	do you know this scenario? you should do a, but then you do b that was something else you moved forward in time

2016-10-26 10:01:43	tom-	strange
2016-10-26 10:01:46	MaurizioB	and, actually, what I crave is not the time, but the ability to be focused on things
2016-10-26 10:02:25	tom-	yes
2016-10-26 10:02:44	MaurizioB	that's why I declared that the next week I'll be on "vacation", which actually means I'll have no "external work", but time and energy for personal projects
2016-10-26 10:02:56	MaurizioB	which is, anyway, work :)
2016-10-26 10:03:19	tom-	good plan :)
2016-10-26 10:05:28	MaurizioB	part of that work, btw, is to finish setting up my new pc, finally getting to know Ardour5 and prepare the work for the new OSC support on ArdouVy :)
2016-10-26 10:06:01	MaurizioB	two years after those chat we had, we're finally here :)
2016-10-26 10:06:17	tom-	fantastic! :)
2016-10-26 10:08:07	tom-	you will like ardour5.x i think.. maybe also the scripting things, which could wake up ideas on how to talk ardouvy
2016-10-26 10:08:21	MaurizioB	tom-: I was thinking about that too
2016-10-26 10:09:51	MaurizioB	even if I don't really like the idea of having two "things" to install, what I'd want for ArdouVy is that it should work "out of the box". But I might consider a way to make it "expandable"
2016-10-26 10:10:46	OvenWerks	MaurizioB: Ardouvy should be able to set Ardour up. If not, I am willing to expand.
2016-10-26 10:11:04	MaurizioB	OvenWerks: what do you mean?
2016-10-26 10:11:53	tom-	custom protocols (i guess)
2016-10-26 10:12:14	OvenWerks	the controller should be able to tell Ardour what the banksize is, what feedback it wants, what types of tracks it wants to see and what fader math it would like.

2016-10-26 10:13:48	OvenWerks	MaurizioB: if you are able to set what port you talk from and can get your feedback on that, you don't even have to set the port.
2016-10-26 10:14:31	OvenWerks	MaurizioB: if there is something missing, I am willing to add more.

2016-10-26 10:15:48	OvenWerks	with my open stage control setup, so long as OSC is enabled, I have one connect/refresh button and everything just works.
2016-10-26 10:16:27	tom-	you should possibly document the (hardcoded) scenario of host<->controller talk very well
2016-10-26 10:16:43	OvenWerks	With Control, I have to set feddback port to manual and enter it first. (same touchOSC)
2016-10-26 10:17:12	OvenWerks	tom-: I thought it was :) but I am not very good at explaining things.
2016-10-26 10:17:25	MaurizioB	OvenWerks: do you mean the ardour osc port?
2016-10-26 10:18:00	OvenWerks	MaurizioB: no, the control surface port.
2016-10-26 10:18:08	OvenWerks	the one Ardour sends to.

2016-10-26 10:18:56	OvenWerks	MaurizioB: if the controller sends and receives from the same port A sets itself up to that port on its own.

2016-10-26 10:20:46	OvenWerks	Ardour's receive port is normally 3819 and can only be changed with a text edit. but the port it sends to is normally the port it receives from. It can be optionally set from the gui to a fixed port.
2016-10-26 10:21:41	MaurizioB	OvenWerks: I'd need to re-read my code, I really don't remember what I did and how :)
2016-10-26 10:22:04	tom-	MaurizioB: it just worked :)

2016-10-26 10:32:12	tom-	if you can't draw a multicontroller scenario involving some of the beauty of the api it's probably too complicated
2016-10-26 10:33:08	tom-	you can then pin down names for stuff and refer to that unambiguously

2016-10-26 10:38:14	OvenWerks	tom-: that would be helpful.
2016-10-26 10:38:25	tom-	rgareus: is the surface you have doing osc?
2016-10-26 10:38:36	OvenWerks	midi I think

2016-10-26 10:39:03	OvenWerks	he was talking about a USB to MIDI port
2016-10-26 10:39:09	tom-	rgareus: the one you have at your desk
2016-10-26 10:39:17	rgareus	tom-: which one  on my desk ?

2016-10-26 10:43:31	tom-	rgareus: is it talking a custom protocol?

2016-10-26 10:45:52		[10:45]
2016-10-26 10:46:24	tom-	hm, but are you reverse-engineering it or is there documentation available?
2016-10-26 10:46:25	rgareus	though I suppose, someone could write an emulator for my handwriting.
2016-10-26 10:47:39	rgareus	NI Maschine2 is pretty straight foward.   there's no official documentation, but there's prior art and it's easy to discover

2016-10-26 10:49:33	tom-	but why wouldn't they document it?

2016-10-26 10:51:17	tom-	hm
2016-10-26 10:51:26	rgareus	tom-: they probably have some "internal specs"  which is complete for the whole device and also includes some <secrets> for the hwardware.
2016-10-26 10:51:43	tom-	sort of?
2016-10-26 10:51:51	rgareus	I'm just guessing
2016-10-26 10:51:57	tom-	reflashing or such
2016-10-26 10:52:14	rgareus	and schematics and layouts and...
2016-10-26 10:52:31	rgareus	someone would have to copy only the relevant parts and put them somewhere.
2016-10-26 10:53:30	rgareus	and documentation is no fun. and they probably can't justify to pay someone for it.
2016-10-26 10:53:30	tom-	that sounds like an artificial problem
2016-10-26 10:53:30	rgareus	well, I don't know.  ask  NI.
2016-10-26 10:53:41	rgareus	why should they publish it?
2016-10-26 10:54:01	tom-	right! all the reverse engineering fun would be gone! :)
2016-10-26 10:54:08	rgareus	anyway, it's just a simple struct:  https://github.com/Ardour/ardour/blob/27305439683cad75650daf4efce196ffe61a2825/libs/surfaces/maschine2/m2_dev_mk2.h#L47
2016-10-26 10:54:09	tom-	not everyone can do
2016-10-26 10:54:23	rgareus	no reverse engineering needed.  the device itself follows the HID spec
2016-10-26 10:54:53	tom-	nicely done
2016-10-26 10:54:55	rgareus	just which bit corresponds to which button.  takes about 5 mins
2016-10-26 10:56:04	rgareus	drawing to the screen is a bit more obscure.  but also straing forward.  it's not unlike xbm (x-bitmap)

2016-10-26 11:02:25	tom-	rgareus: i like your attitude
2016-10-26 11:03:43	tom-	it could be an experiment to "capsule" such a controller as an osc object outside ardour and let it talk to ardour via osc
2016-10-26 11:03:46	rgareus	OvenWerks: in lsusb, the NI shows up at     bInterfaceClass  3 Human Interface Device
2016-10-26 11:03:59	rgareus	OvenWerks: and linux automatically adds the device nodes.
2016-10-26 11:04:27	tom-	the api would rapidly change to fit (other/yet unknown) needs i speculate
2016-10-26 11:05:32	rgareus	OvenWerks: default permissions are still a problem.   the Push2 is autoatically added to the "audio" group on las' debian maschine.  the NI here is not (I've added a udev.rule file to git)

2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[20:47:39] NI Maschine2 is pretty straight foward.   there's no official documentation, but there's prior art and it's easy to discover [20:47:39]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[20:48:25] It sends a N byte message. always all all buttons + knobs on every change. [20:48:25]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	tom-	[20:48:39] i see [20:48:39]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	tom-	[20:49:33] but why wouldn't they document it? [20:49:33]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[20:50:38] time is money [20:50:38]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	tom-	[20:51:17] hm [20:51:17]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[20:51:26] tom-: they probably have some "internal specs"  which is complete for the whole device and also includes some <secrets> for the hwardware. [20:51:26]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	tom-	[20:51:43] sort of? [20:51:43]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[20:51:51] I'm just guessing [20:51:51]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	tom-	[20:51:57] reflashing or such [20:51:57]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[20:52:14] and schematics and layouts and... [20:52:14]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[20:52:31] someone would have to copy only the relevant parts and put them somewhere. [20:52:31]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[20:53:30] and documentation is no fun. and they probably can't justify to pay someone for it. [20:53:30]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	tom-	[20:53:30] that sounds like an artificial problem [20:53:30]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[20:53:30] well, I don't know.  ask  NI. [20:53:30]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[20:53:41] why should they publish it? [20:53:41]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	tom-	[20:54:01] right! all the reverse engineering fun would be gone! :) [20:54:01]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[20:54:08] anyway, it's just a simple struct:  https://github.com/Ardour/ardour/blob/27305439683cad75650daf4efce196ffe61a2825/libs/surfaces/maschine2/m2_dev_mk2.h#L47 [20:54:08]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	tom-	[20:54:09] not everyone can do [20:54:09]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[20:54:23] no reverse engineering needed.  the device itself follows the HID spec [20:54:23]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	tom-	[20:54:53] nicely done [20:54:53]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[20:54:55] just which bit corresponds to which button.  takes about 5 mins [20:54:55]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[20:56:04] drawing to the screen is a bit more obscure.  but also straing forward.  it's not unlike xbm (x-bitmap) [20:56:04]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	tom-	[20:57:31] what about a totally different approach that would make the HID/low-level/c++ io with the device seperate from ardour (and make it accessible outside ardour) and then couple that with ardour via existing ardour io facilities like osc [20:57:31]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[20:58:16] tom-: HID is kernel provided  on all OS [20:58:16]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[20:58:38] Human Interface Device -- like your mouse or keyboard [20:58:38]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[20:58:56] ardour just opens the device. [20:58:56]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	OvenWerks	[20:59:26] rgareus: so my midikb would "just work" with it then [20:59:26]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	OvenWerks	[20:59:59] (for key input anyway) [20:59:59]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[21:00:01] OvenWerks: I don't know [21:00:01]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[21:00:16] OvenWerks: interpreting the messages meaningfully  is left to the application [21:00:16]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	OvenWerks	[21:00:24] rgareus: does it show up in /dev/input [21:00:24]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	tom-	[21:00:32] rgareus: i see, so that's not much different to interact with any serial device xy using protocol z [21:00:32]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[21:00:39] OvenWerks: /dev/hidraw* [21:00:39]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	frinknet	[21:00:56] Just did my first commercial session on Ardour! Loving it! [21:00:56]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	tom-	[21:01:08] rgareus: i have custom serial controller, would you hardcode support please? :) [21:01:08]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	OvenWerks	[21:01:34] rgareus: different then [21:01:34]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[21:02:00] tom-: send me one for evaluation. [21:02:00]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	tom-	[21:02:25] rgareus: i like your attitude [21:02:25]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	tom-	[21:03:43] it could be an experiment to "capsule" such a controller as an osc object outside ardour and let it talk to ardour via osc [21:03:43]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[21:03:46] OvenWerks: in lsusb, the NI shows up at     bInterfaceClass  3 Human Interface Device [21:03:46]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[21:03:59] OvenWerks: and linux automatically adds the device nodes. [21:03:59]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	tom-	[21:04:27] the api would rapidly change to fit (other/yet unknown) needs i speculate [21:04:27]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[21:05:32] OvenWerks: default permissions are still a problem.   the Push2 is autoatically added to the "audio" group on las' debian maschine.  the NI here is not (I've added a udev.rule file to git) [21:05:32]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	OvenWerks	[21:05:48] rgareus: my keyboard/wiimote create an entry in /dev/input/ with relatively standard ways of relating to them [21:05:48]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[21:05:50] on windows & OSX permissions are set up correctly to talk to the maschine. [21:05:50]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[21:06:09] OvenWerks: keyboards are probably special cased. [21:06:09]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	OvenWerks	[21:06:37] rgareus: keyboards/mice and joysticks? maybe [21:06:37]
2016-10-26 12:54:17	rgareus	[21:07:57] frinknet: I'm glad you had fun and a good time. [21:07:57]

2016-10-26 13:45:26	Bitrunner	Hmm are there any plans for an "edit in external editor/audacity" Function for single Regions? Sometimes this could be handy. Audacity has for example a real great adaptive noise filter which is very helpful from time to time 
2016-10-26 13:46:47	Bitrunner	and there are plenty of highly specialized audiofile editors out there that may have useful functions Ardour won't ever implement itself I think
2016-10-26 13:47:06	avlinux	Bitrunner, Somebody is working on an LV2 Noise Reduction Plugin, perhaps that would work as well
2016-10-26 13:47:22	Bitrunner	avlinux: well, that's only an example for a useful external editor
2016-10-26 13:48:39	rgareus	Bitrunner: it's been on the ToDo list since ages.. but it's not yet implemented.
2016-10-26 13:49:02	rgareus	Bitrunner: audacity might be the only realistic sndfile editor that works x-platform.
2016-10-26 13:49:16	avlinux	Bitrunner, I don't know if my eyes could take going from Ardour's beauty to Audacity's...... um well, interesting interface, kidding (not kidding)
2016-10-26 13:49:28	Bitrunner	avlinux: btw I don't think the way audacity "noise reduction" is possible as a plugin so easy. 
2016-10-26 13:49:42	rgareus	Bitrunner: why not?
2016-10-26 13:50:23	avlinux	Bitrunner, If it's equally adaptive should do the same thing, or not?
2016-10-26 13:50:49	Bitrunner	avlinux: of course, but how to calibrate that?
2016-10-26 13:51:04	rgareus	Bitrunner: you play through it
2016-10-26 13:51:44	avlinux	Bitrunner, I don't know what the GUI is like on the plugin, I haven't tested it yet
2016-10-26 13:51:55	Bitrunner	rgareus: that's not the same. In Audacity, you first select a part of your Track as "noise sample" and then apply the resulting filter to the whole thing
2016-10-26 13:52:08	rgareus	Bitrunner: compare to https://youtu.be/l8Nbf2Jk3pg?t=42s  (also a LV2 plugin)
2016-10-26 13:52:30	Bitrunner	rgareus: ever used the audacity noise reduction? 
2016-10-26 13:52:31	rgareus	LV2s could also analyze a region in the background..
2016-10-26 13:52:34	rgareus	Bitrunner: yes
2016-10-26 13:52:42	rgareus	Bitrunner: and I was never happy with it :)
2016-10-26 13:53:24	Bitrunner	well, ist must be applied very decent and kills all the natural room reflections, too 
2016-10-26 13:53:52	rgareus	the newish spectral editing feats of audacity are neat though.
2016-10-26 13:54:12	Bitrunner	ah that sounds interesting

2016-10-26 13:57:40	Bitrunner	avlinux: but thanks anywaya
2016-10-26 13:57:55	rgareus	Bitrunner: audacity spectral editing example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGku4-CJnzc
2016-10-26 13:58:02	avlinux	Bitrunner, BTW I'm not at all suggesting that opening Audacity from Ardour is a bad idea, simply the more options the better
2016-10-26 13:58:59	rgareus	avlinux: I only just found out that you finished the .sf2 for the AVL Drumkits. that's awesome
2016-10-26 13:59:13	Bitrunner	avlinux: my question was only if someone had that idea before... if it's on "to do" List, all ok. Maybe should get a little more priority since it may take out "customer pressure" to implement the audio-eding-feature of the day ;)
2016-10-26 13:59:26	rgareus	avlinux: are the .midnam more or less fixed -- ie can we bundle them with ardour?
2016-10-26 14:00:19	avlinux	rgareus, Oh, thanks. Yes please do, I emailed them to las months ago, but I'm sure he must have forgotten or had bigger fish to fry
2016-10-26 14:00:19		[14:00]
2016-10-26 14:00:40	avlinux	rgareus, I also talked to Ben about it via email
2016-10-26 14:01:11	avlinux	rgareus, Perhaps las found them to be too peripheral
2016-10-26 14:01:26	rgareus	they're a tad large for bundling,  though only using the 5pc kits and xz (instead of zip) they're 25MB only
2016-10-26 14:01:42	Bitrunner	rgareus: impressive ;)
2016-10-26 14:02:23	rgareus	avlinux: I'm pondering to make ready-to-use presets for a-fluidsynth or something..
2016-10-26 14:02:59	avlinux	rgareus, yes certainly all of them are not needed
2016-10-26 14:03:31	avlinux	rgareus, They are no Drumgizmo or Addictive Drums, but I'm pleased with the quality for Soundfonts, I have commercial Soundfonts that sound far worse :)
2016-10-26 14:05:02	avlinux	rgareus, One could argue a small set of basic but good quality instruments (ie bass, piano, strings) could be appealing

2016-10-26 14:06:11	rgareus	avlinux: something like what the MOD does (since there's no file-selector): a plugin that's /just a drumkit/  drop it in and go.  
2016-10-26 14:06:28	avlinux	rgareus, Pushes the bundle size though, and there aren't many CC-BY-SA licensed or freely licensed SF2's out there
2016-10-26 14:06:28	rgareus	really it's just fluidsynth  but with a fixed .sf2 or preset
2016-10-26 14:06:42	avlinux	rgareus, Yes exactly!
2016-10-26 14:06:52	rgareus	looking at  http://libremusicproduction.com/tutorials/using-avl-drumkits-fluid-synth-ardour   that's 4 steps too many :)

2016-10-26 14:07:10	avlinux	rgareus, :)
2016-10-26 14:07:16	rgareus	if you want a fancy drum-setup,  sure  drumgizmo can deliver  or any complex commercial plugin.
2016-10-26 14:07:57	avlinux	rgareus, I hope to tackle a Drumgizmo kit this winter
2016-10-26 14:08:19	avlinux	rgareus, Our studio now is much better suited to such things
2016-10-26 14:08:29	rgareus	well, a-fluidsynth with AVL loaded..  drag to favorites sidebar (preset).   and then just drag it to some empty space in the mixer  kills 2 steps.

2016-10-26 14:09:11	avlinux	rgareus, That's pretty slick!
2016-10-26 14:10:09	rgareus	I'll look into meta-data  (automatically select percussive mode)  and allowing plugins to ship midnams to the host has been on my ToDo list ever since setBfree can dynamically generate those..
2016-10-26 14:10:30	rgareus	I hope to get there before 5.5. maybe 5.6
2016-10-26 14:11:40	avlinux	rgareus, Wow that would be a great feature, I fired up pedal board with your Leslie on my MOD last night, it's great!
2016-10-26 14:12:38	avlinux	rgareus, Ability to adjust horn and drum speeds would be nice though, instead of presets, I'm assuming there's a reason you did it that way
2016-10-26 14:13:09	rgareus	avlinux: now I have 2 reasons to make a proper GUI for it.  the current one was done by the MOD team
2016-10-26 14:13:31	rgareus	avlinux: Bollie is the 2nd reason. he also plays guitar through it... since he got his MOD yesterday.
2016-10-26 14:14:43	avlinux	rgareus, I rolled back the tone on my guitar and if you play fingerstyle with lots of high drone strings, it can get pretty Hammy sounding (for a guitar)
2016-10-26 14:15:39	rgareus	avlinux: I'm not even sure if it's the extended [configurable] version.  falktx packaged it and did the mod-guis for setBfree.

2016-10-26 14:22:56	Bitrunner	that guy had 2 hours time to relax and prepare for the concert... and the FIRST one is wrong. Ouch. 
2016-10-26 14:25:00	benni	ardour3 everything was working fine until i exported my last mix and since then no signals seem to be reaching my master bus. Other sessions perform perfectly but this one doesn't. the jack and internal audio connection all seem to be fine. Some tracks will playback if I hit the solo button others wont. What did I do?
2016-10-26 14:25:45	Bitrunner	you used ardour3 ;)
2016-10-26 14:26:05	Bitrunner	using ardour5 might solve _many_ problems
2016-10-26 14:26:11	benni	well it was an upgrade ;)...i'm using linux os
2016-10-26 14:26:38	benni	not sure a stable version is available for linux mint lmde
2016-10-26 14:26:40	NoteOn	ardour5 is good?
2016-10-26 14:26:46	Bitrunner	better than 3
2016-10-26 14:27:11	benni	is 3 a lemon? i can go back to my older version which worked ok
2016-10-26 14:27:17	Bitrunner	benni: just try download from ardour.org, should work fine I think. But you will have to donate at least a �/$ ;)
2016-10-26 14:27:39	benni	oh ok..i'll give it a try
2016-10-26 14:28:08	Bitrunner	there are so much improvements that's really rewarding.
2016-10-26 14:28:16	benni	thx
2016-10-26 14:28:36	Bitrunner	and I was able to get 5.1 running on Debian Stale, so there should not be a really problem on mint
2016-10-26 14:29:02	Bitrunner	although it runs much more stable on my kubuntu up to now. But that were 32/64Bit Mixup Problems
2016-10-26 14:29:22	rgareus	debian/testing has 5.3 and probably 5.4 tomorrow (it's been in sid since a few days)
2016-10-26 14:30:06	Bitrunner	well, kubuntu seems to work well for now. Only some smaller jackd/pulseaudio/legacy_apps issues which were all solvable
2016-10-26 14:30:07	benni	maybe i'll try 5.3 from testing first
2016-10-26 14:30:36	rgareus	day after tomorrow (uploaded on 2016-10-24   + 5 days)
2016-10-26 14:31:19	rgareus	benni: or https://nightly.ardour.org/ or http://ardour.org/download  (which can be installed in parallel to distro builds)

2016-10-26 14:32:03	benni	port connections? where do I find those?
2016-10-26 14:32:25	rgareus	benni: at the bottom of every mixer strip.  for example
2016-10-26 14:32:45	benni	oh yes the mixer outputs all look good
2016-10-26 14:32:58	rgareus	it should say "master" on tracks usually
2016-10-26 14:33:03	Bitrunner	but I think it would be time to kick ass all that "Audio Layer" Crap and restart from scratch with cleanly distinct layers. Layer 0: Hardware, Layer 1: an universal Audio Crossbar with unlimited channels, Layer 3: Client Application and Crossbar Control surfaces ("Mixer View"). 
2016-10-26 14:33:26	rgareus	benni: does the master level-meter move?
2016-10-26 14:34:05	benni	no, the mixer outputs say they are connected to the master bus but the mixer level doesnt move
2016-10-26 14:34:38	Bitrunner	rgareus: well, on my actual Project with 16 INput Tracks and 6 Busses, none of the input Tracks are routed directly to Master ;)
2016-10-26 14:34:48	Bitrunner	only the busses
2016-10-26 14:35:04	rgareus	benni: another guess:   in the editor window,  does the "Feeedback" button blink (top right-ish) ?

2016-10-26 14:35:24	benni	outputs are routed to the master bus and some are routed to other effects busses
2016-10-26 14:35:54	benni	feedback button is off
2016-10-26 14:36:00	Bitrunner	rgareus: yep, and that's ok. Although for Many-Track-Projects I would suggest to use group busses for everything. 
2016-10-26 14:36:15	Bitrunner	makes Things _much_ easier
2016-10-26 14:36:56	benni	i have 3 busses, one for reverb, on for compression and one for a guitar effects bus
2016-10-26 14:37:39	rgareus	benni: assuming the tracks play  and the track's level meters show a signal.. I don't have an idea.
2016-10-26 14:37:45	rgareus	benni: can you make a screenshot of the mixer window  and upload it to someplace  http://imgur.com/ or https://snag.gy/ or ..   that may shed some light.

2016-10-26 14:46:41	Bitrunner	but some of the plugins had bad bugs in the past
2016-10-26 14:49:11	benni	yeah I ve narrowed it down to the calf reverb on bus 1
2016-10-26 14:49:53	benni	i'll try steve harris's plugins instead
2016-10-26 14:49:55	Bitrunner	hmm got never warm with that

2016-10-27 02:06:57	rghvdberg	oh .. any idea why the solo button keeps hanging ? It's only the outline that is green. Like I'm soloing some other track.

2016-10-27 02:35:27	rghvdberg	so I guess I want auto automation on automation
2016-10-27 02:35:36	rgareus	you could use OSC to set plugin parameters.  or a lua script
2016-10-27 02:35:44	rghvdberg	ooohhhhhhhhhhh
2016-10-27 02:36:18	rghvdberg	so lua randomize function or something ?

2016-10-27 10:16:58	rgareus	ryan5w4: launch ardour, wait for 10 mins :)
2016-10-27 10:17:48	rgareus	ardour will "mute" all channels and display a dialog:  give me 5 more mins..

2016-10-27 10:20:27	rgareus	so it's mostly annoying (re-start every 10mins) but not really crippled  (except you can't record more than 10 mins in one go)
2016-10-27 10:21:56	rgareus	and well, you can get a "full version" for $1 if you need to .. or compile your own,  or ask someone to share his binary.
2016-10-27 10:22:00	ryan5w4	Mhm. I'll probably actually buy the full version once I get a clue of what I'm doing, but the demo should do for now

2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[12:39:17] there's one for writing automation... I suppose I'll just whip up some example.  give me a minute [12:39:17]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	 *	rghvdberg [12:39:38] just found out I can change track order in Editor list .. duh [12:39:38]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rghvdberg	[12:46:42] gotta go pick up the kids [12:46:42]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rghvdberg	[12:46:54] i'll keep irc open [12:46:54]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[13:10:49] rghvdberg: http://paste.debian.net/890377/ [13:10:49]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[13:14:26] rghvdberg: there's    math.random ()   and    math.sin()   in lua in case you don't want a simple ramp/triange. [13:14:26]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[13:18:09] hmm now that I think of it,  as DSP script this can easily become an envelope follower.. [13:18:09]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[13:18:27] at control-rate (cycle granular), but still [13:18:27]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rghvdberg	[13:37:37] rgareus: this script can modulate any paramater of any plugin (when edited of course) ? [13:37:37]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[13:41:32] rghvdberg: yes [13:41:32]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[13:42:13] rghvdberg: also multiple plugins at the same time.        or you can make 2 or 10 scripts and load them all separately. [13:42:13]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[13:44:16] rghvdberg: you could also paramerize the script.  pass some parameters when adding the script.  e.g. https://github.com/Ardour/ardour/blob/master/scripts/_session_test.lua [13:44:16]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rghvdberg	[13:44:59] bookmarking this stuff for later study [13:44:59]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rghvdberg	[13:45:08] been reading a LUA book btw ;-) [13:45:08]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rghvdberg	[13:45:16] gotta teach now  [13:45:16]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[13:45:17] cool [13:45:17]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rghvdberg	[13:59:32] rgareus: question (I'm getting pushy now) [13:59:32]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	 *	rghvdberg [13:59:50] is looking for the correct words [13:59:50]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[14:01:14] rghvdberg: just ask... [14:01:14]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rghvdberg	[14:01:35] say I want a single automation lane that can modulate multiple params of different plugins [14:01:35]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rghvdberg	[14:01:41] but .. it gets worse [14:01:41]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rghvdberg	[14:02:05] the amount the automation of different for the plugins .. [14:02:05]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rghvdberg	[14:02:36] sorry [14:02:36]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rghvdberg	[14:03:18] the parameters of the synth are modulated for a different range [14:03:18]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rghvdberg	[14:03:57] plugin 1 only changes for 50%, but plugin 2 70% and plugin 3 100% and plugin 4 35% [14:03:57]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rghvdberg	[14:04:19] it's easy to imagine but hard to explain .. in english .. (or dutch) [14:04:19]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rghvdberg	[14:05:16] friend who does cool dubstep stuff asked this. he recently installed linux + ardour and stuff [14:05:16]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[14:18:37] rghvdberg: realistically you'll probably want to use ingen [14:18:37]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rghvdberg	[14:18:57] gotcha [14:18:57]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rghvdberg	[14:19:13] bookmarked ;-) [14:19:13]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[14:19:19] rghvdberg: you can read data from automation lanes ..  and multiply the ranges [14:19:19]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[14:19:30] but in that case a script is rather a kludge solution [14:19:30]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[14:20:11] or use a plugin that supports modulation by itself.  that's what dubsteppers do on other platforms [14:20:11]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	ryan5w4	[20:15:16] Hey, just downloading the demo version and had a quick question- when it says it'll go silent every 10 minutes, what's that mean?  [20:15:16]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[20:16:58] ryan5w4: launch ardour, wait for 10 mins :) [20:16:58]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[20:17:47] ardour will "mute" all channels and display a dialog:  give me 5 more mins..  [20:17:47]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	ryan5w4	[20:17:56] Ah, okay. Thanks! [20:17:56]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[20:18:00] ryan5w4: you can save, re-start and everything's fine again [20:18:00]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[20:20:27] so it's mostly annoying (re-start every 10mins) but not really crippled  (except you can't record more than 10 mins in one go) [20:20:27]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[20:21:56] and well, you can get a "full version" for $1 if you need to .. or compile your own,  or ask someone to share his binary. [20:21:56]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	ryan5w4	[20:22:00] Mhm. I'll probably actually buy the full version once I get a clue of what I'm doing, but the demo should do for now  [20:22:00]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[20:23:52] ryan5w4: if you need to get started.. there are a couple of tutorials around [20:23:52]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[20:24:06] e.g  http://libremusicproduction.com/tutorials/basic-mixing-ardour-3  (also still valid for Ardour5) [20:24:06]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	LAbot	[20:24:08] Title: Basic mixing in Ardour 3 | Libre Music Production (at libremusicproduction.com) [20:24:08]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[20:24:25] or  http://ardour.org/tutorial if you prefer text [20:24:25]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	ryan5w4	[20:24:37] Thanks! My plan was to just mess around a bit first, but I'll look at those when I get a chance. [20:24:37]
2016-10-27 17:07:24	rgareus	[20:25:03] have fun, then. [20:25:03]

2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[12:39:17] there's one for writing automation... I suppose I'll just whip up some example.  give me a minute [12:39:17]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	 *	rghvdberg [12:39:38] just found out I can change track order in Editor list .. duh [12:39:38]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rghvdberg	[12:46:42] gotta go pick up the kids [12:46:42]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rghvdberg	[12:46:54] i'll keep irc open [12:46:54]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[13:10:49] rghvdberg: http://paste.debian.net/890377/ [13:10:49]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[13:14:26] rghvdberg: there's    math.random ()   and    math.sin()   in lua in case you don't want a simple ramp/triange. [13:14:26]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[13:18:09] hmm now that I think of it,  as DSP script this can easily become an envelope follower.. [13:18:09]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[13:18:27] at control-rate (cycle granular), but still [13:18:27]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rghvdberg	[13:37:37] rgareus: this script can modulate any paramater of any plugin (when edited of course) ? [13:37:37]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[13:41:32] rghvdberg: yes [13:41:32]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[13:42:13] rghvdberg: also multiple plugins at the same time.        or you can make 2 or 10 scripts and load them all separately. [13:42:13]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[13:44:16] rghvdberg: you could also paramerize the script.  pass some parameters when adding the script.  e.g. https://github.com/Ardour/ardour/blob/master/scripts/_session_test.lua [13:44:16]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rghvdberg	[13:44:59] bookmarking this stuff for later study [13:44:59]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rghvdberg	[13:45:08] been reading a LUA book btw ;-) [13:45:08]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rghvdberg	[13:45:16] gotta teach now  [13:45:16]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[13:45:17] cool [13:45:17]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rghvdberg	[13:59:32] rgareus: question (I'm getting pushy now) [13:59:32]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	 *	rghvdberg [13:59:50] is looking for the correct words [13:59:50]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[14:01:14] rghvdberg: just ask... [14:01:14]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rghvdberg	[14:01:35] say I want a single automation lane that can modulate multiple params of different plugins [14:01:35]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rghvdberg	[14:01:41] but .. it gets worse [14:01:41]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rghvdberg	[14:02:05] the amount the automation of different for the plugins .. [14:02:05]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rghvdberg	[14:02:36] sorry [14:02:36]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rghvdberg	[14:03:18] the parameters of the synth are modulated for a different range [14:03:18]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rghvdberg	[14:03:57] plugin 1 only changes for 50%, but plugin 2 70% and plugin 3 100% and plugin 4 35% [14:03:57]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rghvdberg	[14:04:19] it's easy to imagine but hard to explain .. in english .. (or dutch) [14:04:19]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rghvdberg	[14:05:16] friend who does cool dubstep stuff asked this. he recently installed linux + ardour and stuff [14:05:16]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[14:18:37] rghvdberg: realistically you'll probably want to use ingen [14:18:37]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rghvdberg	[14:18:57] gotcha [14:18:57]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rghvdberg	[14:19:13] bookmarked ;-) [14:19:13]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[14:19:19] rghvdberg: you can read data from automation lanes ..  and multiply the ranges [14:19:19]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[14:19:30] but in that case a script is rather a kludge solution [14:19:30]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[14:20:11] or use a plugin that supports modulation by itself.  that's what dubsteppers do on other platforms [14:20:11]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	ryan5w4	[20:15:16] Hey, just downloading the demo version and had a quick question- when it says it'll go silent every 10 minutes, what's that mean?  [20:15:16]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[20:16:58] ryan5w4: launch ardour, wait for 10 mins :) [20:16:58]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[20:17:47] ardour will "mute" all channels and display a dialog:  give me 5 more mins..  [20:17:47]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	ryan5w4	[20:17:56] Ah, okay. Thanks! [20:17:56]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[20:18:00] ryan5w4: you can save, re-start and everything's fine again [20:18:00]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[20:20:27] so it's mostly annoying (re-start every 10mins) but not really crippled  (except you can't record more than 10 mins in one go) [20:20:27]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[20:21:56] and well, you can get a "full version" for $1 if you need to .. or compile your own,  or ask someone to share his binary. [20:21:56]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	ryan5w4	[20:22:00] Mhm. I'll probably actually buy the full version once I get a clue of what I'm doing, but the demo should do for now  [20:22:00]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[20:23:52] ryan5w4: if you need to get started.. there are a couple of tutorials around [20:23:52]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[20:24:06] e.g  http://libremusicproduction.com/tutorials/basic-mixing-ardour-3  (also still valid for Ardour5) [20:24:06]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	LAbot	[20:24:08] Title: Basic mixing in Ardour 3 | Libre Music Production (at libremusicproduction.com) [20:24:08]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[20:24:25] or  http://ardour.org/tutorial if you prefer text [20:24:25]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	ryan5w4	[20:24:37] Thanks! My plan was to just mess around a bit first, but I'll look at those when I get a chance. [20:24:37]
2016-10-27 22:29:48	rgareus	[20:25:03] have fun, then. [20:25:03]

2016-10-28 11:26:19	 *	rghvdberg [12:39:38] just found out I can change track order in Editor list .. duh [12:39:38]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rghvdberg	[12:46:42] gotta go pick up the kids [12:46:42]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rghvdberg	[12:46:54] i'll keep irc open [12:46:54]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rgareus	[13:10:49] rghvdberg: http://paste.debian.net/890377/ [13:10:49]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rgareus	[13:14:26] rghvdberg: there's    math.random ()   and    math.sin()   in lua in case you don't want a simple ramp/triange. [13:14:26]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rgareus	[13:18:09] hmm now that I think of it,  as DSP script this can easily become an envelope follower.. [13:18:09]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rgareus	[13:18:27] at control-rate (cycle granular), but still [13:18:27]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rghvdberg	[13:37:37] rgareus: this script can modulate any paramater of any plugin (when edited of course) ? [13:37:37]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rgareus	[13:41:32] rghvdberg: yes [13:41:32]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rgareus	[13:42:13] rghvdberg: also multiple plugins at the same time.        or you can make 2 or 10 scripts and load them all separately. [13:42:13]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rgareus	[13:44:16] rghvdberg: you could also paramerize the script.  pass some parameters when adding the script.  e.g. https://github.com/Ardour/ardour/blob/master/scripts/_session_test.lua [13:44:16]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rghvdberg	[13:44:59] bookmarking this stuff for later study [13:44:59]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rghvdberg	[13:45:08] been reading a LUA book btw ;-) [13:45:08]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rghvdberg	[13:45:16] gotta teach now  [13:45:16]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rgareus	[13:45:17] cool [13:45:17]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rghvdberg	[13:59:32] rgareus: question (I'm getting pushy now) [13:59:32]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	 *	rghvdberg [13:59:50] is looking for the correct words [13:59:50]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rgareus	[14:01:14] rghvdberg: just ask... [14:01:14]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rghvdberg	[14:01:35] say I want a single automation lane that can modulate multiple params of different plugins [14:01:35]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rghvdberg	[14:01:41] but .. it gets worse [14:01:41]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rghvdberg	[14:02:05] the amount the automation of different for the plugins .. [14:02:05]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rghvdberg	[14:02:36] sorry [14:02:36]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rghvdberg	[14:03:18] the parameters of the synth are modulated for a different range [14:03:18]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rghvdberg	[14:03:57] plugin 1 only changes for 50%, but plugin 2 70% and plugin 3 100% and plugin 4 35% [14:03:57]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rghvdberg	[14:04:19] it's easy to imagine but hard to explain .. in english .. (or dutch) [14:04:19]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rghvdberg	[14:05:16] friend who does cool dubstep stuff asked this. he recently installed linux + ardour and stuff [14:05:16]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rgareus	[14:18:37] rghvdberg: realistically you'll probably want to use ingen [14:18:37]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rghvdberg	[14:18:57] gotcha [14:18:57]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rghvdberg	[14:19:13] bookmarked ;-) [14:19:13]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rgareus	[14:19:19] rghvdberg: you can read data from automation lanes ..  and multiply the ranges [14:19:19]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rgareus	[14:19:30] but in that case a script is rather a kludge solution [14:19:30]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rgareus	[14:20:11] or use a plugin that supports modulation by itself.  that's what dubsteppers do on other platforms [14:20:11]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	ryan5w4	[20:15:16] Hey, just downloading the demo version and had a quick question- when it says it'll go silent every 10 minutes, what's that mean?  [20:15:16]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rgareus	[20:16:58] ryan5w4: launch ardour, wait for 10 mins :) [20:16:58]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rgareus	[20:17:47] ardour will "mute" all channels and display a dialog:  give me 5 more mins..  [20:17:47]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	ryan5w4	[20:17:56] Ah, okay. Thanks! [20:17:56]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rgareus	[20:18:00] ryan5w4: you can save, re-start and everything's fine again [20:18:00]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rgareus	[20:20:27] so it's mostly annoying (re-start every 10mins) but not really crippled  (except you can't record more than 10 mins in one go) [20:20:27]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rgareus	[20:21:56] and well, you can get a "full version" for $1 if you need to .. or compile your own,  or ask someone to share his binary. [20:21:56]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	ryan5w4	[20:22:00] Mhm. I'll probably actually buy the full version once I get a clue of what I'm doing, but the demo should do for now  [20:22:00]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rgareus	[20:23:52] ryan5w4: if you need to get started.. there are a couple of tutorials around [20:23:52]

2016-10-28 11:26:19	ryan5w4	[20:24:37] Thanks! My plan was to just mess around a bit first, but I'll look at those when I get a chance. [20:24:37]
2016-10-28 11:26:19	rgareus	[20:25:03] have fun, then. [20:25:03]

2016-10-28 11:26:19	rghvdberg	[11:07:10] rgareus: you mentioned using an OSC for modulating plug-in parameters. OSC as in oscillator, not Open Sound Control ? [11:07:10]

2016-10-28 12:28:12	 *	rghvdberg [12:39:38] just found out I can change track order in Editor list .. duh [12:39:38]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	rghvdberg	[12:46:42] gotta go pick up the kids [12:46:42]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	rghvdberg	[12:46:54] i'll keep irc open [12:46:54]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	rgareus	[13:10:49] rghvdberg: http://paste.debian.net/890377/ [13:10:49]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	rgareus	[13:14:26] rghvdberg: there's    math.random ()   and    math.sin()   in lua in case you don't want a simple ramp/triange. [13:14:26]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	rgareus	[13:18:09] hmm now that I think of it,  as DSP script this can easily become an envelope follower.. [13:18:09]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	rgareus	[13:18:27] at control-rate (cycle granular), but still [13:18:27]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	rghvdberg	[13:37:37] rgareus: this script can modulate any paramater of any plugin (when edited of course) ? [13:37:37]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	rgareus	[13:41:32] rghvdberg: yes [13:41:32]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	rgareus	[13:42:13] rghvdberg: also multiple plugins at the same time.        or you can make 2 or 10 scripts and load them all separately. [13:42:13]
2016-10-28 12:28:12	rgareus	[13:44:16] rghvdberg: you could also paramerize the script.  pass some parameters when adding the script.  e.g. https://github.com/Ardour/ardour/blob/master/scripts/_session_test.lua [13:44:16]

2016-10-28 16:25:18	OvenWerks	MaurizioB: I tried doing bundles today in OSC. I thought maybe by bundling I could send a bunch of OSC messages/commands in one network packet. That does not happen. It still sends the same number of packets but each of them has the word #bundle in front... So the messge gets rejected by android stuff.
2016-10-28 16:26:19	MaurizioB	OvenWerks: I'm not sure you can send a single packet of a "whole" bunch of messages
2016-10-28 16:26:57	MaurizioB	but, to be honest, I'm drinking my fourth beer, here, so... :)
2016-10-28 16:27:00	OvenWerks	MaurizioB: "OSC Bundles
2016-10-28 16:27:03	OvenWerks	An OSC Bundle consists of the OSC-string "#bundle" followed by an OSC Time Tag, followed by zero or more OSC Bundle Elements. The OSC-timetag is a 64-bit fixed point time tag whose semantics are described below. "

2016-10-28 16:27:26	LAbot	Title: The Open Sound Control 1.0 Specification | opensoundcontrol.org (at opensoundcontrol.org)
2016-10-28 16:27:40	MaurizioB	OvenWerks: that reminds me of zero-status midi events
2016-10-28 16:28:08	OvenWerks	MaurizioB: maybe if I put a bundle into a bundle...
2016-10-28 16:28:21	MaurizioB	OvenWerks: matrioska-style? :)
2016-10-28 16:29:03	OvenWerks	The api says I can add bundles to a bundle
2016-10-28 16:30:08	MaurizioB	OvenWerks: seriously, I'd gladly discuss with you about that, but... I'm in the middle of understanding a multi-nested for cycle... and, again, about that fourth beer :D
2016-10-28 16:30:17	MaurizioB	sorry, I really can't handle all that right now :D
2016-10-28 16:30:32	MaurizioB	don't blame me :)
2016-10-28 16:30:35	OvenWerks	Not a problem, just being frustrated here
2016-10-28 16:31:04	MaurizioB	OvenWerks: don't tell me, I'm frustrated with a stupid for cycle, life could be worst ;)
2016-10-28 16:33:25	OvenWerks	MaurizioB: anyway the end result is that I will pull the bundling stuff and work on something else.
2016-10-28 16:34:12	MaurizioB	the bundling idea seems fine, though, could ease the network traffic and processing
2016-10-28 16:35:00	OvenWerks	ya but wireshark shows the bundle proken into little packets anyway.
2016-10-28 16:35:53	MaurizioB	OvenWerks: isn't it that bundles are just a "shortcut" for sending multiple packets on a single instance?
2016-10-28 16:36:24	rgareus	bundles are  about timestamping and handling multiple messages atomically at a given time
2016-10-28 16:36:26	MaurizioB	I'm just speculating, I really don't know how *exactly* osc network packet exchange works
2016-10-28 16:37:22	MaurizioB	huh
2016-10-28 16:37:43	MaurizioB	rgareus: so, they are actually sent as single messages?
2016-10-28 16:38:31	rgareus	not neccesarily.
2016-10-28 16:38:31		[16:38]

2016-10-28 22:16:41	rgareus	[20:20:27] so it's mostly annoying (re-start every 10mins) but not really crippled  (except you can't record more than 10 mins in one go) [20:20:27]
2016-10-28 22:16:41	rgareus	[20:21:56] and well, you can get a "full version" for $1 if you need to .. or compile your own,  or ask someone to share his binary. [20:21:56]
2016-10-28 22:16:41	ryan5w4	[20:22:00] Mhm. I'll probably actually buy the full version once I get a clue of what I'm doing, but the demo should do for now  [20:22:00]

2016-10-28 22:16:41	rgareus	[02:39:48] since a OSC bundle is not a message [02:39:48]

2016-10-28 22:16:41	MaurizioB	[02:48:41] OvenWerks: ok, anyway, as I told you, I won't be able to work on ArdouVy in less than a week, so, nothing is told before that :) [02:48:41]

2016-10-28 22:29:31	rgareus	[20:18:00] ryan5w4: you can save, re-start and everything's fine again [20:18:00]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	rgareus	[20:20:27] so it's mostly annoying (re-start every 10mins) but not really crippled  (except you can't record more than 10 mins in one go) [20:20:27]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	rgareus	[20:21:56] and well, you can get a "full version" for $1 if you need to .. or compile your own,  or ask someone to share his binary. [20:21:56]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	ryan5w4	[20:22:00] Mhm. I'll probably actually buy the full version once I get a clue of what I'm doing, but the demo should do for now [20:22:00]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	rgareus	[20:23:52] ryan5w4: if you need to get started.. there are a couple of tutorials around [20:23:52]

2016-10-28 22:29:31	rghvdberg	[11:07:10] rgareus: you mentioned using an OSC for modulating plug-in parameters. OSC as in oscillator, not Open Sound Control ? [11:07:10]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	OvenWerks	[02:25:18] MaurizioB: I tried doing bundles today in OSC. I thought maybe by bundling I could send a bunch of OSC messages/commands in one network packet. That does not happen. It still sends the same number of packets but each of them has the word #bundle in front... So the messge gets rejected by android stuff. [02:25:18]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	MaurizioB	[02:26:19] OvenWerks: I'm not sure you can send a single packet of a "whole" bunch of messages [02:26:19]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	MaurizioB	[02:26:57] but, to be honest, I'm drinking my fourth beer, here, so... :) [02:26:57]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	OvenWerks	[02:27:00] MaurizioB: "OSC Bundles [02:27:00]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	OvenWerks	[02:27:03] An OSC Bundle consists of the OSC-string "#bundle" followed by an OSC Time Tag, followed by zero or more OSC Bundle Elements. The OSC-timetag is a 64-bit fixed point time tag whose semantics are described below. " [02:27:03]

2016-10-28 22:29:31	MaurizioB	[02:27:40] OvenWerks: that reminds me of zero-status midi events [02:27:40]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	OvenWerks	[02:28:08] MaurizioB: maybe if I put a bundle into a bundle... [02:28:08]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	MaurizioB	[02:28:21] OvenWerks: matrioska-style? :) [02:28:21]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	OvenWerks	[02:29:03] The api says I can add bundles to a bundle [02:29:03]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	MaurizioB	[02:30:08] OvenWerks: seriously, I'd gladly discuss with you about that, but... I'm in the middle of understanding a multi-nested for cycle... and, again, about that fourth beer :D [02:30:08]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	MaurizioB	[02:30:17] sorry, I really can't handle all that right now :D [02:30:17]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	MaurizioB	[02:30:32] don't blame me :) [02:30:32]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	OvenWerks	[02:30:35] Not a problem, just being frustrated here [02:30:35]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	MaurizioB	[02:31:04] OvenWerks: don't tell me, I'm frustrated with a stupid for cycle, life could be worst ;) [02:31:04]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	OvenWerks	[02:33:25] MaurizioB: anyway the end result is that I will pull the bundling stuff and work on something else. [02:33:25]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	MaurizioB	[02:34:12] the bundling idea seems fine, though, could ease the network traffic and processing [02:34:12]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	OvenWerks	[02:35:00] ya but wireshark shows the bundle proken into little packets anyway. [02:35:00]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	MaurizioB	[02:35:53] OvenWerks: isn't it that bundles are just a "shortcut" for sending multiple packets on a single instance? [02:35:53]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	rgareus	[02:36:24] bundles are  about timestamping and handling multiple messages atomically at a given time [02:36:24]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	MaurizioB	[02:36:26] I'm just speculating, I really don't know how *exactly* osc network packet exchange works [02:36:26]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	MaurizioB	[02:37:22] huh [02:37:22]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	MaurizioB	[02:37:43] rgareus: so, they are actually sent as single messages? [02:37:43]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	rgareus	[02:38:31] not neccesarily. [02:38:31]
2016-10-28 22:29:31	rgareus	[02:39:30] I take it you meant "TCP/UDP" message. [02:39:30]

2016-10-29 01:39:54	Sharma_	Hello! I'd like to know how to install plugins for ardour 4, im running linux Ubuntu 16.06
2016-10-29 01:40:30	rgareus	Sharma_: easiest is to get them from Ubuntu
2016-10-29 01:40:45	rgareus	Sharma_: search the distro-archive for  LV2  and LADSPA
2016-10-29 01:41:06	Sharma_	How do I do that?!
2016-10-29 01:41:50	rgareus	I think on Ubuntu the package manager is called synaptic  or "software center"   -- how you usually install additional software.
2016-10-29 01:41:51	Sharma_	Please help me out, Step by Step! That'd be great!
2016-10-29 01:42:14	 *	rgareus does not know Ubuntu, so I can't do step-by-step.
2016-10-29 01:42:26	Sharma_	okay, so at the software center I got to search for Lv2?!
2016-10-29 01:42:35	rgareus	I could drop a commandline..  if that's helpful :)
2016-10-29 01:42:54	Sharma_	Yeah the command line would be helpful!
2016-10-29 01:43:26	rgareus	to search      apt-cache search lv2 | grep plugin  
2016-10-29 01:44:07	Sharma_	That's it?>
2016-10-29 01:44:15	rgareus	and then      sudo apt-get install swh-lv2 x42-plugins zam-plugins eq10q  fomp  guitarix-lv2 invada-studio-plugins-lv2 mda-lv2
2016-10-29 01:44:30	rgareus	^^ to install (those are package names from debian)
2016-10-29 01:45:10	Sharma_	It says unable to locate package!
2016-10-29 01:45:18	Sharma_	Should I download any files?!
2016-10-29 01:45:25	rgareus	the list is likely longer       http://manual.ardour.org/working-with-plugins/getting-plugins/ 
2016-10-29 01:45:44	rgareus	Sharma_: which package can't it locate?
2016-10-29 01:46:09	rgareus	maybe not all of the ones I've listed are available Ubuntu.
2016-10-29 01:46:46	Sharma_	Oh! so how do I know if the plugins are installed?!
2016-10-29 01:46:48	melanie__	ubuntu multimedia sources enabled?

2016-10-29 01:47:03	Sharma_	No idea, how do i do that?
2016-10-29 01:47:33	melanie__	mom
2016-10-29 01:48:26	rgareus	Sharma_: to check:  start  ardour.   create or load a session. ;    Menu  > Session > Add Track or Bus.  ;  Menu > Window > Mixer.    In the mixer window double click in the "Processor Box" (the blank black space near the top of every track)  ->  Processor/Plugin Manager shows up and lists all plugins
2016-10-29 01:49:34	rgareus	http://manual.ardour.org/ardour/manual/html/diagrams/mixer-summary.png   
2016-10-29 01:50:12	Sharma_	Found it!
2016-10-29 01:51:38	rgareus	Sharma_: after installing more plugins, you usually need to restart ardour to pick them up
2016-10-29 01:52:15	melanie__	should be this ppa i think https://launchpad.net/~kxstudio-debian/+archive/ubuntu/plugins

2016-10-29 01:52:56	Sharma_	Okay! thanks a lot fellas! and I'm new to ardour.. So do you guys know what to use for noise removal?!
2016-10-29 01:53:16	rgareus	Sharma_: there are no good noise removers.
2016-10-29 01:53:48	rgareus	at least no free ones
2016-10-29 01:55:15	melanie__	hm don`t know i prevent it beforehand with mic placement and walls aroung the mic
2016-10-29 01:55:15		[01:55]

2016-10-29 12:25:05	rgareus	[11:44:30] ^^ to install (those are package names from debian) [11:44:30]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	Sharma_	[11:45:10] It says unable to locate package! [11:45:10]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	Sharma_	[11:45:18] Should I download any files?! [11:45:18]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	rgareus	[11:45:25] the list is likely longer       http://manual.ardour.org/working-with-plugins/getting-plugins/  [11:45:25]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	rgareus	[11:45:44] Sharma_: which package can't it locate? [11:45:44]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	rgareus	[11:46:09] maybe not all of the ones I've listed are available Ubuntu. [11:46:09]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	Sharma_	[11:46:46] Oh! so how do I know if the plugins are installed?! [11:46:46]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	melanie__	[11:46:48] ubuntu multimedia sources enabled? [11:46:48]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	Sharma_	[11:47:03] No idea, how do i do that? [11:47:03]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	melanie__	[11:47:33] mom [11:47:33]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	rgareus	[11:48:26] Sharma_: to check:  start  ardour.   create or load a session. ;    Menu  > Session > Add Track or Bus.  ;  Menu > Window > Mixer.    In the mixer window double click in the "Processor Box" (the blank black space near the top of every track)  ->  Processor/Plugin Manager shows up and lists all plugins [11:48:26]

2016-10-29 12:25:05	Sharma_	[11:50:12] Found it! [11:50:12]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	rgareus	[11:51:38] Sharma_: after installing more plugins, you usually need to restart ardour to pick them up [11:51:38]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	melanie__	[11:52:15] should be this ppa i think https://launchpad.net/~kxstudio-debian/+archive/ubuntu/plugins [11:52:15]

2016-10-29 12:25:05	Sharma_	[11:52:56] Okay! thanks a lot fellas! and I'm new to ardour.. So do you guys know what to use for noise removal?! [11:52:56]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	rgareus	[11:53:16] Sharma_: there are no good noise removers. [11:53:16]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	rgareus	[11:53:48] at least no free ones [11:53:48]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	melanie__	[11:55:15] hm don`t know i prevent it beforehand with mic placement and walls aroung the mic [11:55:15]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	rgareus	[11:57:32] luciano is working on one https://github.com/lucianodato/noise-repellent [11:57:32]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	Sharma_	[11:58:44] Great! Thanks a lot for your time everyone!! Cheers. [11:58:44]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	rgareus	[11:59:48] Sharma_: you're welcome [11:59:48]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	the_CLA	[12:30:46] Uh, need to test that on better speakers later. But on my laptop's speakers it sounded quite promising already. :) [12:30:46]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	the_CLA	[12:52:59] Uh, causing NANs on reloading the session. [12:52:59]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	the_CLA	[13:01:31] Hm, on second and third try that didn't happen, but it obviously doesn't yet save the noise profile. [13:01:31]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	dynamicsamurai	[14:21:52] rgareus: when ardour is built on the build servers, are all the dependencies built from scratch each time? [14:21:52]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	rgareus	[14:26:17] dynamicsamurai: not any more. they're cached [14:26:17]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	rgareus	[14:26:57] these days the build-stack is only rebuilt when when the dependencies change. [14:26:57]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	dynamicsamurai	[14:29:24] rgareus: is there a script for that? I've been playing with the new "Windows Subsystem for Linux" lately. Could be a better environment than MSYS2 for anyone who wants to dev on Windows. [14:29:24]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	rgareus	[14:32:12] dynamicsamurai: https://github.com/Ardour/ardour/pull/278 [14:32:12]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	dynamicsamurai	[14:38:07] rgareus: cool, I'll chime in on that thread. [14:38:07]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	Nova_deViator	[19:34:05] is the paying system for Ardour been fixed? [19:34:05]

2016-10-29 12:25:05	rghvdberg	[21:24:28] check alsamixer [21:24:28]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	rghvdberg	[21:25:26] well .. gotta go now (zzzz) [21:25:26]
2016-10-29 12:25:05	rghvdberg	[21:25:43] hope you can figure it out [21:25:43]

2016-10-29 13:13:00	tom-	OvenWerks: re packet length, bundles etc. the reason you see many packets in wireshark that are effectively from one message is called "ip fragmentation"
2016-10-29 13:13:22	tom-	OvenWerks: you must not care about that. the osc library will see the reassembled packet
2016-10-29 13:13:44	tom-	OvenWerks: the limit that counts is around 64k
2016-10-29 13:14:35	tom-	OvenWerks: you could set a larger MTU in your LAN and see how that affects the fragmentation

2016-10-29 13:22:19	tom-	there is ambiguity. a packet in osc lingo is either a message or a bundle. a bundle can hold messages and bundles. a packet in network lingo is something totally different.
2016-10-29 13:28:00		[13:22]
2016-10-29 13:28:55	OvenWerks	tom-: it was a programming mistake on my part. some extra code I forgat to delete after a copy and paste...  :P
2016-10-29 13:29:45	OvenWerks	tom-: in the end it doesn't matter because it seems a lot of surfaces do not understand bundles anyway.
2016-10-29 13:30:01	tom-	that's true
2016-10-29 13:30:46	OvenWerks	tom-: there is only one time it really matters and that is on a total refresh. I solved it by adding a 10us delay in there.
2016-10-29 13:31:07	tom-	if just the osc "face" of ardour would be more flexible. it could cather *any* surface and must not align to the dumbest
2016-10-29 13:31:50	tom-	hm. could i send a bundle from a session hook?
2016-10-29 13:32:06	OvenWerks	tom-: just at a refresh I add the delay between each channel. I could easily add that as another setting.
2016-10-29 13:32:07	tom-	iirc sending bundles isn't possible at the moment
2016-10-29 13:33:16	tom-	OvenWerks: that seems the alternative. send a message for everything
2016-10-29 13:33:21	OvenWerks	I am not sure what you mean exactly. I was able to send a bundle.
2016-10-29 13:33:23	tom-	OvenWerks: why a delay in-between?
2016-10-29 13:33:42	tom-	OvenWerks: from lua. i can't tell by heart if it can send bundles
2016-10-29 13:34:04	OvenWerks	some of the surfaces have a small buffer and adding a small delay lets it keep up. It is not noticable.
2016-10-29 13:34:33	OvenWerks	if you can access the liblo api, then yes.
2016-10-29 13:35:21	OvenWerks	I am not sure if liblo breaks bundles down automatically or the code has to detect the bundle and do that
2016-10-29 13:36:17	OvenWerks	There is an api call to tell the api where the bundle handling fuction is though. I just don't if there is a default.
2016-10-29 13:36:54	tom-	there is a default i suppose
2016-10-29 13:37:08	tom-	from a receivers point of view, messages from inside a bundle look like normal. the bundle just acts as a grouping help and has a timestamp
2016-10-29 13:37:39	OvenWerks	tom-: the surface refresh is very data heavy, 14 or 15 per channel. for 8 channels it is ok bug by the time I hit 20, I was starting to loose stuff.
2016-10-29 13:38:23	OvenWerks	from the receivers POV a bundle looks like a OSC message with the path #bundle and a blob.
2016-10-29 13:38:25	tom-	the question is where it got lost
2016-10-29 13:39:12	OvenWerks	tom with phones/tablets it is either internal buffer or wifi.
2016-10-29 13:39:14	tom-	yes, but after that bundle was disassembled (normally done automatically by library), you get the all the messages like they would have been sent not in a bundle
2016-10-29 13:40:08	OvenWerks	I am running two surfaces on the same machine through localhost right now with no problems. I have one for master/buses and the other just for a bunch of channels.
2016-10-29 13:40:28	tom-	OvenWerks: a wifi client with a small buffer can do different things than a second computer connected via gbit ethernet
2016-10-29 13:40:30	OvenWerks	I don't loose messages at all.
2016-10-29 13:41:19	tom-	it would be bizare to loose messages on localhost indeed :)
2016-10-29 13:41:35	OvenWerks	Ardour can do tcp which would make sure things made it, but the android stuff does have that setting.
2016-10-29 13:41:52	OvenWerks	A wired surface could do that though.
2016-10-29 13:42:02	tom-	using tcp would open another chapter of issues
2016-10-29 13:42:36	OvenWerks	depends on the use.
2016-10-29 13:42:47	OvenWerks	real time would suffer
2016-10-29 13:43:12	OvenWerks	surfaces are not really real time
2016-10-29 13:43:12		[13:43]
2016-10-29 13:43:45	OvenWerks	There are control applications where real time is more import though

2016-10-29 18:39:18	OvenWerks	[01:02:33] the OSC pages started out as a one page deal. When broken into more pages it really needs to be rethought out. The first page is not the place for a long list of commands. [01:02:33]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:02:36] for asciidoc, it's quite simple [01:02:36]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	OvenWerks	[01:02:47] I don't know what it would take to pdf this. [01:02:47]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:03:44] markdown is similar, maybe it could just be appended and with some reformatting have a starting point (minus specialities) [01:03:44]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:04:10] if the tools in use can deliver docbook, that could work too [01:04:10]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:04:52] the manual can be looked at as a book with chapters. that's what docbook handles well with chains toward tex and nice output [01:04:52]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	OvenWerks	[01:05:25] The thing is it ends up groups of directories that are designed to reside in a top directory. the paths sre not relative, but hard. [01:05:25]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:05:40] yes, it seems a bit static [01:05:40]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:06:19] changing filenames in a repo is also questionable [01:06:19]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	OvenWerks	[01:06:39] static really makes sense for this. but relative links would make it a download and use chunk. [01:06:39]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:06:55] the place where the text chunks are stored shouldn't be relevant for the order of the book chapters [01:06:55]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:07:38] i see how it can be useful as a shortcut but soon enough it will be hard to manage unless the initial layout was so good that in will only grow and never change otherwise [01:07:38]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	OvenWerks	[01:08:37] not my choice... mind if I didn't feel some guilt I wouldn't do docs at all :) [01:08:37]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:09:23] it was a good step at the time to move to a versioned repository [01:09:23]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	OvenWerks	[01:10:11] I end up having to do forced updates quite a bit with this. The code is much easier. [01:10:11]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	rgareus	[01:15:52] tom-: no, there is no way to disable all scripts [01:15:52]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	OvenWerks	[01:16:17] going through all the noise? [01:16:17]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	rgareus	[01:16:28] tom-: and also you can't get an accurate timestap in a lua script, so OSC bundles are somewhat moot [01:16:28]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:17:18] rgareus: for the scripts, would it be hard to have a startup-option to disable all script exec? [01:17:18]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:18:58] rgareus: for the bundles, thats true for cases where timestamp matters (which it often does where bundles are used). bundles can also just be "baskets" and clever libraries can also derive structural information [01:18:58]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:19:48] rgareus: i haven't used any bundles for years. i start to think they can be useful beyond timing [01:19:48]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	rgareus	[01:20:33] tom-: what's the  advantage of using bundles when you do *not* need atomicity? [01:20:33]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:20:51] there is also a datatype for timestamps so these are not limited to bundles. it might be that bundles are processed differently (using the timestamp), sort of a library-provided queue to schedule delivery [01:20:51]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:22:00] rgareus: atomicity is provided without the timestamp iiuc [01:22:00]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:22:17] rgareus: "bundle" tells me the contents belong together [01:22:17]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:23:18] even though the receiving end won't necessarily care about whether or not a message was single or part of a bundle [01:23:18]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:23:49] rgareus: so your point is legitimate [01:23:49]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	rgareus	[01:26:25] clock says, 2:30, it's supposed to be 3:30 and it feels like 5:30.. bedime [01:26:25]

2016-10-29 18:39:18	rgareus	[01:29:05] tom-: I'm not opposed to add support for sending OSC bundles from lua,  I just think it's a lot more trouble than it's worth. [01:29:05]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:32:45] rgareus: that could well be the case [01:32:45]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:33:02] rgareus: can i get a last word from you? on " /hook <signal to listen to> <code to execute>" [01:33:02]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:33:52] rgareus: allowing to set osc hooks dynamically (via osc) [01:33:52]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	rgareus	[01:38:15] tom-: sounds reasonable [01:38:15]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:38:32] :) [01:38:32]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:38:52] a good occasion to join the sleep [01:38:52]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	rgareus	[01:39:33] "<code to execute>" needs to be a function or a function factory (session reload) [01:39:33]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	rgareus	[01:40:09] tough maybe that can be wrapped automatically. [01:40:09]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:40:11] plain text [01:40:11]
2016-10-29 18:39:18	tom-	[01:40:19] (too) [01:40:19]

2016-10-29 23:10:12	OvenWerks	[01:02:33] the OSC pages started out as a one page deal. When broken into more pages it really needs to be rethought out. The first page is not the place for a long list of commands. [01:02:33]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:02:36] for asciidoc, it's quite simple [01:02:36]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	OvenWerks	[01:02:47] I don't know what it would take to pdf this. [01:02:47]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:03:44] markdown is similar, maybe it could just be appended and with some reformatting have a starting point (minus specialities) [01:03:44]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:04:10] if the tools in use can deliver docbook, that could work too [01:04:10]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:04:52] the manual can be looked at as a book with chapters. that's what docbook handles well with chains toward tex and nice output [01:04:52]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	OvenWerks	[01:05:25] The thing is it ends up groups of directories that are designed to reside in a top directory. the paths sre not relative, but hard. [01:05:25]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:05:40] yes, it seems a bit static [01:05:40]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:06:19] changing filenames in a repo is also questionable [01:06:19]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	OvenWerks	[01:06:39] static really makes sense for this. but relative links would make it a download and use chunk. [01:06:39]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:06:55] the place where the text chunks are stored shouldn't be relevant for the order of the book chapters [01:06:55]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:07:38] i see how it can be useful as a shortcut but soon enough it will be hard to manage unless the initial layout was so good that in will only grow and never change otherwise [01:07:38]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	OvenWerks	[01:08:37] not my choice... mind if I didn't feel some guilt I wouldn't do docs at all :) [01:08:37]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:09:23] it was a good step at the time to move to a versioned repository [01:09:23]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	OvenWerks	[01:10:11] I end up having to do forced updates quite a bit with this. The code is much easier. [01:10:11]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	rgareus	[01:15:52] tom-: no, there is no way to disable all scripts [01:15:52]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	OvenWerks	[01:16:17] going through all the noise? [01:16:17]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	rgareus	[01:16:28] tom-: and also you can't get an accurate timestap in a lua script, so OSC bundles are somewhat moot [01:16:28]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:17:18] rgareus: for the scripts, would it be hard to have a startup-option to disable all script exec? [01:17:18]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:18:58] rgareus: for the bundles, thats true for cases where timestamp matters (which it often does where bundles are used). bundles can also just be "baskets" and clever libraries can also derive structural information [01:18:58]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:19:48] rgareus: i haven't used any bundles for years. i start to think they can be useful beyond timing [01:19:48]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	rgareus	[01:20:33] tom-: what's the  advantage of using bundles when you do *not* need atomicity? [01:20:33]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:20:51] there is also a datatype for timestamps so these are not limited to bundles. it might be that bundles are processed differently (using the timestamp), sort of a library-provided queue to schedule delivery [01:20:51]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:22:00] rgareus: atomicity is provided without the timestamp iiuc [01:22:00]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:22:17] rgareus: "bundle" tells me the contents belong together [01:22:17]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:23:18] even though the receiving end won't necessarily care about whether or not a message was single or part of a bundle [01:23:18]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:23:49] rgareus: so your point is legitimate [01:23:49]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	rgareus	[01:26:25] clock says, 2:30, it's supposed to be 3:30 and it feels like 5:30.. bedime [01:26:25]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	damo22	[01:26:58] nite [01:26:58]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:27:45] " [01:27:45]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	rgareus	[01:29:05] tom-: I'm not opposed to add support for sending OSC bundles from lua,  I just think it's a lot more trouble than it's worth. [01:29:05]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:32:45] rgareus: that could well be the case [01:32:45]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:33:02] rgareus: can i get a last word from you? on " /hook <signal to listen to> <code to execute>" [01:33:02]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:33:52] rgareus: allowing to set osc hooks dynamically (via osc) [01:33:52]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	rgareus	[01:38:15] tom-: sounds reasonable [01:38:15]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:38:32] :) [01:38:32]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:38:52] a good occasion to join the sleep [01:38:52]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	rgareus	[01:39:33] "<code to execute>" needs to be a function or a function factory (session reload) [01:39:33]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	rgareus	[01:40:09] tough maybe that can be wrapped automatically. [01:40:09]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:40:11] plain text [01:40:11]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:40:19] (too) [01:40:19]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:40:46] function is fine for a start [01:40:46]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:40:52] i think [01:40:52]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	tom-	[01:40:57] good night [01:40:57]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	rgareus	[01:40:59] yes plain *script* text [01:40:59]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	rgareus	[01:41:01] anyway [01:41:01]
2016-10-29 23:10:12	rgareus	[01:41:04] 'night [01:41:04]

2016-10-30 02:49:14	dynamicsamurai	where does Ardour search for LV2 plugins on Windows?

2016-10-30 02:51:48	rgareus	dynamicsamurai: it's liblilv (not ardour) which indices LV2s  (though ardour explicily also scans plugins bundled with ardour)
2016-10-30 02:52:06	rgareus	s/indices/indexes/
2016-10-30 02:57:40	dynamicsamurai	I managed to cross-compile my DPF plugins using the Windows Subsystem for Linux last night
2016-10-30 02:57:48	dynamicsamurai	Some reason the VST ones aren't working
2016-10-30 02:59:44	rgareus	why am I not surprised
2016-10-30 02:59:44		[02:59]
2016-10-30 03:00:07	dynamicsamurai	Just managed to get it to recognise the LV2 ones, but on trying to load them there appears to be some dll hell
2016-10-30 03:00:24	 *	dynamicsamurai remembers why he uses linux for this stuff
2016-10-30 03:00:53	dynamicsamurai	will have to try compiling with static glibc etc
2016-10-30 03:01:32	rgareus	"Windows Subsystem for Linux" that's inverse "wine" right?
2016-10-30 03:02:04	rgareus	ie run linux binaries on windows
2016-10-30 03:02:11	dynamicsamurai	yeah
2016-10-30 03:02:19	dynamicsamurai	they wrote an ELF loader and a kernel shim
2016-10-30 03:02:38	dynamicsamurai	you download a real ubuntu 14.04 installation
2016-10-30 03:03:13	rgareus	at least no reverse-engineering or patent infringment  is needed for that :)  
2016-10-30 03:03:55	dynamicsamurai	yeah, it's also a good illustration of the "New Microsoft"
2016-10-30 03:04:03	tumocs	is it possible to automate plugin bypass on track, I can't find it from anywhere?
2016-10-30 03:04:05	rgareus	still I can imagine a gazillion of ways to screw this up. 
2016-10-30 03:04:15	rgareus	tumocs: no it's not possible.
2016-10-30 03:04:39	rgareus	tumocs: only plugis that have internal bypass can be automated
2016-10-30 03:05:06	rgareus	ardour has no idea how to click-free bypass <some random plugin>, so it won't even try.
2016-10-30 03:05:34	tumocs	right, thanks rgareus. I'll continue working my way around it in that case
2016-10-30 03:08:17	rgareus	tumocs: most professional plugins do provide a "bypass/enable" input (which can be automated).
2016-10-30 03:10:01	rghvdberg	rgareus: tried your script (modulate.lua)
2016-10-30 03:10:22	rgareus	at least nearly all VSTs and AUs that I've used for testing have one.  Also a-plugins (come with Ardour 5.x) hav a port and also tell Ardour about it (so ardour maps it to the bypass button)
2016-10-30 03:10:31	rgareus	rghvdberg: and?
2016-10-30 03:10:34	rghvdberg	does work, but the range of the parameter is between 0 and 1 .. 
2016-10-30 03:10:54	rghvdberg	dunno how to edit the script 
2016-10-30 03:11:44	rgareus	rghvdberg: any text editor will do.  
2016-10-30 03:11:53	rghvdberg	not what I mean .. ;-)
2016-10-30 03:11:55	rgareus	rghvdberg: you need to remove and re-add the script after that
2016-10-30 03:12:06	rghvdberg	refresh doesn't work ?
2016-10-30 03:12:20	rgareus	rghvdberg: line 45              ARDOUR.LuaAPI.set_processor_param (plugin, 0, tri / 100)
2016-10-30 03:12:48	rgareus	"tri" is a "triangle"  counting 0..100..0  (line 30,31)
2016-10-30 03:13:36	rghvdberg	the scripts is always 'on' isn't it ?
2016-10-30 03:13:39	rgareus	rghvdberg: "refresh"  updates the list of available/installed scripts.
2016-10-30 03:13:53	rghvdberg	aha .. not the script itself
2016-10-30 03:13:55	rghvdberg	gotcha
2016-10-30 03:14:10	rgareus	rghvdberg: andyes, the script is "always on".
2016-10-30 03:14:29	rghvdberg	I'm picky .. aren't I ?
2016-10-30 03:14:50	rgareus	rghvdberg: well, you can change that :)  depending on transport or ...
2016-10-30 03:14:50		[03:14]
2016-10-30 03:15:14	rgareus	rghvdberg: but really it's probably not a good solution for dubstep modulation.
2016-10-30 03:15:44	rgareus	rghvdberg: I suppose you do actually want a modular  with a few side-chains.
2016-10-30 03:15:47	rghvdberg	can these script be converted to a plugin ? I noticed that some plugins are lua-plugins 
2016-10-30 03:16:00	rghvdberg	I need it to make ultra wide pads
2016-10-30 03:16:20	rghvdberg	synth patch, duplicate track (share playlist)
2016-10-30 03:16:27	rghvdberg	hard pan both tracks
2016-10-30 03:16:36	rgareus	rghvdberg: yes and no..  a plugin will be "local" to the channel it runs on.
2016-10-30 03:16:44	tumocs	rgareus: yeah some seem to have, I've for now just used mostly free software plugins and at least calf doesn't seem to have none. I'll have to find bunch of new plugins in that case.
2016-10-30 03:16:48	rgareus	rghvdberg: so it could only modulate plugins that come after it.
2016-10-30 03:17:20	rghvdberg	slightly alter a synth param to increase stereo perception
2016-10-30 03:17:33	rghvdberg	that is my master plan .. and I will dominate the world
2016-10-30 03:19:07	rgareus	rghvdberg: synth param ?!   can't you use MIDI-CC to set/change it?
2016-10-30 03:19:42	rghvdberg	don't think it can bind midi CC / midi learn
2016-10-30 03:19:53	rghvdberg	but thinking isn't enough .. need to check that
2016-10-30 03:20:32	rghvdberg	but then I still need to 'auto-modulate' the midi cc ..
2016-10-30 03:22:17	rgareus	rghvdberg: injecting some CC or randomizing CC might be easier.
2016-10-30 03:22:30	rgareus	rghvdberg: I thought it's a synth that already responds to CCs
2016-10-30 03:22:57	rgareus	but if it's not..   I think the best way is to use a modular env (like ingen)
2016-10-30 03:23:47	rgareus	I suppose there are many ways to get the job done.   but  using a modular-env to build a modulated synth  like a good idea :)

2016-10-30 03:26:45	rghvdberg	it's not a big problem
2016-10-30 03:26:58	rgareus	ok. so ingen is out.
2016-10-30 03:26:59	rghvdberg	I can always draw them 
2016-10-30 03:27:13	rghvdberg	carla can load the plugin and assign cc to them
2016-10-30 03:27:59	rghvdberg	but I've had some stability problems with carla
2016-10-30 03:28:23	rghvdberg	oh .. I was cursing and blaming Ardour for crashing .. raised my audio buffer .. no more crashes ..
2016-10-30 03:28:55	rghvdberg	I didn't publicly curse and blame btw that would be 'not done'
2016-10-30 03:29:01	rghvdberg	cause ardour is great
2016-10-30 03:30:33	rgareus	...and now I see a missing midi-filter   "randomize CC value"    (theres  CCtoNote, randomize velocity, NotetoCC  -- not great)

2016-10-30 07:48:42	magnetophon	I have a huge session that loads fine in A4 but reports feedback in A5. how do I find the issue?
2016-10-30 07:49:48	rgareus	magnetophon: possibly a send/return
2016-10-30 07:50:02	rgareus	magnetophon: launch ardour from the commandline, check stdout
2016-10-30 07:50:42	rgareus	A4 had some bugs - it didn't properly detect send/return feedback
2016-10-30 07:51:00	tumocs	another question for today: is it possible to play and hear stuff without recording while you are listening?
2016-10-30 07:51:39	rgareus	tumocs: yes,  though not on the same track.
2016-10-30 07:51:39		[07:51]
2016-10-30 07:51:57	rgareus	tumocs: in the mixer-window  you'll find  monitor "In", "Disk"   buttons on every channelstrip
2016-10-30 07:52:17	tumocs	right
2016-10-30 07:52:40	tumocs	completely missed that
2016-10-30 07:52:45	rgareus	by default ardour is in "auto-input" mode.  it switches to "disk" when playing .   but you can manually override
2016-10-30 07:53:01	tumocs	that helps a bit, now if it would be also possible in same track, I'd be in heaven :P
2016-10-30 07:53:08	tumocs	but I can always duplicate track for that
2016-10-30 07:53:15	rgareus	or use a bus
2016-10-30 07:53:36	rgareus	the complete story is   https://github.com/Ardour/ardour/raw/master/doc/monitor_modes.pdf
2016-10-30 07:57:51	tumocs	thanks, ardour makes it a bit hard to like itself but I must have developed a stockholm syndrome at this point...
2016-10-30 07:58:08	magnetophon	rgareus: thanks, but I don't see anything feedback related in https://gist.github.com/magnetophon/5062226752cdd026ad0e461d20921fb9

2016-10-30 08:00:48	rgareus	magnetophon: it's probably just one..  from master or monitor  out   to some input .  that eventually entails the whole session (due to reverbs)
2016-10-30 08:02:58	magnetophon	rgareus: the input of the monitor is only connected to the outs of some tracks (which are not connected to anything else), and to the out of master. the output of monitor is going just to 1/2
2016-10-30 08:03:44	magnetophon	or do you mean monitor just as an example? as in it could be any combo of those FROM and TO lines?
2016-10-30 08:04:16	rgareus	magnetophon: it could be any of those

2016-10-30 08:09:45	magnetophon	rgareus: sure but that one doesn't go back to master, just to monitor
2016-10-30 08:10:12	rgareus	indeed
2016-10-30 08:12:10	rgareus	excuse me being frank, but this is a mess of connections :)
2016-10-30 08:12:36	rgareus	hard to read indeed
2016-10-30 08:14:00	magnetophon	rgareus: it's a mess of connections, but it was needed to make http://magnetophon.nl/sounds/MananaMeChanto/Arriba2016/export/Arriba2016_r39.wav     (which I would also like to get feedback on)   ;)
2016-10-30 08:14:44	rgareus	magnetophon: do you use aux-sends ?  seeing as this was the main difference,  A4 -> A5. that's likely the cause
2016-10-30 08:15:10	magnetophon	rgareus: yup, looots of aux sends
2016-10-30 08:15:24	rgareus	and those don't show up in jack_lsp 
2016-10-30 08:16:25	rgareus	e.g. a  bus  feeding a track which has an aux back to the bus.

2016-10-30 08:20:07	magnetophon	rgareus: that's great news!  I had just typed a small plead for that, and then deleted it again, so as to not confuse the issue at hand.
2016-10-30 08:21:39	 *	rgareus listens to the mix while cooking
2016-10-30 08:21:56	magnetophon	so to conclude: the only way to find out is to manually trace each and every connection, starting with the auxes, as those changed most in A5.  is that right?
2016-10-30 08:22:36	 *	magnetophon is curious what rgareus thinks of said mix!
2016-10-30 08:22:36		[08:22]
2016-10-30 08:22:38	rgareus	magnetophon: yes, I suppose so.   or break a few connections  randomly
2016-10-30 08:24:06	magnetophon	rgareus: sorry, gotta go, forgot a meeting!  lemme know what you think of the mix anyway. for when I come back!
2016-10-30 08:24:23	rgareus	magnetophon: very well done
2016-10-30 08:24:44	rgareus	the song and performance is also great.

2016-10-30 13:10:06	rgareus	the_CLA: latest version of ardour + avldrums?
2016-10-30 13:10:16	the_CLA	rgareus: Yes.
2016-10-30 13:10:26	rgareus	the_CLA: I did change the API of the LV2 extension earlier today,..
2016-10-30 13:11:39	rgareus	the_CLA: hmm.  I can't reproduce it.
2016-10-30 13:11:47	the_CLA	rgareus: Seems it can't find the soundfont.
2016-10-30 13:12:32	rgareus	aah if the plugin instantiation failed.. yes that would explain the issue
2016-10-30 13:12:39	the_CLA	When trying to add manually to a midi track...
2016-10-30 13:12:42	the_CLA	[ERROR]: avldrums.lv2: Cannot find drumkit soundfont: '/home/axel/local/installs/lib/lv2/avldrums.lv2//Red_Zeppelin_4-1.1.sf2'

2016-10-30 13:13:21	the_CLA	rgareus: Seems that "make install" misses to install the soundfonts.
2016-10-30 13:13:22	rgareus	good call.  we don't catch failed instantiation when creating a track + adding the plugin
2016-10-30 13:13:35	rgareus	the_CLA: correct
2016-10-30 13:15:17	rgareus	the_CLA: reproduced it (after deleting the .sf2)

2016-10-30 13:21:53	lost_boy	New user here. I really don't know where's my processor box. Can someone just tell me how to find it?
2016-10-30 13:22:12	OvenWerks	lost_boy: do you have the mixer window open?
2016-10-30 13:22:48	OvenWerks	or the mixer strip enabled in the editor window
2016-10-30 13:23:09	lost_boy	@OvenWerks ok, now I see it. Is there any way to clip it?
2016-10-30 13:23:26	OvenWerks	Not sure what you mean by clip it
2016-10-30 13:23:50	lost_boy	Sorry. I mean just to stop making it float
2016-10-30 13:24:34	lost_boy	I want to lock it!

2016-10-30 13:25:32	OvenWerks	which version of Ardour do you have?
2016-10-30 13:25:57	lost_boy	Ok, let me explain it better: the mixer window is floating in a different window, I want it to be in the same window as the main interface... Does that make sense? 
2016-10-30 13:26:22	OvenWerks	do you have Ardour 5? or 4
2016-10-30 13:26:23	lost_boy	I have ardour 2.8.16... That seems old....

2016-10-30 13:27:16	the_CLA	Panning on the Red Zeppelin is really weird...
2016-10-30 13:27:28	OvenWerks	which OS or distro do you have?
2016-10-30 13:27:43	OvenWerks	lost_boy: ^^
2016-10-30 13:27:49	lost_boy	Elementary OS Freya
2016-10-30 13:29:27	OvenWerks	I am not familiar with that, how old is it? ardour 2 is over 6 yearsa old
2016-10-30 13:30:10	rgareus	lost_boy: Ardour5 lets you use the Mixer as a "tab" in the main window
2016-10-30 13:30:25	rgareus	Ardour2.X.  well that's ancient history :)
2016-10-30 13:31:01	lost_boy	Wow, I'm just gonna try to updated it manually~

2016-10-31 06:08:35	the_CLA	rgareus: Yes, I ran it manually (multiple times) after resume and checked with "status". Running it gives me different results each time, and the IRQs supposed to be highest priority don't end up at the top each time.

2016-10-31 06:21:33	OvenWerks	the running manually after boot will tell you if it is a timing issue or not.
2016-10-31 06:22:07	the_CLA	OvenWerks: For example my ethernet ends up at a higher priority all the time than it should.
2016-10-31 06:23:56	OvenWerks	That is one problem I have not had. in the rtirq config the devices can be specified more closely. you don't have to use snd. Maybe the name of the eth driver is too similar to something else you load or it is on the same IRQ.
2016-10-31 06:24:25	the_CLA	OvenWerks: I tried various settings there.
2016-10-31 06:24:41	OvenWerks	depending on the startup the irqs may be distributed differently.

2016-10-31 06:32:57	OvenWerks	That may not be the problem then.
2016-10-31 06:33:29	OvenWerks	do you have your internal sound turn on?

2016-10-31 06:33:43	the_CLA	OvenWerks: Yes.
2016-10-31 06:34:11	OvenWerks	nothing shares so good
2016-10-31 06:35:06	OvenWerks	none of the irqs are marked as usb so there is nothing for rtirq to grab and elevate
2016-10-31 06:37:47	the_CLA	Ok, if I explicitly put the wireles at the end into the config, it gets assigned a lower priority.
2016-10-31 06:37:47		[06:37]
2016-10-31 06:38:48	OvenWerks	if you are not using internal sound with jack I would not elevate it's priority.

2016-10-31 06:40:06	the_CLA	I sometimes use it with jack, so...
2016-10-31 06:40:24	OvenWerks	it should still be lower than your usb interface
2016-10-31 06:40:46	OvenWerks	internal interfaces may have latency limits above the USB unit.
2016-10-31 06:41:08	the_CLA	OvenWerks: Exept that I can's seem to elevate the USB interface explicitly.
2016-10-31 06:41:27	OvenWerks	because none of your interupts have usb in there name you can't use the text usb to raise their priority.
2016-10-31 06:42:06	OvenWerks	 if you do a sudo ps xa you should see some  [irq/20-ehci_hcd] kinds of things
2016-10-31 06:42:08	the_CLA	So the question is if it might be possible to change that.

2016-10-31 06:45:14	OvenWerks	in /etc/default/rtirq what is your RTIRQ_NAME_LIST
2016-10-31 06:46:25	the_CLA	I already put xhci_hcd there. But so I guess it elevates the whole USB stuff - including external keyboard and mouse, if connected.
2016-10-31 06:46:44	OvenWerks	yes no other choice in your case
2016-10-31 06:47:40	OvenWerks	don't touch the mouse while recording :)
2016-10-31 06:47:46	the_CLA	At least by explicitly putting enp0s31 at the end the wireless now gets a lower priority. Previously it always tended to get somewhere in between the other entries.
2016-10-31 06:48:25	OvenWerks	any little bit helps

2016-10-31 12:13:57	rgareus	zequence: ardour should move then into place at rec-stop
2016-10-31 12:14:24	rgareus	zequence: there have not been changes there since 4.7  -- at least not for audio regions

2016-10-31 12:15:23	zequence	I had to manually move almost every track I recorded

2016-10-31 12:16:16	zequence	rgareus: No, it's back at the studio
2016-10-31 12:16:42	zequence	But, I could do it tomorrow afternoon though.
2016-10-31 12:16:43	rgareus	it's probably   "Automatic (based on I/O connections)  Currently:  <the interesting part>"
2016-10-31 12:17:14	rgareus	and that may differ  align with existing-materal   vs  align-with-capture time.
2016-10-31 12:17:35	rgareus	if one track aligns and the others don't.  probably some connection difference..
2016-10-31 12:18:44	zequence	Ok, I will check that setting.
2016-10-31 12:20:08	zequence	One bug that was added with ardour5 for certain was that when creating a new track, you fill in the name, but the name will be reversed to default whenever you change something else before accepting.
2016-10-31 12:20:20	bazzy	tkln, thanks for the link. I had already used another kind of realtime setting in that file.. but using the suggestions in that link. I recorded my first (mostly?) problem-free track from gentoo!
2016-10-31 12:21:19	zequence	And, another problem is the ordering of the tracks. Earler, when creating a new track, it would not always end up where you excepted it to end up - for example 'after selected'
2016-10-31 12:21:35	zequence	But, now the master channel will start change place when adding new channels

2016-10-31 13:03:06	bazzy	OK thanks. Also, been awhile :) 
2016-10-31 13:03:32	rgareus	in a nutshell:   start jack normally (using the firewire card).   then run    alsa_out
2016-10-31 13:03:50	bazzy	I tried that, unfortunately alsa_out complained the device is busy.
2016-10-31 13:04:05	rgareus	probably    alsa_out -d hw:0   (for the internal soundcard)
2016-10-31 13:04:15	rgareus	aah pulseaudio?
2016-10-31 13:04:23	bazzy	unfortunately not.. I'm looking into it
2016-10-31 13:04:30	rgareus	bazzy:     cd /tmp && wget http://jackaudio.org/downloads/adevices.sh && bash ./adevices.sh  
2016-10-31 13:04:30	bazzy	I'm not using pulse
2016-10-31 13:04:45	rgareus	^^ will list all soundcards, their current settings  and programs using them..
2016-10-31 13:05:38	bazzy	VLC was "using it" -- though the fact that I'm not sure how to have VLC and other programs work simultaneously also bothers me
2016-10-31 13:05:56	bazzy	anyway alsa_out works now :)
2016-10-31 13:06:21	bazzy	nice.. immediately appears in the routing grid!
2016-10-31 13:07:20	rgareus	bazzy: jack (and alsa_in/out)  require exclusive access to the device
2016-10-31 13:07:49	rgareus	if multiple apps can use it, any app can change the sample-rate  or buffersize  at any time  (and apps are expected to cope with that).  for desktop/music that's usually fine
2016-10-31 13:07:54	bazzy	I see.. so then I would have to configure user programs to access jack by default then huh
2016-10-31 13:08:13	bazzy	or.. something like that.. 
2016-10-31 13:08:16	rgareus	but while recording the last you'll want is  VLC or Firefox  changing the sample-rate halfway in between :)
2016-10-31 13:08:25	bazzy	I understand that
2016-10-31 13:08:47	rgareus	there's a  "How can I play audio from …. via JACK?"  at   http://jackaudio.org/faq/

2016-10-31 13:09:13	bazzy	Thanks man
2016-10-31 13:09:13	rgareus	most pro-audio distros  set up an alsa-bridge  by default   (KXstudio, AVLinux do that OOTB)
2016-10-31 13:09:39	bazzy	At any rate, all of my dilemmas getting this to work on Linux have been solved tonight! Thanks everyone who chimed in

2016-10-31 13:42:02	bazzy	[23:06:21] nice.. immediately appears in the routing grid! [23:06:21]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	rgareus	[23:07:20] bazzy: jack (and alsa_in/out)  require exclusive access to the device [23:07:20]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	rgareus	[23:07:49] if multiple apps can use it, any app can change the sample-rate  or buffersize  at any time  (and apps are expected to cope with that).  for desktop/music that's usually fine [23:07:49]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	bazzy	[23:07:54] I see.. so then I would have to configure user programs to access jack by default then huh [23:07:54]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	bazzy	[23:08:13] or.. something like that..  [23:08:13]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	rgareus	[23:08:16] but while recording the last you'll want is  VLC or Firefox  changing the sample-rate halfway in between :) [23:08:16]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	bazzy	[23:08:25] I understand that [23:08:25]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	rgareus	[23:08:47] there's a  "How can I play audio from …. via JACK?"  at   http://jackaudio.org/faq/ [23:08:47]

2016-10-31 13:42:02	bazzy	[23:09:13] Thanks man [23:09:13]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	rgareus	[23:09:13] most pro-audio distros  set up an alsa-bridge  by default   (KXstudio, AVLinux do that OOTB) [23:09:13]
2016-10-31 13:42:02	bazzy	[23:09:39] At any rate, all of my dilemmas getting this to work on Linux have been solved tonight! Thanks everyone who chimed in [23:09:39]

2016-10-31 13:50:49	Bitrunner	Hmm my audacity has very long latency between display and speaker. Latency of Ardour seems to be ok. Strange. 
2016-10-31 13:51:32	rgareus	Bitrunner: same buffersize?
2016-10-31 13:51:42	rgareus	audacity using jack?   (via portaudio)
2016-10-31 13:52:20	Bitrunner	strange. Audacity using ALSA, Ardour using jack
2016-10-31 13:52:28	Bitrunner	I had expected that ardour has a latency problem then
2016-10-31 13:52:35	Bitrunner	since jack sits on top of alsa
2016-10-31 13:52:55	rgareus	Bitrunner: that does not add latency.
2016-10-31 13:53:07	rgareus	it just uses the interface.
2016-10-31 13:53:24	rgareus	no extra buffering.  jack just asks the kernel (via the alsa api) to give it callbacks
2016-10-31 13:53:36	Bitrunner	hm
2016-10-31 13:53:45	Bitrunner	there seems to be no buffer size setting in audacity

2016-10-31 16:21:03	rgareus	[01:29:30] and sorry that we can't do much about it.  at least not on ardour side of things [01:29:30]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	rgareus	[01:30:12] 'safe mode' should at least open it.   remove the plugin    save/quit  + re-open [01:30:12]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	bluesnik	[01:30:33] nothing to excuse, Thank u very much 4 pointing me 2 the right direction ... [01:30:33]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	rgareus	[01:30:42] or maybe hand edit the plugin-state file   in <session-dir>plugins/*    [01:30:42]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	bluesnik	[01:40:12] ... ok, found the file, opened and see some url-prefixes. All valid (means the url from http to the last slash is browsable) [01:40:12]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	rgareus	[01:41:31] they're just URIs (identifiers)  if the URI resolves as URL and points to some documentation that's just icing [01:41:31]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	bluesnik	[01:41:31] ... but as you said, this is a LS problem - not ardour's. [01:41:31]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	rgareus	[01:41:43] the problem was that LS saves one ID  and expects another at load time. [01:41:43]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	rgareus	[01:42:20] it saved a "state-string"  but on load tries and wants a path [01:42:20]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	bluesnik	[01:44:24] should I insert absolut file paths instead? [01:44:24]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	rgareus	[01:45:34] it's not the path itself .  i suppose there some     ....#state-file   [01:45:34]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	rgareus	[01:45:50] and the type of that is not   http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/atom#Path [01:45:50]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	LAbot	[01:45:51] Title: LV2 Atom (at lv2plug.in) [01:45:51]
2016-10-31 16:21:03	bluesnik	[01:50:04] ok, thank you for that help. Its late now and I'll continue tomorrow with that Problem. But it seems, it become dependecies-hell-journey :D Bye ... [01:50:04]

2016-11-01 02:07:16	clueless	*that I can do on audacity or musescore that I can't do in ardour?
2016-11-01 02:08:06	rgareus	audacity is a soundfile editor.  you can modify individual samples.  Ardour cannot do that (ardour is non-destructive it won't ever change raw data once its on disk)
2016-11-01 02:08:33	rgareus	the list for the other way round is much longer :)

2016-11-01 02:11:25	clueless	right?
2016-11-01 02:11:38	rgareus	yep
2016-11-01 02:12:45	clueless	and I can make that into a sample and overlay a midi file of say... moonlight sonata, with the squeeky toys
2016-11-01 02:12:46	the_CLA_2	clueless: The difference is that Ardour does this in realtime while Audacity renders that stuff (offline) into the audio file.
2016-11-01 02:13:29	clueless	oh, so I can play moonlight sonata on stage, live with a midicontroller and a prerecorded sample?
2016-11-01 02:14:23	rgareus	you could,  but as for Beethoven you do not want any MIDI, but real musicians :)

2016-11-01 02:20:04	the_CLA_2	clueless: BTW Ardour can do MIDI but has no score editor (compared to Musescore).
2016-11-01 02:20:22	clueless	yeah, I feared that might be the case
2016-11-01 02:20:32	clueless	can I export the midi file?
2016-11-01 02:21:06	rgareus	yes, you can import/export .mid.   A lso ardour uses .mid directly  (no internal special format)
2016-11-01 02:21:40	clueless	(yeah, I know Im going to lose things live velocity ect. but I'll make engraving piano sheets quite a bit quicker)

2016-11-01 02:22:25	clueless	*like
2016-11-01 02:22:40	the_CLA_2	Maybe it's also possible to sync Musescore with Ardour - but I'm not familiar with the latter.
2016-11-01 02:22:50	clueless	lol, doubt it
2016-11-01 02:26:02	clueless	how stable is Ardour on Arch linux (if it can do what I think it can, and act as a sound bank for live peformances, so I can add some intense bends to mozart piano pieces, I'll need it to be reliable)) 
2016-11-01 02:26:47	rgareus	ardour itself is very robust these days.  Plugins are what's causing most headaches.
2016-11-01 02:27:16	clueless	can it do things like live looping?
2016-11-01 02:27:17	the_CLA_2	clueless: Ardour itself would not act as a sound bank for live peformances - you would need additional plugins for that.
2016-11-01 02:27:23	clueless	oh...
2016-11-01 02:27:30	clueless	ok
2016-11-01 02:28:11	clueless	so, for live stuff, is the a better program that I should be looking at?
2016-11-01 02:28:20	rgareus	Ardour itself is just concearned with MIDI data.     midi-> audio  needs a synth plugin.
2016-11-01 02:28:38	the_CLA_2	...and audio of course.
2016-11-01 02:28:44	rgareus	heh
2016-11-01 02:29:32	clueless	Im going to take a guess and say that the program doent come with many/any?
2016-11-01 02:29:34	rgareus	clueless: background sequencing for live performances?
2016-11-01 02:29:51	the_CLA_2	clueless: You might look at Ardour as a recorder and editor + mixer in wich you can insert plugins for various types of processing.
2016-11-01 02:30:19	clueless	well, more as a cheap scate way to not buy a looping pedal... but sure that too
2016-11-01 02:31:05	the_CLA_2	clueless: If you just need looping, maybe sooperlooper might be an option. But it all depends...
2016-11-01 02:31:22	clueless	is that a plugin or a program?
2016-11-01 02:31:59	the_CLA_2	A program, but I read there is also a plugin version in the making... or already done?
2016-11-01 02:32:02	rgareus	sooperlooper comes in both variants
2016-11-01 02:32:19	rgareus	the_CLA_2: there is, thanks to the MOD team.

2016-11-01 02:33:29	gcrk	hello, i have a question. i made a session, added some tracks and added 4 aux sends to them. i have a midi binding map which maps potis to the send controlls. it works for 2 of 4, but didnt for the other 4 :o
2016-11-01 02:34:30	clueless	yep well I shall download ardour when I next have internet and apologise in advance for asking stupid questions
2016-11-01 02:34:34	gcrk	replace potis with encoder, sorry wrong language
2016-11-01 02:34:43	rgareus	gcrk: no immediate itdea.
2016-11-01 02:35:15	rgareus	gcrk: do all encoders work?  ie can you map the last encoder to the first send?  maybe some CC/Channel ambiguity
2016-11-01 02:35:36	gcrk	rgareus: how are the sends numbered? maybe the error cames because i "copied" them from one channel to another?
2016-11-01 02:35:44	edogawa	openav's luppp might be a looper option too, 
2016-11-01 02:35:45	rgareus	oh wait, you're writing a .bindings map  (not generic midi    ctrl+middle click  bind)
2016-11-01 02:35:55	gcrk	rgareus: they all send midi data, i checked it with the ardour midi tracer

2016-11-01 02:38:08	gcrk	rgareus: the sends are, in this order: reverb, monitor 1, monitor 2, external send (af). the first and the last work.

2016-11-01 02:39:57	gcrk	rgareus: how does the binding from B1 1 to the send works? cause when i change the order in ardour the encoders still bind to the same send
2016-11-01 02:40:28	gcrk	rgareus: maybe i added a send and deleted so the actual sends are not 1,2,3 and 4 but 1,2,5 and 6?

2016-11-01 06:30:40	rgareus	the_CLA_2: maybe you can answer my question anyway.  does a multi-out    Kick, Snare, Hi-Hat, Tom, Floor-Tom, Overheads L/R, Percussion L/R   make sense to you?
2016-11-01 06:30:53	rgareus	and Ride is part of the OH.
2016-11-01 06:31:58	rgareus	and the Roto-Toms are currently part of "Percussion"
2016-11-01 06:32:00	the_CLA_2	Yes, (optional) multi out would be nice. Also HiHat needs some exclusive trigger function.
2016-11-01 06:32:01	ben_xdubber	rgareus,   OH should play with  "every" drum hit.
2016-11-01 06:32:42	rgareus	ben_xdubber: what do you mean?  bleed samples into OH?
2016-11-01 06:32:45	ben_xdubber	rgareus,    I think the term should be "cymbals" or "other"  if it isn't really the overheads, but just the overhead-mic'ed cymbals
2016-11-01 06:32:49	the_CLA_2	ben_xdubber: Not sure how the drums are sampled.
2016-11-01 06:33:06	rgareus	ben_xdubber: indeed "Cymbals" is a better term.
2016-11-01 06:33:23	rgareus	(it's only visible in the pin dialog on mouse-over, anyway)
2016-11-01 06:33:36	the_CLA_2	ben_xdubber: possibly not like with Drumgizmo.
2016-11-01 06:33:55	rgareus	they're all separate samples (no bleed like in DG)
2016-11-01 06:33:56	the_CLA_2	I haven't taken a look at the soundfont.
2016-11-01 06:34:11	ben_xdubber	rgareus,    in the commercial drum libraries, when you hit the kick drum,  there are 3+ samples:  the kick, and 2 overheads.  and/or 2 room mics.  Then the user can balance how much close-kick, overhead, and room is blended.
2016-11-01 06:34:12	the_CLA_2	rgareus: I suspected to be the case.
2016-11-01 06:34:16	rgareus	and they're all mono samples,  just panned
2016-11-01 06:34:34	rgareus	ben_xdubber: right,  we won't go that far.
2016-11-01 06:34:57	the_CLA_2	ben_xdubber: Well... Drumgizmo for that more "real" think. I guess the avl stuff is more supposed to being lightweight.
2016-11-01 06:35:02	rgareus	glen is planning to make a drumgizmo kit out of it.
2016-11-01 06:35:23	rgareus	but due to the bleed  (all samples all mics) that'll be maybe a GB or thereabouts.

2016-11-01 06:42:46	tom-	rgareus: so i just set N_NOTES=xx after make, right?
2016-11-01 06:42:47	rgareus	or AD2  or EZD  or ...
2016-11-01 06:43:17	rgareus	tom-: yes    make clean ;   make N_NOTES=16 N_STEPS=12  
2016-11-01 06:43:36	rgareus	tom-: the URIs will differ so you can compile and install a few ones (I think)
2016-11-01 06:43:37	tom-	nice
2016-11-01 06:44:09	rgareus	I don't recall if `make install  ...`  works for multiples (the folder itself)
2016-11-01 06:44:11	ben_xdubber	rgareus,    I still like your idea of built-in processing.    for a simple user:  some eq on the bass+snare,   plus a reverb,  might alleviate the need for individual outs.
2016-11-01 06:44:33	tom-	rgareus: i got NO BOX BACKGROUND FOR 16 steps, 4 notes
2016-11-01 06:44:35	ben_xdubber	rgareus,   alternatively, we need to do the thing where ardour/mixbus creates the buses to receive each multi-out.
2016-11-01 06:45:12	tom-	ok, found boxmaker
2016-11-01 06:45:34	rgareus	ben_xdubber: my current reason against it:  it's extra plugin specific state

2016-11-01 06:47:42	tom-	the gui part i mean
2016-11-01 06:48:09	rgareus	the openGL version is  not skeuomorphic,  and also allows to set velocity on every control
2016-11-01 06:48:25	the_CLA_2	rgareus: BTW do there really have to be separate plugins for the drumkits?

2016-11-01 06:50:23	the_CLA_2	Would be nice, I think.
2016-11-01 06:50:45	rgareus	the_CLA_2: I'm not sure.   that's 1 click more.
2016-11-01 06:51:00	rgareus	load plugin, load preset.   you might as well use a-fluidsynth  and generate presets

2016-11-01 06:53:28	the_CLA_2	rgareus: Then OTOH it would be nice for quickly comparing how the different kits sound in the context. It could load one of the kits as default.
2016-11-01 06:53:34	tom-	rgareus: you have a bunch of interesting lv2 in your repo.. 
2016-11-01 06:53:54	the_CLA_2	Just simple buttons to switch kits.
2016-11-01 06:53:56	 *	tom- used avls drumkit at least once
2016-11-01 06:54:15	rgareus	the_CLA_2: you can also just add  /the other/  ardour will ask to replace the instrument.
2016-11-01 06:54:30	tom-	what does the dedicated plugin offer more?
2016-11-01 06:54:40	rgareus	the_CLA_2: but yes.  maybe /fake/ 2 plugins which are just different default presets.
2016-11-01 06:55:31	rgareus	the_CLA_2: except we can't easily swap out the GUI..  lots more trouble to make that work
2016-11-01 06:56:02	tom-	rgareus: there is no install how-to for avldrumkit

2016-11-01 07:00:10	rgareus	I thought about xz'ing them that gets it down to 13MB.   but needs xz either at compile or runtime.
2016-11-01 07:00:27	rgareus	something for later... optimizations are last
2016-11-01 07:01:14	rgareus	it'll need a repo-change (remove the originals from the git history)  but whatever.
2016-11-01 07:01:36	tom-	i'm tricking around 1 gb free space on my disk for at least 6 months. i should really get a new disk
2016-11-01 07:02:36	tom-	rgareus: "does a  multi-out    Kick, Snare, Hi-Hat, Tom, Floor-Tom, Overheads  L/R, Percussion L/R   make sense to you

2016-11-01 07:03:27	tom-	fantastic :)

2016-11-01 07:08:39	rgareus	tom-: if you have recent ardour,  the plugin will automaticaly send a midnam to ardour  and ardour display note-names etc.

2016-11-01 07:10:43	rgareus	I'm not sure if they'll stay.   highlights are nicer (but more work)
2016-11-01 07:11:12	rgareus	I'll probably roll back to "lights"  once glen gets around to make proper pics for every kit.

2016-11-01 09:02:39	OvenWerks	MaurizioB: spec is that if yu never send it the receiver should not expect it. Once you send the first one, the first time an event doesn't show up before the timeout=all notes off (I think)
2016-11-01 09:04:04	OvenWerks	MaurizioB: anything more strict does not really follow the MIDI spec
2016-11-01 09:04:23	MaurizioB	OvenWerks: I know, I just read it, the problem is that the hub should send the event to the computer *every* event, including active sensing, instead it internally processes it
2016-11-01 09:05:02	MaurizioB	strangely enough, it will send it only on port 1, even if the keyboard is connected to port 3
