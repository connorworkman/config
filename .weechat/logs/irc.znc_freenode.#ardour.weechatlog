2016-10-17 12:54:37	Somethis	rgareus: checking ...
2016-10-17 12:54:57	Somethis	Ardour 4.6.0

2016-10-17 12:55:13	Somethis	... oops, multiline
2016-10-17 12:55:43	rgareus	most likely issue is that some external files are missing
2016-10-17 12:55:55	rgareus	next likeley: disk full.

2016-10-17 12:57:52	Somethis	rgareus: ok ... unchecking that
2016-10-17 12:58:14	rgareus	Somethis: maybe you're used "external" files (not copied into session-dir) and those files are no longer available.
2016-10-17 13:00:54	Somethis	rgareus: looks good so far ... no error message ... I'm manually checking the files.

2016-10-17 13:09:57	the_CLA	But I guess the proper solution would be if the user cleaned up the session first, so that there are no files missing anymore. ;)

2016-10-17 13:37:08	Somethis	something along the line of autotune for guitars :-D
2016-10-17 13:37:08		[13:37]

2016-10-17 13:39:18	Bitrunner	"E" is too low for a Telecaster. Try an "e" ;)
2016-10-17 13:39:27	Somethis	turns out, it's the volume knob

2016-10-17 13:40:55	Bitrunner	but reading manuals is "out" these days I think
2016-10-17 13:41:38	ristic	Melodyne can change particualr notes in a guitar chord.
2016-10-17 13:41:45	ristic	Turn a G into a Gm for example.
2016-10-17 13:43:05	Somethis	Melodyne was really impressive ... five years back, already
2016-10-17 13:44:02	Bitrunner	ristic: the point is, the plugin would have to know that "Gm" instead of "G" is right that time
2016-10-17 13:44:44	Bitrunner	and /dev/crystal_ball is dysfunctional even on newest Linux Kernels :-(
2016-10-17 13:44:54	Somethis	would work ... unless it's Jazz or an REM song.
2016-10-17 13:45:05	Bitrunner	or may be some modern avant garde composition
2016-10-17 13:47:07	Bitrunner	ok, you never need that plugin for Free Jazz by Definition ;)

2016-10-17 13:52:25	rgareus	I suppose "a remove all missing files from session" option or something could be added

2016-10-17 14:02:13	Somethis	I presume "dead" is a folder full of intentionally deleted files?
2016-10-17 14:03:23	the_CLA	O.o
2016-10-17 14:04:16	the_CLA	Well, it's the place where session cleanup copies the files first. Just confusing that the save as function tries to copy anything from there.

2016-10-17 14:11:27	the_CLA	I guess before trying to debug things you should update to the latest release to see if the issues still exist.

2016-10-17 21:03:36	Bitrunner	[23:44:44] and /dev/crystal_ball is dysfunctional even on newest Linux Kernels :-( [23:44:44]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[23:44:54] would work ... unless it's Jazz or an REM song. [23:44:54]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Bitrunner	[23:45:05] or may be some modern avant garde composition [23:45:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Bitrunner	[23:47:07] ok, you never need that plugin for Free Jazz by Definition ;) [23:47:07]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[23:49:47] rgareus: ... I just reopened the project and am getting a brand new "Ardour cannot find the audio file ..." dialogue ... [23:49:47]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[23:50:16] rgareus: would it help if I document what happens? [23:50:16]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	rgareus	[23:51:03] Somethis: not really. if external files are removed, there's not much we can do. [23:51:03]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[23:51:50] rgareus: mhmm, yes that makes sense. I didn't (re)move any files, though. [23:51:50]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	rgareus	[23:52:25] I suppose "a remove all missing files from session" option or something could be added [23:52:25]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[23:52:38] ok, it's a file in a subfolder called *interchange* [23:52:38]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	rgareus	[23:53:03] mmh. that's inside of the session-dir [23:53:03]

2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[23:56:58] The file's not there (and neither a similar one) ... strange. [23:56:58]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	the_CLA	[23:59:52] Somethis: Is that the original session or the saved-as one? [23:59:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:00:36] the_CLA: that's the saved as one ... I'm checking the logfile for entries of the missing file. [00:00:36]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:01:24] the_CLA: ok ... the last entry reads ... [INFO]: attempting to copy /home/gemini/Desktop/Files/Media/Music Composition/20160923-GoodbyeBrigitte_Backup09/dead/Vocals Temp-1.wav to /home/gemini/Desktop/Files/Media/Music Composition/20171018-GoodbyeBrigitte/dead/Vocals Temp-1.wav [00:01:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:02:13] I presume "dead" is a folder full of intentionally deleted files? [00:02:13]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	the_CLA	[00:03:22] O.o [00:03:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	the_CLA	[00:04:16] Well, it's the place where session cleanup copies the files first. Just confusing that the save as function tries to copy anything from there. [00:04:16]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:06:36] the_CLA: and Ardour looks for the file in /interchange .. on restart [00:06:36]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:08:40] any suggestions ... last time "Skip all missing files" crashed Ardour. [00:08:40]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	the_CLA	[00:10:02] Somethis: No idea. I think there were also some changes to "save as" after 4.6 - but not sure if those matter in that case. [00:10:02]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:10:27] the_CLA: ok, thanks, though. [00:10:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	the_CLA	[00:11:27] I guess before trying to debug things you should update to the latest release to see if the issues still exist. [00:11:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:11:39] yup ... [00:11:39]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	the_CLA	[00:11:55] Anyway. Time to get some sleep for me! [00:11:55]

2016-10-18 00:14:23	rgareus	[23:52:25] I suppose "a remove all missing files from session" option or something could be added [23:52:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[23:52:38] ok, it's a file in a subfolder called *interchange* [23:52:38]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	rgareus	[23:53:03] mmh. that's inside of the session-dir [23:53:03]

2016-10-18 00:14:23	LAbot	[23:54:52] Title: Saving to a new Session in Ardour - Album on Imgur (at imgur.com) [23:54:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[23:54:57] step 4 ... [23:54:57]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[23:55:27] checking if that file exists [23:55:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[23:56:58] The file's not there (and neither a similar one) ... strange. [23:56:58]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	the_CLA	[23:59:52] Somethis: Is that the original session or the saved-as one? [23:59:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:00:36] the_CLA: that's the saved as one ... I'm checking the logfile for entries of the missing file. [00:00:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:01:24] the_CLA: ok ... the last entry reads ... [INFO]: attempting to copy /home/gemini/Desktop/Files/Media/Music Composition/20160923-GoodbyeBrigitte_Backup09/dead/Vocals Temp-1.wav to /home/gemini/Desktop/Files/Media/Music Composition/20171018-GoodbyeBrigitte/dead/Vocals Temp-1.wav [00:01:24]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:02:13] I presume "dead" is a folder full of intentionally deleted files? [00:02:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	the_CLA	[00:03:22] O.o [00:03:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	the_CLA	[00:04:16] Well, it's the place where session cleanup copies the files first. Just confusing that the save as function tries to copy anything from there. [00:04:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:06:36] the_CLA: and Ardour looks for the file in /interchange .. on restart [00:06:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:08:40] any suggestions ... last time "Skip all missing files" crashed Ardour. [00:08:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	the_CLA	[00:10:02] Somethis: No idea. I think there were also some changes to "save as" after 4.6 - but not sure if those matter in that case. [00:10:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:10:27] the_CLA: ok, thanks, though. [00:10:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	the_CLA	[00:11:27] I guess before trying to debug things you should update to the latest release to see if the issues still exist. [00:11:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:11:39] yup ... [00:11:39]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	the_CLA	[00:11:55] Anyway. Time to get some sleep for me! [00:11:55]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:13:25] the_CLA: good night ;-) [00:13:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:13:35] same here, mhmpf [00:13:35]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[02:39:54] rgareus: the vamp_audio_to_midi script. if I'm reading it right it wants ONE audio region and ONE midi region the same size to hold output? How to create the empty midi region? (It's not obvious. I had a  couple ideas I tried that didn't work) [02:39:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[02:55:28] nstewart, what did you try? [02:55:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[03:55:45] one thing I tried was creating markers at the ends of the audio region, then try to create a region in the midi track, but without content, I can't seem to do region operations [03:55:45]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[03:57:30] paas44 (I think it was) and myself scratched our heads a bit and came up with some ideas which I don't recall but were unsuccessful [03:57:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:02:50] nstewart, creating a region always requires having a source [04:02:50]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:03:04] nstewart, so you'd need an SMFSource to get started [04:03:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[04:06:32] I don't see that it knows about anything higher than a midi region.  [04:06:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:12:11] nstewart, reviewing the lua bindings, what you need isn't there [04:12:11]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[04:12:27] so the track already IS an SMF  on disk? [04:12:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:12:49] nstewart, don't get the levels confused [04:12:49]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:13:17] nstewart, the only thing that knows about files on disk are diskstreams (hidden component in a Track) and regions [04:13:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:13:33] nstewart, for playback purposes, a track is just a playlist; no sources [04:13:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:13:47] nstewart, for recording purposes, a track is a diskstream, and it has 1 or more sources to write to [04:13:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[04:13:56] if I can figure out what is needed I'll take a stab at it. But I have to drop.  [04:13:56]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:14:12] nstewart, regions are the main thing that reference sources because they are the objects that actually read data from them [04:14:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:14:28] rgareus, there's no constructor for a MIDI region [04:14:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:15:13] nstewart, ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ [04:15:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:15:17] rgareus, sorry, not for you [04:15:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[04:21:02] is there a Region constructor for that matter? Didn't see it. I thought I recalled something in one of the docs or examples that there was a reason - like you shouldn't create them directly. but I'm foggy  [04:21:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	cglocke	[08:35:28] good morning! [08:35:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	cglocke	[08:36:16] any plugin recommendations for frequency "sweeping"? I want to start at a specific freq and increase or decrease the frequency over time until another freq is reached (e.g. to create a simple siren)...  [08:36:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	rgareus	[08:38:07] cglocke: you could automate invada's test-tone generator -- but I don't know if it's a smooth ramp. [08:38:07]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	cglocke	[08:41:17] ok thx, I'll try that :) [08:41:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	cglocke	[08:47:59] rgareus... any tip on atomation btw? :D [08:47:59]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	cglocke	[08:48:02] *automation [08:48:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	cglocke	[08:53:55] ah xD found it :) [08:53:55]

2016-10-18 04:14:09	nstewart	rgareus: had some questions about the _vamp_audio_to_midi plugin. It seems to want ONE audio region and ONE MIDI region (presumably the same size, but empty to hold the output.) I haven't been able to figure out how to create an empty midi region, and it doesn't appear that I can create one in the script. 
2016-10-18 04:14:27	nstewart	I know constructors aren't exported, but I wasn't sure how to create it looking at the bindings.
2016-10-18 04:15:28	nstewart	If the tracks are selected instead, it makes it simpler to decide where to put it I suppose. But you can't currently select one region and one track. They must be like things
2016-10-18 04:15:28		[04:15]

2016-10-18 05:18:08	IOhannes	including en (even though it doesn't do anything)
2016-10-18 05:18:43	IOhannes	i could have also just fixed the english "translation", but i think it better to just remove all occurences of the spelling error.

2016-10-18 11:45:36	rgareus	and apart from that.. it does not fit in 1920px in width :)  http://robin.linuxaudio.org/tmp/funny_midi.png

2016-10-18 11:46:45	rgareus	aah I've switched forth and back a couple of times..  it kept adding table headers

2016-10-18 11:55:32	jpt9	Is there any way to have Ardour play audio files you've imported at a different sample rate (i.e. changing both tempo/pitch), similar to changing the sample rate for a track in Audacity?
2016-10-18 11:55:59	rgareus	jpt9: there's a time-stretch tool
2016-10-18 11:56:41	rgareus	but that preserves pitch
2016-10-18 11:57:20	rgareus	the only other option is vari-speed playback -- but that's the complete session.

2016-10-18 11:58:56	jpt9	rgareus: Actually, in the list of resample methods, it's got an option for just resampling without preserving pitch.
2016-10-18 11:58:56		[11:58]
2016-10-18 11:59:44	rgareus	las: and incorrect function name on my part.

2016-10-18 12:00:14	the_CLA_2	rgareus: Doesn't the timestretch tool also have a mode that varies the pitch... I seem to remember that this had been added at some point.
2016-10-18 12:01:11	las	rgareus: should be fixed now

2016-10-18 12:05:39	las	Defcronyke: that if *their* "standard" wins, they will make a fortune on licensing fees

2016-10-18 12:12:22	rgareus	for the case at hand (auto-configure plugin chain) you also need _very_ detailed knowledge about the blocks. e.g. "How does this EQ affect signal phase depending on <parameters>"
2016-10-18 12:14:01	rgareus	I don't see auto-config happen with a random set of plugins.  they'll all come from one maker. and the  tool that does the analysis is trained (neural network) and optimized (heuristics) for the given set of plugins.

2016-10-18 23:55:22	las	[23:01:24] Defcronyke, i'm pessimistic because (a) it actually IS hard (b) the payoff is small (b) the politics are awful [23:01:24]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Defcronyke	[23:01:50] las those are fair points, but just don't say it won't happen please [23:01:50]

2016-10-18 23:55:22	las	[23:02:19] Defcronyke, everything i say should be prefixed by "i think" or "i doubt". i am not trying to say "i know" [23:02:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Defcronyke	[23:02:28] then prefix it ;) [23:02:28]

2016-10-18 23:55:22	barjac	[23:04:10] rgareus: Great, thanks :) [23:04:10]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:04:25] barjac: it's uscan compatible (machine readable latest version) [23:04:25]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:06:02] barjac: the uscan config is http://paste.debian.net/856636/  [23:06:02]

2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:06:42] barjac: it'll stop working once 5.5 is out. you only get the latest version [23:06:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	barjac	[23:07:13] rgareus: but then wget https://community.ardour.org/src/Ardour-5.5.0.tar.bz2 will work - no? [23:07:13]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:07:28] correct [23:07:28]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Defcronyke	[23:07:31] rgareus, if the current technologies make it unrealistic, the technologies will have to change once it becomes in high demand [23:07:31]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:07:51] Defcronyke: yeah, never say never. [23:07:51]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	barjac	[23:08:33] rgareus: It's for our spec file so the link is automatically tied to the version [23:08:33]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:09:42] Defcronyke: "Siri, make me a pancake." :) [23:09:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Defcronyke	[23:09:49] rgareus: anyway, I'm not totally convinced that the OP on that isn't a troll [23:09:49]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Defcronyke	[23:10:27] seems like they start all the threads these days [23:10:27]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	tom-	[23:10:53] plugins that somehow do hard work and then share their results is not totally absurd [23:10:53]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	tom-	[23:11:56] i've just read the "plugins future" thread [23:11:56]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Defcronyke	[23:12:07] that's the one I'm talking about [23:12:07]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:12:15] barjac: so that'll break once ardour updates, but the spec file is not updated -- unless you mirror the source [23:12:15]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	tom-	[23:12:30] and was speculating Defcronyke was the one of that thread :) [23:12:30]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:12:33] barjac: las-at-work had a strong opinion about not making old versions available, so that's what it's now. [23:12:33]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Defcronyke	[23:12:42] tom- i am Jeremy [23:12:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Defcronyke	[23:12:58] not the OP [23:12:58]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	tom-	[23:13:13] okie [23:13:13]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	tom-	[23:13:54] not a troll i think [23:13:54]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	tom-	[23:14:38] maybe a bit fuzzy, more like a broad field of generic "networked nodes" stuff [23:14:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	barjac	[23:14:53] rgareus: Well old versions will be in our svn so it's not an issue - just makes updates much easier for maintainer (me) when a new release comes out. [23:14:53]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:15:44] barjac: yeah, the debian team wanted the same -- which is why I've hacked that /src/ page.   [23:15:44]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	barjac	[23:16:18] rgareus: :) Thanks [23:16:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:16:48] the tar ball is also the /last step of a release  (git tag is the very first;   debian wrongly watched github's tags) [23:16:48]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:17:22] if something goes amiss after the tag ... release builds .. testing   ....  NO TAR BALL  ; start over  -> debian was screwed (happend with ardour 5.2) [23:17:22]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:20:53] Defcronyke: personally, I'd also rather have a good overdrive and amp-sim first that can match the Fender Twin here.  Rather than a couple of crap plugins talking to each other... [23:20:53]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:21:34] just to set priorities straight. [23:21:34]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:22:02] and nylon guitar strings that don't need 5 hours or re-tuning after changing them... please! [23:22:02]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Defcronyke	[23:22:06] hehe okay [23:22:06]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Defcronyke	[23:22:28] yes unless our time on the earth was infinite, we have to consider priorities [23:22:28]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	rgareus	[23:24:19] well, dreams and crazy ideas are important. [23:24:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Defcronyke	[23:24:45] so first priority should be solving death [23:24:45]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Defcronyke	[23:25:11] second, space colonization so the earth doesn't fill up too much from the first [23:25:11]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	rgareus	[23:25:18] that'll create more problems than it's worth :) [23:25:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tom-	[23:28:13] from a plugins' host perspective, plugins that self-organize must look like a flash-mob :) [23:28:13]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	Defcronyke	[23:32:46] solving death though... nah I'll just produce with Ardour [23:32:46]
2016-10-18 23:55:23	tom-	[00:04:51] las: can you hear me? [00:04:51]

2016-10-19 00:08:22	touil76	Hello everyone. I'm experiencing a problem when trying to load an ardour 2 session into ardour 4: I get a window saying :
2016-10-19 00:08:42	touil76	"session {name of my session} did not load successfully: Cannot configure audio/midi engine with session parameters"
2016-10-19 00:09:18	touil76	Would there be a trick to get ardour 4 opening my previous work ?
2016-10-19 00:09:41	nick_m	touil76, u think you'd have a better chance with 5.4

2016-10-19 00:10:26		[00:10]
2016-10-19 00:11:22	touil76	It is weird because other work that were made with ardour 2 are opened without problem with ardour 4
2016-10-19 00:13:49	touil76	I still have an installation of ardour 2 on another computer. Is there a way to export this session with ardour 2 in a special format so that it could be then imported with ardour 4 ?

2016-10-19 00:41:23	rgareus	[23:03:50] barjac: https://community.ardour.org/src/ [23:03:50]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	barjac	[23:04:10] rgareus: Great, thanks :) [23:04:10]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	rgareus	[23:04:25] barjac: it's uscan compatible (machine readable latest version) [23:04:25]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	rgareus	[23:06:02] barjac: the uscan config is http://paste.debian.net/856636/  [23:06:02]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	barjac	[23:06:16] rgareus: wget https://community.ardour.org/src/Ardour-5.4.0.tar.bz2 works - that's all I need :) [23:06:16]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	rgareus	[23:06:42] barjac: it'll stop working once 5.5 is out. you only get the latest version [23:06:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	barjac	[23:07:13] rgareus: but then wget https://community.ardour.org/src/Ardour-5.5.0.tar.bz2 will work - no? [23:07:13]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	rgareus	[23:07:28] correct [23:07:28]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	Defcronyke	[23:07:31] rgareus, if the current technologies make it unrealistic, the technologies will have to change once it becomes in high demand [23:07:31]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	rgareus	[23:07:51] Defcronyke: yeah, never say never. [23:07:51]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	barjac	[23:08:33] rgareus: It's for our spec file so the link is automatically tied to the version [23:08:33]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	rgareus	[23:09:42] Defcronyke: "Siri, make me a pancake." :) [23:09:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	Defcronyke	[23:09:49] rgareus: anyway, I'm not totally convinced that the OP on that isn't a troll [23:09:49]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	Defcronyke	[23:10:27] seems like they start all the threads these days [23:10:27]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	tom-	[23:10:53] plugins that somehow do hard work and then share their results is not totally absurd [23:10:53]
2016-10-19 00:41:23	tom-	[23:11:56] i've just read the "plugins future" thread [23:11:56]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	Defcronyke	[23:12:07] that's the one I'm talking about [23:12:07]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	rgareus	[23:12:15] barjac: so that'll break once ardour updates, but the spec file is not updated -- unless you mirror the source [23:12:15]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	tom-	[23:12:30] and was speculating Defcronyke was the one of that thread :) [23:12:30]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	rgareus	[23:12:33] barjac: las-at-work had a strong opinion about not making old versions available, so that's what it's now. [23:12:33]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	Defcronyke	[23:12:42] tom- i am Jeremy [23:12:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	Defcronyke	[23:12:58] not the OP [23:12:58]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	tom-	[23:13:13] okie [23:13:13]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	tom-	[23:13:54] not a troll i think [23:13:54]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	tom-	[23:14:38] maybe a bit fuzzy, more like a broad field of generic "networked nodes" stuff [23:14:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	barjac	[23:14:53] rgareus: Well old versions will be in our svn so it's not an issue - just makes updates much easier for maintainer (me) when a new release comes out. [23:14:53]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	rgareus	[23:15:44] barjac: yeah, the debian team wanted the same -- which is why I've hacked that /src/ page.   [23:15:44]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	barjac	[23:16:18] rgareus: :) Thanks [23:16:18]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	rgareus	[23:16:48] the tar ball is also the /last step of a release  (git tag is the very first;   debian wrongly watched github's tags) [23:16:48]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	rgareus	[23:17:22] if something goes amiss after the tag ... release builds .. testing   ....  NO TAR BALL  ; start over  -> debian was screwed (happend with ardour 5.2) [23:17:22]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	rgareus	[23:20:53] Defcronyke: personally, I'd also rather have a good overdrive and amp-sim first that can match the Fender Twin here.  Rather than a couple of crap plugins talking to each other... [23:20:53]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	rgareus	[23:21:34] just to set priorities straight. [23:21:34]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	rgareus	[23:22:02] and nylon guitar strings that don't need 5 hours or re-tuning after changing them... please! [23:22:02]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	Defcronyke	[23:22:06] hehe okay [23:22:06]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	Defcronyke	[23:22:28] yes unless our time on the earth was infinite, we have to consider priorities [23:22:28]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	rgareus	[23:24:19] well, dreams and crazy ideas are important. [23:24:19]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	Defcronyke	[23:24:45] so first priority should be solving death [23:24:45]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	Defcronyke	[23:25:11] second, space colonization so the earth doesn't fill up too much from the first [23:25:11]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	rgareus	[23:25:18] that'll create more problems than it's worth :) [23:25:18]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	tom-	[23:28:13] from a plugins' host perspective, plugins that self-organize must look like a flash-mob :) [23:28:13]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	Defcronyke	[23:32:46] solving death though... nah I'll just produce with Ardour [23:32:46]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	tom-	[00:04:51] las: can you hear me? [00:04:51]

2016-10-19 00:41:24	touil76	[10:08:22] Hello everyone. I'm experiencing a problem when trying to load an ardour 2 session into ardour 4: I get a window saying : [10:08:22]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	touil76	[10:08:42] "session {name of my session} did not load successfully: Cannot configure audio/midi engine with session parameters" [10:08:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	touil76	[10:09:18] Would there be a trick to get ardour 4 opening my previous work ? [10:09:18]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	nick_m	[10:09:41] touil76, u think you'd have a better chance with 5.4 [10:09:41]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	touil76	[10:10:26] Maybe, but I would prefer to stick with the version provided with my ubuntu installation. [10:10:26]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	touil76	[10:11:22] It is weird because other work that were made with ardour 2 are opened without problem with ardour 4 [10:11:22]
2016-10-19 00:41:24	touil76	[10:13:48] I still have an installation of ardour 2 on another computer. Is there a way to export this session with ardour 2 in a special format so that it could be then imported with ardour 4 ? [10:13:48]

2016-10-19 05:49:33	nstewart	rgareus: thanks for the "draw region" tip - was able to replicate my manual import from SV's use of the plugin. 
2016-10-19 05:49:53	rgareus	nstewart: cool.
2016-10-19 05:49:55	nstewart	Now that I can kick the process off - I guess its time to look at how to refine it. 
2016-10-19 05:50:20	rgareus	nstewart: there's currently no GUI (to allow users to set settings of a lua plugin)  -- except instantiaion parameters for action- scripts
2016-10-19 05:50:55	nstewart	especially since SV can do a pretty good job at categorizing chord changes - seems like knowing "we" are in "G major" could help polyphonic transcription a bunch.
2016-10-19 05:51:01	rgareus	nstewart: that's also something to be done. -- though in this case it's proabaly less important since the  qm-transcription plugin has no parameters
2016-10-19 05:51:08	nstewart	although that info might not reside in the track being transcribed
2016-10-19 05:51:30	rgareus	yes  SV is definitly some miles ahead there
2016-10-19 05:52:51	rgareus	then again, meta-data tracks in ardour are coming closer by the day,   and exposing more of the API as lua-bindings is also underway.
2016-10-19 05:53:10	nstewart	wonder if you could beat the transcribed part against the original for error detection
2016-10-19 05:53:31	nstewart	certainly here it when you play the two parts together
2016-10-19 05:53:33	nstewart	hear
2016-10-19 05:56:16	rgareus	that's not a bad idea.

2016-10-19 06:25:06	las	king_: since JACK could use ALSA, OSS, FFADO, etc.
2016-10-19 06:25:33	king_	where do i select that from the start up manual in adour because i dont see that optiuon?

2016-10-19 06:35:58	king_	i went on youtube and and put in some commands for realtime useage and that still didnt work

2016-10-19 06:37:35	las	king_: you must still have your system set up correctly

2016-10-19 06:41:25	king_	like lmms?

2016-10-19 06:41:45	las	king_: how much clearer can i make this?
2016-10-19 06:42:16	las	king_: if you mean "does ardour have all the instruments etc. to make electronic beat-centric music, without using JACK to connect to other tools", then the answer is "maybe"
2016-10-19 06:42:32	king_	i understand im saying can i use synthesiers ?
2016-10-19 06:42:59	las	king_: they would have to be plugins
2016-10-19 06:43:07	las	king_: and you would install them separately from ardour
2016-10-19 06:43:18	las	king_: you may or may not be satisfied with the options available
2016-10-19 06:43:19	the_CLA	...or external hardware.
2016-10-19 06:43:41	las	king_: Ardour 5.4 comes with a synth plugin that can load SF2 soundfonts; no other built-in sound generation
2016-10-19 06:44:41	king_	so its better to make the beat on another program and just do the vocal nd mixing on ardour?
2016-10-19 06:44:51	las	king_: there's no answer to that question
2016-10-19 06:44:55	las	king_: let's put it this way
2016-10-19 06:45:15	las	king_: ardour is currently more focused on being used to record, edit and mix people actually playing instruments
2016-10-19 06:45:31	las	king_: some people do use it to do "electronic music production" without other tools
2016-10-19 06:45:35	king_	ok ok now i get it
2016-10-19 06:45:42	king_	similar to pro tools
2016-10-19 06:45:51	las	king_: yes, closer to PT, further from Ableton Live

2016-10-19 09:50:59	rgareus	and the issue that is solved in 3.3.5 has been around for > 18months. so you might just as well wait until Ubuntu gets around to update the lib.

2016-10-19 10:39:54	 *	Bollie is a bitwig user
2016-10-19 10:40:25	ktao	my question is how to implement buses in bitwig to load a sampler into the bus instead of having several copies of it in separate tracks
2016-10-19 10:41:04	Bollie	Err
2016-10-19 10:41:08	Bollie	Good question. ;)
2016-10-19 10:41:33	Bollie	Several midi tracks that adress a sampler in a single track or bus?
2016-10-19 10:41:39	Bollie	address*
2016-10-19 10:41:46	ktao	several midi tracks
2016-10-19 10:41:52	ktao	right
2016-10-19 10:42:27	Bollie	Hm... I've never tried that... but hold on. Sounds like an interesting challenge. ;)
2016-10-19 10:42:33	ktao	as far as i understood bitwig tracks have only ch1 inside
2016-10-19 10:43:00	ktao	and ignore chns 2-16
2016-10-19 10:44:07	ktao	bitwig website also confirms it that their tracks can have only ch1 and you can't assign other chns to them
2016-10-19 10:44:30	las	the opposite of Live ... all channels available except ... you can't tell them apart
2016-10-19 10:44:41	las	something wrong with someone's thinking there, methinks
2016-10-19 10:46:42	Bollie	Hm, indeed, the sampler (I
2016-10-19 10:46:57	Bollie	Hm, indeed, the sampler (I'd rather call it sample player) only accepts a single channel.
2016-10-19 10:47:31	ktao	las: if you load something like lv2 unisono into a track but in a vst form and duplicate ch1 to ch2 and then you load a sampler into the chain of the same track and load sfs into ch 1 and ch2 and try to play, only ch1 will be played
2016-10-19 10:48:03	ktao	i solved that via carla-vst
2016-10-19 10:48:17	ktao	within carla vst you may have 16 chs
2016-10-19 10:48:53	ktao	and duplicate and do other midi operations but the track still has only ch1 and will work with the midi keyboard via that ch1

2016-10-19 10:52:14	ktao	so i wonder if there is a way to inplement a bus and have the sampler in 1 track or bus. Maybe it can be possible via some special vst if tracks can send midi messages we can add some additional midi event as a marker of a separate track and another vst will recognize those markers and assigns chs 2-16 to those notes
2016-10-19 10:56:33	ktao	Bollie: any ideas?

2016-10-19 13:35:09	Bitrunner	isn't there a way to open a project without connecting to an audio Backend?
2016-10-19 13:36:47	avlinux	Bitrunner, Can you use another Audio device? ie on onboard sound card or something?
2016-10-19 13:36:48	las	Bitrunner, why would that be possible?
2016-10-19 13:36:57	las	Bitrunner, lets figure out the problem
2016-10-19 13:37:04	las	Bitrunner, use pastebin to show the actual error output
2016-10-19 13:39:24	Bitrunner	Hmmm last message is ERROR: JACK: cannot continue execution of the processing graph (Daten�bergabe unterbrochen (broken pipe))
2016-10-19 13:39:27	Bitrunner	ERROR: JACK: graph error - calling shutdown handler
2016-10-19 13:39:52	Bitrunner	before, there are hundreds of "ERROR: JACK: cannot read server event (Erfolg)

2016-10-19 13:41:22	Bitrunner	Is there a way to double-check the project file? Some kind of validator?
2016-10-19 13:41:22	tom-	sound like wrong sampling rate or so
2016-10-19 13:41:34	las	Bitrunner, it has nothing to do with the session
2016-10-19 13:41:36	rgareus	Bitrunner: can you run ardour from the commandline?  there may be some more elaborate message.
2016-10-19 13:41:40	Bitrunner	tom-: 48 kHz should be correct fot the project

2016-10-19 13:42:33	Bitrunner	I think jackd is crashing because of "graph Error" (whatever that means, looks like some problem with patching between plugins?)
2016-10-19 13:42:42	Bitrunner	and then ardour says "no jackd - no work". 
2016-10-19 13:42:49	Bitrunner	and ALSA Backend seems not to work here
2016-10-19 13:43:28	rgareus	Bitrunner: maybe jack is still running (hence ALSA cannot start)?
2016-10-19 13:44:00	rgareus	Bitrunner: when opening the session:  try  "Safe mode: disable all plugins"  maybe
2016-10-19 13:44:17	Bitrunner	rgareus: no jackd process, maybe some pulseaudio crap I could not stop without stopping my X11 Session
2016-10-19 13:44:31	rgareus	Bitrunner: ardour's alsa backend should ask pulse to release the device
2016-10-19 13:44:37	Bitrunner	ah "safe mode" opens and complains about 2 unavailable plugins on the system
2016-10-19 13:45:11	Bitrunner	rgareus: ALSA backend gives dialog box "Konnte Audioger�t nicht �ffnen" (means: could not open Audio device)
2016-10-19 13:45:23	rgareus	ja, ich verstehe Deutsch :)
2016-10-19 13:45:25	rgareus	danke
2016-10-19 13:45:30	Bitrunner	ah kok
2016-10-19 13:45:32	Bitrunner	ok
2016-10-19 13:45:35	rgareus	Bitrunner: in any case, the issue is most likely plugin related.
2016-10-19 13:46:08	rgareus	Bitrunner: make a backup of the session (file).   launch with safe-mode,  remove some plugins,  save.  retry  without safe-mode...
2016-10-19 13:46:12	rgareus	until you find the culprit
2016-10-19 13:46:18	Bitrunner	Hmm
2016-10-19 13:46:54	avlinux	Bitrunner, Just curious, are you using Guitarix Amplifier-X?

2016-10-19 13:47:53	rgareus	well, you could also      sudo chmod 0 /usr/lib/lv2/SOMEPLUGINS.lv2   to check
2016-10-19 13:48:06	avlinux	Bitrunner, Ok, never mind..
2016-10-19 13:48:20	Bitrunner	Ah safe mode says "graph error" as well but then opens the project complaining about missing calf 5 Band eq and calf gate then
2016-10-19 13:49:03	rgareus	BSE
2016-10-19 13:49:27	rgareus	Bitrunner: "graph error" is odd though. 
2016-10-19 13:49:58	Bitrunner	Hmm second try . "graph "ERror" - "cannot open projec" - and back to open Project dialog
2016-10-19 13:50:16	rgareus	maybe a duplicate installation of jack?  or jack is running out of ports..
2016-10-19 13:50:40	rgareus	Bitrunner: which version of ardour is that? 
2016-10-19 13:50:40	Bitrunner	hmmm

2016-10-19 14:34:39	rhydermike	[00:21:52] ah [00:21:52]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	rhydermike	[00:23:01] Be ironic if a new style of music emerged that omited the kick drum on the 1 beat due to that bug. [00:23:01]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Stuzz	[00:29:38] There's no shortage of styles that do that (and everything else) already [00:29:38]

2016-10-19 14:41:43	las	rhydermike, that would be called "good music" :)
2016-10-19 14:41:53	las	rhydermike, all good music has the emphasis on the 2 and the 4
2016-10-19 14:42:01	las	rhydermike, all bad music has the emphasis on the 1 and the 2

2016-10-19 15:07:11	las	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD3iaURppQw
2016-10-19 15:07:38	las	but yes, almost any music with a real groove has the emphasis on the 2 and the 4
2016-10-19 15:07:49	las	some surf music is an exception
2016-10-19 15:08:04	rgareus	Stuzz: try 1+, 3+, 4
