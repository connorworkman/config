2016-10-17 12:54:37	Somethis	rgareus: checking ...
2016-10-17 12:54:57	Somethis	Ardour 4.6.0

2016-10-17 12:55:13	Somethis	... oops, multiline
2016-10-17 12:55:43	rgareus	most likely issue is that some external files are missing
2016-10-17 12:55:55	rgareus	next likeley: disk full.

2016-10-17 12:57:52	Somethis	rgareus: ok ... unchecking that
2016-10-17 12:58:14	rgareus	Somethis: maybe you're used "external" files (not copied into session-dir) and those files are no longer available.
2016-10-17 13:00:54	Somethis	rgareus: looks good so far ... no error message ... I'm manually checking the files.

2016-10-17 13:09:57	the_CLA	But I guess the proper solution would be if the user cleaned up the session first, so that there are no files missing anymore. ;)

2016-10-17 13:37:08	Somethis	something along the line of autotune for guitars :-D
2016-10-17 13:37:08		[13:37]

2016-10-17 13:39:18	Bitrunner	"E" is too low for a Telecaster. Try an "e" ;)
2016-10-17 13:39:27	Somethis	turns out, it's the volume knob

2016-10-17 13:40:55	Bitrunner	but reading manuals is "out" these days I think
2016-10-17 13:41:38	ristic	Melodyne can change particualr notes in a guitar chord.
2016-10-17 13:41:45	ristic	Turn a G into a Gm for example.
2016-10-17 13:43:05	Somethis	Melodyne was really impressive ... five years back, already
2016-10-17 13:44:02	Bitrunner	ristic: the point is, the plugin would have to know that "Gm" instead of "G" is right that time
2016-10-17 13:44:44	Bitrunner	and /dev/crystal_ball is dysfunctional even on newest Linux Kernels :-(
2016-10-17 13:44:54	Somethis	would work ... unless it's Jazz or an REM song.
2016-10-17 13:45:05	Bitrunner	or may be some modern avant garde composition
2016-10-17 13:47:07	Bitrunner	ok, you never need that plugin for Free Jazz by Definition ;)

2016-10-17 13:52:25	rgareus	I suppose "a remove all missing files from session" option or something could be added

2016-10-17 14:02:13	Somethis	I presume "dead" is a folder full of intentionally deleted files?
2016-10-17 14:03:23	the_CLA	O.o
2016-10-17 14:04:16	the_CLA	Well, it's the place where session cleanup copies the files first. Just confusing that the save as function tries to copy anything from there.

2016-10-17 14:11:27	the_CLA	I guess before trying to debug things you should update to the latest release to see if the issues still exist.

2016-10-17 21:03:36	Bitrunner	[23:44:44] and /dev/crystal_ball is dysfunctional even on newest Linux Kernels :-( [23:44:44]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[23:44:54] would work ... unless it's Jazz or an REM song. [23:44:54]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Bitrunner	[23:45:05] or may be some modern avant garde composition [23:45:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Bitrunner	[23:47:07] ok, you never need that plugin for Free Jazz by Definition ;) [23:47:07]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[23:49:47] rgareus: ... I just reopened the project and am getting a brand new "Ardour cannot find the audio file ..." dialogue ... [23:49:47]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[23:50:16] rgareus: would it help if I document what happens? [23:50:16]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	rgareus	[23:51:03] Somethis: not really. if external files are removed, there's not much we can do. [23:51:03]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[23:51:50] rgareus: mhmm, yes that makes sense. I didn't (re)move any files, though. [23:51:50]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	rgareus	[23:52:25] I suppose "a remove all missing files from session" option or something could be added [23:52:25]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[23:52:38] ok, it's a file in a subfolder called *interchange* [23:52:38]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	rgareus	[23:53:03] mmh. that's inside of the session-dir [23:53:03]

2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[23:56:58] The file's not there (and neither a similar one) ... strange. [23:56:58]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	the_CLA	[23:59:52] Somethis: Is that the original session or the saved-as one? [23:59:52]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:00:36] the_CLA: that's the saved as one ... I'm checking the logfile for entries of the missing file. [00:00:36]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:01:24] the_CLA: ok ... the last entry reads ... [INFO]: attempting to copy /home/gemini/Desktop/Files/Media/Music Composition/20160923-GoodbyeBrigitte_Backup09/dead/Vocals Temp-1.wav to /home/gemini/Desktop/Files/Media/Music Composition/20171018-GoodbyeBrigitte/dead/Vocals Temp-1.wav [00:01:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:02:13] I presume "dead" is a folder full of intentionally deleted files? [00:02:13]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	the_CLA	[00:03:22] O.o [00:03:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	the_CLA	[00:04:16] Well, it's the place where session cleanup copies the files first. Just confusing that the save as function tries to copy anything from there. [00:04:16]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:06:36] the_CLA: and Ardour looks for the file in /interchange .. on restart [00:06:36]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:08:40] any suggestions ... last time "Skip all missing files" crashed Ardour. [00:08:40]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	the_CLA	[00:10:02] Somethis: No idea. I think there were also some changes to "save as" after 4.6 - but not sure if those matter in that case. [00:10:02]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:10:27] the_CLA: ok, thanks, though. [00:10:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	the_CLA	[00:11:27] I guess before trying to debug things you should update to the latest release to see if the issues still exist. [00:11:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	Somethis	[00:11:39] yup ... [00:11:39]
2016-10-17 21:03:36	the_CLA	[00:11:55] Anyway. Time to get some sleep for me! [00:11:55]

2016-10-18 00:14:23	rgareus	[23:52:25] I suppose "a remove all missing files from session" option or something could be added [23:52:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[23:52:38] ok, it's a file in a subfolder called *interchange* [23:52:38]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	rgareus	[23:53:03] mmh. that's inside of the session-dir [23:53:03]

2016-10-18 00:14:23	LAbot	[23:54:52] Title: Saving to a new Session in Ardour - Album on Imgur (at imgur.com) [23:54:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[23:54:57] step 4 ... [23:54:57]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[23:55:27] checking if that file exists [23:55:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[23:56:58] The file's not there (and neither a similar one) ... strange. [23:56:58]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	the_CLA	[23:59:52] Somethis: Is that the original session or the saved-as one? [23:59:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:00:36] the_CLA: that's the saved as one ... I'm checking the logfile for entries of the missing file. [00:00:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:01:24] the_CLA: ok ... the last entry reads ... [INFO]: attempting to copy /home/gemini/Desktop/Files/Media/Music Composition/20160923-GoodbyeBrigitte_Backup09/dead/Vocals Temp-1.wav to /home/gemini/Desktop/Files/Media/Music Composition/20171018-GoodbyeBrigitte/dead/Vocals Temp-1.wav [00:01:24]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:02:13] I presume "dead" is a folder full of intentionally deleted files? [00:02:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	the_CLA	[00:03:22] O.o [00:03:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	the_CLA	[00:04:16] Well, it's the place where session cleanup copies the files first. Just confusing that the save as function tries to copy anything from there. [00:04:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:06:36] the_CLA: and Ardour looks for the file in /interchange .. on restart [00:06:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:08:40] any suggestions ... last time "Skip all missing files" crashed Ardour. [00:08:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	the_CLA	[00:10:02] Somethis: No idea. I think there were also some changes to "save as" after 4.6 - but not sure if those matter in that case. [00:10:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:10:27] the_CLA: ok, thanks, though. [00:10:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	the_CLA	[00:11:27] I guess before trying to debug things you should update to the latest release to see if the issues still exist. [00:11:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:11:39] yup ... [00:11:39]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	the_CLA	[00:11:55] Anyway. Time to get some sleep for me! [00:11:55]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:13:25] the_CLA: good night ;-) [00:13:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Somethis	[00:13:35] same here, mhmpf [00:13:35]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[02:39:54] rgareus: the vamp_audio_to_midi script. if I'm reading it right it wants ONE audio region and ONE midi region the same size to hold output? How to create the empty midi region? (It's not obvious. I had a  couple ideas I tried that didn't work) [02:39:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[02:55:28] nstewart, what did you try? [02:55:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[03:55:45] one thing I tried was creating markers at the ends of the audio region, then try to create a region in the midi track, but without content, I can't seem to do region operations [03:55:45]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[03:57:30] paas44 (I think it was) and myself scratched our heads a bit and came up with some ideas which I don't recall but were unsuccessful [03:57:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:02:50] nstewart, creating a region always requires having a source [04:02:50]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:03:04] nstewart, so you'd need an SMFSource to get started [04:03:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[04:06:32] I don't see that it knows about anything higher than a midi region.  [04:06:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:12:11] nstewart, reviewing the lua bindings, what you need isn't there [04:12:11]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[04:12:27] so the track already IS an SMF  on disk? [04:12:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:12:49] nstewart, don't get the levels confused [04:12:49]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:13:17] nstewart, the only thing that knows about files on disk are diskstreams (hidden component in a Track) and regions [04:13:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:13:33] nstewart, for playback purposes, a track is just a playlist; no sources [04:13:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:13:47] nstewart, for recording purposes, a track is a diskstream, and it has 1 or more sources to write to [04:13:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[04:13:56] if I can figure out what is needed I'll take a stab at it. But I have to drop.  [04:13:56]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:14:12] nstewart, regions are the main thing that reference sources because they are the objects that actually read data from them [04:14:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:14:28] rgareus, there's no constructor for a MIDI region [04:14:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:15:13] nstewart, ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ [04:15:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	las_	[04:15:17] rgareus, sorry, not for you [04:15:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	nstewart	[04:21:02] is there a Region constructor for that matter? Didn't see it. I thought I recalled something in one of the docs or examples that there was a reason - like you shouldn't create them directly. but I'm foggy  [04:21:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	cglocke	[08:35:28] good morning! [08:35:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	cglocke	[08:36:16] any plugin recommendations for frequency "sweeping"? I want to start at a specific freq and increase or decrease the frequency over time until another freq is reached (e.g. to create a simple siren)...  [08:36:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	rgareus	[08:38:07] cglocke: you could automate invada's test-tone generator -- but I don't know if it's a smooth ramp. [08:38:07]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	cglocke	[08:41:17] ok thx, I'll try that :) [08:41:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	cglocke	[08:47:59] rgareus... any tip on atomation btw? :D [08:47:59]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	cglocke	[08:48:02] *automation [08:48:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	cglocke	[08:53:55] ah xD found it :) [08:53:55]

2016-10-18 04:14:09	nstewart	rgareus: had some questions about the _vamp_audio_to_midi plugin. It seems to want ONE audio region and ONE MIDI region (presumably the same size, but empty to hold the output.) I haven't been able to figure out how to create an empty midi region, and it doesn't appear that I can create one in the script. 
2016-10-18 04:14:27	nstewart	I know constructors aren't exported, but I wasn't sure how to create it looking at the bindings.
2016-10-18 04:15:28	nstewart	If the tracks are selected instead, it makes it simpler to decide where to put it I suppose. But you can't currently select one region and one track. They must be like things
2016-10-18 04:15:28		[04:15]

2016-10-18 05:18:08	IOhannes	including en (even though it doesn't do anything)
2016-10-18 05:18:43	IOhannes	i could have also just fixed the english "translation", but i think it better to just remove all occurences of the spelling error.

2016-10-18 11:45:36	rgareus	and apart from that.. it does not fit in 1920px in width :)  http://robin.linuxaudio.org/tmp/funny_midi.png

2016-10-18 11:46:45	rgareus	aah I've switched forth and back a couple of times..  it kept adding table headers

2016-10-18 11:55:32	jpt9	Is there any way to have Ardour play audio files you've imported at a different sample rate (i.e. changing both tempo/pitch), similar to changing the sample rate for a track in Audacity?
2016-10-18 11:55:59	rgareus	jpt9: there's a time-stretch tool
2016-10-18 11:56:41	rgareus	but that preserves pitch
2016-10-18 11:57:20	rgareus	the only other option is vari-speed playback -- but that's the complete session.

2016-10-18 11:58:56	jpt9	rgareus: Actually, in the list of resample methods, it's got an option for just resampling without preserving pitch.
2016-10-18 11:58:56		[11:58]
2016-10-18 11:59:44	rgareus	las: and incorrect function name on my part.

2016-10-18 12:00:14	the_CLA_2	rgareus: Doesn't the timestretch tool also have a mode that varies the pitch... I seem to remember that this had been added at some point.
2016-10-18 12:01:11	las	rgareus: should be fixed now

2016-10-18 12:05:39	las	Defcronyke: that if *their* "standard" wins, they will make a fortune on licensing fees

2016-10-18 12:12:22	rgareus	for the case at hand (auto-configure plugin chain) you also need _very_ detailed knowledge about the blocks. e.g. "How does this EQ affect signal phase depending on <parameters>"
2016-10-18 12:14:01	rgareus	I don't see auto-config happen with a random set of plugins.  they'll all come from one maker. and the  tool that does the analysis is trained (neural network) and optimized (heuristics) for the given set of plugins.
