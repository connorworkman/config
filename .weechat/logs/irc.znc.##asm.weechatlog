2016-09-17 11:04:52	ploupz	[20:44:47] it's not really difficult i think i just need to decode the stream edit it, and then encode it [20:44:47]
2016-09-17 11:04:52	ploupz	[20:45:03] boru ghostscript is only for manual editting ? [20:45:03]
2016-09-17 11:04:52	ploupz	[20:45:27] meaning it can't take  parameter ? [20:45:27]

2016-09-17 12:27:17	Jester01	movsd doesn't take an immediate, it take an address
2016-09-17 12:27:36	slavking	hmm
2016-09-17 12:27:49	slavking	so i have to change .float to .double
2016-09-17 12:27:58	Jester01	yes
2016-09-17 12:28:14	slavking	  movsd $(output), %xmm0
2016-09-17 12:28:18	slavking	so it takes

2016-09-17 12:28:30	slavking	oh
2016-09-17 12:28:33	slavking	no brackets?
2016-09-17 12:28:35	AverageJ0e	what is this linux shit?
2016-09-17 12:28:38	slavking	XD
2016-09-17 12:28:40	Jester01	no brackets
2016-09-17 12:28:52	Jester01	but you can use them if you like confusing things
2016-09-17 12:29:00	Jester01	the important thing is no $
2016-09-17 12:29:34	Jester01	also, do not use exit syscall if you use libc ... just return from main, or call exit
2016-09-17 12:29:54	slavking	what will happen if I use syscall exit?
2016-09-17 12:30:17	Jester01	the C library will have no chance to uninitialize properly
2016-09-17 12:30:26	Jester01	stuff may be left in buffers and such
2016-09-17 12:30:38	slavking	assembly is hard
2016-09-17 12:30:41	Jester01	furthermore you will probably get a nice big segfault because you don't use proper stack alignment
2016-09-17 12:30:42	slavking	;_____________;
2016-09-17 12:30:49	AverageJ0e	just ret twice, its faster than exit syscall
2016-09-17 12:30:56	slavking	retq
2016-09-17 12:31:09	slavking	I have the compiler thingy output down
2016-09-17 12:31:11	Jester01	you can even jmp printf :)
2016-09-17 12:31:29	Jester01	that will have the additional side effect of fixing the stack alignment
2016-09-17 12:31:37	AverageJ0e	yep
2016-09-17 12:32:49	Jester01	duh
2016-09-17 12:32:58	Jester01	you also messed up pi and output
2016-09-17 12:33:01	slavking	yes
2016-09-17 12:33:07	slavking	how do I compile this?
2016-09-17 12:33:16	Jester01	gcc foo.s
2016-09-17 12:33:17	slavking	as file.S -o out ?
2016-09-17 12:33:23	slavking	yeah I need gcc
2016-09-17 12:33:26	slavking	cause of library calls?
2016-09-17 12:33:29	Jester01	yes
2016-09-17 12:33:48	slavking	I dun geddit
2016-09-17 12:33:53	slavking	how do I use .data
2016-09-17 12:34:06	Jester01	looks okay
2016-09-17 12:34:10	Jester01	what's wrong with .data
2016-09-17 12:34:10	slavking	movsd output,%xmm0
2016-09-17 12:34:18	Jester01	no, you want movsd pi, %xmm0
2016-09-17 12:34:21	slavking	yeah
2016-09-17 12:34:28	slavking	xmm0 is a floating point register
2016-09-17 12:34:35	Jester01	and movq $output, %rsi

2016-09-17 12:34:58	Jester01	if you want to keep it confusing, yes.
2016-09-17 12:35:24	slavking	i don't need addrpi

2016-09-17 12:46:05	slavking	yeah
2016-09-17 12:46:21	slavking	but if I were to use it, I'd have to supply the count?

2016-09-17 13:31:02	damien	alright! thanks :)

2016-09-17 14:33:50	damien	[23:29:11] from my understanding pusha will push eax ecx edx ebx esp ebp esi edi, correct? [23:29:11]

2016-09-17 14:33:50	damien	[23:30:34] so there isn't any chance of the assembler just pushing ax cx dx... ? [23:30:34]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	Jester01	[23:30:42] none. [23:30:42]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	damien	[23:31:02] alright! thanks :) [23:31:02]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	Jester01	[23:31:40] about as much as turning add eax, 8 into inc eax repeated 8 times :) [23:31:40]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	Jester01	[23:31:52] you said pusha, you get pusha. [23:31:52]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	damien	[23:32:15] lmao awesome [23:32:15]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	Jester01	[23:32:19] anyway, that's easy to verify with a listing or disassembly if you are worried (but the well known assemblers work properly) [23:32:19]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	damien	[23:34:46] Jester01: damn, I've spent a lot of time on debuging this asm -> c call interface.. I should use a disassembler.. that would simplify my life a bit [23:34:46]

2016-09-18 01:23:05	guillaumus	hello, i would like write asm to risc processor, i must use one assembly language than other ? thank's
2016-09-18 01:24:29	guillaumus	i'm not say about syntax intel or AT&T, is not the probleme, isn't ?
2016-09-18 01:24:50	archivist	can you translate that to english
2016-09-18 01:24:51	guillaumus	talk about *
2016-09-18 01:25:00	guillaumus	xD
2016-09-18 01:25:19	guillaumus	ok, i use google translate, one moment pliz
2016-09-18 01:25:43	archivist	"asm to risc processor" to you mean an assembler

2016-09-18 01:26:58	guillaumus	Is there a difference for programming a CISC or RISC processor? Or syntax (so intel or AT & T) are identical but the instructions are simply different?
2016-09-18 01:27:53	archivist	syntax and risc/cisc are completely different concepts
2016-09-18 01:28:12	archivist	you cannot merge them in one question
2016-09-18 01:28:17	guillaumus	yes
2016-09-18 01:28:31	guillaumus	i don't care about syntax
2016-09-18 01:28:50	guillaumus	if i would like write to risc, wich language a must use ?
2016-09-18 01:29:22	archivist	I do, I use the syntax the processor maker designed for their chip
2016-09-18 01:30:24	archivist	language also is a separate concept
2016-09-18 01:32:39	guillaumus	yes, it's same like humain language, the idea are identical, but the word change
2016-09-18 01:33:10	guillaumus	i can use intel or at&t or ... i can write for cisc or risc ?
2016-09-18 01:33:37	guillaumus	but, sur, the mnemonique ou instruction are différent
2016-09-18 01:33:57	archivist	you are confusing concepts in the same question
2016-09-18 01:34:21	guillaumus	yes, syntax, and word is not same
2016-09-18 01:34:59	archivist	syntax depends on assembler used, risc/cisc depends on architecture
2016-09-18 01:35:56	guillaumus	yes, i would like write for risc processor. I anderstand, it's a reduce instruction ? i hope they a re standart and very srict minimum instruction ?
2016-09-18 01:36:41	archivist	the instructions are defined by the maker of the chip,
2016-09-18 01:36:41		[01:36]
2016-09-18 01:36:46	guillaumus	maybe load, store, jmp, add/sub ?
2016-09-18 01:36:52	guillaumus	aaaa
2016-09-18 01:37:07	archivist	you read the chips instruction set manual
2016-09-18 01:37:37	guillaumus	okay !
2016-09-18 01:37:38	guillaumus	a damn, there would not be a common language that could be found among all risc architectures?
2016-09-18 01:38:14	archivist	no
2016-09-18 01:38:55	archivist	there will be some common instructions on ARM chips
2016-09-18 01:39:31	guillaumus	I thought wrong, I hoped to find simple language like a little lisp. Mas for processor. You see ?
2016-09-18 01:42:42	guillaumus	Perfect, archivist :) i go "RTFM" arm chip :)
2016-09-18 01:42:58	guillaumus	thank's

2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:27:53] syntax and risc/cisc are completely different concepts [11:27:53]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:28:12] you cannot merge them in one question [11:28:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:28:17] yes [11:28:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:28:31] i don't care about syntax [11:28:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:28:50] if i would like write to risc, wich language a must use ? [11:28:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:29:22] I do, I use the syntax the processor maker designed for their chip [11:29:22]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:30:24] language also is a separate concept [11:30:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:32:39] yes, it's same like humain language, the idea are identical, but the word change [11:32:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:33:10] i can use intel or at&t or ... i can write for cisc or risc ? [11:33:10]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:33:37] but, sur, the mnemonique ou instruction are différent [11:33:37]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:33:57] you are confusing concepts in the same question [11:33:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:34:21] yes, syntax, and word is not same [11:34:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:34:59] syntax depends on assembler used, risc/cisc depends on architecture [11:34:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:35:56] yes, i would like write for risc processor. I anderstand, it's a reduce instruction ? i hope they a re standart and very srict minimum instruction ? [11:35:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:36:41] the instructions are defined by the maker of the chip, [11:36:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:36:46] maybe load, store, jmp, add/sub ? [11:36:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:36:52] aaaa [11:36:52]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:37:07] you read the chips instruction set manual [11:37:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:37:37] okay ! [11:37:37]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:37:38] a damn, there would not be a common language that could be found among all risc architectures? [11:37:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:38:14] no [11:38:14]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:38:55] there will be some common instructions on ARM chips [11:38:55]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:39:31] I thought wrong, I hoped to find simple language like a little lisp. Mas for processor. You see ? [11:39:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:42:42] Perfect, archivist :) i go "RTFM" arm chip :) [11:42:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:42:58] thank's [11:42:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	roxfan	[12:26:10] many renesas chips use very similar syntax [12:26:10]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[17:39:46] http://paste.debian.net/828075/ <-- What's the purpose of the lock orl here? [17:39:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[17:40:08] (this is from musl's code) [17:40:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:46:34] It's a barrier: it inhibits reordering [17:46:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[17:50:46] ggole: that's not what usually is expected from atomic store, right? it's just that musl wants it to be done this way, right? [17:50:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:54:58] Well, that's the top of the stack: the operation isn't atomic in order to protect against other threads writing to the location. [17:54:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:55:16] The only purpose is for the effect on ordering of loads and stores. [17:55:16]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:56:57] Basically it's being used as a cheaper version of mfence. [17:56:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[17:57:02] ggole: why choose rsp specifically? [17:57:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[17:57:44] err.. yeah, that's the register that's guaranteed to point to a valid memory location, right? [17:57:44]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:57:49] Yeah [17:57:49]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:58:00] You're also pretty much guaranteed to have no contention there [17:58:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	roxfan	[17:58:16] btw you could ask for the specific reason in #musl [17:58:16]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[17:58:42] ggole: i see. since each thread has its own stack. [17:58:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:59:17] This might be an interesting read http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4232660/which-is-a-better-write-barrier-on-x86-lockaddl-or-xchgl [17:59:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[18:06:04] ggole: so lock; addl ... (or orl)   is more efficient than an sfence? then why provide sfence? [18:06:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[18:07:16] I'm not sure really why the semantics are that way. [18:07:16]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[18:12:55] i suppose the designers just wanted an explicit way to do this - so that in some way more efficiency could be gained (referring to the answer describing the hotspot devs) [18:12:55]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[18:13:18] "on some processors it can introduce false data dependencies" [18:13:18]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[18:18:14] There may be other uses, for things like streaming stores and writes to write-combined memory. [18:18:14]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[18:18:22] I'm not familiar with those details. [18:18:22]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[18:20:08] i see. idk about write-combined memory [18:20:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[18:23:32] ggole: am i right in saying - sfence should be better that lock; addl ... if you really want a write barrier, since lock; addl... serializes both reads and writes, which is like an mfence ? [18:23:32]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[19:05:26] snyp: maybe. Of course, I don't know which semantics the musl code required. [19:05:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[19:05:53] ggole: i see. [19:05:53]

2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:30:24] language also is a separate concept [11:30:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:32:39] yes, it's same like humain language, the idea are identical, but the word change [11:32:39]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:33:10] i can use intel or at&t or ... i can write for cisc or risc ? [11:33:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:33:37] but, sur, the mnemonique ou instruction are différent [11:33:37]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:33:57] you are confusing concepts in the same question [11:33:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:34:21] yes, syntax, and word is not same [11:34:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:34:59] syntax depends on assembler used, risc/cisc depends on architecture [11:34:59]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:35:56] yes, i would like write for risc processor. I anderstand, it's a reduce instruction ? i hope they a re standart and very srict minimum instruction ? [11:35:56]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:36:41] the instructions are defined by the maker of the chip, [11:36:41]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:36:46] maybe load, store, jmp, add/sub ? [11:36:46]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:36:52] aaaa [11:36:52]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:37:07] you read the chips instruction set manual [11:37:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:37:37] okay ! [11:37:37]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:37:38] a damn, there would not be a common language that could be found among all risc architectures? [11:37:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:38:14] no [11:38:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:38:55] there will be some common instructions on ARM chips [11:38:55]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:39:31] I thought wrong, I hoped to find simple language like a little lisp. Mas for processor. You see ? [11:39:31]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:42:42] Perfect, archivist :) i go "RTFM" arm chip :) [11:42:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:42:58] thank's [11:42:58]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	roxfan	[12:26:10] many renesas chips use very similar syntax [12:26:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[17:39:46] http://paste.debian.net/828075/ <-- What's the purpose of the lock orl here? [17:39:46]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[17:40:08] (this is from musl's code) [17:40:08]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:46:34] It's a barrier: it inhibits reordering [17:46:34]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[17:50:46] ggole: that's not what usually is expected from atomic store, right? it's just that musl wants it to be done this way, right? [17:50:46]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:54:58] Well, that's the top of the stack: the operation isn't atomic in order to protect against other threads writing to the location. [17:54:58]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:55:16] The only purpose is for the effect on ordering of loads and stores. [17:55:16]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:56:57] Basically it's being used as a cheaper version of mfence. [17:56:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[17:57:02] ggole: why choose rsp specifically? [17:57:02]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[17:57:44] err.. yeah, that's the register that's guaranteed to point to a valid memory location, right? [17:57:44]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:57:49] Yeah [17:57:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:58:00] You're also pretty much guaranteed to have no contention there [17:58:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	roxfan	[17:58:16] btw you could ask for the specific reason in #musl [17:58:16]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[17:58:42] ggole: i see. since each thread has its own stack. [17:58:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:59:17] This might be an interesting read http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4232660/which-is-a-better-write-barrier-on-x86-lockaddl-or-xchgl [17:59:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[18:06:04] ggole: so lock; addl ... (or orl)   is more efficient than an sfence? then why provide sfence? [18:06:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[18:07:16] I'm not sure really why the semantics are that way. [18:07:16]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[18:12:55] i suppose the designers just wanted an explicit way to do this - so that in some way more efficiency could be gained (referring to the answer describing the hotspot devs) [18:12:55]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[18:13:18] "on some processors it can introduce false data dependencies" [18:13:18]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[18:18:14] There may be other uses, for things like streaming stores and writes to write-combined memory. [18:18:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[18:18:22] I'm not familiar with those details. [18:18:22]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[18:20:08] i see. idk about write-combined memory [18:20:08]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[18:23:32] ggole: am i right in saying - sfence should be better that lock; addl ... if you really want a write barrier, since lock; addl... serializes both reads and writes, which is like an mfence ? [18:23:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[19:05:26] snyp: maybe. Of course, I don't know which semantics the musl code required. [19:05:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[19:05:53] ggole: i see. [19:05:53]

2016-09-19 02:43:41	guillaumus	[11:33:37] but, sur, the mnemonique ou instruction are différent [11:33:37]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	archivist	[11:33:57] you are confusing concepts in the same question [11:33:57]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	guillaumus	[11:34:21] yes, syntax, and word is not same [11:34:21]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	archivist	[11:34:59] syntax depends on assembler used, risc/cisc depends on architecture [11:34:59]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	guillaumus	[11:35:56] yes, i would like write for risc processor. I anderstand, it's a reduce instruction ? i hope they a re standart and very srict minimum instruction ? [11:35:56]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	archivist	[11:36:41] the instructions are defined by the maker of the chip, [11:36:41]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	guillaumus	[11:36:46] maybe load, store, jmp, add/sub ? [11:36:46]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	guillaumus	[11:36:52] aaaa [11:36:52]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	archivist	[11:37:07] you read the chips instruction set manual [11:37:07]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	guillaumus	[11:37:37] okay ! [11:37:37]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	guillaumus	[11:37:38] a damn, there would not be a common language that could be found among all risc architectures? [11:37:38]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	archivist	[11:38:14] no [11:38:14]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	archivist	[11:38:55] there will be some common instructions on ARM chips [11:38:55]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	guillaumus	[11:39:31] I thought wrong, I hoped to find simple language like a little lisp. Mas for processor. You see ? [11:39:31]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	guillaumus	[11:42:42] Perfect, archivist :) i go "RTFM" arm chip :) [11:42:42]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	guillaumus	[11:42:58] thank's [11:42:58]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	roxfan	[12:26:10] many renesas chips use very similar syntax [12:26:10]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[17:39:46] http://paste.debian.net/828075/ <-- What's the purpose of the lock orl here? [17:39:46]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[17:40:08] (this is from musl's code) [17:40:08]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[17:46:34] It's a barrier: it inhibits reordering [17:46:34]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[17:50:46] ggole: that's not what usually is expected from atomic store, right? it's just that musl wants it to be done this way, right? [17:50:46]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[17:54:58] Well, that's the top of the stack: the operation isn't atomic in order to protect against other threads writing to the location. [17:54:58]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[17:55:16] The only purpose is for the effect on ordering of loads and stores. [17:55:16]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[17:56:57] Basically it's being used as a cheaper version of mfence. [17:56:57]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[17:57:02] ggole: why choose rsp specifically? [17:57:02]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[17:57:44] err.. yeah, that's the register that's guaranteed to point to a valid memory location, right? [17:57:44]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[17:57:49] Yeah [17:57:49]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[17:58:00] You're also pretty much guaranteed to have no contention there [17:58:00]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	roxfan	[17:58:16] btw you could ask for the specific reason in #musl [17:58:16]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[17:58:42] ggole: i see. since each thread has its own stack. [17:58:42]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[17:59:17] This might be an interesting read http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4232660/which-is-a-better-write-barrier-on-x86-lockaddl-or-xchgl [17:59:17]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[18:06:04] ggole: so lock; addl ... (or orl)   is more efficient than an sfence? then why provide sfence? [18:06:04]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[18:07:16] I'm not sure really why the semantics are that way. [18:07:16]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[18:12:55] i suppose the designers just wanted an explicit way to do this - so that in some way more efficiency could be gained (referring to the answer describing the hotspot devs) [18:12:55]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[18:13:18] "on some processors it can introduce false data dependencies" [18:13:18]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[18:18:14] There may be other uses, for things like streaming stores and writes to write-combined memory. [18:18:14]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[18:18:22] I'm not familiar with those details. [18:18:22]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[18:20:08] i see. idk about write-combined memory [18:20:08]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[18:23:32] ggole: am i right in saying - sfence should be better that lock; addl ... if you really want a write barrier, since lock; addl... serializes both reads and writes, which is like an mfence ? [18:23:32]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[19:05:26] snyp: maybe. Of course, I don't know which semantics the musl code required. [19:05:26]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[19:05:53] ggole: i see. [19:05:53]

2016-09-19 10:42:04	Freze	Is it appropriate to ask a question about llvm here?
2016-09-19 10:42:30	Freze	 How expensive are getelementptr inbounds instructions? e.g;   %3 = getelementptr inbounds %Dotted, %Dotted* %1, i64 0, i32 0
2016-09-19 10:42:31	Freze	<Freze_>                   %4 = load double, double* %3, align 8
2016-09-19 10:42:54	Jester01	I suppose that depends on the target architecture?
2016-09-19 10:42:57	Freze	 for example. I'm trying to decide if it's worth trying to optimize this away
2016-09-19 10:42:57	Freze	 by rewriting my program to not use %Dotted
2016-09-19 10:43:23	Freze	x86_64
2016-09-19 10:44:30	Freze	I can also paste assembly
2016-09-19 10:44:48	Freze	if necessary
2016-09-19 10:44:59	Freze	for me it's easier to understand what's going on with the llvm

2016-09-19 19:55:22	dminuoso	Hi. I've been looking in the Intel Manual Vol. 3 for a while now to find documentation on how (code/data) descriptors in the GDT must look like in IA-32e.
2016-09-19 19:55:41	dminuoso	But so far I haven't found anything.
2016-09-19 19:56:54	sophia7	dminuoso: it should bee there somewhere. Check the other manuals too? Look under memory management maybe
2016-09-19 19:58:07	sophia7	CTRL+F :p

2016-09-19 20:06:29	dminuoso	Figure 3-8 depicts an 8 byte descriptor. According to 3.5.2 the segment descriptors stay 8 byte in 64 bit mode.
2016-09-19 20:06:37	dminuoso	But if you look at figure 3-8, then the Base is only a 32 bit address.
2016-09-19 20:06:49	dminuoso	(Which usually is 0, but I would expect this to be a 64 bit address still)
2016-09-19 20:07:47	dminuoso	I simply don't understand how an 8 byte descriptor could be used in 64 bit mode.
2016-09-19 20:08:02	dminuoso	Since you would need the entire 8 bytes just to describe any possible base.
2016-09-19 20:12:24	sophia7	8 byte descriptor is not used in 64 bit mode
2016-09-19 20:12:38	sophia7	you use 16 bytes in 64-bit mode

2016-09-20 06:52:47	GGMethos	Anyone have a decent guide/tutorial/link showing differences between x86 and MIPS (from an x86 perspective)?
2016-09-20 06:52:54	GGMethos	Would be pretty useful for me :)
2016-09-20 06:56:56	vulture	GGMethos: 32 regs with generally op dst,src1,src2 form instructions. mips has only load/store memory accesses instead of being able to use memory as a parameter. only [reg+offset] form memory addressing. stack exists but nothing implicitly uses it and stack pointer needs to be modified manually as a basic register. no flags, branches generally boil down to much more simplified (e.g. a zero-test)
2016-09-20 06:56:56	vulture	comparison+branch in a single instruction. pretty difficult to use :P

2016-09-20 07:01:55	vulture	stack pointer register ($sp)
2016-09-20 07:02:39	vulture	the layout in memory you can imagine similar to x86, but there's no push/pop instruction. push is done via memory write + update $sp. and pop is done via memory read and update $sp.
2016-09-20 07:03:07	vulture	a "call" instruction writes the return address to the $ra register, which you can either hang onto or "push" to the stack or a temp reg
2016-09-20 07:03:24	vulture	call in mips is jal (jump and link)
2016-09-20 07:03:34	vulture	jr will jump register to return
2016-09-20 07:04:50	GGMethos	alright. I understand a bit more now. thanks

2016-09-20 07:13:21	OxFEEDBACC	when they have not, registers are named uniquely...

2016-09-20 07:14:13	OxFEEDBACC	but on machine code level they are addressed by numbers, nonetheless (or some bit combinations at least, that can be interpreted like numbers)

2016-09-20 08:00:51	asm127	why is it cleaning al though?
2016-09-20 08:00:52	dminuoso	asm127: you could mov $0, %%al instead, but most x86 processors handle xor reg,reg specially so that its a little faster.
2016-09-20 08:01:02	dminuoso	asm127: because xor any,any will always yield 0.

2016-09-20 13:49:43	asm065	Hi guy, I was here earlier asking about a snipet of code, and thought I understood it but realize that I still dont. So could someone help me out again. Here is the snipet. http://pastebin.com/4TpQzeKq What im confused about is why line 6 is even needed. And why there is nothing in the output feild. instead dest is put into the input one.
2016-09-20 13:50:06	Jester01	that's broken code.
2016-09-20 13:50:25	asm065	To give some background, the code takes a string. and uses the start index and end index to get a substring, which it stores into dest.
2016-09-20 13:50:32	Jester01	it will possibly blow up in mysterious ways
2016-09-20 13:50:48	asm065	Jester01: works just fine.
2016-09-20 13:50:52	Jester01	accidental.
2016-09-20 13:51:08	Jester01	it will break under circumstances
2016-09-20 13:51:33	Jester01	it will break the rest of the program, actually.
2016-09-20 13:52:06	asm065	hm, could you please expand on why this is the case
2016-09-20 13:52:17	Jester01	it's changing registers without telling the compiler
2016-09-20 13:52:47	Jester01	to make matters worse, it's changing callee-saved registers
2016-09-20 13:53:38	asm065	Where is it changing registers without telling compiler
2016-09-20 13:53:51	Jester01	movsb and stosb update esi and edi
2016-09-20 13:54:01	asm065	right
2016-09-20 13:54:03	Jester01	also rep updates ecx
2016-09-20 13:54:06	-->	SunnyD (~SunnyD@cpe-72-178-78-211.hot.res.rr.com) has joined ##asm
2016-09-20 13:54:09	asm065	mhmm
2016-09-20 13:54:16	asm065	does the compiler never know this?
2016-09-20 13:54:30	Jester01	nope, the compiler (gcc) does not analyze your asm code
2016-09-20 13:54:40	Jester01	it relies on you to tell the proper inputs, outputs and clobbers
2016-09-20 13:55:13	asm065	I thought it was weird that there were no outputs
2016-09-20 13:55:45	Jester01	that, by itself, is not weird
2016-09-20 13:56:13	asm065	how much dest is put into the input ones there?
2016-09-20 13:56:15	Jester01	obviously it's also changing memory behind the compiler
2016-09-20 13:56:36	Jester01	not sure I understand your question, dest is a pointer
2016-09-20 13:58:00	asm065	So what that code should do is take a substring from src, and store it in dest
2016-09-20 13:58:07	asm065	so shouldnt dest be in output

2016-09-20 13:59:47	Jester01	normally dest is not expected to be changed since it's a pointer
2016-09-20 13:59:58	Jester01	it's only a side effect of this particular asm code that it gets changed
2016-09-20 14:00:27	Jester01	memory pointed to by dest is expected to change, but that by itself is not cause to put it as output
2016-09-20 14:00:34	Jester01	rather, you need to put a "memory" clobber
2016-09-20 14:02:04	asm065	So is the only bad thing about this that it doesnt have clobber list?

2016-09-20 14:03:38	Jester01	yes
2016-09-20 14:03:52	asm065	why does that person clear the eax register?
2016-09-20 14:03:57	asm065	in line 6
2016-09-20 14:04:06	Jester01	to put the terminating zero at the end of the copied string.
2016-09-20 14:04:44	Jester01	could have just done mov $0, (%%edi) instead of xor+stosb
2016-09-20 14:04:49	Jester01	movb
2016-09-20 14:05:25	Jester01	that's probably faster and doesn't clobber eax :)
2016-09-20 14:06:29	Jester01	also this code is inherently unsafe, because it assumes that the source string is at least as long as required
2016-09-20 14:06:52	Jester01	for normal people a simple strncpy is fine

2016-09-20 14:08:05	asm065	i understand how mov $0, (%%edi), would add a terminating 0, but his way of doing it confuses me
2016-09-20 14:08:32	Jester01	well, you know xor zeroes, and stosb just does mov %al, (%%edi); inc %%edi
2016-09-20 14:08:43	Jester01	of course we don't care about that inc
2016-09-20 14:10:27	asm065	isnt the inc important tho?
2016-09-20 14:10:35	Jester01	nope
2016-09-20 14:10:43	Jester01	not in this case, obviously
2016-09-20 14:10:53	asm065	how come?
2016-09-20 14:10:59	Jester01	we just want the zero at the end, we don't care about the pointer being incremented afterwards
2016-09-20 14:11:06	Jester01	we are gonna throw that away
2016-09-20 14:11:46	asm065	right, i thought you were saying it wasnt important ever cuz i knw it reps it
2016-09-20 14:11:55	Jester01	the rep was for movsb only
2016-09-20 14:11:56	asm065	so it would be important at first to inc
2016-09-20 14:12:10	Jester01	and yeah, there it's obviously important
2016-09-20 14:12:25	Jester01	for the final stosb, it's not important because nothing uses it afterwards
2016-09-20 14:12:43	Jester01	it's like  doing *dest=0; dest++;  and never using dest later
2016-09-20 14:12:53	Jester01	so who cares if the ++ is there or not
2016-09-20 14:13:05	asm065	yeah
2016-09-20 14:13:11	asm065	makes sense
2016-09-20 14:14:28	asm065	so where does movsb move the stuff too?
2016-09-20 14:14:37	Jester01	from *esi to *edi
2016-09-20 14:14:46	asm065	ah okie
2016-09-20 14:15:02	asm065	and then stosb does it from edi to dest?
2016-09-20 14:16:20	Jester01	no stosb just writes al into *edi
2016-09-20 14:16:48	asm065	oh
2016-09-20 14:16:54	asm065	so thts whts storing the null?
2016-09-20 14:16:58	Jester01	yes
2016-09-20 14:17:12	asm065	interesting
2016-09-20 14:17:51	asm065	does stosb use eax by default?
2016-09-20 14:18:09	Jester01	al, yes.
2016-09-20 14:18:19	asm065	right sorry
2016-09-20 14:18:19		[14:18]
2016-09-20 14:19:12	asm065	wow youre making this very easy to understand thanks so much
2016-09-20 14:20:00	asm065	question i noticed that the count doesnt work as intended in the sense that it gives 1 iteration more than it has to
2016-09-20 14:20:12	asm065	so lets say your starting index is 2 and ending index is 3
2016-09-20 14:20:27	asm065	it copies every character in the string from index 2 to 4
2016-09-20 14:20:34	asm065	doesnt stop at 3
2016-09-20 14:20:36	asm065	why is that
2016-09-20 14:20:39	Jester01	this function takes a count argument ... how you calculate it is up to you.
2016-09-20 14:21:15	asm065	every time you movsb it inc count right?
2016-09-20 14:21:17	Jester01	there is no "ending index" here.
2016-09-20 14:21:28	asm065	sorry the ending index would be count
2016-09-20 14:21:31	Jester01	it decrements the count.
2016-09-20 14:21:38	Jester01	and no, count is not an index.
2016-09-20 14:21:47	Jester01	it's a count.
2016-09-20 14:21:55	Jester01	if it's 3, that means copy 3 bytes
2016-09-20 14:22:08	Jester01	and if the start is 2, then yes, that means copy 2,3,4
2016-09-20 14:22:22	asm065	ohhh
2016-09-20 14:23:37	asm065	wow this makes so much sense now
2016-09-20 14:23:54	asm065	so i just need to make sure i add a clobber list
2016-09-20 14:24:31	asm065	otherwise compiler will never know
2016-09-20 14:25:02	Jester01	clobber for eax, and possibly dummy output for esi and edi (some compiler versions don't allow clobber for inputs)
2016-09-20 14:25:20	Jester01	or, you know, just turn this into C :)
2016-09-20 14:26:47	asm065	Yeah it def would be easier to do this in C, but im jus trying to learn inline assembly so i thought this simple exercise would be good practice x3
2016-09-20 14:26:56	Jester01	okay :)
2016-09-20 14:27:12	Jester01	1st rule of inline asm: avoid if you can :)
2016-09-20 14:27:33	asm065	Yeah I hear that a lot xD
2016-09-20 14:27:35	Jester01	(applies to gcc inline asm more than other types)
2016-09-20 14:28:11	asm065	btw is it rly needed to add eax to clobber list if i use the mov instead or xor? i thought you said mov wouldnt clobber it
2016-09-20 14:28:28	Jester01	right, if you use the mov then you don't need to list eax
2016-09-20 14:29:36	asm065	what would be an example of a dummy output?
2016-09-20 14:29:49	asm065	just randomly add like ecx?
2016-09-20 14:29:55	Jester01	no :)
2016-09-20 14:30:27	Jester01	since your variables are local and not used, you can write the values back
2016-09-20 14:31:02	Jester01	such as "=S" (src), "=D" (dest), "=c" (count)
2016-09-20 14:31:22	Jester01	for dest and count you could use read-write constraint
2016-09-20 14:31:51	asm065	wouldnt it be better to do s_idx and count only ?

2016-09-20 14:36:26	asm065	So you're saying we load dest into edi. meaning edi now points to dest no? so when we do movsb, it moves the stuff from esi to edi. which also means dest also gets written back to no?
2016-09-20 14:36:45	Jester01	no, edi points to wherever dest pointed to
2016-09-20 14:36:51	Jester01	it does not point to dest
2016-09-20 14:36:54	Jester01	dest itself is loaded.
2016-09-20 14:36:56	Jester01	edi=dest
2016-09-20 14:37:04	asm065	yes sorry thats what i meant
2016-09-20 14:37:05	Jester01	it's not edi=&dest
2016-09-20 14:37:42	Jester01	movsb increments the pointers, and copies memory.
2016-09-20 14:37:57	Jester01	also, the compiler still has no idea that happened unless you tell it

2016-09-20 14:42:12	asm065	oh i think im begining to understand now
2016-09-20 14:42:16	asm065	okay
2016-09-20 14:42:32	Jester01	as I said, some compiler versions (maybe clang? IDK) do allow for clobbered inputs
2016-09-20 14:42:33	asm065	so i can either add edi to clobber list to let compiler know or just put it in the output
2016-09-20 14:43:00	Jester01	outputs work always, but a little more typing :)
2016-09-20 14:43:12	Jester01	clobber may or may not be accepted by your compiler
2016-09-20 14:43:21	asm065	gotcha ill do output to be safe :)

2016-09-20 14:46:10	Jester01	delete the stosb
2016-09-20 14:46:20	Jester01	and the mov should be movb

2016-09-20 14:47:49	Jester01	that was the whole point of adding it ;)

2016-09-20 14:52:28	Jester01	yes
2016-09-20 14:55:56	asm065	Jester01: how come Movsb requires a memory clobber but ordinary mov doesnt?
2016-09-20 14:56:51	Jester01	who said it didn't :)
2016-09-20 14:57:11	Jester01	if you randomly write into memory using whatever means, you need a memory clobber
2016-09-20 14:57:35	Jester01	otherwise the compiler might be caching an old value somewhere (unlikely, but can happen)
2016-09-20 14:58:42	asm065	ah that makes sense, but you said movb $0, (%%edi) doesnt require clobber is that because edi is a stack?
2016-09-20 14:59:02	Jester01	the code does not require the eax clobber if you use that instead of the xor
2016-09-20 14:59:08	Jester01	because you don't change eax

2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[00:47:54] sorry [00:47:54]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[00:48:19] direction flag must be clear at function entry, but if it isn't and you change it, all hell will break loose anyway [00:48:19]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[00:48:23] i think i jus did whts called zoned out xD [00:48:23]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[00:52:22] Jester01: Is memory clobber really just as simple as writing "memory" [00:52:22]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[00:52:27] yes [00:52:27]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[00:55:55] Jester01: how come Movsb requires a memory clobber but ordinary mov doesnt? [00:55:55]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[00:56:50] who said it didn't :) [00:56:50]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[00:57:10] if you randomly write into memory using whatever means, you need a memory clobber [00:57:10]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[00:57:34] otherwise the compiler might be caching an old value somewhere (unlikely, but can happen) [00:57:34]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[00:58:41] ah that makes sense, but you said movb $0, (%%edi) doesnt require clobber is that because edi is a stack? [00:58:41]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[00:59:01] the code does not require the eax clobber if you use that instead of the xor [00:59:01]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[00:59:07] because you don't change eax [00:59:07]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[00:59:15] oh [00:59:15]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[00:59:41] okay i now understand this [00:59:41]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[00:59:48] i should write this all down [00:59:48]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[00:59:59] it still needs the memory clobber, but you only need to list that once and so you are covered [00:59:59]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:00:26] C is starting to look more and more beautiful [01:00:26]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:06:45] seem to get a seg fault intereting [01:06:45]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:09:02] in 64 bit mode accidentally? :) [01:09:02]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:10:06] nope :o, a random part of my other code is seg faulting now even tho it worked before xD [01:10:06]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:10:26] i must have done something wrong [01:10:26]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:24:55] Jester01: Seems to seg fault at the start of the asm code also [01:24:55]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:26:03] Jester01: http://pastebin.com/bP0AD29R [01:26:03]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:26:20] that IS 64 bit mode! [01:26:20]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:26:58] change movb $0, (%%edi) to movb $0, (%%rdi) [01:26:58]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:27:26] better yet, change it to movb $0, (%1) [01:27:26]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:27:35] then it will work in 32 and 64 bit both [01:27:35]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:27:51] oh crap i forgot i was using the wrong virtual machine [01:27:51]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:29:49] by the way, the debug info for inline asm is not line accurate, you need to disasm the actual address to see the faulting instruction [01:29:49]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:31:07] could you explain the %1 [01:31:07]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:31:20] argument 1 [01:31:20]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:32:04] i thought argument 1 was src [01:32:04]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:32:13] we count from 0 ;) [01:32:13]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:32:38] ah that makes sense x3 [01:32:38]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:34:27] Jester01: Hm when i print dest in the main it comes up empty now [01:34:27]

2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:40:15] ah something is broken [01:40:15]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:40:49] you removed the volatile [01:40:49]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:41:06] whoops it works [01:41:06]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:41:09] i compild wrong one [01:41:09]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:41:17] is the volatile needed? [01:41:17]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:41:19] yes. [01:41:19]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:41:31] turn optimization on, and you'll see it's needed :) [01:41:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:42:19] Okay lemme try brb ^_^ [01:42:19]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:42:47] contrary to popular belief, I do need to sleep, so cya! :) [01:42:47]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:44:29] Jester01: Sleep well! thanks so much! <3 [01:44:29]

2016-09-20 23:22:19	yuta_	is there anyway to compile that code in gcc or i need to translate the code to intel syntax?
2016-09-20 23:23:53	boru	You can specify a flag to gcc/gas to instruct it to use intel syntax, or you can use an assembler directive in your listing.
2016-09-20 23:24:14	yuta_	do you know what flag is it?
2016-09-20 23:24:25	<--	XOCK_STREAM (~XOCKET@unaffiliated/xocket) has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
2016-09-20 23:24:46	boru	`-masm=intel` iirc. It's in the documentation.
2016-09-20 23:25:21	boru	And the directive is `.intel_syntax` or something like that. I haven't touched any intel code in a long time, so it may have changed.
2016-09-20 23:30:22	yuta_	this will work?
2016-09-20 23:30:24	yuta_		asm 	(".intel_syntax noprefix\       MOV eax, dword ptr[chatinfo]\       MOV ecx, dword ptr[eax]\       PUSH 0\       PUSH textColor\       PUSH 0\       PUSH text\       PUSH 8\       CALL func");
2016-09-20 23:31:24	archivist	try it!
2016-09-20 23:31:32	boru	You're probably better enforcing via your build system, else that code will not compile with an assembler which doesn't understand `.intel_syntax`

2016-09-21 12:41:33	GeDaMo	[15:01:21] 80 bit decimal? [15:01:21]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	slavanap	[15:02:17] looks like found one description here http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-manual-325462.pdf [15:02:17]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	slavanap	[15:02:24] GeDaMo, yes. [15:02:24]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	GeDaMo	[15:02:32] I only see m80bcd in relation to fbstp [15:02:32]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	slavanap	[15:03:43] GeDaMo, than what is m80bcd representation and limits? [15:03:43]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	GeDaMo	[15:04:20] "18-digit packed BCD integer" [15:04:20]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	GeDaMo	[15:04:51] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal#Packed_BCD [15:04:51]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	slavanap	[15:05:50] GeDaMo, I wonder about exponent representation actually. For instance, how 0.001f would look in BCD. [15:05:50]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	slavanap	[15:06:48] GeDaMo, or FBSTP just using integer part of the float? [15:06:48]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	slavanap	[15:11:02] agh. I haven't used pure asm for so long. Never setup it in MSVS2015. First time is always hard [15:11:02]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	slavanap	[15:19:36] GeDaMo, `FBSTP DWORD PTR [EAX]` fails with invalid operand size. How to define pointer to ten bytes? (simlar to DT) ? [15:19:36]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	slavanap	[15:26:39] How to day TENBYTES PTR [EAX] in MASM. What I should replace TENBYTES WITH? [15:26:39]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	slavanap	[15:32:36] FOUND IT. REAL10 PTR [15:32:36]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	slavanap	[15:34:58] GeDaMo, yes, FBSTP converts to bcd only integer part of the float. [15:34:58]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	Guest5316	[19:09:17] ? [19:09:17]

2016-09-21 12:41:33	kaos	[19:46:20] !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [19:46:20]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	AverageJ0e	[20:06:03] vulture, https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cs5zWjIUsAAxqs6.jpg [20:06:03]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	AverageJ0e	[20:06:23] see what they're doing? rdtsc, jump to self [20:06:23]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	roxfan	[20:07:39] probably detecting emulators or tracing [20:07:39]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	roxfan	[20:09:27] too many cycles between two rdtsc ->infinite loop [20:09:27]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	AverageJ0e	[20:10:57] so it turns out theres more than 1 way to jump to self in 2 bytes. I thought there was only eb fe, but theres 7f fe, 7c fe, [20:10:57]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	AverageJ0e	[20:10:59] makes sense [20:10:59]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	AverageJ0e	[20:12:39] i guess 7e would work too [20:12:39]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	AverageJ0e	[20:12:53] wheres that damn intel opcode manual when i need one? [20:12:53]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	GeDaMo	[20:13:57] http://sandpile.org/ ? [20:13:57]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	roxfan	[20:17:24] well, jg etc. only works if the flags are set up accordingly [20:17:24]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	roxfan	[20:17:40] eb fe works in any situation [20:17:40]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	kaos	[20:18:15] you mean c3 99 [20:18:15]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	AverageJ0e	[20:18:16] eb, e9, e8 [20:18:16]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	kaos	[20:18:21] 23 0e [20:18:21]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	Freze_	[20:18:41] For example take `x + 1` where x is a float is the additional instruction to convert 1 to a float `vcvtsi2sdq` [20:18:41]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Freze_	[20:18:56] expensive [20:18:56]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Freze_	[20:20:20] under -O3  I still have the additional instruction [20:20:20]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	GeDaMo	[20:21:00] Try x + 1.0 [20:21:00]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	GeDaMo	[20:21:16] Or x + 1f [20:21:16]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Freze_	[20:21:20] The question is if that's a worth optimization [20:21:20]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Freze_	[20:21:34] I.e. is the `vcvtsi2sdq`  instruction expensive enough to warrant a change? [20:21:34]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Freze_	[20:21:43] for numerics [20:21:43]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	AverageJ0e	[20:22:13] lets see...if i do a hex replace of 7f fe with 90 90, let's see if im as smart as i think i am [20:22:13]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	roxfan	[20:22:59] if it's stupid but works, it's not stupid [20:22:59]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	AverageJ0e	[20:23:35] i need that on a shirt roxfan [20:23:35]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Freze_	[20:23:36] haha I love that [20:23:36]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	roxfan	[20:25:11] AverageJ0e: zazzle or whatever [20:25:11]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	AverageJ0e	[20:45:38] the fuck is this? https://files.catbox.moe/yrl5ey.PNG [20:45:38]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	AverageJ0e	[20:46:35] loop is contingent on ecx for count, where is it set? [20:46:35]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	vulture	[21:00:59] AverageJ0e: looks like standard anti-singlestep-code [21:00:59]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	vulture	[21:01:06] on your first pic [21:01:06]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	AverageJ0e	[21:01:16] welcome [21:01:16]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	vulture	[21:01:32] ecx probably set by caller [21:01:32]

2016-09-21 19:06:58	GeDaMo	[15:04:20] "18-digit packed BCD integer" [15:04:20]

2016-09-21 19:06:58	slavanap	[15:05:50] GeDaMo, I wonder about exponent representation actually. For instance, how 0.001f would look in BCD. [15:05:50]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	slavanap	[15:06:48] GeDaMo, or FBSTP just using integer part of the float? [15:06:48]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	slavanap	[15:11:02] agh. I haven't used pure asm for so long. Never setup it in MSVS2015. First time is always hard [15:11:02]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	slavanap	[15:19:36] GeDaMo, `FBSTP DWORD PTR [EAX]` fails with invalid operand size. How to define pointer to ten bytes? (simlar to DT) ? [15:19:36]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	slavanap	[15:26:39] How to day TENBYTES PTR [EAX] in MASM. What I should replace TENBYTES WITH? [15:26:39]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	slavanap	[15:32:36] FOUND IT. REAL10 PTR [15:32:36]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	slavanap	[15:34:58] GeDaMo, yes, FBSTP converts to bcd only integer part of the float. [15:34:58]

2016-09-21 19:06:58	AverageJ0e	[20:06:23] see what they're doing? rdtsc, jump to self [20:06:23]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	roxfan	[20:07:39] probably detecting emulators or tracing [20:07:39]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	roxfan	[20:09:27] too many cycles between two rdtsc ->infinite loop [20:09:27]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	AverageJ0e	[20:10:57] so it turns out theres more than 1 way to jump to self in 2 bytes. I thought there was only eb fe, but theres 7f fe, 7c fe, [20:10:57]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	AverageJ0e	[20:10:59] makes sense [20:10:59]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	AverageJ0e	[20:12:39] i guess 7e would work too [20:12:39]

2016-09-21 19:06:58	roxfan	[20:17:24] well, jg etc. only works if the flags are set up accordingly [20:17:24]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	roxfan	[20:17:40] eb fe works in any situation [20:17:40]

2016-09-21 19:06:58	Freze_	[20:18:41] For example take `x + 1` where x is a float is the additional instruction to convert 1 to a float `vcvtsi2sdq` [20:18:41]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	Freze_	[20:18:56] expensive [20:18:56]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	Freze_	[20:20:20] under -O3  I still have the additional instruction [20:20:20]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	GeDaMo	[20:21:00] Try x + 1.0 [20:21:00]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	GeDaMo	[20:21:16] Or x + 1f [20:21:16]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	Freze_	[20:21:20] The question is if that's a worth optimization [20:21:20]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	Freze_	[20:21:34] I.e. is the `vcvtsi2sdq`  instruction expensive enough to warrant a change? [20:21:34]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	Freze_	[20:21:43] for numerics [20:21:43]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	AverageJ0e	[20:22:13] lets see...if i do a hex replace of 7f fe with 90 90, let's see if im as smart as i think i am [20:22:13]
2016-09-21 19:06:58	roxfan	[20:22:59] if it's stupid but works, it's not stupid [20:22:59]

2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:07:38] GPIO would be a lower-level interface, less can go wrong in that respect. [10:07:38]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	Affliction`	[10:08:00] GPIO is software driven too, even if you can hook a DMA engine up to it [10:08:00]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	archivist	[10:08:21] hardware can be sniffed [10:08:21]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:08:22] affliction`: yea but you make all the software yourself, it's controlled from the CPU [10:08:22]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:08:28] an ethernet chip has its own firmware and stuff [10:08:28]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:08:33] can be bugs, has DMA access [10:08:33]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:08:44] DMA GPIO would be all under control of the CPU and your code. [10:08:44]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	archivist	[10:08:58] you hope [10:08:58]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:09:05] m [10:09:05]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	Affliction`	[10:09:07] Sure, the issue with GPIO is getting the receivers synchronised, ensuring the proper signal margin over the cable [10:09:07]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	Affliction`	[10:09:14] With ethernet, that's all done for you [10:09:14]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	Affliction`	[10:10:00] I'd expect a point to point link would be pretty low latency too, comes dow nto what you're using it for, I guess. [10:10:00]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:10:42] affliction`: you mean both GPIO and ethernet would be low latency. mhm. [10:10:42]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	Affliction`	[10:10:43] If you have an LVDS transceiver, that'll definately help you get multi gigabit speeds over a cable. [10:10:43]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:10:51] actually, I guess GPIO is interesting in that you could chain devices with it [10:10:51]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:11:00] so the infrastructure would be physically small [10:11:00]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:11:13] with gigabit ethernet you always need cabling all over [10:11:13]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:11:48] unless you have 2x gigabit nics on all devices, you really need gigabit switches, which are pretty big and bulky, and incur a central bandwidth limit and SPOF [10:11:48]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	Affliction`	[10:12:35] Indeed. Anyway, I'm not really familiar with too many other high speed links [10:12:35]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	Affliction`	[10:12:57] There might be a standard you could use [10:12:57]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	Affliction`	[10:13:12] GPIO, remember, is just setting pins as input or output, and high or low. [10:13:12]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:13:19] mhm gotcha. [10:13:19]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:13:32] is the keyword here SPI or GPIO? [10:13:32]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	Affliction`	[10:13:35] Signals take time to propagate, and beyond a few MHz, thigns get complicated. [10:13:35]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:13:37] or GPIO with DMA [10:13:37]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:13:42] mm [10:13:42]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	Affliction`	[10:13:45] GPIO in general. [10:13:45]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:13:47] yeah i'd need a sync protocol [10:13:47]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:13:47] mhm [10:13:47]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:13:48] cool [10:13:48]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:13:57] so GPIO that's connected to a DMA engine. [10:13:57]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	Affliction`	[10:13:57] To do it over GPIO, even with DMA, you'll need some form of clock signal, likely. [10:13:57]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	Affliction`	[10:14:32] If the DMA engines in both chips can generate and synchronise to an external clock, maybe it'll work [10:14:32]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	Affliction`	[10:15:18] If not, I'd recommend looking up standard high speed interface busses. Ordinarily I have no problems with reinventing the wheel, but, it'll probably take a lot of effort and knowledge to reinvent this wheel. [10:15:18]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:16:18] interesting. mhm. [10:16:18]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:16:41] could you somehow chain ethernet cables as to remove the need for hubs and switches, within smaller circuits? [10:16:41]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	Affliction`	[10:17:25] Sure, I reckon you could do that in software. You'd need 2 ports on each device though. [10:17:25]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:17:45] 2 ports, right. hm. [10:17:45]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:17:47] very well. [10:17:47]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:17:52] btw, nice to see ARM64 boards finally getting out!! [10:17:52]

2016-09-22 00:23:51	Affliction`	[10:19:27] You might find https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_device_bit_rates useful [10:19:27]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:20:15] affliction`: cool - wait, where is DMA GPIO in tha tlist? [10:20:15]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:20:26] "GPIB/HPIB (IEEE-488.1-2003) IEEE-488 max.", per pin 8MB/sec???? [10:20:26]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	Affliction`	[10:20:29] As mentioned, there's no standard behind that [10:20:29]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:21:38] mhm [10:21:38]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:21:40] ok [10:21:40]
2016-09-22 00:23:51	BW^-	[10:21:49] very well, thanks for sharing your general ideas on this one. :) [10:21:49]

2016-09-22 02:24:49	BW^-	aha AMD64 is 48bit too. wow that's quite low considering that AMD64 was made for servers too. interesting.  I wonder how big Sparc64 has.
2016-09-22 02:26:14	OxFEEDBACC	actually it's flexible in AMD64... you can query the width for each existing CPU via CPUID somehow...
2016-09-22 02:26:14		[02:26]
2016-09-22 02:26:34	OxFEEDBACC	that is, AMD64 is _not limited_ to 48 bits...
2016-09-22 02:26:46	OxFEEDBACC	and i guess it's similar for ARM...

What do you think is the bottleneck here? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDo-j00vUtw#5m20s

2016-09-23 04:30:39	roxfan	iirc you can have page tables in virtual memory (except the top-level ones I guess)
2016-09-23 04:31:24	dminuoso	roxfan: Not really. What you may refer to is the recursive trick to modify page tables.
2016-09-23 04:31:40	dminuoso	But the page tables themselves just contain entries with physical addresses.
2016-09-23 04:31:41	dminuoso	For x86 anyway.
2016-09-23 04:32:50	roxfan	#osdev might be a better choice for page mapping debugging btw
2016-09-23 04:32:50		[04:32]
2016-09-23 04:32:58	roxfan	they've probably seen them all
2016-09-23 04:33:03	dminuoso	roxfan: At this point Im not sure what Im debugging at all.
2016-09-23 04:33:13	dminuoso	But its a fair point anyway.
2016-09-23 04:33:35	Jester01	do you have an IDT set up for the page fault?
2016-09-23 04:34:05	roxfan	and do you have a mapping for the code being executed?
2016-09-23 04:34:07	dminuoso	Jester01: Not that early.
2016-09-23 04:34:14	Jester01	" Processors update CR2 whenever a page fault is detected. If a second page fault occurs while an earlier page fault is being delivered, the faulting linear address of the second fault will overwrite the contents of CR2 (replacing the previous address). These updates to CR2 occur even if the
2016-09-23 04:34:14	Jester01	 page fault results in a double fault or occurs during the delivery of a double fault."
2016-09-23 04:34:23	dminuoso	roxfan: Yeah. If I didn't then the IP itself would end up in CR2
2016-09-23 04:34:52	Jester01	I assume that 80000011  comes from a subsequent fault somehow
2016-09-23 04:34:57	Jester01	can only guess without complete code
2016-09-23 04:35:37	dminuoso	Jester01: It's from the first exception
2016-09-23 04:35:51	dminuoso	I cant get bochs to run on OSX atm. :(
2016-09-23 04:36:28	roxfan	don't use osx? :)
2016-09-23 04:36:46	dminuoso	No way :)
2016-09-23 04:37:45	Jester01	upload yer binary then
2016-09-23 04:38:07	 *	Jester01 quickly goes to the bike shop in the meantime
2016-09-23 04:41:08	dminuoso	Mmm. Here is my currenty theory:
2016-09-23 04:41:08	dminuoso	16:39 < dminuoso> radens: paging gets enabled, next thing it does is fetch 100079, which gets translated to some physical address which points at some valid opcode that somehow references 0000000080000011

2016-09-23 12:20:46	jesper--	[15:24:48] I'm trying. Would "leal myLabel, %ebx" be the same as "movl $myLabel, %ebx"? [15:24:48]

2016-09-23 12:20:46	OxFEEDBACC	[15:32:03] well, lea guarantees to never touch memory... use lea when you don't want to access memory (prevents error due to missing $ prefix when mov from a label) [15:32:03]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	OxFEEDBACC	[15:33:40] lea also has other (ab)uses, btw... [15:33:40]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	OxFEEDBACC	[15:34:05] quick multiplication for several factors, for example... [15:34:05]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	jesper--	[15:36:09] ok, thank you [15:36:09]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	ggole	[15:36:18] Three operand lea isn't much faster than imul these days [15:36:18]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	ggole	[15:36:58] (It's still a useful instruction, though.) [15:36:58]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	OxFEEDBACC	[15:37:23] multiplication by 5/10 is even faster than (unsigned) mul when done with shifts and adds... [15:37:23]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	OxFEEDBACC	[15:37:38] no idea if they implemented some optimization in imul... [15:37:38]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	OxFEEDBACC	[15:38:41] (even on atoms without out-of-order execution...) [15:38:41]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	OxFEEDBACC	[15:40:41] well, 10 requires an additional shift anyway... [15:40:41]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	ggole	[15:40:45] Well, slow lea is a lea with base, operand, offset. I guess mul by 3, 5 etc doesn't have that problem. [15:40:45]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	ggole	[15:40:59] Since it's [r1, r1 * 4] [15:40:59]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	OxFEEDBACC	[15:41:27] actually it's [r1,r1<<2] :-p [15:41:27]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	ggole	[15:41:27] (+ not ,) [15:41:27]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	Jester01	[16:52:21] dminuoso: any news? :) [16:52:21]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	guillaumus	[17:24:11] hello, must i write special code when i use multiple-core processor ? [17:24:11]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	GeDaMo	[17:25:09] More context required [17:25:09]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	guillaumus	[17:33:20]  thank you, I'm a beginner, I ask myself many questions. I'd really like to code in assembler. I want to use risc processors, and without any new hyperthreading technologies etc .. and without multiple cores. But I love anyway, as far as possible execute programs on my smartphone which generally has arm. So, is that the code is very different between single and multiple cores? [17:33:20]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	GeDaMo	[17:34:04] Generally each core will run a program in the same way as a single core [17:34:04]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	GeDaMo	[17:34:22] Each core has its own program counter and registers etc. [17:34:22]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	guillaumus	[17:34:23] or each code is really different between each processor? [17:34:23]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	guillaumus	[17:34:39] a thank's [17:34:39]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	GeDaMo	[17:35:04] The only difficulty is getting all the cores running but you don't have to care about that unless you're writing an OS [17:35:04]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	GeDaMo	[17:36:48] You do have to care about synchronizing code which runs on different cores if they access the same memory [17:36:48]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	guillaumus	[17:40:25] thank you I understand you are very interesting :) [17:40:25]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	radens	[19:13:12] Does anyone here know much about intel sgx? From a thread running in an SGX enclave, can you syscall into the host kernel? [19:13:12]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	slavking	[19:15:06] bump for radens question [19:15:06]
2016-09-23 12:20:46	radens	[19:15:21] I can see in the manual that interrupts cause enclave exits, so I'm not entirely sure if user issuable interrupts are still a thing and cause enclave exits. [19:15:21]

2016-09-23 20:57:14	ryonaloli	"mov" is also the keyword. it's a keyword for the mov instruction.
2016-09-23 20:57:26	vdamewood	I would never call 'mov' a keyword. I'd call it a mnemonic.
2016-09-23 20:57:27	ryonaloli	just like "movl" is another keyword for the mov instruction, when using gas syntax.
2016-09-23 20:59:51	soulisson	it painful for me, because both words are translated the same way in my native language
2016-09-23 21:00:18	vdamewood	soulisson: I'm guessing romance.
2016-09-23 21:00:20	soulisson	both are translated as "instruction" :)
2016-09-23 21:01:48	vdamewood	soulisson: Actually, I'm curious, which language, and what's the in-language word?
2016-09-23 21:02:00	ryonaloli	exit
2016-09-23 21:02:08	soulisson	vdamewood, french
2016-09-23 21:03:13	soulisson	the litteral translation of statement is "declaration" but no technical book use that and it wouldn't make much sense

2016-09-23 21:03:15	vdamewood	Hmm... I was right.

2016-09-23 21:06:30	fizzie	"instruction" is pretty commonly also the whole thing, since that's what the resulting machine code instruction contains -- both the opcode and any operands.

2016-09-24 00:33:53	fizzie	[07:06:29] "instruction" is pretty commonly also the whole thing, since that's what the resulting machine code instruction contains -- both the opcode and any operands. [07:06:29]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vdamewood	[07:07:53] Yeah, that's the way I understand it, both 'mov' and 'mov eax, ebx' are called 'instructions'. If one wants to distinguish, one would call 'mov' the mnemonic or the opcode. Though, opcode might also specifically mean the binary representation of the 'mov' part of the instruction. [07:07:53]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	soulisson	[07:09:29] vdamewood, can we refer to the   "mov" part as the operation [07:09:29]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	soulisson	[07:09:34] ? [07:09:34]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vulture	[07:09:45] no [07:09:45]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	soulisson	[07:10:15] I guess I will to use the mnemonic [07:10:15]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	soulisson	[07:10:16]  :) [07:10:16]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vulture	[07:10:20] I think you're only going to find confusion in this discussion [07:10:20]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vulture	[07:10:29] so best not to have it ;) [07:10:29]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	ryonaloli	[07:11:17] i've always known instructions as identical to opcodes, and not the same as operands. so perhaps it's something which is often ambiguous? [07:11:17]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vdamewood	[07:11:36] We have a lot of those in programming. [07:11:36]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vulture	[07:11:48] I think the closest you'll probably get is operator operand1,operand2,... [07:11:48]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vulture	[07:12:06] so referring to the "mov" part as the operator is ok [07:12:06]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vulture	[07:12:11] (not operation as you said) [07:12:11]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	soulisson	[07:12:34] vulture, ok [07:12:34]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vulture	[07:12:43] this would be analogous to how a math equation like 2+4 where + is the operator and 2 and 4 are the operands [07:12:43]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	soulisson	[07:12:59] and it's called "computer science" [07:12:59]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vdamewood	[07:13:00] add 2, 4 [07:13:00]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vulture	[07:13:13] computer science is basically just math [07:13:13]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vdamewood	[07:13:24] A branch of it, anyway. [07:13:24]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	soulisson	[07:14:09] vulture, they should remove the word science, the technical terms are so liberally used, ... [07:14:09]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vulture	[07:14:25] :P [07:14:25]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vulture	[07:14:49] I dont think that's the case [07:14:49]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vulture	[07:15:32] I think the case though is that terms are used and re-used for the evolving field, and terms used in other branches of computer science or math or whatever get crossed over and merged and diverged [07:15:32]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vdamewood	[07:15:50] Like vector. [07:15:50]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vulture	[07:15:50] "vector" probably has a dozen different meanings [07:15:50]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vulture	[07:15:54] hah [07:15:54]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vdamewood	[07:15:58] ;) [07:15:58]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	soulisson	[07:16:19] honestly naming things is hard [07:16:19]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vulture	[07:16:29] that's why statistics doesnt even bother to name things [07:16:29]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vulture	[07:16:34] they just use individual letters [07:16:34]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vulture	[07:16:46] and then when they create more than 26 different things, they reuse them and hope nobody notices [07:16:46]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	soulisson	[07:16:47] hahahaha, yeah, that's true :) [07:16:47]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vdamewood	[07:17:25] Well, they distinguish between latin, greek, miniscule, and majiscule, so 90. [07:17:25]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vulture	[07:17:34] :P [07:17:34]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	roxfan2	[07:17:43] the two hardest problems in computer science are naming things, cache invalidation and off-by-one errors [07:17:43]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vulture	[07:17:45] suppose that's true :P [07:17:45]
2016-09-24 00:33:53	vdamewood	[07:17:58] Make that 100. [07:17:58]

2016-09-24 01:35:23	GeDaMo	Antares: what happens if you change the name 'dwDesiredAccess' to something else?

2016-09-24 01:35:54	Antares	i try it
2016-09-24 01:36:29	GeDaMo	Antares: is the value 0080 meant to be octal?
2016-09-24 01:36:55	Antares	i tra and 0080h
2016-09-24 01:37:10	GeDaMo	Try 80h
2016-09-24 01:37:28	GeDaMo	A 0 prefix often means the value is interpreted as octal but '8' is not a valid octal digit

2016-09-24 01:45:42	OxFEEDBACC	then it's likely the name, as GeDaMo suggested in the first place...
2016-09-24 01:45:56	GeDaMo	I don't see how it can be the name
2016-09-24 01:46:01	OxFEEDBACC	try __dwDesiredAccess
2016-09-24 01:46:32	OxFEEDBACC	the png shows that it is apparently a (what was it?) name defined elsewhere...
2016-09-24 01:46:50	GeDaMo	"Error: reserved word used as symbol"
2016-09-24 01:47:02	OxFEEDBACC	right, reserved word...
2016-09-24 01:47:18	GeDaMo	Antares: try dwDesiredAccess:         dw 80h
2016-09-24 01:47:32	OxFEEDBACC	it's like using "int switch;" in c, i suppose...
2016-09-24 01:48:01	OxFEEDBACC	(but not sure if that could work on the one or the other compiler ;-)

2016-09-24 16:26:59	UKCoder	Is it possible to programmatically (i.e. via registers) make a call or jmp statement in x86 real mode to another segment?  I know how to do it explicitly, but can't figure out how to do it via registers or other means.
2016-09-24 16:27:57	OxFEEDBACC	i don't think it is... segment overrides are only possible via memory operands...

2016-09-25 21:07:50	dminuoso	roxfan2: Just realized that a memory constraint forces GCC to flush out all relevant registers. So if it relies on CF across that inline assembly it has to flush it out.

2016-09-25 21:10:51	dminuoso	roxfan2: The thing is, gcc more than likely to inline such a function anyway. At that point GCC needs to know what the inline assembly does to the CPU, which is why you specify clobbers for example.
2016-09-25 21:11:17	roxfan2	yeah maybe
2016-09-25 21:11:27	dminuoso	(GCC does not understand assembly)
2016-09-25 21:11:31	roxfan2	not used gcc much
2016-09-25 21:11:46	roxfan2	for asm that is
2016-09-25 21:12:33	dminuoso	roxfan2: And even if it didn't, GCC does not pushad/popad for each function, it would be quite silly.

2016-09-26 01:23:14	FUZxxl	Hello!
2016-09-26 01:23:22	FUZxxl	On modern x86 machines, is cmc a slow instruction?
2016-09-26 01:23:53	dminuoso	FUZxxl: Buy a stopwatch and time it.
2016-09-26 01:25:05	boru	If only inhell published documentation about their ISA...
2016-09-26 01:26:40	dminuoso	FUZxxl: If you even have to ask this question and not talk about latency, it means you don't have a reference for opcodes and their latencies or experience with tools such as VTune.

2016-09-26 01:27:13	dminuoso	FUZxxl: That being said, it means you are probably not very experienced with optimizing in the first place, in which case you have no business asking this in the first place - it likely won't matter to you in slightest.
2016-09-26 01:27:40	FUZxxl	dminuoso: thank you for being helpful
2016-09-26 01:28:03	dminuoso	FUZxxl: You are welcome.
2016-09-26 01:28:55	dminuoso	FUZxxl: http://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf
2016-09-26 01:28:59	dminuoso	In case you are curious though.
2016-09-26 01:30:06	FUZxxl	dminuoso: I know these tables.
2016-09-26 01:30:22	dminuoso	FUZxxl: Then why are you asking that question?
2016-09-26 01:30:32	FUZxxl	because there is more than latency/throughput
2016-09-26 01:31:17	FUZxxl	I was wondering if there was some sort of penalty when a partial flags update happened recently
2016-09-26 01:31:19	dminuoso	FUZxxl: Yeah, like dependencies, uops things on more modern architectures. All of which are listed there.
2016-09-26 01:32:43	dminuoso	FUZxxl: At any rate. Profile it in VTune - then you get your best answer.
2016-09-26 01:32:55	FUZxxl	hm... okay

2016-09-26 08:36:25	Antares	http://DaMaGeLaB.in Обнова! Заходи!
2016-09-26 08:36:39	kaos	mini language like haskell
2016-09-26 08:36:41	kaos	w t f
2016-09-26 08:36:44	devonrevenge	however  I need to learn enough assembly (for this im thinking arm)
2016-09-26 08:36:45	devonrevenge	lol
2016-09-26 08:36:52	devonrevenge	I mean functional
2016-09-26 08:37:11	devonrevenge	like I make fifty functions you can link together
2016-09-26 08:37:20	kaos	ok
2016-09-26 08:37:24	kaos	THEN DO IT
2016-09-26 08:37:27	devonrevenge	YEAH
2016-09-26 08:37:30	kaos	:D
2016-09-26 08:38:05	kaos	haskell is quite good at manufacturing languages
2016-09-26 08:38:06	devonrevenge	so I wanted to ask if I can learn enough by january to do it - like how much is there to learn and how big is it
2016-09-26 08:38:20	kaos	you could write your compiler in it, if you want a really small compiler
2016-09-26 08:38:24	devonrevenge	Im really busy this year so i have to learn it at a casual pace
2016-09-26 08:38:28	OxCEA5ED	3000+ pages manuals :-D
2016-09-26 08:38:42	OxCEA5ED	(you may not need the first 2 or 3 pages, though...
2016-09-26 08:38:53	devonrevenge	I was thinking I make a c++ compiler to link together a text file and lots of wee arm objects
2016-09-26 08:39:09	OxCEA5ED	oh, arm...
2016-09-26 08:39:18	devonrevenge	with the aim of solving the first ten project euler problems
2016-09-26 08:39:26	OxCEA5ED	then it may be only 1500 pages...
2016-09-26 08:39:26	devonrevenge	however I know nothing of scope
2016-09-26 08:39:36	devonrevenge	- well the lecturer recomended arm
2016-09-26 08:39:43	brocolli	ooh a russian Antares
2016-09-26 08:39:45	brocolli	welcome, friend
2016-09-26 08:39:48	--	brocolli is now known as Broly
2016-09-26 08:40:06	devonrevenge	maybe for size or maybe its a jealous club thing that arm is far away from amd64 I dont know
2016-09-26 08:40:24	kaos	amd64 is insane
2016-09-26 08:40:26	kaos	do arm
2016-09-26 08:40:37	kaos	really, it does not matter
2016-09-26 08:40:55	devonrevenge	yeah my lecturer laughed when I said assembler seems small
2016-09-26 08:41:36	OxCEA5ED	i think so, too... if you want something really simple, take a basic RISC design... but they have their flaws, too... anyway, even on arm or x86, you aren't forced to use all features...
2016-09-26 08:42:18	OxCEA5ED	stick to a handful of addressing modes and avoid exotic instructions... then you can maybe do it til january...
2016-09-26 08:43:00	Broly	once you jam the FPU on an ARM
2016-09-26 08:43:00	vulture	processor manuals are only 3000 pages because they have a boilerplate/completeness that they follow for every individual instruction
2016-09-26 08:43:07	Broly	it becomes a CISC vs RISC and we know who wins (CISC)
2016-09-26 08:43:09	devonrevenge	thanks I need to know about scope I know the idea is good for marks because the lectureres eyes flared up
2016-09-26 08:43:27	devonrevenge	Broly you got to explain
2016-09-26 08:44:17	Broly	well, adding an FPU to a RISC sorta makes it a CISC imo
2016-09-26 08:44:25	Broly	CISC-in-spirit
2016-09-26 08:45:50	vulture	I dont think FPU necessarily makes you CISC
2016-09-26 08:45:50		[08:45]
2016-09-26 08:45:57	vulture	but yes CISC does win vs RISC :P
2016-09-26 08:46:11	Broly	of course it doesn't actually make it a CISC
2016-09-26 08:46:19	devonrevenge	you tryin to put me off?
2016-09-26 08:46:21	Broly	but to me the differences become smaller.
2016-09-26 08:46:31	Broly	learning about superscalar and scalar architectures si important
2016-09-26 08:46:42	Broly	and understanding how even serialised CPU pipelines can have parallel aspects
2016-09-26 08:46:56	Broly	i.e. single core with hyperthreading has some parallel elements to it
2016-09-26 08:47:31	Broly	i'm rusty on this stuff myself but i really liked it when i learned it, and prided myself on mastering the fundamentals
2016-09-26 08:47:36	devonrevenge	what was an fpu again?
2016-09-26 08:47:39	Broly	may need to brush up in the future, hopefully
2016-09-26 08:47:40	GeDaMo	devonrevenge:  you might be interested in http://plzoo.andrej.com/
2016-09-26 08:47:44	Broly	floating point unit
2016-09-26 08:47:47	vulture	I dont really know what this has to do with his original question

2016-09-26 08:48:10	vulture	you may have a hard time with actual programming
2016-09-26 08:48:21	devonrevenge	im not sure if my scope is close enuff
2016-09-26 08:48:30	kaos	vulture: how is that not programming :b
2016-09-26 08:48:54	kaos	you type on a keyboard, compile, and a program results
2016-09-26 08:49:06	Broly	my favourite is modern processor design
2016-09-26 08:49:08	vulture	real programming involves writing a step by step algorithm (which is capable of being executed), not a math equation that is not
2016-09-26 08:49:11	Broly	by shen and lipasti
2016-09-26 08:49:13	Broly	absolutely amazing book

2016-09-26 08:49:38	kaos	vulture: but. boolean arithmetic is math
2016-09-26 08:49:51	kaos	all programs are math, often boringly stupid math, but still
2016-09-26 08:49:59	vulture	programs have side effects
2016-09-26 08:50:04	vulture	functional programs do not
2016-09-26 08:50:06	vulture	"programs"
2016-09-26 08:50:14	kaos	there are dirty functions
2016-09-26 08:50:16	kaos	and monads
2016-09-26 08:50:19	vulture	uh huh
2016-09-26 08:50:20	vulture	aka
2016-09-26 08:50:21	Broly	they dont even need to know the hardcore logic aspects until later, as long as they stay the course and learn calculus and other stuff correctly. they can come back to the hardcore aspect later
2016-09-26 08:50:27	kaos	you kindof need them otherwise nothing really happens
2016-09-26 08:50:31	vulture	functional sucks and here are special case things to make it actually work on computers :P
2016-09-26 08:50:57	Broly	that's what happened for me, at least. i was focused on rigorous thought process. made sure that everything i did was systematic. input and output, and standardising the procedure that transforms the input to the output so that it can be applied in the same scenario on any machine/input/whatever
2016-09-26 08:51:20	kaos	vulture: it just sounds like you are shell-shocked by monads
2016-09-26 08:53:13	vulture	gonads

2016-09-26 08:53:54	GeDaMo	gnomads
2016-09-26 08:54:39	kaos	i read some about quantum computers. there is some papers published that describes their abstract workings
2016-09-26 08:54:45	kaos	they have no side-effects
2016-09-26 08:54:48	kaos	like litterary none
2016-09-26 08:54:54	kaos	not even heat loss
2016-09-26 08:55:23	vulture	I dont think you understand quantum computers
2016-09-26 08:55:25	kaos	they would be quite adequately described by some functional programming language
2016-09-26 08:55:27	kaos	no
2016-09-26 08:55:49	kaos	but of course i tried to learn it, or at least have some insight into how they worked
2016-09-26 08:55:53	kaos	will work*
2016-09-26 08:55:56	vulture	but that's besides the point, I dont believe in superposition and quantum computing is a total sham. it just boils down to a highly parallel (by qubit) computer. imo :P
2016-09-26 08:56:15	kaos	there is a programming language named QCL that looks a bit like c, that one can play around with
2016-09-26 08:56:55	kaos	and a library for haskell that implements a quantum monad (measurement is not 'functional')
2016-09-26 08:56:57	vulture	if you understand a simple algorithm in EXP class of algorithms, and how superposition/qubits work, then you could potentially understand how quantum computing is "supposed" to work
2016-09-26 08:57:17	vulture	it is highly unlikely that you'll see a real language for quantum computing any time soon
2016-09-26 08:57:23	vulture	and by any time soon I mean 100+ years
2016-09-26 08:57:38	vulture	the hardware/application is too specialized to support a language really
2016-09-26 08:57:47	kaos	vulture: srsly, it actually is possible to understand shit, if one just download papers. its not rocket science
2016-09-26 08:58:01	vulture	and even if it did, you would slow down your "program" by orders of magnitude doing common c-ish statements
2016-09-26 08:58:07	kaos	yes
2016-09-26 08:58:22	kaos	its not possible to run shors algorithm for larger numbers than 255 in QCL
2016-09-26 08:58:27	kaos	(i did that btw.)
2016-09-26 09:00:08	kaos	qubit registers are vectors in C^(n^2). the base vectors are the binary numbers that the register can take. when a vector is not aligned perfectly to one of the base vectors, it is in a superposition
2016-09-26 09:00:33	kaos	quantum gates are unitary matrices
2016-09-26 09:00:35	vulture	shors algorithm is garbage anyway
2016-09-26 09:00:54	vulture	the largest number factored with shors algorithm is a joke. nobody uses that in the QC community

2016-09-26 10:50:20	Jester01	the speed of the ram installed doesn't. you should set the other stuff up properly.
2016-09-26 10:51:49	mra90	Jester01: so are you trying to say that RAM has it's own clock independant from main CPU?
2016-09-26 10:51:52	Jester01	if the spec says your laptop comes with 1600MHz memory, that means you should not try to run it faster assuming you want to stay in the supported range (ie. no overclock)
2016-09-26 10:52:09	Jester01	it doesn't have the clock, it does have a limit as to how fast it can go
2016-09-26 10:52:21	mra90	oh sure
2016-09-26 10:52:23	Jester01	so you should program the memory controller to not exceed that speed

2016-09-26 10:54:56	mra90	let's say inside SRAM for example or bytes are equally achievable
2016-09-26 10:55:07	mra90	equally in terms of speed.
2016-09-26 10:55:24	Jester01	yes, for example 1600MHz DDR3 memory typically comes from CL6 to CL11
2016-09-26 10:56:44	Jester01	what you have for main memory in a pc is memory modules, with other stuff than just the memory cells. also logic stuff, that do addressing and buffering and bursting and pipelining and whatnot :)

2016-09-26 10:58:54	Jester01	take a glance at section 2.2 DRAM Access Technical Details

2016-09-26 11:00:01	mra90	hmm higher CL not always mean smaller delay?

2016-09-26 11:00:13	Jester01	higher CL higher delay, lower speed
2016-09-26 11:00:24	Jester01	it's a latency
2016-09-26 11:00:45	Jester01	see the picture I linked. it shows how much you need to wait after sending the column address before you start getting data back
2016-09-26 11:01:45	mra90	so in sum t_rcd + CL
2016-09-26 11:02:24	Jester01	also note that it is normally specified in clocks not time units, so you need to scale by clock speed

2016-09-26 11:02:48	mra90	yep 5 clocks
2016-09-26 11:02:50	Jester01	which is why a faster MHz but higher CL might ultimately be slower than a lower MHz and lower CL
2016-09-26 11:03:09	Jester01	depending on your accesses
2016-09-26 11:03:29	Jester01	the higher MHz means it will pump out the data faster once it starts pumping
2016-09-26 11:04:01	mra90	sure, but time spent waiting for RAM resposnse is dicated by CL
2016-09-26 11:04:02	Jester01	but you might have to wait a little longer for the first word
2016-09-26 11:04:06	Jester01	yes

2016-09-26 11:06:05	mra90	but from that wiki article I pasted looks like higher CL doesn't always mean lower wait time
2016-09-26 11:06:16	Jester01	1333MHz CL9 and 1600MHz CL9 do not have the same latency because 9 clocks is less time at the faster speed (the clock actually runs slower due to DDR, but the proportions work)
2016-09-26 11:06:37	mra90	Jester01: is that beacuse they also include clock speed there
2016-09-26 11:06:39	Jester01	higher CL with the same speed means HIGHER wait time. big CL is bad.

2016-09-26 12:09:17	mra90	Jester01: one more point, do you know how i.e windows os measure CPU load?
2016-09-26 12:10:04	Jester01	not in particular, but since the OS assigns the time slices to processes, it just accumulates those.
2016-09-26 12:11:29	mra90	hmm rather rough way
2016-09-26 12:11:40	Jester01	?
2016-09-26 12:11:49	mra90	I mean no very accurate
2016-09-26 12:12:04	Jester01	it's very accurate, why do you think it isn't?
2016-09-26 12:12:21	Jester01	the OS runs the scheduler using a timer interrupt
2016-09-26 12:12:44	Jester01	(I assume windows does this too)

2016-09-26 12:16:38	mra90	hmm in C if I do "Stuff->FunctionCall();" is there any way to get address of Stuff inside FunctionCall body?
2016-09-26 12:16:57	Jester01	no.
2016-09-26 12:17:01	OxCEA5ED	by passing it...
2016-09-26 12:17:03	Jester01	:)
2016-09-26 12:17:05	mra90	of course without passing it..
2016-09-26 12:17:23	OxCEA5ED	or reading the return address from stack and analyze the preceding code...
2016-09-26 12:17:42	mra90	return address from what?
2016-09-26 12:17:45	mra90	FunctionCall?
2016-09-26 12:17:52	OxCEA5ED	yep
2016-09-26 12:17:53	mra90	I need that address in FunctionCall
2016-09-26 12:17:56	mra90	not after
2016-09-26 12:18:17	mra90	and I guess you suspect what I am trying to implement do you?
2016-09-26 12:18:19	Jester01	also that's not the return address.
2016-09-26 12:18:33	Jester01	oh you mean somehow reverse engineering the code
2016-09-26 12:18:37	Jester01	good luck with that :)
2016-09-26 12:18:46	OxCEA5ED	yeah :-)
2016-09-26 12:19:06	mra90	reverse engineering the code? No this is not my goal
2016-09-26 12:19:14	Jester01	not you, OxCEA5ED
2016-09-26 12:19:15	mra90	it would be easy ;]
2016-09-26 12:19:16	OxCEA5ED	it's not even guaranteed that the function has been called via pointer or that a possible function pointer was a struct member...
2016-09-26 12:19:31	--	osa1_ is now known as osa1
2016-09-26 12:19:33	Jester01	you could also search memory if you have some information

2016-09-26 12:19:58	Jester01	might be a calculated pointer in a register for example. good luck finding that anywhere :)

2016-09-26 12:24:33	mra90	yes
2016-09-26 12:24:44	Jester01	you might do something with a macro

2016-09-26 12:25:55	Jester01	only 2 characters more :)
2016-09-26 12:26:24	mra90	but still you need to pass args so it is even worst then "Stuff->FunctionCall(self);"
2016-09-26 12:26:35	Jester01	but that's hidden by the macro
2016-09-26 12:26:54	mra90	ok but the user of the class must write macros
2016-09-26 12:27:01	Jester01	no, you write it
2016-09-26 12:27:10	Jester01	once :)
2016-09-26 12:27:19	mra90	you mean in header?
2016-09-26 12:27:22	Jester01	sure
2016-09-26 12:27:54	mra90	but you assume here only one instance of the class aren't you?
2016-09-26 12:28:15	Jester01	huh?
2016-09-26 12:28:21	Jester01	no
2016-09-26 12:28:42	Jester01	it's just a macro that inserts the instance as first argument so you don't have to.
2016-09-26 12:28:57	mra90	but from where do you get that instance?
2016-09-26 12:29:06	Jester01	you don't need to write Stuff->FunctionCall(Stuff)  you just write CALL(Stuff, FunctionCall)
2016-09-26 12:29:11	Jester01	it's passed to the macro.
2016-09-26 12:29:30	Jester01	it saves you from typing it twice
2016-09-26 12:29:31	Jester01	that's all
2016-09-26 12:29:51	mra90	so every call to object will be done thru CALL (); ?
2016-09-26 12:29:54	Jester01	yes
2016-09-26 12:30:24	mra90	it is an oprtion
2016-09-26 12:30:44	Jester01	there are c++ to c translators
2016-09-26 12:31:11	mra90	it is rather not going to work they are just dfferent
2016-09-26 12:31:23	Jester01	but I don't see your point, since you do not have to use any other c++ features if you don't want to
2016-09-26 12:31:25	mra90	it cannot be translated one to one
2016-09-26 12:31:47	mra90	do you have link to such resource?
2016-09-26 12:31:54	Jester01	if you just want classes and members, use those, and don't use templates and rtti or whatever

2016-09-26 14:39:47	OxCEA5ED	anyone having an explanation (or the slightest idea, anyway) for this? psubb/psubw/psubd/psubq are encoded to f8/f9/fa/fb, each with a 0f prefix... paddb/paddw/paddd are likewise encoded to fc/fd/fe with the same prefix, but paddq is 0f d4, while 0f ff is left unused... does this follow any logic? aren't 0xff bytes allowed in the instruction stream?

2016-09-26 14:50:25	OxCEA5ED	i doubt that... may look like it on pictures, but i bet they stacked the decoder logic transistors to hide the facts... 25 or 26 levels or so...

2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[22:27:00] no, you write it [22:27:00]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[22:27:09] once :) [22:27:09]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	mra90	[22:27:18] you mean in header? [22:27:18]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[22:27:21] sure [22:27:21]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	mra90	[22:27:53] but you assume here only one instance of the class aren't you? [22:27:53]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[22:28:14] huh? [22:28:14]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[22:28:21] no [22:28:21]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[22:28:41] it's just a macro that inserts the instance as first argument so you don't have to. [22:28:41]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	mra90	[22:28:57] but from where do you get that instance? [22:28:57]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[22:29:05] you don't need to write Stuff->FunctionCall(Stuff)  you just write CALL(Stuff, FunctionCall) [22:29:05]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[22:29:10] it's passed to the macro. [22:29:10]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[22:29:29] it saves you from typing it twice [22:29:29]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[22:29:30] that's all [22:29:30]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	mra90	[22:29:50] so every call to object will be done thru CALL (); ? [22:29:50]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[22:29:53] yes [22:29:53]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	mra90	[22:30:23] it is an oprtion [22:30:23]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[22:30:43] there are c++ to c translators [22:30:43]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	mra90	[22:31:10] it is rather not going to work they are just dfferent [22:31:10]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[22:31:22] but I don't see your point, since you do not have to use any other c++ features if you don't want to [22:31:22]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	mra90	[22:31:24] it cannot be translated one to one [22:31:24]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	mra90	[22:31:47] do you have link to such resource? [22:31:47]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[22:31:53] if you just want classes and members, use those, and don't use templates and rtti or whatever [22:31:53]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[22:32:29] this was the classic one: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cfront [22:32:29]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	mra90	[22:33:26] Jester01: ok thank you very much ;) [22:33:26]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	mra90	[22:33:35] I probably need to sleep now... [22:33:35]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[22:33:41] nite :) [22:33:41]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	mra90	[22:33:42] see you tomorrow ;) [22:33:42]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Chloe	[23:54:25] what does the arm 'bls' instruction do? https://sourceware.org/cgen/gen-doc/arm-thumb-insn.html#insn-bls I dont understand what 'ls' is [23:54:25]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	klys	[23:56:00] branch if less? [23:56:00]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[23:56:05] "LS  Unsigned lower or same" [23:56:05]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[23:57:06] obviously carry is for unsigned lower, and zbit is for equal [23:57:06]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[23:57:38] leu=less equal unsigned [23:57:38]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[00:08:39] yw :P [00:08:39]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	OxCEA5ED	[00:39:47] anyone having an explanation (or the slightest idea, anyway) for this? psubb/psubw/psubd/psubq are encoded to f8/f9/fa/fb, each with a 0f prefix... paddb/paddw/paddd are likewise encoded to fc/fd/fe with the same prefix, but paddq is 0f d4, while 0f ff is left unused... does this follow any logic? aren't 0xff bytes allowed in the instruction stream? [00:39:47]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	OxCEA5ED	[00:41:23] same with ymm variants and the additional 66 prefix, btw.. [00:41:23]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[00:42:57] presumably left for future expansion [00:42:57]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	OxCEA5ED	[00:43:19] they could have left d4 for that ;-) [00:43:19]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[00:43:42] easier to decode an ff but given how complex the decoding already is, I guess d4 would have worked too :) [00:43:42]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	OxCEA5ED	[00:44:14] it's a complete mess... [00:44:14]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[00:45:51] FF by itself is a valid opcode for various instructions [00:45:51]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	OxCEA5ED	[00:46:30] yes, seen it... that wasn't a serious question :-D also used for -1 immediates, btw :-p [00:46:30]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[00:46:47] obviously for immediates and addresses and modrm and whatnot [00:46:47]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[00:46:56] I thought you might have meant for the opcode [00:46:56]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	OxCEA5ED	[00:49:04] i wonder how they do the decoding on the chips... how many percent of the transistors are used for decoding... [00:49:04]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	Jester01	[00:49:23] most transistors are in the cache :D [00:49:23]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	OxCEA5ED	[00:49:28] and i'd like to see the VHDL (or whatever they use) for the decoder... [00:49:28]
2016-09-26 21:42:07	OxCEA5ED	[00:50:24] i doubt that... may look like it on pictures, but i bet they stacked the decoder logic transistors to hide the facts... 25 or 26 levels or so... [00:50:24]
