2016-09-17 11:04:52	ploupz	[20:44:47] it's not really difficult i think i just need to decode the stream edit it, and then encode it [20:44:47]
2016-09-17 11:04:52	ploupz	[20:45:03] boru ghostscript is only for manual editting ? [20:45:03]
2016-09-17 11:04:52	ploupz	[20:45:27] meaning it can't take  parameter ? [20:45:27]

2016-09-17 12:27:17	Jester01	movsd doesn't take an immediate, it take an address
2016-09-17 12:27:36	slavking	hmm
2016-09-17 12:27:49	slavking	so i have to change .float to .double
2016-09-17 12:27:58	Jester01	yes
2016-09-17 12:28:14	slavking	  movsd $(output), %xmm0
2016-09-17 12:28:18	slavking	so it takes

2016-09-17 12:28:30	slavking	oh
2016-09-17 12:28:33	slavking	no brackets?
2016-09-17 12:28:35	AverageJ0e	what is this linux shit?
2016-09-17 12:28:38	slavking	XD
2016-09-17 12:28:40	Jester01	no brackets
2016-09-17 12:28:52	Jester01	but you can use them if you like confusing things
2016-09-17 12:29:00	Jester01	the important thing is no $
2016-09-17 12:29:34	Jester01	also, do not use exit syscall if you use libc ... just return from main, or call exit
2016-09-17 12:29:54	slavking	what will happen if I use syscall exit?
2016-09-17 12:30:17	Jester01	the C library will have no chance to uninitialize properly
2016-09-17 12:30:26	Jester01	stuff may be left in buffers and such
2016-09-17 12:30:38	slavking	assembly is hard
2016-09-17 12:30:41	Jester01	furthermore you will probably get a nice big segfault because you don't use proper stack alignment
2016-09-17 12:30:42	slavking	;_____________;
2016-09-17 12:30:49	AverageJ0e	just ret twice, its faster than exit syscall
2016-09-17 12:30:56	slavking	retq
2016-09-17 12:31:09	slavking	I have the compiler thingy output down
2016-09-17 12:31:11	Jester01	you can even jmp printf :)
2016-09-17 12:31:29	Jester01	that will have the additional side effect of fixing the stack alignment
2016-09-17 12:31:37	AverageJ0e	yep
2016-09-17 12:32:49	Jester01	duh
2016-09-17 12:32:58	Jester01	you also messed up pi and output
2016-09-17 12:33:01	slavking	yes
2016-09-17 12:33:07	slavking	how do I compile this?
2016-09-17 12:33:16	Jester01	gcc foo.s
2016-09-17 12:33:17	slavking	as file.S -o out ?
2016-09-17 12:33:23	slavking	yeah I need gcc
2016-09-17 12:33:26	slavking	cause of library calls?
2016-09-17 12:33:29	Jester01	yes
2016-09-17 12:33:48	slavking	I dun geddit
2016-09-17 12:33:53	slavking	how do I use .data
2016-09-17 12:34:06	Jester01	looks okay
2016-09-17 12:34:10	Jester01	what's wrong with .data
2016-09-17 12:34:10	slavking	movsd output,%xmm0
2016-09-17 12:34:18	Jester01	no, you want movsd pi, %xmm0
2016-09-17 12:34:21	slavking	yeah
2016-09-17 12:34:28	slavking	xmm0 is a floating point register
2016-09-17 12:34:35	Jester01	and movq $output, %rsi

2016-09-17 12:34:58	Jester01	if you want to keep it confusing, yes.
2016-09-17 12:35:24	slavking	i don't need addrpi

2016-09-17 12:46:05	slavking	yeah
2016-09-17 12:46:21	slavking	but if I were to use it, I'd have to supply the count?

2016-09-17 13:31:02	damien	alright! thanks :)

2016-09-17 14:33:50	damien	[23:29:11] from my understanding pusha will push eax ecx edx ebx esp ebp esi edi, correct? [23:29:11]

2016-09-17 14:33:50	damien	[23:30:34] so there isn't any chance of the assembler just pushing ax cx dx... ? [23:30:34]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	Jester01	[23:30:42] none. [23:30:42]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	damien	[23:31:02] alright! thanks :) [23:31:02]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	Jester01	[23:31:40] about as much as turning add eax, 8 into inc eax repeated 8 times :) [23:31:40]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	Jester01	[23:31:52] you said pusha, you get pusha. [23:31:52]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	damien	[23:32:15] lmao awesome [23:32:15]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	Jester01	[23:32:19] anyway, that's easy to verify with a listing or disassembly if you are worried (but the well known assemblers work properly) [23:32:19]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	damien	[23:34:46] Jester01: damn, I've spent a lot of time on debuging this asm -> c call interface.. I should use a disassembler.. that would simplify my life a bit [23:34:46]

2016-09-18 01:23:05	guillaumus	hello, i would like write asm to risc processor, i must use one assembly language than other ? thank's
2016-09-18 01:24:29	guillaumus	i'm not say about syntax intel or AT&T, is not the probleme, isn't ?
2016-09-18 01:24:50	archivist	can you translate that to english
2016-09-18 01:24:51	guillaumus	talk about *
2016-09-18 01:25:00	guillaumus	xD
2016-09-18 01:25:19	guillaumus	ok, i use google translate, one moment pliz
2016-09-18 01:25:43	archivist	"asm to risc processor" to you mean an assembler

2016-09-18 01:26:58	guillaumus	Is there a difference for programming a CISC or RISC processor? Or syntax (so intel or AT & T) are identical but the instructions are simply different?
2016-09-18 01:27:53	archivist	syntax and risc/cisc are completely different concepts
2016-09-18 01:28:12	archivist	you cannot merge them in one question
2016-09-18 01:28:17	guillaumus	yes
2016-09-18 01:28:31	guillaumus	i don't care about syntax
2016-09-18 01:28:50	guillaumus	if i would like write to risc, wich language a must use ?
2016-09-18 01:29:22	archivist	I do, I use the syntax the processor maker designed for their chip
2016-09-18 01:30:24	archivist	language also is a separate concept
2016-09-18 01:32:39	guillaumus	yes, it's same like humain language, the idea are identical, but the word change
2016-09-18 01:33:10	guillaumus	i can use intel or at&t or ... i can write for cisc or risc ?
2016-09-18 01:33:37	guillaumus	but, sur, the mnemonique ou instruction are différent
2016-09-18 01:33:57	archivist	you are confusing concepts in the same question
2016-09-18 01:34:21	guillaumus	yes, syntax, and word is not same
2016-09-18 01:34:59	archivist	syntax depends on assembler used, risc/cisc depends on architecture
2016-09-18 01:35:56	guillaumus	yes, i would like write for risc processor. I anderstand, it's a reduce instruction ? i hope they a re standart and very srict minimum instruction ?
2016-09-18 01:36:41	archivist	the instructions are defined by the maker of the chip,
2016-09-18 01:36:41		[01:36]
2016-09-18 01:36:46	guillaumus	maybe load, store, jmp, add/sub ?
2016-09-18 01:36:52	guillaumus	aaaa
2016-09-18 01:37:07	archivist	you read the chips instruction set manual
2016-09-18 01:37:37	guillaumus	okay !
2016-09-18 01:37:38	guillaumus	a damn, there would not be a common language that could be found among all risc architectures?
2016-09-18 01:38:14	archivist	no
2016-09-18 01:38:55	archivist	there will be some common instructions on ARM chips
2016-09-18 01:39:31	guillaumus	I thought wrong, I hoped to find simple language like a little lisp. Mas for processor. You see ?
2016-09-18 01:42:42	guillaumus	Perfect, archivist :) i go "RTFM" arm chip :)
2016-09-18 01:42:58	guillaumus	thank's

2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:27:53] syntax and risc/cisc are completely different concepts [11:27:53]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:28:12] you cannot merge them in one question [11:28:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:28:17] yes [11:28:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:28:31] i don't care about syntax [11:28:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:28:50] if i would like write to risc, wich language a must use ? [11:28:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:29:22] I do, I use the syntax the processor maker designed for their chip [11:29:22]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:30:24] language also is a separate concept [11:30:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:32:39] yes, it's same like humain language, the idea are identical, but the word change [11:32:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:33:10] i can use intel or at&t or ... i can write for cisc or risc ? [11:33:10]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:33:37] but, sur, the mnemonique ou instruction are différent [11:33:37]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:33:57] you are confusing concepts in the same question [11:33:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:34:21] yes, syntax, and word is not same [11:34:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:34:59] syntax depends on assembler used, risc/cisc depends on architecture [11:34:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:35:56] yes, i would like write for risc processor. I anderstand, it's a reduce instruction ? i hope they a re standart and very srict minimum instruction ? [11:35:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:36:41] the instructions are defined by the maker of the chip, [11:36:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:36:46] maybe load, store, jmp, add/sub ? [11:36:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:36:52] aaaa [11:36:52]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:37:07] you read the chips instruction set manual [11:37:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:37:37] okay ! [11:37:37]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:37:38] a damn, there would not be a common language that could be found among all risc architectures? [11:37:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:38:14] no [11:38:14]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:38:55] there will be some common instructions on ARM chips [11:38:55]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:39:31] I thought wrong, I hoped to find simple language like a little lisp. Mas for processor. You see ? [11:39:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:42:42] Perfect, archivist :) i go "RTFM" arm chip :) [11:42:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:42:58] thank's [11:42:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	roxfan	[12:26:10] many renesas chips use very similar syntax [12:26:10]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[17:39:46] http://paste.debian.net/828075/ <-- What's the purpose of the lock orl here? [17:39:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[17:40:08] (this is from musl's code) [17:40:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:46:34] It's a barrier: it inhibits reordering [17:46:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[17:50:46] ggole: that's not what usually is expected from atomic store, right? it's just that musl wants it to be done this way, right? [17:50:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:54:58] Well, that's the top of the stack: the operation isn't atomic in order to protect against other threads writing to the location. [17:54:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:55:16] The only purpose is for the effect on ordering of loads and stores. [17:55:16]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:56:57] Basically it's being used as a cheaper version of mfence. [17:56:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[17:57:02] ggole: why choose rsp specifically? [17:57:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[17:57:44] err.. yeah, that's the register that's guaranteed to point to a valid memory location, right? [17:57:44]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:57:49] Yeah [17:57:49]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:58:00] You're also pretty much guaranteed to have no contention there [17:58:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	roxfan	[17:58:16] btw you could ask for the specific reason in #musl [17:58:16]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[17:58:42] ggole: i see. since each thread has its own stack. [17:58:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:59:17] This might be an interesting read http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4232660/which-is-a-better-write-barrier-on-x86-lockaddl-or-xchgl [17:59:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[18:06:04] ggole: so lock; addl ... (or orl)   is more efficient than an sfence? then why provide sfence? [18:06:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[18:07:16] I'm not sure really why the semantics are that way. [18:07:16]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[18:12:55] i suppose the designers just wanted an explicit way to do this - so that in some way more efficiency could be gained (referring to the answer describing the hotspot devs) [18:12:55]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[18:13:18] "on some processors it can introduce false data dependencies" [18:13:18]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[18:18:14] There may be other uses, for things like streaming stores and writes to write-combined memory. [18:18:14]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[18:18:22] I'm not familiar with those details. [18:18:22]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[18:20:08] i see. idk about write-combined memory [18:20:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[18:23:32] ggole: am i right in saying - sfence should be better that lock; addl ... if you really want a write barrier, since lock; addl... serializes both reads and writes, which is like an mfence ? [18:23:32]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[19:05:26] snyp: maybe. Of course, I don't know which semantics the musl code required. [19:05:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[19:05:53] ggole: i see. [19:05:53]

2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:30:24] language also is a separate concept [11:30:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:32:39] yes, it's same like humain language, the idea are identical, but the word change [11:32:39]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:33:10] i can use intel or at&t or ... i can write for cisc or risc ? [11:33:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:33:37] but, sur, the mnemonique ou instruction are différent [11:33:37]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:33:57] you are confusing concepts in the same question [11:33:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:34:21] yes, syntax, and word is not same [11:34:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:34:59] syntax depends on assembler used, risc/cisc depends on architecture [11:34:59]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:35:56] yes, i would like write for risc processor. I anderstand, it's a reduce instruction ? i hope they a re standart and very srict minimum instruction ? [11:35:56]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:36:41] the instructions are defined by the maker of the chip, [11:36:41]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:36:46] maybe load, store, jmp, add/sub ? [11:36:46]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:36:52] aaaa [11:36:52]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:37:07] you read the chips instruction set manual [11:37:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:37:37] okay ! [11:37:37]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:37:38] a damn, there would not be a common language that could be found among all risc architectures? [11:37:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:38:14] no [11:38:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:38:55] there will be some common instructions on ARM chips [11:38:55]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:39:31] I thought wrong, I hoped to find simple language like a little lisp. Mas for processor. You see ? [11:39:31]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:42:42] Perfect, archivist :) i go "RTFM" arm chip :) [11:42:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:42:58] thank's [11:42:58]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	roxfan	[12:26:10] many renesas chips use very similar syntax [12:26:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[17:39:46] http://paste.debian.net/828075/ <-- What's the purpose of the lock orl here? [17:39:46]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[17:40:08] (this is from musl's code) [17:40:08]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:46:34] It's a barrier: it inhibits reordering [17:46:34]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[17:50:46] ggole: that's not what usually is expected from atomic store, right? it's just that musl wants it to be done this way, right? [17:50:46]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:54:58] Well, that's the top of the stack: the operation isn't atomic in order to protect against other threads writing to the location. [17:54:58]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:55:16] The only purpose is for the effect on ordering of loads and stores. [17:55:16]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:56:57] Basically it's being used as a cheaper version of mfence. [17:56:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[17:57:02] ggole: why choose rsp specifically? [17:57:02]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[17:57:44] err.. yeah, that's the register that's guaranteed to point to a valid memory location, right? [17:57:44]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:57:49] Yeah [17:57:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:58:00] You're also pretty much guaranteed to have no contention there [17:58:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	roxfan	[17:58:16] btw you could ask for the specific reason in #musl [17:58:16]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[17:58:42] ggole: i see. since each thread has its own stack. [17:58:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:59:17] This might be an interesting read http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4232660/which-is-a-better-write-barrier-on-x86-lockaddl-or-xchgl [17:59:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[18:06:04] ggole: so lock; addl ... (or orl)   is more efficient than an sfence? then why provide sfence? [18:06:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[18:07:16] I'm not sure really why the semantics are that way. [18:07:16]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[18:12:55] i suppose the designers just wanted an explicit way to do this - so that in some way more efficiency could be gained (referring to the answer describing the hotspot devs) [18:12:55]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[18:13:18] "on some processors it can introduce false data dependencies" [18:13:18]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[18:18:14] There may be other uses, for things like streaming stores and writes to write-combined memory. [18:18:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[18:18:22] I'm not familiar with those details. [18:18:22]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[18:20:08] i see. idk about write-combined memory [18:20:08]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[18:23:32] ggole: am i right in saying - sfence should be better that lock; addl ... if you really want a write barrier, since lock; addl... serializes both reads and writes, which is like an mfence ? [18:23:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[19:05:26] snyp: maybe. Of course, I don't know which semantics the musl code required. [19:05:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[19:05:53] ggole: i see. [19:05:53]
