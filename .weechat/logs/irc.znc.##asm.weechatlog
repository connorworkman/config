2016-09-17 11:04:52	ploupz	[20:44:47] it's not really difficult i think i just need to decode the stream edit it, and then encode it [20:44:47]
2016-09-17 11:04:52	ploupz	[20:45:03] boru ghostscript is only for manual editting ? [20:45:03]
2016-09-17 11:04:52	ploupz	[20:45:27] meaning it can't take  parameter ? [20:45:27]

2016-09-17 12:27:17	Jester01	movsd doesn't take an immediate, it take an address
2016-09-17 12:27:36	slavking	hmm
2016-09-17 12:27:49	slavking	so i have to change .float to .double
2016-09-17 12:27:58	Jester01	yes
2016-09-17 12:28:14	slavking	  movsd $(output), %xmm0
2016-09-17 12:28:18	slavking	so it takes

2016-09-17 12:28:30	slavking	oh
2016-09-17 12:28:33	slavking	no brackets?
2016-09-17 12:28:35	AverageJ0e	what is this linux shit?
2016-09-17 12:28:38	slavking	XD
2016-09-17 12:28:40	Jester01	no brackets
2016-09-17 12:28:52	Jester01	but you can use them if you like confusing things
2016-09-17 12:29:00	Jester01	the important thing is no $
2016-09-17 12:29:34	Jester01	also, do not use exit syscall if you use libc ... just return from main, or call exit
2016-09-17 12:29:54	slavking	what will happen if I use syscall exit?
2016-09-17 12:30:17	Jester01	the C library will have no chance to uninitialize properly
2016-09-17 12:30:26	Jester01	stuff may be left in buffers and such
2016-09-17 12:30:38	slavking	assembly is hard
2016-09-17 12:30:41	Jester01	furthermore you will probably get a nice big segfault because you don't use proper stack alignment
2016-09-17 12:30:42	slavking	;_____________;
2016-09-17 12:30:49	AverageJ0e	just ret twice, its faster than exit syscall
2016-09-17 12:30:56	slavking	retq
2016-09-17 12:31:09	slavking	I have the compiler thingy output down
2016-09-17 12:31:11	Jester01	you can even jmp printf :)
2016-09-17 12:31:29	Jester01	that will have the additional side effect of fixing the stack alignment
2016-09-17 12:31:37	AverageJ0e	yep
2016-09-17 12:32:49	Jester01	duh
2016-09-17 12:32:58	Jester01	you also messed up pi and output
2016-09-17 12:33:01	slavking	yes
2016-09-17 12:33:07	slavking	how do I compile this?
2016-09-17 12:33:16	Jester01	gcc foo.s
2016-09-17 12:33:17	slavking	as file.S -o out ?
2016-09-17 12:33:23	slavking	yeah I need gcc
2016-09-17 12:33:26	slavking	cause of library calls?
2016-09-17 12:33:29	Jester01	yes
2016-09-17 12:33:48	slavking	I dun geddit
2016-09-17 12:33:53	slavking	how do I use .data
2016-09-17 12:34:06	Jester01	looks okay
2016-09-17 12:34:10	Jester01	what's wrong with .data
2016-09-17 12:34:10	slavking	movsd output,%xmm0
2016-09-17 12:34:18	Jester01	no, you want movsd pi, %xmm0
2016-09-17 12:34:21	slavking	yeah
2016-09-17 12:34:28	slavking	xmm0 is a floating point register
2016-09-17 12:34:35	Jester01	and movq $output, %rsi

2016-09-17 12:34:58	Jester01	if you want to keep it confusing, yes.
2016-09-17 12:35:24	slavking	i don't need addrpi

2016-09-17 12:46:05	slavking	yeah
2016-09-17 12:46:21	slavking	but if I were to use it, I'd have to supply the count?

2016-09-17 13:31:02	damien	alright! thanks :)

2016-09-17 14:33:50	damien	[23:29:11] from my understanding pusha will push eax ecx edx ebx esp ebp esi edi, correct? [23:29:11]

2016-09-17 14:33:50	damien	[23:30:34] so there isn't any chance of the assembler just pushing ax cx dx... ? [23:30:34]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	Jester01	[23:30:42] none. [23:30:42]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	damien	[23:31:02] alright! thanks :) [23:31:02]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	Jester01	[23:31:40] about as much as turning add eax, 8 into inc eax repeated 8 times :) [23:31:40]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	Jester01	[23:31:52] you said pusha, you get pusha. [23:31:52]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	damien	[23:32:15] lmao awesome [23:32:15]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	Jester01	[23:32:19] anyway, that's easy to verify with a listing or disassembly if you are worried (but the well known assemblers work properly) [23:32:19]
2016-09-17 14:33:50	damien	[23:34:46] Jester01: damn, I've spent a lot of time on debuging this asm -> c call interface.. I should use a disassembler.. that would simplify my life a bit [23:34:46]

2016-09-18 01:23:05	guillaumus	hello, i would like write asm to risc processor, i must use one assembly language than other ? thank's
2016-09-18 01:24:29	guillaumus	i'm not say about syntax intel or AT&T, is not the probleme, isn't ?
2016-09-18 01:24:50	archivist	can you translate that to english
2016-09-18 01:24:51	guillaumus	talk about *
2016-09-18 01:25:00	guillaumus	xD
2016-09-18 01:25:19	guillaumus	ok, i use google translate, one moment pliz
2016-09-18 01:25:43	archivist	"asm to risc processor" to you mean an assembler

2016-09-18 01:26:58	guillaumus	Is there a difference for programming a CISC or RISC processor? Or syntax (so intel or AT & T) are identical but the instructions are simply different?
2016-09-18 01:27:53	archivist	syntax and risc/cisc are completely different concepts
2016-09-18 01:28:12	archivist	you cannot merge them in one question
2016-09-18 01:28:17	guillaumus	yes
2016-09-18 01:28:31	guillaumus	i don't care about syntax
2016-09-18 01:28:50	guillaumus	if i would like write to risc, wich language a must use ?
2016-09-18 01:29:22	archivist	I do, I use the syntax the processor maker designed for their chip
2016-09-18 01:30:24	archivist	language also is a separate concept
2016-09-18 01:32:39	guillaumus	yes, it's same like humain language, the idea are identical, but the word change
2016-09-18 01:33:10	guillaumus	i can use intel or at&t or ... i can write for cisc or risc ?
2016-09-18 01:33:37	guillaumus	but, sur, the mnemonique ou instruction are différent
2016-09-18 01:33:57	archivist	you are confusing concepts in the same question
2016-09-18 01:34:21	guillaumus	yes, syntax, and word is not same
2016-09-18 01:34:59	archivist	syntax depends on assembler used, risc/cisc depends on architecture
2016-09-18 01:35:56	guillaumus	yes, i would like write for risc processor. I anderstand, it's a reduce instruction ? i hope they a re standart and very srict minimum instruction ?
2016-09-18 01:36:41	archivist	the instructions are defined by the maker of the chip,
2016-09-18 01:36:41		[01:36]
2016-09-18 01:36:46	guillaumus	maybe load, store, jmp, add/sub ?
2016-09-18 01:36:52	guillaumus	aaaa
2016-09-18 01:37:07	archivist	you read the chips instruction set manual
2016-09-18 01:37:37	guillaumus	okay !
2016-09-18 01:37:38	guillaumus	a damn, there would not be a common language that could be found among all risc architectures?
2016-09-18 01:38:14	archivist	no
2016-09-18 01:38:55	archivist	there will be some common instructions on ARM chips
2016-09-18 01:39:31	guillaumus	I thought wrong, I hoped to find simple language like a little lisp. Mas for processor. You see ?
2016-09-18 01:42:42	guillaumus	Perfect, archivist :) i go "RTFM" arm chip :)
2016-09-18 01:42:58	guillaumus	thank's

2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:27:53] syntax and risc/cisc are completely different concepts [11:27:53]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:28:12] you cannot merge them in one question [11:28:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:28:17] yes [11:28:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:28:31] i don't care about syntax [11:28:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:28:50] if i would like write to risc, wich language a must use ? [11:28:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:29:22] I do, I use the syntax the processor maker designed for their chip [11:29:22]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:30:24] language also is a separate concept [11:30:24]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:32:39] yes, it's same like humain language, the idea are identical, but the word change [11:32:39]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:33:10] i can use intel or at&t or ... i can write for cisc or risc ? [11:33:10]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:33:37] but, sur, the mnemonique ou instruction are différent [11:33:37]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:33:57] you are confusing concepts in the same question [11:33:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:34:21] yes, syntax, and word is not same [11:34:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:34:59] syntax depends on assembler used, risc/cisc depends on architecture [11:34:59]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:35:56] yes, i would like write for risc processor. I anderstand, it's a reduce instruction ? i hope they a re standart and very srict minimum instruction ? [11:35:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:36:41] the instructions are defined by the maker of the chip, [11:36:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:36:46] maybe load, store, jmp, add/sub ? [11:36:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:36:52] aaaa [11:36:52]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:37:07] you read the chips instruction set manual [11:37:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:37:37] okay ! [11:37:37]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:37:38] a damn, there would not be a common language that could be found among all risc architectures? [11:37:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:38:14] no [11:38:14]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	archivist	[11:38:55] there will be some common instructions on ARM chips [11:38:55]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:39:31] I thought wrong, I hoped to find simple language like a little lisp. Mas for processor. You see ? [11:39:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:42:42] Perfect, archivist :) i go "RTFM" arm chip :) [11:42:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	guillaumus	[11:42:58] thank's [11:42:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	roxfan	[12:26:10] many renesas chips use very similar syntax [12:26:10]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[17:39:46] http://paste.debian.net/828075/ <-- What's the purpose of the lock orl here? [17:39:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[17:40:08] (this is from musl's code) [17:40:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:46:34] It's a barrier: it inhibits reordering [17:46:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[17:50:46] ggole: that's not what usually is expected from atomic store, right? it's just that musl wants it to be done this way, right? [17:50:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:54:58] Well, that's the top of the stack: the operation isn't atomic in order to protect against other threads writing to the location. [17:54:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:55:16] The only purpose is for the effect on ordering of loads and stores. [17:55:16]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:56:57] Basically it's being used as a cheaper version of mfence. [17:56:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[17:57:02] ggole: why choose rsp specifically? [17:57:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[17:57:44] err.. yeah, that's the register that's guaranteed to point to a valid memory location, right? [17:57:44]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:57:49] Yeah [17:57:49]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:58:00] You're also pretty much guaranteed to have no contention there [17:58:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	roxfan	[17:58:16] btw you could ask for the specific reason in #musl [17:58:16]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[17:58:42] ggole: i see. since each thread has its own stack. [17:58:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[17:59:17] This might be an interesting read http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4232660/which-is-a-better-write-barrier-on-x86-lockaddl-or-xchgl [17:59:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[18:06:04] ggole: so lock; addl ... (or orl)   is more efficient than an sfence? then why provide sfence? [18:06:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[18:07:16] I'm not sure really why the semantics are that way. [18:07:16]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[18:12:55] i suppose the designers just wanted an explicit way to do this - so that in some way more efficiency could be gained (referring to the answer describing the hotspot devs) [18:12:55]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[18:13:18] "on some processors it can introduce false data dependencies" [18:13:18]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[18:18:14] There may be other uses, for things like streaming stores and writes to write-combined memory. [18:18:14]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[18:18:22] I'm not familiar with those details. [18:18:22]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[18:20:08] i see. idk about write-combined memory [18:20:08]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[18:23:32] ggole: am i right in saying - sfence should be better that lock; addl ... if you really want a write barrier, since lock; addl... serializes both reads and writes, which is like an mfence ? [18:23:32]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	ggole	[19:05:26] snyp: maybe. Of course, I don't know which semantics the musl code required. [19:05:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:46	snyp	[19:05:53] ggole: i see. [19:05:53]

2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:30:24] language also is a separate concept [11:30:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:32:39] yes, it's same like humain language, the idea are identical, but the word change [11:32:39]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:33:10] i can use intel or at&t or ... i can write for cisc or risc ? [11:33:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:33:37] but, sur, the mnemonique ou instruction are différent [11:33:37]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:33:57] you are confusing concepts in the same question [11:33:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:34:21] yes, syntax, and word is not same [11:34:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:34:59] syntax depends on assembler used, risc/cisc depends on architecture [11:34:59]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:35:56] yes, i would like write for risc processor. I anderstand, it's a reduce instruction ? i hope they a re standart and very srict minimum instruction ? [11:35:56]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:36:41] the instructions are defined by the maker of the chip, [11:36:41]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:36:46] maybe load, store, jmp, add/sub ? [11:36:46]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:36:52] aaaa [11:36:52]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:37:07] you read the chips instruction set manual [11:37:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:37:37] okay ! [11:37:37]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:37:38] a damn, there would not be a common language that could be found among all risc architectures? [11:37:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:38:14] no [11:38:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	archivist	[11:38:55] there will be some common instructions on ARM chips [11:38:55]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:39:31] I thought wrong, I hoped to find simple language like a little lisp. Mas for processor. You see ? [11:39:31]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:42:42] Perfect, archivist :) i go "RTFM" arm chip :) [11:42:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	guillaumus	[11:42:58] thank's [11:42:58]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	roxfan	[12:26:10] many renesas chips use very similar syntax [12:26:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[17:39:46] http://paste.debian.net/828075/ <-- What's the purpose of the lock orl here? [17:39:46]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[17:40:08] (this is from musl's code) [17:40:08]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:46:34] It's a barrier: it inhibits reordering [17:46:34]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[17:50:46] ggole: that's not what usually is expected from atomic store, right? it's just that musl wants it to be done this way, right? [17:50:46]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:54:58] Well, that's the top of the stack: the operation isn't atomic in order to protect against other threads writing to the location. [17:54:58]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:55:16] The only purpose is for the effect on ordering of loads and stores. [17:55:16]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:56:57] Basically it's being used as a cheaper version of mfence. [17:56:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[17:57:02] ggole: why choose rsp specifically? [17:57:02]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[17:57:44] err.. yeah, that's the register that's guaranteed to point to a valid memory location, right? [17:57:44]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:57:49] Yeah [17:57:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:58:00] You're also pretty much guaranteed to have no contention there [17:58:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	roxfan	[17:58:16] btw you could ask for the specific reason in #musl [17:58:16]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[17:58:42] ggole: i see. since each thread has its own stack. [17:58:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[17:59:17] This might be an interesting read http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4232660/which-is-a-better-write-barrier-on-x86-lockaddl-or-xchgl [17:59:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[18:06:04] ggole: so lock; addl ... (or orl)   is more efficient than an sfence? then why provide sfence? [18:06:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[18:07:16] I'm not sure really why the semantics are that way. [18:07:16]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[18:12:55] i suppose the designers just wanted an explicit way to do this - so that in some way more efficiency could be gained (referring to the answer describing the hotspot devs) [18:12:55]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[18:13:18] "on some processors it can introduce false data dependencies" [18:13:18]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[18:18:14] There may be other uses, for things like streaming stores and writes to write-combined memory. [18:18:14]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[18:18:22] I'm not familiar with those details. [18:18:22]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[18:20:08] i see. idk about write-combined memory [18:20:08]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[18:23:32] ggole: am i right in saying - sfence should be better that lock; addl ... if you really want a write barrier, since lock; addl... serializes both reads and writes, which is like an mfence ? [18:23:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	ggole	[19:05:26] snyp: maybe. Of course, I don't know which semantics the musl code required. [19:05:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:33	snyp	[19:05:53] ggole: i see. [19:05:53]

2016-09-19 02:43:41	guillaumus	[11:33:37] but, sur, the mnemonique ou instruction are différent [11:33:37]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	archivist	[11:33:57] you are confusing concepts in the same question [11:33:57]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	guillaumus	[11:34:21] yes, syntax, and word is not same [11:34:21]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	archivist	[11:34:59] syntax depends on assembler used, risc/cisc depends on architecture [11:34:59]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	guillaumus	[11:35:56] yes, i would like write for risc processor. I anderstand, it's a reduce instruction ? i hope they a re standart and very srict minimum instruction ? [11:35:56]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	archivist	[11:36:41] the instructions are defined by the maker of the chip, [11:36:41]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	guillaumus	[11:36:46] maybe load, store, jmp, add/sub ? [11:36:46]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	guillaumus	[11:36:52] aaaa [11:36:52]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	archivist	[11:37:07] you read the chips instruction set manual [11:37:07]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	guillaumus	[11:37:37] okay ! [11:37:37]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	guillaumus	[11:37:38] a damn, there would not be a common language that could be found among all risc architectures? [11:37:38]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	archivist	[11:38:14] no [11:38:14]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	archivist	[11:38:55] there will be some common instructions on ARM chips [11:38:55]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	guillaumus	[11:39:31] I thought wrong, I hoped to find simple language like a little lisp. Mas for processor. You see ? [11:39:31]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	guillaumus	[11:42:42] Perfect, archivist :) i go "RTFM" arm chip :) [11:42:42]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	guillaumus	[11:42:58] thank's [11:42:58]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	roxfan	[12:26:10] many renesas chips use very similar syntax [12:26:10]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[17:39:46] http://paste.debian.net/828075/ <-- What's the purpose of the lock orl here? [17:39:46]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[17:40:08] (this is from musl's code) [17:40:08]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[17:46:34] It's a barrier: it inhibits reordering [17:46:34]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[17:50:46] ggole: that's not what usually is expected from atomic store, right? it's just that musl wants it to be done this way, right? [17:50:46]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[17:54:58] Well, that's the top of the stack: the operation isn't atomic in order to protect against other threads writing to the location. [17:54:58]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[17:55:16] The only purpose is for the effect on ordering of loads and stores. [17:55:16]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[17:56:57] Basically it's being used as a cheaper version of mfence. [17:56:57]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[17:57:02] ggole: why choose rsp specifically? [17:57:02]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[17:57:44] err.. yeah, that's the register that's guaranteed to point to a valid memory location, right? [17:57:44]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[17:57:49] Yeah [17:57:49]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[17:58:00] You're also pretty much guaranteed to have no contention there [17:58:00]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	roxfan	[17:58:16] btw you could ask for the specific reason in #musl [17:58:16]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[17:58:42] ggole: i see. since each thread has its own stack. [17:58:42]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[17:59:17] This might be an interesting read http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4232660/which-is-a-better-write-barrier-on-x86-lockaddl-or-xchgl [17:59:17]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[18:06:04] ggole: so lock; addl ... (or orl)   is more efficient than an sfence? then why provide sfence? [18:06:04]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[18:07:16] I'm not sure really why the semantics are that way. [18:07:16]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[18:12:55] i suppose the designers just wanted an explicit way to do this - so that in some way more efficiency could be gained (referring to the answer describing the hotspot devs) [18:12:55]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[18:13:18] "on some processors it can introduce false data dependencies" [18:13:18]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[18:18:14] There may be other uses, for things like streaming stores and writes to write-combined memory. [18:18:14]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[18:18:22] I'm not familiar with those details. [18:18:22]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[18:20:08] i see. idk about write-combined memory [18:20:08]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[18:23:32] ggole: am i right in saying - sfence should be better that lock; addl ... if you really want a write barrier, since lock; addl... serializes both reads and writes, which is like an mfence ? [18:23:32]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	ggole	[19:05:26] snyp: maybe. Of course, I don't know which semantics the musl code required. [19:05:26]
2016-09-19 02:43:41	snyp	[19:05:53] ggole: i see. [19:05:53]

2016-09-19 10:42:04	Freze	Is it appropriate to ask a question about llvm here?
2016-09-19 10:42:30	Freze	 How expensive are getelementptr inbounds instructions? e.g;   %3 = getelementptr inbounds %Dotted, %Dotted* %1, i64 0, i32 0
2016-09-19 10:42:31	Freze	<Freze_>                   %4 = load double, double* %3, align 8
2016-09-19 10:42:54	Jester01	I suppose that depends on the target architecture?
2016-09-19 10:42:57	Freze	 for example. I'm trying to decide if it's worth trying to optimize this away
2016-09-19 10:42:57	Freze	 by rewriting my program to not use %Dotted
2016-09-19 10:43:23	Freze	x86_64
2016-09-19 10:44:30	Freze	I can also paste assembly
2016-09-19 10:44:48	Freze	if necessary
2016-09-19 10:44:59	Freze	for me it's easier to understand what's going on with the llvm

2016-09-19 19:55:22	dminuoso	Hi. I've been looking in the Intel Manual Vol. 3 for a while now to find documentation on how (code/data) descriptors in the GDT must look like in IA-32e.
2016-09-19 19:55:41	dminuoso	But so far I haven't found anything.
2016-09-19 19:56:54	sophia7	dminuoso: it should bee there somewhere. Check the other manuals too? Look under memory management maybe
2016-09-19 19:58:07	sophia7	CTRL+F :p

2016-09-19 20:06:29	dminuoso	Figure 3-8 depicts an 8 byte descriptor. According to 3.5.2 the segment descriptors stay 8 byte in 64 bit mode.
2016-09-19 20:06:37	dminuoso	But if you look at figure 3-8, then the Base is only a 32 bit address.
2016-09-19 20:06:49	dminuoso	(Which usually is 0, but I would expect this to be a 64 bit address still)
2016-09-19 20:07:47	dminuoso	I simply don't understand how an 8 byte descriptor could be used in 64 bit mode.
2016-09-19 20:08:02	dminuoso	Since you would need the entire 8 bytes just to describe any possible base.
2016-09-19 20:12:24	sophia7	8 byte descriptor is not used in 64 bit mode
2016-09-19 20:12:38	sophia7	you use 16 bytes in 64-bit mode

2016-09-20 06:52:47	GGMethos	Anyone have a decent guide/tutorial/link showing differences between x86 and MIPS (from an x86 perspective)?
2016-09-20 06:52:54	GGMethos	Would be pretty useful for me :)
2016-09-20 06:56:56	vulture	GGMethos: 32 regs with generally op dst,src1,src2 form instructions. mips has only load/store memory accesses instead of being able to use memory as a parameter. only [reg+offset] form memory addressing. stack exists but nothing implicitly uses it and stack pointer needs to be modified manually as a basic register. no flags, branches generally boil down to much more simplified (e.g. a zero-test)
2016-09-20 06:56:56	vulture	comparison+branch in a single instruction. pretty difficult to use :P

2016-09-20 07:01:55	vulture	stack pointer register ($sp)
2016-09-20 07:02:39	vulture	the layout in memory you can imagine similar to x86, but there's no push/pop instruction. push is done via memory write + update $sp. and pop is done via memory read and update $sp.
2016-09-20 07:03:07	vulture	a "call" instruction writes the return address to the $ra register, which you can either hang onto or "push" to the stack or a temp reg
2016-09-20 07:03:24	vulture	call in mips is jal (jump and link)
2016-09-20 07:03:34	vulture	jr will jump register to return
2016-09-20 07:04:50	GGMethos	alright. I understand a bit more now. thanks

2016-09-20 07:13:21	OxFEEDBACC	when they have not, registers are named uniquely...

2016-09-20 07:14:13	OxFEEDBACC	but on machine code level they are addressed by numbers, nonetheless (or some bit combinations at least, that can be interpreted like numbers)

2016-09-20 08:00:51	asm127	why is it cleaning al though?
2016-09-20 08:00:52	dminuoso	asm127: you could mov $0, %%al instead, but most x86 processors handle xor reg,reg specially so that its a little faster.
2016-09-20 08:01:02	dminuoso	asm127: because xor any,any will always yield 0.

2016-09-20 13:49:43	asm065	Hi guy, I was here earlier asking about a snipet of code, and thought I understood it but realize that I still dont. So could someone help me out again. Here is the snipet. http://pastebin.com/4TpQzeKq What im confused about is why line 6 is even needed. And why there is nothing in the output feild. instead dest is put into the input one.
2016-09-20 13:50:06	Jester01	that's broken code.
2016-09-20 13:50:25	asm065	To give some background, the code takes a string. and uses the start index and end index to get a substring, which it stores into dest.
2016-09-20 13:50:32	Jester01	it will possibly blow up in mysterious ways
2016-09-20 13:50:48	asm065	Jester01: works just fine.
2016-09-20 13:50:52	Jester01	accidental.
2016-09-20 13:51:08	Jester01	it will break under circumstances
2016-09-20 13:51:33	Jester01	it will break the rest of the program, actually.
2016-09-20 13:52:06	asm065	hm, could you please expand on why this is the case
2016-09-20 13:52:17	Jester01	it's changing registers without telling the compiler
2016-09-20 13:52:47	Jester01	to make matters worse, it's changing callee-saved registers
2016-09-20 13:53:38	asm065	Where is it changing registers without telling compiler
2016-09-20 13:53:51	Jester01	movsb and stosb update esi and edi
2016-09-20 13:54:01	asm065	right
2016-09-20 13:54:03	Jester01	also rep updates ecx
2016-09-20 13:54:06	-->	SunnyD (~SunnyD@cpe-72-178-78-211.hot.res.rr.com) has joined ##asm
2016-09-20 13:54:09	asm065	mhmm
2016-09-20 13:54:16	asm065	does the compiler never know this?
2016-09-20 13:54:30	Jester01	nope, the compiler (gcc) does not analyze your asm code
2016-09-20 13:54:40	Jester01	it relies on you to tell the proper inputs, outputs and clobbers
2016-09-20 13:55:13	asm065	I thought it was weird that there were no outputs
2016-09-20 13:55:45	Jester01	that, by itself, is not weird
2016-09-20 13:56:13	asm065	how much dest is put into the input ones there?
2016-09-20 13:56:15	Jester01	obviously it's also changing memory behind the compiler
2016-09-20 13:56:36	Jester01	not sure I understand your question, dest is a pointer
2016-09-20 13:58:00	asm065	So what that code should do is take a substring from src, and store it in dest
2016-09-20 13:58:07	asm065	so shouldnt dest be in output

2016-09-20 13:59:47	Jester01	normally dest is not expected to be changed since it's a pointer
2016-09-20 13:59:58	Jester01	it's only a side effect of this particular asm code that it gets changed
2016-09-20 14:00:27	Jester01	memory pointed to by dest is expected to change, but that by itself is not cause to put it as output
2016-09-20 14:00:34	Jester01	rather, you need to put a "memory" clobber
2016-09-20 14:02:04	asm065	So is the only bad thing about this that it doesnt have clobber list?

2016-09-20 14:03:38	Jester01	yes
2016-09-20 14:03:52	asm065	why does that person clear the eax register?
2016-09-20 14:03:57	asm065	in line 6
2016-09-20 14:04:06	Jester01	to put the terminating zero at the end of the copied string.
2016-09-20 14:04:44	Jester01	could have just done mov $0, (%%edi) instead of xor+stosb
2016-09-20 14:04:49	Jester01	movb
2016-09-20 14:05:25	Jester01	that's probably faster and doesn't clobber eax :)
2016-09-20 14:06:29	Jester01	also this code is inherently unsafe, because it assumes that the source string is at least as long as required
2016-09-20 14:06:52	Jester01	for normal people a simple strncpy is fine

2016-09-20 14:08:05	asm065	i understand how mov $0, (%%edi), would add a terminating 0, but his way of doing it confuses me
2016-09-20 14:08:32	Jester01	well, you know xor zeroes, and stosb just does mov %al, (%%edi); inc %%edi
2016-09-20 14:08:43	Jester01	of course we don't care about that inc
2016-09-20 14:10:27	asm065	isnt the inc important tho?
2016-09-20 14:10:35	Jester01	nope
2016-09-20 14:10:43	Jester01	not in this case, obviously
2016-09-20 14:10:53	asm065	how come?
2016-09-20 14:10:59	Jester01	we just want the zero at the end, we don't care about the pointer being incremented afterwards
2016-09-20 14:11:06	Jester01	we are gonna throw that away
2016-09-20 14:11:46	asm065	right, i thought you were saying it wasnt important ever cuz i knw it reps it
2016-09-20 14:11:55	Jester01	the rep was for movsb only
2016-09-20 14:11:56	asm065	so it would be important at first to inc
2016-09-20 14:12:10	Jester01	and yeah, there it's obviously important
2016-09-20 14:12:25	Jester01	for the final stosb, it's not important because nothing uses it afterwards
2016-09-20 14:12:43	Jester01	it's like  doing *dest=0; dest++;  and never using dest later
2016-09-20 14:12:53	Jester01	so who cares if the ++ is there or not
2016-09-20 14:13:05	asm065	yeah
2016-09-20 14:13:11	asm065	makes sense
2016-09-20 14:14:28	asm065	so where does movsb move the stuff too?
2016-09-20 14:14:37	Jester01	from *esi to *edi
2016-09-20 14:14:46	asm065	ah okie
2016-09-20 14:15:02	asm065	and then stosb does it from edi to dest?
2016-09-20 14:16:20	Jester01	no stosb just writes al into *edi
2016-09-20 14:16:48	asm065	oh
2016-09-20 14:16:54	asm065	so thts whts storing the null?
2016-09-20 14:16:58	Jester01	yes
2016-09-20 14:17:12	asm065	interesting
2016-09-20 14:17:51	asm065	does stosb use eax by default?
2016-09-20 14:18:09	Jester01	al, yes.
2016-09-20 14:18:19	asm065	right sorry
2016-09-20 14:18:19		[14:18]
2016-09-20 14:19:12	asm065	wow youre making this very easy to understand thanks so much
2016-09-20 14:20:00	asm065	question i noticed that the count doesnt work as intended in the sense that it gives 1 iteration more than it has to
2016-09-20 14:20:12	asm065	so lets say your starting index is 2 and ending index is 3
2016-09-20 14:20:27	asm065	it copies every character in the string from index 2 to 4
2016-09-20 14:20:34	asm065	doesnt stop at 3
2016-09-20 14:20:36	asm065	why is that
2016-09-20 14:20:39	Jester01	this function takes a count argument ... how you calculate it is up to you.
2016-09-20 14:21:15	asm065	every time you movsb it inc count right?
2016-09-20 14:21:17	Jester01	there is no "ending index" here.
2016-09-20 14:21:28	asm065	sorry the ending index would be count
2016-09-20 14:21:31	Jester01	it decrements the count.
2016-09-20 14:21:38	Jester01	and no, count is not an index.
2016-09-20 14:21:47	Jester01	it's a count.
2016-09-20 14:21:55	Jester01	if it's 3, that means copy 3 bytes
2016-09-20 14:22:08	Jester01	and if the start is 2, then yes, that means copy 2,3,4
2016-09-20 14:22:22	asm065	ohhh
2016-09-20 14:23:37	asm065	wow this makes so much sense now
2016-09-20 14:23:54	asm065	so i just need to make sure i add a clobber list
2016-09-20 14:24:31	asm065	otherwise compiler will never know
2016-09-20 14:25:02	Jester01	clobber for eax, and possibly dummy output for esi and edi (some compiler versions don't allow clobber for inputs)
2016-09-20 14:25:20	Jester01	or, you know, just turn this into C :)
2016-09-20 14:26:47	asm065	Yeah it def would be easier to do this in C, but im jus trying to learn inline assembly so i thought this simple exercise would be good practice x3
2016-09-20 14:26:56	Jester01	okay :)
2016-09-20 14:27:12	Jester01	1st rule of inline asm: avoid if you can :)
2016-09-20 14:27:33	asm065	Yeah I hear that a lot xD
2016-09-20 14:27:35	Jester01	(applies to gcc inline asm more than other types)
2016-09-20 14:28:11	asm065	btw is it rly needed to add eax to clobber list if i use the mov instead or xor? i thought you said mov wouldnt clobber it
2016-09-20 14:28:28	Jester01	right, if you use the mov then you don't need to list eax
2016-09-20 14:29:36	asm065	what would be an example of a dummy output?
2016-09-20 14:29:49	asm065	just randomly add like ecx?
2016-09-20 14:29:55	Jester01	no :)
2016-09-20 14:30:27	Jester01	since your variables are local and not used, you can write the values back
2016-09-20 14:31:02	Jester01	such as "=S" (src), "=D" (dest), "=c" (count)
2016-09-20 14:31:22	Jester01	for dest and count you could use read-write constraint
2016-09-20 14:31:51	asm065	wouldnt it be better to do s_idx and count only ?

2016-09-20 14:36:26	asm065	So you're saying we load dest into edi. meaning edi now points to dest no? so when we do movsb, it moves the stuff from esi to edi. which also means dest also gets written back to no?
2016-09-20 14:36:45	Jester01	no, edi points to wherever dest pointed to
2016-09-20 14:36:51	Jester01	it does not point to dest
2016-09-20 14:36:54	Jester01	dest itself is loaded.
2016-09-20 14:36:56	Jester01	edi=dest
2016-09-20 14:37:04	asm065	yes sorry thats what i meant
2016-09-20 14:37:05	Jester01	it's not edi=&dest
2016-09-20 14:37:42	Jester01	movsb increments the pointers, and copies memory.
2016-09-20 14:37:57	Jester01	also, the compiler still has no idea that happened unless you tell it

2016-09-20 14:42:12	asm065	oh i think im begining to understand now
2016-09-20 14:42:16	asm065	okay
2016-09-20 14:42:32	Jester01	as I said, some compiler versions (maybe clang? IDK) do allow for clobbered inputs
2016-09-20 14:42:33	asm065	so i can either add edi to clobber list to let compiler know or just put it in the output
2016-09-20 14:43:00	Jester01	outputs work always, but a little more typing :)
2016-09-20 14:43:12	Jester01	clobber may or may not be accepted by your compiler
2016-09-20 14:43:21	asm065	gotcha ill do output to be safe :)

2016-09-20 14:46:10	Jester01	delete the stosb
2016-09-20 14:46:20	Jester01	and the mov should be movb

2016-09-20 14:47:49	Jester01	that was the whole point of adding it ;)

2016-09-20 14:52:28	Jester01	yes
2016-09-20 14:55:56	asm065	Jester01: how come Movsb requires a memory clobber but ordinary mov doesnt?
2016-09-20 14:56:51	Jester01	who said it didn't :)
2016-09-20 14:57:11	Jester01	if you randomly write into memory using whatever means, you need a memory clobber
2016-09-20 14:57:35	Jester01	otherwise the compiler might be caching an old value somewhere (unlikely, but can happen)
2016-09-20 14:58:42	asm065	ah that makes sense, but you said movb $0, (%%edi) doesnt require clobber is that because edi is a stack?
2016-09-20 14:59:02	Jester01	the code does not require the eax clobber if you use that instead of the xor
2016-09-20 14:59:08	Jester01	because you don't change eax

2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[00:47:54] sorry [00:47:54]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[00:48:19] direction flag must be clear at function entry, but if it isn't and you change it, all hell will break loose anyway [00:48:19]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[00:48:23] i think i jus did whts called zoned out xD [00:48:23]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[00:52:22] Jester01: Is memory clobber really just as simple as writing "memory" [00:52:22]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[00:52:27] yes [00:52:27]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[00:55:55] Jester01: how come Movsb requires a memory clobber but ordinary mov doesnt? [00:55:55]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[00:56:50] who said it didn't :) [00:56:50]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[00:57:10] if you randomly write into memory using whatever means, you need a memory clobber [00:57:10]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[00:57:34] otherwise the compiler might be caching an old value somewhere (unlikely, but can happen) [00:57:34]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[00:58:41] ah that makes sense, but you said movb $0, (%%edi) doesnt require clobber is that because edi is a stack? [00:58:41]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[00:59:01] the code does not require the eax clobber if you use that instead of the xor [00:59:01]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[00:59:07] because you don't change eax [00:59:07]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[00:59:15] oh [00:59:15]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[00:59:41] okay i now understand this [00:59:41]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[00:59:48] i should write this all down [00:59:48]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[00:59:59] it still needs the memory clobber, but you only need to list that once and so you are covered [00:59:59]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:00:26] C is starting to look more and more beautiful [01:00:26]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:06:45] seem to get a seg fault intereting [01:06:45]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:09:02] in 64 bit mode accidentally? :) [01:09:02]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:10:06] nope :o, a random part of my other code is seg faulting now even tho it worked before xD [01:10:06]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:10:26] i must have done something wrong [01:10:26]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:24:55] Jester01: Seems to seg fault at the start of the asm code also [01:24:55]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:26:03] Jester01: http://pastebin.com/bP0AD29R [01:26:03]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:26:20] that IS 64 bit mode! [01:26:20]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:26:58] change movb $0, (%%edi) to movb $0, (%%rdi) [01:26:58]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:27:26] better yet, change it to movb $0, (%1) [01:27:26]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:27:35] then it will work in 32 and 64 bit both [01:27:35]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:27:51] oh crap i forgot i was using the wrong virtual machine [01:27:51]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:29:49] by the way, the debug info for inline asm is not line accurate, you need to disasm the actual address to see the faulting instruction [01:29:49]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:31:07] could you explain the %1 [01:31:07]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:31:20] argument 1 [01:31:20]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:32:04] i thought argument 1 was src [01:32:04]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:32:13] we count from 0 ;) [01:32:13]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:32:38] ah that makes sense x3 [01:32:38]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:34:27] Jester01: Hm when i print dest in the main it comes up empty now [01:34:27]

2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:40:15] ah something is broken [01:40:15]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:40:49] you removed the volatile [01:40:49]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:41:06] whoops it works [01:41:06]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:41:09] i compild wrong one [01:41:09]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:41:17] is the volatile needed? [01:41:17]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:41:19] yes. [01:41:19]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:41:31] turn optimization on, and you'll see it's needed :) [01:41:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:42:19] Okay lemme try brb ^_^ [01:42:19]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	Jester01	[01:42:47] contrary to popular belief, I do need to sleep, so cya! :) [01:42:47]
2016-09-20 18:53:12	asm065	[01:44:29] Jester01: Sleep well! thanks so much! <3 [01:44:29]

2016-09-20 23:22:19	yuta_	is there anyway to compile that code in gcc or i need to translate the code to intel syntax?
2016-09-20 23:23:53	boru	You can specify a flag to gcc/gas to instruct it to use intel syntax, or you can use an assembler directive in your listing.
2016-09-20 23:24:14	yuta_	do you know what flag is it?
2016-09-20 23:24:25	<--	XOCK_STREAM (~XOCKET@unaffiliated/xocket) has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
2016-09-20 23:24:46	boru	`-masm=intel` iirc. It's in the documentation.
2016-09-20 23:25:21	boru	And the directive is `.intel_syntax` or something like that. I haven't touched any intel code in a long time, so it may have changed.
2016-09-20 23:30:22	yuta_	this will work?
2016-09-20 23:30:24	yuta_		asm 	(".intel_syntax noprefix\       MOV eax, dword ptr[chatinfo]\       MOV ecx, dword ptr[eax]\       PUSH 0\       PUSH textColor\       PUSH 0\       PUSH text\       PUSH 8\       CALL func");
2016-09-20 23:31:24	archivist	try it!
2016-09-20 23:31:32	boru	You're probably better enforcing via your build system, else that code will not compile with an assembler which doesn't understand `.intel_syntax`

2016-09-21 12:41:33	GeDaMo	[15:01:21] 80 bit decimal? [15:01:21]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	slavanap	[15:02:17] looks like found one description here http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-manual-325462.pdf [15:02:17]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	slavanap	[15:02:24] GeDaMo, yes. [15:02:24]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	GeDaMo	[15:02:32] I only see m80bcd in relation to fbstp [15:02:32]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	slavanap	[15:03:43] GeDaMo, than what is m80bcd representation and limits? [15:03:43]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	GeDaMo	[15:04:20] "18-digit packed BCD integer" [15:04:20]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	GeDaMo	[15:04:51] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal#Packed_BCD [15:04:51]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	slavanap	[15:05:50] GeDaMo, I wonder about exponent representation actually. For instance, how 0.001f would look in BCD. [15:05:50]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	slavanap	[15:06:48] GeDaMo, or FBSTP just using integer part of the float? [15:06:48]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	slavanap	[15:11:02] agh. I haven't used pure asm for so long. Never setup it in MSVS2015. First time is always hard [15:11:02]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	slavanap	[15:19:36] GeDaMo, `FBSTP DWORD PTR [EAX]` fails with invalid operand size. How to define pointer to ten bytes? (simlar to DT) ? [15:19:36]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	slavanap	[15:26:39] How to day TENBYTES PTR [EAX] in MASM. What I should replace TENBYTES WITH? [15:26:39]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	slavanap	[15:32:36] FOUND IT. REAL10 PTR [15:32:36]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	slavanap	[15:34:58] GeDaMo, yes, FBSTP converts to bcd only integer part of the float. [15:34:58]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	Guest5316	[19:09:17] ? [19:09:17]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	GeDaMo	[19:09:26] ! [19:09:26]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	kaos	[19:46:20] !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [19:46:20]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	AverageJ0e	[20:06:03] vulture, https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cs5zWjIUsAAxqs6.jpg [20:06:03]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	AverageJ0e	[20:06:23] see what they're doing? rdtsc, jump to self [20:06:23]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	roxfan	[20:07:39] probably detecting emulators or tracing [20:07:39]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	roxfan	[20:09:27] too many cycles between two rdtsc ->infinite loop [20:09:27]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	AverageJ0e	[20:10:57] so it turns out theres more than 1 way to jump to self in 2 bytes. I thought there was only eb fe, but theres 7f fe, 7c fe, [20:10:57]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	AverageJ0e	[20:10:59] makes sense [20:10:59]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	AverageJ0e	[20:12:39] i guess 7e would work too [20:12:39]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	AverageJ0e	[20:12:53] wheres that damn intel opcode manual when i need one? [20:12:53]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	GeDaMo	[20:13:57] http://sandpile.org/ ? [20:13:57]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	roxfan	[20:17:24] well, jg etc. only works if the flags are set up accordingly [20:17:24]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	roxfan	[20:17:40] eb fe works in any situation [20:17:40]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	kaos	[20:18:15] you mean c3 99 [20:18:15]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	AverageJ0e	[20:18:16] eb, e9, e8 [20:18:16]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	kaos	[20:18:21] 23 0e [20:18:21]
2016-09-21 12:41:33	Freze_	[20:18:41] For example take `x + 1` where x is a float is the additional instruction to convert 1 to a float `vcvtsi2sdq` [20:18:41]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Freze_	[20:18:56] expensive [20:18:56]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Freze_	[20:20:20] under -O3  I still have the additional instruction [20:20:20]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	GeDaMo	[20:21:00] Try x + 1.0 [20:21:00]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	GeDaMo	[20:21:16] Or x + 1f [20:21:16]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Freze_	[20:21:20] The question is if that's a worth optimization [20:21:20]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Freze_	[20:21:34] I.e. is the `vcvtsi2sdq`  instruction expensive enough to warrant a change? [20:21:34]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Freze_	[20:21:43] for numerics [20:21:43]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	AverageJ0e	[20:22:13] lets see...if i do a hex replace of 7f fe with 90 90, let's see if im as smart as i think i am [20:22:13]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	roxfan	[20:22:59] if it's stupid but works, it's not stupid [20:22:59]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	AverageJ0e	[20:23:35] i need that on a shirt roxfan [20:23:35]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	Freze_	[20:23:36] haha I love that [20:23:36]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	roxfan	[20:25:11] AverageJ0e: zazzle or whatever [20:25:11]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	AverageJ0e	[20:45:38] the fuck is this? https://files.catbox.moe/yrl5ey.PNG [20:45:38]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	AverageJ0e	[20:46:35] loop is contingent on ecx for count, where is it set? [20:46:35]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	vulture	[21:00:59] AverageJ0e: looks like standard anti-singlestep-code [21:00:59]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	vulture	[21:01:06] on your first pic [21:01:06]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	AverageJ0e	[21:01:16] welcome [21:01:16]
2016-09-21 12:41:34	vulture	[21:01:32] ecx probably set by caller [21:01:32]
