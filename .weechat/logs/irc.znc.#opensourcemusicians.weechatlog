2016-09-16 01:33:46	JackWinter	leebre: you mean kernel 4.6.7 etc?
2016-09-16 01:33:56	leebre	yes
2016-09-16 01:33:58	leebre	;)
2016-09-16 01:34:12	leebre	but we are now at 3.7 heading towards 3.8 next week maybe
2016-09-16 01:34:14	JackWinter	I really don't know.  There is just a patch out for 4.6.7-rt13, am about to boot into that one.
2016-09-16 01:34:24	leebre	i am allreeady running that
2016-09-16 01:34:39	leebre	i can confirm it builds, installs and runs fine hehehe

2016-09-16 01:34:50	leebre	running in now on 3 laptops
2016-09-16 01:34:52	leebre	it
2016-09-16 01:35:16	leebre	question would be, in the past,there were only rt patches for the even, or ?
2016-09-16 01:35:32	leebre	so, next rt patches would be for 3.8, right ?
2016-09-16 01:36:00	JackWinter	for what comes in the future i don't really know.  i think i read somewhere that 4.9 will be a lts, so it's possible they hold off until that one comes out..
2016-09-16 01:36:54	leebre	i am steppin out now, i think i am not interrsted in kernels higher then 4.7
2016-09-16 01:37:17	JackWinter	i don't understad the 3.7 3.8 that you keep writing?
2016-09-16 01:37:18	leebre	right we are at 4 now, still writing 3 hehehehe i mean v3 is not too long ago hehehe
2016-09-16 01:37:21	leebre	yeah
2016-09-16 01:37:23	leebre	mistake
2016-09-16 01:37:27	leebre	its 4.7
2016-09-16 01:37:36	leebre	i forgot that we are at 4 now hehehe

2016-09-16 01:38:45	leebre	thanks, but i will stay at 4.67-rt13 because it runs great here, really
2016-09-16 01:38:45	JackWinter	or just stay with 4.6.7-rt13 if that works good for you
2016-09-16 01:38:49	leebre	yeah
2016-09-16 01:39:02	leebre	that is good, all others were good too, though you named regressions
2016-09-16 01:39:23	leebre	i pimped a lil the aur build script hehehe
2016-09-16 01:39:45	leebre	no numa, no 686 configs....
2016-09-16 01:39:57	JackWinter	don't know if you have any nvidia, there is some problem due to changes in kernel, so driver for 4.6 don't work for 4.7, etc.  but maybe they've patched that in the nvidia driver already so that it works on all kernels
2016-09-16 01:40:15	leebre	i am staying away from nvidia and amd/ati
2016-09-16 01:40:26	JackWinter	since you probably don't have a numa capable machine, i don't know how that will help ;)
2016-09-16 01:40:44	leebre	its a patch less that is applied i guess, thats all
2016-09-16 01:41:12	JackWinter	ok, i don't see the point, but each to his own
2016-09-16 01:41:30	leebre	i know i am totally wrong, and i am surely dontknow what i am doing but show me some one who knows exactly in detail how any aspects of his life has impacts on anything related
2016-09-16 01:41:43	JackWinter	maybe you'll turn up some bug as you're probably all alone with such a config ;)
2016-09-16 01:42:14	JackWinter	no one knows that, that's for sure.  some people are more awake than others though ;)
2016-09-16 01:42:51	JackWinter	jack 0.125.0 is out too, if you want some fun
2016-09-16 01:43:19	JackWinter	fixes a few things, no more negative xruns, and it properly reports latency to clients.
2016-09-16 01:43:45	leebre	i want fun hehehe
2016-09-16 01:44:20	JackWinter	there is also a fix for wineasio on https://github.com/jhernberg/wineasio, it now also reports correct latency from jack to reaper ;)
2016-09-16 01:44:34	leebre	and now jack 2 alsa  sequencer midi works ??? never could get that bridge runnin to connect for example drumgizmo with qtractor...
2016-09-16 01:44:43	leebre	cool
2016-09-16 01:44:55	JackWinter	thinking of splitting up the wineasio pkgbuild too, one wineasio and a lib32-wineasio
2016-09-16 01:45:00	leebre	wineasio is rock stable hehehe
2016-09-16 01:45:18	leebre	to get rid of multilib repo, i dont need that anymore hehehe
2016-09-16 01:45:19	JackWinter	don't think much happens with jack2 anymore...
2016-09-16 01:45:44	leebre	what do you mean??? no further developmnt on jack2 ?
2016-09-16 01:45:44		[01:45]
2016-09-16 01:45:56	JackWinter	yeah, i don't think wineasio's callback can be improved, it can't really get faster than it is
2016-09-16 01:46:25	JackWinter	there hasn't been much more than the occasional bug fix for years now.  several things broken in jack2..
2016-09-16 01:46:52	leebre	kay, so jack2, the future became the past hehehe
2016-09-16 01:47:01	JackWinter	for jack1, paul davies just stepped down, and falktx is becoming the new maintainer, so hopefully we'll see new stuff
2016-09-16 01:47:04	leebre	everything is breaking
2016-09-16 01:47:18	leebre	i am reading smart people analyzing that claiming systemd mostly for all that
2016-09-16 01:47:46	leebre	from problems with alsa over dbus and anything else hehehe, maybe i am just reading wrong stuff from right peopl ehehehehe
2016-09-16 01:48:00	JackWinter	beh, some things work well and are smart, but other really suck with systemd (depending on your point of view)
2016-09-16 01:48:13	leebre	somehow, here, again, EVERYTHING is running perfect, there is not even a lil edge
2016-09-16 01:48:39	leebre	everything, nothing left, time to live!
2016-09-16 01:48:40	JackWinter	time for reboot

2016-09-16 01:53:10	leebre	but arch linux and openrc works best here, and it dont even works best, i think others havin much trouble, though still using opensource/gnu and linux, still experiencing troubles.....

2016-09-16 02:02:40	JazzyEagle	Still waking up.
2016-09-16 02:03:42	leebre	i invented some nice methods  for wakin up, because  i experienced in the past that sometimes i didnt really waked up and noticed that when driving with the car on the freeway
2016-09-16 02:03:52	JazzyEagle	lol
2016-09-16 02:04:06	leebre	really bad, when drivin on the freeway and you are noticing, shit, i am quite sleeping hehehe
2016-09-16 02:04:41	leebre	good thoughts for waking up are ugly, dangerous and kinky thoughts...
2016-09-16 02:07:17	leebre	do you all have linux audio meetings in your town ???  where is your next linux audio group located ???
2016-09-16 02:07:30	JazzyEagle	For driving, I have to keep switching up what I listen to.
2016-09-16 02:08:11	JazzyEagle	leebre: Not sure there are any around me.  Linux isn't as popular here in the states, unfortunately.  There are Linux meetups, but for me, I'd have to drive to one of the cities, which is a minimum of 45 minutes away, and they're not audio specific.
2016-09-16 02:08:25	leebre	there are linux audio meetings in the town i am livin in, cologne...

2016-09-16 02:10:36	leebre	maybe this is unique in europe...do not know
2016-09-16 02:11:03	JazzyEagle	I don't think it's necessarily unique, but it is definitely more popular there.
2016-09-16 02:11:07	leebre	i am not a great come together guy, but i really think this is great, a group of people dedicated to linux audio, meeting from time to time in real!
2016-09-16 02:13:01	leebre	i might leave germany and move to east europe, though i dont like the mntality there, but its not so different fromgermany partiots...

2016-09-16 03:32:37	JazzyEagle	I thought the package names for debian were jack & jack2.
2016-09-16 03:32:39	JazzyEagle	Hrmm..
2016-09-16 03:32:53	JazzyEagle	I'm not much of a debian pro.  This may be better for someone else to look at.
2016-09-16 03:37:53	leebre	there is a change now with dbus i think, now its somehow split packages, andoneis a X11 dbus package that automatically starts dbus when X session is started...maybe thats related to that
2016-09-16 03:40:46	leebre	ooop, i didnt got the job, had a wierd call with the HR manager, mmhhh.....i felt a turning point now, i was honestabout my past and it seemed people talked bad about me ...i mean i told himi had a bad time and that i mastered alcoholism, depression and overweight and that before that tme, i also worked int he industry and maybe some one talked bad about me because he remeberd me from that time...

2016-09-16 06:44:50	holstein	oh yeah. the kernel is *very* responsive
2016-09-16 06:44:57	holstein	before, i would just hit the button, and nothing..
2016-09-16 06:45:19	holstein	i had to take the hard drive to another box, and chroot in, to do the upgrade.. no responsiveness..
2016-09-16 06:45:25	holstein	but, *now*!.. its like magic
2016-09-16 06:45:36	leebre	right hehehehe, and now i am so fast that the illuminati have allready called three times, but i told them my girlfriend is not well right now
2016-09-16 06:45:39	holstein	magic.lib is finally where it needs to be.. all you have to do is believe..
2016-09-16 06:45:53	leebre	no i donthave to believe anymore
2016-09-16 06:45:57	leebre	just breathe
2016-09-16 06:47:00	leebre	iam starting now making some videos, with insane latencys and configs and performance sessions...all on old laptop hehehe
2016-09-16 06:47:13	JackWinter	leebre: i doubt that there is any real change that affects any of us...
2016-09-16 06:47:23	holstein	oh yeah! thats where its at!
2016-09-16 06:47:24	leebre	its all perception
2016-09-16 06:47:49	holstein	i mean, new computers are a fraction of the cost, but, its all about getting a P3 and doing professional production work
2016-09-16 06:47:53	leebre	if we wouldnt al agree on that flying cangaroo, science would say, if we havent seen it, it doesnt exist
2016-09-16 06:48:11	holstein	oh!, and the years of one's time, spent, configuring... a bargain!
2016-09-16 06:48:26	leebre	allways invest in yourself
2016-09-16 06:48:36	leebre	you can do that by living each second like it were tzh
2016-09-16 06:48:39	leebre	the last
2016-09-16 06:49:00	leebre	not one second wasted here, enjoyed everything
2016-09-16 06:49:00	holstein	when i hire a professional.. if they have more than one core? i just laugh and say to myself.. "theres a person who doesnt know how to configure old hardware" and i leave the office..
2016-09-16 06:49:20	holstein	and, thats really all that matters. that they can take an old box, and get low latency..
2016-09-16 06:49:34	holstein	who cares how they sound...
2016-09-16 06:49:35	leebre	not neccessarily
2016-09-16 06:49:40	leebre	no one cares
2016-09-16 06:49:44	leebre	most people are deaf
2016-09-16 06:49:55	holstein	right.. its *all* about latency, on old hardware
2016-09-16 06:50:03	leebre	those who are not deaf are quite sure about their listening habbits
2016-09-16 06:50:12	holstein	i look for it posted on their linkden profiles..
2016-09-16 06:50:23	leebre	but sure music is important, yes
2016-09-16 06:50:45	holstein	i look for "pentium3, with super low latency".. i dont listen to any samples..
2016-09-16 06:51:17	leebre	i reached ny goal and i am happy as a child
2016-09-16 06:51:47	leebre	having a fast, low latency , full responsive xrun free system makes me sing again
2016-09-16 06:51:58	holstein	oh yeah.. its all that matters.. i know
2016-09-16 06:52:11	leebre	never said that, you surely know that

2016-09-16 06:53:18	holstein	i mean, if you are trying to make art, or music.. latency and xruns is all that matters

2016-09-16 06:53:58	holstein	nah.. im just being an asshole. im not putting words in your mouth. im just saying things to be an ass
2016-09-16 06:54:02	leebre	i am playing soli on bass, tapping slapping poppin, you name it, i wil play it....and yes, having a fast system helps alot, at least it helps me alot
2016-09-16 06:54:09	leebre	you are not an asshole at all
2016-09-16 06:54:13	leebre	but what should i do
2016-09-16 06:54:26	leebre	saying that all i did and al i believed in is wrong ?
2016-09-16 06:54:48	holstein	is it?
2016-09-16 06:55:00	leebre	it is not
2016-09-16 06:55:06	leebre	if it is , its by random choice
2016-09-16 06:55:08	holstein	if the "faster system" (which is not any faster, just configured differently) is helping you, *great*!
2016-09-16 06:55:23	holstein	why not make some art now?
2016-09-16 06:55:24	leebre	it helps me a lil yes
2016-09-16 06:55:28	leebre	yeah, maybe today
2016-09-16 06:55:34	holstein	yup.. maybe..
2016-09-16 06:55:45	leebre	i am maybe ...i dont like pressure
2016-09-16 06:56:15	leebre	 am saying maybe and suprise you in a positive way is better then saying yes and suprising in a negative way
2016-09-16 06:56:41	leebre	but yes, latency is not such a big issue
2016-09-16 06:56:51	leebre	(nor for me , anymore)
2016-09-16 06:57:00	leebre	now for me anymore hehehe
2016-09-16 06:57:20	leebre	but i had to get there firsdt to know that
2016-09-16 06:57:30	leebre	you could have told me before,like al people told me before
2016-09-16 06:57:46	leebre	like probably all people told you before, when you did not listen ;)
2016-09-16 06:58:00	leebre	and i am not listen too...i like to make experiences
2016-09-16 06:58:01	holstein	well, i did it a bit differently
2016-09-16 06:58:23	leebre	sure hehehe
2016-09-16 06:58:25	leebre	;)
2016-09-16 06:58:42	leebre	for a hobby musician, i am quite happy and satisfied
2016-09-16 06:59:02	leebre	no fear, no pressure but endless oportunities and fun

2016-09-16 07:06:48	nstewart	wondering if I can find any in town.
2016-09-16 07:06:53	leebre	normally, they aregivin the cheap thermal grease with the fan

2016-09-16 07:23:22	JackWinter	someone did a study on the thermal properties of tothpaste and it came out just as good.  though they thought it might dry out and change properties over time
2016-09-16 07:26:04	leebre	and that is what any paste or pad does, too, over time
2016-09-16 07:26:56	leebre	i would use the bundled fan first, it may be quiet, too, i would be curious and would use the situation, that i cant install the quiet fan
2016-09-16 07:27:24	leebre	the fan situation has gone insane, i think
2016-09-16 07:27:50	leebre	you get coolers that are far out of specifications
2016-09-16 07:28:22	leebre	800 gramm or very tall
2016-09-16 07:28:22		[07:28]
2016-09-16 07:29:17	leebre	and latest intel cpu i guess are very optimized concerning thermal power and energy performance ratio
2016-09-16 07:30:05	leebre	most important i guess is if its pwm or not...never was able to configure the fans on linux myself
2016-09-16 07:31:24	leebre	okay, cheapest solution would be eight core amd...but then there must be much money spent on silent coolers, silent power suplies and case
2016-09-16 07:32:27	leebre	i am very happy with old intel laptops, thats the solution for me...
2016-09-16 07:34:08	nstewart	that's what this is -  8 core amd with a quiet fan
