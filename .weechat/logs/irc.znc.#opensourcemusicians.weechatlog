2016-09-16 01:33:46	JackWinter	leebre: you mean kernel 4.6.7 etc?
2016-09-16 01:33:56	leebre	yes
2016-09-16 01:33:58	leebre	;)
2016-09-16 01:34:12	leebre	but we are now at 3.7 heading towards 3.8 next week maybe
2016-09-16 01:34:14	JackWinter	I really don't know.  There is just a patch out for 4.6.7-rt13, am about to boot into that one.
2016-09-16 01:34:24	leebre	i am allreeady running that
2016-09-16 01:34:39	leebre	i can confirm it builds, installs and runs fine hehehe

2016-09-16 01:34:50	leebre	running in now on 3 laptops
2016-09-16 01:34:52	leebre	it
2016-09-16 01:35:16	leebre	question would be, in the past,there were only rt patches for the even, or ?
2016-09-16 01:35:32	leebre	so, next rt patches would be for 3.8, right ?
2016-09-16 01:36:00	JackWinter	for what comes in the future i don't really know.  i think i read somewhere that 4.9 will be a lts, so it's possible they hold off until that one comes out..
2016-09-16 01:36:54	leebre	i am steppin out now, i think i am not interrsted in kernels higher then 4.7
2016-09-16 01:37:17	JackWinter	i don't understad the 3.7 3.8 that you keep writing?
2016-09-16 01:37:18	leebre	right we are at 4 now, still writing 3 hehehehe i mean v3 is not too long ago hehehe
2016-09-16 01:37:21	leebre	yeah
2016-09-16 01:37:23	leebre	mistake
2016-09-16 01:37:27	leebre	its 4.7
2016-09-16 01:37:36	leebre	i forgot that we are at 4 now hehehe

2016-09-16 01:38:45	leebre	thanks, but i will stay at 4.67-rt13 because it runs great here, really
2016-09-16 01:38:45	JackWinter	or just stay with 4.6.7-rt13 if that works good for you
2016-09-16 01:38:49	leebre	yeah
2016-09-16 01:39:02	leebre	that is good, all others were good too, though you named regressions
2016-09-16 01:39:23	leebre	i pimped a lil the aur build script hehehe
2016-09-16 01:39:45	leebre	no numa, no 686 configs....
2016-09-16 01:39:57	JackWinter	don't know if you have any nvidia, there is some problem due to changes in kernel, so driver for 4.6 don't work for 4.7, etc.  but maybe they've patched that in the nvidia driver already so that it works on all kernels
2016-09-16 01:40:15	leebre	i am staying away from nvidia and amd/ati
2016-09-16 01:40:26	JackWinter	since you probably don't have a numa capable machine, i don't know how that will help ;)
2016-09-16 01:40:44	leebre	its a patch less that is applied i guess, thats all
2016-09-16 01:41:12	JackWinter	ok, i don't see the point, but each to his own
2016-09-16 01:41:30	leebre	i know i am totally wrong, and i am surely dontknow what i am doing but show me some one who knows exactly in detail how any aspects of his life has impacts on anything related
2016-09-16 01:41:43	JackWinter	maybe you'll turn up some bug as you're probably all alone with such a config ;)
2016-09-16 01:42:14	JackWinter	no one knows that, that's for sure.  some people are more awake than others though ;)
2016-09-16 01:42:51	JackWinter	jack 0.125.0 is out too, if you want some fun
2016-09-16 01:43:19	JackWinter	fixes a few things, no more negative xruns, and it properly reports latency to clients.
2016-09-16 01:43:45	leebre	i want fun hehehe
2016-09-16 01:44:20	JackWinter	there is also a fix for wineasio on https://github.com/jhernberg/wineasio, it now also reports correct latency from jack to reaper ;)
2016-09-16 01:44:34	leebre	and now jack 2 alsa  sequencer midi works ??? never could get that bridge runnin to connect for example drumgizmo with qtractor...
2016-09-16 01:44:43	leebre	cool
2016-09-16 01:44:55	JackWinter	thinking of splitting up the wineasio pkgbuild too, one wineasio and a lib32-wineasio
2016-09-16 01:45:00	leebre	wineasio is rock stable hehehe
2016-09-16 01:45:18	leebre	to get rid of multilib repo, i dont need that anymore hehehe
2016-09-16 01:45:19	JackWinter	don't think much happens with jack2 anymore...
2016-09-16 01:45:44	leebre	what do you mean??? no further developmnt on jack2 ?
2016-09-16 01:45:44		[01:45]
2016-09-16 01:45:56	JackWinter	yeah, i don't think wineasio's callback can be improved, it can't really get faster than it is
2016-09-16 01:46:25	JackWinter	there hasn't been much more than the occasional bug fix for years now.  several things broken in jack2..
2016-09-16 01:46:52	leebre	kay, so jack2, the future became the past hehehe
2016-09-16 01:47:01	JackWinter	for jack1, paul davies just stepped down, and falktx is becoming the new maintainer, so hopefully we'll see new stuff
2016-09-16 01:47:04	leebre	everything is breaking
2016-09-16 01:47:18	leebre	i am reading smart people analyzing that claiming systemd mostly for all that
2016-09-16 01:47:46	leebre	from problems with alsa over dbus and anything else hehehe, maybe i am just reading wrong stuff from right peopl ehehehehe
2016-09-16 01:48:00	JackWinter	beh, some things work well and are smart, but other really suck with systemd (depending on your point of view)
2016-09-16 01:48:13	leebre	somehow, here, again, EVERYTHING is running perfect, there is not even a lil edge
2016-09-16 01:48:39	leebre	everything, nothing left, time to live!
2016-09-16 01:48:40	JackWinter	time for reboot

2016-09-16 01:53:10	leebre	but arch linux and openrc works best here, and it dont even works best, i think others havin much trouble, though still using opensource/gnu and linux, still experiencing troubles.....

2016-09-16 02:02:40	JazzyEagle	Still waking up.
2016-09-16 02:03:42	leebre	i invented some nice methods  for wakin up, because  i experienced in the past that sometimes i didnt really waked up and noticed that when driving with the car on the freeway
2016-09-16 02:03:52	JazzyEagle	lol
2016-09-16 02:04:06	leebre	really bad, when drivin on the freeway and you are noticing, shit, i am quite sleeping hehehe
2016-09-16 02:04:41	leebre	good thoughts for waking up are ugly, dangerous and kinky thoughts...
2016-09-16 02:07:17	leebre	do you all have linux audio meetings in your town ???  where is your next linux audio group located ???
2016-09-16 02:07:30	JazzyEagle	For driving, I have to keep switching up what I listen to.
2016-09-16 02:08:11	JazzyEagle	leebre: Not sure there are any around me.  Linux isn't as popular here in the states, unfortunately.  There are Linux meetups, but for me, I'd have to drive to one of the cities, which is a minimum of 45 minutes away, and they're not audio specific.
2016-09-16 02:08:25	leebre	there are linux audio meetings in the town i am livin in, cologne...

2016-09-16 02:10:36	leebre	maybe this is unique in europe...do not know
2016-09-16 02:11:03	JazzyEagle	I don't think it's necessarily unique, but it is definitely more popular there.
2016-09-16 02:11:07	leebre	i am not a great come together guy, but i really think this is great, a group of people dedicated to linux audio, meeting from time to time in real!
2016-09-16 02:13:01	leebre	i might leave germany and move to east europe, though i dont like the mntality there, but its not so different fromgermany partiots...

2016-09-16 03:32:37	JazzyEagle	I thought the package names for debian were jack & jack2.
2016-09-16 03:32:39	JazzyEagle	Hrmm..
2016-09-16 03:32:53	JazzyEagle	I'm not much of a debian pro.  This may be better for someone else to look at.
2016-09-16 03:37:53	leebre	there is a change now with dbus i think, now its somehow split packages, andoneis a X11 dbus package that automatically starts dbus when X session is started...maybe thats related to that
2016-09-16 03:40:46	leebre	ooop, i didnt got the job, had a wierd call with the HR manager, mmhhh.....i felt a turning point now, i was honestabout my past and it seemed people talked bad about me ...i mean i told himi had a bad time and that i mastered alcoholism, depression and overweight and that before that tme, i also worked int he industry and maybe some one talked bad about me because he remeberd me from that time...

2016-09-16 06:44:50	holstein	oh yeah. the kernel is *very* responsive
2016-09-16 06:44:57	holstein	before, i would just hit the button, and nothing..
2016-09-16 06:45:19	holstein	i had to take the hard drive to another box, and chroot in, to do the upgrade.. no responsiveness..
2016-09-16 06:45:25	holstein	but, *now*!.. its like magic
2016-09-16 06:45:36	leebre	right hehehehe, and now i am so fast that the illuminati have allready called three times, but i told them my girlfriend is not well right now
2016-09-16 06:45:39	holstein	magic.lib is finally where it needs to be.. all you have to do is believe..
2016-09-16 06:45:53	leebre	no i donthave to believe anymore
2016-09-16 06:45:57	leebre	just breathe
2016-09-16 06:47:00	leebre	iam starting now making some videos, with insane latencys and configs and performance sessions...all on old laptop hehehe
2016-09-16 06:47:13	JackWinter	leebre: i doubt that there is any real change that affects any of us...
2016-09-16 06:47:23	holstein	oh yeah! thats where its at!
2016-09-16 06:47:24	leebre	its all perception
2016-09-16 06:47:49	holstein	i mean, new computers are a fraction of the cost, but, its all about getting a P3 and doing professional production work
2016-09-16 06:47:53	leebre	if we wouldnt al agree on that flying cangaroo, science would say, if we havent seen it, it doesnt exist
2016-09-16 06:48:11	holstein	oh!, and the years of one's time, spent, configuring... a bargain!
2016-09-16 06:48:26	leebre	allways invest in yourself
2016-09-16 06:48:36	leebre	you can do that by living each second like it were tzh
2016-09-16 06:48:39	leebre	the last
2016-09-16 06:49:00	leebre	not one second wasted here, enjoyed everything
2016-09-16 06:49:00	holstein	when i hire a professional.. if they have more than one core? i just laugh and say to myself.. "theres a person who doesnt know how to configure old hardware" and i leave the office..
2016-09-16 06:49:20	holstein	and, thats really all that matters. that they can take an old box, and get low latency..
2016-09-16 06:49:34	holstein	who cares how they sound...
2016-09-16 06:49:35	leebre	not neccessarily
2016-09-16 06:49:40	leebre	no one cares
2016-09-16 06:49:44	leebre	most people are deaf
2016-09-16 06:49:55	holstein	right.. its *all* about latency, on old hardware
2016-09-16 06:50:03	leebre	those who are not deaf are quite sure about their listening habbits
2016-09-16 06:50:12	holstein	i look for it posted on their linkden profiles..
2016-09-16 06:50:23	leebre	but sure music is important, yes
2016-09-16 06:50:45	holstein	i look for "pentium3, with super low latency".. i dont listen to any samples..
2016-09-16 06:51:17	leebre	i reached ny goal and i am happy as a child
2016-09-16 06:51:47	leebre	having a fast, low latency , full responsive xrun free system makes me sing again
2016-09-16 06:51:58	holstein	oh yeah.. its all that matters.. i know
2016-09-16 06:52:11	leebre	never said that, you surely know that

2016-09-16 06:53:18	holstein	i mean, if you are trying to make art, or music.. latency and xruns is all that matters

2016-09-16 06:53:58	holstein	nah.. im just being an asshole. im not putting words in your mouth. im just saying things to be an ass
2016-09-16 06:54:02	leebre	i am playing soli on bass, tapping slapping poppin, you name it, i wil play it....and yes, having a fast system helps alot, at least it helps me alot
2016-09-16 06:54:09	leebre	you are not an asshole at all
2016-09-16 06:54:13	leebre	but what should i do
2016-09-16 06:54:26	leebre	saying that all i did and al i believed in is wrong ?
2016-09-16 06:54:48	holstein	is it?
2016-09-16 06:55:00	leebre	it is not
2016-09-16 06:55:06	leebre	if it is , its by random choice
2016-09-16 06:55:08	holstein	if the "faster system" (which is not any faster, just configured differently) is helping you, *great*!
2016-09-16 06:55:23	holstein	why not make some art now?
2016-09-16 06:55:24	leebre	it helps me a lil yes
2016-09-16 06:55:28	leebre	yeah, maybe today
2016-09-16 06:55:34	holstein	yup.. maybe..
2016-09-16 06:55:45	leebre	i am maybe ...i dont like pressure
2016-09-16 06:56:15	leebre	 am saying maybe and suprise you in a positive way is better then saying yes and suprising in a negative way
2016-09-16 06:56:41	leebre	but yes, latency is not such a big issue
2016-09-16 06:56:51	leebre	(nor for me , anymore)
2016-09-16 06:57:00	leebre	now for me anymore hehehe
2016-09-16 06:57:20	leebre	but i had to get there firsdt to know that
2016-09-16 06:57:30	leebre	you could have told me before,like al people told me before
2016-09-16 06:57:46	leebre	like probably all people told you before, when you did not listen ;)
2016-09-16 06:58:00	leebre	and i am not listen too...i like to make experiences
2016-09-16 06:58:01	holstein	well, i did it a bit differently
2016-09-16 06:58:23	leebre	sure hehehe
2016-09-16 06:58:25	leebre	;)
2016-09-16 06:58:42	leebre	for a hobby musician, i am quite happy and satisfied
2016-09-16 06:59:02	leebre	no fear, no pressure but endless oportunities and fun

2016-09-16 07:06:48	nstewart	wondering if I can find any in town.
2016-09-16 07:06:53	leebre	normally, they aregivin the cheap thermal grease with the fan

2016-09-16 07:23:22	JackWinter	someone did a study on the thermal properties of tothpaste and it came out just as good.  though they thought it might dry out and change properties over time
2016-09-16 07:26:04	leebre	and that is what any paste or pad does, too, over time
2016-09-16 07:26:56	leebre	i would use the bundled fan first, it may be quiet, too, i would be curious and would use the situation, that i cant install the quiet fan
2016-09-16 07:27:24	leebre	the fan situation has gone insane, i think
2016-09-16 07:27:50	leebre	you get coolers that are far out of specifications
2016-09-16 07:28:22	leebre	800 gramm or very tall
2016-09-16 07:28:22		[07:28]
2016-09-16 07:29:17	leebre	and latest intel cpu i guess are very optimized concerning thermal power and energy performance ratio
2016-09-16 07:30:05	leebre	most important i guess is if its pwm or not...never was able to configure the fans on linux myself
2016-09-16 07:31:24	leebre	okay, cheapest solution would be eight core amd...but then there must be much money spent on silent coolers, silent power suplies and case
2016-09-16 07:32:27	leebre	i am very happy with old intel laptops, thats the solution for me...
2016-09-16 07:34:08	nstewart	that's what this is -  8 core amd with a quiet fan

2016-09-17 00:02:14	Caterpillar	Hi, I am looking for a piano software, because I have to do some voice excercizes trying to reach and keep a specific note. Which software could I try?
2016-09-17 00:04:28	bluebell	It's probably the simplest approach starting Carla, loading the FluidR3_GM.sf2 soundfont and choosing one of the first programs (Piano, Bright Piano etc.)
2016-09-17 00:04:55	bluebell	Or using qsynth and loading FluidR3_GM.sf2
2016-09-17 00:06:26	jubo2	All the positive I can do about Syria is keep donating the small monthly donation to the Finnish Red Cross and sometimes play George Wassouf to ease the homesickness of the asyl guys
2016-09-17 00:06:35	jubo2	not play like instrument

2016-09-17 00:26:06	rghvdberg	if I have the option, I choose open source
2016-09-17 00:26:16	bluebell	Where "available source" is more important than free as in free beer
2016-09-17 00:28:13	rghvdberg	software I use is so damn good .. it just happen to be open source :-)
2016-09-17 00:28:39	bluebell	:)
2016-09-17 00:29:00	rghvdberg	love the desktops available, plugins, DAWs ... feel like a kid in a candy store
2016-09-17 00:29:00		[00:29]
2016-09-17 00:30:00	bluebell	It's so much better and more fun to learn and combine open source plugins than buying a commercial "make it fat and loud" all-in-one monsterplugin
2016-09-17 00:31:19	rghvdberg	it's louder so it sounds better ...
2016-09-17 00:31:31	rghvdberg	not ...
2016-09-17 00:31:47	bluebell	our ears are used to a certain amount of compression and limiting
2016-09-17 00:32:36	bluebell	it's easier to listen to compressed music on places where it's not quiet, as in cars
2016-09-17 00:33:16	rghvdberg	mmm, I have to start working in a bit

2016-09-20 00:39:07	dreamer	[09:30:44] but it helps to get a foot in the door, you know? [09:30:44]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	dreamer	[09:30:51] also I have no clue what I'd do in the music world, honestly [09:30:51]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	dreamer	[09:31:04] just, music is one of my life's passions and I'd like to be more involved with it [09:31:04]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	leebre	[09:39:31] this was just som crazy, i was rejected when i thought i amgetting a chance for a meeting, but now, i am too bad for hard and software ...lolol...i told the man,i hardly can believe that, i told him it could be because people in the industry are remebering the times i had 60kg more wheight and was acohol addicted and depressive, ...that changed the situation [09:39:31]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	leebre	[09:40:06] i am telling you [09:40:06]

2016-09-20 00:39:07	leebre	[09:45:15] but trying toget a job is maybe like trying to get a girlfriend, you need to jumo over your shadow, people have expectations....if you dont meet that expectations you are fake or a liyer [09:45:15]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	leebre	[09:46:04] and only things that can be understood can be explained....some stuff is to wierd to be communicated hehehe [09:46:04]

2016-09-20 00:39:07	dreamer	[10:06:13] and in general don't like the effects myself [10:06:13]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	dreamer	[10:06:39] occasionally I think a nice belgian special beer is fantastic, but I really don't get the "need drink every day" crowd which is most of society [10:06:39]

2016-09-20 14:27:24	dmbaturin	holstein: I was thinking about Four and What Is This Thing Called Love, and I wrote some nonsense: https://a.pomf.cat/cthwdq.pdf , but I have no idea how to bring it to a resolution of any kind.
2016-09-20 14:28:34	holstein	dmbaturin: as far as the changes, you can check out how http://www.guitarcats.com/images/JazzStandardCharts/TUNE-UP-437.jpg got resolved..
2016-09-20 14:29:14	dmbaturin	Let me see.
2016-09-20 14:30:48	dmbaturin	...is it that now I know enough literature to get myself in trouble but not to get out of trouble. ;)
2016-09-20 14:32:51	dmbaturin	Interesting. My next thought was another ii V I like there, but the part after this goes over my head. Let me try it by sound.
2016-09-20 14:33:27	holstein	think.. ii V I IV..
2016-09-20 14:33:53	holstein	then, its really just ii V, that doest resolve..
2016-09-20 14:34:28	holstein	"false 2 5's" or whatever you want to call them
2016-09-20 14:34:40	Stuzz	I get the impression that you write from what you know, rather than what you hear
2016-09-20 14:34:43	holstein	like in "four".. the bridge..
2016-09-20 14:35:11	holstein	yeah. ideally, you would just write what you hear, and worry about the terms and whatnot later, if you want
2016-09-20 14:35:43	holstein	sometimes, it may take some work looking at how others have done things, to get an idea of what one wants to do..
2016-09-20 14:36:10	Stuzz	Write whatever, and then use (or don't) your knowledge to choose a direction you'll be satisfied with
2016-09-20 14:37:26	holstein	or, chosedly (if you will) not satisfied with..

2016-09-20 14:41:18	dmbaturin	Stuzz: Usually it's a mix of both, like a melodic idea I made up set (or developed via) a theoretical harmonic device, or something in this fashion.
2016-09-20 14:42:03	dmbaturin	And, theoretical devices themselves are symbolic representation of perfectly real aural entities too.
2016-09-20 14:44:17	holstein	sometimes, i try and just go with what i have.. as in, i try and capture the melody im hearing, on its own..
2016-09-20 14:44:40	holstein	if i can get it, and a bass note, at the same time, great.. if not, i just keep going.. with the melody, til i have that entire thing
2016-09-20 14:44:57	holstein	i'll then try and hear what the harmony is from there, if needed..
2016-09-20 14:45:12	holstein	sometimes, i get the whole thing in one burst.. but not often
2016-09-20 14:46:39	dmbaturin	I started doing something like this lately, with guide tones. Though I often can't quickly get what this or that tone may imply in context, when I find one that sounds good.

2016-09-20 15:30:16	dmbaturin	holstein: In other news, I started the formal clarinet lessons. At the first lesson the instructor made me play over a loudly played alto sax, the idea being that you just can't compete with it if your embouchure is too stiff or breath support is not strong enough.
2016-09-20 15:30:57	holstein	interesting
2016-09-20 15:31:06	holstein	you mean, he was playing the alto sax?
2016-09-20 15:31:33	dmbaturin	Yep, suggested to play this or that scale and played it with me.
2016-09-20 15:31:57	Stuzz	Do you need to compete with that?
2016-09-20 15:32:00	Stuzz	Or anything?
2016-09-20 15:32:47	dmbaturin	Well, technically not, but it reveals technique problems quickly.
2016-09-20 15:38:00		[15:32]
2016-09-20 15:38:42	dmbaturin	What I learnt about good emouchure and breath support this way is perfectly applicable when I'm playing quietly at home of course.
2016-09-20 15:43:40	dmbaturin	...though I'd better memorize the upper register fingerings by the next saturday, I didn't bother because I thought I can't play in it yet.

2016-09-20 15:53:23	dmbaturin	I think a lot of system-config-* is not exactly alive anymore.

2016-09-20 15:54:14	dmbaturin	What I find most annoying is that system-config-*-tui is even deader. It was really handy on headless machines with no X.

2016-09-20 15:57:30	holstein	stop
2016-09-20 15:57:37	holstein	back those up.. 3 2 1 rule
2016-09-20 15:57:43	holstein	then, have *no* fear, and do what is needed
2016-09-20 15:58:14	dmbaturin	Just keep backups of baby pictures, and destroy whatever you want safely. ;) Anyway, most likely that's an actual bug rather than simple version incompatibility. You are probably safer with pvresize than with that anyway.
2016-09-20 15:59:52	nstewart	not planning to do anything to that volume, do have a backup, WC would be lose the last month or so.
2016-09-20 16:00:22	nstewart	but it still sucks to have to restore, kills a bunch of time cause its slooow. mostly due to massive amounts of duplication

2016-09-20 18:53:18	holstein	[01:31:06] you mean, he was playing the alto sax? [01:31:06]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[01:31:33] Yep, suggested to play this or that scale and played it with me. [01:31:33]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	Stuzz	[01:31:57] Do you need to compete with that? [01:31:57]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	Stuzz	[01:32:00] Or anything? [01:32:00]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[01:32:47] Well, technically not, but it reveals technique problems quickly. [01:32:47]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[01:38:42] What I learnt about good emouchure and breath support this way is perfectly applicable when I'm playing quietly at home of course. [01:38:42]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[01:43:40] ...though I'd better memorize the upper register fingerings by the next saturday, I didn't bother because I thought I can't play in it yet. [01:43:40]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	nstewart	[01:52:30] is system-config-lvm dead? not liking my python in ubuntu studio 16.04 [01:52:30]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[01:53:23] I think a lot of system-config-* is not exactly alive anymore. [01:53:23]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[01:53:35] nstewart: What exactly it doesn't like? [01:53:35]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[01:54:14] What I find most annoying is that system-config-*-tui is even deader. It was really handy on headless machines with no X. [01:54:14]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	nstewart	[01:54:29] http://pastebin.com/8usWSKS1 [01:54:29]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	nstewart	[01:55:23] I get all kinda  nervous and lose my command line fu when it comes to destroying baby pictures and the like. [01:55:23]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[01:55:46] nstewart: That's not exactly not liking python, something there returns None when the callee expects some kind of physical volume object. [01:55:46]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	holstein	[01:57:30] stop [01:57:30]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	holstein	[01:57:37] back those up.. 3 2 1 rule [01:57:37]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	holstein	[01:57:43] then, have *no* fear, and do what is needed [01:57:43]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[01:58:14] Just keep backups of baby pictures, and destroy whatever you want safely. ;) Anyway, most likely that's an actual bug rather than simple version incompatibility. You are probably safer with pvresize than with that anyway. [01:58:14]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	nstewart	[01:59:52] not planning to do anything to that volume, do have a backup, WC would be lose the last month or so. [01:59:52]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	nstewart	[02:00:22] but it still sucks to have to restore, kills a bunch of time cause its slooow. mostly due to massive amounts of duplication [02:00:22]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	holstein	[02:05:06] well, you dont *have* to restore, yet :) [02:05:06]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	holstein	[02:05:12] just make sure you have backups, and work without fear.. [02:05:12]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	holstein	[02:05:20] sometimes, when you mess with things, things get messy.. [02:05:20]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	holstein	[02:05:47] ^ and you can quote me on that.. [02:05:47]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	nstewart	[02:08:10] least I was supposed to. nas appears to be lost after firmware update [02:08:10]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	nstewart	[02:08:16] postpone [02:08:16]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[02:08:31] nstewart: Make your own NAS with a real OS. [02:08:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	nstewart	[02:17:24] it has a real os. they just didn't see fit to provide actual root access :) [02:17:24]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[02:23:12] My friend once bought a NAS that turned out to automatically backup all his data to vendor's servers, without his consent or a way to opt out. [02:23:12]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	kwfuccf	[04:34:53] how do i tell what the sound is being diverted to in kx studio //and dont say kmix cuz that program is bull shit it just lest u tell the program where tog not where it is actualy doining any way to tell what kx studio is actualy doing [04:34:53]

2016-09-20 21:43:43	Franklin_	Need help can't get cadence to start the icon spins at the bottom of the screen then it dissapears.  Can't configure jack for my 2i2.  Have an intel nuc I built.  It did boot up once when I moved the computer to my Sony TV - monitor then it went away.  I set cadence to boot at start up.  I'll keep trying.  Would ubuntu studio work better for me?
2016-09-20 21:47:15	Franklin_	I've had great luck with my big computer running KX studio on a MSATA SSD.  But this miniature Intel NUC i-7 power house has (no sound).  Like I sad it worked one time in a different configuation.

2016-09-21 07:19:40	JackWinter	if you don't want to use a -rt kernel (but i also use one for years and it crashes no more than any other kernel), at least add the "threadirqs" to your "low-lat" kernel.
2016-09-21 07:20:21	JackWinter	that will make the kernel run most of the interrupt handlers as threads, so that you can set a high priority for your soundcards interrupt

2016-09-21 07:21:16	NeoFrontier	where is klopsi4u ?
2016-09-21 07:21:42	treetop	I kept it 95 thanks HerrZen
2016-09-21 07:22:00	HerrZen	95
2016-09-21 07:22:01	JackWinter	HerrZen: and when it comes to linux realtime one value isn't better than another.  it's just that a thread of a higher priority will preempt threads of lower priority, so it's the relative priority value and not the absolute that is important
2016-09-21 07:22:04	treetop	JackWinter: should I recompile? :)
2016-09-21 07:22:30	JackWinter	sorry, that was for treetop ;)

2016-09-21 07:25:27	JackWinter	treetop: that has nothing to do with realtime or kernel

2016-09-21 07:26:08	treetop	I will research on the threadirqs thing, I thought it was a flag for kernel compiling
2016-09-21 07:26:42	treetop	ohh boot argument

2016-09-21 07:28:03	JackWinter	the way i set it up, is the priority of the soundcard interrupt handler thread at 95, jack realtime at 80.  and that should be all you need, in addition to the limits.conf and either booting a rt kernel or using the "threadirqs"  boot flag with a vanilla kernel

2016-09-22 07:37:26	frinknet	It seems like creating your own sampleset in gigedit or swami might be an easy solution
2016-09-22 07:37:49	frinknet	Otherwise you might try Giada - although it might be overkill for you.
2016-09-22 07:38:18	frinknet	Buth will require a significant bit of setup.
2016-09-22 07:39:20	frinknet	Mixxx will not give you access to enough sounds I think

2016-09-22 07:42:14	frinknet	Depends on whehter you are more interested in beds or one shots
2016-09-22 07:42:42	thebishop	frinknet, it's slightly different usecases that could be done by one piece of software. 1. one-shot soundboard stuff (fabla handles this great) 2. playing extended audio clips that can be paused/resumed with my live commentary in between
2016-09-22 07:42:51	frinknet	Sampler will do one shots easier while Giada will do beds better
2016-09-22 07:43:17	thebishop	can you say what a "bed" is? I've never heard that term
2016-09-22 07:43:53	thebishop	nvm i found it
2016-09-22 07:43:55	frinknet	A music bed is a loop of background music that plays while an anoucer is talking
2016-09-22 07:43:57	thebishop	yeah, i'd like that two
2016-09-22 07:44:06	thebishop	that's a 3rd thing i also might want :(
2016-09-22 07:44:44	frinknet	I toured iHeart Radio in Tucson about a year ago and learned a lot about how radio works today
2016-09-22 07:45:26	frinknet	mostly everything is pre-recorded except for live traffic hours in the morning and evening.
2016-09-22 07:46:56	frinknet	They are basically provided set of music to organize and play allong with commercials. Then they record their talking bits in between and run everything together. This is all managed from a web application.
2016-09-22 07:47:16	frinknet	Many times the DJ you hear on the radio isn't even in the same state!
2016-09-22 07:49:45	frinknet	But for live work you have a set of beds and shots on a grid controller (like a launchpad) and then you have a music DJ application like Mixxx or something similar.
2016-09-22 07:50:15	frinknet	There is an open source Radio management suite that I saw somewhere a while back.

2016-09-22 07:58:30	thebishop	frinknet, thanks, it's really a podcast, but i'd like to be able to record semi "live" so that all the hosts hear the samples and stuff so it feels natural to the listener
2016-09-22 07:58:48	thebishop	frinknet, i hadnt considered using mixxx for the whole thing (ardour + fabla right now), but maybe that's worth a look
2016-09-22 08:00:35	thebishop	airtime looks kind of like overkill for my needs (i'm not running an actual station!), but i like what i'm seeing
2016-09-22 08:02:22	thebishop	i don't think mixxx is gonna give me the per-track (e.g. microphone) control i'd want ideally, but i do have a mixing board for that

2016-09-22 08:18:43	frinknet	A lot of it is just getting outside the box of tradition to look at what's possible.
2016-09-22 08:20:37	frinknet	Sir-Mix-A-Lot carries a Blue Kiwi and Tascam interface around with him and does his lunch hour radio show from the road in the mornings and afternoons from his hotel room
2016-09-22 08:22:20	frinknet	If you're doing a podcast Ardour is probably your friend. In that case you may not want to do music beds live but come back and put them in at post production. But SFX live via some midi controller makes sense. You can also record the SFX into a separate track on your DAW so you can adjust mix and timing.
2016-09-22 08:23:01	frinknet	Probably creating a sample set would be easier for that scenario

2016-09-23 01:39:13	leebre	i think synthclone is a great software, that will play animportant role in near future, when the original analog synth's are starting to rott away..i mean, even the spare parts of those are becoming rare, for sure, so capturing the sound with synthclone is a nice idea to keep the sounds alive for future musicians...

2016-09-23 01:40:22	leebre	what could be the next step of synthclone would be adding two controllers, so, that it can capture also the modulation....yeah, but hey, sure....
2016-09-23 01:45:48	JazzyEagle	I wonder if there could be some sort of "IR" files for synths.  Obviously IR itself can't be measured, but there has to be something unique about each of the synths that could be identified and put into some sort of emulation tool...
2016-09-23 01:48:46	leebre	yes
2016-09-23 01:48:50	leebre	JazzyEagle
2016-09-23 01:48:54	leebre	and hello to you ;)
2016-09-23 01:49:05	JazzyEagle	Hello to you as well.
2016-09-23 01:49:35	leebre	probem would be that you would need a synth with an input because youhave to feed it with a 1 bit click or a frequency sweep over the whole spectrum
2016-09-23 01:49:37	leebre	:)
2016-09-23 01:49:55	leebre	thats why i think, for synth, sampling would be fine
2016-09-23 01:50:41	JazzyEagle	Sampling is fine, until you want to start changing oscillator, envelope, filter, etc. settings.
2016-09-23 01:50:41		[01:50]
2016-09-23 01:51:00	leebre	the other approachwould be , getting the blue prints, the whole construction scheme, then we could scan or load it into asimulator that checks electronic designs for errors by running simulations on it
2016-09-23 01:51:05	JazzyEagle	Then it becomes too much of a nightmare to have sampling for every possible setting.
2016-09-23 01:51:20	leebre	hehehe, right
2016-09-23 01:51:27	leebre	but you dont need so many controllers
2016-09-23 01:51:47	leebre	maybe cutoff freq and resonace would be enough for a synth like the 303
2016-09-23 01:52:02	leebre	2 modulation controllers then....
2016-09-23 01:52:11	leebre	128 step each hehehe
2016-09-23 01:52:25	leebre	n¹²⁸
2016-09-23 01:52:44	JazzyEagle	I have no idea.  I'm not much of a synth guy.
2016-09-23 01:54:15	JazzyEagle	I would assume, though, that most plugins with oscillators would be able to handle the sounds from these older synths, right?  I mean, does the make of oscillator make a big difference on the sound?  Doesn't 500Hz sound like the same 500Hz tone regardless of oscillator, or can it sound different for different oscillators?

2016-09-23 01:54:37	leebre	it sounds different
2016-09-23 01:54:47	leebre	because the analog oscilators had drifts too
2016-09-23 01:54:49	JazzyEagle	Hrm.
2016-09-23 01:54:51	leebre	also the analog filters
2016-09-23 01:54:55	leebre	thats what i have heardt
2016-09-23 01:55:04	leebre	i could be so wrong, i would bet on that
2016-09-23 01:55:41	leebre	also, you may want another oscilator source then sine hehehehe
2016-09-23 01:56:10	JazzyEagle	Well, yeah, but most oscillators can do more than just sine.
2016-09-23 01:56:15	JazzyEagle	Ok, let me ask it this way, then...
2016-09-23 01:56:24	leebre	and then, quite sure, you get different results....linear oscillators like square or saw or ramp, which are all quite popular...i think its the steepness ...
2016-09-23 01:56:32	JazzyEagle	Does a 500Hz sine wave sound the same across all oscillators?
2016-09-23 01:57:06	leebre	i would guess, when talking about analog oscillatorsm i guess, they all sound slightly different
2016-09-23 01:57:17	JazzyEagle	Assuming the same set amplitude (assuming again amplitude can be set)
2016-09-23 01:57:19	leebre	but i am quite sure when we are talking about saw oscillators
2016-09-23 01:57:41	leebre	these are sounding different....you could find out easily
2016-09-23 01:58:14	leebre	get record of two different synths with sine oscillators and look atthe wav files int he audio editor...
2016-09-23 01:58:37	JazzyEagle	Considering I have no audio hardware and oscillators are kind of expensive/hard to come by, I'll get right on that...
2016-09-23 01:58:38	leebre	pick up the phone
2016-09-23 01:58:53	JazzyEagle	Well, synth hardware, I do have a USB audio interface...
2016-09-23 01:58:56	leebre	we should all hear the same beeep, the sine, but i think it sounds different all the time
2016-09-23 01:59:26	leebre	but you are asking some one who is known for knowing not much hehehehe
2016-09-23 01:59:41	JazzyEagle	I'm just musing about it in general.
2016-09-23 01:59:52	JazzyEagle	I wasn't expecting answers.  :)
2016-09-23 02:00:05	leebre	thats a relief hehehe
2016-09-23 02:01:26	leebre	but as we all know , every sound, exists of many sine partials...so maybe, the sine is the mother of all sounds hehehe, and all sine sounds sounding the same...but i am doubting it
2016-09-23 02:02:37	leebre	its hard to get linear eletric power from the power socket, vice versa, its maybe hard to get a smooth sine wave, that is totally smooth and perrfectly interpolated, if produced digitally...
2016-09-23 02:04:11	leebre	must do some things, see you later ;)

2016-09-23 07:14:36	holstein	you also, dont have to say "yes"..
2016-09-23 07:14:57	leebre	i feel forced too, i have my standards, allways friendly, allways a helpinghand
2016-09-23 07:15:03	holstein	right
2016-09-23 07:15:07	holstein	thats not really a friend though
2016-09-23 07:15:13	holstein	thats some kind of barter system..
2016-09-23 07:15:14	leebre	no friendshere hehehe
2016-09-23 07:15:23	holstein	like "hey, you do this for me, so, i'll do this for you"

2016-09-23 07:15:35	holstein	thats something.. but, not really the definition of a friendship
2016-09-23 07:15:37	leebre	this is normal, yes
2016-09-23 07:15:51	holstein	friends? they are just your friends.. if you dont want to go where they ask, its not that you are no longer friends
2016-09-23 07:16:09	leebre	hereits slightly different, all the time, wholelife, i experienced friendly supportive people, i have to give back
2016-09-23 07:16:09	holstein	i mean, i dont go anywhere either.. but, i just say "no, im not going"
2016-09-23 07:16:27	leebre	i said yes,shit
2016-09-23 07:16:40	leebre	an now the guy put meon the list, its disrespect not going there
2016-09-23 07:16:41	holstein	then, you go..
2016-09-23 07:16:46	holstein	its not a problem to say no to a friend
2016-09-23 07:16:52	leebre	but it starts at 23 and goes to 5 in the morning
2016-09-23 07:16:55	holstein	the problem is, to say yes, and then, not go
2016-09-23 07:17:07	leebre	probably
2016-09-23 07:17:08	holstein	thats not something a friend does..
2016-09-23 07:17:09	leebre	yes
2016-09-23 07:17:11	holstein	probably?
2016-09-23 07:17:22	holstein	shit, brother. thats in the "how to be a friend" handbook
2016-09-23 07:17:26	leebre	mmmhhh...i am thinking differently
2016-09-23 07:17:30	holstein	right
2016-09-23 07:17:43	leebre	thereis no truth, wheni am believing it,its okay, i have vivid imaginations
2016-09-23 07:17:45	holstein	you can "think" as you want. but, when you say "yes, i'll be there" and dont go? thats you having lied to your friend
2016-09-23 07:17:57	holstein	which, if its a good friend, its prolly cool
2016-09-23 07:18:03	leebre	no good friend
2016-09-23 07:18:05	holstein	but, in the future, just say "no"

2016-09-23 07:18:15	leebre	imight go tonight,maybe

2016-09-23 07:19:21	leebre	really hard
2016-09-23 07:19:25	holstein	i used to say "sure" and end up spread thin.. now, i say "sure.. you can communicate with me about that in march, or april.."
2016-09-23 07:19:28	holstein	or, just "no"
2016-09-23 07:19:42	holstein	as with anything else.. it just takes practice

2016-09-23 07:20:48	leebre	it means, you are not worth anyminute of my life time
2016-09-23 07:21:08	holstein	take that  scneario.. think of how you can just answer something like "oh man!, i appreciate that, *so* much, but, im not going to be able to make time for that.."
2016-09-23 07:21:18	leebre	but he shouldnt invite people after 10 minutes chat

2016-09-23 07:23:46	leebre	yeah, and you didnt have the time anymore ?
2016-09-23 07:23:56	holstein	i didnt want to make that investment of time, any longer..
2016-09-23 07:24:13	leebre	brrr....days are so short hehehe
2016-09-23 07:25:37	leebre	i amtrying to start a carreer now, with 43....starting from zero....zero income, zero connections, zero credibility hehehehe
2016-09-23 07:26:28	leebre	i may be wrong, but i feel, i am just really, mmhh....well in physics i would say, working temperature and pressure are at maximum hehehe
2016-09-23 07:26:49	leebre	i cant spend more timne infront of computers hehehe
2016-09-23 07:28:54	dmbaturin	leebre: If you spent 43 years with no income, I bet you have some valuable experience to sell. ;)
2016-09-23 07:29:02	holstein	lol
2016-09-23 07:29:15	holstein	i mean, i dont mean to laugh. its just, always such a matter of perspective
2016-09-23 07:29:25	leebre	arrgh, no, i worked some years
2016-09-23 07:29:38	holstein	im 41, and, in the past few years, i have gotten my carpentry diploma.. not that im really doing anything with that
2016-09-23 07:29:46	leebre	its good, i can laugh about myself
2016-09-23 07:29:47	holstein	and, also, moved over to playing mostly guitar, instead of bass
2016-09-23 07:30:12	holstein	i changed my career path, at a similar time.. but, i consider it a positive. that i have the freedom to do so
2016-09-23 07:30:24	leebre	really?? wow, carpenrtry...thats tough...the glue.....all the timeson your knees i guess
2016-09-23 07:30:39	leebre	sure, me too, i have the freedom
2016-09-23 07:30:48	holstein	sure.. .so, why not frame it that way?
2016-09-23 07:30:52	leebre	and the freedom is outside and inour heads, too
2016-09-23 07:30:54	holstein	you seem to have a different story
2016-09-23 07:31:00	holstein	"im so old, and starting over, and have nothing"
2016-09-23 07:31:01	dmbaturin	leebre: Well, my point was that living with no income is... tricky to say the least. You get to be quite resourceful to live this way.
2016-09-23 07:31:19	holstein	when, you have *ultimate* freedom, to be your own boss, and not a lot of responsibility, or ties..
2016-09-23 07:31:26	leebre	no wor, no eat, no fat onyour body.....its just very easy
2016-09-23 07:31:29	holstein	sounds like, you can look at that a few different ways..
2016-09-23 07:31:41	leebre	i amunderstanding, yes
2016-09-23 07:31:52	leebre	but ilike to see it as, starting from rock bottom

2016-09-23 07:32:07	leebre	thoughi am a nobody, every one seems to know me

2016-09-23 07:32:56	leebre	its okay, feeling bad is good, i m just paying my dues
2016-09-23 07:33:15	leebre	i dont like systemd, yes

2016-09-23 07:34:13	leebre	for every woman you will meet, you need to tell another story
2016-09-23 07:34:45	holstein	but, you are not starting from "rock bottom".. or, cast out from anything..
2016-09-23 07:34:54	dmbaturin	If I'm going to approach any women, I'll just tell them I can play Confirmation in all 12 keys, and see how they react. ;)
2016-09-23 07:34:55	leebre	some how i do i thin
2016-09-23 07:34:56	leebre	really
2016-09-23 07:35:06	holstein	if you find it constructive to beat yourself up, go for it
2016-09-23 07:35:22	dmbaturin	(I should better learn to actually play in any key though)
2016-09-23 07:35:38	holstein	i always tell chicks, i can play  just as bad in all 12 keys..
2016-09-23 07:35:47	leebre	the truth....i am quite sure, there is not another person( i hope for them) who is in such deep debs without any kind of income ( - 2000 � )
2016-09-23 07:36:20	leebre	i like to tell em that i am alone my whole life, normally that ends  the talk then
2016-09-23 07:36:32	dmbaturin	-2000 eur? Man, you are damn rich compared to those with $30k in student debt. ;)
2016-09-23 07:36:34	leebre	not normally, ...allways
2016-09-23 07:36:54	leebre	the student has time to pay off and is looking to a carrer
2016-09-23 07:37:07	leebre	my banker might call tomorrow and says, its over...
2016-09-23 07:37:28	dmbaturin	Not if they can't find employment with that degree they just got!
2016-09-23 07:37:35	leebre	but its okay, i am telling you, the more you are suffering, the stronger you will get
2016-09-23 07:37:59	leebre	then they will find a partner and he pays then
2016-09-23 07:38:07	leebre	some one will pay

2016-09-23 07:38:37	holstein	me? im telling you, you *dont* have to suffer, like that.. and, its not always constructive
2016-09-23 07:38:49	holstein	imagine, giving yourself actual positive feedback, and opportunity ;)

2016-09-23 07:42:59	leebre	yes
2016-09-23 07:43:16	leebre	i like being honest, to every one

2016-09-23 07:44:18	leebre	only look at women with sun glasses....then you wont see the eyes, you wont be shocked or whatever...
2016-09-23 07:44:27	holstein	the trickier bit, is being honest with yourself :) .. at least, that is the case for me
2016-09-23 07:44:30	zarathus	hey i use archlinux and cant get my herules rmx console work to with DJ software Mixxx.
2016-09-23 07:45:02	holstein	zarathus: i would close DJ mixxx, and work with just getting that device to work with linux, generally
2016-09-23 07:45:12	leebre	i am honest to me and to others, really, i am not getting paied telling lies
2016-09-23 07:45:14	holstein	is it supportable by alsa? can you get jack running? etc..
2016-09-23 07:45:27	holstein	and go from there, with mixxx, after the system is utilizing the hardware
2016-09-23 07:45:50	holstein	leebre: lol.. we started talking because you had lied to a person you were referring to as a friend, thats not your friend ;)
2016-09-23 07:46:00	holstein	but, what do i know...
2016-09-23 07:46:07	zarathus	jack recognizes th rmx but cant start with it. jack and other soundcard work fine
2016-09-23 07:46:26	leebre	no ,it was a pal, not a friend, some one i met for the first time, but we really spoke the same language and had a good talk
2016-09-23 07:46:30	holstein	cool.. so, you can focus on that part of the chain.. the system, and jack using the device..
2016-09-23 07:46:40	holstein	DJ mixxx will "just work" when you have that sorted
2016-09-23 07:46:52	leebre	mixxx runs rock stable here
2016-09-23 07:46:57	zarathus	and mixxx doesnt show me the rmx at all
2016-09-23 07:47:01	leebre	on arch linux
2016-09-23 07:47:18	holstein	right.. it wont, *until* you sort the support out, in the system
2016-09-23 07:47:57	leebre	usb, the hercules controller should work
2016-09-23 07:47:59	holstein	when you get jack running on it, you can simply route it, in jack
2016-09-23 07:48:17	zarathus	yea, mixxx and jack together makes mixxx to freeze.
2016-09-23 07:48:34	holstein	zarathus: so, jack starts? yes or no?
2016-09-23 07:48:52	holstein	you cant have run mixx, in the other scenario you have mentioned, where, jack is not starting on the device..
2016-09-23 07:49:01	zarathus	jack is fine if i dont use rmx soundcard
2016-09-23 07:49:20	leebre	so, we have found the solution i guess
2016-09-23 07:49:35	holstein	zarathus: so, *does* jack start on the RMX? yes or no?
2016-09-23 07:49:39	zarathus	no
2016-09-23 07:49:47	holstein	so, what you say, is not testable
2016-09-23 07:49:56	zarathus	?
2016-09-23 07:50:00	leebre	please, one lil try, sorry that i am disturbing
2016-09-23 07:50:02	holstein	you cannot test that mixxx and jack together "freeze"
2016-09-23 07:50:16	leebre	disconnect the hercules controller
2016-09-23 07:50:48	leebre	no, sorry
2016-09-23 07:50:53	zarathus	i can start jack with my onboard soundcard, and other usb soundcards, and if then i start mixxx, it freezes.
2016-09-23 07:50:57	leebre	thought it wold be just a midi controller
2016-09-23 07:51:05	leebre	but its a complete audio device

2016-09-23 07:52:01	leebre	Older versions of Mixxx that did not support HID required using Hercules' MIDI driver, but it is now recommend to not use the Hercules driver on GNU/Linux. If you have it installed, it is recommended to uninstall the driver and upgrade to the latest version of Mixxx if you have not already. On Windows (and Mac OS X?) the driver is still recommended.
2016-09-23 07:52:04	zarathus	yes, my aim was to use it just as controler first, because i have a focusrite saffire6 and jack works well with it.
2016-09-23 07:52:29	holstein	right
2016-09-23 07:52:44	leebre	saffire 26 ?
2016-09-23 07:52:59	zarathus	but i think( im sure) i have the latest version of mixx
2016-09-23 07:53:00	holstein	zarathus: let me try, again, friend.. unplug *everything* else.. only have the rmx sound device hooked up.. then, work with making jack run, in that scnenario
2016-09-23 07:53:06	holstein	until that happens, you need not move on
2016-09-23 07:53:16	holstein	mixx is *not* the problem yet..
2016-09-23 07:53:16		[07:53]
2016-09-23 07:53:27	holstein	you need jack to facilitate the connection
2016-09-23 07:53:41	holstein	now, why is jack and mixx "freezing" ? with other setups? thats a different problem
2016-09-23 07:54:02	holstein	what do i suggest? download AVlinux, and see if things "just work" on that system, and you can learn about how things are to be configured from there
2016-09-23 07:54:13	mfrei	help sound card usb recomended for KxStudio
2016-09-23 07:54:35	zarathus	yes ok. holstein. you are right, but another problem is, why cant i use rmx just as midicontroler and not as soundcard
2016-09-23 07:55:16	zarathus	so how should i start to find the bug?
2016-09-23 07:55:22	holstein	zarathus: right.. and, i cannot be more clear.. unplug everything else from the machine, and work with it
2016-09-23 07:55:25	leebre	mfrei - firewire is preferred over usb, but all usb should work...rme is top notch, focusrite are great for the money...pick one
2016-09-23 07:55:26	holstein	its not  a "bug" yet ;)
2016-09-23 07:56:14	holstein	the main "bug" is, you are not promised linux support. so, you'll have to, unplug everything from the machine, and plug it *directly* in, and run some commands/tests.. til you get jack working with it, if possible
2016-09-23 07:56:34	mfrei	Thanks
2016-09-23 07:56:42	leebre	;)
2016-09-23 07:57:02	ChaosFan	firewire is dying out, I wouldn't invest in firewire stuff nowadays
2016-09-23 07:57:18	holstein	well, as long as you have the gear to use it with.. it works great..
2016-09-23 07:57:43	ChaosFan	of course - I'm just saying I wouldn't start buying firewire gear nowadays
2016-09-23 07:57:43	holstein	i have a presonus firepod..
2016-09-23 07:58:00	leebre	right, but what i dontknow, how far is firewire compatible to thundebolt...i saw recently cheap laptops with thunderbolt...so, thunderbolt is coming, i dontknow how compatible that is...
2016-09-23 07:58:00	holstein	well, i wouldnt buy *expensive* firewire gear, expecting magic support
2016-09-23 07:58:17	holstein	but, if i saw some nice interface for a few hundred, and i have the port, still..
2016-09-23 07:58:28	ChaosFan	it's becoming harder and harder to even get some pc/laptop with a firewire port, or firewire extension cards
2016-09-23 07:58:31	holstein	its certainly on the way out..
2016-09-23 07:58:44	leebre	there are really nice firewire audiointerfaces, and also mixing consoles available
2016-09-23 07:58:44	holstein	but, that can help facilitate the deal..
2016-09-23 07:59:16	leebre	and still, there are some aufio firewire interfaces, still, on the market....by now, firewire is not dead, but yes....it doesnt appear to be the future ot aufio interfaces
2016-09-23 07:59:44	ChaosFan	I'm not saying it's dead - I said it's dying ;)
2016-09-23 07:59:52	holstein	yup :/
2016-09-23 07:59:59	holstein	not sure whats next for "us"
2016-09-23 08:00:01	leebre	right hehehehe, but its slowly dying

2016-09-23 08:00:16	leebre	and slowly dying could be a bad word for livingmaybe hehehe
2016-09-23 08:01:26	leebre	i like firewire, i amusing it, have three audio interfaces here, i hope, andi think, its not dea, but right....it doesnt look as it will be the future....but no interface conncection protocol except midi could establish as a standard over decades
2016-09-23 08:02:30	ChaosFan	I just thought calling a dying technology "preferred" might be a bit misleading
2016-09-23 08:02:30	zarathus	ok, magic! jack runs well with rmx now ... only problem ... xruns
2016-09-23 08:02:54	holstein	zarathus: right.. which is *great* progress.. if maybe, you just want to run some more tests?
2016-09-23 08:03:10	holstein	try relaxing the settings.. make sure your user config is "good" etc..
2016-09-23 08:03:17	leebre	on mobile, i would prefer amd suggest it because i still think you will havemore fun and less trouble then with usb, but thats myopinion, i am no specialist
2016-09-23 08:03:25	leebre	and suggest
2016-09-23 08:03:34	holstein	see that your latency settings are reading like 20ms.. then, relax to more like 50ms, and test..
2016-09-23 08:04:25	ChaosFan	never had a problem with focusrite scarlett usb stuff, and before that I had an m-audio usb 1.1 audio interface for almost 10 years that worked well (albeit with pretty high latency - thanks to usb 1.1)
2016-09-23 08:06:45	leebre	right, ihave a nice idea, we really should write and save the questions asked here and the respective answer....then its written in stone maybe and we dont have to start discussing infront of the children ;)
2016-09-23 08:07:39	ChaosFan	but isn't the whole point of such a channel to be a place of discussion? ;)
2016-09-23 08:07:54	leebre	i would suggest firewire, but when you say usbis somehow better suited for osm's or linux beginners maybe, then i will suggest usb audio interfacesin the future
2016-09-23 08:08:24	ChaosFan	to each his own, i don't have personal experience with firewire interfaces.
2016-09-23 08:08:24		[08:08]
2016-09-23 08:08:28	holstein	i use firewire, and i think its the "best" option we have, certainly, even still.. but its not "easy"..
2016-09-23 08:08:33	leebre	allways forward....march,one two, step onthe head
2016-09-23 08:08:43	holstein	if one can use a USB device, and get what they need, i suggest that
2016-09-23 08:10:24	leebre	apple or bananna, thats allways a tough question
2016-09-23 08:11:00	ChaosFan	if you want a general answer, yes. my personal opinion on the apple vs banana question is pretty much set ;)

2016-09-23 08:18:10	holstein	if it is, and you are just getting xruns, then, you can look into these other things ^
2016-09-23 08:18:20	zarathus	irq?
2016-09-23 08:19:26	holstein	right..
2016-09-23 08:19:43	holstein	you can have *hardware* issues.. that are making you have xruns.. irq's are a way to check for that..

2016-09-23 08:27:24	ChaosFan	zarathus: very very basic explanation: IRQs are interrupts - signals hardware can send to he OS that "something needs to be handled". it's how hard drives tell the os they finished moving to a requested read/write position, network interfaces tell they have received data ready to read, keyboards/mice tell they "were used", that sort of thing

2016-09-23 08:28:52	holstein	^ that should list

2016-09-23 08:29:10	holstein	right
2016-09-23 08:29:29	holstein	so, consider, simply downloading AVlinux, and you can do all this testing, in a live environment, created for audio production
2016-09-23 08:29:37	holstein	you  can apply anything you learn, to your current arch system
2016-09-23 08:29:43	holstein	or, use the command i linked
2016-09-23 08:30:05	holstein	or, *anything* that can tell you about your hardware conflicts.. to see *if* thats the problem
2016-09-23 08:31:36	zarathus	ok, thank you, holstein and leebre!
2016-09-23 08:32:02	zarathus	but its very hard for me to interpret thees things
2016-09-23 08:32:15	holstein	cool.. dont interpret anything :)
2016-09-23 08:32:18	holstein	just check, and test..
2016-09-23 08:32:24	holstein	you can share in a pastebin, if you like..
2016-09-23 08:33:08	zarathus	dont know about pastebin
2016-09-23 08:33:55	ChaosFan	it's a sort of website where you can just copy and paste text for sharing larger amounts of text with others, like source code snippets or logfiles or console command outputs
2016-09-23 08:34:18	ChaosFan	stuff that is "too much" to paste into a chat, or that you don't want to "scroll away" when talking about it

2016-09-23 08:34:27	zarathus	ok,
2016-09-23 08:35:02	holstein	think about it this way.. RMX *can*, and is able to *fully* support you, and arch and linux.. its *all* open.. since, they dont.. its all up to you to support it
2016-09-23 08:35:07	zarathus	i know, ... its new to me to ask for help in irc.
2016-09-23 08:35:14	holstein	ask, then
2016-09-23 08:35:22	holstein	"i dont know about things".. is a statement..
2016-09-23 08:35:47	holstein	"hey, whats that tool you speak of? and how can i use it?, i have tried this, and this happened".. thats something to discuss..

It took me quite some counting eights to find out where the ties really should be, and how long are rests, lol.
2016-09-23 09:03:49	holstein	yeah.. thats how you do it :)
2016-09-23 09:03:56	holstein	it gets quicker, the more you do it..
2016-09-23 09:04:36	dmbaturin	Cranefly is still quite an approximation, I hope to find time to find a compromise between way too many ties and accuracy.
2016-09-23 09:05:14	dmbaturin	If anyone asks me to arrange it for a few horns, I'll just go cry myself to sleep probably.
2016-09-23 09:08:34	leebre	yesterday a serious classical trained and studied piano player asked me about linux, ubuntu studio,jack and what would be the best for notation, i gave my number to  what appeared to me as her boyfriend...i had to lookin her eyes, but it was hard....i probably said many things about linux that are very untrue...

2016-09-23 09:09:41	leebre	iam trying, butits allways quite complicated....who wants to take sheet music, re- arrange it and print out the score later....who does suchthings ???
2016-09-23 09:10:15	leebre	except this woman....ay....i drank to less and talked too much, argh...
2016-09-23 09:10:24	dmbaturin	What's wrong with re-arranging?
2016-09-23 09:10:51	leebre	its probably right, yes
2016-09-23 09:11:07	leebre	wheni am - re arranging, i am doinit  without score...
2016-09-23 09:11:08	dmbaturin	Sometimes the arrange just needs improvement, sometimes you need to change instrumentation etc.
2016-09-23 09:11:23	leebre	this way, i am assuring i am understadning a very lil what is going onmuscially
2016-09-23 09:11:41	leebre	yeah, she talked about instrumentations
2016-09-23 09:12:13	dmbaturin	Well, a lot of things are just easier with a score. You can do certain things by copying and pasting once you have one chorus, or you can see what each instrument is going and where is it in the chord.
2016-09-23 09:12:42	dmbaturin	It's also easier to look a few bars back than to rewind and listen.
2016-09-23 09:13:06	leebre	sometimes you have to change score pages to look back...but yes...makes sense
2016-09-23 09:13:25	leebre	nah, probably i will never hear from them..better
2016-09-23 09:14:16	dmbaturin	And don't forget, working with a multi-part score makes you look smart. ;)
2016-09-23 09:15:36	leebre	she was strange, i guess she doesnt wantedto be smart, shestarted talkin to me after i made my points...i asked if she studied piano, she said no, she went to a conservatorium, which is quite the same, i would answer with yes if i would have studied on a conservatorium

2016-09-23 10:11:50	leebre	thanks alot, means alot to me ;)
2016-09-23 10:12:10	dmbaturin	Anyway, eating elemental magnesium will work, even if it's not the sanest way to get some magnesium.
2016-09-23 10:12:13	leebre	beside that,  you need to drink water to clinse your liver andkidneys
2016-09-23 10:12:54	leebre	so, drinking water that is naturally saturized with magnesium is a good idea, i think, really
2016-09-23 10:13:41	leebre	but sure, you cantake it in another form, as it is distributed to you
2016-09-23 10:14:09	leebre	too much calcium is not good for men, but essential for women
2016-09-23 10:15:00	leebre	contrapunctus you should really read about B12 ...this is really crazy, most important, seems to be micro organisms, B12...eat an organic produced apple and dont wash it
2016-09-23 10:15:37	leebre	do you know how and why meat has B12...wheni would tell , many people would not want to eat anymore meat then hehehehe
2016-09-23 10:15:39	dmbaturin	Just don't try magnesium sulfate. It, like most other sulfates, is not absorbed into the bloodstream. Instead it, through osmotic pressure, draws water into your intestines (you can guess the effect now).
2016-09-23 10:15:59	leebre	brrrrr, sounds bad
2016-09-23 10:16:24	dmbaturin	Well, sometimes it's what you want.
2016-09-23 10:16:32	contrapunctus	leebre: ...why would I consume the B12 bacteria and a zillion other possibly-harmful ones, when I could just have are more specific and probably less harmful subset?
2016-09-23 10:17:40	leebre	because i think, the less complexity you expereince, in your food andinyour software,the better..the more complexity and refinement, the more unhealthy angerous and insecure ..i think

2016-09-23 10:18:14	dmbaturin	What's a bit funny is that humans are one of the few species that can't synthesize their own vitamin C.
2016-09-23 10:18:23	contrapunctus	leebre: no, not solaris - the other recommendation would be TempleOS
2016-09-23 10:18:37	leebre	wow, really, other animals have vitamin c in their system ?
2016-09-23 10:18:48	dmbaturin	leebre: Yep, most of them.
2016-09-23 10:19:01	dmbaturin	I don't remember what the other species are, not offhand.
2016-09-23 10:19:03	holstein	i still have a legit opensolaris install CD, somewhere..
2016-09-23 10:19:11	contrapunctus	dmbaturin: I blame oranges and limes. So addictive -> we cease making our own.

2016-09-23 10:20:06	contrapunctus	o.o
2016-09-23 10:20:09	leebre	B12 seems most important, and its inthe end microbacterias and what they left over...resource for B12 is meat
2016-09-23 10:20:14	contrapunctus	dmbaturin , holstein - what's it like?
2016-09-23 10:20:30	holstein	opensolaris?
2016-09-23 10:20:37	dmbaturin	contrapunctus: Well, it doesn't work this way. All humans are incapable of synthesizing it, whether they ever ate oranges or not.
2016-09-23 10:20:38	leebre	and when you read about that you will see, that B12 is in the part of the animals where you dont want to pet it
2016-09-23 10:20:38	holstein	unsupported ;)
2016-09-23 10:21:03	contrapunctus	dmbaturin: unfunny joke was joke ;)
2016-09-23 10:21:05	leebre	yeah, its old
2016-09-23 10:21:09	dmbaturin	contrapunctus: The system is quite nice, but package repos were, still are, and probably always will be a sour topic.
2016-09-23 10:21:14	leebre	but there is a successor of opensolaris i guess
2016-09-23 10:21:22	contrapunctus	dmbaturin: why?
2016-09-23 10:22:13	leebre	As a result of this recirculation it actually takes, on average, 20 to 30 years to become deficient after becoming a strict vegan.  That is if no vitamin B12 were consumed�which is impossible, even on a strict vegan diet, because of bacterial sources of B12 from the person�s bowel, contaminated vegetable foods, and the environment.�

2016-09-23 12:21:07	bluebell	[20:56:54] Java was invented by Sun to sell RAM [20:56:54]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	contrapunctus	[20:56:58] lmao [20:56:58]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	contrapunctus	[20:58:18] there is this paper on concurrency models that mentions that the hardware industry benefits greatly from better concurrency models NOT being accepted and taught [20:58:18]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	dmbaturin	[20:59:00] contrapunctus: Concurrency or parallelism? ;) [20:59:00]

2016-09-23 12:21:07	leebre	[20:59:20] hehehe, cups was invented by apple ? [20:59:20]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	dmbaturin	[20:59:44] leebre: Not really. It somehow became maintained by apple in the end, but they didn't invent it. [20:59:44]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	leebre	[21:00:06] and now its not maintained anymore by apple ... [21:00:06]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	dmbaturin	[21:00:27] Frankly, at least cups doesn't just stop working without even writing logs, like windows printing service does. Or used to at least, thankfully I haven't had to touch it in a good while. [21:00:27]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	leebre	[21:01:28] yeah, i can print from my phone hehehe, also from linux laptops, for sure, yeah, youneed cups and the ppd firmware. ithink that was the term, ppd... [21:01:28]

2016-09-23 12:21:07	jubo2	[21:04:26] Today I've been smoking dank stuff from wake-up to fall-asleep and drinking excessive amounts of mild beer [21:04:26]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	contrapunctus	[21:04:35] Herzlich willkommen, jubo2 [21:04:35]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	jubo2	[21:04:41] I gotta admit the last 10 or so day have been slightly misty [21:04:41]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	jubo2	[21:05:03] yeah.. and I've been at this for 6 weeks [21:05:03]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	jubo2	[21:05:19] it is.. it is.. it is hazy after a few weeks [21:05:19]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	jubo2	[21:06:06] especially after like 4-5 weeks [21:06:06]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	jubo2	[21:06:30] Sure if I did it for years and years I'd reach new levels of hazy state of mind [21:06:30]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	jubo2	[21:07:45] If anyone wanna do a research program on "What happens to human after toking up hard for 3650 days" I'm all up for it [21:07:45]

2016-09-23 12:21:07	contrapunctus	[21:09:26] jubo2: instead, you merely get brain damage! [21:09:26]

2016-09-23 12:21:07	jubo2	[21:10:02] The amount of Ganja they sadistically forced those research monkeys to smoke [21:10:02]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	jubo2	[21:10:23] it could'a been like chamomille, wheat or n9o [21:10:23]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	jubo2	[21:10:40] and do we say those substances cause brain damage? [21:10:40]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	leebre	[21:11:29] kids, dont smoke wheat ! Dont sniff starch, dont push soy cream! [21:11:29]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	jubo2	[21:11:33] No, because none of those substances are a threat to cotton industry or pharmaceutical industry [21:11:33]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	contrapunctus	[21:11:49] okay, okay. [21:11:49]
