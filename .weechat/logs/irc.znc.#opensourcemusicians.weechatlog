2016-09-16 01:33:46	JackWinter	leebre: you mean kernel 4.6.7 etc?
2016-09-16 01:33:56	leebre	yes
2016-09-16 01:33:58	leebre	;)
2016-09-16 01:34:12	leebre	but we are now at 3.7 heading towards 3.8 next week maybe
2016-09-16 01:34:14	JackWinter	I really don't know.  There is just a patch out for 4.6.7-rt13, am about to boot into that one.
2016-09-16 01:34:24	leebre	i am allreeady running that
2016-09-16 01:34:39	leebre	i can confirm it builds, installs and runs fine hehehe

2016-09-16 01:34:50	leebre	running in now on 3 laptops
2016-09-16 01:34:52	leebre	it
2016-09-16 01:35:16	leebre	question would be, in the past,there were only rt patches for the even, or ?
2016-09-16 01:35:32	leebre	so, next rt patches would be for 3.8, right ?
2016-09-16 01:36:00	JackWinter	for what comes in the future i don't really know.  i think i read somewhere that 4.9 will be a lts, so it's possible they hold off until that one comes out..
2016-09-16 01:36:54	leebre	i am steppin out now, i think i am not interrsted in kernels higher then 4.7
2016-09-16 01:37:17	JackWinter	i don't understad the 3.7 3.8 that you keep writing?
2016-09-16 01:37:18	leebre	right we are at 4 now, still writing 3 hehehehe i mean v3 is not too long ago hehehe
2016-09-16 01:37:21	leebre	yeah
2016-09-16 01:37:23	leebre	mistake
2016-09-16 01:37:27	leebre	its 4.7
2016-09-16 01:37:36	leebre	i forgot that we are at 4 now hehehe

2016-09-16 01:38:45	leebre	thanks, but i will stay at 4.67-rt13 because it runs great here, really
2016-09-16 01:38:45	JackWinter	or just stay with 4.6.7-rt13 if that works good for you
2016-09-16 01:38:49	leebre	yeah
2016-09-16 01:39:02	leebre	that is good, all others were good too, though you named regressions
2016-09-16 01:39:23	leebre	i pimped a lil the aur build script hehehe
2016-09-16 01:39:45	leebre	no numa, no 686 configs....
2016-09-16 01:39:57	JackWinter	don't know if you have any nvidia, there is some problem due to changes in kernel, so driver for 4.6 don't work for 4.7, etc.  but maybe they've patched that in the nvidia driver already so that it works on all kernels
2016-09-16 01:40:15	leebre	i am staying away from nvidia and amd/ati
2016-09-16 01:40:26	JackWinter	since you probably don't have a numa capable machine, i don't know how that will help ;)
2016-09-16 01:40:44	leebre	its a patch less that is applied i guess, thats all
2016-09-16 01:41:12	JackWinter	ok, i don't see the point, but each to his own
2016-09-16 01:41:30	leebre	i know i am totally wrong, and i am surely dontknow what i am doing but show me some one who knows exactly in detail how any aspects of his life has impacts on anything related
2016-09-16 01:41:43	JackWinter	maybe you'll turn up some bug as you're probably all alone with such a config ;)
2016-09-16 01:42:14	JackWinter	no one knows that, that's for sure.  some people are more awake than others though ;)
2016-09-16 01:42:51	JackWinter	jack 0.125.0 is out too, if you want some fun
2016-09-16 01:43:19	JackWinter	fixes a few things, no more negative xruns, and it properly reports latency to clients.
2016-09-16 01:43:45	leebre	i want fun hehehe
2016-09-16 01:44:20	JackWinter	there is also a fix for wineasio on https://github.com/jhernberg/wineasio, it now also reports correct latency from jack to reaper ;)
2016-09-16 01:44:34	leebre	and now jack 2 alsa  sequencer midi works ??? never could get that bridge runnin to connect for example drumgizmo with qtractor...
2016-09-16 01:44:43	leebre	cool
2016-09-16 01:44:55	JackWinter	thinking of splitting up the wineasio pkgbuild too, one wineasio and a lib32-wineasio
2016-09-16 01:45:00	leebre	wineasio is rock stable hehehe
2016-09-16 01:45:18	leebre	to get rid of multilib repo, i dont need that anymore hehehe
2016-09-16 01:45:19	JackWinter	don't think much happens with jack2 anymore...
2016-09-16 01:45:44	leebre	what do you mean??? no further developmnt on jack2 ?
2016-09-16 01:45:44		[01:45]
2016-09-16 01:45:56	JackWinter	yeah, i don't think wineasio's callback can be improved, it can't really get faster than it is
2016-09-16 01:46:25	JackWinter	there hasn't been much more than the occasional bug fix for years now.  several things broken in jack2..
2016-09-16 01:46:52	leebre	kay, so jack2, the future became the past hehehe
2016-09-16 01:47:01	JackWinter	for jack1, paul davies just stepped down, and falktx is becoming the new maintainer, so hopefully we'll see new stuff
2016-09-16 01:47:04	leebre	everything is breaking
2016-09-16 01:47:18	leebre	i am reading smart people analyzing that claiming systemd mostly for all that
2016-09-16 01:47:46	leebre	from problems with alsa over dbus and anything else hehehe, maybe i am just reading wrong stuff from right peopl ehehehehe
2016-09-16 01:48:00	JackWinter	beh, some things work well and are smart, but other really suck with systemd (depending on your point of view)
2016-09-16 01:48:13	leebre	somehow, here, again, EVERYTHING is running perfect, there is not even a lil edge
2016-09-16 01:48:39	leebre	everything, nothing left, time to live!
2016-09-16 01:48:40	JackWinter	time for reboot

2016-09-16 01:53:10	leebre	but arch linux and openrc works best here, and it dont even works best, i think others havin much trouble, though still using opensource/gnu and linux, still experiencing troubles.....

2016-09-16 02:02:40	JazzyEagle	Still waking up.
2016-09-16 02:03:42	leebre	i invented some nice methods  for wakin up, because  i experienced in the past that sometimes i didnt really waked up and noticed that when driving with the car on the freeway
2016-09-16 02:03:52	JazzyEagle	lol
2016-09-16 02:04:06	leebre	really bad, when drivin on the freeway and you are noticing, shit, i am quite sleeping hehehe
2016-09-16 02:04:41	leebre	good thoughts for waking up are ugly, dangerous and kinky thoughts...
2016-09-16 02:07:17	leebre	do you all have linux audio meetings in your town ???  where is your next linux audio group located ???
2016-09-16 02:07:30	JazzyEagle	For driving, I have to keep switching up what I listen to.
2016-09-16 02:08:11	JazzyEagle	leebre: Not sure there are any around me.  Linux isn't as popular here in the states, unfortunately.  There are Linux meetups, but for me, I'd have to drive to one of the cities, which is a minimum of 45 minutes away, and they're not audio specific.
2016-09-16 02:08:25	leebre	there are linux audio meetings in the town i am livin in, cologne...

2016-09-16 02:10:36	leebre	maybe this is unique in europe...do not know
2016-09-16 02:11:03	JazzyEagle	I don't think it's necessarily unique, but it is definitely more popular there.
2016-09-16 02:11:07	leebre	i am not a great come together guy, but i really think this is great, a group of people dedicated to linux audio, meeting from time to time in real!
2016-09-16 02:13:01	leebre	i might leave germany and move to east europe, though i dont like the mntality there, but its not so different fromgermany partiots...

2016-09-16 03:32:37	JazzyEagle	I thought the package names for debian were jack & jack2.
2016-09-16 03:32:39	JazzyEagle	Hrmm..
2016-09-16 03:32:53	JazzyEagle	I'm not much of a debian pro.  This may be better for someone else to look at.
2016-09-16 03:37:53	leebre	there is a change now with dbus i think, now its somehow split packages, andoneis a X11 dbus package that automatically starts dbus when X session is started...maybe thats related to that
2016-09-16 03:40:46	leebre	ooop, i didnt got the job, had a wierd call with the HR manager, mmhhh.....i felt a turning point now, i was honestabout my past and it seemed people talked bad about me ...i mean i told himi had a bad time and that i mastered alcoholism, depression and overweight and that before that tme, i also worked int he industry and maybe some one talked bad about me because he remeberd me from that time...

2016-09-16 06:44:50	holstein	oh yeah. the kernel is *very* responsive
2016-09-16 06:44:57	holstein	before, i would just hit the button, and nothing..
2016-09-16 06:45:19	holstein	i had to take the hard drive to another box, and chroot in, to do the upgrade.. no responsiveness..
2016-09-16 06:45:25	holstein	but, *now*!.. its like magic
2016-09-16 06:45:36	leebre	right hehehehe, and now i am so fast that the illuminati have allready called three times, but i told them my girlfriend is not well right now
2016-09-16 06:45:39	holstein	magic.lib is finally where it needs to be.. all you have to do is believe..
2016-09-16 06:45:53	leebre	no i donthave to believe anymore
2016-09-16 06:45:57	leebre	just breathe
2016-09-16 06:47:00	leebre	iam starting now making some videos, with insane latencys and configs and performance sessions...all on old laptop hehehe
2016-09-16 06:47:13	JackWinter	leebre: i doubt that there is any real change that affects any of us...
2016-09-16 06:47:23	holstein	oh yeah! thats where its at!
2016-09-16 06:47:24	leebre	its all perception
2016-09-16 06:47:49	holstein	i mean, new computers are a fraction of the cost, but, its all about getting a P3 and doing professional production work
2016-09-16 06:47:53	leebre	if we wouldnt al agree on that flying cangaroo, science would say, if we havent seen it, it doesnt exist
2016-09-16 06:48:11	holstein	oh!, and the years of one's time, spent, configuring... a bargain!
2016-09-16 06:48:26	leebre	allways invest in yourself
2016-09-16 06:48:36	leebre	you can do that by living each second like it were tzh
2016-09-16 06:48:39	leebre	the last
2016-09-16 06:49:00	leebre	not one second wasted here, enjoyed everything
2016-09-16 06:49:00	holstein	when i hire a professional.. if they have more than one core? i just laugh and say to myself.. "theres a person who doesnt know how to configure old hardware" and i leave the office..
2016-09-16 06:49:20	holstein	and, thats really all that matters. that they can take an old box, and get low latency..
2016-09-16 06:49:34	holstein	who cares how they sound...
2016-09-16 06:49:35	leebre	not neccessarily
2016-09-16 06:49:40	leebre	no one cares
2016-09-16 06:49:44	leebre	most people are deaf
2016-09-16 06:49:55	holstein	right.. its *all* about latency, on old hardware
2016-09-16 06:50:03	leebre	those who are not deaf are quite sure about their listening habbits
2016-09-16 06:50:12	holstein	i look for it posted on their linkden profiles..
2016-09-16 06:50:23	leebre	but sure music is important, yes
2016-09-16 06:50:45	holstein	i look for "pentium3, with super low latency".. i dont listen to any samples..
2016-09-16 06:51:17	leebre	i reached ny goal and i am happy as a child
2016-09-16 06:51:47	leebre	having a fast, low latency , full responsive xrun free system makes me sing again
2016-09-16 06:51:58	holstein	oh yeah.. its all that matters.. i know
2016-09-16 06:52:11	leebre	never said that, you surely know that

2016-09-16 06:53:18	holstein	i mean, if you are trying to make art, or music.. latency and xruns is all that matters

2016-09-16 06:53:58	holstein	nah.. im just being an asshole. im not putting words in your mouth. im just saying things to be an ass
2016-09-16 06:54:02	leebre	i am playing soli on bass, tapping slapping poppin, you name it, i wil play it....and yes, having a fast system helps alot, at least it helps me alot
2016-09-16 06:54:09	leebre	you are not an asshole at all
2016-09-16 06:54:13	leebre	but what should i do
2016-09-16 06:54:26	leebre	saying that all i did and al i believed in is wrong ?
2016-09-16 06:54:48	holstein	is it?
2016-09-16 06:55:00	leebre	it is not
2016-09-16 06:55:06	leebre	if it is , its by random choice
2016-09-16 06:55:08	holstein	if the "faster system" (which is not any faster, just configured differently) is helping you, *great*!
2016-09-16 06:55:23	holstein	why not make some art now?
2016-09-16 06:55:24	leebre	it helps me a lil yes
2016-09-16 06:55:28	leebre	yeah, maybe today
2016-09-16 06:55:34	holstein	yup.. maybe..
2016-09-16 06:55:45	leebre	i am maybe ...i dont like pressure
2016-09-16 06:56:15	leebre	 am saying maybe and suprise you in a positive way is better then saying yes and suprising in a negative way
2016-09-16 06:56:41	leebre	but yes, latency is not such a big issue
2016-09-16 06:56:51	leebre	(nor for me , anymore)
2016-09-16 06:57:00	leebre	now for me anymore hehehe
2016-09-16 06:57:20	leebre	but i had to get there firsdt to know that
2016-09-16 06:57:30	leebre	you could have told me before,like al people told me before
2016-09-16 06:57:46	leebre	like probably all people told you before, when you did not listen ;)
2016-09-16 06:58:00	leebre	and i am not listen too...i like to make experiences
2016-09-16 06:58:01	holstein	well, i did it a bit differently
2016-09-16 06:58:23	leebre	sure hehehe
2016-09-16 06:58:25	leebre	;)
2016-09-16 06:58:42	leebre	for a hobby musician, i am quite happy and satisfied
2016-09-16 06:59:02	leebre	no fear, no pressure but endless oportunities and fun

2016-09-16 07:06:48	nstewart	wondering if I can find any in town.
2016-09-16 07:06:53	leebre	normally, they aregivin the cheap thermal grease with the fan

2016-09-16 07:23:22	JackWinter	someone did a study on the thermal properties of tothpaste and it came out just as good.  though they thought it might dry out and change properties over time
2016-09-16 07:26:04	leebre	and that is what any paste or pad does, too, over time
2016-09-16 07:26:56	leebre	i would use the bundled fan first, it may be quiet, too, i would be curious and would use the situation, that i cant install the quiet fan
2016-09-16 07:27:24	leebre	the fan situation has gone insane, i think
2016-09-16 07:27:50	leebre	you get coolers that are far out of specifications
2016-09-16 07:28:22	leebre	800 gramm or very tall
2016-09-16 07:28:22		[07:28]
2016-09-16 07:29:17	leebre	and latest intel cpu i guess are very optimized concerning thermal power and energy performance ratio
2016-09-16 07:30:05	leebre	most important i guess is if its pwm or not...never was able to configure the fans on linux myself
2016-09-16 07:31:24	leebre	okay, cheapest solution would be eight core amd...but then there must be much money spent on silent coolers, silent power suplies and case
2016-09-16 07:32:27	leebre	i am very happy with old intel laptops, thats the solution for me...
2016-09-16 07:34:08	nstewart	that's what this is -  8 core amd with a quiet fan

2016-09-17 00:02:14	Caterpillar	Hi, I am looking for a piano software, because I have to do some voice excercizes trying to reach and keep a specific note. Which software could I try?
2016-09-17 00:04:28	bluebell	It's probably the simplest approach starting Carla, loading the FluidR3_GM.sf2 soundfont and choosing one of the first programs (Piano, Bright Piano etc.)
2016-09-17 00:04:55	bluebell	Or using qsynth and loading FluidR3_GM.sf2
2016-09-17 00:06:26	jubo2	All the positive I can do about Syria is keep donating the small monthly donation to the Finnish Red Cross and sometimes play George Wassouf to ease the homesickness of the asyl guys
2016-09-17 00:06:35	jubo2	not play like instrument

2016-09-17 00:26:06	rghvdberg	if I have the option, I choose open source
2016-09-17 00:26:16	bluebell	Where "available source" is more important than free as in free beer
2016-09-17 00:28:13	rghvdberg	software I use is so damn good .. it just happen to be open source :-)
2016-09-17 00:28:39	bluebell	:)
2016-09-17 00:29:00	rghvdberg	love the desktops available, plugins, DAWs ... feel like a kid in a candy store
2016-09-17 00:29:00		[00:29]
2016-09-17 00:30:00	bluebell	It's so much better and more fun to learn and combine open source plugins than buying a commercial "make it fat and loud" all-in-one monsterplugin
2016-09-17 00:31:19	rghvdberg	it's louder so it sounds better ...
2016-09-17 00:31:31	rghvdberg	not ...
2016-09-17 00:31:47	bluebell	our ears are used to a certain amount of compression and limiting
2016-09-17 00:32:36	bluebell	it's easier to listen to compressed music on places where it's not quiet, as in cars
2016-09-17 00:33:16	rghvdberg	mmm, I have to start working in a bit

2016-09-20 00:39:07	dreamer	[09:30:44] but it helps to get a foot in the door, you know? [09:30:44]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	dreamer	[09:30:51] also I have no clue what I'd do in the music world, honestly [09:30:51]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	dreamer	[09:31:04] just, music is one of my life's passions and I'd like to be more involved with it [09:31:04]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	leebre	[09:39:31] this was just som crazy, i was rejected when i thought i amgetting a chance for a meeting, but now, i am too bad for hard and software ...lolol...i told the man,i hardly can believe that, i told him it could be because people in the industry are remebering the times i had 60kg more wheight and was acohol addicted and depressive, ...that changed the situation [09:39:31]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	leebre	[09:40:06] i am telling you [09:40:06]

2016-09-20 00:39:07	leebre	[09:45:15] but trying toget a job is maybe like trying to get a girlfriend, you need to jumo over your shadow, people have expectations....if you dont meet that expectations you are fake or a liyer [09:45:15]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	leebre	[09:46:04] and only things that can be understood can be explained....some stuff is to wierd to be communicated hehehe [09:46:04]

2016-09-20 00:39:07	dreamer	[10:06:13] and in general don't like the effects myself [10:06:13]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	dreamer	[10:06:39] occasionally I think a nice belgian special beer is fantastic, but I really don't get the "need drink every day" crowd which is most of society [10:06:39]

2016-09-20 14:27:24	dmbaturin	holstein: I was thinking about Four and What Is This Thing Called Love, and I wrote some nonsense: https://a.pomf.cat/cthwdq.pdf , but I have no idea how to bring it to a resolution of any kind.
2016-09-20 14:28:34	holstein	dmbaturin: as far as the changes, you can check out how http://www.guitarcats.com/images/JazzStandardCharts/TUNE-UP-437.jpg got resolved..
2016-09-20 14:29:14	dmbaturin	Let me see.
2016-09-20 14:30:48	dmbaturin	...is it that now I know enough literature to get myself in trouble but not to get out of trouble. ;)
2016-09-20 14:32:51	dmbaturin	Interesting. My next thought was another ii V I like there, but the part after this goes over my head. Let me try it by sound.
2016-09-20 14:33:27	holstein	think.. ii V I IV..
2016-09-20 14:33:53	holstein	then, its really just ii V, that doest resolve..
2016-09-20 14:34:28	holstein	"false 2 5's" or whatever you want to call them
2016-09-20 14:34:40	Stuzz	I get the impression that you write from what you know, rather than what you hear
2016-09-20 14:34:43	holstein	like in "four".. the bridge..
2016-09-20 14:35:11	holstein	yeah. ideally, you would just write what you hear, and worry about the terms and whatnot later, if you want
2016-09-20 14:35:43	holstein	sometimes, it may take some work looking at how others have done things, to get an idea of what one wants to do..
2016-09-20 14:36:10	Stuzz	Write whatever, and then use (or don't) your knowledge to choose a direction you'll be satisfied with
2016-09-20 14:37:26	holstein	or, chosedly (if you will) not satisfied with..

2016-09-20 14:41:18	dmbaturin	Stuzz: Usually it's a mix of both, like a melodic idea I made up set (or developed via) a theoretical harmonic device, or something in this fashion.
2016-09-20 14:42:03	dmbaturin	And, theoretical devices themselves are symbolic representation of perfectly real aural entities too.
2016-09-20 14:44:17	holstein	sometimes, i try and just go with what i have.. as in, i try and capture the melody im hearing, on its own..
2016-09-20 14:44:40	holstein	if i can get it, and a bass note, at the same time, great.. if not, i just keep going.. with the melody, til i have that entire thing
2016-09-20 14:44:57	holstein	i'll then try and hear what the harmony is from there, if needed..
2016-09-20 14:45:12	holstein	sometimes, i get the whole thing in one burst.. but not often
2016-09-20 14:46:39	dmbaturin	I started doing something like this lately, with guide tones. Though I often can't quickly get what this or that tone may imply in context, when I find one that sounds good.

2016-09-20 15:30:16	dmbaturin	holstein: In other news, I started the formal clarinet lessons. At the first lesson the instructor made me play over a loudly played alto sax, the idea being that you just can't compete with it if your embouchure is too stiff or breath support is not strong enough.
2016-09-20 15:30:57	holstein	interesting
2016-09-20 15:31:06	holstein	you mean, he was playing the alto sax?
2016-09-20 15:31:33	dmbaturin	Yep, suggested to play this or that scale and played it with me.
2016-09-20 15:31:57	Stuzz	Do you need to compete with that?
2016-09-20 15:32:00	Stuzz	Or anything?
2016-09-20 15:32:47	dmbaturin	Well, technically not, but it reveals technique problems quickly.
2016-09-20 15:38:00		[15:32]
2016-09-20 15:38:42	dmbaturin	What I learnt about good emouchure and breath support this way is perfectly applicable when I'm playing quietly at home of course.
2016-09-20 15:43:40	dmbaturin	...though I'd better memorize the upper register fingerings by the next saturday, I didn't bother because I thought I can't play in it yet.

2016-09-20 15:53:23	dmbaturin	I think a lot of system-config-* is not exactly alive anymore.

2016-09-20 15:54:14	dmbaturin	What I find most annoying is that system-config-*-tui is even deader. It was really handy on headless machines with no X.

2016-09-20 15:57:30	holstein	stop
2016-09-20 15:57:37	holstein	back those up.. 3 2 1 rule
2016-09-20 15:57:43	holstein	then, have *no* fear, and do what is needed
2016-09-20 15:58:14	dmbaturin	Just keep backups of baby pictures, and destroy whatever you want safely. ;) Anyway, most likely that's an actual bug rather than simple version incompatibility. You are probably safer with pvresize than with that anyway.
2016-09-20 15:59:52	nstewart	not planning to do anything to that volume, do have a backup, WC would be lose the last month or so.
2016-09-20 16:00:22	nstewart	but it still sucks to have to restore, kills a bunch of time cause its slooow. mostly due to massive amounts of duplication

2016-09-20 18:53:18	holstein	[01:31:06] you mean, he was playing the alto sax? [01:31:06]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[01:31:33] Yep, suggested to play this or that scale and played it with me. [01:31:33]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	Stuzz	[01:31:57] Do you need to compete with that? [01:31:57]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	Stuzz	[01:32:00] Or anything? [01:32:00]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[01:32:47] Well, technically not, but it reveals technique problems quickly. [01:32:47]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[01:38:42] What I learnt about good emouchure and breath support this way is perfectly applicable when I'm playing quietly at home of course. [01:38:42]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[01:43:40] ...though I'd better memorize the upper register fingerings by the next saturday, I didn't bother because I thought I can't play in it yet. [01:43:40]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	nstewart	[01:52:30] is system-config-lvm dead? not liking my python in ubuntu studio 16.04 [01:52:30]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[01:53:23] I think a lot of system-config-* is not exactly alive anymore. [01:53:23]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[01:53:35] nstewart: What exactly it doesn't like? [01:53:35]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[01:54:14] What I find most annoying is that system-config-*-tui is even deader. It was really handy on headless machines with no X. [01:54:14]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	nstewart	[01:54:29] http://pastebin.com/8usWSKS1 [01:54:29]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	nstewart	[01:55:23] I get all kinda  nervous and lose my command line fu when it comes to destroying baby pictures and the like. [01:55:23]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[01:55:46] nstewart: That's not exactly not liking python, something there returns None when the callee expects some kind of physical volume object. [01:55:46]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	holstein	[01:57:30] stop [01:57:30]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	holstein	[01:57:37] back those up.. 3 2 1 rule [01:57:37]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	holstein	[01:57:43] then, have *no* fear, and do what is needed [01:57:43]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[01:58:14] Just keep backups of baby pictures, and destroy whatever you want safely. ;) Anyway, most likely that's an actual bug rather than simple version incompatibility. You are probably safer with pvresize than with that anyway. [01:58:14]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	nstewart	[01:59:52] not planning to do anything to that volume, do have a backup, WC would be lose the last month or so. [01:59:52]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	nstewart	[02:00:22] but it still sucks to have to restore, kills a bunch of time cause its slooow. mostly due to massive amounts of duplication [02:00:22]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	holstein	[02:05:06] well, you dont *have* to restore, yet :) [02:05:06]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	holstein	[02:05:12] just make sure you have backups, and work without fear.. [02:05:12]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	holstein	[02:05:20] sometimes, when you mess with things, things get messy.. [02:05:20]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	holstein	[02:05:47] ^ and you can quote me on that.. [02:05:47]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	nstewart	[02:08:10] least I was supposed to. nas appears to be lost after firmware update [02:08:10]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	nstewart	[02:08:16] postpone [02:08:16]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[02:08:31] nstewart: Make your own NAS with a real OS. [02:08:31]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	nstewart	[02:17:24] it has a real os. they just didn't see fit to provide actual root access :) [02:17:24]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	dmbaturin	[02:23:12] My friend once bought a NAS that turned out to automatically backup all his data to vendor's servers, without his consent or a way to opt out. [02:23:12]
2016-09-20 18:53:18	kwfuccf	[04:34:53] how do i tell what the sound is being diverted to in kx studio //and dont say kmix cuz that program is bull shit it just lest u tell the program where tog not where it is actualy doining any way to tell what kx studio is actualy doing [04:34:53]

2016-09-20 21:43:43	Franklin_	Need help can't get cadence to start the icon spins at the bottom of the screen then it dissapears.  Can't configure jack for my 2i2.  Have an intel nuc I built.  It did boot up once when I moved the computer to my Sony TV - monitor then it went away.  I set cadence to boot at start up.  I'll keep trying.  Would ubuntu studio work better for me?
2016-09-20 21:47:15	Franklin_	I've had great luck with my big computer running KX studio on a MSATA SSD.  But this miniature Intel NUC i-7 power house has (no sound).  Like I sad it worked one time in a different configuation.

2016-09-21 07:19:40	JackWinter	if you don't want to use a -rt kernel (but i also use one for years and it crashes no more than any other kernel), at least add the "threadirqs" to your "low-lat" kernel.
2016-09-21 07:20:21	JackWinter	that will make the kernel run most of the interrupt handlers as threads, so that you can set a high priority for your soundcards interrupt

2016-09-21 07:21:16	NeoFrontier	where is klopsi4u ?
2016-09-21 07:21:42	treetop	I kept it 95 thanks HerrZen
2016-09-21 07:22:00	HerrZen	95
2016-09-21 07:22:01	JackWinter	HerrZen: and when it comes to linux realtime one value isn't better than another.  it's just that a thread of a higher priority will preempt threads of lower priority, so it's the relative priority value and not the absolute that is important
2016-09-21 07:22:04	treetop	JackWinter: should I recompile? :)
2016-09-21 07:22:30	JackWinter	sorry, that was for treetop ;)

2016-09-21 07:25:27	JackWinter	treetop: that has nothing to do with realtime or kernel

2016-09-21 07:26:08	treetop	I will research on the threadirqs thing, I thought it was a flag for kernel compiling
2016-09-21 07:26:42	treetop	ohh boot argument

2016-09-21 07:28:03	JackWinter	the way i set it up, is the priority of the soundcard interrupt handler thread at 95, jack realtime at 80.  and that should be all you need, in addition to the limits.conf and either booting a rt kernel or using the "threadirqs"  boot flag with a vanilla kernel

2016-09-22 07:37:26	frinknet	It seems like creating your own sampleset in gigedit or swami might be an easy solution
2016-09-22 07:37:49	frinknet	Otherwise you might try Giada - although it might be overkill for you.
2016-09-22 07:38:18	frinknet	Buth will require a significant bit of setup.
2016-09-22 07:39:20	frinknet	Mixxx will not give you access to enough sounds I think

2016-09-22 07:42:14	frinknet	Depends on whehter you are more interested in beds or one shots
2016-09-22 07:42:42	thebishop	frinknet, it's slightly different usecases that could be done by one piece of software. 1. one-shot soundboard stuff (fabla handles this great) 2. playing extended audio clips that can be paused/resumed with my live commentary in between
2016-09-22 07:42:51	frinknet	Sampler will do one shots easier while Giada will do beds better
2016-09-22 07:43:17	thebishop	can you say what a "bed" is? I've never heard that term
2016-09-22 07:43:53	thebishop	nvm i found it
2016-09-22 07:43:55	frinknet	A music bed is a loop of background music that plays while an anoucer is talking
2016-09-22 07:43:57	thebishop	yeah, i'd like that two
2016-09-22 07:44:06	thebishop	that's a 3rd thing i also might want :(
2016-09-22 07:44:44	frinknet	I toured iHeart Radio in Tucson about a year ago and learned a lot about how radio works today
2016-09-22 07:45:26	frinknet	mostly everything is pre-recorded except for live traffic hours in the morning and evening.
2016-09-22 07:46:56	frinknet	They are basically provided set of music to organize and play allong with commercials. Then they record their talking bits in between and run everything together. This is all managed from a web application.
2016-09-22 07:47:16	frinknet	Many times the DJ you hear on the radio isn't even in the same state!
2016-09-22 07:49:45	frinknet	But for live work you have a set of beds and shots on a grid controller (like a launchpad) and then you have a music DJ application like Mixxx or something similar.
2016-09-22 07:50:15	frinknet	There is an open source Radio management suite that I saw somewhere a while back.

2016-09-22 07:58:30	thebishop	frinknet, thanks, it's really a podcast, but i'd like to be able to record semi "live" so that all the hosts hear the samples and stuff so it feels natural to the listener
2016-09-22 07:58:48	thebishop	frinknet, i hadnt considered using mixxx for the whole thing (ardour + fabla right now), but maybe that's worth a look
2016-09-22 08:00:35	thebishop	airtime looks kind of like overkill for my needs (i'm not running an actual station!), but i like what i'm seeing
2016-09-22 08:02:22	thebishop	i don't think mixxx is gonna give me the per-track (e.g. microphone) control i'd want ideally, but i do have a mixing board for that

2016-09-22 08:18:43	frinknet	A lot of it is just getting outside the box of tradition to look at what's possible.
2016-09-22 08:20:37	frinknet	Sir-Mix-A-Lot carries a Blue Kiwi and Tascam interface around with him and does his lunch hour radio show from the road in the mornings and afternoons from his hotel room
2016-09-22 08:22:20	frinknet	If you're doing a podcast Ardour is probably your friend. In that case you may not want to do music beds live but come back and put them in at post production. But SFX live via some midi controller makes sense. You can also record the SFX into a separate track on your DAW so you can adjust mix and timing.
2016-09-22 08:23:01	frinknet	Probably creating a sample set would be easier for that scenario

2016-09-23 01:39:13	leebre	i think synthclone is a great software, that will play animportant role in near future, when the original analog synth's are starting to rott away..i mean, even the spare parts of those are becoming rare, for sure, so capturing the sound with synthclone is a nice idea to keep the sounds alive for future musicians...

2016-09-23 01:40:22	leebre	what could be the next step of synthclone would be adding two controllers, so, that it can capture also the modulation....yeah, but hey, sure....
2016-09-23 01:45:48	JazzyEagle	I wonder if there could be some sort of "IR" files for synths.  Obviously IR itself can't be measured, but there has to be something unique about each of the synths that could be identified and put into some sort of emulation tool...
2016-09-23 01:48:46	leebre	yes
2016-09-23 01:48:50	leebre	JazzyEagle
2016-09-23 01:48:54	leebre	and hello to you ;)
2016-09-23 01:49:05	JazzyEagle	Hello to you as well.
2016-09-23 01:49:35	leebre	probem would be that you would need a synth with an input because youhave to feed it with a 1 bit click or a frequency sweep over the whole spectrum
2016-09-23 01:49:37	leebre	:)
2016-09-23 01:49:55	leebre	thats why i think, for synth, sampling would be fine
2016-09-23 01:50:41	JazzyEagle	Sampling is fine, until you want to start changing oscillator, envelope, filter, etc. settings.
2016-09-23 01:50:41		[01:50]
2016-09-23 01:51:00	leebre	the other approachwould be , getting the blue prints, the whole construction scheme, then we could scan or load it into asimulator that checks electronic designs for errors by running simulations on it
2016-09-23 01:51:05	JazzyEagle	Then it becomes too much of a nightmare to have sampling for every possible setting.
2016-09-23 01:51:20	leebre	hehehe, right
2016-09-23 01:51:27	leebre	but you dont need so many controllers
2016-09-23 01:51:47	leebre	maybe cutoff freq and resonace would be enough for a synth like the 303
2016-09-23 01:52:02	leebre	2 modulation controllers then....
2016-09-23 01:52:11	leebre	128 step each hehehe
2016-09-23 01:52:25	leebre	n¹²⁸
2016-09-23 01:52:44	JazzyEagle	I have no idea.  I'm not much of a synth guy.
2016-09-23 01:54:15	JazzyEagle	I would assume, though, that most plugins with oscillators would be able to handle the sounds from these older synths, right?  I mean, does the make of oscillator make a big difference on the sound?  Doesn't 500Hz sound like the same 500Hz tone regardless of oscillator, or can it sound different for different oscillators?

2016-09-23 01:54:37	leebre	it sounds different
2016-09-23 01:54:47	leebre	because the analog oscilators had drifts too
2016-09-23 01:54:49	JazzyEagle	Hrm.
2016-09-23 01:54:51	leebre	also the analog filters
2016-09-23 01:54:55	leebre	thats what i have heardt
2016-09-23 01:55:04	leebre	i could be so wrong, i would bet on that
2016-09-23 01:55:41	leebre	also, you may want another oscilator source then sine hehehehe
2016-09-23 01:56:10	JazzyEagle	Well, yeah, but most oscillators can do more than just sine.
2016-09-23 01:56:15	JazzyEagle	Ok, let me ask it this way, then...
2016-09-23 01:56:24	leebre	and then, quite sure, you get different results....linear oscillators like square or saw or ramp, which are all quite popular...i think its the steepness ...
2016-09-23 01:56:32	JazzyEagle	Does a 500Hz sine wave sound the same across all oscillators?
2016-09-23 01:57:06	leebre	i would guess, when talking about analog oscillatorsm i guess, they all sound slightly different
2016-09-23 01:57:17	JazzyEagle	Assuming the same set amplitude (assuming again amplitude can be set)
2016-09-23 01:57:19	leebre	but i am quite sure when we are talking about saw oscillators
2016-09-23 01:57:41	leebre	these are sounding different....you could find out easily
2016-09-23 01:58:14	leebre	get record of two different synths with sine oscillators and look atthe wav files int he audio editor...
2016-09-23 01:58:37	JazzyEagle	Considering I have no audio hardware and oscillators are kind of expensive/hard to come by, I'll get right on that...
2016-09-23 01:58:38	leebre	pick up the phone
2016-09-23 01:58:53	JazzyEagle	Well, synth hardware, I do have a USB audio interface...
2016-09-23 01:58:56	leebre	we should all hear the same beeep, the sine, but i think it sounds different all the time
2016-09-23 01:59:26	leebre	but you are asking some one who is known for knowing not much hehehehe
2016-09-23 01:59:41	JazzyEagle	I'm just musing about it in general.
2016-09-23 01:59:52	JazzyEagle	I wasn't expecting answers.  :)
2016-09-23 02:00:05	leebre	thats a relief hehehe
2016-09-23 02:01:26	leebre	but as we all know , every sound, exists of many sine partials...so maybe, the sine is the mother of all sounds hehehe, and all sine sounds sounding the same...but i am doubting it
2016-09-23 02:02:37	leebre	its hard to get linear eletric power from the power socket, vice versa, its maybe hard to get a smooth sine wave, that is totally smooth and perrfectly interpolated, if produced digitally...
2016-09-23 02:04:11	leebre	must do some things, see you later ;)

2016-09-23 07:14:36	holstein	you also, dont have to say "yes"..
2016-09-23 07:14:57	leebre	i feel forced too, i have my standards, allways friendly, allways a helpinghand
2016-09-23 07:15:03	holstein	right
2016-09-23 07:15:07	holstein	thats not really a friend though
2016-09-23 07:15:13	holstein	thats some kind of barter system..
2016-09-23 07:15:14	leebre	no friendshere hehehe
2016-09-23 07:15:23	holstein	like "hey, you do this for me, so, i'll do this for you"

2016-09-23 07:15:35	holstein	thats something.. but, not really the definition of a friendship
2016-09-23 07:15:37	leebre	this is normal, yes
2016-09-23 07:15:51	holstein	friends? they are just your friends.. if you dont want to go where they ask, its not that you are no longer friends
2016-09-23 07:16:09	leebre	hereits slightly different, all the time, wholelife, i experienced friendly supportive people, i have to give back
2016-09-23 07:16:09	holstein	i mean, i dont go anywhere either.. but, i just say "no, im not going"
2016-09-23 07:16:27	leebre	i said yes,shit
2016-09-23 07:16:40	leebre	an now the guy put meon the list, its disrespect not going there
2016-09-23 07:16:41	holstein	then, you go..
2016-09-23 07:16:46	holstein	its not a problem to say no to a friend
2016-09-23 07:16:52	leebre	but it starts at 23 and goes to 5 in the morning
2016-09-23 07:16:55	holstein	the problem is, to say yes, and then, not go
2016-09-23 07:17:07	leebre	probably
2016-09-23 07:17:08	holstein	thats not something a friend does..
2016-09-23 07:17:09	leebre	yes
2016-09-23 07:17:11	holstein	probably?
2016-09-23 07:17:22	holstein	shit, brother. thats in the "how to be a friend" handbook
2016-09-23 07:17:26	leebre	mmmhhh...i am thinking differently
2016-09-23 07:17:30	holstein	right
2016-09-23 07:17:43	leebre	thereis no truth, wheni am believing it,its okay, i have vivid imaginations
2016-09-23 07:17:45	holstein	you can "think" as you want. but, when you say "yes, i'll be there" and dont go? thats you having lied to your friend
2016-09-23 07:17:57	holstein	which, if its a good friend, its prolly cool
2016-09-23 07:18:03	leebre	no good friend
2016-09-23 07:18:05	holstein	but, in the future, just say "no"

2016-09-23 07:18:15	leebre	imight go tonight,maybe

2016-09-23 07:19:21	leebre	really hard
2016-09-23 07:19:25	holstein	i used to say "sure" and end up spread thin.. now, i say "sure.. you can communicate with me about that in march, or april.."
2016-09-23 07:19:28	holstein	or, just "no"
2016-09-23 07:19:42	holstein	as with anything else.. it just takes practice

2016-09-23 07:20:48	leebre	it means, you are not worth anyminute of my life time
2016-09-23 07:21:08	holstein	take that  scneario.. think of how you can just answer something like "oh man!, i appreciate that, *so* much, but, im not going to be able to make time for that.."
2016-09-23 07:21:18	leebre	but he shouldnt invite people after 10 minutes chat

2016-09-23 07:23:46	leebre	yeah, and you didnt have the time anymore ?
2016-09-23 07:23:56	holstein	i didnt want to make that investment of time, any longer..
2016-09-23 07:24:13	leebre	brrr....days are so short hehehe
2016-09-23 07:25:37	leebre	i amtrying to start a carreer now, with 43....starting from zero....zero income, zero connections, zero credibility hehehehe
2016-09-23 07:26:28	leebre	i may be wrong, but i feel, i am just really, mmhh....well in physics i would say, working temperature and pressure are at maximum hehehe
2016-09-23 07:26:49	leebre	i cant spend more timne infront of computers hehehe
2016-09-23 07:28:54	dmbaturin	leebre: If you spent 43 years with no income, I bet you have some valuable experience to sell. ;)
2016-09-23 07:29:02	holstein	lol
2016-09-23 07:29:15	holstein	i mean, i dont mean to laugh. its just, always such a matter of perspective
2016-09-23 07:29:25	leebre	arrgh, no, i worked some years
2016-09-23 07:29:38	holstein	im 41, and, in the past few years, i have gotten my carpentry diploma.. not that im really doing anything with that
2016-09-23 07:29:46	leebre	its good, i can laugh about myself
2016-09-23 07:29:47	holstein	and, also, moved over to playing mostly guitar, instead of bass
2016-09-23 07:30:12	holstein	i changed my career path, at a similar time.. but, i consider it a positive. that i have the freedom to do so
2016-09-23 07:30:24	leebre	really?? wow, carpenrtry...thats tough...the glue.....all the timeson your knees i guess
2016-09-23 07:30:39	leebre	sure, me too, i have the freedom
2016-09-23 07:30:48	holstein	sure.. .so, why not frame it that way?
2016-09-23 07:30:52	leebre	and the freedom is outside and inour heads, too
2016-09-23 07:30:54	holstein	you seem to have a different story
2016-09-23 07:31:00	holstein	"im so old, and starting over, and have nothing"
2016-09-23 07:31:01	dmbaturin	leebre: Well, my point was that living with no income is... tricky to say the least. You get to be quite resourceful to live this way.
2016-09-23 07:31:19	holstein	when, you have *ultimate* freedom, to be your own boss, and not a lot of responsibility, or ties..
2016-09-23 07:31:26	leebre	no wor, no eat, no fat onyour body.....its just very easy
2016-09-23 07:31:29	holstein	sounds like, you can look at that a few different ways..
2016-09-23 07:31:41	leebre	i amunderstanding, yes
2016-09-23 07:31:52	leebre	but ilike to see it as, starting from rock bottom

2016-09-23 07:32:07	leebre	thoughi am a nobody, every one seems to know me

2016-09-23 07:32:56	leebre	its okay, feeling bad is good, i m just paying my dues
2016-09-23 07:33:15	leebre	i dont like systemd, yes

2016-09-23 07:34:13	leebre	for every woman you will meet, you need to tell another story
2016-09-23 07:34:45	holstein	but, you are not starting from "rock bottom".. or, cast out from anything..
2016-09-23 07:34:54	dmbaturin	If I'm going to approach any women, I'll just tell them I can play Confirmation in all 12 keys, and see how they react. ;)
2016-09-23 07:34:55	leebre	some how i do i thin
2016-09-23 07:34:56	leebre	really
2016-09-23 07:35:06	holstein	if you find it constructive to beat yourself up, go for it
2016-09-23 07:35:22	dmbaturin	(I should better learn to actually play in any key though)
2016-09-23 07:35:38	holstein	i always tell chicks, i can play  just as bad in all 12 keys..
2016-09-23 07:35:47	leebre	the truth....i am quite sure, there is not another person( i hope for them) who is in such deep debs without any kind of income ( - 2000 � )
2016-09-23 07:36:20	leebre	i like to tell em that i am alone my whole life, normally that ends  the talk then
2016-09-23 07:36:32	dmbaturin	-2000 eur? Man, you are damn rich compared to those with $30k in student debt. ;)
2016-09-23 07:36:34	leebre	not normally, ...allways
2016-09-23 07:36:54	leebre	the student has time to pay off and is looking to a carrer
2016-09-23 07:37:07	leebre	my banker might call tomorrow and says, its over...
2016-09-23 07:37:28	dmbaturin	Not if they can't find employment with that degree they just got!
2016-09-23 07:37:35	leebre	but its okay, i am telling you, the more you are suffering, the stronger you will get
2016-09-23 07:37:59	leebre	then they will find a partner and he pays then
2016-09-23 07:38:07	leebre	some one will pay

2016-09-23 07:38:37	holstein	me? im telling you, you *dont* have to suffer, like that.. and, its not always constructive
2016-09-23 07:38:49	holstein	imagine, giving yourself actual positive feedback, and opportunity ;)

2016-09-23 07:42:59	leebre	yes
2016-09-23 07:43:16	leebre	i like being honest, to every one

2016-09-23 07:44:18	leebre	only look at women with sun glasses....then you wont see the eyes, you wont be shocked or whatever...
2016-09-23 07:44:27	holstein	the trickier bit, is being honest with yourself :) .. at least, that is the case for me
2016-09-23 07:44:30	zarathus	hey i use archlinux and cant get my herules rmx console work to with DJ software Mixxx.
2016-09-23 07:45:02	holstein	zarathus: i would close DJ mixxx, and work with just getting that device to work with linux, generally
2016-09-23 07:45:12	leebre	i am honest to me and to others, really, i am not getting paied telling lies
2016-09-23 07:45:14	holstein	is it supportable by alsa? can you get jack running? etc..
2016-09-23 07:45:27	holstein	and go from there, with mixxx, after the system is utilizing the hardware
2016-09-23 07:45:50	holstein	leebre: lol.. we started talking because you had lied to a person you were referring to as a friend, thats not your friend ;)
2016-09-23 07:46:00	holstein	but, what do i know...
2016-09-23 07:46:07	zarathus	jack recognizes th rmx but cant start with it. jack and other soundcard work fine
2016-09-23 07:46:26	leebre	no ,it was a pal, not a friend, some one i met for the first time, but we really spoke the same language and had a good talk
2016-09-23 07:46:30	holstein	cool.. so, you can focus on that part of the chain.. the system, and jack using the device..
2016-09-23 07:46:40	holstein	DJ mixxx will "just work" when you have that sorted
2016-09-23 07:46:52	leebre	mixxx runs rock stable here
2016-09-23 07:46:57	zarathus	and mixxx doesnt show me the rmx at all
2016-09-23 07:47:01	leebre	on arch linux
2016-09-23 07:47:18	holstein	right.. it wont, *until* you sort the support out, in the system
2016-09-23 07:47:57	leebre	usb, the hercules controller should work
2016-09-23 07:47:59	holstein	when you get jack running on it, you can simply route it, in jack
2016-09-23 07:48:17	zarathus	yea, mixxx and jack together makes mixxx to freeze.
2016-09-23 07:48:34	holstein	zarathus: so, jack starts? yes or no?
2016-09-23 07:48:52	holstein	you cant have run mixx, in the other scenario you have mentioned, where, jack is not starting on the device..
2016-09-23 07:49:01	zarathus	jack is fine if i dont use rmx soundcard
2016-09-23 07:49:20	leebre	so, we have found the solution i guess
2016-09-23 07:49:35	holstein	zarathus: so, *does* jack start on the RMX? yes or no?
2016-09-23 07:49:39	zarathus	no
2016-09-23 07:49:47	holstein	so, what you say, is not testable
2016-09-23 07:49:56	zarathus	?
2016-09-23 07:50:00	leebre	please, one lil try, sorry that i am disturbing
2016-09-23 07:50:02	holstein	you cannot test that mixxx and jack together "freeze"
2016-09-23 07:50:16	leebre	disconnect the hercules controller
2016-09-23 07:50:48	leebre	no, sorry
2016-09-23 07:50:53	zarathus	i can start jack with my onboard soundcard, and other usb soundcards, and if then i start mixxx, it freezes.
2016-09-23 07:50:57	leebre	thought it wold be just a midi controller
2016-09-23 07:51:05	leebre	but its a complete audio device

2016-09-23 07:52:01	leebre	Older versions of Mixxx that did not support HID required using Hercules' MIDI driver, but it is now recommend to not use the Hercules driver on GNU/Linux. If you have it installed, it is recommended to uninstall the driver and upgrade to the latest version of Mixxx if you have not already. On Windows (and Mac OS X?) the driver is still recommended.
2016-09-23 07:52:04	zarathus	yes, my aim was to use it just as controler first, because i have a focusrite saffire6 and jack works well with it.
2016-09-23 07:52:29	holstein	right
2016-09-23 07:52:44	leebre	saffire 26 ?
2016-09-23 07:52:59	zarathus	but i think( im sure) i have the latest version of mixx
2016-09-23 07:53:00	holstein	zarathus: let me try, again, friend.. unplug *everything* else.. only have the rmx sound device hooked up.. then, work with making jack run, in that scnenario
2016-09-23 07:53:06	holstein	until that happens, you need not move on
2016-09-23 07:53:16	holstein	mixx is *not* the problem yet..
2016-09-23 07:53:16		[07:53]
2016-09-23 07:53:27	holstein	you need jack to facilitate the connection
2016-09-23 07:53:41	holstein	now, why is jack and mixx "freezing" ? with other setups? thats a different problem
2016-09-23 07:54:02	holstein	what do i suggest? download AVlinux, and see if things "just work" on that system, and you can learn about how things are to be configured from there
2016-09-23 07:54:13	mfrei	help sound card usb recomended for KxStudio
2016-09-23 07:54:35	zarathus	yes ok. holstein. you are right, but another problem is, why cant i use rmx just as midicontroler and not as soundcard
2016-09-23 07:55:16	zarathus	so how should i start to find the bug?
2016-09-23 07:55:22	holstein	zarathus: right.. and, i cannot be more clear.. unplug everything else from the machine, and work with it
2016-09-23 07:55:25	leebre	mfrei - firewire is preferred over usb, but all usb should work...rme is top notch, focusrite are great for the money...pick one
2016-09-23 07:55:26	holstein	its not  a "bug" yet ;)
2016-09-23 07:56:14	holstein	the main "bug" is, you are not promised linux support. so, you'll have to, unplug everything from the machine, and plug it *directly* in, and run some commands/tests.. til you get jack working with it, if possible
2016-09-23 07:56:34	mfrei	Thanks
2016-09-23 07:56:42	leebre	;)
2016-09-23 07:57:02	ChaosFan	firewire is dying out, I wouldn't invest in firewire stuff nowadays
2016-09-23 07:57:18	holstein	well, as long as you have the gear to use it with.. it works great..
2016-09-23 07:57:43	ChaosFan	of course - I'm just saying I wouldn't start buying firewire gear nowadays
2016-09-23 07:57:43	holstein	i have a presonus firepod..
2016-09-23 07:58:00	leebre	right, but what i dontknow, how far is firewire compatible to thundebolt...i saw recently cheap laptops with thunderbolt...so, thunderbolt is coming, i dontknow how compatible that is...
2016-09-23 07:58:00	holstein	well, i wouldnt buy *expensive* firewire gear, expecting magic support
2016-09-23 07:58:17	holstein	but, if i saw some nice interface for a few hundred, and i have the port, still..
2016-09-23 07:58:28	ChaosFan	it's becoming harder and harder to even get some pc/laptop with a firewire port, or firewire extension cards
2016-09-23 07:58:31	holstein	its certainly on the way out..
2016-09-23 07:58:44	leebre	there are really nice firewire audiointerfaces, and also mixing consoles available
2016-09-23 07:58:44	holstein	but, that can help facilitate the deal..
2016-09-23 07:59:16	leebre	and still, there are some aufio firewire interfaces, still, on the market....by now, firewire is not dead, but yes....it doesnt appear to be the future ot aufio interfaces
2016-09-23 07:59:44	ChaosFan	I'm not saying it's dead - I said it's dying ;)
2016-09-23 07:59:52	holstein	yup :/
2016-09-23 07:59:59	holstein	not sure whats next for "us"
2016-09-23 08:00:01	leebre	right hehehehe, but its slowly dying

2016-09-23 08:00:16	leebre	and slowly dying could be a bad word for livingmaybe hehehe
2016-09-23 08:01:26	leebre	i like firewire, i amusing it, have three audio interfaces here, i hope, andi think, its not dea, but right....it doesnt look as it will be the future....but no interface conncection protocol except midi could establish as a standard over decades
2016-09-23 08:02:30	ChaosFan	I just thought calling a dying technology "preferred" might be a bit misleading
2016-09-23 08:02:30	zarathus	ok, magic! jack runs well with rmx now ... only problem ... xruns
2016-09-23 08:02:54	holstein	zarathus: right.. which is *great* progress.. if maybe, you just want to run some more tests?
2016-09-23 08:03:10	holstein	try relaxing the settings.. make sure your user config is "good" etc..
2016-09-23 08:03:17	leebre	on mobile, i would prefer amd suggest it because i still think you will havemore fun and less trouble then with usb, but thats myopinion, i am no specialist
2016-09-23 08:03:25	leebre	and suggest
2016-09-23 08:03:34	holstein	see that your latency settings are reading like 20ms.. then, relax to more like 50ms, and test..
2016-09-23 08:04:25	ChaosFan	never had a problem with focusrite scarlett usb stuff, and before that I had an m-audio usb 1.1 audio interface for almost 10 years that worked well (albeit with pretty high latency - thanks to usb 1.1)
2016-09-23 08:06:45	leebre	right, ihave a nice idea, we really should write and save the questions asked here and the respective answer....then its written in stone maybe and we dont have to start discussing infront of the children ;)
2016-09-23 08:07:39	ChaosFan	but isn't the whole point of such a channel to be a place of discussion? ;)
2016-09-23 08:07:54	leebre	i would suggest firewire, but when you say usbis somehow better suited for osm's or linux beginners maybe, then i will suggest usb audio interfacesin the future
2016-09-23 08:08:24	ChaosFan	to each his own, i don't have personal experience with firewire interfaces.
2016-09-23 08:08:24		[08:08]
2016-09-23 08:08:28	holstein	i use firewire, and i think its the "best" option we have, certainly, even still.. but its not "easy"..
2016-09-23 08:08:33	leebre	allways forward....march,one two, step onthe head
2016-09-23 08:08:43	holstein	if one can use a USB device, and get what they need, i suggest that
2016-09-23 08:10:24	leebre	apple or bananna, thats allways a tough question
2016-09-23 08:11:00	ChaosFan	if you want a general answer, yes. my personal opinion on the apple vs banana question is pretty much set ;)

2016-09-23 08:18:10	holstein	if it is, and you are just getting xruns, then, you can look into these other things ^
2016-09-23 08:18:20	zarathus	irq?
2016-09-23 08:19:26	holstein	right..
2016-09-23 08:19:43	holstein	you can have *hardware* issues.. that are making you have xruns.. irq's are a way to check for that..

2016-09-23 08:27:24	ChaosFan	zarathus: very very basic explanation: IRQs are interrupts - signals hardware can send to he OS that "something needs to be handled". it's how hard drives tell the os they finished moving to a requested read/write position, network interfaces tell they have received data ready to read, keyboards/mice tell they "were used", that sort of thing

2016-09-23 08:28:52	holstein	^ that should list

2016-09-23 08:29:10	holstein	right
2016-09-23 08:29:29	holstein	so, consider, simply downloading AVlinux, and you can do all this testing, in a live environment, created for audio production
2016-09-23 08:29:37	holstein	you  can apply anything you learn, to your current arch system
2016-09-23 08:29:43	holstein	or, use the command i linked
2016-09-23 08:30:05	holstein	or, *anything* that can tell you about your hardware conflicts.. to see *if* thats the problem
2016-09-23 08:31:36	zarathus	ok, thank you, holstein and leebre!
2016-09-23 08:32:02	zarathus	but its very hard for me to interpret thees things
2016-09-23 08:32:15	holstein	cool.. dont interpret anything :)
2016-09-23 08:32:18	holstein	just check, and test..
2016-09-23 08:32:24	holstein	you can share in a pastebin, if you like..
2016-09-23 08:33:08	zarathus	dont know about pastebin
2016-09-23 08:33:55	ChaosFan	it's a sort of website where you can just copy and paste text for sharing larger amounts of text with others, like source code snippets or logfiles or console command outputs
2016-09-23 08:34:18	ChaosFan	stuff that is "too much" to paste into a chat, or that you don't want to "scroll away" when talking about it

2016-09-23 08:34:27	zarathus	ok,
2016-09-23 08:35:02	holstein	think about it this way.. RMX *can*, and is able to *fully* support you, and arch and linux.. its *all* open.. since, they dont.. its all up to you to support it
2016-09-23 08:35:07	zarathus	i know, ... its new to me to ask for help in irc.
2016-09-23 08:35:14	holstein	ask, then
2016-09-23 08:35:22	holstein	"i dont know about things".. is a statement..
2016-09-23 08:35:47	holstein	"hey, whats that tool you speak of? and how can i use it?, i have tried this, and this happened".. thats something to discuss..

It took me quite some counting eights to find out where the ties really should be, and how long are rests, lol.
2016-09-23 09:03:49	holstein	yeah.. thats how you do it :)
2016-09-23 09:03:56	holstein	it gets quicker, the more you do it..
2016-09-23 09:04:36	dmbaturin	Cranefly is still quite an approximation, I hope to find time to find a compromise between way too many ties and accuracy.
2016-09-23 09:05:14	dmbaturin	If anyone asks me to arrange it for a few horns, I'll just go cry myself to sleep probably.
2016-09-23 09:08:34	leebre	yesterday a serious classical trained and studied piano player asked me about linux, ubuntu studio,jack and what would be the best for notation, i gave my number to  what appeared to me as her boyfriend...i had to lookin her eyes, but it was hard....i probably said many things about linux that are very untrue...

2016-09-23 09:09:41	leebre	iam trying, butits allways quite complicated....who wants to take sheet music, re- arrange it and print out the score later....who does suchthings ???
2016-09-23 09:10:15	leebre	except this woman....ay....i drank to less and talked too much, argh...
2016-09-23 09:10:24	dmbaturin	What's wrong with re-arranging?
2016-09-23 09:10:51	leebre	its probably right, yes
2016-09-23 09:11:07	leebre	wheni am - re arranging, i am doinit  without score...
2016-09-23 09:11:08	dmbaturin	Sometimes the arrange just needs improvement, sometimes you need to change instrumentation etc.
2016-09-23 09:11:23	leebre	this way, i am assuring i am understadning a very lil what is going onmuscially
2016-09-23 09:11:41	leebre	yeah, she talked about instrumentations
2016-09-23 09:12:13	dmbaturin	Well, a lot of things are just easier with a score. You can do certain things by copying and pasting once you have one chorus, or you can see what each instrument is going and where is it in the chord.
2016-09-23 09:12:42	dmbaturin	It's also easier to look a few bars back than to rewind and listen.
2016-09-23 09:13:06	leebre	sometimes you have to change score pages to look back...but yes...makes sense
2016-09-23 09:13:25	leebre	nah, probably i will never hear from them..better
2016-09-23 09:14:16	dmbaturin	And don't forget, working with a multi-part score makes you look smart. ;)
2016-09-23 09:15:36	leebre	she was strange, i guess she doesnt wantedto be smart, shestarted talkin to me after i made my points...i asked if she studied piano, she said no, she went to a conservatorium, which is quite the same, i would answer with yes if i would have studied on a conservatorium

2016-09-23 10:11:50	leebre	thanks alot, means alot to me ;)
2016-09-23 10:12:10	dmbaturin	Anyway, eating elemental magnesium will work, even if it's not the sanest way to get some magnesium.
2016-09-23 10:12:13	leebre	beside that,  you need to drink water to clinse your liver andkidneys
2016-09-23 10:12:54	leebre	so, drinking water that is naturally saturized with magnesium is a good idea, i think, really
2016-09-23 10:13:41	leebre	but sure, you cantake it in another form, as it is distributed to you
2016-09-23 10:14:09	leebre	too much calcium is not good for men, but essential for women
2016-09-23 10:15:00	leebre	contrapunctus you should really read about B12 ...this is really crazy, most important, seems to be micro organisms, B12...eat an organic produced apple and dont wash it
2016-09-23 10:15:37	leebre	do you know how and why meat has B12...wheni would tell , many people would not want to eat anymore meat then hehehehe
2016-09-23 10:15:39	dmbaturin	Just don't try magnesium sulfate. It, like most other sulfates, is not absorbed into the bloodstream. Instead it, through osmotic pressure, draws water into your intestines (you can guess the effect now).
2016-09-23 10:15:59	leebre	brrrrr, sounds bad
2016-09-23 10:16:24	dmbaturin	Well, sometimes it's what you want.
2016-09-23 10:16:32	contrapunctus	leebre: ...why would I consume the B12 bacteria and a zillion other possibly-harmful ones, when I could just have are more specific and probably less harmful subset?
2016-09-23 10:17:40	leebre	because i think, the less complexity you expereince, in your food andinyour software,the better..the more complexity and refinement, the more unhealthy angerous and insecure ..i think

2016-09-23 10:18:14	dmbaturin	What's a bit funny is that humans are one of the few species that can't synthesize their own vitamin C.
2016-09-23 10:18:23	contrapunctus	leebre: no, not solaris - the other recommendation would be TempleOS
2016-09-23 10:18:37	leebre	wow, really, other animals have vitamin c in their system ?
2016-09-23 10:18:48	dmbaturin	leebre: Yep, most of them.
2016-09-23 10:19:01	dmbaturin	I don't remember what the other species are, not offhand.
2016-09-23 10:19:03	holstein	i still have a legit opensolaris install CD, somewhere..
2016-09-23 10:19:11	contrapunctus	dmbaturin: I blame oranges and limes. So addictive -> we cease making our own.

2016-09-23 10:20:06	contrapunctus	o.o
2016-09-23 10:20:09	leebre	B12 seems most important, and its inthe end microbacterias and what they left over...resource for B12 is meat
2016-09-23 10:20:14	contrapunctus	dmbaturin , holstein - what's it like?
2016-09-23 10:20:30	holstein	opensolaris?
2016-09-23 10:20:37	dmbaturin	contrapunctus: Well, it doesn't work this way. All humans are incapable of synthesizing it, whether they ever ate oranges or not.
2016-09-23 10:20:38	leebre	and when you read about that you will see, that B12 is in the part of the animals where you dont want to pet it
2016-09-23 10:20:38	holstein	unsupported ;)
2016-09-23 10:21:03	contrapunctus	dmbaturin: unfunny joke was joke ;)
2016-09-23 10:21:05	leebre	yeah, its old
2016-09-23 10:21:09	dmbaturin	contrapunctus: The system is quite nice, but package repos were, still are, and probably always will be a sour topic.
2016-09-23 10:21:14	leebre	but there is a successor of opensolaris i guess
2016-09-23 10:21:22	contrapunctus	dmbaturin: why?
2016-09-23 10:22:13	leebre	As a result of this recirculation it actually takes, on average, 20 to 30 years to become deficient after becoming a strict vegan.  That is if no vitamin B12 were consumed�which is impossible, even on a strict vegan diet, because of bacterial sources of B12 from the person�s bowel, contaminated vegetable foods, and the environment.�

2016-09-23 12:21:07	contrapunctus	[20:56:58] lmao [20:56:58]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	contrapunctus	[20:58:18] there is this paper on concurrency models that mentions that the hardware industry benefits greatly from better concurrency models NOT being accepted and taught [20:58:18]

2016-09-23 12:21:07	dmbaturin	[21:00:27] Frankly, at least cups doesn't just stop working without even writing logs, like windows printing service does. Or used to at least, thankfully I haven't had to touch it in a good while. [21:00:27]

2016-09-23 12:21:07	jubo2	[21:10:23] it could'a been like chamomille, wheat or n9o [21:10:23]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	jubo2	[21:10:40] and do we say those substances cause brain damage? [21:10:40]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	leebre	[21:11:29] kids, dont smoke wheat ! Dont sniff starch, dont push soy cream! [21:11:29]
2016-09-23 12:21:07	jubo2	[21:11:33] No, because none of those substances are a threat to cotton industry or pharmaceutical industry [21:11:33]

2016-09-24 00:33:56	dmbaturin	[09:34:44] contrapunctus: Wouldn't know about the mandolin, or the oboe? [09:34:44]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	contrapunctus	[09:35:02] particularly in these shitty times when getting together even a quintet is 'too costly' [09:35:02]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	leebre	[09:35:09] i would not need it on accordion hehehe, but okay, midi is allways a nice addon feature [09:35:09]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	contrapunctus	[09:35:15] dmbaturin: ...either. [09:35:15]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	leebre	[09:36:32] i know one madolin track inpop culture, i dontknow any accorion or bassoon tune hehehe: [09:36:32]

2016-09-24 00:33:56	leebre	[09:37:12] okay, maybe one accordion track...james last biscaya... [09:37:12]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	dmbaturin	[09:40:50] contrapunctus: Mandolin hardly has anything unique to offer, anything that guitar can't. Banjo has unique tone, perhaps that's what keeps it alive. [09:40:50]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	leebre	[09:41:20] banjo is totally cool , right, but it not hip, never heardt it in pop culture i think... [09:41:20]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	dmbaturin	[09:42:07] It's a bit odd that banjo being the original country instrument, doesn't show up in country all that often anymore. [09:42:07]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	leebre	[09:42:31] and a western guitar is nothing more then an acoustic guitar with steel strings lol [09:42:31]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	leebre	[09:43:27] steel strings are only for real musicians hehehe, you would cut your finger tips otherwise hehehe [09:43:27]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	leebre	[09:46:03] country western music is quite popular in america, and at highest levels concerning production, recordingand mastering, i think [09:46:03]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	leebre	[09:46:17] in germany andmiddle europe is totally opposite [09:46:17]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	leebre	[09:47:08] the schlager and volksmusik now all have cheapest eletronic dane mucis style drums and beats.....sounds really wierd and cheap [09:47:08]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	leebre	[09:47:15] dance.. [09:47:15]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	contrapunctus	[09:48:18] dmbaturin: I haven't heard a whole lot of mandolin, but how does a vastly shorter scale and double courses not result in any different of sound? o.o [09:48:18]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	dmbaturin	[09:49:18] contrapunctus: Oh, it's different of course. Just not too different from anything else with double courses and a hollow wooden body, as of me. [09:49:18]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	leebre	[09:49:41] but when you put a lable on it you can sell everything as hot stuff [09:49:41]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	leebre	[09:49:44] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bkj3IVIO2Os [09:49:44]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	contrapunctus	[09:50:02] Berlioz lamented the use of guitar instead of mandolin in one of Mozart's operas [09:50:02]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	dmbaturin	[09:51:43] leebre: >the schlager and volksmusik now all have cheapest eletronic dane mucis style drums and beats; But, how is it even possible? Isn't it, by its very definition, mostly acoustic? [09:51:43]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	leebre	[09:52:12] its totally crazy, i think....i really do not know hehehe [09:52:12]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	contrapunctus	[09:52:21] the girl I know from Germany absolutely detests accordions and bandoneons, by the way. [09:52:21]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	leebre	[09:54:41] i canunderstand that [09:54:41]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	dmbaturin	[09:54:57] contrapunctus: Why does she? [09:54:57]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	leebre	[09:55:02] you canforce people to love ...thats possible too [09:55:02]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	contrapunctus	[09:55:14] because she relates them to all sorts of folksy/poppy crap she's heard played on them [09:55:14]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	leebre	[09:55:23] or  just manipulate em [09:55:23]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	contrapunctus	[09:56:05] so piazzolla, or classical music played on freebass accordions, causes some dissonance within her, I guess xD [09:56:05]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	leebre	[09:56:09] i just dont liek the sound,its too rough....like harmonica a lil,only louder and rougher [09:56:09]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	contrapunctus	[09:56:20] leebre: whaaaaaaaaaat. [09:56:20]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	contrapunctus	[09:56:42] leebre: there are sooo many sounds and combinations of sounds possible on a professional model! [09:56:42]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	leebre	[09:56:45] harmonica ? [09:56:45]

2016-09-24 00:33:56	contrapunctus	[09:58:32] leebre: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1g_cIOmlyfg [09:58:32]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	leebre	[09:58:55] let me rott in peace hehehe [09:58:55]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	contrapunctus	[09:59:30] leebre: popular song on mandolin! 'The Battle of Evermore'! [09:59:30]

2016-09-24 00:33:56	leebre	[10:01:35] hey, hehehe [10:01:35]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	dmbaturin	[10:07:14] http://www.clarinetperfection.com/galleryclar/Marigaux/02.JPG This is quite an interesting idea. [10:07:14]
2016-09-24 00:33:56	dmbaturin	[10:08:37] With those rollers on a Boehm clarinet, one could play those notes with or without alternating hands, whichever way they like. [10:08:37]

2016-09-24 03:08:07	paddyez	what would you think if someone recorded a quite (not fully) overdriven guitar over a latin rythem? Does it make any sense? and after that have a heavy distorted solo guitar?
2016-09-24 03:08:17	leebre	and i think i solved the lil problem...moving ~/.config/compiz to ~/.compiz  is probably the solution
2016-09-24 03:14:00		[03:08]
2016-09-24 03:14:13	leebre	its strange the compiz software is working, its not working as supposed to, but its working, i can see the cube but i cannot rotate it....crazy, from what debug tells me, it should not work at all because it tries to load software and grabs constantly into empty space....man, operating systems are so exciting hehehe

2016-09-24 03:51:19	yann-kaelig	Hi JazzyEagle
2016-09-24 03:54:48	JazzyEagle	Sorry, not on any of the BSDs here.
2016-09-24 03:54:48		[03:54]
2016-09-24 03:55:13	yann-kaelig	what ! how is this possible ^^
2016-09-24 03:55:26	 *	JazzyEagle is on Linux, Parabola specifically.
2016-09-24 03:56:10	JazzyEagle	And if you want to have some argument about how Linux is derived from BSD, I wish to squash that debate by indicating that I have also not played with PianoTeq in years.
2016-09-24 03:56:22	JazzyEagle	And even then, it was just a demo version.
2016-09-24 03:57:12	leebre	piantoteq...i cant find it in the freebsd repository...aybe 24000 trees are too much wood to see the tree
2016-09-24 03:58:34	JazzyEagle	leebre: I believe PianoTeq is non-libre, so I think it's hard to find it in most normal repos.
2016-09-24 04:00:10	leebre	yeah, i think there are instruments, like guitar or string where it makes sense to have the ariculation coded into algorithms...but....concerning pianos, i think a simple multilayer samples does the job, perfectly...so....i wouldnt not want to try piano emulations,nor on linux, nor on freebsd...
2016-09-24 04:00:36	leebre	simulations, not emulations
2016-09-24 04:00:58	leebre	but i am talking too much, again...
2016-09-24 04:01:06	yann-kaelig	leebre, sry, but I have tested some free giga sample, pianoteq is really on the top.
2016-09-24 04:01:09	JazzyEagle	PianoTeq actually sounds really good, as I recall, however it's proprietary and costs money i don't have.  Considering Maestro & Salamander grands are both libre, I stick with those two, depending on the song.
2016-09-24 04:01:27	JazzyEagle	They're both libre and sound pretty good.
2016-09-24 04:01:36	JazzyEagle	(I don't think quite as good as PianoTeq, though)
2016-09-24 04:02:13	JackWinter	i find that pianoteq feels more like a real piano, it's like playing it makes it behave in a non linear fashion, it's like it does something more than just play back samples
2016-09-24 04:03:39	JackWinter	not that i think you'd really notice once it's recorded and mixed into a song.  then it's probably moot if you use pianoteq or some sample lib.  as long as it sounds good, it's good...;)
2016-09-24 04:03:47	leebre	but i dont want to support developpers building pianos from salamnder, poor creatures
2016-09-24 04:05:07	yann-kaelig	pianoteq standard expand the possibilities to create you own piano sound, something with a giga sample will never be possible
2016-09-24 04:05:16	leebre	i can understand that all,if you are classical trained piano player or just used to real pianos.....i amonly hammering in the chords that are overlaying the bass line, so....for me just background noise...oops

2016-09-24 04:08:00	yann-kaelig	and if not then  Iwill try on a linux distro on this netbbok
2016-09-24 04:08:01	leebre	where would youget the package for freebsd, or do you are compiling yourself?
2016-09-24 04:08:08	leebre	is there an audio repo for freebsd ?
2016-09-24 04:08:42	yann-kaelig	leebre, why do you want a package repo for a binary software
2016-09-24 04:09:17	leebre	i dont know, freebsd is not fully compatible to linux, i guess
2016-09-24 04:09:22	leebre	i will have a look now...
2016-09-24 04:09:22	yann-kaelig	I'm mean in the case of pianoteq, you can test it via the demo or the full version
2016-09-24 04:09:49	yann-kaelig	leebre, not fully right but there is a layer with a compatibility, that why I'm interested to test it

2016-09-25 00:48:36	studio-user154_	when I start jack server it says that the system has a total latency of 10.7 msec, but when I open Ardour it says that the latency is about 5.3 msec, and also in MIDI configuration in Ardour it says that the latency is about 23.2 msec... how i can understand which is the real latency? Is it the sum of Ardour latency plus the Jack latency?

2016-09-25 01:28:15	dmbaturin	extinct_potato: Compositionally, it's very repetitive and doesn't offer virtually any development. Which may be fine if it's incidental music for a video game or similar, of course.
2016-09-25 01:28:42	extinct_potato	do you have any tips on how to improve it dmbaturin ?
2016-09-25 01:29:00	dmbaturin	Instrumentation? Well, I hear a synth there. ;)
2016-09-25 01:33:08	extinct_potato	please, any tips?
2016-09-25 01:33:29	extinct_potato	i'm stil a beginner and want to develop as a musician
2016-09-25 01:33:41	dmbaturin	extinct_potato: Let's look at WTC, for example. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtmE7zQ15TU In the prelude, the same rhythmic idea is played with various pitches. Then, in the fugue part, initial theme gets a response in the dominant key, and is then played in multiple variations in both voices.
2016-09-25 01:35:57	contrapunctus	extinct_potato: listen to lots of music, make a note of what things you like, emulate them in your own music; simultaneously, train your ears ( https://www.iwasdoingallright.com/tools/ear_training/online/ ) to recognize intervals, chords, progressions...
2016-09-25 01:36:55	dmbaturin	You have a rhythmic idea which is fairly nice. Try to do the same thing to it as J.S. Bach is doing in the prelude.

2016-09-25 01:49:44	extinct_potato	so i should do harmonic variations if i understand correctly dmbaturin ?
2016-09-25 01:50:27	dmbaturin	extinct_potato: There are many types of motivic development. You can vary pitches, or vary the rhythm slightly (e.g. trade a quarter for two eights or similar).
2016-09-25 01:50:40	dmbaturin	Modulate to a different key too.
2016-09-25 01:50:58	dmbaturin	See Bach's cello suites, for example, he's doing it a lot there.
2016-09-25 01:51:45	extinct_potato	okay, thanks for a good tip. i think i need to study more music theory.

2016-09-25 01:52:02	dmbaturin	Not really applicable in electronic music, but changing articulation can make one repeated note sound interesting enough too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vhqDCy9eQ
2016-09-25 01:54:11	extinct_potato	actually it is applicable in electronic music
2016-09-25 01:54:24	extinct_potato	one can easily alter a parameter of a synth to allow articulation

2016-09-25 02:00:23	dmbaturin	There is no one type of legato or staccato that would appear everywhere, people are constantly changing the subtle details of it, it's a big part of interpretation.
2016-09-25 02:03:50	extinct_potato	well that's how electronic music works ;}
2016-09-25 02:03:51	dmbaturin	I'm not saying sequenced music should fake music played live, and perhaps it's better if it doesn't, as when it does, it sounds obviously fake.
2016-09-25 02:04:30	extinct_potato	yeah, like half of 90s music produced with computers that was not electronic music
2016-09-25 02:04:49	dmbaturin	Wasn't it?
2016-09-25 02:05:21	extinct_potato	i mean, non-electronic music

2016-09-25 02:08:02	dmbaturin	It was made with electronic instruments. If it's not the definition of electronic music, I don't know what is.
2016-09-25 02:09:44	dmbaturin	Also, I don't know if you play a non-electronic instrument, but if you don't, you have no idea what I'm talking about. Which is fine, but don't make assumptions that it's exactly like altering a few parameters and reusing them throughout.

2016-09-25 02:59:44	dmbaturin	Compose? Jazz mostly, though I have some plans to write some classical stuff. Play? Jazz and some baroque and renaissance music sometimes.

2016-09-25 03:03:24	dmbaturin	contrapunctus: Yeah, I like the idea of using the microphone itself as an instrument, it's, technically, so many possibilities. The piece itself is a bit of... the type of avent-garde music that I never get. ;)
2016-09-25 03:04:01	yann-kaelig	well, I tried pianoteq on Freebsd, the software run, but there is no way to communicated with the sound card through alsa, because freebsd emulate the /root of linux but use his own kernel

2016-09-25 03:17:07	dmbaturin	They teach it to elementary school kids, it's nothing a grown-up person can't learn in a couple of weeks (polyphonic music and sight-reading need a lot of practice of course).
2016-09-25 03:17:51	contrapunctus	dmbaturin: couple of weeks of daily learning?
2016-09-25 03:18:01	dmbaturin	contrapunctus: Yep.
2016-09-25 03:18:51	dmbaturin	I think this kind of stuff is better learnt through an initial period of intensive practice.

2016-09-25 03:20:29	contrapunctus	I guess I could see that happening. Spaced across weekly lessons it's a bit harder IMHE, but about the same.

2016-09-26 05:23:28	leebre	i am loving it
2016-09-26 05:23:48	holstein	if i did something other than basically *only* live instrument recording, i would use it

2016-09-26 05:25:54	holstein	its basically ardour, with the harrison console DSP baked in
2016-09-26 05:26:13	leebre	the plugins, nice...bakedin because you cannot use em elsewhere ?
2016-09-26 05:26:17	holstein	its basically a digital alternative to the console
2016-09-26 05:26:24	leebre	yeah, very nice
2016-09-26 05:26:45	holstein	you can route, in jack, whatever you like to the busses

2016-09-26 05:27:13	holstein	its not "opensource".. so, its not advertised, or supported to take "the plugins" where ever one likes, like that
2016-09-26 05:27:18	leebre	this is the best part of ardour, i think: the matrix
2016-09-26 05:27:24	holstein	its baked into, basically, ardrour..
2016-09-26 05:27:40	leebre	binaries that are only working inardour iguess
2016-09-26 05:27:56	holstein	not sure what you mean
2016-09-26 05:28:04	holstein	you dont install ardour, and then some addon binary
2016-09-26 05:28:18	holstein	you get the stand-alone mixbus, proprietary software..
2016-09-26 05:28:31	leebre	okaay
2016-09-26 05:28:53	holstein	anyways.. i use mixbus, or ardour, basically.. the other things, i just mess with, when i have time

2016-09-26 05:29:46	holstein	right.. the question is, why?
2016-09-26 05:29:49	leebre	and this is allways shocking because there lies my very loud bass drum kick
2016-09-26 05:29:59	holstein	or, if you wanted to move on, constructively, that would be the question
2016-09-26 05:30:07	leebre	ok, why?
2016-09-26 05:30:11	holstein	lol
2016-09-26 05:30:19	leebre	i dont want to be the opposite of constructive
2016-09-26 05:30:21	holstein	thats the question, friend.. i dont have the answer
2016-09-26 05:30:26	leebre	hehehe
2016-09-26 05:30:43	leebre	just asking somethingis only the first step of being contructive...
2016-09-26 05:30:55	holstein	right
2016-09-26 05:31:04	holstein	not assuming.. etc
2016-09-26 05:31:20	leebre	maybe I will tell bluebell, andhe maybe can communicate that if he has encoutered that, too
2016-09-26 05:31:20	holstein	is it something you are doing? is it something in your software stack that is breaking something? etc..
2016-09-26 05:31:36	leebre	i guess,its maybe, after a crash
2016-09-26 05:31:46	leebre	when the seesionis auto repaired
2016-09-26 05:32:02	holstein	right.. so, you would have to remove the guess work, and also, like you are trying to say, get someone to *confirm* it
2016-09-26 05:32:15	holstein	what crashes? and why? etc..
2016-09-26 05:32:22	leebre	gut, okay
2016-09-26 05:32:29	leebre	well i wanted to say
2016-09-26 05:32:36	dmbaturin	holstein: I haven't touched the guitar in the last few days, but I can play the entire upper register of the clarinet now (so this sacrifice paid off I guess).
2016-09-26 05:32:58	holstein	dmbaturin: cool!
2016-09-26 05:33:17	holstein	someone was asking about "the straight black horn" on the gig, last night
2016-09-26 05:34:26	dmbaturin	Asked you, or the straight black horn player?
2016-09-26 05:35:06	holstein	if the scenario is "randomly, i have a fader reset in qtractor", that can be tricky.. but, if its "i change out *most* of my system, and introduce various instabilities, and, in doing that, when i cause qtractor to crash, bad things happen.." it can be tricky to assume thats a qtractor bug..
2016-09-26 05:35:06		[05:35]
2016-09-26 05:35:21	dmbaturin	I guess being asked this about your own instrument would feel odd.
2016-09-26 05:35:35	holstein	im not saying "its your fault".. just that, for me, i have to remind myself that *i* am a variable in the equation..

2016-09-26 05:36:44	leebre	sometimes the midi fader of the first track is saved at max

2016-09-26 05:37:11	leebre	sorry
2016-09-26 05:37:13	holstein	its not just the simple case that, randomly, the first fader is reset
2016-09-26 05:37:18	holstein	you *must* account, and share *all* the data
2016-09-26 05:37:31	holstein	and, get someone to reproduce it.. if possible
2016-09-26 05:37:45	leebre	i will ask bluebell, as sppn as i will see him
2016-09-26 05:37:48	leebre	soon
2016-09-26 05:37:52	rncbc	i sense a deep problem there
2016-09-26 05:37:57	leebre	really ?
2016-09-26 05:37:58	holstein	sure.. but, you cant "ask" that question
2016-09-26 05:37:58	leebre	noo
2016-09-26 05:38:11	holstein	you have to *say* what it going on.. *what* is causing what crash of what?
2016-09-26 05:38:13	leebre	sometimes, after a crash, and after auto repair of crashed session
2016-09-26 05:38:27	leebre	the midi fader of first track is at max, you may know that allready..
2016-09-26 05:38:48	holstein	the fader thing, is likely, as i read, just a symptom of the other problem, that, you are ignoring, and sometimes, not even mentioning..
2016-09-26 05:39:47	leebre	i am phony, a pretender, a loser, that has nothing and acts like a champion....i am quite stupid, soplease, do not pushme hehehe
2016-09-26 05:40:08	leebre	yeah, mabe the crash is the problem
2016-09-26 05:40:19	leebre	that are other third party plugins
2016-09-26 05:40:21	rncbc	leebre: midi tracks faders on qtrractor are juist midi cc#7 (volume) or #10 (pan) dedicated controllers, right?
2016-09-26 05:40:22	holstein	which is fine.. its fine for you to do *all* of those things.. but, its when you ask others to volunteer their time, without sharing all the data.. that can be the issue
2016-09-26 05:40:27	leebre	yes
2016-09-26 05:40:35	leebre	i guess hehehe
2016-09-26 05:40:39	holstein	you guess?
2016-09-26 05:40:58	leebre	i really do not know, i amtrying to be constructive and honest..please ;)
2016-09-26 05:41:13	leebre	third patry plugins
2016-09-26 05:41:21	leebre	after grace period showinnag screens
2016-09-26 05:41:25	leebre	nag screens
2016-09-26 05:42:00	holstein	me? i look into what it causing the crash.. sometimes, disabling each piece, and running them, one at a time, in "race conditions"..
2016-09-26 05:42:04	leebre	leadin to a frozen qtractor session because the plugin scan stucks...that was the problem that was before in time of those volume at max problem
2016-09-26 05:42:52	holstein	could be, this is a "bug" in one of those plugins..
2016-09-26 05:43:09	leebre	it is the nag screen
2016-09-26 05:43:22	holstein	is it?
2016-09-26 05:43:38	leebre	quite sure, as a stupid person canbe sure
2016-09-26 05:43:39	rncbc	leebre: what qtractor ---version? anyway make sure you turn on dummy vst plugin scan for stopping freezes while vst plugin scan
2016-09-26 05:43:40	holstein	you can disable that plugin? with whatever "nag" you are talking about? and *not* have the problem?
2016-09-26 05:43:52	leebre	thanks rncbc
2016-09-26 05:44:12	leebre	qtractor version 0.7.8   - i guess the latest...
2016-09-26 05:44:16	holstein	anyways.. i'll let you work with rncbc on it..
2016-09-26 05:44:37	holstein	leebre: dont "guess".. *look*.. rncbc is volunteering to assist, and *all* the data is important
2016-09-26 05:44:46	 *	rncbc i reckon im repeating some keyb strokes. don't be fooled
2016-09-26 05:44:52	leebre	holstein, you are a good teacher, i am really thinking to try to think next timebefore i start chatting (here)
2016-09-26 05:45:12	holstein	its part of being constructively help-able :)
2016-09-26 05:45:51	leebre	yes,i must learn that, wherei am coming from, there is no "being constructive" there is everything okay, or you get trouble...
2016-09-26 05:46:18	rncbc	leebre: v0.7.9 is ok with dummy vst scan--i guess it should be renamed as "out-of-process vst scan" some day
2016-09-26 05:46:21	leebre	then its best, to ignore problems, otherwise youwill get more...really
2016-09-26 05:46:52	leebre	i think, its not a vst problem....those are lv2 plugins i guess,i think...wait, i will have a look now
2016-09-26 05:47:04	rncbc	leebre: sorry v0.7.8 is ok too
2016-09-26 05:47:30	leebre	good, i guess i wil lget 0.7.9 at next update
2016-09-26 05:48:25	leebre	i am in a middle of a good flow..just makin a nice track...interrupting that now, seriously...
2016-09-26 05:48:34	holstein	lol
2016-09-26 05:48:42	holstein	so, stop pining folks to help you, then ;)
2016-09-26 05:48:44	leebre	yes, vst plugins hehehe
2016-09-26 05:48:46	rncbc	leebre: the thing about "out-of-process" vst scan got incepted on v0.7.6
2016-09-26 05:49:18	leebre	overtonedsp i think was the name and discopdsp ...

2016-09-26 05:50:16	leebre	i maybe have not installed those third party demo version before..
2016-09-26 05:50:53	leebre	it could well be, thati amdoingmany things quite wrong...could be....
2016-09-26 05:51:42	leebre	i should not waste all your time, for sure...
2016-09-26 05:51:42	holstein	thats a constructive shift, from, having a qtractor bug, that you are not willing to file a report on ;)

2016-09-26 05:55:56	leebre	to my eye, its a lil bug, because i dont see the reason to put the gainto max ontrack 1
2016-09-26 05:56:00	holstein	"it crashed".. what crashed? and how? and can you share more details with someone that can reproduce it?
2016-09-26 05:56:09	leebre	butits really annoying,because when you dontknow your speakers get blown maybe
2016-09-26 05:56:21	holstein	leebre: you are *assuming* qtractor is doing that.. what is causing the crash?
2016-09-26 05:56:43	leebre	the vst scan crashed, as rncbc mentioned allready...i will now change this vst dummy scan setting
2016-09-26 05:57:04	leebre	the third part yplugins and their nag screens

2016-09-26 06:01:29	holstein	lots of things can be tested in VM.. wont hurt to start that way
2016-09-26 06:02:11	dmbaturin	holstein: I think it's possible with a PCI firewire card and PCI passthrough in the hypervisor.
2016-09-26 06:02:44	holstein	id never be comfortable removing that from the equation, though.. if it were specific to the firewire stack.. the test
2016-09-26 06:02:50	dmbaturin	KVM can do it, I think Xen in HVM mode can do it too. VirtualBox, AFAIR, can't.
2016-09-26 06:03:01	holstein	and, for me, its much easier to just spend a few minutes replicating the hardware, on a test box..

2016-09-26 06:03:57	leebre	latency
2016-09-26 06:04:01	leebre	which is quite huge
2016-09-26 06:04:22	leebre	when you can see the latency by eye when moving themouse, you can guess, its too high to make music with
2016-09-26 06:05:02	holstein	not really
2016-09-26 06:05:03	leebre	but all hardwarethat is supported by the host should be availabe in the guest machine, if drivers are installed in guest system -I guess

2016-09-26 06:46:34	dmbaturin	holstein: What kind of stuff could you do for a bassline where there are two adjacent chords with the same root but different quality, like in Four?
2016-09-26 06:47:22	NeoFrontier	Who likes to play galaga ?
2016-09-26 06:47:30	holstein	dmbaturin: just so im clear, can you point out the bar #'s? http://www.guitarcats.com/images/JazzStandardCharts/FOUR-161.jpg

2016-09-26 06:48:00	holstein	i'll still throw a coin at galaga, if i have time :)
2016-09-26 06:50:00	dmbaturin	holstein: Lol, not really. I thought it's Eb major, then Eb minor, this chart has Bb minor in between.
2016-09-26 06:50:36	holstein	well, the trick is, its in Eb, *then*, the tonic becomes the ii chord, to the new key..
2016-09-26 06:50:55	dmbaturin	Oh wait. Ok, then it's Ab major to Ab minor, so this works anyway.
2016-09-26 06:51:28	holstein	like, you may see.. | Cmaj7    |  Cmaj7  | Cmin7 | F7  | getting to Bbmaj7..
2016-09-26 06:51:36	holstein	and so on.. like in 'how high the moon'
2016-09-26 06:51:54	holstein	its actually *not* going, in this case, C maj, to Cmin
2016-09-26 06:52:23	holstein	its actually going from C to Bb.. so, the tonic, the Cmaj7, is moving to Cmin7.. but, thats the ii chord of the upcoming key..
2016-09-26 06:52:37	holstein	same idea there in "four"..
2016-09-26 06:53:17	dmbaturin	Yeah, it's connecting Cmaj7 to Cmin7 in the bassline I have a problem with. Anything I do sounds quite unnatural.
2016-09-26 06:53:41	holstein	well, dont overthink it, in the beginning stages of hearing it
2016-09-26 06:53:50	holstein	you can always just play the root.. til you hear that motion..
2016-09-26 06:54:23	holstein	you can also, skip, or leave out the ii chord, completely.. as far as the bass line is concerned
2016-09-26 06:54:37	holstein	walking the V chord through the entire thing..
2016-09-26 06:55:42	dmbaturin	The V of the original key, then V of the new key?
2016-09-26 06:56:39	holstein	anywhere, really, where you are having issues hearing, or having time to play the ii chord
2016-09-26 06:57:02	dmbaturin	Interestingly, not long ago my friend "accused" me of the bassline of Indirect Kiss not matching the melody well, which was puzzling because it's almost entirely chord tones.
2016-09-26 06:57:29	holstein	well, its not that easy
2016-09-26 06:57:34	holstein	it would be nice, if it were
2016-09-26 06:57:45	holstein	then, we could just program a computer to do the work for us
2016-09-26 06:57:54	holstein	but, theres more to it, than just selecting the "right" notes..
2016-09-26 06:58:22	holstein	and, you really just have to keep doing it, and getting feedback,
2016-09-26 06:58:37	holstein	if you were doing this job, say, 20 hours a week, with live musicians, you would work most of this out
2016-09-26 06:59:14	holstein	you would get *lots* of different feedback, per soloist you are walking for, as to, what they would prefer, or what is "right"..

2016-09-26 07:01:25	dmbaturin	In part it was puzzling because I don't remember you pointing it out, and you are usually the first to point out harmonic issues. :)
2016-09-26 07:02:14	holstein	yeah.. who knows.. i also dont think of it as a stand alone composition, like that
2016-09-26 07:02:42	holstein	its more conversational.. it would be like talking to someone, and they say "hmmm.. " or "uh.. what was that thing called?"
2016-09-26 07:03:28	holstein	you dont point them out as a poor communicator.. its conversational.. thats more what you are making. which is why i try and encourage you to keep moving, and make more, rather than, spend too long making small "perfect" representative takes of a chorus or 2

2016-09-26 07:04:07	holstein	you would, ideally, be using these as vehicles.. like a topic for a conversation to be had, live.. that would involve folks conversing about it.. having "wrong" notes, or, whatever..
2016-09-26 07:05:11	holstein	its not the same as, going on the studio, and spending days and days getting a smaller chunk of music sounding perfect.. thats more like a play, or, a movie.. where, you are able to basically, prepare a perfectly envisioned scenario.. theres nothing wrong with that. its just, not the same as having a conversation
2016-09-26 07:06:39	holstein	if you want to have an un-scripted, realtime conversation, with a person, that looks like a person working out a lot of the processes of that communication, in realtime.. maybe saying the wrong words, and repeating a sentence, or whatever
2016-09-26 07:06:52	holstein	we dont get to be "professional speakers" and just *never* communicate a mistake, there
2016-09-26 07:07:12	holstein	news reporters, you'll see, make these errors all the time, and deal with them, quickly..
2016-09-26 07:07:49	holstein	its the same idea with improvisation.. you need not try and get "perfect" at it, and to stop making mistakes.. you just work with that, conversationally, and make sure you are saying something you want to be saying
2016-09-26 07:08:51	dmbaturin	Though I noticed that a prominent (or just clearly audible) bassline comes as a bit of surprise to many listeners.
2016-09-26 07:09:15	holstein	theres no accounting for taste, for sure
2016-09-26 07:09:27	holstein	but, the "bassline" in the music we are talking about, really is more for the soloist..
2016-09-26 07:09:49	holstein	its more about facilitating, and supporting what they are doing.. and making a nice groove for the foundational elements..

2016-09-26 07:11:13	holstein	sure.. but, its like any other conversation
2016-09-26 07:11:31	holstein	we dont really think about the words we are saying, or, how to be supportive, in conversation.. its always a bit like "faking it"..

It's already happening.
2016-09-26 10:29:41	contrapunctus	I guess privacy is also important - anyone could send anything without being anonymous, if the content can only be accessed by the people it is meant for...but that doesn't work for 'broadcasting' style uses, e.g. like a YouTube-alternative
2016-09-26 10:29:50	dmbaturin	Some particularly evil governments even experiment with mandatory HTTPS MitM.
2016-09-26 10:29:54	holstein	we just buy what we prefer, and support the model we want, and the market changes

2016-09-26 10:31:52	contrapunctus	dmbaturin: Then there's no way, basically. Governments aren't going to get sensible overnight, or ever. Humans are imperfect and unreliable, programs are better (although only by a bit).
2016-09-26 10:32:41	dmbaturin	Well, I'm not saying they are going to get sensible overnight. I'm saying that improving technical means of anonymity without improving the legal framework for it is likely to only make things worse.

2016-09-26 10:33:38	holstein	it happens, when the market changes
2016-09-26 10:33:41	JazzyEagle	the solution is most likely different for every country.
2016-09-26 10:34:05	holstein	15 years ago, we would have had a challenging time thinking of who would compete with microsoft.. now, they are not even really in the market anymore

2016-09-26 10:35:11	contrapunctus	JazzyEagle , dmbaturin - another issue is, I require a freaking solution /now/. All sorts of damage to the cultural output of the world is happening even as we speak, and even worse is the mindset all the ignorant discussion over copyright and "IP" propagates.

2016-09-26 10:39:39	holstein	right... so, change that, if its bothering you
2016-09-26 10:40:03	holstein	the issue is, you are finding *that* piece. you follow the rules for that piece, or, move on to one that has what you want/need
2016-09-26 10:40:31	contrapunctus	JazzyEagle, dmbaturin - I have a video of Piazzolla's performance, which disappeared off YouTube. A legendary composer playing his own works, and it's lost to the world. I upload it and get spewed with garbage about copyright strikes and 'piracy'.
2016-09-26 10:41:15	dmbaturin	contrapunctus: By personal approach is to educate people about those issues, and produce libre works. Though my non-software works suck so far, and sometimes I wonder if I'm only contributing to its image as an inferior alternative, lol.

2016-09-26 10:58:52	JazzyEagle	Are GMO vegetables harmful to us?  Is global warming real, and is it a threat to life as we know it?  I bet you could poll 100 different scientists, even scientisits specializing in those issues, and you could get at minimum two different results.
2016-09-26 10:58:52		[10:58]
2016-09-26 10:59:34	JazzyEagle	Scientists are paid to perform their research, and not all of those who pay the scientists are looking for the truth, rather are looking for the answer that advances their own cause(s).
2016-09-26 11:00:16	JazzyEagle	The tests that are performed and the interpretation of the data points they uncover are typically bent and over-analyzed to get the desired end-result.
2016-09-26 11:02:07	contrapunctus	No, very much yes.
2016-09-26 11:04:02	JazzyEagle	Those are your opinions/beliefs, based on what you've read and analyzed.
2016-09-26 11:05:20	contrapunctus	turns out it's possible to doubt basically everything.
2016-09-26 11:05:36	contrapunctus	justifiably or otherwise.
2016-09-26 11:07:14	JazzyEagle	Yep.
2016-09-26 11:09:25	JazzyEagle	So the long and short of it is that we all have our own opinions and beliefs, and if you analyze something enough, you can find flaws in any/all of it, so you have two options:  Accept everyone regardless of their beliefs OR mock everyone else and end up being alone (except possibly for a few that believe what you do...  Until you find soemthing they don't, because let's face it...  everyone's

2016-09-26 11:16:42	JazzyEagle	No, my point wasn't that we are not making progress.  My point was that the data is in many ways skewed, and the the interpretation of data these days is typically in the eye of the interpreter.

2016-09-26 21:42:11	dmbaturin	[20:41:14] contrapunctus: By personal approach is to educate people about those issues, and produce libre works. Though my non-software works suck so far, and sometimes I wonder if I'm only contributing to its image as an inferior alternative, lol. [20:41:14]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[20:41:22] contrapunctus: Well, you *are* uploading someone else's work...  Even though so many people do do that, you're not supposed to. [20:41:22]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	dmbaturin	[20:41:44] Somewhat alleviated by the fact that I don't promote it. [20:41:44]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	contrapunctus	[20:42:11] JazzyEagle: I really don't see why I need to follow their broken business models or irrational understanding of "property" [20:42:11]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[20:42:33] Because...  it's their site? [20:42:33]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	contrapunctus	[20:42:35] it's like, gay sex is outlawed in India, but damn if any sane person should take that law seriously. [20:42:35]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	contrapunctus	[20:43:02] JazzyEagle: if it were just that site it'd be okay. if I host my own I'll have the same problem, sooner or later. [20:43:02]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[20:43:23] Not if you don't provide contact info on the site...  ;) [20:43:23]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	contrapunctus	[20:43:28] lmao [20:43:28]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[20:43:42] No comments section, no e-mail, no feedback! [20:43:42]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[20:43:50] Kind of like...  No shoes, no shirt, no service!  ;) [20:43:50]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	contrapunctus	[20:44:38] dmbaturin: our options seem quite limited - there's activism, content creation, and the technological approach. That's about it, and all three seem quite futile. [20:44:38]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[20:45:46] None are futile if we're ready to put in a substantial amount of time into marketing as well. [20:45:46]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[20:46:31] You ask a common person on the street about what is at archive.org, they probably would some sort of document repository of really old documents. [20:46:31]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[20:46:39] would assume, sorry. [20:46:39]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	contrapunctus	[20:47:47] JazzyEagle: I'm reminded of the snowdrift.coop example of being a vegan among animal-eaters. Fits the situation to a T. [20:47:47]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[20:48:05] lol [20:48:05]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[20:48:20] Just so long as you don't tell the meat eaters how horribly bad they are... [20:48:20]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[20:48:39] And don't accost the vegetarians for using chicken broth... [20:48:39]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	contrapunctus	[20:48:47] JazzyEagle: wut. [20:48:47]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[20:48:57] Actually, I think milk would be a better example than chicken broth. [20:48:57]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	contrapunctus	[20:48:59] (what kind of a vegetarian uses chicken broth dafuq) [20:48:59]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[20:49:11] Sorry, was the first thing came to my mind. [20:49:11]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	contrapunctus	[20:49:48] JazzyEagle: anyway, I do always hear this from people, and think - "if someone's doing something bad, what do I do, tell them they're doing good?" xD [20:49:48]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[20:51:40] contrapunctus: Realize that what you feel is good/bad may not match their view on what is good/bad. [20:51:40]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	contrapunctus	[20:51:55] JazzyEagle: some things are objectively good/bad, some not. [20:51:55]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[20:51:57] We need to respect those with different beliefs/ideologies/ethics. [20:51:57]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	contrapunctus	[20:53:04] e.g. homeopathic medicine is proven to be ineffective. No "opinion" I'm gonna respect there. [20:53:04]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[20:54:16] Well, don't get me started on the whole interpretation of scientific data... [20:54:16]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	contrapunctus	[20:55:11] o.O [20:55:11]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	contrapunctus	[20:55:21] JazzyEagle: pray tell [20:55:21]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[20:58:51] Are GMO vegetables harmful to us?  Is global warming real, and is it a threat to life as we know it?  I bet you could poll 100 different scientists, even scientisits specializing in those issues, and you could get at minimum two different results. [20:58:51]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[20:59:33] Scientists are paid to perform their research, and not all of those who pay the scientists are looking for the truth, rather are looking for the answer that advances their own cause(s). [20:59:33]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[21:00:15] The tests that are performed and the interpretation of the data points they uncover are typically bent and over-analyzed to get the desired end-result. [21:00:15]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	contrapunctus	[21:02:07] No, very much yes. [21:02:07]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[21:04:01] Those are your opinions/beliefs, based on what you've read and analyzed. [21:04:01]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	contrapunctus	[21:05:19] turns out it's possible to doubt basically everything. [21:05:19]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	contrapunctus	[21:05:35] justifiably or otherwise. [21:05:35]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[21:07:13] Yep. [21:07:13]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[21:09:24] So the long and short of it is that we all have our own opinions and beliefs, and if you analyze something enough, you can find flaws in any/all of it, so you have two options:  Accept everyone regardless of their beliefs OR mock everyone else and end up being alone (except possibly for a few that believe what you do...  Until you find soemthing they don't, because let's face it...  everyone's [21:09:24]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[21:09:26] unique just like everyone else) [21:09:26]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	holstein	[21:11:35] that looks like something i would type ;) [21:11:35]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	contrapunctus	[21:13:44] JazzyEagle: unfortunately, that implies that nothing can be said to be certain, which is patently false. objective facts and demonstrability is how we got to medicines, automobiles, airplanes, ... [21:13:44]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[21:15:21] Well, yeah, back when folks were searching for the truth and not for the answer that benefits them. [21:15:21]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	holstein	[21:15:43] HA!.. yup.. [21:15:43]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[21:15:45] But even today, you hear stories of unsafe drugs because of bad data. [21:15:45]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	contrapunctus	[21:15:50] so all scientific progress stopped 'back then' [21:15:50]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	holstein	[21:16:01] progress can never stop [21:16:01]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	holstein	[21:16:08] its the commentary about it, being factual, or not.. [21:16:08]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	JazzyEagle	[21:16:41] No, my point wasn't that we are not making progress.  My point was that the data is in many ways skewed, and the the interpretation of data these days is typically in the eye of the interpreter. [21:16:41]

2016-09-27 22:59:35	bluebell	[19:38:31] rncbc: I have some crashes when opening CALF EQ's GUI [19:38:31]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	bluebell	[19:39:37] rncbc: first it happened when I open the GUI without pressing play/stop first, but now I had crashes after several times opening the GUI [19:39:37]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	leebre	[19:42:48] bluebell i had some problems with calf gui inqtractor recently, too [19:42:48]

2016-09-27 22:59:35	holstein	[19:45:15] what are you playing? [19:45:15]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	rncbc	[19:45:35] bluebell: didn't change a bit at all. things are mostly qt vs. gtk linkage, a die hard dilemma [19:45:35]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	bluebell	[19:46:52] rncbc: I have the same libs as before and even used gcc 4.8 again which I used to compile the CALF plugins [19:46:52]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	leebre	[19:46:57] holstein - i hadnothing to lose, not i have something to lose, maybe... [19:46:57]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	leebre	[19:47:07] now,i have something... [19:47:07]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	bluebell	[19:47:10] rncbc: but if you didn't change something then it might be a race condition in the libs [19:47:10]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	holstein	[19:47:19] yeah? [19:47:19]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	leebre	[19:47:26] every mistake is vital now [19:47:26]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	holstein	[19:47:33] maybe, we just look at things *very* differently [19:47:33]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	leebre	[19:47:44] not a good time for me, playing the fool [19:47:44]

2016-09-27 22:59:35	holstein	[19:56:35] i think they just have inside jokes that are stupid to us [19:56:35]

2016-09-27 22:59:35	bluebell	[19:57:03] that's basically a joke about germans who have chinese tattoos without knowing what they mean [19:57:03]

2016-09-27 22:59:35	holstein	[19:57:47] bluebell: they do it here, in the US, as well.. "tribal arm bands".. with *no* idea what the symbols mean [19:57:47]

2016-09-27 22:59:35	rncbc	[20:09:05] bluebell: well, i have no (big) issues here re. qt5 vs. gtk2 ... but i know that some calf guis do crash anyway, especially the ones that call for the gtk/gnome file-open/save browser requester dialogs. calf fluidsynth is one. is a jerky business, no doubt [20:09:05]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	bluebell	[20:17:18] rncbc: it happens with an older Qtractor as well so there was probably an update of one of the libs, I guess [20:17:18]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	bluebell	[20:17:57] rncbc: I'll have to find out if it happens only in the mixer or in the main window when opening a track's properties as well [20:17:57]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	bluebell	[20:19:10] rncbc: it seems it happens only in the mixer window with many strips [20:19:10]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	bluebell	[20:19:25] rncbc: maybe a race condition catches here [20:19:25]

2016-09-28 08:34:04	JackWinter_	i'd say too, it's a good idea to learn how the packaging system of your distro works.  much better than installing from source
2016-09-28 08:34:23	holstein	alphabet_: i dont have any idea.. kxstudio is a way of adding a somewhat rolling path to audio software to ubuntu.. the kxstudio ppa's
2016-09-28 08:34:43	holstein	we go into using ubuntu with that in mind.. that the packages dont get upgraded.. its an LTS, which, means its more of a "frozen" thing
2016-09-28 08:35:13	holstein	you can take lots of paths to trying to update packages.. the kxstudio ppa's provide *many* more packages, and may be overkill.. or not have what you are looking for
2016-09-28 08:35:40	holstein	you will have to look, and see what the ppa's provide, and see if it fits your needs.. or, just look at how you are intended to have the latest, from the developers..
2016-09-28 08:35:50	edogawa	lol whenever i post something to LAU mailinglist it seems the thread dries out ;)
2016-09-28 08:35:55	JackWinter_	but sometimes one can run the resulting binary from somewhere else.  for instance i have a ~/bin added to my path, and something like wine can be run out of the builddir, so no real reason to install.  of course, it might depend on the software in question
2016-09-28 08:36:26	alphabet_	ok, then I must add that ppa to ubuntu studio and the upgraded software will appear in "software" app of ubuntu studio 16.04.1?
2016-09-28 08:36:34	holstein	alphabet_: no
2016-09-28 08:37:07	alphabet_	i must install every single package from the terminal?
2016-09-28 08:37:12	holstein	alphabet_: thats not what i said. what i said? check the source. the kxstudio ppa's, and see if it contains what you are looking for.. research it, and see that it meets you needs. then, you can use it, or get the package, as the dev's intend
2016-09-28 08:37:37	holstein	alphabet_: in ubuntu, yes.. since, its not a rolling release, if you want "newer" packages, installing then, one at a time, is *one* way to do it
2016-09-28 08:37:42	dmbaturin	alphabet_: Until you know what the "software app" is a frontend for at least, you'd better just use what maintainers provide. ;)
2016-09-28 08:37:42	holstein	the kxstudio ppa, and other ppa's are other ways..
2016-09-28 08:40:08	alphabet_	there is a way to install packages and upgrade directly all the dependences with the command "apt-get"?
2016-09-28 08:40:35	dmbaturin	Also, by adding a PPA, you effectively lose the support of ubuntu maintainers.
2016-09-28 08:40:51	holstein	alphabet_: if a source is providing that, yes.. such as a PPA..
2016-09-28 08:41:17	holstein	alphabet_: you cant just use the official, supported ubuntu means of installing packages, and get something outside what you were promised..
2016-09-28 08:41:47	holstein	its not a rolling release, so, you are on your own, installing updated versions.. ubuntu agrees to maintain security updates on current packages.. basically.. with a few exceptions..
2016-09-28 08:42:08	holstein	me? i look into falktx` 's ppas first, since, i know him, and he's greatly helpful

2016-09-28 08:51:39	JackWinter_	sure, but in that case you can just delete the offending app and reinstall it.
2016-09-28 08:51:56	alphabet_	JackWinter: yes... i wan't automatic updates for audio software because for example guitarix and ardour have improved a lot with updates, but they are (obviously) not present in ubuntu

2016-09-28 08:52:46	JackWinter_	alphabet_: if i'm not mistaken, all kxstudio apps are linked statically, so don't really change your system very much

2016-09-28 09:14:00	holstein	am i virtualizing servers for a living? no..
2016-09-28 09:14:42	bluebell	On the desktop I like VirtualBox, on the server I virtualize with kvm
2016-09-28 09:14:43	leebre	i want a lil distraction , so i am trying some stuff..
2016-09-28 09:15:03	leebre	kvm on intel could be fast
2016-09-28 09:15:06	leebre	i guess
2016-09-28 09:15:06	dmbaturin	holstein: libvirt has support for virtualbox AFAIR. ;)
2016-09-28 09:15:08	yann-kaelig	I'm using aqemu. Certainly not the most powerfull but for my need it enough
2016-09-28 09:15:12	holstein	:)
2016-09-28 09:15:25	holstein	what i dont understand is, why are we not all just using the "best" one ;)
2016-09-28 09:15:55	bluebell	it's the same with cars
2016-09-28 09:16:02	bluebell	there is no best car for everyone
2016-09-28 09:16:02	dmbaturin	Lack of live migration is the issue when using vbox for server virtualization, but otherwise it's doable, and since it's got hardware virtualization and paravirtual IO support it's, in this regard, no worse than KVM.
2016-09-28 09:16:27	holstein	bluebell: i dont want the best. just the fastest..
2016-09-28 09:16:35	bluebell	live migration is overrated. it's hardly ever done in big datacenters
2016-09-28 09:16:52	leebre	in software we can indeed use all the best opensource option and make it strongest
2016-09-28 09:16:54	alphabet_	JackWinter: i've just seen the kxrepositories, on calf gear plug-ins it tells "[*] This is a custom version which adds back LADSPA, DSSI and LV2 external-UI support removed by upstream, see this link."... if I want to delete kxstudio ppa's, it will go back to the original not custom version?
2016-09-28 09:17:04	holstein	leebre: lol!
2016-09-28 09:17:14	bluebell	my emplyer runs 15000+ servers. I guess they live-migrated a couple of times
2016-09-28 09:17:24	leebre	i have fever, please ignore me today
2016-09-28 09:17:43	dmbaturin	bluebell: When whatever you run is stateful, it's impossible to live without live migration.
2016-09-28 09:17:45	holstein	leebre: we will not all support the best.. just the fastest..
2016-09-28 09:18:14	bluebell	dmbaturin: why should one live-migrate in normal operations?
2016-09-28 09:18:31	dmbaturin	bluebell: Upgrading or replacing hosts.
2016-09-28 09:18:52	leebre	we can make three groups:
2016-09-28 09:18:59	bluebell	dmbaturin: if you run real world systems you need maintenance windows
2016-09-28 09:19:06	holstein	leebre: small medium, and large?
2016-09-28 09:19:07	leebre	best for desktop, for server and for speed
2016-09-28 09:19:16	holstein	anyways.. "best" is *always* relative..
2016-09-28 09:19:25	alphabet_	UP: i've just seen the kxrepositories, on calf gear plug-ins it tells "[*] This is a custom version which adds back LADSPA, DSSI and LV2 external-UI support removed by upstream, see this link."... if I want to delete kxstudio ppa's, it will go back to the original not custom version?
2016-09-28 09:19:25	bluebell	dmbaturin: so the days with uptimes of years are over
2016-09-28 09:19:27	holstein	thats why we have so many options :)
2016-09-28 09:19:40	dmbaturin	bluebell: Tell me about it, I'm in telecom. ;)
2016-09-28 09:20:09	holstein	alphabet_: try it, and see.. they are "stand alone" AFAIK.. when you install the ppa's you agree that they can break your system
2016-09-28 09:20:19	bluebell	dmbaturin: me too, I run an asterisk at home \o/
2016-09-28 09:20:23	holstein	i dont think you have, but, this is all "use at your own risk"..
2016-09-28 09:21:39	alphabet_	ok, if it breaks my system i'll re-install ubuntu studio... eheh
2016-09-28 09:22:58	alphabet_	thanks a lot, i gotta go, bye!
2016-09-28 09:23:04	dmbaturin	bluebell: Also, we run _routers_ (and firewalls) virtualized. It's a huge advantage there, you can migrate it and work on anything you want without even inducing VRRP failover, which is not exactly seemless.

2016-09-28 09:25:27	dmbaturin	Ideally, I'd like to see systems so granular that they don't need maintenance windows at all.
2016-09-28 09:26:04	bluebell	dmbaturin: load a 2nd packet filtering engine, switch to it and unload the 1st packet filtering engine :)
2016-09-28 09:26:22	bluebell	or routing engine ...

2016-09-28 09:27:24	dmbaturin	For web and the like, application level switchover on the balancers work well, but it doesn't work as well for every use case, and other mechanisms help here, like migration.
2016-09-28 09:29:35	dmbaturin	bluebell: Well, yes, one can get a big box with redundant supervisor cards and all, and have all traffic pass through it, with lots of VRFs. Or one can make routers themselves more granular (ours is open source, by the way, as a bonus ;).
2016-09-28 09:29:36		[09:29]
2016-09-28 09:30:38	dmbaturin	Sometimes you can't avoid a big box of course, when you need an L3 switch on steroids.
2016-09-28 09:31:46	holstein	i tried my best for a "read the documentation *before* breaking your system" message..
2016-09-28 09:31:48	holstein	oh well..
2016-09-28 09:32:12	dmbaturin	But if you read the docs, you may never break your system.
2016-09-28 09:32:28	holstein	yeah.. its part of the learning process.. :)

2016-09-28 09:55:22	leebre	The Xen hypervisor is a thin layer of software which emulates a computer architecture.....that sounds thin, but thin is probably quite relative here hehehe
2016-09-28 09:56:28	leebre	i guess i will read about xen a lil
2016-09-28 09:57:04	dmbaturin	leebre: Note that Xen has two distinct modes, PV and HVM. Parvarirtual mode requires modified kernels "ported" to the "Xen architecture", and this is indeed quite thin on the guest part.
2016-09-28 09:57:38	leebre	aaah
2016-09-28 09:57:44	leebre	special kernel
2016-09-28 10:01:42	dmbaturin	It comes at cost of course, apart from special kernel, you need a special way to boot it. This means you can't just connect an ISO image to a VM, start it and install the normal way, the usual way is to convert disk images with OSes installed another way (e.g. Xen HVM) to PV images.
2016-09-28 10:01:42		[10:01]
2016-09-28 10:02:13	dmbaturin	All in all, PV is an attractive-looking idea that turns out a massive headache in practice.
2016-09-28 10:03:35	dmbaturin	Paravirtual CPU that is. Paravirtual IO is seemless once drivers are installed, and on linux or BSDs support for it is right in the normal kernel.
2016-09-28 10:04:45	leebre	ok

2016-09-29 00:46:14	dmbaturin	[19:30:37] Sometimes you can't avoid a big box of course, when you need an L3 switch on steroids. [19:30:37]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	holstein	[19:31:45] i tried my best for a "read the documentation *before* breaking your system" message.. [19:31:45]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	holstein	[19:31:47] oh well.. [19:31:47]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	dmbaturin	[19:32:11] But if you read the docs, you may never break your system. [19:32:11]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	holstein	[19:32:27] yeah.. its part of the learning process.. :) [19:32:27]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	holstein	[19:32:36] anyways.. o/ [19:32:36]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	leebre	[19:55:22] The Xen hypervisor is a thin layer of software which emulates a computer architecture.....that sounds thin, but thin is probably quite relative here hehehe [19:55:22]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	leebre	[19:56:27] i guess i will read about xen a lil [19:56:27]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	dmbaturin	[19:57:03] leebre: Note that Xen has two distinct modes, PV and HVM. Parvarirtual mode requires modified kernels "ported" to the "Xen architecture", and this is indeed quite thin on the guest part. [19:57:03]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	leebre	[19:57:37] aaah [19:57:37]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	leebre	[19:57:43] special kernel [19:57:43]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	dmbaturin	[20:01:41] It comes at cost of course, apart from special kernel, you need a special way to boot it. This means you can't just connect an ISO image to a VM, start it and install the normal way, the usual way is to convert disk images with OSes installed another way (e.g. Xen HVM) to PV images. [20:01:41]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	dmbaturin	[20:02:12] All in all, PV is an attractive-looking idea that turns out a massive headache in practice. [20:02:12]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	dmbaturin	[20:03:34] Paravirtual CPU that is. Paravirtual IO is seemless once drivers are installed, and on linux or BSDs support for it is right in the normal kernel. [20:03:34]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	leebre	[20:04:44] ok [20:04:44]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	leebre	[20:06:05] mmmh [20:06:05]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	leebre	[20:06:34] this is too much then [20:06:34]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	leebre	[20:07:23] specialkernel, no..i have my principles, everything must run on linux-rt while a constan ffado jack stream at -n2 -p64 must run [20:07:23]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	contrapunctus	[20:07:51] So a laptop at my home suddenly took to freezing up at the GRUB OS selection screen; I ask ##linux what the issue might be; someone guesses "failed hard disk"; I resign myself to running a liveboot USB and running smartctl or something. [20:07:51]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	leebre	[20:08:01] so xen hvm , i can use with qemu on my linux kernel...mmm [20:08:01]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	contrapunctus	[20:08:23] Actual cause - it had a CD in the (faulty) CD drive. Took out CD -> problem fixed. [20:08:23]

This is very valuable if you are debugging a kernel as you have full insight into the machine state, and can emulate ARM or m68k on x86 too.
2016-09-29 13:57:17	leebre	i know, libvirt...qemu is cool
2016-09-29 13:57:20	leebre	but slow
2016-09-29 13:57:43	leebre	xen would be probably fastest, as you said as paravirtualised hypervisor

2016-09-29 14:05:37	leebre	hehehe
2016-09-29 14:05:59	dmbaturin	Ok, hardware virtualization actually predates PV. It's just x86 that was late to the party, IBM had it in the 70's.
2016-09-29 14:06:22	leebre	thats when you play sony3 games for example, i guess

2016-09-29 14:10:20	leebre	i was strangly suprised who well qemu works, and also how easy freebsd was to setup for the firsttime after being an arch user for maybe 5 years
2016-09-29 14:11:09	leebre	no one needed to tell me that its ls not cd ..quite logical, if its not cd, it can only by ls
2016-09-29 14:12:35	leebre	have working freebsd system, with all software, also qjackctl and linuxsampler...but havent played with that
2016-09-29 14:13:07	leebre	now its so lame that compiz is working but the cube is too slow to use
2016-09-29 14:13:31	dmbaturin	Man, do you use it for its nostalgic value or something? ;)
2016-09-29 14:13:31	leebre	or, i am still using in debug mode still...mm
2016-09-29 14:14:10	leebre	nah, but if its too slow for compiz, it will be too slow for audio/midi sequencing

2016-09-30 00:48:25	leebre	[00:07:51] i dont game [00:07:51]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	leebre	[00:08:28] but its virtualsiation, too [00:08:28]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	dmbaturin	[00:09:04] IBM should just make a desktop version of the z/Arch, and then everyone will be happy. Big red switch should be included too. [00:09:04]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	dmbaturin	[00:09:39] Without the big red switch, it's just not z/Arch as we know it. [00:09:39]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	leebre	[00:10:19] i was strangly suprised who well qemu works, and also how easy freebsd was to setup for the firsttime after being an arch user for maybe 5 years [00:10:19]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	leebre	[00:11:09] no one needed to tell me that its ls not cd ..quite logical, if its not cd, it can only by ls [00:11:09]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	leebre	[00:12:35] have working freebsd system, with all software, also qjackctl and linuxsampler...but havent played with that [00:12:35]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	leebre	[00:13:06] now its so lame that compiz is working but the cube is too slow to use [00:13:06]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	dmbaturin	[00:13:31] Man, do you use it for its nostalgic value or something? ;) [00:13:31]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	leebre	[00:13:31] or, i am still using in debug mode still...mm [00:13:31]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	leebre	[00:14:09] nah, but if its too slow for compiz, it will be too slow for audio/midi sequencing [00:14:09]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	dmbaturin	[00:14:32] Compiz uses the GPU... [00:14:32]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	dmbaturin	[00:15:21] It will be just as slow on the latest xeon, if your GPU is slow. [00:15:21]
2016-09-30 00:48:25	leebre	[00:16:40] okay, but the mouse is lagging for sure and also the key strokes to get and rotate thecube... [00:16:40]

2016-09-30 04:42:00	contrapunctus	dmbaturin: bit hesitant to do that (double women's lines in the lower octave), because I'm hoping the actors will take hints from the melodies. So they might mix up one line for another. Now that I think about it, that's mostly why I'm apprehensive about adding more lines, even though I want to.

2016-09-30 06:32:45	holstein	indeed..
2016-09-30 06:32:51	contrapunctus	I'd like my parents to use some kind of textual format instead of .doc/.docx in LibreOffice Writer.
2016-09-30 06:33:15	holstein	if you set the default, in whatever they are using, that will likely do the trick
2016-09-30 06:33:17	contrapunctus	Markdown, org, anything. (okay, NOT LaTeX, it's a frickin' design nightmare.)
2016-09-30 06:33:28	holstein	but, then, you'll be dealing with all the tech support..

2016-09-30 06:35:02	holstein	basically, just installing libreoffice, and setting the defaults to .dox, and basically, just not saying anything..
2016-09-30 06:35:21	holstein	"do we have that word thing?", and i just say as little as possible..
2016-09-30 06:35:21	contrapunctus	holstein: the problem isn't quite that - one can export MD to ODT, for instance, and AFAICT most MS Word has supported that for quite a while - the question is whether an ODT file (perhaps someone sent them a doc/docx, which can be converted to odt) can be coverted /back/ to MD...
2016-09-30 06:35:34	holstein	oh yeah. "one" can do many things
2016-09-30 06:35:56	holstein	the problem is, it *literally* cant get any easier for someone to look at an ODT..
2016-09-30 06:36:59	holstein	but, its  not going to happen.. "one" doesnt really know what we are talking about

2016-09-30 07:02:34	JazzyEagle	It's crazy.
2016-09-30 07:03:01	contrapunctus	JazzyEagle: elisp and CL are lisp-2s - functions and variables have separate namespaces, so you can have a var called foo and a function called foo as well; Scheme being lisp-1, functions and variables have the same namespace.

2016-09-30 07:05:12	contrapunctus	JazzyEagle: Lisp code /is/ whitespace based, actually. Lispers don't count parens, they read with the indentation.
2016-09-30 07:06:08	JazzyEagle	No, it isn't.  Yes, the Lisp programmers put in the whitespace to make it easier to read, but if you really wanted to, you could put an entire program into one line with no whitespace at all.
2016-09-30 07:06:21	JazzyEagle	The compiler doesn't care about whitespace.
2016-09-30 07:07:00	JazzyEagle	You try to do that with Haskell, and the compiler would raise all sorts of red flags and curse you and damn you to eternal hell...  Or something like that.

2016-09-30 07:08:18	JazzyEagle	No, but again, my point is that the compiler wouldn't care.  Point #2: Not every programmer necessarily follows to the same whitespacing rules that falls under the general consensus.

2016-09-30 07:43:03	JazzyEagle	Then there'd be radio streams of the music based on genres and ratings primarily, but people could also request songs to be played within the radio streams as well.

2016-09-30 17:40:52	brucespringsten	is there a particular audio interface you recommend
2016-09-30 17:41:37	brucespringsten	i run debian at home
2016-09-30 17:43:18	dmbaturin	brucespringsten: As long as it's USB 2.0 class compliant, you should be fine.
2016-09-30 17:45:51	brucespringsten	i think mine is firewire
2016-09-30 17:46:38	brucespringsten	i havent used it, i got it with some monitors
2016-09-30 17:46:38		[17:46]
2016-09-30 17:47:08	brucespringsten	but i don't think i see any usb ports here
2016-09-30 17:47:32	brucespringsten	:(
2016-09-30 17:50:59	brucespringsten	maybe i can try trading someone on craigslist for a USB 2.0 interface.  is USB 2.0 really fast enough for music recording?  i guess if that's what everyone here is using then it's good enough
2016-09-30 17:51:53	dmbaturin	For firewire devices, you have to check if it's supported explicitly. Some are, some are not, some may be partially supported.
2016-09-30 17:53:04	dmbaturin	brucespringsten: Well, USB 2.0 is fast enough for any practical bitrate. The real question is if latency and predictable enough for live monitoring, and in practice it usually is.

2016-09-30 17:55:20	brucespringsten	well if i really need to get crazy i'm sure i'd just travel to my friend's studio where he uses logic
2016-09-30 17:55:51	brucespringsten	i'm sure you're right and that USB 2.0 is adequate, and i'd like to have a setup like that at home
2016-09-30 18:00:58	brucespringsten	thanks for the info
2016-09-30 18:01:27	dmbaturin	brucespringsten: Well, it's only relevant if you want to monitor through the DAW anyway. Most sound interfaces provide monitor output themselves which is not affected by USB latency anyway.
2016-09-30 18:02:18	dmbaturin	If you use software effects, this won't help of course.
2016-09-30 18:02:18		[18:02]
2016-09-30 18:02:22	brucespringsten	this one looks like it does, but im thinking about mixing.  dont have a board so will have to use software
2016-09-30 18:02:42	brucespringsten	i am most interested in analog effects and recording methods

2016-09-30 18:16:00		[18:10]
2016-09-30 18:20:51	brucespringsten	where do you usually look to see if hardware is supported
2016-09-30 18:22:49	dmbaturin	brucespringsten: http://wiki.linuxaudio.org/faq/start#qis_my_hardwaresoundcard_supported_in_the_linux_os Here's a bunch of handy links to HCLs.
2016-09-30 18:24:35	brucespringsten	ahhh, looks like mine is reported to work...
2016-09-30 18:24:54	brucespringsten	thanks, the ffado site had my model listed
2016-09-30 18:30:00		[18:24]
2016-09-30 18:30:40	brucespringsten	im not thrilled about the idea of using my current interface though because i have usb 3.0 ports and don't want to go through the hassle of finding a firewire pcie card
2016-09-30 18:30:52	brucespringsten	might be worth it though...

2016-10-01 14:06:34	dmbaturin	[04:02:18] If you use software effects, this won't help of course. [04:02:18]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	brucespringsten	[04:02:22] this one looks like it does, but im thinking about mixing.  dont have a board so will have to use software [04:02:22]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	brucespringsten	[04:02:41] i am most interested in analog effects and recording methods [04:02:41]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	brucespringsten	[04:10:13] what i probably mean is monitoring though [04:10:13]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	brucespringsten	[04:20:51] where do you usually look to see if hardware is supported [04:20:51]

2016-10-01 14:06:34	brucespringsten	[04:24:54] thanks, the ffado site had my model listed [04:24:54]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	brucespringsten	[04:30:40] im not thrilled about the idea of using my current interface though because i have usb 3.0 ports and don't want to go through the hassle of finding a firewire pcie card [04:30:40]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	brucespringsten	[04:30:51] might be worth it though... [04:30:51]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	dmbaturin	[04:37:33] brucespringsten: Yeah, 1394 is increasingly rare. I'm not sure if any of the vendors still make new soundcard models with it actually. [04:37:33]

2016-10-01 14:06:34	yann-kaelig	[13:51:53] anyway with three available activation that enough for my three computers, that was just my hacker curiosity ^^ [13:51:53]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	yann-kaelig	[13:59:26] well, I got my samsung netbook NC110, OS installation is done, a little more optimization and I will test pianoteq on this machine :) [13:59:26]

2016-10-01 14:06:34	rghvdberg	[19:34:07] totally depends on the synth [19:34:07]

2016-10-03 04:53:21	brucespringsten	[04:30:40] im not thrilled about the idea of using my current interface though because i have usb 3.0 ports and don't want to go through the hassle of finding a firewire pcie card [04:30:40]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	brucespringsten	[04:30:51] might be worth it though... [04:30:51]

2016-10-03 04:53:21	yann-kaelig	[13:59:26] well, I got my samsung netbook NC110, OS installation is done, a little more optimization and I will test pianoteq on this machine :) [13:59:26]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	rghvdberg	[18:12:06] no song for OSC #91 .. and Tyrell N6 is such a wonderful synth :-( [18:12:06]

2016-10-03 04:53:21	holstein	[18:16:17] really shouldnt be any "crashy" elements.. [18:16:17]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	rghvdberg	[18:21:25] no, it's weird. chromium works fine [18:21:25]

2016-10-03 04:53:21	dmbaturin	[18:58:12] rghvdberg: Why don't you write a song for it then? [18:58:12]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	rghvdberg	[19:00:02] time's up ;-0 [19:00:02]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	dmbaturin	[19:00:49] Ah, I see. [19:00:49]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	rghvdberg	[19:00:51] you have to finish the song in one month, but couldn't find enough time this month [19:00:51]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	rghvdberg	[19:00:55] no biggie [19:00:55]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	rghvdberg	[19:01:58] I was at 1/3 of completing the song but I thought there was no use in submitting a half finished product. [19:01:58]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	rghvdberg	[19:02:23] had some nice things going [19:02:23]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	rghvdberg	[19:11:57] http://picosong.com/TMD6/ [19:11:57]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	dmbaturin	[19:33:10] rghvdberg: Sounds like a fun start. How easy is it to feed it to a different synth next month? [19:33:10]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	rghvdberg	[19:34:07] totally depends on the synth [19:34:07]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	rghvdberg	[19:34:46] heard some other submissions ... need a lot to learn ... [19:34:46]

2016-10-03 04:53:21	contrapunctus	[21:13:31] on the other hand - TIL about the 'tune' pitch opcode in SFZ files [21:13:31]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	contrapunctus	[21:15:27] I had a whole load of solo violin, viola, cello, and contrabass samples which were weirdly out of tune...and instead of retuning each file individually with audacity as I was trying, I can now just enter the fine tuning amount (in cents) in the SFZ file itself. [21:15:27]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	contrapunctus	[21:16:23] way quicker, no conversion/loss of quality, way easier to make/share the changes... [21:16:23]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	dmbaturin	[21:17:49] contrapunctus: Why can samples be out of tune? Aren't they, well, samples that are made to match the required pitch every time? [21:17:49]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	contrapunctus	[21:18:11] dmbaturin: inorite? but they are :\ [21:18:11]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	bluebell	[21:18:49] dmbaturin: if you record an instrument that's a bit out of tune then you have to re-tune the samples. [21:18:49]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	contrapunctus	[21:18:51] and each by different amounts, so it can't be that they're A=$not440hertz [21:18:51]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	bluebell	[21:19:46] dmbaturin: formats like sf2 and sfz can store the detune information so you don't have to process the wav files [21:19:46]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	contrapunctus	[21:24:11] dmbaturin: I composed a lot more in that score I uploaded yesterday...but I think I'll just pass out before I manage to get the browser open and zip the dir again [21:24:11]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	dmbaturin	[21:53:41] contrapunctus: You know my email? [21:53:41]

2016-10-03 05:19:36	rghvdberg	[18:12:06] no song for OSC #91 .. and Tyrell N6 is such a wonderful synth :-( [18:12:06]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	rghvdberg	[18:15:25] linuxmusicians.com crashes my firefox ... wtf [18:15:25]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	holstein	[18:16:07] its loading here, OK.. under chrome [18:16:07]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	holstein	[18:16:17] really shouldnt be any "crashy" elements.. [18:16:17]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	rghvdberg	[18:21:25] no, it's weird. chromium works fine [18:21:25]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	rghvdberg	[18:22:14] ah, there's a firefox update waiting ;-) [18:22:14]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	dmbaturin	[18:58:12] rghvdberg: Why don't you write a song for it then? [18:58:12]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	rghvdberg	[19:00:02] time's up ;-0 [19:00:02]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	dmbaturin	[19:00:49] Ah, I see. [19:00:49]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	rghvdberg	[19:00:51] you have to finish the song in one month, but couldn't find enough time this month [19:00:51]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	rghvdberg	[19:00:55] no biggie [19:00:55]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	rghvdberg	[19:01:58] I was at 1/3 of completing the song but I thought there was no use in submitting a half finished product. [19:01:58]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	rghvdberg	[19:02:23] had some nice things going [19:02:23]

2016-10-03 05:19:36	dmbaturin	[19:33:10] rghvdberg: Sounds like a fun start. How easy is it to feed it to a different synth next month? [19:33:10]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	rghvdberg	[19:34:07] totally depends on the synth [19:34:07]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	rghvdberg	[19:34:46] heard some other submissions ... need a lot to learn ... [19:34:46]

2016-10-03 05:19:36	 *	contrapunctus [21:12:54] is super exhausted from today's (two) shows [21:12:54]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	contrapunctus	[21:13:31] on the other hand - TIL about the 'tune' pitch opcode in SFZ files [21:13:31]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	contrapunctus	[21:15:27] I had a whole load of solo violin, viola, cello, and contrabass samples which were weirdly out of tune...and instead of retuning each file individually with audacity as I was trying, I can now just enter the fine tuning amount (in cents) in the SFZ file itself. [21:15:27]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	contrapunctus	[21:16:23] way quicker, no conversion/loss of quality, way easier to make/share the changes... [21:16:23]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	dmbaturin	[21:17:49] contrapunctus: Why can samples be out of tune? Aren't they, well, samples that are made to match the required pitch every time? [21:17:49]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	contrapunctus	[21:18:11] dmbaturin: inorite? but they are :\ [21:18:11]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	bluebell	[21:18:49] dmbaturin: if you record an instrument that's a bit out of tune then you have to re-tune the samples. [21:18:49]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	contrapunctus	[21:18:51] and each by different amounts, so it can't be that they're A=$not440hertz [21:18:51]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	bluebell	[21:19:46] dmbaturin: formats like sf2 and sfz can store the detune information so you don't have to process the wav files [21:19:46]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	contrapunctus	[21:24:11] dmbaturin: I composed a lot more in that score I uploaded yesterday...but I think I'll just pass out before I manage to get the browser open and zip the dir again [21:24:11]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	dmbaturin	[21:53:41] contrapunctus: You know my email? [21:53:41]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	contrapunctus	[00:01:07] Qtractor bug? If I set mixer levels on MIDI tracks, save the session, close it and open it again later, in the next session the levels sound like they changed (i.e. to something other than how I set them) even though the mixer shows them as I left them, and won't take effect unless I touch each level a little bit.

2016-10-04 00:58:59	Tumulte	hi
2016-10-04 01:00:16	leebre	I guess, for endusers like us osm's there is more feelable progress going on at the rt patch then on the mainline kernel, I could feel progress on the last 4 rt patch updates on the same kernel 4.6.7...they jumped 4.7 (rt patch developers)
2016-10-04 01:00:31	leebre	now at 4.8
2016-10-04 01:00:48	Tumulte	yet another jack problem : It starts with my fw410 but make no sound whatsoever

2016-10-04 01:05:58	leebre	never experienced something more stable then jack, stable and quite easy to use, i am still having problems with alsa as it seems hehehe, but jack and firewire...should be rockstable

2016-10-04 01:07:29	leebre	have

2016-10-04 01:11:02	Tumulte	no it's not
2016-10-04 01:11:22	leebre	it is
2016-10-04 01:11:34	leebre	it surely is
2016-10-04 01:11:38	Tumulte	well it basically never ever works
2016-10-04 01:11:48	leebre	it allways works
2016-10-04 01:12:38	Tumulte	well not here
2016-10-04 01:12:46	leebre	i am so happy with it, but yes, i know the feeling, had times when things were not running as I would like too
2016-10-04 01:13:22	Tumulte	and in 10 years, I'm not so certain I've spent more days actually making music rather than trying to fix things
2016-10-04 01:14:19	Tumulte	and when it works it's OK at most. The competition is lightyears ahead anything that runs on linux
2016-10-04 01:14:40	Tumulte	except for the occasionnal proprietary stuff
2016-10-04 01:14:55	leebre	I would totally disagree

2016-10-04 01:19:32	leebre	linuxsampler, million times more stable then kontakt lolol
2016-10-04 01:20:19	Tumulte	Sure mate. Sure.

2016-10-04 01:20:54	Tumulte	I don't really care actually just wanna spit out the rage
2016-10-04 01:21:21	Tumulte	cause jack is doing shit once again
2016-10-04 01:21:42	leebre	i am doing my thing and having much more fun then inthe apple and windows years, but hey, every one is different, we have a free world...
2016-10-04 01:22:33	leebre	tumulte, you are using firewire, have a look if you have alsa kernel model loading for that device really disabled...
2016-10-04 01:22:46	Tumulte	Thing is, linux audio could've been great. But it's crap. Cause it's full of egos, they've never teamed up for anything and most likely never will
2016-10-04 01:23:29	Tumulte	there's no money to pay for the devs and no attempts to build anything to actually finance software production
2016-10-04 01:23:30	leebre	i dont know the people, egos are every where, if they are developping good foss, i will use the software for sure

2016-10-04 05:53:52	contrapunctus	one of my main gripes with the [classical] guitar is that you have to play it sitting, the footstool is actually quite uncomfortable (which one realizes when one plays with an Ergoplay), and the standing solutions aren't as trivial or mainstream.
2016-10-04 05:54:35	contrapunctus	and, this extends to all guitars, because the classical position really is the best in terms of stability and technical capability.
2016-10-04 05:54:39	holstein	have to?
2016-10-04 05:54:53	holstein	my nylon string didnt ship with a manual ;)

2016-10-04 05:55:16	dmbaturin	Frankly, I think strap buttons on nylon string guitars should be more common.
2016-10-04 05:55:47	holstein	they are quite easy to add..
2016-10-04 05:55:59	contrapunctus	dmbaturin: sure, but what sort? I saw this (apparently really stable) strap system that involved 3-4 buttons on the guitar o_o
2016-10-04 05:56:32	contrapunctus	holstein: I'm just a *little* scared of doing this operation on my $1k Alhambra T_T
2016-10-04 05:56:35	holstein	i wouldnt want to take a 10 thousand dollar nylon string, and do that with it.. but, the cordoba i have is quite nice, and has some modern conveniences like truss rod, and strap buttons.. etc
2016-10-04 05:57:00	dmbaturin	contrapunctus: Good question! I guess it will take some experimentation to find optimal placement for classical-like neck position.
2016-10-04 05:57:15	contrapunctus	dmbaturin: speaking of things that should be more common on classical guitars - cutaways o\
2016-10-04 05:57:25	dmbaturin	Well, get one of those hohners ($50 used?) and experiment. :)
2016-10-04 05:57:29	holstein	i like having the strap on it. i can get it in a nice position, without having to worry about how i sit

2016-10-04 06:01:37	holstein	i had a few of my friends check it out.. that do classical guitar more seriously.. it has a nice sound, and feel.. its not that traditional classical instrument, for sure. but, its one that resembles it, that i can carry to gigs, and not worry about..
2016-10-04 06:02:16	holstein	i worry, in many cases, about the upright bass.. it being so fragile.. being 140 years old, or so, and so irreplaceable

2016-10-04 06:06:11	dmbaturin	I used them, and I don't want to do it again. If I'm going to play a nylon string guitar live, I'll get one with strap buttons.
2016-10-04 06:06:35	holstein	i have to say, im quite impressed with the cordoba brand..
2016-10-04 06:06:50	holstein	very consistent, and well made.. great value

2016-10-04 08:44:36	JazzyEagle	Wow, DSL...  There's a technology I don't hear used too often.
2016-10-04 08:44:53	bluebell	It's popular in Germany
2016-10-04 08:45:13	bluebell	Its disadvantage: DSL means ADSL usually
2016-10-04 08:45:16	JazzyEagle	Especially in the US, where federal regulation limits data over phone lines to like ..  I think it was 56kb/s or 128kb/s.
2016-10-04 08:45:23	bluebell	Th upstream is much slower than the downstream
2016-10-04 08:45:24	JazzyEagle	It's been so long since I last checked.
2016-10-04 08:45:38	bluebell	56 kBit/s was ISDN probably
2016-10-04 08:45:49	JazzyEagle	Oh, yeah, you're right.
2016-10-04 08:45:50	bluebell	In Germany we had 64 kBit/s ISDN

2016-10-04 08:46:00	JazzyEagle	hehe

2016-10-04 08:46:14	bluebell	There is a lil box called splitter
2016-10-04 08:46:16	JazzyEagle	DSL was like 700 somethin' kb/s
2016-10-04 08:46:46	bluebell	There are many flavours, usually 6000 or 16000 kBit/s downstream
2016-10-04 08:47:00	bluebell	And VDSL with 50000 or 100000
2016-10-04 08:47:17	JazzyEagle	Not bad.
2016-10-04 08:47:28	bluebell	But VDSL is only avalable in towns. You need an "outdoor DSLAM"

I'm trying to run Reaper with WINE, I'm not sure what else I might need to install in terms of audio drivers etc. and more importantly it's not recognising my midi-to-usb connected piano
2016-10-04 12:26:25	JazzyEagle	Ok, it's reconnecting now, which is great, but it's so freakin' slow now...
2016-10-04 12:26:31	JazzyEagle	But, I'll bring it back online for now.

2016-10-04 12:59:32	john_cephalopoda	On the other hand, Ubuntu should theoretically have that generic MIDI driver already.
2016-10-04 13:00:08	john_cephalopoda	Disaster_Area: Are you using qjackctl? Does it display anything for you?
2016-10-04 13:00:26	Disaster_Area	not using qjackctl
2016-10-04 13:00:37	john_cephalopoda	Using jack at all?
2016-10-04 13:00:41	Disaster_Area	haven't really installed anything outside of reaper, wine,
2016-10-04 13:00:45	Disaster_Area	no haven't even downloaded that yet
2016-10-04 13:00:51	Disaster_Area	i feel like I'm missing a lot probably that I need
2016-10-04 13:01:23	Disaster_Area	im pretty new to a lot of this
2016-10-04 13:01:50	john_cephalopoda	I am not sure about audio on wine.
2016-10-04 13:01:54	Disaster_Area	I installed kxstudio at someone in another channel's advice
2016-10-04 13:02:02	Disaster_Area	but they said I also needed wineasio and jack
2016-10-04 13:02:16	Disaster_Area	im not sure, how do i install jack?
2016-10-04 13:02:20	Disaster_Area	im on ubuntu 16.04 fwiw
2016-10-04 13:02:49	john_cephalopoda	Over the synaptics software center?
2016-10-04 13:03:24	Disaster_Area	okay. I'll look on there
2016-10-04 13:03:42	Disaster_Area	haven't used the synaptics software center before... dl'd it today tho b/c it looked useful.
2016-10-04 13:04:08	john_cephalopoda	Or just use the commandline. "sudo apt-get install qjackctl"
2016-10-04 13:04:27	john_cephalopoda	That will install all the jack stuff.
2016-10-04 13:04:38	Disaster_Area	yeah that's far easier, thanks

2016-10-04 13:05:47	Disaster_Area	nope, just got my browser / irc client / system monitor / terminal open
2016-10-04 13:05:57	Disaster_Area	hmm i had the synaptic thing open too
2016-10-04 13:06:03	Disaster_Area	but I closed that and reentered the command
2016-10-04 13:06:06	Disaster_Area	seems it's working fine now
2016-10-04 13:07:19	john_cephalopoda	When you got the kxstudio ppa already, you can simply do "sudo apt-get install wineasio" to get wineasio.
2016-10-04 13:07:28	Disaster_Area	okay great
2016-10-04 13:07:51	Disaster_Area	Reading state information... Done

2016-10-05 02:47:10	JazzyEagle	Ok.  The mixer played with a bunch of echo and reverb effects (I'm guessing at least one of each)

2016-10-05 02:47:52	JazzyEagle	The echo obviously makes the repeat (and they timed it out), and the reverb makes the trailing effect on each of echoed voices.

2016-10-05 02:48:39	JazzyEagle	Additionally I think the whisper part may have had a radio effect on it, which (IIRC) is essentially EQing and scooping out all the mids.

2016-10-05 02:49:34	JazzyEagle	The "chorus" part also sounds like there is a tremolo on it (the springy vibration sound)

2016-10-05 02:53:51	yottanami	JazzyEagle: tremolo? How can I create it?
2016-10-05 02:54:03	JazzyEagle	One other thing I would probably recommend (which they didn't do on this recording) is to record the vocals in stereo and use a stereo expander to widen the vocals so that they sound like they're on both sides of you, not in the middle.  I think it might make it more ethereal.
2016-10-05 02:54:38	JazzyEagle	yottanami: There are plugins for it (usually guitar related plugins, but they should work just fine for vocal as well)
2016-10-05 02:54:51	yottanami	tnx
2016-10-05 02:54:55	JazzyEagle	Yep.
2016-10-05 02:55:32	JazzyEagle	In essence, a tremolo basically modulates the volume.  Guitarists use it all the time to make their guitar sound like it's cutting in and out in a pattern.
2016-10-05 02:55:45	JazzyEagle	Like the intro to Sevendust's Black.  let me get a link for you...

2016-10-05 02:56:28	osmpbot	[URL] Sevendust-Black - YouTube
2016-10-05 02:56:59	JazzyEagle	You'll hear at the beginning how the guitar cuts in and out...  That's a tremolo effect.  Of course, you can change the effect so that the sound doesn't cut out completely like this more extreme example.
2016-10-05 02:57:41	JazzyEagle	The version I heard in the song you posted doesn't cut out completely, but it does modulate enough to give it kind of like a vibrato sound.
2016-10-05 03:01:22	rghvdberg	yottoanami: you might wanna look at TAL Filter 2
2016-10-05 03:01:22		[03:01]
2016-10-05 03:02:04	rghvdberg	this can not only filter but also do panorama and volume automation. You can draw the envelope in it. Very flexible
2016-10-05 03:02:19	rghvdberg	the Filter is a bit misleading name ;-)

2016-10-05 07:06:17	holstein	i would try and isolate variables..
2016-10-05 07:06:36	holstein	try using live iso's to make sure you have the same alsa, jack, kernels.. etc.. on the different hardware

2016-10-05 07:08:23	gcrk	well on my pc runs with archlinux, my notebook manjaro so there should be some differences in the software
2016-10-05 07:09:33	holstein	right
2016-10-05 07:10:06	holstein	and those differences? they can cause the behavior you are seeing.. so, for me? i may simply  download AVlinux, and use that, live, on each system.. then, i can better isolate variables..

2016-10-05 07:11:29	gcrk	okay, the first thing i will do is checking if the input works. in the gnome settings the soundcard is shown as 5.1 audio device which is the same as on my notebook
2016-10-05 07:11:35	gcrk	and then i try the live
2016-10-05 07:12:05	holstein	if i, for example, run AVlinux on both systems, and it works, both places? i can then assume its something with software support on the laptop
2016-10-05 07:12:32	holstein	if it *doest* work, on the laptop, i can then, stop messing with software fixes, and look more into the hardware
2016-10-05 07:14:25	gcrk	i will do this
2016-10-05 07:14:40	gcrk	but i need to wait until the image is loaded

2016-10-05 23:26:11	oooothatsfouros	[07:31:36] I went to the KXStudio website, and tried to see what software came pre-installed. But it seems that the link that's supposed to show me doesn't work. Is there another way to see? [07:31:36]
2016-10-05 23:26:11	oooothatsfouros	[07:32:43] For the ubuntu distribution, that is. [07:32:43]
2016-10-05 23:26:11	oooothatsfouros	[07:38:44] Would anyone happen to know a working link to the software included in the kxstudio ubuntu distribution? [07:38:44]
2016-10-05 23:26:11	oooothatsfouros	[07:39:09] It seems that when I click the one to the paste on the kxstudio website, it tells me it's an invalid paste. [07:39:09]
2016-10-05 23:26:11	gcrk	[08:15:19] are you on kxstudio.net? [08:15:19]
2016-10-05 23:26:11	gcrk	[08:16:53] you can go to repositories -> applications and there are all applications listed which can be installed [08:16:53]
2016-10-05 23:26:11	dreamer	[08:20:19] he's offline gcrk [08:20:19]
2016-10-05 23:26:11	dmbaturin	[08:22:58] And why are you advocating frontends instead of real apt-get/aptitude? :) [08:22:58]
2016-10-05 23:26:11	dreamer	[08:26:41] frontends? [08:26:41]
2016-10-05 23:26:11	dreamer	[08:26:46] he's just referring to the website [08:26:46]
2016-10-05 23:26:11	dmbaturin	[08:30:56] Ah, I see. The original question was about packages that come preinstalled, so I didn't connect the second line of the advice with kxstudio.net website, instead I thougt that's about applications menu in the GUI. [08:30:56]
2016-10-05 23:26:11	dreamer	[08:31:50] unfortunately it's not so trivial to list all packages in a certain repo [08:31:50]
2016-10-05 23:26:11	dreamer	[08:32:05] for _installed_ packages it's a little easier [08:32:05]

2016-10-06 05:12:46	catbadger	so i want to record vocals for a song I'm making in LMMS. is my best bet to record and polish the vocals separately in Audacity and patch them in as a sample?
2016-10-06 05:13:14	catbadger	how are there so many zombie rooms on freenode.
2016-10-06 05:13:48	JazzyEagle	catbadger: Some of us work during the day (sorry just poked my head in for a second just now)
2016-10-06 05:14:16	JazzyEagle	Personally, I don't use LMMS, so I wouldn't be able to speak on it.  I typically don't recommend Audacity for song writing stuff.
2016-10-06 05:14:40	JazzyEagle	It started off as a simple wave editor and does that VERY well, but then they started fleshing it out over time to be a full fledged DAW, but it never seems to every fully mature.
2016-10-06 05:15:36	JazzyEagle	I record instruments primarily and fooling a little bit with vocals.  I would recommend Ardour more, QTractor if you want to mix audio w/ MIDI.

2016-10-06 05:29:36	JazzyEagle	You're welcome.  Ardour can do that stuff as well, but it's more focused on audio stuff, so the MIDI stuff isn't as robust.  At least, not in Ardour 4.  Ardour 5 is out now, but I haven't tried it yet.

2016-10-06 07:22:12	catbadger	LMMS vs qtractor go.
2016-10-06 07:22:18	catbadger	who uses what?
2016-10-06 07:22:32	holstein	well, i dont really need what they provide, so, i dont use either..
2016-10-06 07:22:42	holstein	both are easy to try, and do different things..
2016-10-06 07:23:01	holstein	qtractor has quite a bit of momentum, and, feels more like a "professional" tool to me..
2016-10-06 07:23:18	catbadger	LMMS lacks the ability to track vocals over your sequenced beat
2016-10-06 07:23:28	holstein	i always thought LMMS seemed a bit "toy" ish, and, back when i was testing it, didnt work great with jack
2016-10-06 07:23:35	catbadger	it's a little buggy
2016-10-06 07:23:42	holstein	luckily, with jack? one can put any tracks over anything.. anywhere
2016-10-06 07:24:04	holstein	we dont have to isolate to one DAW.. and i think thats what most used to do.. ardour, with qtractor, for example, was a popular setup
2016-10-06 07:24:04		[07:24]
2016-10-06 07:24:08	catbadger	I made some beats with LMMS yesterday. I'm trying qtractor later today (after work)
2016-10-06 07:24:20	ssj71	qtractor is much more flexible. LMMS is more simple
2016-10-06 07:24:25	catbadger	perfect
2016-10-06 07:24:33	holstein	the folks that use LMMS, really like it.. and i like that its providing the work flow it provides
2016-10-06 07:24:37	ssj71	I don't use either either
2016-10-06 07:24:41	catbadger	i'm wanting to make a pop album as rock sucks when you don't have expensive mics
2016-10-06 07:24:47	holstein	sure
2016-10-06 07:24:50	catbadger	all my best sounds sound crappy
2016-10-06 07:24:55	holstein	id say, try and isolate these variables from each other
2016-10-06 07:25:12	holstein	you dont want to be testing software, and answering the question "which software is better.." while making music
2016-10-06 07:25:34	catbadger	yeah.
2016-10-06 07:25:52	holstein	try the tools, make some tests.. be flexible.. watch youtubes, and read reviews.. see firsthand what fits the needs.. *then*, make the music you are making, with those tools..
2016-10-06 07:25:59	catbadger	well i switched my main computer to linux and had to stop using fruityloops and protools.
2016-10-06 07:26:11	catbadger	then my mac died and i had to stop using garageband
2016-10-06 07:26:17	holstein	well.. you chose to. but no need to split hairs
2016-10-06 07:26:32	holstein	you may find, using ardour, and LMMS looks a lot like that
2016-10-06 07:27:03	catbadger	are there any open-source virtual amps?
2016-10-06 07:27:06	holstein	for me? i did best when i stopped trying to make the linux box do windows work.. and make ardour be cubase.. and make my proprietary plugins work where they were never promised to work
2016-10-06 07:27:21	catbadger	i'd love to be able to plug my usb interface in and ripp some guitar lines
2016-10-06 07:27:33	holstein	catbadger: there are lots of open tools.. but, you dont need any of that to "rip some guitar lines"
2016-10-06 07:27:44	catbadger	how do I simulate and amp then?
2016-10-06 07:27:53	holstein	again.. id say, try and keep that separate. look at the tools.. guitarix, and rakarrack.. etc..
2016-10-06 07:27:58	catbadger	nice
2016-10-06 07:28:08	catbadger	what i was digging for was what are the tools?
2016-10-06 07:28:08	holstein	see how others are doing what you are doing.. and *then* "rip guitar lines" or whatever
2016-10-06 07:28:09	catbadger	:)
2016-10-06 07:28:17	holstein	do it like you *should* be doing it in any daw
2016-10-06 07:28:33	ssj71	there are also lots of plugins, you can use carla or jalv to host them and connect them a bit like a pedalboard
2016-10-06 07:28:34	holstein	track both a wet and dry channel.. then, you can always apply a different tool to the dry line, later..
2016-10-06 07:28:41	ssj71	s/jalv/ingen
2016-10-06 07:29:02	holstein	catbadger: there is no "linux" making sure we have access to these tools.. and, there are licensing fees involved
2016-10-06 07:29:10	ssj71	the C*A*P*S* plugins especially are good for guitar
2016-10-06 07:29:32	catbadger	cool
2016-10-06 07:29:44	holstein	nothing is preventing, for example, fender, from making the "fender software virualizer" for linux. and works with jack, and all the other tools, flawlessly. *all* of the stack is open
2016-10-06 07:29:51	holstein	but, we cant make them release that software
2016-10-06 07:30:06	holstein	you will need to be flexible, and start trying what we have access to

2016-10-06 07:30:38	catbadger	ic.
2016-10-06 07:30:48	pifie	catbadger: you can 'rip' guitar lines
2016-10-06 07:30:59	pifie	But what you want for them is to sound a certain way
2016-10-06 07:31:11	pifie	The not cheapest but easiest way to get you happy is to get a line6 or so
2016-10-06 07:31:20	holstein	lol
2016-10-06 07:31:28	holstein	nah.. the "easiest" is just one of the free tools
2016-10-06 07:31:43	holstein	the line6 is *great* at what it provides.. and *not* necessary for "ripping guitar lines"
2016-10-06 07:32:03	catbadger	I'm rocking a peavy USB3 interface for guitar, but it basically requires virtual amps
2016-10-06 07:32:04	holstein	id say, one can find something in guitarix, and/or rackarrak that would be acceptable..
2016-10-06 07:32:20	catbadger	yeah. i'm not that picky. just want real instruments mixed with midi
2016-10-06 07:32:27	catbadger	or sequenced beats
2016-10-06 07:32:29	holstein	it doesnt *require* them, though catbadger. and keep in mind what *exactly* a virtual amp is
2016-10-06 07:32:36	holstein	its really just a sound, you can apply..
2016-10-06 07:32:38	catbadger	yeah for sure

2016-10-06 07:33:05	holstein	you can *always* go back to the dry channel, and try different sounds, or, run it through the line6 pedal that pifie finds necessary
2016-10-06 07:33:17	pifie	I didn't say I find it necessary, holstein
2016-10-06 07:33:19	catbadger	is there a place i can go to learn better workflows for using a DAW? I'm all self-taught.
2016-10-06 07:34:07	holstein	*that pifie finds the easiest way to get happy
2016-10-06 07:34:35	holstein	catbadger: the nice thing about these tools is, they are completely free to try.. so, the place for you  to learn, is right there, where you are
2016-10-06 07:34:38	holstein	try the tools, and see how they work
2016-10-06 07:34:52	holstein	i already stated youtube..

2016-10-06 07:38:16	holstein	im not one to make distro suggestions. i think one should use whatever distro they are comfortable with.. but, the AVlinux distro is a *great* way to look at these tools, in a live environment
2016-10-06 07:38:36	holstein	whatever is happening in avlinux, or kxstudio, can also be made to happen in *any* distro

2016-10-06 07:40:06	holstein	its such a change, from the way the others do it

2016-10-06 07:40:37	holstein	you buy windows, or mac, and it is what it is.. you may get garage band, or some other hobble-ware, that is included.. but, with linux? we just have access to the *actual* well supported tools
2016-10-06 07:40:37	catbadger	i am running ubuntu. is there any reason not to?

2016-10-06 07:41:00	holstein	if you like ubuntu? and its working for you? use it
2016-10-06 07:41:08	holstein	what issue are you having with ubuntu? software discovery
2016-10-06 07:41:20	holstein	so, *if* you want, you can discover the software.. you can do that many ways..
2016-10-06 07:41:29	catbadger	ok. thought maybe there was a better sound architecture in one of the AV -based distros
2016-10-06 07:41:32	holstein	asking here, and looking up, and running the software..
2016-10-06 07:41:56	holstein	catbadger: "better" is always relative.. and no.. ubuntu is able to do *exactly* what avlinux is
2016-10-06 07:42:02	holstein	the issue is, you have to learn to to that with it
2016-10-06 07:42:13	holstein	so, you can run a live iso, and learn what you may or may not want to do
2016-10-06 07:42:49	holstein	you can, for example, *think* maybe LMMS is what you need, and try and install it. it doesnt work. you mess about for a few hours, "fixing" it.. and then what? is it meeting your needs? if not. you pretty much wasted a few hours
2016-10-06 07:43:19	holstein	one can more easily, in my opinion, look at these tools, in a distro, live (live meaning *not* installed) and look at them, on ones *own* specific hardware.. and try things..
2016-10-06 07:43:33	holstein	from there, one can learn what the tools are, and what they do..

2016-10-06 07:44:18	holstein	catbadger: thats the change, here.. you didnt *choose* to use protools and fruity loops like this.. you were marketed to, and choose some industry standard tools... nothing wrong with that.. but, thats not going to happen in linux
2016-10-06 07:44:38	catbadger	I understand that
2016-10-06 07:44:41	holstein	we dont have a "linux" marketing team, making sure all the ads are fresh, and relevant
2016-10-06 07:44:44	catbadger	haha yeah
2016-10-06 07:45:14	catbadger	but qtractor does most of what I need. this is good news. I'll try it out tonight and see what beat-building feels like with it.

2016-10-06 08:08:50	catbadger	also if i started to make money, i could hit the road for shows.
2016-10-06 08:08:52	holstein	either its you making art, or you are trying to build a business..
2016-10-06 08:09:05	holstein	those dont have to be mutually exclusive, but, the starting points can be *very* different
2016-10-06 08:09:15	catbadger	I'm into the business. I'm not worried about the art for now.
2016-10-06 08:09:30	catbadger	I'll make the art I want once i'm established and can afford to
2016-10-06 08:09:37	holstein	cool.. so again. you go to youtube, and copy  what is popular
2016-10-06 08:09:41	catbadger	ok
2016-10-06 08:09:42	leebre	hehehehe
2016-10-06 08:09:49	catbadger	you're right.
2016-10-06 08:09:50	holstein	you dont have to "afford" making your own art
2016-10-06 08:10:22	holstein	its all an investment, for sure. an investment of time, or whatever.. but, one can just make art.. you dont have to put that off for any reason
2016-10-06 08:10:23	leebre	no one has listened to my song yet, I guess ?
2016-10-06 08:10:31	leebre	new track
2016-10-06 08:10:44	catbadger	so once i copy something popular, how do I make money off it?
2016-10-06 08:10:57	catbadger	free shows feel like a dead end.
2016-10-06 08:11:09	catbadger	brb need to do code review with the boss
2016-10-06 08:11:16	holstein	catbadger: again.. its *all* an investment
2016-10-06 08:11:33	holstein	most of my commercially viable friends have publicists, and teams that help
2016-10-06 08:11:44	catbadger	ok. so find an agent?
2016-10-06 08:11:51	leebre	ooh, thats the no one listens to my music blues, ooh yeah
2016-10-06 08:11:53	holstein	i didnt say that
2016-10-06 08:12:06	holstein	an agent may or may not help with *exactly* what they promise they do

2016-10-06 08:13:37	holstein	*large* popular, corporations, like walmart, that make millions a minute, are paying teams and companies to answer that question for them..
2016-10-06 08:14:05	holstein	id say, decide what your goals are, and keep it as simple as you can
2016-10-06 08:14:23	holstein	if its making art? make art. if its making money? there are lots more reliable and viable ways to do that than art..
2016-10-06 08:14:44	leebre	guess so hehehe
2016-10-06 08:14:45	holstein	if its, making money making art? then, you get ready to do a lot of work..

2016-10-06 08:19:36	holstein	the synth stabs, at 1:43.. they are a bit distracting to me
2016-10-06 08:19:56	holstein	the tone of them, for one thing.. is certainly arguably out of place.. i think thats opinion. but they are mixed quite hot
2016-10-06 08:19:59	leebre	yeah, not well, i think so too
2016-10-06 08:20:03	leebre	trombones
2016-10-06 08:20:29	holstein	right. .*not* trombones, though
2016-10-06 08:20:33	leebre	haven'tused any mastering processor like compressor or so
2016-10-06 08:20:42	holstein	you dont need "better" compressors

2016-10-06 08:21:10	holstein	lol
2016-10-06 08:21:15	leebre	okay hehehe
2016-10-06 08:21:27	holstein	this is not really up for a standards debate, though. is it? i mean, that sound is a backing track. and its louder than the lead
2016-10-06 08:21:36	leebre	right
2016-10-06 08:21:45	holstein	there are no "mixing" standards for this. its just a sound, and im saying, i think its too loud
2016-10-06 08:21:49	holstein	if you like it there? great..
2016-10-06 08:22:00	leebre	no,i do not like it this way, right
2016-10-06 08:22:07	holstein	im also saying, for me? personally? i dont like the patch.. it takes me out of the vibe..
2016-10-06 08:22:21	holstein	again.. its your track, and i feel you are asking for feedback?
2016-10-06 08:22:22	leebre	you are right, its to delayed somehow

2016-10-06 08:23:02	holstein	so thats mine.. that patch is out of place, and its mixed too hot
2016-10-06 08:23:08	leebre	yes,
2016-10-06 08:23:12	leebre	but the bass is funny, right?
2016-10-06 08:23:15	holstein	i have other opinions for sure.. personal ones about the drum sounds, etc..

2016-10-06 08:32:46	leebre	i mean, only givin out 45% because then,i Know, I could double my quality next time, if I want hehehe
2016-10-06 08:32:56	leebre	not well mixed
2016-10-06 08:33:22	holstein	double your quality, to 96k?.. ;)

2016-10-06 08:36:53	bluebell	if you think one track is too loud then lower it to 0, then put the volume up to taste. if you have nearly the same level as before then it was correct :)
2016-10-06 08:36:56	leebre	but I felt really comfortable recording this lil track, made much fun, now I know how to work, but I amstill doing it against all rules, like using lowet latencies, which, Iknow now, are not as neccessary as I habe been thinking of

2016-10-06 08:39:33	holstein	someone asked a question?
2016-10-06 08:39:44	holstein	i thought that was a statement.. ;)

2016-10-06 08:40:48	leebre	if I am experiencing problems, I am going down to 128, but,  i start with lowest possible latency and this mostly works well, without any xruns...

2016-10-06 08:50:30	holstein	the bats though.. i think they can :)
2016-10-06 08:50:41	leebre	mmhh
2016-10-06 08:50:58	holstein	but me? i just go on an carry this to latency settings.. if i need low latency, i use it. its not "better" in every case, though.. or needed all the time
2016-10-06 08:51:16	leebre	right, seeing it the same
2016-10-06 08:51:22	leebre	its surely not better
2016-10-06 08:51:39	holstein	i think, folks spend a lot of time messing with their systems, to get low latency, which is their investment to make.. but, they really dont need it to do work..
2016-10-06 08:51:51	leebre	right
2016-10-06 08:52:00	holstein	if you do you do.. and if you want it, thats great.. but, it *could* also be a distraction..
2016-10-06 08:52:38	leebre	yeah, being focused, is hard maybe for osm's jhehe, not gettinglost
2016-10-06 08:53:02	holstein	if you got time to get lost, and its helpful, go for it

2016-10-06 10:13:12	jubo2	No.. I think I got with "anything above 2GB swap is fucking useless coz you already rebooted because lags"
2016-10-06 10:14:01	jubo2	If your memory is missing more than 2GB of shit it should keep in RAM it is Rebootzeit anyways..

2016-10-06 11:36:00	ssj71	dmbaturin: no I don't. Our band leader lifts most everything off records. Arranges them for us.
2016-10-06 11:36:21	ssj71	he buys some charts, but probably %80+ is Arr. Larry Smith
2016-10-06 11:36:28	ssj71	don't tell ASCAP :)
2016-10-06 11:38:26	ssj71	perhaps this is why big band is becoming more or less an academic thing
2016-10-06 11:38:35	dmbaturin	ssj71: Wow, that's cool. Anyway, as someone with actual big band experience, could you look at the score once I'm done with it and tell if it could possibly work?

2016-10-06 23:33:09	jubo2	[20:58:28] no one gives a verb [20:58:28]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	jubo2	[20:58:53] First they ignore you and laugh at you [20:58:53]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	holstein	[20:59:00] though, it likely is the same nick.. theres about 3 nicks that exhibit this type of behavior here.. [20:59:00]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	jubo2	[20:59:02] Then they fight you, then you win. [20:59:02]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	holstein	[20:59:08] its likely the same person [20:59:08]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	jubo2	[20:59:29] holstein: c'mon.. there are only thirteen jubos. Which one could I be? [20:59:29]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	ssj71	[21:08:02] query PipeManMusic [21:08:02]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	ssj71	[21:11:21] jubo2: we're going to kick you. This kind of talk is absolutely not ok. I don't care what race or people are being hated. its not welcome here [21:11:21]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	holstein	[21:12:30] its such a nice, welcoming, open community. do not be the embodiment of negativity.. its not necessary.. the freenode network is open. you can have a place for whatever you like [21:12:30]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	jubo2	[21:12:54] y0 me not hater. Ask for mirror, plos. [21:12:54]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	holstein	[21:13:06] one can start the #holstein-sux channel, and build a community around it. but this one? this one will continue to be open, and not based on hate [21:13:06]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	jubo2	[21:13:20] do it nao mon [21:13:20]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	ssj71	[21:13:33] yes, we don't care what you talk about in other channels, but here we care [21:13:33]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	holstein	[21:13:35] many of us have *years* invested here, making a place for users to come and feel safe, and welcome.. and that *will* conintue.. [21:13:35]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	holstein	[21:13:43] continue * [21:13:43]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	jubo2	[21:13:46] y'all just misunderstanding me [21:13:46]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	leebre	[21:14:11] then explain [21:14:11]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	jubo2	[21:14:17] leebre: about what? [21:14:17]

2016-10-06 23:33:09	jubo2	[21:14:33] please provide sample [21:14:33]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	holstein	[21:14:48] anyways.. i suggest /ignore, until the powers that be are around.. cheers all o/ [21:14:48]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	jubo2	[21:15:04] with sample I can grep [21:15:04]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	ssj71	[21:15:46] there it is [21:15:46]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	ssj71	[21:15:51] thanks PipeManMusic ! [21:15:51]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	@PipeManMusic	[21:16:00] :) [21:16:00]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	ssj71	[21:16:33] I don't think he really has a lot of hate, but he's got to learn to not talk like that [21:16:33]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	ssj71	[21:16:44] it sure sounds like hate [21:16:44]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	leebre	[21:17:19] no one needs that, also the guy does not need this for his own selfesteem [21:17:19]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	@PipeManMusic	[21:17:41] Sorry you guys had to endure that. [21:17:41]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	ssj71	[21:17:42] it really brings the tone of this channel down [21:17:42]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	@PipeManMusic	[21:17:44] Again. [21:17:44]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	dmbaturin	[21:21:14] PipeManMusic: I think you should give some +o's to more people, e.g. ssj71 or JazzyEagle. [21:21:14]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	ssj71	[21:21:43] dmbaturin: I think he's going to. We exchanged a few words in a query [21:21:43]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	dmbaturin	[21:22:13] It's not really the first situation when someone is being disruptive or otherwise counter-productive, but no one is around to enforce the order. [21:22:13]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	ssj71	[21:22:44] yes, it needs to be fixed [21:22:44]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	ssj71	[21:23:10] I think we'll gets some more ops tomorrow [21:23:10]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	leebre	[21:23:25] o.O [21:23:25]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	dmbaturin	[21:30:54] ssj71: Do you know of any freely licensed big band arranges? [21:30:54]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	dmbaturin	[21:31:57] I want to learn more about how they work, but I need some examples to study. [21:31:57]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	ssj71	[21:36:00] dmbaturin: no I don't. Our band leader lifts most everything off records. Arranges them for us. [21:36:00]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	ssj71	[21:36:21] he buys some charts, but probably %80+ is Arr. Larry Smith [21:36:21]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	ssj71	[21:36:28] don't tell ASCAP :) [21:36:28]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	ssj71	[21:38:26] perhaps this is why big band is becoming more or less an academic thing [21:38:26]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	dmbaturin	[21:38:35] ssj71: Wow, that's cool. Anyway, as someone with actual big band experience, could you look at the score once I'm done with it and tell if it could possibly work? [21:38:35]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	ssj71	[21:38:57] I can try, but I'll mostly only be able to tell about the trombone part :) [21:38:57]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	ssj71	[21:39:07] I'll give it a look though for sure [21:39:07]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	dmbaturin	[21:40:11] I think I'll start with a not really big one, like trumpet + trombone + alto + tenor saxes. [21:40:11]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	catbadger	[21:52:23] @PipeManMusic thank you for kicking Jubo2 [21:52:23]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	catbadger	[21:52:34] that rhetoric was gross [21:52:34]

2016-10-07 04:42:54	dmbaturin	[21:30:54] ssj71: Do you know of any freely licensed big band arranges? [21:30:54]
2016-10-07 04:42:54	dmbaturin	[21:31:57] I want to learn more about how they work, but I need some examples to study. [21:31:57]
2016-10-07 04:42:54	ssj71	[21:36:00] dmbaturin: no I don't. Our band leader lifts most everything off records. Arranges them for us. [21:36:00]
2016-10-07 04:42:54	ssj71	[21:36:21] he buys some charts, but probably %80+ is Arr. Larry Smith [21:36:21]
2016-10-07 04:42:54	ssj71	[21:36:28] don't tell ASCAP :) [21:36:28]
2016-10-07 04:42:54	ssj71	[21:38:26] perhaps this is why big band is becoming more or less an academic thing [21:38:26]
2016-10-07 04:42:54	dmbaturin	[21:38:35] ssj71: Wow, that's cool. Anyway, as someone with actual big band experience, could you look at the score once I'm done with it and tell if it could possibly work? [21:38:35]
2016-10-07 04:42:54	ssj71	[21:38:57] I can try, but I'll mostly only be able to tell about the trombone part :) [21:38:57]
2016-10-07 04:42:54	ssj71	[21:39:07] I'll give it a look though for sure [21:39:07]
2016-10-07 04:42:54	dmbaturin	[21:40:11] I think I'll start with a not really big one, like trumpet + trombone + alto + tenor saxes. [21:40:11]
2016-10-07 04:42:54	catbadger	[21:52:23] @PipeManMusic thank you for kicking Jubo2 [21:52:23]
2016-10-07 04:42:54	catbadger	[21:52:34] that rhetoric was gross [21:52:34]
2016-10-07 04:42:54	leebre	[10:01:22] found a nice einstein quote, i  know its offtopic but i am selling it to you as the quote of the day: [10:01:22]
2016-10-07 04:42:54	leebre	[10:01:25] "I am thankful to all those who said NO to me. It's because of them I did it myself." -A. Einstein [10:01:25]
2016-10-07 04:42:54	gcrk	[10:04:23] thanks ;) [10:04:23]
2016-10-07 04:42:54	NeoFrontier	[10:06:18] nice quote [10:06:18]
2016-10-07 04:42:54	dmbaturin	[12:05:44] leebre: Just say no to Friedman metric. [12:05:44]
2016-10-07 04:42:54	leebre	[12:06:47] mmm,  maybe ;) [12:06:47]
2016-10-07 04:42:54	dmbaturin	[12:09:03] I'm not quite sure what he was referring to, but it's quite funny how in popular culture relativuty is attributed to Einstein exclusively. [12:09:03]
2016-10-07 04:42:54	leebre	[12:15:42] many quotes wrongly referring to him I guess, so mart guy, must be the source of many smart quotes [12:15:42]
2016-10-07 04:42:54	dmbaturin	[12:18:45] The guy who invented the language of relativity theory and people who found the solutions to the equations Einstein wrote are known only to those beyond the nerdiness event horizon (that's where you lose the ability to communicate with normal people), but then again, that stuff has no explanation that takes less than a few semesters, so it's not too surprising. [12:18:45]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	leebre	[12:22:09] I am wondering, why it takes so long til the jack 0.1.2.5 package for arch arrives... [12:22:09]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	dmbaturin	[12:25:45] Provided arch is a source-based distro, I'm wondering too. ;) [12:25:45]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	leebre	[12:27:16] not source based i guss, these are binary packages i would guess [12:27:16]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	dmbaturin	[12:27:54] As far as I remember, packages that were installed as binary still can't be rebuilt from source. Or I'm wrong? [12:27:54]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	leebre	[12:28:45] you can rebuild I would say, but you cannot install both at the same time , or maybe you can but I would not suggest that [12:28:45]
2016-10-07 04:42:55	dmbaturin	[12:30:53] In gentoo (AFAIR) and NixOS binary packages are just pre-built versions of source packages that can be updated from source. [12:30:53]

2016-10-07 05:16:11	ssj71	[21:17:42] it really brings the tone of this channel down [21:17:42]

2016-10-07 05:16:11	ssj71	[21:21:43] dmbaturin: I think he's going to. We exchanged a few words in a query [21:21:43]
2016-10-07 05:16:12	dmbaturin	[21:22:13] It's not really the first situation when someone is being disruptive or otherwise counter-productive, but no one is around to enforce the order. [21:22:13]
2016-10-07 05:16:12	ssj71	[21:22:44] yes, it needs to be fixed [21:22:44]

2016-10-07 05:39:26	leebre	[12:06:47] mmm,  maybe ;) [12:06:47]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	dmbaturin	[12:09:03] I'm not quite sure what he was referring to, but it's quite funny how in popular culture relativuty is attributed to Einstein exclusively. [12:09:03]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	leebre	[12:15:42] many quotes wrongly referring to him I guess, so mart guy, must be the source of many smart quotes [12:15:42]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	dmbaturin	[12:18:45] The guy who invented the language of relativity theory and people who found the solutions to the equations Einstein wrote are known only to those beyond the nerdiness event horizon (that's where you lose the ability to communicate with normal people), but then again, that stuff has no explanation that takes less than a few semesters, so it's not too surprising. [12:18:45]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	leebre	[12:22:09] I am wondering, why it takes so long til the jack 0.1.2.5 package for arch arrives... [12:22:09]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	dmbaturin	[12:25:45] Provided arch is a source-based distro, I'm wondering too. ;) [12:25:45]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	leebre	[12:27:16] not source based i guss, these are binary packages i would guess [12:27:16]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	dmbaturin	[12:27:54] As far as I remember, packages that were installed as binary still can't be rebuilt from source. Or I'm wrong? [12:27:54]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	leebre	[12:28:45] you can rebuild I would say, but you cannot install both at the same time , or maybe you can but I would not suggest that [12:28:45]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	dmbaturin	[12:30:53] In gentoo (AFAIR) and NixOS binary packages are just pre-built versions of source packages that can be updated from source. [12:30:53]

2016-10-07 05:39:26	NeoFrontier	[14:46:38] I had a dream [14:46:38]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	john_cephalopoda	[14:47:38] That one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."? [14:47:38]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	NeoFrontier	[14:48:45] We all have the same potential. [14:48:45]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	NeoFrontier	[14:51:11] But some are such jerks. [14:51:11]

2016-10-07 05:39:26	NeoFrontier	[14:51:52] And I did that . I did sing. [14:51:52]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	NeoFrontier	[14:53:11] And I do that. [14:53:11]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	NeoFrontier	[14:53:16] I have done that. [14:53:16]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	NeoFrontier	[15:05:46]  I did it. [15:05:46]

2016-10-07 06:41:52	john_cephalopoda	catbadger: Try to use saw waves.
2016-10-07 06:42:01	john_cephalopoda	catbadger: Maybe detune, that will make the sound a bit fatter.
2016-10-07 06:43:41	holstein	you'll just have to experiment.. also, try different kick drum patches..
2016-10-07 06:44:46	catbadger	ok thanks
2016-10-07 06:45:36	holstein	you wont find the company, that is paid to make sure we get information on making those dub drop filthy sounds
2016-10-07 06:45:50	holstein	its *all* up to us, to apply effects, and learn what it is we want, and how to get it

2016-10-07 06:46:47	holstein	folks.. imaginative, innovative, resourceful folks... would have just tweaked settings, and applied effects, and experimented.. to get "that sound" they want
2016-10-07 06:47:19	holstein	we have the freedom, in linux, to route whatever we want, where ever we want, and use whatever software is available, in any way we want.. no restrictions..
2016-10-07 06:47:35	holstein	but, there is also, no real manual, or directions, for specifics like what you are looking for
2016-10-07 06:48:35	holstein	you wont, for example, find a tutorial on using LMMS for making dub step music.. but, you can find *many* articles, on how all kinds of different musicians and producers mix kick drum sounds, and all that information can help one with getting the sounds they are looking for

The issue was that I tend to squeak when articulating in the higher register while legato works fine, he suspected it's a common issue with stock student mouthpieces being too narrow which I don't know how to compensate for and tried it himself. It took him a whole one more octave but he did run into it too.

2016-10-08 08:56:59	contrapunctus	<leebre> really, dont listen to others, because different experiences leading to different opinions, this is more irritating then it can help... thats why economy science is allways playin min theories because you need laboratory environment, to change only one variable and keep the rest static to be able to write down scientific laws

2016-10-08 09:10:31	Disaster_Area	anyone here have any experience with running Reaper in Ubuntu? I'm having some issues; I think Reaper isn't recognising any filetypes [that I've tested: .wma, .mp3, .mid, .wav] and it's not creating a non-empty midi file when I record even though when I press keys on my piano the associated sounds are reproduced fine.
2016-10-08 09:10:35	leebre	some words i ve never used hehehe
2016-10-08 09:11:12	leebre	maybe sdl missing, or some other codecs??? lib32gstreamer codecs i guess....
2016-10-08 09:11:39	edogawa	why do you care at all leebre, just because she is beautiful that doesn't make her opinion intelligent

2016-10-08 09:12:33	edogawa	and why would a pic of a woman on your bandcamp page make you a pervert if it's not a porn pic, lol
2016-10-08 09:12:41	leebre	when it comes to such topics, a woman hasmore credibility ,more knowledge andis allways right

2016-10-08 09:12:59	contrapunctus	Disaster_Area: I'm not sure how many people run Reaper on Linux nowadays; if you don't get a satisfactory answer here, you can also try the linuxmusicians.com forums; I'd also recommend giving a native DAW/sequencer a shot, preferably by using the KX Studio repositories in your Ubuntu/Debian install. There's qtractor and Ardour, among others.
2016-10-08 09:13:22	leebre	so, if i am with a woman, and she says to me i am whatever, i would say to her, yes i am probably, though i wount not think this way...

2016-10-08 09:21:40	dmbaturin	After the batshit insane feminist types accused him of... whatever they think why it's wrong to wear depictions of artistic nudity.
2016-10-08 09:21:48	leebre	i said to her, love, sex and women are part of my thoughs, all the time
2016-10-08 09:21:56	leebre	and this is maybe pervert

2016-10-08 09:24:50	leebre	we have the stronger thrive, the stronger urge so we have to be more diciplined
2016-10-08 09:25:23	leebre	women are more emotional, they are allowed to do more things then we, we must be rational
2016-10-08 09:25:33	dmbaturin	If you want something special for you, you are not for equal rights. This also applies to male rights activists that tend to be batshit insane a lot more often than feminists, frankly.
2016-10-08 09:26:08	dmbaturin	leebre: You would get DEEP in trouble with feminists of all kinds for this statement. ;)
2016-10-08 09:26:22	leebre	equal rights is not an utopia, its also quite paradox...because it means: you treat the same things common and things that are not the same differently...
2016-10-08 09:26:51	leebre	but every thing is different in the end, when you look very closely

2016-10-08 09:42:59	holstein	if i were to meet up with another linux audio user? i would have a bit of a drive..
2016-10-08 09:42:59	nilshi	Every month in cologne. Always looking for guests or speakers. And "speaker" can mean just showing your own music

2016-10-08 09:43:22	holstein	thats awesome
2016-10-08 09:43:40	holstein	i *may* try and work some kind of hacker-ish space, that is a bit more open to other topics, here, where i moved
2016-10-08 09:43:50	holstein	maybe a LUG.. .maybe more audio/music related
2016-10-08 09:43:52	dmbaturin	holstein: Well, the biggest issue with it was that it was very unfriendly to beginners, and if you have to be a professional admin or developer to join a LUG and not get humiliated, there's something seriously wrong with it.
2016-10-08 09:43:55	holstein	thats for *much* later..
2016-10-08 09:44:05	nilshi	when I am out of my exile in Duisbug (may 2017) I am looking into organizing a bigger event. a day or two.  I have this planned in the pipeline in case a LAC is in america again, or asia.
2016-10-08 09:44:24	holstein	dmbaturin: i *tried* to get folks to do presentations.. beginner friendly ones.. even a simple "watch me install ubuntu" would be helpful..
2016-10-08 09:44:43	holstein	we had a bunch of nice, high-level stuff, at one point
2016-10-08 09:44:44	Disaster_Area	contrapunctus can u tell me more about / link me to somewhere that tells me more about: the native linux DAWs?
2016-10-08 09:45:01	holstein	i can
2016-10-08 09:45:04	leebre	cologne linux audio meetings are great, i am blessed that i am livingin such a great linux friendly city hehehe
2016-10-08 09:45:16	holstein	Disaster_Area: you can basically download AVlinux, and just see them, in action, live, without installing
2016-10-08 09:45:43	Disaster_Area	i don't wanna change my OS tho, sounds like effort af
2016-10-08 09:45:43	holstein	its a bit of a change, from the norm, to think about downloading an operating system, and it *has* the software. or, access to it, baked in
2016-10-08 09:45:46	leebre	and avlinux comes withgreat ready to use sfz sample libary, too, right ???
2016-10-08 09:46:03	holstein	Disaster_Area: sure.. thats why i said "live". you can look and see what software is available
2016-10-08 09:46:08	nilshi	Disaster_Area: this is a live cd/usb. It runs without installing. You can look into specific programs then
2016-10-08 09:46:18	holstein	Disaster_Area: you can research the software included with AVlinux, or kxstudio

2016-10-08 09:46:32	leebre	youare nut running reaper in linux ???? this is opensource musician channel....youmight not find the appopriate expert for your questions here, iguess
2016-10-08 09:46:35	dmbaturin	holstein: Oh, presentations is one thing, there was enough of it. Like, how to make a thin client deployment, or authenticate windows users in OpenLDAP, or whatever. It was asking how to install ubuntu or anything like that that would get the the poor beginner vibed.
2016-10-08 09:46:42	holstein	Disaster_Area: there is no "linux" making sure, we have an up to date list for customers, for examples.. self-discovery is key

2016-10-08 09:48:19	nilshi	and lot of smaller sequencers, daws and trackers. Especially some trackers, if you are into that
2016-10-08 09:48:21	leebre	holstein, am Iright here, avlinux comes withmany sfz samples ???

2016-10-08 09:48:51	leebre	yeah, some amazing trackers, some even with plugin support i guess i am remembering
2016-10-08 09:48:56	holstein	whatever is happening in AVlinux, can be made to happen in *any* linux.. im not trying to imply you need to use a different distro, Disaster_Area. just that, simply looking at an audio specific distro, live, is a nice way to see what tools are out there, and what they do
2016-10-08 09:49:23	Disaster_Area	okay then, I'll have a think about it and look at it in a little bit
2016-10-08 09:49:49	holstein	or, just the list of software, included, in avlinux and/or kxstudio
2016-10-08 09:50:01	leebre	avlinux is so great, because its reay to use without havin any risks, just the opportunity to try out
2016-10-08 09:50:14	holstein	and you can reference each one, you dont know, and research.. and whatever linux you are using, will likely have *all* these tools, in the repo
2016-10-08 09:50:49	leebre	holstein, aren't there somepackages, that are specially only available for avlinux, like some specially adopted kxlinux packages ???

2016-10-08 09:51:48	holstein	kxstudio has some specific stuff, that falktx has built, but, he doesnt prevent it from being packaged. and in many cases, releases them upstream

2016-10-09 00:27:19	leebre	[20:01:37] but for this thing i guess, nice presets are really usefull... [20:01:37]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	holstein	[20:01:54] i just assumed, reaktor was some commercial copy of it.. [20:01:54]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	holstein	[20:03:31] well.. time to go to work.. [20:03:31]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	holstein	[20:03:33] o/ [20:03:33]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	leebre	[20:03:45] right, reaktor copied tis idea, nevertheless, for people who areused to reaktor , ams is an alternative... [20:03:45]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	john_cephalopoda	[21:27:37] Does anybody know a simple jack utility for patching together lv2 plugins with bezier lines? Only little build deps would be a plus. [21:27:37]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	john_cephalopoda	[21:27:48] Like Carla and the like [21:27:48]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	leebre	[21:32:26] you can use lv2 select as independent instances, one plugin per instance and then combining several lv2 select instances within qjackctl or patchage [21:32:26]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	leebre	[21:32:55] i cannot find proM anymore..mmh, i thought its in the distrho package , but it aint... [21:32:55]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	leebre	[21:34:12] Finished making: distrho-lv2-git r343.e396985-1 (Sat Oct  8 22:56:43 UTC 2016) [21:34:12]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	edogawa	[21:42:46] john_cephalopoda: wouldn't that be ingen? i think it does what you want and you even can run your patch as lv2 again [21:42:46]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	john_cephalopoda	[21:45:10] Thans, that looks good [21:45:10]

2016-10-09 00:27:19	john_cephalopoda	[22:58:37] Hi RcHaCK [22:58:37]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	RcHaCK	[23:18:43] hi john_cephalopoda [23:18:43]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	RcHaCK	[23:18:45] how are you [23:18:45]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	john_cephalopoda	[23:18:55] Fine, thanks. And you? [23:18:55]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	RcHaCK	[23:18:59] good [23:18:59]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	RcHaCK	[23:19:09] what kind of opensource music channel is this ? [23:19:09]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	shiihs	[23:21:00] mostly people who make music using open source tools [23:21:00]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	RcHaCK	[23:22:43] ahh which open source tools ? [23:22:43]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	shiihs	[23:25:53] there are so many, everyone uses different things [23:25:53]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	nilshi	[23:26:04] mostly vim [23:26:04]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	nilshi	[23:26:23] :) [23:26:23]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	shiihs	[23:26:42] software synthesizers, digital audio workstations, audio synthesis and algorithmic composition programming languages (using vim :p ) [23:26:42]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	shiihs	[23:27:24] if you check out the podcast you can learn about all these things :) [23:27:24]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	RcHaCK	[23:59:03] what genre of music do you all make ? [23:59:03]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	l33nux	[08:10:09] say hello to the pervert [08:10:09]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	l33nux	[08:12:45] hehehe, even the apple usb optical drive is "locked" and cannot be used with other hardware then from apple....except for linux users, there are some clean hacks, udev rule ..no magic hehehe [08:12:45]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	dmbaturin	[08:24:06] l33nux: Locked in what sense? [08:24:06]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	l33nux	[08:24:31] that you can only use it with apple hardware, the optical drive cannot be used with other hardware... [08:24:31]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	dmbaturin	[08:24:32] I have an apple USB ethernet adapter. Oddly, it's one of the least problematic ones. [08:24:32]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	l33nux	[08:24:46] but you can hack it, use special udev rule...sorry, i meant eudev rule [08:24:46]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	dmbaturin	[08:24:54] l33nux: No, I mean what do they do to prevent using it with non-apple hardware? [08:24:54]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	l33nux	[08:25:18] i can tell you, the drive is not recognized i guess...sec [08:25:18]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	dmbaturin	[08:25:56] With USB, it's pretty hard to do. Unless they make the firmware check if USB host is using non-apple identifiers, but that would be too absurd even for apple. [08:25:56]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	l33nux	[08:26:08] yes, its not recognized [08:26:08]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	dmbaturin	[08:26:20] Ok, considering the trend, few things seem too absurd for apple these days of course. [08:26:20]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	l33nux	[08:26:36] they will do what they can [08:26:36]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	dmbaturin	[08:26:40] They are getting more and more absurd every time. [08:26:40]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	l33nux	[08:27:07] yeah, hehehe, crazy, really [08:27:07]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	l33nux	[08:27:46] modern hardware and software that is not compatible to others hehehe, i mean how big is the market share of apple products over all markets, mobile, dektop, server, accesoires??? i would say 10% at max [08:27:46]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	l33nux	[08:28:37] so, they are closed to 90 % hehehe, and then youhave apple users how must use email attachments to transfer data to their i pads for example hehehe [08:28:37]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	dmbaturin	[08:29:25] I think they gave up on servers entirely by now. [08:29:25]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	bluebell	[08:39:38] Hm... are my ears getting better? Just remixed a song with less treble in the vocals [08:39:38]

2016-10-09 00:27:19	l33nux	[09:35:37] logitech bluetooth mouse is working ootb... [09:35:37]
2016-10-09 00:27:19	bluebell	[09:36:31] ... but crashed the PC? [09:36:31]
