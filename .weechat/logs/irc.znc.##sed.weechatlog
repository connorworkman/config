2016-09-17 20:54:53	jair	hello everyone
2016-09-17 20:55:27	jair	I am trying to accomplish this:
2016-09-17 20:55:51	jair	I am working on debian doing some ping test in the local server, and would like to create a graphic, but to do that I will need to select just "time=0.014" from the full line like 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms but 5000 lines
2016-09-17 20:57:07	yitz	cut -f4 -d' '
2016-09-17 20:57:21	jair	so from 5000 lines like this: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms" I would like to extract "time=0.014" on all 5000 lines
2016-09-17 20:57:31	yitz	cut -f4 -d' '
2016-09-17 20:58:00	jair	of course all 5000 lines have different values in "time=x.xxx"
2016-09-17 20:58:28	yitz	cut -f4 -d' '
2016-09-17 20:58:31	jair	yitz: would that do?
2016-09-17 20:58:43	yitz	It would select the 4th field
2016-09-17 20:58:56	jair	the file is called extract.txt and contains all 5000 lines
2016-09-17 20:59:10	yitz	It would select the 4th field from each line
2016-09-17 20:59:20	jair	hmm let me try
2016-09-17 20:59:32	yitz	Or should I repeat it yet once more?
2016-09-17 20:59:38	jair	no no
2016-09-17 20:59:57	jair	let me try becaue I am trying to understand what is consider fields...
2016-09-17 21:00:23	jair	this is the full line: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms"
2016-09-17 21:00:29	jair	not including the ""
2016-09-17 21:00:29	yitz	space-delineated item
2016-09-17 21:00:31	jair	of course
2016-09-17 21:00:41	yitz	So 7th field
2016-09-17 21:00:50	jair	yes
2016-09-17 21:00:58	jair	that makes more sense
2016-09-17 21:01:46	jair	from the 7th field in all 5000 lines I want to extract whatever values are in "time=x.xxx"
2016-09-17 21:02:21	yitz	"1:64 2:bytes 3:from 4:127.0.0.1: 5:icmp_req=4864 6:ttl=64 7:time=0.014 ms"
2016-09-17 21:02:25	jair	so that 5000 lines will have just this: "time=x.xxx" with their different values
2016-09-17 21:02:33	yitz	...just try it already :P
2016-09-17 21:02:38	jair	OK
2016-09-17 21:02:42	jair	hold on please
2016-09-17 21:04:17	yitz	How many times does one have to repeat themselves before they're listened to?
2016-09-17 21:05:27	jair	I am so sorry
2016-09-17 21:06:02	jair	I did it first with the F4 and of course was just grabbing 127.xxx then I tried with the -f7 and did the work
2016-09-17 21:06:05	jair	:)
2016-09-17 21:06:21	jair	yitz: thank you very much, that was very cool
2016-09-17 21:06:40	jair	yitz: I did this -> cut -f7 -d' ' ms-extract.txt > ms-extract-done.txt
2016-09-17 21:07:00	jair	the new file has the values I wanted now I can create a simple graph
2016-09-17 21:07:17	yitz	Enjoy
2016-09-17 21:07:24	jair	basically I was ro have time and changes
2016-09-17 21:07:27	jair	understand
2016-09-17 21:08:30	jair	like in the axis I want to put the time
2016-09-17 21:09:54	yitz	I help with sed and text parsing here, not graph generating
2016-09-17 21:09:54		[21:09]
2016-09-17 21:10:00	yitz	Try graphiv
2016-09-17 21:10:04	yitz	*graphiz
2016-09-17 21:10:58	jair	:)
2016-09-17 21:11:07	yitz	But if you want the time without the "time=" try: cut -d'='  -f -1
2016-09-17 21:11:12	jair	just wanted to tell you more about what I was doing :)
2016-09-17 21:11:33	yitz	I don't particularly care
2016-09-17 21:11:49	jair	hmm I think I need the time but that is appreciated my friend
2016-09-17 21:12:04	jair	I will try getting the graphic done
2016-09-17 21:12:10	jair	Thank you so much
2016-09-17 21:12:10	yitz	Happy to help with the text parsing
2016-09-17 21:12:15	yitz	You're welcome
2016-09-17 21:12:18	jair	^^

2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:57:21] so from 5000 lines like this: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms" I would like to extract "time=0.014" on all 5000 lines [06:57:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[06:57:31] cut -f4 -d' ' [06:57:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:58:00] of course all 5000 lines have different values in "time=x.xxx" [06:58:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[06:58:28] cut -f4 -d' ' [06:58:28]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:58:31] yitz: would that do? [06:58:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[06:58:43] It would select the 4th field [06:58:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:58:56] the file is called extract.txt and contains all 5000 lines [06:58:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[06:59:10] It would select the 4th field from each line [06:59:10]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:59:20] hmm let me try [06:59:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[06:59:32] Or should I repeat it yet once more? [06:59:32]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:59:38] no no [06:59:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:59:57] let me try becaue I am trying to understand what is consider fields... [06:59:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:00:23] this is the full line: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms" [07:00:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:00:29] not including the "" [07:00:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:00:29] space-delineated item [07:00:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:00:31] of course [07:00:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:00:41] So 7th field [07:00:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:00:50] yes [07:00:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:00:58] that makes more sense [07:00:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:01:46] from the 7th field in all 5000 lines I want to extract whatever values are in "time=x.xxx" [07:01:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:02:21] "1:64 2:bytes 3:from 4:127.0.0.1: 5:icmp_req=4864 6:ttl=64 7:time=0.014 ms" [07:02:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:02:25] so that 5000 lines will have just this: "time=x.xxx" with their different values [07:02:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:02:33] ...just try it already :P [07:02:33]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:02:38] OK [07:02:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:02:42] hold on please [07:02:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:04:17] How many times does one have to repeat themselves before they're listened to? [07:04:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:05:26] I am so sorry [07:05:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:06:02] I did it first with the F4 and of course was just grabbing 127.xxx then I tried with the -f7 and did the work [07:06:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:06:05] :) [07:06:05]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:06:21] yitz: thank you very much, that was very cool [07:06:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:06:40] yitz: I did this -> cut -f7 -d' ' ms-extract.txt > ms-extract-done.txt [07:06:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:07:00] the new file has the values I wanted now I can create a simple graph [07:07:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:07:17] Enjoy [07:07:17]

2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:11:07] But if you want the time without the "time=" try: cut -d'='  -f -1 [07:11:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:11:12] just wanted to tell you more about what I was doing :) [07:11:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:11:33] I don't particularly care [07:11:33]

2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:57:21] so from 5000 lines like this: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms" I would like to extract "time=0.014" on all 5000 lines [06:57:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:57:31] cut -f4 -d' ' [06:57:31]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:58:00] of course all 5000 lines have different values in "time=x.xxx" [06:58:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:58:28] cut -f4 -d' ' [06:58:28]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:58:31] yitz: would that do? [06:58:31]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:58:43] It would select the 4th field [06:58:43]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:58:56] the file is called extract.txt and contains all 5000 lines [06:58:56]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:59:10] It would select the 4th field from each line [06:59:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:59:20] hmm let me try [06:59:20]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:59:32] Or should I repeat it yet once more? [06:59:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:59:38] no no [06:59:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:59:57] let me try becaue I am trying to understand what is consider fields... [06:59:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:00:23] this is the full line: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms" [07:00:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:00:29] not including the "" [07:00:29]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:00:29] space-delineated item [07:00:29]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:00:31] of course [07:00:31]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:00:41] So 7th field [07:00:41]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:00:50] yes [07:00:50]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:00:58] that makes more sense [07:00:58]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:01:46] from the 7th field in all 5000 lines I want to extract whatever values are in "time=x.xxx" [07:01:46]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:02:21] "1:64 2:bytes 3:from 4:127.0.0.1: 5:icmp_req=4864 6:ttl=64 7:time=0.014 ms" [07:02:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:02:25] so that 5000 lines will have just this: "time=x.xxx" with their different values [07:02:25]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:02:33] ...just try it already :P [07:02:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:02:38] OK [07:02:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:02:42] hold on please [07:02:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:04:17] How many times does one have to repeat themselves before they're listened to? [07:04:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:05:26] I am so sorry [07:05:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:06:02] I did it first with the F4 and of course was just grabbing 127.xxx then I tried with the -f7 and did the work [07:06:02]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:06:05] :) [07:06:05]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:06:21] yitz: thank you very much, that was very cool [07:06:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:06:40] yitz: I did this -> cut -f7 -d' ' ms-extract.txt > ms-extract-done.txt [07:06:40]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:07:00] the new file has the values I wanted now I can create a simple graph [07:07:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:07:17] Enjoy [07:07:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:07:24] basically I was ro have time and changes [07:07:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:07:27] understand [07:07:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:08:30] like in the axis I want to put the time [07:08:30]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:09:54] I help with sed and text parsing here, not graph generating [07:09:54]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:10:00] Try graphiv [07:10:00]

2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:11:07] But if you want the time without the "time=" try: cut -d'='  -f -1 [07:11:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:11:12] just wanted to tell you more about what I was doing :) [07:11:12]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:11:33] I don't particularly care [07:11:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:11:49] hmm I think I need the time but that is appreciated my friend [07:11:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:12:04] I will try getting the graphic done [07:12:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:12:10] Thank you so much [07:12:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:12:10] Happy to help with the text parsing [07:12:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:12:15] You're welcome [07:12:15]

2016-09-18 19:38:14	tom99	what's the benefit of knowing sed, as opposed to always using python and perl?
2016-09-18 19:38:14		[19:38]
2016-09-18 19:46:15	yitz	It's lighter and faster for simple tasks, tom99
2016-09-18 19:46:33	yitz	Why break out an editor and write 8 lines in python when a simple command can do?
2016-09-18 19:47:01	yitz	Plus it's more likely to exist on some arbitrary system
2016-09-18 19:47:09	yitz	And easier to use inside a shell script
2016-09-18 19:47:28	yitz	Appropriate tool for the task

2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:06:05] :) [07:06:05]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:06:21] yitz: thank you very much, that was very cool [07:06:21]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:06:40] yitz: I did this -> cut -f7 -d' ' ms-extract.txt > ms-extract-done.txt [07:06:40]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:07:00] the new file has the values I wanted now I can create a simple graph [07:07:00]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:07:17] Enjoy [07:07:17]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:07:24] basically I was ro have time and changes [07:07:24]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:07:27] understand [07:07:27]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:08:30] like in the axis I want to put the time [07:08:30]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:09:54] I help with sed and text parsing here, not graph generating [07:09:54]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:10:00] Try graphiv [07:10:00]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:10:04] *graphiz [07:10:04]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:10:58] :) [07:10:58]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:11:07] But if you want the time without the "time=" try: cut -d'='  -f -1 [07:11:07]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:11:12] just wanted to tell you more about what I was doing :) [07:11:12]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:11:33] I don't particularly care [07:11:33]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:11:49] hmm I think I need the time but that is appreciated my friend [07:11:49]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:12:04] I will try getting the graphic done [07:12:04]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:12:10] Thank you so much [07:12:10]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:12:10] Happy to help with the text parsing [07:12:10]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:12:15] You're welcome [07:12:15]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:12:18] ^^ [07:12:18]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	ezio	[02:08:53] i want to insert a line after "test: &TEST" in a file ... how can i find that line and then use it as an input to sed [02:08:53]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[02:48:19] ezio: /test: &TEST/  to find the line [02:48:19]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[02:48:26] The a command to append a line after it [02:48:26]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	ezio	[02:48:51] actually i found out that sed has an append feature [02:48:51]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[02:49:29] Yes. The 'a' command. To append. [02:49:29]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	ezio	[02:49:38] ah yes [02:49:38]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	ezio	[02:49:39] thanks [02:49:39]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	tom99	[05:38:14] what's the benefit of knowing sed, as opposed to always using python and perl? [05:38:14]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[05:46:15] It's lighter and faster for simple tasks, tom99 [05:46:15]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[05:46:33] Why break out an editor and write 8 lines in python when a simple command can do? [05:46:33]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[05:47:01] Plus it's more likely to exist on some arbitrary system [05:47:01]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[05:47:08] And easier to use inside a shell script [05:47:08]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[05:47:28] Appropriate tool for the task [05:47:28]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	nal	[06:01:56] why should i know anything else other than perl when perl can do everything? [06:01:56]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[06:02:36] Because sometimes you want to share your code [06:02:36]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	nal	[06:08:54] i can share perl code [06:08:54]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[06:29:04] But can anyone else read it? [06:29:04]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	skrp	[07:10:30] is an escape character treated as one character "^@"? [07:10:30]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	skrp	[07:12:09] sed s/@/#/ "^@" ### does not produce "^#" [07:12:09]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	geirha	[07:34:54] Hm. OpenBSD's sed has gone with the silly GNU approach for -i?  http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/021?action=diff&rev1=67&rev2=68 [07:34:54]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	stevenm_	[07:45:19] hey is it possible to ask sed to match ^*  (i.e. an actual asterisk at the beginning of a line) and to move that line down to where the next \n\n is (i.e. a blank line) [07:45:19]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	stevenm_	[07:45:29] that might be a tall order [07:45:29]

2016-09-19 05:09:34	Petter	Maybe you don't have a log entry for those specific timestamps.

2016-09-19 05:35:47	waldner	ah, so you had a match somewhere else in some line

2016-09-19 05:38:28	ychaouche	but then it should stop there instead of going to EOF
2016-09-19 05:39:57	Soliton	so basically guesss whether the end range will still appear in the input or not.
2016-09-19 05:40:38	waldner	if does a full range match from a ^Sep 18 14:33:00 to a ^Sep 18 14:34:01
2016-09-19 05:40:55	waldner	then later it finds Sep 18 14:33:00 again, starts a new range, start printing
2016-09-19 05:41:18	waldner	since no further match is found for the closing Sep 18 14:34:01, prints to end of file

2016-09-20 00:39:05	 *	lockheed [09:27:33] needs to look up the difference between + and {1,} [09:27:33]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:27:40] I thought they were the same [09:27:40]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:28:07] You mean \{1,\} [09:28:07]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:28:14] yar [09:28:14]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:28:22] Sorry for my ERE [09:28:22]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:29:00] <geirha> \+ is undefined by POSIX, meaning implementations can make \+ mean whatever they want [09:29:00]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:29:00] <geirha> GNU's implementation happens to treat it the same as \{1,\} [09:29:00]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:29:28] And unescaped '+' means a literal + in BRE. [09:29:28]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:30:06] I read the grep pocket reference. I like it, short and to the point. [09:30:06]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:31:32] Less than 70 pages [09:31:32]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:32:23] Sounds nice, i'm not familiar with it. [09:32:23]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:32:34] + Plus One or more of the preceding expression [09:32:34]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:33:17] Right, in other dialects than BRE this is mostly true. [09:33:17]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:33:56] Oh right. There may be times when BRE is needed or preferred over ERE. [09:33:56]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:34:15] Right. [09:34:15]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:34:17] Less overhead? [09:34:17]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:34:48] Portability and maybe other things. [09:34:48]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:39:39] I wouldn't expect predefined character classes to be in BRE or stuff like this \w \W [09:39:39]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:39:50] One final limitation of basic grep: the “extended” regular ex- [09:39:50]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:39:52] pressions metacharacters— ? , + , { , } , | , ( , and ) —do not work [09:39:52]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:39:54] with basic grep. The functions provided by those characters [09:39:54]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:39:56] exist if you preface them with an escape. [09:39:56]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:40:15] So how is that not BRE if it only needs to be preceeded with a \ [09:40:15]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:41:42] I will just take it to mean that regex in sed and grep are much different [09:41:42]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:45:14] Petter: yes, that was the sed I was looking for. I just needed to add a space [^] becomes [^ ] [09:45:14]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:45:19] Thank you [09:45:19]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Riviera	[09:45:28] lockheed: No, just preceeding with \ does not make all of these characters "work." [09:45:28]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Riviera	[09:45:43] lockheed: grep, like sed, does not have \+, \?, \| [09:45:43]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:46:11] they both use the same regex engine likely, man 7 regex [09:46:11]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:46:28] or not [09:46:28]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Riviera	[09:46:29] Sure, but not always. [09:46:29]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:47:06] lockheed: With your grep you had the -E switch, which changes the BRE engine to ERE. [09:47:06]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:47:27] *which changes the regex engine from BRE to ERE. [09:47:27]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:49:12] So, if you want to develop a pattern for sed with grep, you make it a lot easier on yourself if you use the same regex engine. [09:49:12]

2016-09-20 02:26:39	armin	so a co-worker just asked me how to print a specific range of lines from a file and i just proposed to use sed -n 100,200p in favor of head/tail. he was totally happy and told me how good that worked. interesting.
2016-09-20 02:27:09	armin	i would have thought this still major sucks.
2016-09-20 02:27:22	armin	112mb text file with a lot of lines.
2016-09-20 02:28:25	geirha	112 millibits aren't that much
2016-09-20 02:28:45	Petter	:D
2016-09-20 02:29:07	armin	that's correct, but i refuse to use the shift-key when i'm chatting when it's totally obvious what i mean when saying "emm beeh".
2016-09-20 02:30:00	geirha	joking aside, it'll likely be slightly faster if you quit at line 200

2016-09-20 05:46:55	armin	lockheed: actually i do precisely that on my custom zsh setup, which consists of a huge zshrc and a self-written prompt builder written in python.

2016-09-20 05:48:11	armin	ah, oh-my-zsh. used that for quite some time. ;)
2016-09-20 05:50:21	armin	lockheed: my implementation is just a single file though (lightweight!). the down-side is that it's slow because every time you hit the enter key it spawns a python interpreter, but hey.
2016-09-20 05:53:03	armin	lockheed: but yea what i'm missing in bsd are mainly 2 things: --group-directories-first for ls and an easier to use packet filter.
2016-09-20 05:53:33	armin	lockheed: i even run one of my notebooks with freebsd exclusively, but those 2 things are still puzzling me. :)

2016-09-21 19:06:59	Soliton	[17:01:49] you're also needlessly escaping the double quote. [17:01:49]
2016-09-21 19:06:59	Soliton	[17:05:33] that might do what you want: sed 's/href="[^"]*_files\//href="/g' [17:05:33]

2016-09-21 19:06:59	jayjo	[12:50:41] is that the "matched" operator [12:50:41]

2016-09-22 00:23:53	Mmike	[21:13:44] Hi, lads. I got a file which has, among other lines, line like this: "nonce: 1234-abcd-foo-boo-booya". Can I use sed to replace everything that's after "nonce: " with my desired string, only in a line where ^nonce: ? [21:13:44]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[21:29:49] Mmike: sed 's/^nonce: .*/nonce: your desired string/' [21:29:49]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	_val_	[21:35:56] # printf '%s\n' 'nonce: foo-bar' 'more nonce: and nonsence' | sed  's/\(^nonce: \).*/\1 whateveryoulike in here/g' [21:35:56]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	shbot	[21:35:58] _val_: nonce:  whateveryoulike in here [21:35:58]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	shbot	[21:35:58] _val_: more nonce: and nonsence [21:35:58]

2016-09-22 11:23:27	_geoff	basically i need to change that to be `cell1,cell2\ncell1,cell2,cell3`
2016-09-22 11:23:33	izalove	i'd google for a decent csv parser that can reformat them
2016-09-22 11:24:10	_geoff	hrm.. i thought sed would be a good choice
2016-09-22 11:24:48	_geoff	"replace any number of commas followed by a ^M with a new line"

2016-09-23 12:20:55	jayjo	[12:50:41] is that the "matched" operator [12:50:41]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	Petter	[12:52:32] You haven't tried it? [12:52:32]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	ash_workz	[17:35:00] can sed reference the last number and append perform math on it in sed -n; like sed -n '5648,last+10' ? [17:35:00]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	gnomon	[17:35:45] ash_workz, it's _technically_ possible to convince sed to perform math, but: don't. [17:35:45]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	gnomon	[17:36:08] ash_workz, here's why: http://sed.sourceforge.net/grabbag/scripts/dc.sed [17:36:08]

2016-09-23 12:20:55	Mmike	[21:13:44] Hi, lads. I got a file which has, among other lines, line like this: "nonce: 1234-abcd-foo-boo-booya". Can I use sed to replace everything that's after "nonce: " with my desired string, only in a line where ^nonce: ? [21:13:44]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	Riviera	[21:29:49] Mmike: sed 's/^nonce: .*/nonce: your desired string/' [21:29:49]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	_val_	[21:35:56] # printf '%s\n' 'nonce: foo-bar' 'more nonce: and nonsence' | sed  's/\(^nonce: \).*/\1 whateveryoulike in here/g' [21:35:56]

2016-09-23 12:20:55	shbot	[21:35:58] _val_: more nonce: and nonsence [21:35:58]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	_geoff	[21:22:36] okay so i have these "csv" files being exported from excel by someone else.  all my csvs i tested on are clean and now i have this curve ball of these shitty excel exports [21:22:36]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	_geoff	[21:23:06] they look like `     cell1,cell2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,^Mcell1,cell2,cell3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,^M   ` [21:23:06]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	_geoff	[21:23:27] basically i need to change that to be `cell1,cell2\ncell1,cell2,cell3` [21:23:27]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	izalove	[21:23:33] i'd google for a decent csv parser that can reformat them [21:23:33]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	_geoff	[21:24:10] hrm.. i thought sed would be a good choice [21:24:10]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	_geoff	[21:24:48] "replace any number of commas followed by a ^M with a new line" [21:24:48]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	_geoff	[21:26:46] my non-working attempt: sed 's/(,)+\^M/\r/g' [21:26:46]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	izalove	[21:27:54] so you just want to remove empty fields? [21:27:54]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	izalove	[21:28:01] why bother with \r at all? [21:28:01]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	izalove	[21:28:19] sed 's/,,*/,/g' [21:28:19]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	izalove	[21:29:05] ah i see you want to replace \r with \n [21:29:05]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	izalove	[21:29:16] sed 's/,,*\r/\n/g' [21:29:16]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	_geoff	[21:30:29] yes [21:30:29]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	_geoff	[21:30:36] that makes me very very happy because it works [21:30:36]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	somaReverse	[14:17:07] Hi, How can I make sed substitude string being case-aware? [14:17:07]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	somaReverse	[14:17:13] make Good ==> Bad , good ==> bad ,and  GOOD ==> BAD [14:17:13]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	Riviera	[14:18:37] Not easily, you would use a tool more suited for that task, possibly the awk scripting language. [14:18:37]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	Petter	[14:21:58] With sed you would need one substitution for each case. [14:21:58]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	somaReverse	[14:22:25] thanks [14:22:25]

2016-09-24 00:33:54	jayjo	[12:50:41] is that the "matched" operator [12:50:41]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	Petter	[12:52:32] You haven't tried it? [12:52:32]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	ash_workz	[17:35:00] can sed reference the last number and append perform math on it in sed -n; like sed -n '5648,last+10' ? [17:35:00]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	gnomon	[17:35:45] ash_workz, it's _technically_ possible to convince sed to perform math, but: don't. [17:35:45]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	gnomon	[17:36:08] ash_workz, here's why: http://sed.sourceforge.net/grabbag/scripts/dc.sed [17:36:08]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	gnomon	[17:36:49] ash_workz, related to that same piece of code, see also http://sed.sourceforge.net/grabbag/scripts/dc_intro.txt and http://sed.sourceforge.net/grabbag/scripts/dc_overview.htm , via http://sed.sourceforge.net/grabbag/scripts/ [17:36:49]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	Mmike	[21:13:44] Hi, lads. I got a file which has, among other lines, line like this: "nonce: 1234-abcd-foo-boo-booya". Can I use sed to replace everything that's after "nonce: " with my desired string, only in a line where ^nonce: ? [21:13:44]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	Riviera	[21:29:49] Mmike: sed 's/^nonce: .*/nonce: your desired string/' [21:29:49]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	_val_	[21:35:56] # printf '%s\n' 'nonce: foo-bar' 'more nonce: and nonsence' | sed  's/\(^nonce: \).*/\1 whateveryoulike in here/g' [21:35:56]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	shbot	[21:35:58] _val_: nonce:  whateveryoulike in here [21:35:58]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	shbot	[21:35:58] _val_: more nonce: and nonsence [21:35:58]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	_geoff	[21:22:36] okay so i have these "csv" files being exported from excel by someone else.  all my csvs i tested on are clean and now i have this curve ball of these shitty excel exports [21:22:36]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	_geoff	[21:23:06] they look like `     cell1,cell2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,^Mcell1,cell2,cell3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,^M   ` [21:23:06]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	_geoff	[21:23:27] basically i need to change that to be `cell1,cell2\ncell1,cell2,cell3` [21:23:27]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	izalove	[21:23:33] i'd google for a decent csv parser that can reformat them [21:23:33]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	_geoff	[21:24:10] hrm.. i thought sed would be a good choice [21:24:10]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	_geoff	[21:24:48] "replace any number of commas followed by a ^M with a new line" [21:24:48]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	_geoff	[21:26:46] my non-working attempt: sed 's/(,)+\^M/\r/g' [21:26:46]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	izalove	[21:27:54] so you just want to remove empty fields? [21:27:54]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	izalove	[21:28:01] why bother with \r at all? [21:28:01]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	izalove	[21:28:19] sed 's/,,*/,/g' [21:28:19]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	izalove	[21:29:05] ah i see you want to replace \r with \n [21:29:05]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	izalove	[21:29:16] sed 's/,,*\r/\n/g' [21:29:16]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	_geoff	[21:30:29] yes [21:30:29]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	_geoff	[21:30:36] that makes me very very happy because it works [21:30:36]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	somaReverse	[14:17:07] Hi, How can I make sed substitude string being case-aware? [14:17:07]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	somaReverse	[14:17:13] make Good ==> Bad , good ==> bad ,and  GOOD ==> BAD [14:17:13]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	Riviera	[14:18:37] Not easily, you would use a tool more suited for that task, possibly the awk scripting language. [14:18:37]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	Petter	[14:21:58] With sed you would need one substitution for each case. [14:21:58]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	somaReverse	[14:22:25] thanks [14:22:25]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	Petter	[14:24:13] # printf '%s\n' 'Good, good, GOOD' | sed 's/Good/Bad/g; s/good/bad/g; s/GOOD/BAD/g;' [14:24:13]

2016-09-24 14:07:05	tachoknight_	Hi all. Is it possible to use sed to do a find/replace limited to the word being at the beginning of a line?
2016-09-24 14:07:34	tachoknight_	i.e. I want to replace "foo" with "bar" only if "foo" is at the beginning of the line; if it's "blah-foo" i want to leave it alone
2016-09-24 14:09:45	izalove	s/^foo/bar/
2016-09-24 14:11:02	tachoknight_	absolutely perfect, thanks izalove
2016-09-24 14:11:40	tachoknight_	so i understand, what is ^ doing?
2016-09-24 14:11:49	tachoknight_	forcing it to have nothing to the left?
2016-09-24 14:12:46	izalove	^ matches the beginning of the string

2016-09-25 21:48:34	izalove	regex is greedy
2016-09-25 21:49:00	izalove	try with [[:xdigit:]]+
2016-09-25 21:49:00	tsak	hmm, that's the problem maybe eh
2016-09-25 21:49:24	tsak	wait a moment I have another case
2016-09-25 21:49:44	tsak	echo -e '&#x2019\n&#x2019;' | sed -r 's/\&\#x([[:print:]]+);?/\\u\1/g'
2016-09-25 21:49:44	tsak	\u2019
2016-09-25 21:49:44	tsak	\u2019;
2016-09-25 21:50:08	izalove	what about it?
2016-09-25 21:50:20	tsak	You must be right, regex is greedy but on this case ; stays there
2016-09-25 21:50:24	tsak	shouldn't be deleted?
2016-09-25 21:50:40	izalove	no because ; is printable
2016-09-25 21:51:07	tsak	sed -r 's/\&\#x(.+);?/\\u\1/g'
2016-09-25 21:51:12	tsak	happens with that regex too
2016-09-25 21:51:20	izalove	because ; is matched by .
2016-09-25 21:51:53	tsak	but I have ';' next to it
2016-09-25 21:52:04	tsak	it should match that ; instead, no?
2016-09-25 21:52:14	tsak	hmm
2016-09-25 21:52:24	tsak	well, I have ;? ok
2016-09-25 21:52:28	tsak	xD
2016-09-25 21:52:29	izalove	i don't know how to explain it more clearly
2016-09-25 21:52:44	izalove	.+ matches ; and ;? matches an empty string
2016-09-25 21:52:46	tsak	ok ok, you are right
2016-09-25 21:53:40	tsak	echo -e '&#x2019\n&#x2019;' | sed -r 's/\&\#x([^;]+);?/\\u\1/g'
2016-09-25 21:53:40	tsak	\u2019
2016-09-25 21:53:40	tsak	\u2019
2016-09-25 21:54:11	tsak	I don't know if this regex is ok, looks ok to me, thanks man :)
2016-09-25 21:54:29	izalove	looks ok
2016-09-25 21:58:02	tsak	can't get it to work on one line though
2016-09-25 21:58:17	izalove	[[:xdigit:]]
2016-09-25 21:58:34	tsak	this matches A-F also?
2016-09-25 21:58:39	tsak	well, that's nice
2016-09-25 21:58:42	tsak	thanks again :)
2016-09-25 21:59:37	tsak	it works great, thanks!

2016-09-26 00:32:52	tsak	hmm, sed -r '/title|link/!d' seems to work, is that right?
2016-09-26 00:32:52		[00:32]
2016-09-26 00:33:03	tsak	I mean /..../ takes any valid regex?
2016-09-26 00:34:35	waldner	what "valid" means depends on how you're running sed
2016-09-26 00:34:50	waldner	with -r, "valid" means ERE (extended regular expression)
2016-09-26 00:34:55	tsak	yeap
2016-09-26 00:35:07	tsak	I think | is only valid in ERE
2016-09-26 00:35:11	waldner	by default, "valid" means BRE (basic)
2016-09-26 00:35:20	tsak	ah, ok
2016-09-26 00:35:31	waldner	correct, although sed added | to BREs (as \| ) as an extension
2016-09-26 00:35:39	waldner	s/sed/GNU sed/
2016-09-26 00:35:41	tsak	yeah, I know that too
2016-09-26 00:36:42	tsak	but I guess I can't do    /title/!d;/link/!d    right?
2016-09-26 00:36:53	waldner	why not? that's ok
2016-09-26 00:37:14	tsak	hm, I thought it would print only titles in that case
2016-09-26 00:38:23	tsak	hm, does not print anything at all, I don't know if I get something wrong
2016-09-26 00:41:16	Riviera	That will print lines that contain both title and link.
2016-09-26 00:42:49	tsak	it does not print anything
2016-09-26 00:42:52	tsak	just an empty line
2016-09-26 00:43:06	tsak	/title/!d;/link/!d   <--- this one
2016-09-26 00:43:21	tsak	but /title|link/!d works great
2016-09-26 00:43:47	tsak	I don't want the first one, but I'm curious why it doesn't work
2016-09-26 00:43:50	tsak	that's all
2016-09-26 00:46:24	tsak	maybe I'm right that title strings is everything left on the buffer and /link/ doesn't match anything at all?
2016-09-26 00:46:36	tsak	but it doesn't even print title lol
2016-09-26 00:47:46	tsak	anyway I've got my script extremely fast (avoided a while loop by doing everything in sed) and I'm glad about that :D
2016-09-26 00:48:43	Riviera	/title/!d;/link/!d prints lines that contain *both* "title" *and* "link".
2016-09-26 00:48:43		[00:48]
2016-09-26 00:50:01	tsak	but it does not print anything.. I don't know if something else in the chain causes that but at the same position /title|link/!d works wonderfully
2016-09-26 00:50:40	Riviera	Likely because you simply do not have such lines.
2016-09-26 00:54:14	tsak	what you mean I don't have such lines?
2016-09-26 00:54:28	tsak	I said /title|link/!d works
2016-09-26 00:54:30	Riviera	That contain "title" as well as "link".
2016-09-26 00:54:36	tsak	hm?
2016-09-26 00:54:43	olspookishmagus	some help on converting this to an equivalent sed regex (to be passed in a BASH oneliner): s/.*foobar = '(.*?)'.*/$1/
2016-09-26 00:54:48	olspookishmagus	I tried with: s/.*koko\ =\ '(.*?)'.*/$1/ but to no avail
2016-09-26 00:54:52	Riviera	tsak: What exactly is not clear about the statement?
2016-09-26 00:55:16	Riviera	olspookishmagus: Mind explaining the goal in English instead?
2016-09-26 00:55:35	tsak	well, title and link are not at the same link that's what /title/!d;/link/!d does?
2016-09-26 00:55:46	Riviera	tsak: I believe you have a mistake in your sentence?
2016-09-26 00:56:10	tsak	same line sorry
2016-09-26 00:56:10	olspookishmagus	I'm getting a value from a grepped line from curl and I want just that value
2016-09-26 00:56:21	olspookishmagus	it's something like koko = '7948xm74982m7298x47921'
2016-09-26 00:56:35	Riviera	tsak: So see, and the /title/!d;/link/!d discards all lines that do not have "title" and "link" on the same line,
2016-09-26 00:56:50	Riviera	tsak: so it will print all lines that do have both these strings on the same line.
2016-09-26 00:56:52	olspookishmagus	So I'm trying with curl -s http://foo.bar | grep koko | sed 's/s/.*koko\ =\ '(.*?)'.*/$1/'
2016-09-26 00:56:59	Riviera	tsak: So if you do not have any such lines it will not print anything.
2016-09-26 00:57:02	olspookishmagus	but it won't work
2016-09-26 00:57:29	olspookishmagus	I don't know why, should I escape the spaces? should I take care for the single quotes?
2016-09-26 00:57:44	Riviera	olspookishmagus: sed 's/.*koko = '\''[^'\'']*'\''.*/\1/'

2016-09-26 00:59:15	Riviera	tsak: /title|link/!d will, instead, print all lines that contain either "title" or "link" or both.
2016-09-26 00:59:40	Riviera	tsak: Portable the script sed '/title/b;/link/!d' # should do the same
2016-09-26 00:59:45	Riviera	portably*
2016-09-26 01:00:43	tsak	ok, this is good, but the one with two delete commands does not, that's right?
2016-09-26 01:01:06	Riviera	olspookishmagus: This is probably a little more pleasing to read:  sed "s/.*koko = '\\([^']*\\)'.*/\\1/"

2016-09-26 01:02:24	waldner	tsak: it helps if you turn the commands using positives
2016-09-26 01:02:35	waldner	one becomes: sed -r '/title|link/p'
2016-09-26 01:02:47	waldner	the other: sed -r '/title/p; /link/p'
2016-09-26 01:03:01	waldner	no, ignore what I just said
2016-09-26 01:03:10	waldner	need a coffee
2016-09-26 01:03:24	waldner	but they are different, what Riviera said is correct

2016-09-26 01:04:02		[01:04]
2016-09-26 01:04:03	shbot	Riviera: cookie-bar
2016-09-26 01:04:12	tsak	No, I'm asking if /pattern1/!d;/pattern2/!d just deletes everything except pattern1... this is to understand what it does excactly, I don't need the correct way of doing it
2016-09-26 01:04:50	waldner	it deletes lines that do NOT have pattern1. If there's a line with pattern1, it's deleted if it does NOT have pattern2.
2016-09-26 01:05:04	waldner	if a line has both pattern1 AND pattern2, it's printed.
2016-09-26 01:05:35	waldner	so your statement that it deletes everything except pattern1 is not entirely correct.
2016-09-26 01:05:51	tsak	hm, ok, that's what I was looking for

2016-09-26 21:42:09	olspookishmagus	[10:56:51] So I'm trying with curl -s http://foo.bar | grep koko | sed 's/s/.*koko\ =\ '(.*?)'.*/$1/' [10:56:51]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[10:56:58] tsak: So if you do not have any such lines it will not print anything. [10:56:58]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	olspookishmagus	[10:57:02] but it won't work [10:57:02]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	olspookishmagus	[10:57:28] I don't know why, should I escape the spaces? should I take care for the single quotes? [10:57:28]

2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[10:59:14] tsak: /title|link/!d will, instead, print all lines that contain either "title" or "link" or both. [10:59:14]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[10:59:39] tsak: Portable the script sed '/title/b;/link/!d' # should do the same [10:59:39]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[10:59:45] portably* [10:59:45]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	tsak	[11:00:42] ok, this is good, but the one with two delete commands does not, that's right? [11:00:42]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[11:01:05] olspookishmagus: This is probably a little more pleasing to read:  sed "s/.*koko = '\\([^']*\\)'.*/\\1/" [11:01:05]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[11:01:23] tsak: Language barrier. [11:01:23]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	waldner	[11:02:23] tsak: it helps if you turn the commands using positives [11:02:23]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	waldner	[11:02:34] one becomes: sed -r '/title|link/p' [11:02:34]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	waldner	[11:02:46] the other: sed -r '/title/p; /link/p' [11:02:46]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	waldner	[11:03:00] no, ignore what I just said [11:03:00]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	waldner	[11:03:09] need a coffee [11:03:09]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	waldner	[11:03:23] but they are different, what Riviera said is correct [11:03:23]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[11:04:01] # sed -nescafe-cookie-cp <<< cafe-bar [11:04:01]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	shbot	[11:04:02] Riviera: cookie-bar [11:04:02]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	tsak	[11:04:11] No, I'm asking if /pattern1/!d;/pattern2/!d just deletes everything except pattern1... this is to understand what it does excactly, I don't need the correct way of doing it [11:04:11]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	waldner	[11:04:49] it deletes lines that do NOT have pattern1. If there's a line with pattern1, it's deleted if it does NOT have pattern2. [11:04:49]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	waldner	[11:05:03] if a line has both pattern1 AND pattern2, it's printed. [11:05:03]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	waldner	[11:05:35] so your statement that it deletes everything except pattern1 is not entirely correct. [11:05:35]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	tsak	[11:05:50] hm, ok, that's what I was looking for [11:05:50]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	tsak	[11:05:59] thanks for your time [11:05:59]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	olspookishmagus	[11:07:11] now what just happened there? please feed me with some theory [11:07:11]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[11:08:13] Please clarify what exactly needs clarification. [11:08:13]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	olspookishmagus	[11:14:39] Riviera: there is no greedy/ungreedy switch in sed? [11:14:39]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	olspookishmagus	[11:14:54] Riviera: there is no greedy/ungreedy switch in POSIX regex? [11:14:54]

2016-09-27 03:58:42	Lady_Aleena	So, what I have so far is s/^(.+:use)(\w+) (.+)/\2/
2016-09-27 03:59:02	Lady_Aleena	However, it appears I may be missing something.
2016-09-27 03:59:11	izalove	why do you have (\w+) after use?
2016-09-27 03:59:21	izalove	without a space?

2016-09-27 03:59:44	izalove	add a space?

2016-09-27 04:01:14	izalove	don't tell me which lines
2016-09-27 04:01:18	izalove	i like to guess
2016-09-27 04:01:25	Lady_Aleena	If I replace \w+ with .+ it works a little better.
2016-09-27 04:01:39	Lady_Aleena	It may be / is not a word character.

2016-09-27 04:01:58	Soliton	you really want to look for non-space it seems.

2016-09-27 04:49:03	Lady_Aleena	I don't know why I like grep over find for looking inside files for things. Maybe because find is a bit of a headache for me. But that is a discussion for elsewhere.
2016-09-27 04:53:09	Soliton	you could do it just with grep: grep -rPo '^use +\K([^ ;]+)' Documents/fantasy/
2016-09-27 04:53:09	Lady_Aleena	Soliton, hold on, let me man grep.
2016-09-27 04:53:09	 *	Soliton holds.
2016-09-27 04:53:35	Lady_Aleena	Okay, I now know what the options used do, now what does the \K do?
2016-09-27 04:54:00	Soliton	man perlre
2016-09-27 04:54:36	Lady_Aleena	No man entry for perlre.

2016-09-27 04:55:31	Soliton	it basically excludes the preceding stuff from the output.
2016-09-27 04:57:50	Lady_Aleena	Soliton, that is where I would get tripped up, since the man says "keep the stuff LEFT of the \K", which would not lead me to think of it returning things to the right of the \K.
2016-09-27 04:59:15	Soliton	gotta read to the end... "don't include it in $&"
2016-09-27 05:00:44	Lady_Aleena	I read that, but had no idea what it meant.
2016-09-27 05:01:02	Lady_Aleena	The $& part anyway.
2016-09-27 05:01:02	Soliton	man perlvar
2016-09-27 05:01:21	Soliton	of course you probably don't have that either... :-P
2016-09-27 05:01:22	Lady_Aleena	I write perl by not well.
2016-09-27 05:01:56	Lady_Aleena	Nope, it doesn't look like Debian included it in the install. I would probably need to install the perl docs.

2016-09-27 22:59:32	CyberDummy	[20:52:29] how hard would it be to replace ALL digits 123345 or 1 or 123 with a single # ? [20:52:29]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	CyberDummy	[20:52:38] I thought I had it, and it totally failed. [20:52:38]

2016-09-27 22:59:32	larryv	[20:54:25] like that? [20:54:25]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	larryv	[20:54:32] # echo "0" | sed 's/[[:digit:]]\{1,\}/1/g' [20:54:32]

2016-09-27 22:59:32	larryv	[20:55:03] or are you extracting the very first digit, or what? [20:55:03]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	CyberDummy	[20:55:04] yes I think so [20:55:04]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	CyberDummy	[20:55:16] I want all digits to become a sinlgle # sign [20:55:16]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	larryv	[20:55:20] oh a literal [20:55:20]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	larryv	[20:55:29] # echo "0" | sed 's/[[:digit:]]\{1,\}/#/g' [20:55:29]

2016-09-27 22:59:32	CyberDummy	[20:58:42]  sed "s/[0-9]*/#/g" [20:58:42]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	CyberDummy	[20:58:48] total faildom [20:58:48]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	larryv	[20:59:54] ah. that also matches empty strings [20:59:54]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	Petter	[21:01:14] # echo 'abc123' | sed 's/[0-9]*/#/g' [21:01:14]

2016-09-27 22:59:32	Petter	[21:02:21] Sub-ideal for replacing numbers. [21:02:21]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	CyberDummy	[23:05:42] so... this.. sed "s#\(rest/saml/sso\)/.*#\1#" user71.raw-api.calls [23:05:42]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	CyberDummy	[23:05:56] isn't changing this.. rest/saml/sso" ID="_ffff#a#-f#a#-#efe-#f#-#df#b#" IssueInstant="#-#-#T#:#:#.#Z" Version="#.#"> [23:05:56]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	CyberDummy	[23:06:13] into this.. rest/saml/sso [23:06:13]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	CyberDummy	[23:06:50] This time I am for real dunfounded [23:06:50]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	larryv	[23:11:57] CyberDummy: because there's no slash after sso [23:11:57]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	larryv	[23:12:09] your regex assumes one [23:12:09]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	CyberDummy	[23:12:35] I tried that [23:12:35]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	CyberDummy	[23:12:40] it didn't make a difference [23:12:40]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	larryv	[23:12:55] what did you try [23:12:55]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	CyberDummy	[23:13:22]  sed 's#\(rest/saml/sso/\)/.*#\1#' [23:13:22]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	larryv	[23:13:54] you added a slash [23:13:54]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	larryv	[23:14:04] this one assumes *two* slashes after "sso" [23:14:04]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	CyberDummy	[23:14:38] same thing [23:14:38]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	larryv	[23:14:56] yes, it's still wrong [23:14:56]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	CyberDummy	[23:15:08] God I suck [23:15:08]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	larryv	[23:16:12] it looks like rest/saml/sso occurs inside quotes. is that always the case? [23:16:12]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	CyberDummy	[23:17:11] it's bizzarre [23:17:11]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	CyberDummy	[23:17:27] so no, sometimes it does in some files and some files it does not [23:17:27]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	CyberDummy	[23:17:54] it only has quotes to the right of it tho [23:17:54]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	larryv	[23:17:59] at the very least you'll want to remove the slash from your regex [23:17:59]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	larryv	[23:18:10] \(rest/saml/sso\).* [23:18:10]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	larryv	[23:18:48] but that'll give you bad output if you ever have something like rest/saml/ssoabc [23:18:48]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	CyberDummy	[23:21:58] yeah that didnt change anything' [23:21:58]
2016-09-27 22:59:32	larryv	[23:23:05] # echo 'rest/saml/sso" ID="_ffff#a#-f#a#-#efe-#f#-#df#b#" IssueInstant="#-#-#T#:#:#.#Z" Version="#.#">' | sed 's#\(rest/saml/sso\).*#\1#' [23:23:05]

2016-09-28 03:40:40	waldner	but beware that's almost certainly not what you want

2016-09-28 03:42:59	rafalcpp	no way to do it without "polluting" backreferences \1 ... ?
2016-09-28 03:43:28	waldner	I think you want  sed 's/\.foo$//'
2016-09-28 03:43:54	waldner	or paste some real example

2016-09-28 03:46:11	waldner	the first part is always git@github.com ?
2016-09-28 03:46:22	rafalcpp	indeed adding before another filter  sed -e 's|.git$||g'  works.  but can it be done in same

2016-09-28 03:47:05	rafalcpp	this works in 2 calls: ( echo 'git@github.com:bob/proj.git' ; echo 'git@github.com:alice/other' ) | sed -e 's|.git$||g' | sed -e 's|^git@github.com:\(.*\)/\(.*\)$|\1;\2;|g'

2016-09-28 10:44:51		[10:44]
2016-09-28 10:45:10	larryv	.sh implies Bourne shell
2016-09-28 10:46:29	geirha	or rather, .sh implies sh, which is not bash
2016-09-28 10:46:44	imhighowareyou	isnt bash basically a reimplementation of the original bourne shell though

2016-09-28 10:47:16	geirha	it started off as a bourne compatible shell, yes, but they are incompatible both ways
2016-09-28 10:48:15	geirha	sh used to be the bourne shell on unix, but now adays, sh is any POSIX compliant shell
2016-09-28 10:49:24	_val_	imhighowareyou: have you seen Mad Damon movies? You can compare sh and bash to that :-p
2016-09-28 10:50:08	_val_	You know.. "The bourne identity" , "The bourne Ultimatum" etc..
2016-09-28 10:50:18	geirha	even when sh is symlinked to bash, it behaves differently from bash
2016-09-28 10:51:33	_val_	I guess nowadays you safely can write bash code that's compatible with 3.x and upwards and it will still work on *BSD and probably solaris.
2016-09-28 10:52:09	imhighowareyou	having the extension is just a personal preference for me. ive never encountered an issue from it. is there something waiting to snare me in its trap
2016-09-28 10:52:54	imhighowareyou	04:50:18 <geirha> even when sh is symlinked to bash, it behaves differently from bash
2016-09-28 10:53:05	larryv	the point isn't that you shouldn't have an extension
2016-09-28 10:53:14	larryv	it's that if the script contains bash-isms, the extension shouldn't be .sh
2016-09-28 10:53:29	geirha	in addition to being misleading, the extension is redundant

2016-09-28 10:58:35	geirha	If you insist on using an extension, at least use one that reflects the actual language
2016-09-28 10:58:36	imhighowareyou	whats a bashism
2016-09-28 10:58:52	geirha	a feature specific to bash
2016-09-28 10:59:03	geirha	such as declare -f
2016-09-28 11:00:05	imhighowareyou	Like [[ instead of [, etc?

2016-09-28 11:00:52	geirha	/msg greybot !bashism
2016-09-28 11:01:11	imhighowareyou	is that a good example
2016-09-28 11:01:24	imhighowareyou	of a bashism
2016-09-28 11:02:43	larryv	yes, [[ is nonportable
2016-09-28 11:03:02	larryv	(not sure i'd call it a bashism necessarily, but that's neither here nor there)
2016-09-28 11:03:27	geirha	bash based it on ksh's [[ syntax, so it's also a ksh-ism

2016-09-29 00:46:11	imhighowareyou	[21:58:41] im getting the hang of printf now finally [21:58:41]
2016-09-29 00:46:11	geirha	[21:59:10] wait, you're writing a script that writes a script to edit a script? [21:59:10]

2016-09-29 00:46:11	imhighowareyou	[22:06:49] nah, that wasn't the goal. just me exercising [22:06:49]
2016-09-29 00:46:11	imhighowareyou	[22:10:04] and for just in case you were curious or whatever [22:10:04]
2016-09-29 00:46:11	imhighowareyou	[22:23:45] './pyweb.init.sh'. That's the file I was referring to earlier as './bar.sh'. Just thought I'd show ya. That's the shell script that I'm really actually working on. It's written in/for/with bash [in mind]. [22:23:45]
2016-09-29 00:46:11	imhighowareyou	[22:26:03] and so i use that extension because of my syntax highlighter [22:26:03]
2016-09-29 00:46:11	imhighowareyou	[22:28:59] 05:59:11 <geirha> wait, you're writing a script that writes a script to edit a script? [22:28:59]
2016-09-29 00:46:11	larryv	[22:29:25] when you say "bash" do you actually mean "bash" or do you mean "shell" [22:29:25]
2016-09-29 00:46:11	imhighowareyou	[22:42:24] geirha: actually, yeah i guess kinda was doing exactly that. i was probably off on another tangent [22:42:24]
2016-09-29 00:46:11	imhighowareyou	[22:45:31] larryv: yes i do mean bash if i have to be exclusive. [22:45:31]
2016-09-29 00:46:11	larryv	[22:46:01] so .sh is still misleading. use .bash at least [22:46:01]
2016-09-29 00:46:11	larryv	[22:46:24] or get a better syntax highlighter [22:46:24]

2016-09-29 00:46:12	cousin_luigi	[07:10:59] Greetings. [07:10:59]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	Pointblank_1	[09:45:48] Hi and good day to all of you. Which syntax would you use to replace a line in one file (identified by some string, or may be by line number) by some line from another file? Example: file1.txt contains 2 rows: 1. Temperature is: 2. 35 °C  #change_me,  file2.txt contains 3 rows: 1. Current data 2. Temperature is: 3. 36 °C  #change_me. Glad for any input if you know. :) [09:45:48]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	Petter	[10:01:26] Something that may work in some cases:  printf '%s\n' '/#change_me/' c "$(grep -m1 '#change_me' file2.txt)" . w | ed -s file1.txt; [10:01:26]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	Pointblank_1	[10:02:03] Petter thank you very much. trying [10:02:03]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	Pointblank_1	[10:09:07] Petter, that is wonderful, worked in my simple example. You say "in some cases" Is there something on your mind what could cause it not working? [10:09:07]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	Petter	[10:18:00] It's outside my comfort zone, so I primarily gave myself some room. [10:18:00]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	Petter	[10:25:49] Two issues: [10:25:49]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	Petter	[10:26:01] 1. If file1.txt doesn't have #change_me, the last line will be changed. [10:26:01]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	Petter	[10:26:46] 2. If file2.txt doesn't have #change_me, the temperature will be cleared in file1.txt. [10:26:46]
2016-09-29 00:46:12	geirha	[10:31:54] 3. If grep doesn't know -m, the temparature will be cleared in file1.txt [10:31:54]

2016-09-29 09:25:35	thebope	Hello, I have a variable in a bash script
2016-09-29 09:26:25	geirha	then you might have come to the wrong place. #bash is that way
2016-09-29 09:26:32	thebope	Wow woops sorry
2016-09-29 09:26:36	thebope	I meant to finish that thought.
2016-09-29 09:27:25	thebope	I'd like to use sed to find and replace, the variable is a string. So for instance something like $GLOBAL_LINK=${sed 's/linkOne/linkTwo/g' '$OTHER_VAR}
2016-09-29 09:27:51	thebope	I'm having a bit of trouble trying to handle this I've been futzing around in the terminal. Obviously sed is a stream editor, can it handle being passed in a simple variable?
2016-09-29 09:27:58	thebope	In the end is that just a stream as well
2016-09-29 09:28:04	thebope	isn't* ?*
2016-09-29 09:28:35	geirha	It's not clear what you're trying to do
2016-09-29 09:28:53	geirha	does OTHER_VAR contain a filename? or the string to do the replacement on?
2016-09-29 09:30:09	thebope	Hi geirha it's just a string
2016-09-29 09:30:20	geirha	then sed is overkill. Just use bash
2016-09-29 09:30:47	thebope	Alright thanks geirha that makes sense, cheers

2016-09-30 00:48:22	imhighowareyou	[00:27:33] or on the other hand awk||sed||grep [00:27:33]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	wkts	[00:58:39] Just curious, is there a reason why sed '/Pattern1/ /Pattern2' file doesn't work? [00:58:39]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	wkts	[00:59:07] I've been picking up sed lately because it's easier to parse output I can already get than to write a program that gives me 90% same output [00:59:07]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	yitz	[01:03:20] What are you expecting that to happen? [01:03:20]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	wkts	[01:10:48] yitz, so i can look for a line in a file and then look if a character is in the line [01:10:48]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	wkts	[01:10:52] but non specific [01:10:52]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	wkts	[01:10:59] so i dont think you can sed->awk [01:10:59]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	wkts	[01:11:04] at least not with my knowledge of awk [01:11:04]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	wkts	[01:11:06] or sed [01:11:06]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	yitz	[01:12:23] So ... you want to find a line which matches two patterns? [01:12:23]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	nal	[01:22:15] This sounds like the beginning of a howto article [01:22:15]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	larryv	[01:28:43] wkts: didn't really explain what you're looking for [01:28:43]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	cousin_luigi	[07:10:59] Greetings. [07:10:59]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	Pointblank_1	[09:45:48] Hi and good day to all of you. Which syntax would you use to replace a line in one file (identified by some string, or may be by line number) by some line from another file? Example: file1.txt contains 2 rows: 1. Temperature is: 2. 35 °C  #change_me,  file2.txt contains 3 rows: 1. Current data 2. Temperature is: 3. 36 °C  #change_me. Glad for any input if you know. :) [09:45:48]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	Petter	[10:01:26] Something that may work in some cases:  printf '%s\n' '/#change_me/' c "$(grep -m1 '#change_me' file2.txt)" . w | ed -s file1.txt; [10:01:26]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	Pointblank_1	[10:02:03] Petter thank you very much. trying [10:02:03]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	Pointblank_1	[10:09:07] Petter, that is wonderful, worked in my simple example. You say "in some cases" Is there something on your mind what could cause it not working? [10:09:07]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	Petter	[10:18:00] It's outside my comfort zone, so I primarily gave myself some room. [10:18:00]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	Petter	[10:25:49] Two issues: [10:25:49]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	Petter	[10:26:01] 1. If file1.txt doesn't have #change_me, the last line will be changed. [10:26:01]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	Petter	[10:26:46] 2. If file2.txt doesn't have #change_me, the temperature will be cleared in file1.txt. [10:26:46]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	geirha	[10:31:54] 3. If grep doesn't know -m, the temparature will be cleared in file1.txt [10:31:54]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	cousin_luigi	[19:10:47] Greetings. [19:10:47]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	thebope	[19:25:35] Hello, I have a variable in a bash script [19:25:35]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	geirha	[19:26:25] then you might have come to the wrong place. #bash is that way [19:26:25]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	thebope	[19:26:31] Wow woops sorry [19:26:31]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	thebope	[19:26:36] I meant to finish that thought. [19:26:36]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	thebope	[19:27:25] I'd like to use sed to find and replace, the variable is a string. So for instance something like $GLOBAL_LINK=${sed 's/linkOne/linkTwo/g' '$OTHER_VAR} [19:27:25]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	thebope	[19:27:51] I'm having a bit of trouble trying to handle this I've been futzing around in the terminal. Obviously sed is a stream editor, can it handle being passed in a simple variable? [19:27:51]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	thebope	[19:27:57] In the end is that just a stream as well [19:27:57]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	thebope	[19:28:04] isn't* ?* [19:28:04]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	geirha	[19:28:35] It's not clear what you're trying to do [19:28:35]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	geirha	[19:28:53] does OTHER_VAR contain a filename? or the string to do the replacement on? [19:28:53]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	thebope	[19:30:08] Hi geirha it's just a string [19:30:08]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	geirha	[19:30:19] then sed is overkill. Just use bash [19:30:19]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	thebope	[19:30:47] Alright thanks geirha that makes sense, cheers [19:30:47]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	geirha	[19:32:30] http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/100 [19:32:30]
2016-09-30 00:48:22	thebope	[19:33:15] Ahh great! That's exactly what I was looking for [19:33:15]

2016-10-01 14:06:31	geirha	[19:26:25] then you might have come to the wrong place. #bash is that way [19:26:25]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	thebope	[19:26:31] Wow woops sorry [19:26:31]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	thebope	[19:26:36] I meant to finish that thought. [19:26:36]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	thebope	[19:27:25] I'd like to use sed to find and replace, the variable is a string. So for instance something like $GLOBAL_LINK=${sed 's/linkOne/linkTwo/g' '$OTHER_VAR} [19:27:25]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	thebope	[19:27:51] I'm having a bit of trouble trying to handle this I've been futzing around in the terminal. Obviously sed is a stream editor, can it handle being passed in a simple variable? [19:27:51]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	thebope	[19:27:57] In the end is that just a stream as well [19:27:57]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	thebope	[19:28:04] isn't* ?* [19:28:04]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	geirha	[19:28:35] It's not clear what you're trying to do [19:28:35]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	geirha	[19:28:53] does OTHER_VAR contain a filename? or the string to do the replacement on? [19:28:53]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	thebope	[19:30:08] Hi geirha it's just a string [19:30:08]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	geirha	[19:30:19] then sed is overkill. Just use bash [19:30:19]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	thebope	[19:30:47] Alright thanks geirha that makes sense, cheers [19:30:47]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	geirha	[19:32:30] http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/100 [19:32:30]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	thebope	[19:33:15] Ahh great! That's exactly what I was looking for [19:33:15]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	alturic	[04:49:41] hey guys, if i had a string like:  "foo":"bar",           what would be the best way to update the bar, by matching "foo"? [04:49:41]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	alturic	[04:49:45] In other words, I'd want to match the "bar" to edit based on "foo" [04:49:45]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	go|dfish	[04:54:37] # echo '"foo":"bar"' | sed 's/"[^"]*"\(:"bar"\)/"omg"\1/' [04:54:37]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	shbot	[04:54:38] go|dfish: "omg":"bar" [04:54:38]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	alturic	[04:55:32] But I'm looking to match the "bar", based on "foo". [04:55:32]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	alturic	[04:55:54] In other words, "foo":"bar", "foo2":"bar" [04:55:54]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	alturic	[04:56:09] I'm looking to change "foo2"s, "bar". [04:56:09]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	alturic	[04:56:35] "bar" is not unique, "foo" is. [04:56:35]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	go|dfish	[04:58:26] OOPS [04:58:26]

2016-10-01 14:06:31	shbot	[04:58:32] go|dfish: "foo":"omg", "foo2":"bar", "foo":"omg" [04:58:32]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	alturic	[05:00:01] nice, thank you sooooo much. [05:00:01]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	redhot	[15:47:07] Hello! I need to remove from a string like containing netmasks one netmask matching "10.10.X.Y/Z" [15:47:07]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	redhot	[15:47:16] How do I do that with sed? [15:47:16]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	go|dfish	[15:53:10] # echo 10.10.9.4/8 blah blah 100.100.1.1/16 10.10.X.Y/Z  | sed -E 's/(^| )10\.10\.[^.]+\.[^\/]+\/[^ ]+ *//g' [15:53:10]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	shbot	[15:53:11] go|dfish: blah blah 100.100.1.1/16 [15:53:11]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	go|dfish	[15:53:56] may need some alterations [15:53:56]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	redhot	[16:07:33] doesn't work, but I am moving [16:07:33]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	redhot	[16:07:34] thanks [16:07:34]

2016-10-01 14:06:31	wkts	[21:04:48] suddenly [21:04:48]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	wkts	[21:04:53] got to escape the $ [21:04:53]
2016-10-01 14:06:31	wkts	[21:04:59] so bash doesn't expand it [21:04:59]

2016-10-02 13:46:22	cheater	how would i modify a string to make (only) words that are all upper case become camel case? e.g. "foo BAR.BAZ QuUX" -> "foo Bar.Baz QuUX"
2016-10-02 13:52:00		[13:46]

2016-10-02 14:06:28	Riviera	this might also work:

2016-10-02 14:16:25	Riviera	Python perhaps
2016-10-02 14:16:30	cheater	OK
2016-10-02 14:16:32	Riviera	if POSIX is required then awk
2016-10-02 14:16:41	cheater	none of that
2016-10-02 14:16:48	cheater	the gnu sed one will work actually

2016-10-02 14:23:30	cheater	hmm what does that do Riviera?
2016-10-02 14:23:40	cheater	I understood the first one but not the second one
2016-10-02 14:24:07	cheater	and not the third one
2016-10-02 14:24:23	cheater	btw - do you know of a good way to check if two files are on the same file system?
2016-10-02 14:25:21	cheater	o, you can with stat
2016-10-02 14:27:05	Riviera	sorry, am a bit too tired to explain it thoroughly; \< and \> match word boundaries, [[:upper:]]+ uppercase strings, \L lowercases everything until \U or \E (or so, better check the docs), and \u uppercases the next character
2016-10-02 14:27:39	Riviera	so it's like "match whole uppercase strings, lowercase them entirely, then uppercase their first character again"
2016-10-02 14:33:00		[14:27]
2016-10-02 14:54:41	cheater	thanks. why does \u only uppercase one character? what does the & do?

2016-10-03 04:53:19	redhot	[15:47:16] How do I do that with sed? [15:47:16]

2016-10-03 04:53:19	redhot	[16:07:33] doesn't work, but I am moving [16:07:33]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	redhot	[16:07:34] thanks [16:07:34]

2016-10-03 04:53:19	wkts	[21:04:44] oh nvm [21:04:44]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	wkts	[21:04:46] i figured it out [21:04:46]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	wkts	[21:04:48] suddenly [21:04:48]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	wkts	[21:04:53] got to escape the $ [21:04:53]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	wkts	[21:04:59] so bash doesn't expand it [21:04:59]

2016-10-03 04:53:19	Petter	[21:22:16] You pay now. [21:22:16]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	cheater	[23:45:19] hi [23:45:19]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	cheater	[23:46:22] how would i modify a string to make (only) words that are all upper case become camel case? e.g. "foo BAR.BAZ QuUX" -> "foo Bar.Baz QuUX" [23:46:22]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	Riviera	[00:05:31] cheater: preferably not with sed but a more appropriate tool [00:05:31]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	Riviera	[00:06:03] cheater: if it only needs to work with GNU sed:  sed -r 's/\<([[:upper:]])([[:upper:]]+)\>/\1\L\2/g' [00:06:03]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	Riviera	[00:06:28] this might also work: [00:06:28]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	Riviera	[00:07:09] cheater: sed -r 's/\<([[:upper:]]+)\>/\L\u&/g' [00:07:09]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	cheater	[00:15:26] Riviera: ok. what other tool do you suggest? [00:15:26]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	cheater	[00:15:44] yeah, no posix compat needed actually [00:15:44]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	Riviera	[00:16:25] Python perhaps [00:16:25]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	cheater	[00:16:30] OK [00:16:30]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	Riviera	[00:16:32] if POSIX is required then awk [00:16:32]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	cheater	[00:16:41] none of that [00:16:41]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	cheater	[00:16:48] the gnu sed one will work actually [00:16:48]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	Riviera	[00:20:28] okies [00:20:28]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	Riviera	[00:22:23] ah, even shorter [00:22:23]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	Riviera	[00:22:37] sed -r 's/\<[[:upper:]]+\>/\L\u&/g' [00:22:37]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	cheater	[00:23:30] hmm what does that do Riviera? [00:23:30]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	cheater	[00:23:40] I understood the first one but not the second one [00:23:40]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	cheater	[00:24:07] and not the third one [00:24:07]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	cheater	[00:24:23] btw - do you know of a good way to check if two files are on the same file system? [00:24:23]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	cheater	[00:25:21] o, you can with stat [00:25:21]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	Riviera	[00:27:05] sorry, am a bit too tired to explain it thoroughly; \< and \> match word boundaries, [[:upper:]]+ uppercase strings, \L lowercases everything until \U or \E (or so, better check the docs), and \u uppercases the next character [00:27:05]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	Riviera	[00:27:39] so it's like "match whole uppercase strings, lowercase them entirely, then uppercase their first character again" [00:27:39]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	cheater	[00:54:41] thanks. why does \u only uppercase one character? what does the & do? [00:54:41]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	nal	[02:24:15] i think & returns matched string? [02:24:15]
2016-10-03 04:53:19	cheater	[02:27:35] OK [02:27:35]

2016-10-03 10:23:35	cuddylier	How would I uncomment a line containing a specific variable?
2016-10-03 10:23:40	cuddylier	I tried: sed -i '/^#.* name /s/^#//g' file
2016-10-03 10:23:45	cuddylier	But it did nothing for the variable 'name'
2016-10-03 10:24:49	go|dfish	well does the line start with #
2016-10-03 10:24:54	go|dfish	does the line contain 'name' surrounded by spaces?
2016-10-03 10:25:08	go|dfish	# echo '#    name omg' | sed '/^#.* name /s/^#//'
2016-10-03 10:25:08	shbot	go|dfish:     name omg
2016-10-03 10:25:28	cuddylier	go|dfish: Yes, it starts with a #, it's #name = blah
2016-10-03 10:26:07	cuddylier	I think it's because there is no space in front of 'name'?
2016-10-03 10:26:07	go|dfish	well your pattern has ' name ' - which is stating that there must be a space before 'name'
2016-10-03 10:26:12	go|dfish	indeed
2016-10-03 10:26:22	cuddylier	Do you know how I would go about fixing that in the regex?
2016-10-03 10:26:56	go|dfish	well, you could just do /name/s/^#//
2016-10-03 10:27:11	cuddylier	sed -i '/name/s/^#//' file?
2016-10-03 10:27:25	go|dfish	well, run it without -i first
2016-10-03 10:27:55	go|dfish	it depends on how strict you want to be with your matching as just /name/ would match 'firstname' for example
2016-10-03 10:28:24	cuddylier	Ah, I just want it to match 'name#
2016-10-03 10:28:24	cuddylier	'name'
2016-10-03 10:28:29	cuddylier	and when it's at the start of the line
2016-10-03 10:28:33	cuddylier	As the variable as there is comments in the file
2016-10-03 10:28:38	go|dfish	if it's always #name = blah, you could do /^#name /
2016-10-03 10:28:38	cuddylier	So I don't want the lines with comments changed of course
2016-10-03 10:29:57	cuddylier	sed '/^#name /' multicraft.conf
2016-10-03 10:30:02	cuddylier	sed: -e expression #1, char 9: missing command
2016-10-03 10:30:35	go|dfish	right, you'd still need the s/^#// part. sed '/^#name /s/^#//' multicraft.conf
2016-10-03 10:31:08	cuddylier	It returns the whole config when I do that
2016-10-03 10:31:13	cuddylier	So I assume it's not searching properly?

2016-10-05 06:57:25	badcom	I'm trying to get the 'first.last' part here: echo "first.last@emoderation.com" | sed 's/\([^@]+\)/\1/p', but it's printing the whole email address. I'm running this from a gitbash on Windows
2016-10-05 06:57:30	badcom	What am I doing wrong?
2016-10-05 06:58:34	Petter	1. + isn't a valid quantifier in Basic Regular Expressions (BRE).
2016-10-05 06:58:50	Petter	2. You're not matching the rest of the line.
2016-10-05 06:59:46	badcom	Could you provide me with a valid expression?
2016-10-05 06:59:46		[06:59]
2016-10-05 07:00:10	Petter	Also, because of the 'p' flag you will print it twice because you don't have the -n switch.
2016-10-05 07:00:26	Petter	# echo "first.last@emoderation.com" | sed 's/\([^@]\{1,\}\).*/\1/p'

2016-10-05 23:26:00	cheater	[19:45:19] inco_: quotes are necessary for edge cases [19:45:19]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	cheater	[19:45:41] normally $x without quotes works, but then at some point it will stop, and it'll be because you haven't used double quotes [19:45:41]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	cheater	[19:45:51] you should *always* wrap bash variables in quotes when using them [19:45:51]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	inco_	[19:50:03] ok [19:50:03]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	yitz	[21:03:55] inco_: "works" means "works right now but stuff will break at some point in the future and I won't understand why" [21:03:55]

2016-10-05 23:26:00	badcom	[16:55:47] Hi there [16:55:47]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	badcom	[16:57:25] I'm trying to get the 'first.last' part here: echo "first.last@emoderation.com" | sed 's/\([^@]+\)/\1/p', but it's printing the whole email address. I'm running this from a gitbash on Windows [16:57:25]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	badcom	[16:57:30] What am I doing wrong? [16:57:30]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	Petter	[16:58:34] 1. + isn't a valid quantifier in Basic Regular Expressions (BRE). [16:58:34]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	Petter	[16:58:50] 2. You're not matching the rest of the line. [16:58:50]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	badcom	[16:59:46] Could you provide me with a valid expression? [16:59:46]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	Petter	[17:00:10] Also, because of the 'p' flag you will print it twice because you don't have the -n switch. [17:00:10]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	Petter	[17:00:26] # echo "first.last@emoderation.com" | sed 's/\([^@]\{1,\}\).*/\1/p' [17:00:26]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	shbot	[17:00:28] Petter: first.last [17:00:28]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	shbot	[17:00:28] Petter: first.last [17:00:28]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	Petter	[17:03:07] See, \{1,\} does what + does in other regexp dialects. [17:03:07]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	badcom_	[17:03:54] Sorry. Connection dropped [17:03:54]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	Petter	[17:04:00] :( [17:04:00]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	badcom_	[17:04:08] Thank you. I'm new to sed =X [17:04:08]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	Petter	[17:04:28] Happy to help! [17:04:28]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	badcom_	[17:04:47] ^_^ [17:04:47]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	Petter	[17:07:14] Alternatively to focusing on part to keep, you can also look for what to delete. [17:07:14]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	Petter	[17:07:26] # echo "first.last@emoderation.com" | sed 's/@.*//' [17:07:26]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	shbot	[17:07:27] Petter: first.last [17:07:27]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	Petter	[17:07:59] This one doesn't require a character before the @ though. [17:07:59]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	badcom_	[17:10:52] the end result should be First.last, first.last@emoderation.com (note the capital letter in the first past) [17:10:52]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	badcom_	[17:12:38] So I think I should go with the option with a group [17:12:38]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	Petter	[17:13:41] # echo "first.last@emoderation.com" | sed 's/\([^@]\)\([^@]*\)@/\U\1\E\2, &/' [17:13:41]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	shbot	[17:13:43] Petter: First.last, first.last@emoderation.com [17:13:43]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	Petter	[17:13:53] Probably GNU only. [17:13:53]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	Petter	[17:14:50] Oh wait. [17:14:50]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	Petter	[17:14:59] # echo "first.last@emoderation.com" | sed 's/\([^@]*\)@/\u\1, &/' [17:14:59]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	shbot	[17:15:01] Petter: First.last, first.last@emoderation.com [17:15:01]
2016-10-05 23:26:00	Petter	[17:15:26] (Forgot about \u.) [17:15:26]

2016-10-08 03:17:55	izalove	[13:42:09] that's cheating tho [13:42:09]

2016-10-08 03:17:55	waldner	[13:47:54] in general I agree, in this case it does no harm [13:47:54]

2016-10-08 03:17:55	waldner	[13:48:58] do people in #bash insult newcomers if they see that one does eg echo foo | command rather than connamd <<< foo ? [13:48:58]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	waldner	[13:49:17] UUOE, useless use of echo, I wouldn't be surprised if they came up with that [13:49:17]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	izalove	[13:49:56] you're not exactly a newcomer [13:49:56]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	waldner	[13:50:24] well, in general they insult regardless of whether the asker is a newcomer or not [13:50:24]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	Petter	[13:50:32] #bash is too hostile and insulting for my taste. [13:50:32]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	izalove	[13:51:09] it's not that hostile [13:51:09]
2016-10-08 03:17:55	waldner	[13:51:14] they should put "WE KNOW BETTER THAN YOU, SHUT UP!" in the topic [13:51:14]

2016-10-09 02:08:36	waldner	[13:48:58] do people in #bash insult newcomers if they see that one does eg echo foo | command rather than connamd <<< foo ? [13:48:58]

2016-10-10 08:56:02	yitz	You can use the shell to read from a file and use the contents to construct a sed expression or you can make a sed "script" inside a file
2016-10-10 08:56:18	i_o	yeah, but in my mind is like two operations. something in front and something behind. Can sed pull this off?
2016-10-10 08:56:46	i_o	yitz: can you give a really simple example so I can use with a test file?
2016-10-10 08:57:20	yitz	You can use two s/// commands in sequence

2016-10-10 14:29:23	visualphoenix	yeah
2016-10-10 14:29:33	visualphoenix	with awk i think i'll have to accumulate the file into memory
2016-10-10 14:29:40	visualphoenix	and then print it in end
2016-10-10 14:29:45	yitz	Why?

2016-10-10 14:30:01	visualphoenix	idk somehow it wasnt working when i tried excluding the match in progress

2016-10-10 14:31:40	visualphoenix	let me try
2016-10-10 14:32:46	visualphoenix	hmm
2016-10-10 14:32:49	visualphoenix	not quite right
2016-10-10 14:32:49	visualphoenix	echo -e 'foo\nbar\nbaz\nbar\nfoo\nbar\nbaz\nbar' | awk '!f && /bar/ { print; f=1 }  f && /bar/ { print }'
2016-10-10 14:33:51	visualphoenix	also not quite right: echo -e 'foo\nbar\nbaz\nbar\nfoo\nbar\nbaz\nbar' | awk '!f && /bar/ { print; f=1 }  f && (! /bar/) { print }
2016-10-10 14:34:19	yitz	Eh?
2016-10-10 14:34:46	visualphoenix	it's supposed to print all lines, possibly replace and print the first match, and suppress subsequent matches
2016-10-10 14:35:24	nal	so kinda like uniq?
2016-10-10 14:35:25	visualphoenix	so /bar/ should match and give the opportunity to replace that line with something else and then subsequent matches on that should be suppressed
2016-10-10 14:35:25	visualphoenix	well
2016-10-10 14:35:33	visualphoenix	imagine you have a postgres config
2016-10-10 14:35:38	visualphoenix	and you have a setting 2x
2016-10-10 14:35:39	visualphoenix	like
2016-10-10 14:35:43	visualphoenix	foo = bar
2016-10-10 14:35:44	visualphoenix	…
2016-10-10 14:35:48	visualphoenix	foo = baz
2016-10-10 14:36:10	visualphoenix	and then you want to replace the first occurance and remove any other foo = .* matches
2016-10-10 14:36:30	visualphoenix	its easy to globally replace foo = .* with whatever
2016-10-10 14:36:40	visualphoenix	but then you have to strip the duplicates
2016-10-10 14:36:49	visualphoenix	and also keep the overall contents of the file the same
2016-10-10 14:37:38	yitz	# printf '%s\n' 'foo' 'bar' 'foo' | awk 'f && /foo/ {$1 = "Not first" }  !f && /foo/ {$1 = "First!"; f=1} 1'

2016-10-10 14:37:40	shbot	yitz: bar
2016-10-10 14:37:40	shbot	yitz: Not first
2016-10-10 14:39:13	visualphoenix	sure
2016-10-10 14:39:13		[14:39]
2016-10-10 14:39:20	visualphoenix	but Not first shouldnt print anything

2016-10-10 21:19:40	visualphoenix	[00:32:49] not quite right [00:32:49]

2016-10-10 21:19:40	visualphoenix	[00:35:33] imagine you have a postgres config [00:35:33]
2016-10-10 21:19:40	visualphoenix	[00:35:38] and you have a setting 2x [00:35:38]
2016-10-10 21:19:40	visualphoenix	[00:35:39] like [00:35:39]
2016-10-10 21:19:40	visualphoenix	[00:35:43] foo = bar [00:35:43]
2016-10-10 21:19:40	visualphoenix	[00:35:44] … [00:35:44]
2016-10-10 21:19:40	visualphoenix	[00:35:48] foo = baz [00:35:48]
2016-10-10 21:19:40	visualphoenix	[00:36:10] and then you want to replace the first occurance and remove any other foo = .* matches [00:36:10]
2016-10-10 21:19:40	visualphoenix	[00:36:30] its easy to globally replace foo = .* with whatever [00:36:30]
2016-10-10 21:19:40	visualphoenix	[00:36:40] but then you have to strip the duplicates [00:36:40]
2016-10-10 21:19:40	visualphoenix	[00:36:49] and also keep the overall contents of the file the same [00:36:49]
2016-10-10 21:19:40	yitz	[00:37:38] # printf '%s\n' 'foo' 'bar' 'foo' | awk 'f && /foo/ {$1 = "Not first" }  !f && /foo/ {$1 = "First!"; f=1} 1' [00:37:38]
2016-10-10 21:19:40	shbot	[00:37:39] yitz: First! [00:37:39]
2016-10-10 21:19:40	shbot	[00:37:40] yitz: bar [00:37:40]
2016-10-10 21:19:40	shbot	[00:37:40] yitz: Not first [00:37:40]
2016-10-10 21:19:40	visualphoenix	[00:39:13] sure [00:39:13]
2016-10-10 21:19:40	visualphoenix	[00:39:20] but Not first shouldnt print anything [00:39:20]
2016-10-10 21:19:40	yitz	[00:39:36] # printf '%s\n' 'foo' 'bar' 'foo' | awk 'f && /foo/ { next }  !f && /foo/ {$1 = "First!"; f=1} 1' [00:39:36]
2016-10-10 21:19:40	shbot	[00:39:37] yitz: First! [00:39:37]
2016-10-10 21:19:40	shbot	[00:39:37] yitz: bar [00:39:37]
2016-10-10 21:19:40	visualphoenix	[00:40:19] awesome. [00:40:19]
2016-10-10 21:19:40	visualphoenix	[00:40:34] you rock [00:40:34]
