2016-09-17 20:54:53	jair	hello everyone
2016-09-17 20:55:27	jair	I am trying to accomplish this:
2016-09-17 20:55:51	jair	I am working on debian doing some ping test in the local server, and would like to create a graphic, but to do that I will need to select just "time=0.014" from the full line like 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms but 5000 lines
2016-09-17 20:57:07	yitz	cut -f4 -d' '
2016-09-17 20:57:21	jair	so from 5000 lines like this: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms" I would like to extract "time=0.014" on all 5000 lines
2016-09-17 20:57:31	yitz	cut -f4 -d' '
2016-09-17 20:58:00	jair	of course all 5000 lines have different values in "time=x.xxx"
2016-09-17 20:58:28	yitz	cut -f4 -d' '
2016-09-17 20:58:31	jair	yitz: would that do?
2016-09-17 20:58:43	yitz	It would select the 4th field
2016-09-17 20:58:56	jair	the file is called extract.txt and contains all 5000 lines
2016-09-17 20:59:10	yitz	It would select the 4th field from each line
2016-09-17 20:59:20	jair	hmm let me try
2016-09-17 20:59:32	yitz	Or should I repeat it yet once more?
2016-09-17 20:59:38	jair	no no
2016-09-17 20:59:57	jair	let me try becaue I am trying to understand what is consider fields...
2016-09-17 21:00:23	jair	this is the full line: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms"
2016-09-17 21:00:29	jair	not including the ""
2016-09-17 21:00:29	yitz	space-delineated item
2016-09-17 21:00:31	jair	of course
2016-09-17 21:00:41	yitz	So 7th field
2016-09-17 21:00:50	jair	yes
2016-09-17 21:00:58	jair	that makes more sense
2016-09-17 21:01:46	jair	from the 7th field in all 5000 lines I want to extract whatever values are in "time=x.xxx"
2016-09-17 21:02:21	yitz	"1:64 2:bytes 3:from 4:127.0.0.1: 5:icmp_req=4864 6:ttl=64 7:time=0.014 ms"
2016-09-17 21:02:25	jair	so that 5000 lines will have just this: "time=x.xxx" with their different values
2016-09-17 21:02:33	yitz	...just try it already :P
2016-09-17 21:02:38	jair	OK
2016-09-17 21:02:42	jair	hold on please
2016-09-17 21:04:17	yitz	How many times does one have to repeat themselves before they're listened to?
2016-09-17 21:05:27	jair	I am so sorry
2016-09-17 21:06:02	jair	I did it first with the F4 and of course was just grabbing 127.xxx then I tried with the -f7 and did the work
2016-09-17 21:06:05	jair	:)
2016-09-17 21:06:21	jair	yitz: thank you very much, that was very cool
2016-09-17 21:06:40	jair	yitz: I did this -> cut -f7 -d' ' ms-extract.txt > ms-extract-done.txt
2016-09-17 21:07:00	jair	the new file has the values I wanted now I can create a simple graph
2016-09-17 21:07:17	yitz	Enjoy
2016-09-17 21:07:24	jair	basically I was ro have time and changes
2016-09-17 21:07:27	jair	understand
2016-09-17 21:08:30	jair	like in the axis I want to put the time
2016-09-17 21:09:54	yitz	I help with sed and text parsing here, not graph generating
2016-09-17 21:09:54		[21:09]
2016-09-17 21:10:00	yitz	Try graphiv
2016-09-17 21:10:04	yitz	*graphiz
2016-09-17 21:10:58	jair	:)
2016-09-17 21:11:07	yitz	But if you want the time without the "time=" try: cut -d'='  -f -1
2016-09-17 21:11:12	jair	just wanted to tell you more about what I was doing :)
2016-09-17 21:11:33	yitz	I don't particularly care
2016-09-17 21:11:49	jair	hmm I think I need the time but that is appreciated my friend
2016-09-17 21:12:04	jair	I will try getting the graphic done
2016-09-17 21:12:10	jair	Thank you so much
2016-09-17 21:12:10	yitz	Happy to help with the text parsing
2016-09-17 21:12:15	yitz	You're welcome
2016-09-17 21:12:18	jair	^^

2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:57:21] so from 5000 lines like this: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms" I would like to extract "time=0.014" on all 5000 lines [06:57:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[06:57:31] cut -f4 -d' ' [06:57:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:58:00] of course all 5000 lines have different values in "time=x.xxx" [06:58:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[06:58:28] cut -f4 -d' ' [06:58:28]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:58:31] yitz: would that do? [06:58:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[06:58:43] It would select the 4th field [06:58:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:58:56] the file is called extract.txt and contains all 5000 lines [06:58:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[06:59:10] It would select the 4th field from each line [06:59:10]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:59:20] hmm let me try [06:59:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[06:59:32] Or should I repeat it yet once more? [06:59:32]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:59:38] no no [06:59:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:59:57] let me try becaue I am trying to understand what is consider fields... [06:59:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:00:23] this is the full line: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms" [07:00:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:00:29] not including the "" [07:00:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:00:29] space-delineated item [07:00:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:00:31] of course [07:00:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:00:41] So 7th field [07:00:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:00:50] yes [07:00:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:00:58] that makes more sense [07:00:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:01:46] from the 7th field in all 5000 lines I want to extract whatever values are in "time=x.xxx" [07:01:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:02:21] "1:64 2:bytes 3:from 4:127.0.0.1: 5:icmp_req=4864 6:ttl=64 7:time=0.014 ms" [07:02:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:02:25] so that 5000 lines will have just this: "time=x.xxx" with their different values [07:02:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:02:33] ...just try it already :P [07:02:33]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:02:38] OK [07:02:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:02:42] hold on please [07:02:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:04:17] How many times does one have to repeat themselves before they're listened to? [07:04:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:05:26] I am so sorry [07:05:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:06:02] I did it first with the F4 and of course was just grabbing 127.xxx then I tried with the -f7 and did the work [07:06:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:06:05] :) [07:06:05]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:06:21] yitz: thank you very much, that was very cool [07:06:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:06:40] yitz: I did this -> cut -f7 -d' ' ms-extract.txt > ms-extract-done.txt [07:06:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:07:00] the new file has the values I wanted now I can create a simple graph [07:07:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:07:17] Enjoy [07:07:17]

2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:11:07] But if you want the time without the "time=" try: cut -d'='  -f -1 [07:11:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:11:12] just wanted to tell you more about what I was doing :) [07:11:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:11:33] I don't particularly care [07:11:33]

2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:57:21] so from 5000 lines like this: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms" I would like to extract "time=0.014" on all 5000 lines [06:57:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:57:31] cut -f4 -d' ' [06:57:31]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:58:00] of course all 5000 lines have different values in "time=x.xxx" [06:58:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:58:28] cut -f4 -d' ' [06:58:28]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:58:31] yitz: would that do? [06:58:31]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:58:43] It would select the 4th field [06:58:43]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:58:56] the file is called extract.txt and contains all 5000 lines [06:58:56]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:59:10] It would select the 4th field from each line [06:59:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:59:20] hmm let me try [06:59:20]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:59:32] Or should I repeat it yet once more? [06:59:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:59:38] no no [06:59:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:59:57] let me try becaue I am trying to understand what is consider fields... [06:59:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:00:23] this is the full line: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms" [07:00:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:00:29] not including the "" [07:00:29]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:00:29] space-delineated item [07:00:29]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:00:31] of course [07:00:31]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:00:41] So 7th field [07:00:41]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:00:50] yes [07:00:50]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:00:58] that makes more sense [07:00:58]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:01:46] from the 7th field in all 5000 lines I want to extract whatever values are in "time=x.xxx" [07:01:46]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:02:21] "1:64 2:bytes 3:from 4:127.0.0.1: 5:icmp_req=4864 6:ttl=64 7:time=0.014 ms" [07:02:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:02:25] so that 5000 lines will have just this: "time=x.xxx" with their different values [07:02:25]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:02:33] ...just try it already :P [07:02:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:02:38] OK [07:02:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:02:42] hold on please [07:02:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:04:17] How many times does one have to repeat themselves before they're listened to? [07:04:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:05:26] I am so sorry [07:05:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:06:02] I did it first with the F4 and of course was just grabbing 127.xxx then I tried with the -f7 and did the work [07:06:02]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:06:05] :) [07:06:05]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:06:21] yitz: thank you very much, that was very cool [07:06:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:06:40] yitz: I did this -> cut -f7 -d' ' ms-extract.txt > ms-extract-done.txt [07:06:40]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:07:00] the new file has the values I wanted now I can create a simple graph [07:07:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:07:17] Enjoy [07:07:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:07:24] basically I was ro have time and changes [07:07:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:07:27] understand [07:07:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:08:30] like in the axis I want to put the time [07:08:30]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:09:54] I help with sed and text parsing here, not graph generating [07:09:54]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:10:00] Try graphiv [07:10:00]

2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:11:07] But if you want the time without the "time=" try: cut -d'='  -f -1 [07:11:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:11:12] just wanted to tell you more about what I was doing :) [07:11:12]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:11:33] I don't particularly care [07:11:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:11:49] hmm I think I need the time but that is appreciated my friend [07:11:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:12:04] I will try getting the graphic done [07:12:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:12:10] Thank you so much [07:12:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:12:10] Happy to help with the text parsing [07:12:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:12:15] You're welcome [07:12:15]

2016-09-18 19:38:14	tom99	what's the benefit of knowing sed, as opposed to always using python and perl?
2016-09-18 19:38:14		[19:38]
2016-09-18 19:46:15	yitz	It's lighter and faster for simple tasks, tom99
2016-09-18 19:46:33	yitz	Why break out an editor and write 8 lines in python when a simple command can do?
2016-09-18 19:47:01	yitz	Plus it's more likely to exist on some arbitrary system
2016-09-18 19:47:09	yitz	And easier to use inside a shell script
2016-09-18 19:47:28	yitz	Appropriate tool for the task

2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:06:05] :) [07:06:05]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:06:21] yitz: thank you very much, that was very cool [07:06:21]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:06:40] yitz: I did this -> cut -f7 -d' ' ms-extract.txt > ms-extract-done.txt [07:06:40]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:07:00] the new file has the values I wanted now I can create a simple graph [07:07:00]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:07:17] Enjoy [07:07:17]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:07:24] basically I was ro have time and changes [07:07:24]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:07:27] understand [07:07:27]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:08:30] like in the axis I want to put the time [07:08:30]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:09:54] I help with sed and text parsing here, not graph generating [07:09:54]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:10:00] Try graphiv [07:10:00]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:10:04] *graphiz [07:10:04]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:10:58] :) [07:10:58]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:11:07] But if you want the time without the "time=" try: cut -d'='  -f -1 [07:11:07]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:11:12] just wanted to tell you more about what I was doing :) [07:11:12]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:11:33] I don't particularly care [07:11:33]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:11:49] hmm I think I need the time but that is appreciated my friend [07:11:49]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:12:04] I will try getting the graphic done [07:12:04]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:12:10] Thank you so much [07:12:10]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:12:10] Happy to help with the text parsing [07:12:10]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:12:15] You're welcome [07:12:15]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:12:18] ^^ [07:12:18]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	ezio	[02:08:53] i want to insert a line after "test: &TEST" in a file ... how can i find that line and then use it as an input to sed [02:08:53]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[02:48:19] ezio: /test: &TEST/  to find the line [02:48:19]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[02:48:26] The a command to append a line after it [02:48:26]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	ezio	[02:48:51] actually i found out that sed has an append feature [02:48:51]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[02:49:29] Yes. The 'a' command. To append. [02:49:29]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	ezio	[02:49:38] ah yes [02:49:38]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	ezio	[02:49:39] thanks [02:49:39]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	tom99	[05:38:14] what's the benefit of knowing sed, as opposed to always using python and perl? [05:38:14]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[05:46:15] It's lighter and faster for simple tasks, tom99 [05:46:15]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[05:46:33] Why break out an editor and write 8 lines in python when a simple command can do? [05:46:33]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[05:47:01] Plus it's more likely to exist on some arbitrary system [05:47:01]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[05:47:08] And easier to use inside a shell script [05:47:08]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[05:47:28] Appropriate tool for the task [05:47:28]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	nal	[06:01:56] why should i know anything else other than perl when perl can do everything? [06:01:56]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[06:02:36] Because sometimes you want to share your code [06:02:36]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	nal	[06:08:54] i can share perl code [06:08:54]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[06:29:04] But can anyone else read it? [06:29:04]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	skrp	[07:10:30] is an escape character treated as one character "^@"? [07:10:30]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	skrp	[07:12:09] sed s/@/#/ "^@" ### does not produce "^#" [07:12:09]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	geirha	[07:34:54] Hm. OpenBSD's sed has gone with the silly GNU approach for -i?  http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/021?action=diff&rev1=67&rev2=68 [07:34:54]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	stevenm_	[07:45:19] hey is it possible to ask sed to match ^*  (i.e. an actual asterisk at the beginning of a line) and to move that line down to where the next \n\n is (i.e. a blank line) [07:45:19]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	stevenm_	[07:45:29] that might be a tall order [07:45:29]

2016-09-19 05:09:34	Petter	Maybe you don't have a log entry for those specific timestamps.

2016-09-19 05:35:47	waldner	ah, so you had a match somewhere else in some line

2016-09-19 05:38:28	ychaouche	but then it should stop there instead of going to EOF
2016-09-19 05:39:57	Soliton	so basically guesss whether the end range will still appear in the input or not.
2016-09-19 05:40:38	waldner	if does a full range match from a ^Sep 18 14:33:00 to a ^Sep 18 14:34:01
2016-09-19 05:40:55	waldner	then later it finds Sep 18 14:33:00 again, starts a new range, start printing
2016-09-19 05:41:18	waldner	since no further match is found for the closing Sep 18 14:34:01, prints to end of file

2016-09-20 00:39:05	 *	lockheed [09:27:33] needs to look up the difference between + and {1,} [09:27:33]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:27:40] I thought they were the same [09:27:40]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:28:07] You mean \{1,\} [09:28:07]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:28:14] yar [09:28:14]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:28:22] Sorry for my ERE [09:28:22]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:29:00] <geirha> \+ is undefined by POSIX, meaning implementations can make \+ mean whatever they want [09:29:00]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:29:00] <geirha> GNU's implementation happens to treat it the same as \{1,\} [09:29:00]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:29:28] And unescaped '+' means a literal + in BRE. [09:29:28]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:30:06] I read the grep pocket reference. I like it, short and to the point. [09:30:06]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:31:32] Less than 70 pages [09:31:32]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:32:23] Sounds nice, i'm not familiar with it. [09:32:23]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:32:34] + Plus One or more of the preceding expression [09:32:34]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:33:17] Right, in other dialects than BRE this is mostly true. [09:33:17]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:33:56] Oh right. There may be times when BRE is needed or preferred over ERE. [09:33:56]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:34:15] Right. [09:34:15]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:34:17] Less overhead? [09:34:17]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:34:48] Portability and maybe other things. [09:34:48]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:39:39] I wouldn't expect predefined character classes to be in BRE or stuff like this \w \W [09:39:39]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:39:50] One final limitation of basic grep: the “extended” regular ex- [09:39:50]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:39:52] pressions metacharacters— ? , + , { , } , | , ( , and ) —do not work [09:39:52]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:39:54] with basic grep. The functions provided by those characters [09:39:54]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:39:56] exist if you preface them with an escape. [09:39:56]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:40:15] So how is that not BRE if it only needs to be preceeded with a \ [09:40:15]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:41:42] I will just take it to mean that regex in sed and grep are much different [09:41:42]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:45:14] Petter: yes, that was the sed I was looking for. I just needed to add a space [^] becomes [^ ] [09:45:14]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:45:19] Thank you [09:45:19]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Riviera	[09:45:28] lockheed: No, just preceeding with \ does not make all of these characters "work." [09:45:28]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Riviera	[09:45:43] lockheed: grep, like sed, does not have \+, \?, \| [09:45:43]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:46:11] they both use the same regex engine likely, man 7 regex [09:46:11]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:46:28] or not [09:46:28]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Riviera	[09:46:29] Sure, but not always. [09:46:29]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:47:06] lockheed: With your grep you had the -E switch, which changes the BRE engine to ERE. [09:47:06]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:47:27] *which changes the regex engine from BRE to ERE. [09:47:27]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:49:12] So, if you want to develop a pattern for sed with grep, you make it a lot easier on yourself if you use the same regex engine. [09:49:12]

2016-09-20 02:26:39	armin	so a co-worker just asked me how to print a specific range of lines from a file and i just proposed to use sed -n 100,200p in favor of head/tail. he was totally happy and told me how good that worked. interesting.
2016-09-20 02:27:09	armin	i would have thought this still major sucks.
2016-09-20 02:27:22	armin	112mb text file with a lot of lines.
2016-09-20 02:28:25	geirha	112 millibits aren't that much
2016-09-20 02:28:45	Petter	:D
2016-09-20 02:29:07	armin	that's correct, but i refuse to use the shift-key when i'm chatting when it's totally obvious what i mean when saying "emm beeh".
2016-09-20 02:30:00	geirha	joking aside, it'll likely be slightly faster if you quit at line 200

2016-09-20 05:46:55	armin	lockheed: actually i do precisely that on my custom zsh setup, which consists of a huge zshrc and a self-written prompt builder written in python.

2016-09-20 05:48:11	armin	ah, oh-my-zsh. used that for quite some time. ;)
2016-09-20 05:50:21	armin	lockheed: my implementation is just a single file though (lightweight!). the down-side is that it's slow because every time you hit the enter key it spawns a python interpreter, but hey.
2016-09-20 05:53:03	armin	lockheed: but yea what i'm missing in bsd are mainly 2 things: --group-directories-first for ls and an easier to use packet filter.
2016-09-20 05:53:33	armin	lockheed: i even run one of my notebooks with freebsd exclusively, but those 2 things are still puzzling me. :)

2016-09-21 19:06:59	Soliton	[17:01:49] you're also needlessly escaping the double quote. [17:01:49]
2016-09-21 19:06:59	Soliton	[17:05:33] that might do what you want: sed 's/href="[^"]*_files\//href="/g' [17:05:33]

2016-09-21 19:06:59	jayjo	[12:50:41] is that the "matched" operator [12:50:41]

2016-09-22 00:23:53	Mmike	[21:13:44] Hi, lads. I got a file which has, among other lines, line like this: "nonce: 1234-abcd-foo-boo-booya". Can I use sed to replace everything that's after "nonce: " with my desired string, only in a line where ^nonce: ? [21:13:44]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[21:29:49] Mmike: sed 's/^nonce: .*/nonce: your desired string/' [21:29:49]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	_val_	[21:35:56] # printf '%s\n' 'nonce: foo-bar' 'more nonce: and nonsence' | sed  's/\(^nonce: \).*/\1 whateveryoulike in here/g' [21:35:56]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	shbot	[21:35:58] _val_: nonce:  whateveryoulike in here [21:35:58]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	shbot	[21:35:58] _val_: more nonce: and nonsence [21:35:58]
