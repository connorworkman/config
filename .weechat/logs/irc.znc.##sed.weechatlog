2016-09-17 20:54:53	jair	hello everyone
2016-09-17 20:55:27	jair	I am trying to accomplish this:
2016-09-17 20:55:51	jair	I am working on debian doing some ping test in the local server, and would like to create a graphic, but to do that I will need to select just "time=0.014" from the full line like 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms but 5000 lines
2016-09-17 20:57:07	yitz	cut -f4 -d' '
2016-09-17 20:57:21	jair	so from 5000 lines like this: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms" I would like to extract "time=0.014" on all 5000 lines
2016-09-17 20:57:31	yitz	cut -f4 -d' '
2016-09-17 20:58:00	jair	of course all 5000 lines have different values in "time=x.xxx"
2016-09-17 20:58:28	yitz	cut -f4 -d' '
2016-09-17 20:58:31	jair	yitz: would that do?
2016-09-17 20:58:43	yitz	It would select the 4th field
2016-09-17 20:58:56	jair	the file is called extract.txt and contains all 5000 lines
2016-09-17 20:59:10	yitz	It would select the 4th field from each line
2016-09-17 20:59:20	jair	hmm let me try
2016-09-17 20:59:32	yitz	Or should I repeat it yet once more?
2016-09-17 20:59:38	jair	no no
2016-09-17 20:59:57	jair	let me try becaue I am trying to understand what is consider fields...
2016-09-17 21:00:23	jair	this is the full line: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms"
2016-09-17 21:00:29	jair	not including the ""
2016-09-17 21:00:29	yitz	space-delineated item
2016-09-17 21:00:31	jair	of course
2016-09-17 21:00:41	yitz	So 7th field
2016-09-17 21:00:50	jair	yes
2016-09-17 21:00:58	jair	that makes more sense
2016-09-17 21:01:46	jair	from the 7th field in all 5000 lines I want to extract whatever values are in "time=x.xxx"
2016-09-17 21:02:21	yitz	"1:64 2:bytes 3:from 4:127.0.0.1: 5:icmp_req=4864 6:ttl=64 7:time=0.014 ms"
2016-09-17 21:02:25	jair	so that 5000 lines will have just this: "time=x.xxx" with their different values
2016-09-17 21:02:33	yitz	...just try it already :P
2016-09-17 21:02:38	jair	OK
2016-09-17 21:02:42	jair	hold on please
2016-09-17 21:04:17	yitz	How many times does one have to repeat themselves before they're listened to?
2016-09-17 21:05:27	jair	I am so sorry
2016-09-17 21:06:02	jair	I did it first with the F4 and of course was just grabbing 127.xxx then I tried with the -f7 and did the work
2016-09-17 21:06:05	jair	:)
2016-09-17 21:06:21	jair	yitz: thank you very much, that was very cool
2016-09-17 21:06:40	jair	yitz: I did this -> cut -f7 -d' ' ms-extract.txt > ms-extract-done.txt
2016-09-17 21:07:00	jair	the new file has the values I wanted now I can create a simple graph
2016-09-17 21:07:17	yitz	Enjoy
2016-09-17 21:07:24	jair	basically I was ro have time and changes
2016-09-17 21:07:27	jair	understand
2016-09-17 21:08:30	jair	like in the axis I want to put the time
2016-09-17 21:09:54	yitz	I help with sed and text parsing here, not graph generating
2016-09-17 21:09:54		[21:09]
2016-09-17 21:10:00	yitz	Try graphiv
2016-09-17 21:10:04	yitz	*graphiz
2016-09-17 21:10:58	jair	:)
2016-09-17 21:11:07	yitz	But if you want the time without the "time=" try: cut -d'='  -f -1
2016-09-17 21:11:12	jair	just wanted to tell you more about what I was doing :)
2016-09-17 21:11:33	yitz	I don't particularly care
2016-09-17 21:11:49	jair	hmm I think I need the time but that is appreciated my friend
2016-09-17 21:12:04	jair	I will try getting the graphic done
2016-09-17 21:12:10	jair	Thank you so much
2016-09-17 21:12:10	yitz	Happy to help with the text parsing
2016-09-17 21:12:15	yitz	You're welcome
2016-09-17 21:12:18	jair	^^

2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:57:21] so from 5000 lines like this: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms" I would like to extract "time=0.014" on all 5000 lines [06:57:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[06:57:31] cut -f4 -d' ' [06:57:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:58:00] of course all 5000 lines have different values in "time=x.xxx" [06:58:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[06:58:28] cut -f4 -d' ' [06:58:28]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:58:31] yitz: would that do? [06:58:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[06:58:43] It would select the 4th field [06:58:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:58:56] the file is called extract.txt and contains all 5000 lines [06:58:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[06:59:10] It would select the 4th field from each line [06:59:10]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:59:20] hmm let me try [06:59:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[06:59:32] Or should I repeat it yet once more? [06:59:32]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:59:38] no no [06:59:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:59:57] let me try becaue I am trying to understand what is consider fields... [06:59:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:00:23] this is the full line: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms" [07:00:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:00:29] not including the "" [07:00:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:00:29] space-delineated item [07:00:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:00:31] of course [07:00:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:00:41] So 7th field [07:00:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:00:50] yes [07:00:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:00:58] that makes more sense [07:00:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:01:46] from the 7th field in all 5000 lines I want to extract whatever values are in "time=x.xxx" [07:01:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:02:21] "1:64 2:bytes 3:from 4:127.0.0.1: 5:icmp_req=4864 6:ttl=64 7:time=0.014 ms" [07:02:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:02:25] so that 5000 lines will have just this: "time=x.xxx" with their different values [07:02:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:02:33] ...just try it already :P [07:02:33]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:02:38] OK [07:02:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:02:42] hold on please [07:02:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:04:17] How many times does one have to repeat themselves before they're listened to? [07:04:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:05:26] I am so sorry [07:05:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:06:02] I did it first with the F4 and of course was just grabbing 127.xxx then I tried with the -f7 and did the work [07:06:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:06:05] :) [07:06:05]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:06:21] yitz: thank you very much, that was very cool [07:06:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:06:40] yitz: I did this -> cut -f7 -d' ' ms-extract.txt > ms-extract-done.txt [07:06:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:07:00] the new file has the values I wanted now I can create a simple graph [07:07:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:07:17] Enjoy [07:07:17]

2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:11:07] But if you want the time without the "time=" try: cut -d'='  -f -1 [07:11:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:11:12] just wanted to tell you more about what I was doing :) [07:11:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:11:33] I don't particularly care [07:11:33]

2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:57:21] so from 5000 lines like this: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms" I would like to extract "time=0.014" on all 5000 lines [06:57:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:57:31] cut -f4 -d' ' [06:57:31]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:58:00] of course all 5000 lines have different values in "time=x.xxx" [06:58:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:58:28] cut -f4 -d' ' [06:58:28]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:58:31] yitz: would that do? [06:58:31]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:58:43] It would select the 4th field [06:58:43]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:58:56] the file is called extract.txt and contains all 5000 lines [06:58:56]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:59:10] It would select the 4th field from each line [06:59:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:59:20] hmm let me try [06:59:20]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:59:32] Or should I repeat it yet once more? [06:59:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:59:38] no no [06:59:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:59:57] let me try becaue I am trying to understand what is consider fields... [06:59:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:00:23] this is the full line: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms" [07:00:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:00:29] not including the "" [07:00:29]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:00:29] space-delineated item [07:00:29]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:00:31] of course [07:00:31]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:00:41] So 7th field [07:00:41]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:00:50] yes [07:00:50]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:00:58] that makes more sense [07:00:58]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:01:46] from the 7th field in all 5000 lines I want to extract whatever values are in "time=x.xxx" [07:01:46]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:02:21] "1:64 2:bytes 3:from 4:127.0.0.1: 5:icmp_req=4864 6:ttl=64 7:time=0.014 ms" [07:02:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:02:25] so that 5000 lines will have just this: "time=x.xxx" with their different values [07:02:25]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:02:33] ...just try it already :P [07:02:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:02:38] OK [07:02:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:02:42] hold on please [07:02:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:04:17] How many times does one have to repeat themselves before they're listened to? [07:04:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:05:26] I am so sorry [07:05:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:06:02] I did it first with the F4 and of course was just grabbing 127.xxx then I tried with the -f7 and did the work [07:06:02]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:06:05] :) [07:06:05]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:06:21] yitz: thank you very much, that was very cool [07:06:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:06:40] yitz: I did this -> cut -f7 -d' ' ms-extract.txt > ms-extract-done.txt [07:06:40]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:07:00] the new file has the values I wanted now I can create a simple graph [07:07:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:07:17] Enjoy [07:07:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:07:24] basically I was ro have time and changes [07:07:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:07:27] understand [07:07:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:08:30] like in the axis I want to put the time [07:08:30]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:09:54] I help with sed and text parsing here, not graph generating [07:09:54]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:10:00] Try graphiv [07:10:00]

2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:11:07] But if you want the time without the "time=" try: cut -d'='  -f -1 [07:11:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:11:12] just wanted to tell you more about what I was doing :) [07:11:12]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:11:33] I don't particularly care [07:11:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:11:49] hmm I think I need the time but that is appreciated my friend [07:11:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:12:04] I will try getting the graphic done [07:12:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:12:10] Thank you so much [07:12:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:12:10] Happy to help with the text parsing [07:12:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:12:15] You're welcome [07:12:15]

2016-09-18 19:38:14	tom99	what's the benefit of knowing sed, as opposed to always using python and perl?
2016-09-18 19:38:14		[19:38]
2016-09-18 19:46:15	yitz	It's lighter and faster for simple tasks, tom99
2016-09-18 19:46:33	yitz	Why break out an editor and write 8 lines in python when a simple command can do?
2016-09-18 19:47:01	yitz	Plus it's more likely to exist on some arbitrary system
2016-09-18 19:47:09	yitz	And easier to use inside a shell script
2016-09-18 19:47:28	yitz	Appropriate tool for the task

2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:06:05] :) [07:06:05]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:06:21] yitz: thank you very much, that was very cool [07:06:21]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:06:40] yitz: I did this -> cut -f7 -d' ' ms-extract.txt > ms-extract-done.txt [07:06:40]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:07:00] the new file has the values I wanted now I can create a simple graph [07:07:00]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:07:17] Enjoy [07:07:17]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:07:24] basically I was ro have time and changes [07:07:24]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:07:27] understand [07:07:27]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:08:30] like in the axis I want to put the time [07:08:30]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:09:54] I help with sed and text parsing here, not graph generating [07:09:54]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:10:00] Try graphiv [07:10:00]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:10:04] *graphiz [07:10:04]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:10:58] :) [07:10:58]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:11:07] But if you want the time without the "time=" try: cut -d'='  -f -1 [07:11:07]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:11:12] just wanted to tell you more about what I was doing :) [07:11:12]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:11:33] I don't particularly care [07:11:33]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:11:49] hmm I think I need the time but that is appreciated my friend [07:11:49]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:12:04] I will try getting the graphic done [07:12:04]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:12:10] Thank you so much [07:12:10]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:12:10] Happy to help with the text parsing [07:12:10]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[07:12:15] You're welcome [07:12:15]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	jair	[07:12:18] ^^ [07:12:18]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	ezio	[02:08:53] i want to insert a line after "test: &TEST" in a file ... how can i find that line and then use it as an input to sed [02:08:53]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[02:48:19] ezio: /test: &TEST/  to find the line [02:48:19]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[02:48:26] The a command to append a line after it [02:48:26]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	ezio	[02:48:51] actually i found out that sed has an append feature [02:48:51]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[02:49:29] Yes. The 'a' command. To append. [02:49:29]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	ezio	[02:49:38] ah yes [02:49:38]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	ezio	[02:49:39] thanks [02:49:39]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	tom99	[05:38:14] what's the benefit of knowing sed, as opposed to always using python and perl? [05:38:14]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[05:46:15] It's lighter and faster for simple tasks, tom99 [05:46:15]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[05:46:33] Why break out an editor and write 8 lines in python when a simple command can do? [05:46:33]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[05:47:01] Plus it's more likely to exist on some arbitrary system [05:47:01]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[05:47:08] And easier to use inside a shell script [05:47:08]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[05:47:28] Appropriate tool for the task [05:47:28]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	nal	[06:01:56] why should i know anything else other than perl when perl can do everything? [06:01:56]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[06:02:36] Because sometimes you want to share your code [06:02:36]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	nal	[06:08:54] i can share perl code [06:08:54]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	yitz	[06:29:04] But can anyone else read it? [06:29:04]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	skrp	[07:10:30] is an escape character treated as one character "^@"? [07:10:30]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	skrp	[07:12:09] sed s/@/#/ "^@" ### does not produce "^#" [07:12:09]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	geirha	[07:34:54] Hm. OpenBSD's sed has gone with the silly GNU approach for -i?  http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/021?action=diff&rev1=67&rev2=68 [07:34:54]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	stevenm_	[07:45:19] hey is it possible to ask sed to match ^*  (i.e. an actual asterisk at the beginning of a line) and to move that line down to where the next \n\n is (i.e. a blank line) [07:45:19]
2016-09-19 02:43:50	stevenm_	[07:45:29] that might be a tall order [07:45:29]

2016-09-19 05:09:34	Petter	Maybe you don't have a log entry for those specific timestamps.

2016-09-19 05:35:47	waldner	ah, so you had a match somewhere else in some line

2016-09-19 05:38:28	ychaouche	but then it should stop there instead of going to EOF
2016-09-19 05:39:57	Soliton	so basically guesss whether the end range will still appear in the input or not.
2016-09-19 05:40:38	waldner	if does a full range match from a ^Sep 18 14:33:00 to a ^Sep 18 14:34:01
2016-09-19 05:40:55	waldner	then later it finds Sep 18 14:33:00 again, starts a new range, start printing
2016-09-19 05:41:18	waldner	since no further match is found for the closing Sep 18 14:34:01, prints to end of file

2016-09-20 00:39:05	 *	lockheed [09:27:33] needs to look up the difference between + and {1,} [09:27:33]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:27:40] I thought they were the same [09:27:40]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:28:07] You mean \{1,\} [09:28:07]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:28:14] yar [09:28:14]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:28:22] Sorry for my ERE [09:28:22]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:29:00] <geirha> \+ is undefined by POSIX, meaning implementations can make \+ mean whatever they want [09:29:00]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:29:00] <geirha> GNU's implementation happens to treat it the same as \{1,\} [09:29:00]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:29:28] And unescaped '+' means a literal + in BRE. [09:29:28]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:30:06] I read the grep pocket reference. I like it, short and to the point. [09:30:06]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:31:32] Less than 70 pages [09:31:32]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:32:23] Sounds nice, i'm not familiar with it. [09:32:23]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:32:34] + Plus One or more of the preceding expression [09:32:34]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:33:17] Right, in other dialects than BRE this is mostly true. [09:33:17]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:33:56] Oh right. There may be times when BRE is needed or preferred over ERE. [09:33:56]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:34:15] Right. [09:34:15]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:34:17] Less overhead? [09:34:17]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:34:48] Portability and maybe other things. [09:34:48]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:39:39] I wouldn't expect predefined character classes to be in BRE or stuff like this \w \W [09:39:39]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:39:50] One final limitation of basic grep: the “extended” regular ex- [09:39:50]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:39:52] pressions metacharacters— ? , + , { , } , | , ( , and ) —do not work [09:39:52]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:39:54] with basic grep. The functions provided by those characters [09:39:54]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:39:56] exist if you preface them with an escape. [09:39:56]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:40:15] So how is that not BRE if it only needs to be preceeded with a \ [09:40:15]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:41:42] I will just take it to mean that regex in sed and grep are much different [09:41:42]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:45:14] Petter: yes, that was the sed I was looking for. I just needed to add a space [^] becomes [^ ] [09:45:14]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:45:19] Thank you [09:45:19]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Riviera	[09:45:28] lockheed: No, just preceeding with \ does not make all of these characters "work." [09:45:28]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Riviera	[09:45:43] lockheed: grep, like sed, does not have \+, \?, \| [09:45:43]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:46:11] they both use the same regex engine likely, man 7 regex [09:46:11]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	lockheed	[09:46:28] or not [09:46:28]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Riviera	[09:46:29] Sure, but not always. [09:46:29]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:47:06] lockheed: With your grep you had the -E switch, which changes the BRE engine to ERE. [09:47:06]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:47:27] *which changes the regex engine from BRE to ERE. [09:47:27]
2016-09-20 00:39:05	Petter	[09:49:12] So, if you want to develop a pattern for sed with grep, you make it a lot easier on yourself if you use the same regex engine. [09:49:12]

2016-09-20 02:26:39	armin	so a co-worker just asked me how to print a specific range of lines from a file and i just proposed to use sed -n 100,200p in favor of head/tail. he was totally happy and told me how good that worked. interesting.
2016-09-20 02:27:09	armin	i would have thought this still major sucks.
2016-09-20 02:27:22	armin	112mb text file with a lot of lines.
2016-09-20 02:28:25	geirha	112 millibits aren't that much
2016-09-20 02:28:45	Petter	:D
2016-09-20 02:29:07	armin	that's correct, but i refuse to use the shift-key when i'm chatting when it's totally obvious what i mean when saying "emm beeh".
2016-09-20 02:30:00	geirha	joking aside, it'll likely be slightly faster if you quit at line 200

2016-09-20 05:46:55	armin	lockheed: actually i do precisely that on my custom zsh setup, which consists of a huge zshrc and a self-written prompt builder written in python.

2016-09-20 05:48:11	armin	ah, oh-my-zsh. used that for quite some time. ;)
2016-09-20 05:50:21	armin	lockheed: my implementation is just a single file though (lightweight!). the down-side is that it's slow because every time you hit the enter key it spawns a python interpreter, but hey.
2016-09-20 05:53:03	armin	lockheed: but yea what i'm missing in bsd are mainly 2 things: --group-directories-first for ls and an easier to use packet filter.
2016-09-20 05:53:33	armin	lockheed: i even run one of my notebooks with freebsd exclusively, but those 2 things are still puzzling me. :)

2016-09-21 19:06:59	Soliton	[17:01:49] you're also needlessly escaping the double quote. [17:01:49]
2016-09-21 19:06:59	Soliton	[17:05:33] that might do what you want: sed 's/href="[^"]*_files\//href="/g' [17:05:33]

2016-09-21 19:06:59	jayjo	[12:50:41] is that the "matched" operator [12:50:41]

2016-09-22 00:23:53	Mmike	[21:13:44] Hi, lads. I got a file which has, among other lines, line like this: "nonce: 1234-abcd-foo-boo-booya". Can I use sed to replace everything that's after "nonce: " with my desired string, only in a line where ^nonce: ? [21:13:44]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	Riviera	[21:29:49] Mmike: sed 's/^nonce: .*/nonce: your desired string/' [21:29:49]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	_val_	[21:35:56] # printf '%s\n' 'nonce: foo-bar' 'more nonce: and nonsence' | sed  's/\(^nonce: \).*/\1 whateveryoulike in here/g' [21:35:56]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	shbot	[21:35:58] _val_: nonce:  whateveryoulike in here [21:35:58]
2016-09-22 00:23:53	shbot	[21:35:58] _val_: more nonce: and nonsence [21:35:58]

2016-09-22 11:23:27	_geoff	basically i need to change that to be `cell1,cell2\ncell1,cell2,cell3`
2016-09-22 11:23:33	izalove	i'd google for a decent csv parser that can reformat them
2016-09-22 11:24:10	_geoff	hrm.. i thought sed would be a good choice
2016-09-22 11:24:48	_geoff	"replace any number of commas followed by a ^M with a new line"

2016-09-23 12:20:55	jayjo	[12:50:41] is that the "matched" operator [12:50:41]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	Petter	[12:52:32] You haven't tried it? [12:52:32]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	ash_workz	[17:35:00] can sed reference the last number and append perform math on it in sed -n; like sed -n '5648,last+10' ? [17:35:00]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	gnomon	[17:35:45] ash_workz, it's _technically_ possible to convince sed to perform math, but: don't. [17:35:45]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	gnomon	[17:36:08] ash_workz, here's why: http://sed.sourceforge.net/grabbag/scripts/dc.sed [17:36:08]

2016-09-23 12:20:55	Mmike	[21:13:44] Hi, lads. I got a file which has, among other lines, line like this: "nonce: 1234-abcd-foo-boo-booya". Can I use sed to replace everything that's after "nonce: " with my desired string, only in a line where ^nonce: ? [21:13:44]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	Riviera	[21:29:49] Mmike: sed 's/^nonce: .*/nonce: your desired string/' [21:29:49]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	_val_	[21:35:56] # printf '%s\n' 'nonce: foo-bar' 'more nonce: and nonsence' | sed  's/\(^nonce: \).*/\1 whateveryoulike in here/g' [21:35:56]

2016-09-23 12:20:55	shbot	[21:35:58] _val_: more nonce: and nonsence [21:35:58]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	_geoff	[21:22:36] okay so i have these "csv" files being exported from excel by someone else.  all my csvs i tested on are clean and now i have this curve ball of these shitty excel exports [21:22:36]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	_geoff	[21:23:06] they look like `     cell1,cell2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,^Mcell1,cell2,cell3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,^M   ` [21:23:06]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	_geoff	[21:23:27] basically i need to change that to be `cell1,cell2\ncell1,cell2,cell3` [21:23:27]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	izalove	[21:23:33] i'd google for a decent csv parser that can reformat them [21:23:33]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	_geoff	[21:24:10] hrm.. i thought sed would be a good choice [21:24:10]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	_geoff	[21:24:48] "replace any number of commas followed by a ^M with a new line" [21:24:48]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	_geoff	[21:26:46] my non-working attempt: sed 's/(,)+\^M/\r/g' [21:26:46]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	izalove	[21:27:54] so you just want to remove empty fields? [21:27:54]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	izalove	[21:28:01] why bother with \r at all? [21:28:01]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	izalove	[21:28:19] sed 's/,,*/,/g' [21:28:19]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	izalove	[21:29:05] ah i see you want to replace \r with \n [21:29:05]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	izalove	[21:29:16] sed 's/,,*\r/\n/g' [21:29:16]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	_geoff	[21:30:29] yes [21:30:29]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	_geoff	[21:30:36] that makes me very very happy because it works [21:30:36]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	somaReverse	[14:17:07] Hi, How can I make sed substitude string being case-aware? [14:17:07]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	somaReverse	[14:17:13] make Good ==> Bad , good ==> bad ,and  GOOD ==> BAD [14:17:13]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	Riviera	[14:18:37] Not easily, you would use a tool more suited for that task, possibly the awk scripting language. [14:18:37]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	Petter	[14:21:58] With sed you would need one substitution for each case. [14:21:58]
2016-09-23 12:20:55	somaReverse	[14:22:25] thanks [14:22:25]

2016-09-24 00:33:54	jayjo	[12:50:41] is that the "matched" operator [12:50:41]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	Petter	[12:52:32] You haven't tried it? [12:52:32]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	ash_workz	[17:35:00] can sed reference the last number and append perform math on it in sed -n; like sed -n '5648,last+10' ? [17:35:00]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	gnomon	[17:35:45] ash_workz, it's _technically_ possible to convince sed to perform math, but: don't. [17:35:45]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	gnomon	[17:36:08] ash_workz, here's why: http://sed.sourceforge.net/grabbag/scripts/dc.sed [17:36:08]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	gnomon	[17:36:49] ash_workz, related to that same piece of code, see also http://sed.sourceforge.net/grabbag/scripts/dc_intro.txt and http://sed.sourceforge.net/grabbag/scripts/dc_overview.htm , via http://sed.sourceforge.net/grabbag/scripts/ [17:36:49]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	Mmike	[21:13:44] Hi, lads. I got a file which has, among other lines, line like this: "nonce: 1234-abcd-foo-boo-booya". Can I use sed to replace everything that's after "nonce: " with my desired string, only in a line where ^nonce: ? [21:13:44]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	Riviera	[21:29:49] Mmike: sed 's/^nonce: .*/nonce: your desired string/' [21:29:49]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	_val_	[21:35:56] # printf '%s\n' 'nonce: foo-bar' 'more nonce: and nonsence' | sed  's/\(^nonce: \).*/\1 whateveryoulike in here/g' [21:35:56]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	shbot	[21:35:58] _val_: nonce:  whateveryoulike in here [21:35:58]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	shbot	[21:35:58] _val_: more nonce: and nonsence [21:35:58]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	_geoff	[21:22:36] okay so i have these "csv" files being exported from excel by someone else.  all my csvs i tested on are clean and now i have this curve ball of these shitty excel exports [21:22:36]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	_geoff	[21:23:06] they look like `     cell1,cell2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,^Mcell1,cell2,cell3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,^M   ` [21:23:06]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	_geoff	[21:23:27] basically i need to change that to be `cell1,cell2\ncell1,cell2,cell3` [21:23:27]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	izalove	[21:23:33] i'd google for a decent csv parser that can reformat them [21:23:33]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	_geoff	[21:24:10] hrm.. i thought sed would be a good choice [21:24:10]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	_geoff	[21:24:48] "replace any number of commas followed by a ^M with a new line" [21:24:48]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	_geoff	[21:26:46] my non-working attempt: sed 's/(,)+\^M/\r/g' [21:26:46]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	izalove	[21:27:54] so you just want to remove empty fields? [21:27:54]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	izalove	[21:28:01] why bother with \r at all? [21:28:01]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	izalove	[21:28:19] sed 's/,,*/,/g' [21:28:19]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	izalove	[21:29:05] ah i see you want to replace \r with \n [21:29:05]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	izalove	[21:29:16] sed 's/,,*\r/\n/g' [21:29:16]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	_geoff	[21:30:29] yes [21:30:29]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	_geoff	[21:30:36] that makes me very very happy because it works [21:30:36]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	somaReverse	[14:17:07] Hi, How can I make sed substitude string being case-aware? [14:17:07]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	somaReverse	[14:17:13] make Good ==> Bad , good ==> bad ,and  GOOD ==> BAD [14:17:13]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	Riviera	[14:18:37] Not easily, you would use a tool more suited for that task, possibly the awk scripting language. [14:18:37]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	Petter	[14:21:58] With sed you would need one substitution for each case. [14:21:58]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	somaReverse	[14:22:25] thanks [14:22:25]
2016-09-24 00:33:54	Petter	[14:24:13] # printf '%s\n' 'Good, good, GOOD' | sed 's/Good/Bad/g; s/good/bad/g; s/GOOD/BAD/g;' [14:24:13]

2016-09-24 14:07:05	tachoknight_	Hi all. Is it possible to use sed to do a find/replace limited to the word being at the beginning of a line?
2016-09-24 14:07:34	tachoknight_	i.e. I want to replace "foo" with "bar" only if "foo" is at the beginning of the line; if it's "blah-foo" i want to leave it alone
2016-09-24 14:09:45	izalove	s/^foo/bar/
2016-09-24 14:11:02	tachoknight_	absolutely perfect, thanks izalove
2016-09-24 14:11:40	tachoknight_	so i understand, what is ^ doing?
2016-09-24 14:11:49	tachoknight_	forcing it to have nothing to the left?
2016-09-24 14:12:46	izalove	^ matches the beginning of the string

2016-09-25 21:48:34	izalove	regex is greedy
2016-09-25 21:49:00	izalove	try with [[:xdigit:]]+
2016-09-25 21:49:00	tsak	hmm, that's the problem maybe eh
2016-09-25 21:49:24	tsak	wait a moment I have another case
2016-09-25 21:49:44	tsak	echo -e '&#x2019\n&#x2019;' | sed -r 's/\&\#x([[:print:]]+);?/\\u\1/g'
2016-09-25 21:49:44	tsak	\u2019
2016-09-25 21:49:44	tsak	\u2019;
2016-09-25 21:50:08	izalove	what about it?
2016-09-25 21:50:20	tsak	You must be right, regex is greedy but on this case ; stays there
2016-09-25 21:50:24	tsak	shouldn't be deleted?
2016-09-25 21:50:40	izalove	no because ; is printable
2016-09-25 21:51:07	tsak	sed -r 's/\&\#x(.+);?/\\u\1/g'
2016-09-25 21:51:12	tsak	happens with that regex too
2016-09-25 21:51:20	izalove	because ; is matched by .
2016-09-25 21:51:53	tsak	but I have ';' next to it
2016-09-25 21:52:04	tsak	it should match that ; instead, no?
2016-09-25 21:52:14	tsak	hmm
2016-09-25 21:52:24	tsak	well, I have ;? ok
2016-09-25 21:52:28	tsak	xD
2016-09-25 21:52:29	izalove	i don't know how to explain it more clearly
2016-09-25 21:52:44	izalove	.+ matches ; and ;? matches an empty string
2016-09-25 21:52:46	tsak	ok ok, you are right
2016-09-25 21:53:40	tsak	echo -e '&#x2019\n&#x2019;' | sed -r 's/\&\#x([^;]+);?/\\u\1/g'
2016-09-25 21:53:40	tsak	\u2019
2016-09-25 21:53:40	tsak	\u2019
2016-09-25 21:54:11	tsak	I don't know if this regex is ok, looks ok to me, thanks man :)
2016-09-25 21:54:29	izalove	looks ok
2016-09-25 21:58:02	tsak	can't get it to work on one line though
2016-09-25 21:58:17	izalove	[[:xdigit:]]
2016-09-25 21:58:34	tsak	this matches A-F also?
2016-09-25 21:58:39	tsak	well, that's nice
2016-09-25 21:58:42	tsak	thanks again :)
2016-09-25 21:59:37	tsak	it works great, thanks!

2016-09-26 00:32:52	tsak	hmm, sed -r '/title|link/!d' seems to work, is that right?
2016-09-26 00:32:52		[00:32]
2016-09-26 00:33:03	tsak	I mean /..../ takes any valid regex?
2016-09-26 00:34:35	waldner	what "valid" means depends on how you're running sed
2016-09-26 00:34:50	waldner	with -r, "valid" means ERE (extended regular expression)
2016-09-26 00:34:55	tsak	yeap
2016-09-26 00:35:07	tsak	I think | is only valid in ERE
2016-09-26 00:35:11	waldner	by default, "valid" means BRE (basic)
2016-09-26 00:35:20	tsak	ah, ok
2016-09-26 00:35:31	waldner	correct, although sed added | to BREs (as \| ) as an extension
2016-09-26 00:35:39	waldner	s/sed/GNU sed/
2016-09-26 00:35:41	tsak	yeah, I know that too
2016-09-26 00:36:42	tsak	but I guess I can't do    /title/!d;/link/!d    right?
2016-09-26 00:36:53	waldner	why not? that's ok
2016-09-26 00:37:14	tsak	hm, I thought it would print only titles in that case
2016-09-26 00:38:23	tsak	hm, does not print anything at all, I don't know if I get something wrong
2016-09-26 00:41:16	Riviera	That will print lines that contain both title and link.
2016-09-26 00:42:49	tsak	it does not print anything
2016-09-26 00:42:52	tsak	just an empty line
2016-09-26 00:43:06	tsak	/title/!d;/link/!d   <--- this one
2016-09-26 00:43:21	tsak	but /title|link/!d works great
2016-09-26 00:43:47	tsak	I don't want the first one, but I'm curious why it doesn't work
2016-09-26 00:43:50	tsak	that's all
2016-09-26 00:46:24	tsak	maybe I'm right that title strings is everything left on the buffer and /link/ doesn't match anything at all?
2016-09-26 00:46:36	tsak	but it doesn't even print title lol
2016-09-26 00:47:46	tsak	anyway I've got my script extremely fast (avoided a while loop by doing everything in sed) and I'm glad about that :D
2016-09-26 00:48:43	Riviera	/title/!d;/link/!d prints lines that contain *both* "title" *and* "link".
2016-09-26 00:48:43		[00:48]
2016-09-26 00:50:01	tsak	but it does not print anything.. I don't know if something else in the chain causes that but at the same position /title|link/!d works wonderfully
2016-09-26 00:50:40	Riviera	Likely because you simply do not have such lines.
2016-09-26 00:54:14	tsak	what you mean I don't have such lines?
2016-09-26 00:54:28	tsak	I said /title|link/!d works
2016-09-26 00:54:30	Riviera	That contain "title" as well as "link".
2016-09-26 00:54:36	tsak	hm?
2016-09-26 00:54:43	olspookishmagus	some help on converting this to an equivalent sed regex (to be passed in a BASH oneliner): s/.*foobar = '(.*?)'.*/$1/
2016-09-26 00:54:48	olspookishmagus	I tried with: s/.*koko\ =\ '(.*?)'.*/$1/ but to no avail
2016-09-26 00:54:52	Riviera	tsak: What exactly is not clear about the statement?
2016-09-26 00:55:16	Riviera	olspookishmagus: Mind explaining the goal in English instead?
2016-09-26 00:55:35	tsak	well, title and link are not at the same link that's what /title/!d;/link/!d does?
2016-09-26 00:55:46	Riviera	tsak: I believe you have a mistake in your sentence?
2016-09-26 00:56:10	tsak	same line sorry
2016-09-26 00:56:10	olspookishmagus	I'm getting a value from a grepped line from curl and I want just that value
2016-09-26 00:56:21	olspookishmagus	it's something like koko = '7948xm74982m7298x47921'
2016-09-26 00:56:35	Riviera	tsak: So see, and the /title/!d;/link/!d discards all lines that do not have "title" and "link" on the same line,
2016-09-26 00:56:50	Riviera	tsak: so it will print all lines that do have both these strings on the same line.
2016-09-26 00:56:52	olspookishmagus	So I'm trying with curl -s http://foo.bar | grep koko | sed 's/s/.*koko\ =\ '(.*?)'.*/$1/'
2016-09-26 00:56:59	Riviera	tsak: So if you do not have any such lines it will not print anything.
2016-09-26 00:57:02	olspookishmagus	but it won't work
2016-09-26 00:57:29	olspookishmagus	I don't know why, should I escape the spaces? should I take care for the single quotes?
2016-09-26 00:57:44	Riviera	olspookishmagus: sed 's/.*koko = '\''[^'\'']*'\''.*/\1/'

2016-09-26 00:59:15	Riviera	tsak: /title|link/!d will, instead, print all lines that contain either "title" or "link" or both.
2016-09-26 00:59:40	Riviera	tsak: Portable the script sed '/title/b;/link/!d' # should do the same
2016-09-26 00:59:45	Riviera	portably*
2016-09-26 01:00:43	tsak	ok, this is good, but the one with two delete commands does not, that's right?
2016-09-26 01:01:06	Riviera	olspookishmagus: This is probably a little more pleasing to read:  sed "s/.*koko = '\\([^']*\\)'.*/\\1/"

2016-09-26 01:02:24	waldner	tsak: it helps if you turn the commands using positives
2016-09-26 01:02:35	waldner	one becomes: sed -r '/title|link/p'
2016-09-26 01:02:47	waldner	the other: sed -r '/title/p; /link/p'
2016-09-26 01:03:01	waldner	no, ignore what I just said
2016-09-26 01:03:10	waldner	need a coffee
2016-09-26 01:03:24	waldner	but they are different, what Riviera said is correct

2016-09-26 01:04:02		[01:04]
2016-09-26 01:04:03	shbot	Riviera: cookie-bar
2016-09-26 01:04:12	tsak	No, I'm asking if /pattern1/!d;/pattern2/!d just deletes everything except pattern1... this is to understand what it does excactly, I don't need the correct way of doing it
2016-09-26 01:04:50	waldner	it deletes lines that do NOT have pattern1. If there's a line with pattern1, it's deleted if it does NOT have pattern2.
2016-09-26 01:05:04	waldner	if a line has both pattern1 AND pattern2, it's printed.
2016-09-26 01:05:35	waldner	so your statement that it deletes everything except pattern1 is not entirely correct.
2016-09-26 01:05:51	tsak	hm, ok, that's what I was looking for

2016-09-26 21:42:09	olspookishmagus	[10:56:51] So I'm trying with curl -s http://foo.bar | grep koko | sed 's/s/.*koko\ =\ '(.*?)'.*/$1/' [10:56:51]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[10:56:58] tsak: So if you do not have any such lines it will not print anything. [10:56:58]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	olspookishmagus	[10:57:02] but it won't work [10:57:02]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	olspookishmagus	[10:57:28] I don't know why, should I escape the spaces? should I take care for the single quotes? [10:57:28]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[10:57:43] olspookishmagus: sed 's/.*koko = '\''[^'\'']*'\''.*/\1/' [10:57:43]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[10:57:52] olspookishmagus: You should not wildly guess, that's for certain [10:57:52]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[10:58:06] # echo blah koko = 'test' jhfkjhsdf | sed 's/.*koko = '\''[^'\'']*'\''.*/\1/' [10:58:06]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	shbot	[10:58:07] Riviera: sed: -e expression #1, char 24: invalid reference \1 on `s' command's RHS [10:58:07]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[10:58:11] sad. [10:58:11]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[10:58:33] # echo "blah koko = 'test' jhfkjhsdf" | sed 's/.*koko = '\''\([^'\'']*\)'\''.*/\1/' [10:58:33]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	shbot	[10:58:34] Riviera: test [10:58:34]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[10:58:41] olspookishmagus: sed 's/.*koko = '\''\([^'\'']*\)'\''.*/\1/' [10:58:41]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[10:59:14] tsak: /title|link/!d will, instead, print all lines that contain either "title" or "link" or both. [10:59:14]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[10:59:39] tsak: Portable the script sed '/title/b;/link/!d' # should do the same [10:59:39]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[10:59:45] portably* [10:59:45]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	tsak	[11:00:42] ok, this is good, but the one with two delete commands does not, that's right? [11:00:42]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[11:01:05] olspookishmagus: This is probably a little more pleasing to read:  sed "s/.*koko = '\\([^']*\\)'.*/\\1/" [11:01:05]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[11:01:23] tsak: Language barrier. [11:01:23]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	waldner	[11:02:23] tsak: it helps if you turn the commands using positives [11:02:23]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	waldner	[11:02:34] one becomes: sed -r '/title|link/p' [11:02:34]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	waldner	[11:02:46] the other: sed -r '/title/p; /link/p' [11:02:46]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	waldner	[11:03:00] no, ignore what I just said [11:03:00]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	waldner	[11:03:09] need a coffee [11:03:09]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	waldner	[11:03:23] but they are different, what Riviera said is correct [11:03:23]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[11:04:01] # sed -nescafe-cookie-cp <<< cafe-bar [11:04:01]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	shbot	[11:04:02] Riviera: cookie-bar [11:04:02]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	tsak	[11:04:11] No, I'm asking if /pattern1/!d;/pattern2/!d just deletes everything except pattern1... this is to understand what it does excactly, I don't need the correct way of doing it [11:04:11]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	waldner	[11:04:49] it deletes lines that do NOT have pattern1. If there's a line with pattern1, it's deleted if it does NOT have pattern2. [11:04:49]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	waldner	[11:05:03] if a line has both pattern1 AND pattern2, it's printed. [11:05:03]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	waldner	[11:05:35] so your statement that it deletes everything except pattern1 is not entirely correct. [11:05:35]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	tsak	[11:05:50] hm, ok, that's what I was looking for [11:05:50]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	tsak	[11:05:59] thanks for your time [11:05:59]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	olspookishmagus	[11:07:11] now what just happened there? please feed me with some theory [11:07:11]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	Riviera	[11:08:13] Please clarify what exactly needs clarification. [11:08:13]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	olspookishmagus	[11:14:39] Riviera: there is no greedy/ungreedy switch in sed? [11:14:39]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	olspookishmagus	[11:14:54] Riviera: there is no greedy/ungreedy switch in POSIX regex? [11:14:54]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	geirha	[11:19:33] correct [11:19:33]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	geirha	[11:19:40] always greedy [11:19:40]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	olspookishmagus	[11:20:53] thanks geirha, Riviera :D [11:20:53]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	BoBeR182	[01:16:44] Hello I have a file that is in the format of XXXXX:$$$:XXXXX [01:16:44]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	BoBeR182	[01:16:50] where X can be alpha numberic [01:16:50]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	BoBeR182	[01:16:56] but $$$ can be symbols too [01:16:56]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	BoBeR182	[01:17:17] so there is a risk of XXXXX:Y:Y:XXXXXX [01:17:17]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	BoBeR182	[01:17:30] How do I change the last : one each line to a tab [01:17:30]
2016-09-26 21:42:09	BoBeR182	[01:17:36] so I can get a tab delimited file [01:17:36]
