2016-09-17 20:54:53	jair	hello everyone
2016-09-17 20:55:27	jair	I am trying to accomplish this:
2016-09-17 20:55:51	jair	I am working on debian doing some ping test in the local server, and would like to create a graphic, but to do that I will need to select just "time=0.014" from the full line like 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms but 5000 lines
2016-09-17 20:57:07	yitz	cut -f4 -d' '
2016-09-17 20:57:21	jair	so from 5000 lines like this: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms" I would like to extract "time=0.014" on all 5000 lines
2016-09-17 20:57:31	yitz	cut -f4 -d' '
2016-09-17 20:58:00	jair	of course all 5000 lines have different values in "time=x.xxx"
2016-09-17 20:58:28	yitz	cut -f4 -d' '
2016-09-17 20:58:31	jair	yitz: would that do?
2016-09-17 20:58:43	yitz	It would select the 4th field
2016-09-17 20:58:56	jair	the file is called extract.txt and contains all 5000 lines
2016-09-17 20:59:10	yitz	It would select the 4th field from each line
2016-09-17 20:59:20	jair	hmm let me try
2016-09-17 20:59:32	yitz	Or should I repeat it yet once more?
2016-09-17 20:59:38	jair	no no
2016-09-17 20:59:57	jair	let me try becaue I am trying to understand what is consider fields...
2016-09-17 21:00:23	jair	this is the full line: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms"
2016-09-17 21:00:29	jair	not including the ""
2016-09-17 21:00:29	yitz	space-delineated item
2016-09-17 21:00:31	jair	of course
2016-09-17 21:00:41	yitz	So 7th field
2016-09-17 21:00:50	jair	yes
2016-09-17 21:00:58	jair	that makes more sense
2016-09-17 21:01:46	jair	from the 7th field in all 5000 lines I want to extract whatever values are in "time=x.xxx"
2016-09-17 21:02:21	yitz	"1:64 2:bytes 3:from 4:127.0.0.1: 5:icmp_req=4864 6:ttl=64 7:time=0.014 ms"
2016-09-17 21:02:25	jair	so that 5000 lines will have just this: "time=x.xxx" with their different values
2016-09-17 21:02:33	yitz	...just try it already :P
2016-09-17 21:02:38	jair	OK
2016-09-17 21:02:42	jair	hold on please
2016-09-17 21:04:17	yitz	How many times does one have to repeat themselves before they're listened to?
2016-09-17 21:05:27	jair	I am so sorry
2016-09-17 21:06:02	jair	I did it first with the F4 and of course was just grabbing 127.xxx then I tried with the -f7 and did the work
2016-09-17 21:06:05	jair	:)
2016-09-17 21:06:21	jair	yitz: thank you very much, that was very cool
2016-09-17 21:06:40	jair	yitz: I did this -> cut -f7 -d' ' ms-extract.txt > ms-extract-done.txt
2016-09-17 21:07:00	jair	the new file has the values I wanted now I can create a simple graph
2016-09-17 21:07:17	yitz	Enjoy
2016-09-17 21:07:24	jair	basically I was ro have time and changes
2016-09-17 21:07:27	jair	understand
2016-09-17 21:08:30	jair	like in the axis I want to put the time
2016-09-17 21:09:54	yitz	I help with sed and text parsing here, not graph generating
2016-09-17 21:09:54		[21:09]
2016-09-17 21:10:00	yitz	Try graphiv
2016-09-17 21:10:04	yitz	*graphiz
2016-09-17 21:10:58	jair	:)
2016-09-17 21:11:07	yitz	But if you want the time without the "time=" try: cut -d'='  -f -1
2016-09-17 21:11:12	jair	just wanted to tell you more about what I was doing :)
2016-09-17 21:11:33	yitz	I don't particularly care
2016-09-17 21:11:49	jair	hmm I think I need the time but that is appreciated my friend
2016-09-17 21:12:04	jair	I will try getting the graphic done
2016-09-17 21:12:10	jair	Thank you so much
2016-09-17 21:12:10	yitz	Happy to help with the text parsing
2016-09-17 21:12:15	yitz	You're welcome
2016-09-17 21:12:18	jair	^^

2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:57:21] so from 5000 lines like this: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms" I would like to extract "time=0.014" on all 5000 lines [06:57:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[06:57:31] cut -f4 -d' ' [06:57:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:58:00] of course all 5000 lines have different values in "time=x.xxx" [06:58:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[06:58:28] cut -f4 -d' ' [06:58:28]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:58:31] yitz: would that do? [06:58:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[06:58:43] It would select the 4th field [06:58:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:58:56] the file is called extract.txt and contains all 5000 lines [06:58:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[06:59:10] It would select the 4th field from each line [06:59:10]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:59:20] hmm let me try [06:59:20]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[06:59:32] Or should I repeat it yet once more? [06:59:32]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:59:38] no no [06:59:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[06:59:57] let me try becaue I am trying to understand what is consider fields... [06:59:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:00:23] this is the full line: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms" [07:00:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:00:29] not including the "" [07:00:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:00:29] space-delineated item [07:00:29]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:00:31] of course [07:00:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:00:41] So 7th field [07:00:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:00:50] yes [07:00:50]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:00:58] that makes more sense [07:00:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:01:46] from the 7th field in all 5000 lines I want to extract whatever values are in "time=x.xxx" [07:01:46]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:02:21] "1:64 2:bytes 3:from 4:127.0.0.1: 5:icmp_req=4864 6:ttl=64 7:time=0.014 ms" [07:02:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:02:25] so that 5000 lines will have just this: "time=x.xxx" with their different values [07:02:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:02:33] ...just try it already :P [07:02:33]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:02:38] OK [07:02:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:02:42] hold on please [07:02:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:04:17] How many times does one have to repeat themselves before they're listened to? [07:04:17]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:05:26] I am so sorry [07:05:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:06:02] I did it first with the F4 and of course was just grabbing 127.xxx then I tried with the -f7 and did the work [07:06:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:06:05] :) [07:06:05]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:06:21] yitz: thank you very much, that was very cool [07:06:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:06:40] yitz: I did this -> cut -f7 -d' ' ms-extract.txt > ms-extract-done.txt [07:06:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:07:00] the new file has the values I wanted now I can create a simple graph [07:07:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:07:17] Enjoy [07:07:17]

2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:11:07] But if you want the time without the "time=" try: cut -d'='  -f -1 [07:11:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	jair	[07:11:12] just wanted to tell you more about what I was doing :) [07:11:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:49	yitz	[07:11:33] I don't particularly care [07:11:33]

2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:57:07] cut -f4 -d' ' [06:57:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:57:21] so from 5000 lines like this: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms" I would like to extract "time=0.014" on all 5000 lines [06:57:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:57:31] cut -f4 -d' ' [06:57:31]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:58:00] of course all 5000 lines have different values in "time=x.xxx" [06:58:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:58:28] cut -f4 -d' ' [06:58:28]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:58:31] yitz: would that do? [06:58:31]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:58:43] It would select the 4th field [06:58:43]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:58:56] the file is called extract.txt and contains all 5000 lines [06:58:56]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:59:10] It would select the 4th field from each line [06:59:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:59:20] hmm let me try [06:59:20]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[06:59:32] Or should I repeat it yet once more? [06:59:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:59:38] no no [06:59:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[06:59:57] let me try becaue I am trying to understand what is consider fields... [06:59:57]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:00:23] this is the full line: "64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_req=4864 ttl=64 time=0.014 ms" [07:00:23]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:00:29] not including the "" [07:00:29]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:00:29] space-delineated item [07:00:29]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:00:31] of course [07:00:31]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:00:41] So 7th field [07:00:41]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:00:50] yes [07:00:50]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:00:58] that makes more sense [07:00:58]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:01:46] from the 7th field in all 5000 lines I want to extract whatever values are in "time=x.xxx" [07:01:46]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:02:21] "1:64 2:bytes 3:from 4:127.0.0.1: 5:icmp_req=4864 6:ttl=64 7:time=0.014 ms" [07:02:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:02:25] so that 5000 lines will have just this: "time=x.xxx" with their different values [07:02:25]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:02:33] ...just try it already :P [07:02:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:02:38] OK [07:02:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:02:42] hold on please [07:02:42]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:04:17] How many times does one have to repeat themselves before they're listened to? [07:04:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:05:26] I am so sorry [07:05:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:06:02] I did it first with the F4 and of course was just grabbing 127.xxx then I tried with the -f7 and did the work [07:06:02]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:06:05] :) [07:06:05]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:06:21] yitz: thank you very much, that was very cool [07:06:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:06:40] yitz: I did this -> cut -f7 -d' ' ms-extract.txt > ms-extract-done.txt [07:06:40]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:07:00] the new file has the values I wanted now I can create a simple graph [07:07:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:07:17] Enjoy [07:07:17]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:07:24] basically I was ro have time and changes [07:07:24]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:07:27] understand [07:07:27]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:08:30] like in the axis I want to put the time [07:08:30]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:09:54] I help with sed and text parsing here, not graph generating [07:09:54]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:10:00] Try graphiv [07:10:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:10:04] *graphiz [07:10:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:10:58] :) [07:10:58]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:11:07] But if you want the time without the "time=" try: cut -d'='  -f -1 [07:11:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:11:12] just wanted to tell you more about what I was doing :) [07:11:12]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:11:33] I don't particularly care [07:11:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:11:49] hmm I think I need the time but that is appreciated my friend [07:11:49]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:12:04] I will try getting the graphic done [07:12:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:12:10] Thank you so much [07:12:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:12:10] Happy to help with the text parsing [07:12:10]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	yitz	[07:12:15] You're welcome [07:12:15]
2016-09-18 13:24:35	jair	[07:12:18] ^^ [07:12:18]
