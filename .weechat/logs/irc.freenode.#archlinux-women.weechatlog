2016-09-10 15:16:08	halosghost	as in, their name

2016-09-10 15:21:01	halosghost	Peng: the notion is not so far-fetched
2016-09-10 15:21:09	halosghost	though, in my opinion, I do not thing it applies here
2016-09-10 15:21:24	tokage	halosghost: /whois dolores is very offensive
2016-09-10 15:21:28	tokage	Peng: wat
2016-09-10 15:22:26	halosghost	tokage: “loli” is not inherently offensive as I said before; is there something else there you find very offensive?

2016-09-10 16:27:54	@meskarune	he took computer parts, disovled the gold into acid, then added a checmical to make it solidify into a mix of gold/lead, and then melted it and the lead leaches otu and you are left with pure gold
2016-09-10 16:28:49	halosghost	and then he fashioned little gold armor for his bees?

2016-09-11 10:48:58	halosghost	you can help organize during meetings, offer to teach classes, donate to the site for maintenance, offer to mentor
2016-09-11 10:49:02	halosghost	many things! :D

2016-09-11 10:59:14	ripe	i'll write a second part for installing a graphical interface, etc
2016-09-11 10:59:23	@fsckd	cool

2016-09-11 11:00:00	@fsckd	thank you, as are you :)
2016-09-11 11:00:27	@fsckd	most of the aw tasks i'm working on for aw require special knowledge or privileged access. so it is hard to just ask people to pick them up.
2016-09-11 11:00:41	@fsckd	the meeting stuff can be done by others though
2016-09-11 11:01:07	@fsckd	there are just five possible things for the meeting
2016-09-11 11:02:47	@fsckd	(1) create an agenda for a new meeting (2) help run a meeting (just keeping notes during a meeting is good enough (3) post meetings notes to the git repo (4) post logs to the git repo (5) update wiki after meeting is over
2016-09-11 11:02:47		[11:02]
2016-09-11 11:03:06	@fsckd	people can help with one of those five things
2016-09-11 11:03:32	@fsckd	we eventually want to automate 3 and 4 and may be parts of 2 eventually
2016-09-11 11:04:36	@fsckd	(someone can work with us and give specific directions for accomplishing automation, if anyone would like to volunteer on that)
2016-09-11 11:04:49	ripe	sure i can do 2,3,4
2016-09-11 11:05:10	@fsckd	thanks, that would be really great :)
2016-09-11 11:05:14	ripe	i hope to join next one if i'll have access internet

2016-09-12 11:59:01	+tigrmesh	people are starting to trust me and give me ssh access to their servers.  and i want to set my machine up as carefully as possible to not abuse that trust
2016-09-12 12:00:02	+tigrmesh	so the new (to me) laptop has a couple of things going on.  on is that arch will be dual booting with windows 10
2016-09-12 12:00:56	+tigrmesh	and the other is that it's going to be online, with irc, with whatever junk links people post in other arch channels, 24/7

2016-09-15 06:49:57	turbo64	i actually met someone like this irl when i took a network security class in college
2016-09-15 06:50:22	turbo64	he had a my little pony wallpaper on his laptop

2016-09-15 06:52:59	ng0	or ride the subway. i've had people in my class like this too.. more or less one of the reasons why I connected more with the 'outsiders'/less toxic people

2016-09-15 07:02:13	turbo64	i was unindoctrinated from all my christian conservative values when i left home and fell into the whole punk rock counterculture, eating acid and smoking pot with feminists and gays and transvestites
2016-09-15 07:02:38	turbo64	i guess the young gamers these days don't experience that kind of epiphany
2016-09-15 07:06:10	ng0	i never experienced any 'epiphany' in any sub culture. there's a small minority of questioning and friendly people (in $subculture), the rest is just a 1:1 reflection of what they call "mainstream" (the usual hate, alienation, unreflected, etc talks/behavior)
2016-09-15 07:08:27	turbo64	most of the racism/bigotry/etc. i see around me doesn't seem to come from hate but just ignorance

2016-09-15 07:12:00	turbo64	yeah but it wasn't really about the subculture, it was just being around people who rejected everything i was taught that was fascinating to me when i was younger and more impressionable
2016-09-15 07:13:12	turbo64	and getting to know the people who are sort of outcasts and learning about the shit they have to deal with
2016-09-15 07:14:12	ng0	like some of my real close friends I have now who grew up in villages in the region around me, I had either the choice to make no social interaction at all or to hang out with a larger group of people who believed they had no place (for some time) in the place they live(d) in.
2016-09-15 07:16:38	turbo64	where do you live
2016-09-15 07:16:51	ng0	last crust festival i was at, i talked to some people about jobs and such, and how joining the army is very illogical and maybe there's a short term benefit for them but the longterm risks and contradictions outweight the benefits.. typical conversations/thought models i encountered. i could rant on in writing a book
2016-09-15 07:17:11	ng0	internationally it is translated as ruhr area

2016-09-15 07:20:16	ng0	well i did not grow up in ruhrgebiet.. i grew up in some village in münsterland, close to the larger area of ruhrgebiet. at least i escaped a bit of that mindset 30 km away.
2016-09-15 07:20:46	turbo64	munsterland, sounds spooky

2016-09-15 11:32:43	halosghost	elky: it will cause the species to not be present
2016-09-15 11:32:50	halosghost	other effects? yeah, beyond me
2016-09-15 11:32:55	halosghost	but I'm pretty focused on the immediate one :)
2016-09-15 11:33:25	halosghost	alternatively, if y'all don't want me to get rid of the tiny vampires, can you supply me with tiny wearwolves to eat them?
