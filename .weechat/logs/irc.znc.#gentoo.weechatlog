2016-09-15 20:20:12	Triffid_Hunter	screen/tmux are great for that, just go to new tab and all the make spam is hidden on the server end, but you can still scroll back through it if something goes awry
2016-09-15 20:20:13	modded	hey my old ISP's help desk didn't understand why anyone needed more than 5mb/s up/down

2016-09-16 03:50:38	Vaska	Happy Friday! - I'm having trouble with X on a new install.  TWM starts with a few xterms but when I run nvidia-settings, the fonts are unreadable squiggles and the resolution is 800x480 despite being connected to a 1080P TV with HDMI.
2016-09-16 03:50:47	+grknight	Neptu: if you are not redistributing binaries, you can simply take out bindist from make.conf;  openssh and openssl must have the same value for bindist; so when a package needs openssl to switch it off, portage gets confused because openssh wanted the on value

2016-09-16 04:40:06	tirej	so, i wan to ask a few questions? does gentoo has gpu problems like arch ?(because i am having problem with that)
2016-09-16 04:41:16	maolang	what type of problem are you talking about, can you elaborate the details a lil bit..
2016-09-16 04:41:20	tirej	the second question is, does gentoo has booting problem with efi installation (i barely could install arch with efi partition on my laptop and boot it )
2016-09-16 04:42:02	+grknight	tirej: our minimal ISO is not UEFI ready so an extra step is needed, but beyond that, UEFI isn't difficult
2016-09-16 04:42:11	maolang	if you want to install with EFI, get yourself a ubuntu live boot based off the 16.04 and run the full  install of gentoo though it, ubuntu live boots correctly for UEFI
2016-09-16 04:42:15	tirej	maolang: e.g. i could not open fkn desktop with arch
2016-09-16 04:42:56	+grknight	tirej: i recommend sysrescuecd or the Gentoo LiveDVD for install on UEFI to save headaches

2016-09-16 08:48:42	maolang	bad memory is sometimes hard to corner, it could work without problem until the right stress starts causing issues...
2016-09-16 08:48:47	+grknight	c163r: you don't normally need revdep-rebuild these days unless something specific requires it
2016-09-16 08:48:49	+iamben	"some weird dirs appeared" is not enough

2016-09-16 10:57:41	mackal	so I used to be able to have virtual/linux-sources not be in my world file which allowed me to upgrade my kernel when I had the time to, but now for some reason I have to which means I can't delay the kernel upgrade until I have time, did I miss a change some where?
2016-09-16 10:58:44	infirit	yes nabblet, iamben is right, there is a daemon and a agent, the agent is normally auto started by your session (xfce, gnome etc)
2016-09-16 10:58:46	+iamben	mackal: it's possible that you have some package depending on virtual/linux-sources, so it's pulled into the dep graph on world upgrade.  i'd just mask newer sources if you dont want them upgraded

2016-09-16 20:26:36	wuseman	Chromedesktop is possible if you using chromebook but its way to laggy. Remmina is the best choice if the target server using rdp or vnc.
2016-09-16 20:27:02	maolang	and running this way you do unmerge TV completely and run it in place from a folder in your home folder just fine
2016-09-16 20:27:43	space-xpc	never run rdp or vnc over internet
2016-09-16 20:27:52	wuseman	I do not like licensed programs and when it is this buggy as it seems i do like it even less. Simple as that space-xpc

2016-09-17 01:21:14	maolang	if you are GPT partitioned as i said ealier, thats something else, either as wokko suggested, or you create a small new virtual HD like 200mb partitioned table DOS, one partition for the whole drive, and that would be your /boot which you boot BIOS and not EFI
2016-09-17 01:21:23	exxi	maolang, this one is a bran new just tarball extracted
2016-09-17 01:21:40	maolang	if so then i would kill it and get it DOS

2016-09-17 01:23:51	maolang	dont forget to put the boot flag on the /sda1 partition for your /boot
2016-09-17 01:24:36	grawity	BIOS can boot from GPT disks; they have a "protective MBR" which can still hold bootcode

2016-09-17 01:27:35	grawity	it can be anywhere technically (well, I think within the first 2 TB)
2016-09-17 01:27:49	grawity	with pure MBR, grub hides itself in the empty area
2016-09-17 01:28:03	grawity	with GPT, well, the GPT already occupies that area, so you give grub a partition
2016-09-17 01:28:05	maolang	probably better to have it at a defined known location than somwhere on drive at position x..

2016-09-17 01:32:54	grawity	I think you're supposed to install it on sda, not sda1?

2016-09-17 01:36:17	maolang	technically on a USB key, you could have a normal GPT tabled HD, that 2mb partition and a fat32 partition so that USB live creation could be mbr booted and as well efi booted
2016-09-17 01:36:30	grawity	yes
2016-09-17 01:37:15	maolang	well i will play with it on usb, where its a bit less system invasive... :)
2016-09-17 01:37:23	grawity	for comparison, syslinux's gptmbr.bin works similarly, but embeds itself directly into /boot (with no intermediate stage), and expects /boot to have a special attribute bit ("legacy_boot" in parted)

2016-09-17 11:04:56	+kent\n	[20:52:27] are you using lua for anything specific? [20:52:27]
2016-09-17 11:04:56	+kent\n	[20:52:37] because it looks like you've got a lua overlay installed [20:52:37]
2016-09-17 11:04:56	lman	[20:52:41] kent\n: no, it is required by totem [20:52:41]
2016-09-17 11:04:56	+kent\n	[20:52:59] and I'd probably start with not having that overlay in use. [20:52:59]

2016-09-17 11:04:56	lman	[20:55:42] probably it is a dependency of another overlay [20:55:42]

2016-09-17 11:04:56	+kent\n	[20:56:18] \there's a few places to look [20:56:18]

2016-09-17 12:53:21	Captain_Beezay	I've left other distros I've used for many years because they kept screwing around with the defaults, I put up with their systemd defaulting, then kde wireless/wicd defaulting , and other stuff was too much

2016-09-17 12:56:02	Captain_Beezay	I hope not

2016-09-17 12:56:24	Captain_Beezay	you're right, in this case I blame kde for being a-holes
2016-09-17 12:56:39	Captain_Beezay	they added the wicd dependncy too,maybe I just need a new DE

2016-09-17 12:57:28	+kent\n	so I'm just using AwesomeWM and no DE

2016-09-17 13:48:41	Captain_Beezay	do you scrap emerge output and try to auto-correct it, or require manual intervention?
2016-09-17 13:48:52	Captain_Beezay	maolang: ok
2016-09-17 13:49:19	maolang	but really that is rather a bit more rare...

2016-09-17 13:50:14	+kent\n	Captain_Beezay: if you have that case, you probably want to consider deploying from gentoo.git where you can freeze to a commit
2016-09-17 13:50:31	maolang	thats potentially you rather should be made aware off rather than simply autoadding it without your notice...
2016-09-17 13:50:44	kurly	unattended automated updates sounds like a surefire way to break things
2016-09-17 13:50:57	Captain_Beezay	kurly: not updates,provisions.
2016-09-17 13:51:10	+kent\n	Captain_Beezay:  and then keep your USE sets and the referenced SHA1 in its own repo, and then you manage that repo as a single thing
2016-09-17 13:51:11	Captain_Beezay	kent\n: didn't know that was a thing
2016-09-17 13:51:38	Captain_Beezay	kent\n: is there a wiki/link I can reference ?
2016-09-17 13:51:40	+kent\n	another strategy would be to use the snapshots of portage instead of rsync

2016-09-17 13:53:26	+kent\n	but the rsync mirrors are fed from git now
2016-09-17 13:53:38	Captain_Beezay	my fear is , say I have package "nano" ,not requiring any special USE flags, if in the future nano needs , say... "pulseaudio" for w/e upstream reason,etc... how to adopt

2016-09-17 13:53:43	+kent\n	so "How do I do this" is basically "learn git"
2016-09-17 13:54:30	+kent\n	Captain_Beezay: the trick is to not solve this problem on the deployment targets
2016-09-17 13:54:33	Captain_Beezay	ok, I'll see where I get with that if needed
2016-09-17 13:55:13	+kent\n	you solve this problem at the "staging" point, you scrub your USE flags to suit the SHA1, and then you roll out that configuration by re-using the SHA1 and USE sets

2016-09-17 17:03:53	minimalism	eKenda: I'm asking if you're trying to get ALSA working
2016-09-17 17:03:57	minimalism	and not pulse or something
2016-09-17 17:04:22	eKenda	minimalism: yes, only alsa
2016-09-17 17:04:43	Vaska	emerge --noreplace records a package in world, but is uninstalling a package with -C the only opposite equivalent to remove it from the world file?
2016-09-17 17:04:44	minimalism	Well, when I installed gentoo about a week or so ago.. the problem was the default alsa.conf
2016-09-17 17:04:54	kurly	Vaska: do not use -C

2016-09-17 17:05:17	kurly	Vaska: the opposite of --noreplace is --deselect
2016-09-17 17:05:21	minimalism	eKenda: try opening /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf, and change all instances of "subdevice -1" to "subdevice 0". Save the file, but keep it open in case you need to revert.
2016-09-17 17:05:46	eKenda	minimalism: alright lemme try that
2016-09-17 17:05:56	Vaska	kurly: Thanks!  Does --deselect automatically uninstall it? Or will it wait until the next depclean to uninstall it?
2016-09-17 17:06:12	kurly	Vaska: the latter
2016-09-17 17:06:35	Vaska	kurly: Thanks again :)
2016-09-17 17:06:40	kurly	:)
2016-09-17 17:08:37	minimalism	So no one knows where Gentoo fetches the "vmlinuz-ver-gentoo" name from?
2016-09-17 17:08:37		[17:08]
2016-09-17 17:09:07	maolang	Vaska just like if you want to install somethingtemporary to have your next depclean remove withoutany more to it, just emerge --oneshot <testpackages>
2016-09-17 17:10:52	eKenda	minimalism: I edited alsa.conf and changed restarted alsasound service but I still get the same problem when running $alsamixer- this device has no controls

2016-09-17 17:12:18	pepperon1	do others have to make 30+ package.use mods in order to install ruby?

2016-09-17 17:13:05	Vaska	maolang: Thank you sir.  That's a good trick to know.  I'll add it to my cheat sheet now.
2016-09-17 17:13:10	pepperoni	minimalism: yes
2016-09-17 17:13:23	eKenda	minimalism: I have only one device

2016-09-17 17:14:08	maolang	Vaska normally all that gets updated / installed on that command line will be oneshotted on the next depclean
2016-09-17 17:14:11	minimalism	What's the name of the device?
2016-09-17 17:14:21	wokko	eKenda: audio or codec
2016-09-17 17:14:41	eKenda	minimalism: hda intel pch

2016-09-17 17:15:49	Vaska	maolang: for some reason, per my updating cheat sheet, I have been doing a "emerge --oneshot libtoo" after an "emerge -vDau world" and "emerge --depclean", is "emerge --oneshot libtool" a wise thing to do after those two?
2016-09-17 17:15:55	eKenda	wokko: [    1.043694] hdaudio hdaudioC0D0: Unable to bind the codec; [    1.043804] hdaudio hdaudioC0D3: Unable to bind the codec
2016-09-17 17:16:07	eKenda	wokko: I get the same for both audio and codec
2016-09-17 17:16:53	maolang	if you one shot something by accident, just do emerge --noreplace packagename to add it to your world file
2016-09-17 17:17:19	maolang	it wont reemerge it it wil just add the reference to the package in world
2016-09-17 17:17:20	wokko	eKenda: Yeah looks you dont have a codec enabled for your card but by your link you do... does 'uname -v' the correct time of your last kernel build?
2016-09-17 17:17:34	minimalism	eKenda: Same as mine then
