2016-09-15 20:20:12	Triffid_Hunter	screen/tmux are great for that, just go to new tab and all the make spam is hidden on the server end, but you can still scroll back through it if something goes awry
2016-09-15 20:20:13	modded	hey my old ISP's help desk didn't understand why anyone needed more than 5mb/s up/down

2016-09-16 03:50:38	Vaska	Happy Friday! - I'm having trouble with X on a new install.  TWM starts with a few xterms but when I run nvidia-settings, the fonts are unreadable squiggles and the resolution is 800x480 despite being connected to a 1080P TV with HDMI.
2016-09-16 03:50:47	+grknight	Neptu: if you are not redistributing binaries, you can simply take out bindist from make.conf;  openssh and openssl must have the same value for bindist; so when a package needs openssl to switch it off, portage gets confused because openssh wanted the on value

2016-09-16 04:40:06	tirej	so, i wan to ask a few questions? does gentoo has gpu problems like arch ?(because i am having problem with that)
2016-09-16 04:41:16	maolang	what type of problem are you talking about, can you elaborate the details a lil bit..
2016-09-16 04:41:20	tirej	the second question is, does gentoo has booting problem with efi installation (i barely could install arch with efi partition on my laptop and boot it )
2016-09-16 04:42:02	+grknight	tirej: our minimal ISO is not UEFI ready so an extra step is needed, but beyond that, UEFI isn't difficult
2016-09-16 04:42:11	maolang	if you want to install with EFI, get yourself a ubuntu live boot based off the 16.04 and run the full  install of gentoo though it, ubuntu live boots correctly for UEFI
2016-09-16 04:42:15	tirej	maolang: e.g. i could not open fkn desktop with arch
2016-09-16 04:42:56	+grknight	tirej: i recommend sysrescuecd or the Gentoo LiveDVD for install on UEFI to save headaches

2016-09-16 08:48:42	maolang	bad memory is sometimes hard to corner, it could work without problem until the right stress starts causing issues...
2016-09-16 08:48:47	+grknight	c163r: you don't normally need revdep-rebuild these days unless something specific requires it
2016-09-16 08:48:49	+iamben	"some weird dirs appeared" is not enough

2016-09-16 10:57:41	mackal	so I used to be able to have virtual/linux-sources not be in my world file which allowed me to upgrade my kernel when I had the time to, but now for some reason I have to which means I can't delay the kernel upgrade until I have time, did I miss a change some where?
2016-09-16 10:58:44	infirit	yes nabblet, iamben is right, there is a daemon and a agent, the agent is normally auto started by your session (xfce, gnome etc)
2016-09-16 10:58:46	+iamben	mackal: it's possible that you have some package depending on virtual/linux-sources, so it's pulled into the dep graph on world upgrade.  i'd just mask newer sources if you dont want them upgraded

2016-09-16 20:26:36	wuseman	Chromedesktop is possible if you using chromebook but its way to laggy. Remmina is the best choice if the target server using rdp or vnc.
2016-09-16 20:27:02	maolang	and running this way you do unmerge TV completely and run it in place from a folder in your home folder just fine
2016-09-16 20:27:43	space-xpc	never run rdp or vnc over internet
2016-09-16 20:27:52	wuseman	I do not like licensed programs and when it is this buggy as it seems i do like it even less. Simple as that space-xpc

2016-09-17 01:21:14	maolang	if you are GPT partitioned as i said ealier, thats something else, either as wokko suggested, or you create a small new virtual HD like 200mb partitioned table DOS, one partition for the whole drive, and that would be your /boot which you boot BIOS and not EFI
2016-09-17 01:21:23	exxi	maolang, this one is a bran new just tarball extracted
2016-09-17 01:21:40	maolang	if so then i would kill it and get it DOS

2016-09-17 01:23:51	maolang	dont forget to put the boot flag on the /sda1 partition for your /boot
2016-09-17 01:24:36	grawity	BIOS can boot from GPT disks; they have a "protective MBR" which can still hold bootcode

2016-09-17 01:27:35	grawity	it can be anywhere technically (well, I think within the first 2 TB)
2016-09-17 01:27:49	grawity	with pure MBR, grub hides itself in the empty area
2016-09-17 01:28:03	grawity	with GPT, well, the GPT already occupies that area, so you give grub a partition
2016-09-17 01:28:05	maolang	probably better to have it at a defined known location than somwhere on drive at position x..

2016-09-17 01:32:54	grawity	I think you're supposed to install it on sda, not sda1?

2016-09-17 01:36:17	maolang	technically on a USB key, you could have a normal GPT tabled HD, that 2mb partition and a fat32 partition so that USB live creation could be mbr booted and as well efi booted
2016-09-17 01:36:30	grawity	yes
2016-09-17 01:37:15	maolang	well i will play with it on usb, where its a bit less system invasive... :)
2016-09-17 01:37:23	grawity	for comparison, syslinux's gptmbr.bin works similarly, but embeds itself directly into /boot (with no intermediate stage), and expects /boot to have a special attribute bit ("legacy_boot" in parted)

2016-09-17 11:04:56	+kent\n	[20:52:27] are you using lua for anything specific? [20:52:27]
2016-09-17 11:04:56	+kent\n	[20:52:37] because it looks like you've got a lua overlay installed [20:52:37]
2016-09-17 11:04:56	lman	[20:52:41] kent\n: no, it is required by totem [20:52:41]
2016-09-17 11:04:56	+kent\n	[20:52:59] and I'd probably start with not having that overlay in use. [20:52:59]

2016-09-17 11:04:56	lman	[20:55:42] probably it is a dependency of another overlay [20:55:42]

2016-09-17 11:04:56	+kent\n	[20:56:18] \there's a few places to look [20:56:18]

2016-09-17 12:53:21	Captain_Beezay	I've left other distros I've used for many years because they kept screwing around with the defaults, I put up with their systemd defaulting, then kde wireless/wicd defaulting , and other stuff was too much

2016-09-17 12:56:02	Captain_Beezay	I hope not

2016-09-17 12:56:24	Captain_Beezay	you're right, in this case I blame kde for being a-holes
2016-09-17 12:56:39	Captain_Beezay	they added the wicd dependncy too,maybe I just need a new DE

2016-09-17 12:57:28	+kent\n	so I'm just using AwesomeWM and no DE

2016-09-17 13:48:41	Captain_Beezay	do you scrap emerge output and try to auto-correct it, or require manual intervention?
2016-09-17 13:48:52	Captain_Beezay	maolang: ok
2016-09-17 13:49:19	maolang	but really that is rather a bit more rare...

2016-09-17 13:50:14	+kent\n	Captain_Beezay: if you have that case, you probably want to consider deploying from gentoo.git where you can freeze to a commit
2016-09-17 13:50:31	maolang	thats potentially you rather should be made aware off rather than simply autoadding it without your notice...
2016-09-17 13:50:44	kurly	unattended automated updates sounds like a surefire way to break things
2016-09-17 13:50:57	Captain_Beezay	kurly: not updates,provisions.
2016-09-17 13:51:10	+kent\n	Captain_Beezay:  and then keep your USE sets and the referenced SHA1 in its own repo, and then you manage that repo as a single thing
2016-09-17 13:51:11	Captain_Beezay	kent\n: didn't know that was a thing
2016-09-17 13:51:38	Captain_Beezay	kent\n: is there a wiki/link I can reference ?
2016-09-17 13:51:40	+kent\n	another strategy would be to use the snapshots of portage instead of rsync

2016-09-17 13:53:26	+kent\n	but the rsync mirrors are fed from git now
2016-09-17 13:53:38	Captain_Beezay	my fear is , say I have package "nano" ,not requiring any special USE flags, if in the future nano needs , say... "pulseaudio" for w/e upstream reason,etc... how to adopt

2016-09-17 13:53:43	+kent\n	so "How do I do this" is basically "learn git"
2016-09-17 13:54:30	+kent\n	Captain_Beezay: the trick is to not solve this problem on the deployment targets
2016-09-17 13:54:33	Captain_Beezay	ok, I'll see where I get with that if needed
2016-09-17 13:55:13	+kent\n	you solve this problem at the "staging" point, you scrub your USE flags to suit the SHA1, and then you roll out that configuration by re-using the SHA1 and USE sets

2016-09-18 07:11:38	darkstalker	i want gcc 6 for skylake support D:
2016-09-18 07:12:13	koracain	how should i go about solving circular dependancies: gcc, merge depends on glibc merge buildtime gcc merge buildtime
2016-09-18 07:12:31	+iamben	koracain: sounds like you lost your /var/db/pkg/ dir so portage things you have no packages installed

2016-09-18 07:15:43	+iamben	if you just needed gcc6 on ONE package though, it'd be feasible
2016-09-18 07:16:13	darkstalker	still, at least we should have 5.x .. 4.9 is pretty old

Now, my console fonts are huge and ugly, and there's a general slowdown of console text.  What are the alternatives for uvesa framebuffers until the driver gets sorted out on this issue?

2016-09-18 09:13:51	sleepster	[18:45:59] or grsecurity [18:45:59]

2016-09-18 09:13:51	webstrand	[18:47:07] When writing an ebuild for a project that uses autotools but has its own autogen.sh, should I just execute the autogen.sh or try to use eclass functions instead? [18:47:07]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	ShoarAu	[18:47:12] sleepster: you can run apparmor + grsecurity or selinux+grsecurity afaik [18:47:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	KingOfNoobs	[18:47:14] Oh.k [18:47:14]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	+iamben	[18:47:28] vandr0iy: what does "readlink /usr/bin/firefox" say? [18:47:28]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	+iamben	[18:47:48] webstrand: you should look inside autogen.sh to see what it does, and replicate it with things like autoreconf etc [18:47:48]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	+iamben	[18:47:54] webstrand: eautoreconf, that is [18:47:54]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	vandr0iy	[18:49:02] the file you mentioned before, /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox [18:49:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	+iamben	[18:49:31] vandr0iy: i thought you said it pointed to your dev version [18:49:31]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	vandr0iy	[18:50:33] for some reason, that's the dev version [18:50:33]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	vandr0iy	[18:50:54] do I need to purge the dev version and THEN install the ordinary one? [18:50:54]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	+iamben	[18:51:00] no [18:51:00]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	+iamben	[18:51:32] vandr0iy: what does "/usr/lib64/firefox/firefox --version" say? [18:51:32]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	+iamben	[18:52:25] i wonder if you still have firefox-dev processes open and when you try to launch firefox it attaches to the running process rather than spawning a new one [18:52:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	vandr0iy	[18:53:26] it says 45.0.3, while the dev is 47.2.0; weird [18:53:26]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	vandr0iy	[18:53:34] yeah, the process is still open [18:53:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	+iamben	[18:53:42] that must be what's happening then [18:53:42]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	+iamben	[18:53:54] emerge did overwrite all the files on disk, but it didnt touch the ones loaded into memory =) [18:53:54]

2016-09-18 09:13:51	+iamben	[18:56:21] apus: updating perl by itself is almost definitely not going to work [18:56:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	+iamben	[18:56:40] try running "emerge --depclean --ask" and see if it's willing and able to remove orphaned deps [18:56:40]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	Frog_	[19:02:01] Hi. I'm trying to encrypt one of my partitions on my laptop, I'd like to know what's the recommended crypto backend for this task? cryptsetup allows for gcrypt, kernel, nettle and openssl. I enabled the crypto backend in my kernel but I'm still tempted to use openssl instead. What do you guys recommend? [19:02:01]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	NullConstant	[19:03:23] JFC boost-build taking forever to fetch [19:03:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	NullConstant	[19:03:43] long enough for me to actually have to tail -f the emerge log to see if it's working. [19:03:43]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	+iamben	[19:04:06] NullConstant: /var/log/emerge-fetch.log for the background fetching [19:04:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	+iamben	[19:04:15] and it's a small fetch so you must have gotten a bum mirror [19:04:15]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	NullConstant	[19:04:34] well yeah the download speeds aren't exactly top tier right now [19:04:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	NullConstant	[19:08:38] I'm so glad I don't have to be doing any of this by hand. [19:08:38]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	NullConstant	[19:09:41] I'd probably go insane if I were on an LFS system. [19:09:41]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	username234	[19:10:35] NullConstant: I've basically done a LFS install by hand (there's a few pieces I haven't done, but I've built a cross-compiler by hand, compiled gcc, glibc, various Linux packages, etc.) [19:10:35]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	username234	[19:10:55] and yeah... it can be a pian [19:10:55]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	username234	[19:10:57] pain* [19:10:57]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	NullConstant	[19:10:58] username234: how was the experience and how long did it take overall? [19:10:58]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	NullConstant	[19:11:05] (and how many annoyances did you run into on the way) [19:11:05]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	username234	[19:11:55] first time I attempted to build a cross-compiler took a little over a week.  There's a lot of misinformation on the Internet on how to do it.  The best resource I found was the Gentoo Embedded Handbook. [19:11:55]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	username234	[19:12:15] and as for the number of annoyances... there's always about a dozen or so [19:12:15]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	username234	[19:13:43] this won't build because it needs flag X (dependency undocumented), miswritten configure test so runtime tests are attempted (and fail), "glibc sucks at life", etc. [19:13:43]

2016-09-18 10:58:04	SamWeasley	hello everyone. I've installed Jekyll into my system, but recently I can't call it
2016-09-18 10:58:12	wonko7	tdr: that's not what I'm observing

2016-09-18 10:58:48	tdr	wonko7, try using an adblocker so whatevers on your 700 pages arent using tons of memory cycling ads etc
2016-09-18 10:58:55	SamWeasley	maolong.
2016-09-18 10:59:24	wonko7	tdr: this has been happening for a week, I didn't have that problem before. I'm using 4.7.4, and I had vm/overcommit_memory=0
2016-09-18 10:59:51	wonko7	tdr: I just changed that to vm/overcommit_memory=2, but it's too soon to know if it's better
2016-09-18 10:59:55	tdr	wonko7, only other time i've seen oom killer kick in without swap + memory being full is when some "app" like websphere starts up and grabs a huge chunk of memory in a very rude way

2016-09-18 11:38:24	maolang	so you downgraded to 3.1.6, then reupgraded to 3.2.1 then now its good?

2016-09-18 11:38:47	SamWeasley	maolong - yup
2016-09-18 11:39:44	maolang	SamWeasley: i guess, your 3.1.6 somehow got damaged and when you simply upgreaded, it upgraded into a problem, by re-installing 3.1.6 and putting the old version properly in place, 3.2.1 was then fine... sometimes its not soo much, cool then :)

Women are especially vulnerable to emotional brainwashing due to their fine emotional qualities being abused by the jew. What would you have left if you find out you gave up your treasures for jew lies?

2016-09-18 13:24:37	stakewinner00	[22:40:55] mysql [22:40:55]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	loa	[22:41:21] maolang, maybe it is better even make lvm. [22:41:21]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	tdr	[22:41:32] stakewinner00, emerge mysql first then and it will satisfy the virtual and not try pulling mariadb [22:41:32]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	loa	[22:41:39] always wonder about trying show mirroring. [22:41:39]

2016-09-18 13:24:37	stakewinner00	[22:42:48] tdr, emerging mysql is in a blocking condition with mariadb [22:42:48]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	tdr	[22:43:12] stakewinner00, you already have mariadb on your box? [22:43:12]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	stakewinner00	[22:43:40] tdr,  no [22:43:40]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	tdr	[22:43:50] stakewinner00, one sec, i'll check on one of mine [22:43:50]

2016-09-18 13:24:37	stakewinner00	[22:46:56] tdr, the same log: https://paste.pound-python.org/show/yDxCknoxuJxn1D9NXWf8/ [22:46:56]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	tdr	[22:47:39] stakewinner00, for one thing, enable the server flag on your mysql [22:47:39]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	stakewinner00	[22:48:30] tdr, i had it enabled it before, so i deleted it to see if it changs anythin g [22:48:30]

2016-09-18 13:24:37	tdr	[22:56:06] dank101, its not bad, depending on your setup or if you use pulse vs just alsa etc [22:56:06]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	dank101	[22:56:37] I know, I'm just saying this might screw me over [22:56:37]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	stakewinner00	[22:56:37] tdr, i solved it by masking mariadb [22:56:37]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	tdr	[22:56:48] stakewinner00, lol that works too :) [22:56:48]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	stakewinner00	[22:57:00] i didn't remember that xD sorry [22:57:00]
2016-09-18 13:24:37	tdr	[22:57:39] stakewinner00, ive never masked it, but who knows, some profile flag may turn it on or something [22:57:39]

2016-09-18 13:24:37	xpoint	[23:19:38] while /run/lock is a tmpfs based dir, that leads to missing dir here on gentoo [23:19:38]

2016-09-18 13:24:37	dank101	[23:19:55] Any idea how to fix immediately? [23:19:55]

2016-09-18 20:58:40	Coburn	You'd want to bridge your connection so the firewall can get an IP address from DHCP or static for your internet router

2016-09-18 20:59:59	badgerSqueegee	i can bridge that though right?

2016-09-19 02:44:01	cb1	[10:27:54] i am :> [10:27:54]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	cb1	[10:29:06] L-Chymera: make you work public when you are done. we can cite you then ;) [10:29:06]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	rypervenche	[10:29:32] apus: Ah, thanks for letting me know. I didn't know that would do it :) [10:29:32]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	L-Chymera	[10:31:19] cb1: I will, but for it to get published I first have to convince some reviewers that gentoo is a serious thing and that it's usable for software management in my field. The last one is pretty much up to me, but I'd welcome help with the first part ^^ (e.g. in the form of references to cite). [10:31:19]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	cb1	[10:33:18] i wrote a paper about docker (yes..) and virtualization as part of modern devs workflow. i had very few "real" references too. but the reviewers were ok with snapshotting/printing out man pages and such [10:33:18]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	cb1	[10:33:38] it depends on your university [10:33:38]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	L-Chymera	[10:34:38] cb1: you mean if you're from a reputable university you're likely to be taken serious by defult? [10:34:38]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	@xiaomiao	[10:35:00] L-Chymera: no, some unis accept anything written in coherent sentences, others want to have some meaningful content [10:35:00]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	cb1	[10:35:02] unfortunately i was not able to make it public because the work is now property of the uni %) [10:35:02]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	L-Chymera	[10:36:15] xiaomiao: ah, I'm not publishing via the university - rather an external publisher [10:36:15]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	cb1	[10:37:23] aha [10:37:23]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	apus	[10:40:00] rypervenche: have you come across something like this: delete directory even if not empty but only three files are present? my samba share comes from alfresco and that always puts into every folder automatic files which help the workflow [10:40:00]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	apus	[10:40:07] for rsync [10:40:07]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	rypervenche	[10:40:53] apus: I don't understand what you mean by only three files are present. [10:40:53]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	apus	[10:41:49] rypervenche: well each folder has three files, which are Checkout.exe, Checkin.exe and another one. if you are under windows and drop a file onto them, an operation is performed that helps with the workflow of the versioning stuff of this content system alfresco [10:41:49]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	apus	[10:43:34] if i am now under linux, that obviously doesn't work. if i locally remove a directory i also remove these three files. i mean they aren't "real" on the remote side, just placed there by samba or whatever. each sync, no matter which direction i exclude those files, because i don't want to transfer them. this causes locally removed folders to not become empty on the remote side and thus the whole directory can't be deleted [10:43:34]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	rypervenche	[10:44:17] apus: Ah, I see, so you only want to remove those folders or you don't want to? [10:44:17]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	apus	[10:45:22] they are practically empty then on the remote side too, because the real files on the remote side get deleted by rsync, but it says directory itself is then not empty because of those files and doesn't delete it [10:45:22]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	apus	[10:46:00] only chance would be to sync those files, but i have no idea how that works if you transfer them back, because as i said, i don't have any clue how that is handled internally [10:46:00]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	rypervenche	[10:46:38] apus: What doesn't delete the directory? alfresco? [10:46:38]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	apus	[10:46:43] rsync [10:46:43]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	rypervenche	[10:46:53] apus: So use -r [10:46:53]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	rypervenche	[10:47:24] I don't think I'm understanding your ultimate goal here. [10:47:24]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	apus	[10:47:26] i need something like rsync ... --delete --delete-folder-even-when-not-empty-but-only-with-the-following-files-in-it=[file1 file2 file3] [10:47:26]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	rypervenche	[10:48:01] apus: So folders that have more than those three files, you don't want to delete, correct? [10:48:01]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	@xiaomiao	[10:48:03] apus: lsyncd ? [10:48:03]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	grawity	[10:48:27] apus: doesn't rsync's --exclude (with 'perish' flag) do exactly that? [10:48:27]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	apus	[10:49:09] rypervenche: i want to delete all folders that are gone locally, but because i excluded those files from my sync, they don't get deleted remotely, therefore the directory is then not empty remotely and can't be deleted [10:49:09]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	apus	[10:49:28] grawity: perish? [10:49:28]

2016-09-19 02:44:01	cb1	[10:52:35] see "p" in INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERN RULES section of rsyncs man page [10:52:35]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	apus	[10:53:16] rypervenche: --delete-excluded would then remove those files from ALL directories, even those that are not gone locally [10:53:16]

2016-09-19 02:44:01	apus	[11:11:01] that works now! for whatever reason however each time i run it again, it always finds the same files i now already transferred. they have a supposed change of modification time. is this a problem with samba shares? [11:11:01]

2016-09-19 02:44:01	apus	[11:13:55] or can it hash the contents somehow? [11:13:55]

2016-09-19 03:41:03	Tecumseh	iamben, Yes, I did. it's 3_4 which is needed by other packages.
2016-09-19 03:41:24	+iamben	Tecumseh: it would have better to only set that single target to 3_4 for the package which needs it
2016-09-19 03:41:41	qstrahl	grknight: Ah, there is no mechanism to provide multiple packages for different permutations of USE flags?
2016-09-19 03:41:47	+iamben	because 3_4 globally won't work, too many python2-only things like asciidoc
2016-09-19 03:41:48	Tecumseh	iamben, ok. In package.use?
2016-09-19 03:41:51	+grknight	qstrahl: indeed
2016-09-19 03:41:51	+iamben	yes
2016-09-19 03:41:52	crakrjak	any idea why xrandr would only show the stuff from one card vs both of them? I do notice that even in console mode, only the monitors from one card are on, the other two stay off. using amdgpu with 2 R9 390X
2016-09-19 03:42:03	Tecumseh	iamben, ok will do. thanks a lot.

I notice debian has this neat thing going https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds - I am thinking maybe since gentoo is so customizable it's highly unlikely that many users end up getting the exact same binary?

2016-09-19 05:28:19	+iamben	assuming the point is that you want to verify that the binaries are built from the source that the distributor claims

2016-09-19 05:30:24	+grknight	L-Chymera: the same or greater USE flags on the same versions of packages should always produce the same results
2016-09-19 05:30:25	+iamben	as long as your USE flags and toolchain versions match, and your compiler flags match (and no native) then it should be reproducible
2016-09-19 05:30:26	@xiaomiao	L-Chymera: you would have to start with a fixed tree and fixed seed stage

2016-09-20 01:19:58	tyil	what's the difference?
2016-09-20 01:21:03	Kelsar	MAKEOPTS is a parameter to make, usually it will spawn multiple compiles inside a buildsystem (ebuild), emerge -j will start multiple ebuilds at once, as long as the deps are resolved allready
2016-09-20 01:21:17	tyil	ah
2016-09-20 01:21:21	 *	tyil adds it
2016-09-20 01:21:25	rafspiny	tyil: MAKEOPTS -j tells make to run in parallel to a certain degree while emerge -j x means to start x indipendent package simultaniously
2016-09-20 01:21:44	rafspiny	sorry Kelsar, I was typing as well :)

2016-09-20 03:36:33	W0lf	iamben, why? i have done that using mirrorselect long back ?
2016-09-20 03:36:34	+iamben	oznt: python3_5 is stable-masked, so it's only visible when you're allowing unstable on the package (or you've fully unmasked it)... you're on stable virtual/python-pathlib so the flag is masked tehre, (-python3_5)

2016-09-20 03:37:10	+iamben	W0lf: if you use rsync, you are supposed to specify the module name after the "/", in this case the module name is gentoo-portage
2016-09-20 03:37:11	+grknight	oznt: you either need to force virtual/python-pathlib to unstable by placing it in package.accept_keywords OR umasking python_targets_python_3_5 in /etc/portage/profile/use.stable.mask
2016-09-20 03:37:37	W0lf	iamben,  is this is changed recently ?
2016-09-20 03:38:05	+iamben	W0lf: this has always been what you are supposed to do.. it's possible that the server's default module changed in its config, and that's why the problem showed up
2016-09-20 03:38:20	W0lf	iamben, also if i remember correctly if i disable gentoo mirror in my makeconf it used to pick random mirror but now in my case it's not picking up any mirror

2016-09-20 22:54:46	tdr	apus, command line for kvm for doing things like moving a guest around between hosts i'd say is probably easier but there's not tons different between the two
2016-09-20 22:55:22	tdr	apus, on virtualbox, you see the thing boot etc, with kvm theres a cli mode you can get console on too
2016-09-20 22:55:40	tdr	(or you can see it boot also either locally or using remote viewing of it)
2016-09-20 22:55:49	tdr	theyre both pretty flexible

2016-09-20 23:45:28	keh	Hi there. Does anyone know if it takes more space on the ecrypted area if I write in example 1MB inside the encrypted area on (i.e.) ext4 without journal? Iam just asking because if it's maybe useless to set stride/stripe-width for ssd optimization in ext4 inside an encrypted area if the crypted data is bigger than the size of the ext4 data. :S

2016-09-21 08:04:36	iamben	but after you get to the login prompt, both openrc & systemd consoles are equally noisy, right?

2016-09-21 09:57:03	+xiaomiao	but I think it is very close to hibernation
2016-09-21 09:57:14	dank101	Well, it's gentoo and uses emerge
2016-09-21 09:57:30	dank101	I doubt you really can kill off a gentoo-based OS without killing off Gentoo
2016-09-21 09:57:41	NullConstant	I know that most of the Gentoo/*BSD efforts are focused more on OpenBSD and FreeBSD, but I'm curious, mostly because the idea of Gentoo's metadistro-ness and NetBSD's portability is just really funny to me.
2016-09-21 09:57:47	dank101	Unless Gentoo/NetBSD uses a different portage tree
2016-09-21 09:57:50	tdr	NullConstant, any of the bsd ports of gentoo arent super active and the stages are old
2016-09-21 09:58:25	+xiaomiao	NullConstant: see it as a learning experience ...
2016-09-21 09:58:33	poisonby	Tried emerge-webrsync inside the chroot but it complains about lack of space, currently have 5GB on the VM disk, wiki says the minimum requirement is 2.5 GB
2016-09-21 09:58:35	NullConstant	then again it's basically a niche (BSD port of a Linux distro) in a niche (Gentoo, a Linux distro) within a niche (operating systems)
2016-09-21 09:58:41	tdr	NullConstant, gentoo is nearly as portable, cross compiling for odd archtectures is easier than on alot of distros
2016-09-21 10:00:35	NullConstant	then again even the sole fact that there were/are (semi?-)successful efforts of using Gentoo/Portage on OSes of an entirely different family proves Gentoo's portability/'metadistribution' status
2016-09-21 10:00:48	+grknight	NullConstant: I just got Gentoo/FreeBSD working on a VM and it seems nice.  dunno about NetBSD though
2016-09-21 10:00:49	NullConstant	I think Debian is the only other Linux distro that can also use a BSD kernel/userland?
2016-09-21 10:01:20	tdr	NullConstant, any of them could, its a matter of how much work youre willing to do to make it happen

2016-09-21 10:04:24	+grknight	Fermi cards some have the best nouveau support
2016-09-21 10:04:29	NullConstant	I mean AFAIK I don't think Unity would even work on BSD because of the fact it's basically a GNOME 3 shell which has a hard dependency on systemd which in turn has a hard dependency on Linux?
2016-09-21 10:04:47	tdr	NullAcht15, gnome works on bsd too
2016-09-21 10:05:13	NullConstant	(then again I think there are patches to make GNOME Shell work without systemd? On Gentoo with OpenRC especially?)
2016-09-21 10:05:20	+grknight	iamben: that's a Curie NV49
2016-09-21 10:05:50	+grknight	though mine is a NVCE really
2016-09-21 10:06:23	NullConstant	(on that note, OpenRC is really nice compared to systemd. Some could argue that it's good simply because it *isn't* systemd, but whatever.)
2016-09-21 10:06:31	iamben	basically when i try to switch away from X to another VT, the X display stays on the screen frozen, but i can switch back to the X one and display resumes
2016-09-21 10:07:09	iamben	and it's display-only freeze for sure, i can reboot from the "frozen" vt2 if i blind login

2016-09-21 12:41:37	mark4	[22:26:28] i tried mate but switched to cinnamon which i think has a more cluefull set of developers working on it than mate does [22:26:28]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	Kelsar	[22:26:31] heb_lleol: in theory yes, in practice no, don't do that. it is not like a local overlay is hard to make [22:26:31]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	mark4	[22:26:46] its given me no issues at all other than its gnome :) [22:26:46]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	n-iCe	[22:27:01] Hello my friends, I have never used gentoo before, I would like to install it, is it true that take years? and also that compiling everything will get the best performance of the hardware? [22:27:01]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	n-iCe	[22:27:12] will I even notice that performance compared to other distros? [22:27:12]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	stqn	[22:27:26] n-iCe: no, no. [22:27:26]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	mark4	[22:27:35] n-iCe no - i learned more about using Linux on my first gentoo install than 2 years of using debian taught me [22:27:35]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	mark4	[22:27:44] it takes time to do an install, but its WELL worth it [22:27:44]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	n-iCe	[22:27:49] so, no worth it? [22:27:49]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	genstorm	[22:27:52] n-iCe: don't do it for performance. [22:27:52]

2016-09-21 12:41:37	mark4	[22:28:08] i would consider Gentoo to be the single greatest beginner distribution in existance [22:28:08]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	n-iCe	[22:28:13] just to learn? I have installed archlinux, lol, does it count? [22:28:13]

2016-09-21 12:41:37	heb_lleol	[22:28:30] tdr, Kelsar thanks [22:28:30]

2016-09-21 12:41:37	stqn	[22:28:58] you don’t learn anything by installing Arch, and you also don’t learn anything by installing Gentoo… Besides how to install them, of cours. [22:28:58]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	stqn	[22:29:01] course. [22:29:01]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	mark4	[22:29:21] stqn i disagree [22:29:21]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	maolang	[22:29:51] tdr: you still around? [22:29:51]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	mark4	[22:29:56] the gentoo handbook is a perfect introduction into how to use a linux system. [22:29:56]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	tdr	[22:29:57] maolang, yeah whats up [22:29:57]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	tdr	[22:30:23] mark4, not use it as much as learn your way around where things are and how they tie together [22:30:23]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	mark4	[22:30:24] i would also consider Arch documentation to be a damned good reference for a beginner but i recommend gentoo over arch simply because of AUR [22:30:24]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	tdr	[22:30:37] yeah arch docs are deceent, some of their devs used to be gentoo devs [22:30:37]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	maolang	[22:30:52] tdr: still hunting down google etc, cant seem to find a real good example to boot up one of those windows tools ISO from grub [22:30:52]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	mark4	[22:31:08] tdr when 99% of AUR is in the arch tree proper then ill recommend arch. meanwhile gentoo ftw [22:31:08]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	mark4	[22:32:00] maolang, can you boot it from syslinux? [22:32:00]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	maolang	[22:32:25] not sure, and have not used syslinux for over 10 years... [22:32:25]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	Kelsar	[22:32:36] maolang: last time i tried, it didn't work for me either [22:32:36]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	Kelsar	[22:32:40] with grub [22:32:40]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	tdr	[22:32:50] maolang, alot of times they use memdisk + an append line, let me find a link [22:32:50]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	Kelsar	[22:33:12] in theory grub2 has it's own "memdisk" [22:33:12]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	maolang	[22:33:54] i see mentions of using wimboot and in grub entry listed as /boot/grub/wimboot but i have no such folder and cant locate wimboot in the portage tree if it exist or if its a component that can be used with grub itself [22:33:54]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	n-iCe	[22:33:59] sorry [22:33:59]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	n-iCe	[22:34:00] I'm back [22:34:00]

2016-09-21 12:41:37	Kelsar	[22:38:13] or load memdisk as kernel with the iso as initrd, afaik memdisk is part of syslinux [22:38:13]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	n-iCe	[22:38:52] ok [22:38:52]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	tdr	[22:38:56] it is [22:38:56]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	maolang	[22:39:00] it need to chainload or somehow launch the windows base boot part of the ISO [22:39:00]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	n-iCe	[22:39:02] so, installation is on terminal, right? nothing with GUI [22:39:02]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	tdr	[22:39:14] memdisk treats the other media like an hd [22:39:14]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	tdr	[22:39:28] maolang, are your widnows cds xp based or newer? [22:39:28]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	tdr	[22:39:41] xp based ones are pretty well documented [22:39:41]

2016-09-21 13:46:07	sheep	second, the third part of that doesn't run /sbin/partprobe; instead it matches the case where RUN is "/sbin/partprobe". You probably want += (add to) instead of == (is equal to) or = (set to)

2016-09-21 14:49:27	wokko	maolang: yello :)
2016-09-21 14:49:44	younix	tslk: i had the same thought

2016-09-21 14:49:51	ts1k	caps still works... I think
2016-09-21 14:49:55	younix	the fact that it SEES grub

2016-09-21 14:50:29	maolang	and starting message that it probably has partition etc right except it just goes into a pause..
2016-09-21 14:50:40	ts1k	so I will make a new kernel cheking all the EFI things

2016-09-21 14:50:57	younix	which drivers you have configured as modules
2016-09-21 14:51:19	wokko	maolang: no
2016-09-21 14:51:34	maolang	with custom boot entry i am getting cannot find .. /boot/iso/x86-64-efi/ntldr.mod  this is the entry: http://dpaste.com/1AXJZH1   what am i missing here?
2016-09-21 14:51:38	maolang	this one
2016-09-21 14:52:10	ts1k	younix: dont remember, I did it like five days ago and now I restating again....
2016-09-21 14:52:11	younix	tslk: ANYTHING critical, even if you don't know what it is by name as some random kernel blurb, that is not built-in on boot with fk you hard
2016-09-21 14:52:42	ts1k	but I think I put all the EFI things as fixed not module
2016-09-21 14:52:44	younix	tslk: that's fine, you still your config file right?
2016-09-21 14:53:03	younix	fixed = good for stuff kernel needs immediately at boot
2016-09-21 14:53:18	younix	otherwise kernel = bye bye
2016-09-21 14:53:43	wokko	maolang: seems fine to me
2016-09-21 14:53:54	maolang	yah except message...
2016-09-21 14:53:58	ts1k	ok, I will mount everithing again and remake my kernel from zero
2016-09-21 14:54:02	younix	i admit: efi SPECIFICALLY i cannot be much help, but i would say the right direction is combing over your kernel device support needed at boot
2016-09-21 14:54:15	wokko	maolang: is ntldr.mod actually there?
2016-09-21 14:54:34	younix	well.... i don't know.  I use MBR BIOS always have is what im saying
2016-09-21 14:54:44	ts1k	yes, I saved all my settings in the .config file
2016-09-21 14:54:45	maolang	no and why it actually refers to that specific efi folder beats me...

2016-09-21 16:34:55	kerframil	the logic there is that you don't want portage to yank the latest version (given just "dev-lang/ruby" as an atom)

2016-09-21 16:36:03	kerframil	2.2 has excellent coverage, though. hopefully that will fix it.
2016-09-21 16:36:51	DogHackit_	Got it. I thought the lastest was only 2.2. I might jsut be miss informed. I still don't get why RUBY_TARGET=ruby22 wouldn't force the version though...

2016-09-21 19:07:01	sjal	[04:54:40] i think so [04:54:40]

2016-09-21 19:07:01	tdr	[04:58:51] sjal, true.  its always a good idea to look at the pci/sub bus and make sure your device is seen before going crazy over it not working.  devices show up on those even if drivers arent loaded for them [04:58:51]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	wokko	[04:58:53] sjal: try 'rfkill list [04:58:53]

2016-09-21 19:07:01	tdr	[04:59:32] the hardwares not seen, check your bios to make sure the integrated wifi isn't disabled [04:59:32]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	tdr	[04:59:45] or if you have a function key combo to turn it on, try that [04:59:45]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	tdr	[04:59:56] that should just us rfkill though [04:59:56]

2016-09-21 19:07:01	sjal	[04:59:59] tdr: weird thing is I'm pretty sure I saw it on the list today morning [04:59:59]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	sjal	[05:00:31] and I used that wifi on fedora and that was 3 days ago [05:00:31]

2016-09-21 19:07:01	Hoolootwo	[05:00:56] also, I'm not sure if this is going to draw flak, but maybe gentoo isn't the best thing to be running on a laptop [05:00:56]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	wokko	[05:00:57] sjal: Yeah I would try tdr suggestion and double check bios just in case [05:00:57]
2016-09-21 19:07:01	tdr	[05:01:03] sjal, check your bios along the way [05:01:03]

2016-09-21 19:07:01	tdr	[05:06:37] maolang, even with an extrernal drive, it wouldnt have the space to even unpack the sourcecode [05:06:37]

2016-09-22 00:23:54	blackflow	[09:31:03] Is gentoo git conversion complete? I have a problem upgrading munin, the existing version is not listed in the Manifest.

2016-09-22 00:23:54	+Poly-C_atwork	[09:32:30] blackflow: Yeah, the git conversion is complete since August 2015. [09:32:30]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	+kensington	[09:33:46] blackflow: the git repo uses thin manifests ie. uses git's internal hashes for files in the repository [09:33:46]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	blackflow	[09:34:05] oh, that explains it... [09:34:05]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	+kensington	[09:34:18] the manifest you get over rsync is different because the staging process expands those manifests to thick ones [09:34:18]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	blackflow	[09:34:30] so I guess I can just copy-paste the DIST line for the missing version? [09:34:30]

2016-09-22 00:23:54	blackflow	[09:36:27] Poly-C_atwork: ah that fixed it. It's been a while since I had to fix manifests, forgot about that. Thanks! [09:36:27]

2016-09-22 00:23:54	Triffid_Hunter	[10:03:00] neuro_sys: it's worth the ability to choose compile-time options to adapt the capabilities and dependency tree to my liking, ie use flags. I tell folks if they don't change use flags there's no point in using gentoo [10:03:00]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	Frog_	[10:03:03] neuro_sys: I find tweaking my USE flags fun [10:03:03]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	rivarun	[10:10:41] i don't like it when software tells me what other software i should be running [10:10:41]

2016-09-22 03:24:17	username234	eKenda: so the full story is that the MBR scheme gives bootloaders about 440 bytes to install their data and code.  Now for something like GRUB that supports multiple filesystems and volume layouts, that's no where near enough space.  However, the MBR scheme also puts a gap between the start of the partition table and the first partition.  Nothing ever used that space, so bootloaders like GRUB would put additional data and code there.
2016-09-22 03:24:18	username234	When the GPT scheme came out, they chose to give the bootloaders a special partition for that purpose instead of just repeating the convention of saying that gap has to be there.

2016-09-22 03:31:43	efrahim	I also have some questions regarding boot-partitions: The handbook seems to suggest two partitions one "bios_grub" and one "boot". Later when installing bootloader, and installing the kernel, I have placed them in the "boot"-one, but it says that it should be vfat, but only "bios_grub" need to be that (and that is not mounted anywhere...)

2016-09-22 03:33:36	username234	efrahim: the ESP (EFI System Partition) has to be vFAT formatted, if you are UEFI booting.
2016-09-22 03:33:43	+grknight	efrahim: you came in at the tail of it but the bios_boot/bios_grub is to reserve raw space for grub to embed itself when BIOS is used with GPT disk format

2016-09-22 05:23:26	+iamben	eKenda: stage1 and stage2 are part of the process that our build tool catalyst uses to produce stage3, stage3 is the only one users see.  it's a bit of a historical quirk that users get to see the "stage3" name, it probably should just be called "gentoo-base" or something =)

2016-09-22 06:01:01	enleth	Hi. I seem to have just found out the hard way that mixing march=corei7-avx and march=core-avx2 (by switching to the latter before a world upgrade) is a bad idea, both google-chrome and firefox are crashing on me now upon trying to rended anything. Is the march switch indeed likely to screw things up?

2016-09-22 10:40:18	anonymou1	According to man(5) of ebuild, it’s about runtime dependencies that may break. But the explanation doesn’t make sense to me.
2016-09-22 10:41:14	+iamben	anonymou1: with := it allows any slot but will trigger a rebuild when this dep's (sub)slot changes
2016-09-22 10:41:14		[10:41]
2016-09-22 10:41:56	newgentoouser	Does actually compiling everything to my hardware will optimize the system?
2016-09-22 10:42:14	anonymou1	Ahh, so it’s a precautionary measure against ABI (and maybe even API) changes.
2016-09-22 10:42:22	+iamben	newgentoouser: slightly.  most of the benefit is from the control of build-time optional features
2016-09-22 10:42:49	+iamben	anonymou1: yeah for example the xf86-* drivers use this to rebuild when xorg-server chagnes subslot from 1.17 to 1.18

2016-09-22 10:47:31	+iamben	newgentoouser: there is SOME benefit from the cpu optimization, but it's usually minor.  but since gentoo has full control of features by building from source, you can get much leaner apps than ubuntu (ubuntu has to enable everything available, to please all users, basically)
2016-09-22 10:48:07	+iamben	if you don't have a printer, you can disable cups, for example.  this feature usually only controllable at compilation time, so ubuntu users can't turn it off at will.

2016-09-22 17:26:26	maolang	ekendal its possible you need to edit package.accept_keywords and add --> =app-portage/layman-2.4.0-r1 ~amd64
2016-09-22 17:27:06	maolang	testing as unstable, this version needs accept for keyword amd64 in make.conf global or per package
2016-09-22 17:27:46	maolang	dont just put in make.conf just like that though in your make.conf else it will apply for every packages
2016-09-22 17:28:00	eKenda	got it

2016-09-22 17:40:04	zyliwax	curious general linux question... if i have a partition i want to mount to /dir and another partition i want to mount to /dir/foo, but the first partition fails to mount for any reason, will the second partition fail to mount as a result of /dir not containing ./foo? could i subver this by creating a directory called ./foo while the first partition is unmounted?

2016-09-22 17:41:36	garth	zyliwax: as long as the destination exists and is a directory, you can mount something on it, no matter which filesystem it's on at the time the mount is made
2016-09-22 17:43:14	Azerthoth	you need a mount point, the nested mount will only mount if that point exists
2016-09-22 17:43:31	zyliwax	okay specifics: i want to create a directory dedicated to backups in /var, but come to think of it, maybe /opt is better because it doesn't already have a designated partition
2016-09-22 17:44:58	Azerthoth	the specifics in this case dont matter, if the mount point exists it will mount, if it does not it will not. where these points are anywhere else is meaningless
2016-09-22 17:45:30	zyliwax	i want to avoid /bar/foo failing to mount because the directory doesn't exist for whatever reason

2016-09-22 17:45:47	zyliwax	it seems "safer" to make the mountpoints as flat as possible
2016-09-22 17:45:56	slicktux	zyliwax: keep in mind that if you "mount /foo /dir" than anything mounted to "/foor" is now mounted to "/dir && any sub-folders in it.
2016-09-22 17:47:54	Azerthoth	zyliwax, you can put it all in /mnt/ and then simply use symlinks to place them properly. so even if a nested mount fails you can still simply correct the initial error and then *poof* everything falls back in line
2016-09-22 17:47:54		[17:47]
2016-09-22 17:49:38	garth	also, if for some reason mounting /dir fail, and then /dir/foo gets mounted, and  then /dir gets mounted and it succeeds, accessing /dir/foo will be on /dir partition and not /dir/foo (the final /dir mount will hide the previous /dir/foo mount)

2016-09-22 18:40:48	younix	I have the kernels for 3 separate linux distros that i run on my machine in my /boot directory that are detected and loaded via grub2 with default handbook install with gentoo.  my question is... well... its getting a little messy with files in there, so if i were to make subdirs for each distros vmlinuz, config, and map files, will grub get all confused about it?
2016-09-22 18:42:09	younix	or does grub always need the files to be in the root of /boot to be detected automatically?
2016-09-22 18:42:48	maolang	younix i think its a case where files need to be where they are expected to be...

2016-09-23 05:21:37	Sophira	Hi. A friend of mine is having difficulty with staying on app-emulation/virtualbox-guest-additions-4.3.32, which she needs because she has issues with higher versions. She's masked >app-emulation/virtualbox-guest-additions-4.3.32 in /etc/portage/package.mask, but Portage needs to unmask it for a 'emerge -auDN @world' to succeed and we're not sure why. http://matrix.theblob.org/emerge-back30.txt shows the
2016-09-23 05:21:43	Sophira	result of the emerge command.

2016-09-23 05:23:05	Sophira	As you can see, the "mask changes necessary" part doesn't really explain why it's necessary, and I don't speak ebuild fluently enough to work it out myself. I know that package masking inthis way *should* be okay, but yeah.
2016-09-23 05:23:35	thunderrd	iamben: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/repos.conf#External_overlay  I see what you're talking about.  It looks like it has been changed to 'sync-type'.  Also, how do I go about finding the sync-uri addresses?
2016-09-23 05:23:50	mender27	Sophira: yes, it looks a bit strange. Normally the forced unmasking comes from a USE flag change, right?

2016-09-23 09:25:52	efrahim	I was in here yesterday and asking a bunch of EFI questions... it is still not booting, so I will continue. The handbook is not too detailed as to why I need the two different kinds of boot partitions. It is such that I should have the smallar (2MB) mounted on /boot/EFI and is vfat, while the larger should be mounted under /boot and can be ext2?
2016-09-23 09:26:11	genewitch	iamben: conflicts because openssh requuires bindist
2016-09-23 09:26:48	+iamben	genewitch: if you disable on openssl, you must do the same on openssh.  most people want bindist off globally, you only need it on if you'll be redistributing your binaries to 3rd parties.

2016-09-23 12:21:05	nimbius	[22:01:08] ive set everything under the sun and cant get my From: to show up [22:01:08]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	nimbius	[22:01:09] what gives? [22:01:09]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	DogHackit_	[22:01:20] iamben: I want to run virtualbox in a chroot [22:01:20]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	maolang	[22:01:49] lol [22:01:49]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	+iamben	[22:02:09] DogHackit_: a VM inside chroot? for what purpose? [22:02:09]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	+iamben	[22:02:50] if for some reason you need that, generally you'd want to build and modprobe the modules outside chroot [22:02:50]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	DogHackit_	[22:03:19] iamben: It is a test dev environment that I don't want to use my own system for, but have to because my work system can't handle it. [22:03:19]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	DogHackit_	[22:03:44] iamben: I don't want vbox on my system, hense the chroot... [22:03:44]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	+iamben	[22:04:16] parts of vbox are gonna be on the host whether you like it or not, since it needs kernel support [22:04:16]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	tdr	[22:04:26] DogHackit_, use qemu [22:04:26]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	+iamben	[22:04:46] but the whole "dev environment" will be inside a VM image, i dont understand why installing vbox itself has to be isolated [22:04:46]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	tdr	[22:05:24] i can think of some and most of them arent very nice [22:05:24]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	+iamben	[22:05:54] tdr: i think you're talking about qemu vs vbox, i'm not [22:05:54]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	DogHackit_	[22:05:59] iamben: I am testing vagrant and ansible. They are going to spawn and configure the VMs [22:05:59]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	+iamben	[22:06:13] DogHackit_: ah, ok, now that is making sense [22:06:13]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	DogHackit_	[22:06:16] tdr: If it were only that simple... [22:06:16]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	DogHackit_	[22:06:29] tdr: :) [22:06:29]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	DogHackit_	[22:06:46] iamben: :) I do once in a while [22:06:46]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	+iamben	[22:07:12] well in any case, vbox's kernel modules will need to be inserted into the host's kernel [22:07:12]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	DogHackit_	[22:07:46] iamben: OK, thank you. I will shoehorn it in there from here. Thanks again! [22:07:46]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	sjal	[22:07:50] hi tdr [22:07:50]

2016-09-23 12:21:05	tdr	[22:08:13] i saw that yesterday after we reconfigured your kernel [22:08:13]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	maolang	[22:08:21] not just between a reboot fixed... [22:08:21]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	sjal	[22:08:41] maolang: i rebooted and it was ok too [22:08:41]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	tdr	[22:08:46] maolang, when you put the right kernel drivers on there, amesome things are possible [22:08:46]
2016-09-23 12:21:05	maolang	[22:08:49] so what was missing in the end the extra intel chipset related devices? [22:08:49]

2016-09-23 12:21:06	+iamben	[22:11:24] maolang: that's quite a run-on sentence so i dont really understand [22:11:24]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	sjal	[22:12:04] also today I realised [22:12:04]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	sjal	[22:12:30] if your laptop is 12,1' you can fit it on ISBERGET that's ikea tablet stand [22:12:30]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	maolang	[22:12:47] remember trying to boot off a MS iso and add it to grub and that ntldr not found part, after extracting the content of those iso's to their own small tiny fat32 partitions, grub probe sees them , but the efi parts only as those iso's can be booted off a UEFI system as well [22:12:47]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	portersmith	[22:14:59] There should be no reason why anyone should be thrown in jail for questioning the facts and different aspects of the history of World War II, including the so-called Jewish Holocaust.

2016-09-23 12:21:06	+iamben	[22:15:46] DogHackit_: does "depmod -a" help? [22:15:46]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	+iamben	[22:16:11] did you just copy them inside the chroot, the 3-4 vbox modules? [22:16:11]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	DogHackit_	[22:16:19] iamben: no response [22:16:19]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	+iamben	[22:17:29] well depmod -a isn't supposed to output anything, but it can regen the module dep cache in /lib/modules [22:17:29]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	DogHackit_	[22:17:31] iamben: Yes I copied them OUT of the chroot to the host. I think the kernel needs a modules_prepare [22:17:31]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	+iamben	[22:18:11] if you built them inside chroot, you would have needed to cpy the host's .config inside, it'd be much easier to build the modules outside chroot [22:18:11]

2016-09-23 13:14:16	wiktor_b	gentoo gives you more control, also our package manager is better

2016-09-23 13:16:02	NextHendrix	arch is binary based, gentoo is source based

2016-09-23 13:17:36	NextHendrix	when you install something on gentoo, its gets compiled from source

2016-09-23 13:17:52	NextHendrix	by default on arch, it downloads a precompiled program file which you can just run straight away

2016-09-23 13:33:08	wiktor_b	the reason why the handbook is the only official guide is because the handbook tells you what's what
