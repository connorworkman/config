2016-09-15 20:19:08	ali3nx	once upon a time iirc i complained to my isp because theyre terrible dsl couldnt systain a connection to ten ssh sessions building gentoo servers. the "engineer" that called was just dumbfounded lol
2016-09-15 20:20:12	Triffid_Hunter	screen/tmux are great for that, just go to new tab and all the make spam is hidden on the server end, but you can still scroll back through it if something goes awry
2016-09-15 20:20:13	modded	hey my old ISP's help desk didn't understand why anyone needed more than 5mb/s up/down

2016-09-15 20:23:16	_catcatcat	There's something buggy I must have done, I can't get my display manager to boot, I just get a white blinking cursor; and then after minutes, "xconsole" not found, or something

2016-09-16 03:50:38	Vaska	Happy Friday! - I'm having trouble with X on a new install.  TWM starts with a few xterms but when I run nvidia-settings, the fonts are unreadable squiggles and the resolution is 800x480 despite being connected to a 1080P TV with HDMI.
2016-09-16 03:50:47	+grknight	Neptu: if you are not redistributing binaries, you can simply take out bindist from make.conf;  openssh and openssl must have the same value for bindist; so when a package needs openssl to switch it off, portage gets confused because openssh wanted the on value

2016-09-16 04:40:06	tirej	so, i wan to ask a few questions? does gentoo has gpu problems like arch ?(because i am having problem with that)
2016-09-16 04:41:16	maolang	what type of problem are you talking about, can you elaborate the details a lil bit..
2016-09-16 04:41:20	tirej	the second question is, does gentoo has booting problem with efi installation (i barely could install arch with efi partition on my laptop and boot it )
2016-09-16 04:42:02	+grknight	tirej: our minimal ISO is not UEFI ready so an extra step is needed, but beyond that, UEFI isn't difficult
2016-09-16 04:42:11	maolang	if you want to install with EFI, get yourself a ubuntu live boot based off the 16.04 and run the full  install of gentoo though it, ubuntu live boots correctly for UEFI
2016-09-16 04:42:15	tirej	maolang: e.g. i could not open fkn desktop with arch
2016-09-16 04:42:56	+grknight	tirej: i recommend sysrescuecd or the Gentoo LiveDVD for install on UEFI to save headaches

2016-09-16 08:48:13	c163r	I have one question: is possible and safe to run revdep-rebuild and eclean-dist in background (using '&'). I've just updated my gentoo system on my rp2 and dont want to wait those longtime commands.
2016-09-16 08:48:32	+iamben	there's no point in trying to guess what caused it if you can't give details as to what exactly you saw
2016-09-16 08:48:42	maolang	bad memory is sometimes hard to corner, it could work without problem until the right stress starts causing issues...
2016-09-16 08:48:47	+grknight	c163r: you don't normally need revdep-rebuild these days unless something specific requires it
2016-09-16 08:48:49	+iamben	"some weird dirs appeared" is not enough

2016-09-16 10:57:41	mackal	so I used to be able to have virtual/linux-sources not be in my world file which allowed me to upgrade my kernel when I had the time to, but now for some reason I have to which means I can't delay the kernel upgrade until I have time, did I miss a change some where?
2016-09-16 10:58:44	infirit	yes nabblet, iamben is right, there is a daemon and a agent, the agent is normally auto started by your session (xfce, gnome etc)
2016-09-16 10:58:46	+iamben	mackal: it's possible that you have some package depending on virtual/linux-sources, so it's pulled into the dep graph on world upgrade.  i'd just mask newer sources if you dont want them upgraded

2016-09-16 17:31:56	hackerhercules	Configuring Grub2 step... It says "first disk is /dev/sda, us grub-install /dev/sda"... sda is the first device, but the first partition I have boot on is sda2.... do I use grub-install /dev/sda2 or /dev/sda
2016-09-16 17:32:29	crakrjak	Just installed gentoo after many years of not using it and the machine reboots after the clocksource step, is that when openrc kicks in? I am trying to use the AMDGPU drives, wondering if anyone would have any tips..
