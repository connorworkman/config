2016-10-17 21:03:37	osse	[15:40:42] ahh [15:40:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	osse	[15:40:58] yeah you just have to magically get into the manpage author's head on that one [15:40:58]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	vbernat	[15:41:08] ok :) [15:41:08]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[15:46:04] you can put a breakpoint in paramsubst and check isarr [15:46:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[15:46:11] or you can use an intermediate variable [15:46:11]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[15:46:21] One of these ways is guaranteed to preserve your sanity. [15:46:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[15:46:41] (the second one) [15:46:41]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	osse	[15:47:42] danielsh: but what if the intermediate variable has the wrong type :p [15:47:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	osse	[15:48:49] > str1=a,b,c; str2=${(s:,:)str1}; echo ${(t)str2} [15:48:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	machabot	[15:48:49] osse: scalar [15:48:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:32:42] howdy folks, when i try to do history -i I get fc: event not found: -i [17:32:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:32:48] same goes for -E [17:32:48]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:33:15] am i not specifying my parameter correctly? [17:33:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	thrig	[17:35:35] is there anything in the history? [17:35:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:35:59] yes [17:35:59]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:37:13] oh it's an alias [17:37:13]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:37:36] history is an alias for fc -l 1 [17:37:36]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:37:47] that's ... interesting [17:37:47]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[17:38:27] bash compatibility ? [17:38:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	 *	mortal1 [17:39:22] shrugs [17:39:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:39:41] i should note that this is on os x, oh my zsh stuff [17:39:41]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:39:54] i just added an alias to my .zshrc to fix it [17:39:54]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[17:40:16] !omz [17:40:16]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	machabot	[17:40:17] "omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the channel #oh-my-zsh. [17:40:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:41:00] :^) I figured that'd be the response [17:41:00]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[17:43:01] It's a recurring pattern, odd problems turn out to be omz defaults. [17:43:01]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[17:43:20] that* [17:43:20]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:39:14] so I display the last exit code in my prompt [18:39:14]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:39:28] and when I start up a new shell, the exit code is reported as 1, so something in my startup is boned [18:39:28]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:39:31] how do I figure out what it is? [18:39:31]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	thrig	[18:39:49] what's the last line in your rc files? [18:39:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:40:02] one sec [18:40:02]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:40:21] it's "alias e='$EDITOR $HOME/.zshrc'" lol [18:40:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	osse	[18:41:18] pikajude: run 'set -x'. what's the last few lines reported ? [18:41:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:42:05] https://gist.github.com/pikajude/9651e46761df223c0f376805e2f358b5 [18:42:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:42:15] abbrev_path is a function I wrote to abbreviate $PWD before i show it in my prompt [18:42:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:42:35] oh snap! i totally found it [18:42:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:42:48] it was the line BEFORE that block. sneaky rvm installed a .zlogin file that I didn't want [18:42:48]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:42:55] thanks anyway everyone [18:42:55]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ZeroKnight	[01:17:49] FWIW the history alias from this morning is indeed an omz default [01:17:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[01:42:54] bapt, I just pushed the patch you'd added to the port yesterday, it'll be in 5.3 [01:42:54]

2016-10-18 00:14:27	machabot	[17:40:17] "omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the channel #oh-my-zsh. [17:40:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:27	mortal1	[17:41:00] :^) I figured that'd be the response [17:41:00]

2016-10-18 06:38:58	Bengi_	Hello, I have a custom color for my prompt hostname if I SSH into a machine (hostname turns red). But if I'm in the machine and then do "sudo su" to be root, the hostname goes back to normal color as if I wasn't in SSH anymore. Is their a special hook in zsh for that?
2016-10-18 06:40:02	phy1729	You could set root's dotfiles to mirror yours or export PS1, but using sudo more is likely a better solution.
2016-10-18 06:40:54	thrig	arguments with other admins over how the prompt should be blinged in 3, 2
2016-10-18 06:41:52	phy1729	Reply from Bengi_ that this is for his local box in 3, 2
2016-10-18 06:42:03	Bengi_	^
2016-10-18 06:42:09	danielsh	considering that you're switching to root you can have root's shell check if $SSH_* is present in the environment of $PPID
2016-10-18 06:42:35	Bengi_	I didnt know there was a convention for what a server prompt should be?
2016-10-18 06:42:36	thrig	unless sudo stripped that stuff
2016-10-18 06:42:39	danielsh	Or you can assign a fixed color per host
2016-10-18 06:42:46	danielsh	thrig, ps -e -p $PPID
2016-10-18 06:43:28	thrig	conventions are site-specific (I disable colors)

2016-10-18 23:55:25	kke	[08:23:31] there has to be something like that, otherwise you couldn't know if you're trying to complete in the middle of the current cmd line [08:23:31]
2016-10-18 23:55:25	osse	[08:24:33] pretty sure there is. I just don't know the name of it [08:24:33]

2016-10-18 23:55:25	kke	[09:15:41] but returning pretty completions isn't as easy as returning a list such as "subcommand:Description" or "--foo[set foo]" [09:15:41]
2016-10-18 23:55:25	kke	[09:16:32] no idea how it should work. maybe i'll just stick with ugly completions. [09:16:32]

2016-10-18 23:55:25	kke	[09:19:42] yep, i tried calling _arguments and it said _arguments:comparguments:313: can only be called from completion function [09:19:42]

2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:08:56] anyone familiar with the completion system? i've made an external program to handle all completions, i have it working with bash and with zsh using bashcompinit, but i'd like to return prettier completions with descriptions for zsh. my script currently works like: "complete idx=$COMP_CWORD $COMP_WORDS[*]" for bash, so the word index is the first arg and the words on current command line come after that. the completer function for bash looks like this: ... [08:08:56]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:09:02] ... https://gist.github.com/kke/f9149402b89d09d0e23b7fabdbf906a0 [08:09:02]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:10:06] when reading about zsh completions i run into these predefined functions and helpers and what not, how do i skip all that and just run my external program? [08:10:06]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	osse	[08:19:10] kke: do you mean overriding the whole completion system? [08:19:10]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	osse	[08:19:17] or for a specific completion? [08:19:17]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:20:10] just for the completions of my own app [08:20:10]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	osse	[08:20:23] _ownapp() { your program } [08:20:23]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:21:05] is there something like $COMP_CWORD and $COMP_WORDS[*] in bash? [08:21:05]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:21:34] so that i could do _ownapp() { my-program idx=$COMP_CWORD $COMP_WORDS[*] } [08:21:34]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	osse	[08:22:11] $COMP_WORDS is $words I think [08:22:11]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	osse	[08:22:16] current word, not sure [08:22:16]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:23:31] there has to be something like that, otherwise you couldn't know if you're trying to complete in the middle of the current cmd line [08:23:31]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	osse	[08:24:33] pretty sure there is. I just don't know the name of it [08:24:33]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:25:35] maybe $CURRENT [08:25:35]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	osse	[08:26:23] i think that's it [08:26:23]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:27:53] found this: http://blogs.perl.org/users/perlancar/2014/11/comparing-programmable-tab-completion-in-bash-zsh-tcsh-and-fish.html [08:27:53]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:28:09] mycompleter() { read -l; local cl="$REPLY"; read -ln; local cp="$REPLY"; reply=(`COMP_SHELL=zsh COMP_LINE="$cl" COMP_POINT="$cp" mycompleter`) } [08:28:09]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:29:21] strange, but i guess it can work. i'll see. [08:29:21]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:31:56] read:4: option valid only in functions called via compctl [08:31:56]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:31:59] hmph [08:31:59]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:47:16] ah. almost works now [08:47:16]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[09:15:41] but returning pretty completions isn't as easy as returning a list such as "subcommand:Description" or "--foo[set foo]" [09:15:41]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[09:16:32] no idea how it should work. maybe i'll just stick with ugly completions. [09:16:32]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	danielsh	[09:16:39] s/isn't/is/;  s/returning a list/calling a function with arguments/ [09:16:39]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	danielsh	[09:17:16] tl;dr: _description, _arguments, _describe, Etc/completion-style-guide (sorry for braindump) [09:17:16]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[09:19:42] yep, i tried calling _arguments and it said _arguments:comparguments:313: can only be called from completion function [09:19:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	danielsh	[09:22:28] _f() { _arguments : -x:_users } ; compdef _f f [09:22:28]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[09:23:04] yes and what if the completion list comes from an external program? [09:23:04]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	danielsh	[09:25:33] $() of course [09:25:33]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	danielsh	[09:25:41] if you're invoking the program that's being completed see _call_program [09:25:41]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	danielsh	[09:26:11] (again, sorry for terseness, don't have time to be verbose :() [09:26:11]

For example when I try to run `autoload -U compinit && compinit` I get the following error: `zsh: compinit: function definition file not found`

2016-10-19 08:15:25	havelock	what features does --enable-pcre add to the zsh binary?  Does it make it so you can do more advanced history searching with C-r?
2016-10-19 08:17:06	Walex	havelock: "advanced" is a matter of judgement. PCRE is the regexp engine of Perl.
2016-10-19 08:17:56	thrig	no, it is a library that implements an engine that is like perl but different

2016-10-19 08:19:34	havelock	Walex: right, I'm familiar with what PCRE is, but right now I'm trying to rebuild zsh with some different options to see if that helps with my earlier `function defintions not found` problem and for some reason zsh is hanging on startup and only continues when I send SIGINT.
2016-10-19 08:22:12	havelock	so I thought its either the fact that I have to manually tell Zsh where to find libpcre or it's something in my .zshrc file

2016-10-19 11:23:05	ZeroKnight	So I noticed a bug--or at the least a discrepancy with the manual--with the _expand completer, in that the all-expansions tag does not expand %o in the format style like the expansions tag does. Line 1515 of zshcompsys(1) mentions that %o will be expanded in both tags, but in practice all-expansions does not expand %o
2016-10-19 11:23:49	danielsh	(line number in man pages depend on version number, terminal width, and the phase of the moon)
2016-10-19 11:24:56	ZeroKnight	true, sorry
2016-10-19 11:25:30	ZeroKnight	it's under the description for the _expand completer, specifically: The format string for all-expansions and for expansions may contain the sequence `%o' which will be replaced by the original string from the line.
2016-10-19 11:25:45	danielsh	found it, thanks
2016-10-19 11:26:04	danielsh	I can't get %o to trigger in either case, though... I don't suppose you have a minimal example?
2016-10-19 11:26:22	danielsh	zsh -f \n autoload compinit \n compinit \n bindkey $'\t' complete-word \n zstyle ... completer ... \n etc
2016-10-19 11:28:15	ZeroKnight	assuming _expand is in your completers, and TAB is bound to complete-word, zstyle ':completion:*:*expansions' format '%d for %o', and the command line: % print $PWD<TAB>
2016-10-19 11:28:45	danielsh	My bad, I tested _match :(
2016-10-19 11:28:47	ZeroKnight	you would get: expansions for $PWD [results], and: all-expansions for <nothing here> [results]
2016-10-19 11:29:45	ZeroKnight	forgot to mention, I'm using zsh 5.2

2016-10-19 14:34:41	ZeroKnight	[21:23:05] So I noticed a bug--or at the least a discrepancy with the manual--with the _expand completer, in that the all-expansions tag does not expand %o in the format style like the expansions tag does. Line 1515 of zshcompsys(1) mentions that %o will be expanded in both tags, but in practice all-expansions does not expand %o [21:23:05]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	danielsh	[21:23:49] (line number in man pages depend on version number, terminal width, and the phase of the moon) [21:23:49]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	ZeroKnight	[21:24:56] true, sorry [21:24:56]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	ZeroKnight	[21:25:30] it's under the description for the _expand completer, specifically: The format string for all-expansions and for expansions may contain the sequence `%o' which will be replaced by the original string from the line. [21:25:30]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	danielsh	[21:25:45] found it, thanks [21:25:45]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	danielsh	[21:26:04] I can't get %o to trigger in either case, though... I don't suppose you have a minimal example? [21:26:04]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	danielsh	[21:26:22] zsh -f \n autoload compinit \n compinit \n bindkey $'\t' complete-word \n zstyle ... completer ... \n etc [21:26:22]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	ZeroKnight	[21:28:15] assuming _expand is in your completers, and TAB is bound to complete-word, zstyle ':completion:*:*expansions' format '%d for %o', and the command line: % print $PWD<TAB> [21:28:15]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	danielsh	[21:28:45] My bad, I tested _match :( [21:28:45]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	ZeroKnight	[21:28:47] you would get: expansions for $PWD [results], and: all-expansions for <nothing here> [results] [21:28:47]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	ZeroKnight	[21:29:45] forgot to mention, I'm using zsh 5.2 [21:29:45]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	ZeroKnight	[21:29:54] but this bug is present upstream as well [21:29:54]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	danielsh	[21:29:54] http://sprunge.us/SUOS - latest master [21:29:54]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	danielsh	[21:30:18] in the paste, the : is the command, so $HOME is in argv[1] position [21:30:18]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	danielsh	[21:31:59] ah, repro'd: http://sprunge.us/ATeA [21:31:59]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	danielsh	[21:32:41] ZeroKnight, I agree it's a bug, could you please report it to zsh-workers@zsh.org ? [21:32:41]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	ZeroKnight	[21:33:03] danielsh: Sure thing, thank you for helping confirm [21:33:03]

2016-10-19 14:34:41	danielsh	[21:35:38] ZeroKnight, the answer varies by project.  In zsh's case, if you don't subscribe then just ask to be CC'd on replies. [21:35:38]
2016-10-19 14:34:42	ZeroKnight	[21:37:56] danielsh: okay, thanks. I found a page explaining the basics. Will report back after submitting [21:37:56]

2016-10-19 15:54:11	Guest17358	When I press Enter on my numpad, instead of executing my command, it puts the command down a line and the capital letter M appears on the first line. This means I get "command not found: M" when going back to using the normal enter key. How can I fix it so that numpad enter executes my command?

2016-10-19 16:10:45	llua	yea, your enter key is sending a weird keycode
2016-10-19 16:11:21	llua	you could bindkey it accept-line, or find out why your enter key isn't sending ^m
2016-10-19 16:11:50	llua	and you can paste the output of commands here instead of screenshotting it
2016-10-19 16:12:06	llua	assuming the output is fewer than like 5 lines
2016-10-19 16:12:26	llua	you could bind it to*
2016-10-19 16:12:43	Guest17358	llua: using xev, it sends keycode 104
2016-10-19 16:15:15	Guest17358	llua: sorry, but what is the zshrc line to bindkey it accept-line?
2016-10-19 16:16:05	llua	run the second bindkey you ran, but append the word accept-line to it
2016-10-19 16:17:07	llua	but i kinda doubt your numpad enter key works with other programs, binding it in zsh seems like a hack.

2016-10-19 18:57:33	ZeroKnight	You're right, my thought process was foobar. only tags that have matches will show their descriptions (if enabled), but as far as a style that toggles whether or not they show if they're the only tag that matched, I'm quite certain that there is no such style
2016-10-19 18:59:23	ZeroKnight	glancing at some of the completers, they make no such checks for a style like that. when a tag matches the completer spits the matches for that tag, and a description that adheres to the format style (or a default) if they're enabled

2016-10-19 19:48:24	OODani	Aww. I guess that's something else I might patch if I ever feel brave enough to look at the zsh source. ;)
2016-10-19 19:51:25	ZeroKnight	OODani: well in this case you wouldn't have to touch the source code, just the completion functions (it's all in zsh)
2016-10-19 19:51:50	ZeroKnight	whether that's more or less motivation is dependent on you :P
2016-10-19 19:52:11	OODani	That probably helps. I tend to like not seeing pointers. :P
2016-10-19 19:52:25	ZeroKnight	OODani: at the very least you could mention these topics on the mailing list, they might get attention from the maintainers
2016-10-19 19:52:49	ZeroKnight	if you were so inclined

2016-10-19 19:56:30	OODani	Hmm, yet another question. I have the normal list/menu stuff active, where one <Tab> lists and the second <Tab> starts menuing and that works fine, except when the list is too big for the screen. select-prompt is set so menus are scrollable, but if I set list-prompt I have to tab through the list first and *then* menu completion starts, and if I don't set list-prompt I get the "do you wish to see all 472
2016-10-19 19:56:32	OODani	possibilities?" message. The ideal behaviour would be "see the first page when I hit <Tab>, and when I hit <Tab> again immediately go into menu selection". Is that doable? The manual says that there's a keymap for list scrolling (called listscroll, naturally) so I tried to add to that but got no such keymap `listscroll'.

2016-10-19 20:13:45	ZeroKnight	it's not exactly what you want; you'll have to hit tab twice, but at least you don't have to scroll through the whole list if you don't want to
2016-10-19 20:14:15	ZeroKnight	that's the best I could come up with given what the manual provides
2016-10-19 20:15:07	ZeroKnight	so it'll behave like: "see the first page when you hit <Tab>, hit <Tab> twice to immediately go into menu selection

2016-10-19 20:17:04	OODani	Ooo, so I built on that a little. Now I've got this widget: listscroll-start-menu() { zle send-break && zle menu-complete }
2016-10-19 20:17:26	OODani	The only problem is that the menu shows your last prompt at the top and the list doesn't, so there's a weird bit of jumpiness onscreen.

2016-10-19 20:18:41	ZeroKnight	going to add this to my own config
2016-10-19 20:18:46	OODani	Niiiice. I wasn't sure whether you were allowed to chain commands in a bindkey without actually defining a widget for them.
2016-10-19 20:18:56	ZeroKnight	me neither until just now
2016-10-19 20:19:16	OODani	Still has that weird jumpiness between the list and the menu though. Not sure that can be worked around without some core-ish changes to the components involved. :P
2016-10-19 20:21:15	ZeroKnight	I don't think so

2016-10-19 20:21:22	ZeroKnight	I can live with it though

2016-10-19 20:22:20	ZeroKnight	OODani: no problem, thanks for inquiring; learned some things myself :)
