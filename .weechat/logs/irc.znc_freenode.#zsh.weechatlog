2016-10-17 21:03:37	osse	[15:40:42] ahh [15:40:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	osse	[15:40:58] yeah you just have to magically get into the manpage author's head on that one [15:40:58]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	vbernat	[15:41:08] ok :) [15:41:08]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[15:46:04] you can put a breakpoint in paramsubst and check isarr [15:46:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[15:46:11] or you can use an intermediate variable [15:46:11]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[15:46:21] One of these ways is guaranteed to preserve your sanity. [15:46:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[15:46:41] (the second one) [15:46:41]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	osse	[15:47:42] danielsh: but what if the intermediate variable has the wrong type :p [15:47:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	osse	[15:48:49] > str1=a,b,c; str2=${(s:,:)str1}; echo ${(t)str2} [15:48:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	machabot	[15:48:49] osse: scalar [15:48:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:32:42] howdy folks, when i try to do history -i I get fc: event not found: -i [17:32:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:32:48] same goes for -E [17:32:48]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:33:15] am i not specifying my parameter correctly? [17:33:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	thrig	[17:35:35] is there anything in the history? [17:35:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:35:59] yes [17:35:59]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:37:13] oh it's an alias [17:37:13]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:37:36] history is an alias for fc -l 1 [17:37:36]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:37:47] that's ... interesting [17:37:47]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[17:38:27] bash compatibility ? [17:38:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	 *	mortal1 [17:39:22] shrugs [17:39:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:39:41] i should note that this is on os x, oh my zsh stuff [17:39:41]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:39:54] i just added an alias to my .zshrc to fix it [17:39:54]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[17:40:16] !omz [17:40:16]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	machabot	[17:40:17] "omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the channel #oh-my-zsh. [17:40:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:41:00] :^) I figured that'd be the response [17:41:00]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[17:43:01] It's a recurring pattern, odd problems turn out to be omz defaults. [17:43:01]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[17:43:20] that* [17:43:20]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:39:14] so I display the last exit code in my prompt [18:39:14]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:39:28] and when I start up a new shell, the exit code is reported as 1, so something in my startup is boned [18:39:28]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:39:31] how do I figure out what it is? [18:39:31]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	thrig	[18:39:49] what's the last line in your rc files? [18:39:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:40:02] one sec [18:40:02]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:40:21] it's "alias e='$EDITOR $HOME/.zshrc'" lol [18:40:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	osse	[18:41:18] pikajude: run 'set -x'. what's the last few lines reported ? [18:41:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:42:05] https://gist.github.com/pikajude/9651e46761df223c0f376805e2f358b5 [18:42:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:42:15] abbrev_path is a function I wrote to abbreviate $PWD before i show it in my prompt [18:42:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:42:35] oh snap! i totally found it [18:42:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:42:48] it was the line BEFORE that block. sneaky rvm installed a .zlogin file that I didn't want [18:42:48]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:42:55] thanks anyway everyone [18:42:55]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ZeroKnight	[01:17:49] FWIW the history alias from this morning is indeed an omz default [01:17:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[01:42:54] bapt, I just pushed the patch you'd added to the port yesterday, it'll be in 5.3 [01:42:54]

2016-10-18 00:14:27	machabot	[17:40:17] "omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the channel #oh-my-zsh. [17:40:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:27	mortal1	[17:41:00] :^) I figured that'd be the response [17:41:00]

2016-10-18 06:38:58	Bengi_	Hello, I have a custom color for my prompt hostname if I SSH into a machine (hostname turns red). But if I'm in the machine and then do "sudo su" to be root, the hostname goes back to normal color as if I wasn't in SSH anymore. Is their a special hook in zsh for that?
2016-10-18 06:40:02	phy1729	You could set root's dotfiles to mirror yours or export PS1, but using sudo more is likely a better solution.
2016-10-18 06:40:54	thrig	arguments with other admins over how the prompt should be blinged in 3, 2
2016-10-18 06:41:52	phy1729	Reply from Bengi_ that this is for his local box in 3, 2
2016-10-18 06:42:03	Bengi_	^
2016-10-18 06:42:09	danielsh	considering that you're switching to root you can have root's shell check if $SSH_* is present in the environment of $PPID
2016-10-18 06:42:35	Bengi_	I didnt know there was a convention for what a server prompt should be?
2016-10-18 06:42:36	thrig	unless sudo stripped that stuff
2016-10-18 06:42:39	danielsh	Or you can assign a fixed color per host
2016-10-18 06:42:46	danielsh	thrig, ps -e -p $PPID
2016-10-18 06:43:28	thrig	conventions are site-specific (I disable colors)

2016-10-18 23:55:25	kke	[08:23:31] there has to be something like that, otherwise you couldn't know if you're trying to complete in the middle of the current cmd line [08:23:31]
2016-10-18 23:55:25	osse	[08:24:33] pretty sure there is. I just don't know the name of it [08:24:33]

2016-10-18 23:55:25	kke	[09:15:41] but returning pretty completions isn't as easy as returning a list such as "subcommand:Description" or "--foo[set foo]" [09:15:41]
2016-10-18 23:55:25	kke	[09:16:32] no idea how it should work. maybe i'll just stick with ugly completions. [09:16:32]

2016-10-18 23:55:25	kke	[09:19:42] yep, i tried calling _arguments and it said _arguments:comparguments:313: can only be called from completion function [09:19:42]

2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:08:56] anyone familiar with the completion system? i've made an external program to handle all completions, i have it working with bash and with zsh using bashcompinit, but i'd like to return prettier completions with descriptions for zsh. my script currently works like: "complete idx=$COMP_CWORD $COMP_WORDS[*]" for bash, so the word index is the first arg and the words on current command line come after that. the completer function for bash looks like this: ... [08:08:56]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:09:02] ... https://gist.github.com/kke/f9149402b89d09d0e23b7fabdbf906a0 [08:09:02]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:10:06] when reading about zsh completions i run into these predefined functions and helpers and what not, how do i skip all that and just run my external program? [08:10:06]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	osse	[08:19:10] kke: do you mean overriding the whole completion system? [08:19:10]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	osse	[08:19:17] or for a specific completion? [08:19:17]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:20:10] just for the completions of my own app [08:20:10]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	osse	[08:20:23] _ownapp() { your program } [08:20:23]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:21:05] is there something like $COMP_CWORD and $COMP_WORDS[*] in bash? [08:21:05]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:21:34] so that i could do _ownapp() { my-program idx=$COMP_CWORD $COMP_WORDS[*] } [08:21:34]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	osse	[08:22:11] $COMP_WORDS is $words I think [08:22:11]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	osse	[08:22:16] current word, not sure [08:22:16]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:23:31] there has to be something like that, otherwise you couldn't know if you're trying to complete in the middle of the current cmd line [08:23:31]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	osse	[08:24:33] pretty sure there is. I just don't know the name of it [08:24:33]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:25:35] maybe $CURRENT [08:25:35]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	osse	[08:26:23] i think that's it [08:26:23]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:27:53] found this: http://blogs.perl.org/users/perlancar/2014/11/comparing-programmable-tab-completion-in-bash-zsh-tcsh-and-fish.html [08:27:53]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:28:09] mycompleter() { read -l; local cl="$REPLY"; read -ln; local cp="$REPLY"; reply=(`COMP_SHELL=zsh COMP_LINE="$cl" COMP_POINT="$cp" mycompleter`) } [08:28:09]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:29:21] strange, but i guess it can work. i'll see. [08:29:21]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:31:56] read:4: option valid only in functions called via compctl [08:31:56]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:31:59] hmph [08:31:59]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[08:47:16] ah. almost works now [08:47:16]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[09:15:41] but returning pretty completions isn't as easy as returning a list such as "subcommand:Description" or "--foo[set foo]" [09:15:41]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[09:16:32] no idea how it should work. maybe i'll just stick with ugly completions. [09:16:32]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	danielsh	[09:16:39] s/isn't/is/;  s/returning a list/calling a function with arguments/ [09:16:39]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	danielsh	[09:17:16] tl;dr: _description, _arguments, _describe, Etc/completion-style-guide (sorry for braindump) [09:17:16]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[09:19:42] yep, i tried calling _arguments and it said _arguments:comparguments:313: can only be called from completion function [09:19:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	danielsh	[09:22:28] _f() { _arguments : -x:_users } ; compdef _f f [09:22:28]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	kke	[09:23:04] yes and what if the completion list comes from an external program? [09:23:04]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	danielsh	[09:25:33] $() of course [09:25:33]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	danielsh	[09:25:41] if you're invoking the program that's being completed see _call_program [09:25:41]
2016-10-19 00:41:30	danielsh	[09:26:11] (again, sorry for terseness, don't have time to be verbose :() [09:26:11]

For example when I try to run `autoload -U compinit && compinit` I get the following error: `zsh: compinit: function definition file not found`

2016-10-19 08:15:25	havelock	what features does --enable-pcre add to the zsh binary?  Does it make it so you can do more advanced history searching with C-r?
2016-10-19 08:17:06	Walex	havelock: "advanced" is a matter of judgement. PCRE is the regexp engine of Perl.
2016-10-19 08:17:56	thrig	no, it is a library that implements an engine that is like perl but different

2016-10-19 08:19:34	havelock	Walex: right, I'm familiar with what PCRE is, but right now I'm trying to rebuild zsh with some different options to see if that helps with my earlier `function defintions not found` problem and for some reason zsh is hanging on startup and only continues when I send SIGINT.
2016-10-19 08:22:12	havelock	so I thought its either the fact that I have to manually tell Zsh where to find libpcre or it's something in my .zshrc file

2016-10-19 11:23:05	ZeroKnight	So I noticed a bug--or at the least a discrepancy with the manual--with the _expand completer, in that the all-expansions tag does not expand %o in the format style like the expansions tag does. Line 1515 of zshcompsys(1) mentions that %o will be expanded in both tags, but in practice all-expansions does not expand %o
2016-10-19 11:23:49	danielsh	(line number in man pages depend on version number, terminal width, and the phase of the moon)
2016-10-19 11:24:56	ZeroKnight	true, sorry
2016-10-19 11:25:30	ZeroKnight	it's under the description for the _expand completer, specifically: The format string for all-expansions and for expansions may contain the sequence `%o' which will be replaced by the original string from the line.
2016-10-19 11:25:45	danielsh	found it, thanks
2016-10-19 11:26:04	danielsh	I can't get %o to trigger in either case, though... I don't suppose you have a minimal example?
2016-10-19 11:26:22	danielsh	zsh -f \n autoload compinit \n compinit \n bindkey $'\t' complete-word \n zstyle ... completer ... \n etc
2016-10-19 11:28:15	ZeroKnight	assuming _expand is in your completers, and TAB is bound to complete-word, zstyle ':completion:*:*expansions' format '%d for %o', and the command line: % print $PWD<TAB>
2016-10-19 11:28:45	danielsh	My bad, I tested _match :(
2016-10-19 11:28:47	ZeroKnight	you would get: expansions for $PWD [results], and: all-expansions for <nothing here> [results]
2016-10-19 11:29:45	ZeroKnight	forgot to mention, I'm using zsh 5.2

2016-10-19 14:34:41	ZeroKnight	[21:23:05] So I noticed a bug--or at the least a discrepancy with the manual--with the _expand completer, in that the all-expansions tag does not expand %o in the format style like the expansions tag does. Line 1515 of zshcompsys(1) mentions that %o will be expanded in both tags, but in practice all-expansions does not expand %o [21:23:05]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	danielsh	[21:23:49] (line number in man pages depend on version number, terminal width, and the phase of the moon) [21:23:49]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	ZeroKnight	[21:24:56] true, sorry [21:24:56]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	ZeroKnight	[21:25:30] it's under the description for the _expand completer, specifically: The format string for all-expansions and for expansions may contain the sequence `%o' which will be replaced by the original string from the line. [21:25:30]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	danielsh	[21:25:45] found it, thanks [21:25:45]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	danielsh	[21:26:04] I can't get %o to trigger in either case, though... I don't suppose you have a minimal example? [21:26:04]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	danielsh	[21:26:22] zsh -f \n autoload compinit \n compinit \n bindkey $'\t' complete-word \n zstyle ... completer ... \n etc [21:26:22]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	ZeroKnight	[21:28:15] assuming _expand is in your completers, and TAB is bound to complete-word, zstyle ':completion:*:*expansions' format '%d for %o', and the command line: % print $PWD<TAB> [21:28:15]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	danielsh	[21:28:45] My bad, I tested _match :( [21:28:45]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	ZeroKnight	[21:28:47] you would get: expansions for $PWD [results], and: all-expansions for <nothing here> [results] [21:28:47]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	ZeroKnight	[21:29:45] forgot to mention, I'm using zsh 5.2 [21:29:45]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	ZeroKnight	[21:29:54] but this bug is present upstream as well [21:29:54]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	danielsh	[21:29:54] http://sprunge.us/SUOS - latest master [21:29:54]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	danielsh	[21:30:18] in the paste, the : is the command, so $HOME is in argv[1] position [21:30:18]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	danielsh	[21:31:59] ah, repro'd: http://sprunge.us/ATeA [21:31:59]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	danielsh	[21:32:41] ZeroKnight, I agree it's a bug, could you please report it to zsh-workers@zsh.org ? [21:32:41]
2016-10-19 14:34:41	ZeroKnight	[21:33:03] danielsh: Sure thing, thank you for helping confirm [21:33:03]

2016-10-19 14:34:41	danielsh	[21:35:38] ZeroKnight, the answer varies by project.  In zsh's case, if you don't subscribe then just ask to be CC'd on replies. [21:35:38]
2016-10-19 14:34:42	ZeroKnight	[21:37:56] danielsh: okay, thanks. I found a page explaining the basics. Will report back after submitting [21:37:56]

2016-10-19 15:54:11	Guest17358	When I press Enter on my numpad, instead of executing my command, it puts the command down a line and the capital letter M appears on the first line. This means I get "command not found: M" when going back to using the normal enter key. How can I fix it so that numpad enter executes my command?

2016-10-19 16:10:45	llua	yea, your enter key is sending a weird keycode
2016-10-19 16:11:21	llua	you could bindkey it accept-line, or find out why your enter key isn't sending ^m
2016-10-19 16:11:50	llua	and you can paste the output of commands here instead of screenshotting it
2016-10-19 16:12:06	llua	assuming the output is fewer than like 5 lines
2016-10-19 16:12:26	llua	you could bind it to*
2016-10-19 16:12:43	Guest17358	llua: using xev, it sends keycode 104
2016-10-19 16:15:15	Guest17358	llua: sorry, but what is the zshrc line to bindkey it accept-line?
2016-10-19 16:16:05	llua	run the second bindkey you ran, but append the word accept-line to it
2016-10-19 16:17:07	llua	but i kinda doubt your numpad enter key works with other programs, binding it in zsh seems like a hack.

2016-10-19 18:57:33	ZeroKnight	You're right, my thought process was foobar. only tags that have matches will show their descriptions (if enabled), but as far as a style that toggles whether or not they show if they're the only tag that matched, I'm quite certain that there is no such style
2016-10-19 18:59:23	ZeroKnight	glancing at some of the completers, they make no such checks for a style like that. when a tag matches the completer spits the matches for that tag, and a description that adheres to the format style (or a default) if they're enabled

2016-10-19 19:51:25	ZeroKnight	OODani: well in this case you wouldn't have to touch the source code, just the completion functions (it's all in zsh)

2016-10-19 19:56:30	OODani	Hmm, yet another question. I have the normal list/menu stuff active, where one <Tab> lists and the second <Tab> starts menuing and that works fine, except when the list is too big for the screen. select-prompt is set so menus are scrollable, but if I set list-prompt I have to tab through the list first and *then* menu completion starts, and if I don't set list-prompt I get the "do you wish to see all 472
2016-10-19 19:56:32	OODani	possibilities?" message. The ideal behaviour would be "see the first page when I hit <Tab>, and when I hit <Tab> again immediately go into menu selection". Is that doable? The manual says that there's a keymap for list scrolling (called listscroll, naturally) so I tried to add to that but got no such keymap `listscroll'.

2016-10-19 20:40:06	Guest17358	[02:24:45] llua: hmm that bindkey fix works when I type it in the console, but not when I add it to .zshrc. Also, when I run zsh -f to disable all config files I have no problem. [02:24:45]
2016-10-19 20:40:06	Guest17358	[02:25:01] I found something online indicating that the file /etc/zsh/zshrc causes the problem, but can't find a line that would caus ethe problem [02:25:01]

2016-10-19 20:40:06	zayita	[02:26:27] llua: ''DEBIAN_PREVENT_KEYBOARD_CHANGES=yes'' stops debians global zshrc from setting the terminal into keyboard-transmit-mode. disabling keyboard-transmit-mode may not be desireable, http://www.zsh.org/mla/users/2014/msg00569.html [02:26:27]
2016-10-19 20:40:06	llua	[02:28:06] Guest17358: replace the ^[ with \e [02:28:06]
2016-10-19 20:40:06	llua	[02:28:44] since you aren't typing a literal ^[ i bet [02:28:44]
2016-10-19 20:40:06	Guest17358	[02:30:20] llua: fixed it - I had 'bindkey -v' in my .zshrc - [02:30:20]
2016-10-19 20:40:06	Guest17358	[02:30:40]  not sure why, but removing it along with adding the bindkey thing fixed it [02:30:40]
2016-10-19 20:40:06	Guest17358	[02:31:10] didn't need to change ^[ to \e though- it was literal in vim [02:31:10]
2016-10-19 20:40:06	llua	[02:32:32] so you had the new bind above bindkey -v, which switched the current keymap away from the keymap you bound accept-line to [02:32:32]
2016-10-19 20:40:06	Guest17358	[02:33:22] llua: Ah I see. And in fact I do want the 'bindkey -v' for vim mode, so it is all working now that I have the bindkey fix after bindkey -v in my .zshrc. Thanks for that [02:33:22]
2016-10-19 20:40:06	OODani	[03:58:25] Is there a zstyle I can give the completion system, along with group-name '' and format, to specify "only display the group descriptions/headings if there's more than one group"? [03:58:25]
2016-10-19 20:40:06	ZeroKnight	[04:50:01] OODani: I could be wrong, but I believe that's not how the completion system works. it will try every tag specified by the completion function or what is set with tag-order you end up getting the formatted description for each tag tried. the completion system can't know ahead of time what tags will actually return anything [04:50:01]
2016-10-19 20:40:06	ZeroKnight	[04:50:44] s/tag-order/tag-order and/ [04:50:44]
2016-10-19 20:40:06	OODani	[04:52:46] Hmm, I don't see "empty" group headings, though, so presumably it knows there's nothing in those groups at least enough not to show the heading? [04:52:46]
2016-10-19 20:40:06	OODani	[04:54:18] For instance, p<TAB> gives external commands, aliases, shell functions, builtins, and parameters, but changing to pw<TAB> only gives external and builtin, with no extra headings for the other three groups that are empty. [04:54:18]
2016-10-19 20:40:06	ZeroKnight	[04:57:33] You're right, my thought process was foobar. only tags that have matches will show their descriptions (if enabled), but as far as a style that toggles whether or not they show if they're the only tag that matched, I'm quite certain that there is no such style [04:57:33]
2016-10-19 20:40:06	ZeroKnight	[04:59:23] glancing at some of the completers, they make no such checks for a style like that. when a tag matches the completer spits the matches for that tag, and a description that adheres to the format style (or a default) if they're enabled [04:59:23]
2016-10-19 20:40:06	ZeroKnight	[05:00:29] unfortunately, I don't believe you would be able to achieve what you're looking for without adding checks in the completers for how many tags matched, as well as a style to control the display of the singular match [05:00:29]
2016-10-19 20:40:06	OODani	[05:05:45] Ah, fair enough. All good. :) [05:05:45]
2016-10-19 20:40:06	ZeroKnight	[05:06:55] it's not a bad idea though. if you're feeling adventurous, you could always create a patch :) [05:06:55]
2016-10-19 20:40:06	OODani	[05:07:35] Oh, also: I've enabled show-ambiguity and it seems to be overriding list-colors, i.e., the entire item becomes colourless except the show-ambiguity character. Can I configure the two to play nicely, so that the rest of the item stays list-colors coloured? [05:07:35]
2016-10-19 20:40:06	ZeroKnight	[05:47:34] OODani: from what I can tell, no; they have not (yet) been made compatible. sorry to be the bearer of bad news [05:47:34]

2016-10-20 00:25:36	OODani	[06:18:46] Niiiice. I wasn't sure whether you were allowed to chain commands in a bindkey without actually defining a widget for them. [06:18:46]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	ZeroKnight	[06:18:56] me neither until just now [06:18:56]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	OODani	[06:19:16] Still has that weird jumpiness between the list and the menu though. Not sure that can be worked around without some core-ish changes to the components involved. :P [06:19:16]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	ZeroKnight	[06:21:15] I don't think so [06:21:15]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	ZeroKnight	[06:21:22] I can live with it though [06:21:22]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	OODani	[06:22:03] Yeah, me too. :3 Thanks for your help! [06:22:03]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	ZeroKnight	[06:22:20] OODani: no problem, thanks for inquiring; learned some things myself :) [06:22:20]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	ZeroKnight	[06:22:36] happy zsh'ing [06:22:36]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	OODani	[06:22:50] >:3 [06:22:50]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	osse	[09:21:57] In MSYS2 when I want to cd to e.g. /c/Users/osse I type 'cd /c/Us<Tab>'. At this point zsh changes /c to /cmd, because in 'ls /' there is no c but there is a cmd. But this works in bash. [09:21:57]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	osse	[09:22:08] Do the shells query the file system in different ways? [09:22:08]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	osse	[09:24:18] Heh, it works as in bash in 'zsh -f'. Time for BSFL [09:24:18]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	psprint_	[09:26:38] BSFL? [09:26:38]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	osse	[09:26:59] Binary Search Fault Localization [09:26:59]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	psprint_	[09:27:47] yeah, zsh -f leads to that, I've discovered some ancient things in zshenv this way [09:27:47]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[09:58:48] I have this issue [09:58:48]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[09:58:50] https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/518 [09:58:50]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[09:58:53] I don't use oh my zsh [09:58:53]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[09:58:55] I use prezto [09:58:55]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[09:58:59] but I deleted the /.zcompdump file [09:58:59]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[09:59:03] and restarted my shell [09:59:03]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[09:59:08] and I still get the error [09:59:08]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[09:59:22] http://i.imgur.com/MR10Udg.png [09:59:22]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[09:59:30] does anyone know how I can fix this [09:59:30]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[09:59:32] thank you [09:59:32]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[10:01:32] or what might cause this [10:01:32]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	psprint_	[10:02:57] I worked on this some time ago with llua but forgot conclusions [10:02:57]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[10:05:36] this is strange [10:05:36]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[10:05:41] I never had that happen before [10:05:41]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	psprint_	[10:06:15] are you sure you don't run compdump after removing ~/.zcompdump file? [10:06:15]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[10:06:16] rm -f ~/.zcompdump* [10:06:16]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[10:06:18] works for everyone [10:06:18]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[10:06:21] and not me [10:06:21]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[10:06:28] what do you mean [10:06:28]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[10:06:37] i just removed the file [10:06:37]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	psprint_	[10:06:42] ok [10:06:42]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[10:06:42] exec zsh [10:06:42]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[10:06:48] open new session of zsh [10:06:48]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[10:06:53] and try again but still get the error [10:06:53]
2016-10-20 00:25:36	nikivi	[10:08:17] anyone else had this issue? [10:08:17]

2016-10-20 04:21:04	nikivi	I have a problem with zsh I think

2016-10-20 04:21:06	nikivi	my autocomplete for vim stopped working for some reason
2016-10-20 04:21:08	nikivi	I get this error : https://i.imgur.com/Rqxyol3.png
2016-10-20 04:21:08	nikivi	can someone help me with it please
2016-10-20 04:21:10	nikivi	I found this online : https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/518
2016-10-20 04:21:21	nikivi	but I did the two lines of code
2016-10-20 04:21:22	nikivi	rm ~/.zcondump*
2016-10-20 04:21:22	nikivi	exec zsh
2016-10-20 04:21:26	nikivi	and that didn't work
2016-10-20 04:22:18	chris2	the file is called .zcompdump
2016-10-20 04:22:39	llua	it is a problem with the compdump function assuming people aren't running it via compinit 8 times during start up like most frameworks do.
2016-10-20 04:23:15	chris2	perhaps we should put !omz into the /topic :P
2016-10-20 04:24:06	thrig	a) nobody reads the topic
2016-10-20 04:24:07	llua	that assumes people read the topic, they normally don't.

2016-10-20 04:32:05	nikivi	still get the error :(
2016-10-20 04:32:10	nikivi	I made it executable too
2016-10-20 04:32:28	tibbs	This is probably a dumb question, but I'm really failing to come up with good search terms.  I'm wondering if it's possible to have a script spawn a couple of background processes and wait, but to have those background processes die if the script itself dies.
2016-10-20 04:32:36	danielsh	no need to make it +x
2016-10-20 04:32:47	nikivi	danielsh oh all right
2016-10-20 04:32:52	nikivi	still though, nothing changed

2016-10-20 04:33:15	danielsh	tibbs, interactively or from cron?  (thinking of SIGHUP)
2016-10-20 04:33:22	tibbs	Interactively.
2016-10-20 04:33:30	llua	nikivi: what does print -r $^fpath/compdump(N) print?
2016-10-20 04:33:40	thrig	how would the "script itself" be dying?
2016-10-20 04:33:53	tibbs	Naively, I just spawn two media players with & that show some rtsp streams, and then call wait.
2016-10-20 04:34:24	tibbs	thrig: If that was to me, either via ctrl-c, or the script being killed, or the window closing, or me logging out of the desktop.
2016-10-20 04:34:25	nikivi	Ilua that prints nothing for me
2016-10-20 04:34:27	nikivi	for some reason
2016-10-20 04:34:41	osse	in that case "nikivi | just did it" is a LIE!
2016-10-20 04:34:44	osse	:3
2016-10-20 04:35:22	danielsh	tibbs, use a trap then?
2016-10-20 04:35:24	thrig	control+c generates a signal that goes to all processes in the foreground process group
2016-10-20 04:35:29	danielsh	One would hope a 'logout' sends a signal too
2016-10-20 04:35:44	lirik	Hi, how can I see default settings list for vcs_info?
2016-10-20 04:35:57	thrig	(unless you're in raw mode, in which case you then read the \003 and then...)
2016-10-20 04:36:25	nikivi	osse I put the file somewhere in my $PATH
2016-10-20 04:36:32	llua	why
2016-10-20 04:36:33	nikivi	in bin directory of .dotfiles
2016-10-20 04:36:40	tibbs	danielsh: I'm vaguely familiar with traps.  I guess catch signals in the script and use that to kill the background processes (whose PIDs I can get from the jobs array, I think).
2016-10-20 04:36:42	llua	why did you ignore the directions
2016-10-20 04:36:48	danielsh	lirik, defaults for the styles are documented in zshcontrib
2016-10-20 04:36:49	nikivi	you said add the file somewhere in your $PATH
2016-10-20 04:36:55	llua	i said fpath
2016-10-20 04:36:58	osse	nikivi: there was an f in front of path in my messages
2016-10-20 04:37:00	llua	there was a f in there
2016-10-20 04:37:04	lirik	danielsh: thank you sir
2016-10-20 04:37:06	danielsh	tibbs, kill %1 works
2016-10-20 04:37:08	danielsh	cheers
2016-10-20 04:37:25	nikivi	Ilua oh, first time I hear of fpath
2016-10-20 04:37:29	danielsh	lirik, you should have suspected something when I told you to chmod -x...
2016-10-20 04:37:29	tibbs	danielsh: I'd assumed that was just the first background job, not all of them.
2016-10-20 04:37:32	nikivi	I'll try add it to fpath
2016-10-20 04:37:40	danielsh	tibbs, kill %${jobnumber}
2016-10-20 04:37:43	nikivi	I hope it is similar to adding things to $PATH
2016-10-20 04:38:52	tibbs	danielsh: Right, I just figured I could iterate to kill all of the jobs instead of hardcoding the number I actually started.
2016-10-20 04:39:17	nikivi	Ilua here it is https://i.imgur.com/jFzxi42.png
2016-10-20 04:39:25	nikivi	I moved the script to one of the paths there
2016-10-20 04:39:28	nikivi	in my fpath
2016-10-20 04:39:33	nikivi	v is alias for mv
2016-10-20 04:39:39	nikivi	and I still get the error
2016-10-20 04:40:21	danielsh	tibbs, I was just trying to say that you don't have to save $! if you use the %42 syntax, that's all
2016-10-20 04:40:49	danielsh	nikivi, have you heard of textual pastebins? :)
2016-10-20 04:40:59	tibbs	Yeah, got it.  I'm just trying to remember of the array that saves them all.  I have some vague recollection that one exists.
2016-10-20 04:41:05	danielsh	$jobs ?
2016-10-20 04:41:21	nikivi	yeah sorry

2016-10-20 04:41:55	nikivi	what can the cause of this be?
2016-10-20 04:41:57	tibbs	Yeah, I'm just going through man zshall looking for "jobs".

2016-10-20 08:37:54	derf0	pterodactyl: It's different in bash than in zsh because some shells just output the original string (with * and everything) if they don't find a matching file (so it works in bash), while zsh by default reports an error in that case

2016-10-20 13:48:46	danielsh	OODani, it's slightly trickier though, sometimes there are bugs that only occur when the UTF-8 encoding has a particular byte value.

2016-10-20 13:49:38	OODani	I guess it must be something specific to list-colors?

2016-10-20 13:52:18	danielsh	fwiw, I use list-colors with an eliding http://www.zsh.org/cgi-bin/mla/redirect?WORKERNUMBER=38518

2016-10-20 13:54:52	OODani	Hmm, that ellipsis trick isn't *matching* on a multibyte char, maybe the rules are different for patterns and substitutions.
2016-10-20 13:56:11	danielsh	OODani, I can reproduce that
2016-10-20 13:56:26	danielsh	it matches with "xxx" and with "©" but not with your character
2016-10-20 13:56:48	danielsh	could you report that to the list please?  zsh-workers@zsh.org
2016-10-20 13:57:13	OODani	Sure thing.
2016-10-20 13:57:36	danielsh	cheers
2016-10-20 13:58:33	OODani	Ooh, *that's* interesting. If you match a multibyte char using a wildcard like *, the pattern matches but it looks like it's confused about how wide it is, because the last two characters of the description aren't coloured.

2016-10-20 21:16:35	osse	I am in MSYS so /c does exist. cd /c works, cd /c/Users/osse works, etc. But via some dark magic /c itself is not visible
2016-10-20 21:17:02	Mikachu	ah, i see
2016-10-20 21:17:05	Mikachu	you could try
2016-10-20 21:17:09	Mikachu	accept-exact-dirs instead
2016-10-20 21:17:12	Mikachu	it Might work
2016-10-20 21:17:26	Mikachu	and would still let you do path-completion in other cases
2016-10-20 21:18:38	osse	Depends on how zsh determines whether the directory exists, I suppose. Let's see.
2016-10-20 21:19:28	osse	praise gaben slightly!
2016-10-20 21:20:00	Mikachu	was that a yes or a no
2016-10-20 21:20:22	Mikachu	you could use some zstyle -e invocation that checks if the word being completed starts with /c but that may be overkill
2016-10-20 21:20:41	osse	f/b expands to foo/bar, /c/Us expands to /c/Users but /c/U/o does not expand to /c/Users/osse. Then it rewrites to /cmd.
2016-10-20 21:20:52	osse	So accept-exact-dirs is pretty good, thanks

2016-10-21 02:34:41	llua	making your own config
2016-10-21 02:34:52	llua	it has everything you want and nothing more
2016-10-21 02:34:55	SAL9000	I guess I should rephrase
2016-10-21 02:35:07	SAL9000	is there some place with example zshrc's to crib stuff from?
2016-10-21 02:35:31	SAL9000	ideally "best-practices" zshrc's, of course... I wouldn't want to be cribbing bad habits
2016-10-21 02:35:31		[02:35]
2016-10-21 02:36:33	SAL9000	llua: ^
2016-10-21 02:38:43	chris2	well, many regulars here have their zshrc public
2016-10-21 02:38:52	chris2	perhaps we could make a list
2016-10-21 02:39:11	SAL9000	yeah, would be nice to have something like a "top 10 recommended zshrc"
2016-10-21 02:39:27	SAL9000	I realise that there's 1001 publicly available ones out there
2016-10-21 02:40:14	llua	each of them would be pretty different i bet, the one few things of common being not sourcing some crapwork.
2016-10-21 02:40:24	SAL9000	different is good :)

2016-10-21 02:41:44	chris2	something like https://www.vi-improved.org/recommendations/ for #zsh would be cool
2016-10-21 02:42:08	SAL9000	btw, any recommendations for saner dotfiles management?
2016-10-21 02:42:20	SAL9000	I've got a repo for 'em already, but it's grown so much cruft...
2016-10-21 02:42:33	SAL9000	probably because I tossed my .emacs.d into the same repo as everything else, heh.

2016-10-22 08:48:13	snoewflaek	ls, grep, gcc, etc
2016-10-22 08:48:25	LordRyan	snoewflaek: *add* an alias for --color=always
2016-10-22 08:48:38	LordRyan	so `alias ls="ls --color=always"`
2016-10-22 08:52:03	snoewflaek	okay. that works for ls. i mean, sure i can just alias ls and grep with a --color=always and that will probably be enough, but i am wondering why it is that i have to add this for every command, and why ls/grep etc somehow decide not to print color

2016-10-22 08:52:23	llua	i am willing to bet that is how bash 'works', just someone else did the work for you
2016-10-22 08:53:24	snoewflaek	"'works'" ?
2016-10-22 08:54:34	llua	what does type ls in bash say
2016-10-22 08:55:21	snoewflaek	oh. it's aliased to ls --color=auto.

2016-10-22 08:55:53	phy1729	What OS are you on?
2016-10-22 08:55:58	snoewflaek	gentoo
2016-10-22 08:56:09	chris2	and that's why zsh has NO_GLOBAL_RCS :P
2016-10-22 08:56:31	phy1729	Would not have expected that kinda stuff from gentoo
2016-10-22 08:57:06	chris2	(what do you expect from a distro that doesn't include vi in the base system because its too hard to use :P)

2016-10-22 11:41:46	nikivi	cd, mv and other work well
2016-10-22 11:41:48	nikivi	but not vim
2016-10-22 11:41:49	nikivi	and nvim
2016-10-22 11:42:08	peppermint	i dont have chshell apparently.
2016-10-22 11:42:20	peppermint	wiat
2016-10-22 11:43:52	peppermint	chsh -s zhs?
2016-10-22 11:44:05	peppermint	rather chsh -s zsh?
2016-10-22 11:44:59	nikivi	just removed prezto all together
2016-10-22 11:45:02	nikivi	and still get the error
2016-10-22 11:45:15	nikivi	what can be the reason for it?
2016-10-22 11:45:38	nikivi	I also read somewhere that it might be because I might have mutilple of these zcompdump files
2016-10-22 11:45:48	nikivi	but I did rm .zcompdump
2016-10-22 11:45:53	nikivi	that didn't help
2016-10-22 11:45:58	danielsh	nikivi, if you don't get an answer here try zsh-users@ (see topic)
2016-10-22 11:46:46	danielsh	nikivi, whence -v _vim ← what's the output ?
2016-10-22 11:47:09	nikivi	_vim is a shell function from /usr/share/zsh/5.0.8/functions/_vim
2016-10-22 11:48:34	nikivi	danielsh and this is when zpresto is off : _vim is an autoload shell function
2016-10-22 11:48:34		[11:48]
2016-10-22 11:48:46	nikivi	but it doesn't work in either of them
2016-10-22 11:49:13	nikivi	danielsh get this error when autocompleting w/o zprezto : _arguments:450: _vim_files: function definition file not found
2016-10-22 11:49:22	nikivi	I never had this issue before
2016-10-22 11:49:31	nikivi	it's strange that it just popped up randomly
2016-10-22 11:50:03	danielsh	wait a minute.
2016-10-22 11:50:11	danielsh	that error means somebody did «autoload _vim_files»!
2016-10-22 11:50:33	danielsh	(which is not expected to work)
2016-10-22 11:50:33	nikivi	what do you mean
2016-10-22 11:50:45	danielsh	I know what the mistake is, now
2016-10-22 11:50:50	danielsh	I just don't know who made it :)
2016-10-22 11:50:58	nikivi	is there a way to fix it?
2016-10-22 11:51:21	danielsh	well, you can try starting zsh -x and grepping the output for autoload|_vim_files.
2016-10-22 11:51:30	danielsh	or you can try bisecting your zshrc.
2016-10-22 11:51:44	danielsh	(@all: do we have a zayita factoid for bisecting zshrc?)

2016-10-22 11:55:04	nikivi	danielsh just tried doing zsh -x | grep autoload|_vim_files
2016-10-22 11:55:13	nikivi	and it didn't seem to work
2016-10-22 11:55:19	nikivi	it still showed me a stream of text
2016-10-22 11:56:20	danielsh	because -x prints to stderr, not to stdout
2016-10-22 11:56:37	danielsh	anyway nikivi , I still suggest that you bisect your zshrc to find the error
2016-10-22 11:57:29	llua	deja vu
2016-10-22 11:57:41	nikivi	but in my zshrc
2016-10-22 11:57:59	nikivi	I kind of deleted everything from it too
2016-10-22 11:58:04	nikivi	to see what might be causing the problem
2016-10-22 11:58:15	nikivi	and the issue still persists
2016-10-22 11:58:42	llua	oh, same guy
2016-10-22 11:59:09	danielsh	yes, he was here Thursday too llua
2016-10-22 12:00:08	danielsh	nikivi, then delete more lines from zshrc until the problem disappears.  Then add back everything you deleted as long as the error isn't starting again.
2016-10-22 12:00:52	nikivi	danielsh yayy
2016-10-22 12:00:59	nikivi	apparently the issue is with zplug
2016-10-22 12:01:01	nikivi	:|
2016-10-22 12:01:16	danielsh	you never mentions you used _that_ one too
2016-10-22 12:01:37	llua	gotta catch 'em all
2016-10-22 12:01:44	nikivi	_that_?
2016-10-22 12:01:49	nikivi	whats wrong with zplug
2016-10-22 12:04:01	nikivi	I really wish I can understand what zpresto does
2016-10-22 12:04:01		[12:04]
2016-10-22 12:04:13	nikivi	so maybe I can modify I to my own liking
2016-10-22 12:04:19	nikivi	I really dislike 2 sec bootup time
2016-10-22 12:04:28	nikivi	but that is maybe because I have too many aliases
2016-10-22 12:05:07	danielsh	it has a bug where it runs «autoload _vim_files» and breaks vim completion
2016-10-22 12:05:07	danielsh	... as we now know
2016-10-22 12:05:15	nikivi	yeah
2016-10-22 12:05:19	nikivi	updated zplug too
2016-10-22 12:05:25	nikivi	still the same issue
2016-10-22 12:05:30	nikivi	I guess no zplug for me for some time

2016-10-22 12:11:24	llua	its a shell
2016-10-22 12:11:50	nikivi	I remember reading that anything in fish can be done in zsh
2016-10-22 12:11:53	nikivi	so no reason using fish
2016-10-22 12:12:04	nikivi	and that zsh is bash compatible
2016-10-22 12:12:09	llua	it isn't

2016-10-22 12:14:12	nikivi	do you guys use some kind of zsh framework?

2016-10-22 12:14:18	llua	no
2016-10-22 12:14:33	nikivi	isn't it more convenient to use them?
2016-10-22 12:14:38	llua	no
2016-10-22 12:14:59	LordRyan	i just run grml-etc-core and then put a few aliases on top of it.
2016-10-22 12:15:01	llua	did you just not struggle with a problem since thursday due to one?
2016-10-22 12:15:06	LordRyan	works fine for me.
2016-10-22 12:15:31	Elronnd	LordRyan: zsh isn't posix-compatible
2016-10-22 12:16:49	ft	Well, its sh emulation is pretty close. Its native mode isn't posix, though. That's true.
2016-10-22 12:18:32	nikivi	what reason is there to use bash when there is zsh
2016-10-22 12:18:43	nikivi	from what I understand zsh seems superior
2016-10-22 12:19:05	llua	ask #bash
2016-10-22 12:19:05		[12:19]
2016-10-22 12:19:17	chris2	the main reason is to run bash scripts ;)
2016-10-22 12:19:30	ft	Bash is not a bad shell. And it's installed everywhere. And zsh has more knobs, which make it more complex.
2016-10-22 12:19:46	Elronnd	meh
2016-10-22 12:20:13	Elronnd	if I'm writing non-zsh scripts, I'd prefer not to use any bash extensions
2016-10-22 12:20:30	Elronnd	and /bin/sh is more everywhere than /bin/bash
2016-10-22 12:20:48	LordRyan	Elronnd: why not? and is there a reason why?
2016-10-22 12:21:12	ft	Sure. But pure POSIX scripts get painful very quickly.
2016-10-22 12:21:37	llua	and you start to notice how every shell does things wrong

2016-10-22 21:31:06	OODani	Hmmm.
2016-10-22 21:31:12	Mikachu	actually the first element of $@ would be the command
2016-10-22 21:31:40	Mikachu	but at that point, you can just do (( $# )) && < "$@"
2016-10-22 21:31:47	OODani	Ideally I'd want it to fall back on standard input if there are no arguments, like a sensible UNIX command does.
2016-10-22 21:32:09	Mikachu	and if this is a script, just do if (( $# )) like a normal person

2016-10-22 21:38:32	Mikachu	yeah zsh doesn't do any stupid things
2016-10-22 21:40:39	OODani	Apparently bash does, which would've been convenient right here. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2016-10-23 00:37:15	danielsh	confuseAcat, _git is written to allow any single function to be overridden; but there's no function for commit messages
2016-10-23 00:38:07	danielsh	you might consider a wrapper based solution
2016-10-23 00:38:36	confuseAcat	I see.
2016-10-23 00:38:38	danielsh	f() { git $2 -m $1 $argv[3,-1] } ← and write completion for that
2016-10-23 00:39:17	confuseAcat	I usually don't like to use wrappers, but in this case, it might be the way to go.
2016-10-23 00:40:02	confuseAcat	actually, I now have a little wrapper with completion working ok.
2016-10-23 00:40:18	danielsh	nice
2016-10-23 00:40:59	confuseAcat	muscle memory might keep me from using it, though. ;-)
2016-10-23 00:41:06	confuseAcat	all i did was _arguments ": :($subjects)"
2016-10-23 00:41:35	danielsh	compadd - $subjects ← more correct

2016-10-23 00:43:00	confuseAcat	i shouldn't use _arguments?
2016-10-23 00:43:36	danielsh	1) it's overkill 2) you need *two* levels of escaping if you do that, and you had neither

2016-10-24 03:32:32		[03:32]
2016-10-24 03:32:45	danielsh	if the distro makes custom additions to $PATH In /e/profile, how to pick those up
2016-10-24 03:32:51	danielsh	without reimplementing what every distro you use does

2016-10-24 03:34:08	spudowiar	Because I want my PATH to be set in zshenv
2016-10-24 03:35:18	spudowiar	My other idea was to check if it isn't a login shell in zshenv (and source another file) and source that same from zprofile

2016-10-24 17:00:47	machabot	"omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the channel #oh-my-zsh.

2016-10-24 17:00:58	machabot	It is a collection of subpar quality shell scripts that abstracts the configuration of zsh in ways unknown to us (seemingly its users too) and reinvents various features of zsh. All in a effort of providing the mystical "sane default config".

2016-10-24 22:59:42	llua	[02:37:24] *([3,-1]) [02:37:24]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Forlorn	[02:37:32] that's all? [02:37:32]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Forlorn	[02:37:33] wow [02:37:33]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Forlorn	[02:37:35] thanks [02:37:35]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Forlorn	[02:37:55] that's really pretty [02:37:55]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	zacts	[02:43:44] hm... yeah [02:43:44]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	zacts	[02:44:00] I think it might be odd to try to make a cookbook of zsh recipes, now that I think of it [02:44:00]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	zacts	[02:44:10] when should I script with zsh, and when should I script with posix sh? [02:44:10]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	LordRyan	[02:46:33] zacts: zsh when the system is yours, POSIX sh when the system isn't [02:46:33]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	zacts	[02:49:40] ok [02:49:40]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	zacts	[02:51:12] and what is this Oh-My-Zsh? [02:51:12]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	zacts	[02:51:16] can I live without it? [02:51:16]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	Mikachu	[03:00:46] !omz [03:00:46]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	machabot	[03:00:47] "omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the channel #oh-my-zsh. [03:00:47]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	llua	[03:00:58] !omzwhy [03:00:58]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	machabot	[03:00:58] It is a collection of subpar quality shell scripts that abstracts the configuration of zsh in ways unknown to us (seemingly its users too) and reinvents various features of zsh. All in a effort of providing the mystical "sane default config". [03:00:58]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	zacts	[03:10:27] ah good to know, thanks [03:10:27]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	zacts	[03:10:33] I'll stick without it then [03:10:33]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	function	[03:37:54] I've been using https://kev.inburke.com/kevin/profiling-zsh-startup-time/ to profile my zsh startup time and I noticed that the vast majority of the time is spent in "compaudit" which appears to be quite slow (394 ms) [03:37:54]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	function	[03:38:11] any ideas of what I can do to speed it up? [03:38:11]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	function	[03:39:25] the other slow thing is virtualenvwrapper which I'm going to modify to load lazily [03:39:25]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	llua	[03:53:35] because zprof doesn't exist [03:53:35]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	function	[03:54:42] llua I've been using that too [03:54:42]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	function	[03:54:49] both are useful in different ways [03:54:49]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	function	[03:55:02] either way, I'm looking into how I could make the virtualenv stuff lazy [03:55:02]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	function	[03:56:37] or actually... it turns out there is a builtin lazy version :-p [03:56:37]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	llua	[04:05:29] profile the function and see, i bet it is disk bound. it varies from 7 ms to 80ms on the few systems i tried. [04:05:29]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	function	[04:06:22] llua will do. just making virtualenv lazy was a massive win [04:06:22]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	function	[04:06:39] it went from #1 to #7 [04:06:39]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	function	[04:06:44] in terms of time taken [04:06:44]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	function	[04:06:52] going to see how much I notice shell start time now [04:06:52]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	llua	[04:07:12] you can disable the check if you really want to with an additional flag to compinit [04:07:12]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	function	[04:10:32] which check? [04:10:32]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	function	[04:11:13] ah [04:11:13]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	function	[04:11:13] " The check performed to see if there are new functions can be omitted by giving the option -C." [04:11:13]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	llua	[04:17:46] -i, but compaudit still runs, it just doesn't nag you it seems. [04:17:46]
2016-10-24 22:59:42	llua	[04:18:13] could compaudit() : but whatever. [04:18:13]

2016-10-24 23:19:19	danielsh	[00:46:28] osse, in linux you can do MANOPT=--nh\ --nj ... unsure about others [00:46:28]
2016-10-24 23:19:19	zacts	[00:55:14] hi [00:55:14]
2016-10-24 23:19:19	zacts	[00:56:53] I'm learning zsh via the book from bash to the z-shell by apress [00:56:53]
2016-10-24 23:19:19	zacts	[00:57:22] I wonder if there is a cookbook for zsh [00:57:22]
2016-10-24 23:19:19	zacts	[00:57:35] like of already existing recipes to gain knowledge from [00:57:35]
2016-10-24 23:19:19	llua	[01:11:30] you could hack into Mikachu's computer [01:11:30]
2016-10-24 23:19:19	llua	[01:11:42] less $HISTFILE [01:11:42]
2016-10-24 23:19:19	Mikachu	[01:11:43] that's impossible [01:11:43]
2016-10-24 23:19:19	Mikachu	[01:11:48] i am Hackerproof™ [01:11:48]
2016-10-24 23:19:19	Forlorn	[02:35:56] If I have a glob *, how can I slice out the elements after an index? [02:35:56]
2016-10-24 23:19:19	Forlorn	[02:36:50] e.g, I have (file1 file2 file3 file4 file5), and I want to slice it at index 2, which should give me (file3,file4,file5) [02:36:50]
2016-10-24 23:19:19	llua	[02:37:13] so you want index 3 [02:37:13]

2016-10-25 11:42:09	JayGuerette	[16:37:59] Ah, I see. [16:37:59]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	JayGuerette	[16:38:02] Odd [16:38:02]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	JayGuerette	[16:40:15] I can work around it by using zftp type I [16:40:15]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	danielsh	[16:41:29] JayGuerette, good to know, but it's still a bug - could you report it to the list please? [16:41:29]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	JayGuerette	[16:42:56] after I figure out why I get "*** Error in `/bin/zsh': free(): invalid pointer: 0x0000556968d9cc50 ***" when I call zfclose ... [16:42:56]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	JayGuerette	[16:43:16] :-) [16:43:16]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	JayGuerette	[16:47:30] zftp quit also cores [16:47:30]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	JayGuerette	[16:47:31] wierd [16:47:31]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	danielsh	[16:47:50] you are using 5.2 right ? [16:47:50]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	danielsh	[16:47:55] not 5.0.2;  5.2 [16:47:55]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	JayGuerette	[16:48:22] % zsh --version ... zsh 5.2 (x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu) [16:48:22]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	danielsh	[16:48:50] good [16:48:50]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	JayGuerette	[16:52:03] aha... it's something to do with sessions [16:52:03]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	JayGuerette	[16:52:34] If I don't set up a discrete session, and use 'default', no core [16:52:34]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	danielsh	[16:54:09] the zftp code hasn't changed since 5.2, it's likely that anything you find still exists in master [16:54:09]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	JayGuerette	[17:06:13] the zftype issue persists though, so that's unrelated to the zfsession issue. (which seems obvious anyway) [17:06:13]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	llua	[17:30:44] til, people actually use zftp. [17:30:44]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	JayGuerette	[17:34:09] I have a setup/update script that makes about 10 FTP connections, I realized it would be much more efficient to use a persistent connection... instead of refactoring the script heavily, I swapped in zftp relatively painlessly [17:34:09]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	JayGuerette	[17:34:54] Also, lftp no longer appears to be installed by default (Fedora), and has some odd defaults, so zsftp works nicely for me [17:34:54]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	JayGuerette	[17:35:45] *zftp [17:35:45]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	JayGuerette	[18:07:35] As a side note... zftp appears to prefer IPv6 as well, where lftp did not. [18:07:35]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	llua	[18:18:51] til, zftp supports ipv6. [18:18:51]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	JayGuerette	[18:26:18] maybe not many people use zftp ... zfgcp with globbing does not appear to work at all... [18:26:18]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	JayGuerette	[18:27:49] grrr [18:27:49]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	heftig	[18:41:16] there's no built-in glob filter comparable to find's -newer (compare file mtime to reference file), is there? [18:41:16]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	ft	[18:43:51] heftig: There's an example on how to do that in the manual. [18:43:51]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	ft	[18:44:45] man zshexpn | less -p "estring" [18:44:45]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	danielsh	[18:45:17] Pattern not found  (press RETURN) [18:45:17]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	thrig	[18:45:39] there is no built-in glob filter (but you can run arbitrary code to do whatever) [18:45:39]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	ft	[18:47:01] danielsh: Broken manpage? - "estring" is definitely in zshexpn(1) [18:47:01]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	thrig	[18:47:14] or old version? [18:47:14]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	ft	[18:47:38] Maybe, but that's not really a new feature. :) [18:47:38]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	danielsh	[18:47:46] I use the man pages from master [18:47:46]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	danielsh	[18:48:00] found it now, must be local problem, sorry for the noise [18:48:00]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	heftig	[19:16:17] ft: that's nice. nothing for -cnewer though? [19:16:17]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	ft	[19:18:26] heftig: you should be able to use the zsh/stat module to do that. [19:18:26]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	ft	[19:18:50] It gives you access to atime, mtime and ctime of a file. [19:18:50]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	ft	[19:19:15] See zshmodules(1) for details. [19:19:15]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	heftig	[19:24:23] hmm [19:24:23]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	heftig	[19:24:25] nt() { (( $(zstat +ctime $REPLY) >= stamptime )) } [19:24:25]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	heftig	[19:27:30] with err_return that immediately aborts the glob [19:27:30]
2016-10-25 11:42:09	heftig	[19:28:10] that's... not nice; i want err_return for other stuff [19:28:10]

2016-10-25 11:47:22	JayGuerette	[16:37:59] Ah, I see. [16:37:59]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	JayGuerette	[16:38:02] Odd [16:38:02]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	JayGuerette	[16:40:15] I can work around it by using zftp type I [16:40:15]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	danielsh	[16:41:29] JayGuerette, good to know, but it's still a bug - could you report it to the list please? [16:41:29]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	JayGuerette	[16:42:56] after I figure out why I get "*** Error in `/bin/zsh': free(): invalid pointer: 0x0000556968d9cc50 ***" when I call zfclose ... [16:42:56]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	JayGuerette	[16:43:16] :-) [16:43:16]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	JayGuerette	[16:47:30] zftp quit also cores [16:47:30]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	JayGuerette	[16:47:31] wierd [16:47:31]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	danielsh	[16:47:50] you are using 5.2 right ? [16:47:50]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	danielsh	[16:47:55] not 5.0.2;  5.2 [16:47:55]

2016-10-25 11:47:22	danielsh	[16:48:50] good [16:48:50]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	JayGuerette	[16:52:03] aha... it's something to do with sessions [16:52:03]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	JayGuerette	[16:52:34] If I don't set up a discrete session, and use 'default', no core [16:52:34]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	danielsh	[16:54:09] the zftp code hasn't changed since 5.2, it's likely that anything you find still exists in master [16:54:09]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	JayGuerette	[17:06:13] the zftype issue persists though, so that's unrelated to the zfsession issue. (which seems obvious anyway) [17:06:13]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	llua	[17:30:44] til, people actually use zftp. [17:30:44]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	JayGuerette	[17:34:09] I have a setup/update script that makes about 10 FTP connections, I realized it would be much more efficient to use a persistent connection... instead of refactoring the script heavily, I swapped in zftp relatively painlessly [17:34:09]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	JayGuerette	[17:34:54] Also, lftp no longer appears to be installed by default (Fedora), and has some odd defaults, so zsftp works nicely for me [17:34:54]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	JayGuerette	[17:35:45] *zftp [17:35:45]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	JayGuerette	[18:07:35] As a side note... zftp appears to prefer IPv6 as well, where lftp did not. [18:07:35]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	llua	[18:18:51] til, zftp supports ipv6. [18:18:51]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	JayGuerette	[18:26:18] maybe not many people use zftp ... zfgcp with globbing does not appear to work at all... [18:26:18]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	JayGuerette	[18:27:49] grrr [18:27:49]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	heftig	[18:41:16] there's no built-in glob filter comparable to find's -newer (compare file mtime to reference file), is there? [18:41:16]

2016-10-25 11:47:22	danielsh	[18:47:46] I use the man pages from master [18:47:46]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	danielsh	[18:48:00] found it now, must be local problem, sorry for the noise [18:48:00]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	heftig	[19:16:17] ft: that's nice. nothing for -cnewer though? [19:16:17]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	ft	[19:18:26] heftig: you should be able to use the zsh/stat module to do that. [19:18:26]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	ft	[19:18:50] It gives you access to atime, mtime and ctime of a file. [19:18:50]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	ft	[19:19:15] See zshmodules(1) for details. [19:19:15]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	heftig	[19:24:23] hmm [19:24:23]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	heftig	[19:24:25] nt() { (( $(zstat +ctime $REPLY) >= stamptime )) } [19:24:25]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	heftig	[19:27:30] with err_return that immediately aborts the glob [19:27:30]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	heftig	[19:28:10] that's... not nice; i want err_return for other stuff [19:28:10]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	Mikachu	[20:44:13] just put return in front of the statement? [20:44:13]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	Mikachu	[20:44:57] (and add a $ to the first (( ) [20:44:57]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	Mikachu	[20:45:04] oh he left [20:45:04]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	JayGuerette	[21:03:38] danielsh: ",,, report it to the list please" Which list exactly? I found a bunch of problems... my fear is that zftp is largely unsupported [21:03:38]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	JayGuerette	[21:04:32] zsh-users ? [21:04:32]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	danielsh	[21:32:50] JayGuerette, either list is fine in this case [21:32:50]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	danielsh	[21:33:07] the lists are nested anyway, so the right people will see it regardless of where you post to [21:33:07]
2016-10-25 11:47:22	danielsh	[21:34:31] JayGuerette, zsh-users@zsh.org is fine [21:34:31]

2016-10-25 13:49:48	ft	[19:18:26] heftig: you should be able to use the zsh/stat module to do that. [19:18:26]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	ft	[19:18:50] It gives you access to atime, mtime and ctime of a file. [19:18:50]

2016-10-25 13:49:48	OODani	[23:48:22] Hmm, I'm just noticed that the docs say "[.zlogin] should not change the shell environment at all." Why not? Doesn't it make sense to set enviroment variables in login shells, since they're inherited by nonlogin shells anyway? My current setup is .zshenv for stuff that's needed in all shells (autoloading functions mostly), .zprofile for setting up the environment (path, fpath, umask, etc.), and .zshrc for [23:48:22]
2016-10-25 13:49:48	OODani	[23:48:24] loading aliases, plugins, completion, options, and so on. I check [[ -o login ]] in .zshrc to decide whether to print a fortune (i.e., only do it in interactive login shells). Is this arrangement of the three files *wrong*, and if so, how should it be done? [23:48:24]

2016-10-26 09:43:43	OODani	[02:15:49] That's exactly what I'm using it for and it works fine so. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Gotta use something for non-root package manage, right? [02:15:49]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	llua	[02:19:22] s/solved/attempted/ [02:19:22]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	oxa	[03:03:06] hey y'all ive got a quick question regarding this error: _arguments:451: _vim_files: function definition file not found - when trying to complete filenames [03:03:06]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	oxa	[03:05:11] what seems to be causing it? my zcomp doesnt look incorrect, and everything works with a fresh default .zshrc [03:05:11]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	OODani	[03:07:25] oxa: Are you using a framework, like oh-my-zsh or Prezto? Or any plugins in general? [03:07:25]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	oxa	[03:07:36] not for zsh [03:07:36]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	oxa	[03:08:34] another weird thing ijust noticed - if i try to complete a modifier it will give me the same error, but it then completes it anyway [03:08:34]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	llua	[03:11:22] third person so far [03:11:22]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	llua	[03:12:08] what does your .zshrc look like? [03:12:08]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	oxa	[03:12:34] im about to modify it one moment [03:12:34]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	Mikachu	[03:14:06] echo $fpath $ZSH_VERSION [03:14:06]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	oxa	[03:15:09] https://github.com/canibaoxa/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/.zshrc [03:15:09]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	oxa	[03:16:14] Mikachu: /usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion/Unix is in there - which is correct [03:16:14]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	Mikachu	[03:16:37] that's a bold statement [03:16:37]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	oxa	[03:17:01] no thats a bold statement [03:17:01]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	oxa	[03:17:08] are you saying its incorrect? [03:17:08]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	Mikachu	[03:17:14] if your fpath doesn't have the zsh version number in it, i don't know what you did [03:17:14]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	Mikachu	[03:17:23] and is very likely the cause of your problems [03:17:23]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	llua	[03:17:38] archlinux packages lit like that [03:17:38]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	oxa	[03:17:45] thats how arch does it [03:17:45]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	Mikachu	[03:17:52] okay, arch is not supported here then [03:17:52]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	llua	[03:18:38] does echo /etc/zsh/* only print zprofile? [03:18:38]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	oxa	[03:18:46] Mikachu: cool go back to being silent [03:18:46]

2016-10-26 09:43:43	llua	[03:19:40] rm .zcompdump; exec zsh [03:19:40]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	oxa	[03:21:55] right that works but what values were modified to cause the issue [03:21:55]

2016-10-26 09:43:43	llua	[03:25:45] i can only assume it is related to that [03:25:45]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	oxa	[03:26:22] aahhh that makes sense [03:26:22]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	oxa	[03:26:31] thank you llua much appreciated [03:26:31]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	llua	[03:30:05] i wonder if deleting .zcompdump is really needed to trigger that now [03:30:05]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	llua	[03:30:43] or how the other two managed to break it without seemingly deleting it. [03:30:43]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	Mikachu	[03:31:02] does _vim do (( $+functions[_vim_files] )) && _vim_files ? [03:31:02]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	llua	[03:31:13] iirc it does [03:31:13]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	Mikachu	[03:31:31] ah, that would explain it [03:31:31]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	llua	[03:31:32] || _vim_files [03:31:32]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	Mikachu	[03:31:43] well you know what i meant [03:31:43]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	Mikachu	[03:31:53] so if it's autoloaded, that check thinks it's already defined [03:31:53]

2016-10-26 09:43:43	llua	[03:33:57] yea [03:33:57]
2016-10-26 09:43:43	Mikachu	[03:34:06] right, then it doesn't matter that it adds a bunch of extra stats [03:34:06]

2016-10-26 12:54:20	OODani	[02:15:49] That's exactly what I'm using it for and it works fine so. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Gotta use something for non-root package manage, right? [02:15:49]

2016-10-26 12:54:20	oxa	[03:03:06] hey y'all ive got a quick question regarding this error: _arguments:451: _vim_files: function definition file not found - when trying to complete filenames [03:03:06]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	oxa	[03:05:11] what seems to be causing it? my zcomp doesnt look incorrect, and everything works with a fresh default .zshrc [03:05:11]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	OODani	[03:07:25] oxa: Are you using a framework, like oh-my-zsh or Prezto? Or any plugins in general? [03:07:25]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	oxa	[03:07:36] not for zsh [03:07:36]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	oxa	[03:08:34] another weird thing ijust noticed - if i try to complete a modifier it will give me the same error, but it then completes it anyway [03:08:34]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	llua	[03:11:22] third person so far [03:11:22]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	llua	[03:12:08] what does your .zshrc look like? [03:12:08]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	oxa	[03:12:34] im about to modify it one moment [03:12:34]

2016-10-26 12:54:20	oxa	[03:16:14] Mikachu: /usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion/Unix is in there - which is correct [03:16:14]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	Mikachu	[03:16:37] that's a bold statement [03:16:37]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	oxa	[03:17:01] no thats a bold statement [03:17:01]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	oxa	[03:17:08] are you saying its incorrect? [03:17:08]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	Mikachu	[03:17:14] if your fpath doesn't have the zsh version number in it, i don't know what you did [03:17:14]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	Mikachu	[03:17:23] and is very likely the cause of your problems [03:17:23]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	llua	[03:17:38] archlinux packages lit like that [03:17:38]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	oxa	[03:17:45] thats how arch does it [03:17:45]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	Mikachu	[03:17:52] okay, arch is not supported here then [03:17:52]
2016-10-26 12:54:20	llua	[03:18:38] does echo /etc/zsh/* only print zprofile? [03:18:38]

2016-10-26 12:54:20	Mikachu	[03:31:31] ah, that would explain it [03:31:31]

2016-10-26 12:54:20	Mikachu	[03:34:06] right, then it doesn't matter that it adds a bunch of extra stats [03:34:06]

2016-10-26 15:44:53	stratact	Hi, I'm having trouble getting tab completion to work in zsh. Whenever I hit tab, it's as if I hit the escape key which goes into vi mode. Is there a way to fix this?
2016-10-26 15:45:43	danielsh	What's the output of «bindkey $'\t'»?
2016-10-26 15:47:47	stratact	"^I" expand-or-complete
2016-10-26 15:48:38	llua	are you using oh-my-zsh?

2016-10-26 15:49:49	stratact	Actually... I just realized it's not an issue with zsh. It's my keyboard key mappings and I screwed up there.
2016-10-26 15:50:20	danielsh	thanks for letting us know.
2016-10-26 15:51:34	stratact	Sorry for the commotion
2016-10-26 15:51:34		[15:51]
2016-10-26 15:54:42	stratact	I set a key to do shift+alt, so when I switch between windows it's easier to go hit that button go in the reverse pattern and what I thought was the tab key, was tab+shift. So interesting how that acts as the escape key
2016-10-26 15:55:02	stratact	*alt+tab
2016-10-26 15:55:16	stratact	*shift+tab

2016-10-26 18:46:49	OODani	Hmm, I'm running into some weirdness with completion definition. My compdef so far looks like this http://ix.io/1zQG - for some reason, the call to _files seems to be applied twice, i.e., if I type "dots link <TAB>" I get two identical groups listing the correct files. Any idea what I've done wrong?

2016-10-27 00:52:39	blueyed	Is there a shell-builtin way to get the displayed width of a string, according to wcwidth?  A hack might be [[ ${#${(ml:2:)s2}} != ${#${(l:2:)s2}} ]], but that applies to a single glyph only.
2016-10-27 00:53:59	blueyed	So it is more like wcswidth after all.

2016-10-27 01:59:58	danielsh	eto, to be clear, are you talking about zsh/curses module, or about the interactive prompts ($PS1, etc)?

2016-10-27 02:01:55	eto	danielsh: well i mean interactive prompts - i guess output layer is not completely abstracted away is it (as in both curses and interactive prompts using same subsystem)? also i think, i am getting closer - prompt.c seems like likely place
2016-10-27 02:03:31	danielsh	eto, interactive prompts can use zle, but even that is optional ...
2016-10-27 02:03:43	danielsh	you can 'unsetopt zle' to get something even more basic

2016-10-27 02:04:20	danielsh	eto, curses isn't used for prompts in either case.
2016-10-27 02:05:32	eto	danielsh: lets say i would like to hook myself from c as zsh module into the REPL
2016-10-27 02:06:06	eto	danielsh: i would like to fire my handler before prompt is drawn - do you think that is possible?
2016-10-27 02:06:21	danielsh	precmd() preexec() ← see these
2016-10-27 02:06:36	danielsh	... and what are you actually trying to do ?
2016-10-27 02:10:34	eto	danielsh: yes but those are zsh equivalents, i am more interested C side of things
2016-10-27 02:11:42	danielsh	eto, for zle mode you can start in clearscreen() [the function that's bound to ^L]

2016-10-27 02:12:27	eto	danielsh: curently i would like to just draw things from c solely, unaffected by zsh language and shell states, let us say like when you have clock ticker in prompt, i would like to attmpt something like it but "disconnected from" zsh langauge
2016-10-27 02:13:39	eto	danielsh: ah i see! so when zle is enabled, shell runtime goes into zle code and fires various hooks, like precmd(), clearscreen() and such?
2016-10-27 02:13:54	danielsh	eto, not quite.
2016-10-27 02:14:05	danielsh	precmd() is a shell hook, independent of zle I believe.
2016-10-27 02:14:23	danielsh	clearscreen() is the C function that implements the 'clear-screen' widget, which is bound to ^L.
2016-10-27 02:14:23		[02:14]
2016-10-27 02:14:35	danielsh	^L redraws the prompt, that's why I pointed you to that function.
2016-10-27 02:14:46	eto	danielsh: ah i see. so precmd() it is not related exactly drawing
2016-10-27 02:15:03	danielsh	eto, correct, that was when I was trying to rule out an xy problem on your part.
2016-10-27 02:15:22	eto	danielsh: great thank you, i will start by studying clearscreen() then
2016-10-27 02:15:28	danielsh	have fun :)
2016-10-27 02:16:42	eto	danielsh: i had this idea of injecting little boxes and such into my shell "screen" session some years, at first i wanted to do it with zsh, but amount of sates shell enters and whole machinery seems extremely complex and daunting

2016-10-27 02:17:46	danielsh	May be easier to do it the other way, have screen start a curses app that starts zsh in a window
2016-10-27 02:18:10	eto	danielsh: i thought about it a lot, and came to conclusion, i am currently interested in just attempting to draw information within shell repl refresh cycle - without need or ability to be affected by infinite amount of shell programs that might get laoded
2016-10-27 02:19:55	eto	danielsh: screen as in tmux precursor? and this hypothetical curses app would instruct screen then to do split and spawn zsh as another client?
2016-10-27 02:21:10	danielsh	eto, I understand you meant screen(1) the tmux(1) analogue.
2016-10-27 02:21:21	danielsh	eto, when I said "window" I meant a curses window.
2016-10-27 02:21:41	danielsh	... although now that I think of it, it may be easier to patch screen(1) then to add another layer of indirection
2016-10-27 02:21:49	danielsh	than*
2016-10-27 02:24:45	eto	danielsh: i just wasn't sure whether you meant curses or not ;). thanks anyway! i located zle refresh machinery and will just read it for now, maybe it's too silly of idea after all, but i was interested in this anyway, so thanks again

2016-10-27 17:07:27	DHowett	[15:44:58] psprint: are you opposed to using the basic keyplane for commands? because "move selection over line and press ;" => mark for concat may work [15:44:58]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	llua	[15:45:29] or accept-and-menu-complete [15:45:29]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	DHowett	[15:46:51] though being able to re-run a range from context might be better than accept concat, because really unless your search is generic enough you probably don't want more than one of the lines that contains the single term you sought [15:46:51]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	psprint	[15:57:06] DHowett: would need Ctrl- command, like Ctrl-t resembling selecting in Midnight Commander [15:57:06]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	psprint	[15:58:05] DHowett: yeah user would need to search multiple times, so true that selecting is maybe more context-related thing [15:58:05]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	psprint	[16:01:35] can't get ctrl-o to work, after bindkey -e [16:01:35]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	psprint	[16:02:00] it runs the command [16:02:00]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	psprint	[16:10:04] hmm can someone run  zsh -f; bindkey -e; bindkey '^K' .kill-line;   then type something and press Ctrl-K  –  because for me it just doesn't work, for zsh-5.0.8, current zsh, 5.0.2 [16:10:04]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	danielsh	[16:13:12] kill-line empties RBUFFER [16:13:12]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	danielsh	[16:13:14] not LBUFFER [16:13:14]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	danielsh	[16:13:37] psprint, yes ^O runs the command.. that's why it's called accept-* [16:13:37]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	psprint	[16:14:17] suspected that [16:14:17]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	psprint	[16:20:44] hm always thought Ctrl-K clears the line, but if Zsh thinks it should clear to the end, maybe my memory is wrong, even bash clears to the end, wonder what's going on [16:20:44]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	danielsh	[16:24:11] ^U [16:24:11]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	psprint	[16:26:19] yes, one user wanted that as emacs uses it [16:26:19]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	danielsh	[16:26:45] vim too in insert mode [16:26:45]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	thrig	[16:27:11] control-a control-k would be nuke line [16:27:11]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	danielsh	[16:27:28] ... what are you writing that needs ^U to be defined specially ? [16:27:28]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	psprint	[16:27:53] vim clears to the beginning [16:27:53]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	psprint	[16:29:01] danielsh: nothing special, needed this when I implemented input buffer in zsh-navigation-tools, now I redefine the keystrokes in history-search-multi-word so that they are clear, without zsh-autosugg. z-sy-h influence [16:29:01]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	danielsh	[16:29:13] psprint, okay to quote http://sprunge.us/SPHI on the z-sy-h issue tracker ? [16:29:13]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	psprint	[16:30:30] hmm, I can write some text about the change, give link back to the code, expain that with (#B) flag the wrong highlighting of $0ABC can be solved (already solved the unicode-var-names) [16:30:30]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	danielsh	[16:31:18] that'd be most welcome [16:31:18]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	danielsh	[16:31:50] $0abc is handled correctly by current z-sy-h, btw [16:31:50]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	psprint	[16:32:28] yes [16:32:28]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	danielsh	[16:32:31] ... and has a regression test double-quoted3.zsh [16:32:31]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	psprint	[16:50:26] done [16:50:26]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	danielsh	[16:51:27] thanks psprint ! [16:51:27]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	psprint	[17:23:20] n/p [17:23:20]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	aauren	[17:51:44] Does anyone know why long prompt lines and window resizing causes lines of terminal history to be removed? [17:51:44]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	aauren	[17:53:35] I can reproduce this issue consistently with a blank .zshrc. Then make a super long prompt line (doesn't need any variable references or colors even), then fill up the terminal window. Then make it super small, then super big. Each time the terminal window goes big, the prompt moves up a line and I lose a line of terminal output [17:53:35]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	llua	[18:04:07] are you using tmux [18:04:07]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	aauren	[18:14:51] llua: That's where I first noticed it, but I can prove it in just a normal terminal window without tmux [18:14:51]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	llua	[19:55:45] it sounds like a terminal problem [19:55:45]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	aauren	[19:59:39] llua: Well, bash doesn't exhibit the same behavior in the terminal. I'm testing with xfce4-terminal. I tried just now with terminator, but it's default behavior for window size changes appears to be to clear the terminal [19:59:39]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	aauren	[19:59:51] Are you unable to reproduce this in your terminal? [19:59:51]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	llua	[20:46:53] bash doesn't redraw the prompt on SIGWINCH either, and on some of them yea. [20:46:53]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	alyptik	[21:30:52] lol SIGWINCH  [21:30:52]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	alyptik	[21:30:58] love the name of that wignal [21:30:58]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	alyptik	[21:31:05] s/wi/si [21:31:05]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	aauren	[22:39:21] llua: So your comment "on some of them yea" you mean that you're able to reproduce my error on some of your terminals? [22:39:21]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	Mikachu	[01:52:21] danielsh: 0e01942c0 breaks tabcompletion for me [01:52:21]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	Mikachu	[01:53:03] danielsh: specifically if you do mkdir '[a]/foo' then ls \[a\]/<tab> gives no results [01:53:03]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	Mikachu	[01:57:32] sent to ml as well [01:57:32]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	lysander	[02:02:54] pitch a tent [02:02:54]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	lysander	[02:03:20] oops wrong chan [02:03:20]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	Mikachu	[02:03:44] i'll say [02:03:44]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	llua	[02:23:31] aauren: yes, i can reproduce the problem on a few crappy terminals, of the vte favor and tmux. [02:23:31]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	llua	[02:26:15] i don't feel like digging for it now, but i am pretty sure its the terminal not doing something correctly. xterm, urxvt and some others handles it correctly [02:26:15]
2016-10-27 17:07:27	llua	[02:26:59] feel free to post on zsh-users mailing list tho, i know it's been brought up a few times. [02:26:59]

2016-10-27 18:08:50	danielsh	Mikachu, The new quotestring() is called in the input «\[a\]», (5 bytes), so it becomes double-escaped.
2016-10-27 18:09:15	danielsh	Mikachu, Haven't investigated further yet.
2016-10-27 18:09:17	Mikachu	i guess that means it's in the wrong place then

2016-10-28 11:26:21	atrioom	[14:16:07] I wonder why oh-my-zsh bothers with ls....? [14:16:07]

2016-10-28 11:26:21	psprint	[14:17:29] oraclization of oh-my-zsh is quite visible from this grep [14:17:29]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	psprint	[14:17:55] they have "lib", "theme-and-appearance.zsh" what an enterprise stuff [14:17:55]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	psprint	[14:18:44] (oraclization = feature growth applied to already working fine product) [14:18:44]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	llua	[14:19:11] that implies omz is fine. [14:19:11]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	atrioom	[14:20:14] thrig: hahaha, took me a while. [14:20:14]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	atrioom	[14:20:21] thrig: n1 :) [14:20:21]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	atrioom	[14:22:33] thrig: I mainly have it because of agnoster. And the git integration in the prompt. [14:22:33]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	psprint	[14:25:14] Last time I tested some fancy prompt, namely liquid prompt, it turned out it needs 300 ms to load. That's the time of loading 40 plugins with zplugin [14:25:14]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	danielsh	[14:25:22] psprint, "oracle" in crypto circles is a common noun (!= proper noun) with a quite unrelated meaning [14:25:22]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	thrig	[14:25:56] remember when oracle marketing claimed unbreakable? [14:25:56]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	psprint	[14:28:25] google returned something as: Overview page for features found in the latest release of the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel for Oracle Linux [14:28:25]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	psprint	[14:29:30] whow what a cheap graphics https://husnusensoy.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/oracle_unbreakable_linux_bus.jpg [14:29:30]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	thrig	[14:30:25] 2009, sounds about right [14:30:25]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	eto	[14:33:58] poor tux [14:33:58]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	psprint	[15:08:57] BrainDamage: remember the CSI-in-terminal youtube video you showed me? I once watched "Through the Wormhole with M.Freeman" and one scientist there, when elaborating about his work and needed computer computations, had this turned on as the computations going on hehe [15:08:57]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	armin	[16:05:48] hi. [16:05:48]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	armin	[16:06:03] i'm trying the exactly same thing in both zsh and bash. bash works, zsh doesn't. i have zero idea why. [16:06:03]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	armin	[16:06:04] http://base.m2m.pm/json_weird.png [16:06:04]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	armin	[16:06:09] anyone an idea what's going on here? [16:06:09]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	thrig	[16:06:46] ugh, could you post text somewhere? [16:06:46]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	armin	[16:07:05] thrig: 1sec [16:07:05]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	armin	[16:07:24] thrig: https://gist.github.com/26b78ad53f7ec0c67c98f19fbcd8a485 [16:07:24]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	osse	[16:09:37] armin: setopt multibyte maybe? [16:09:37]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	danielsh	[16:10:13] that's just echo eating backslashes [16:10:13]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	danielsh	[16:10:17] use printf(1) instead [16:10:17]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	armin	[16:10:18] osse: doesn't make any difference unfortunately, but thanks a lot for suggesting [16:10:18]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	armin	[16:10:44] oh wow, that's because in zsh, echo is a shell-builtin which behaves different from /bin/echo !? [16:10:44]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	osse	[16:10:55] no [16:10:55]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	osse	[16:11:01] in bash echo is a builtin too [16:11:01]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	danielsh	[16:11:05] armin, the behaviour of \\ in echo is implementation-defined [16:11:05]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	armin	[16:11:12] osse: correct, just looked. ty. [16:11:12]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	armin	[16:11:37] wow, now THAT's confusing. [16:11:37]
2016-10-28 11:26:21	danielsh	[16:11:54] the two echo's behave differently, but neither of them is wrong [16:11:54]

2016-10-28 12:28:14	psprint	[14:17:55] they have "lib", "theme-and-appearance.zsh" what an enterprise stuff [14:17:55]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	psprint	[14:18:44] (oraclization = feature growth applied to already working fine product) [14:18:44]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	llua	[14:19:11] that implies omz is fine. [14:19:11]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	atrioom	[14:20:14] thrig: hahaha, took me a while. [14:20:14]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	atrioom	[14:20:21] thrig: n1 :) [14:20:21]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	atrioom	[14:22:33] thrig: I mainly have it because of agnoster. And the git integration in the prompt. [14:22:33]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	psprint	[14:25:14] Last time I tested some fancy prompt, namely liquid prompt, it turned out it needs 300 ms to load. That's the time of loading 40 plugins with zplugin [14:25:14]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	danielsh	[14:25:22] psprint, "oracle" in crypto circles is a common noun (!= proper noun) with a quite unrelated meaning [14:25:22]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	thrig	[14:25:56] remember when oracle marketing claimed unbreakable? [14:25:56]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	psprint	[14:28:25] google returned something as: Overview page for features found in the latest release of the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel for Oracle Linux [14:28:25]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	psprint	[14:29:30] whow what a cheap graphics https://husnusensoy.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/oracle_unbreakable_linux_bus.jpg [14:29:30]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	thrig	[14:30:25] 2009, sounds about right [14:30:25]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	eto	[14:33:58] poor tux [14:33:58]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	psprint	[15:08:57] BrainDamage: remember the CSI-in-terminal youtube video you showed me? I once watched "Through the Wormhole with M.Freeman" and one scientist there, when elaborating about his work and needed computer computations, had this turned on as the computations going on hehe [15:08:57]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	armin	[16:05:48] hi. [16:05:48]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	armin	[16:06:03] i'm trying the exactly same thing in both zsh and bash. bash works, zsh doesn't. i have zero idea why. [16:06:03]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	armin	[16:06:04] http://base.m2m.pm/json_weird.png [16:06:04]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	armin	[16:06:09] anyone an idea what's going on here? [16:06:09]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	thrig	[16:06:46] ugh, could you post text somewhere? [16:06:46]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	armin	[16:07:05] thrig: 1sec [16:07:05]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	armin	[16:07:24] thrig: https://gist.github.com/26b78ad53f7ec0c67c98f19fbcd8a485 [16:07:24]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	osse	[16:09:37] armin: setopt multibyte maybe? [16:09:37]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	danielsh	[16:10:13] that's just echo eating backslashes [16:10:13]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	danielsh	[16:10:17] use printf(1) instead [16:10:17]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	armin	[16:10:18] osse: doesn't make any difference unfortunately, but thanks a lot for suggesting [16:10:18]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	armin	[16:10:44] oh wow, that's because in zsh, echo is a shell-builtin which behaves different from /bin/echo !? [16:10:44]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	osse	[16:10:55] no [16:10:55]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	osse	[16:11:01] in bash echo is a builtin too [16:11:01]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	danielsh	[16:11:05] armin, the behaviour of \\ in echo is implementation-defined [16:11:05]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	armin	[16:11:12] osse: correct, just looked. ty. [16:11:12]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	armin	[16:11:37] wow, now THAT's confusing. [16:11:37]
2016-10-28 12:28:14	danielsh	[16:11:54] the two echo's behave differently, but neither of them is wrong [16:11:54]

2016-10-28 22:16:46	LordRyan	[07:59:27] the personification of frustration [07:59:27]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	junkmechanic	[08:00:42] that... was disappointingly simple... [08:00:42]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	junkmechanic	[08:00:45] :D [08:00:45]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	LordRyan	[08:00:58] i guess you could say [08:00:58]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	LordRyan	[08:01:00] it was [08:01:00]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	LordRyan	[08:01:06] FRUSTRATINGLY simple :P [08:01:06]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	junkmechanic	[08:01:28] hah.. [08:01:28]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	junkmechanic	[08:02:15] oh btw, i have added reverse-menu-complete to my zshrc.. but it doesnt work in tandem with tab.. [08:02:15]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	junkmechanic	[08:03:27] as in when i press tab, it lists the options.. and i can cycle forward with tab.. but in the middle of the cycle if i press shift-tab it would reverse-cycle for the next round of complletions... [08:03:27]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	junkmechanic	[08:04:28] is that because the mechanism for setting up tab and shift-tab for completions are different? [08:04:28]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	LordRyan	[08:05:37] i'm not sure honestly [08:05:37]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	junkmechanic	[08:06:22] how do you have that set up if so [08:06:22]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	LordRyan	[08:10:02] http://i.imgur.com/etE9eDO.png [08:10:02]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	LordRyan	[08:10:06] i push tab, it goes to the next one [08:10:06]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	LordRyan	[08:10:16] i push shift-tab, it goes to the previous one [08:10:16]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	LordRyan	[08:10:20] if i go over the limit it wraps around [08:10:20]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	junkmechanic	[08:11:08] so how did you achieve that? [08:11:08]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	LordRyan	[08:11:15] also that screenshot is -really- revealing. ._. [08:11:15]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	LordRyan	[08:11:20] i use grml-etc-core's defaults [08:11:20]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	FoH	[08:16:13] As for the behaviour of meta-backspace, it's a matter of opinion. it is possible to make a wrapper that removes / from $wORDCHARS, then calls the backward-kill-word widget, and bind it to meta-backspace, instead: [08:16:13]
2016-10-28 22:16:46	FoH	[08:16:14]  backward-kill-dir () { local WORDCHARS=${WORDCHARS/\/} ; zle backward-kill-word } ; zle -N backward-kill-dir ; bindkey '^[^?' backward-kill-dir [08:16:14]

2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[06:04:49] hi.. ctrl-y pastes previously deleted text.. what if i want the same text deleted again.. is there a shortcut for that..? [06:04:49]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[06:12:41] i found undo in the output of bindkey.. ^_ [06:12:41]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[06:28:03] also, alt(esc) + backspace does the same thing as ctrl+w... which is to delete the previous word.. whereas alt+bakspc should delete the smallest unit above a character..for example one directory in a path (not the entire path)... am i wrong.. how should i make zsh do that? [06:28:03]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[07:26:11] for now i have been adding stuff to my zshrc as i find it apart from the initial config options that were presented on the first zsh launch.. would a plugin manager or framework be recommended... [07:26:11]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	FoH	[07:40:01] not really.  i, for one, prefer to know what my config is up to. [07:40:01]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[07:48:32] yeah... i guess a framework is out of question for me as well.. [07:48:32]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[07:49:16] junkmechanic: separate it to include .zprofile and .zlogin [07:49:16]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[07:49:23] but what about a plugin manager. it seems like it eases the pain to a certain degree without being overbearing... [07:49:23]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[07:49:30] i put all my alias and env-modifying stuff in .zprofile and functions in .zlogin [07:49:30]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[07:51:29] LordRyan: zprofile and zlogin are sourced once at login  (considering you are runing an x session).. would the settings persist for each new shell? kinda dumb question .. but want to confirm.. [07:51:29]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[07:51:43] yes [07:51:43]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[07:51:54] cool.. [07:51:54]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[07:52:39] for example i plan to include autosuggestions and zaw... for now i have clone these in a dir (~/.zsh) and source it in my zshrc.. [07:52:39]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[07:53:10] is that how you guys (FoH and LordRyan ) manage 'plugins' as well.. [07:53:10]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[07:53:38] that's how i do it [07:53:38]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[07:53:45] i actually manage it by using this subtree system [07:53:45]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	FoH	[07:54:49] i've never delved into the world of plugins [07:54:49]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[07:55:49] i have grml-etc-core and that's it at the moment [07:55:49]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[07:57:23] what is grml.. i keep coming across this... [07:57:23]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[07:57:47] someone's initials.? [07:57:47]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[07:59:00] https://grml.org/faq/#whatmeans [07:59:00]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[07:59:21] it's supposed to be what it phonetically sounds like [07:59:21]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[07:59:27] the personification of frustration [07:59:27]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[08:00:42] that... was disappointingly simple... [08:00:42]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[08:00:45] :D [08:00:45]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[08:00:58] i guess you could say [08:00:58]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[08:01:00] it was [08:01:00]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[08:01:06] FRUSTRATINGLY simple :P [08:01:06]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[08:01:28] hah.. [08:01:28]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[08:02:15] oh btw, i have added reverse-menu-complete to my zshrc.. but it doesnt work in tandem with tab.. [08:02:15]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[08:03:27] as in when i press tab, it lists the options.. and i can cycle forward with tab.. but in the middle of the cycle if i press shift-tab it would reverse-cycle for the next round of complletions... [08:03:27]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[08:04:28] is that because the mechanism for setting up tab and shift-tab for completions are different? [08:04:28]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[08:05:37] i'm not sure honestly [08:05:37]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[08:06:22] how do you have that set up if so [08:06:22]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[08:10:02] http://i.imgur.com/etE9eDO.png [08:10:02]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[08:10:06] i push tab, it goes to the next one [08:10:06]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[08:10:16] i push shift-tab, it goes to the previous one [08:10:16]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[08:10:20] if i go over the limit it wraps around [08:10:20]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[08:11:08] so how did you achieve that? [08:11:08]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[08:11:15] also that screenshot is -really- revealing. ._. [08:11:15]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[08:11:20] i use grml-etc-core's defaults [08:11:20]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	FoH	[08:16:13] As for the behaviour of meta-backspace, it's a matter of opinion. it is possible to make a wrapper that removes / from $wORDCHARS, then calls the backward-kill-word widget, and bind it to meta-backspace, instead: [08:16:13]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	FoH	[08:16:14] backward-kill-dir () { local WORDCHARS=${WORDCHARS/\/} ; zle backward-kill-word } ; zle -N backward-kill-dir ; bindkey '^[^?' backward-kill-dir [08:16:14]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[08:17:25] woah.. thanks FoH .. [08:17:25]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	FoH	[08:17:57] np. (i learned it from here) :) [08:17:57]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	junkmechanic	[08:22:19] LordRyan: if you think i d have deduced that from the screenshot, you are underestimating my ignorance... [08:22:19]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[08:22:48] junkmechanic: i more meant there's other information in that screenshot [08:22:48]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[08:22:59] it has my GPG keys, the fact that I'm in debt, and the fact that I'm job hunting. [08:22:59]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[08:23:20] public key, not private, of course. [08:23:20]
2016-10-28 22:29:34	LordRyan	[08:24:20] junkmechanic: you could have deduced it by the fact i said i use grml-etc-core earlier tho :P [08:24:20]

2016-10-29 11:30:56	DHowett	but if the files are up-to-date as of the last compilation, it will use the .zwc instead of re-parsing

2016-10-29 11:34:03	DHowett	you don't want your cache to report residency when the backing file is gone, after all

2016-10-29 11:35:37	thecat	I have never heard this before
2016-10-29 11:35:52	DHowett	which input files/functions are covered by the zcompiled cache
2016-10-29 11:37:22	DHowett	it doesn't seem to be quite so sophisticated as all that.
2016-10-29 11:37:39	DHowett	It looks like zsh aggregtes the functions in the directory and then looks for them in the cache
2016-10-29 11:37:46	DHowett	so if the directory is missing, or a file is missing, the cache will never be consulted
2016-10-29 11:37:52	DHowett	and the function will not exist

2016-10-29 12:25:08	DHowett	[21:37:39] It looks like zsh aggregtes the functions in the directory and then looks for them in the cache [21:37:39]

2016-10-29 18:39:21	llua	[17:33:58] if you don't want to fix the script, yea. [17:33:58]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	Evidlo	[17:48:42] at what point do the scripts in /etc/profile.d get sourced/called? [17:48:42]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	llua	[17:49:04] whenever your vendor decided to source them [17:49:04]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	llua	[17:49:16] prob in zprofile [17:49:16]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	danielsh	[18:14:25] Evidlo, that script needs to check `ps -p $$` (or $BASH_VERSION and $ZSH_VERSION), not $SHELL [18:14:25]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	Evidlo	[18:17:28] looks like my distro just packages old version.  github version is different [18:17:28]

2016-10-29 18:39:21	thecat	[20:29:39] they don't seem to be used [20:29:39]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	thecat	[20:29:52] If I remove Unix/_foo then completion for foo stops working, even though it is compiled in Unix.zwc [20:29:52]

2016-10-29 18:39:21	osse	[20:50:37] silas_: because you're assigning a string, not an array [20:50:37]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	osse	[20:50:49] silas_: x=(1${^a}2) [20:50:49]

2016-10-29 18:39:21	silas_	[20:53:07] osse: why it is not necessary (actually, it doesn't work) to use parenthesis for the echo statement? [20:53:07]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	BrainDamage	[20:53:44] i want to grep for a string containg a tab character, having loaded the completion module just pressing tab wouln't do ofc, i know the echo function can expand the \t escape code, must i go trough that eg in a var or in a pipe, or is there a more elegant way to get escape resolved before executing grep? [20:53:44]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	osse	[20:54:00] silas_: the context is different [20:54:00]
2016-10-29 18:39:21	osse	[20:54:19] silas_: in the echo case you're allowed to use expansions that result in multiple distinct words [20:54:19]

2016-10-29 23:10:15	llua	[17:49:04] whenever your vendor decided to source them [17:49:04]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	llua	[17:49:16] prob in zprofile [17:49:16]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	danielsh	[18:14:25] Evidlo, that script needs to check `ps -p $$` (or $BASH_VERSION and $ZSH_VERSION), not $SHELL [18:14:25]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	Evidlo	[18:17:28] looks like my distro just packages old version.  github version is different [18:17:28]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	simmel	[18:19:34] llua: aaah! It's bound to rationalise-dot from http://grml.org/zsh/zsh-lovers.html#_completion How can I change it to don't abort history search? [18:19:34]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	llua	[18:20:39] fixing it [18:20:39]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	danielsh	[18:38:25] simmel, bindkey -M isearch . self-insert [18:38:25]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	simmel	[18:54:36] danielsh: Sweet! That works! Thank you! [18:54:36]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	simmel	[18:55:39] llua: What is an non-invasive way of changing the LBUFFER? [18:55:39]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	danielsh	[19:04:15] :) [19:04:15]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	thecat	[20:29:12] in fpath, there are directories such as /usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion/Unix/ [20:29:12]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	thecat	[20:29:22] but there also exist compiled files for every directory: [20:29:22]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	thecat	[20:29:24] /usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion/Unix.zwc [20:29:24]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	thecat	[20:29:30] what is the purpose of these .zwc files [20:29:30]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	thecat	[20:29:39] they don't seem to be used [20:29:39]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	thecat	[20:29:52] If I remove Unix/_foo then completion for foo stops working, even though it is compiled in Unix.zwc [20:29:52]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	silas_	[20:48:44] Hi all.  a=(a b c); echo 1${^a}2   prints 1a2 1b2 1c2.  But a=(a b c); x=1${^a}2; echo $x   prints 1a b c2.   Why can't I use the ${^a} thing for variable assignment? [20:48:44]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	osse	[20:50:37] silas_: because you're assigning a string, not an array [20:50:37]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	osse	[20:50:49] silas_: x=(1${^a}2) [20:50:49]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	silas_	[20:51:46] osse: hmmm, that worked.  thanks! [20:51:46]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	silas_	[20:53:07] osse: why it is not necessary (actually, it doesn't work) to use parenthesis for the echo statement? [20:53:07]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	BrainDamage	[20:53:44] i want to grep for a string containg a tab character, having loaded the completion module just pressing tab wouln't do ofc, i know the echo function can expand the \t escape code, must i go trough that eg in a var or in a pipe, or is there a more elegant way to get escape resolved before executing grep? [20:53:44]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	osse	[20:54:00] silas_: the context is different [20:54:00]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	osse	[20:54:19] silas_: in the echo case you're allowed to use expansions that result in multiple distinct words [20:54:19]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	osse	[20:54:51] BrainDamage: grep $'blah\tmoreblah' [20:54:51]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	osse	[20:55:01] silas_: inside array=(...) you can also do that [20:55:01]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	osse	[20:55:11] with string=... you can't [20:55:11]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	BrainDamage	[20:55:12] ah, excellent [20:55:12]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	silas_	[20:58:45] osse: nice!  thanks for the help! [20:58:45]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	llua	[21:18:03] thecat: they are preparsed forms of zsh code [21:18:03]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	thecat	[21:26:12] llua: but as I said, they don't seem to be used [21:26:12]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	thecat	[21:26:44] I can delete them, and everything works all right [21:26:44]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	thecat	[21:27:23] if, on the other hand, I delete the Unix/ directory and only leave Unix.zwc nothing works [21:27:23]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	DHowett	[21:30:35] thecat: it's likely used as an optimization. If Unix/ exists, and the files in it are newer than the .zwc, it will be ignored; if Unix/ doesn't exist, it "differs" from the .zwc, and it will be ignored [21:30:35]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	DHowett	[21:30:56] but if the files are up-to-date as of the last compilation, it will use the .zwc instead of re-parsing [21:30:56]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	DHowett	[21:31:10] that does, however, make it difficult to determine that it is being used ;P [21:31:10]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	DHowett	[21:33:39] it's likely some combination of the mtime of the directory, the mtime of the files inside it, and file residency [21:33:39]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	DHowett	[21:34:03] you don't want your cache to report residency when the backing file is gone, after all [21:34:03]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	thecat	[21:35:14] DHowett: what does "file residency" mean ? [21:35:14]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	thecat	[21:35:37] I have never heard this before [21:35:37]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	DHowett	[21:35:52] which input files/functions are covered by the zcompiled cache [21:35:52]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	DHowett	[21:37:22] it doesn't seem to be quite so sophisticated as all that. [21:37:22]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	DHowett	[21:37:39] It looks like zsh aggregtes the functions in the directory and then looks for them in the cache [21:37:39]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	DHowett	[21:37:46] so if the directory is missing, or a file is missing, the cache will never be consulted [21:37:46]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	DHowett	[21:37:52] and the function will not exist [21:37:52]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	thecat	[21:40:32] if I modify Unix/_foo, so that _foo has newer mtime than Unix.zwc [21:40:32]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	thecat	[21:40:43] does that invalidate the whole Unix.zwc ? [21:40:43]
2016-10-29 23:10:15	DHowett	[21:41:14] i believe, but i'm not 100% sure [21:41:14]

2016-10-30 05:38:49	ph88	just asking if the extra alias is required .. guess not ^^

2016-10-30 06:07:08	Mikachu	is that a trick question

2016-10-30 06:07:57	danielsh	well, yes
2016-10-30 06:08:25	danielsh	the actual case is "read 20 octets from a file", I assume that requires nomultibyte

2016-10-31 00:23:15	Mikachu	[16:07:38] so is the input in fact abc and the output should be 616263? [16:07:38]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	danielsh	[16:07:57] well, yes [16:07:57]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	danielsh	[16:08:25] the actual case is "read 20 octets from a file", I assume that requires nomultibyte [16:08:25]

2016-10-31 00:23:15	Mikachu	[16:12:28] those numbers won't be zero padded though [16:12:28]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	Mikachu	[16:12:32] okay really gone now [16:12:32]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	danielsh	[16:12:55] cheers [16:12:55]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	ralpheeee	[16:45:42] if a directory has a capital letter at the beginning zsh will not find the directory unless i also use a capital...how can i include this ? [16:45:42]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	danielsh	[16:46:52] look at the 'matcher-list' style [16:46:52]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	llua	[16:48:01] zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list '' 'm:{[:lower:][:upper:]}={[:upper:][:lower:]}' [16:48:01]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	ralpheeee	[16:52:46] ok so i currently have in my zshrc  zstyle ':completion:*' menu select [16:52:46]
2016-10-31 00:23:15	ralpheeee	[17:00:51] ok..nvm ....i thought i could merge into one line...thxs!!! [17:00:51]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	KKona	[21:19:31] Hi, I've made a small hook for a git prompt so if HEAD isn't a sym ref, it prints the short SHA for the latest commit instead of branchname, but somehow hook_com[branch]="%12.12i" doesn't seem to be interpreted correctly. Why? [21:19:31]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	danielsh	[23:28:08] KKona, I assume %i escapes in [branch] aren't interpreted.  But sounds like putting %i in the formats style would do what you want [23:28:08]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	KKona	[23:31:53] danielsh: yes I figured it out, but I made another "trick" like this: pastebin.com/rTkVpmPp [23:31:53]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	KKona	[23:32:12] http://pastebin.com/rTkVpmPp [23:32:12]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	danielsh	[23:35:20] I still don't see why you need a hook [23:35:20]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	danielsh	[23:35:40] but if you do need a hook, you could optimise a bit by putting the rev-parse inside the if [23:35:40]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	KKona	[23:48:01] danielsh:  well i'm using this method so it replaces my entire branch "%b" [23:48:01]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	KKona	[23:48:16] i've not find other method to do it [23:48:16]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	danielsh	[23:58:10] Like I said, just put %i instead of %b in the stlye [23:58:10]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	KKona	[00:01:19] ohhhhhhhhhhh [00:01:19]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	KKona	[00:01:43] I thought that was going to show everytime [00:01:43]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	KKona	[00:01:48] wait I'm confused [00:01:48]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	KKona	[00:05:42] danielsh: are you suggesting to not use the hook script at all and just use %i in zstyle formats? [00:05:42]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	danielsh	[00:07:05] yes [00:07:05]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	KKona	[00:09:24] but this will keep showing me "heads/master" for eg [00:09:24]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	KKona	[00:10:15] like "foo@bar on heads/master 9af882a331..." instead of just "foo@bar on 9af882a331..." [00:10:15]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	KKona	[00:10:48] since i dont replace the branch with my hook_com[branch]="$sha" [00:10:48]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	KKona	[00:11:15] maybe you thought I added to the branch but i'm not using "+=" just "=" to replace entirely [00:11:15]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	danielsh	[01:08:50] no, I misunderstood your use-case. [01:08:50]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	KKona	[01:18:58] danielsh: anyway I'm using your solution, its way more simple and it uses zsh made option [01:18:58]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	KKona	[01:20:06] by using "%7.7i" i'm getting exact same output i need [01:20:06]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	KKona	[01:43:57] danielsh: last little thing, i have formats "%b%c%u %m %i" in my config. do you know how I can avoid 2 blank spaces between "%b%c%u" and "%i" when I dont have %m output? [01:43:57]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	danielsh	[01:53:19] look at ternary conditionals under zformat [01:53:19]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	KKona	[02:03:38] danielsh: like (!.root.nonroot) thing? [02:03:38]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	psprint	[09:42:56] in 5.3 there are gonna be new special parameters? I want to use such parameter instead of is-at-least – $+param to test for 5.3. Any idea for parameter that can be used? [09:42:56]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	psprint	[09:44:02] ZSH_SCRIPT maybe, log says: "$ZSH_SCRIPT is POSIX $0 but always availble" [09:44:02]
2016-10-31 00:23:16	psprint	[09:47:06] hehe but this changed and it isn't always available [09:47:06]

2016-10-31 01:31:11	KKona	[23:48:16] i've not find other method to do it [23:48:16]
2016-10-31 01:31:11	danielsh	[23:58:10] Like I said, just put %i instead of %b in the stlye [23:58:10]
2016-10-31 01:31:11	KKona	[00:01:19] ohhhhhhhhhhh [00:01:19]
2016-10-31 01:31:11	KKona	[00:01:43] I thought that was going to show everytime [00:01:43]
2016-10-31 01:31:11	KKona	[00:01:48] wait I'm confused [00:01:48]
2016-10-31 01:31:11	KKona	[00:05:42] danielsh: are you suggesting to not use the hook script at all and just use %i in zstyle formats? [00:05:42]
2016-10-31 01:31:11	danielsh	[00:07:05] yes [00:07:05]
2016-10-31 01:31:11	KKona	[00:09:24] but this will keep showing me "heads/master" for eg [00:09:24]
2016-10-31 01:31:11	KKona	[00:10:15] like "foo@bar on heads/master 9af882a331..." instead of just "foo@bar on 9af882a331..." [00:10:15]
2016-10-31 01:31:11	KKona	[00:10:48] since i dont replace the branch with my hook_com[branch]="$sha" [00:10:48]
2016-10-31 01:31:11	KKona	[00:11:15] maybe you thought I added to the branch but i'm not using "+=" just "=" to replace entirely [00:11:15]
2016-10-31 01:31:11	danielsh	[01:08:50] no, I misunderstood your use-case. [01:08:50]
2016-10-31 01:31:11	KKona	[01:18:58] danielsh: anyway I'm using your solution, its way more simple and it uses zsh made option [01:18:58]
2016-10-31 01:31:11	KKona	[01:20:06] by using "%7.7i" i'm getting exact same output i need [01:20:06]
2016-10-31 01:31:11	KKona	[01:43:57] danielsh: last little thing, i have formats "%b%c%u %m %i" in my config. do you know how I can avoid 2 blank spaces between "%b%c%u" and "%i" when I dont have %m output? [01:43:57]
2016-10-31 01:31:11	danielsh	[01:53:19] look at ternary conditionals under zformat [01:53:19]
2016-10-31 01:31:11	KKona	[02:03:38] danielsh: like (!.root.nonroot) thing? [02:03:38]
2016-10-31 01:31:11	psprint	[09:42:56] in 5.3 there are gonna be new special parameters? I want to use such parameter instead of is-at-least – $+param to test for 5.3. Any idea for parameter that can be used? [09:42:56]

2016-10-31 05:53:13	ph88	hey guys, i have this function to use xdg-open    open() { xdg-open "$@" &! }    problem is though that i want open to support multiple arguments which then should all be opened. But xdg-open just takes 1 argument so i would have to rewrite it as:   xdg-open file1.txt && xdg-open file2.txt     how can i do this in the function ?
2016-10-31 05:54:43	dadrc	foo() { for i in "$@"; do echo "Arg: $i"; done }
2016-10-31 05:54:54	ph88	oh thank you :)

2016-10-31 05:55:40	Mikachu	if you do that, you should  also put local i; first
2016-10-31 05:56:02	Mikachu	a cheap trick is to do for 1 in "$@"; ... $1 ...; done instead though
2016-10-31 05:56:32	Mikachu	also, in "$@" is redundant, just for i; will default to the positional arguments
2016-10-31 05:56:58	dadrc	now that's news to me.
2016-10-31 05:57:03	Mikachu	and if you're super lazy, you can do things like
2016-10-31 05:57:09	Mikachu	> () for 1 { echo $1 } a b c
2016-10-31 05:57:10	machabot	Mikachu: a

2016-10-31 05:57:16	ph88	like this?   open() { local i; for i in "$@"; do xdg-open "$i"; done }
2016-10-31 05:57:26	Mikachu	yeah
2016-10-31 05:57:29	ph88	or this even    open() { local i; for i; do xdg-open "$i"; done }
2016-10-31 05:57:39	Mikachu	yeah
2016-10-31 05:57:44	ph88	cool
2016-10-31 05:58:00	Mikachu	without the local, it will stop on any $i outside the function
2016-10-31 05:58:03	ph88	maybe i keep the version with "$@" because i have a better idea what it means

2016-10-31 13:42:04	ph88	[15:53:13] hey guys, i have this function to use xdg-open    open() { xdg-open "$@" &! }    problem is though that i want open to support multiple arguments which then should all be opened. But xdg-open just takes 1 argument so i would have to rewrite it as:   xdg-open file1.txt && xdg-open file2.txt     how can i do this in the function ? [15:53:13]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	dadrc	[15:54:43] foo() { for i in "$@"; do echo "Arg: $i"; done } [15:54:43]

2016-10-31 13:42:04	Mikachu	[15:55:40] if you do that, you should  also put local i; first [15:55:40]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	Mikachu	[15:56:01] a cheap trick is to do for 1 in "$@"; ... $1 ...; done instead though [15:56:01]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	Mikachu	[15:56:32] also, in "$@" is redundant, just for i; will default to the positional arguments [15:56:32]
2016-10-31 13:42:04	dadrc	[15:56:58] now that's news to me. [15:56:58]

2016-10-31 16:21:05	ErhardtMundt	[00:44:48] I'm trying to move away from omz with the purpose to learn more about the shell itself [00:44:48]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	danielsh	[01:05:34] "closest" do you mean approximate matching, or do you mean "most recent" ? [01:05:34]
2016-10-31 16:21:05	danielsh	[01:06:46] this sounds similar to the history-incremental-pattern-search-backward widget. [01:06:46]

2016-11-02 00:56:16	llua	[18:23:29] !omz > barhom [18:23:29]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	machabot	[18:23:29] barhom: "omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the channel #oh-my-zsh. [18:23:29]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	llua	[18:24:57] not sure why it is escaping the =, but the other metacharacters need to be escaped if you intend for them to not be treated as syntax [18:24:57]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	danielsh	[18:26:06] EQUALS option, I guess [18:26:06]

2016-11-02 00:56:16	monokrome	[23:42:32] EG, if I type somed<tab>, I expect it to expand to somedir [23:42:32]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	LordRyan	[23:42:47] it works by default on my grml-etc-core setup [23:42:47]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	thrig	[23:43:26] and in my pretty-much-default-except-I-typed-setopt autocd setup [23:43:26]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	LordRyan	[23:44:17] thrig: i'm not promoting grml-etc-core as much as i am saying that it's doable and somewhere in there is how to do it :P [23:44:17]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	monokrome	[23:45:30] I have a mostly default setup. My .zshrc is here: https://gist.github.com/monokrome/521cbe5efc063d28743660445c693543 [23:45:30]

2016-11-02 00:56:16	monokrome	[00:03:51] Is there a way to use history, but only have it in memory? Instead of in a file? [00:03:51]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	LordRyan	[00:06:02] monokrome: is there a reason to not keep it in a file? [00:06:02]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	monokrome	[00:10:26] LordRyan: read only filesystem [00:10:26]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	LordRyan	[00:11:08] Set histfile to somewhere in /tmp [00:11:08]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	LordRyan	[00:12:00] If you want it to be random each time zsh starts use a mktemp and clean on zshlogout [00:12:00]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	DHowett	[00:12:19] perhaps you could just set SAVEHIST=0? [00:12:19]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	DHowett	[00:13:03] or just unset HISTFILE [00:13:03]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	DHowett	[00:13:10] > The file to save the history in when an interactive shell exits.  If unset, the history is not saved. [00:13:10]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	machabot	[00:13:10] DHowett: zsh: command not found: The [00:13:10]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	DHowett	[00:13:19] it implies history is kept in memory, but not saved [00:13:19]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	DHowett	[00:13:44] unless you want cross-shell in-memory history; in that case, choose a file in /tmp or /dev/shm to use for all your shells. [00:13:44]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	ft	[00:32:23] Zsh's default behaviour is actually not to save history to disk, because HISTFILE is not set by default. [00:32:23]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	DHowett	[00:38:35] monokrome: so based on all that, you should be set [00:38:35]
2016-11-02 00:56:16	llua	[04:01:58] zv: no [04:01:58]

2016-11-02 05:31:03	wewlad	I want to learn, I'm not looking for comfortable presets which some packages like omz provide (I guess they provide).

2016-11-02 05:35:39	wewlad	the script should also suggest some presets for people who can't understand what's the right value for the current prompt is

2016-11-02 12:00:59	llua	[15:04:20] zayita: PATH [15:04:20]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	zayita	[15:04:21] llua: `path' an array of directories zsh uses to find external commands. the array has the tied parameter attribute set which pairs it to the variable PATH, changing one updates the other. Any changes to path causes zsh to rebuild it's hash of commands [15:04:21]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	llua	[15:05:53] danielsh: can that be made case sensitive? [15:05:53]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	psprint	[15:06:19] I think here is a bug in Zsh: it reports – _hsmw_main:119: bad pattern: (#m)($([a-zA-Z0-9_:]##([[^\]]#])(#c0,1))|($[{](([a-zA-Z0@%#]##))(#c0,1)[a-zA-Z0-9_:#]##([[^\]]#])(#c0,1)[ [15:06:19]

2016-11-02 12:00:59	psprint	[15:07:08] the pattern works in other place [15:07:08]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	psprint	[15:08:31] ah no, I had "}" unquoted, in ${...// } it requires quoting [15:08:31]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	wewlad	[15:29:58] hello zeashers [15:29:58]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	wewlad	[15:30:19] I'm new to zsh, they say it's very powerful [15:30:19]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	wewlad	[15:31:03] I want to learn, I'm not looking for comfortable presets which some packages like omz provide (I guess they provide). [15:31:03]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	wewlad	[15:31:21] so I've started the zsh-newuser-install survey [15:31:21]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	RichiH	[15:31:29] wewlad: omz provides more pain than presets [15:31:29]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	wewlad	[15:31:38] and got to the approximation and correction [15:31:38]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	wewlad	[15:31:57] and I got stuck in a trap 'please enter a number' [15:31:57]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	RichiH	[15:32:02] wewlad: the Way Of The Z is to read through a dozen or so configs and steal what you think might be useful [15:32:02]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	wewlad	[15:32:08] enter maximum number of errors allowed [15:32:08]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	wewlad	[15:32:42] RichiH: that's right, but I've started from that survey first [15:32:42]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	wewlad	[15:32:49] and I'm here to whine [15:32:49]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	wewlad	[15:33:13] I think although it sounds ridiculous at first - a survey like that should also have an optional GUI [15:33:13]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	RichiH	[15:33:24] i agree [15:33:24]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	wewlad	[15:33:26] why a gui if you configure a shell's options? [15:33:26]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	RichiH	[15:33:29] most modern shells have a gui [15:33:29]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	wewlad	[15:33:48] because this way you'll be able to see all of the settings at once [15:33:48]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	wewlad	[15:34:22] without remembering path to each of them, + it could have hints with rich explanations [15:34:22]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	wewlad	[15:34:36] and that's important, because I'm choosing the completion now and it lacks any description almost at all: 'Basic completion.' mkay. 'Approximate completion: completion with correction of existing word.' I guess it fixes typos, mkay. 'Correction: correct existing word, no completion'. Wut? Hold on, how's that different from the previous one? By just not autocompleting after fixing a typo? 'Expansion: use globbing and parameter su [15:34:36]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	wewlad	[15:34:36] bstitution, if possible' Aaaaalright. I surely got it. Aha. [15:34:36]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	wewlad	[15:35:39] the script should also suggest some presets for people who can't understand what's the right value for the current prompt is [15:35:39]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	wewlad	[15:36:12] like is it 1-2 or something more like 5-6? [15:36:12]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	wewlad	[15:36:53] would be nice to have some stats of other people's choice for that setting, so that I could at least relate. [15:36:53]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	llua	[15:39:34] what modern shells have a gui? [15:39:34]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	wewlad	[15:41:10] I think he was being sarcastic, as if I suggested a stupid thing: a gui configurator for a non-gui program [15:41:10]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	danielsh	[15:44:41] llua, may require a code change.  (Guessing; haven't looked) [15:44:41]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	llua	[15:45:05] there was talks about improving zsh-newuser-install a year or so ago, no one was interested enough to actually do it though. [15:45:05]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	danielsh	[15:45:46] I think Oliver has some ideas on that [15:45:46]

2016-11-02 12:00:59	psprint	[16:20:14] hah implemented apparently fast blacklist via eval:  extension of black list is blist+="|| (( \$input >= idx1 && \$input <= idx2 ))", this way when there is no success, $? != 0 signals $input is not in any blacklisted range [16:20:14]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	danielsh	[16:28:52] what's the novelty here? [16:28:52]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	psprint	[16:29:45] well for me it's novel because following first solution was taking 700 ms iirc, compared to 150 ms: : ${__hsmw_blacklist[@]//(#b)([[:digit:]]##) ([[:digit:]]##)/$(( inblist = ( (offset + $1 - 1) >= match[1] && (offset + $2) <= match[2]) ? 1 : inblist ))} [16:29:45]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	danielsh	[16:31:23] so what's the slow part? [16:31:23]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	danielsh	[16:31:29] $(( ))?  ternary conditional? [16:31:29]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	danielsh	[16:31:54] given that $(( )) parses the inside as a double-quoted string, it could easily be slow.. [16:31:54]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	psprint	[16:32:03] rather matching two numbers in long sequence of strings [16:32:03]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	danielsh	[16:33:08] I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing :/ [16:33:08]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	psprint	[17:09:04] dammit, evaluating black list is fast, but gathering it, either as a string, array or hash, is slow, 200 ms compared to 150 ms eval of what's gathered [17:09:04]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	wewlad	[17:14:44] keep it in ram [17:14:44]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	psprint	[17:15:57] hehe it's all in memory, I'm basically counting cycles to keep something fast, and will have to resign of a feature [17:15:57]
2016-11-02 12:00:59	psprint	[17:54:05] Mikachu: why array[max_size]=""; array[++idx]=... in a loop isn't faster than without the size reservation? [17:54:05]

2016-11-02 23:27:13	mozzarella	[04:09:25] right, I guess it's something else gnome-terminal was doing… [04:09:25]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	llua	[04:09:39] or something your dotfiles is doing [04:09:39]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	mozzarella	[04:09:52] but when I opened a new tab it set the working directory to that of teh previous tab [04:09:52]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	mozzarella	[04:10:15] I want that behavior back [04:10:15]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	mozzarella	[04:10:55] it was from one of those default startup scripts that ship with fedora [04:10:55]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	mozzarella	[06:33:45] guys help [06:33:45]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	machabot	[06:33:46] ask a question [06:33:46]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	mozzarella	[06:33:53] I did that already [06:33:53]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	mozzarella	[06:34:19] is that bot setup just for me? [06:34:19]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	LordRyan	[06:38:55] no [06:38:55]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	LordRyan	[06:38:59] guys help [06:38:59]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	LordRyan	[06:39:04] hm guess it is [06:39:04]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	LordRyan	[06:39:23] it's probably set to respond to that if you say 'help' within a certain amount of time when joining [06:39:23]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	LordRyan	[06:40:48] mozzarella: perhaps write a shell function `cd` that both puts you in the directory and records it to a file [06:40:48]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	LordRyan	[06:41:06] and then write an rc function to put you in that directory [06:41:06]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	LordRyan	[06:41:12] which personally i don't recommend but if you want it then w/e [06:41:12]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	Mikachu	[07:08:09] LordRyan: i'm pretty sure it's hardcoded to him just because he's so annoying [07:08:09]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	Mikachu	[07:08:17] but it doesn't seem to help [07:08:17]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	limbo_	[07:46:17] updated to zsh 5.2 and bracketed paste magic isn't working right. [07:46:17]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	limbo_	[07:49:43] It wasn't wrking before, but I just got this upgrade today. [07:49:43]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	Mikachu	[08:10:50] limbo_: what is your metric for determining whether it works right? [08:10:50]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	limbo_	[08:11:49] escapes ? in pasted urls, doesn't print a warning and a ~ at the end of the pasted line. [08:11:49]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	limbo_	[08:12:27] No such shell function `bracketed-paste' [08:12:27]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	Mikachu	[08:13:43] my only suggestion is replacing url-quote-magic and bracketed-paste-magic with bracketed-paste-url-magic [08:13:43]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	mozzarella	[08:21:01] Mikachu: how am I annoying? [08:21:01]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	psprint	[08:23:30] Mikachu: why array[max_size]=""; array[++idx]=... in a loop isn't faster than without the size reservation? [08:23:30]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	Mikachu	[08:28:50] who knows [08:28:50]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	Mikachu	[08:30:26] mozzarella: http://mika.l3ib.org/tmp/a782fdb3636ffe7329218e977f4ac41f.txt [08:30:26]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	mozzarella	[08:33:05] yeah, but those span a few years, I only ask for help every few months [08:33:05]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	LordRyan	[08:41:04] Mikachu: in their defense I usually say "Greetings" in response to everyone so :P [08:41:04]
2016-11-02 23:27:13	LordRyan	[08:42:16] If I were to grep greetings, and have a dollar for every matched line, i would be set for life [08:42:16]

Got a problem with scp, tab autocompletion can't connect to one of my servers, even though ssh server works just fine, on server side I get 'sshd[29216]: Connection closed by a.b.c.d [preauth]' four times when I do 'scp server:<tab>'. Do you guys have any idea what might be going on?

2016-11-03 06:34:41	danielsh	morning
2016-11-03 06:34:43	sfrique	can anyone help me, i am trying to add an alias with "pwd" at it.. but i just want to evaluate it when i actual run the alias
2016-11-03 06:35:11	sfrique	so the pwd will be the folder i am at when I run the aliased command
2016-11-03 06:35:16	Marlinski	danielsh: but in the zsh that's calling the screen is not enough ?
2016-11-03 06:35:40	danielsh	Marlinski, probably not.  the keystrokes won't even reach that zsh
2016-11-03 06:35:50	danielsh	alias foo='echo $PWD'

2016-11-03 22:49:42	danielsh	[16:34:20] you need to that bindkey in screen, not in the zsh that's within it [16:34:20]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	danielsh	[16:34:41] morning [16:34:41]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	sfrique	[16:34:43] can anyone help me, i am trying to add an alias with "pwd" at it.. but i just want to evaluate it when i actual run the alias [16:34:43]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	sfrique	[16:35:11] so the pwd will be the folder i am at when I run the aliased command [16:35:11]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	Marlinski	[16:35:16] danielsh: but in the zsh that's calling the screen is not enough ? [16:35:16]
2016-11-03 22:49:42	danielsh	[16:35:40] Marlinski, probably not.  the keystrokes won't even reach that zsh [16:35:40]

2016-11-04 14:11:07	frmendes	[09:55:58] I asked this yesterday but had to leave. Does anyone know why zsh is ignoring {} commands? cat {a,b}.txt [09:55:58]
2016-11-04 14:11:07	frmendes	[09:56:07] I have ignorebraces unset [09:56:07]

2016-11-04 14:11:07	osse	[10:01:56] try with echo instead of cat [10:01:56]
2016-11-04 14:11:07	frmendes	[10:03:23] it works... it's not working with some ruby commands, though [10:03:23]
2016-11-04 14:11:07	crs	[10:04:04] Hey, I am trying to get my head around zcompile. How does it work? If I do zcompile file.zsh, then source file.zsh, will it source compiled file instead of original? [10:04:04]
2016-11-04 14:11:07	danielsh	[13:02:59] crs, none; ask zsh-users@ [13:02:59]
2016-11-04 14:11:07	danielsh	[13:03:15] zcompile is for autoload isn't it [13:03:15]
2016-11-04 14:11:07	Mikachu	[13:14:27] zcompile works for any script file [13:14:27]

2016-11-04 14:11:07	shabble	[15:00:47] there's some mention of >&! and >>&! in zshredirection, but not the last bit itself, and the description there isn't super informative [15:00:47]

2016-11-04 14:11:08	derf0	[15:02:27] ah, and more details are in zshbuiltins (look for '&!' or 'disown') [15:02:27]
2016-11-04 14:11:08	derf0	[15:02:44] though note that >&! and >>&! are (AFAIK) quite different than those cases. [15:02:44]
2016-11-04 14:11:08	shabble	[15:03:16] yeah, I think they were confusing matters for me [15:03:16]
2016-11-04 14:11:08	shabble	[15:08:06] ok, that solves that mystery :) [15:08:06]
2016-11-04 14:11:08	shabble	[15:09:03] given the crappiness of most search engines for 'random punctuation', i wonder if there's any simple way to say, grep all the zsh-related manpages at once [15:09:03]

2016-11-04 14:11:08	danielsh	[16:28:20] psprint_, I wonder if you have any insight about making __git_recent_branches() faster on cold disk cache? [16:28:20]

2016-11-04 14:59:32	tomberek	[02:15:18] I suggest that we change: "[[ -x /usr/bin/getent ]] || getent() {" into "[[ -n ${commands[getent]} ]] || getent() {" [02:15:18]

2016-11-04 14:59:32	frmendes	[09:55:58] I asked this yesterday but had to leave. Does anyone know why zsh is ignoring {} commands? cat {a,b}.txt [09:55:58]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	frmendes	[09:56:07] I have ignorebraces unset [09:56:07]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	osse	[10:01:31] frmendes: ignore them how? [10:01:31]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	frmendes	[10:01:44] well, it only seems to be running the first command [10:01:44]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	osse	[10:01:56] try with echo instead of cat [10:01:56]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	frmendes	[10:03:23] it works... it's not working with some ruby commands, though [10:03:23]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	crs	[10:04:04] Hey, I am trying to get my head around zcompile. How does it work? If I do zcompile file.zsh, then source file.zsh, will it source compiled file instead of original? [10:04:04]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	danielsh	[13:02:59] crs, none; ask zsh-users@ [13:02:59]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	danielsh	[13:03:15] zcompile is for autoload isn't it [13:03:15]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	Mikachu	[13:14:27] zcompile works for any script file [13:14:27]

2016-11-04 14:59:32	shabble	[15:00:08] can anyone point me at where I could find docs/description of '&!' as a command modifier? [15:00:08]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	shabble	[15:00:47] there's some mention of >&! and >>&! in zshredirection, but not the last bit itself, and the description there isn't super informative [15:00:47]

2016-11-04 14:59:32	derf0	[15:02:44] though note that >&! and >>&! are (AFAIK) quite different than those cases. [15:02:44]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	shabble	[15:03:16] yeah, I think they were confusing matters for me [15:03:16]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	shabble	[15:08:06] ok, that solves that mystery :) [15:08:06]
2016-11-04 14:59:32	shabble	[15:09:03] given the crappiness of most search engines for 'random punctuation', i wonder if there's any simple way to say, grep all the zsh-related manpages at once [15:09:03]

2016-11-04 16:45:24	frmendes	[09:55:58] I asked this yesterday but had to leave. Does anyone know why zsh is ignoring {} commands? cat {a,b}.txt [09:55:58]
2016-11-04 16:45:24	frmendes	[09:56:07] I have ignorebraces unset [09:56:07]
2016-11-04 16:45:24	osse	[10:01:31] frmendes: ignore them how? [10:01:31]
2016-11-04 16:45:24	frmendes	[10:01:44] well, it only seems to be running the first command [10:01:44]
2016-11-04 16:45:24	osse	[10:01:56] try with echo instead of cat [10:01:56]
2016-11-04 16:45:24	frmendes	[10:03:23] it works... it's not working with some ruby commands, though [10:03:23]
2016-11-04 16:45:24	crs	[10:04:04] Hey, I am trying to get my head around zcompile. How does it work? If I do zcompile file.zsh, then source file.zsh, will it source compiled file instead of original? [10:04:04]
2016-11-04 16:45:24	danielsh	[13:02:59] crs, none; ask zsh-users@ [13:02:59]
2016-11-04 16:45:24	danielsh	[13:03:15] zcompile is for autoload isn't it [13:03:15]
2016-11-04 16:45:24	Mikachu	[13:14:27] zcompile works for any script file [13:14:27]

2016-11-04 16:45:24	shabble	[15:00:47] there's some mention of >&! and >>&! in zshredirection, but not the last bit itself, and the description there isn't super informative [15:00:47]

2016-11-04 16:45:24	derf0	[15:02:27] ah, and more details are in zshbuiltins (look for '&!' or 'disown') [15:02:27]
2016-11-04 16:45:24	derf0	[15:02:44] though note that >&! and >>&! are (AFAIK) quite different than those cases. [15:02:44]
2016-11-04 16:45:24	shabble	[15:03:16] yeah, I think they were confusing matters for me [15:03:16]
2016-11-04 16:45:24	shabble	[15:08:06] ok, that solves that mystery :) [15:08:06]
2016-11-04 16:45:24	shabble	[15:09:03] given the crappiness of most search engines for 'random punctuation', i wonder if there's any simple way to say, grep all the zsh-related manpages at once [15:09:03]
2016-11-04 16:45:24	phy1729	[15:09:27] man zshall [15:09:27]
2016-11-04 16:45:24	shabble	[15:11:50] yep, that'll do it. [15:11:50]
2016-11-04 16:45:24	danielsh	[16:28:20] psprint_, I wonder if you have any insight about making __git_recent_branches() faster on cold disk cache? [16:28:20]

2016-11-04 16:45:24	adamg	[01:34:12] is there a convenient way of doing an "inline" comment, a-la /* */? for use when working on long oneliners, something nicer than if false; do ...; fi [01:34:12]

Redoing my prompt and tried using the colors set by the color function, but if I use the color arrays set by that function, when I try to use my history search keybinding it will display 5 spaces that aren't actually part of the command when I accept it.
