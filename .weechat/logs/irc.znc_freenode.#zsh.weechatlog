2016-10-17 21:03:37	osse	[15:40:42] ahh [15:40:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	osse	[15:40:58] yeah you just have to magically get into the manpage author's head on that one [15:40:58]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	vbernat	[15:41:08] ok :) [15:41:08]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[15:46:04] you can put a breakpoint in paramsubst and check isarr [15:46:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[15:46:11] or you can use an intermediate variable [15:46:11]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[15:46:21] One of these ways is guaranteed to preserve your sanity. [15:46:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[15:46:41] (the second one) [15:46:41]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	osse	[15:47:42] danielsh: but what if the intermediate variable has the wrong type :p [15:47:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	osse	[15:48:49] > str1=a,b,c; str2=${(s:,:)str1}; echo ${(t)str2} [15:48:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	machabot	[15:48:49] osse: scalar [15:48:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:32:42] howdy folks, when i try to do history -i I get fc: event not found: -i [17:32:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:32:48] same goes for -E [17:32:48]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:33:15] am i not specifying my parameter correctly? [17:33:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	thrig	[17:35:35] is there anything in the history? [17:35:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:35:59] yes [17:35:59]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:37:13] oh it's an alias [17:37:13]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:37:36] history is an alias for fc -l 1 [17:37:36]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:37:47] that's ... interesting [17:37:47]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[17:38:27] bash compatibility ? [17:38:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	 *	mortal1 [17:39:22] shrugs [17:39:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:39:41] i should note that this is on os x, oh my zsh stuff [17:39:41]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:39:54] i just added an alias to my .zshrc to fix it [17:39:54]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[17:40:16] !omz [17:40:16]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	machabot	[17:40:17] "omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the channel #oh-my-zsh. [17:40:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	mortal1	[17:41:00] :^) I figured that'd be the response [17:41:00]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[17:43:01] It's a recurring pattern, odd problems turn out to be omz defaults. [17:43:01]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[17:43:20] that* [17:43:20]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:39:14] so I display the last exit code in my prompt [18:39:14]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:39:28] and when I start up a new shell, the exit code is reported as 1, so something in my startup is boned [18:39:28]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:39:31] how do I figure out what it is? [18:39:31]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	thrig	[18:39:49] what's the last line in your rc files? [18:39:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:40:02] one sec [18:40:02]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:40:21] it's "alias e='$EDITOR $HOME/.zshrc'" lol [18:40:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	osse	[18:41:18] pikajude: run 'set -x'. what's the last few lines reported ? [18:41:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:42:05] https://gist.github.com/pikajude/9651e46761df223c0f376805e2f358b5 [18:42:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:42:15] abbrev_path is a function I wrote to abbreviate $PWD before i show it in my prompt [18:42:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:42:35] oh snap! i totally found it [18:42:35]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:42:48] it was the line BEFORE that block. sneaky rvm installed a .zlogin file that I didn't want [18:42:48]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	pikajude	[18:42:55] thanks anyway everyone [18:42:55]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	ZeroKnight	[01:17:49] FWIW the history alias from this morning is indeed an omz default [01:17:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	danielsh	[01:42:54] bapt, I just pushed the patch you'd added to the port yesterday, it'll be in 5.3 [01:42:54]

2016-10-18 00:14:27	machabot	[17:40:17] "omz" is shorthand for "oh-my-zsh", an extension which the consensus of this channel recommends against using.  If you see odd behaviour using omz, please try disabling omz and see if the issue remains. For assistance with oh-my-zsh, try the channel #oh-my-zsh. [17:40:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:27	mortal1	[17:41:00] :^) I figured that'd be the response [17:41:00]

2016-10-18 06:38:58	Bengi_	Hello, I have a custom color for my prompt hostname if I SSH into a machine (hostname turns red). But if I'm in the machine and then do "sudo su" to be root, the hostname goes back to normal color as if I wasn't in SSH anymore. Is their a special hook in zsh for that?
2016-10-18 06:40:02	phy1729	You could set root's dotfiles to mirror yours or export PS1, but using sudo more is likely a better solution.
2016-10-18 06:40:54	thrig	arguments with other admins over how the prompt should be blinged in 3, 2
2016-10-18 06:41:52	phy1729	Reply from Bengi_ that this is for his local box in 3, 2
2016-10-18 06:42:03	Bengi_	^
2016-10-18 06:42:09	danielsh	considering that you're switching to root you can have root's shell check if $SSH_* is present in the environment of $PPID
2016-10-18 06:42:35	Bengi_	I didnt know there was a convention for what a server prompt should be?
2016-10-18 06:42:36	thrig	unless sudo stripped that stuff
2016-10-18 06:42:39	danielsh	Or you can assign a fixed color per host
2016-10-18 06:42:46	danielsh	thrig, ps -e -p $PPID
2016-10-18 06:43:28	thrig	conventions are site-specific (I disable colors)
