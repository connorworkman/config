2016-09-09 07:12:55	alem0lars	danielsh: is it safe to unfunction the functions? They will be used internally when other functions will be called
2016-09-09 07:13:31	alem0lars	For example, I'd like to ignore every function starting with 'foo_'
2016-09-09 07:13:40	danielsh	then see the other thing I said :)
2016-09-09 07:14:07	alem0lars	should I do: "zstyle ':completion:*:functions' ignored-patterns 'foo_*'"?
2016-09-09 07:14:16	alem0lars	What about the second argument?
2016-09-09 07:14:33	alem0lars	I guess the first one is the substring that should match for ignoring a function
2016-09-09 07:14:38	danielsh	it says to ignore those functions wherever functino names are being completed.
2016-09-09 07:15:34	danielsh	( I use this http://sprunge.us/ZDSj )
2016-09-09 07:15:58	danielsh	alem0lars, man zshcompsys, search for ":function:" (without the quotes)

2016-09-09 11:50:24	alem0lars	I'd like to define custom completion for one function I've defined. It already works as espected (using _describe), however the list is just built initially, instead the elements of that list are dynamic and it should be rebuilt every time the user tries to complete.. Is it possible to regenerate the completion list every time the user triggers completion?

I am lost with regards to keybindings.  been trying to define some, like Home key -> beginning of line, and it works at times, not at others, etc. Question: does it make a difference where "bindkey -e" is in .zshrc i.e. whether it is ABOVE my custom binding or below?

2016-09-10 09:11:46	Mikachu	yes/no but you can put (:a) and then press tab before accepting
2016-09-10 09:12:48	msafi	Mikachu: could you elaborate?
2016-09-10 09:12:58	Mikachu	cd foo(:a) press tab
2016-09-10 09:13:14	Mikachu	that's assuming you have _expand in your completer-list perhaps, so you could use ^X* instead
2016-09-10 09:14:10	msafi	Mikachu: it seems to work, so now can I make it so that when I do "cd .." and press enter, it will automatically add "(:a)" at the end for me?
2016-09-10 09:14:25	Mikachu	that would take slightly more effort
2016-09-10 09:14:56	Mikachu	and eg, would be harder to make work for more complex commands that contain a cd
2016-09-10 09:15:08	Mikachu	but if you only want it for when cd is the only command, it's not too difficult
2016-09-10 09:15:21	Mikachu	but
2016-09-10 09:15:23	msafi	Mikachu: yes, only when cd is the only command

2016-09-10 09:17:36	msafi	Mikachu: is that different from bash script?
2016-09-10 09:17:47	Mikachu	yeah
2016-09-10 09:18:15	msafi	oh man...did they have to invent their own language?
2016-09-10 09:18:26	Mikachu	it's the same base, just different extensions
2016-09-10 09:18:35	Mikachu	bash invented their own language, from our point of view too :)
2016-09-10 09:20:44	msafi	Mikachu: what do you recommend for someone wanting to learn shell programming?
2016-09-10 09:20:44		[09:20]
2016-09-10 09:22:56	Mikachu	poking at it until you figure it out, read the manpage, don't trust blog posts and cargo culted code too much
2016-09-10 09:23:31	msafi	sounds like it would take more dedication than I have right now...any more structured approach to it?
2016-09-10 09:23:56	Mikachu	there's a book called 'from bash to z shell' that people apparently like, but i've never read it

2016-09-11 01:25:18	MoziM	i'm using archlinux and it appears that there is no ~/.zprofile or ~/.zenv file
2016-09-11 01:25:38	osse	there usually isn't by default. create them if you need them
2016-09-11 01:26:08	MoziM	in my /etc/zsh folder there is only keephack zprofile and zshrc... where exactly is the config for zsh that specifies what files to look for aliases in?
2016-09-11 01:26:11	MoziM	oh i see
2016-09-11 01:27:51	osse	there isn't a specific file for aliases. only the zshrc

2016-09-11 01:28:15	MoziM	i c...
2016-09-11 01:28:34	MoziM	my main gripe is that i don't know how to make multiple files that contain aliases zsh can look for

2016-09-11 07:35:32	Mikachu	the completion for a command is arbitrary shell code
2016-09-11 07:35:44	Mikachu	although most will just be a single word with a leading underscore
2016-09-11 07:35:54	Mikachu	which is the completer function distributed with zsh
2016-09-11 07:36:05	Mikachu	the first matching file from $fpath gets loaded the first time you call it

2016-09-11 12:23:41	Mikachu	do you want to not be able to run fg?
2016-09-11 12:23:41	llua	yes
2016-09-11 12:24:01	Celmor	bascally I want to disable invoking of `fg` when I press ctrl-z
2016-09-11 12:24:11	Mikachu	nobody runs fg when you press ctrl-z
2016-09-11 12:24:26	Mikachu	if you don't want to run it, then just don't run it?
2016-09-11 12:26:05	llua	parsed that wrong, thought he didn't want the message printing when foregrounding a job
2016-09-11 12:26:05		[12:26]
2016-09-11 12:27:00	Celmor	My shell just brought a task forward when I pressed ctrl-z, I didn't execute `fg` explicitly, I only pressed ctrl-z  by mistake

2016-09-11 12:27:28	Celmor	but it says fg now in the prompt
2016-09-11 12:27:52	llua	i was kinda close.
2016-09-11 12:28:50	llua	what is the output of jobs when you see fg in your prompt?
2016-09-11 12:29:40	ft	grml's zshrc has a binding that calls fg if ctrl-z is pressed at a normal prompt.
2016-09-11 12:30:11	Mikachu	that's not builtin zsh behavior then
2016-09-11 12:30:15	Celmor	[1]   +  $pid running $command
2016-09-11 12:30:48	ft	No, that wouldn't be zsh's default doing at all.
2016-09-11 12:31:23	ft	It does support hist_ignore_space and checks if there are jobs at all, before trying fg.
2016-09-11 12:31:28	ft	So, it could be worse. :)
2016-09-11 12:31:39	ft	Celmor: Do you use grml's zshrc?
2016-09-11 12:31:43	Celmor	yes
2016-09-11 12:31:49	ft	That's that then.
2016-09-11 12:32:07	Celmor	what do I need to change to disable this behaviour?
2016-09-11 12:32:30	ft	Unbind ^z
2016-09-11 12:32:34	Celmor	other than uninstalling grml's zshrc
2016-09-11 12:33:59	Celmor	what's the location of the zshrc that's installed through that package?
2016-09-11 12:33:59	ft	for i in viins emacs; do bindkey -M $i -r '^z'; done
2016-09-11 12:34:26	ft	That probably depends what source you installed the setup from.
2016-09-11 12:37:22	ft	Celmor: grml's setup sources ~/.zshrc.local after it's done. Put the loop I gave in there and you should be good.
2016-09-11 12:37:34	ft	Unless I made a mistake in the loop. I didn't test.
2016-09-11 12:43:00		[12:37]
2016-09-11 12:46:21	Celmor	or I just comment out `function grml-zsh-fg`?
2016-09-11 12:46:33	Celmor	also, there's no ~/.zshrc.local

2016-09-11 12:47:18	ft	It only sources it if it exists.
2016-09-11 12:47:34	ft	It is meant for people to make their customisations.
2016-09-11 12:48:02	ft	Because like that, you can always upgrade the setup without having to redo all your customisations all over again.
2016-09-11 12:48:35	Celmor	~/.zshrc is the same as what you call ~/.zshrc.local, I presume?
2016-09-11 12:48:47	ft	No.
2016-09-11 12:48:56	ft	~/.zshrc is read by zsh
2016-09-11 12:49:19	ft	~/.zshrc.local is a file special to grml's setup. It reads it at its end.
2016-09-11 12:49:21	Celmor	isn't the ,$SHELLrc for customiations by the user?
2016-09-11 12:49:29	Celmor	ah
2016-09-11 12:50:40	ft	You can remove the binding from the actual setup (it's done using a function called bind2maps). But be prepared to do it again, when you update grml's setup the next time.

2016-09-11 12:51:15	Celmor	what `emacs` doing in your loop? I'm not using emacs
2016-09-11 12:51:20	ft	To not have to do that, is precisely why .zshrc.local was introduced with that particilar configuration.
2016-09-11 12:51:47	ft	It has nothing at all to do with emacs, the program.
2016-09-11 12:52:19	Celmor	ah
2016-09-11 12:52:26	ft	Zsh's line editor has two principle modes, both of which are modeled after two popular editors.
2016-09-11 12:52:46	ft	And the key binding tables are named after them.
2016-09-11 12:53:00	ft	man zshzle for all that.
2016-09-11 12:55:01	Celmor	thanks for the tips

2016-09-11 19:17:20	d-rock	Well, you could think of an alias as being shorthand for doing something outside of an alias
2016-09-11 19:18:10	d-rock	As far as I know you can only do things with an alias that you would do without an alias, function definition definitely being one of those
2016-09-11 19:19:23	d-rock	I mean, suffix aliases are a slightly different beast, but they still work within the bounds of things you can do without an alias
2016-09-11 19:19:35	MoziM	hmmm
2016-09-11 19:19:41	MoziM	ok thanks i'll keep that in mind
2016-09-11 19:19:50	d-rock	Actually, your alias above is interesting in that you're defining an alias with the same name as the function that the alias defines
2016-09-11 19:20:13	d-rock	I'm not sure if aliases and functions are in the same namespace or if the function def clobbers the alias

2016-09-11 19:21:53	MoziM	the function on line 13, if i did "take foobar" it would create a directory named foobar and cd into it?
2016-09-11 19:22:18	MoziM	am i correct to say a function can do everything an alias can do but the reverse is false?
2016-09-11 19:22:19	d-rock	Yes, but that's a function, not an alias
2016-09-11 19:22:38	MoziM	ok so for me to call it in a terminal a function must be in an alias?
2016-09-11 19:22:45	d-rock	Definitely not
2016-09-11 19:22:56	d-rock	None of the functions in that file are in aliases, are they?
2016-09-11 19:23:11	MoziM	i don't see any
2016-09-11 19:23:11		[19:23]
2016-09-11 19:23:22	larryv	you can call a function like you'd call any command
2016-09-11 19:23:24	d-rock	When you say 'take foo' you're just executing the function 'take' with the arg 'foo'
2016-09-11 19:23:26	d-rock	Right
2016-09-11 19:23:45	d-rock	functions and aliases are orthogonal

2016-09-11 19:23:52	larryv	man zshbuiltins
2016-09-11 19:24:10	MoziM	d-rock can you give an example of what you said earlier? "Well, you could think of an alias as being shorthand for doing something outside of an alias"
2016-09-11 19:24:34	d-rock	Think of it as a substitution
2016-09-11 19:25:13	d-rock	This may not be technically correct, I'm not a zsh expert, but generally you can think of an alias as being something that gets replaced
2016-09-11 19:26:11	d-rock	So if I say `alias foo='bar baz'` and then later say `foo bat` it's basically substituting in 'bar baz' where 'foo' was and I get 'bar baz bat'

2016-09-12 00:49:21	psprint	yeah checked, Ctrl-V Enter prints ^M
2016-09-12 00:49:31	ascii-soup	Yeah
2016-09-12 00:49:45	ascii-soup	Ctrl+F is probably bound to find in a bunch of terminal emulators
2016-09-12 00:50:04	ascii-soup	Though I have absolutely no data with which to back that assertion up
2016-09-12 00:50:20	ascii-soup	Ctrl+Shift+F in Konsole
2016-09-12 00:50:23	ascii-soup	There's one data point at least ;)
2016-09-12 00:51:15	ascii-soup	There's ergonomics to think about too, I suppose
2016-09-12 00:51:29	ascii-soup	don't want the key to be tooo far away from Ctrl
2016-09-12 00:51:35	psprint	what about ^G? It's "bell" ASCII control code, seems not to imply any use case
2016-09-12 00:51:42	ascii-soup	(mind you, ctrl could be either left/right/capslock)

2016-09-12 00:54:38	ascii-soup	Ctrl+; seems to just insert a semicolon
2016-09-12 00:54:48	ascii-soup	Might not be very friendly to some international kb layouts though
2016-09-12 00:55:07	ascii-soup	Or maybe it does that because Ctrl+; is not something that can be detected

2016-09-12 01:33:11	danielsh	so if I define a helper function and want to edit it, ^O would make it much easier to recall it line by line.

2016-09-12 17:35:46	Mikachu	i'm fairly sure that if globcomplete is not enabled, then any glob characters in completion will be treated only as file globbing

2016-09-12 17:43:51	Celmor	How do I get the behaviour of POSIX shell for Ctrl-u? Can I simply override the default behaviour by binding ^u to a different function (whatever corresponds to 'yank before cursor' and not 'yank whole line')?
2016-09-12 17:43:51		[17:43]
2016-09-12 17:44:33	Mikachu	i don't think posix specifies any interactive features for sh
2016-09-12 17:44:34	danielsh	f() { LBUFFER= }; zle -N f; bindkey \^U f
2016-09-12 17:45:28	llua	it does
2016-09-12 17:45:49	danielsh	Mikachu, the ** issue occurs with globcomplete set.
2016-09-12 17:46:37	Mikachu	it's likely that the globcomplete code doesn't treat **/ as a special token, but just as two consecutive asterisks...
2016-09-12 17:46:58	Mikachu	i'll leave it to someone who knows more to reply to your mail :)
2016-09-12 17:47:07	Mikachu	just wanted to check you tried those first
2016-09-12 17:47:13	danielsh	... but I can reproduce the issue without globcomplete too ...
2016-09-12 17:47:19	llua	but ctrl-u isn't one of said features
2016-09-12 17:47:27	danielsh	and yes, I agree with you, I think the issue is that _match doesn't interpret ** as recursion
2016-09-12 17:47:43	Mikachu	did you have _expand in your completers?
2016-09-12 17:47:48	danielsh	yes
2016-09-12 17:48:05	danielsh	IIRC putting _expand before _match breaks the ntp* case (#2)
2016-09-12 17:48:28	danielsh	and putting _expand first breaks the ** case
2016-09-12 17:53:40	Mikachu	i use zstyle ':completion:*' completer _oldlist _expand _complete _correct
2016-09-12 17:53:50	Mikachu	and ^I is bound to complete-word, not expand-or-complete
2016-09-12 17:53:57	Mikachu	but i didn't try your test cases because i'm lazy

2016-09-13 13:06:09	ihavenoclue	Hello, after a cleanup of the bloated oh-my-zsh I've found "skip_global_compinit=1" in my .zshenv but can't find what it does exactly?
2016-09-13 13:06:47	ft	I think ubuntu's global zshrc uses that.
2016-09-13 13:07:27	ft	If set the file doesn't call compinit, which may make sense, since most people call it themselves.
2016-09-13 13:07:28	phy1729	not in man zshall
2016-09-13 13:07:47	ft	Like I said, it's a ubuntu specific thing.
2016-09-13 13:08:35	phy1729	(more of a hint how to check for any future weird vars)
2016-09-13 13:08:38	ihavenoclue	ft: what do you mean by people calling it themselves?

2016-09-13 13:09:55	ft	ihavenoclue: Most people call compinit from their own configuration files. Calling it is fairly expensive. Thus calling it twice, once from a vendor's global setup and from a user's private setup is not the smartest thing to do.

2016-09-13 13:26:17	larryv	like, the init files should check enable_global_compinit
2016-09-13 13:26:18	larryv	or something
2016-09-13 13:26:25	larryv	or just not offer completion at all
2016-09-13 13:26:51	ihavenoclue	oh, you mean that i shouldn't have to put that in my zshenv and let the vendor not load them by default?
2016-09-13 13:27:00	ft	Yeah, what would be the upside of setting a variable to have compinit called instead of just calling it yourself.
2016-09-13 13:27:13	ihavenoclue	yep
2016-09-13 13:27:58	ft	ihavenoclue: larryv is disagreeing with ubuntu's choice of default behaviour, not with you setting that variable.
2016-09-13 13:29:40	larryv	pretty much
2016-09-13 13:29:53	larryv	but given that that's how it's set up, roll with it
2016-09-13 13:30:49	phy1729	(or move distros :P)
2016-09-13 13:31:03	ihavenoclue	well I'm on Debian, not Ubuntu
2016-09-13 13:31:25	larryv	well problem solved lol
2016-09-13 13:32:45	ft	Yes, Debian's zshrc does not call compinit.

2016-09-13 23:19:33	danielsh	'set -f' probably does something different
2016-09-13 23:20:45	danielsh	also you may be running into sh_word_split.  try changing $b t ${=b}

2016-09-13 23:23:55	danielsh	in this particular case ${(f)foo} is another alternative.

2016-09-13 23:28:38	earational	thanks though
2016-09-13 23:30:55	ascii-soup	well then in that case, hello! :)
2016-09-13 23:35:02	ascii-soup	what's your favourite thing about zsh? :D
2016-09-13 23:35:24	ascii-soup	(that goes for everyone, I guess - can you tell I'm having a slow day?)
2016-09-13 23:40:00	earational	the autocompletion is probably my favourite feature
2016-09-13 23:40:24	earational	i recently found out search history but i tend to forget to use it in my daily workflow
2016-09-13 23:40:53	ascii-soup	check out https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search
2016-09-13 23:41:17	ascii-soup	You can bind the 'previous' and 'next' to up/down keys and then when you have typed something, you can press up to search for what you've currently typed in your history
2016-09-13 23:41:19	ascii-soup	I find it really useful
2016-09-13 23:41:27	ascii-soup	(and easier to remember to use in my day-to-day)
2016-09-13 23:43:12	earational	this is very interesting, thank you for sharing!
2016-09-13 23:43:23	ascii-soup	:)
2016-09-13 23:43:23		[23:43]
2016-09-13 23:44:06	ascii-soup	and if you don't already use it, it's worth checking out https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting too - it can 'syntax' highlight the stuff you type; useful for immediate feedback on things like 'does this command exist' or 'does this path exist' amongst other things
2016-09-13 23:44:30	ascii-soup	i.e. a command that does exist would be coloured green, one that doesn't would remain red, and so on

2016-09-14 03:18:04	ascii-soup	danielsh: Ah never mind, just saying that I'm sure we were talking about having filetype-based highlighting a while ago
2016-09-14 03:18:11	japh	danielsh, hey, aah :) My hack above is some 5 years after, methinks
2016-09-14 03:18:45	ascii-soup	I just had some deja vu and wondered if I was actually having deja vu or just need more sleep ;)
2016-09-14 03:18:48	danielsh	ascii-soup, We might have.  Don't recall.
2016-09-14 03:18:56	ascii-soup	Probably just me then!
2016-09-14 03:18:56	japh	"but, wfm"
2016-09-14 03:18:58	danielsh	japh, you are trapd00r ?
2016-09-14 03:19:01	japh	yep
2016-09-14 03:19:06	danielsh	nice to meet you :)
2016-09-14 03:19:09	japh	dito :)
2016-09-14 03:19:31	danielsh	... so what's the question ?
2016-09-14 03:19:39	japh	we figured it out in pm :)
2016-09-14 03:19:49	ascii-soup	so, japh, after our chat (thanks!) I reckon I can port it
2016-09-14 03:19:49	danielsh	ok, cool :)
2016-09-14 03:19:54	ascii-soup	when is obviously a different question
2016-09-14 03:19:56	ascii-soup	but hey
2016-09-14 03:20:00	ascii-soup	expect a PR at some point :-)
2016-09-14 03:20:02	danielsh	japh, for future reference there's a #zsh-syntax-highlighting, you're welcome to join
2016-09-14 03:20:14	japh	ascii-soup, cool :)
2016-09-14 03:20:18	japh	danielsh, oh, cool
2016-09-14 03:22:23	danielsh	Just to restate what I think ascii-soup was trying to explain: a z-sy-h plugin needs to define only two functions, one that computes $region_highlight and another that says whether the first one should be called.

2016-09-14 20:46:55	squiddy	I am facing this weird behavior, the solution to which I couldn't find online - I use zsh on iTerm2 (on El Capitan) and vim with the TabBar plugin. Sometimes when I quit vim, this happens http://pastebin.com/5nLipWSW. The key sequence of vim seems to appear on the terminal. If i try to scroll up or press enter, escape or delete, i see these sequences. What should I do to debug/fix this issue?

2016-09-15 03:47:32	psprint	How to implement array of arrays? I only need limited # of arrays, say 4, so I should declare local -a array1 .. array4 and then refer to them by (P) flag via concatenated "array" and $index ?
2016-09-15 03:49:40	danielsh	it really depends on the access pattern.

2016-09-15 03:50:02	danielsh	if you're going to access the elements "by row" then a single array=(a1 a2 a3 a4 b1 b2 b3 b4) would make sense.
2016-09-15 03:50:13	danielsh	if you access "by column" then four arrays make sense.

2016-09-15 03:55:32	psprint	hmm, instead of limiting the # of arrays and having painful time with (P), I could limit # of elements in each array, and put them into single array with padding with empty array elements, and then to get array, do [a,b]... This seems to be a wonderful solution good that I've asked, although I don't follow the row vs column access
2016-09-15 03:56:26	psprint	instead of array of arrays this will be 2-dimensional array
2016-09-15 03:56:53	psprint	with limited dimension, although I could set the limit at runtime
2016-09-15 03:57:07	danielsh	My point was what access pattern you'd use
2016-09-15 03:57:28	danielsh	"row" and "column" is if you imagine the array as an MxN matrix

2016-09-15 12:20:45	llua	you can use the hook functions to provide something like that
2016-09-15 12:21:11	Osleg	I realize that I can make a function that will check for .lzshrc in each directory and if there is then source it else source global zshrc but that would load global zshrc on every cd if there is no local

2016-09-15 12:21:37	Osleg	which means it will slow down each cd alot... so is there a better way? :)
2016-09-15 12:21:39	Mikachu	the only way to 100% undo things when you leave is if you started a subshell and then exit that when you leave
2016-09-15 12:22:01	Mikachu	also loading the global zshrc absolutely does not guarantee undoing local changes
2016-09-15 12:22:06	Mikachu	except for a very limited set of things
2016-09-15 12:22:23	llua	and could also break things more depending on how it's setup

2016-09-15 12:24:02	Osleg	and then just leave on cd out
2016-09-15 12:24:10	Osleg	thanks for idea! :)

2016-10-02 03:18:44	karelk	how can I make ctrl+w behave same as in bash ?

2016-10-02 03:19:32	karelk	it stops at the "/"
2016-10-02 03:19:36	danielsh	the default is what you want
2016-10-02 03:19:53	danielsh	probably something changes $WORDCHARS in your setup.
2016-10-02 03:19:58	danielsh	try:   WORDCHARS+=/
2016-10-02 03:20:01	danielsh	in .zshrc
2016-10-02 03:20:51	karelk	but will this affect how alt+BACKSPACE behaves ?
2016-10-02 03:21:04	karelk	alt+BACKSPACE stops at /, and that is desired
2016-10-02 03:21:37	danielsh	you can make them behave differently if your terminal sends distinct keycodes for them.

2016-10-02 03:24:35	danielsh	the easiest way would be bindkey to a custom function that sets WORDCHARS locally and invoked the default widget then.
2016-10-02 03:24:49	danielsh	there's the select-word-style widget for more elaborate options.

2016-10-02 03:34:20	danielsh	So you need to bindkey one of them to a different widget, and arrange for that widget not to behave in the bash way.
2016-10-02 03:34:36	danielsh	look up the manual for s-w-style, it documents some zstyles you can set to control behaviour per widget.

2016-10-02 23:41:43	psprint	japh: development aid plugin, main idea is "current project", which after set, has it's own document at alternate screen, invoked via Ctrl-O Ctrl-U. The alternate screen contains last commits, modified files, last #N projects, searchable file tree. Also, today I'll add ack/ag support, so that the project can be searched from the alternate screen. Also special version of ctags is bundled, produces output parsable
2016-10-02 23:41:46	psprint	via Zsh, with Ctrl-R-like interface at Ctrl-O Ctrl-K, so: one can open a symbol directly from shell
2016-10-02 23:42:39	japh	psprint, interesting
2016-10-02 23:43:26	japh	I thought you had implemented an c64 emulator in zsh
