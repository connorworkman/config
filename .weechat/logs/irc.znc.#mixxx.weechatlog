2016-09-18 05:03:34	magnicida	hi!
2016-09-18 05:03:34		[05:03]
2016-09-18 05:04:03	magnicida	I am finally (too late) upgrading the Mixco scripts to 2.0 and I am having some trouble with the M-Audio Xponent
2016-09-18 05:05:04	magnicida	I am having trouble mapping some buttons directly bypassing the script
2016-09-18 05:05:12	magnicida	for these buttons I am using the <button> option
2016-09-18 05:05:30	magnicida	e.g. for the Cue button, which should be on while pressed, then off
2016-09-18 05:06:23	magnicida	the problem is that the Xponent does not a value 0 on release, instead it sends a Note On/Off on press/release, always with a non-zero third byte
2016-09-18 05:06:35	magnicida	this seemed to be working before, though
2016-09-18 05:08:09	magnicida	I would like to fix this "the right way" instead of just working around it in JavaScript, since the later fix adds latency, which I'd like to avoid for the Cue button
2016-09-18 05:08:30	magnicida	so, my question is, what do you think is better of the following two options:
2016-09-18 05:09:02	magnicida	1. make the <button> option consider note-off as equivalent to a 0 end
2016-09-18 05:09:21	magnicida	2. add a different option e.g. <note-button> for this behavior
2016-09-18 05:09:55	magnicida	I feel that the former option was working in previous versions of Mixxx, where I developed the script, but now I am having doubts

2016-09-18 06:54:03	fqtw	had my first dj gig yesterday using mixxx, in the beginning i put my midi controller on the other side of my laptop than usual so the usb cable was too short so i plugged it into the other usb plug but suddenly all my midi mappings in mixxx that i had made for this midi controller were gone!!!
2016-09-18 06:54:23	fqtw	just because it was in a diff usb plug

2016-09-18 09:13:51	riggz	[01:27:56] hi i need some help. I have a numark party mix controller but i cant get it to scratch in mixxx [01:27:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	riggz	[01:29:06] I tried to script my own code earlier but it didnt work so idk [01:29:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	riggz	[01:36:19] how do i use the numark party mix controller for scratching in mixxx [01:36:19]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:03:34] hi! [15:03:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:04:03] I am finally (too late) upgrading the Mixco scripts to 2.0 and I am having some trouble with the M-Audio Xponent [15:04:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:05:04] I am having trouble mapping some buttons directly bypassing the script [15:05:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:05:12] for these buttons I am using the <button> option [15:05:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:05:30] e.g. for the Cue button, which should be on while pressed, then off [15:05:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:06:23] the problem is that the Xponent does not a value 0 on release, instead it sends a Note On/Off on press/release, always with a non-zero third byte [15:06:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:06:35] this seemed to be working before, though [15:06:35]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:08:09] I would like to fix this "the right way" instead of just working around it in JavaScript, since the later fix adds latency, which I'd like to avoid for the Cue button [15:08:09]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:08:30] so, my question is, what do you think is better of the following two options: [15:08:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:09:02] 1. make the <button> option consider note-off as equivalent to a 0 end [15:09:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:09:21] 2. add a different option e.g. <note-button> for this behavior [15:09:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:09:55] I feel that the former option was working in previous versions of Mixxx, where I developed the script, but now I am having doubts [15:09:55]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	fqtw	[16:54:03] had my first dj gig yesterday using mixxx, in the beginning i put my midi controller on the other side of my laptop than usual so the usb cable was too short so i plugged it into the other usb plug but suddenly all my midi mappings in mixxx that i had made for this midi controller were gone!!! [16:54:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	fqtw	[16:54:23] just because it was in a diff usb plug [16:54:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	fqtw	[16:54:25] why? [16:54:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	steve-_-1	[18:05:39] can't tell but I get this with all kinds of usb audio interfaces. when changing the usual port things get interesting [18:05:39]
