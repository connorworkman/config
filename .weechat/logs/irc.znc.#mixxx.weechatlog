2016-09-18 05:03:34	magnicida	hi!
2016-09-18 05:03:34		[05:03]
2016-09-18 05:04:03	magnicida	I am finally (too late) upgrading the Mixco scripts to 2.0 and I am having some trouble with the M-Audio Xponent
2016-09-18 05:05:04	magnicida	I am having trouble mapping some buttons directly bypassing the script
2016-09-18 05:05:12	magnicida	for these buttons I am using the <button> option
2016-09-18 05:05:30	magnicida	e.g. for the Cue button, which should be on while pressed, then off
2016-09-18 05:06:23	magnicida	the problem is that the Xponent does not a value 0 on release, instead it sends a Note On/Off on press/release, always with a non-zero third byte
2016-09-18 05:06:35	magnicida	this seemed to be working before, though
2016-09-18 05:08:09	magnicida	I would like to fix this "the right way" instead of just working around it in JavaScript, since the later fix adds latency, which I'd like to avoid for the Cue button
2016-09-18 05:08:30	magnicida	so, my question is, what do you think is better of the following two options:
2016-09-18 05:09:02	magnicida	1. make the <button> option consider note-off as equivalent to a 0 end
2016-09-18 05:09:21	magnicida	2. add a different option e.g. <note-button> for this behavior
2016-09-18 05:09:55	magnicida	I feel that the former option was working in previous versions of Mixxx, where I developed the script, but now I am having doubts

2016-09-18 06:54:03	fqtw	had my first dj gig yesterday using mixxx, in the beginning i put my midi controller on the other side of my laptop than usual so the usb cable was too short so i plugged it into the other usb plug but suddenly all my midi mappings in mixxx that i had made for this midi controller were gone!!!
2016-09-18 06:54:23	fqtw	just because it was in a diff usb plug

2016-09-18 09:13:51	riggz	[01:27:56] hi i need some help. I have a numark party mix controller but i cant get it to scratch in mixxx [01:27:56]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	riggz	[01:29:06] I tried to script my own code earlier but it didnt work so idk [01:29:06]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	riggz	[01:36:19] how do i use the numark party mix controller for scratching in mixxx [01:36:19]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:03:34] hi! [15:03:34]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:04:03] I am finally (too late) upgrading the Mixco scripts to 2.0 and I am having some trouble with the M-Audio Xponent [15:04:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:05:04] I am having trouble mapping some buttons directly bypassing the script [15:05:04]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:05:12] for these buttons I am using the <button> option [15:05:12]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:05:30] e.g. for the Cue button, which should be on while pressed, then off [15:05:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:06:23] the problem is that the Xponent does not a value 0 on release, instead it sends a Note On/Off on press/release, always with a non-zero third byte [15:06:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:06:35] this seemed to be working before, though [15:06:35]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:08:09] I would like to fix this "the right way" instead of just working around it in JavaScript, since the later fix adds latency, which I'd like to avoid for the Cue button [15:08:09]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:08:30] so, my question is, what do you think is better of the following two options: [15:08:30]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:09:02] 1. make the <button> option consider note-off as equivalent to a 0 end [15:09:02]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:09:21] 2. add a different option e.g. <note-button> for this behavior [15:09:21]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	magnicida	[15:09:55] I feel that the former option was working in previous versions of Mixxx, where I developed the script, but now I am having doubts [15:09:55]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	fqtw	[16:54:03] had my first dj gig yesterday using mixxx, in the beginning i put my midi controller on the other side of my laptop than usual so the usb cable was too short so i plugged it into the other usb plug but suddenly all my midi mappings in mixxx that i had made for this midi controller were gone!!! [16:54:03]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	fqtw	[16:54:23] just because it was in a diff usb plug [16:54:23]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	fqtw	[16:54:25] why? [16:54:25]
2016-09-18 09:13:51	steve-_-1	[18:05:39] can't tell but I get this with all kinds of usb audio interfaces. when changing the usual port things get interesting [18:05:39]

2016-09-19 02:44:01	riggz	[01:29:06] I tried to script my own code earlier but it didnt work so idk [01:29:06]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	riggz	[01:36:19] how do i use the numark party mix controller for scratching in mixxx [01:36:19]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	magnicida	[15:03:34] hi! [15:03:34]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	magnicida	[15:04:03] I am finally (too late) upgrading the Mixco scripts to 2.0 and I am having some trouble with the M-Audio Xponent [15:04:03]
2016-09-19 02:44:01	magnicida	[15:05:04] I am having trouble mapping some buttons directly bypassing the script [15:05:04]
2016-09-19 02:44:02	magnicida	[15:05:12] for these buttons I am using the <button> option [15:05:12]
2016-09-19 02:44:02	magnicida	[15:05:30] e.g. for the Cue button, which should be on while pressed, then off [15:05:30]
2016-09-19 02:44:02	magnicida	[15:06:23] the problem is that the Xponent does not a value 0 on release, instead it sends a Note On/Off on press/release, always with a non-zero third byte [15:06:23]
2016-09-19 02:44:02	magnicida	[15:06:35] this seemed to be working before, though [15:06:35]
2016-09-19 02:44:02	magnicida	[15:08:09] I would like to fix this "the right way" instead of just working around it in JavaScript, since the later fix adds latency, which I'd like to avoid for the Cue button [15:08:09]
2016-09-19 02:44:02	magnicida	[15:08:30] so, my question is, what do you think is better of the following two options: [15:08:30]
2016-09-19 02:44:02	magnicida	[15:09:02] 1. make the <button> option consider note-off as equivalent to a 0 end [15:09:02]
2016-09-19 02:44:02	magnicida	[15:09:21] 2. add a different option e.g. <note-button> for this behavior [15:09:21]
2016-09-19 02:44:02	magnicida	[15:09:55] I feel that the former option was working in previous versions of Mixxx, where I developed the script, but now I am having doubts [15:09:55]
2016-09-19 02:44:02	fqtw	[16:54:03] had my first dj gig yesterday using mixxx, in the beginning i put my midi controller on the other side of my laptop than usual so the usb cable was too short so i plugged it into the other usb plug but suddenly all my midi mappings in mixxx that i had made for this midi controller were gone!!! [16:54:03]
2016-09-19 02:44:02	fqtw	[16:54:23] just because it was in a diff usb plug [16:54:23]
2016-09-19 02:44:02	fqtw	[16:54:25] why? [16:54:25]
2016-09-19 02:44:02	steve-_-1	[18:05:39] can't tell but I get this with all kinds of usb audio interfaces. when changing the usual port things get interesting [18:05:39]

2016-09-19 08:59:12	magnicida	i am trying to bind the new master sync function to a couple of midi scripts
2016-09-19 08:59:33	magnicida	but I'd like to enable it via the gui first to get inspiration for the best workflow
2016-09-19 08:59:40	magnicida	but I can't find it on any of the skins
2016-09-19 08:59:44	magnicida	any ideas?

2016-09-19 09:17:41	magnicida	oh, I see, latching :D
2016-09-19 09:18:05	magnicida	and i can just use sync_enabled for getting that behavior on the controller
2016-09-19 09:18:06	magnicida	easy!!

2016-09-20 00:39:07	magnicida	[15:06:23] the problem is that the Xponent does not a value 0 on release, instead it sends a Note On/Off on press/release, always with a non-zero third byte [15:06:23]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	magnicida	[15:06:35] this seemed to be working before, though [15:06:35]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	magnicida	[15:08:09] I would like to fix this "the right way" instead of just working around it in JavaScript, since the later fix adds latency, which I'd like to avoid for the Cue button [15:08:09]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	magnicida	[15:08:30] so, my question is, what do you think is better of the following two options: [15:08:30]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	magnicida	[15:09:02] 1. make the <button> option consider note-off as equivalent to a 0 end [15:09:02]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	magnicida	[15:09:21] 2. add a different option e.g. <note-button> for this behavior [15:09:21]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	magnicida	[15:09:55] I feel that the former option was working in previous versions of Mixxx, where I developed the script, but now I am having doubts [15:09:55]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	fqtw	[16:54:03] had my first dj gig yesterday using mixxx, in the beginning i put my midi controller on the other side of my laptop than usual so the usb cable was too short so i plugged it into the other usb plug but suddenly all my midi mappings in mixxx that i had made for this midi controller were gone!!! [16:54:03]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	fqtw	[16:54:23] just because it was in a diff usb plug [16:54:23]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	fqtw	[16:54:25] why? [16:54:25]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	steve-_-1	[18:05:39] can't tell but I get this with all kinds of usb audio interfaces. when changing the usual port things get interesting [18:05:39]

2016-09-20 00:39:07	magnicida	[18:58:57] hi yall! [18:58:57]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	magnicida	[18:59:12] i am trying to bind the new master sync function to a couple of midi scripts [18:59:12]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	magnicida	[18:59:33] but I'd like to enable it via the gui first to get inspiration for the best workflow [18:59:33]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	magnicida	[18:59:40] but I can't find it on any of the skins [18:59:40]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	magnicida	[18:59:44] any ideas? [18:59:44]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	magnicida	[19:17:41] oh, I see, latching :D [19:17:41]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	magnicida	[19:18:05] and i can just use sync_enabled for getting that behavior on the controller [19:18:05]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	magnicida	[19:18:06] easy!! [19:18:06]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	Layeph	[19:21:34] I have a quention. How do I record the remix I did on a mac? No recording I made worked... [19:21:34]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	be_	[19:27:10] Layeph: Options > Record Mix [19:27:10]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	Layeph	[19:39:30] I did that... the audio doest seem to work... [19:39:30]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	be_	[19:47:29] what do you mean? Is a file with no audio created? [19:47:29]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	be_	[19:47:57] Also, are you using an external mixer or mixing in Mixxx? [19:47:57]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	be_	[19:48:25] if you're using an external mixer you'll need to get the output of the mixer back into your computer [19:48:25]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	Layeph	[19:52:36] I am using mixxx. when I open the file neither itunes nor google chrome can open it. [19:52:36]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	be_	[20:08:30] what format are you recording in? [20:08:30]
2016-09-20 00:39:07	be_	[20:09:10] you can check in the Recording Preferences [20:09:10]

2016-09-20 18:53:17	magnicida	[15:09:02] 1. make the <button> option consider note-off as equivalent to a 0 end [15:09:02]
2016-09-20 18:53:17	magnicida	[15:09:21] 2. add a different option e.g. <note-button> for this behavior [15:09:21]
2016-09-20 18:53:17	magnicida	[15:09:55] I feel that the former option was working in previous versions of Mixxx, where I developed the script, but now I am having doubts [15:09:55]
2016-09-20 18:53:17	fqtw	[16:54:03] had my first dj gig yesterday using mixxx, in the beginning i put my midi controller on the other side of my laptop than usual so the usb cable was too short so i plugged it into the other usb plug but suddenly all my midi mappings in mixxx that i had made for this midi controller were gone!!! [16:54:03]
2016-09-20 18:53:17	fqtw	[16:54:23] just because it was in a diff usb plug [16:54:23]
2016-09-20 18:53:17	fqtw	[16:54:25] why? [16:54:25]
2016-09-20 18:53:17	steve-_-1	[18:05:39] can't tell but I get this with all kinds of usb audio interfaces. when changing the usual port things get interesting [18:05:39]

2016-09-20 18:53:17	magnicida	[18:58:57] hi yall! [18:58:57]
2016-09-20 18:53:17	magnicida	[18:59:12] i am trying to bind the new master sync function to a couple of midi scripts [18:59:12]
2016-09-20 18:53:17	magnicida	[18:59:33] but I'd like to enable it via the gui first to get inspiration for the best workflow [18:59:33]
2016-09-20 18:53:17	magnicida	[18:59:40] but I can't find it on any of the skins [18:59:40]
2016-09-20 18:53:17	magnicida	[18:59:44] any ideas? [18:59:44]
2016-09-20 18:53:17	magnicida	[19:17:41] oh, I see, latching :D [19:17:41]
2016-09-20 18:53:17	magnicida	[19:18:05] and i can just use sync_enabled for getting that behavior on the controller [19:18:05]
2016-09-20 18:53:17	magnicida	[19:18:06] easy!! [19:18:06]
2016-09-20 18:53:17	Layeph	[19:21:34] I have a quention. How do I record the remix I did on a mac? No recording I made worked... [19:21:34]

2016-09-20 18:53:17	be_	[19:47:29] what do you mean? Is a file with no audio created? [19:47:29]
2016-09-20 18:53:17	be_	[19:47:57] Also, are you using an external mixer or mixing in Mixxx? [19:47:57]
2016-09-20 18:53:17	be_	[19:48:25] if you're using an external mixer you'll need to get the output of the mixer back into your computer [19:48:25]
2016-09-20 18:53:17	Layeph	[19:52:36] I am using mixxx. when I open the file neither itunes nor google chrome can open it. [19:52:36]

2016-09-21 12:41:37	magnicida	[15:09:02] 1. make the <button> option consider note-off as equivalent to a 0 end [15:09:02]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	magnicida	[15:09:21] 2. add a different option e.g. <note-button> for this behavior [15:09:21]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	magnicida	[15:09:55] I feel that the former option was working in previous versions of Mixxx, where I developed the script, but now I am having doubts [15:09:55]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	fqtw	[16:54:03] had my first dj gig yesterday using mixxx, in the beginning i put my midi controller on the other side of my laptop than usual so the usb cable was too short so i plugged it into the other usb plug but suddenly all my midi mappings in mixxx that i had made for this midi controller were gone!!! [16:54:03]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	fqtw	[16:54:23] just because it was in a diff usb plug [16:54:23]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	fqtw	[16:54:25] why? [16:54:25]
2016-09-21 12:41:37	steve-_-1	[18:05:39] can't tell but I get this with all kinds of usb audio interfaces. when changing the usual port things get interesting [18:05:39]

2016-09-21 12:41:37	magnicida	[18:59:33] but I'd like to enable it via the gui first to get inspiration for the best workflow [18:59:33]

2016-09-22 00:23:54	fqtw	[16:54:03] had my first dj gig yesterday using mixxx, in the beginning i put my midi controller on the other side of my laptop than usual so the usb cable was too short so i plugged it into the other usb plug but suddenly all my midi mappings in mixxx that i had made for this midi controller were gone!!! [16:54:03]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	fqtw	[16:54:23] just because it was in a diff usb plug [16:54:23]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	fqtw	[16:54:25] why? [16:54:25]
2016-09-22 00:23:54	steve-_-1	[18:05:39] can't tell but I get this with all kinds of usb audio interfaces. when changing the usual port things get interesting [18:05:39]

2016-09-22 00:23:55	magnicida	[18:58:57] hi yall! [18:58:57]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	magnicida	[18:59:12] i am trying to bind the new master sync function to a couple of midi scripts [18:59:12]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	magnicida	[18:59:33] but I'd like to enable it via the gui first to get inspiration for the best workflow [18:59:33]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	magnicida	[18:59:40] but I can't find it on any of the skins [18:59:40]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	magnicida	[18:59:44] any ideas? [18:59:44]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	magnicida	[19:17:41] oh, I see, latching :D [19:17:41]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	magnicida	[19:18:05] and i can just use sync_enabled for getting that behavior on the controller [19:18:05]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	magnicida	[19:18:06] easy!! [19:18:06]

2016-09-22 00:23:55	be_	[19:47:29] what do you mean? Is a file with no audio created? [19:47:29]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	be_	[19:47:57] Also, are you using an external mixer or mixing in Mixxx? [19:47:57]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	be_	[19:48:25] if you're using an external mixer you'll need to get the output of the mixer back into your computer [19:48:25]
2016-09-22 00:23:55	Layeph	[19:52:36] I am using mixxx. when I open the file neither itunes nor google chrome can open it. [19:52:36]

2016-09-22 01:55:27	JosepMa	@be_ @M-rryan and others: I think i found a strange bug regarding controller scripting and the control "sync_enabled".
2016-09-22 01:55:44	JosepMa	Happens on 2.0 and in latest 2.1 alpha for windows (from july)
2016-09-22 01:57:11	JosepMa	If I press the button and do a setparameter when the song is stopped, the value is changed on both, Mixxx and the reported value from a following getParameter
2016-09-22 01:57:52	JosepMa	If i do the same while the song is playing, the value is changed on Mixxx, but the following getParameter still reports the value 0.
2016-09-22 01:58:16	JosepMa				engine.log("Old State: " + engine.getParameter(group, "sync_enabled"));
2016-09-22 01:58:16	JosepMa				// sync_enabled acts as a switch so we set the opposite of the value that it has.
2016-09-22 01:58:17	JosepMa				engine.setParameter(group, "sync_enabled", !engine.getParameter(group, "sync_enabled"));
2016-09-22 01:58:17	JosepMa				engine.log("New State: " + engine.getParameter(group, "sync_enabled"));
2016-09-22 01:58:29	JosepMa	song stopped:
2016-09-22 01:58:30	JosepMa	Debug [Controller]: "Old State: 1"
2016-09-22 01:58:30	JosepMa	Debug [Controller]: "New State: 0"

2016-09-22 02:06:11	JosepMa	mmm...

2016-09-22 02:06:16	JosepMa	Debug [Controller]: "Going to set: true"

2016-09-22 02:09:50	JosepMa	Debug [Controller]: "New State: 0"
2016-09-22 02:10:01	JosepMa	Definitely, it has to be something internal.
2016-09-22 02:11:05	be_	yikes that's not good
2016-09-22 02:11:17	be_	there's also the bug with soft takeover not working with setParameter
2016-09-22 02:11:22	be_	clearly it needs some work
2016-09-22 02:12:02	be_	this is something we should have an automated test for
2016-09-22 02:12:26	be_	there may be one already, but perhaps something strange is going on with sync_enabled in particular
2016-09-22 02:12:38	be_	can you replicate this with set/getValue?
2016-09-22 02:13:05	JosepMa	Will try it now. I guess it might be a specific thing for sync_enabled, due to its special nature
2016-09-22 02:13:21	<--	bullicon (~bullicon@132.185.153.6) has quit (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
2016-09-22 02:14:48	be_	also please use a pasting service rather than pasting multiple lines into IRC
2016-09-22 02:15:48	JosepMa	Ok, sorry.
2016-09-22 02:15:52	be_	http://pastebin.com/ would work
2016-09-22 02:16:08	JosepMa	as for the test, same result, when the song is playing, the value reported is 0 instead of 1
2016-09-22 02:17:08	be_	hm, so it seems to be an issue with sync_enabled rather than get/setParameter
2016-09-22 02:18:14	JosepMa	yes.
2016-09-22 02:18:14	be_	maybe it's a race condition?
2016-09-22 02:18:21	be_	what if you try to retrieve the value not immediately after setting it?
2016-09-22 02:18:28	JosepMa	mm
2016-09-22 02:19:03	be_	in which case it may be an issue with the scripting engine rather than that CO
2016-09-22 02:19:03		[02:19]
2016-09-22 02:19:09	JosepMa	It might be something around those lines. let me paste one thing
2016-09-22 02:19:42	JosepMa	http://pastebin.com/x5X9YYKG
2016-09-22 02:20:12	JosepMa	That is a log from the opposite state
2016-09-22 02:20:21	JosepMa	i.e. when the sync is enabled, in order to disable it
2016-09-22 02:21:13	JosepMa	First: the value "New state" has not changed (it remains 1 instead of setting to 0), and later on, there is a "value: 0". That is a getValue done from delayed timer
2016-09-22 02:21:40	JosepMa	so yes, it seems that if the song is playing, the sync_enabled is not done in the same thread, or it takes longer to change.
2016-09-22 02:22:31	JosepMa	I will modify the code so as to not depend on the getParameter, since i know which value it should have
2016-09-22 02:23:25	be_	what is the functionality you're trying to implement?
2016-09-22 02:24:02	JosepMa	i am mimmicking the UI functionality, i.e. to activate master sync if i keep it pressed for 400 millis
2016-09-22 02:24:49	JosepMa	bbl.. lunch is ready.

2016-09-22 06:51:57	JosepMa	back then, during 2.0 beta cycle, i forked the branch 1.12 and did the changes there.

2016-09-22 06:55:17	be_	no

2016-09-22 08:06:34	JosepMa	fine, then i think  i am set up. Thanks

2016-09-22 10:37:59	brot_	hi, if id like two have two mixxx instances, what are my chances making one deck of each instance absolutely syncronous two the other (like in playback position, eq, etc)
2016-09-22 10:38:15	brot_	is midi my only option?
2016-09-22 10:42:52	brot_	my goal is to have each deck of those two decks outputting exactly the same signal so i can use a mixer with crossfade to switch from one laptop to the other without any audible change. like this i kind of "passed" the current running song to the others computer mixxx instance where the other person can take over the situation
2016-09-22 10:43:04	brot_	you get what i mean?
2016-09-22 10:44:54	brot_	the two computers share the same music files
2016-09-22 10:44:57	theBear	traditionally djs just swap at a song transition :)
2016-09-22 10:46:29	brot_	well we are no professional DJs, we just want to play together, each on their own computer, but still being able to use features light sync to make easier beatmatching
2016-09-22 10:49:43	theBear	mm indeed... unfortunately i never considered it so you have to wait till someone else arrives
2016-09-22 10:50:36	brot_	i think i could make it possible using midi. though it seems to be quite a hassle
2016-09-22 10:51:04	brot_	just want to know if there is an alternative to midi before trying it
2016-09-22 10:51:20	brot_	or maybe somebody already tried such an exotic thing
2016-09-22 10:51:22	theBear	if it can be done that is the most likely way it'll work

2016-09-22 10:53:26		[10:53]

2016-09-23 12:21:06	JosepMa	[18:03:12] Ermm.. you mentioned creating a branch, which i haven't done.. what was the purpose of doing so? [18:03:12]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	be_	[18:04:51] strictly speaking you don't need to but it's a good idea [18:04:51]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	be_	[18:05:25] branches allow you to work on different sets of changes and propose them for inclusion independently [18:05:25]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	JosepMa	[18:06:00] Mmm..ok, i understand. But it's better that i create it now taht i'm sincronized, isn't it? [18:06:00]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	be_	[18:06:05] yes [18:06:05]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	JosepMa	[18:06:34] fine, then i think  i am set up. Thanks [18:06:34]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	be_	[18:06:47] you can create them with git branch, or you can automatically create and switch to a branch with git checkout -b [18:06:47]

2016-09-23 12:21:06	JosepMa	[19:01:54] ^_^ [19:01:54]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	brot_	[20:37:59] hi, if id like two have two mixxx instances, what are my chances making one deck of each instance absolutely syncronous two the other (like in playback position, eq, etc) [20:37:59]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	brot_	[20:38:15] is midi my only option? [20:38:15]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	brot_	[20:42:52] my goal is to have each deck of those two decks outputting exactly the same signal so i can use a mixer with crossfade to switch from one laptop to the other without any audible change. like this i kind of "passed" the current running song to the others computer mixxx instance where the other person can take over the situation [20:42:52]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	brot_	[20:43:04] you get what i mean? [20:43:04]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	brot_	[20:44:54] the two computers share the same music files [20:44:54]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	theBear	[20:44:57] traditionally djs just swap at a song transition :) [20:44:57]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	brot_	[20:46:29] well we are no professional DJs, we just want to play together, each on their own computer, but still being able to use features light sync to make easier beatmatching [20:46:29]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	theBear	[20:49:43] mm indeed... unfortunately i never considered it so you have to wait till someone else arrives [20:49:43]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	brot_	[20:50:36] i think i could make it possible using midi. though it seems to be quite a hassle [20:50:36]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	brot_	[20:51:04] just want to know if there is an alternative to midi before trying it [20:51:04]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	brot_	[20:51:20] or maybe somebody already tried such an exotic thing [20:51:20]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	theBear	[20:51:22] if it can be done that is the most likely way it'll work [20:51:22]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	theBear	[20:53:26] mmm, the sync part alone, which would let you use two machines/copies as if they were the same one, could be handy for things like adding a netbook to a setup for an extra screen/deck worth [20:53:26]
2016-09-23 12:21:06	brot_	[21:35:35] ill give it a try, looking back here for replies occasionally [21:35:35]

2016-09-26 21:42:11	Dave___	[05:23:52] anyone around? [05:23:52]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	be_	[22:44:33] I'm playing music through my Babyface Pro plugged into my router, with the music coming from a USB hard drive plugged into my router. Because I can :P [22:44:33]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	dhon_	[02:26:04] Hi all, does beat grid work for aligning samples without any playing in the decks? [02:26:04]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	dhon_	[02:26:26] (I'm using v1.11) [02:26:26]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	dhon_	[02:27:46] also how do I manually adjust the phase of a track [02:27:46]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	dhon_	[02:29:41] okay, just found the beat-grid adjust button. Sounds like what I want [02:29:41]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	be_	[02:39:44] no, sync doesn't work well with short samples unfortunately [02:39:44]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	be_	[02:39:55] also, 1.11 is outdated [02:39:55]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	dhon_	[02:48:58] they're more loops that I'm using the samplers to play [02:48:58]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	dhon_	[02:50:11] they're about 30s long [02:50:11]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	dhon_	[02:50:14] 2.0 has crashed a few times for me so I'm using 1.11 as it's listed as the current stable release [02:50:14]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	dhon_	[02:50:57] sorry, previous stable release [02:50:57]
2016-09-26 21:42:11	dhon_	[02:51:30] it's possible though that I'm responsible for the crashes as I'm playing around with a virtual MIDI controller [02:51:30]

2016-09-27 08:23:01	Pegasus_RPG	oh hm maybe not https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/multi-os/
2016-09-27 08:23:03	sblaisot	No, travis only builds on MAC & Linux. and travis mac build currently fails (timeout because creating build env + compiling is too long)
2016-09-27 08:23:54	sblaisot	I tried to achieve that with AppVeyor, but building our build env before each build is a real pain
2016-09-27 08:24:47	sblaisot	This is why I proposed to package our build env pre-built and only download it and put it on the build server without needing to recompile each external lib
2016-09-27 08:25:31	sblaisot	but even this way, we need to install all building tools (VC, python, NSIS or Wix, etc...) and this is not that easy.

2016-09-27 11:44:23	yids	and what a bout midi clock in?
2016-09-27 11:44:32	yids	that would be pretty cool
2016-09-27 11:45:02	yids	and how do i make my mixxx 1 work again after I build mixxx2 ? :S
2016-09-27 11:45:19	yids	when i try to start mixxx1 it complains about skins of mixxx2 not being found
2016-09-27 11:45:36	yids	i suppos mixxx2 overwrites you config files :/

2016-09-27 12:23:57	Pegasus_RPG	MIDI clock in is not implemented AFAIK
2016-09-27 12:24:57	Pegasus_RPG	Mixxx 1 should just work (ignoring config settings that only apply to Mixxx 2) as long as the old skin resource files are present and the config is set to use a Mixxx 1 skin

2016-09-27 12:30:01	yids	Pegasus_RPG: ah yea thanks, uh i did not remove any skins or anything i just did scons, no sudo so /usr/share/mixxx should not have been overwriten
2016-09-27 12:30:40	yids	other question, is it possible to keep a loop active even after reloading a track? it saves the loop but i have to reactivate it when i reload the track
2016-09-27 12:36:00		[12:30]
2016-09-27 12:46:19	Pegasus_RPG	no that's not possible
2016-09-27 12:46:34	Pegasus_RPG	Though it could be done
2016-09-27 12:46:48	Pegasus_RPG	similar to how cue recall is now
2016-09-27 12:48:53	yids	ok well track looping ftw it will do what i want
2016-09-27 12:49:43	yids	im basicly using mixxx as a sample looper, its slightly overkill but there is nothing out there that can just loop and pitchshift samples in a proper way :/

2016-09-27 12:51:23	Pegasus_RPG	Then you may be interested to know that Mixxx has more samplers internally than are shown on screen. (16 I think.) You'd need to use a controller and adjust its script code to access the "hidden" ones though.
2016-09-27 12:51:23		[12:51]
2016-09-27 12:52:32	Pegasus_RPG	yids: take a look at Oscillicious' tools though: http://oscillicious.com/
2016-09-27 12:52:38	yids	ah yea thanks but 2 is fine :) its for just playing some loops from songs over my liveset
2016-09-27 12:52:42	yids	hmm will look into that
2016-09-27 12:53:10	yids	hm i dont do windows

2016-09-27 16:01:34	be_	might be more appropriate for what you're trying to do than Mixxx
2016-09-27 16:07:00		[16:01]
2016-09-27 16:30:22	yids	none of them support bpm detection and syncing
2016-09-27 16:30:22		[16:30]
2016-09-27 16:32:38	yids	or easy loading of samples
2016-09-27 16:32:56	yids	and controlling everything with midi

2016-09-27 16:38:51	be_	ah
2016-09-27 16:39:07	yids	hm actually luppp looks interesting, i think i couldnt figure out how to map midi controllers with it  but aperently it should be possible
2016-09-27 16:39:27	be_	what controller(s) do you have?
2016-09-27 16:39:41	yids	i wanna use it with a padkontrol
2016-09-27 16:40:11	yids	wonder if it syncs to midi as well
2016-09-27 16:40:17	yids	cause that would be awesome
2016-09-27 16:40:37	yids	the timestretching seems to work pretty good actually
2016-09-27 16:40:54	yids	withouth pitch change
2016-09-27 16:41:37	be_	:/ seems there hasn't been much work on Luppp since the initial release
2016-09-27 16:42:09	yids	well, if it works it works i guess
2016-09-27 16:42:38	yids	just wondering where this "extensive midi support" that they mention is supposed to be set up
2016-09-27 16:43:53	be_	I don't see any documentation at all on the website...
2016-09-27 16:44:30	yids	no..
2016-09-27 16:44:49	yids	am i gonna have to read the source code to find out how to use midi?:P
2016-09-27 16:45:20	yids	yay youtube tutorial.. :/
2016-09-27 16:45:38	be_	https://github.com/openAVproductions/openAV-Luppp/commits/master
2016-09-27 16:45:52	be_	actually it seems development is still happening, but there hasn't been a release in a long time
2016-09-27 16:47:02	yids	ah
2016-09-27 16:47:07	be_	err that development hasn't really been much
2016-09-27 16:47:19	be_	just small bug fixes, mostly contributed by others
2016-09-27 16:50:51	be_	okay so the documentation is just a few videos on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLPVwzZjovbBxIik8lUisH5XdLzALDeY9j&time_continue=5&v=kOGh2tsXBcA
2016-09-27 16:52:03	be_	might be fun to map my Tweaker to it...
2016-09-27 16:52:27	be_	hey maybe I could even map the P32...
2016-09-27 16:52:29	yids	hm might be fun to add midi clock input to it...:P
2016-09-27 16:52:47	be_	I think it can use the JACK clock
2016-09-27 16:53:38	yids	would it automagicly sync to jack transport?
2016-09-27 16:53:38		[16:53]
2016-09-27 16:53:40	yids	lets find out
2016-09-27 16:54:17	be_	Daniel started work on making Mixxx a native JACK client. not sure what the status of that is
2016-09-27 16:55:02	yids	what do you mean with native jack client?
2016-09-27 16:56:15	be_	Mixxx uses JACK through an intermediate library PortAudio
2016-09-27 16:56:39	be_	which is a wrapper around different backend sound APIs across different OSs
2016-09-27 16:56:54	yids	ah
2016-09-27 16:56:56	be_	but it oversimplifies JACK
2016-09-27 16:58:37	be_	hmm maybe I could map my roommate's APC 40 Mk2...
2016-09-27 16:58:40	yids	hm when i start lupp my jack transport master (seq24) isnt able to start anymore :P
2016-09-27 16:59:35	be_	I don't know enough about JACK to help you there
2016-09-27 17:01:22	yids	hmz it does try to be jack master so thats something i suppose
2016-09-27 17:02:32	yids	hm now that i put the sound tru my speakers i do realize that it sounds really horible actually :P
2016-09-27 17:02:54	yids	something is going very wrong somewere
2016-09-27 17:03:31	yids	it also seems to be unable to keep tempo and volume :P
2016-09-27 17:03:43	be_	xruns?
2016-09-27 17:04:06	yids	no
2016-09-27 17:06:35	yids	mhz maybe its something with the samplerate of the sample i think its different maybe it has troubles resampling it orso
2016-09-27 17:10:48	be_	possible
2016-09-27 17:10:48		[17:10]

2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[02:01:33] might be more appropriate for what you're trying to do than Mixxx [02:01:33]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:30:21] none of them support bpm detection and syncing [02:30:21]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:32:37] or easy loading of samples [02:32:37]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:32:55] and controlling everything with midi [02:32:55]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[02:38:50] ah [02:38:50]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:39:06] hm actually luppp looks interesting, i think i couldnt figure out how to map midi controllers with it  but aperently it should be possible [02:39:06]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[02:39:26] what controller(s) do you have? [02:39:26]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:39:40] i wanna use it with a padkontrol [02:39:40]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:40:10] wonder if it syncs to midi as well [02:40:10]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:40:16] cause that would be awesome [02:40:16]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:40:36] the timestretching seems to work pretty good actually [02:40:36]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:40:53] withouth pitch change [02:40:53]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[02:41:36] :/ seems there hasn't been much work on Luppp since the initial release [02:41:36]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:42:08] well, if it works it works i guess [02:42:08]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:42:37] just wondering where this "extensive midi support" that they mention is supposed to be set up [02:42:37]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[02:43:52] I don't see any documentation at all on the website... [02:43:52]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:44:29] no.. [02:44:29]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:44:48] am i gonna have to read the source code to find out how to use midi?:P [02:44:48]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:45:19] yay youtube tutorial.. :/ [02:45:19]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[02:45:37] https://github.com/openAVproductions/openAV-Luppp/commits/master [02:45:37]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[02:45:51] actually it seems development is still happening, but there hasn't been a release in a long time [02:45:51]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:47:01] ah [02:47:01]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[02:47:06] err that development hasn't really been much [02:47:06]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[02:47:19] just small bug fixes, mostly contributed by others [02:47:19]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[02:50:50] okay so the documentation is just a few videos on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLPVwzZjovbBxIik8lUisH5XdLzALDeY9j&time_continue=5&v=kOGh2tsXBcA [02:50:50]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[02:52:02] might be fun to map my Tweaker to it... [02:52:02]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[02:52:26] hey maybe I could even map the P32... [02:52:26]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:52:28] hm might be fun to add midi clock input to it...:P [02:52:28]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[02:52:46] I think it can use the JACK clock [02:52:46]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:53:37] would it automagicly sync to jack transport? [02:53:37]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:53:39] lets find out [02:53:39]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[02:54:16] Daniel started work on making Mixxx a native JACK client. not sure what the status of that is [02:54:16]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:55:01] what do you mean with native jack client? [02:55:01]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[02:56:14] Mixxx uses JACK through an intermediate library PortAudio [02:56:14]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[02:56:38] which is a wrapper around different backend sound APIs across different OSs [02:56:38]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:56:53] ah [02:56:53]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[02:56:55] but it oversimplifies JACK [02:56:55]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[02:58:36] hmm maybe I could map my roommate's APC 40 Mk2... [02:58:36]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[02:58:39] hm when i start lupp my jack transport master (seq24) isnt able to start anymore :P [02:58:39]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[02:59:34] I don't know enough about JACK to help you there [02:59:34]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[03:01:21] hmz it does try to be jack master so thats something i suppose [03:01:21]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[03:02:31] hm now that i put the sound tru my speakers i do realize that it sounds really horible actually :P [03:02:31]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[03:02:53] something is going very wrong somewere [03:02:53]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[03:03:31] it also seems to be unable to keep tempo and volume :P [03:03:31]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[03:03:42] xruns? [03:03:42]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[03:04:05] no [03:04:05]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[03:06:34] mhz maybe its something with the samplerate of the sample i think its different maybe it has troubles resampling it orso [03:06:34]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	be_	[03:10:47] possible [03:10:47]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	yids	[03:13:06] anyway im off to bed thanks for the tip ;) [03:13:06]
2016-09-27 22:59:35	theBear	[06:39:51] yids, you wanna get comfortable and familiar with the difference between midi sync and midi time code ("MTC") at about this stage, otherwise yer likely to start getting confusing little "surprises" and things not syncing and/or started/playing and maybe a bit of jumping forwards or backwards in time in expected moments and unpredictable amounts, but likely only some of the programs/transports you got going at the time [06:39:51]

2016-09-28 11:29:17	Pegasus_RPG	Dang it needs more RAM too
2016-09-28 11:29:39	Pegasus_RPG	Nothing like building software to stress a machine's capabilities

2016-09-28 11:30:21	steve-_-1	do you know what's missing to get those back?
2016-09-28 11:30:59	Pegasus_RPG	steve-_-1: sort of. The build server uses AMD CPUs and it's unclear if OSX will run on them (even if it's lied to and told its running on Intel CPUs)
2016-09-28 11:31:22	steve-_-1	ok sounds like some hacking will be required with uncertain outcome
2016-09-28 11:31:44	Pegasus_RPG	correct
2016-09-28 11:32:09	Pegasus_RPG	And the disk space issue affects that as well

2016-09-28 11:40:53	Pegasus_RPG	It would be great if we could cross-compile to OSX from Linux

2016-09-28 11:42:10	be_	yeah that seems like it could potentially be much less headaches

2016-09-28 20:02:01	sblaisot	Hi all. Can someone tell me again what parameter to pass to mixxx-test to have it write results in a file ?
2016-09-28 20:04:54	sblaisot	also, is there a magic parameter to launch only one of the tests ?
2016-09-28 20:05:36	theBear	if it normally just prints them wherever you typed it, something like    testexecutable > file.txt will likely redirect all the bits you want to that file (probly overwrites too, so don't pick a name that exists   and something like    testexe | tee file.txt  will pipe the output to the tee util/program instead of the console, which in turn both writes it to a file AND displays it
2016-09-28 20:06:06	theBear	and blahtest --help or blahtest -h got a good chance to tell you magic if therei s any

2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[21:29:16] Dang it needs more RAM too [21:29:16]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[21:29:38] Nothing like building software to stress a machine's capabilities [21:29:38]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[21:29:56] That or rendering 4K video [21:29:56]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	steve-_-1	[21:30:11] Pegasus_RPG: what about macOS builds? [21:30:11]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	steve-_-1	[21:30:20] do you know what's missing to get those back? [21:30:20]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[21:30:58] steve-_-1: sort of. The build server uses AMD CPUs and it's unclear if OSX will run on them (even if it's lied to and told its running on Intel CPUs) [21:30:58]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	steve-_-1	[21:31:21] ok sounds like some hacking will be required with uncertain outcome [21:31:21]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[21:31:43] correct [21:31:43]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[21:32:08] And the disk space issue affects that as well [21:32:08]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	steve-_-1	[21:32:36] ok bedtime in europe. night all [21:32:36]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	 *	Pegasus_RPG [21:32:38] upgrades Jenkins. sblaisot may need to upgrade his machine's agent again [21:32:38]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	be_	[21:33:02] can you emulate an Intel CPU? [21:33:02]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[21:33:06] Yes [21:33:06]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	be_	[21:33:15] but I'm guessing it'd be slow [21:33:15]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[21:33:34] There are a handful of instructions OSX needs [21:33:34]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[21:33:41] IIUC [21:33:41]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	be_	[21:34:33] I didn't realize there were instructions Intel CPUs used that AMD doesn't support [21:34:33]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[21:39:40] They have similar ones, they're just not exactly the same [21:39:40]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[21:39:55] OSX uses them to enforce running on a genuine Intel CPU [21:39:55]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[21:40:24] So I don't expect any slowdown to be significant [21:40:24]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	be_	[21:40:28] how nice of Apple [21:40:28]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[21:40:52] It would be great if we could cross-compile to OSX from Linux [21:40:52]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[21:41:18] (and if the Windows cross-compilation builds performed as well as native MSVC ones) [21:41:18]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	be_	[21:42:09] yeah that seems like it could potentially be much less headaches [21:42:09]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[21:43:11] gah, the pbuilder directory on the Ubuntu builder is massive. I don't know what is safe to delete for now [21:43:11]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	sblaisot	[22:01:06] Pegasus_RPG: rm -rf / :) [22:01:06]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	sblaisot	[22:01:48] kids, don't try this at home, they are *professionnal* :D [22:01:48]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[22:04:38] :P [22:04:38]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[22:04:49] not a chance... it took hours to get the VM set up :) [22:04:49]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	sblaisot	[22:07:34] Pegasus_RPG: ok, it's bed time for me. I will upgrade the jenkins client tomorrow. I know how to do it now, i've done it yesterday ;) [22:07:34]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	sblaisot	[22:08:02] any chance to have a 2.1 build env before end of year ? [22:08:02]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	sblaisot	[22:08:11] I need this to have wix integration merged [22:08:11]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[22:09:24] sblaisot: it's okay, no upgrade needed this time apparently [22:09:24]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[22:09:49] Probably [22:09:49]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[22:20:03] The disk space issue is the biggest and I'll be fixing that soon [22:20:03]
2016-09-29 00:46:13	Pegasus_RPG	[22:20:13] or at least staving it off until later [22:20:13]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	theBear	[05:23:42] this should take the edge off if yer day coulda been more awesome up till now ... http://img.memecdn.com/dj-so-serious_o_874931.gif    perfectly sfw and children and pfft ya know, clean, and even topic relevant :-)  byline reads "why so serious ?" and i be shocked off my chair if you expect anything even close knowing that [05:23:42]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	theBear	[05:34:54] and if yer day really ain't bein' kind, you can paint yerself 3 different shades of lucky, it seems today we have a rare disco floor double feature !  http://img.memecdn.com/seriously-why-not_webm_3004873.gif [05:34:54]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	theBear	[05:35:00] you're welcome :) [05:35:00]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	sblaisot	[06:02:01] Hi all. Can someone tell me again what parameter to pass to mixxx-test to have it write results in a file ? [06:02:01]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	sblaisot	[06:04:54] also, is there a magic parameter to launch only one of the tests ? [06:04:54]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	theBear	[06:05:35] if it normally just prints them wherever you typed it, something like    testexecutable > file.txt will likely redirect all the bits you want to that file (probly overwrites too, so don't pick a name that exists   and something like    testexe | tee file.txt  will pipe the output to the tee util/program instead of the console, which in turn both writes it to a file AND displays it [06:05:35]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	theBear	[06:06:06] and blahtest --help or blahtest -h got a good chance to tell you magic if therei s any [06:06:06]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	sblaisot	[06:21:36] theBear: well, I mean on windows ;) mixxx-test doesn't print anything on its standard output on windows :( the only way is to send output to file [06:21:36]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	sblaisot	[06:22:08] --help told me what I needed. I don't know why I didn't think myself [06:22:08]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	sblaisot	[06:23:30] s/myself/of it myself/ [06:23:30]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	sblaisot	[06:23:41] well, I'm not well awake I think [06:23:41]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	theBear	[09:17:12] sblaisot, oh ummmmmm, hmm try with both those help options how i listed, and also /?  and /help which usually one of will work on windows stuff... always a bit hard to guess/be sure what you gonna get with something like mixxx that (i assume/kinda sure from long lost memories/or wrong from dreamed up memories :] ) as far as things like what "standard" or common switches may or may not do things like you looking for a little tiny bit of help or even if [09:17:12]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	theBear	[09:17:12] you gonna need / or - to get a start [09:17:12]
2016-09-29 00:46:14	theBear	[09:22:40] oh you already sorted, well, i'll just err, stop trying to help 3 hours ago then <grin> [09:22:40]

2016-09-29 01:47:08	Rubz	evening all (or afternoon), so im fiddling around with timecode vinyl and mixx with my setup, just got new stylus and everything but im getting these squahed elipse signals in the visual rep of the timecode in mixxx preferences menu
2016-09-29 01:50:22	Rubz	ive been working with my physical setup to s if its somthing there causing the imbalance but im not sure that it is, when using serato dvs trial the signal looks a lot rounder and clean but it also has t 2 bart balance section in the menu to help round off any oddities in the signal

2016-09-29 01:52:03	Rubz	lol keyboard failed, i meant to say they have a 2 part balance tweak for the time code signal

2016-09-30 00:48:24	steve-_-1	[21:30:11] Pegasus_RPG: what about macOS builds? [21:30:11]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	steve-_-1	[21:30:20] do you know what's missing to get those back? [21:30:20]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Pegasus_RPG	[21:30:58] steve-_-1: sort of. The build server uses AMD CPUs and it's unclear if OSX will run on them (even if it's lied to and told its running on Intel CPUs) [21:30:58]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	steve-_-1	[21:31:21] ok sounds like some hacking will be required with uncertain outcome [21:31:21]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Pegasus_RPG	[21:31:43] correct [21:31:43]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Pegasus_RPG	[21:32:08] And the disk space issue affects that as well [21:32:08]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	steve-_-1	[21:32:36] ok bedtime in europe. night all [21:32:36]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	 *	Pegasus_RPG [21:32:38] upgrades Jenkins. sblaisot may need to upgrade his machine's agent again [21:32:38]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	be_	[21:33:02] can you emulate an Intel CPU? [21:33:02]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Pegasus_RPG	[21:33:06] Yes [21:33:06]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	be_	[21:33:15] but I'm guessing it'd be slow [21:33:15]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Pegasus_RPG	[21:33:34] There are a handful of instructions OSX needs [21:33:34]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Pegasus_RPG	[21:33:41] IIUC [21:33:41]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	be_	[21:34:33] I didn't realize there were instructions Intel CPUs used that AMD doesn't support [21:34:33]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Pegasus_RPG	[21:39:40] They have similar ones, they're just not exactly the same [21:39:40]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Pegasus_RPG	[21:39:55] OSX uses them to enforce running on a genuine Intel CPU [21:39:55]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Pegasus_RPG	[21:40:24] So I don't expect any slowdown to be significant [21:40:24]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	be_	[21:40:28] how nice of Apple [21:40:28]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Pegasus_RPG	[21:40:52] It would be great if we could cross-compile to OSX from Linux [21:40:52]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Pegasus_RPG	[21:41:18] (and if the Windows cross-compilation builds performed as well as native MSVC ones) [21:41:18]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	be_	[21:42:09] yeah that seems like it could potentially be much less headaches [21:42:09]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Pegasus_RPG	[21:43:11] gah, the pbuilder directory on the Ubuntu builder is massive. I don't know what is safe to delete for now [21:43:11]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	sblaisot	[22:01:06] Pegasus_RPG: rm -rf / :) [22:01:06]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	sblaisot	[22:01:48] kids, don't try this at home, they are *professionnal* :D [22:01:48]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Pegasus_RPG	[22:04:38] :P [22:04:38]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Pegasus_RPG	[22:04:49] not a chance... it took hours to get the VM set up :) [22:04:49]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	sblaisot	[22:07:34] Pegasus_RPG: ok, it's bed time for me. I will upgrade the jenkins client tomorrow. I know how to do it now, i've done it yesterday ;) [22:07:34]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	sblaisot	[22:08:02] any chance to have a 2.1 build env before end of year ? [22:08:02]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	sblaisot	[22:08:11] I need this to have wix integration merged [22:08:11]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Pegasus_RPG	[22:09:24] sblaisot: it's okay, no upgrade needed this time apparently [22:09:24]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Pegasus_RPG	[22:09:49] Probably [22:09:49]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Pegasus_RPG	[22:20:03] The disk space issue is the biggest and I'll be fixing that soon [22:20:03]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Pegasus_RPG	[22:20:13] or at least staving it off until later [22:20:13]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	theBear	[05:23:42] this should take the edge off if yer day coulda been more awesome up till now ... http://img.memecdn.com/dj-so-serious_o_874931.gif    perfectly sfw and children and pfft ya know, clean, and even topic relevant :-)  byline reads "why so serious ?" and i be shocked off my chair if you expect anything even close knowing that [05:23:42]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	theBear	[05:34:54] and if yer day really ain't bein' kind, you can paint yerself 3 different shades of lucky, it seems today we have a rare disco floor double feature !  http://img.memecdn.com/seriously-why-not_webm_3004873.gif [05:34:54]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	theBear	[05:35:00] you're welcome :) [05:35:00]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	sblaisot	[06:02:01] Hi all. Can someone tell me again what parameter to pass to mixxx-test to have it write results in a file ? [06:02:01]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	sblaisot	[06:04:54] also, is there a magic parameter to launch only one of the tests ? [06:04:54]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	theBear	[06:05:35] if it normally just prints them wherever you typed it, something like    testexecutable > file.txt will likely redirect all the bits you want to that file (probly overwrites too, so don't pick a name that exists   and something like    testexe | tee file.txt  will pipe the output to the tee util/program instead of the console, which in turn both writes it to a file AND displays it [06:05:35]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	theBear	[06:06:06] and blahtest --help or blahtest -h got a good chance to tell you magic if therei s any [06:06:06]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	sblaisot	[06:21:36] theBear: well, I mean on windows ;) mixxx-test doesn't print anything on its standard output on windows :( the only way is to send output to file [06:21:36]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	sblaisot	[06:22:08] --help told me what I needed. I don't know why I didn't think myself [06:22:08]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	sblaisot	[06:23:30] s/myself/of it myself/ [06:23:30]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	sblaisot	[06:23:41] well, I'm not well awake I think [06:23:41]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	theBear	[09:17:12] sblaisot, oh ummmmmm, hmm try with both those help options how i listed, and also /?  and /help which usually one of will work on windows stuff... always a bit hard to guess/be sure what you gonna get with something like mixxx that (i assume/kinda sure from long lost memories/or wrong from dreamed up memories :] ) as far as things like what "standard" or common switches may or may not do things like you looking for a little tiny bit of help or even if [09:17:12]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	theBear	[09:17:12] you gonna need / or - to get a start [09:17:12]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	theBear	[09:22:40] oh you already sorted, well, i'll just err, stop trying to help 3 hours ago then <grin> [09:22:40]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Rubz	[11:47:08] evening all (or afternoon), so im fiddling around with timecode vinyl and mixx with my setup, just got new stylus and everything but im getting these squahed elipse signals in the visual rep of the timecode in mixxx preferences menu [11:47:08]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Rubz	[11:50:22] ive been working with my physical setup to s if its somthing there causing the imbalance but im not sure that it is, when using serato dvs trial the signal looks a lot rounder and clean but it also has t 2 bart balance section in the menu to help round off any oddities in the signal [11:50:22]
2016-09-30 00:48:24	Rubz	[11:52:03] lol keyboard failed, i meant to say they have a 2 part balance tweak for the time code signal [11:52:03]

2016-10-01 14:06:34	theBear	[06:05:35] if it normally just prints them wherever you typed it, something like    testexecutable > file.txt will likely redirect all the bits you want to that file (probly overwrites too, so don't pick a name that exists   and something like    testexe | tee file.txt  will pipe the output to the tee util/program instead of the console, which in turn both writes it to a file AND displays it [06:05:35]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	theBear	[06:06:06] and blahtest --help or blahtest -h got a good chance to tell you magic if therei s any [06:06:06]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	sblaisot	[06:21:36] theBear: well, I mean on windows ;) mixxx-test doesn't print anything on its standard output on windows :( the only way is to send output to file [06:21:36]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	sblaisot	[06:22:08] --help told me what I needed. I don't know why I didn't think myself [06:22:08]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	sblaisot	[06:23:30] s/myself/of it myself/ [06:23:30]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	sblaisot	[06:23:41] well, I'm not well awake I think [06:23:41]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	theBear	[09:17:12] sblaisot, oh ummmmmm, hmm try with both those help options how i listed, and also /?  and /help which usually one of will work on windows stuff... always a bit hard to guess/be sure what you gonna get with something like mixxx that (i assume/kinda sure from long lost memories/or wrong from dreamed up memories :] ) as far as things like what "standard" or common switches may or may not do things like you looking for a little tiny bit of help or even if [09:17:12]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	theBear	[09:17:12] you gonna need / or - to get a start [09:17:12]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	theBear	[09:22:40] oh you already sorted, well, i'll just err, stop trying to help 3 hours ago then <grin> [09:22:40]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	Rubz	[11:47:08] evening all (or afternoon), so im fiddling around with timecode vinyl and mixx with my setup, just got new stylus and everything but im getting these squahed elipse signals in the visual rep of the timecode in mixxx preferences menu [11:47:08]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	Rubz	[11:50:22] ive been working with my physical setup to s if its somthing there causing the imbalance but im not sure that it is, when using serato dvs trial the signal looks a lot rounder and clean but it also has t 2 bart balance section in the menu to help round off any oddities in the signal [11:50:22]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	Rubz	[11:52:03] lol keyboard failed, i meant to say they have a 2 part balance tweak for the time code signal [11:52:03]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	kernet	[15:38:16] im new to open source how can i start contibuting [15:38:16]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	theBear	[15:51:30] heh, first i would try to put aside more than 3. 5 minutes for my contribution :) [15:51:30]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	troulouliou_dev	[19:50:31] hi is  it possible ti compile and use mixx with QT5 atm ; i have a 4K screen and QT4 does not handle hidpi very well [19:50:31]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	--	Notice(mixxx-commits): [19:50:54] [mixxx] sblaisot opened pull request #1020: fix WriteID3v2Tag test (master...WriteID3v2Tag_test_fix) https://git.io/vPLHE [19:50:54]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	Pegasus_RPG	[21:00:11] troulouliou_dev: Devs have built Mixxx with Qt5 but we don't test it regularly so it may or may not work from commit to commit [21:00:11]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	Pegasus_RPG	[21:00:24] We ultimately will migrate to it though [21:00:24]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	Pegasus_RPG	[21:01:07] So you're certainly welcome to try and let us know on mixxx-devel how you fare [21:01:07]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	sblaisot	[21:31:45] someone to give me some help in C++ ? [21:31:45]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	sblaisot	[21:31:53] when I instanciate an object as a variable [21:31:53]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	sblaisot	[21:32:05] like Object myVar(init_params); [21:32:05]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	sblaisot	[21:32:22] is there a way, after that, to unset/free/delete that object ? [21:32:22]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	sblaisot	[21:32:43] my C++ skills are too old [21:32:43]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	sblaisot	[21:33:49] I'm looking for a way to call the destructor and set the variable to null or something like that [21:33:49]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	sblaisot	[21:34:23] I mean, other than leaving the scope of the variable. [21:34:23]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	sblaisot	[21:39:35] is delete myVar; the correct way to do this ? [21:39:35]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	phschafft	[21:59:54] sblaisot: the destructor is called when the var goes out of scope. [21:59:54]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	phschafft	[22:00:03] sblaisot: you can do that if you use new to create it. [22:00:03]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	phschafft	[22:00:09] have a good night! [22:00:09]

2016-10-01 14:06:34	klu	[00:16:11] it only analyzes one track at once [00:16:11]

2016-10-01 14:06:34	troulouliou_dev	[10:21:58] Pegasus_RPG, ok thanks [10:21:58]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	troulouliou_dev	[10:40:30] Pegasus_RPG, Except bugs , skins would be compatible between qt4 & qt5 or all of them have to be rewriten ? [10:40:30]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	troulouliou_dev	[11:40:03] Pegasus_RPG, compil and works with QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=2 ./mixxx ; except the waveform child window where all the control are not scaled and only 1/4 of the control is displayed [11:40:03]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	Pegasus_RPG	[14:20:55] k1u I was just going to answer that we're working on that [14:20:55]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	Pegasus_RPG	[14:21:35] troulouliou_dev: right, skins should work fine, though the waveforms are special cases [14:21:35]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	troulouliou_dev	[15:56:48] Pegasus_RPG, i can get the correct size of the waveform by choosing Software in Preferences-Interfaces [15:56:48]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	troulouliou_dev	[15:57:15] Pegasus_RPG, the onlu graphical glitch remaining is the vinyl / spinning wheel [15:57:15]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	troulouliou_dev	[15:57:31] any idea how it is called in the code ? [15:57:31]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	Pegasus_RPG	[16:18:16] troulouliou_dev: "WSpinny" [16:18:16]
2016-10-01 14:06:34	Pegasus_RPG	[16:18:24] Or really anything called "spinny" [16:18:24]

2016-10-03 04:53:21	sblaisot	[21:32:43] my C++ skills are too old [21:32:43]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	sblaisot	[21:33:49] I'm looking for a way to call the destructor and set the variable to null or something like that [21:33:49]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	sblaisot	[21:34:23] I mean, other than leaving the scope of the variable. [21:34:23]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	sblaisot	[21:39:35] is delete myVar; the correct way to do this ? [21:39:35]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	phschafft	[21:59:54] sblaisot: the destructor is called when the var goes out of scope. [21:59:54]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	phschafft	[22:00:03] sblaisot: you can do that if you use new to create it. [22:00:03]

2016-10-03 04:53:21	troulouliou_dev	[10:40:30] Pegasus_RPG, Except bugs , skins would be compatible between qt4 & qt5 or all of them have to be rewriten ? [10:40:30]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	troulouliou_dev	[11:40:03] Pegasus_RPG, compil and works with QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=2 ./mixxx ; except the waveform child window where all the control are not scaled and only 1/4 of the control is displayed [11:40:03]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	Pegasus_RPG	[14:20:55] k1u I was just going to answer that we're working on that [14:20:55]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	Pegasus_RPG	[14:21:35] troulouliou_dev: right, skins should work fine, though the waveforms are special cases [14:21:35]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	troulouliou_dev	[15:56:48] Pegasus_RPG, i can get the correct size of the waveform by choosing Software in Preferences-Interfaces [15:56:48]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	troulouliou_dev	[15:57:15] Pegasus_RPG, the onlu graphical glitch remaining is the vinyl / spinning wheel [15:57:15]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	troulouliou_dev	[15:57:31] any idea how it is called in the code ? [15:57:31]
2016-10-03 04:53:21	Pegasus_RPG	[16:18:16] troulouliou_dev: "WSpinny" [16:18:16]

2016-10-03 05:19:36	sblaisot	[21:32:43] my C++ skills are too old [21:32:43]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	sblaisot	[21:33:49] I'm looking for a way to call the destructor and set the variable to null or something like that [21:33:49]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	sblaisot	[21:34:23] I mean, other than leaving the scope of the variable. [21:34:23]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	sblaisot	[21:39:35] is delete myVar; the correct way to do this ? [21:39:35]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	phschafft	[21:59:54] sblaisot: the destructor is called when the var goes out of scope. [21:59:54]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	phschafft	[22:00:03] sblaisot: you can do that if you use new to create it. [22:00:03]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	phschafft	[22:00:09] have a good night! [22:00:09]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	klu	[00:15:51] hey there. how can i take advantage of my multicore cpu when analyzing bpm and key of my library? [00:15:51]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	klu	[00:16:11] it only analyzes one track at once [00:16:11]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	klu	[00:17:41] im running 2.0.0 (build 1.12 r5772) on linux mint [00:17:41]

2016-10-03 05:19:36	klu	[09:36:21] at some point i went to bed. did anybody answer or knows what i can do? [09:36:21]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	hfk	[09:39:07] No answer. [09:39:07]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	troulouliou_dev	[10:21:58] Pegasus_RPG, ok thanks [10:21:58]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	troulouliou_dev	[10:40:30] Pegasus_RPG, Except bugs , skins would be compatible between qt4 & qt5 or all of them have to be rewriten ? [10:40:30]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	troulouliou_dev	[11:40:03] Pegasus_RPG, compil and works with QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=2 ./mixxx ; except the waveform child window where all the control are not scaled and only 1/4 of the control is displayed [11:40:03]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	Pegasus_RPG	[14:20:55] k1u I was just going to answer that we're working on that [14:20:55]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	Pegasus_RPG	[14:21:35] troulouliou_dev: right, skins should work fine, though the waveforms are special cases [14:21:35]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	troulouliou_dev	[15:56:48] Pegasus_RPG, i can get the correct size of the waveform by choosing Software in Preferences-Interfaces [15:56:48]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	troulouliou_dev	[15:57:15] Pegasus_RPG, the onlu graphical glitch remaining is the vinyl / spinning wheel [15:57:15]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	troulouliou_dev	[15:57:31] any idea how it is called in the code ? [15:57:31]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	Pegasus_RPG	[16:18:16] troulouliou_dev: "WSpinny" [16:18:16]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	Pegasus_RPG	[16:18:24] Or really anything called "spinny" [16:18:24]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	klu	[16:56:07] hey i got disconnected, did anybody answer? [16:56:07]

2016-10-03 05:19:36	klu	[16:56:23] does it work for somebody? [16:56:23]

2016-10-03 05:19:36	klu	[00:51:49] hey, is there any way i can get the current running deck file name by commandline, midi, dbus, whatever? [00:51:49]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	klu	[01:00:18] the only way i see for the moment is to let linux list the files used by mixxx and then try to determine the correct one by using the information in mixxx's taskbar entry [01:00:18]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	klu	[01:01:40] is there a better way? [01:01:40]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	yids	[02:24:09] Im finding quite some people talking about adding midi clock outto mixxx, even some people who actually fixed it llready back in like 2012, why is not currently in mixxx? [02:24:09]
2016-10-03 05:19:36	M-rryan	[03:25:36] yids : nobody's really taken over that project -- it needs a champion to drive it to completion [03:25:36]

2016-10-05 23:26:10	Rubz	[11:52:03] lol keyboard failed, i meant to say they have a 2 part balance tweak for the time code signal [11:52:03]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	kernet	[15:38:16] im new to open source how can i start contibuting [15:38:16]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	theBear	[15:51:30] heh, first i would try to put aside more than 3. 5 minutes for my contribution :) [15:51:30]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	troulouliou_dev	[19:50:31] hi is  it possible ti compile and use mixx with QT5 atm ; i have a 4K screen and QT4 does not handle hidpi very well [19:50:31]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	--	Notice(mixxx-commits): [19:50:54] [mixxx] sblaisot opened pull request #1020: fix WriteID3v2Tag test (master...WriteID3v2Tag_test_fix) https://git.io/vPLHE [19:50:54]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	Pegasus_RPG	[21:00:11] troulouliou_dev: Devs have built Mixxx with Qt5 but we don't test it regularly so it may or may not work from commit to commit [21:00:11]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	Pegasus_RPG	[21:00:24] We ultimately will migrate to it though [21:00:24]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	Pegasus_RPG	[21:01:07] So you're certainly welcome to try and let us know on mixxx-devel how you fare [21:01:07]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	sblaisot	[21:31:45] someone to give me some help in C++ ? [21:31:45]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	sblaisot	[21:31:53] when I instanciate an object as a variable [21:31:53]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	sblaisot	[21:32:05] like Object myVar(init_params); [21:32:05]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	sblaisot	[21:32:22] is there a way, after that, to unset/free/delete that object ? [21:32:22]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	sblaisot	[21:32:43] my C++ skills are too old [21:32:43]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	sblaisot	[21:33:49] I'm looking for a way to call the destructor and set the variable to null or something like that [21:33:49]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	sblaisot	[21:34:23] I mean, other than leaving the scope of the variable. [21:34:23]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	sblaisot	[21:39:35] is delete myVar; the correct way to do this ? [21:39:35]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	phschafft	[21:59:54] sblaisot: the destructor is called when the var goes out of scope. [21:59:54]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	phschafft	[22:00:03] sblaisot: you can do that if you use new to create it. [22:00:03]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	phschafft	[22:00:09] have a good night! [22:00:09]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	klu	[00:15:51] hey there. how can i take advantage of my multicore cpu when analyzing bpm and key of my library? [00:15:51]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	klu	[00:16:11] it only analyzes one track at once [00:16:11]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	klu	[00:17:41] im running 2.0.0 (build 1.12 r5772) on linux mint [00:17:41]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	klu	[09:36:20] yesterday i wrote, "hey there. how can i take advantage of my multicore cpu when analyzing bpm and key of my library? it only analyzes one track at once. im running 2.0.0 (build 1.12 r5772) on linux mint" [09:36:20]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	klu	[09:36:21] at some point i went to bed. did anybody answer or knows what i can do? [09:36:21]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	hfk	[09:39:07] No answer. [09:39:07]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	troulouliou_dev	[10:21:58] Pegasus_RPG, ok thanks [10:21:58]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	troulouliou_dev	[10:40:30] Pegasus_RPG, Except bugs , skins would be compatible between qt4 & qt5 or all of them have to be rewriten ? [10:40:30]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	troulouliou_dev	[11:40:03] Pegasus_RPG, compil and works with QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=2 ./mixxx ; except the waveform child window where all the control are not scaled and only 1/4 of the control is displayed [11:40:03]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	Pegasus_RPG	[14:20:55] k1u I was just going to answer that we're working on that [14:20:55]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	Pegasus_RPG	[14:21:35] troulouliou_dev: right, skins should work fine, though the waveforms are special cases [14:21:35]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	troulouliou_dev	[15:56:48] Pegasus_RPG, i can get the correct size of the waveform by choosing Software in Preferences-Interfaces [15:56:48]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	troulouliou_dev	[15:57:15] Pegasus_RPG, the onlu graphical glitch remaining is the vinyl / spinning wheel [15:57:15]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	troulouliou_dev	[15:57:31] any idea how it is called in the code ? [15:57:31]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	Pegasus_RPG	[16:18:16] troulouliou_dev: "WSpinny" [16:18:16]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	Pegasus_RPG	[16:18:24] Or really anything called "spinny" [16:18:24]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	klu	[16:56:07] hey i got disconnected, did anybody answer? [16:56:07]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	klu	[16:56:09] "hey there. how can i take advantage of my multicore cpu when analyzing bpm and key of my library? it only analyzes one track at once. im running 2.0.0 (build 1.12 r5772) on linux mint" [16:56:09]

2016-10-05 23:26:10	klu	[00:51:49] hey, is there any way i can get the current running deck file name by commandline, midi, dbus, whatever? [00:51:49]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	klu	[01:00:18] the only way i see for the moment is to let linux list the files used by mixxx and then try to determine the correct one by using the information in mixxx's taskbar entry [01:00:18]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	klu	[01:01:40] is there a better way? [01:01:40]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	yids	[02:24:09] Im finding quite some people talking about adding midi clock outto mixxx, even some people who actually fixed it llready back in like 2012, why is not currently in mixxx? [02:24:09]
2016-10-05 23:26:10	M-rryan	[03:25:36] yids : nobody's really taken over that project -- it needs a champion to drive it to completion [03:25:36]

2016-10-06 23:33:09	Pegasus_RPG	[21:00:11] troulouliou_dev: Devs have built Mixxx with Qt5 but we don't test it regularly so it may or may not work from commit to commit [21:00:11]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	Pegasus_RPG	[21:00:24] We ultimately will migrate to it though [21:00:24]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	Pegasus_RPG	[21:01:07] So you're certainly welcome to try and let us know on mixxx-devel how you fare [21:01:07]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	sblaisot	[21:31:45] someone to give me some help in C++ ? [21:31:45]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	sblaisot	[21:31:53] when I instanciate an object as a variable [21:31:53]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	sblaisot	[21:32:05] like Object myVar(init_params); [21:32:05]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	sblaisot	[21:32:22] is there a way, after that, to unset/free/delete that object ? [21:32:22]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	sblaisot	[21:32:43] my C++ skills are too old [21:32:43]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	sblaisot	[21:33:49] I'm looking for a way to call the destructor and set the variable to null or something like that [21:33:49]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	sblaisot	[21:34:23] I mean, other than leaving the scope of the variable. [21:34:23]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	sblaisot	[21:39:35] is delete myVar; the correct way to do this ? [21:39:35]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	phschafft	[21:59:54] sblaisot: the destructor is called when the var goes out of scope. [21:59:54]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	phschafft	[22:00:03] sblaisot: you can do that if you use new to create it. [22:00:03]

2016-10-06 23:33:09	klu	[00:16:11] it only analyzes one track at once [00:16:11]

2016-10-06 23:33:09	troulouliou_dev	[10:40:30] Pegasus_RPG, Except bugs , skins would be compatible between qt4 & qt5 or all of them have to be rewriten ? [10:40:30]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	troulouliou_dev	[11:40:03] Pegasus_RPG, compil and works with QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=2 ./mixxx ; except the waveform child window where all the control are not scaled and only 1/4 of the control is displayed [11:40:03]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	Pegasus_RPG	[14:20:55] k1u I was just going to answer that we're working on that [14:20:55]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	Pegasus_RPG	[14:21:35] troulouliou_dev: right, skins should work fine, though the waveforms are special cases [14:21:35]
2016-10-06 23:33:09	troulouliou_dev	[15:56:48] Pegasus_RPG, i can get the correct size of the waveform by choosing Software in Preferences-Interfaces [15:56:48]

2016-10-07 05:16:11	phschafft	[21:59:54] sblaisot: the destructor is called when the var goes out of scope. [21:59:54]
2016-10-07 05:16:11	phschafft	[22:00:03] sblaisot: you can do that if you use new to create it. [22:00:03]

2016-10-07 05:16:11	Pegasus_RPG	[14:21:35] troulouliou_dev: right, skins should work fine, though the waveforms are special cases [14:21:35]
2016-10-07 05:16:11	troulouliou_dev	[15:56:48] Pegasus_RPG, i can get the correct size of the waveform by choosing Software in Preferences-Interfaces [15:56:48]

2016-10-07 05:39:26	Pegasus_RPG	[21:00:24] We ultimately will migrate to it though [21:00:24]
2016-10-07 05:39:26	Pegasus_RPG	[21:01:07] So you're certainly welcome to try and let us know on mixxx-devel how you fare [21:01:07]

2016-10-07 05:39:26	sblaisot	[21:32:22] is there a way, after that, to unset/free/delete that object ? [21:32:22]

2016-10-07 15:26:39	troulouliou_dev	[19:50:31] hi is  it possible ti compile and use mixx with QT5 atm ; i have a 4K screen and QT4 does not handle hidpi very well [19:50:31]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	--	Notice(mixxx-commits): [19:50:54] [mixxx] sblaisot opened pull request #1020: fix WriteID3v2Tag test (master...WriteID3v2Tag_test_fix) https://git.io/vPLHE [19:50:54]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	Pegasus_RPG	[21:00:11] troulouliou_dev: Devs have built Mixxx with Qt5 but we don't test it regularly so it may or may not work from commit to commit [21:00:11]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	Pegasus_RPG	[21:00:24] We ultimately will migrate to it though [21:00:24]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	Pegasus_RPG	[21:01:07] So you're certainly welcome to try and let us know on mixxx-devel how you fare [21:01:07]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	sblaisot	[21:31:45] someone to give me some help in C++ ? [21:31:45]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	sblaisot	[21:31:53] when I instanciate an object as a variable [21:31:53]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	sblaisot	[21:32:05] like Object myVar(init_params); [21:32:05]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	sblaisot	[21:32:22] is there a way, after that, to unset/free/delete that object ? [21:32:22]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	sblaisot	[21:32:43] my C++ skills are too old [21:32:43]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	sblaisot	[21:33:49] I'm looking for a way to call the destructor and set the variable to null or something like that [21:33:49]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	sblaisot	[21:34:23] I mean, other than leaving the scope of the variable. [21:34:23]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	sblaisot	[21:39:35] is delete myVar; the correct way to do this ? [21:39:35]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	phschafft	[21:59:54] sblaisot: the destructor is called when the var goes out of scope. [21:59:54]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	phschafft	[22:00:03] sblaisot: you can do that if you use new to create it. [22:00:03]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	phschafft	[22:00:09] have a good night! [22:00:09]

2016-10-07 15:26:39	klu	[00:16:11] it only analyzes one track at once [00:16:11]

2016-10-07 15:26:39	troulouliou_dev	[10:21:58] Pegasus_RPG, ok thanks [10:21:58]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	troulouliou_dev	[10:40:30] Pegasus_RPG, Except bugs , skins would be compatible between qt4 & qt5 or all of them have to be rewriten ? [10:40:30]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	troulouliou_dev	[11:40:03] Pegasus_RPG, compil and works with QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=2 ./mixxx ; except the waveform child window where all the control are not scaled and only 1/4 of the control is displayed [11:40:03]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	Pegasus_RPG	[14:20:55] k1u I was just going to answer that we're working on that [14:20:55]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	Pegasus_RPG	[14:21:35] troulouliou_dev: right, skins should work fine, though the waveforms are special cases [14:21:35]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	troulouliou_dev	[15:56:48] Pegasus_RPG, i can get the correct size of the waveform by choosing Software in Preferences-Interfaces [15:56:48]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	troulouliou_dev	[15:57:15] Pegasus_RPG, the onlu graphical glitch remaining is the vinyl / spinning wheel [15:57:15]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	troulouliou_dev	[15:57:31] any idea how it is called in the code ? [15:57:31]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	Pegasus_RPG	[16:18:16] troulouliou_dev: "WSpinny" [16:18:16]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	Pegasus_RPG	[16:18:24] Or really anything called "spinny" [16:18:24]
2016-10-07 15:26:39	klu	[16:56:07] hey i got disconnected, did anybody answer? [16:56:07]

2016-10-07 15:26:39	klu	[01:00:18] the only way i see for the moment is to let linux list the files used by mixxx and then try to determine the correct one by using the information in mixxx's taskbar entry [01:00:18]

2016-10-07 21:33:47	sblaisot	[21:31:45] someone to give me some help in C++ ? [21:31:45]
2016-10-07 21:33:47	sblaisot	[21:31:53] when I instanciate an object as a variable [21:31:53]

2016-10-07 21:33:47	phschafft	[21:59:54] sblaisot: the destructor is called when the var goes out of scope. [21:59:54]

2016-10-07 21:33:47	Pegasus_RPG	[14:21:35] troulouliou_dev: right, skins should work fine, though the waveforms are special cases [14:21:35]
2016-10-07 21:33:47	troulouliou_dev	[15:56:48] Pegasus_RPG, i can get the correct size of the waveform by choosing Software in Preferences-Interfaces [15:56:48]

2016-10-08 11:00:43	eein_-	hello. is mixxx intentionally not saving settings or is this a bug? I have multiple hardware setups and every time you have to reconfigure. Thats by itself would be ok I guess but more annoying is that the radio settings don't save
2016-10-08 11:01:06	eein_-	mixxx 2.0.0.1
2016-10-08 11:04:32	eein_-	Im going through the reported bugs but if this is known by anyone that would be helpful

2016-10-08 11:16:08	eein_-	linux midzer
2016-10-08 11:20:13	eein_-	it also crashes often when I: plug in new hardware, launch mixxx, reconfigure outs, apply. Then it often hangs and you have to force quit and it then immediately relaunches without my launching it
2016-10-08 11:20:54	eein_-	not sure if that is related to the radio settings not staying

2016-10-08 11:22:56	eein_-	hmm probably. it looks like the radio settings are in ~/.mixxx/mixxx.cfg
2016-10-08 11:23:12	eein_-	that also has references to the controller presets
2016-10-08 11:24:26	yepla	vlc http://yepla.ddns.net:8000/play.m3u <= yepla mixxx live
2016-10-08 11:24:32	yepla	with mixxx :)
2016-10-08 11:26:38	eein_-	so I guess the only way to fix this without addressing the controller stability would be to have the radio settings be a separate file

2016-10-08 11:37:43	eein_-	[21:00:43] hello. is mixxx intentionally not saving settings or is this a bug? I have multiple hardware setups and every time you have to reconfigure. Thats by itself would be ok I guess but more annoying is that the radio settings don't save [21:00:43]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	eein_-	[21:01:06] mixxx 2.0.0.1 [21:01:06]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	eein_-	[21:04:32] Im going through the reported bugs but if this is known by anyone that would be helpful [21:04:32]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	eein_-	[21:07:37] hey Pegasus_RPG [21:07:37]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	midzer	[21:07:44] eein_-: what OS are you using? i have no problems with radio settings under windows [21:07:44]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	eein_-	[21:16:08] linux midzer [21:16:08]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	eein_-	[21:20:13] it also crashes often when I: plug in new hardware, launch mixxx, reconfigure outs, apply. Then it often hangs and you have to force quit and it then immediately relaunches without my launching it [21:20:13]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	eein_-	[21:20:54] not sure if that is related to the radio settings not staying [21:20:54]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	eein_-	[21:22:56] hmm probably. it looks like the radio settings are in ~/.mixxx/mixxx.cfg [21:22:56]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	eein_-	[21:23:12] that also has references to the controller presets [21:23:12]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	yepla	[21:24:26] vlc http://yepla.ddns.net:8000/play.m3u <= yepla mixxx live [21:24:26]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	yepla	[21:24:32] with mixxx :) [21:24:32]
2016-10-08 11:37:43	eein_-	[21:26:38] so I guess the only way to fix this without addressing the controller stability would be to have the radio settings be a separate file [21:26:38]

2016-10-08 11:37:44	eein_-	[21:33:59] do you use multiple hardware setups midzer [21:33:59]
2016-10-08 11:37:44	eein_-	[21:34:31] I would think it would remember my outs for each piece of hardware and set them again when it sees that hardware [21:34:31]

2016-10-08 11:47:44	eein_-	hmm it seems mixxx doesnt like to work with pulse
2016-10-08 11:48:59	eein_-	having pulse as an output causes it to hang on exit
2016-10-08 11:49:43	eein_-	it you force quit it starts playing again out pulse but if you dont force quit and wait a minute it will close but never load a track and play until you force quit
2016-10-08 11:50:24	eein_-	the reason I set pulse as an output is because it is the only way to listen to videos/web audio when mixxx is open
2016-10-08 11:51:01	eein_-	midzer: on windows can you listen to a youtube video while mixxx is open (assuming you use the same audio card for both)
2016-10-08 11:51:43	eein_-	still the radio settings seem to be staying even with a force quit so Im not sure what exactly erases those settings yet
2016-10-08 11:52:26	eein_-	ideally the radio settings would be a different file and that mixxx.cfg file would be created from multiple files
2016-10-08 11:52:58	eein_-	is there thought to having mixxx support multiple profiles?
2016-10-08 11:54:15	eein_-	you definitely cant seem to swap hardware live while mixxx is running
2016-10-08 11:58:23	eein_-	hmm another bug, if your library isnt present tracks dont seem to move from missing to the library again
2016-10-08 11:58:44	eein_-	once the library source is restored, even with relink
2016-10-08 11:59:51	eein_-	k you have to rescan for them to repopulate
2016-10-08 11:59:51		[11:59]
2016-10-08 12:00:13	eein_-	though you can play them from playlists without rescanning

2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:00:43] hello. is mixxx intentionally not saving settings or is this a bug? I have multiple hardware setups and every time you have to reconfigure. Thats by itself would be ok I guess but more annoying is that the radio settings don't save [21:00:43]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:01:06] mixxx 2.0.0.1 [21:01:06]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:04:32] Im going through the reported bugs but if this is known by anyone that would be helpful [21:04:32]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:07:37] hey Pegasus_RPG [21:07:37]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	midzer	[21:07:44] eein_-: what OS are you using? i have no problems with radio settings under windows [21:07:44]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:16:08] linux midzer [21:16:08]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:20:13] it also crashes often when I: plug in new hardware, launch mixxx, reconfigure outs, apply. Then it often hangs and you have to force quit and it then immediately relaunches without my launching it [21:20:13]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:20:54] not sure if that is related to the radio settings not staying [21:20:54]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:22:56] hmm probably. it looks like the radio settings are in ~/.mixxx/mixxx.cfg [21:22:56]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:23:12] that also has references to the controller presets [21:23:12]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	yepla	[21:24:26] vlc http://yepla.ddns.net:8000/play.m3u <= yepla mixxx live [21:24:26]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	yepla	[21:24:32] with mixxx :) [21:24:32]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:26:38] so I guess the only way to fix this without addressing the controller stability would be to have the radio settings be a separate file [21:26:38]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:32:28] Debug [Main]: WARNING: AudioInput already registered! [21:32:28]

2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:33:13] I get a lot of that but nothing that explains why [21:33:13]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:33:59] do you use multiple hardware setups midzer [21:33:59]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:34:31] I would think it would remember my outs for each piece of hardware and set them again when it sees that hardware [21:34:31]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:47:44] hmm it seems mixxx doesnt like to work with pulse [21:47:44]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:48:59] having pulse as an output causes it to hang on exit [21:48:59]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:49:43] it you force quit it starts playing again out pulse but if you dont force quit and wait a minute it will close but never load a track and play until you force quit [21:49:43]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:50:24] the reason I set pulse as an output is because it is the only way to listen to videos/web audio when mixxx is open [21:50:24]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:51:01] midzer: on windows can you listen to a youtube video while mixxx is open (assuming you use the same audio card for both) [21:51:01]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:51:43] still the radio settings seem to be staying even with a force quit so Im not sure what exactly erases those settings yet [21:51:43]
2016-10-09 02:08:37	eein_-	[21:52:26] ideally the radio settings would be a different file and that mixxx.cfg file would be created from multiple files [21:52:26]
2016-10-09 02:08:38	eein_-	[21:52:58] is there thought to having mixxx support multiple profiles? [21:52:58]
2016-10-09 02:08:38	eein_-	[21:54:15] you definitely cant seem to swap hardware live while mixxx is running [21:54:15]
2016-10-09 02:08:38	eein_-	[21:58:23] hmm another bug, if your library isnt present tracks dont seem to move from missing to the library again [21:58:23]
