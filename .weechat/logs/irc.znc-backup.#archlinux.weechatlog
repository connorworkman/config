2016-10-08 11:33:24	mongy	I'm on a chromebook, using LTS 4.4 because 4.5 + is doa

2016-10-08 11:34:39	dviola	you could easily spot the bug with a bisect if you know which version works and which one doesn't

2016-10-08 11:36:22	dviola	broadwell...
2016-10-08 11:36:48	mongy	CONFIG_DW_DMAC=y instead of CONFIG_DW_DMAC=m was supposedly a fix, it wasn't.
2016-10-08 11:37:12	Earnestly	mongy: All that does is build it as a module
