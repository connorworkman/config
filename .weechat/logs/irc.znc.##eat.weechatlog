2016-10-01 14:06:28	@libbies	[22:54:10] i'm eating something that has 'squid powder' listed as an ingredient [22:54:10]
2016-10-01 14:06:28	@libbies	[22:54:24] i wonder if that's powdered-squid or squid-flavoured-powder [22:54:24]
2016-10-01 14:06:28	@elky	[22:59:06] by which you mean squid flavored starch? [22:59:06]
2016-10-01 14:06:28	@elky	[22:59:33] i'd expect the former if it's not a translated ingredients list [22:59:33]
2016-10-01 14:06:28	@elky	[22:59:39] i'd toss a coin if it's translated [22:59:39]
2016-10-01 14:06:28	@libbies	[23:03:58] hm, the external package label says: "assi sonnement fruits de mer" [23:03:58]
