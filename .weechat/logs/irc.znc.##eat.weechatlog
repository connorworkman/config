2016-10-01 14:06:28	@libbies	[22:54:10] i'm eating something that has 'squid powder' listed as an ingredient [22:54:10]
2016-10-01 14:06:28	@libbies	[22:54:24] i wonder if that's powdered-squid or squid-flavoured-powder [22:54:24]
2016-10-01 14:06:28	@elky	[22:59:06] by which you mean squid flavored starch? [22:59:06]
2016-10-01 14:06:28	@elky	[22:59:33] i'd expect the former if it's not a translated ingredients list [22:59:33]
2016-10-01 14:06:28	@elky	[22:59:39] i'd toss a coin if it's translated [22:59:39]
2016-10-01 14:06:28	@libbies	[23:03:58] hm, the external package label says: "assi sonnement fruits de mer" [23:03:58]

2016-10-06 13:38:54	@MacGyver	Correct me if I'm wrong, but 1 "unit" of garlic is a clove, right?
2016-10-06 13:39:14	@MacGyver	As in, a dozen or so cloves make an entire round garlic thingy.
2016-10-06 13:40:25	@meskarune	depends on how much you like garlic :D
2016-10-06 13:40:33	 *	meskarune eats all the garlic
2016-10-06 13:41:03	@Boohbah	I like garlic very much.
2016-10-06 13:41:29	@Boohbah	A bulb or two in every dish is nice.
2016-10-06 13:42:10	@meskarune	:D

2016-10-06 13:57:26	@libbies	dutch cuisine is bizarre @_@
2016-10-06 14:02:48	@Boohbah	meskarune: Also good.
2016-10-06 14:02:58	@Boohbah	libbies: It must be the colonial influence.
2016-10-06 14:03:29	@Boohbah	yum, speciaal saus
2016-10-06 14:09:00		[14:03]
2016-10-06 15:13:21	@meskarune	ok I made chorizo mac'n cheese :D
2016-10-06 15:13:21		[15:13]
2016-10-06 15:13:59	@meskarune	I cooked the chorizo in a sauce pan with a little butter, and then added some flour and made a roux type thing, then added milk/egg/cheese and it turned into a thick sauce
2016-10-06 15:14:19	@meskarune	and added that to the macaroni noodles and then topped it with more cheese and now its baking
2016-10-06 15:20:00		[15:14]
2016-10-06 15:21:49	@MacGyver	libbies: Yes, our cuisine *is* bizarre.
2016-10-06 15:21:58	@MacGyver	libbies: I like to describe it as a hacker cuisine.
2016-10-06 15:22:04	@MacGyver	libbies: We take *everybody's* cuisines.
2016-10-06 15:22:12	@MacGyver	libbies: Tear them down to their base parts.
2016-10-06 15:22:19	@libbies	cultural appropriation~
2016-10-06 15:22:23	@MacGyver	libbies: Then put those base parts back together again in fun and interesting combinations.

2016-10-06 15:22:32	 *	libbies sets a dutch flag on fire
2016-10-06 15:23:15	@MacGyver	I'm not insulted when someone burns my country's flag; in the same vein, I don't get why somebody would be insulted when someone takes a good recipe and makes something else from it.
2016-10-06 15:23:49	@libbies	i'm not being serious
2016-10-06 15:24:09	@libbies	well not too serious
2016-10-06 15:24:21	@libbies	unrelatedly, i'm quite high right now
2016-10-06 15:25:10	@MacGyver	Who's appropriating culture now, eh?
2016-10-06 15:25:14	@MacGyver	That's a typical Dutch thing.
2016-10-06 15:25:16	@libbies	:P
2016-10-06 15:25:22	@MacGyver	According to every foreigner I meet ever.
2016-10-06 15:25:34	@MacGyver	"Oh, you're from Holland, yeah? Aaah, weed and hookers!"
2016-10-06 15:26:08	@MacGyver	Yes, except I've never smoked weed and am not from Amsterdam.
