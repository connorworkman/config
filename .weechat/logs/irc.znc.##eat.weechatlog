2016-10-01 14:06:28	@libbies	[22:54:10] i'm eating something that has 'squid powder' listed as an ingredient [22:54:10]

2016-10-01 14:06:28	@elky	[22:59:06] by which you mean squid flavored starch? [22:59:06]
2016-10-01 14:06:28	@elky	[22:59:33] i'd expect the former if it's not a translated ingredients list [22:59:33]
2016-10-01 14:06:28	@elky	[22:59:39] i'd toss a coin if it's translated [22:59:39]

2016-10-04 21:53:40	@dunz0r	The herbal salt's basically just sea salt + some dried herbs in a jar.

2016-10-04 22:29:46	@dunz0r	I don't think I've ever had it served in school, but we ate it at home quite often
2016-10-04 22:31:55	poisonby	On an unrelated note, is there a name for when you fry a piece of meat and pour meat juice over the meat? I think there is, but I can't for the life of me recall it.
