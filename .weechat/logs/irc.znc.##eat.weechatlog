2016-10-01 14:06:28	@libbies	[22:54:10] i'm eating something that has 'squid powder' listed as an ingredient [22:54:10]
2016-10-01 14:06:28	@libbies	[22:54:24] i wonder if that's powdered-squid or squid-flavoured-powder [22:54:24]
2016-10-01 14:06:28	@elky	[22:59:06] by which you mean squid flavored starch? [22:59:06]
2016-10-01 14:06:28	@elky	[22:59:33] i'd expect the former if it's not a translated ingredients list [22:59:33]
2016-10-01 14:06:28	@elky	[22:59:39] i'd toss a coin if it's translated [22:59:39]

2016-10-07 15:26:36	meskarune	[01:13:59] I cooked the chorizo in a sauce pan with a little butter, and then added some flour and made a roux type thing, then added milk/egg/cheese and it turned into a thick sauce [01:13:59]
2016-10-07 15:26:36	meskarune	[01:14:19] and added that to the macaroni noodles and then topped it with more cheese and now its baking [01:14:19]

2016-10-10 03:36:17	@fod	what kinda veggies
2016-10-10 03:37:54	dunz0r	I think the pack's called "autumn root vegetables". Carrots, parsnip,  stuff like that
2016-10-10 03:38:22	dunz0r	Might be some celeriac as well.
2016-10-10 03:38:37	dunz0r	Perfect for dicing, drizzling some oil, salt and pepper on and doing in the oven :)

2016-10-10 04:56:34	dunz0r	[13:29:48] muh hat [13:29:48]
2016-10-10 04:56:34	dunz0r	[13:33:07] Hmm. I've got some tasty veggies that I'm going to do in the oven... but I don't know what to eat with them [13:33:07]
2016-10-10 04:56:34	dunz0r	[13:33:19] Some kind of meat maybe... but I can't decide on what I want. [13:33:19]
2016-10-10 04:56:34	dunz0r	[13:35:21] Seriously considering making bearneise for it... [13:35:21]
2016-10-10 04:56:34	@fod	[13:36:17] what kinda veggies [13:36:17]
2016-10-10 04:56:34	dunz0r	[13:37:54] I think the pack's called "autumn root vegetables". Carrots, parsnip,  stuff like that [13:37:54]
2016-10-10 04:56:34	dunz0r	[13:38:22] Might be some celeriac as well. [13:38:22]
2016-10-10 04:56:34	dunz0r	[13:38:37] Perfect for dicing, drizzling some oil, salt and pepper on and doing in the oven :) [13:38:37]
2016-10-10 04:56:34	@hoglahoo	[13:39:58] yum [13:39:58]
2016-10-10 04:56:34	dunz0r	[13:40:25] I should hook up a barcode reader so I can log everything I have at home when I put it in the fridge :O [13:40:25]
2016-10-10 04:56:34	dunz0r	[13:40:40] Imagine all the time I'd save on trying to remember what the fuck I have at home [13:40:40]
2016-10-10 04:56:34	dunz0r	[13:41:11] Haven't tried doing my own bearneise. Would be pretty cool. Then I can brag about how awesome it turned out :} [13:41:11]
2016-10-10 04:56:34	@fod	[13:44:43] i like roasted veggies over cheesy polenta [13:44:43]
2016-10-10 04:56:34	@fod	[13:44:48] and a poached egg [13:44:48]
2016-10-10 04:56:34	@fod	[13:45:01] but those veg would do well in a beef stew [13:45:01]
2016-10-10 04:56:34	@fod	[13:45:12] mash the celeriac with potatoes and some fresh horseradish [13:45:12]
2016-10-10 04:56:34	@fod	[13:46:09] also if you've never done it, a bagna cauda drizzle finish over beef stew is just.... godlike. [13:46:09]
2016-10-10 04:56:34	@fod	[13:46:28] eeeeeee i'm excited, stew season is almost here. [13:46:28]
2016-10-10 04:56:34	dunz0r	[13:47:21] Mhm. Autumn ftw. All them root vegetables \o/ [13:47:21]
2016-10-10 04:56:34	@hoglahoo	[13:52:37] mmm stew. y'all making me hungry [13:52:37]
2016-10-10 04:56:34	dunz0r	[13:56:52] Or... I could make a mother fucking chili con carne... [13:56:52]
