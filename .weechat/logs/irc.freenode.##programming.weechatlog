2016-09-09 04:47:31	+pyon	Zuu: OOP doesn't really fit how mathematical objects behave, though. What are the methods of the number 2?
2016-09-09 04:47:44	soulisson	Zuu, to be honest, this is not crystal clear for me, I'm not a real dev, I'm simply interested in dev because of computer security

2016-09-09 04:47:51	+pyon	Zuu: How does the state of the number 2 change when you call these methods?
2016-09-09 04:47:52	berndl	Zuu: just giving methods is not enough to define the behaviour.
2016-09-09 04:48:15	Zuu	soulisson, it will only start to get clearer, as you start doing real programming, and experimenting.

2016-09-09 04:48:56	+pyon	OOP posits that methods belong to objects, but in math, operations are normally associated to whole algebraic structures, rather than individual elements of their carrier sets.
2016-09-09 04:49:18	Zuu	soulisson, and at times, it is genuinely difficult to decide how to structure your software.
2016-09-09 04:49:36	soulisson	Zuu, I wrote some OOP stuff but I always get stuck with those definitions :)
2016-09-09 04:49:38	+pyon	e.g., addition belongs to the reals (or integers or whatever) as a whole, not to each specific number

2016-09-09 04:52:29	Zuu	how each of your functions work on the inside, is more a matter of exact science. How you decide to arrange your functionality into those functions, is more a matter of "art"
2016-09-09 04:52:32	+pyon	berndl: Things get even worse when you want to work with actual data structures. For example, say you want to implement a function that merges two heaps (say, two binomial heaps) - does it belong to the zeroth or the first heap?
2016-09-09 04:53:05	vdamewood	vendu: I'll probably keep developing Petrichor separately, and cherry pick changes from Petrichor to Ukko.
2016-09-09 04:54:04	+pyon	berndl: If it belongs to the zeroth heap, you can't traverse the first heap, and vice versa. But, as anyone who knows their basic data structures and algorithms knows, merging two binomial heaps requires traversing *both*.

Now when I tried to compile PJSIP for 64 bit on this system linking with compiled static libraries failed because archive command which is used to create the 64 bit static libraries is 32 bit. So when linker used those static libs for linking, it is unable to recongnize the format. How can I force the automake to use 64 b

2016-09-09 09:05:15	MisterSyntax	zrx0, i'd say C# is easiest to start with, simply because it's a -typed- language

And pipe() is a system call giving you file descriptors for stdin/stdout of other processes, of course it's fairly easy to do in python but syntax matters.

2016-09-09 14:48:41	pyon	anyway, my reasoning is as follows: since 941 is a lot smaller than 10⁵, there will be lots of multiples of 941 in 1..10⁵

2016-09-09 14:50:32	+PlanckWalk	Actually doing all the multiplications mod N, and just keeping track of powers of the prime factors.

2016-09-09 14:51:20	+PlanckWalk	You don't even need to worry about squares of prime factors, since 941^2 > 10^5
2016-09-09 14:51:20	manuel_	what does that mean, keeping track of powers of the prime factors?
2016-09-09 14:52:25	+PlanckWalk	You're calculating n*(n-1)*...*(n-k+1) / k!  mod N.
2016-09-09 14:52:27	pyon	PlanckWalk: the reason why most such binomial coefficients mod p are 0 is that, if you pick two random numbers in 1..10⁵, there will likely be multiples of 941 and 10627 between them, right?

2016-09-09 14:52:55	+PlanckWalk	As you rightly said, k! often doesn't have a multiplicative inverse mod N

2016-09-09 14:53:08	manuel_	so far so good
2016-09-09 14:53:18	+PlanckWalk	That's because it shares factors with N
2016-09-09 14:53:22	njmbb8	i'm clicking the link for the rules now, but it would be faster to get an answer directly: is HW questions allowed?
2016-09-09 14:53:39	+PlanckWalk	I.e. multiples of 941 and 10627 in the product
2016-09-09 14:53:52	+PlanckWalk	So you can keep track of those separately.
2016-09-09 14:53:52	njmbb8	ok checked the rules

2016-09-09 14:55:57	njmbb8	love it when that happens
2016-09-09 14:55:58	+PlanckWalk	E.g. once you hit 15997, that's 941*17, so you count the 941 and just multiply the 17
2016-09-09 14:56:26	manuel_	good stuff. that's the stuff that's weird about the coding challenges
2016-09-09 14:56:32	manuel_	some i immediately get, stuff like that takes me hours
2016-09-09 14:56:40	manuel_	give me some decent dynamic programming recursion
2016-09-09 14:56:55	+PlanckWalk	If the counts for both 941 and 10627 end up nonzero after subtracting, then the answer is zero.
2016-09-09 14:57:08	+PlanckWalk	(I.e. you don't even need to find the inverse for the denominator)
2016-09-09 14:57:48	SlashLife	njmbb8: It's called "rubber duck debugging".
2016-09-09 14:58:00	+PlanckWalk	Since 941*10627 = 10^7+7 = 0 mod 10^7+7

2016-09-09 14:59:18	+PlanckWalk	10^7+7 is also small enought that you can brute force the inverse.

2016-09-09 16:09:31	systemfa_	icedev: It's the cin >> str that triggers the bad flag.

2016-09-09 16:09:58	hexoroid	icedev yeah but in my case eof works.. gets each line and prints it out from txt to the console
2016-09-09 16:10:30	SlashLife	icedev: op<</op>> operations on I/O streams return the stream itself, so while(cin >> str) actually *does* check the stream.

2016-09-09 23:37:19	sadw	is it necessary to be good in math to be a good programmer?
2016-09-09 23:37:42	piou	sadw: no, but it is necessary to be able to think abstractly
2016-09-09 23:38:08	piou	sadw: then of course you'll have to tackle problems that might be corellated to math so it's always a plus
2016-09-09 23:38:44	sadw	thanks. How about functional programming? can one do FP if he is lousy in math?

2016-09-09 23:44:47	Stefan26	I don't think it's necessary to be good at maths to be a good programmer, especially if the quality of the stuff that you are programming depends much more on whether you fully understand the business domain and the needs of the users, than on your technical software skills
2016-09-09 23:45:21	Stefan26	I think that's usually the case when you program certain GUI apps
2016-09-09 23:45:36	noob_on_rails	Stefan26:  math in programming is more about taking the fastest route
2016-09-09 23:46:23	noob_on_rails	you really don't have to know actual math in depth  , since everything is solved by the computer

2016-09-09 23:47:30	noob_on_rails	imo at least
2016-09-09 23:49:17	Stefan26	yeah I agree -- it's all vague what "math skills" really means anyways. but typically math skills is correlated with many kinds of problem solving skills
2016-09-09 23:50:03	noob_on_rails	yep , decision making , scale computing , it's all math when you are talking about logic
2016-09-09 23:51:16	noob_on_rails	certain business problems , include a good understanding of math tho , when you have an insane DB behind you and you have to generate the right numbers , you have to be able to construct a problem , and solve it

2016-09-10 00:23:54	ConceptThoughts	asas, depends on the type of job your applying for.. sometimes certain knowledge is out of scope of the employment position, you wouldnt apply for an engineer and mention you have experience as a secretary.. tho programming language is kinda in scope, tho it depends upon exactly what youll be doing.. so if they want game developers mention unity if that were the case but probably not SQL

Actually, the generated code from my system would be very safe-- when there is a "server sends hello" state in the machine, the client will have a recv_hello function that takes that data in the message as the argument, and returns a sum type where each variant corresponds to a transition in the state machine

Also, in the android application there are lots of objects that read/write to the local (and remote) database. My problem is i'm loosing sight of the overview, and would like to create some sort of diagram that depicts the overall flow of the applicatoin and how objects

2016-09-10 19:43:17	microcolonel	hence the improvements I'm suggesting
2016-09-10 19:43:19	microcolonel	you guys are amazing
2016-09-10 19:44:09	+ackpacket	microcolonel, if you're talking about a common spammer, your options are very limited, as they are not working for financial gain, they're just screwing with you, and can change to get around most things you throw at them.  If you're talking about organized spammers, they don't give 2 turds about your site, there's no financial gain in it.
2016-09-10 19:44:45	+ackpacket	microcolonel, and if you're operating at such a small scale that a common spammer can degrade your service, then they can always fallback to just DDOSing you for lulz.
2016-09-10 19:45:12	microcolonel	I would like to make it harder for spammers to degrade service -> how do they degrade service? -> by creating load and storage pressure -> That's unreasonable! -> it's literally what is happening right now -> then you should make it harder for spammers to degrade service -> isn't that what I just said a minute ago?

2016-09-11 06:35:14	pyon	nitrix: i'm not denying that it's utterly unhelpful
2016-09-11 06:35:20	+nitrix	pyon: Actually, as soon as you have only unityped, you risk someone doing accidently dynamic classification (even if it's not part of the language), which would be unsafe, by then if the language advises and pretends it is its type system, then their type system is automatically type-unsafe.
2016-09-11 06:35:21	rindolf	MisterSyntax: it's hard to query data that's serialilsed into one big blob.
2016-09-11 06:35:28	MisterSyntax	^ yeah indeed

2016-09-11 06:35:38	pyon	nitrix: but “type safe” simply means “delivers what it promises”, if it doesn't promise to be helpful, it's okay to be unhelpful
2016-09-11 06:35:59	vdamewood	Cmaj6: Then define a way for the different parts to communicate, and consider the data that they 'have' as distinct.
2016-09-11 06:36:06	rindolf	marchelzo: most of the passwords I have for GNU mailman mailing lists are safer than the one for my bank.
2016-09-11 06:36:06	pyon	nitrix: oh sure if you use a single type for everything, you *have* to use dynamic classification all over the place
2016-09-11 06:36:07	marchelzo	at least 8 characters. at least 1 number. at least 1 capital letter. do not use spaces or special characters other than _ @ . -
2016-09-11 06:36:09	marchelzo	why??
2016-09-11 06:36:14	Cmaj6	MisterSyntax, what is the advantage of sending it as binary instead of clear text?
2016-09-11 06:36:32	rindolf	marchelzo: my bank restricts it to [A-Za-z0-9]{6,8}
2016-09-11 06:36:40	MisterSyntax	one would be you don't need actual tables with columns that represent the value types.
2016-09-11 06:36:42	rindolf	marchelzo: I use a password manager.
2016-09-11 06:36:45	marchelzo	rindolf: what the fuck...

2016-09-11 07:42:48	daey	but a tablet is basically a notebook if you use a keyboard+mouse :/
2016-09-11 07:42:53	rindolf	IamTrying: fine - Apple will likely stop innovating soon with Steve Jobs gone.
2016-09-11 07:43:06	rindolf	IamTrying: so it's not a safe bet.
2016-09-11 07:43:20	MisterSyntax	so yeah like daey said, they might take a chunk out, but pcs will defi. keep staying the standard for various things (dev e.g.)
2016-09-11 07:43:21	vdamewood	Also, you can do games on a tablet. I even have a bluetooth controller for my phone. But tablet gaming will only replace consoles, not PC gaming.

2016-09-11 11:34:57	Moose	An associative array is an abstract data structure that just means a key is mapped to as value. A hash table is a data structure that specifically implements a system that uses a hash function over all inputs to a specific output domain and buckets collisions for O(1) read and write at the cost of storage.

2016-09-11 11:38:07	Technodrome	so you can implement this sort of functionality without using a hash table?
2016-09-11 11:38:11	vdamewood	"Left up to the implementation" How many implementations of PHP are there?
2016-09-11 11:38:16	Technodrome	i thought they all used a hash table behind the scenes

2016-09-11 14:53:20	unibyte	icedev: oh, I got the same issue with an older android smartphone. well, judging from the price drop I will probably throw it into garbage
2016-09-11 14:53:21	fmbb	android's quite a mixed bunch. there are some really cheap devices with dodgy carrier bloatware, and some really good ones too.
2016-09-11 14:53:42	+ackpacket	I believe finding great tools is a worthy cause.  Not to be thrown out.  But do any of you feel like we spend *too* much time having qualitative debates about which language or pattern is better, when that's attention that could be applied to better solving the problem itself?
2016-09-11 14:53:46	icedev	yeah my nexus6 is at least finally running stable

2016-09-11 14:57:35	fmbb	I think Android's far more reliable than windows. In my experience most windows tech support is something being hideously broken, while android is more like: how do i copy the music from my smartTV to my phone?

2016-09-11 17:26:39	JazzBot	everywhere, actually
2016-09-11 17:26:45	SlashLife	NateRiver: You should definitely put some code in there to document that it shouldn't be reachable.
2016-09-11 17:26:50	cheater	ok. do you do anything with your wrist to alleviate the pain?
2016-09-11 17:27:18	SlashLife	I don't know C#, in C++ I'd use an assert(false && "This should never be reached."); before returning garbage.

2016-09-11 17:27:33	Kaslai	NateRiver: usually C# is pretty good about detecting whether a return at the end is actually needed
2016-09-11 17:27:42	cheater	what keyboard layout do you use?
2016-09-11 17:27:45	SlashLife	Or better than returning garbage, I'd call std::terminate(), or, if available, __builtin_unreachable();

2016-09-11 17:27:56	Kaslai	If the compiler is complaining that you need a return at the end of the function, then that means the static analysis has determined that the end is actually reachable
2016-09-11 17:28:03	cheater	do you have any pains in your shoulders?
2016-09-11 17:28:07	MisterSyntax	yeah i agree with SlashLife , i put a // should not be reached! behind such 'return null;' lines

2016-09-11 18:18:24	MisterSyntax	pasting code in online tools -can- be fine soo long it's not something security-wise or contains any valid information/data
2016-09-11 18:18:32	cheater	JazzBot: ok. obviously you know that rsi stands for *repetitive strain injury*. so one thing you can do is to get rid of repetitive strain. situations that make you twist your hand in an unnatural way repeatedly. for example, the qwerty layout, as well as most others, are built so that they create such situations repeatedly. let me ask you a few questions about how you use your keyboard. 1. do ...
2016-09-11 18:18:38	cheater	... you use a home position on your keyboard for your hands? for example, myself, my fingers are on asdf for the left hand and hjkl for the right hand and rarely leave that position at all. do you have a home position? what keys are they? 2. how do you use the ctrl buttons? do you press them with your fingers? 3. do you use the linux terminal a lot? if yes, do you use keyboard shortcuts that ...
2016-09-11 18:18:44	cheater	... readline provides, such as ctrl-a/ctrl-e, ctrl-h, ctrl-w, ctrl-j, ctrl-o? 4. when in the browser do you mostly use they keyboard or the mouse? 5. have you considered switching the keyboard layout? 6. when you press enter, do you move your whole forearm before you press the enter key, or do you just twist your wrist and press it with your pinky?
2016-09-11 18:18:52	MisterSyntax	i'm always a bit.. sceptical towards online tools and whether they steal my codes or values :p

2016-09-12 02:04:01	fmbb	starship_trooper, So a technique you should learn is testing. Feed in a list of inputs to the program and have it automatically check the outputs against a pre-constructed list you made yourself.

Trying to figure out why my function is returning unexpectedly. https://gist.github.com/dragos240/acc6625c7e56523fa7d86f40d9b3eff9 debug_line() logs the filename and line number to a file. Line 5 logs correctly, but then according to the logs, the next thing it does is return to the function it was called. This is weird because there should be no way for it to return without creating another entry

2016-09-12 11:13:03	imv	Hi, I'm working on a Facebook chatbot, and it sending a message involves a POST to graph.facebook.com .Because of how the app works, I'm sure I'll never want to actually post to that URL from my dev environment, so I was thinking of changing my hosts file to point to my own machine, in order to be able to mock sending messages. The other alternative is to use an environment variable for "production" and dev environments. Any take on which approach is better?

2016-09-12 18:44:09	+exio4	it is a really complex project and requires dealing with the engines, which could be adapted to have a first solid stage and then a liquid stage which is controlled by the onboard computer

2016-09-12 20:26:13	Rounin	Though the absolute maximum length UTF-8 sequence you can have seems to be 7 bytes, and even then, the entire first byte + 2 bits out of every byte would be taken up by metadata
2016-09-12 20:26:31	Rounin	On the other hand, you could also encode some extra codepoints as overlong forms of already existing codepoints
2016-09-12 20:26:39	Rounin	Such as a 3-byte sequence encoded as 6 bytes
2016-09-12 20:26:42	SlashLife	InPhase: If the number of payload bits per byte was decreased, it would actually be possible to circumvent it: FE as start byte, then 8X/9X for payload and AX/BX as the stop byte.
2016-09-12 20:27:16	SlashLife	Rounin: Those are illegal. At the moment, at least.
2016-09-12 20:27:41	SlashLife	Although I already suggested to possibly use that for indication of extensions at some future time.
2016-09-12 20:27:48	Rounin	That's beyond the point, SlashLife

2016-09-13 03:20:16	proggry	hi
2016-09-13 03:21:14	proggry	Let's say I got a parser and the string it can parse can contain prefixes - there should be according to spec - but the parser should be somehow less strict - and accept also non-prefixed items. Anyway - does it make sense adding a flag to the resulting AST whether that item was prefixed or not? Or rather not and just the item value without any prefix indication?
2016-09-13 03:21:18	+rindolf	proggry: hello.

2016-09-13 04:41:58	merijn	But I get annoyed by this web sentiment that everything flashy with a "web2.0" is important and used a lot and languages that have less visibility are somehow not used for "real projects". Because we know there's substantial Haskell projects out there, just not as public as say, yet another crappy custom JS syntax
2016-09-13 04:41:59	+pyon	not that operations is free of challenging stuff (say, concurrency control, banks have to get this right, since there's money involved)
2016-09-13 04:42:05	berndl	I wonder why Haskell though.
2016-09-13 04:42:42	+pyon	berndl: haskell is an excellent language for implementing sophisticated mathematical models, which is exactly what quants do

2016-09-13 04:43:55	berndl	Ah, I see.
2016-09-13 04:44:03	+pyon	berndl: in matlab you have to encode everything as a vector or matrix, because the system doesn't really understand anything else
2016-09-13 04:44:16	berndl	But in the end though, you need numbers.
2016-09-13 04:44:33	+pyon	berndl: of course, and in the end computers need gotos instead of structured control flow

2016-09-13 04:47:22	+pyon	velco: another thing where ml helps (haskell not so much) is keeping stuff compartmentalized, thanks to the module system
2016-09-13 04:47:42	velco	maybe some primitive compilers, which do instruction selection via hardcoded pattern matching
2016-09-13 04:47:57	mizu_no_oto_work	ADTs are probably bigger for compilers than just pattern matching.
2016-09-13 04:47:58	+pyon	velco: for instance, from the pov of the codegen module, the concrete representation of your control flow graph doesn't matter, so you can make it an abstract type
2016-09-13 04:48:01	merijn	velco: I find my AST a lot easier to work with as an ADT
2016-09-13 04:48:02	velco	pyon, again, nice
2016-09-13 04:48:19	velco	I find my AST disappear very early

2016-09-13 04:48:52	+pyon	velco: yes, sure, afterwards you have a control flow graph or whatever -- ml is particularly good at representing such things as well

2016-09-13 04:49:45	merijn	velco: That only happens when you start generating code. There's plenty of high-level optimisation before you get that detailed
2016-09-13 04:50:09	merijn	velco: I would say that's like the last  10-20% of your compilation pipeline
2016-09-13 04:50:24	velco	the first 10%-ish percent and AST is gone
2016-09-13 04:50:50	merijn	You use an AST (optionally of a more limited IR) for the other 80-90%
2016-09-13 04:50:59	+pyon	velco: for instance, eliminating higher-order functions has to be done on the ast, you can't do it once you've transformed everything to pointers and memory blocks
2016-09-13 04:51:02	velco	what specific optimizations you envision whan you say high-level ?
2016-09-13 04:51:02	merijn	velco: Clearly you write very different compilers then I do
2016-09-13 04:51:21	merijn	velco: Inlining, fusion, strictness analysis/unboxing
2016-09-13 04:51:42	+pyon	errr, more precisely, rather than on the ast, it has to be done on the abt (abstract binding tree)
2016-09-13 04:51:54	+pyon	which is an ast enhanced with variable binding information
2016-09-13 04:51:54	velco	merijn, quite probably; of these, I;m concerned only with inlining, for which I need no ast

This application needs however to be running on a windows system that is very locked down, and while I can run jar's on it, I can not install new software that would require a exe installer.

2016-09-13 08:48:31	al_nz1	that might work?

2016-09-13 13:02:06	vdamewood	Ah, but stack.c is the code for the stack, and pancake.c is the code for the pancake. Since struct pancake is the ACTUAL pancake, shouldn't it go into pancake.c?

2016-09-13 13:04:19	vdamewood	b0un7y: So, you have the pancake struct in both stack.c, because stack.c uses pancake, and in pancake.c because it's the code that works with pancake. If you change one copy of the struct, you'll have to change the other to match, right?

2016-09-13 13:09:26	vdamewood	b0un7y: Also, what you usually do is you have multiple C files, and multiple H files, and the H files are what needs to be copies into a C file for it to use another C file's functions, values, and structs.
2016-09-13 13:09:45	vdamewood	b0un7y: By doing it that way, you can break a job up into smaller sub-jobs.
2016-09-13 13:10:07	b0un7y	vdamewood: ah so basically the header file should store the prototypes and the other stuff you put at the top of the .c file

2016-09-13 13:53:14	+vendu	so it might, in some cases, make sense to have "remote swap"
2016-09-13 13:53:52	+vendu	the term swap is a bit misleading; they're called swap partitions, but swapping deals with entire processes whereas modern operating systems typically operate on *pages* =)
2016-09-13 13:53:56	+vendu	so they do paging
2016-09-13 13:54:04	+exio4	would that actually be useful?
2016-09-13 13:54:16	+vendu	exio4, it could be faster than paging on local disks :)
2016-09-13 13:54:21	+exio4	the latency is quite high though...
2016-09-13 13:54:24	+vendu	exio4, if you'd have only a few workstations
2016-09-13 13:54:33	+vendu	exio4, hmm that's a good poing
2016-09-13 13:54:34	+vendu	point*
2016-09-13 13:54:42	+vendu	so it depends on how many pages are going out
2016-09-13 13:54:53	+exio4	bandwidth isn't my first concern with this :P
2016-09-13 13:54:53		[13:54]
2016-09-13 13:54:53	+vendu	so in the end, probably not worth the hassle :)
2016-09-13 13:55:05	+vendu	exio4, latency + bandwidth
2016-09-13 13:55:09	+vendu	this is ALL about speed :D
2016-09-13 13:55:12	+exio4	first!

2016-09-13 13:56:13	+vendu	exio4, but in theory, if the latency is low enough, it might be worthy for a few workstations + a server with a boatload of ram + disk space :)

2016-09-13 22:05:26	AndreasL	So, I just encountered a case where my code went out of bounds with an index, but still functioned correctly most of the time, but in some rare instances (depending on what was in the memory location of the index-out-of-bounds), it would fail. Even when I know exactly what happens, I'm unable to write unit tests which catches this erronous behavior!
2016-09-13 22:05:39	AndreasL	How can I write a test for something like this?

2016-09-14 02:01:29	JX7P	stayKlassy, well, society is complex, but a more modern feminist analysis approaches the question in terms of the privileging of the masculine archetype, a 'perfectly manly man'

2016-09-14 02:03:30	stayKlassy	JX7P, please use simpler words. i've not studied feminism because it is of no interest to me. equality is simpler than an ideology (if you could even call it that)
2016-09-14 02:03:39	fmbb	The majority of the opposition to python I have seen are people who don;t like opinionated languages forcing a style on them - eitehr with the language itself (syntaxtic indents) or the community telling people to use certain coding conventions
2016-09-14 02:03:53	JX7P	stayKlassy, not an ideology, but a model, an analytical vantage point
2016-09-14 02:04:09	Auctus	i like python because "it knows what i meant", even when i try stuff that i think might not work, it works anyway :p

2016-09-14 02:04:35	Henke37	I don't really care about the indentation. the problem is that it's not typo safe. If I typo an identifier, it won't result in a compiler error
2016-09-14 02:04:37	stayKlassy	JX7P, how is feminism useful in the 21st century in the west?
2016-09-14 02:04:55	JX7P	i think that the model of the privileged masculine archetype is a good one for analysing gender inequity in society, as well as the ways in which men are also harmed for deviating from gender expectations
2016-09-14 02:05:05	fmbb	merijn, That is valid. The types of what 3rd party libraries return is under-documented.
2016-09-14 02:05:13	merijn	fmbb: Like, axes.bar from matplotlib takes a "scalar or array-like" argument for color. But pyplot.plot takes "any matplotlib colour" as argument for color. And apparently these are not the same
2016-09-14 02:05:28	Auctus	i think its odd that we expect perfect gender equality... the only way thats going to happen is if we get rid of one gender
2016-09-14 02:05:31	merijn	fmbb: Because passing the same colour to plot as axes.bar throws an exception
2016-09-14 02:05:39	JX7P	stayKlassy, it helps provide a weapon with which to attack gender role prescription
2016-09-14 02:05:41	fmbb	Ya. All languages have problems with API design but python makes it worse by ducktyping in these cases.
2016-09-14 02:05:41	Auctus	'cause we're different. That doesn't have to be a bad thing.

2016-09-14 02:08:16	fmbb	merijn, I do think some hybrid between static and dynamic typing is the ideal situation. I think both have their issues.

2016-09-14 07:39:58	rindolf	another_time: git checkout origin/remote_branch shoulld work i think.
2016-09-14 07:40:10	soulisson	nitrix, ok, I'm going to try to look at it in books
2016-09-14 07:40:13	another_time	where od i specify the new branch name for it tho

2016-09-14 07:41:05	+nitrix	another_time: It'll use the closest similar one known on the origin, provided it knows it exists from a previous fetch.
2016-09-14 07:41:26	another_time	hmm it says command not found

2016-09-14 11:46:41	proggry	however, where comes the variable 'j' in the answer code?
2016-09-14 11:46:52	proggry	I can only see variable 'i' defined - but not 'j'. So is it injected somehow?
2016-09-14 11:47:04	proggry	(protractor is a test framework, so maybe the j comes from there instead?)

2016-09-14 17:41:31	vdamewood	Since the first one starts with 0xE, it indicates that it's the first in a 3-byte character.

2016-09-14 19:17:19	MisterSyntax	then you don't need 2 try catch blocks in the main java thread for read/write, just one and throw a custom exception to the catch defining which failed

2016-09-14 19:40:57	Cragus_	MisterSyntax, Right....? But textures are many colors in a specific order to form various images. Do you just want to do a gradient? Or like...do you want a "stone" texture? 'cause generating that would be incredibly application specific.

2016-09-15 02:50:39	piou	vqrs: because it's used in most courses so you end up knowing the solution by heart instead of understanding it
2016-09-15 02:50:55	merijn	vqrs: Because factorial is better written as a straight loop in most issues

2016-09-15 04:33:23	nitrix	joebobjoe: Perl's interpreter probably uses openssl in its implementation of various SSL facilities.
2016-09-15 04:33:29	Rounin	You could probably rewrite it to use libreSSL or whatever
2016-09-15 04:33:55	joebobjoe	Rounin: but why does the core language need openssl?
2016-09-15 04:34:14	nitrix	joebobjoe: Cryptography is hard enough to get right, people tend to re-use the existing work instead of porting it to other languages.

2016-09-15 05:51:21	ezekielnoob	joebobjoe a combination of things, for example instead of the Link going directly to the REST API, i will instead create a link that links to a UI application that will then launch a restful request to activate the user

2016-09-15 07:20:14	kazagistar	Guest44317: its more useful I think to consider what semantics are used for. The purpose is that you define some axioms or assumptions in the form of semantics, and then use it to prove things about the behavior. "If the programming language has to follow these rules when executing, then this program will do what we want it to do".

My immediate goal is to be able to make calls to which will hook into a delegate event that I already have implemented which is basically an event variable that is the State of
2016-09-15 08:42:23	Phenx_	the service. I need to be able to get that state every minute or so. So basically the idea is that my method will poll the service for the state continuously and client can ask for that state while service is doing work. Anyone know the best way to setup a wcf service to be able to have multi threads or do i even need multi thread? Could i use something like service bus?

2016-09-15 09:32:32	SlashLife	green_mars: Only very few things in C++ have become invalid by being outdated, and you could always still run into them when *reading* code, even if you shouldn't *write* them anymore, so that kind of knowledge may still be of value.

Most people are saying Python or Java, with a few saying Ruby's the way to go. Others are saying HTML/CSS/PHP. Could anyone please give me any advice?

2016-10-02 04:49:59	another_	hi guys
2016-10-02 04:50:02	AnArrayOfAtoms	hello
2016-10-02 04:50:08	SlashLife	In the long run I'd still suggest "diff", as you can also use it to create patches for code bases to pass them around; it'd also be helpful to know it if you need to check the difference between two files on Linux some day. On Windows you can install MSYS2 (from MinGW) to get it, as well as a bunch of other nice command line utilities.

2016-10-02 05:50:42	Batholith	Yeah, like a small image in the side of the website is just fine because it doesn't disrupt the site's usage. But ads that pop up, take a big portion of the screen or play sounds are just a huge no no.

2016-10-02 05:51:16	Batholith	The only reason I use adblock is because some streaming sites just love to disrupt you with their amazing video ads. D:

2016-10-02 05:51:26	gde33	the problem with ads is that you have to show something to thousands of people to get 1 click out of it.
2016-10-02 05:51:46	monq	and that one click is by accident probably
2016-10-02 05:51:50	rindolf	deniska: well, that was part of the theme of the book "The Design of Everyday Things"

2016-10-02 05:52:48	Batholith	All I know about ads is that I heard from another person who works with ads that a surprising amount of ads are clicked. That's literally all I know.

2016-10-02 05:53:33	gde33	pyon: it needs to be a system where your efforts towards describing your needs resolves into product offerings
2016-10-02 05:53:41	deniska	rindolf: what is unusable for one person is an ingrained habit for many others, for example ms office 2003->2007 transition

2016-10-02 10:59:35	mr_foobar	pyon, it seems to generally be better to use a language's own package management system anyways.

2016-10-02 12:27:22	mr_foobar	SlashLife, so i could inspect the program source code (even though it may be obfuscated), the memory content, disk IO operations and network traffic
2016-10-02 12:27:30	go|dfish	r7st: you can't
2016-10-02 12:27:35	SlashLife	Yes, you could.

2016-10-02 12:27:50	deniska	r7st: you can `grep THING *` instead
2016-10-02 12:27:58	go|dfish	r7st: you would have to grep the files directly

2016-10-02 12:28:09	gatorade	SlashLife: you can tell the operation but not what the data is. For example p=11,q=13, n=143=p*q,Φ(143)=120,gcd(e,120)=1 e=23
2016-10-02 12:28:18	SlashLife	Correct, it multiplies. Because my data is on a log scale.
2016-10-02 12:28:18	mr_foobar	SlashLife, and accepts requests from 1000 different IPs with the same packet size of 10 kilobytes at approx. the same time of day... could it be a botnet server?

2016-10-02 12:29:30	gatorade	if you want to do homomorphic encryption on 7 and 3 then you would find c= 2 and c=126

2016-10-02 12:34:42	max123	changing values?
2016-10-02 12:34:50	mr_foobar	max123, yes
2016-10-02 12:34:58	SlashLife	Changing it to your categories so you'll only need to count the number of values rather than having to map it afterwards.
2016-10-02 12:35:06	mr_foobar	max123, so you can just count the number of selected "knight" options
2016-10-02 12:35:09	gatorade	Zuu: the data has to be loaded into it though
2016-10-02 12:35:13	max123	Right ok
2016-10-02 12:35:22	gatorade	it is only encrypted in the enviroment
2016-10-02 12:35:26	Zuu	gatorade, yes, but it can be encrypted while loading it in
2016-10-02 12:36:07	mr_foobar	Zuu, he did say we are talking about a hosting provider, not execution on own hardware
2016-10-02 12:36:07		[12:36]
2016-10-02 12:36:12	Zuu	no, inside the enviroment it wont be encrypted, but it will be inaccessible to anything but that inernal enviroment inside the CPU die
2016-10-02 12:36:29	Zuu	*internal
2016-10-02 12:36:45	Zuu	eventually hosting providers will use these CPU's
2016-10-02 12:36:52	SlashLife	Note that depending on the required security you might not do this in a real world application that actually gets sent to a server, but in your case all the data is openly available anyway, so you can choose your values for maximum convenience for your analysis rather than having to consider data protection.

2016-10-02 12:37:20	mr_foobar	Zuu, his question was in present tense. And I would guess hosting providers use whatever is economical.
2016-10-02 12:38:11	mr_foobar	gatorade, in a conventional VPS yes. the host CPU still has to have access to executable instructions.
2016-10-02 12:38:14	Zuu	gatorade, except, if the vm is only encrypted on disk, and then decrypts itself, then it certainylu is possible to tell what it's doing
2016-10-02 12:38:16	SlashLife	gatorade: Only if they manufacture their own compatible but hacked hardware (or use a backdoor in the actual hardware).
2016-10-02 12:38:41	SlashLife	Well - or emulate such hardware.
2016-10-02 12:38:41	mr_foobar	Zuu, I think we can assume that he wants to run his script, not just store it
2016-10-02 12:38:46	gatorade	true that plus when you enter the decryption key they can just grab it
2016-10-02 12:38:54	Zuu	then he needs hardware support

2016-10-02 20:50:38	amigojapan	thecha: easy, but usually your emails can be blocked by your ISP(happened to me) cause they block the outgoing email port,   and also even if the port is not blocked, usually your emails will end up in people’s spam box, I think, due to it not being a trusted server
2016-10-02 20:51:06	thecha	so you also would need to learn about trusted certificates and such?
2016-10-02 20:51:25	supay_	start off with understanding asymmetric key crypto

2016-10-02 20:51:57	thecha	amigojapan→ i just think it is the paranoid thing to do to run your own infrastructure espacially email since google or yahoo or such can read all our emails
2016-10-02 20:52:02	supay_	amigojapan: thats your ISP's ratelimit. im assuming you arent using a static ip on your RPi, just get another dynamic ip and youre good to go

2016-10-02 20:54:57	supay_	they gain enough information about you without having to read your email.
2016-10-02 20:55:04	liste	thecha: you can use any mail provider and encrypt your mail using GPG if you don't want it read
2016-10-02 20:55:05	thecha	so basically the established mail providers keep any up and coming services and private services from using email
2016-10-02 20:55:28	thecha	liste good point
2016-10-02 20:55:33	supay_	no, they cant. there is a law that prevents them from destroying competition.

2016-10-02 20:58:37	amigojapan	thecha: even if you have your own email server, your ISP knows things like when you sent a message if they really want to

2016-10-02 23:24:37	piou	derbie: the three things that matter less IMHO: video card (because... well, it's mostly text), GPU (because that only means you compile faster, most of the time it's not a game changer at all) and HD (because space is cheap and you can always get an external one later). There again it depends on what you want to program, if you do hardcore 3D graphics then a video card becomes important etc.

2016-10-03 04:32:52		[04:32]

2016-10-03 04:33:54	SaEeDIRHA	moniker-, i can then update their license keys period on my server if the user decides to continue using the application
2016-10-03 04:33:58	mr_foobar	moniker-, he needs to link the installed application to a specific user account and wants to use a code for that

2016-10-03 04:35:26	mr_foobar	SaEeDIRHA, check your DB if the key already exists. if so, generate another one until you have a unique one
2016-10-03 04:35:30	mr_foobar	moniker-, yes
2016-10-03 04:35:46	mr_foobar	moniker-, appereantly he doesnt want to use username and password like everybody else.
2016-10-03 04:35:49	SaEeDIRHA	i can inforce the database to check and make sure the are unique , but i was rather to user some hashing algorithm like md5 or sha1 for each email address to make them unique to that email address
