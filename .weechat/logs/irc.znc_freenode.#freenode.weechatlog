2016-10-17 16:35:27	Juesto	what a paranoid
2016-10-17 16:35:35	kairin	hahaha i was just trying to set it up for fun
2016-10-17 16:35:37	fwilson	it's definitely unlikely
2016-10-17 16:35:38	TingPing	kairin, that is the common opinion. as others said you might not trust the ssl connection for whatever reason, but your session is already compromised at that point so who cares
2016-10-17 16:36:01	Juesto	+Z is when you connect via ssl

2016-10-17 16:36:31	gry	isn't the purpose of the challenge in requiring a user to enter a password at the time of the connection, so that even if their computer is stolen, the attacker doesn't get access to the nickserv account? (I haven't tried the challenge before, but that was my impression)
2016-10-17 16:36:52	kairin	so you can use SASL plain over 6667 ?
2016-10-17 16:36:59	dax	yes

2016-10-17 16:37:19	rud0lf	if i remember well, you can just set server password to nickname:password

If somehow (s)he or another client/server sets -o to this chanop I speak of, then how is a bot/client supposed to know the new mode of this nick. You would think the server would say 'soAndSo #chan MODE -o+v nick nick', but that doesn't seem to be the case. Weechat seems to do just fine, but how can does it do this?!

2016-10-17 18:41:31	Ced	Nebulette and nebulin are homologous proteins associated with the Z-lines of cardiac and skeletal muscle sarcomeres. Although these proteins share 70% sequence homology and an identical domain layout, nebulette is one-tenth the size of nebulin. To define structurally important features of these proteins in terms of the Z-line architecture, we have
2016-10-17 18:41:31	Ced	analyzed the primary structure of nebulette and nebulin from a variety of species and developmental stages. Alignment of the 35 residue nebulin-like modules from both proteins demonstrates that the individual modules share 30-90% homology across the six proteins analyzed. In addition, this analysis demonstrates a number of areas in which the identi
2016-10-17 18:41:31	Ced	ty across the six proteins is as high as 75%. These areas may be important signals for Z-line assembly and function in the striated muscles. Significantly, most of the areas of high identity also coincide with consensus phosphorylation sites. To evaluate if nebulette, like nebulin, exhibits tissue-specific and developmental specific polymorphism, a
2016-10-17 18:41:31	Ced	 series of immunoblot assays were performed. These data demonstrate that nebulettes from different portions of the heart are the same size. Comparison of nebulette from embryonic and adult cardiac muscle also demonstrates that this protein does not appear to vary in size with developmental stage. Consistent with the large number of consensus phosph
2016-10-17 18:41:31	Ced	orylation sites identified in the nebulette primary structure, we find that nebulette is phosphorylated in the cardiac muscle at serine and threonine residues. These data and sequence analyses are discussed in terms of current models for Z-line architecture.

2016-10-18 01:58:21	starsailor	iZ6S82: Well, you can always find another network if you don't like how this one is managed. The reason the round-robin is recommended, as opposed to individual servers, is so that if one fails, you just reconnect to another one, as opposed to always trying a server that isn't up anymore.
2016-10-18 01:58:23	MetaNova	it's also needless effort when the only list that matters is the only one you should be connecting to, which is conveniently accessible by one domain
2016-10-18 01:58:38	starsailor	iZ6S82: Round-robin is a common way to load balance networks.

2016-10-18 02:02:05	MetaNova	it's objectively the best overall solution to simply not have a second list which will, likely, often have inconsistencies

2016-10-18 02:02:19	moniker-	actually wondering why particular server isn't working is a legitimate question, but i doubt they would ask why whole network isnt working
2016-10-18 02:02:21	iZ6S82	for tor usesrs they should allow to create an account through tor (guess the hidden service) one tor ip per 6h should solve the coming problems
2016-10-18 02:02:27	starsailor	moniker-: Point is, it's all seamless if they used the R-R.

2016-10-18 02:09:30	WebUser192837	Well, nevermind. At least a redirect would've been useful, wouldn't it?

2016-10-18 03:16:06	Aex12	Ok, thanks!
2016-10-18 03:16:08	starsailor	Aex12: And that is what you define in HexChat; a SOCKS5 proxy on localhost (127.0.0.1).
2016-10-18 03:16:09	Aex12	Will configure it

2016-10-18 03:16:24	starsailor	Aex12: But again, this is once you get SASL EXTERNAL running.
2016-10-18 03:16:36	Aex12	What is SASL External?
2016-10-18 03:16:36		[03:16]
2016-10-18 03:16:37	starsailor	If you try to connect to the hidden service without it, freenode will immediately kick you off.
2016-10-18 03:17:00	WebUser192837	Did anyone release some tool to create those certificates yet, or is the common advice still to use openssl?
2016-10-18 03:17:04	Fuchs	we are hoping to have more documentation on the whole Tor / extenral SASL thing up in a bit

2016-10-18 03:17:11	grawity	Aex12: it's like SASL PLAIN except instead of "here's my password" it's "use the certificate I just sent"
2016-10-18 03:17:23	Fuchs	WebUser192837: openssl works, there is a manual on OFTC that works well, plus as a pull request on our GitHub

2016-10-18 03:17:34	EvilRoey	hey so I sent a request yesterday for unbannation.. I accidentally copied-and-pasted too much of an article, and got k-lined as a result on my home IP
2016-10-18 03:17:35	EvilRoey	Fuchs: hi!
2016-10-18 03:17:40	Aex12	Ah ok
2016-10-18 03:17:44	starsailor	WebUser192837: It's just a one-line command in bash with openssl.
2016-10-18 03:17:45	Fuchs	EvilRoey: hi, what host?
2016-10-18 03:17:46	grawity	WebUser192837: Windows has at least two built in; there's OpenSSL; there's more on Lunix systems

2016-10-18 12:33:38	starsailor	DMBOWSKY: Newer versions of irssi support SASL out of the box, but you'd need to set up a certificate yourself. I find this tutorial to be very good: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/irssi#Client_certificates

2016-10-18 12:36:13	starsailor	DMBOWSKY: That's as far as SASL EXTERNAL is concerned. Now, for the Tor side, you'd need to have the Tor daemon running, make irssi connect via a SOCKS5 proxy to a specific port (9050 default) to localhost (127.0.0.1), and then connect to the hidden service.
2016-10-18 12:36:49	DMBOWSKY	starsailor: I'm using "torify irssi", and that works, too
