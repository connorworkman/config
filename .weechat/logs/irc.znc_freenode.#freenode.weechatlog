2016-10-17 16:35:06	kairin	that sounds like a whole lot of trouble... just use ssl and msg nickserv?
2016-10-17 16:35:18	kairin	omg mitm rofl
2016-10-17 16:35:27	Juesto	what a paranoid
2016-10-17 16:35:35	kairin	hahaha i was just trying to set it up for fun
2016-10-17 16:35:37	fwilson	it's definitely unlikely
2016-10-17 16:35:38	TingPing	kairin, that is the common opinion. as others said you might not trust the ssl connection for whatever reason, but your session is already compromised at that point so who cares
2016-10-17 16:36:01	Juesto	+Z is when you connect via ssl

2016-10-17 16:36:31	gry	isn't the purpose of the challenge in requiring a user to enter a password at the time of the connection, so that even if their computer is stolen, the attacker doesn't get access to the nickserv account? (I haven't tried the challenge before, but that was my impression)
2016-10-17 16:36:52	kairin	so you can use SASL plain over 6667 ?
2016-10-17 16:36:59	dax	yes
2016-10-17 16:37:00	rud0lf	yes
2016-10-17 16:37:08	kairin	who on earth would do that?
2016-10-17 16:37:12	gry	yes, just like you can message nickserv over a plaintext connection
2016-10-17 16:37:18	gry	that's not disabled currently
2016-10-17 16:37:19	rud0lf	if i remember well, you can just set server password to nickname:password
2016-10-17 16:37:21	TingPing	kairin, probably people that don't care or know better
2016-10-17 16:37:27	gry	yes rud0lf

2016-10-17 16:37:58	kairin	so i just want to know, who in the world uses that +SSL seems like waayyyyy 2 much trouble.
2016-10-17 16:38:04	rud0lf	of freenode or of irc, Juesto ?
2016-10-17 16:38:17	Juesto	irc
2016-10-17 16:38:23	rud0lf	oh ok
2016-10-17 16:38:36	Juesto	freenode's ircd is a highly customized one
2016-10-17 16:38:49	rud0lf	kairin: ssl at all? it's just a port change + ticking 'use ssl'
