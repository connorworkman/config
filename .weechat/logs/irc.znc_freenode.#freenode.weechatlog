2016-10-17 16:35:27	Juesto	what a paranoid
2016-10-17 16:35:35	kairin	hahaha i was just trying to set it up for fun
2016-10-17 16:35:37	fwilson	it's definitely unlikely
2016-10-17 16:35:38	TingPing	kairin, that is the common opinion. as others said you might not trust the ssl connection for whatever reason, but your session is already compromised at that point so who cares
2016-10-17 16:36:01	Juesto	+Z is when you connect via ssl

2016-10-17 16:36:31	gry	isn't the purpose of the challenge in requiring a user to enter a password at the time of the connection, so that even if their computer is stolen, the attacker doesn't get access to the nickserv account? (I haven't tried the challenge before, but that was my impression)
2016-10-17 16:36:52	kairin	so you can use SASL plain over 6667 ?
2016-10-17 16:36:59	dax	yes

If somehow (s)he or another client/server sets -o to this chanop I speak of, then how is a bot/client supposed to know the new mode of this nick. You would think the server would say 'soAndSo #chan MODE -o+v nick nick', but that doesn't seem to be the case. Weechat seems to do just fine, but how can does it do this?!

2016-10-17 18:41:31	Ced	Nebulette and nebulin are homologous proteins associated with the Z-lines of cardiac and skeletal muscle sarcomeres. Although these proteins share 70% sequence homology and an identical domain layout, nebulette is one-tenth the size of nebulin. To define structurally important features of these proteins in terms of the Z-line architecture, we have
2016-10-17 18:41:31	Ced	analyzed the primary structure of nebulette and nebulin from a variety of species and developmental stages. Alignment of the 35 residue nebulin-like modules from both proteins demonstrates that the individual modules share 30-90% homology across the six proteins analyzed. In addition, this analysis demonstrates a number of areas in which the identi
2016-10-17 18:41:31	Ced	ty across the six proteins is as high as 75%. These areas may be important signals for Z-line assembly and function in the striated muscles. Significantly, most of the areas of high identity also coincide with consensus phosphorylation sites. To evaluate if nebulette, like nebulin, exhibits tissue-specific and developmental specific polymorphism, a
2016-10-17 18:41:31	Ced	 series of immunoblot assays were performed. These data demonstrate that nebulettes from different portions of the heart are the same size. Comparison of nebulette from embryonic and adult cardiac muscle also demonstrates that this protein does not appear to vary in size with developmental stage. Consistent with the large number of consensus phosph
2016-10-17 18:41:31	Ced	orylation sites identified in the nebulette primary structure, we find that nebulette is phosphorylated in the cardiac muscle at serine and threonine residues. These data and sequence analyses are discussed in terms of current models for Z-line architecture.

2016-10-18 01:58:21	starsailor	iZ6S82: Well, you can always find another network if you don't like how this one is managed. The reason the round-robin is recommended, as opposed to individual servers, is so that if one fails, you just reconnect to another one, as opposed to always trying a server that isn't up anymore.
2016-10-18 01:58:23	MetaNova	it's also needless effort when the only list that matters is the only one you should be connecting to, which is conveniently accessible by one domain
2016-10-18 01:58:38	starsailor	iZ6S82: Round-robin is a common way to load balance networks.

2016-10-18 02:02:05	MetaNova	it's objectively the best overall solution to simply not have a second list which will, likely, often have inconsistencies

2016-10-18 02:02:19	moniker-	actually wondering why particular server isn't working is a legitimate question, but i doubt they would ask why whole network isnt working
2016-10-18 02:02:21	iZ6S82	for tor usesrs they should allow to create an account through tor (guess the hidden service) one tor ip per 6h should solve the coming problems
2016-10-18 02:02:27	starsailor	moniker-: Point is, it's all seamless if they used the R-R.

2016-10-18 02:09:30	WebUser192837	Well, nevermind. At least a redirect would've been useful, wouldn't it?

2016-10-18 03:16:08	starsailor	Aex12: And that is what you define in HexChat; a SOCKS5 proxy on localhost (127.0.0.1).
2016-10-18 03:16:09	Aex12	Will configure it

2016-10-18 03:16:24	starsailor	Aex12: But again, this is once you get SASL EXTERNAL running.
2016-10-18 03:16:36	Aex12	What is SASL External?
2016-10-18 03:16:36		[03:16]
2016-10-18 03:16:37	starsailor	If you try to connect to the hidden service without it, freenode will immediately kick you off.
2016-10-18 03:17:00	WebUser192837	Did anyone release some tool to create those certificates yet, or is the common advice still to use openssl?
2016-10-18 03:17:04	Fuchs	we are hoping to have more documentation on the whole Tor / extenral SASL thing up in a bit

2016-10-18 03:17:11	grawity	Aex12: it's like SASL PLAIN except instead of "here's my password" it's "use the certificate I just sent"
2016-10-18 03:17:23	Fuchs	WebUser192837: openssl works, there is a manual on OFTC that works well, plus as a pull request on our GitHub

2016-10-18 03:17:34	EvilRoey	hey so I sent a request yesterday for unbannation.. I accidentally copied-and-pasted too much of an article, and got k-lined as a result on my home IP
2016-10-18 03:17:35	EvilRoey	Fuchs: hi!
2016-10-18 03:17:40	Aex12	Ah ok
2016-10-18 03:17:44	starsailor	WebUser192837: It's just a one-line command in bash with openssl.
2016-10-18 03:17:45	Fuchs	EvilRoey: hi, what host?
2016-10-18 03:17:46	grawity	WebUser192837: Windows has at least two built in; there's OpenSSL; there's more on Lunix systems

2016-10-18 12:33:38	starsailor	DMBOWSKY: Newer versions of irssi support SASL out of the box, but you'd need to set up a certificate yourself. I find this tutorial to be very good: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/irssi#Client_certificates

2016-10-18 12:36:13	starsailor	DMBOWSKY: That's as far as SASL EXTERNAL is concerned. Now, for the Tor side, you'd need to have the Tor daemon running, make irssi connect via a SOCKS5 proxy to a specific port (9050 default) to localhost (127.0.0.1), and then connect to the hidden service.
2016-10-18 12:36:49	DMBOWSKY	starsailor: I'm using "torify irssi", and that works, too

This covers the physical evidence of the alleged gas chambers, alleged cremations, documentation and so called eyewitnesses, all in one package.

2016-10-19 14:34:40	EarthToAbigail	[22:47:02] am new to irc, still trying to figure out everything [22:47:02]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	idea_	[22:47:56] strange because mIRC worked, adiirc is failing to connect and hexchat x86 and x64 versions wouldn't even install [22:47:56]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	idea_	[22:48:07] I just don't want to pay for mIRC [22:48:07]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	kairin	[22:48:26] then don't [22:48:26]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	thumbs	[22:48:46] idea_: if hexchat can't be installed, you may have other issues with your OS [22:48:46]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	idea_	[22:49:17] I won't it's just odd that one client worked, but the other two had issues both of which I'd used not less than a month ago; now they're both failing to install, one is failing to resolve dns [22:49:17]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	idea_	[22:49:59] hexchat did install and work less than 3 months ago, adiirc worked a month ago [22:49:59]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	starsailor	[22:50:14] I have a feeling your whole OS installation may have become corrupt. [22:50:14]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	starsailor	[22:50:17] What Windows version is this? [22:50:17]

2016-10-19 14:34:40	idea_	[22:50:45] i need a fresh install really. [22:50:45]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	idea_	[22:51:24] just odd the pecularities I don't think are o.s. related rather I think some systems have been modified by another user ... (paranoid) ... [22:51:24]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	idea_	[22:51:35] any suggestions for a different free client? [22:51:35]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	idea_	[22:52:02] guess I'll go read some more forums if anyone doesn't have one off the top of their head [22:52:02]

I can remove that k-line, but if the same thing happens again (in this case, a broken client connecting and disconnecting repeatedly), it's gonna get k-lined again without an identd.

2016-10-19 20:40:05	Lorax	[04:23:53] github.com seems like the better choice for an open source community's project [04:23:53]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theFam	[04:24:07] Lorax: gitgud.io [04:24:07]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	FallingAlways	[04:24:08] what's the opinion on gitlab? [04:24:08]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theFam	[04:24:13] github.com is censorship-happy [04:24:13]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theFam	[04:24:31] FallingAlways: gitgud.io is a good instance of it [04:24:31]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theFam	[04:25:11] not to mention, iirc github software is proprietary, which is ironic since it's supposed to be a platform for releasing the code for projects [04:25:11]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	Lorax	[04:25:34] I think that project should be turned over to The Real gitgud [04:25:34]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	FallingAlways	[04:25:49] fact [04:25:49]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theFam	[04:26:01] i'd happily submit my code to gitgud [04:26:01]

2016-10-20 00:25:34	a2ns9qsj2odjwn	[10:05:58] we don't serve your kind here [10:05:58]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	Armand	[10:06:15] Are your parents related by blood ? [10:06:15]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	a2ns9qsj2odjwn	[10:06:19] Can someone get niko out? He's scaring me [10:06:19]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	a2ns9qsj2odjwn	[10:06:23] Armand: no [10:06:23]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	a2ns9qsj2odjwn	[10:06:33] they are related by fucking each other i think [10:06:33]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	Armand	[10:06:35] I'd say it warrants investigation. [10:06:35]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	a2ns9qsj2odjwn	[10:08:03] Armand: I'm not a brit [10:08:03]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	a2ns9qsj2odjwn	[10:08:06] no incest [10:08:06]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	Armand	[10:08:39] Actual evidence states that incest is far less common in the UK. [10:08:39]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	swarfega	[10:09:58] so thats your opinion of brits a2ns9qsj2odjwn? incest [10:09:58]

2016-10-20 00:25:34	Armand	[10:10:31] No, he just needs to slit his wrists. [10:10:31]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	swarfega	[10:10:32] its outlawed here [10:10:32]

2016-10-20 00:25:34	swarfega	[10:11:19] i worry for his parents [10:11:19]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	Armand	[10:11:23] I guess because daddy touched him like that, he thinks it ok. [10:11:23]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	swarfega	[10:11:34] what other lies are they telling him [10:11:34]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	Armand	[10:12:12] They probably tell him that pedobear is a role-model. [10:12:12]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	a2ns9qsj2odjwn	[10:12:13] swarfega: british royalty [10:12:13]

2016-10-20 00:25:34	a2ns9qsj2odjwn	[10:12:24] and aunts [10:12:24]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	swarfega	[10:12:28] uncles are not incest [10:12:28]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	a2ns9qsj2odjwn	[10:12:33] they also have mothers and fathers [10:12:33]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	a2ns9qsj2odjwn	[10:12:40] but the uncles are the fathers [10:12:40]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	swarfega	[10:12:44] what [10:12:44]

2016-10-20 00:25:34	a2ns9qsj2odjwn	[10:12:46] and the aunts are the mothers [10:12:46]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	Armand	[10:12:56] Seems his uncle touches him too. [10:12:56]
2016-10-20 00:25:34	a2ns9qsj2odjwn	[10:12:58] they fucked each other in the ass most of the time [10:12:58]

2016-10-20 02:25:01	MetaNova	none of your grouped nicks matter
2016-10-20 02:25:17	MetaNova	none of them possess any access

2016-10-20 04:39:26	waldo	I did NY cuz that was closest to me.  Dont copy what I did NOT_a_troll, you gotta find what works best for you based on ur needs
2016-10-20 04:39:29	Cypher-Punk	Xenogenesis - I'm talking about the VPS.
2016-10-20 04:39:39	waldo	NOT_a_troll: but DO monitors for malicious activity...don't do illegal shit with DO.
2016-10-20 04:39:45	starsailor	Cypher-Punk: Same; but in that case the VPS provider also has their own policies.
2016-10-20 04:39:58	waldo	DO allows tor relays last I checked.
2016-10-20 04:40:04	starsailor	Some don't want the Tor daemon running on any of their stuff, relay/bridge or whatever.
2016-10-20 04:40:07	Cypher-Punk	Yeah. I've been studying a list of tor-friendly VPS companies
2016-10-20 04:40:16	Xenogenesis	Cypher-Punk, virtualisation? It still exists?
2016-10-20 04:40:16	NOT_a_troll	waldo, if they find out malicious activity a.k.a hacking what do they do ?

2016-10-20 04:41:34	starsailor	Eh, if you use their VPS to hack other servers, that isn't merely an e-mail, they'll immediately kick you off and even report you to police.
2016-10-20 04:41:37	waldo	If DO just detects malicious stuff first u get a warning email.

2016-10-20 04:43:17	waldo	ud have to be naive to think they dont track that traffic.
2016-10-20 04:43:18	starsailor	I mean, it depends on what kind of pentesting. Even if you pentest your own server you paid for, and it's an aggressive kind of attack that hangs up an entire dedi server of theirs with a bunch of other VPS's on it, that could also mean they'd kick you off.
2016-10-20 04:43:34	waldo	starsailor: IDK, I did nmap scans etc. when i got the abuse

2016-10-20 04:45:18	starsailor	But they may blanket ban it anyway.
2016-10-20 04:45:20	starsailor	To cover themselves.

If anyone, you can tell staff about it if it's the same IP multiple times; but note that some clients may be trying to automatically use a nickname they have elsewhere. This is especially true if you have a common grouped nickname.

2016-10-20 05:17:55	waldo	so if I whois u i wont see ur IP

2016-10-20 13:45:43	roadcrap	i thought that it did that auto
2016-10-20 13:46:01	starsailor	Not here; Atheme is configured here such that enforce is not a default flag.
2016-10-20 13:46:03	Lorax	you need to set it in your account
2016-10-20 13:46:11	starsailor	Contrast that with HideMail, which is a default flag.

2016-10-20 13:46:13	starsailor	For example

2016-10-20 19:08:54	OMNIBUS	ok
2016-10-20 19:09:06	dax	hint: you can set it to a few years from now if you want
2016-10-20 19:09:10	gry	how do you use the external thing, what file do you need to create for it if any?
2016-10-20 19:09:14	dax	or 30 years, or whatever. it doesn't matter
2016-10-20 19:09:24	dax	gry: 1) set up certfp, 2) tell client to use SASL EXTERNAL, 3) done
2016-10-20 19:09:47	gry	cheers :)
2016-10-20 19:09:57	dax	the sasl external bit just tells the ircd to go deal with certfp before continuing connection

2016-10-21 12:08:29	Fuchs	SeepingN: that something  (usually a quiet or ban matching you, or the channel being +m) is preventing you from sending to that channel

2016-10-22 07:59:03	preaction	apple cobbler? that's not a cake though :p
2016-10-22 07:59:30	preaction	pie, obviously, is superior to cake, but they're radically different

2016-10-22 08:00:47	preaction	yes. flour, butter, egg
2016-10-22 08:00:53	moniker-	no egg in here

2016-10-23 08:23:48	Fuchs	gloomysunday: but most users doing that either just want to vent or expect us to act  (overriding the ban, removing the op, closing the channel and whatnot), and either doesn't work
2016-10-23 08:23:51	LjL	Fuchs, maybe sometimes one wants to vent without being "productive", and sometimes this seems an okay enough channel to do that since MUCH LESS productive things are left unacted upon

2016-10-23 20:12:10	latentprion	What's the procedure for doing this?

2016-10-23 20:13:35	latentprion	I guess there'd be some kind of authentication procedure?

2016-10-24 10:09:10	Skizzerz	derpherp128: you seem to be asking for another (not freenode) network, so I'm not sure what sort of help you're expecting here. Perhaps ask on the support channel for whatever ircd they use
2016-10-24 10:09:28	LjL	derpherp128, what would you gain by doing it anyway? is it for privacy? because people can tell what ISP you're using and roughly where you are even from the IP without the hostname
2016-10-24 10:09:34	starsailor	Well, this is more a general networking question, so maybe even ##networking could help.
2016-10-24 10:09:40	derpherp128	Skizzerz: it's a general IRC question
2016-10-24 10:09:45	Skizzerz	not really
2016-10-24 10:09:46	Welastevil	Thanks for the help!
2016-10-24 10:09:49	starsailor	That being said, who knows, maybe that ircd employs hostname mangling.
2016-10-24 10:09:50	LjL	yesreally
2016-10-24 10:09:55	Skizzerz	every ircd does hostmasks slightly differently

2016-10-24 10:10:05	Skizzerz	many have mangling in the form of +x
2016-10-24 10:10:13	Welastevil	but it seems to me that people at #vim are too boring and they dont ever answer me....
2016-10-24 10:10:16	starsailor	Right.
2016-10-24 10:10:20	Skizzerz	pretty much all of them use PTR to resolve hostnames, but if and how you can turn that off varies by ircd
2016-10-24 10:10:31	derpherp128	LjL: not privacy exactly
2016-10-24 10:10:38	Welastevil	Im trying some answers using /msg for some days
2016-10-24 10:10:40	Skizzerz	may not be possible, may be part of ircd config, may be a user mode
2016-10-24 10:10:43	derpherp128	i was just wondering if there was a way because of the "error" i had before

2016-10-24 10:11:28	Skizzerz	derpherp128: probably their DNS request for your PTR timed out so they displayed the IP instead
2016-10-24 10:11:31	starsailor	derpherp128: Chances are that was a temporary malfunction somewhere a DNS thing somewhere messed up, rather than a setting you tweak somewhere (other than directly turning off rDNS).

2016-10-24 16:01:43	kbdkode	not +mz? I have question about PREFIX from raw irc message ...
2016-10-24 16:02:11	emerson	sure
2016-10-24 16:02:29	kbdkode	I've noticed that the PREFIX (first thing in almost every message) is either ... nick!user@host or it's just some string of characters without a ! or @ in it.. What is the latter case? Are there any other cases I should be aware of?
2016-10-24 16:02:56	emerson	well, technically speaking the prefix is optional
2016-10-24 16:03:15	kbdkode	okie dokie. but sometimes it's like "services."

2016-10-24 16:03:44	emerson	yes, if it's there, it's either the server sending the notice, or the n!u@h of the client sending it

2016-10-24 16:04:06	emerson	and i think either PING or PONG

2016-10-24 17:32:10	kbdkode	if someone has a user name of "*!foobarbaz@*" (WITHOUT the ~ in front) and he/she log in using irccloud (one cannot use a cloak with this), am I right in assuming that this user name could be compromised .. meaning it's not like a host name .. sorry .. poorly phrased .. kinda tired

2016-10-24 17:35:57	kbdkode	if I set my user_name in irssi or user whatever in weechat and logged in. this is for non-authentated users .. it may seem strange but bot has auth system where one logs in with password and account name. but I was trying to figure out way to do it without that ...
2016-10-24 17:36:32	emerson	yea, you'll want to use account name for that, probably
2016-10-24 17:36:45	kbdkode	so I was trying to figure out a way to check user name or host name for people that don't have cloaks... and it's just not possible (I don't think) if you don't have a cloak
2016-10-24 17:36:48	dax	there's not really a sane way to uniquely identify an arbitrary un-identified user for authentication
2016-10-24 17:37:05	dax	if they have a nickserv account, use one of the various ways of getting that
2016-10-24 17:37:07	kbdkode	best way is to store has in file and then have them log in.
2016-10-24 17:37:13	dax	if not, hit them over the head until they get one

2016-10-24 17:37:47	dax	some gateways you can pin down to the gateway's account, yes
2016-10-24 17:37:53	kbdkode	oh jeez
2016-10-24 17:37:55	dax	cloak is irrelevant to what i just said
2016-10-24 17:38:02	kbdkode	oh jeez
2016-10-24 17:38:02	emerson	a cloak is not an account
2016-10-24 17:38:23	kbdkode	well no one (hopefully) has my cloak
2016-10-24 17:38:48	dax	would strongly recommend using accountname-based authentication instead of cloak-based authentication
2016-10-24 17:38:59	kbdkode	that's what I do.
2016-10-24 17:39:07	kbdkode	as I said I was trying to figure out way to not do that.
