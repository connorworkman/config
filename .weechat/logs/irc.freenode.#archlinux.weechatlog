2016-09-09 00:15:15	grawity	Earnestly: or git-annex virtual views

2016-09-09 00:15:51	grawity	thevishy: kinda doubt it
2016-09-09 00:16:01	thevishy	epub has some AI needed right?
2016-09-09 00:16:06	Earnestly	?
2016-09-09 00:16:09	thevishy	its not like simple format conversion - correct?
2016-09-09 00:16:11	Earnestly	It's just a zip file

2016-09-09 00:16:26	thevishy	converting a PDF to EPUB needs some Artificial Intelligence?

2016-09-09 00:17:01	Earnestly	thevishy: Unless you can accurately decode the pdf
2016-09-09 00:17:02	thevishy	so probably if I need to convert a PDF to Epub I probably work in chapter to chapter

2016-09-09 00:40:07	demize	It's not really big enough of a difference to matter the vast majority of times unless you have a tiny screen, and the page numbers and such are useful, and for the few times it might be useful you can just toggle it at run-time.

2016-09-09 00:57:21	xogium	orca 3.14 and you can't upgrade unless you go in testing repo, which just tend to break things, obviously
2016-09-09 00:57:42	BrainDamage	except debian witholds security patches if they break abi

2016-09-09 01:05:19	atralheaven	like breaking the system after updating, etc
2016-09-09 01:05:21	thevishy	but the thing is arch doesn't really need a complete re-installation

2016-09-09 01:05:34	thevishy	i have had very few issues as a desktop user
2016-09-09 01:05:35	xogium	atralheaven: only one in a year, and not a really major one.. I had to downgrade the kernel to a previous version for a couple of days
2016-09-09 01:06:21	xogium	system was usable in a way, but doing pacman stuff, downloading with curl or wget had tendency to freeze my terminal

2016-09-09 03:46:50	EEVV	thanks, thurstylark, grawity.
2016-09-09 03:46:57	thurstylark	MacGyver: ehh, I was hoping it was something more related to the "No keys for makepkg" problem, than the auto retrieve thing...

2016-09-09 03:47:44	thurstylark	EEVV: just remember that sudo means "substitute user do" and root has a different home than you. That's why that happened.

2016-09-09 03:49:53	EEVV	is it like RSA?
2016-09-09 03:49:55	MacGyver	grawity: Okay, but then there's the additional issue that auto-key-retrieve is not being limited to makepkg usage here.
2016-09-09 03:49:59	grawity	EEVV: also for encryption, but with packages usually for signing
2016-09-09 03:50:17	EEVV	grawity, how does that work? Can't I just "fake" sign something?
2016-09-09 03:50:18	grawity	EEVV: typically RSA, sometimes DSA/ECDSA/EdDSA
2016-09-09 03:50:21	grawity	EEVV: no, you can't

2016-09-09 12:05:25	somekool	hello,... I'm trying to find what is currently starts my ssh-agent and my gpg-agent, I don't remember setting them up, so it must be by default. when looking at the archlinux wiki, it shows different ways to set it up, but does not mention about what would be the default. I want to load gpg-agent using systemd and have gpg-agent replace my ssh-agent,. but I'd like to remove the existing way before adding the new one ... 
2016-09-09 12:05:27	somekool	anyone could help ? I believe my archlinux system is quite standard.

2016-09-09 15:43:15	yaymuffins	you can fix that easily
2016-09-09 15:43:28	Erayaydin	Can I install also normal grub(without uefi, legacy)

2016-09-09 16:59:10	Sapphirus	It's quite popular hehe
2016-09-09 16:59:22	Raku	Basically they use an old way of managing addons, and rather than fix it or use something newer, they just made it so you have to sign them
2016-09-09 16:59:50	Raku	sorin-mihai, It's temporary data that goes nowhere, in what way would it be abused?
2016-09-09 17:00:01	Sapphirus	I'd rather that they fix it whilst keeping the functionality I take most for granted.
2016-09-09 17:00:18	Sapphirus	That'll never happen, and I'll eventually be a chromium user in the end.

2016-09-09 23:35:43	MrElendig	it is actually worse for btrfs

2016-09-10 02:15:06	DavidTWco	Hey. I've been in here before because I was having issues booting. Found that the boot partition was getting corrupted. If I fsck'd the boot partition and remounted it then I could reinstall the kernel. Wasn't ever able to figure out what was causing the dirty bit to be set on the partition. Today I've just noticed that just doing umount then mount on the partition makes it corrupt. Any idea what's up?
2016-09-10 02:15:27	easo2k	if hitler had won he would dominate the whole world. why are hitler fans in the US i dont get it
2016-09-10 02:15:43	DavidTWco	It hasn't always happened with the system. Started a few weeks ago and I've been mitigating by doing fsck, umount then mount every day until I had time to investigate.

However if I remove the arch drive, the boot entries are cleared from NVRAM. However I figured that if I copied EFI/boot/grub/grubx64.efi to EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.EFI (according to the spec) then the motherboard would try to boot that by default if there were no other entries. The motherboard is apparently failing to boot arch, any

2016-09-10 07:15:29	Shapeshifter	The EFI partition was created by the windows 10 installer. I'm migrating an existing linux install to the same hardware. So I still have my old /boot partition.

2016-09-10 07:16:22	Shapeshifter	because mkinitcpio -p linux doesn't work ("specified kernel image does not exist: '/boot/initramfs-linux.img'. Should I just copy it over from the old /boot partition?

2016-09-10 12:22:31	dviola	popipo: LFS is for sure a great learning experience, and I'd probably do it again on a VM when I have the time... back then I was using Slackware and I wanted to get rid of packages I didn't need on Slackware, so I found LFS and that allowed me for a lot of freedom in building a small system
2016-09-10 12:22:31	Earnestly	Literally no human factor, or sane design

2016-09-10 12:22:31	Earnestly	dviola: I wouldn't say LFS is very good for learning
2016-09-10 12:22:31	Earnestly	raijin: Neither does spacex, so far
2016-09-10 12:23:24	nejni-marji	I accidentally deleted /root/.gnupg and everything went to hell, is there a way to fix it?
2016-09-10 12:23:24	dviola	popipo: but then as I started using actually my OS for a lot more (work, etc) I find life without a package manager is a bit hard
2016-09-10 12:23:24	Earnestly	NASA did reuse rockets though
2016-09-10 12:23:24	Earnestly	And it is the most expensive launch vehicle
2016-09-10 12:23:24	popipo	dviola: thanks for the feedback. I will try LFS sometime in the future (over the summer probably)

2016-09-10 12:25:13	popipo	not entirely of course, but enough to use package manager

2016-09-10 15:41:29	poisonby	Local network transfers are fast
2016-09-10 15:41:45	Chris_Thorndyke	poisonby, I don't. I want to upload my OWN arch ISO
2016-09-10 15:41:53	Chris_Thorndyke	with my own software in it - my own distro...
2016-09-10 15:41:57	Renf	Sure, but why?
2016-09-10 15:42:11	Chris_Thorndyke	Renf: so people can use it? xD
2016-09-10 15:42:27	Chris_Thorndyke	poisonby, not through teamviewer
2016-09-10 15:42:32	Chris_Thorndyke	it's gotta go through their servers first
2016-09-10 15:42:43	poisonby	Chris_Thorndyke: So why are you talking about 700MB? Once you're done with your iso, it will far exceed that number
2016-09-10 15:42:45	Chris_Thorndyke	and I don't feel like setting up a proper network share from my tablet
2016-09-10 15:42:52	poisonby	Chris_Thorndyke: Then don't use teamviewer......

Then you compare its fingerprint against a listed fingerprint you know is authentic.  The crux is being able to have a known authentic fingerprint to compare against.  Otherwise you can't really be sure of authenticity.

2016-09-11 00:57:18	Harm133	Hey guys, I'm having an issue with wine/gdm/bungie-desktop. I have a dual monitor setup, and the physical right monitor is my main display. However, when I run wine on my primary display it does render everything on there, but my mouse region is locked to my secondary display. I have setup the monitors in such a way that the physical location is virtually swapped. If I remap that to their original location I have no issues. Any

2016-09-11 03:03:51	jA_cOp	FEL, what do you mean by "detect"? Maybe the boot order just changed?

I appreciate the apps that run flawlessly on the local system libs with the runtime disabled. Especially if they know when you have dualshock or an xbox controller and display the appropriate button prompts.

2016-09-11 11:52:07	gunsBruce	Hello,  I'm a bit of a newb so I hope i've got the terminology correct, I'm trying to automate yakuake session startups with qdbus, mostly going well but how can I get a 'terminalId' for the right split of the pane in a single session? I've tried (amongst other methods)    "qdbus org.kde.yakuake /yakuake/sessions org.kde.yakuake.terminalIdsForSessionId $THIS_SESSION_ID"    This gives me a     "No 
2016-09-11 11:52:13	gunsBruce	such method 'terminalIdsForSessionId' in interface 'org.kde.yakuake' at object path '/yakuake/sessions' (signature '')"     it seems to be listed there though?...

2016-09-11 11:53:42	Caretaker13	Strange... using arch x86-64. tevent 0.9.30-1 shows installed 9-10-2016, as dependency. But only current tevent is 0.9.29-2, in "extra" repo. note, pacaur -Ss shows lib32-tevent 0.9.30-1 in AUR, but not in pacaur -Q. I run x86-64, with no known 32-bit libs. So where did tevent 0.9.30-1 come from? Is it fake? Should I downgrade to tevent 0.9.29-2? 
2016-09-11 11:54:21	sheep	Caretaker13: it was upgraded then downgraded due to an incompatibility with samba. if you use samba, downgrade it

2016-09-11 20:17:19	pingfloyd	anti-aliasing makes edges look less pixelated by averaging the colors in between

2016-09-12 07:42:15	DaVinci	MacGyver: Changing from AC97 to IntelHD does seem to let it play more often. Totally segfaults the machine sometimes, but does play. The mystery deepens. Why is the audio pipeline binding up?

2016-09-12 07:47:42	d_garbage	a lot if not most of Arch seems to me to use the 'one simple trick'™ of giving the user the information and letting them decide. Not only does it cut out a lot of dodgy automation or hidden configurations it make less work for the devs. It amazes me that so many people think this is somehow a bad idea (like most of the Arch spins and forks seem to) *shrug*

2016-09-12 08:32:33	teh_lemon	Hello. There is a specific site that I'm trying to log into with Python (uses system ca cert list). I'm getting a cert error when I send the proper password in a POST request, and I get no error when I send a wrong password. Doesn't happen in Chrome, and doesn't happen on a debian box, yet it happens on a friends' Arch as well. Tried getting a different ca cert file, no avail.

2016-09-12 10:19:30	Earnestly	Togusa: People made the terrible mistake of confusing modualrity with reuse, where reuse is the killer
2016-09-12 10:19:34	DukeCeph	Togusa: you... have to fight against good code?

2016-09-12 10:19:43	robert_	Namarrgon: I'm trying to do 32-bit OS dev on Arch64, and I'm writing tools that will help me do it. :p
2016-09-12 10:20:05	Togusa	which is not testable because it's not been written in a modular (i.e. OOP) way (aka: you don't need to use the 'class' keyword to create OOP and modular code)
2016-09-12 10:20:12	Namarrgon	robert_: "OS dev"?
2016-09-12 10:20:20	Earnestly	modular has nothing to do with OOP as it predates it

2016-09-12 10:21:05	Togusa	using classes everywhere is just plain stupid.. just as stupid as completely refusing to use them for no reason
2016-09-12 10:21:13	Earnestly	Togusa: But perhaps you're more interested in Alan Kay's definition of OOP?  Then Erlang comes close, and Joe Armstrong certainly has nothing kind to say about the 90s OOP mentality that infected everything, even prolog

2016-09-12 10:26:11	Togusa	yeah, because passing transparent structures around functions is a better solution

I installed ubuntu on a flash, live booted and the hdd is live and healthy. So I went to the fstab and found duplicate entries. I commented out the duplicates but no dice

2016-09-12 15:02:46	demonicm1niac3	mueslo: the main point to take away here is that if you look at the IA cores package power for frequency and no the cpu package power or the gt cores power you can see that the i7 is at an average of 23.3w for 2.6ghz whereas the i5 is at 21.7w for the 2.7ghz 
2016-09-12 15:03:09	demonicm1niac3	mueslo: i did say it's not much and just a bit - but it does use more power for less frequency for the cpu cores part only

2016-09-12 15:04:20	demonicm1niac3	mueslo: the i7 there throttles due to thermals with the nvidia doing the gpu lifting and thus not actually hitting the 35w cpu package power, the i5 hits the package power and also thermal throttles with the igp used and taking part of the package power. but if you don't do actual heavy gpu load as you said it's probably fine using the intel integrated only

2016-09-12 20:56:23	g3ntleman	no I wouldnt
2016-09-12 20:56:25	Lartza	g3ntleman, Read the XyProblem, the problem is that you might be asking the wrong question, like for instance why are you even downgrading in the first place
2016-09-12 20:56:29	g3ntleman	because I am runing them for months
2016-09-12 20:56:30	grawity	g3ntleman: how would I know that
2016-09-12 20:56:40	grawity	g3ntleman: you're not the first one
2016-09-12 20:56:40	g3ntleman	I just thought maybe there is a flag or something for pacman to do it
2016-09-12 20:56:43	demize	Hmm, OpenMCT for KSP would be cool.
2016-09-12 20:56:52	grawity	speak: it *should* in theory automatically use pinentry-curses over SSH
2016-09-12 20:56:59	g3ntleman	Lartza: why do you care why am I downgrading? I have to downgrade ffs
2016-09-12 20:57:00	speak	demize: Ah right, then the "why" would have to directed at whoever did the arch packaging
2016-09-12 20:57:08	speak	Interesting grawity 
2016-09-12 20:57:12	grawity	speak: but, I guess, it's pinentry being an arsehat and requiring GPG_TTY=$(tty) to be exported
2016-09-12 20:57:16	grawity	speak: check if that helps
2016-09-12 20:57:17	Lartza	g3ntleman, Because it's unsupported and leads to breakage and there might be an alternative correct way...
2016-09-12 20:57:28	DryEagle	it's ok, found what i needed with some grepping
2016-09-12 20:57:35	demize	pinentry is such scary garbage.

2016-09-12 20:58:15	grawity	speak: there's also pinentry-tty, nicer than the fullscreen -curses one
2016-09-12 20:58:15	g3ntleman	oook
2016-09-12 20:58:43	demize	And people that know how to make sure that their downgraded package works properly would also be able to find it in the manpage themselves. >.>
2016-09-12 20:58:47	grawity	speak: and there's the "loopback" pinentry mode which avoids external pinentry entirely (but IMHO pinentry-tty is better)
2016-09-12 20:58:48	g3ntleman	so let me ask a good question, I followed archwikis php-cgi config, but I am getting 501, I am not even sure how to debug this, before I used modphp, but I want cgi
2016-09-12 20:58:58	speak	Cool grawity, -tty version it is!

2016-09-12 21:00:00	demize	And then it gets deadlocked somehow.
2016-09-12 21:00:02	Lartza	g3ntleman, Why not php-fpm?
2016-09-12 21:00:09	grawity	g3ntleman: 503 miiight mean it cannot spawn the cgi

Any clarification regarding this would be appreciated. Thanks.

It seems to mount the folder correctly, but when I cd to it, there is nothing in it, while there are actually folders and files in it. If I manually mount the folder again, it works, but I want it to be automounted on boot!

2016-09-13 06:00:54	siphr	Earnestly: fair enough, So I've been trying to get pulseaudio to set my btheadset as a default-sink + other settings using udev. This requires that I create my own script, which I did, lo and behold I found that root cannot use pulseaudio directly so I sudo for pactl to get some ids and the sudo to setup default sinks and sources.

I checked /etc/fstab and the file does not even contain the line to mount the root logical volume. How would i go about mounting my home logical volume to /home so it remains after reboot?

Invocation of java and other binaries will rely on this Java install." This could be interpreted to mean that java programs rely on jre7. But a more likely interpetation is that java programs will use whatever jre I choose to set.

2016-09-13 17:09:52	omnigoat	sighhhhhhhh. After=network-online.target and Wants=network-online.target do absolutely nothing. how is it that on Debian 8 (which uses systemd as far as I can tell) anything in rc.local gets executed right after the network is actually up but doing the same in "pure" systemd setup seems impossible.

2016-09-13 17:11:09	sheep	omnigoat: it's not impossible. you just need a network management service that doesn't actually register as being up until it has an established connection. if you use systemd-networkd, you can accomplish this by enabling systemd-networkd-wait-online.service

2016-09-14 03:28:40	L0g4nAd4ms	MacGyver, maybe its classified as "experimental" in the kernel but its still better performing than radeon on my hawaii card.
2016-09-14 03:28:47	donbex	pid1: the problem is that Cloudef stopped maintaining it and it doesn't compile anymore

I need to login to xfce (using lightdm) to login to the session and only then pulseaudio starts. I could think of an autologin of the user (security risk?). Is there any other way to start pulseaudio by default to achieve that its available via network?

2016-09-14 14:48:32	sheep	is that a user unit or a system unit?
2016-09-14 14:48:46	victoroux	user, i made it myself
2016-09-14 14:48:54	victoroux	shall i share those as well?
2016-09-14 14:48:55	sheep	no, it's system.
2016-09-14 14:49:14	victoroux	oh, i'm new to systemd -- i figured since i wrote it it'd be user
2016-09-14 14:49:18	sheep	/etc/systemd/system has system units. you want to put it in a user directory
2016-09-14 14:49:33	victoroux	well i figured anyone on the system can use this unit, so i put it in the former
2016-09-14 14:49:40	sheep	also, does this need access to an X server? if so, you need to export the DISPLAY environment variable for it
2016-09-14 14:49:42	victoroux	but since it is my user name in ther,e i'll move it haha
2016-09-14 14:49:59	sheep	you could make it a user unit and it would still be available to all users
2016-09-14 14:50:16	sheep	but it should run per-user rather than system-wide
2016-09-14 14:50:21	victoroux	oh i see
2016-09-14 14:50:32	sheep	what does this service do?
2016-09-14 14:51:02	victoroux	it reads a file that has xprintidle in it, if it's over 30s it tells another script to turn off the display
2016-09-14 14:51:11	victoroux	the script itself shouldn't require x server, right?
2016-09-14 14:51:15	victoroux	if it's calling other scripts
2016-09-14 14:51:18	victoroux	idk..
2016-09-14 14:51:29	sheep	how does the other script turn off the display?
2016-09-14 14:51:34	victoroux	xset s activate
2016-09-14 14:51:40	sheep	that needs X
2016-09-14 14:51:44	victoroux	yea, the child script does

2016-09-14 14:52:15	sheep	something has to pass the DISPLAY variable to the child, or it has to have some way to determine it
2016-09-14 14:52:29	RudyValencia	blackslab, alyptik: AD-synced users don't get a DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS, XDG_RUNTIME_DIR or XDG_SESSION_ID and these seem to be what keeps AD users from signing in
2016-09-14 14:52:41	sheep	it might make more sense to start the script in the background from your ~/.xinitrc or ~/.xprofile since it needs X context to run
2016-09-14 14:52:42	victoroux	i've added DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY environment variables and it's the same message

2016-09-14 15:43:22	RudyValencia	So I'm still trying to set up active directory login via SSSD, and I have it working for console and ssh login but X login fails with an error like "Failed to connect to socket /tmp/dbus-XCSaPG3RDn: Connection refused". Local users are able to log in on the console, via ssh and via X. Why could this be happening and how do I resolve it?

Say I want to make a PKGBUILD which supports python3 and python2; I frequently see “makedepends=('python', 'python-setuptools', 'python2', 'python2-setuptools'), together with a build() and package_...() for both versions. But doesn't this mean that when I set the makedepends of the python2-PKG to python3?

2016-09-15 05:41:04	MacGyver	You may need to change the way a deletion is handled.
2016-09-15 05:41:25	MacGyver	I.e. instead of deleting the file and propagating to gmail, you have to use IMAP deletion mechanisms explicitly.
2016-09-15 05:41:45	MacGyver	So flag for deletion, then purge.
2016-09-15 05:42:08	MacGyver	https://support.google.com/mail/answer/78892?hl=en implies that.
