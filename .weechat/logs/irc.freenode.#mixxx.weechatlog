2016-09-09 09:50:49	be_	no
2016-09-09 09:51:02	be_	It's HID class compliant, so it can be done
2016-09-09 09:57:00		[09:51]
2016-09-09 10:00:49	Fohlen	be_: lovely, now it work's just fine, thank you!
2016-09-09 10:01:11	be_	:)
2016-09-09 10:01:19	Fohlen	just one more question: you said I might skip the timecoding when using usb/digital processing and I didn't yet find any paper about that
2016-09-09 10:01:24	Fohlen	can you tell me more? :o
2016-09-09 10:01:38	wrl	be_: cool, i have one coming in the mail and i've already reverse engineered several other NI products ;)
2016-09-09 10:01:49	be_	oh really?
2016-09-09 10:01:51	wrl	be_: do you have any docs for how I would go about doing a mixxx binding?
2016-09-09 10:01:56	be_	kinda
2016-09-09 10:02:10	Fohlen	ah, and should I connect my output to the controller or to the computer? Does it make a difference? (I have an external sound card for the computer, so that work's as well)
2016-09-09 10:02:11	be_	http://mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/start#controller_mapping_documentation
2016-09-09 10:02:12	wrl	be_: https://github.com/wrl/maschine.rs, and i wrote the snd-usb-caiaq maschine mk1 handling
2016-09-09 10:02:21	be_	oh nice
2016-09-09 10:02:38	be_	I was using the original Kore with snd-usb-caiaq for a while
2016-09-09 10:02:50	wrl	yeah i had some early hardware for it too
2016-09-09 10:02:58	wrl	whatever their first 4/4 dj interface was
2016-09-09 10:03:03	wrl	 basically let me know how i can do this for mixxx and i'll pitch in
2016-09-09 10:03:17	be_	Fohlen: trust your ears. Use whichever one sounds better.
2016-09-09 10:03:33	Fohlen	be_: alrighty
2016-09-09 10:03:46	be_	wrl: the HID documentation is lacking, but there's a little info
2016-09-09 10:04:06	be_	but if you're comfortable reverse engineering hardware, I think you'll be able to learn from the existing HID mappings
2016-09-09 10:04:21	be_	do you happen to have a Kontrol S4 Mk2?
2016-09-09 10:04:42	wrl	i do not. i could look into borrowing one but even that's not 100% certain
2016-09-09 10:05:08	be_	that would be cool if you could. Someone borrowed one and started an HID mapping but there are still a few things left unfinished
2016-09-09 10:06:04	be_	there's also a Kontrol F1 HID mapping started, but I don't think it's really mapped to anything and more of a template for how it could be set up
2016-09-09 10:06:30	be_	because Mixxx doesn't have many of the features the F1 is made to work with
2016-09-09 10:07:53	wrl	afaik nobody's figured out the screens on any of the NI gear yet
2016-09-09 10:07:57	wrl	well, the rgb screens at least
2016-09-09 10:08:31	be_	yeah don't think so
2016-09-09 10:08:40	be_	Mixxx also doesn't have any API for sending waveform data to controllers
2016-09-09 10:09:01	wrl	yeah :/
2016-09-09 10:09:03	be_	I wonder if the screens use HID or some proprietary protocol
2016-09-09 10:09:58	wrl	i think they're HID
2016-09-09 10:10:16	be_	hmm I think you're right
2016-09-09 10:10:17	be_	https://support.native-instruments.com/hc/en-us/articles/210293705
2016-09-09 10:10:45	wrl	be_: do you have any links to the existing mixxx HID bindings?
2016-09-09 10:10:47	wrl	just as an example
2016-09-09 10:10:59	be_	they're included with Mixxx
2016-09-09 10:11:17	be_	 /usr/share/mixxx/controllers is probably where you have them
2016-09-09 10:15:08	wrl	found a few
2016-09-09 10:15:08		[10:15]
2016-09-09 10:15:12	wrl	oh boy, javascript ;)
2016-09-09 10:15:15	be_	yup
2016-09-09 10:15:20	be_	it's weird
2016-09-09 10:15:55	be_	do you have experience with JS?
2016-09-09 10:16:01	wrl	unfortunately, yes.
2016-09-09 10:16:09	be_	lol
2016-09-09 10:17:47	be_	btw do you know if the Z2 is an analog or digital mixer?
2016-09-09 10:17:51	be_	I think it's digital but I'm not sure
2016-09-09 10:19:09	wrl	I...don't know.
2016-09-09 10:19:23	wrl	if the faders send data via HID i'll say digital
2016-09-09 10:19:29	wrl	if they don't, still anybody's game
2016-09-09 10:19:54	be_	that doesn't matter for how it's mixed
2016-09-09 10:19:59	wrl	well, no
2016-09-09 10:20:14	wrl	but if it was digital i think they'd have some communication there
2016-09-09 10:20:24	be_	most mixers with built in sound cards are digital mixers
2016-09-09 10:20:29	wrl	yeah
2016-09-09 10:20:33	be_	but there are some analog mixers that have a ADC in them
2016-09-09 10:21:11	wrl	and i've definitely owned a mixer i thought was analog but turned out to be digital
2016-09-09 10:21:14	wrl	(ecler nuo3)
2016-09-09 10:22:51	be_	err analog mixers with a DAC, not an ADC
2016-09-09 10:26:23	be_	be sure to read the http://mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/contributing_mappings page
2016-09-09 10:31:02	be_	Fohlen: oh sorry I didn't see your question about timecode
2016-09-09 10:31:02		[10:31]
2016-09-09 10:32:07	be_	if you were asking which sound card to use for timecode input, the sound quality of the input doesn't matter much
2016-09-09 10:32:15	be_	the latency does though
2016-09-09 10:32:15	Fohlen	be_: no hurry there! I've got the phonograph on Source 1 with line (normal chinch cabels), I can just fine see it in vinyl control, but actually I don't hear any sound from it (a bit strange)
2016-09-09 10:32:55	be_	for output, use whatever sounds best
2016-09-09 10:33:12	<--	_rgb_ (~rgb@173.227.65.138) has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
2016-09-09 10:33:39	be_	what I meant before regarding connecting your turntable is that you could just use the turntable's USB sound card for timecode input
2016-09-09 10:33:57	Fohlen	be_: mhm
2016-09-09 10:34:16	be_	I'm not sure if there would be an issues with using multiple sound cards for in and out though
2016-09-09 10:34:24	Fohlen	be_: I don't have any control options (all I see is signal quality)?
2016-09-09 10:34:38	be_	what skin are you using?
2016-09-09 10:34:51	be_	Unfortunately the version of Deere released in 2.0 is lacking vinyl control options :/
2016-09-09 10:35:11	be_	that's been fixed since
2016-09-09 10:35:33	Fohlen	be_: hehe, I'm using Deere
2016-09-09 10:36:48	be_	you could download the version of Deere in git master and use that
2016-09-09 10:36:49	be_	https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/archive/master.zip
2016-09-09 10:36:59	be_	it's in the res/skins folder
2016-09-09 10:37:26	be_	remove your /usr/share/mixxx/skins/Deere directory and replace it with Deere from that ZIP
2016-09-09 10:37:55	be_	AFAIK no changes have been made to the skin engine since 2.0, so I'm pretty sure it should work fine
2016-09-09 10:38:21	Fohlen	be_: my issue is that I actually don't hear any sound from the source1/vinyl
2016-09-09 10:38:40	be_	you don't want to hear timecode :P
2016-09-09 10:38:54	Fohlen	be_: yeah, but I don't hear my vinyl as well
2016-09-09 10:38:55	Fohlen	:D
2016-09-09 10:38:58	be_	oh
2016-09-09 10:39:03	be_	that's what the passthrough option is for
2016-09-09 10:39:13	be_	which is accessible in LateNight
2016-09-09 10:39:21	be_	and I believe in the updated Deere
2016-09-09 10:40:13	Fohlen	be_: derp, still don't see anything (in the settings tab)
2016-09-09 10:40:43	Fohlen	be_: I am with  2.0.0 (build 1.12 r5772) but I might try another version if that's better?
2016-09-09 10:43:24	be_	you don't need to compile Mixxx yourself to use the updated Deere skin
2016-09-09 10:43:48	be_	just need to put the skin in /usr/share/mixxx/skins
2016-09-09 10:44:17	Fohlen	be_: but the tab doesn't show up in settings even when I switch the templates :o
2016-09-09 10:46:06	be_	in the settings menu of the updated Deere version, there's an option
2016-09-09 10:46:06		[10:46]
2016-09-09 10:46:15	be_	"Show Vinyl Control Options"
2016-09-09 10:46:31	be_	or select the option in the View menu
2016-09-09 10:48:53	be_	when that is selected, vinyl control buttons will show next to the waveforms
2016-09-09 10:50:44	Fohlen	be_: didn't update the settings, but the tipp with the view works
2016-09-09 10:50:45	Fohlen	lovely :)
2016-09-09 10:53:20	Fohlen	be_: uhhh
2016-09-09 10:53:26	Fohlen	I guess it won't work without a timecode
2016-09-09 10:53:35	Fohlen	I'll have a look maybe someone here has it :)
2016-09-09 10:53:42	be_	what do you mean?
2016-09-09 10:55:59	Fohlen	be_: even using digital input (with the soundcard of the usb vinyl) it's still more than terrible
2016-09-09 10:56:05	Fohlen	(passing direct sound)
2016-09-09 10:56:16	be_	oh
2016-09-09 10:56:39	be_	have you tried plugging it into your RMX?
2016-09-09 10:56:52	Fohlen	be_: yes
2016-09-09 10:56:55	Fohlen	that was even worse
2016-09-09 10:56:55	Fohlen	:D
2016-09-09 10:57:00	be_	yikes
2016-09-09 10:57:12	Fohlen	so USB cable / with vinyl soundcard is a bit better
2016-09-09 10:57:17	Fohlen	but still really horrible
2016-09-09 10:57:32	be_	well then I'd recommend just using that for timecode
2016-09-09 10:57:46	be_	unfortunately
2016-09-09 10:58:16	be_	nothing Mixxx can do to magically improve a bad sound card
2016-09-09 10:59:04	Fohlen	be_: yup, but thanks for the idea :)
2016-09-09 10:59:38	Fohlen	be_: unfortanly the looping buttons (and now I have 16 of them!) are not bound, but thats more or less something I can stand
2016-09-09 10:59:41	be_	good sound cards for vinyl probably cost more than the RMX
2016-09-09 10:59:45	Fohlen	HDI works :)
2016-09-09 11:00:05	Fohlen	gotta add them to mixxx manually
2016-09-09 11:00:07	Fohlen	be_: yikes
2016-09-09 11:00:17	Fohlen	the vinyl (in original) costed like 60 euros
2016-09-09 11:00:17	Fohlen	so
2016-09-09 11:00:20	Fohlen	that's nothing.
2016-09-09 11:00:23	Fohlen	what'd ya expect :D
2016-09-09 11:01:08	be_	the Denon DS1 and Traktor Scratch A6 both cost $300
2016-09-09 11:01:08		[11:01]
2016-09-09 11:01:14	be_	(I don't know about Euros)
2016-09-09 11:02:07	Fohlen	be_: uhhhh. I am a realllllyyy newcomer in the area (I used to mixxx with 2 vinyl's and analogue mixer + effect generator beforehand) and so I didn't want to start out with such expensive gadgets
2016-09-09 11:02:20	be_	understandable
2016-09-09 11:02:35	be_	if you want to digitize your vinyl collection, I'd recommend getting one of those
2016-09-09 11:02:48	be_	or use passthrough
2016-09-09 11:03:23	Fohlen	be_: but luckily we have a 15k $ sound system that's hand-build in our house, so if I want to test a set live I don't have to buy all that equipment as well
2016-09-09 11:03:23	Fohlen	:D
2016-09-09 11:03:41	be_	nice
2016-09-09 11:04:22	Fohlen	be_: just in case, I am seeking for an amplifier, anything affordable (and usable) within the range of 80-120 euro?
2016-09-09 11:04:34	Fohlen	since everything I saw was more like big shit.
2016-09-09 11:04:36	Fohlen	:/
2016-09-09 11:04:40	be_	I don't think so
2016-09-09 11:04:54	be_	I'm pretty sure any amplifier that cheap would sound awful
2016-09-09 11:05:31	be_	do you mean a PA amplifier or home theater/stereo amplifier?
2016-09-09 11:06:16	Fohlen	be_: second
2016-09-09 11:07:14	Fohlen	be_: there's few on ebay but you gotta be extremly lucky

2016-09-09 11:16:55	Fohlen	woah.
2016-09-09 11:17:01	Fohlen	:D
2016-09-09 11:17:33	be_	what do you mean?
2016-09-09 11:17:45	be_	you probably shouldn't be touching the master gain in Mixxx
2016-09-09 11:18:47	Fohlen	be_: yup

2016-09-09 11:19:19	Fohlen	be_: I tried out analog vs digital (sound card vs line @ the controller) and the controller greatly improves audio quality :)
2016-09-09 11:20:01	be_	what's that other sound card you have?
2016-09-09 11:22:33	Fohlen	be_: it's some Startech external USB card but I don't remember exactly which one
2016-09-09 11:23:06	be_	yeah I wouldn't expect much from a $30 sound card
2016-09-09 11:23:48	Fohlen	be_: exactly
2016-09-09 11:25:40	be_	adjust master gain on the sound card or amplifier, not in Mixxx
2016-09-09 11:25:41	be_	http://mixxx.org/manual/latest/chapters/user_interface.html#interface-gain-knob
2016-09-09 11:27:15	Fohlen	be_: I don't have an amplifier at the moment, that's why I do that shity setup
2016-09-09 11:27:18	Fohlen	but for live, ofcourse
2016-09-09 11:33:00		[11:27]
2016-09-09 12:12:16	Fohlen	be_: huh. this is funny ... since I don't use an amplifier I can actually hear the reflux of distinctive pulses (bass) in my headphones (which sit at the computer soundcard)
2016-09-09 12:12:16		[12:12]
2016-09-09 12:12:47	be_	why aren't you plugging your headphones into your RMX?
2016-09-09 12:14:17	Fohlen	be_: yup
2016-09-09 12:14:28	Fohlen	just wanted to test how good the internal card would be
2016-09-09 12:14:32	be_	oh
2016-09-09 12:14:33	Fohlen	it's not good, as we see
2016-09-09 12:14:33	Fohlen	:D
2016-09-09 12:14:34	be_	it's not
2016-09-09 12:14:51	be_	no onboard sound cards are good
2016-09-09 12:15:11	be_	some are worse than others, but none are good
2016-09-09 12:16:09	Fohlen	be_: thanks for all the input so far! I will report to you how the timecode/setup works (once I did that)
2016-09-09 12:16:39	Fohlen	off for now :)

2016-09-11 05:33:35	be_	do you have the input configured as a vinyl control input?
2016-09-11 05:33:47	be_	and you're turning on passthrough mode?
2016-09-11 05:37:06	Fohlen	be_: indeed
2016-09-11 05:37:24	be_	what's not working? Are you just not hearing anything?
2016-09-11 05:37:49	Fohlen	be_: if I just want to play records (without timecode), how'd I troubleshoot my bad connection?
2016-09-11 05:37:52	Fohlen	I do but the signal quality is horrible
2016-09-11 05:38:56	Fohlen	be_: uh. I needed constant mode!
2016-09-11 05:40:06	be_	is your turntable grounded to the RMX?
2016-09-11 05:40:56	be_	does the output level of your turntable match the input of the RMX (phono/line)?
2016-09-11 05:42:16	Fohlen	be_: I switched to phono
2016-09-11 05:42:32	Fohlen	unfortanly that model doesn't have a ground cable by default, gotta manually add one

2016-09-11 09:25:23	Tempest_	Need some help... when I try to the dropdown box to select my microphone it isn't there.  I get "there is no input device selected.... well I can't select my mic if its not there...help!
2016-09-11 09:27:56	be_	what sound card are you using?
2016-09-11 09:27:57	Tempest_	wondering if i need to use a USB model headset?  I have the 2 plug in right now, mic and earphones
2016-09-11 09:28:41	Tempest_	not to sure how to find out that info.  can u direct me to where I can find that?  I appreciate the help
2016-09-11 09:28:58	be_	if you don't know you're probably using an onboard sound card
2016-09-11 09:29:16	be_	what sound API do you have selected in Mixxx's Sound Hardware Preferences?
2016-09-11 09:29:40	Tempest_	let me look
2016-09-11 09:31:08	Tempest_	im still looking for it..
2016-09-11 09:31:14	be_	what do you mean "I have the 2 plug in"? A headphone/microphone combination plug?
2016-09-11 09:32:11	be_	sound API is selected with a drop down at the top of the Sound Hardware pane in the Preferences
2016-09-11 09:32:39	Tempest_	still looking... i dont see anything selected as API
2016-09-11 09:33:40	be_	it's the first setting at the top of the window
2016-09-11 09:33:42	Tempest_	yes, im on an alienware pc that has 2 usb ports in front and my headset has 2 plugs, one green for the headset, and for the mic a pink one
2016-09-11 09:34:10	be_	okay
2016-09-11 09:35:01	Tempest_	i always use SAM broadcaster, and its giving me a hard time after years.... since windows 10...so I just found Mixxx and i've only been using it and testing it for an hour... so im very new to this
2016-09-11 09:35:06	be_	the only suggestion I can think of is to try the different options for sound APIs
2016-09-11 09:35:45	be_	I think DirectSound is the default on Windows
2016-09-11 09:35:55	Tempest_	ok, i will try that.. i appreciate that.  Just kind of strange that it does not show my headset on that dropdown list at all.  I rebooted, still nothing.. I'll work on it.
2016-09-11 09:35:57	be_	might want to try WDM-KS first
2016-09-11 09:36:01	Tempest_	yes, Directsound, your correct.
2016-09-11 09:36:03	Tempest_	ok
2016-09-11 09:36:13	Tempest_	i'll try... appreciate your help very much.
2016-09-11 09:37:41	be_	DirectSound has a tendency to do strange things

2016-09-11 19:09:17	fqtw	mixxx just crashed on me while i was changing the knobs on the flanger

2016-09-11 19:10:01	fqtw	how can i save my CC mappings?
2016-09-11 19:10:01	be_	that sucks :(
2016-09-11 19:10:15	Pegasus_RPG	fqtw: those should be saved in ~/.mixxx/controllerw
2016-09-11 19:10:19	Pegasus_RPG	*controllers
2016-09-11 19:10:30	Pegasus_RPG	look for a file with the name of the controller in it

2016-09-11 19:10:51	Pegasus_RPG	right
2016-09-11 19:10:55	be_	you can do that in Deere, it's just a not-obvious option
2016-09-11 19:11:00	Pegasus_RPG	%APPDATA%\Mixxx\controllers
2016-09-11 19:11:17	be_	I started rearranging the mixer in Deere to make it worked better with stacked waveforms
2016-09-11 19:11:21	Pegasus_RPG	You're talking about MIDI mappings, right?
2016-09-11 19:11:31	Pegasus_RPG	fqtw: ^
2016-09-11 19:11:34	fqtw	yes
2016-09-11 19:12:00	Pegasus_RPG	fqtw: right, then the in-progress file should be in that directory.
2016-09-11 19:12:12	fqtw	is deere's functionality a superset of latenight?
2016-09-11 19:12:17	fqtw	or does it have other things missing
2016-09-11 19:12:28	fqtw	8-_PCR_1.midi.xml
2016-09-11 19:12:45	Pegasus_RPG	fqtw: right
2016-09-11 19:12:52	Pegasus_RPG	check the modification time on that file
2016-09-11 19:13:13	Pegasus_RPG	see if it's reasonably recent
2016-09-11 19:13:25	fqtw	26 mins ago
2016-09-11 19:13:34	fqtw	it didnt save to the file before it crashed
2016-09-11 19:13:35	be_	fqtw: to put it simply, the different functionalities of the skin are a mess right now
2016-09-11 19:13:37	Pegasus_RPG	Good. Make a copy of it somewhere safe
2016-09-11 19:13:58	be_	I should go through all the skins thoroughly and document all the differences...
2016-09-11 19:14:12	Pegasus_RPG	yeah, you'll have lost whatever you did in the last 26 minutes but at least you don't have to start from scratch
2016-09-11 19:14:12	fqtw	be_: i thought skin is just cosmetic
2016-09-11 19:14:16	be_	they should be
2016-09-11 19:14:21	Pegasus_RPG	They used to be
2016-09-11 19:14:41	fqtw	ah
2016-09-11 19:14:44	be_	all the skins were completely redone for 2.0 because the skin engine changed a lot to be rescalable
2016-09-11 19:14:46	Pegasus_RPG	Until Deere gained all this cool new functionality that just hasn't yet been added to the others
2016-09-11 19:14:46	fqtw	so you recommend deere?
2016-09-11 19:14:52	be_	and not every feature was readded to every skin
2016-09-11 19:15:07	be_	it's up to you what to use
2016-09-11 19:15:11	fqtw	which features does deere have that latenight doesnt, apart from beat jumping?
2016-09-11 19:15:14	Pegasus_RPG	Deere is the reference skin, so yes, but I too prefer LateNight
2016-09-11 19:15:15	be_	personally I've grown to like the aesthetics of Deere
2016-09-11 19:15:29	be_	Deere has effect chaining
2016-09-11 19:15:51	fqtw	in latenight, are all the fx in parallel?
2016-09-11 19:15:56	be_	yeah
2016-09-11 19:15:57	be_	:/
2016-09-11 19:16:17	be_	in Deere you can expand each effect unit to expose a chain

2016-09-11 19:17:21	fqtw_	so if you have one effect 100% wet and another one 0% wet, the result will be only 50% affected by effect 1?
2016-09-11 19:17:41	be_	there aren't dry/wet knobs for individual effects
2016-09-11 19:17:44	be_	only the whole chain
2016-09-11 19:17:49	fqtw_	i mean in latenight
2016-09-11 19:18:14	Pegasus_RPG	no, each effect unit operates independently
2016-09-11 19:18:37	Pegasus_RPG	though they can operate simultaneously on the same channel if you select it on multiple units
2016-09-11 19:18:46	be_	yay I seem to be able to run with much lower latency now that I don't have to worry about waveform generation when loading tracks
2016-09-11 19:18:53	fqtw_	yeah but the outputs are summed, so it would be 100% wet from effect 1 + 0% wet from effect 2 = 50% of effect 1
2016-09-11 19:19:18	be_	no, it'd be 100% of effect 1 and 0% of effect 2
2016-09-11 19:19:30	Pegasus_RPG	fqtw: no, that config would result in just hearing effect 1 (and wasting CPU for effect 2 :) )
2016-09-11 19:19:32	fqtw_	yes but 0% of effect 2 means 100% dry
2016-09-11 19:20:02	Pegasus_RPG	They're summed in the same way the decks are
2016-09-11 19:20:03	fqtw_	which gets added to the wet signal from effect 1
2016-09-11 19:20:03	<--	fqtw (~me@x590d1a87.dyn.telefonica.de) has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2016-09-11 19:20:30	fqtw_	is there a graph of the signal path somewhere? i dont quite understand how the signal flows from the decks through the fx
2016-09-11 19:20:48	Pegasus_RPG	if you play deck 1 with the volume at 100% and deck 2 at 0%, what do you hear? It's the same with effects
2016-09-11 19:21:24	Pegasus_RPG	The FX units let you choose which channels they use as inputs (Decks 1,2,3,4,mic,master,aux,etc.)
2016-09-11 19:21:34	fqtw_	ah so its not a dry/wet knob but a volume knob of the effect's output?
2016-09-11 19:22:29	Pegasus_RPG	Oh I think I see what you mean. No, it's a dry/wet knob.
2016-09-11 19:22:29		[19:22]
2016-09-11 19:22:58	Pegasus_RPG	It's probably just quicker for you to test out a few scenarios than us try to explain it here. :)
2016-09-11 19:23:07	fqtw_	but then having two effects in parallel where one is 100% wet and the other is 100% dry would mean a summed signal with 50% effect 1
2016-09-11 19:23:44	Pegasus_RPG	Think of them as separate physical effects units in a rack
2016-09-11 19:24:00	Pegasus_RPG	with their outputs Y-cabled together
2016-09-11 19:24:17	fqtw_	so they are summed?
2016-09-11 19:24:25	Pegasus_RPG	Mixed
2016-09-11 19:24:28	be_	(btw, never use Y cables for summing. only for splitting)
2016-09-11 19:24:51	fqtw_	mixed by summing and dividing by number of inputs?
2016-09-11 19:25:10	Pegasus_RPG	Have you used effects on like a DJM mixer?
2016-09-11 19:25:32	fqtw_	no but i used effects in DAWs
2016-09-11 19:25:38	fqtw_	ableton live racks etc
2016-09-11 19:25:46	Pegasus_RPG	I can't speak to those.
2016-09-11 19:26:13	Pegasus_RPG	It sounds like you're thinking the wet/dry knobs on separate units can somehow effect each other
2016-09-11 19:26:15	fqtw_	so in deere they are chained from left to right?
2016-09-11 19:26:36	Pegasus_RPG	effect chains are a different story
2016-09-11 19:27:00	fqtw_	no im saying, if i have a bitcrusher 100% wet and a delay 100% dry, the end signal will only be 50% bitcrushed (in latenight), right?
2016-09-11 19:27:28	fqtw_	and if i have an additional effect 100% dry, the end result will only be 33% bitcrushed
2016-09-11 19:27:53	Pegasus_RPG	No. Dry = no effect processing
2016-09-11 19:28:04	Pegasus_RPG	100% dry is effectively a no-op
2016-09-11 19:28:14	Pegasus_RPG	i.e. pass-through unchanged
2016-09-11 19:28:20	fqtw_	100% dry usually means it doesnt affect the signal but lets it through
2016-09-11 19:28:36	fqtw_	but still gets summed afterwards to the other effects' outputs
2016-09-11 19:28:39	be_	oh, I think I understand your confusion
2016-09-11 19:28:40	Pegasus_RPG	100% wet = no original signal, all effect output
2016-09-11 19:28:50	be_	the chaining doesn't happen between effect units
2016-09-11 19:29:04	be_	it happens within them
2016-09-11 19:29:16	be_	you can configure multiple independent chains in different effect units
2016-09-11 19:29:20	Pegasus_RPG	right. LateNight only has one effect per unit
2016-09-11 19:29:30	Pegasus_RPG	Deere lets you set up chains of effects
2016-09-11 19:29:35	Pegasus_RPG	http://mixxx.org/manual/2.0/chapters/user_interface.html#the-effects-section
2016-09-11 19:29:36	fqtw_	ah
2016-09-11 19:29:46	Pegasus_RPG	http://mixxx.org/manual/2.0/chapters/djing_with_mixxx.html#using-effects
2016-09-11 19:31:24	theBear	holy crap ! so much has changed since i last mixxxed
2016-09-11 19:31:35	 *	Pegasus_RPG is still confused by all of the possibilities and doesn't use effects much anyway so prefers LateNight's simplicity in the FX department. :)
2016-09-11 19:32:02	be_	everyone's still confused because we haven't decided on a consistent UI or feature set
2016-09-11 19:32:17	Pegasus_RPG	It works like the DJ mixers I've used and that's good enough for me :)
2016-09-11 19:32:27	fqtw_	yeah, im suprised how feature rich it is, compared to traktor etc.
2016-09-11 19:32:36	Pegasus_RPG	Open-source, baby
2016-09-11 19:32:39	theBear	my dj mixer only has 6 knobs and 3 faders, i like it
2016-09-11 19:33:59	theBear	ooh something good, someone has good taste in older music,, not so sure about all those new songs tho
2016-09-11 19:34:52	 *	Pegasus_RPG is off to bed. Have fun, all.
2016-09-11 19:35:01	 *	be_ is trying to run at 1.45 ms latency
2016-09-11 19:35:59	fqtw_	when i want to have one knob as master pitch fader, should i only map to deck 1's pitch fader?
2016-09-11 19:36:07	fqtw_	(sync enabled)
2016-09-11 19:36:44	fqtw_	it works but only has a range that is limited by the current track
2016-09-11 19:36:59	Pegasus_RPG	That sounds reasonable. Set the range in the preferences to 100%
2016-09-11 19:37:04	fqtw_	i.e. if the other deck would allow further pitching, it doesnt do it
2016-09-11 19:37:30	Pegasus_RPG	You could assign a button to a script function that toggled which deck is master
2016-09-11 19:37:30		[19:37]
2016-09-11 19:39:59	fqtw_	Pegasus_RPG: speed slider range?
2016-09-11 19:40:28	be_	you can adjust the range of pitch sliders in the preferences
2016-09-11 19:41:11	be_	although adjusting it by extreme amounts usually sounds awkward
2016-09-11 19:43:26	fqtw_	be_: how did you make deere have overlapping waveforms?
2016-09-11 19:43:42	be_	click the hamburger menu icon in the top right
2016-09-11 19:43:54	be_	you can select different skin options in the menu that appears
2016-09-11 19:45:59	fqtw_	ah thx
2016-09-11 19:51:00		[19:45]
2016-09-11 19:51:34	fqtw_	be_: is the gain that is applied to tracks bc of replaygain independent of the deck gain knobs?
2016-09-11 19:51:43	be_	yes
2016-09-11 19:52:05	fqtw_	somewhere in the forum ive read a thread before replaygain was implemented, and ryan said when implemented it could act upon the deck gain knobs
2016-09-11 19:52:14	fqtw_	so i was worried it will interfere with me midi mapping them
2016-09-11 19:52:20	be_	nope
2016-09-11 19:52:24	fqtw_	ok
2016-09-11 19:52:49	be_	that may have been why it was decided not to do it that way
2016-09-11 19:53:46	fqtw_	ah
2016-09-11 19:57:59	fqtw_	be_: sometimes it recognizes a track's bpm as half of what it really is, if i have sync enabled it pitches the other deck up by a factor of 2
2016-09-11 19:58:22	be_	yeah, that happens occasionally
2016-09-11 19:58:31	be_	you can right click on the track in the library and double/half the BPM
2016-09-11 19:58:40	be_	and Mixxx will remember that
2016-09-11 19:59:27	fqtw_	be_: is there a way to do it on the deck? so i dont have to find the file again
2016-09-11 20:00:22	be_	not sure
2016-09-11 20:00:43	be_	I think there might be on one skin
2016-09-11 20:06:00		[20:00]
2016-09-11 20:09:55	fqtw_	be_: is the delay tempo synced?
2016-09-11 20:10:29	fqtw_	or how can i have a 1 beat delay?
2016-09-11 20:16:00		[20:10]
2016-09-11 20:31:48	fqtw_	wtf, i typed something in the song search bar and now i dont hear any audio anymore
2016-09-11 20:31:48		[20:31]
2016-09-11 20:32:07	fqtw_	none of the meters show any audio either but the track is still playing

2016-09-12 03:39:29	fqtw_	be_: some of my tracks are low bitrate mp3s and are lacking bass
2016-09-12 03:40:19	be_	I wouldn't recommend playing low bitrate MP3s, but anyway, channel EQs would be more appropriate for that
2016-09-12 03:41:39	fqtw_	you mean the effects set to a deck?
2016-09-12 03:42:04	be_	no
2016-09-12 03:42:06	be_	the EQ knobs
2016-09-12 03:43:05	fqtw_	yeah but i use them for crossfading already
2016-09-12 03:44:56	be_	I suppose you could use an EQ effect in an effect unit if you wanted
2016-09-12 03:49:46	fqtw_	be_: do you know how i can save the configuration in the Deere skin?
2016-09-12 03:50:08	fqtw_	effects, samplers and button states (sync, key lock)
2016-09-12 03:51:36	be_	you can't save effects configurations unfortunately
2016-09-12 03:51:40	be_	just samplers
2016-09-12 03:51:50	be_	keylock and quantize save across restarts
2016-09-12 03:51:58	be_	I don
2016-09-12 03:52:01	be_	't think sync does
2016-09-12 03:52:48	fqtw_	ok, and how can i save the samplers?

2016-09-13 08:23:26		[08:23]
2016-09-13 08:24:49	Pegasus_RPG	Sure, it's still listed as an agent
2016-09-13 08:25:04	Pegasus_RPG	you just have to keep the agent version up to date
2016-09-13 08:25:33	Pegasus_RPG	(I have an add-on installed that offlines outdated agents)
2016-09-13 08:26:04	Pegasus_RPG	perhaps I should remove that for the time being
2016-09-13 08:32:00		[08:26]
2016-09-13 08:33:55	wrl	there's appveyor also
2016-09-13 08:36:01	Pegasus_RPG	sblaisot: so just upgrade the Jenkins agent on your VM and it will start making builds again

2016-09-13 12:02:03	sblaisot	I made the mapping for the midi interface and a stub for the hid interface that basically pass all inputs to a js function that in turn calls the functions developped for the midi mapping

2016-09-14 05:31:19	Pegasus_RPG	fqtw: this might whet your appetite: http://djworx.com/ableton-link-goes-desktop/
2016-09-14 05:31:24	Pegasus_RPG	We'll need to make plans to add that
2016-09-14 05:32:16	fqtw	Pegasus_RPG: isnt that just midi clock sync?
2016-09-14 05:32:27	Pegasus_RPG	Probably, I haven't looked into it yet
2016-09-14 05:32:37	Pegasus_RPG	fqtw: as for scripting, we have a complete tutorial on the wiki. There's a lot to read but it teaches you everything you need for DJ controllers
2016-09-14 05:33:01	Pegasus_RPG	Ah, it's MIDI clock sync-over-LAN
2016-09-14 05:33:23	fqtw	Pegasus_RPG: i just want to mute both decks' low eq band with one button
2016-09-14 05:34:12	Pegasus_RPG	fqtw: then map that button to a function that calls engine.setValue() on LowEQKill for both (all) decks
2016-09-14 05:35:09	fqtw	Pegasus_RPG: like this? engine.setValue("[EqualizerRack1_[Channel1]_Effect1]", "button_parameter1", 0);

2016-09-14 05:37:16	Pegasus_RPG	You'll just need additional calls for decks 2-4 of course

2016-09-14 05:48:19	fqtw	be_: yeah but if ableton is the slave its ver unreliable, bpm fluctuates a lot
2016-09-14 05:48:58	fqtw	Pegasus_RPG: i only see 4 samplers but in the xml file it lists 16. how can i load samples in and trigger the other samplers?
2016-09-14 05:50:06	Pegasus_RPG	Skins limit the number of samplers they show for real estate reasons. You can still use the samplers from script/XML code though
2016-09-14 05:50:44	Pegasus_RPG	I thought Deere can page through available samplers but I don't know for sure
2016-09-14 05:56:00		[05:50]
2016-09-14 06:21:46	fqtw	Pegasus_RPG: can i also use them in the midi map?
2016-09-14 06:21:46		[06:21]
2016-09-14 06:21:53	fqtw	without js
2016-09-14 06:24:56	Pegasus_RPG	fqtw: yes, the same as the four visible ones

2016-09-14 06:26:15	Pegasus_RPG	You may need to change the "numSamplers" value though. In the past it was defined in mixxx.cpp so would need a rebuild to take effect but now I /think/ it's a CO you can set from an init() script function for example.
2016-09-14 06:27:00	Pegasus_RPG	But first just try to use them as if they're already there. Only if that doesn't work will you need to go looking for numSamplers

2016-09-14 18:05:54	dhon_	hi all, is there a 3rd party API for interfacing with Mixxx? I'd like to develop a simple touchscreen interface with a few controls
2016-09-14 18:06:18	dhon_	I'm guessing it would be possible with a virtual midi interface also?
2016-09-14 18:07:47	dhon_	I don't know much about midi though - is there a good resource for learning the control messages?
2016-09-14 18:13:00		[18:07]
2016-09-14 19:17:50	Pegasus_RPG	dhon_: you could use MIDI or HID

2016-09-14 20:06:53	dhon_	okay that was fairly straight forward - I've got a button setting Deck 1: increase speed, and a knob handling master crossfade
2016-09-14 20:06:53		[20:06]
2016-09-14 20:07:09	dhon_	but I can't seem to map anything to the "spinnies" for scratching and time shift
2016-09-14 20:07:21	dhon_	is there a dedicated midi message for this function?
2016-09-14 20:08:58	dhon_	(at least nothing comes up when I click the spinner in the Learning Wizard - is there a control name for that function?)
2016-09-14 20:13:02	dhon_	okay sounds like this might be related https://www.mixxx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=5246 - needs a custom mapping and script for scratching

2016-09-15 05:41:57	zezic	fqtw: "Panic at the Mixxx"
2016-09-15 05:42:18	fqtw	zezic: i have a gig tomorrow, if that happens im screwed
2016-09-15 05:42:25	zezic	oh no
2016-09-15 05:42:29	fqtw	it already happened twice the past two days
2016-09-15 05:42:55	zezic	meh :|
2016-09-15 05:42:56	fqtw	its my first gig too, so i dont wanna screw up
2016-09-15 05:43:06	zezic	something with GL maybe?
2016-09-15 05:43:12	fqtw	opengl?
2016-09-15 05:44:13	zezic	may be
2016-09-15 05:44:13	zezic	can you try to reproduce bug and switch waveforms to software mode?
2016-09-15 05:44:41	fqtw	zezic: how?
2016-09-15 05:44:59	zezic	I don't know yet.
2016-09-15 05:45:11	fqtw	zezic: the waveform is displaying in the deck, but no audio is coming out and no waveform is showing above. i think the problem is not with opengl
2016-09-15 05:45:21	fqtw	otherwise the audio would still be coming out
2016-09-15 05:45:45	zezic	ah
2016-09-15 05:45:49	zezic	no audio
2016-09-15 05:46:23	fqtw	zezic: yea, thats the main problem
2016-09-15 05:46:36	zezic	sorry, i don't know much about Mixxx audio problems under Windows
2016-09-15 05:46:43	fqtw	zezic: even if i eject that track and try to load another in, it doesnt work
2016-09-15 05:47:03	zezic	fqtw, 2nd deck broken too?
2016-09-15 05:47:08	fqtw	nope
2016-09-15 05:47:10	fqtw	still working
2016-09-15 05:47:15	zezic	hmmmm!
2016-09-15 05:47:24	zezic	that's an interesting bug
2016-09-15 05:47:28	fqtw	and if i have to restart mixxx live, it takes a lot of time to reconfigure everything
2016-09-15 05:47:37	fqtw	destroys the vibe

2016-09-15 05:48:09	zezic	it's not acceptable to restart it at show
2016-09-15 05:48:20	zezic	wait wait, don't close
2016-09-15 05:48:35	fqtw	if i try to load another track in the deck, it doesnt even show that waveform
2016-09-15 05:48:53	fqtw	and doesnt show that new track's bpm and key, keeps displaying the old track data
2016-09-15 05:48:55	zezic	but, as you say, 2nd deck works good?
2016-09-15 05:48:58	fqtw	yes

2016-09-15 05:50:49	fqtw	ASIO
2016-09-15 05:50:53	fqtw	steinberg ur22
2016-09-15 05:51:39	zezic	nice card
2016-09-15 05:52:12	fqtw	yes
2016-09-15 05:52:24	fqtw	never had problems with it
2016-09-15 05:53:04	fqtw	works well with 64 sample buffer
2016-09-15 05:53:14	zezic	wow, that's good
2016-09-15 05:53:53	zezic	If Pegasus_RPG don't come over soon we should try to create backtrace.
2016-09-15 05:54:44	zezic	Because I don't know another experienced Mixxx users with Windows.
2016-09-15 05:55:35	zezic	fqtw, not a fact that it discover exact problem, but may help to debug this thing. https://www.mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/creating_backtraces#windows
2016-09-15 05:56:28	fqtw	but if it doesnt crash, it wont generate a stacktrace
2016-09-15 05:56:37	zezic	Hmm.
2016-09-15 05:57:59	be_	http://mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/troubleshooting#a_deck_randomly_stops_playing
2016-09-15 05:58:53	zezic	OK, I left.
2016-09-15 06:01:02	fqtw	be_: so encoding errors trigger it?
2016-09-15 06:01:13	be_	no idea
2016-09-15 06:01:25	be_	something about some M4A files triggers it
2016-09-15 06:01:34	be_	if we know what that was, that would be great
2016-09-15 06:01:38	be_	knew*
2016-09-15 06:02:23	fqtw	be_: is there a way to recover from it when it happens?
2016-09-15 06:02:28	be_	no
2016-09-15 06:02:32	be_	Mixxx has to be restarted
2016-09-15 06:03:16	fqtw	be_: i thought maybe i can show 4 decks and then hide the upper two?
2016-09-15 06:03:32	be_	no skins do that
2016-09-15 06:03:41	be_	decks 1 and 2 are always showing
2016-09-15 06:04:05	fqtw	ah
2016-09-15 06:04:20	be_	the most reliable workaround would be to convert all your M4A files to FLAC until the bug is fixed
2016-09-15 06:04:20		[06:04]
2016-09-15 06:04:26	zezic	you can hack on a skin to toggle 1+2 / 3+4
2016-09-15 06:04:29	be_	and keep the original M4A files around
2016-09-15 06:04:48	zezic	but yes converting would be better
2016-09-15 06:06:25	fqtw	be_: why not convert to mp3 V0?
2016-09-15 06:06:39	be_	because that would sound bad
2016-09-15 06:12:00		[06:06]
2016-09-15 06:13:27	fqtw	be_: ok. btw, is there a way to map a CC to the vinyl scratch wheel?
2016-09-15 06:14:06	be_	http://mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/midi_scripting#scratching_and_jog_wheels
2016-09-15 06:14:38	fqtw	is it only possible with js?
2016-09-15 06:14:40	be_	yes
2016-09-15 06:15:41	fqtw	be_: ok, and does Deere have the inc/dec bpm buttons?
2016-09-15 06:15:45	fqtw	i cant see them
2016-09-15 06:16:09	be_	don't think so
2016-09-15 06:16:15	hfk	fqtw: Click the track BPM.

2016-09-15 06:23:58	fqtw	be_: but why would mp3 V0 sound bad? bandcamp downloads are V0 by default
2016-09-15 06:24:45	be_	that's because most people don't care
2016-09-15 06:24:51	be_	and they're trying to save bandwidth
2016-09-15 06:25:14	fqtw	be_: but V0 is 320 when necessary
2016-09-15 06:25:20	be_	also, you're starting from music that has already been lossy compressed once
2016-09-15 06:25:30	be_	Bandcamp starts from the originals
2016-09-15 06:25:48	fqtw	yes but when starting from lossless, V0 isnt that bad, right?
2016-09-15 06:27:01	be_	IMO all lossy is bad

2016-09-15 06:50:34	fqtw	be_: the vibe still comes through
2016-09-15 06:50:56	fqtw	but sheet music is a digital representation, which requires interpretation
2016-09-15 06:51:17	fqtw	be_: but most music i listen to IS a lot about ideas
