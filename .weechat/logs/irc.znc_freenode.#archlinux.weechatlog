2016-10-17 21:03:35	chx	[05:50:42] hi. I have found a passive mini PC for quite a good price which I'd like to use both as a media player and as an internet router. OpenWRT would be my choice for a router. The question is, I guess, is there a Luci - like interface for Arch? [05:50:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	Graypup_	[05:59:08] chx, I don't think so. I'd strongly suggest just rolling your own and learning iptables (nftables works too, but documentation is crap :_( ) [05:59:08]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	chx	[05:59:15] Graypup_: heh. [05:59:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	chx	[05:59:49] Graypup_: it's more of a convenience [05:59:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	Graypup_	[05:59:57] hm? [05:59:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	chx	[06:00:11] Graypup_: I've known how to configure Linux firewall since it was just ipchains [06:00:11]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	Graypup_	[06:00:21] I have a router with no web interface. I don't really miss the web interface [06:00:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	chx	[06:00:24] Graypup_: it's not that I can't, it's that I don't want to. [06:00:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	Graypup_	[06:01:11] if I want to find a device's IP and/or name, I might look in the powerdns sqlite database or the dhcp lease file [06:01:11]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	chx	[06:01:41] Graypup_: it's involved. i'd need to configure dnsmasq, dyndns besides iptables [06:01:41]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	chx	[06:02:08] but https://www.amazon.com/Qotom-Q190G4-Celeron-Processor-Barebone/dp/B019Z8T9J0 this makes me salivate [06:02:08]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	Graypup_	[06:02:13] eh fair enough. Depends if you enjoy doing such things. I found it fun to set it up myself with dhcpd and powerdns. [06:02:13]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	chx	[06:02:21] Celeron or not that's a Broadwell not an Atom [06:02:21]

2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:08:40] msp: you can look at the registry or group policies [09:08:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:08:46] alright, I'll try those instead, thanks for the help :) [09:08:46]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	MrElendig	[09:09:13] your system might be close to fubar though [09:09:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	msp	[09:09:26] pingfloyd: you think it's that deep into the system? [09:09:26]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:10:02] it's really that bad?  not just a matter of deleting and replacing a few kernel modules? [09:10:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	MrElendig	[09:10:34] it spews files all over the filesystem [09:10:34]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:11:13] msp: you won't know until you check [09:11:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:11:42] sucks to be me, in that case :| [09:11:42]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	MrElendig	[09:12:54] should never use vendor installers on gnu/linux [09:12:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	MrElendig	[09:12:58] no matter which distro [09:12:58]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:13:15] I used ubuntu previously, but I couldn't get anything but the binary blob working right [09:13:15]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:13:25] msp: if it isn't firewall and you tested with same account, what else could it be?  One other thing is to check 'hosts allow =' and 'hosts deny=' setting in smb.conf [09:13:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:13:32] the nouveau one wasn't very good, to be diplomatic [09:13:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:13:54] msp: though the assumption would be that you'd know about those one, but it still wouldn't hurt to check. [09:13:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	MrElendig	[09:14:12] bullshit, ubuntu packages the exact same driver as you get in the .run [09:14:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	msp	[09:15:01] pingfloyd: i am pretty sure that i won't find any differences - both win just work out of the box installed software for milling machines [09:15:01]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:15:08] my understanding was that the nouveau one was an open source implementation that significantly differed from the nvidia binary blob [09:15:08]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:16:47] Jonas___: it is, but you should still stick to installing through supported packages either way [09:16:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:17:26] Jonas___: unless you don't mind creating a big mess from running the vendor's installer that makes many terrible assumptions [09:17:26]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:18:05] if it's between a driver that makes a mess and a driver that doesn't serve my purpose, I'm between a rock and a hard place :( [09:18:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	MrElendig	[09:18:14] no [09:18:14]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	MrElendig	[09:18:29] you just use the distro packages to install the blog instead or running the .run directly [09:18:29]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:18:55] yeah, if the blob is available from there that's the best way [09:18:55]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	eater	[09:19:02] Jonas___: https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/nvidia/ [09:19:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	phrik	[09:19:05] Title: Arch Linux - nvidia 370.28-1 (x86_64) (at www.archlinux.org) [09:19:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:19:12] the blob from the vendor is really intended for package maintainer to make the needed adjustments.  Not so much for end user usage unless you want to be the package maintainer yourself. [09:19:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	demonicm1niac3	[09:19:30] pingfloyd: not if you listen to nvidia though [09:19:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	demonicm1niac3	[09:19:37] they spew that bullshit and fling their run at end users [09:19:37]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:20:02] of course, but we know how that out in practice vs. their theory [09:20:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:20:13] *how that works out [09:20:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:20:56] and good luck running to nvidia for help when you mess your linux system up [09:20:56]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	demonicm1niac3	[09:21:14] sure just saying. the vendors are also to blame for presenting their stuff as end user packages they should download [09:21:14]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:21:18] looks like I have the latest nvidia driver installed, I guess I ended up getting the binary blob through pacman after all [09:21:18]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:21:27] bad news, they're already the latest version too :P [09:21:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:23:36] and say for the sake of argument the user manages to successfully install their .run script okay.  Then there's the hell as the system becomes updated later. [09:23:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:23:52] or if the user later wants to remove it [09:23:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:25:14] Jonas___: if the package in fact doesn't work properly for you, you should probably submit a bug report so it gets fixed. [09:25:14]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:25:50] I wouldn't blame the driver off the bat, I still have some diagnosing to do when I get back off work and can start rebooting [09:25:50]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:26:10] this issue does seem very familiar to a problem I had a year ago, when I first got the nvidia drivers working [09:26:10]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:26:17] random lockups back then, too [09:26:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:26:20] Jonas___: yeah, it would be good include what you've tried and observed in the bug report to get it working. [09:26:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	msp	[09:39:38] pingfloyd: you were right, was the NTLMv2 protokoll, thank you very much for the help [09:39:38]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	elisaado	[09:51:46] heya [09:51:46]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	elisaado	[10:07:50] shall i run archlinux as a server? [10:07:50]

2016-10-18 00:14:23	MrElendig	[10:08:37] if you have to ask: no [10:08:37]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	lithiumpt	[10:09:56] that's actually the best answer on the subject [10:09:56]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	elisaado	[10:10:20] lol [10:10:20]

2016-10-18 01:55:00	Tom_B	Apologies, I asked this before but I'm trying to make a pkgbuild for compiling VLC nightly, it requires lua51 which I have installed but the compiler will use /usr/bin/luac, is there any way to get it to use /usr/bin/luac5.1 instead? If I `mv /usr/bin/luac5.1 /usr/bin/luac` it works and compiles successfully but obviously this is a horrible hack. Is there any way to achieve the same thing via pkgbuild without making changes to the system? I thoug
2016-10-18 01:55:00	Tom_B	ht I may be able to do this with the fakeroot in build(): `ln -s /usr/bin/luac5.1 ${pkgdir}/usr/bin/luac` but this gives me a permissions issue as ${pkgdir} doesn't seem to exist in the build() section. Any help is welcome, thanks!

2016-10-18 06:47:33	Gfurst	alad parts in question are ntfs shared, also noauto just in case to not screw it up... 
2016-10-18 06:47:33	micros	does anyone know how to post a linux user input key event for KEY_VOLDOWN/UP where the input type is EV_REL?  when i do this, no event is processed under android.  If i use EV_KEY, it works OK, but this is not suitable for a rotary knob which provides only a relative offset when its turned.
2016-10-18 06:47:58	alad	Gfurst: and that's never going to be fixed since ntfs-3g blames it on mount which blames it on ntfs-3g

2016-10-18 10:23:17	anoop	What file system should my boot partition be ? 
2016-10-18 10:23:33	Namarrgon	are you using UEFI?
2016-10-18 10:23:41	Binero	anoop: vFAT on EFI, otherwise why would you even create a seperate partition?

2016-10-18 10:24:18	Binero	I see. If it's UEFI do vFAT, otherwise, doesn't matter.

2016-10-18 10:34:02	ZeroKnight	vim could have possibly updated in a way that is making a plugin misbehave. profiling should show you which one, and you can either update it if possible, or temporarily disable it

2016-10-18 13:39:39	Tazmain	yeah got the dhcp client , still looking at how to accomplish it 
2016-10-18 13:39:39		[13:39]
2016-10-18 13:39:41	pid1	it depends on what hostname you're talking about, where it is being set and how, etc
2016-10-18 13:39:51	pid1	Tazmain: You said you use NM, read the docs
2016-10-18 13:39:54	Tazmain	but I guess not using dhcp is an easy option 
2016-10-18 13:40:05	pid1	Tazmain: It uses the internal DHCP client by default now
2016-10-18 13:40:09	Tazmain	pid1, would help if the docs have all their flags in as well. 
2016-10-18 13:40:17	MrElendig	your browser, irc client, etc etc etc will happily tell the world your hostname too
2016-10-18 13:40:29	Tazmain	seriously ?
2016-10-18 13:40:32	pid1	yes

2016-10-18 14:36:30	Motscoud	I have a bit of an odd problem. I can't seem to erase a 32GB SD card no matter how hard I try. I attempt to use the dd commands from the wiki. I tried to delete the partition, manually delete the relevant directory, reformat to fat32, format to ntfs, wipe the disk in parted and nothing seems to do anything to this disk. It sounds like it is read only, but I don't get any errors -- all of these

2016-10-18 17:54:28	stochastix	Earnestly:  Finally figured out how to make nextcloud play along with smb and my picture directories.  I ended up having to enable ACLs on ZFS,  set it for posix and passthrough. I ended up giving http access through ACLs, while standard linux perms gave perms to smb users. The main reason I needed Posix ACLs was so I could have my group rw perms for my Pics directory(recursively) continue on into the dir tree as new stuff is made. of 
2016-10-18 17:54:30	stochastix	course new stuff is still owned by http:http, but because I also used the setGUID throughout, new stuff gets set to http:users.

2016-10-18 17:55:08	Scimmia	viscera, if you update the kernel, restart. Simple
2016-10-18 17:55:26	viscera	Scimmia: it's more complicated than that, e.g. services, libraries, etc.
2016-10-18 17:55:35	Scimmia	anything else, restart services when they're updated or there are real problems with underlying libs
2016-10-18 17:55:55	moparisthebest	systemd probably too, can't just restart that can you?
2016-10-18 17:55:56	viscera	yeah and it's really nice to run a command that figures that out for you :)
2016-10-18 17:55:59	stochastix	I wish there was an easy way to do ownership stealing of new stuff and force it to a particular user:group. Other than running a cron all the time.

Currently I'm using xrandr to get the display list, but xrandr takes about half a second to run, and freezes the desktop until its finished. Is this a bug with xrandr, or is there a better tool I can use to get the information? [09:50:24]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	DanielPowerNL	[09:51:22] I only have to run xrandr once when the script is launched. But I plan on releasing this. And I'd rather if it didn't cause a desktop stutter when launched. [09:51:22]

The solution I chose was surprisingly simple - 1: create an empty file (large enough to contain all local data) with dd on the destination, 2: create a luks container in the file with cryptsetup, 3: open the container, format and mount the fs, 4: rsync local data to container and done.

2016-10-19 07:59:39	tetero	Earnestly: I've never done any serious programming in a programming language where I'm implicitly exposed to syscalls. I've mainly done some scripting and java programming (feel free to hate on java, btw)
2016-10-19 07:59:43	Earnestly	tetero: It's just ugly, plan9 did this right by guaranteeing every fd in the filesystem had an absolute path (Cnames)
2016-10-19 08:00:00	Namarrgon	mearon: you'll have to dig through the provided udev rules, i've just use lvm in the past instead

2016-10-19 08:00:25	tetero	Earnestly: Plan 9 is quite interesting. I installed it on a few rPi's and I read a bit about it. Mainly to understand their term of 'cluster' which differed from what my notion of it was. Very interesting concepts in p9
2016-10-19 08:00:31	tetero	Earnestly: I also tried Inferno
2016-10-19 08:00:42	deltasquared	implicity exposed to syscalls is usually just having access to the syscall trap instructions. I wrote a syscall wrapper for memfd before it was "stable"
2016-10-19 08:00:55	deltasquared	tetero: plan 9 would have been the future :/

2016-10-19 08:01:47	momomo	chrysalis, aren't repository based software based on certain versions though ? if i install software X using a certain repository, i can still install that version and not the latest?
2016-10-19 08:01:47	autofsckk	i use to hear music in mopd with guake, it used to stay playing even if i logout from X, now it doesnt do that anymore, if i get out to the console it stops playing, why is that? is there a way to make it as it used to work?
2016-10-19 08:01:52	tetero	deltasquared: I meant implicitly exposed to as in.. You 'can' access syscalls through java, but it's kind of going against the language whereas in a language like C it would be quite natural
2016-10-19 08:01:53	Earnestly	To be fair, Linux is the closest to plan9 anyway
2016-10-19 08:02:05	tetero	deltasquared: I'm not sure if it's the right terminology
2016-10-19 08:02:07	Earnestly	I'm just hoping they can sort out the user namespaces bits

2016-10-19 08:02:38	tetero	deltasquared: Plan 9 did have a lot of features that left me wondering why I don't have that on my modern systems

2016-10-19 08:03:41	deltasquared	alas... I'm going off topic

2016-10-19 08:06:41	chrysalis	momomo, also, you can always just pull the build scripts and build pkg X yourself instead of upgrading everything (which you should anyway, all it takes is merging a few pacdiffs)

2016-10-19 08:10:22	Earnestly	tetero: No program that produces sound for example, should need networking code
2016-10-19 08:10:51	Earnestly	tetero: The sound server should handle all of that transparently, pulseaudio is quite good being a zero-copy memory PLL design
2016-10-19 08:10:55	grazzolini	Earnestly: or at least it should use privsep
2016-10-19 08:11:16	Earnestly	So it doesn't need interrupts to adjust buffers and so on
2016-10-19 08:11:23	tetero	Earnestly: I spoke to one of the core devs of pulseaudio once and he was a very standup/nice chap. But there's a pretty significant bug I reported a year ago that still hasn't been fixed. That if you plug in a usb-soundcard it gets an audio sink. Unplug it and re-plug it and the old sink int i will disappear and the new sink will be int i+1 and it keeps doing that. So you can have two sinks, 0 and 43 in
2016-10-19 08:11:25	tetero	the end
2016-10-19 08:11:29	deltasquared	Earnestly: we have memfds on the transport now too
2016-10-19 08:11:37	tetero	Earnestly: It makes switching sound cards are horrific experience
2016-10-19 08:11:45	Earnestly	Also alsa alone, userspace stuff anyway, doesn't give you nearly as much introspection, nearly as nice of a configuration (alsa.conf has its own type system...) and you can't dynamically adjust latency on the fly
2016-10-19 08:11:47	tetero	Earnestly: ALSA is pretty good at making that a nightmare too though.
2016-10-19 08:12:02	grazzolini	tetero: well, pulseaudio uses alsa, so yes
2016-10-19 08:12:09	tetero	grazzolini: Yeah.
2016-10-19 08:12:12	deltasquared	I'd prefer pulse, at least the modules are in user space

2016-10-19 08:12:39	tetero	Earnestly: I wanted to use pulseaudio's network system once. I could never get it to work properly over WiFi due to buffering. I'd get 3 seconds of sound and then it'd crash.

2016-10-19 08:13:20	Earnestly	Pulse has some silly defaults, but yeah, since I use a custom package I can just fix all of this locally
2016-10-19 08:13:24	deltasquared	Earnestly: it's a shame plan 9 didn't have a sound server (or a zero-copy transport)
2016-10-19 08:13:31	deltasquared	that would have been interesting

2016-10-19 13:53:12	ThatTreeOverTher	unless you’re resizing more than a couple partitions I don’t see why you’d need to use anything fancy
2016-10-19 13:54:11	Scimmia	yeah, try moving partitions around manually
2016-10-19 13:54:16	struct_Human	I don't think sprunge liked my output. I think it might've been too large. Got a broken pipe with curl.
2016-10-19 13:54:41	Earnestly	ThatTreeOverTher: Again, because calculting offsets, knowing if it's even possible, ensuring alignment is maintained, resizing filesystems with the new size, etc. is all just very tedious work the computer could do for you.  Also enjoy doing all this if you ever need to move a partition from the middle somewhere else

2016-10-19 14:34:39	ThatTreeOverTher	[00:22:23] so if you leave it as `false` it just won’t do anything [00:22:23]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	docmax	[00:22:23] and why do they put this in passwd? [00:22:23]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	ZeroKnight	[00:22:26] the point of not using -Sy by itself (and why it is unsupported) is that you run the risk of blowing your dependencies to shit and breaking everything TM [00:22:26]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	ThatTreeOverTher	[00:22:47] probably something about requiring you to configure it instead of exposing it by default? [00:22:47]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	ThatTreeOverTher	[00:22:58] I dunno what exactly you’re using but that’s probably it [00:22:58]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	docmax	[00:22:59] actually there is a false bin [00:22:59]

2016-10-19 14:34:39	docmax	[00:27:55] little changes in .py files [00:27:55]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	ThatTreeOverTher	[00:28:19] you’re going to want to save those changes to a patch file and make your own PKGBUILD probably [00:28:19]

2016-10-19 14:45:18	swalladge	Lartza, Scimmia, here's the package in question if you'd like to see what I was talking about: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/peco/

2016-10-19 14:45:38	ThatTreeOverTher	coderobe: why not test the condition for whether your laptop is docked or not?
2016-10-19 14:45:56	ThatTreeOverTher	I’m sure it shows up as a file somewhere, whether it’s a file descriptor or PCIe entry
