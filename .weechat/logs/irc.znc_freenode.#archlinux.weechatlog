2016-10-17 21:03:35	chx	[05:50:42] hi. I have found a passive mini PC for quite a good price which I'd like to use both as a media player and as an internet router. OpenWRT would be my choice for a router. The question is, I guess, is there a Luci - like interface for Arch? [05:50:42]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	Graypup_	[05:59:08] chx, I don't think so. I'd strongly suggest just rolling your own and learning iptables (nftables works too, but documentation is crap :_( ) [05:59:08]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	chx	[05:59:15] Graypup_: heh. [05:59:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	chx	[05:59:49] Graypup_: it's more of a convenience [05:59:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	Graypup_	[05:59:57] hm? [05:59:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	chx	[06:00:11] Graypup_: I've known how to configure Linux firewall since it was just ipchains [06:00:11]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	Graypup_	[06:00:21] I have a router with no web interface. I don't really miss the web interface [06:00:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	chx	[06:00:24] Graypup_: it's not that I can't, it's that I don't want to. [06:00:24]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	Graypup_	[06:01:11] if I want to find a device's IP and/or name, I might look in the powerdns sqlite database or the dhcp lease file [06:01:11]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	chx	[06:01:41] Graypup_: it's involved. i'd need to configure dnsmasq, dyndns besides iptables [06:01:41]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	chx	[06:02:08] but https://www.amazon.com/Qotom-Q190G4-Celeron-Processor-Barebone/dp/B019Z8T9J0 this makes me salivate [06:02:08]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	Graypup_	[06:02:13] eh fair enough. Depends if you enjoy doing such things. I found it fun to set it up myself with dhcpd and powerdns. [06:02:13]
2016-10-17 21:03:35	chx	[06:02:21] Celeron or not that's a Broadwell not an Atom [06:02:21]

2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:08:40] msp: you can look at the registry or group policies [09:08:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:08:46] alright, I'll try those instead, thanks for the help :) [09:08:46]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	MrElendig	[09:09:13] your system might be close to fubar though [09:09:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	msp	[09:09:26] pingfloyd: you think it's that deep into the system? [09:09:26]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:10:02] it's really that bad?  not just a matter of deleting and replacing a few kernel modules? [09:10:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	MrElendig	[09:10:34] it spews files all over the filesystem [09:10:34]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:11:13] msp: you won't know until you check [09:11:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:11:42] sucks to be me, in that case :| [09:11:42]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	MrElendig	[09:12:54] should never use vendor installers on gnu/linux [09:12:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	MrElendig	[09:12:58] no matter which distro [09:12:58]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:13:15] I used ubuntu previously, but I couldn't get anything but the binary blob working right [09:13:15]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:13:25] msp: if it isn't firewall and you tested with same account, what else could it be?  One other thing is to check 'hosts allow =' and 'hosts deny=' setting in smb.conf [09:13:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:13:32] the nouveau one wasn't very good, to be diplomatic [09:13:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:13:54] msp: though the assumption would be that you'd know about those one, but it still wouldn't hurt to check. [09:13:54]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	MrElendig	[09:14:12] bullshit, ubuntu packages the exact same driver as you get in the .run [09:14:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	msp	[09:15:01] pingfloyd: i am pretty sure that i won't find any differences - both win just work out of the box installed software for milling machines [09:15:01]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:15:08] my understanding was that the nouveau one was an open source implementation that significantly differed from the nvidia binary blob [09:15:08]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:16:47] Jonas___: it is, but you should still stick to installing through supported packages either way [09:16:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:17:26] Jonas___: unless you don't mind creating a big mess from running the vendor's installer that makes many terrible assumptions [09:17:26]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:18:05] if it's between a driver that makes a mess and a driver that doesn't serve my purpose, I'm between a rock and a hard place :( [09:18:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	MrElendig	[09:18:14] no [09:18:14]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	MrElendig	[09:18:29] you just use the distro packages to install the blog instead or running the .run directly [09:18:29]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:18:55] yeah, if the blob is available from there that's the best way [09:18:55]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	eater	[09:19:02] Jonas___: https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/nvidia/ [09:19:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	phrik	[09:19:05] Title: Arch Linux - nvidia 370.28-1 (x86_64) (at www.archlinux.org) [09:19:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:19:12] the blob from the vendor is really intended for package maintainer to make the needed adjustments.  Not so much for end user usage unless you want to be the package maintainer yourself. [09:19:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	demonicm1niac3	[09:19:30] pingfloyd: not if you listen to nvidia though [09:19:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	demonicm1niac3	[09:19:37] they spew that bullshit and fling their run at end users [09:19:37]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:20:02] of course, but we know how that out in practice vs. their theory [09:20:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:20:13] *how that works out [09:20:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:20:56] and good luck running to nvidia for help when you mess your linux system up [09:20:56]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	demonicm1niac3	[09:21:14] sure just saying. the vendors are also to blame for presenting their stuff as end user packages they should download [09:21:14]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:21:18] looks like I have the latest nvidia driver installed, I guess I ended up getting the binary blob through pacman after all [09:21:18]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:21:27] bad news, they're already the latest version too :P [09:21:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:23:36] and say for the sake of argument the user manages to successfully install their .run script okay.  Then there's the hell as the system becomes updated later. [09:23:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:23:52] or if the user later wants to remove it [09:23:52]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:25:14] Jonas___: if the package in fact doesn't work properly for you, you should probably submit a bug report so it gets fixed. [09:25:14]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:25:50] I wouldn't blame the driver off the bat, I still have some diagnosing to do when I get back off work and can start rebooting [09:25:50]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:26:10] this issue does seem very familiar to a problem I had a year ago, when I first got the nvidia drivers working [09:26:10]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	Jonas___	[09:26:17] random lockups back then, too [09:26:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	pingfloyd	[09:26:20] Jonas___: yeah, it would be good include what you've tried and observed in the bug report to get it working. [09:26:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	msp	[09:39:38] pingfloyd: you were right, was the NTLMv2 protokoll, thank you very much for the help [09:39:38]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	elisaado	[09:51:46] heya [09:51:46]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	elisaado	[10:07:50] shall i run archlinux as a server? [10:07:50]

2016-10-18 00:14:23	MrElendig	[10:08:37] if you have to ask: no [10:08:37]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	lithiumpt	[10:09:56] that's actually the best answer on the subject [10:09:56]
2016-10-18 00:14:23	elisaado	[10:10:20] lol [10:10:20]

2016-10-18 01:55:00	Tom_B	Apologies, I asked this before but I'm trying to make a pkgbuild for compiling VLC nightly, it requires lua51 which I have installed but the compiler will use /usr/bin/luac, is there any way to get it to use /usr/bin/luac5.1 instead? If I `mv /usr/bin/luac5.1 /usr/bin/luac` it works and compiles successfully but obviously this is a horrible hack. Is there any way to achieve the same thing via pkgbuild without making changes to the system? I thoug
2016-10-18 01:55:00	Tom_B	ht I may be able to do this with the fakeroot in build(): `ln -s /usr/bin/luac5.1 ${pkgdir}/usr/bin/luac` but this gives me a permissions issue as ${pkgdir} doesn't seem to exist in the build() section. Any help is welcome, thanks!

2016-10-18 06:47:33	Gfurst	alad parts in question are ntfs shared, also noauto just in case to not screw it up... 
2016-10-18 06:47:33	micros	does anyone know how to post a linux user input key event for KEY_VOLDOWN/UP where the input type is EV_REL?  when i do this, no event is processed under android.  If i use EV_KEY, it works OK, but this is not suitable for a rotary knob which provides only a relative offset when its turned.
2016-10-18 06:47:58	alad	Gfurst: and that's never going to be fixed since ntfs-3g blames it on mount which blames it on ntfs-3g

2016-10-18 10:23:17	anoop	What file system should my boot partition be ? 
2016-10-18 10:23:33	Namarrgon	are you using UEFI?
2016-10-18 10:23:41	Binero	anoop: vFAT on EFI, otherwise why would you even create a seperate partition?

2016-10-18 10:24:18	Binero	I see. If it's UEFI do vFAT, otherwise, doesn't matter.

2016-10-18 10:34:02	ZeroKnight	vim could have possibly updated in a way that is making a plugin misbehave. profiling should show you which one, and you can either update it if possible, or temporarily disable it

2016-10-18 13:39:39	Tazmain	yeah got the dhcp client , still looking at how to accomplish it 
2016-10-18 13:39:39		[13:39]
2016-10-18 13:39:41	pid1	it depends on what hostname you're talking about, where it is being set and how, etc
2016-10-18 13:39:51	pid1	Tazmain: You said you use NM, read the docs
2016-10-18 13:39:54	Tazmain	but I guess not using dhcp is an easy option 
2016-10-18 13:40:05	pid1	Tazmain: It uses the internal DHCP client by default now
2016-10-18 13:40:09	Tazmain	pid1, would help if the docs have all their flags in as well. 
2016-10-18 13:40:17	MrElendig	your browser, irc client, etc etc etc will happily tell the world your hostname too
2016-10-18 13:40:29	Tazmain	seriously ?
2016-10-18 13:40:32	pid1	yes
2016-10-18 13:40:43	pid1	but again, what is the actual /point/ of all of this
