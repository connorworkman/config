2016-10-26 15:34:02	NextHendrix	its a minor subset of racism, only because you're racially discriminating about not making funny jokes they enjoy about their ethnicity
2016-10-26 15:34:29	NextHendrix	and is generally accepted in lad culture, and frowned upon to moan about it or call it racist
2016-10-26 15:35:38	javaisnom	to insult one based on their race?
