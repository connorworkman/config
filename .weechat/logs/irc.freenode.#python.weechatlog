2016-09-14 00:52:49	NewLearner	I think maybe the reason why the formula is the way it is is that big oh notation is based on the concept of 'the worst case scenario'

How can this be prevented? Are they not properly separate processes?

I was told to use the http protocol for my app instead of straight sockets to send data back and forth to the client/server. So I am wondering about how the setup should actually be. I was thinking of using nginx as a reverse proxy server to send the data to the app on the server. I

2016-09-14 02:42:06	Yhg1s	You can't really avoid sockets. What you should avoid is using sockets *directly* :)
2016-09-14 02:42:37	Yhg1s	HTTP is a convenient protocol for many things. It isn't just for webpages. If you really want a non-standard protocol, use a higher-level abstraction over sockets, like twisted or asyncio.
2016-09-14 02:42:47	seanrdev	Well I want to start with just sending text back and forth. Then once that is up and working I wanted to start working on sending data.

2016-09-14 02:43:22	Yhg1s	fub: the re module is close to PCRE (it's based on an old version of PCRE).

2016-09-14 02:43:45	seanrdev	I'm sorry. I mean large files. MB's of information.
2016-09-14 02:43:59	seanrdev	versus a few bytes of text
2016-09-14 02:44:03	fub	Yhg1s: but when using the python re module, I guess I need to adjust the prce string first, right?
2016-09-14 02:44:10	Yhg1s	seanrdev: well, HTTP can do that just fine, and many http libraries have efficient ways of encoding and sending such data.
2016-09-14 02:44:16	Yhg1s	fub: that depends on the string.
2016-09-14 02:44:23	fub	Yhg1s: for example /domain=[^&]*?([\\x3b\\x60]|\\x24\\x28|%3b|%60|%24%28)/Pi

2016-09-14 02:57:55	seanrdev	Yhg1s: Well here is my idea. I want to encrypt the message on the client side and send it to the server. Therefore the message sits there and forwards a copy when the recipient becomes available. The server just holds all of the encrypted messages. Simple authentication and eventually sending large pieces of data. Is XMPP for me or http or twisted etc etc? I am not a coding god but I'm not a newbie either. Suggestions?

2016-09-14 03:45:04	dendazen	guys i am running into an issue with the linker path, i run this command  /usr/bin/python2.7 setup.py install and it starts building my library, but i get an error '/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpython2.7' and i understand why, since i installed python2.7 in parallel with stock version 2.6 and my path is "/opt/rh/python27/root/usr/lib64/" but setup.py generates "gcc -pthread -shared build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/cParse.o -L.
2016-09-14 03:45:04	dendazen	 -lpython2.7 ..." this command, if i manually run "gcc -pthread -shared build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/cParse.o -L /opt/rh/python27/root/usr/lib64/ -lpython2.7 ..." it works. But how do i make setup function to add that path for gcc for the linker to see my python2.7? I have tried adding LD_LIBRARY_PATH but apparently it is only for run time not for link/build time. Stuck here, thanks in advance.
2016-09-14 03:45:08	sigdk	Yhg1s, so, why HTTPConnectionPool(host='...', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url   could not be also due to server delay?

2016-09-14 07:45:59	BlockCubed	and before I did the daunting question was
2016-09-14 07:46:00	CrtxReavr	Run!
2016-09-14 07:46:03	BlockCubed	python 2 or 3
2016-09-14 07:46:08	simpson	BlockCubed: Python 3.
2016-09-14 07:46:09	DLSteve	3
2016-09-14 07:46:12	BlockCubed	I have done quite a bit of research
2016-09-14 07:46:16	BlockCubed	3 was my conclusion
2016-09-14 07:46:18	Wooble	simpson: typo?
2016-09-14 07:46:22	simpson	Picking up Python 2 after learning Python 3 is non-trivial but definitely doable.
2016-09-14 07:46:22	BlockCubed	because 2 is no longer supported
2016-09-14 07:46:31	Wooble	BlockCubed: actually, it is.
2016-09-14 07:46:32	simpson	BlockCubed: Wrong; Python 2.7 will live indefinitely.
2016-09-14 07:46:38	DLSteve	BlockCubed, 2 is supported.

2016-09-14 07:47:09	BlockCubed	sorry I mean they are no longer devbeoping it further
2016-09-14 07:47:12	Fuzzmz	go with 3 if you're starting fresh and don't rely on any modules that are 2.x only
2016-09-14 07:47:14	BlockCubed	they are focusing on 3
2016-09-14 07:47:23	BlockCubed	that is what I meant not no longer supported
2016-09-14 07:47:25	simpson	BlockCubed: No, the PyPy team is working hard on their Python 2.7 interpreter and intend to support it indefinitely.
2016-09-14 07:47:26	BlockCubed	<---- noooooob
2016-09-14 07:47:32	simpson	And PyPy's got the PSF's blessing.

2016-09-14 09:53:35	_habnabit	theY4Kman, i guess if you define 'primitive' as 'a type for which there is a literal'
2016-09-14 09:53:48	theY4Kman	What do you define it as?
2016-09-14 09:53:48	_habnabit	theY4Kman, but does that mean a set is a primitive or not? there's no empty set literal
2016-09-14 09:53:53	simpson	theY4Kman: "Primitive" in this sort of situation doesn't mean "parser building block", but "unwrapped value which does not behave like an object".
2016-09-14 09:53:56	Suit_Of_Sables	I'm using itertuples() over a DataFrame so I get back 'named' tuples like (A=1, B=2, C=3). If I have a list ['A', 'C'] how would you suggest I use it to access the 'values' of A and C, that is, 1 and 3.

2016-09-14 23:33:23	kblin	I've got the impression that an abstraction layer like SQLAlchemy would help, but I already have the database structure, and it doesn't exactly match the way the SQLAlchemy ORM likes to set up things

2016-09-15 01:51:40	thevishy	shouldn't it just find libsasl2.so.3?

2016-09-15 06:42:25	codingthings	Yhg1s would that lead to the browser session being created multiple times?
2016-09-15 06:42:38	simpson	I agree that key= is an obvious thing that bisect's API is missing, but it would have been nice if Raymond would have *documented* in the module docs that it's a misfeature.

2016-09-15 07:21:42	Apteryx	I'd be a proponent of pure pip packages, but this raises some questions, such as: how do I deploy? I can reference the git repo URL in the requirements.txt file which is great, but the git URL is not available for customers desiring to install it --> Need to package the whole thing?

But, it seems when I grab that information that the csv/file iterator proceeds to the next line. I'd like to do something like ``with open(path, 'r') as csv_file: first_line = csv_file.readline()`` before doing ``records = csv.reader(csv_file)`` and ``for record in

You can either monkeypatch very early (by assigning to sys.modules['scipy.fftpack'] before you even import scipy), or update the existing scipy.fftpack module with new contents.

2016-09-15 15:17:40	p0lm	Hey, with dictionaries becoming sortable by default, I was wondering if it could be a good idea to support slices to. Slice objects aren't hashable, so they're not supported for key values anyway.
2016-09-15 15:17:47	nedbat	XHFHX: then you need to understand what types the expect in the arguments.

2016-09-15 15:18:13	_habnabit	Cohedrin, er, what? you're using ctypes to read a binary file?

2016-09-15 16:33:53	moshez	in general, it's good to not eat the traceback. a good place to put the traceback is in the friggin' logfile :)
2016-09-15 16:34:06	wleslie	XHFHX: maybe print out that list and see what you get.  it might not be what you expect.
2016-09-15 16:34:25	wleslie	the `traceback` module is really handy, btw
2016-09-15 16:34:44	jeffreylevesque	i created a traceback module that writes to logfiles
2016-09-15 16:34:55	jeffreylevesque	it's a little bit buggy for some cases
2016-09-15 16:34:58	wleslie	no, the traceback module.  as in, `pydoc traceback`
2016-09-15 16:35:02	jeffreylevesque	oh
2016-09-15 16:35:29	jeffreylevesque	i'll try to refactor this later
2016-09-15 16:35:30	_habnabit	jeffreylevesque, er, what logging are you using that doesn't already do that?
2016-09-15 16:35:31	wleslie	traceback.format_exc() is a very useful tool
