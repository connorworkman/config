2016-09-14 00:52:49	NewLearner	I think maybe the reason why the formula is the way it is is that big oh notation is based on the concept of 'the worst case scenario'

How can this be prevented? Are they not properly separate processes?

I was told to use the http protocol for my app instead of straight sockets to send data back and forth to the client/server. So I am wondering about how the setup should actually be. I was thinking of using nginx as a reverse proxy server to send the data to the app on the server. I

2016-09-14 02:42:06	Yhg1s	You can't really avoid sockets. What you should avoid is using sockets *directly* :)
2016-09-14 02:42:37	Yhg1s	HTTP is a convenient protocol for many things. It isn't just for webpages. If you really want a non-standard protocol, use a higher-level abstraction over sockets, like twisted or asyncio.
2016-09-14 02:42:47	seanrdev	Well I want to start with just sending text back and forth. Then once that is up and working I wanted to start working on sending data.

2016-09-14 02:43:45	seanrdev	I'm sorry. I mean large files. MB's of information.
2016-09-14 02:43:59	seanrdev	versus a few bytes of text
2016-09-14 02:44:03	fub	Yhg1s: but when using the python re module, I guess I need to adjust the prce string first, right?
2016-09-14 02:44:10	Yhg1s	seanrdev: well, HTTP can do that just fine, and many http libraries have efficient ways of encoding and sending such data.
2016-09-14 02:44:16	Yhg1s	fub: that depends on the string.
2016-09-14 02:44:23	fub	Yhg1s: for example /domain=[^&]*?([\\x3b\\x60]|\\x24\\x28|%3b|%60|%24%28)/Pi

Therefore the message sits there and forwards a copy when the recipient becomes available. The server just holds all of the encrypted messages. Simple authentication and eventually sending large pieces of data. Is XMPP for me or http or twisted etc etc? I am not a coding god but I'm not a newbie either. Suggestions?

2016-09-14 03:45:04	dendazen	guys i am running into an issue with the linker path, i run this command  /usr/bin/python2.7 setup.py install and it starts building my library, but i get an error '/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpython2.7' and i understand why, since i installed python2.7 in parallel with stock version 2.6 and my path is "/opt/rh/python27/root/usr/lib64/" but setup.py generates "gcc -pthread -shared build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/cParse.o -L.
2016-09-14 03:45:04	dendazen	 -lpython2.7 ..." this command, if i manually run "gcc -pthread -shared build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/cParse.o -L /opt/rh/python27/root/usr/lib64/ -lpython2.7 ..." it works. But how do i make setup function to add that path for gcc for the linker to see my python2.7? I have tried adding LD_LIBRARY_PATH but apparently it is only for run time not for link/build time. Stuck here, thanks in advance.
2016-09-14 03:45:08	sigdk	Yhg1s, so, why HTTPConnectionPool(host='...', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url   could not be also due to server delay?

2016-09-14 07:45:59	BlockCubed	and before I did the daunting question was
2016-09-14 07:46:00	CrtxReavr	Run!
2016-09-14 07:46:03	BlockCubed	python 2 or 3
2016-09-14 07:46:08	simpson	BlockCubed: Python 3.
2016-09-14 07:46:09	DLSteve	3
2016-09-14 07:46:12	BlockCubed	I have done quite a bit of research
2016-09-14 07:46:16	BlockCubed	3 was my conclusion
2016-09-14 07:46:18	Wooble	simpson: typo?
2016-09-14 07:46:22	simpson	Picking up Python 2 after learning Python 3 is non-trivial but definitely doable.
2016-09-14 07:46:22	BlockCubed	because 2 is no longer supported
2016-09-14 07:46:31	Wooble	BlockCubed: actually, it is.
2016-09-14 07:46:32	simpson	BlockCubed: Wrong; Python 2.7 will live indefinitely.
2016-09-14 07:46:38	DLSteve	BlockCubed, 2 is supported.

2016-09-14 07:47:09	BlockCubed	sorry I mean they are no longer devbeoping it further
2016-09-14 07:47:12	Fuzzmz	go with 3 if you're starting fresh and don't rely on any modules that are 2.x only
2016-09-14 07:47:14	BlockCubed	they are focusing on 3
2016-09-14 07:47:23	BlockCubed	that is what I meant not no longer supported
2016-09-14 07:47:25	simpson	BlockCubed: No, the PyPy team is working hard on their Python 2.7 interpreter and intend to support it indefinitely.
2016-09-14 07:47:26	BlockCubed	<---- noooooob
2016-09-14 07:47:32	simpson	And PyPy's got the PSF's blessing.

2016-09-14 09:53:35	_habnabit	theY4Kman, i guess if you define 'primitive' as 'a type for which there is a literal'
2016-09-14 09:53:48	theY4Kman	What do you define it as?
2016-09-14 09:53:48	_habnabit	theY4Kman, but does that mean a set is a primitive or not? there's no empty set literal
2016-09-14 09:53:53	simpson	theY4Kman: "Primitive" in this sort of situation doesn't mean "parser building block", but "unwrapped value which does not behave like an object".
2016-09-14 09:53:56	Suit_Of_Sables	I'm using itertuples() over a DataFrame so I get back 'named' tuples like (A=1, B=2, C=3). If I have a list ['A', 'C'] how would you suggest I use it to access the 'values' of A and C, that is, 1 and 3.

2016-09-14 23:33:23	kblin	I've got the impression that an abstraction layer like SQLAlchemy would help, but I already have the database structure, and it doesn't exactly match the way the SQLAlchemy ORM likes to set up things

2016-09-15 06:42:25	codingthings	Yhg1s would that lead to the browser session being created multiple times?
2016-09-15 06:42:38	simpson	I agree that key= is an obvious thing that bisect's API is missing, but it would have been nice if Raymond would have *documented* in the module docs that it's a misfeature.

But, it seems when I grab that information that the csv/file iterator proceeds to the next line. I'd like to do something like ``with open(path, 'r') as csv_file: first_line = csv_file.readline()`` before doing ``records = csv.reader(csv_file)`` and ``for record in

You can either monkeypatch very early (by assigning to sys.modules['scipy.fftpack'] before you even import scipy), or update the existing scipy.fftpack module with new contents.

2016-09-15 15:17:40	p0lm	Hey, with dictionaries becoming sortable by default, I was wondering if it could be a good idea to support slices to. Slice objects aren't hashable, so they're not supported for key values anyway.
2016-09-15 15:17:47	nedbat	XHFHX: then you need to understand what types the expect in the arguments.

2016-09-15 16:33:53	moshez	in general, it's good to not eat the traceback. a good place to put the traceback is in the friggin' logfile :)
2016-09-15 16:34:06	wleslie	XHFHX: maybe print out that list and see what you get.  it might not be what you expect.
2016-09-15 16:34:25	wleslie	the `traceback` module is really handy, btw
2016-09-15 16:34:44	jeffreylevesque	i created a traceback module that writes to logfiles
2016-09-15 16:34:55	jeffreylevesque	it's a little bit buggy for some cases
2016-09-15 16:34:58	wleslie	no, the traceback module.  as in, `pydoc traceback`
2016-09-15 16:35:02	jeffreylevesque	oh
2016-09-15 16:35:29	jeffreylevesque	i'll try to refactor this later
2016-09-15 16:35:30	_habnabit	jeffreylevesque, er, what logging are you using that doesn't already do that?
2016-09-15 16:35:31	wleslie	traceback.format_exc() is a very useful tool

2016-10-01 17:20:16	jleclanche	it's quite silly; xdg shared-mime spec is far far better than all the libmagic stuff, yet nobody really uses it outside of file managers because it's atrociously slow and annoying to follow
2016-10-01 17:21:02	dorian	is it slow?
2016-10-01 17:21:08	dorian	i've never actually profiled it
2016-10-01 17:21:20	jleclanche	its usually slower than libmagic yeah
2016-10-01 17:21:36	dorian	i mean, if you're parsing all those xml files on the fly over and over again then yes it will be
2016-10-01 17:21:54	jleclanche	there's a cache system for it; but the cache is still not great

2016-10-01 17:22:03	notmike	in my /usr/local/bin I have python, python2, python2.7, pythonw, pythonw2, and a *-config for each. What's going on exactly?
2016-10-01 17:22:10	dorian	but wouldn't that be implementation-specific?
2016-10-01 17:22:32	dorian	i mean, shared-mime-info is just a bunch of xml and a spec, no?
2016-10-01 17:22:58	jleclanche	dorian: the cache is part of the spec. most implementations are awful because, unlike libmagic, they're not used in performance-critical apps so nobody really helps improve them

That said, I just tried a test with a broken up string: https://gist.github.com/JustinTArthur/50368ccc44f8777ff56e69ab76d69f66 both calls resulted in the same output.

2016-10-02 03:25:03	Marethyu	Hi guys. I've got an annoying problem. I use the Selenium webdriver library to take screenshots of webpages. The screenshot is saved with driver.save_screenshot(full_path). Then, the file is opened with PIL and modified. The problem is that driver.save() doesn't wait for the file to be completely written to disk, and PIL opens only half of the screenshot. 1/2
2016-10-02 03:25:07	ChrisWarrick	dexterrr: You have an Operations class, whose constructor takes two arguments, a and b. You don’t use any of those anywhere though, as your my_whatever methods ask for a and b anyway and completely ignore self.a and self.b.

2016-10-02 06:49:10	Lazik	My program checks for update on my server, download the new frozen python exec as prog_rev.exe. Then it launches updater.exe and sys.exit().

I can verify it's the new version but when it runs it's internal version is still showing up as the old prog.exe ;

2016-10-02 07:51:59	jfhbrook	hk3380: my guess is that certain testing tools got popular around 3.2 and many projects haven't had a reason to remove 3.2 testing
2016-10-02 07:52:14	jfhbrook	hk3380: like, why bother if your project continues to pass 3.2 in travis/tox/etc?
2016-10-02 07:52:22	jfhbrook	why bother to remove it, I mean
2016-10-02 07:52:39	amirite	so, in perl when you want to start keying up a dict but really deeply you don't have to keep defining internal (deep) keys as new hashes, you can just $variable{key1}{key2}{key3}{key4}{..etc} -- is there a way in python to avoid devoting lines just to say `variable[key1] also equals dict`, `variable[key1][key2] yeah thats a dict too`
2016-10-02 07:52:57	hk3380	jfhbrook: yeah i also just noticed that travis doesn't support py31 and py30
2016-10-02 07:52:57		[07:52]
2016-10-02 07:53:05	jfhbrook	yeah makes sense
2016-10-02 07:53:21	jfhbrook	but also minor versions can add new APIs and language features, for all I know a real popular one showed up in 3.2

2016-10-02 09:37:35	afidegnum	hello, using eval didn't work for me, it still generates an error how best can i strip out the quotes ? ['[(-1.328399,7.65498),(-1.32941,7.655483),(-1.329665,7.655611),(-1.331105,7.655786),(-1.33289,7.656074)]']   using [1:-1]  also didn't work either

2016-10-02 09:37:58	JavaLover	tos9 and i'm like...so how do you make an entity?  but I found an example online that does 2 different types
2016-10-02 09:38:03	eevee	Isotop7: well then just do ._replace({key: value})
2016-10-02 09:38:20	_habnabit	._replace(**{key: value}) if it's a variable
2016-10-02 09:38:24	JavaLover	tos9 one type is Class Interest {  CustomerEmailAddress; CustomerPhoneNumber; CreationDate;}
2016-10-02 09:38:26	_habnabit	don't think _replace takes a dict
2016-10-02 09:38:39	JavaLover	tos9, and the other is like House{ //methods that deal with interest in here}
2016-10-02 09:39:04	JavaLover	so I take it I can have a simple business object that has data in it...
2016-10-02 09:39:09	JavaLover	or "entity"
