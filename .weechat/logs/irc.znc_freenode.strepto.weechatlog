2016-11-02 03:47:43	alyptik	always had insomnia
2016-11-02 03:47:56	strepto	Me too.
2016-11-02 03:48:05	alyptik	there were a couple bad thing, but most of the situations from ambien are more comical thankfully
2016-11-02 03:48:09	alyptik	in my case i mean
2016-11-02 03:48:14	strepto	I've always used off-label stuff.
2016-11-02 03:48:17	strepto	Have you tried Seroquel?
2016-11-02 03:48:22	alyptik	ugh i hate it
2016-11-02 03:48:28	alyptik	i am a zombie for 2 days after

2016-11-02 03:48:41	alyptik	antipsychotics are crazy strong
2016-11-02 03:48:44	alyptik	yeah indeed
2016-11-02 03:49:03	strepto	Don't have to take much to get good sleep effect though. I took 25mg and that was enough.
2016-11-02 03:50:43	alyptik	shit 10mg knocked my ass out lol
2016-11-02 03:50:55	strepto	For antipsyc you take 500-700mg.
2016-11-02 03:51:25	alyptik	yeah i can't even imagine
2016-11-02 03:57:00		[03:51]

2016-11-02 04:02:29	strepto	WHere do you buy the tunes?

2016-11-02 05:38:04		[05:38]
2016-11-02 05:38:07	alyptik	sorry feel asleep
2016-11-02 05:38:10	alyptik	fell*
2016-11-02 05:38:22	alyptik	admittedly i don't currently; out of work 
2016-11-02 05:39:04	strepto	Ah, right.
2016-11-02 05:39:10	alyptik	i am planning to use beatport more than likely once my health issues are resolved, are there other sites?
2016-11-02 05:39:30	strepto	I only use Beatport. I've used Juno, they can be a tad bit cheaper, but their gui is horrible.
2016-11-02 05:39:44	strepto	I buy all my music.
2016-11-02 05:39:57	alyptik	hm
2016-11-02 05:40:00	alyptik	can't find juno site
2016-11-02 05:40:04	alyptik	link please :D
2016-11-02 05:40:27	alyptik	yeah i remember you telling me you deleted all your pirated music
2016-11-02 05:40:46	alyptik	idk if i could ever do that tbh hah; way too much time spent digging
2016-11-02 05:40:55	alyptik	i would likely just rebuy ones i really liked
2016-11-02 05:41:09	strepto	http://www.junodownload.com/
2016-11-02 05:41:33	alyptik	holy crap
2016-11-02 05:41:34	strepto	For me, buying my tunes made me more picky and selective, and makes me cherish them more.
2016-11-02 05:41:45	alyptik	you weren't kidding about how sketchy it is
2016-11-02 05:41:47	strepto	Looks like something exploded on your browser.
2016-11-02 05:41:52	strepto	But they are REALLY bug.
2016-11-02 05:41:53	strepto	big
2016-11-02 05:41:55	alyptik	i don't doubt it hah
2016-11-02 05:42:15	alyptik	i force myself to delete my meh songs 
2016-11-02 05:42:35	alyptik	i used to keep eveything but then you end up never being able to find the good songs
2016-11-02 05:43:08	alyptik	even though i didn't buy it, still hurts
2016-11-02 05:43:22	alyptik	do you prune your library like that?
