2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[18:30:15] increased latency to 90+ms and recorded with audacity.. perfect now [18:30:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[18:30:52] however this much latency affects what you hear from headphones pretty much [18:30:52]

2016-10-17 21:03:37	Raghvendra	[06:54:48] Hello, I am Raghvendra Rao and I am a first year B.Tech student. I want to contribute to Mixxx in GSoC  2017. I don't have any programming knowledge but I have passion to work hard for it. [06:54:48]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	nko	[15:52:46] hi [15:52:46]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	nko	[15:53:10] i'm searching some help with mixxx in a eeepc [15:53:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	nko	[15:53:41] i'm trying to solve a i915 bug [15:53:41]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[19:36:29] hmmm, what the b in b tech stands for ? [19:36:29]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[19:42:18] laama, err, latency should be irrelevant if you recording in a seperate app, cos yer ain't gonna be playing that recording back fer at least a few minutes,maybe weeks anyway, and if it clipping in digital land, buffer sizes/latency will make ZERO difference to that, the right way to fix things is to turn them down a bit so they don't clip.... and yeah, you'lll notice in some setups, like what you doing today, that clipping in digital land can kinda cause  [19:42:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[19:42:18] cascade eff-up due to going thru a series of stages/programming/virtual amp/attenuators or wtf you wanna call it, all programmed assuming no hard out-of-bits kinda clipping to be coming at them, which ya know, can make some huge ugly effect on one recording outpuut maybe, oooh, i not playeedd with it since they were "common", but i bet mp3/other compression wouldn't help that effect either.... annnnnyway, just don't let stuff clip, there's nothing good ab [19:42:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[19:42:19] it technically or in the real world, if yer want distortion get a pedal or effect or plugin, yer speakers and headphones and power amps and everything will thank you in the long run your case lik [19:42:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[19:42:40] oh, methinks logs have stooged me a bit on timing [19:42:40]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[19:44:57] theBear: yeah i recorded with audaciry and worked great. better than mixxx recording [19:44:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[19:56:55] laama, that's just coincidence cos something between the two is turning it down... there still only so many bits of data being passed around the machine, and when yer run outta them it's not cool, like when a shitty vidcam goes from dark to bright, and suddenly half of everything is just saturated max bright/white and yer can't see anymore, assuming digital examlpes all round, it's exactly like that [19:56:55]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[19:57:34] not that i defending mixxx, just ya know, cos i been a audio tech for so long, i feel people must understand and not be misled as to details at these times:) [19:57:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:03:38] yeah i think you are correct:) [20:03:38]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:03:47] i dont want to blame mixx either [20:03:47]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:05:38] i never get this harsh clipping when streaming or playing [20:05:38]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:06:05] ... or maybe then if i over-use gain but that's different and not wise [20:06:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:08:32] i could share my 2 different recordings to demonstrate the harsh noise if anyone interested [20:08:32]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:08:49] second one is clipping 100x more but there is no audible error [20:08:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:09:03] first one does not clip much, but is noisy [20:09:03]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:09:49] and even if it doesnt clip when opened in audacity.. it still is occasionally noisy (that's when mixx volume bar goes red..) [20:09:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:10:22] yeah long story and difficult to investigate [20:10:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[20:12:21] like i say, cos it's generally assumed that any code handling audio will never see anything hit top or bottom literal max, it can cascade and go very ugly, sometimes on similar appearance (from user pov) paths... for example as i recall tascam pro dat tape recordey machines, popular in 90s for things like get from studio big-tape or new-digital-recordey-thinger in the studio, maybe mixed to "master" or already mixed just transferring, so it fit in a pocke [20:12:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[20:12:22] a cheap (not several hndred bucks of massive reel2reel heavy tape) tape and you could take it to get cheap diy-lkooking cds burnt somewhere ?:) [20:12:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[20:15:21] mmmm, tracking down tiny/occasional hits on something like that, specially if yer djing at the time, ain't super easy... this is why i grown very fond of compressors, often set pretty hard limiterey, specially in places where yer got ya know, a few 10kW's worth of subs that you know the young ass dj coming on next would happily drive louder and louder till the whole thing is a distorted effing whitewash of nothing, making him AND me look bad when everythi [20:15:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[20:15:21] smokes or melts, but if i leave my little hidden anti-idiot compressor locked in the not-dj rack somewhere, i can go have a few drinks or a nap in a truck , safe in the knowledge he can make himself sound bad, but not hurt my stuiffs :) [20:15:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[20:15:44] heh, kLOs didn't like my feelings on 90s studio procedure <grin> [20:15:44]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:18:17] :) [20:18:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:18:43] we have a webradio and lately we have streamed many parties online [20:18:43]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:19:04] and that's where the young sj's put it to the max also.. [20:19:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:19:27] impossible to get steady levels. bwhen nobody's there to mix [20:19:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:19:36] no authorities at least:) [20:19:36]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:19:47] sj's=dj's [20:19:47]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[20:21:48] mmm, i used to think streaming real/live sets was kickass, same as counterstrike via net, which a buddy was right into, i hated playing it, but liked the idea that we were in a dark room in the middle of the night watchign a screeen and a bunch of dudes all over the planet were doing the same with us, that kinda feeling [20:21:48]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[20:23:03] heh, in reality it wasn't so much the young or new djs that were like that, but the ones that been around a bit before all this techno/dance stuff was cool, and thought they were somehow way better at everything because of it, usually the ones that you didn't mind socially, but noone talked/listened to for real long, cos ya know, they were kinda dicks <grin> [20:23:03]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[20:24:29] i always liked the old ooooold kinda insult line for djs that needed some gentle punishing... "ya know, a few years ago in highschool, when we had a cool party, we'd pick the guy noone liked and make him dj all night so he didn't talk to us, he felt popular, win-win.... but now isn't a few years ago... hmmm, but you still in the corner dj'ing <cheeky grin>"  something along them lines [20:24:29]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[23:51:26] not that i saying it isn't kickass now btw, just that i ain't done it fer a long time [23:51:26]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[23:53:05] i thinkthe last one i was tech or playing involved with was probly before even the commercial's like traktor and wtf ever my sexy blue records are made for existed.... just getting that much b/w steady at a random venue letalone condemned/warehouse/forest kinda deal, needed a bit of planning ahead, and yeah, of course it was only 1 stream using a big far away server to spread it out for us :) [23:53:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[01:15:12] ffs stupid middle button ass ! (just quit half my channels with a lazy finger droop in a instant, and thanks to modern tech, this is the only time i'm forced to remember what channels i like anymore :( [01:15:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[01:15:31] wonder how awesome mr bouncer is today, maybe just completely get outta the client and see what reconnect does for me [01:15:31]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[01:17:20] erg, sigh, gotta think, sif that's why i got into computers and techwizardry :] [01:17:20]

2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:06:05] ... or maybe then if i over-use gain but that's different and not wise [20:06:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:08:32] i could share my 2 different recordings to demonstrate the harsh noise if anyone interested [20:08:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:08:49] second one is clipping 100x more but there is no audible error [20:08:49]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:09:03] first one does not clip much, but is noisy [20:09:03]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:09:49] and even if it doesnt clip when opened in audacity.. it still is occasionally noisy (that's when mixx volume bar goes red..) [20:09:49]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:10:22] yeah long story and difficult to investigate [20:10:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[20:12:21] like i say, cos it's generally assumed that any code handling audio will never see anything hit top or bottom literal max, it can cascade and go very ugly, sometimes on similar appearance (from user pov) paths... for example as i recall tascam pro dat tape recordey machines, popular in 90s for things like get from studio big-tape or new-digital-recordey-thinger in the studio, maybe mixed to "master" or already mixed just transferring, so it fit in a pocke [20:12:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[20:12:22] a cheap (not several hndred bucks of massive reel2reel heavy tape) tape and you could take it to get cheap diy-lkooking cds burnt somewhere ?:) [20:12:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[20:15:21] mmmm, tracking down tiny/occasional hits on something like that, specially if yer djing at the time, ain't super easy... this is why i grown very fond of compressors, often set pretty hard limiterey, specially in places where yer got ya know, a few 10kW's worth of subs that you know the young ass dj coming on next would happily drive louder and louder till the whole thing is a distorted effing whitewash of nothing, making him AND me look bad when everythi [20:15:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[20:15:21] smokes or melts, but if i leave my little hidden anti-idiot compressor locked in the not-dj rack somewhere, i can go have a few drinks or a nap in a truck , safe in the knowledge he can make himself sound bad, but not hurt my stuiffs :) [20:15:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[20:15:44] heh, kLOs didn't like my feelings on 90s studio procedure <grin> [20:15:44]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:18:17] :) [20:18:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:18:43] we have a webradio and lately we have streamed many parties online [20:18:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:19:04] and that's where the young sj's put it to the max also.. [20:19:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:19:27] impossible to get steady levels. bwhen nobody's there to mix [20:19:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:19:36] no authorities at least:) [20:19:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:19:47] sj's=dj's [20:19:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[20:21:48] mmm, i used to think streaming real/live sets was kickass, same as counterstrike via net, which a buddy was right into, i hated playing it, but liked the idea that we were in a dark room in the middle of the night watchign a screeen and a bunch of dudes all over the planet were doing the same with us, that kinda feeling [20:21:48]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[20:23:03] heh, in reality it wasn't so much the young or new djs that were like that, but the ones that been around a bit before all this techno/dance stuff was cool, and thought they were somehow way better at everything because of it, usually the ones that you didn't mind socially, but noone talked/listened to for real long, cos ya know, they were kinda dicks <grin> [20:23:03]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[20:24:29] i always liked the old ooooold kinda insult line for djs that needed some gentle punishing... "ya know, a few years ago in highschool, when we had a cool party, we'd pick the guy noone liked and make him dj all night so he didn't talk to us, he felt popular, win-win.... but now isn't a few years ago... hmmm, but you still in the corner dj'ing <cheeky grin>"  something along them lines [20:24:29]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[23:51:26] not that i saying it isn't kickass now btw, just that i ain't done it fer a long time [23:51:26]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[23:53:05] i thinkthe last one i was tech or playing involved with was probly before even the commercial's like traktor and wtf ever my sexy blue records are made for existed.... just getting that much b/w steady at a random venue letalone condemned/warehouse/forest kinda deal, needed a bit of planning ahead, and yeah, of course it was only 1 stream using a big far away server to spread it out for us :) [23:53:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[01:15:12] ffs stupid middle button ass ! (just quit half my channels with a lazy finger droop in a instant, and thanks to modern tech, this is the only time i'm forced to remember what channels i like anymore :( [01:15:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[01:15:31] wonder how awesome mr bouncer is today, maybe just completely get outta the client and see what reconnect does for me [01:15:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[01:17:20] erg, sigh, gotta think, sif that's why i got into computers and techwizardry :] [01:17:20]

2016-10-18 23:55:24	nko	[15:53:10] i'm searching some help with mixxx in a eeepc [15:53:10]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	nko	[15:53:41] i'm trying to solve a i915 bug [15:53:41]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[19:36:29] hmmm, what the b in b tech stands for ? [19:36:29]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[19:42:18] laama, err, latency should be irrelevant if you recording in a seperate app, cos yer ain't gonna be playing that recording back fer at least a few minutes,maybe weeks anyway, and if it clipping in digital land, buffer sizes/latency will make ZERO difference to that, the right way to fix things is to turn them down a bit so they don't clip.... and yeah, you'lll notice in some setups, like what you doing today, that clipping in digital land can kinda cause  [19:42:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[19:42:18] cascade eff-up due to going thru a series of stages/programming/virtual amp/attenuators or wtf you wanna call it, all programmed assuming no hard out-of-bits kinda clipping to be coming at them, which ya know, can make some huge ugly effect on one recording outpuut maybe, oooh, i not playeedd with it since they were "common", but i bet mp3/other compression wouldn't help that effect either.... annnnnyway, just don't let stuff clip, there's nothing good ab [19:42:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[19:42:19] it technically or in the real world, if yer want distortion get a pedal or effect or plugin, yer speakers and headphones and power amps and everything will thank you in the long run your case lik [19:42:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[19:42:40] oh, methinks logs have stooged me a bit on timing [19:42:40]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[19:44:57] theBear: yeah i recorded with audaciry and worked great. better than mixxx recording [19:44:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[19:56:55] laama, that's just coincidence cos something between the two is turning it down... there still only so many bits of data being passed around the machine, and when yer run outta them it's not cool, like when a shitty vidcam goes from dark to bright, and suddenly half of everything is just saturated max bright/white and yer can't see anymore, assuming digital examlpes all round, it's exactly like that [19:56:55]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[19:57:34] not that i defending mixxx, just ya know, cos i been a audio tech for so long, i feel people must understand and not be misled as to details at these times:) [19:57:34]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:03:38] yeah i think you are correct:) [20:03:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:03:47] i dont want to blame mixx either [20:03:47]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:05:38] i never get this harsh clipping when streaming or playing [20:05:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:06:05] ... or maybe then if i over-use gain but that's different and not wise [20:06:05]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:08:32] i could share my 2 different recordings to demonstrate the harsh noise if anyone interested [20:08:32]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:08:49] second one is clipping 100x more but there is no audible error [20:08:49]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:09:03] first one does not clip much, but is noisy [20:09:03]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:09:49] and even if it doesnt clip when opened in audacity.. it still is occasionally noisy (that's when mixx volume bar goes red..) [20:09:49]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:10:22] yeah long story and difficult to investigate [20:10:22]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[20:12:21] like i say, cos it's generally assumed that any code handling audio will never see anything hit top or bottom literal max, it can cascade and go very ugly, sometimes on similar appearance (from user pov) paths... for example as i recall tascam pro dat tape recordey machines, popular in 90s for things like get from studio big-tape or new-digital-recordey-thinger in the studio, maybe mixed to "master" or already mixed just transferring, so it fit in a pocke [20:12:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[20:12:22] a cheap (not several hndred bucks of massive reel2reel heavy tape) tape and you could take it to get cheap diy-lkooking cds burnt somewhere ?:) [20:12:22]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[20:15:21] mmmm, tracking down tiny/occasional hits on something like that, specially if yer djing at the time, ain't super easy... this is why i grown very fond of compressors, often set pretty hard limiterey, specially in places where yer got ya know, a few 10kW's worth of subs that you know the young ass dj coming on next would happily drive louder and louder till the whole thing is a distorted effing whitewash of nothing, making him AND me look bad when everythi [20:15:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[20:15:21] smokes or melts, but if i leave my little hidden anti-idiot compressor locked in the not-dj rack somewhere, i can go have a few drinks or a nap in a truck , safe in the knowledge he can make himself sound bad, but not hurt my stuiffs :) [20:15:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[20:15:44] heh, kLOs didn't like my feelings on 90s studio procedure <grin> [20:15:44]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:18:17] :) [20:18:17]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:18:43] we have a webradio and lately we have streamed many parties online [20:18:43]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:19:04] and that's where the young sj's put it to the max also.. [20:19:04]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:19:27] impossible to get steady levels. bwhen nobody's there to mix [20:19:27]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:19:36] no authorities at least:) [20:19:36]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:19:47] sj's=dj's [20:19:47]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[20:21:48] mmm, i used to think streaming real/live sets was kickass, same as counterstrike via net, which a buddy was right into, i hated playing it, but liked the idea that we were in a dark room in the middle of the night watchign a screeen and a bunch of dudes all over the planet were doing the same with us, that kinda feeling [20:21:48]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[20:23:03] heh, in reality it wasn't so much the young or new djs that were like that, but the ones that been around a bit before all this techno/dance stuff was cool, and thought they were somehow way better at everything because of it, usually the ones that you didn't mind socially, but noone talked/listened to for real long, cos ya know, they were kinda dicks <grin> [20:23:03]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[20:24:29] i always liked the old ooooold kinda insult line for djs that needed some gentle punishing... "ya know, a few years ago in highschool, when we had a cool party, we'd pick the guy noone liked and make him dj all night so he didn't talk to us, he felt popular, win-win.... but now isn't a few years ago... hmmm, but you still in the corner dj'ing <cheeky grin>"  something along them lines [20:24:29]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[23:51:26] not that i saying it isn't kickass now btw, just that i ain't done it fer a long time [23:51:26]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[23:53:05] i thinkthe last one i was tech or playing involved with was probly before even the commercial's like traktor and wtf ever my sexy blue records are made for existed.... just getting that much b/w steady at a random venue letalone condemned/warehouse/forest kinda deal, needed a bit of planning ahead, and yeah, of course it was only 1 stream using a big far away server to spread it out for us :) [23:53:05]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[01:15:12] ffs stupid middle button ass ! (just quit half my channels with a lazy finger droop in a instant, and thanks to modern tech, this is the only time i'm forced to remember what channels i like anymore :( [01:15:12]

2016-10-19 00:41:26	nko	[15:53:10] i'm searching some help with mixxx in a eeepc [15:53:10]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	nko	[15:53:41] i'm trying to solve a i915 bug [15:53:41]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	theBear	[19:36:29] hmmm, what the b in b tech stands for ? [19:36:29]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	theBear	[19:42:18] laama, err, latency should be irrelevant if you recording in a seperate app, cos yer ain't gonna be playing that recording back fer at least a few minutes,maybe weeks anyway, and if it clipping in digital land, buffer sizes/latency will make ZERO difference to that, the right way to fix things is to turn them down a bit so they don't clip.... and yeah, you'lll notice in some setups, like what you doing today, that clipping in digital land can kinda cause  [19:42:18]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	theBear	[19:42:18] cascade eff-up due to going thru a series of stages/programming/virtual amp/attenuators or wtf you wanna call it, all programmed assuming no hard out-of-bits kinda clipping to be coming at them, which ya know, can make some huge ugly effect on one recording outpuut maybe, oooh, i not playeedd with it since they were "common", but i bet mp3/other compression wouldn't help that effect either.... annnnnyway, just don't let stuff clip, there's nothing good ab [19:42:18]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	theBear	[19:42:19] it technically or in the real world, if yer want distortion get a pedal or effect or plugin, yer speakers and headphones and power amps and everything will thank you in the long run your case lik [19:42:19]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	theBear	[19:42:40] oh, methinks logs have stooged me a bit on timing [19:42:40]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	laama	[19:44:57] theBear: yeah i recorded with audaciry and worked great. better than mixxx recording [19:44:57]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	theBear	[19:56:55] laama, that's just coincidence cos something between the two is turning it down... there still only so many bits of data being passed around the machine, and when yer run outta them it's not cool, like when a shitty vidcam goes from dark to bright, and suddenly half of everything is just saturated max bright/white and yer can't see anymore, assuming digital examlpes all round, it's exactly like that [19:56:55]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	theBear	[19:57:34] not that i defending mixxx, just ya know, cos i been a audio tech for so long, i feel people must understand and not be misled as to details at these times:) [19:57:34]

2016-10-19 00:41:26	laama	[20:08:32] i could share my 2 different recordings to demonstrate the harsh noise if anyone interested [20:08:32]

2016-10-19 14:34:40	Raghvendra	[06:54:48] Hello, I am Raghvendra Rao and I am a first year B.Tech student. I want to contribute to Mixxx in GSoC  2017. I don't have any programming knowledge but I have passion to work hard for it. [06:54:48]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	nko	[15:52:46] hi [15:52:46]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	nko	[15:53:10] i'm searching some help with mixxx in a eeepc [15:53:10]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	nko	[15:53:41] i'm trying to solve a i915 bug [15:53:41]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[19:36:29] hmmm, what the b in b tech stands for ? [19:36:29]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[19:42:18] laama, err, latency should be irrelevant if you recording in a seperate app, cos yer ain't gonna be playing that recording back fer at least a few minutes,maybe weeks anyway, and if it clipping in digital land, buffer sizes/latency will make ZERO difference to that, the right way to fix things is to turn them down a bit so they don't clip.... and yeah, you'lll notice in some setups, like what you doing today, that clipping in digital land can kinda cause  [19:42:18]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[19:42:18] cascade eff-up due to going thru a series of stages/programming/virtual amp/attenuators or wtf you wanna call it, all programmed assuming no hard out-of-bits kinda clipping to be coming at them, which ya know, can make some huge ugly effect on one recording outpuut maybe, oooh, i not playeedd with it since they were "common", but i bet mp3/other compression wouldn't help that effect either.... annnnnyway, just don't let stuff clip, there's nothing good ab [19:42:18]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[19:42:19] it technically or in the real world, if yer want distortion get a pedal or effect or plugin, yer speakers and headphones and power amps and everything will thank you in the long run your case lik [19:42:19]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[19:42:40] oh, methinks logs have stooged me a bit on timing [19:42:40]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[19:44:57] theBear: yeah i recorded with audaciry and worked great. better than mixxx recording [19:44:57]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[19:56:55] laama, that's just coincidence cos something between the two is turning it down... there still only so many bits of data being passed around the machine, and when yer run outta them it's not cool, like when a shitty vidcam goes from dark to bright, and suddenly half of everything is just saturated max bright/white and yer can't see anymore, assuming digital examlpes all round, it's exactly like that [19:56:55]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[19:57:34] not that i defending mixxx, just ya know, cos i been a audio tech for so long, i feel people must understand and not be misled as to details at these times:) [19:57:34]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:03:38] yeah i think you are correct:) [20:03:38]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:03:47] i dont want to blame mixx either [20:03:47]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:05:38] i never get this harsh clipping when streaming or playing [20:05:38]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:06:05] ... or maybe then if i over-use gain but that's different and not wise [20:06:05]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:08:32] i could share my 2 different recordings to demonstrate the harsh noise if anyone interested [20:08:32]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:08:49] second one is clipping 100x more but there is no audible error [20:08:49]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:09:03] first one does not clip much, but is noisy [20:09:03]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:09:49] and even if it doesnt clip when opened in audacity.. it still is occasionally noisy (that's when mixx volume bar goes red..) [20:09:49]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:10:22] yeah long story and difficult to investigate [20:10:22]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[20:12:21] like i say, cos it's generally assumed that any code handling audio will never see anything hit top or bottom literal max, it can cascade and go very ugly, sometimes on similar appearance (from user pov) paths... for example as i recall tascam pro dat tape recordey machines, popular in 90s for things like get from studio big-tape or new-digital-recordey-thinger in the studio, maybe mixed to "master" or already mixed just transferring, so it fit in a pocke [20:12:21]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[20:12:22] a cheap (not several hndred bucks of massive reel2reel heavy tape) tape and you could take it to get cheap diy-lkooking cds burnt somewhere ?:) [20:12:22]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[20:15:21] mmmm, tracking down tiny/occasional hits on something like that, specially if yer djing at the time, ain't super easy... this is why i grown very fond of compressors, often set pretty hard limiterey, specially in places where yer got ya know, a few 10kW's worth of subs that you know the young ass dj coming on next would happily drive louder and louder till the whole thing is a distorted effing whitewash of nothing, making him AND me look bad when everythi [20:15:21]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[20:15:21] smokes or melts, but if i leave my little hidden anti-idiot compressor locked in the not-dj rack somewhere, i can go have a few drinks or a nap in a truck , safe in the knowledge he can make himself sound bad, but not hurt my stuiffs :) [20:15:21]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[20:15:44] heh, kLOs didn't like my feelings on 90s studio procedure <grin> [20:15:44]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:18:17] :) [20:18:17]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:18:43] we have a webradio and lately we have streamed many parties online [20:18:43]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:19:04] and that's where the young sj's put it to the max also.. [20:19:04]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:19:27] impossible to get steady levels. bwhen nobody's there to mix [20:19:27]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:19:36] no authorities at least:) [20:19:36]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:19:47] sj's=dj's [20:19:47]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[20:21:48] mmm, i used to think streaming real/live sets was kickass, same as counterstrike via net, which a buddy was right into, i hated playing it, but liked the idea that we were in a dark room in the middle of the night watchign a screeen and a bunch of dudes all over the planet were doing the same with us, that kinda feeling [20:21:48]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[20:23:03] heh, in reality it wasn't so much the young or new djs that were like that, but the ones that been around a bit before all this techno/dance stuff was cool, and thought they were somehow way better at everything because of it, usually the ones that you didn't mind socially, but noone talked/listened to for real long, cos ya know, they were kinda dicks <grin> [20:23:03]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[20:24:29] i always liked the old ooooold kinda insult line for djs that needed some gentle punishing... "ya know, a few years ago in highschool, when we had a cool party, we'd pick the guy noone liked and make him dj all night so he didn't talk to us, he felt popular, win-win.... but now isn't a few years ago... hmmm, but you still in the corner dj'ing <cheeky grin>"  something along them lines [20:24:29]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[23:51:26] not that i saying it isn't kickass now btw, just that i ain't done it fer a long time [23:51:26]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[23:53:05] i thinkthe last one i was tech or playing involved with was probly before even the commercial's like traktor and wtf ever my sexy blue records are made for existed.... just getting that much b/w steady at a random venue letalone condemned/warehouse/forest kinda deal, needed a bit of planning ahead, and yeah, of course it was only 1 stream using a big far away server to spread it out for us :) [23:53:05]
