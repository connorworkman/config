2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[18:30:15] increased latency to 90+ms and recorded with audacity.. perfect now [18:30:15]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[18:30:52] however this much latency affects what you hear from headphones pretty much [18:30:52]

2016-10-17 21:03:37	Raghvendra	[06:54:48] Hello, I am Raghvendra Rao and I am a first year B.Tech student. I want to contribute to Mixxx in GSoC  2017. I don't have any programming knowledge but I have passion to work hard for it. [06:54:48]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	nko	[15:52:46] hi [15:52:46]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	nko	[15:53:10] i'm searching some help with mixxx in a eeepc [15:53:10]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	nko	[15:53:41] i'm trying to solve a i915 bug [15:53:41]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[19:36:29] hmmm, what the b in b tech stands for ? [19:36:29]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[19:42:18] laama, err, latency should be irrelevant if you recording in a seperate app, cos yer ain't gonna be playing that recording back fer at least a few minutes,maybe weeks anyway, and if it clipping in digital land, buffer sizes/latency will make ZERO difference to that, the right way to fix things is to turn them down a bit so they don't clip.... and yeah, you'lll notice in some setups, like what you doing today, that clipping in digital land can kinda cause  [19:42:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[19:42:18] cascade eff-up due to going thru a series of stages/programming/virtual amp/attenuators or wtf you wanna call it, all programmed assuming no hard out-of-bits kinda clipping to be coming at them, which ya know, can make some huge ugly effect on one recording outpuut maybe, oooh, i not playeedd with it since they were "common", but i bet mp3/other compression wouldn't help that effect either.... annnnnyway, just don't let stuff clip, there's nothing good ab [19:42:18]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[19:42:19] it technically or in the real world, if yer want distortion get a pedal or effect or plugin, yer speakers and headphones and power amps and everything will thank you in the long run your case lik [19:42:19]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[19:42:40] oh, methinks logs have stooged me a bit on timing [19:42:40]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[19:44:57] theBear: yeah i recorded with audaciry and worked great. better than mixxx recording [19:44:57]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[19:56:55] laama, that's just coincidence cos something between the two is turning it down... there still only so many bits of data being passed around the machine, and when yer run outta them it's not cool, like when a shitty vidcam goes from dark to bright, and suddenly half of everything is just saturated max bright/white and yer can't see anymore, assuming digital examlpes all round, it's exactly like that [19:56:55]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[19:57:34] not that i defending mixxx, just ya know, cos i been a audio tech for so long, i feel people must understand and not be misled as to details at these times:) [19:57:34]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:03:38] yeah i think you are correct:) [20:03:38]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:03:47] i dont want to blame mixx either [20:03:47]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:05:38] i never get this harsh clipping when streaming or playing [20:05:38]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:06:05] ... or maybe then if i over-use gain but that's different and not wise [20:06:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:08:32] i could share my 2 different recordings to demonstrate the harsh noise if anyone interested [20:08:32]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:08:49] second one is clipping 100x more but there is no audible error [20:08:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:09:03] first one does not clip much, but is noisy [20:09:03]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:09:49] and even if it doesnt clip when opened in audacity.. it still is occasionally noisy (that's when mixx volume bar goes red..) [20:09:49]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:10:22] yeah long story and difficult to investigate [20:10:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[20:12:21] like i say, cos it's generally assumed that any code handling audio will never see anything hit top or bottom literal max, it can cascade and go very ugly, sometimes on similar appearance (from user pov) paths... for example as i recall tascam pro dat tape recordey machines, popular in 90s for things like get from studio big-tape or new-digital-recordey-thinger in the studio, maybe mixed to "master" or already mixed just transferring, so it fit in a pocke [20:12:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[20:12:22] a cheap (not several hndred bucks of massive reel2reel heavy tape) tape and you could take it to get cheap diy-lkooking cds burnt somewhere ?:) [20:12:22]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[20:15:21] mmmm, tracking down tiny/occasional hits on something like that, specially if yer djing at the time, ain't super easy... this is why i grown very fond of compressors, often set pretty hard limiterey, specially in places where yer got ya know, a few 10kW's worth of subs that you know the young ass dj coming on next would happily drive louder and louder till the whole thing is a distorted effing whitewash of nothing, making him AND me look bad when everythi [20:15:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[20:15:21] smokes or melts, but if i leave my little hidden anti-idiot compressor locked in the not-dj rack somewhere, i can go have a few drinks or a nap in a truck , safe in the knowledge he can make himself sound bad, but not hurt my stuiffs :) [20:15:21]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[20:15:44] heh, kLOs didn't like my feelings on 90s studio procedure <grin> [20:15:44]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:18:17] :) [20:18:17]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:18:43] we have a webradio and lately we have streamed many parties online [20:18:43]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:19:04] and that's where the young sj's put it to the max also.. [20:19:04]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:19:27] impossible to get steady levels. bwhen nobody's there to mix [20:19:27]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:19:36] no authorities at least:) [20:19:36]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	laama	[20:19:47] sj's=dj's [20:19:47]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[20:21:48] mmm, i used to think streaming real/live sets was kickass, same as counterstrike via net, which a buddy was right into, i hated playing it, but liked the idea that we were in a dark room in the middle of the night watchign a screeen and a bunch of dudes all over the planet were doing the same with us, that kinda feeling [20:21:48]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[20:23:03] heh, in reality it wasn't so much the young or new djs that were like that, but the ones that been around a bit before all this techno/dance stuff was cool, and thought they were somehow way better at everything because of it, usually the ones that you didn't mind socially, but noone talked/listened to for real long, cos ya know, they were kinda dicks <grin> [20:23:03]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[20:24:29] i always liked the old ooooold kinda insult line for djs that needed some gentle punishing... "ya know, a few years ago in highschool, when we had a cool party, we'd pick the guy noone liked and make him dj all night so he didn't talk to us, he felt popular, win-win.... but now isn't a few years ago... hmmm, but you still in the corner dj'ing <cheeky grin>"  something along them lines [20:24:29]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[23:51:26] not that i saying it isn't kickass now btw, just that i ain't done it fer a long time [23:51:26]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[23:53:05] i thinkthe last one i was tech or playing involved with was probly before even the commercial's like traktor and wtf ever my sexy blue records are made for existed.... just getting that much b/w steady at a random venue letalone condemned/warehouse/forest kinda deal, needed a bit of planning ahead, and yeah, of course it was only 1 stream using a big far away server to spread it out for us :) [23:53:05]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[01:15:12] ffs stupid middle button ass ! (just quit half my channels with a lazy finger droop in a instant, and thanks to modern tech, this is the only time i'm forced to remember what channels i like anymore :( [01:15:12]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[01:15:31] wonder how awesome mr bouncer is today, maybe just completely get outta the client and see what reconnect does for me [01:15:31]
2016-10-17 21:03:37	theBear	[01:17:20] erg, sigh, gotta think, sif that's why i got into computers and techwizardry :] [01:17:20]

2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:06:05] ... or maybe then if i over-use gain but that's different and not wise [20:06:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:08:32] i could share my 2 different recordings to demonstrate the harsh noise if anyone interested [20:08:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:08:49] second one is clipping 100x more but there is no audible error [20:08:49]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:09:03] first one does not clip much, but is noisy [20:09:03]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:09:49] and even if it doesnt clip when opened in audacity.. it still is occasionally noisy (that's when mixx volume bar goes red..) [20:09:49]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:10:22] yeah long story and difficult to investigate [20:10:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[20:12:21] like i say, cos it's generally assumed that any code handling audio will never see anything hit top or bottom literal max, it can cascade and go very ugly, sometimes on similar appearance (from user pov) paths... for example as i recall tascam pro dat tape recordey machines, popular in 90s for things like get from studio big-tape or new-digital-recordey-thinger in the studio, maybe mixed to "master" or already mixed just transferring, so it fit in a pocke [20:12:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[20:12:22] a cheap (not several hndred bucks of massive reel2reel heavy tape) tape and you could take it to get cheap diy-lkooking cds burnt somewhere ?:) [20:12:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[20:15:21] mmmm, tracking down tiny/occasional hits on something like that, specially if yer djing at the time, ain't super easy... this is why i grown very fond of compressors, often set pretty hard limiterey, specially in places where yer got ya know, a few 10kW's worth of subs that you know the young ass dj coming on next would happily drive louder and louder till the whole thing is a distorted effing whitewash of nothing, making him AND me look bad when everythi [20:15:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[20:15:21] smokes or melts, but if i leave my little hidden anti-idiot compressor locked in the not-dj rack somewhere, i can go have a few drinks or a nap in a truck , safe in the knowledge he can make himself sound bad, but not hurt my stuiffs :) [20:15:21]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[20:15:44] heh, kLOs didn't like my feelings on 90s studio procedure <grin> [20:15:44]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:18:17] :) [20:18:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:18:43] we have a webradio and lately we have streamed many parties online [20:18:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:19:04] and that's where the young sj's put it to the max also.. [20:19:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:19:27] impossible to get steady levels. bwhen nobody's there to mix [20:19:27]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:19:36] no authorities at least:) [20:19:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	laama	[20:19:47] sj's=dj's [20:19:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[20:21:48] mmm, i used to think streaming real/live sets was kickass, same as counterstrike via net, which a buddy was right into, i hated playing it, but liked the idea that we were in a dark room in the middle of the night watchign a screeen and a bunch of dudes all over the planet were doing the same with us, that kinda feeling [20:21:48]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[20:23:03] heh, in reality it wasn't so much the young or new djs that were like that, but the ones that been around a bit before all this techno/dance stuff was cool, and thought they were somehow way better at everything because of it, usually the ones that you didn't mind socially, but noone talked/listened to for real long, cos ya know, they were kinda dicks <grin> [20:23:03]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[20:24:29] i always liked the old ooooold kinda insult line for djs that needed some gentle punishing... "ya know, a few years ago in highschool, when we had a cool party, we'd pick the guy noone liked and make him dj all night so he didn't talk to us, he felt popular, win-win.... but now isn't a few years ago... hmmm, but you still in the corner dj'ing <cheeky grin>"  something along them lines [20:24:29]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[23:51:26] not that i saying it isn't kickass now btw, just that i ain't done it fer a long time [23:51:26]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[23:53:05] i thinkthe last one i was tech or playing involved with was probly before even the commercial's like traktor and wtf ever my sexy blue records are made for existed.... just getting that much b/w steady at a random venue letalone condemned/warehouse/forest kinda deal, needed a bit of planning ahead, and yeah, of course it was only 1 stream using a big far away server to spread it out for us :) [23:53:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[01:15:12] ffs stupid middle button ass ! (just quit half my channels with a lazy finger droop in a instant, and thanks to modern tech, this is the only time i'm forced to remember what channels i like anymore :( [01:15:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[01:15:31] wonder how awesome mr bouncer is today, maybe just completely get outta the client and see what reconnect does for me [01:15:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:25	theBear	[01:17:20] erg, sigh, gotta think, sif that's why i got into computers and techwizardry :] [01:17:20]

2016-10-18 23:55:24	nko	[15:53:10] i'm searching some help with mixxx in a eeepc [15:53:10]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	nko	[15:53:41] i'm trying to solve a i915 bug [15:53:41]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[19:36:29] hmmm, what the b in b tech stands for ? [19:36:29]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[19:42:18] laama, err, latency should be irrelevant if you recording in a seperate app, cos yer ain't gonna be playing that recording back fer at least a few minutes,maybe weeks anyway, and if it clipping in digital land, buffer sizes/latency will make ZERO difference to that, the right way to fix things is to turn them down a bit so they don't clip.... and yeah, you'lll notice in some setups, like what you doing today, that clipping in digital land can kinda cause  [19:42:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[19:42:18] cascade eff-up due to going thru a series of stages/programming/virtual amp/attenuators or wtf you wanna call it, all programmed assuming no hard out-of-bits kinda clipping to be coming at them, which ya know, can make some huge ugly effect on one recording outpuut maybe, oooh, i not playeedd with it since they were "common", but i bet mp3/other compression wouldn't help that effect either.... annnnnyway, just don't let stuff clip, there's nothing good ab [19:42:18]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[19:42:19] it technically or in the real world, if yer want distortion get a pedal or effect or plugin, yer speakers and headphones and power amps and everything will thank you in the long run your case lik [19:42:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[19:42:40] oh, methinks logs have stooged me a bit on timing [19:42:40]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[19:44:57] theBear: yeah i recorded with audaciry and worked great. better than mixxx recording [19:44:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[19:56:55] laama, that's just coincidence cos something between the two is turning it down... there still only so many bits of data being passed around the machine, and when yer run outta them it's not cool, like when a shitty vidcam goes from dark to bright, and suddenly half of everything is just saturated max bright/white and yer can't see anymore, assuming digital examlpes all round, it's exactly like that [19:56:55]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[19:57:34] not that i defending mixxx, just ya know, cos i been a audio tech for so long, i feel people must understand and not be misled as to details at these times:) [19:57:34]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:03:38] yeah i think you are correct:) [20:03:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:03:47] i dont want to blame mixx either [20:03:47]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:05:38] i never get this harsh clipping when streaming or playing [20:05:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:06:05] ... or maybe then if i over-use gain but that's different and not wise [20:06:05]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:08:32] i could share my 2 different recordings to demonstrate the harsh noise if anyone interested [20:08:32]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:08:49] second one is clipping 100x more but there is no audible error [20:08:49]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:09:03] first one does not clip much, but is noisy [20:09:03]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:09:49] and even if it doesnt clip when opened in audacity.. it still is occasionally noisy (that's when mixx volume bar goes red..) [20:09:49]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:10:22] yeah long story and difficult to investigate [20:10:22]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[20:12:21] like i say, cos it's generally assumed that any code handling audio will never see anything hit top or bottom literal max, it can cascade and go very ugly, sometimes on similar appearance (from user pov) paths... for example as i recall tascam pro dat tape recordey machines, popular in 90s for things like get from studio big-tape or new-digital-recordey-thinger in the studio, maybe mixed to "master" or already mixed just transferring, so it fit in a pocke [20:12:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[20:12:22] a cheap (not several hndred bucks of massive reel2reel heavy tape) tape and you could take it to get cheap diy-lkooking cds burnt somewhere ?:) [20:12:22]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[20:15:21] mmmm, tracking down tiny/occasional hits on something like that, specially if yer djing at the time, ain't super easy... this is why i grown very fond of compressors, often set pretty hard limiterey, specially in places where yer got ya know, a few 10kW's worth of subs that you know the young ass dj coming on next would happily drive louder and louder till the whole thing is a distorted effing whitewash of nothing, making him AND me look bad when everythi [20:15:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[20:15:21] smokes or melts, but if i leave my little hidden anti-idiot compressor locked in the not-dj rack somewhere, i can go have a few drinks or a nap in a truck , safe in the knowledge he can make himself sound bad, but not hurt my stuiffs :) [20:15:21]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[20:15:44] heh, kLOs didn't like my feelings on 90s studio procedure <grin> [20:15:44]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:18:17] :) [20:18:17]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:18:43] we have a webradio and lately we have streamed many parties online [20:18:43]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:19:04] and that's where the young sj's put it to the max also.. [20:19:04]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:19:27] impossible to get steady levels. bwhen nobody's there to mix [20:19:27]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:19:36] no authorities at least:) [20:19:36]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	laama	[20:19:47] sj's=dj's [20:19:47]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[20:21:48] mmm, i used to think streaming real/live sets was kickass, same as counterstrike via net, which a buddy was right into, i hated playing it, but liked the idea that we were in a dark room in the middle of the night watchign a screeen and a bunch of dudes all over the planet were doing the same with us, that kinda feeling [20:21:48]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[20:23:03] heh, in reality it wasn't so much the young or new djs that were like that, but the ones that been around a bit before all this techno/dance stuff was cool, and thought they were somehow way better at everything because of it, usually the ones that you didn't mind socially, but noone talked/listened to for real long, cos ya know, they were kinda dicks <grin> [20:23:03]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[20:24:29] i always liked the old ooooold kinda insult line for djs that needed some gentle punishing... "ya know, a few years ago in highschool, when we had a cool party, we'd pick the guy noone liked and make him dj all night so he didn't talk to us, he felt popular, win-win.... but now isn't a few years ago... hmmm, but you still in the corner dj'ing <cheeky grin>"  something along them lines [20:24:29]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[23:51:26] not that i saying it isn't kickass now btw, just that i ain't done it fer a long time [23:51:26]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[23:53:05] i thinkthe last one i was tech or playing involved with was probly before even the commercial's like traktor and wtf ever my sexy blue records are made for existed.... just getting that much b/w steady at a random venue letalone condemned/warehouse/forest kinda deal, needed a bit of planning ahead, and yeah, of course it was only 1 stream using a big far away server to spread it out for us :) [23:53:05]
2016-10-18 23:55:24	theBear	[01:15:12] ffs stupid middle button ass ! (just quit half my channels with a lazy finger droop in a instant, and thanks to modern tech, this is the only time i'm forced to remember what channels i like anymore :( [01:15:12]

2016-10-19 00:41:26	nko	[15:53:10] i'm searching some help with mixxx in a eeepc [15:53:10]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	nko	[15:53:41] i'm trying to solve a i915 bug [15:53:41]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	theBear	[19:36:29] hmmm, what the b in b tech stands for ? [19:36:29]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	theBear	[19:42:18] laama, err, latency should be irrelevant if you recording in a seperate app, cos yer ain't gonna be playing that recording back fer at least a few minutes,maybe weeks anyway, and if it clipping in digital land, buffer sizes/latency will make ZERO difference to that, the right way to fix things is to turn them down a bit so they don't clip.... and yeah, you'lll notice in some setups, like what you doing today, that clipping in digital land can kinda cause  [19:42:18]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	theBear	[19:42:18] cascade eff-up due to going thru a series of stages/programming/virtual amp/attenuators or wtf you wanna call it, all programmed assuming no hard out-of-bits kinda clipping to be coming at them, which ya know, can make some huge ugly effect on one recording outpuut maybe, oooh, i not playeedd with it since they were "common", but i bet mp3/other compression wouldn't help that effect either.... annnnnyway, just don't let stuff clip, there's nothing good ab [19:42:18]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	theBear	[19:42:19] it technically or in the real world, if yer want distortion get a pedal or effect or plugin, yer speakers and headphones and power amps and everything will thank you in the long run your case lik [19:42:19]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	theBear	[19:42:40] oh, methinks logs have stooged me a bit on timing [19:42:40]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	laama	[19:44:57] theBear: yeah i recorded with audaciry and worked great. better than mixxx recording [19:44:57]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	theBear	[19:56:55] laama, that's just coincidence cos something between the two is turning it down... there still only so many bits of data being passed around the machine, and when yer run outta them it's not cool, like when a shitty vidcam goes from dark to bright, and suddenly half of everything is just saturated max bright/white and yer can't see anymore, assuming digital examlpes all round, it's exactly like that [19:56:55]
2016-10-19 00:41:26	theBear	[19:57:34] not that i defending mixxx, just ya know, cos i been a audio tech for so long, i feel people must understand and not be misled as to details at these times:) [19:57:34]

2016-10-19 00:41:26	laama	[20:08:32] i could share my 2 different recordings to demonstrate the harsh noise if anyone interested [20:08:32]

2016-10-19 14:34:40	Raghvendra	[06:54:48] Hello, I am Raghvendra Rao and I am a first year B.Tech student. I want to contribute to Mixxx in GSoC  2017. I don't have any programming knowledge but I have passion to work hard for it. [06:54:48]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	nko	[15:52:46] hi [15:52:46]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	nko	[15:53:10] i'm searching some help with mixxx in a eeepc [15:53:10]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	nko	[15:53:41] i'm trying to solve a i915 bug [15:53:41]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[19:36:29] hmmm, what the b in b tech stands for ? [19:36:29]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[19:42:18] laama, err, latency should be irrelevant if you recording in a seperate app, cos yer ain't gonna be playing that recording back fer at least a few minutes,maybe weeks anyway, and if it clipping in digital land, buffer sizes/latency will make ZERO difference to that, the right way to fix things is to turn them down a bit so they don't clip.... and yeah, you'lll notice in some setups, like what you doing today, that clipping in digital land can kinda cause  [19:42:18]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[19:42:18] cascade eff-up due to going thru a series of stages/programming/virtual amp/attenuators or wtf you wanna call it, all programmed assuming no hard out-of-bits kinda clipping to be coming at them, which ya know, can make some huge ugly effect on one recording outpuut maybe, oooh, i not playeedd with it since they were "common", but i bet mp3/other compression wouldn't help that effect either.... annnnnyway, just don't let stuff clip, there's nothing good ab [19:42:18]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[19:42:19] it technically or in the real world, if yer want distortion get a pedal or effect or plugin, yer speakers and headphones and power amps and everything will thank you in the long run your case lik [19:42:19]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[19:42:40] oh, methinks logs have stooged me a bit on timing [19:42:40]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[19:44:57] theBear: yeah i recorded with audaciry and worked great. better than mixxx recording [19:44:57]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[19:56:55] laama, that's just coincidence cos something between the two is turning it down... there still only so many bits of data being passed around the machine, and when yer run outta them it's not cool, like when a shitty vidcam goes from dark to bright, and suddenly half of everything is just saturated max bright/white and yer can't see anymore, assuming digital examlpes all round, it's exactly like that [19:56:55]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[19:57:34] not that i defending mixxx, just ya know, cos i been a audio tech for so long, i feel people must understand and not be misled as to details at these times:) [19:57:34]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:03:38] yeah i think you are correct:) [20:03:38]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:03:47] i dont want to blame mixx either [20:03:47]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:05:38] i never get this harsh clipping when streaming or playing [20:05:38]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:06:05] ... or maybe then if i over-use gain but that's different and not wise [20:06:05]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:08:32] i could share my 2 different recordings to demonstrate the harsh noise if anyone interested [20:08:32]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:08:49] second one is clipping 100x more but there is no audible error [20:08:49]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:09:03] first one does not clip much, but is noisy [20:09:03]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:09:49] and even if it doesnt clip when opened in audacity.. it still is occasionally noisy (that's when mixx volume bar goes red..) [20:09:49]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:10:22] yeah long story and difficult to investigate [20:10:22]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[20:12:21] like i say, cos it's generally assumed that any code handling audio will never see anything hit top or bottom literal max, it can cascade and go very ugly, sometimes on similar appearance (from user pov) paths... for example as i recall tascam pro dat tape recordey machines, popular in 90s for things like get from studio big-tape or new-digital-recordey-thinger in the studio, maybe mixed to "master" or already mixed just transferring, so it fit in a pocke [20:12:21]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[20:12:22] a cheap (not several hndred bucks of massive reel2reel heavy tape) tape and you could take it to get cheap diy-lkooking cds burnt somewhere ?:) [20:12:22]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[20:15:21] mmmm, tracking down tiny/occasional hits on something like that, specially if yer djing at the time, ain't super easy... this is why i grown very fond of compressors, often set pretty hard limiterey, specially in places where yer got ya know, a few 10kW's worth of subs that you know the young ass dj coming on next would happily drive louder and louder till the whole thing is a distorted effing whitewash of nothing, making him AND me look bad when everythi [20:15:21]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[20:15:21] smokes or melts, but if i leave my little hidden anti-idiot compressor locked in the not-dj rack somewhere, i can go have a few drinks or a nap in a truck , safe in the knowledge he can make himself sound bad, but not hurt my stuiffs :) [20:15:21]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[20:15:44] heh, kLOs didn't like my feelings on 90s studio procedure <grin> [20:15:44]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:18:17] :) [20:18:17]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:18:43] we have a webradio and lately we have streamed many parties online [20:18:43]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:19:04] and that's where the young sj's put it to the max also.. [20:19:04]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:19:27] impossible to get steady levels. bwhen nobody's there to mix [20:19:27]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:19:36] no authorities at least:) [20:19:36]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	laama	[20:19:47] sj's=dj's [20:19:47]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[20:21:48] mmm, i used to think streaming real/live sets was kickass, same as counterstrike via net, which a buddy was right into, i hated playing it, but liked the idea that we were in a dark room in the middle of the night watchign a screeen and a bunch of dudes all over the planet were doing the same with us, that kinda feeling [20:21:48]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[20:23:03] heh, in reality it wasn't so much the young or new djs that were like that, but the ones that been around a bit before all this techno/dance stuff was cool, and thought they were somehow way better at everything because of it, usually the ones that you didn't mind socially, but noone talked/listened to for real long, cos ya know, they were kinda dicks <grin> [20:23:03]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[20:24:29] i always liked the old ooooold kinda insult line for djs that needed some gentle punishing... "ya know, a few years ago in highschool, when we had a cool party, we'd pick the guy noone liked and make him dj all night so he didn't talk to us, he felt popular, win-win.... but now isn't a few years ago... hmmm, but you still in the corner dj'ing <cheeky grin>"  something along them lines [20:24:29]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[23:51:26] not that i saying it isn't kickass now btw, just that i ain't done it fer a long time [23:51:26]
2016-10-19 14:34:40	theBear	[23:53:05] i thinkthe last one i was tech or playing involved with was probly before even the commercial's like traktor and wtf ever my sexy blue records are made for existed.... just getting that much b/w steady at a random venue letalone condemned/warehouse/forest kinda deal, needed a bit of planning ahead, and yeah, of course it was only 1 stream using a big far away server to spread it out for us :) [23:53:05]

2016-10-19 20:40:05	Raghvendra	[06:54:48] Hello, I am Raghvendra Rao and I am a first year B.Tech student. I want to contribute to Mixxx in GSoC  2017. I don't have any programming knowledge but I have passion to work hard for it. [06:54:48]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	nko	[15:52:46] hi [15:52:46]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	nko	[15:53:10] i'm searching some help with mixxx in a eeepc [15:53:10]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	nko	[15:53:41] i'm trying to solve a i915 bug [15:53:41]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theBear	[19:36:29] hmmm, what the b in b tech stands for ? [19:36:29]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theBear	[19:42:18] laama, err, latency should be irrelevant if you recording in a seperate app, cos yer ain't gonna be playing that recording back fer at least a few minutes,maybe weeks anyway, and if it clipping in digital land, buffer sizes/latency will make ZERO difference to that, the right way to fix things is to turn them down a bit so they don't clip.... and yeah, you'lll notice in some setups, like what you doing today, that clipping in digital land can kinda cause  [19:42:18]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theBear	[19:42:18] cascade eff-up due to going thru a series of stages/programming/virtual amp/attenuators or wtf you wanna call it, all programmed assuming no hard out-of-bits kinda clipping to be coming at them, which ya know, can make some huge ugly effect on one recording outpuut maybe, oooh, i not playeedd with it since they were "common", but i bet mp3/other compression wouldn't help that effect either.... annnnnyway, just don't let stuff clip, there's nothing good ab [19:42:18]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theBear	[19:42:19] it technically or in the real world, if yer want distortion get a pedal or effect or plugin, yer speakers and headphones and power amps and everything will thank you in the long run your case lik [19:42:19]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theBear	[19:42:40] oh, methinks logs have stooged me a bit on timing [19:42:40]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	laama	[19:44:57] theBear: yeah i recorded with audaciry and worked great. better than mixxx recording [19:44:57]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theBear	[19:56:55] laama, that's just coincidence cos something between the two is turning it down... there still only so many bits of data being passed around the machine, and when yer run outta them it's not cool, like when a shitty vidcam goes from dark to bright, and suddenly half of everything is just saturated max bright/white and yer can't see anymore, assuming digital examlpes all round, it's exactly like that [19:56:55]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theBear	[19:57:34] not that i defending mixxx, just ya know, cos i been a audio tech for so long, i feel people must understand and not be misled as to details at these times:) [19:57:34]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	laama	[20:03:38] yeah i think you are correct:) [20:03:38]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	laama	[20:03:47] i dont want to blame mixx either [20:03:47]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	laama	[20:05:38] i never get this harsh clipping when streaming or playing [20:05:38]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	laama	[20:06:05] ... or maybe then if i over-use gain but that's different and not wise [20:06:05]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	laama	[20:08:32] i could share my 2 different recordings to demonstrate the harsh noise if anyone interested [20:08:32]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	laama	[20:08:49] second one is clipping 100x more but there is no audible error [20:08:49]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	laama	[20:09:03] first one does not clip much, but is noisy [20:09:03]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	laama	[20:09:49] and even if it doesnt clip when opened in audacity.. it still is occasionally noisy (that's when mixx volume bar goes red..) [20:09:49]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	laama	[20:10:22] yeah long story and difficult to investigate [20:10:22]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theBear	[20:12:21] like i say, cos it's generally assumed that any code handling audio will never see anything hit top or bottom literal max, it can cascade and go very ugly, sometimes on similar appearance (from user pov) paths... for example as i recall tascam pro dat tape recordey machines, popular in 90s for things like get from studio big-tape or new-digital-recordey-thinger in the studio, maybe mixed to "master" or already mixed just transferring, so it fit in a pocke [20:12:21]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theBear	[20:12:22] a cheap (not several hndred bucks of massive reel2reel heavy tape) tape and you could take it to get cheap diy-lkooking cds burnt somewhere ?:) [20:12:22]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theBear	[20:15:21] mmmm, tracking down tiny/occasional hits on something like that, specially if yer djing at the time, ain't super easy... this is why i grown very fond of compressors, often set pretty hard limiterey, specially in places where yer got ya know, a few 10kW's worth of subs that you know the young ass dj coming on next would happily drive louder and louder till the whole thing is a distorted effing whitewash of nothing, making him AND me look bad when everythi [20:15:21]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theBear	[20:15:21] smokes or melts, but if i leave my little hidden anti-idiot compressor locked in the not-dj rack somewhere, i can go have a few drinks or a nap in a truck , safe in the knowledge he can make himself sound bad, but not hurt my stuiffs :) [20:15:21]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theBear	[20:15:44] heh, kLOs didn't like my feelings on 90s studio procedure <grin> [20:15:44]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	laama	[20:18:17] :) [20:18:17]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	laama	[20:18:43] we have a webradio and lately we have streamed many parties online [20:18:43]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	laama	[20:19:04] and that's where the young sj's put it to the max also.. [20:19:04]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	laama	[20:19:27] impossible to get steady levels. bwhen nobody's there to mix [20:19:27]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	laama	[20:19:36] no authorities at least:) [20:19:36]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	laama	[20:19:47] sj's=dj's [20:19:47]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theBear	[20:21:48] mmm, i used to think streaming real/live sets was kickass, same as counterstrike via net, which a buddy was right into, i hated playing it, but liked the idea that we were in a dark room in the middle of the night watchign a screeen and a bunch of dudes all over the planet were doing the same with us, that kinda feeling [20:21:48]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theBear	[20:23:03] heh, in reality it wasn't so much the young or new djs that were like that, but the ones that been around a bit before all this techno/dance stuff was cool, and thought they were somehow way better at everything because of it, usually the ones that you didn't mind socially, but noone talked/listened to for real long, cos ya know, they were kinda dicks <grin> [20:23:03]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theBear	[20:24:29] i always liked the old ooooold kinda insult line for djs that needed some gentle punishing... "ya know, a few years ago in highschool, when we had a cool party, we'd pick the guy noone liked and make him dj all night so he didn't talk to us, he felt popular, win-win.... but now isn't a few years ago... hmmm, but you still in the corner dj'ing <cheeky grin>"  something along them lines [20:24:29]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theBear	[23:51:26] not that i saying it isn't kickass now btw, just that i ain't done it fer a long time [23:51:26]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theBear	[23:53:05] i thinkthe last one i was tech or playing involved with was probly before even the commercial's like traktor and wtf ever my sexy blue records are made for existed.... just getting that much b/w steady at a random venue letalone condemned/warehouse/forest kinda deal, needed a bit of planning ahead, and yeah, of course it was only 1 stream using a big far away server to spread it out for us :) [23:53:05]
2016-10-19 20:40:05	theBear	[01:15:12] ffs stupid middle button ass ! (just quit half my channels with a lazy finger droop in a instant, and thanks to modern tech, this is the only time i'm forced to remember what channels i like anymore :( [01:15:12]

2016-10-20 00:25:35	theBear	[20:15:21] smokes or melts, but if i leave my little hidden anti-idiot compressor locked in the not-dj rack somewhere, i can go have a few drinks or a nap in a truck , safe in the knowledge he can make himself sound bad, but not hurt my stuiffs :) [20:15:21]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	theBear	[20:15:44] heh, kLOs didn't like my feelings on 90s studio procedure <grin> [20:15:44]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	laama	[20:18:17] :) [20:18:17]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	laama	[20:18:43] we have a webradio and lately we have streamed many parties online [20:18:43]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	laama	[20:19:04] and that's where the young sj's put it to the max also.. [20:19:04]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	laama	[20:19:27] impossible to get steady levels. bwhen nobody's there to mix [20:19:27]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	laama	[20:19:36] no authorities at least:) [20:19:36]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	laama	[20:19:47] sj's=dj's [20:19:47]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	theBear	[20:21:48] mmm, i used to think streaming real/live sets was kickass, same as counterstrike via net, which a buddy was right into, i hated playing it, but liked the idea that we were in a dark room in the middle of the night watchign a screeen and a bunch of dudes all over the planet were doing the same with us, that kinda feeling [20:21:48]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	theBear	[20:23:03] heh, in reality it wasn't so much the young or new djs that were like that, but the ones that been around a bit before all this techno/dance stuff was cool, and thought they were somehow way better at everything because of it, usually the ones that you didn't mind socially, but noone talked/listened to for real long, cos ya know, they were kinda dicks <grin> [20:23:03]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	theBear	[20:24:29] i always liked the old ooooold kinda insult line for djs that needed some gentle punishing... "ya know, a few years ago in highschool, when we had a cool party, we'd pick the guy noone liked and make him dj all night so he didn't talk to us, he felt popular, win-win.... but now isn't a few years ago... hmmm, but you still in the corner dj'ing <cheeky grin>"  something along them lines [20:24:29]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	theBear	[23:51:26] not that i saying it isn't kickass now btw, just that i ain't done it fer a long time [23:51:26]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	theBear	[23:53:05] i thinkthe last one i was tech or playing involved with was probly before even the commercial's like traktor and wtf ever my sexy blue records are made for existed.... just getting that much b/w steady at a random venue letalone condemned/warehouse/forest kinda deal, needed a bit of planning ahead, and yeah, of course it was only 1 stream using a big far away server to spread it out for us :) [23:53:05]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	theBear	[01:15:12] ffs stupid middle button ass ! (just quit half my channels with a lazy finger droop in a instant, and thanks to modern tech, this is the only time i'm forced to remember what channels i like anymore :( [01:15:12]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	theBear	[01:15:31] wonder how awesome mr bouncer is today, maybe just completely get outta the client and see what reconnect does for me [01:15:31]
2016-10-20 00:25:35	theBear	[01:17:20] erg, sigh, gotta think, sif that's why i got into computers and techwizardry :] [01:17:20]

2016-10-21 10:37:53	Lawrence_	hello is there anyone here who could help me with mixxx?
2016-10-21 10:38:36	laama	i'm awake but not teh Master
2016-10-21 10:38:41	Lawrence_	It suddenly stops broadcasting my stream's in the middle of a set and I have no clue as to why it's doing that.
2016-10-21 10:38:56	Lawrence_	Ah it's okay, I understand completely.
2016-10-21 10:39:14	laama	first time or does it happen often?
2016-10-21 10:39:22	Lawrence_	Happened a few times
2016-10-21 10:39:34	Lawrence_	but this was the first time it just stopped infront of a live set
2016-10-21 10:39:50	Lawrence_	I actually had to switch to a back up program, but I am wanting a program for voice overs, and direct broadcasting.
2016-10-21 10:40:46	Lawrence_	Any ideas on what could be causing it to just stop broadcasting like that?
2016-10-21 10:41:28	laama	i've had pretty steady in streaming with mixxx.. some cases would be "out of memory" when/if you are recording also..
2016-10-21 10:41:34	laama	(just a guess)
2016-10-21 10:41:44	Lawrence_	I was trying to record at the time it crashed yes
2016-10-21 10:42:07	laama	when mixxx is recording i suppose it saves the record in RAM
2016-10-21 10:42:15	Lawrence_	Is there any way I could increase the memory allocated to it? I have 12GB of RAM
2016-10-21 10:42:18	laama	and it's about 1 GB / hour
2016-10-21 10:42:33	Lawrence_	I was only playing for 2 hours
2016-10-21 10:43:02	laama	there is also this 2GB limit.. let me check if it's the default. "split recording after every X giga/hours" or somethinh
2016-10-21 10:43:11	laama	then it starts to write the recording to Hard drive
2016-10-21 10:43:45	Lawrence_	Well if it just writes to Hard Drive that would be great too
2016-10-21 10:44:01	laama	i have "split recordings after 4GB".. but when writing 2 GB recording to HDD it takes some serious time
2016-10-21 10:44:01	Lawrence_	As I have a terabyte in hard drive space
2016-10-21 10:44:33	laama	(or 4gb recording.. i have it 4GB because i have 10 GB ram
2016-10-21 10:45:10	Lawrence_	I have mine set to 4gb as well
2016-10-21 10:45:36	laama	well ok, that should equal 4 hours.. if it's 16bit and 44khz sound)
2016-10-21 10:46:40	Lawrence_	16 bit?
2016-10-21 10:46:44	Lawrence_	I have it at 48khz
2016-10-21 10:47:24	laama	yeah 16bit is not settable but samplerate is.. but 48khz should not make that much difference
2016-10-21 10:47:33	laama	so the problem might be somewhere else
2016-10-21 10:47:46	Lawrence_	My audio buffer is having to be way up too
2016-10-21 10:47:52	Lawrence_	even though I have the RAM for it
2016-10-21 10:48:04	Lawrence_	85.3ms is my audio buffer that's ridiculous
2016-10-21 10:48:20	Lawrence_	I've had other programs that will have my audio buffer set to easily 10.5ms or less
2016-10-21 10:48:27	laama	yeah that's a lot.
2016-10-21 10:49:08	Lawrence_	Yeah it is, and if I turn it down i get clipping issues
2016-10-21 10:49:24	laama	recently i just recorded a 1+ hour set with 46.4ms buffer and that was not enough buffer for my hardware. instead.. i then recorded it with another program (audacity) and i got it better.. not so much clipping in my case)
2016-10-21 10:49:27	Lawrence_	which is absolutely absurd because on the other DJ programs I've tried I could get it down to a at the least 10 ms
2016-10-21 10:49:59	laama	(i mean.. there was clipping but not so disruptive as recording with mixxx)
2016-10-21 10:55:00		[10:49]
2016-10-21 10:56:09	Lawrence_	hmmm
2016-10-21 10:56:17	Lawrence_	well it was very disruptive to me honestly
2016-10-21 10:56:22	Lawrence_	It stopped my whole stream in the middle of it
2016-10-21 10:56:56	Lawrence_	I had streamed for 45minutes which was only 15minutes away from my half time. That's why I'm worried about using this program again and trying to figure out the issues with it.
2016-10-21 11:02:00		[10:56]
2016-10-21 11:07:23	Lawrence_	If you know of any way we could fix this that would be awesome

2016-10-21 11:49:29	laama	i've played many but not recorded, maybe you could try without recording or.. recording with audacity.. that would require correct settings.. ASIO would cause troubles then
2016-10-21 11:49:43	laama	but i dont have other ideas right now :P
2016-10-21 11:50:49	laama	my idea doesn't really answer the problem
2016-10-21 11:51:29	laama	(but im also pretty sure you dont use ASIO)

2016-10-24 22:59:40	Lawrence_	[20:40:46] Any ideas on what could be causing it to just stop broadcasting like that? [20:40:46]
2016-10-24 22:59:40	laama	[20:41:28] i've had pretty steady in streaming with mixxx.. some cases would be "out of memory" when/if you are recording also.. [20:41:28]
2016-10-24 22:59:40	laama	[20:41:34] (just a guess) [20:41:34]
2016-10-24 22:59:40	Lawrence_	[20:41:44] I was trying to record at the time it crashed yes [20:41:44]
2016-10-24 22:59:40	laama	[20:42:07] when mixxx is recording i suppose it saves the record in RAM [20:42:07]
2016-10-24 22:59:40	Lawrence_	[20:42:15] Is there any way I could increase the memory allocated to it? I have 12GB of RAM [20:42:15]
2016-10-24 22:59:40	laama	[20:42:18] and it's about 1 GB / hour [20:42:18]
2016-10-24 22:59:40	Lawrence_	[20:42:33] I was only playing for 2 hours [20:42:33]
2016-10-24 22:59:40	laama	[20:43:02] there is also this 2GB limit.. let me check if it's the default. "split recording after every X giga/hours" or somethinh [20:43:02]
2016-10-24 22:59:40	laama	[20:43:11] then it starts to write the recording to Hard drive [20:43:11]
2016-10-24 22:59:40	Lawrence_	[20:43:45] Well if it just writes to Hard Drive that would be great too [20:43:45]
2016-10-24 22:59:40	laama	[20:44:01] i have "split recordings after 4GB".. but when writing 2 GB recording to HDD it takes some serious time [20:44:01]
2016-10-24 22:59:40	Lawrence_	[20:44:01] As I have a terabyte in hard drive space [20:44:01]
2016-10-24 22:59:40	laama	[20:44:33] (or 4gb recording.. i have it 4GB because i have 10 GB ram [20:44:33]
2016-10-24 22:59:40	Lawrence_	[20:45:10] I have mine set to 4gb as well [20:45:10]
2016-10-24 22:59:40	laama	[20:45:36] well ok, that should equal 4 hours.. if it's 16bit and 44khz sound) [20:45:36]
2016-10-24 22:59:40	Lawrence_	[20:46:40] 16 bit? [20:46:40]
2016-10-24 22:59:40	Lawrence_	[20:46:44] I have it at 48khz [20:46:44]
2016-10-24 22:59:40	laama	[20:47:24] yeah 16bit is not settable but samplerate is.. but 48khz should not make that much difference [20:47:24]
2016-10-24 22:59:40	laama	[20:47:33] so the problem might be somewhere else [20:47:33]
2016-10-24 22:59:40	Lawrence_	[20:47:46] My audio buffer is having to be way up too [20:47:46]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	Lawrence_	[20:47:52] even though I have the RAM for it [20:47:52]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	Lawrence_	[20:48:04] 85.3ms is my audio buffer that's ridiculous [20:48:04]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	Lawrence_	[20:48:20] I've had other programs that will have my audio buffer set to easily 10.5ms or less [20:48:20]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	laama	[20:48:27] yeah that's a lot. [20:48:27]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	Lawrence_	[20:49:08] Yeah it is, and if I turn it down i get clipping issues [20:49:08]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	laama	[20:49:24] recently i just recorded a 1+ hour set with 46.4ms buffer and that was not enough buffer for my hardware. instead.. i then recorded it with another program (audacity) and i got it better.. not so much clipping in my case) [20:49:24]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	Lawrence_	[20:49:27] which is absolutely absurd because on the other DJ programs I've tried I could get it down to a at the least 10 ms [20:49:27]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	laama	[20:49:59] (i mean.. there was clipping but not so disruptive as recording with mixxx) [20:49:59]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	Lawrence_	[20:56:09] hmmm [20:56:09]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	Lawrence_	[20:56:17] well it was very disruptive to me honestly [20:56:17]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	Lawrence_	[20:56:22] It stopped my whole stream in the middle of it [20:56:22]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	Lawrence_	[20:56:56] I had streamed for 45minutes which was only 15minutes away from my half time. That's why I'm worried about using this program again and trying to figure out the issues with it. [20:56:56]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	Lawrence_	[21:07:23] If you know of any way we could fix this that would be awesome [21:07:23]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	laama	[21:49:29] i've played many but not recorded, maybe you could try without recording or.. recording with audacity.. that would require correct settings.. ASIO would cause troubles then [21:49:29]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	laama	[21:49:43] but i dont have other ideas right now :P [21:49:43]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	laama	[21:50:49] my idea doesn't really answer the problem [21:50:49]
2016-10-24 22:59:41	laama	[21:51:29] (but im also pretty sure you dont use ASIO) [21:51:29]

2016-10-24 23:19:18	laama	[20:41:34] (just a guess) [20:41:34]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	Lawrence_	[20:41:44] I was trying to record at the time it crashed yes [20:41:44]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	laama	[20:42:07] when mixxx is recording i suppose it saves the record in RAM [20:42:07]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	Lawrence_	[20:42:15] Is there any way I could increase the memory allocated to it? I have 12GB of RAM [20:42:15]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	laama	[20:42:18] and it's about 1 GB / hour [20:42:18]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	Lawrence_	[20:42:33] I was only playing for 2 hours [20:42:33]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	laama	[20:43:02] there is also this 2GB limit.. let me check if it's the default. "split recording after every X giga/hours" or somethinh [20:43:02]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	laama	[20:43:11] then it starts to write the recording to Hard drive [20:43:11]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	Lawrence_	[20:43:45] Well if it just writes to Hard Drive that would be great too [20:43:45]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	laama	[20:44:01] i have "split recordings after 4GB".. but when writing 2 GB recording to HDD it takes some serious time [20:44:01]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	Lawrence_	[20:44:01] As I have a terabyte in hard drive space [20:44:01]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	laama	[20:44:33] (or 4gb recording.. i have it 4GB because i have 10 GB ram [20:44:33]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	Lawrence_	[20:45:10] I have mine set to 4gb as well [20:45:10]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	laama	[20:45:36] well ok, that should equal 4 hours.. if it's 16bit and 44khz sound) [20:45:36]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	Lawrence_	[20:46:40] 16 bit? [20:46:40]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	Lawrence_	[20:46:44] I have it at 48khz [20:46:44]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	laama	[20:47:24] yeah 16bit is not settable but samplerate is.. but 48khz should not make that much difference [20:47:24]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	laama	[20:47:33] so the problem might be somewhere else [20:47:33]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	Lawrence_	[20:47:46] My audio buffer is having to be way up too [20:47:46]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	Lawrence_	[20:47:52] even though I have the RAM for it [20:47:52]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	Lawrence_	[20:48:04] 85.3ms is my audio buffer that's ridiculous [20:48:04]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	Lawrence_	[20:48:20] I've had other programs that will have my audio buffer set to easily 10.5ms or less [20:48:20]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	laama	[20:48:27] yeah that's a lot. [20:48:27]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	Lawrence_	[20:49:08] Yeah it is, and if I turn it down i get clipping issues [20:49:08]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	laama	[20:49:24] recently i just recorded a 1+ hour set with 46.4ms buffer and that was not enough buffer for my hardware. instead.. i then recorded it with another program (audacity) and i got it better.. not so much clipping in my case) [20:49:24]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	Lawrence_	[20:49:27] which is absolutely absurd because on the other DJ programs I've tried I could get it down to a at the least 10 ms [20:49:27]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	laama	[20:49:59] (i mean.. there was clipping but not so disruptive as recording with mixxx) [20:49:59]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	Lawrence_	[20:56:09] hmmm [20:56:09]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	Lawrence_	[20:56:17] well it was very disruptive to me honestly [20:56:17]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	Lawrence_	[20:56:22] It stopped my whole stream in the middle of it [20:56:22]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	Lawrence_	[20:56:56] I had streamed for 45minutes which was only 15minutes away from my half time. That's why I'm worried about using this program again and trying to figure out the issues with it. [20:56:56]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	Lawrence_	[21:07:23] If you know of any way we could fix this that would be awesome [21:07:23]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	laama	[21:49:29] i've played many but not recorded, maybe you could try without recording or.. recording with audacity.. that would require correct settings.. ASIO would cause troubles then [21:49:29]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	laama	[21:49:43] but i dont have other ideas right now :P [21:49:43]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	laama	[21:50:49] my idea doesn't really answer the problem [21:50:49]
2016-10-24 23:19:18	laama	[21:51:29] (but im also pretty sure you dont use ASIO) [21:51:29]

2016-10-24 23:19:18	_rgb_	[18:24:56] cheers, Pegasus_RPG! i've never tried vinyl control in mixxx before, and i'm using an unusual timecode source, so i thought it might just be me. :) [18:24:56]

2016-10-25 11:47:21	Lawrence_	[20:42:15] Is there any way I could increase the memory allocated to it? I have 12GB of RAM [20:42:15]
2016-10-25 11:47:21	laama	[20:42:18] and it's about 1 GB / hour [20:42:18]
2016-10-25 11:47:21	Lawrence_	[20:42:33] I was only playing for 2 hours [20:42:33]
2016-10-25 11:47:21	laama	[20:43:02] there is also this 2GB limit.. let me check if it's the default. "split recording after every X giga/hours" or somethinh [20:43:02]
2016-10-25 11:47:21	laama	[20:43:11] then it starts to write the recording to Hard drive [20:43:11]
2016-10-25 11:47:21	Lawrence_	[20:43:45] Well if it just writes to Hard Drive that would be great too [20:43:45]
2016-10-25 11:47:21	laama	[20:44:01] i have "split recordings after 4GB".. but when writing 2 GB recording to HDD it takes some serious time [20:44:01]
2016-10-25 11:47:21	Lawrence_	[20:44:01] As I have a terabyte in hard drive space [20:44:01]
2016-10-25 11:47:21	laama	[20:44:33] (or 4gb recording.. i have it 4GB because i have 10 GB ram [20:44:33]
2016-10-25 11:47:21	Lawrence_	[20:45:10] I have mine set to 4gb as well [20:45:10]
2016-10-25 11:47:21	laama	[20:45:36] well ok, that should equal 4 hours.. if it's 16bit and 44khz sound) [20:45:36]
2016-10-25 11:47:21	Lawrence_	[20:46:40] 16 bit? [20:46:40]
2016-10-25 11:47:21	Lawrence_	[20:46:44] I have it at 48khz [20:46:44]
2016-10-25 11:47:21	laama	[20:47:24] yeah 16bit is not settable but samplerate is.. but 48khz should not make that much difference [20:47:24]
2016-10-25 11:47:21	laama	[20:47:33] so the problem might be somewhere else [20:47:33]
2016-10-25 11:47:21	Lawrence_	[20:47:46] My audio buffer is having to be way up too [20:47:46]
2016-10-25 11:47:21	Lawrence_	[20:47:52] even though I have the RAM for it [20:47:52]
2016-10-25 11:47:21	Lawrence_	[20:48:04] 85.3ms is my audio buffer that's ridiculous [20:48:04]
2016-10-25 11:47:21	Lawrence_	[20:48:20] I've had other programs that will have my audio buffer set to easily 10.5ms or less [20:48:20]
2016-10-25 11:47:21	laama	[20:48:27] yeah that's a lot. [20:48:27]
2016-10-25 11:47:21	Lawrence_	[20:49:08] Yeah it is, and if I turn it down i get clipping issues [20:49:08]

2016-10-25 13:15:03	mykon	wait, like how much powerful? do you mean 4 cores arm and 2GB ram is not enough?
2016-10-25 13:15:21	mykon	what about octa-core and 3GB ram?
2016-10-25 13:15:51	Pegasus_RPG	I have no idea. How Mixxx runs on Android may be quite different than on desktop linux.
2016-10-25 13:16:11	Pegasus_RPG	But I expect 4 cores, 3GB RAM would be sufficient
2016-10-25 13:16:23	Pegasus_RPG	taking a wild guess
2016-10-25 13:16:36	Pegasus_RPG	since that's good for the desktop version
2016-10-25 13:16:45	Pegasus_RPG	(Plus RAM for the OS though)
2016-10-25 13:20:00	mykon	ok, pretty much the standard hardware on handheld devices nowadays.
2016-10-25 13:20:43	mykon	by the time mixxx on android octa-cores and deca-cores with 6-8GB ram will be the new normal.

2016-10-25 15:33:49	Lawrence_	[20:46:40] 16 bit? [20:46:40]
2016-10-25 15:33:49	Lawrence_	[20:46:44] I have it at 48khz [20:46:44]
2016-10-25 15:33:49	laama	[20:47:24] yeah 16bit is not settable but samplerate is.. but 48khz should not make that much difference [20:47:24]
2016-10-25 15:33:49	laama	[20:47:33] so the problem might be somewhere else [20:47:33]
2016-10-25 15:33:49	Lawrence_	[20:47:46] My audio buffer is having to be way up too [20:47:46]
2016-10-25 15:33:49	Lawrence_	[20:47:52] even though I have the RAM for it [20:47:52]
2016-10-25 15:33:49	Lawrence_	[20:48:04] 85.3ms is my audio buffer that's ridiculous [20:48:04]
2016-10-25 15:33:49	Lawrence_	[20:48:20] I've had other programs that will have my audio buffer set to easily 10.5ms or less [20:48:20]
2016-10-25 15:33:49	laama	[20:48:27] yeah that's a lot. [20:48:27]
2016-10-25 15:33:49	Lawrence_	[20:49:08] Yeah it is, and if I turn it down i get clipping issues [20:49:08]
2016-10-25 15:33:49	laama	[20:49:24] recently i just recorded a 1+ hour set with 46.4ms buffer and that was not enough buffer for my hardware. instead.. i then recorded it with another program (audacity) and i got it better.. not so much clipping in my case) [20:49:24]
2016-10-25 15:33:49	Lawrence_	[20:49:27] which is absolutely absurd because on the other DJ programs I've tried I could get it down to a at the least 10 ms [20:49:27]
2016-10-25 15:33:49	laama	[20:49:59] (i mean.. there was clipping but not so disruptive as recording with mixxx) [20:49:59]
2016-10-25 15:33:49	Lawrence_	[20:56:09] hmmm [20:56:09]
2016-10-25 15:33:49	Lawrence_	[20:56:17] well it was very disruptive to me honestly [20:56:17]
2016-10-25 15:33:49	Lawrence_	[20:56:22] It stopped my whole stream in the middle of it [20:56:22]

2016-10-25 17:57:04	laama	[20:48:27] yeah that's a lot. [20:48:27]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Lawrence_	[20:49:08] Yeah it is, and if I turn it down i get clipping issues [20:49:08]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	laama	[20:49:24] recently i just recorded a 1+ hour set with 46.4ms buffer and that was not enough buffer for my hardware. instead.. i then recorded it with another program (audacity) and i got it better.. not so much clipping in my case) [20:49:24]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Lawrence_	[20:49:27] which is absolutely absurd because on the other DJ programs I've tried I could get it down to a at the least 10 ms [20:49:27]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	laama	[20:49:59] (i mean.. there was clipping but not so disruptive as recording with mixxx) [20:49:59]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Lawrence_	[20:56:09] hmmm [20:56:09]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Lawrence_	[20:56:17] well it was very disruptive to me honestly [20:56:17]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Lawrence_	[20:56:22] It stopped my whole stream in the middle of it [20:56:22]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Lawrence_	[20:56:56] I had streamed for 45minutes which was only 15minutes away from my half time. That's why I'm worried about using this program again and trying to figure out the issues with it. [20:56:56]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Lawrence_	[21:07:23] If you know of any way we could fix this that would be awesome [21:07:23]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	laama	[21:49:29] i've played many but not recorded, maybe you could try without recording or.. recording with audacity.. that would require correct settings.. ASIO would cause troubles then [21:49:29]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	laama	[21:49:43] but i dont have other ideas right now :P [21:49:43]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	laama	[21:50:49] my idea doesn't really answer the problem [21:50:49]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	laama	[21:51:29] (but im also pretty sure you dont use ASIO) [21:51:29]

2016-10-25 17:57:04	noobymixxx	[14:36:08] cant find a good manual page about replaygain. for example is there a scanner included in analisis? [14:36:08]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	mykon	[19:06:00] hei [19:06:00]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	mykon	[19:06:16] is this available for android yet, if not when? [19:06:16]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	phschafft	[21:49:06] ? [21:49:06]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Pegasus_RPG	[23:09:59] mykon: After we port to Qt5, there's a good chance it can be made to work on sufficiently-powerful Android hardware [23:09:59]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	mykon	[23:15:03] wait, like how much powerful? do you mean 4 cores arm and 2GB ram is not enough? [23:15:03]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	mykon	[23:15:21] what about octa-core and 3GB ram? [23:15:21]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Pegasus_RPG	[23:15:51] I have no idea. How Mixxx runs on Android may be quite different than on desktop linux. [23:15:51]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Pegasus_RPG	[23:16:11] But I expect 4 cores, 3GB RAM would be sufficient [23:16:11]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Pegasus_RPG	[23:16:23] taking a wild guess [23:16:23]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Pegasus_RPG	[23:16:36] since that's good for the desktop version [23:16:36]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	Pegasus_RPG	[23:16:45] (Plus RAM for the OS though) [23:16:45]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	mykon	[23:20:00] ok, pretty much the standard hardware on handheld devices nowadays. [23:20:00]
2016-10-25 17:57:04	mykon	[23:20:43] by the time mixxx on android octa-cores and deca-cores with 6-8GB ram will be the new normal. [23:20:43]

2016-10-26 00:42:28	alyptik	phschafft› you can? or you mean automatically
2016-10-26 00:45:00	phschafft	alyptik: I got a popup window that tells me what files it's currently scanning. that window keeps on top but doesn't lock the gui.
2016-10-26 00:45:23	alyptik	that window shouldn't take very long to finish
2016-10-26 00:45:29	alyptik	i thought you meant like analyze
2016-10-26 00:45:36	phschafft	but I would more like it similar to the analyse step, which is displayed intigrated in the general skin.
2016-10-26 00:45:39	phschafft	no.
2016-10-26 00:46:07	alyptik	i actually only get the window on start/manually rescan library
2016-10-26 00:46:11	alyptik	do you get it more often?
2016-10-26 00:46:57	phschafft	no.
2016-10-26 00:52:00		[00:46]
2016-10-26 01:07:07	phschafft	the window is still open ;)

2016-10-26 01:08:15	alyptik	damn
2016-10-26 01:08:27	alyptik	how big is your library?
2016-10-26 01:11:21	phschafft	not much, 11753 files.
2016-10-26 01:12:21	phschafft	I think the bottleneck is the IO speed. I'm at about 6Mbit/s. but I thought the rescan should mostly touch the files' meta data, so not that much IO is performed. in contrast to the analyse step.
2016-10-26 01:16:24	alyptik	SSD?
2016-10-26 01:16:27	alyptik	or rotational
2016-10-26 01:19:22	phschafft	slow NAS with slow SSD.
2016-10-26 01:19:30	alyptik	oh ouch
2016-10-26 01:19:31	phschafft	so no seek time problem.
2016-10-26 01:20:03	alyptik	i can't even imagine trying to use mixxx on NAS
2016-10-26 01:20:19	phschafft	oh, we used to do it and it works perfectly fine.
2016-10-26 01:20:41	phschafft	if you really, really don't trust it keep a few files locally so you can play something while reconnecting.
2016-10-26 01:21:52	alyptik	mostly worried about the IO times
2016-10-26 01:22:01	alyptik	even on SSD i stutter at times
2016-10-26 01:22:15	phschafft	hm. never had such problems.
2016-10-26 01:22:15		[01:22]
2016-10-26 01:22:21	alyptik	what do you run for latency?
2016-10-26 01:22:35	alyptik	/buffer
2016-10-26 01:22:48	alyptik	my computer can't handle below 10ms :[
2016-10-26 01:23:39	phschafft	46.4ms at the moment. much faster than my reactions.

2016-10-26 09:43:41	phschafft	[10:45:00] alyptik: I got a popup window that tells me what files it's currently scanning. that window keeps on top but doesn't lock the gui. [10:45:00]
2016-10-26 09:43:41	alyptik	[10:45:23] that window shouldn't take very long to finish [10:45:23]

2016-10-26 22:50:27	be__	http://motu.com/products/avb/ultralite-avb
2016-10-26 22:50:49	be__	going to replace my Babyface Pro for sure
2016-10-26 22:51:41	be__	awesome sound card + freaking web app controlled digital mixer over WiFi = WIN
2016-10-26 22:52:44	be__	and a high pass filter with the onboard DSP, unlike the Babyface Pro
2016-10-26 22:52:44		[22:52]
2016-10-26 22:52:49	be__	will be great for microphones
2016-10-26 22:53:42	be__	plus extra line outputs to send to monitors with a separate volume control
2016-10-26 22:56:16	be__	limiter and compressor with the onboard DSP too O.o
2016-10-26 22:57:41	be__	and it works with Android. wtf.
2016-10-26 22:58:38	steve-_-1	be_: so you're going to buy a modern MOTU audiointerface?
2016-10-26 22:58:48	be__	hell yeah
2016-10-26 22:59:03	be__	they've apparently seen the light and gone to open standards
2016-10-26 22:59:10	be__	all their new interfaces are USB 2.0 class compliant
2016-10-26 22:59:23	be__	and the audio over ethernet uses an open standard too
2016-10-26 22:59:57	be__	(which Linux doesn't quite support yet, but when Linux does support audio over Ethernet, I'm sure that's what it will be)
2016-10-26 23:00:04	steve-_-1	wow that's nice news. they seem to be on the move for a few years now. I am running some fairly old MOTU hardware
2016-10-26 23:00:24	be__	ironically, thank Apple
2016-10-26 23:00:46	steve-_-1	since they are changing so much in the audio space of their OS? or how?
2016-10-26 23:00:46	be__	them requiring USB sound cards to be class compliant to work with iOS has pushed the market towards class compliance
2016-10-26 23:00:53	steve-_-1	ah iOS
2016-10-26 23:01:16	steve-_-1	while there's many reasons to dislike apple they are good at setting standards
2016-10-26 23:02:52	be__	I didn't look into MOTU when shopping for a sound card before because I read they were horrible about Linux support
2016-10-26 23:03:10	be__	I should have at least read through the latest product pages on their website
2016-10-26 23:03:42	be__	I'm curious to hear what the minimum latencies with these are
2016-10-26 23:03:57	be__	I saw a report measuring 4.9 ms over USB
2016-10-26 23:04:04	be__	about the same as my Babyface Pro
2016-10-26 23:04:32	be__	I think the AVB (Ethernet) connection may be able to reach lower latencies < 2 ms
2016-10-26 23:05:30	be__	the networking tech adds .9 ms on the sound card's side. I don't know about an AVB NIC to plug into the computer though
2016-10-26 23:05:56	be__	I predict someone will make a Thunderbolt 3 AVB NIC
2016-10-26 23:06:03	steve-_-1	It's so crazy how audio and video evolved in the last years. those areas are really insane.
2016-10-26 23:06:17	be__	capable of being used with these MOTU interfaces with < 2 ms round trip latencies
2016-10-26 23:06:39	be__	that is, acceptable to add digital effects on live vocals
2016-10-26 23:06:52	be__	from a laptop
2016-10-26 23:07:44	steve-_-1	which motu device would you recommend if you need like 16 mic in to recored a band?
2016-10-26 23:07:44		[23:07]
2016-10-26 23:08:05	be__	http://motu.com/products/avb/stage-b16
2016-10-26 23:08:17	steve-_-1	so I guess an old 8pre could still be connected to a more modern motu card?
2016-10-26 23:08:18	be__	same deal, USB class compliant with AVB connectivity
2016-10-26 23:08:48	be__	or http://motu.com/products/avb/8m
2016-10-26 23:08:56	be__	if 16 preamps is overkill
2016-10-26 23:09:14	be__	I don't know much about their old gear
2016-10-26 23:09:25	steve-_-1	looks like 8M is the predecessor of the 8pre
2016-10-26 23:09:58	steve-_-1	well current setup is 8pre + 828mkII. not sure what#s the best route to take to update to a modern solution
2016-10-26 23:10:40	be__	the 8M is the newer one
2016-10-26 23:10:48	be__	with the web app control
2016-10-26 23:10:59	steve-_-1	I meant successor my bad
2016-10-26 23:11:17	be__	so you can plug it into a WiFi router and mix from a smartphone or tablet in front of the monitors
2016-10-26 23:11:26	be__	or walk around the room and adjust
2016-10-26 23:12:34	be__	wow the 8M has 6 headphone amps
2016-10-26 23:13:01	be__	err 6 channel, so 3 headphones
2016-10-26 23:13:14	steve-_-1	say what? so you can make 6 monitor mixes for working musicians? ah 3 separate channels then?
2016-10-26 23:13:28	steve-_-1	well 3 stereo channels so to say
2016-10-26 23:13:43	be__	yeah
2016-10-26 23:13:49	be__	freaking awesome.
2016-10-26 23:14:03	be__	sure seems like The Thing To Get for recording a live band
2016-10-26 23:15:15	steve-_-1	maybe even sufficient if you don't mike each single drum and use overheads +s +b to record a jazz trio or quartet
2016-10-26 23:16:15	steve-_-1	not sure if I am keen on the thunderbolt connection though. it's just as exotic as firewire always was
2016-10-26 23:16:22	steve-_-1	why not USB C?
2016-10-26 23:16:26	steve-_-1	or ethernet?
2016-10-26 23:16:36	be__	and if you really wanted to do that, you could expand it with more preamps connected with ADAT or AVB
2016-10-26 23:16:44	be__	Thunderbolt 3 uses USB C
2016-10-26 23:16:55	be__	Thunderbolt 2 can be converted to Thunderbolt 3
2016-10-26 23:16:59	be__	with an adapter
2016-10-26 23:17:11	be__	Thunderbolt 3 is in almost all new PCs coming out now
2016-10-26 23:17:27	be__	err, most. maybe not "almost all"
2016-10-26 23:17:52	steve-_-1	they don't have any image showing the full back.
2016-10-26 23:18:06	be__	Intel integrated a Thunderbolt 3 controller into the chipset for their latest generation of CPUs, making it easy for OEMs to put it in everything
2016-10-26 23:20:00	be__	good product images: http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/8M
2016-10-26 23:20:58	be__	oh whoops I'm confusing the 8M and Monitor8
2016-10-26 23:22:45	be__	the Thunderbolt interfaces are also USB 2.0 class compliant
2016-10-26 23:22:45		[23:22]
2016-10-26 23:25:18	<--	magnicida (~raskolnik@ip5f5bd52d.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de) has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
2016-10-26 23:25:28	be__	so yeah the 8M would be the thing to get for recording bands
2016-10-26 23:26:48	be__	you could use Y cables to plug headphones into the line outs
2016-10-26 23:27:28	theBear	8meter thunderbolt ? that must cost as much as a 2ndhand car surely
2016-10-26 23:27:35	be__	so at least 4 independent stereo output mixes; 5 if the headphone jack on the front is independent from the back jacks
2016-10-26 23:28:07	be__	theBear: no, it's a device: http://motu.com/products/avb/8m
2016-10-26 23:28:36	be__	that does cost as much as a really old second hand car, sure
2016-10-26 23:28:42	theBear	crazy apple and their poorly veiled proprietry/custom-connector+cable approach to not believing in their product to be enough that customers won't go elsewhere after paying 2 or 4 times the price for basically the same hw everyone else sells for a realistic amount <grin>
2016-10-26 23:28:56	theBear	oh woops <grin> new motu eh ? damn i'm outta touch
2016-10-26 23:29:24	theBear	last i used a motu i think was when the err, 828? mk2/96k had just been released
2016-10-26 23:29:52	theBear	i suspect mixxx wasn't even a dream in some awesome programmers head way back then :)
2016-10-26 23:30:01	be__	yeah it was
2016-10-26 23:30:18	be__	I found a C++ file in Mixxx with a 2002 copyright date
2016-10-26 23:31:02	be__	actually, there are a lot of those if you grep the source tree
2016-10-26 23:31:05	theBear	wow, i was years behind, to think i could had pretty magic blue records all those extra years, so as to more effectively butcher the horrible music i seem to enjoy :-)
2016-10-26 23:32:00	be__	yeah forget RME, MOTU has won me over
2016-10-26 23:32:51	theBear	mmmm, looks like 828 was the right number, but that 828x that still last in the line-up on their website looks a lot fancier than the one i'm thinking of, plus i fairly sure (way more than mixxx, that was just a guess really :] ) that thunderbolt didn't exist then, hmm, i had a couple mac lappies in my hand in this room earlier that could likely confirm that one, if i remembered where they got to
2016-10-26 23:32:57	be__	like the only thing that would make the Ultralite AVB better would be a second USB port for really easy DJ changeovers like the Rane SL4
2016-10-26 23:34:07	be__	but even for that, an analog source could be hooked up to the extra line ins for a transition track and direct monitored as the USB cable is changed over
2016-10-26 23:35:00	theBear	mmmm, the very first motu stuff while not remotely bad wasn't nearly as pro as the hammerfall series say, from physical feel to hardware (jacks and knobs etc) thru software and specs for stuff like beyond negligible noisefloor measurements and kickass mic preamps, but i think i gotta agree, for at least 10 years the motu stuff has been rock solid and really a level above any of their earlier products
2016-10-26 23:35:23	be__	or attach a cheap interface with a SPDIF output and use a coaxial to lightpipe converter to connect it to the Ultralite AVB
2016-10-26 23:35:38	theBear	plus most (all?) motu stuff didn't need anything big/tricky/not-easy-to-unplug like pci cards to get all that lovely quiet audio into and out of a machine
2016-10-26 23:36:03	be__	the technical measurements of this generation of MOTU gear is on par with RME
2016-10-26 23:36:36	be__	117 dBA dynamic range on the line outs
2016-10-26 23:36:50	be__	-101 dB THD+N
2016-10-26 23:37:01	be__	+20 dBu max output
2016-10-26 23:37:10	theBear	mmm, we got one of those first super-cheap many-preamp/line-in -> lightpipe things for the studio where that older 828 i mentioned lived, maudio octane i do suspect, and even that "old 'slow'" usb 2 cable to the pc happily zooped all that data back and forth
2016-10-26 23:38:03	theBear	mmm, i'm saying the kinda 2nd/3rd gen motu products were up there with rme stuff, while rme kinda stagnated and didn't even bring out anything particularly different or impressive to keep their existing line current
2016-10-26 23:38:03		[23:38]
2016-10-26 23:38:55	theBear	and realistically, specailyl compared to a pre-digital tape setup, or just about any analog signalpath real desk, those numbers are far below what you will ever need to think about/work around
2016-10-26 23:39:00	be__	the Babyface Pro is sleek, but for $150 less the Ultralite AVB offers way more analog I/O, AVB, and WiFi mixer control
2016-10-26 23:39:49	be__	right, once at numbers like those a few dB difference is inaudible
2016-10-26 23:40:48	be__	I'll happily take that for a little bit bigger of a device to carry
2016-10-26 23:46:00		[23:40]

2016-10-26 23:46:32	theBear	mmmm, and it's not like a rack unit or even 4 or 6 of 'em is exactly a lot to carry around, specially when they so light they feel like there's nothing inside 'em.... man, you never woulda dreamed about moving an old analog desk + tape + all the racks of crap you "needed" to do a basic barebones kinda quality recording before 15 or 20 years ago

2016-10-27 17:07:25	be__	[09:22:45] the Thunderbolt interfaces are also USB 2.0 class compliant [09:22:45]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	be__	[09:25:28] so yeah the 8M would be the thing to get for recording bands [09:25:28]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	be__	[09:26:48] you could use Y cables to plug headphones into the line outs [09:26:48]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	theBear	[09:27:28] 8meter thunderbolt ? that must cost as much as a 2ndhand car surely [09:27:28]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	be__	[09:27:35] so at least 4 independent stereo output mixes; 5 if the headphone jack on the front is independent from the back jacks [09:27:35]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	be__	[09:28:07] theBear: no, it's a device: http://motu.com/products/avb/8m [09:28:07]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	be__	[09:28:36] that does cost as much as a really old second hand car, sure [09:28:36]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	theBear	[09:28:42] crazy apple and their poorly veiled proprietry/custom-connector+cable approach to not believing in their product to be enough that customers won't go elsewhere after paying 2 or 4 times the price for basically the same hw everyone else sells for a realistic amount <grin> [09:28:42]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	theBear	[09:28:56] oh woops <grin> new motu eh ? damn i'm outta touch [09:28:56]

2016-10-27 17:07:25	theBear	[09:29:52] i suspect mixxx wasn't even a dream in some awesome programmers head way back then :) [09:29:52]

2016-10-27 17:07:25	be__	[09:30:18] I found a C++ file in Mixxx with a 2002 copyright date [09:30:18]

2016-10-27 17:07:25	theBear	[09:31:05] wow, i was years behind, to think i could had pretty magic blue records all those extra years, so as to more effectively butcher the horrible music i seem to enjoy :-) [09:31:05]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	be__	[09:32:00] yeah forget RME, MOTU has won me over [09:32:00]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	theBear	[09:32:51] mmmm, looks like 828 was the right number, but that 828x that still last in the line-up on their website looks a lot fancier than the one i'm thinking of, plus i fairly sure (way more than mixxx, that was just a guess really :] ) that thunderbolt didn't exist then, hmm, i had a couple mac lappies in my hand in this room earlier that could likely confirm that one, if i remembered where they got to [09:32:51]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	be__	[09:32:57] like the only thing that would make the Ultralite AVB better would be a second USB port for really easy DJ changeovers like the Rane SL4 [09:32:57]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	be__	[09:34:07] but even for that, an analog source could be hooked up to the extra line ins for a transition track and direct monitored as the USB cable is changed over [09:34:07]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	theBear	[09:35:00] mmmm, the very first motu stuff while not remotely bad wasn't nearly as pro as the hammerfall series say, from physical feel to hardware (jacks and knobs etc) thru software and specs for stuff like beyond negligible noisefloor measurements and kickass mic preamps, but i think i gotta agree, for at least 10 years the motu stuff has been rock solid and really a level above any of their earlier products [09:35:00]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	be__	[09:35:23] or attach a cheap interface with a SPDIF output and use a coaxial to lightpipe converter to connect it to the Ultralite AVB [09:35:23]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	theBear	[09:35:38] plus most (all?) motu stuff didn't need anything big/tricky/not-easy-to-unplug like pci cards to get all that lovely quiet audio into and out of a machine [09:35:38]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	be__	[09:36:03] the technical measurements of this generation of MOTU gear is on par with RME [09:36:03]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	be__	[09:36:36] 117 dBA dynamic range on the line outs [09:36:36]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	be__	[09:36:50] -101 dB THD+N [09:36:50]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	be__	[09:37:01] +20 dBu max output [09:37:01]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	theBear	[09:37:09] mmm, we got one of those first super-cheap many-preamp/line-in -> lightpipe things for the studio where that older 828 i mentioned lived, maudio octane i do suspect, and even that "old 'slow'" usb 2 cable to the pc happily zooped all that data back and forth [09:37:09]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	theBear	[09:38:03] mmm, i'm saying the kinda 2nd/3rd gen motu products were up there with rme stuff, while rme kinda stagnated and didn't even bring out anything particularly different or impressive to keep their existing line current [09:38:03]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	theBear	[09:38:55] and realistically, specailyl compared to a pre-digital tape setup, or just about any analog signalpath real desk, those numbers are far below what you will ever need to think about/work around [09:38:55]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	be__	[09:39:00] the Babyface Pro is sleek, but for $150 less the Ultralite AVB offers way more analog I/O, AVB, and WiFi mixer control [09:39:00]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	be__	[09:39:49] right, once at numbers like those a few dB difference is inaudible [09:39:49]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	be__	[09:40:48] I'll happily take that for a little bit bigger of a device to carry [09:40:48]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	be__	[09:46:19] fuck yeah. the web app's EQ has a drag and drop GUI [09:46:19]

2016-10-27 17:07:25	theBear	[09:46:32] mmmm, and it's not like a rack unit or even 4 or 6 of 'em is exactly a lot to carry around, specially when they so light they feel like there's nothing inside 'em.... man, you never woulda dreamed about moving an old analog desk + tape + all the racks of crap you "needed" to do a basic barebones kinda quality recording before 15 or 20 years ago [09:46:32]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	steve-_-1	[09:51:07] theBear: 828MKII is what I got here :P [09:51:07]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	theBear	[09:51:53] steve-_-1, nice one ! i find it comforting to imagine things i know/once-knew so intimately at the other end of a net conversation :) [09:51:53]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	steve-_-1	[09:51:56] funny think is: motu still updates their drivers and all their devices work just fine on macOS 10.12 [09:51:56]

2016-10-27 17:07:25	be__	[09:54:42] got too excited nerding out about that [09:54:42]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	theBear	[09:58:30] hmmm, howbout that, good old motu eh, doing the right thing [09:58:30]
2016-10-27 17:07:25	theBear	[09:58:38] heh, have a lovely nap [09:58:38]

2016-10-27 17:07:25	steve-_-1	[20:37:09] or M-rryan if the fix is really that trivial would be great to have it in mixxx [20:37:09]

2016-10-27 17:07:25	yrk	[21:02:19] I'm using a samson graphite mf8 as an additional control surface and I want to map the "library play preview" (the little headphones with the play button). how can I figure out what that's called (it doesn't respond to the Wizard mode)? [21:02:19]

2016-10-27 22:29:49	be__	[09:20:58] oh whoops I'm confusing the 8M and Monitor8 [09:20:58]
2016-10-27 22:29:49	be__	[09:22:45] the Thunderbolt interfaces are also USB 2.0 class compliant [09:22:45]
2016-10-27 22:29:49	be__	[09:25:28] so yeah the 8M would be the thing to get for recording bands [09:25:28]
2016-10-27 22:29:49	be__	[09:26:48] you could use Y cables to plug headphones into the line outs [09:26:48]
2016-10-27 22:29:49	theBear	[09:27:28] 8meter thunderbolt ? that must cost as much as a 2ndhand car surely [09:27:28]
2016-10-27 22:29:49	be__	[09:27:35] so at least 4 independent stereo output mixes; 5 if the headphone jack on the front is independent from the back jacks [09:27:35]
2016-10-27 22:29:49	be__	[09:28:07] theBear: no, it's a device: http://motu.com/products/avb/8m [09:28:07]
2016-10-27 22:29:49	be__	[09:28:36] that does cost as much as a really old second hand car, sure [09:28:36]
2016-10-27 22:29:49	theBear	[09:28:42] crazy apple and their poorly veiled proprietry/custom-connector+cable approach to not believing in their product to be enough that customers won't go elsewhere after paying 2 or 4 times the price for basically the same hw everyone else sells for a realistic amount <grin> [09:28:42]
2016-10-27 22:29:49	theBear	[09:28:56] oh woops <grin> new motu eh ? damn i'm outta touch [09:28:56]
2016-10-27 22:29:49	theBear	[09:29:24] last i used a motu i think was when the err, 828? mk2/96k had just been released [09:29:24]

2016-10-28 11:26:20	be__	[09:31:02] actually, there are a lot of those if you grep the source tree [09:31:02]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	theBear	[09:31:05] wow, i was years behind, to think i could had pretty magic blue records all those extra years, so as to more effectively butcher the horrible music i seem to enjoy :-) [09:31:05]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	be__	[09:32:00] yeah forget RME, MOTU has won me over [09:32:00]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	theBear	[09:32:51] mmmm, looks like 828 was the right number, but that 828x that still last in the line-up on their website looks a lot fancier than the one i'm thinking of, plus i fairly sure (way more than mixxx, that was just a guess really :] ) that thunderbolt didn't exist then, hmm, i had a couple mac lappies in my hand in this room earlier that could likely confirm that one, if i remembered where they got to [09:32:51]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	be__	[09:32:57] like the only thing that would make the Ultralite AVB better would be a second USB port for really easy DJ changeovers like the Rane SL4 [09:32:57]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	be__	[09:34:07] but even for that, an analog source could be hooked up to the extra line ins for a transition track and direct monitored as the USB cable is changed over [09:34:07]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	theBear	[09:35:00] mmmm, the very first motu stuff while not remotely bad wasn't nearly as pro as the hammerfall series say, from physical feel to hardware (jacks and knobs etc) thru software and specs for stuff like beyond negligible noisefloor measurements and kickass mic preamps, but i think i gotta agree, for at least 10 years the motu stuff has been rock solid and really a level above any of their earlier products [09:35:00]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	be__	[09:35:23] or attach a cheap interface with a SPDIF output and use a coaxial to lightpipe converter to connect it to the Ultralite AVB [09:35:23]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	theBear	[09:35:38] plus most (all?) motu stuff didn't need anything big/tricky/not-easy-to-unplug like pci cards to get all that lovely quiet audio into and out of a machine [09:35:38]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	be__	[09:36:03] the technical measurements of this generation of MOTU gear is on par with RME [09:36:03]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	be__	[09:36:36] 117 dBA dynamic range on the line outs [09:36:36]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	be__	[09:36:50] -101 dB THD+N [09:36:50]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	be__	[09:37:01] +20 dBu max output [09:37:01]
2016-10-28 11:26:20	theBear	[09:37:09] mmm, we got one of those first super-cheap many-preamp/line-in -> lightpipe things for the studio where that older 828 i mentioned lived, maudio octane i do suspect, and even that "old 'slow'" usb 2 cable to the pc happily zooped all that data back and forth [09:37:09]

2016-10-28 12:28:13	be__	[09:31:02] actually, there are a lot of those if you grep the source tree [09:31:02]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	theBear	[09:31:05] wow, i was years behind, to think i could had pretty magic blue records all those extra years, so as to more effectively butcher the horrible music i seem to enjoy :-) [09:31:05]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	be__	[09:32:00] yeah forget RME, MOTU has won me over [09:32:00]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	theBear	[09:32:51] mmmm, looks like 828 was the right number, but that 828x that still last in the line-up on their website looks a lot fancier than the one i'm thinking of, plus i fairly sure (way more than mixxx, that was just a guess really :] ) that thunderbolt didn't exist then, hmm, i had a couple mac lappies in my hand in this room earlier that could likely confirm that one, if i remembered where they got to [09:32:51]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	be__	[09:32:57] like the only thing that would make the Ultralite AVB better would be a second USB port for really easy DJ changeovers like the Rane SL4 [09:32:57]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	be__	[09:34:07] but even for that, an analog source could be hooked up to the extra line ins for a transition track and direct monitored as the USB cable is changed over [09:34:07]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	theBear	[09:35:00] mmmm, the very first motu stuff while not remotely bad wasn't nearly as pro as the hammerfall series say, from physical feel to hardware (jacks and knobs etc) thru software and specs for stuff like beyond negligible noisefloor measurements and kickass mic preamps, but i think i gotta agree, for at least 10 years the motu stuff has been rock solid and really a level above any of their earlier products [09:35:00]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	be__	[09:35:23] or attach a cheap interface with a SPDIF output and use a coaxial to lightpipe converter to connect it to the Ultralite AVB [09:35:23]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	theBear	[09:35:38] plus most (all?) motu stuff didn't need anything big/tricky/not-easy-to-unplug like pci cards to get all that lovely quiet audio into and out of a machine [09:35:38]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	be__	[09:36:03] the technical measurements of this generation of MOTU gear is on par with RME [09:36:03]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	be__	[09:36:36] 117 dBA dynamic range on the line outs [09:36:36]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	be__	[09:36:50] -101 dB THD+N [09:36:50]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	be__	[09:37:01] +20 dBu max output [09:37:01]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	theBear	[09:37:09] mmm, we got one of those first super-cheap many-preamp/line-in -> lightpipe things for the studio where that older 828 i mentioned lived, maudio octane i do suspect, and even that "old 'slow'" usb 2 cable to the pc happily zooped all that data back and forth [09:37:09]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	theBear	[09:38:03] mmm, i'm saying the kinda 2nd/3rd gen motu products were up there with rme stuff, while rme kinda stagnated and didn't even bring out anything particularly different or impressive to keep their existing line current [09:38:03]
2016-10-28 12:28:13	theBear	[09:38:55] and realistically, specailyl compared to a pre-digital tape setup, or just about any analog signalpath real desk, those numbers are far below what you will ever need to think about/work around [09:38:55]

2016-10-28 12:28:13	be__	[09:39:49] right, once at numbers like those a few dB difference is inaudible [09:39:49]

2016-10-28 22:16:44	Pegasus_RPG	[19:06:44] steve-_-2: oh, I have no idea about the skin system. I would just have to try that proposed solution out like anyone else. :) [19:06:44]

2016-10-29 12:25:06	theBear	[09:35:00] mmmm, the very first motu stuff while not remotely bad wasn't nearly as pro as the hammerfall series say, from physical feel to hardware (jacks and knobs etc) thru software and specs for stuff like beyond negligible noisefloor measurements and kickass mic preamps, but i think i gotta agree, for at least 10 years the motu stuff has been rock solid and really a level above any of their earlier products [09:35:00]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	be__	[09:35:23] or attach a cheap interface with a SPDIF output and use a coaxial to lightpipe converter to connect it to the Ultralite AVB [09:35:23]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	theBear	[09:35:38] plus most (all?) motu stuff didn't need anything big/tricky/not-easy-to-unplug like pci cards to get all that lovely quiet audio into and out of a machine [09:35:38]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	be__	[09:36:03] the technical measurements of this generation of MOTU gear is on par with RME [09:36:03]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	be__	[09:36:36] 117 dBA dynamic range on the line outs [09:36:36]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	be__	[09:36:50] -101 dB THD+N [09:36:50]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	be__	[09:37:01] +20 dBu max output [09:37:01]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	theBear	[09:37:09] mmm, we got one of those first super-cheap many-preamp/line-in -> lightpipe things for the studio where that older 828 i mentioned lived, maudio octane i do suspect, and even that "old 'slow'" usb 2 cable to the pc happily zooped all that data back and forth [09:37:09]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	theBear	[09:38:03] mmm, i'm saying the kinda 2nd/3rd gen motu products were up there with rme stuff, while rme kinda stagnated and didn't even bring out anything particularly different or impressive to keep their existing line current [09:38:03]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	theBear	[09:38:55] and realistically, specailyl compared to a pre-digital tape setup, or just about any analog signalpath real desk, those numbers are far below what you will ever need to think about/work around [09:38:55]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	be__	[09:39:00] the Babyface Pro is sleek, but for $150 less the Ultralite AVB offers way more analog I/O, AVB, and WiFi mixer control [09:39:00]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	be__	[09:39:49] right, once at numbers like those a few dB difference is inaudible [09:39:49]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	be__	[09:40:48] I'll happily take that for a little bit bigger of a device to carry [09:40:48]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	be__	[09:46:19] fuck yeah. the web app's EQ has a drag and drop GUI [09:46:19]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	be__	[09:46:24] http://cdn-data.motu.com/downloads/audio/AVB/docs/MOTU+Firmware+125+Update+Notes.pdf [09:46:24]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	theBear	[09:46:32] mmmm, and it's not like a rack unit or even 4 or 6 of 'em is exactly a lot to carry around, specially when they so light they feel like there's nothing inside 'em.... man, you never woulda dreamed about moving an old analog desk + tape + all the racks of crap you "needed" to do a basic barebones kinda quality recording before 15 or 20 years ago [09:46:32]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	steve-_-1	[09:51:07] theBear: 828MKII is what I got here :P [09:51:07]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	theBear	[09:51:53] steve-_-1, nice one ! i find it comforting to imagine things i know/once-knew so intimately at the other end of a net conversation :) [09:51:53]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	steve-_-1	[09:51:56] funny think is: motu still updates their drivers and all their devices work just fine on macOS 10.12 [09:51:56]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	steve-_-1	[09:52:41] thing [09:52:41]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	be__	[09:54:35] well, it's waaay past bedtime for me [09:54:35]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	be__	[09:54:42] got too excited nerding out about that [09:54:42]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	theBear	[09:58:30] hmmm, howbout that, good old motu eh, doing the right thing [09:58:30]
2016-10-29 12:25:06	theBear	[09:58:38] heh, have a lovely nap [09:58:38]

2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[23:51:33] Hi there. [23:51:33]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[23:52:08] any dev in the channel? sblaisot , Pegasus_RPG , M-rryan , Tiger ? [23:52:08]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[23:53:05] I am working on what it looked as a trivial bug in Mixxx, but I've reached a point that I would like to comment first [23:53:05]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[23:54:10] Bug is: recording the mix to wav/aiff causes integer overflow (to saved audio) when audio saturates. [23:54:10]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[23:55:21] The root cause is that Mixxx uses libsndfile to write from its float buffer to integer, and the default mode is to not modify the data. [23:55:21]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[23:56:05] It does offer an option to automatically clip, but then, that option works depending on the CPU to which the source was compiled to [23:56:05]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[23:56:57] (i.e. it seems that some processors might automatically clip , and others don't, and the code has paths to not do additioal calculations if the cpu supposedly supports that) [23:56:57]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[23:57:12] but such thing is detected in compile time (via an .m4 script) [23:57:12]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[23:58:07] for windows, the "buildserver" files have a pregenerated config.h which currently says that the processor knows how to clip negative overflows. [23:58:07]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[23:58:55] So then, I tried the naive way ( use CSAMPLE_clamp() method ), but i cannot modify the buffer, since it is const (and probably should be) [23:58:55]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[23:59:17] and it would not be a good idea to allocate dynamically the buffer each "process" call. [23:59:17]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[00:01:01] So there I am... with a trivial thing to do (tell the code that it has to clip a value), but with no obvious way on how to tell it to. [00:01:01]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	Pegasus_RPG	[00:03:42] JosepMa: I'm here but don't know how best to proceed. Please re-state all of that in a message to mixxx-devel as more people can respond. [00:03:42]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[00:04:23] Ok. I'll do that. [00:04:23]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	M-rryan	[00:07:24] JosepMa : I would say enable clipping in libsndfile [00:07:24]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[00:09:22] M-rryan: sure, that's the logical thing to do, but that didn't solve it for me, because of the configuration in the libsndfile's config.h in "buildserver", and it could still fail to other people with other builds. [00:09:22]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	M-rryan	[00:10:30] you mean Mixxx's Windows build of libsndfile ? [00:10:30]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[00:10:35] yes [00:10:35]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	M-rryan	[00:10:50] then we should probably fix that :) [00:10:50]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	M-rryan	[00:11:30] b/c it means we are building libsndfile incorrectly and other bugs could manifest b/c of those defines being wrong [00:11:30]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[00:12:52] Well, this only affects this part (i didn't saw any other usage of libsndfile in Mixxx, except in validity tests) [00:12:52]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	M-rryan	[00:13:25] we use libsndfile for decoding files too [00:13:25]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	M-rryan	[00:13:30] wav / aiff / riff [00:13:30]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[00:14:18] So... you propose: Fix libsndfiles build for windows, enable automatic clip on code and that should make it "work for most people" [00:14:18]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	M-rryan	[00:18:34] if I understand this right -- I think the test isn't about the actual CPU but instead it's about how the lrint standard library method behaves on the platform [00:18:34]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[00:22:20] well, the m4 test is done with lrint, indeed (and libsndfile's code uses lrintf, its float variant) [00:22:20]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[00:22:49] i've just changed it and I am compiling to test it again [00:22:49]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	M-rryan	[00:26:02] oh nevermind -- at least glibc has a different implementation of lrint per architecture [00:26:02]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	M-rryan	[00:26:07] https://github.com/lattera/glibc/blob/a2f34833b1042d5d8eeb263b4cf4caaea138c4ad/sysdeps/x86_64/fpu/s_llrint.S [00:26:07]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	M-rryan	[00:29:17] i guess the safe setting would be to set both to 0 so it always falls back on clamping manually [00:29:17]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[00:29:52] yes [00:29:52]
2016-10-29 18:39:19	JosepMa	[00:29:59] that's what i'd recommend for windows [00:29:59]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	JosepMa	[00:35:59] I will also try to fix these three bugs that I reported some time ago: [00:35:59]

2016-10-29 18:39:20	JosepMa	[00:36:25] they are all related to recoding the mix to file [00:36:25]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	M-rryan	[00:36:29] cool! [00:36:29]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	JosepMa	[00:37:00] would it be ok to have all them in the same branch or would you recommend a branch for each bug? [00:37:00]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	M-rryan	[00:39:25] I personally prefer to keep them split but since they're all roughly on the same topic, I doubt addressing them in the same pull request would bother anyone [00:39:25]
2016-10-29 18:39:20	JosepMa	[00:43:11] test: passed ;) :D [00:43:11]

2016-10-29 23:10:14	M-rryan	[00:39:25] I personally prefer to keep them split but since they're all roughly on the same topic, I doubt addressing them in the same pull request would bother anyone [00:39:25]
2016-10-29 23:10:14	JosepMa	[00:43:11] test: passed ;) :D [00:43:11]

2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[23:51:33] Hi there. [23:51:33]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[23:52:08] any dev in the channel? sblaisot , Pegasus_RPG , M-rryan , Tiger ? [23:52:08]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[23:53:05] I am working on what it looked as a trivial bug in Mixxx, but I've reached a point that I would like to comment first [23:53:05]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[23:54:10] Bug is: recording the mix to wav/aiff causes integer overflow (to saved audio) when audio saturates. [23:54:10]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[23:55:21] The root cause is that Mixxx uses libsndfile to write from its float buffer to integer, and the default mode is to not modify the data. [23:55:21]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[23:56:05] It does offer an option to automatically clip, but then, that option works depending on the CPU to which the source was compiled to [23:56:05]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[23:56:57] (i.e. it seems that some processors might automatically clip , and others don't, and the code has paths to not do additioal calculations if the cpu supposedly supports that) [23:56:57]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[23:57:12] but such thing is detected in compile time (via an .m4 script) [23:57:12]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[23:58:07] for windows, the "buildserver" files have a pregenerated config.h which currently says that the processor knows how to clip negative overflows. [23:58:07]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[23:58:55] So then, I tried the naive way ( use CSAMPLE_clamp() method ), but i cannot modify the buffer, since it is const (and probably should be) [23:58:55]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[23:59:17] and it would not be a good idea to allocate dynamically the buffer each "process" call. [23:59:17]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[00:01:01] So there I am... with a trivial thing to do (tell the code that it has to clip a value), but with no obvious way on how to tell it to. [00:01:01]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	Pegasus_RPG	[00:03:42] JosepMa: I'm here but don't know how best to proceed. Please re-state all of that in a message to mixxx-devel as more people can respond. [00:03:42]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[00:04:23] Ok. I'll do that. [00:04:23]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	M-rryan	[00:07:24] JosepMa : I would say enable clipping in libsndfile [00:07:24]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[00:09:22] M-rryan: sure, that's the logical thing to do, but that didn't solve it for me, because of the configuration in the libsndfile's config.h in "buildserver", and it could still fail to other people with other builds. [00:09:22]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	M-rryan	[00:10:30] you mean Mixxx's Windows build of libsndfile ? [00:10:30]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[00:10:35] yes [00:10:35]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	M-rryan	[00:10:50] then we should probably fix that :) [00:10:50]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	M-rryan	[00:11:30] b/c it means we are building libsndfile incorrectly and other bugs could manifest b/c of those defines being wrong [00:11:30]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[00:12:52] Well, this only affects this part (i didn't saw any other usage of libsndfile in Mixxx, except in validity tests) [00:12:52]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	M-rryan	[00:13:25] we use libsndfile for decoding files too [00:13:25]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	M-rryan	[00:13:30] wav / aiff / riff [00:13:30]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[00:14:18] So... you propose: Fix libsndfiles build for windows, enable automatic clip on code and that should make it "work for most people" [00:14:18]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	M-rryan	[00:18:34] if I understand this right -- I think the test isn't about the actual CPU but instead it's about how the lrint standard library method behaves on the platform [00:18:34]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[00:22:20] well, the m4 test is done with lrint, indeed (and libsndfile's code uses lrintf, its float variant) [00:22:20]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[00:22:49] i've just changed it and I am compiling to test it again [00:22:49]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	M-rryan	[00:26:02] oh nevermind -- at least glibc has a different implementation of lrint per architecture [00:26:02]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	M-rryan	[00:26:07] https://github.com/lattera/glibc/blob/a2f34833b1042d5d8eeb263b4cf4caaea138c4ad/sysdeps/x86_64/fpu/s_llrint.S [00:26:07]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	M-rryan	[00:29:17] i guess the safe setting would be to set both to 0 so it always falls back on clamping manually [00:29:17]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[00:29:52] yes [00:29:52]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[00:29:59] that's what i'd recommend for windows [00:29:59]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[00:35:59] I will also try to fix these three bugs that I reported some time ago: [00:35:59]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[00:36:00] https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/1605923 [00:36:00]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[00:36:04] https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/1605921 [00:36:04]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[00:36:09] https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/1605922 [00:36:09]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[00:36:25] they are all related to recoding the mix to file [00:36:25]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	M-rryan	[00:36:29] cool! [00:36:29]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[00:37:00] would it be ok to have all them in the same branch or would you recommend a branch for each bug? [00:37:00]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	M-rryan	[00:39:25] I personally prefer to keep them split but since they're all roughly on the same topic, I doubt addressing them in the same pull request would bother anyone [00:39:25]
2016-10-31 00:23:10	JosepMa	[00:43:11] test: passed ;) :D [00:43:11]

2016-10-31 01:31:09	--	Notice(mixxx-commits): [22:21:31] [mixxx] uklotzde opened pull request #1034: Order crates by case-insensitive name (master...crate_sorting) https://git.io/vXLrL [22:21:31]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[23:51:33] Hi there. [23:51:33]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[23:52:08] any dev in the channel? sblaisot , Pegasus_RPG , M-rryan , Tiger ? [23:52:08]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[23:53:05] I am working on what it looked as a trivial bug in Mixxx, but I've reached a point that I would like to comment first [23:53:05]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[23:54:10] Bug is: recording the mix to wav/aiff causes integer overflow (to saved audio) when audio saturates. [23:54:10]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[23:55:21] The root cause is that Mixxx uses libsndfile to write from its float buffer to integer, and the default mode is to not modify the data. [23:55:21]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[23:56:05] It does offer an option to automatically clip, but then, that option works depending on the CPU to which the source was compiled to [23:56:05]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[23:56:57] (i.e. it seems that some processors might automatically clip , and others don't, and the code has paths to not do additioal calculations if the cpu supposedly supports that) [23:56:57]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[23:57:12] but such thing is detected in compile time (via an .m4 script) [23:57:12]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[23:58:07] for windows, the "buildserver" files have a pregenerated config.h which currently says that the processor knows how to clip negative overflows. [23:58:07]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[23:58:55] So then, I tried the naive way ( use CSAMPLE_clamp() method ), but i cannot modify the buffer, since it is const (and probably should be) [23:58:55]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[23:59:17] and it would not be a good idea to allocate dynamically the buffer each "process" call. [23:59:17]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[00:01:01] So there I am... with a trivial thing to do (tell the code that it has to clip a value), but with no obvious way on how to tell it to. [00:01:01]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	Pegasus_RPG	[00:03:42] JosepMa: I'm here but don't know how best to proceed. Please re-state all of that in a message to mixxx-devel as more people can respond. [00:03:42]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[00:04:23] Ok. I'll do that. [00:04:23]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	M-rryan	[00:07:24] JosepMa : I would say enable clipping in libsndfile [00:07:24]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[00:09:22] M-rryan: sure, that's the logical thing to do, but that didn't solve it for me, because of the configuration in the libsndfile's config.h in "buildserver", and it could still fail to other people with other builds. [00:09:22]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	M-rryan	[00:10:30] you mean Mixxx's Windows build of libsndfile ? [00:10:30]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[00:10:35] yes [00:10:35]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	M-rryan	[00:10:50] then we should probably fix that :) [00:10:50]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	M-rryan	[00:11:30] b/c it means we are building libsndfile incorrectly and other bugs could manifest b/c of those defines being wrong [00:11:30]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[00:12:52] Well, this only affects this part (i didn't saw any other usage of libsndfile in Mixxx, except in validity tests) [00:12:52]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	M-rryan	[00:13:25] we use libsndfile for decoding files too [00:13:25]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	M-rryan	[00:13:30] wav / aiff / riff [00:13:30]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[00:14:18] So... you propose: Fix libsndfiles build for windows, enable automatic clip on code and that should make it "work for most people" [00:14:18]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	M-rryan	[00:18:34] if I understand this right -- I think the test isn't about the actual CPU but instead it's about how the lrint standard library method behaves on the platform [00:18:34]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[00:22:20] well, the m4 test is done with lrint, indeed (and libsndfile's code uses lrintf, its float variant) [00:22:20]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[00:22:49] i've just changed it and I am compiling to test it again [00:22:49]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	M-rryan	[00:26:02] oh nevermind -- at least glibc has a different implementation of lrint per architecture [00:26:02]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	M-rryan	[00:26:07] https://github.com/lattera/glibc/blob/a2f34833b1042d5d8eeb263b4cf4caaea138c4ad/sysdeps/x86_64/fpu/s_llrint.S [00:26:07]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	M-rryan	[00:29:17] i guess the safe setting would be to set both to 0 so it always falls back on clamping manually [00:29:17]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[00:29:52] yes [00:29:52]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[00:29:59] that's what i'd recommend for windows [00:29:59]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[00:35:59] I will also try to fix these three bugs that I reported some time ago: [00:35:59]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[00:36:00] https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/1605923 [00:36:00]
2016-10-31 01:31:09	JosepMa	[00:36:04] https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/1605921 [00:36:04]
2016-10-31 01:31:10	JosepMa	[00:36:09] https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/1605922 [00:36:09]
2016-10-31 01:31:10	JosepMa	[00:36:25] they are all related to recoding the mix to file [00:36:25]
2016-10-31 01:31:10	M-rryan	[00:36:29] cool! [00:36:29]
2016-10-31 01:31:10	JosepMa	[00:37:00] would it be ok to have all them in the same branch or would you recommend a branch for each bug? [00:37:00]
2016-10-31 01:31:10	M-rryan	[00:39:25] I personally prefer to keep them split but since they're all roughly on the same topic, I doubt addressing them in the same pull request would bother anyone [00:39:25]
2016-10-31 01:31:10	JosepMa	[00:43:11] test: passed ;) :D [00:43:11]

2016-10-31 11:42:17	JosepMa	Hi there :)
2016-10-31 11:42:37	JosepMa	Changes on the recording to file are going quite well :)
2016-10-31 11:43:13	JosepMa	distortion on excessive gain: fixed ( needs additional fix to windows build of libsndfile)
2016-10-31 11:43:38	JosepMa	saving the file name in the cue as a relative path instead of absolute path : fixed
2016-10-31 11:43:45	JosepMa	close cue file: fixed
2016-10-31 11:43:51	JosepMa	close part files: fixed
2016-10-31 11:44:21	JosepMa	parts are not corretly split (audio is lost): fixed
2016-10-31 11:45:03	JosepMa	added possibility to split in 60, 74, 80 and 120 minutes (working for all formats, not only wav/aiff)
2016-10-31 11:45:53	JosepMa	and now I will start the option to choose between 16bit, 24bit and 32bit float if saving to WAV (probaby it can be done for AIFF too)
2016-10-31 11:46:47	JosepMa	I also wanted to improve the cue file time indicators, (especially for first file), but that might not be as easy

2016-10-31 13:13:58		[13:13]
2016-10-31 13:15:19	JosepMa	Yup.. There are also some UI aspects that would like to comment. Concretely, the combobox that selects the sizes is not translated. I've seen in other parts that the key to translation is using a method named "tr()", but I'm not sure what more is needed, so i'm not touching that for now.
2016-10-31 13:15:35	JosepMa	Also this select is saving the text directly as the parameter, rather than using an index or some keyword

2016-10-31 13:42:03	JosepMa	[00:10:35] yes [00:10:35]
2016-10-31 13:42:03	M-rryan	[00:10:50] then we should probably fix that :) [00:10:50]
2016-10-31 13:42:03	M-rryan	[00:11:30] b/c it means we are building libsndfile incorrectly and other bugs could manifest b/c of those defines being wrong [00:11:30]
2016-10-31 13:42:03	JosepMa	[00:12:52] Well, this only affects this part (i didn't saw any other usage of libsndfile in Mixxx, except in validity tests) [00:12:52]
2016-10-31 13:42:03	M-rryan	[00:13:25] we use libsndfile for decoding files too [00:13:25]
2016-10-31 13:42:03	M-rryan	[00:13:30] wav / aiff / riff [00:13:30]
2016-10-31 13:42:03	JosepMa	[00:14:18] So... you propose: Fix libsndfiles build for windows, enable automatic clip on code and that should make it "work for most people" [00:14:18]
2016-10-31 13:42:03	M-rryan	[00:18:34] if I understand this right -- I think the test isn't about the actual CPU but instead it's about how the lrint standard library method behaves on the platform [00:18:34]
2016-10-31 13:42:03	JosepMa	[00:22:20] well, the m4 test is done with lrint, indeed (and libsndfile's code uses lrintf, its float variant) [00:22:20]
2016-10-31 13:42:03	JosepMa	[00:22:49] i've just changed it and I am compiling to test it again [00:22:49]
2016-10-31 13:42:03	M-rryan	[00:26:02] oh nevermind -- at least glibc has a different implementation of lrint per architecture [00:26:02]

2016-10-31 16:21:04	wrl	[23:27:52] hey, is there a easy way of testing a HID controller script while developing it? [23:27:52]
2016-10-31 16:21:04	wrl	[23:28:08] (still stalling on this Z2 mixer) [23:28:08]
2016-10-31 16:21:04	JosepMa	[23:32:54] M-rryan: changes so far commited to my github branch. I'll do a pull request when finishing the rest [23:32:54]
2016-10-31 16:21:04	JosepMa	[23:33:42] wrl: Hope someone can answer that. I am just experienced with midi mappings [23:33:42]
2016-10-31 16:21:04	JosepMa	[23:49:48] great. Saving in 16, 24 and 32bit float working too [23:49:48]

2016-11-01 01:23:10	JosepMa	just put the mouse over one header and press the right button. that should pop-up a list of the headers
2016-11-01 01:23:19	JosepMa	there you should be able to enable the bpm column
2016-11-01 01:23:53	JosepMa	Also note that each list can have a different set of columns ( playlists, library, autodj...)

2016-11-01 02:01:06	JosepMa	Not a skin dev, but I've looked, and at least it is true that the crossfader setting does not have the "persist=true" argument
2016-11-01 02:01:32	JosepMa	so one obvious thing to try is to add it and test what the user said

2016-11-01 02:09:44	JosepMa	it will be done when loading a track, and you can also make it scan all files from the "Analize" option in the bottom left list

2016-11-01 07:01:17	JosepMa	oh, sorry.. I probably didn't activate email notification for that thread.
