2016-10-26 12:59:51	+Max`P	Effexor withdrawal, day 2: things appears to smell more, be louder and more colorful. So far it confirms my theory that this stuff worked by suppressing feelings entirely
2016-10-26 13:05:00		[12:59]
2016-10-26 13:05:27	nxll	Venlafaxine is structurally and pharmacologically related to the atypical opioid analgesic tramadol, and more distantly to the newly released opioid tapentadol, but not to any of the conventional antidepressant drugs, including tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, MAOIs, or RIMAs.
2016-10-26 13:05:36	nxll	interesting
2016-10-26 13:09:12	+Max`P	Yeah it's an inhibitator that's supposed to block receptors so that the concentration of the neurotransmitter stuff is higher. But I think it may also prevent absorption of the neurotransmitters.
2016-10-26 13:09:33	nxll	its an NDRI 
2016-10-26 13:10:10	nxll	er
2016-10-26 13:10:11	nxll	SNRI
2016-10-26 13:10:11	+Max`P	Ironically it was supposed to help with the depression and anxiety, but so far apart from the little burst I had before eating today, I feel more calm than I've been in quite a long while
2016-10-26 13:10:14	+Max`P	Yeah, SNRI.
2016-10-26 13:10:30	nxll	seratonin is overrated idk
2016-10-26 13:11:19	nxll	everyone i've known who's been on an SSRI or really anything that functions as an SRI has had a terrible experience with it
2016-10-26 13:11:56	+Max`P	Yeah, I think it's great to help when shit hit the fan and goes out of control, but I'm glad I'm stopping it now

2016-10-26 13:21:26	+Max`P	%np
