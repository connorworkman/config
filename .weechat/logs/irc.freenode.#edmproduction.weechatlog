2016-09-09 02:02:50	werbel	I've purchased Push 2 via Polish official Ableton distributor. It came obviously used. I sent it back - they sent me another unit. Now I'm considering using current discount for Live upgrades so I create an account, try to register the device - can't do. Contact Ableton support. They say the unit was supposed to be sent back to them not re-sold. Ugh.
2016-09-09 02:07:06	jse	that sucks
2016-09-09 02:07:15	jse	push to get a full refund from that distributor
2016-09-09 02:07:22	jse	and push ableton to register the copy anyway
2016-09-09 02:07:33	jse	the ableton team are pretty good peoples they should help you
2016-09-09 02:07:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	yeah, ableton will probably do everything they can for you...
2016-09-09 02:07:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	issue is getting your distributor to act like non-retards
2016-09-09 02:08:01	wrl	ableton are pretty understanding
2016-09-09 02:08:51	jse	they probably won't be a distributor for much longer
2016-09-09 02:09:36	Lapa	or will still be a distributor but not official one ;p
2016-09-09 02:14:49	werbel	Ok… so the thing is… when they replaced my unit at the beginning they sent the second one with a Quick Start Guide and registration code of the first one which was actually out of circulation thus blocked by Ableton
2016-09-09 02:14:49		[02:14]
2016-09-09 02:15:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	werbel: have you contacted the dudes that sold you the shitty stuff the second time yet?
2016-09-09 02:16:58	werbel	AdmiralBumbleBee Yes… the second Push is a good one. Someone just put the first registration code in the second box for some reason.
2016-09-09 02:16:59	jse	werbel: so go back to them and complain
2016-09-09 02:17:04	jse	cause a fucking scene
2016-09-09 02:17:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	^
2016-09-09 02:17:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	werbel: so you've contacted them since you got the second  one?
2016-09-09 02:18:09	werbel	No reason for the scene… They're on it. Good luck though as they have shitload of those codes laying around and there's no way to pair them with the device (maybe Ableton will find the code for them by the serial number on the device)
2016-09-09 02:18:46	legreffier	werbel: that's what the s/n are for :) they should sort it out easily
2016-09-09 02:18:55	werbel	I got the first and second one in February… just had no reason to try registering up to this point.

2016-09-09 02:20:43	werbel	But… Intro vs Suite. I know the functionality and instrument limitations. But I have no way of judging the worthiness of those 3000+ Sounds (54GB). Anyone knows if those are any good? Everyone is going with 3rd party sample packs anyway

2016-09-09 02:21:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	buying suite for the samples... is a waste.
2016-09-09 02:21:09	raz	i have the suite and never even installed that
2016-09-09 02:21:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	the instruments ad m4l are worth it
2016-09-09 02:21:18	AdmiralBumbleBee	the samples are not
2016-09-09 02:21:58	raz	maybe the samples are actually good.. it just feels like they're probably overused
2016-09-09 02:22:18	AdmiralBumbleBee	raz: a lot of them have been compressed at some point in their life
2016-09-09 02:22:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's pretty shitty
2016-09-09 02:22:24	raz	are people really using m4l?   this laggy java shit never works right for me
2016-09-09 02:22:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	m4l is awesome
2016-09-09 02:22:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's the only reason I ever even open live
2016-09-09 02:23:06	raz	well some of the m4l plugs COULD be awesome.. but whichever i try there's always some annoying bug or lag.. shit going out of sync

2016-09-09 02:27:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	m4l itself
2016-09-09 02:27:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	make your own shit
2016-09-09 02:27:15	raz	ahh.. you build your own stuff..
2016-09-09 02:27:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	that's what's so great about it
2016-09-09 02:27:17	raz	hmm
2016-09-09 02:30:32	werbel	Thanks for the info :)

2016-09-09 02:31:59	werbel	I wish producing gave me any income. Right now is "programming to get moneys, spend moneys on hobbies (producing)" - no justification for spending all of it. ;)
2016-09-09 02:32:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	werbel: enjoyment is justification enough
2016-09-09 02:32:42	werbel	AdmiralBumbleBee Yes, but you have to balance it with other shit that gives you enjoyment
2016-09-09 02:32:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	other... shit?
2016-09-09 02:32:52	AdmiralBumbleBee	than music?!
2016-09-09 02:33:01	werbel	Like travel and new rims for my car. oO
2016-09-09 02:33:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	pffft
2016-09-09 02:33:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	if you're leaving your room, you clearly don't enjoy production that much
2016-09-09 02:33:55	werbel	What I mean is… I can sustain my live with programming… any money from producing would be spent on producing.
2016-09-09 02:34:29	werbel	AdmiralBumbleBee I don't think you can say that. People enjoy many things, don't have to be 100% consumed by it.
2016-09-09 02:35:19	werbel	(that's why I'm happy music was never my career path, I have absolutely 0 pressure)
2016-09-09 02:35:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	yeah, you just don't like music
2016-09-09 02:35:30	AdmiralBumbleBee	you're not a _true_ musician

2016-09-09 07:02:09	raz	how do you even work with this crap
2016-09-09 07:02:23	raz	replaces the DAW window.. can't toggle playback with space bar
2016-09-09 07:02:55	djdementia	replaces? it's a window just like any other plugin
2016-09-09 07:03:42	raz	it's a fucking fullscreen window here
2016-09-09 07:03:54	djdementia	omg fullscreen!?!? what ever shal we do
2016-09-09 07:04:09	raz	with tabs and panes, tries to look like ableton itself
2016-09-09 07:04:43	raz	and it steals the keyboard focus, so it's definitely not meant to be used like normal plugs

2016-09-09 07:10:27	raz	<- goes back to painting random midi notes with his nose
2016-09-09 07:11:15	djdementia	it splits up drums into barform patterns
2016-09-09 07:11:43	djdementia	you pick a kick pattern and then when you go to the snare track it gives you snare patterns that go with the kick pattern you already picked
2016-09-09 07:11:50	djdementia	and so on for each instrument
2016-09-09 07:12:20	djdementia	like this DashZanger https://youtu.be/bGNPBjVHITo?t=2m10s
2016-09-09 07:12:24	DashZanger	isnt that kind of... cheating
2016-09-09 07:12:31	djdementia	yup it sure is
2016-09-09 07:12:54	djdementia	i don't know what are the alternatives that do that? i'm sure there are some?

2016-09-09 07:13:45	djdementia	each pattern isn't just a note pattern it all has more natural velocities built in
2016-09-09 07:13:49	djdementia	and you can customize ofc
2016-09-09 07:14:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	chaeting?
2016-09-09 07:14:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	DashZanger: isn't using software that someone else made 'cheating' anyway?
2016-09-09 07:15:08	DashZanger	well by alternatives i mean other beat making software, like battery, rebirth (very old but good), and others
2016-09-09 07:15:30	DashZanger	but the barform list seems a bit... made for you, as in you dont do much if you just use the predone beats
2016-09-09 07:15:36	DashZanger	of course its a different thing when you customize
2016-09-09 07:15:41	djdementia	keep looking
2016-09-09 07:15:44	Nahck	battery is awesome
2016-09-09 07:15:47	djdementia	once you get into beatweaver it gets prety complex
2016-09-09 07:16:00	djdementia	LR can be as easy or complex as you want
2016-09-09 07:16:05	DashZanger	but laying out options like that, almost premade beats, is almost like downloading them straight from looperman.com
2016-09-09 07:16:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	DashZanger: so?
2016-09-09 07:16:54	djdementia	watch this part DashZanger: https://youtu.be/bGNPBjVHITo?t=4m13s
2016-09-09 07:17:19	djdementia	they call it a "Rhythm Synthesizer"
2016-09-09 07:18:03	djdementia	i don't know of anything else that workse like that do you DashZanger?
2016-09-09 07:18:34	DashZanger	afaik those all could be done via manual editing in your daw
2016-09-09 07:18:40	djdementia	well yeah of course
2016-09-09 07:18:49	DashZanger	wouldnt be as fun tho, but this isnt really a "new" thing
2016-09-09 07:18:54	djdementia	but that could be said of all plugins yeah?
2016-09-09 07:18:57	DashZanger	sure
2016-09-09 07:19:05	djdementia	so what the fuck is the point of saying that?
2016-09-09 07:19:30	DashZanger	i notice a problem tho
2016-09-09 07:19:53	DashZanger	how about beats that arent on rhythm precisely, say, theres a bit of swing on them
2016-09-09 07:19:53		[07:19]
2016-09-09 07:19:56	djdementia	i mean the entire point of a plugin is to speed up your workflow
2016-09-09 07:20:01	DashZanger	or manually arranged them to be slightly off the beat
2016-09-09 07:20:07	djdementia	they go into that too ofc.
2016-09-09 07:20:12	DashZanger	ok, good
2016-09-09 07:20:33	DashZanger	"speed up your workflow" now this is where it comes into the opinions
2016-09-09 07:20:57	djdementia	like for one thing if you pick one pattern some of the options for the next pattern will include swing
2016-09-09 07:21:25	DashZanger	if something is laid down in front of you, you havent really done much, but if you construct every sample one by one to fit your groove, you control the entire musical rhythm via the samples themselves
2016-09-09 07:21:31	DashZanger	instead of premade loops youve edited
2016-09-09 07:21:35	kerrang	work drama, best drama /s
2016-09-09 07:21:37	DashZanger	now this is just an opinion
2016-09-09 07:22:11	djdementia	DashZanger : i get the feeling that you've already decided you hate it before even talking to me and you are just trying to confirm your already opinion that you hate it
2016-09-09 07:22:15	djdementia	this is a pointless discussion
2016-09-09 07:22:31	djdementia	circlejerk yourself, i'm out of this circle
2016-09-09 07:22:39	DashZanger	why are you angry
2016-09-09 07:22:40	pentaquark	whoa
2016-09-09 07:22:57	pentaquark	djdementia all discussions about opinions are pointless, unless you want to learn about that person.
2016-09-09 07:23:33	AdmiralBumbleBee	djdementia: you're talking to a dude that won't make his own synth, because he wants something ready made
2016-09-09 07:23:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	djdementia: so... keep the hypocrisy in mind.
2016-09-09 07:23:55	DashZanger	AdmiralBumbleBee, your answer will be replied with an appropriate response
2016-09-09 07:24:01	pentaquark	i only make music with sine waves
2016-09-09 07:24:04	DashZanger	which is that you dont grow your own chickens when you make an omelette
2016-09-09 07:24:05	pentaquark	your argument is invalid
2016-09-09 07:24:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	pentaquark: as do we all
2016-09-09 07:24:12	DashZanger	so you are not in a position to say anything
2016-09-09 07:24:14	DashZanger	AdmiralBumbleBee,
2016-09-09 07:24:20	pentaquark	nah son, 100% additive :D

2016-09-09 07:24:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	regardless
2016-09-09 07:24:52	AdmiralBumbleBee	the point is that you are demeaning someone for 'cheating' at making beats

2016-09-09 07:26:31	DashZanger	calling me a dumbfuck doesnt really add anything to this conversation
2016-09-09 07:27:00	pentaquark	well I for one have gained more respect for AdmiralBumbleBee
2016-09-09 07:27:12	pentaquark	so at least he has that goin for him.

2016-09-09 11:51:50	Red-Sox	Is there an app like UAD's mixer that hosts VSTs?
2016-09-09 11:52:10	Red-Sox	VSTs and not just UAD plug-ins
2016-09-09 11:52:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	Red-Sox: your DAW
2016-09-09 11:53:15	Red-Sox	Not the same
2016-09-09 11:53:48	Red-Sox	Because UAD's mixer provides zero-latency monitoring for tracking and the ability to print effects to audio on the way in
2016-09-09 11:54:53	Red-Sox	both of which are ideal for tracking vox
2016-09-09 11:57:56	_Hex_	anyone using logic? my neighbor is upgrading to a SSD
2016-09-09 11:58:11	_Hex_	and he was saying he might need to get a larger one as logic won't allow you to install content to a secondary drive or some shit
2016-09-09 11:58:18	_Hex_	i know he can go the symbolic link route
2016-09-09 11:58:27	_Hex_	but does it really not allow you to just choose a content folder on install?
2016-09-09 12:00:11	_Hex_	Red-Sox: uhhh..why would you want to print effects on input?
2016-09-09 12:00:27	_Hex_	why don't you simply monitor through them?
2016-09-09 12:00:32	_Hex_	on any daw
2016-09-09 12:00:48	Red-Sox	lots of producers to compression on the way in
2016-09-09 12:01:02	_Hex_	sure..but that happens in the analog domain..not the digital one
2016-09-09 12:01:12	_Hex_	so there is zero point compressing on the input..you can monitor with compression..sure
2016-09-09 12:01:20	_Hex_	but you're literally gaining nothing by printing with digital effects
2016-09-09 12:01:27	Red-Sox	except CPU, and workflow
2016-09-09 12:01:37	Red-Sox	I just like having light compression printed on the waveform
2016-09-09 12:01:52	_Hex_	then any DAW will let you do that
2016-09-09 12:01:57	Red-Sox	fewer inserts and it just works better for me
2016-09-09 12:01:59	_Hex_	if you really want to
2016-09-09 12:02:03	_Hex_	but it's kind of insane if you ask me
2016-09-09 12:02:21	Red-Sox	It's totally not
2016-09-09 12:02:27	_Hex_	well..yeah..it totally is
2016-09-09 12:02:28	_Hex_	but okay
2016-09-09 12:02:33	_Hex_	anyway..any daw will let you do that
2016-09-09 12:02:44	Red-Sox	Yeah I currently do it in PT
2016-09-09 12:02:57	Red-Sox	but it's still kind of annoying, I like that the UAD thing is basically a console before the DAW
2016-09-09 12:03:12	_Hex_	how is it annoying? you put the compressor on the input chanenl
2016-09-09 12:03:15	Red-Sox	and so many people do software compression before the daw, lol
2016-09-09 12:03:17	_Hex_	record that input channel
2016-09-09 12:03:31	_Hex_	well..no...i don't think many people do software compression before the daw
2016-09-09 12:03:31	Red-Sox	Because I don't want to have an extra track just for that purpose
2016-09-09 12:03:45	Red-Sox	Sure they do
2016-09-09 12:03:48	Red-Sox	zakk cervini, dave pensado
2016-09-09 12:04:01	_Hex_	*sigh*
2016-09-09 12:04:26	_Hex_	typically you'd compress pre-daw so you can control the signal level going into the DAW along with tone
2016-09-09 12:04:47	_Hex_	in software you're not getting any control of signal level going into the DAW..so you're doing it purely for tone
2016-09-09 12:04:51	_Hex_	in which case just monitor with it
2016-09-09 12:05:08	Red-Sox	But it's not just about the tone of the compressor for monitoring
2016-09-09 12:05:17	_Hex_	what is it about then?
2016-09-09 12:05:27	Red-Sox	it's also about lightly taming the dynamics before heavy compression and limiting later on in the chain
2016-09-09 12:05:53	_Hex_	and why are you "lightly taming the dynamics"?
2016-09-09 12:06:01	_Hex_	i can see why you would in the analog world as you're recording
2016-09-09 12:06:01		[12:06]
2016-09-09 12:06:08	_Hex_	to prevent overs on your recording interface
2016-09-09 12:06:24	_Hex_	but in the DAW you've already passed through your A/D before you hit UAD/DAW/whatever
2016-09-09 12:06:28	_Hex_	so at that point you're only doing it for tone
2016-09-09 12:06:38	Red-Sox	Well, not exactly
2016-09-09 12:06:46	_Hex_	...
2016-09-09 12:07:02	Red-Sox	I mean I see your point, and like I said I know there is technically no difference between printing it and using an insert in the first slot of your channel
2016-09-09 12:07:18	Red-Sox	But I would rather be working with fewer inserts and just go ahead and commit what I know I'll want anyway
2016-09-09 12:07:28	_Hex_	you sound exactly like my cousin
2016-09-09 12:07:38	_Hex_	i've had this conversation with him before
2016-09-09 12:07:45	_Hex_	and it's always like playing chess with a pigeon
2016-09-09 12:07:58	Red-Sox	I'm not sure why you care what works for me.
2016-09-09 12:07:59	_Hex_	are you recording at 32bit float in your DAW?
2016-09-09 12:08:14	Red-Sox	No
2016-09-09 12:08:21	_Hex_	well..then..technically there will be a difference
2016-09-09 12:08:38	_Hex_	if you're processing anything on input then record at 32bit float
2016-09-09 12:08:56	Red-Sox	But that difference isn't really noticeable
2016-09-09 12:09:22	_Hex_	it can add up
2016-09-09 12:09:23	Red-Sox	Especially if the levels are where they should bew
2016-09-09 12:09:24	Red-Sox	be*
2016-09-09 12:09:33	_Hex_	anyway..back to the point
2016-09-09 12:09:38	_Hex_	throw it on an input channel
2016-09-09 12:09:41	_Hex_	hide the track
2016-09-09 12:09:48	_Hex_	far easier than dealing with the UAD console
2016-09-09 12:09:57	_Hex_	or..if you're not mental
2016-09-09 12:10:04	_Hex_	just monitor through your chain and record away
2016-09-09 12:10:20	_Hex_	any software compressor is taking fuck all DSP
2016-09-09 12:10:34	Red-Sox	It's not so much about DSP as it is about workflow
2016-09-09 12:10:47	_Hex_	uh huh
2016-09-09 12:10:57	_Hex_	well you have your solution
2016-09-09 12:11:02	Red-Sox	Plus I like to see the compression on the waveform
2016-09-09 12:11:29	Red-Sox	Your solution is already what I do :p
2016-09-09 12:11:31	_Hex_	if you're "Seeing" the compression..it's unlikely you're treating anything likely
2016-09-09 12:11:34	_Hex_	err..lightly
2016-09-09 12:11:48	Red-Sox	Lol
2016-09-09 12:12:06	Red-Sox	I don't think we're going to agree on this
2016-09-09 12:12:09	_Hex_	no..we're not
2016-09-09 12:12:32	Red-Sox	I do know this is not as rare as you seem to think it is, but it's mostly done with uad
2016-09-09 12:12:38	Red-Sox	well, always as far as I've seen
2016-09-09 12:12:49	_Hex_	i know it's done
2016-09-09 12:13:03	_Hex_	but the reasons for doing it are not valid

2016-09-09 12:13:21	Red-Sox	valid!
2016-09-09 12:13:47	_Hex_	you're free to like what you want
2016-09-09 12:13:52	_Hex_	but in terms of a technical reason
2016-09-09 12:13:56	_Hex_	i've yet to see one valid one
2016-09-09 12:14:28	_Hex_	as i said ..you sound exactly like my cousin
2016-09-09 12:14:32	Red-Sox	But it's not always about technicalities
2016-09-09 12:14:33	_Hex_	he always prints shit on input
2016-09-09 12:14:35	_Hex_	always
2016-09-09 12:14:39	_Hex_	because of the "workflow"
2016-09-09 12:14:45	_Hex_	and i always laugh watching him record
2016-09-09 12:14:45	Red-Sox	It's inspiring to me
2016-09-09 12:14:48	_Hex_	when he has to redo shit
2016-09-09 12:14:56	_Hex_	because he fucked up the recording process and there's zero chance of undo
2016-09-09 12:15:02	Red-Sox	Well if you have to re-do it you're doing it wrong
2016-09-09 12:15:04	_Hex_	got to the point he was tracking with autotune too
2016-09-09 12:15:08	_Hex_	idiot
2016-09-09 12:15:16	Red-Sox	I know people who do that too
2016-09-09 12:15:20	Red-Sox	and, guess what, it works for them!
2016-09-09 12:15:39	Red-Sox	Someone who produced on the new meghan trainor record does that
2016-09-09 12:15:49	Red-Sox	same with the new blink record
2016-09-09 12:15:56	Red-Sox	like, it works for people... and there are nor ules

2016-09-09 12:16:04	_Hex_	yeah..believe be
2016-09-09 12:16:09	_Hex_	i get shit to mix where people have done that
2016-09-09 12:16:12	_Hex_	and it's a fucking pain

2016-09-09 12:18:51	djdementia	fuck no
2016-09-09 12:19:04	_Hex_	unrelated..but thank god avid finally unbundled HD software from their hardware
2016-09-09 12:19:06	djdementia	it is all propriatary Red-Sox
2016-09-09 12:19:19	djdementia	i'll briefly explain it
2016-09-09 12:19:20	_Hex_	djdementia: you misunderstood the question..not about hosting UAD plugs
2016-09-09 12:19:35	_Hex_	he was after more of a pre-processing vst host
2016-09-09 12:19:40	_Hex_	which runs as a separate app
2016-09-09 12:19:49	_Hex_	to make things more complicated ;)
2016-09-09 12:20:00	Red-Sox	:p
2016-09-09 12:20:07	djdementia	sounds like he was wonderign if you could have generic DSP hardware that works with all VST?
2016-09-09 12:20:13	_Hex_	no
2016-09-09 12:20:17	Red-Sox	no
2016-09-09 12:20:31	djdementia	ah ok
2016-09-09 12:20:35	Red-Sox	I also use slate VMS, _Hex_
2016-09-09 12:20:47	_Hex_	then perfect
2016-09-09 12:20:48	Red-Sox	and sometimes it would be cool to print the mic model to the track like you're actually using that mic
2016-09-09 12:20:54	_Hex_	slate's processors are zero latency
2016-09-09 12:20:57	djdementia	well Red-Sox i have something like that with my tascam but like the UAD it only works with the few tascam effects
2016-09-09 12:21:04	djdementia	like reverb and compression
2016-09-09 12:21:04		[12:21]

2016-09-09 12:21:49	djdementia	there isn't even any expanded or extra plugins you can buy
2016-09-09 12:21:53	djdementia	just a handful of stock
2016-09-09 12:22:14	djdementia	i have tried the reverb while recording and monitoring vocals but thats about it
2016-09-09 12:22:16	Red-Sox	it can be the only vocal mic you need for sure
2016-09-09 12:22:30	Red-Sox	still sounds pretty cool djdementia
2016-09-09 12:22:47	djdementia	presonus had that too with their VSL line
2016-09-09 12:22:56	djdementia	but then Apple changed Core audio that broke that function
2016-09-09 12:23:09	djdementia	and Presonus said fuck it and jus completely dropped support for that function =(
2016-09-09 12:23:41	Red-Sox	bummer, yeah sounds useful

2016-09-09 12:37:58	_Hex_	and you want to A/B
2016-09-09 12:38:07	_Hex_	you set it on a new track..route that trakc to another set of outs
2016-09-09 12:38:16	_Hex_	and then in the control room add that other out as a monitor source
2016-09-09 12:38:24	_Hex_	then with a key command you can switch between monitor sources
2016-09-09 12:38:32	_Hex_	no locating tracks to solo..no worring about master bus fx
2016-09-09 12:38:41	_Hex_	also amazing for isolating shit like reverb only

2016-09-09 12:42:28	Red-Sox	isn't it like a right-click on the region, choose something, then a window comes up, then you change the pitch, then commit it to the audio?
2016-09-09 12:42:30	Red-Sox	or something like that?
2016-09-09 12:42:35	_Hex_	oh god no
2016-09-09 12:42:40	_Hex_	that was in maybe v3
2016-09-09 12:42:46	Red-Sox	ohh, what is it now?
2016-09-09 12:42:52	_Hex_	now you can just click on any region and change the pitch
2016-09-09 12:42:59	_Hex_	that'll do a full transpose
2016-09-09 12:43:02	Red-Sox	non-destructive?
2016-09-09 12:43:04	_Hex_	if you want to melodyne stuff
2016-09-09 12:43:12	_Hex_	then just double click and you're now in melodyne style view
2016-09-09 12:43:17	_Hex_	and yes..completely non-destructive
2016-09-09 12:43:38	_Hex_	if you have a moment to watch something
2016-09-09 12:43:38	Red-Sox	yeah I knew about the tuning thing

2016-09-09 12:43:59	Red-Sox	yeah send it

2016-09-09 12:44:34	Red-Sox	not track, clip
2016-09-09 12:45:06	_Hex_	yes
2016-09-09 12:45:13	Red-Sox	oh, weird
2016-09-09 12:45:16	Red-Sox	noisia said you couldn't :p
2016-09-09 12:45:32	_Hex_	i am probably using a version noisia isn't
2016-09-09 12:45:51	Red-Sox	oh nice!!
2016-09-09 12:45:53	Red-Sox	that video
2016-09-09 12:46:38	_Hex_	pretty insane that it'll rework all your audio in realtime
2016-09-09 12:46:47	_Hex_	to follow the chord track + register you set the track in
2016-09-09 12:46:57	Red-Sox	Yeah I'm more impressed by follow chord track
2016-09-09 12:47:04	Red-Sox	does it just look at the lowest note?
2016-09-09 12:47:11	_Hex_	no idea what it's doing behind the scenes
2016-09-09 12:47:20	_Hex_	but chord track has completely changed the way i work
2016-09-09 12:47:32	Red-Sox	oh you have to manually enter the chords?
2016-09-09 12:47:41	_Hex_	yes..however it can also suggest things
2016-09-09 12:47:46	Red-Sox	oh
2016-09-09 12:47:48	_Hex_	i.e. if you enter "C"
2016-09-09 12:47:48	Red-Sox	that's a cool idea
2016-09-09 12:47:51	_Hex_	it'll suggest the next one
2016-09-09 12:47:54	_Hex_	etc
2016-09-09 12:47:57	Red-Sox	right right
2016-09-09 12:47:59	_Hex_	sort of like setting up markers
2016-09-09 12:48:03	_Hex_	do it once..done
2016-09-09 12:48:11	Red-Sox	Yeah that's nice
2016-09-09 12:48:18	_Hex_	but it goes back to the pitch question
2016-09-09 12:48:20	Red-Sox	In cubase I love the all folder
2016-09-09 12:48:24	Red-Sox	which is so stupid and simple
2016-09-09 12:48:33	_Hex_	you can set events to pitch by following root key

2016-09-09 12:48:38	--	bpe is now known as adq
2016-09-09 12:48:41	_Hex_	so you can transpose the entire session up/down
2016-09-09 12:48:45	_Hex_	and have everything but drums follow
2016-09-09 12:48:46	_Hex_	or whatever
2016-09-09 12:48:52	Red-Sox	oh cool!
2016-09-09 12:50:06	Red-Sox	also sick in cubase is the bounce to session feature
2016-09-09 12:50:20	Red-Sox	or idk what it's called, but I have seen my friend export a track and have it automatically imported back into the session
2016-09-09 12:50:24	_Hex_	render in place
2016-09-09 12:50:40	Red-Sox	right, which is subtly different then freeze/flatten in Live
2016-09-09 12:51:01	_Hex_	yeah..RIP is awesome for printing VSTi shit
2016-09-09 12:51:04	_Hex_	or guitar amp sims

2016-09-09 12:51:36	Red-Sox	however you can't do that with groups or busses
2016-09-09 12:53:53	_Hex_	no..personally i use RIP more for rendering VSTi
2016-09-09 12:54:00	_Hex_	super fast

2016-09-09 13:01:39	_Hex_	and there are also display prefs to deal with things
2016-09-09 13:01:47	_Hex_	but yeah..if you use the default track color..transparency settings

2016-09-10 07:09:20	DashZanger	yea the kick is very powerful DylanT
2016-09-10 07:10:37	DashZanger	the kick itself sounds fine, but its too loud
2016-09-10 07:10:46	DashZanger	and maybe a tad too mid-heavy as well
2016-09-10 07:10:50	DashZanger	not much, but a bit
2016-09-10 07:11:19	DashZanger	though it depends if you want the kick to control the groove of the beat
2016-09-10 07:11:28	DashZanger	in which case it can have those mids
2016-09-10 07:13:54	DashZanger	low-mids*

2016-09-10 08:17:12	DashZanger	PersonaSound, that bass is sick
2016-09-10 08:17:18	alanjohn	I have a question: is there any VST that allows me to set specific bands to mono and "stereoize" others?
2016-09-10 08:17:29	PersonaSound	ty
2016-09-10 08:17:41	PersonaSound	maximus
2016-09-10 08:17:43	alanjohn	I've been using fruity stereo shaper with 2 track clones but that seems counter intuitive
2016-09-10 08:17:53	alanjohn	yes yes I know but I use that on my master
2016-09-10 08:18:05	alanjohn	and it doesnt give me much freedom
2016-09-10 08:18:29	Kimryd	ozone

2016-09-10 08:19:37	alanjohn	yeah
2016-09-10 08:19:44	alanjohn	i know there was some program in ableton that does that
2016-09-10 08:19:56	alanjohn	monos the lows automatically

2016-09-10 08:20:30	alanjohn	well you know what i mean
2016-09-10 08:20:30	Kimryd	But you can make a multi-band fx rack

2016-09-10 08:21:05	alanjohn	like a sausage fattener but for stereo seperation
2016-09-10 08:21:05		[08:21]
2016-09-10 08:21:10	Kimryd	ozone
2016-09-10 08:21:19	alanjohn	which ozone
2016-09-10 08:21:22	Kimryd	all of them
2016-09-10 08:21:24	alanjohn	i have like 20 of them installed
2016-09-10 08:21:24	PersonaSound	alrighty
2016-09-10 08:21:27	httpster	alanjohn: splitting your signal is all fine and that but you're gonna get some possible phasing issues because your signal chain needs to be identical on each track because each vst introduces some lag to the output
2016-09-10 08:21:49	alanjohn	ohhh thanks httpster i was wondering why i was getting phasing
2016-09-10 08:21:53	alanjohn	this explains a lot
2016-09-10 08:21:54	Kimryd	When you install ozone, it installs the ozone "master" and then the individual modules
2016-09-10 08:22:12	alanjohn	yeah each time i open ozone my pc goes flat :P
2016-09-10 08:22:32	Kimryd	That's why you use the indivual module
2016-09-10 08:22:39	Kimryd	The one you want is the Imager
2016-09-10 08:22:57	httpster	alanjohn: you can try that, send the same track to two mixer tracks and on one, dont load anything, on the other, load for example a compressor or two. it'll phase even if the comp doesnt do anything
2016-09-10 08:23:08	httpster	alanjohn: but y eah, i think maximus does what you want
2016-09-10 08:23:39	httpster	alanjohn: http://www.gvst.co.uk/beta.htm gstereo will do it for free

2016-09-10 08:25:15	alanjohn	:(
2016-09-10 08:25:38	httpster	alanjohn: just make sure you're using the same amount of plugins on each track (same plugins, same order) with more or less the same settings sans for the stereo difference you want to have
2016-09-10 08:25:45	alanjohn	i already have like 3 different multiband compressers tho
2016-09-10 08:25:50	httpster	alanjohn: also make sure you have PDC turned on
2016-09-10 08:26:01	Kimryd	"Adjust compression, stereo width and level for each band."
2016-09-10 08:26:12	alanjohn	yes Maximus and MBC do that
2016-09-10 08:26:43	Kimryd	But it'll let you set the space between sub and treble to stereo
2016-09-10 08:27:06	alanjohn	>split audio into 3 bands
2016-09-10 08:27:16	Kimryd	Sub - mid - treble
2016-09-10 08:27:18	Kimryd	???
2016-09-10 08:27:55	alanjohn	Wait sorry i was an idiot
2016-09-10 08:28:01	Kimryd	Yeah
2016-09-10 08:28:03	alanjohn	I didn't explain it well enough
2016-09-10 08:28:28	alanjohn	What I mean is to set the small space between the sub and the bass
2016-09-10 08:28:34	alanjohn	it's something kshmr does, I read.
2016-09-10 08:28:55	Kimryd	You can adjust what the bands are
2016-09-10 08:29:01	httpster	alanjohn: you'll want to process your sub separately anyways imo
2016-09-10 08:29:12	Kimryd	yes
2016-09-10 08:29:26	httpster	the sub needs to be super tight or else you're gonna muddy everything down. subs eat the most headroom anyways so it's really important to get that down just right
2016-09-10 08:29:34	alanjohn	yeah that's why im going to use maximus, which has configurable bands, to set the "mid" band to actually be the space i'm aiming at
2016-09-10 08:29:56	httpster	alanjohn: well it should be possible with maximus. you can set the ranges wherever you want
2016-09-10 08:30:08	alanjohn	yep
2016-09-10 08:32:35	alanjohn	hmm now something fucked up and my chorus synth is fucking with my distorted bass
2016-09-10 08:34:03	alanjohn	nvm bad distortion

2016-09-10 13:16:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	Kimryd: and now you know how EQs work.
2016-09-10 13:17:11	Kimryd	I actually still don't get why filters affect phase AdmiralBumbleBee
2016-09-10 13:17:19	pentaquark	damn
2016-09-10 13:17:35	pentaquark	wonder if I should be throwing floats or ints for my setup
2016-09-10 13:17:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	Kimryd: think from the other direction...
2016-09-10 13:17:46	kerrang	i used to know the answer to that
2016-09-10 13:17:49	pentaquark	0-127 seems lighter than 0.4879999
2016-09-10 13:17:54	Kimryd	uhhhhh
2016-09-10 13:18:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	Kimryd: what if the phase is what affected the frequency response?
2016-09-10 13:18:09	pentaquark	filters affect phase in real time
2016-09-10 13:18:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	(talking iir here)
2016-09-10 13:18:51	pentaquark	PersonaSound is Sluggos still there?
2016-09-10 13:19:05	PersonaSound	who
2016-09-10 13:19:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	Kimryd: what if you had a phase rotation of half the signal... then added it with the original signal?
2016-09-10 13:19:08	AdmiralBumbleBee	Kimryd: what happens?
2016-09-10 13:19:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	you can discover the rest yourself
2016-09-10 13:19:28	Kimryd	hrrrm
2016-09-10 13:19:37	Kimryd	some kind of cancellation?

2016-09-10 13:20:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	Kimryd: if half the signal is rotated...
2016-09-10 13:21:03	Kimryd	Oh not inverted
2016-09-10 13:21:06	Kimryd	my bad
2016-09-10 13:21:10	Kimryd	Let me do it in live and see
2016-09-10 13:21:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	Kimryd: then think about what happens to phase and frequency if you shift a signal in time and add it to the original
2016-09-10 13:21:43	Kimryd	If I render out two sines and move one 180 degree I'll get the same effect yeag?
2016-09-10 13:21:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	Kimryd: try it
2016-09-10 13:21:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	you're a smart dude
2016-09-10 13:22:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	you'll see what happens
2016-09-10 13:22:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	do it with a square instead though.
2016-09-10 13:22:07	PersonaSound	pentaquark: who are you trying to dox lol
2016-09-10 13:22:12	Kimryd	alright

2016-09-10 13:51:07	hellohi	how can i achieve that?
2016-09-10 13:51:08	wrl	hellohi: compression
2016-09-10 13:51:09	PersonaSound	probably because it has an extremely catchy melody then

2016-09-10 13:51:31	wrl	the fewer sounds you have, the better the sounds that you have need to be
2016-09-10 13:51:55	hellohi	for example the song you just sent
2016-09-10 13:52:20	hellohi	it has just kick, clap, shakers and impact at the begining and it still sounds full/good
2016-09-10 13:52:41	wrl	hellohi: imo, smart and tasteful compression on the drum bus
2016-09-10 13:52:43	wrl	in this case
2016-09-10 13:53:23	hellohi	i think it has more than that
2016-09-10 13:54:14	hellohi	it doesn't sound so dry or generic or weak like i would make it for example
2016-09-10 13:54:18	AdmiralBumbleBee	hellohi: yeah, well.. since you know, why don't YOU tell us how it's done then?

2016-09-10 13:55:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	hellohi: if you don't know, step one is to acknowledge that you're not in a position to tell someone that they're incorrect when they answer you
2016-09-10 13:55:57	DashZanger	hellohi, its basically all in the quality of the sounds they use
2016-09-10 13:56:10	hellohi	where i said that, are you kidding me?
2016-09-10 13:56:10		[13:56]
2016-09-10 13:56:16	DashZanger	which includes the sample quality, usage of effects like compression etc.
2016-09-10 13:56:28	hellohi	i said i think it has more that that
2016-09-10 13:56:37	DashZanger	basically, in a song like gecko, all the elements of the track are "perfected"
2016-09-10 13:56:37	PersonaSound	it's all about the oomph, isn't that right raz
2016-09-10 13:56:43	DashZanger	and the melody is catchy
2016-09-10 13:56:46	raz	OOOOMPH
2016-09-10 13:56:52	PersonaSound	OOMPH!
2016-09-10 13:57:28	DashZanger	and by the melody being catchy, it makes up for the lack of elements in the track
2016-09-10 13:57:31	DashZanger	for say, sandstorm
2016-09-10 13:57:41	DashZanger	only thing there is are very simple drums and the dududududu
2016-09-10 13:57:51	hellohi	@DashZanger, what about the intro
2016-09-10 13:57:51	DashZanger	but the dudududu sounds so good as a synth, it carries the song
2016-09-10 13:57:56	hellohi	there is no melody
2016-09-10 13:58:20	DashZanger	hellohi, well done drums and the shaker is sweet
2016-09-10 13:58:33	DashZanger	id say without the shaker the intro would sound boring
2016-09-10 13:58:37	DashZanger	very boring, in fact
2016-09-10 13:58:53	DashZanger	because the shaker is what moves the song onwards in the intro
2016-09-10 13:58:58	DashZanger	or rather, the beat
2016-09-10 13:59:34	hellohi	yeah but he kick and clap are pretty standard ones, they are probably from vengeance samples
2016-09-10 13:59:39	DashZanger	sure
2016-09-10 13:59:55	DashZanger	but it isnt about where the samples are from, its about what moves the song onwards

2016-09-10 14:06:21	BizCaus	gross
2016-09-10 14:06:52	DashZanger	hellohi, but id say the shaker in that beat is what counts the most, not how the kick and the snare were processed
2016-09-10 14:06:56	droxpopuli	PersonaSound, just "bass music" of all kinds
2016-09-10 14:07:00	DashZanger	because that clearly a sampled real shaker
2016-09-10 14:07:22	droxpopuli	BizCaus, not gross im in a groove and im living cheap
2016-09-10 14:07:24	DashZanger	sounds soft in the ear and "genuine"

2016-09-10 14:07:50	BizCaus	and poor people
2016-09-10 14:07:56	DashZanger	you can compare it like a synthesized guitar vs a real guitar
2016-09-10 14:08:01	droxpopuli	i said cheap. not like a poor person
2016-09-10 14:08:07	DashZanger	you can tell the difference easily and the real guitar sounds better

2016-09-10 14:09:26	hellohi	lets talk about the melody at 1:06
2016-09-10 14:09:46	hellohi	what effects do you think were used?
2016-09-10 14:10:29	DashZanger	from the starters of course some highpass to blend the melody into the song
2016-09-10 14:11:11	DashZanger	reverb, maybe a very, very short delay or just the retrigger of the original sound
2016-09-10 14:11:11		[14:11]
2016-09-10 14:11:12	pentaquark	lol i cant make up my mind on this API
2016-09-10 14:11:30	pentaquark	should I throw control data at milliseconds?
2016-09-10 14:11:38	pentaquark	I guess that makes the most sense as the basic unit
2016-09-10 14:12:02	DashZanger	around 1:17 the reverb adds up more, then the highpass kicks in to buildup for the drop

2016-09-10 14:13:07	hellohi	the reverb is very little right, almost not noticeable?
2016-09-10 14:13:18	DashZanger	it is noticeable in the start
2016-09-10 14:13:34	DashZanger	otherwise the sound would just end flatly
2016-09-10 14:13:45	DashZanger	and it doesnt sound like it has lot of release
2016-09-10 14:14:27	DashZanger	id put my bets on reverb
2016-09-10 14:15:10	hellohi	what about the delay, is it 1/16?
2016-09-10 14:16:00	httpster	i'd use dotted rhythms myself
2016-09-10 14:16:32	DashZanger	cant really tell, whatever the delay is its very short
2016-09-10 14:16:34	DashZanger	if it is there at all
2016-09-10 14:16:50	DashZanger	its in some parts of the song but in that 1:06 part, i dunno

2016-09-10 14:18:09	DashZanger	yea
2016-09-10 14:18:15	hellohi	it is probabbly some massive preset

2016-09-10 16:00:32	PersonaSound	i'm not sure if you're modulating the wavetable or not but it's probably that, at the end it's moving through a different part of the wavetable giving it that squelch, to get rid of you could sustain the modulation before that point
2016-09-10 16:02:26	Opeth	I think that might be the pitch going down that's causing it actually.

2016-09-11 05:15:52	AdmiralBumbleBee	that's what I use my compressor for usually
2016-09-11 05:16:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'm really liking this ml8000
2016-09-11 05:17:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	I don't want to buy shit right now though
2016-09-11 05:17:05	AdmiralBumbleBee	but it sounds so good :(
2016-09-11 05:17:13	kerrang	Brought: an audio compressor is used to reduce the dynamic range of an audio signal, if the sound goes past a set threshold then the compressor reduces the volume to keep the sound around the threshold
2016-09-11 05:17:35	kerrang	it's basically a very fast gain knob
2016-09-11 05:17:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: a compressor can increase the dynamic range of a signal, depending on the controls provided...
2016-09-11 05:17:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	because you know... english is wonderful.
2016-09-11 05:18:27	Brought	Thanks brb
2016-09-11 05:18:48	kerrang	compression, expansion, it's all the same to the marketing department
2016-09-11 05:18:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: just compression.
2016-09-11 05:19:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: think about a signal that is just straight up white noise with the occasional transient peak
2016-09-11 05:19:14	kerrang	AdmiralBumbleBee: oh so you're not referring to when the ratio control can go in the other direction
2016-09-11 05:19:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: toss a compressor on there so it only catches the peak... long release
2016-09-11 05:19:38	kerrang	ah
2016-09-11 05:19:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: long release will cause the non-transient material to be compressed
2016-09-11 05:19:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	thereby increasing the overall dynamic range
2016-09-11 05:20:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	(obviously the attack needs to let the transient through)
2016-09-11 05:20:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	regardless
2016-09-11 05:20:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's very easy to increase dynamic range with a compressor.
2016-09-11 05:20:18	AdmiralBumbleBee	no expansion or anything.
2016-09-11 05:20:45	kerrang	that's cool, i always forget to consider the effects of attack and release
2016-09-11 05:21:15	kerrang	just shows how knowledgable i am
2016-09-11 05:21:27	Nahck	doesnt material with a big dynamic range have loud peaks AND quiet stuffs
2016-09-11 05:21:51	kerrang	yes, and?
2016-09-11 05:22:02	Nahck	dynamic range, the stuff between the quiet and the loud
2016-09-11 05:22:17	Nahck	if u compress theres less of a dynamic range
2016-09-11 05:22:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: I just explained why that's not always true.

2016-09-11 05:23:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	no I wasn't
2016-09-11 05:24:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	look at what I said, I explicitly said that the signal has transients
2016-09-11 05:24:07	kerrang	"white noise with the occasional transient peak"

2016-09-11 05:25:47	kerrang	still super super vague
2016-09-11 05:25:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: look at that and imagine that the release stage is much longer.
2016-09-11 05:26:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: and hence your peak to RMS ratio is _increased_, meaning more dynamic range
2016-09-11 05:27:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	you could get even nuttier results with different attack/release curves and extreme threshold values
2016-09-11 05:28:51	Nahck	uhum the dynamic ranges look pretty much the same
2016-09-11 05:29:04	Nahck	the waveforms different tho
2016-09-11 05:29:14	kerrang	imagine with a longer release
2016-09-11 05:29:17	kerrang	like much longer
2016-09-11 05:29:18	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: ok, is english not your first language?

2016-09-11 05:29:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	if so, I can try to be more simple
2016-09-11 05:31:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	Nahck: if you allow the compressor to neglect touching the peaks, but allow the release to squash the rest of your signal... you can _increase_ dynamic range
2016-09-11 05:31:03	Nahck	the loudest signals dont move anywhere and neither do the quietest
2016-09-11 05:31:21	AdmiralBumbleBee	alright, well... I tried.
2016-09-11 05:37:00		[05:31]
2016-09-11 05:41:43	DashZanger	Nahck, the point probably is that you can increase dynamic range by increasing the release until it only activates until the last peak of the sound which you see there
2016-09-11 05:41:58	DashZanger	or if the sound is short enough, not at all

2016-09-11 05:51:32	Nahck	so if i take a 4bit signal and put it in a 24bit daw and compress it its dynamic range will increase right

2016-09-11 05:52:41		[05:52]
2016-09-11 05:55:08	Nahck	if i take a 24bit square in a 24bit daw it'll become something of a saw wave

2016-09-11 06:49:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	_Hex_: you can't install win 10 from win 7 or 8 without a working key from the previous OS
2016-09-11 06:49:56	subsignal	i raged for a good 3 hours
2016-09-11 06:49:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	_Hex_: win 8.1 works fine however.
2016-09-11 06:50:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	subsignal: an oem license is only like $15 on ebay
2016-09-11 06:50:27	subsignal	hhahaah i know but gdit!

2016-09-11 06:50:36	subsignal	at some point ill break down and do it
2016-09-11 06:50:38	_Hex_	hold on
2016-09-11 06:50:41	_Hex_	is your computer activated?

2016-09-11 06:51:05	_Hex_	why don't you install kmspico or whatever the fuck
2016-09-11 06:51:08	_Hex_	activate your win7
2016-09-11 06:51:17	_Hex_	and use that to upgrade to win10
2016-09-11 06:51:24	subsignal	could try
2016-09-11 06:51:51	subsignal	im still kinda raging about it so ill have to wait till after this deadline monday
2016-09-11 06:52:42	_Hex_	i wonder if i should just go ahead with this update
2016-09-11 06:52:45	_Hex_	throw caution to the wind
2016-09-11 06:52:59	subsignal	i keep hearing its been great
2016-09-11 06:53:06	subsignal	havent actually tested myself
2016-09-11 06:53:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	I've heard that it's actually quite good'
2016-09-11 06:53:53	subsignal	yea same
2016-09-11 06:53:55	_Hex_	the anniversary update?
2016-09-11 06:53:58	subsignal	thats why i broke down and bought 10
2016-09-11 06:54:02	_Hex_	or 10 in general
2016-09-11 06:54:12	subsignal	10 in general
2016-09-11 06:54:17	_Hex_	oh..yeah..10 is fucking awesome
2016-09-11 06:54:19	_Hex_	i love it

2016-09-11 06:54:30	subsignal	?
2016-09-11 06:54:33	_Hex_	i liked it
2016-09-11 06:54:37	subsignal	ok see now
2016-09-11 06:54:37	_Hex_	better than 7
2016-09-11 06:54:40	_Hex_	but i love 10
2016-09-11 06:54:45	bongofury	cant stand 10
2016-09-11 06:54:48	subsignal	i tried 7 went back to 7
2016-09-11 06:54:51	subsignal	8*
2016-09-11 06:55:00	_Hex_	people didn't like 8 because of the metro start menu
2016-09-11 06:55:03	_Hex_	but that's about the only reason
2016-09-11 06:55:09	_Hex_	8.1 improved on things
2016-09-11 06:55:12	bongofury	no, 8 is metro'ed up
2016-09-11 06:55:14	_Hex_	and 10 improved more
2016-09-11 06:55:22	bongofury	8.1 made it de-Metro able
2016-09-11 06:55:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	you can just install classic shell anyway
2016-09-11 06:55:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	it doesn't matter
2016-09-11 06:55:27	_Hex_	fuck classic shell
2016-09-11 06:55:34	_Hex_	anyone who changes their OS
2016-09-11 06:55:34	bongofury	yeah but 10 spies on you
2016-09-11 06:55:35	subsignal	mMMMm classic shell
2016-09-11 06:55:37	_Hex_	is just asking for trouble
2016-09-11 06:55:48	_Hex_	bongofury: that's stretching it a bit
2016-09-11 06:55:50	bongofury	you can disable the spy network on 8.1
2016-09-11 06:55:51	subsignal	bongofury: but does it really..

2016-09-11 06:56:18	bongofury	Why does my audio workstation need to be running TSR keyloggers that I can't see or disable?  Can you splain me that one?
2016-09-11 06:56:30	subsignal	user experience
2016-09-11 06:56:38	subsignal	see what ur doing where to improve

2016-09-11 06:56:56	subsignal	from a developers prospective it makes sense
2016-09-11 06:57:03	subsignal	but we know thats not why they do it lets be real
2016-09-11 06:57:13	bongofury	8.1 > 10

2016-09-11 06:58:12	bongofury	I havent

2016-09-11 06:58:44	_Hex_	and update this

2016-09-11 07:01:38	_Hex_	if after a reboot i'm not back in 30
2016-09-11 07:01:42	_Hex_	shit went terribly wrong
2016-09-11 07:01:54	_Hex_	i will be interested to see how all the plugins handle this
2016-09-11 07:01:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's windows, if after a reboot and you come back anyway
2016-09-11 07:01:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's a miracle
2016-09-11 07:02:01	bongofury	thats quite optimistic for a windows install :)
2016-09-11 07:02:10	subsignal	i will have to say they rolled back the update when it didnt work without a problem

2016-09-11 07:03:23	bongofury	its as if they enjoy pollution
2016-09-11 07:03:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's just wear on components to turn it on/off

2016-09-11 11:00:14	kerrang	I'd love to try cubase again, it's been a looong time

2016-09-11 11:01:13	kerrang	(part of that is honestly from reading your blog posts but w/e)
2016-09-11 11:01:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	Cubase is extremely legit.
2016-09-11 11:01:37	AdmiralBumbleBee	for anyone, doing any type of music
2016-09-11 11:01:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	I can't say I'd recommend any DAW blindly except Cubase or Logic
2016-09-11 11:02:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	they are both well setup for any type of music production
2016-09-11 11:04:22	kerrang	Yeah, cubase may be my next daw when I'm ready to transition
2016-09-11 11:09:19	bongofury	Id recommend Ableton or Sonar blindly
2016-09-11 11:09:40	bongofury	both do multitrack recording and editing, which is what people would be asking me about
2016-09-11 11:09:57	bongofury	button mashers can use any fucking DAW
2016-09-11 11:09:59	bongofury	doesn't matter
2016-09-11 11:09:59		[11:09]
2016-09-11 11:10:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	sonar looks ok-ish
2016-09-11 11:10:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	ableton is extremely limited if you're doing much audio recording
2016-09-11 11:11:28	bongofury	howso
2016-09-11 11:11:36	kerrang	I can't speak for anything for recording since I don't do that much, but I had so many problems with ableton
2016-09-11 11:11:59	kerrang	crashed frequently on me
2016-09-11 11:12:24	kerrang	and i'm not a fan of how they've approached max4live, but honestly no much anyone could've done there
2016-09-11 11:12:55	kerrang	and for what it is, the price is not worth it
2016-09-11 11:13:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	bongofury: ableton doesn't have edit groups, doesn't compensate for delay when using input monitoring, lacks event groups, difficult to manage large projects with recording etc..
2016-09-11 11:14:38	AdmiralBumbleBee	live doesn't have any way to manage input devices properly (rename, bundle etc..), metering is very limited, editing commands are exceptionally limited, no multitrack warping
2016-09-11 11:14:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	I can go on
2016-09-11 11:15:00	bongofury	some of those I believe are there
2016-09-11 11:15:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	just the simple act of working with a ~18 track drum recording is very painful in live.

2016-09-11 11:15:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	which is fine
2016-09-11 11:15:18	bongofury	oh sure
2016-09-11 11:15:23	bongofury	I'd use Sonar for that :)
2016-09-11 11:15:28	AdmiralBumbleBee	live does other shit you can't do in other DAWs except bitwig
2016-09-11 11:15:34	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's just not made for certain things
2016-09-11 11:15:43	bongofury	but if you are doing recording multitrack and you have 18 drum tracks, somethings wrong
2016-09-11 11:15:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	but, as such, I'd never recommend it 'blindly' to someone.
2016-09-11 11:15:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	huh?
2016-09-11 11:15:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	18 tracks isn't even that much
2016-09-11 11:16:01	bongofury	yea it is

2016-09-11 11:16:24	bongofury	most people get by just fine with 2 stereo groups
2016-09-11 11:16:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	2-3 kick, 2 snare, 2-3 room, overheads, hat, ride bell, toms, spot mics
2016-09-11 11:17:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	plus auxillary percussion
2016-09-11 11:17:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	people come in here with chimes and gongs and weird fx cymbals and shit
2016-09-11 11:18:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	just my little 5 piece here that I have setup for myself is 15 channels
2016-09-11 11:18:34	AdmiralBumbleBee	sure you could get away with glyn johns shit, but not everyone wants to sound like the 70s
2016-09-11 11:18:57	bongofury	so yea
2016-09-11 11:19:06	AdmiralBumbleBee	and in no way am I saying that every channel that's recorded is used
2016-09-11 11:19:08	bongofury	id recommend sonar for that
2016-09-11 11:19:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	but you can't go back and toss on a snare-side mic after the fact
2016-09-11 11:19:20	bongofury	but just know that's overkill
2016-09-11 11:19:21	AdmiralBumbleBee	gotta do it when you do it
2016-09-11 11:19:50	bongofury	yea, if you wanna sound like the 80s
2016-09-11 11:19:55	bongofury	:)
2016-09-11 11:20:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	and in no way am I saying that every channel that's recorded is used <------
2016-09-11 11:20:30	bongofury	k
2016-09-11 11:20:38	bongofury	and i dont operate a commercial studio
2016-09-11 11:20:54	bongofury	but if i did, id grab sonar tomorrow
2016-09-11 11:21:05	bongofury	cuz almost all, if not all, of what you said applies
2016-09-11 11:21:14	bongofury	plus it has better MIDI handling than Cubase
2016-09-11 11:21:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	elaborate
2016-09-11 11:21:31	bongofury	it has a scripting language
2016-09-11 11:21:38	AdmiralBumbleBee	I'm not sure that sonar has anything like chord track, arranger, PLE
2016-09-11 11:21:43	bongofury	and great midi CC interfacing
2016-09-11 11:21:52	bongofury	im not either
2016-09-11 11:22:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	bongofury: Cubase has the project logical editor, which allows you to do logical manipulations of midi (e.g. scripting)
2016-09-11 11:22:05	bongofury	I also know that if you record midi impulses into Cubase, they dont exist
2016-09-11 11:22:16	bongofury	like if you have impulses from edrums
2016-09-11 11:22:32	bongofury	note on and note off events happen simultaneously, resulting in notes of length 0
2016-09-11 11:22:38	bongofury	and you can't like "fix" that
2016-09-11 11:22:47	bongofury	but in CAL you can run a 2 line script to fix it
2016-09-11 11:23:01	bongofury	and, just as easily, do whatever you want recursively on all the midi notes
2016-09-11 11:23:02	AdmiralBumbleBee	you can definitely fix that in cubase using the PLE
2016-09-11 11:23:14	bongofury	Not as of Cubase SX 2-3
2016-09-11 11:23:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	we're on Cubase 8.5 right now...
2016-09-11 11:23:37	bongofury	is that 8.5 from 5.0?
2016-09-11 11:23:44	bongofury	or8.5 from 1.0?
2016-09-11 11:23:47	bongofury	SX?
2016-09-11 11:24:01	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's from SX
2016-09-11 11:24:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	cubase SX was 1.0

2016-09-11 12:30:54	_Hex_	you lower the sperm count

2016-09-11 12:31:21	kerrang	aw shit
2016-09-11 12:31:24	_Hex_	then slower tempos start to sound fast
2016-09-11 12:31:30	_Hex_	and before you know it you're writing love ballads
2016-09-11 12:31:31	_Hex_	so...

2016-09-11 19:54:04	Bongofury	_Hex_ AdmiralBumbleBee inspired me to wire up all my mics tonight
2016-09-11 19:54:12	Bongofury	after we chatted about multitrack drums
2016-09-11 19:55:03	Audio_Bliss	how many channnel mixer were you using?

2016-09-11 19:55:57	Bongofury	can you see that?
2016-09-11 19:56:07	Bongofury	the bot has access, apparently, so im guessing the general public does
2016-09-11 19:56:33	Audio_Bliss	yup I see it
2016-09-11 19:56:41	Audio_Bliss	so just ambient micing?
2016-09-11 19:56:50	Audio_Bliss	nothing on specific drums?
2016-09-11 19:56:53	Bongofury	so the mics are kick, snaretop, snare bottom, 2 OHs, 2 exotic mics in the foreground about 5' away, and a floor tom mic
2016-09-11 19:56:54	_Hex_	nice
2016-09-11 19:56:59	_Hex_	you're getting a nice tone with that
2016-09-11 19:57:04	_Hex_	very usable
2016-09-11 19:57:25	Bongofury	the 2 "exotic" mics are 1) wide cardiod (Lissajous?) CAD M179, has selectable field, and is generally dark
2016-09-11 19:57:36	Bongofury	and the square one next to it with the gold pop screen
2016-09-11 19:57:43	Bongofury	is a Cad Equitek E100
2016-09-11 19:58:00	Audio_Bliss	I think it sounds great
2016-09-11 19:58:06	Bongofury	nothing else is remarkable, except the kick mic is an AKG D112 and thats a good mic and you should buy it
2016-09-11 19:58:10	Bongofury	thanks man
2016-09-11 19:58:26	Bongofury	just inverted the bottom snare mic, added a touch of pan on the two snare mics, and compressed the master
2016-09-11 19:58:36	Bongofury	oh I also highpassed the overhead stereo pair
2016-09-11 19:58:37	Audio_Bliss	How did you know to invert?
2016-09-11 19:58:41	Bongofury	cuz they were boomin it

2016-09-11 20:00:48	Bongofury	good omens
2016-09-11 20:00:50	Bongofury	ah nice
2016-09-11 20:01:07	Bongofury	glad you appreciate :)
2016-09-11 20:01:08	Audio_Bliss	I’m going to bookmark the images and try this set up
2016-09-11 20:01:32	Audio_Bliss	don’t haev all the mics yet though
2016-09-11 20:01:34	Bongofury	whats funny is that ABB runs a studio.  Earlier today he talked about having like 18 drum channels
2016-09-11 20:01:39	Bongofury	I was rolling my eyes
2016-09-11 20:01:52	Bongofury	but apparently, having a shitload of mics helps compensate for the weaknesses in each one
2016-09-11 20:02:13	Bongofury	_Hex_ thanks for fattening me uo
2016-09-11 20:02:14	Audio_Bliss	does it get fairly hallow if you drop out the ambient mics?
2016-09-11 20:02:23	Bongofury	yes
2016-09-11 20:02:33	Bongofury	then it would just be kick, 2 snares, and the floor tom
2016-09-11 20:02:37	Bongofury	those are the spot mics
2016-09-11 20:03:23	Bongofury	so now Im gonna use these tests to see which mics work best, where
2016-09-11 20:03:42	_Hex_	hmm..i dunno about 18 mics on a kit
2016-09-11 20:03:46	Bongofury	I might end up hanging one of the exotics behind me above my head
2016-09-11 20:03:48	_Hex_	that seems a bit nutty
2016-09-11 20:03:53	Bongofury	_Hex_ that was my point :)
2016-09-11 20:03:56	_Hex_	you start to run into phase issues
2016-09-11 20:04:05	_Hex_	and after a point it's diminishing returns
2016-09-11 20:04:06	Bongofury	Oh Audio_Bliss I have a 16 ch mixer and 8 analog channels in use
2016-09-11 20:04:15	Bongofury	into the DAW, 8 mono tracks
2016-09-11 20:04:20	_Hex_	i love a pair of mics which pick up stuff off the floor

2016-09-11 20:20:33	_Hex_	single guitar
2016-09-11 20:20:42	_Hex_	just run through 2 different signal chains
2016-09-11 20:20:56	bongofury	nah theres two takes
2016-09-11 20:21:01	_Hex_	which they just manually rode throughout the song
2016-09-11 20:21:04	bongofury	do you mean at the bridge or what
2016-09-11 20:21:08	_Hex_	no..i mean overall
2016-09-11 20:21:28	_Hex_	i think there's only a second guitar in the final outro
2016-09-11 20:21:40	_Hex_	the rest is just the same tkae but through 2 completely different chains
2016-09-11 20:21:46	_Hex_	so it sounds like multiple takes
2016-09-11 20:21:49	_Hex_	and parts
2016-09-11 20:22:01	bongofury	nah man
2016-09-11 20:22:06	bongofury	there are different notes being played
2016-09-11 20:22:17	bongofury	unless there are 2 bass guitar takes and 1 guitar take
2016-09-11 20:22:18	_Hex_	i'm going on what was in the session..i agree it sounds like that
2016-09-11 20:22:25	_Hex_	but he perfected his "double header" technique
2016-09-11 20:22:37	_Hex_	i called bullshit
2016-09-11 20:22:41	_Hex_	until i went through the session
2016-09-11 20:22:51	bongofury	there's a neep, neep, neep, neep single note pulse towards the first 30% of the song
2016-09-11 20:23:02	bongofury	yeah like the outtro
2016-09-11 20:23:06	_Hex_	i'm talking about the bulk of it all
2016-09-11 20:23:10	bongofury	thats in the start, when they both come in
2016-09-11 20:23:12	_Hex_	sounds like multitracked out the ass

2016-09-12 08:38:27	raz	my banks are just a file on my harddrive.. load them all and give me a fucking normal computer UI with..you know..search as you type.. a next button.. shit like that
2016-09-12 08:38:29	jnav	I mean, they exist due to technical constraints in old synths
2016-09-12 08:38:38	raz	don't make me "load" a new "bank" through an awkward file dialog
2016-09-12 08:39:40	raz	a proper synth could even have a button "give me next preset similar to this" .. or "like this with moar bass"..

2016-09-12 08:41:15	raz	yea..futzing with hardware dials is actually fun
2016-09-12 08:41:44	raz	it just gets horrible when you have to start pushing buttons.. "hold this for 3 seconds until it blinks, then select with these obscure buttons.."

2016-09-12 11:24:58	jnav	a lot of disco was (technically) house -- the term "house" refers to a club called "the warehouse" and "house music" is stuff that was played there
2016-09-12 11:25:13	jnav	typically pretty bare drum machine and synth stuff, but disco-inspired

2016-09-12 13:23:57	_Hex_	satin..saturn
2016-09-12 13:24:02	_Hex_	fix your product names
2016-09-12 13:24:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	fuck with the service panel and make sure vintage is on
2016-09-12 13:24:39	_Hex_	yeah..turned vintage on
2016-09-12 13:24:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	satin doesn't get as dirty as j37 though... it also doesn't alias like j37 does.
2016-09-12 13:24:40	DashZanger	DylanT_, change your workflow
2016-09-12 13:24:44	_Hex_	so far..it's too "nice"
2016-09-12 13:24:47	DashZanger	if you got a guitar or anything like that, record it
2016-09-12 13:24:59	_Hex_	i want to drive it harder and harder
2016-09-12 13:25:00	DashZanger	if you have new vsts or effects, dive in them
2016-09-12 13:25:01	_Hex_	and get things to break
2016-09-12 13:25:05	_Hex_	but it doesn't seem to want to
2016-09-12 13:25:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	you have the encoders off too right?
2016-09-12 13:25:40	DylanT_	I def think im more of an analog/knob twisting producer lol instead of automating stuff in software
2016-09-12 13:25:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	most of them tend to make things a bit too fancy sounding
2016-09-12 13:26:20	_Hex_	encoders?
2016-09-12 13:26:41	DylanT_	But yeah perhaps recording shit on the fly without being so 'structured' and formulaic in my the DAW is better for me
2016-09-12 13:26:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	dolby shit
2016-09-12 13:26:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	on the right hand side
2016-09-12 13:26:53	DylanT_	in the*
2016-09-12 13:27:00	_Hex_	oh yeah
2016-09-12 13:27:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	you can select which noise reduction shit you want, encode AND decode
2016-09-12 13:27:04	_Hex_	tried switching beteeen those
2016-09-12 13:27:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	which actually lets you do some fun stuff
2016-09-12 13:27:45	DashZanger	DylanT_, i would say the new rolands would be a welcome addition to you
2016-09-12 13:27:58	DylanT_	me too :)
2016-09-12 13:28:18	DashZanger	but do you want a drum machine or a synth?
2016-09-12 13:28:24	DashZanger	cuz theres a lot of options for both
2016-09-12 13:28:46	DylanT_	both for sure... except my education with chords and stuff is very minimal
2016-09-12 13:28:55	DylanT_	I basically need to be more patient in the creation process
2016-09-12 13:29:04	DashZanger	education with chords doesnt matter that much
2016-09-12 13:29:17	DashZanger	trial and error is fun
2016-09-12 13:29:30	DylanT_	I just dont know how to escalate a track when I write melodies
2016-09-12 13:29:39	DylanT_	Like a drop
2016-09-12 13:29:44	DylanT_	I suck at creating drops
2016-09-12 13:29:46	DylanT_	or breaks
2016-09-12 13:32:42	DashZanger	depends on what kind of drops / buildups do you want to make
2016-09-12 13:32:42		[13:32]
2016-09-12 13:33:36	DashZanger	generic ones are easiest, looking at beatport top 10 electro house tracks are basically all the same structure. dj friendly, every drop/start of main melody is at 1 minute mark etc
2016-09-12 13:34:16	DashZanger	aka automated highpass, some drum acceleration etc.
2016-09-12 13:34:29	DashZanger	but if you want to do the buildups melodically, its a different thing
2016-09-12 13:34:41	DashZanger	you cant really learn that, but you have to adapt to the song instead on that
2016-09-12 13:35:54	DashZanger	for example, a song which really has no buildup but instead goes to the drop melodically https://open.spotify.com/track/1sgyYCbGhkX3auLHCQ825G
2016-09-12 13:35:54	polyvox	^ Strobe, a song by deadmau5 on Spotify
2016-09-12 13:36:09	DashZanger	unless you count a 6:40 minute start as a buildup

2016-09-12 13:40:47	DashZanger	lots of automated parameters

2016-09-13 06:41:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	httpster: 'new' definitely sounds better just cause the kick is louder
2016-09-13 06:41:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	and the snare isn't as paperly
2016-09-13 06:41:46	AdmiralBumbleBee	you probably could get away with both if you fixed the low end on the 'old' loop
2016-09-13 06:41:49	@httpster	AdmiralBumbleBee: the snare is a bit shit tho, i'll need to layer it and add a tiny bit of reverb
2016-09-13 06:41:56	@httpster	AdmiralBumbleBee: yeah but i dont want to use loops :D

2016-09-13 06:57:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	I will say that I wasn't aware of these issues before disliking MH channel strip (or the delay). I just thought they sounded grainy.
2016-09-13 06:57:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	which was likely the aliasing issues with both.
2016-09-13 06:59:15	_Hex_	hmm

2016-09-13 06:59:52	_Hex_	i can get things in it which i don't seem to be able to do with anything else
2016-09-13 06:59:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	the high-pass filter rumble though... that is just an inexcusable issue
2016-09-13 07:00:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	that has no place in a well-designed channel strip of any sort

2016-09-13 07:51:19	raz	the problem with the gearslutz threads is..  sombody makes a convincing argument with measurements and everything..
2016-09-13 07:51:35	raz	and 3 pages later someone else says the exact opposite in an equally convincing way
2016-09-13 07:51:58	_Hex_	no offence to GS people either..but you get people who say some veeeeeeeeery convincing things
2016-09-13 07:52:02	_Hex_	then you listen to their music
2016-09-13 07:52:05	_Hex_	and it all falls apart
2016-09-13 07:53:01	raz	lol
2016-09-13 07:53:07	raz	yea that too
2016-09-13 07:53:23	raz	and then downthread there's always that guy "but analog gear was crap and non-deterministic too"
2016-09-13 07:53:45	<--	subsignal (~subsignal@96.91.83.241) has quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
2016-09-13 07:53:46	_Hex_	i like to know the theory for sure
2016-09-13 07:53:47	_Hex_	but at some point
2016-09-13 07:53:50	_Hex_	throw it all out the window
2016-09-13 07:53:52	raz	like if i want perfect processing why would i use an emulation of some crappy electronics from the 70s in first place
2016-09-13 07:54:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	I don't think it's worth using as a 'hey, this thing sucks because...'
2016-09-13 07:54:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	but if you dislike something, it's good to see the potential reasons why
2016-09-13 07:54:35	_Hex_	take channelstrip
2016-09-13 07:54:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	like one of my favorite synths ever is a total technical disaster
2016-09-13 07:54:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	but I LOVE it for that
2016-09-13 07:54:43	_Hex_	i think it sounds great on shit
2016-09-13 07:54:54	raz	which channelstrip?
2016-09-13 07:54:59	_Hex_	metric halo channelstrip
2016-09-13 07:55:29	 *	raz checks it out
2016-09-13 07:56:14	raz	iLok.. my arse
2016-09-13 07:56:29	 *	raz still isn't convinced anything can sound so good to be worth messing with fucking dongles
2016-09-13 07:57:05	raz	also i can't seem to actually put any of these strip VSTs really on all channels, they just eat too much cpu
2016-09-13 07:57:23	raz	but i may have just tried the wrong ones (every ssl emulation under the sun)
2016-09-13 07:57:38	_Hex_	have you tried putting the turbo button in on your 386?
2016-09-13 07:57:46	raz	dude i have a mac
2016-09-13 07:57:55	_Hex_	how can it not run these channelstrips?
2016-09-13 07:57:56	raz	it runs on steve's love itself
2016-09-13 07:57:59	_Hex_	they use almost zero
2016-09-13 07:58:16	raz	it can run them, but it takes a toll above >25 channels
2016-09-13 07:58:18	AdmiralBumbleBee	I've not seen many channelstrips that eat cpu
2016-09-13 07:58:19	_Hex_	huh
2016-09-13 07:58:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	yeah, that sounds weird to met oo
2016-09-13 07:58:35	_Hex_	i don't even know how many i can run
2016-09-13 07:58:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	my computer ain't new, and I can run a shitload of various channel stripsf
2016-09-13 07:58:39	_Hex_	far more than i'd ever need
2016-09-13 07:58:40	raz	well, maybe it wasn't the strips alone
2016-09-13 07:58:43	_Hex_	500+ easily if i wanted
2016-09-13 07:58:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	like... I did a test recently and I had 800 waves NLS plugins in a single project
2016-09-13 07:59:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	console emulation technically, but still
2016-09-13 07:59:07	_Hex_	i'm taking an ear break
2016-09-13 07:59:09	_Hex_	let's try this
2016-09-13 07:59:21	_Hex_	metric halo?
2016-09-13 07:59:23	_Hex_	or waves ssl
2016-09-13 07:59:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	who is that question to, and what is the question?
2016-09-13 07:59:58	raz	i like the sound of the waves strip
2016-09-13 08:00:11	raz	dunno what it does, i just tend to slap it on and it sounds better
2016-09-13 08:00:43	_Hex_	okay..this is happening
2016-09-13 08:01:23	_Hex_	okay
2016-09-13 08:01:30	_Hex_	i am at about 95% resources now
2016-09-13 08:02:53	_Hex_	https://snag.gy/348FxX.jpg
2016-09-13 08:03:07	_Hex_	all up..i instantiated 896 of them
2016-09-13 08:03:14	_Hex_	so..yeah..that's a few more than 25
2016-09-13 08:03:29	_Hex_	let's try the same shit with waves ssl
2016-09-13 08:03:29		[08:03]
2016-09-13 08:03:39	_Hex_	all stereo instances btw
2016-09-13 08:05:45	bongofury	_Hex_ lol what are you doing
2016-09-13 08:05:52	bongofury	just adding empty trax?
2016-09-13 08:06:46	_Hex_	waves is about the same..
2016-09-13 08:06:55	_Hex_	1008 waves ssl
2016-09-13 08:06:57	_Hex_	stereo
2016-09-13 08:07:02	_Hex_	before system says "that's enough bro"
2016-09-13 08:07:15	bongofury	heh
2016-09-13 08:07:17	bongofury	weird
2016-09-13 08:07:26	bongofury	what does that mean tho?
2016-09-13 08:07:46	_Hex_	oh nothing..raz was just saying they used too much cpu
2016-09-13 08:07:48	bongofury	are empty channels the same tax on the system that channels with clips?
2016-09-13 08:07:50	bongofury	do?
2016-09-13 08:07:51	_Hex_	which i disagree with
2016-09-13 08:07:56	_Hex_	yes..they are on my system
2016-09-13 08:07:59	bongofury	k
2016-09-13 08:08:00	_Hex_	as i'm not using the vst3 processing mode
2016-09-13 08:08:05	bongofury	sure, everything is contextual
2016-09-13 08:08:33	raz	might also depend on which processing is enabled in those instances
2016-09-13 08:08:43	raz	could imagine when fx's are bypassed, they are bypassed
2016-09-13 08:08:45	_Hex_	my default setting on them has all modules enabled
2016-09-13 08:08:57	raz	well dunno ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2016-09-13 08:08:59	_Hex_	but..my point is
2016-09-13 08:09:04	_Hex_	those channelstrip plugs are insanely light on cpu
2016-09-13 08:09:09	_Hex_	so if it's not on your system
2016-09-13 08:09:11	_Hex_	something isn't right
2016-09-13 08:09:29	raz	yea well, i haven't done a scientific test, may just have blamed the wrong thing
2016-09-13 08:10:05	bongofury	never used a channelstrip plugin
2016-09-13 08:10:13	bongofury	both my apps do that natively
2016-09-13 08:11:20	_Hex_	oh sure..nuendo has its own channelstrip
2016-09-13 08:11:26	_Hex_	i'm just used to certain plugs
2016-09-13 08:11:36	bongofury	cool
2016-09-13 08:11:37	_Hex_	and it's nice to be able to go between daws and be familiar with the same tools
2016-09-13 08:11:56	bongofury	Sonar has always had that channelstrip window, even Cakewalk since 8x
2016-09-13 08:12:05	bongofury	and Ableton has Session view
2016-09-13 08:12:13	bongofury	which is a grid of clips on channel strips
2016-09-13 08:16:34	raz	i wish ableton could somehow shrink the vst goes and show them side by side.. i think logic does that right?
2016-09-13 08:16:41	raz	switching between those plug windows is a pita
2016-09-13 08:17:08	raz	that's another reason why i don't really get into vst channel strips
2016-09-13 08:17:19	raz	popping in and out of those windows is a pain

2016-09-13 13:37:28	djdementia	obv the SM48 is better suited
2016-09-13 13:37:40	AdmiralBumbleBee	djdementia: the monoprice ldc is better usually.
2016-09-13 13:37:43	djdementia	i've seen people recommend harmonica mics because you can cup them without feedback
2016-09-13 13:37:45	DashZanger	never really recorded much but you need a mic which you can keep almost attached to your mouth
2016-09-13 13:37:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	just step back from the mic and use a low-shelf instead of relying on proximity effect.
2016-09-13 13:37:58	djdementia	yeah AdmiralBumbleBee cupping a large diaphram condensor?
2016-09-13 13:38:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	djdementia: you don't need to cup.
2016-09-13 13:38:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	djdementia: that's done to abuse the proximity effect on cardiod mics
2016-09-13 13:38:15	djdementia	welp i can expirement for sure
2016-09-13 13:38:28	AdmiralBumbleBee	djdementia: you can get the same result with an EQ and standing back from a clearer mic
2016-09-13 13:38:44	djdementia	ok cool
2016-09-13 13:38:51	djdementia	well i do have a mic shield and a pop filter
2016-09-13 13:38:55	DashZanger	basically you need a mix which can record sounds from your tongue, roof of your mouth, basically all parts of your face

2016-09-13 13:40:59	djdementia	what i'd love to do is get a bunch of music for beatboxing it'd be nice if it was a how to beatbox audiobook

2016-09-13 13:41:18	DashZanger	i think those exist
2016-09-13 13:41:43	DashZanger	but watching how the sound is made is essential tho
2016-09-13 13:42:15	DashZanger	it can be explained how to make a, say, a snare roll, but seeing it (tongue placement, breathing) helps a LOT
2016-09-13 13:42:54	raz	i can make a snare

2016-09-14 02:38:17	werbel	raz windows, Program Files, User Data, registry… Linux /usr/bin, /usr/lib, /usr/share/, ~/.*… Mac is not that bad in that regard
2016-09-14 02:38:52	raz	you're comparing mac to garbage
2016-09-14 02:38:56	raz	never compare yourself to garbage
2016-09-14 02:39:21	werbel	I mean… is there anything better?
2016-09-14 02:39:25	raz	others being even worse is no excuse for fucking shit up
2016-09-14 02:39:28	werbel	In use I mean
2016-09-14 02:39:28	werbel	yeah
2016-09-14 02:40:01	raz	the original NeXT concept (one folder = one app) was sound. apple just didn't put priority into implementing it properly.
2016-09-14 02:40:10	raz	apple is traditionally bad with everything involving a filesystem
2016-09-14 02:41:41	Lapa	best apple invention ever?  "All Files" tab in finder.... WTF were they thinking making this
2016-09-14 02:42:01	werbel	I guess there would be enough edges cases anyway… Like Live app, Sample packs (which you want to store on another disk), projects (maybe dropbox?), plug-ins
2016-09-14 02:42:07	Lapa	*"All My Files"
2016-09-14 02:42:09	werbel	some things you need to share across apps etc.
2016-09-14 02:42:45	werbel	But I do agree that having Apps/Ableton Live/{App, Config, User Data}
2016-09-14 02:42:47	werbel	would be nice
2016-09-14 02:42:59	raz	the "finder" is a joke, has always been
2016-09-14 02:43:03	raz	a bad joke
2016-09-14 02:43:03		[02:43]
2016-09-14 02:43:07	werbel	At least {App, Config}
2016-09-14 02:43:10	raz	ever try using that little 'search' box
2016-09-14 02:43:17	raz	i have never seen it work. not once.
2016-09-14 02:43:40	werbel	yeah…
2016-09-14 02:43:41	legreffier	raz: to their discharge i never saw it working on other OSes either
2016-09-14 02:43:49	raz	finder will show you a file called 'foo.txt'. and you type 'foo' into that box. and finder will think for a very long time, minutes easily. and never show anything.
2016-09-14 02:43:52	raz	it's ridiculous
2016-09-14 02:43:53	werbel	I just put asd in the search box and my first result is _GOING-UP-Project.zip ;)
2016-09-14 02:44:19	fqtw	wrl: hey, do you know how to read audio from an audio output device on windows?
2016-09-14 02:44:24	fqtw	not input device
2016-09-14 02:44:30	werbel	which… doesnt have any of the letters in the name and the format is binary ^^
2016-09-14 02:44:33	raz	legreffier: well the crazy thing is..  that box would be immensely useful if it could at least filter down the current file listing..  it's ridiculously hard to search for files on OSX
2016-09-14 02:44:40	fqtw	using rtaudio or portaudio
2016-09-14 02:44:44	raz	that spotlight garbage is so broken, it's not funny at all
2016-09-14 02:44:44	fqtw	or a native api
2016-09-14 02:44:58	werbel	raz you can select current folder… but there's no "Match in filename only"
2016-09-14 02:45:10	raz	werbel: it doesn't work. IT DOES NOT WORK.
2016-09-14 02:45:19	raz	don't even remind me... that shit infuriates me every time i actually need to search for a file
2016-09-14 02:45:52	raz	find / -iname "*foo.txt*" .. that's how i search for foo.txt, from the shell, in 2016
2016-09-14 02:45:59	werbel	raz… alfred man
2016-09-14 02:46:05	raz	because none of the OSX crap works for finding a file by filename
2016-09-14 02:46:23	raz	werbel: i've tried using that, but the search facilities in there are almost as bad as the native OSX stuff
2016-09-14 02:46:32	raz	probably because it also builds on spotlight indexing
2016-09-14 02:46:50	legreffier	if you're to use your computer with serious disk i/o , you should disable such features
2016-09-14 02:47:12	legreffier	serious disk i/o , as in ... making music, recordings, ...
2016-09-14 02:47:21	raz	you can't really disable spotlight in OSX anymore, tons of stuff breaks then (including alfred)
2016-09-14 02:47:47	raz	but at least the indexer has gotten relatively lightweight... i don't see it chomping up i/o or cpu anymore
2016-09-14 02:48:02	raz	maybe they just disabled the expensive parts when they realized it was useless anyway
2016-09-14 02:48:16	legreffier	raz: i don't see anybody using these.
2016-09-14 02:48:34	raz	using what, alfred?
2016-09-14 02:48:46	raz	i don't know anyone *not* using alfred
2016-09-14 02:49:09	werbel	raz Yeah, maybe there's a workflow using locate
2016-09-14 02:49:26	raz	locate doesn't work on stock osx, the index is not built
2016-09-14 02:49:32	raz	and you don't really want *that* index built anyway
2016-09-14 02:49:41	raz	that's a very expensive one
2016-09-14 02:50:01	raz	because most locate don't properly do incremental updates (except mlocate, but i don't think osx ships that)
2016-09-14 02:50:21	raz	<- knows more about this shit than he likes
2016-09-14 02:51:10	legreffier	https://www.alfredapp.com/ < alfred ?
2016-09-14 02:51:12	polyvox_	^ Alfred - Productivity App for Mac OS X
2016-09-14 02:51:23	raz	<- builds big storage systems.. search by filename on our petabyte glusterfs returns subsecond...  meanwhile finding 'fuckingtaxes.txt' on my mac is an endeavour of half an hour
2016-09-14 02:51:32	raz	legreffier: yes
2016-09-14 02:52:18	raz	legreffier: that and keyboard maestro are probably the two most critical apps to make osx usable
2016-09-14 02:52:43	raz	ok.. usable is an euphemism...  let's say bearable...
2016-09-14 02:53:05	legreffier	i never used alfred
2016-09-14 02:53:09	legreffier	:/
2016-09-14 02:53:15	werbel	I don't use keyboard maestro but applied couple of tips from here: http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/
2016-09-14 02:53:16	polyvox_	^ A Modern Space Cadet / Steve Losh
2016-09-14 02:53:31	werbel	hyper key, control/escape, shift parentheses
2016-09-14 02:53:33	legreffier	but keyboard maestro looks interesting
2016-09-14 02:53:50	legreffier	will it uncrap the alt-tab behavior ?
2016-09-14 02:54:01	legreffier	i'd like it alawindows
2016-09-14 02:54:34	legreffier	and , since you seem knowledgeable about os x , : is there any 'good' sample browser ?
2016-09-14 02:54:34	werbel	I miss Snow Leopard
2016-09-14 02:54:45	raz	it will do that and a lot more. when i hit ⌘⌥N then keyboard maestro: launches ableton, opens the save dialog and automatically saves the new set under a timestamped name
2016-09-14 02:54:57	legreffier	cause the finder qt preview is lame
2016-09-14 02:55:12	legreffier	and ableton's browser won't alway cut it
2016-09-14 02:56:52	raz	here's how that macro looks like http://i.imgur.com/hw6SN0H.png
2016-09-14 02:57:00	raz	once you start automating shit like that, you can't stop
2016-09-14 02:57:31	raz	that shit is magic, cause it can actually read your screen, i.e. you can make it wait until some dialog has actually popped up etc.
2016-09-14 02:58:05	raz	i also have a macro that basically does my taxes
2016-09-14 02:58:05		[02:58]
2016-09-14 02:58:10	raz	but i won't show you that :P
2016-09-14 02:59:00	werbel	That's ok ;) I'll give it a go… it's just… I don't find that many patterns in my computer usage.
2016-09-14 03:00:48	werbel	I do have smaller things like global shortcuts for Chrome profiles etc
2016-09-14 03:02:28	raz	well yea it took me a while to find those patterns..  only have a handful, but they couldn't live without them anymore

2016-09-14 08:37:11	Saint_Isidore	If I have 4 midi tracks, can I add a kontakt instrument to 1 of them and have that one kontakt instance play all 4 midi tracks
2016-09-14 08:41:52	subsignal	yea
2016-09-14 08:41:56	subsignal	u can use one contact instance
2016-09-14 08:42:22	Saint_Isidore	I take it it need to be a mutli version of kontakt ?
2016-09-14 08:42:28	subsignal	nope
2016-09-14 08:42:38	subsignal	u need to send the midi over different channels
2016-09-14 08:43:00	subsignal	and inside of kontakt u can select which midi channel triggers the loaded instrument
2016-09-14 08:43:07	Saint_Isidore	ok so on the actually midi tracks...right now they are all set to channel 1
2016-09-14 08:43:19	Saint_Isidore	do I leave that?
2016-09-14 08:43:29	subsignal	u will wat to sed each one out a sepreate channel
2016-09-14 08:43:33	Saint_Isidore	or do I need to change the individual tack channels?
2016-09-14 08:43:38	subsignal	wow my fucking keyboard stickin
2016-09-14 08:44:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	subsignal: use a tissue or a sock or something next time
2016-09-14 08:44:25	Saint_Isidore	hehehehe
2016-09-14 08:44:42	subsignal	midi1 channel 1, midi 2 channel 2.... then in kontakt assign each instrument to the corresponding midi chennel
2016-09-14 08:44:52	subsignal	ahhaa i had a feeling oe of u fucks would say somethig
2016-09-14 08:45:17	Saint_Isidore	routing now
2016-09-14 08:45:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: wha tyou want to do... don't do it in logic.
2016-09-14 08:45:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	use 4 kontakt instances
2016-09-14 08:46:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	logic is limited 1 ONE CORE per track. and ONE DISK THREAD per track.
2016-09-14 08:46:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	you are bottlenecking yourself hard by piling stuff in to one kontakt instance in logic
2016-09-14 08:46:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's stupid, but that's how it is right now.
2016-09-14 08:46:34	Saint_Isidore	ooh I thought that was the advanced way of doing it
2016-09-14 08:46:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: it is in Cubase or DP or Sonar or... whatever.
2016-09-14 08:46:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	logic though, not wise.
2016-09-14 08:46:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	one core, one disk thread, one track.
2016-09-14 08:47:02	Saint_Isidore	ok gotcha
2016-09-14 08:47:05	Saint_Isidore	thank you!
2016-09-14 08:47:14	Saint_Isidore	saved me so much time
2016-09-14 08:47:32	Saint_Isidore	ok so there is no problem doing 1 kontakt instance per track, correct?
2016-09-14 08:47:37	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: correct
2016-09-14 08:47:59	AdmiralBumbleBee	you can google 'logic one core per track' or something if you want
2016-09-14 08:48:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	there's plenty of threads on gs and vi-control about that shit
2016-09-14 08:48:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: remember though that even if you multi-out... you're still bound by the one core of the single instance
2016-09-14 08:48:36	Saint_Isidore	ok I will, but for now I'll take your word on it...you haven't ever been wrong about anything  else :)
2016-09-14 08:49:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	so ideally... for now, until they fix it, use multiple kontakt instances where you can in Logic
2016-09-14 08:49:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	I've been told by a beta tester that it's high on their priority list to fix, but it's very complex
2016-09-14 08:49:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	and that he wouldn't tell me anymore than that :|
2016-09-14 08:49:48	Saint_Isidore	So whats the point of multi timbral routing? just to control a multi timbral instrument by individual output within kontakt?
2016-09-14 08:50:43	Kimryd	Aphex gonna be in Houston
2016-09-14 08:50:43		[08:50]
2016-09-14 08:50:52	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: yeah
2016-09-14 08:51:00	Saint_Isidore	I was thinking having 1 kontakt player running all your midi tracks would be good way to reduce cpu load
2016-09-14 08:51:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: like imagine a drum kit or a string section sample library
2016-09-14 08:51:20	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: you want to control each individual instrument (or mic), but it all comes from one kontakt instance
2016-09-14 08:51:57	subsignal	yea i agree with abb i never really do what ur trying
2016-09-14 08:51:59	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: using fewer kontakt instances is definitely how a lot of people do it in other DAWs. DP handles this _extremely well_, Cubase also has some cool features for this
2016-09-14 08:52:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: like I said though, Logic is stuck with some legacy code that means you need to work differently for optimal efficiency of your project
2016-09-14 08:52:53	Saint_Isidore	So if I have a track, lets say called Bass, I can load a single kontakt instrument or multi kontakt instruments int he kontakt player but really it will just be stacking instrument sound correct?
2016-09-14 08:52:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	if/when they fix the per-track processing limitations, then using fewer instances of kontakt will likely be more efficent

2016-09-14 08:53:21	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: yes, unless you multi-out
2016-09-14 08:53:30	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: in which case, those multiple sounds can go to different tracks.
2016-09-14 08:53:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	but still 1 core limitation as it's coming from 1 track
2016-09-14 08:53:56	Saint_Isidore	Awe OK, it just clicked
2016-09-14 08:53:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	however! all the multi-out tracks can be thread scheduled correctly, since they are their own track
2016-09-14 08:54:10	AdmiralBumbleBee	so the effects on THOSE tracks will work efficiently in context
2016-09-14 08:54:45	Saint_Isidore	a little complicated way of thinking but I think I get it

2016-09-14 08:55:21	Saint_Isidore	but if I load a mutli track midi and want to load the correct sounds...1 kontakt instance per trackis my only option
2016-09-14 08:55:43	subsignal	no
2016-09-14 08:55:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's not your only option
2016-09-14 08:55:52	AdmiralBumbleBee	you can route multiple tracks to a single kontakt instance
2016-09-14 08:55:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's just not ideal in Logic.
2016-09-14 08:56:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	many tracks can feed one kontakt
2016-09-14 08:56:18	Saint_Isidore	ok I mean practically speaking
2016-09-14 08:56:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	and one kontakt can feed many tracks
2016-09-14 08:56:28	AdmiralBumbleBee	or you can have 1 kontakt per track
2016-09-14 08:56:40	AdmiralBumbleBee	or any combination
2016-09-14 08:57:44	Saint_Isidore	I think I understand...but if I have a bass, piano and drum track. I can see why I would rout them all to 1 kontakt instance. woudln't they all be playing the same sounds
2016-09-14 08:57:51	Saint_Isidore	from the 1 kontakt instance
2016-09-14 08:58:49	subsignal	if ur keyboard only has the ability to trigger one channel then kinda yea
2016-09-14 08:59:03	Saint_Isidore	ok I'm just trying to wrap my head around it
2016-09-14 08:59:34	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: kontakt can have sounds assigned to different midi channels
2016-09-14 08:59:52	AdmiralBumbleBee	a single midi port has 16 channels of data that can be used, all of them independent (except for some weird after-market protocols)
2016-09-14 09:00:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	so one track sends to kontakt on channel 1, and kontakt only triggers bass sounds for channel one
2016-09-14 09:00:18	AdmiralBumbleBee	channel 2 comes from your keys track, and kontakt only uses channel 2 for keys
2016-09-14 09:00:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	etc..
2016-09-14 09:00:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	but all on the same midi port, up to 16 channels
2016-09-14 09:00:51	Saint_Isidore	ok right now I have just that set up...and not gettign sound from channel 2 instrument
2016-09-14 09:01:22	AdmiralBumbleBee	is the midi track outputting on channel 1?

2016-09-14 15:20:01	Saint_Isidore	I'm confused over kontakt. Midi routing to 1 single kontakt instrument or using mutltimbral mode

2016-09-14 15:44:56	_Hex_	what's confusing
2016-09-14 15:45:17	_Hex_	your midi track has the capability of transmitting data on 16 midi channels
2016-09-14 15:45:29	_Hex_	kontakt has the ability to receive those 16 channels
2016-09-14 15:45:52	Saint_Isidore	ok so I get I can create a simple (none multi timbral) kontakt instrument and then ma ke more channeld from the mixer +channel
2016-09-14 15:45:55	_Hex_	so (basic theory) you can load 16 different instruments and play 16 different parts from a single midi track
2016-09-14 15:46:18	Saint_Isidore	how is that different than making a multi timbral instr.
2016-09-14 15:46:43	_Hex_	tell me what you're trying to do
2016-09-14 15:46:47	_Hex_	not how you're trying to do it
2016-09-14 15:47:36	Saint_Isidore	I want to setup a single kontakt instrument with 8 instr. that are controlled by individual tracks
2016-09-14 15:47:58	Saint_Isidore	since the music I' working on now main requires the same 8 instruments
2016-09-14 15:48:08	_Hex_	well..then in that case
2016-09-14 15:48:10	_Hex_	load the single instrument
2016-09-14 15:48:15	_Hex_	i dunno what DAW you're on
2016-09-14 15:48:22	_Hex_	but the theory is you use a single midi track
2016-09-14 15:48:28	_Hex_	which is outputting to "all" midi channels
2016-09-14 15:48:31	Saint_Isidore	LPX
2016-09-14 15:48:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	_Hex_: he's in logic, which will restrict that instance of kontakt to a single core and a single disk thread.
2016-09-14 15:48:39	AdmiralBumbleBee	I've already recommended against this.
2016-09-14 15:48:45	_Hex_	then you target the instruments in kontakt to respond to a particular channel

2016-09-14 15:54:50	Saint_Isidore	Got it! working perfectly now
2016-09-14 15:55:50	Saint_Isidore	AdmiralBumbleBee can you tell me again why don't recommend this? I got 4 tracks all sending to 1 multi(16) kontakt instrument and all player to their individual instruments in the 1 kontakt instr.
2016-09-14 16:01:00		[15:55]
2016-09-14 16:13:21	AdmiralBumbleBee	Saint_Isidore: logic limits you to ONE PROCESSOR per track
2016-09-14 16:13:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	a single thread for all actions happening on a track
2016-09-14 16:13:37	Saint_Isidore	so it will work....but not be efficient?
2016-09-14 16:13:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	yes
2016-09-14 16:14:13	Saint_Isidore	awe ok, I thought it wouldn't work...my misunderstanding

2016-09-14 17:49:47	bongofury	_Hex_ you around
2016-09-14 17:49:59	bongofury	wondering what the typical octave range is for a lead-instrument
2016-09-14 17:50:02	bongofury	im thinking 3
2016-09-14 17:50:21	AdmiralBumbleBee	bongofury: 3 is a pretty big range
2016-09-14 17:50:30	bongofury	yeah
2016-09-14 17:50:35	AdmiralBumbleBee	for a lead _instrument_ yeah
2016-09-14 17:50:39	bongofury	the main octave where the typical hook occurs
2016-09-14 17:50:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	for a lead part... usually about 1.5 octaves
2016-09-14 17:50:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	or less
2016-09-14 17:50:50	bongofury	the uppoer register for solos, lower for accents
2016-09-14 17:50:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	for pop music, less usually
2016-09-14 17:51:11	 *	bongofury puts on Buckethead
2016-09-14 17:51:13	bongofury	:)
2016-09-14 17:51:28	bongofury	i'll give it 3
2016-09-14 17:51:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	yeah, totally genre dependent really
2016-09-14 17:51:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	but your average guitar only has about 3.5 octaves
2016-09-14 17:51:40	_Hex_	bongofury: yeah..i'm around..sort of
2016-09-14 17:51:40	AdmiralBumbleBee	that get used
2016-09-14 17:51:42	bongofury	i ask because im making defaults
2016-09-14 17:51:43	AdmiralBumbleBee	at most
2016-09-14 17:51:50	bongofury	in an translator
2016-09-14 17:51:53	_Hex_	3 tones maybe ;)
2016-09-14 17:51:57	bongofury	so 3 is good for me, for a typical instrument
2016-09-14 17:51:59	bongofury	hahahaha
2016-09-14 17:52:00	_Hex_	no chance for 3 octaves
2016-09-14 17:52:01	bongofury	ok
2016-09-14 17:52:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	_Hex_: well he asked about an instrument
2016-09-14 17:52:13	_Hex_	not even a full octave
2016-09-14 17:52:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	not a part
2016-09-14 17:52:26	AdmiralBumbleBee	be easier to answer if I knew wtf you were actually doing
2016-09-14 17:52:27	_Hex_	yeah..lead instruments usually = vocal
2016-09-14 17:52:34	bongofury	yall never heard a guitar player strum a chord :D
2016-09-14 17:52:44	AdmiralBumbleBee	see... saying things like that
2016-09-14 17:52:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	makes me think I have no clue what you are actually asking
2016-09-14 17:52:53	_Hex_	that's rhythm/pad/backing
2016-09-14 17:52:54	bongofury	im setting some boundaries in a control surface
2016-09-14 17:52:56	_Hex_	it's not a lead
2016-09-14 17:52:56	bongofury	AdmiralBumbleBee
2016-09-14 17:53:07	AdmiralBumbleBee	for what?
2016-09-14 17:53:12	bongofury	ok _Hex_ but a lead instrument can crank out a chord
2016-09-14 17:53:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	like a lead guitar part is way wider than a vocal part
2016-09-14 17:53:24	AdmiralBumbleBee	a piano part will usually be even wider still
2016-09-14 17:53:30	bongofury	yeah, and most of it happens on top 3 strings
2016-09-14 17:53:36	bongofury	for me. :)
2016-09-14 17:54:12	bongofury	youll see ill share it here when its lookable
2016-09-14 17:54:37	AdmiralBumbleBee	if you're setting it for a hand played instrument, 3 octaves
2016-09-14 17:54:37	bongofury	you didnt gimme any feedback on my drums ABB
2016-09-14 17:54:40	AdmiralBumbleBee	vocals, about 1
2016-09-14 17:54:47	bongofury	k, 3 it is
2016-09-14 17:54:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	if it's for just a lead part, 1 octave
2016-09-14 17:54:52	bongofury	works well
2016-09-14 17:54:58	AdmiralBumbleBee	and 1 octave even then is pretty genereous
2016-09-14 17:55:20	bongofury	Katy Perry exceeds 1 octave, for example.
2016-09-14 17:55:25	AdmiralBumbleBee	bongofury: I didn't see anything, and I'm not near any speakers right now
2016-09-14 17:55:30	bongofury	let's strive to excel beyond her
2016-09-14 17:55:34	bongofury	im building a range
2016-09-14 17:55:44	bongofury	okies
2016-09-14 17:55:55	bongofury	3 days ago you said you recorded 18 drum channels
2016-09-14 17:56:04	bongofury	so, I set up my kit and its mics
2016-09-14 17:56:10	bongofury	I wound up with 8 channels
2016-09-14 17:56:14	bongofury	and a really kickass sound
2016-09-14 17:56:18	bongofury	so thanks
2016-09-14 17:56:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	I see, cool
2016-09-14 17:56:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	like I said, high track counts for stuf flike that isn't even about sound
2016-09-14 17:56:54	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's largely about options
2016-09-14 17:57:37	bongofury	yeah well lemme tellya
2016-09-14 17:57:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	and not even static options
2016-09-14 17:57:43	bongofury	I had like 8 scrub mics
2016-09-14 17:57:46	bongofury	and all together?
2016-09-14 17:57:49	AdmiralBumbleBee	gates on shit, bypass etc..
2016-09-14 17:57:53	bongofury	they sound like 4 gold mics
2016-09-14 17:57:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	dynamic selection is a big part of it as well
2016-09-14 17:57:55	bongofury	no shit
2016-09-14 17:58:12	bongofury	yeah each mic in my setup has a diff profile
2016-09-14 17:58:14	bongofury	none are matched
2016-09-14 17:58:16	AdmiralBumbleBee	like I don't care about the floor tom res mic 99.8% of the ime

2016-09-14 18:03:12		[18:03]

2016-09-14 18:03:47	bongofury	two in front are CAD Equitek E100 and a M179, which has a selectable field
2016-09-14 18:03:53	AdmiralBumbleBee	do you have the polarity inverted on the cad snare side mic?
2016-09-14 18:03:59	bongofury	I hard panned them and it sounded like god
2016-09-14 18:04:13	bongofury	not anymore
2016-09-14 18:04:15	AdmiralBumbleBee	and how do you like the m179?
2016-09-14 18:04:19	bongofury	it's not millimeter matched

2016-09-14 18:04:40	AdmiralBumbleBee	mm
2016-09-14 18:04:42	bongofury	but its great for the field selectability

2016-09-15 06:07:00	AdmiralBumbleBee	the buttons were squishy and mistriggered
2016-09-15 06:07:03	AdmiralBumbleBee	the pad didn't track right
2016-09-15 06:07:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	you could only click on 1 portion of it with a tap

2016-09-15 06:07:36	AdmiralBumbleBee	and the fucking thing had 2 bios layers which allowed you to disable hardware, with some very strange logic of which one took precedence

2016-09-15 06:14:33	_Hex_	yeah..it's not bad
2016-09-15 06:14:38	AdmiralBumbleBee	the process it uses is very similar to something aleksey vaneev was doing a while back an abandoned
2016-09-15 06:14:57	AdmiralBumbleBee	there was a soniformer beta with automatic shaping for different types of sounds
2016-09-15 06:15:04	AdmiralBumbleBee	and he tossed it thinking it was 'stupid'
2016-09-15 06:15:13	AdmiralBumbleBee	I thought it was neat
2016-09-15 06:16:18	MSHMTX	i grabbed that too
2016-09-15 06:16:22	MSHMTX	what does it do exactly?
2016-09-15 06:16:42	_Hex_	basically it "intelligently" applies spectral shaping to your sound
2016-09-15 06:16:49	MSHMTX	like say if i had a bus of leads and pads and more upper register stuff it will help even everything out?
2016-09-15 06:16:53	_Hex_	to smooth things out
2016-09-15 06:17:05	MSHMTX	in what way?
2016-09-15 06:17:07	MSHMTX	isolation?
2016-09-15 06:17:10	MSHMTX	volume control?
2016-09-15 06:17:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	MSHMTX: splits shit up in to 32 bands, then dynamically adjust the amplitude of the bands based on their own criteria
2016-09-15 06:17:24	MSHMTX	word
2016-09-15 06:17:26	MSHMTX	ok
2016-09-15 06:17:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	if you have ozone, there's a mode that's similar with all the parameters exposed
2016-09-15 06:17:33	MSHMTX	that sounds pretty cool in theory
2016-09-15 06:17:40	AdmiralBumbleBee	or you can look at voxengo's soniformer

2016-09-15 07:13:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	pitch is the same, there's just a resonant filter
2016-09-15 07:14:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	httpster: does the sampler allow you to link parameters? maybe pan is also changing something else
2016-09-15 07:14:20	_Hex_	sounds like a touch of flanger/phaser or some shit on the second hit
2016-09-15 07:14:32	_Hex_	i'm listeing to it summed to mono
2016-09-15 07:14:33	@httpster	there's 3 individual samples. one with no pan, one with left and one with right
2016-09-15 07:14:49	@httpster	all identical else. no other settings altered. sent to 1 mixer channel that goes to master. no effects on the chain
2016-09-15 07:14:51	AdmiralBumbleBee	yeah, it could also just be a double trigger or something that's causing it
2016-09-15 07:15:46	@httpster	what do you mean with double trigger
2016-09-15 07:15:49	@httpster	they're not layered

2016-09-15 15:57:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	embri0n: IMO yeah, but I don't own bitwig
2016-09-15 15:57:47	AdmiralBumbleBee	I simply thought very highly of the demo.
2016-09-15 15:57:55	AdmiralBumbleBee	I do own live (suite) though
2016-09-15 15:58:09	AdmiralBumbleBee	and I can say that based on the demo, if I was doing live stuff again... I'd go bitwig 100%
2016-09-15 15:58:10	Kimryd	I use Bitwig mostly with externals and its grrrrrrrrrrreat

2016-09-15 16:00:07	Kimryd	Yeah, and you won't have a million max devices in your project
2016-09-15 16:00:26	Kimryd	Also, the effect/instrument nesting allows for some pretty neat stuff when it comes to bouncing
2016-09-15 16:00:40	Kimryd	Like, you can put fx on a delay's feedback
2016-09-15 16:00:45	Kimryd	And only the feedback
2016-09-15 16:01:44	Kimryd	There's also stuff like pitch bend per note, gain / pan / timbre automation per note, however that only works with native stuff
2016-09-15 16:02:19	Kimryd	You can use a synthesizers velocity / keytracking to modulate effects much later on in the chain
2016-09-15 16:02:20	Kimryd	etc
2016-09-15 16:03:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	embri0n: the most important thing about bitwig though

2016-09-15 17:03:20	Kimryd	Think of it as a super short stereo delay
2016-09-15 17:03:23	kerrang	though i wasn't exactly being smart on how i went about that
2016-09-15 17:04:22	kerrang	yeah i knew it was a set of crossfed delays
2016-09-15 17:04:24	kerrang	iirc
2016-09-15 17:05:32	kerrang	Kimryd: are audio recievers post or pre fader?
2016-09-15 17:05:45	Kimryd	You can set that
2016-09-15 17:05:46	kerrang	i haven't tried them, but if they're post then i'm gonna start using them a lot
2016-09-15 17:05:49	kerrang	yes
2016-09-15 17:06:01	Kimryd	By default the monitor whatever is to the left
2016-09-15 17:06:35	kerrang	oh i guess i meant audio transmitter(?) the complementing device
2016-09-15 17:06:59	kerrang	if those can be post-fader then i can potentiall use them to make a vca-like send

2016-09-15 17:07:56	AdmiralBumbleBee	someone was making fun of me for ironically not having used it much
2016-09-15 17:08:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	the GUI is pretty stupid honestly
2016-09-15 17:08:21	kerrang	dumb reason to make fun of someone, but i kinda just saw it as a massive-clone
2016-09-15 17:08:30	kerrang	gui looked silly, yeah
2016-09-15 17:08:31	AdmiralBumbleBee	and in fact, I'd not buy it because of that pretty much
2016-09-15 17:08:40	AdmiralBumbleBee	kerrang: admiralBUMBLEBEE hasn't used HIVE much?
2016-09-15 17:08:41	AdmiralBumbleBee	cmon
2016-09-15 17:08:45	AdmiralBumbleBee	pretty legit reason to make fun of me.
2016-09-15 17:08:53	kerrang	kek
2016-09-15 17:09:01	kerrang	ok, i didn't think of that
2016-09-15 17:09:11	AdmiralBumbleBee	I could only laugh
2016-09-15 17:09:16	kerrang	lets just start making bee-related plugins
2016-09-15 17:09:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	and acknowledge the legitimacy of it.
2016-09-15 17:09:29	AdmiralBumbleBee	but I'll say
2016-09-15 17:09:30	kerrang	and force you to use them
2016-09-15 17:09:33	AdmiralBumbleBee	I thought hive was kinda toyish
2016-09-15 17:09:42	AdmiralBumbleBee	but now I realize it's a pretty legit product
2016-09-15 17:12:43	kerrang	i'm finally gonna daw again tomorrow
2016-09-15 17:12:43		[17:12]
2016-09-15 17:13:02	kerrang	and probably get mad when i reach max cpu
2016-09-15 17:13:14	AdmiralBumbleBee	just turn the bits down
2016-09-15 17:13:36	kerrang	oh right, i was thinking of dawing at 92khz
2016-09-15 17:13:46	kerrang	but probably can't do that quite yet

2016-09-15 17:18:19	AdmiralBumbleBee	I have a stack of them in fact
2016-09-15 17:19:08	kerrang	i'm looking up external hdds right now, but ofc seagates come up first on the search (i'm not sure how reliable those are)
2016-09-15 17:19:27	AdmiralBumbleBee	I did a bunch of research before I went with the wd
2016-09-15 17:19:32	AdmiralBumbleBee	specifically for reliability
2016-09-15 17:19:39	kerrang	i know wd interal drives are good, externals i don't know
2016-09-15 17:19:50	AdmiralBumbleBee	it's just a normal drive in an enclosure
2016-09-15 17:19:52	AdmiralBumbleBee	nothing different
2016-09-15 17:19:58	kerrang	cool, then wd it is
2016-09-15 17:20:31	kerrang	thinkin i'm just gonna buy one in store this weekend and start moving samples and plugins into it
2016-09-15 17:20:52	kerrang	kinda sucks using an external that needs a separate power adapter

2016-10-01 17:07:26	matt_j	I was using ableton and suddenly my speakers just starting playing awful static at MAX volume, scared the SHIT out of me!
2016-10-01 17:07:37	matt_j	and it seemed to be from the Ableton Reverb
2016-10-01 17:07:42	matt_j	has anyone had this problem?

2016-10-01 17:09:27	raz	but their plugs tend to be rather stable for me

2016-10-02 07:41:22	bongofury	gotta put your mind into it

2016-10-02 07:44:23	AdmiralBumbleBee	bongofury: I'd beg to differ on that one... there's lots of guys around here that specialize in that.
2016-10-02 07:44:43	bongofury	sure
2016-10-02 07:44:44	Saint_Isidore	I was fortunate that my father was a ridiculous Jazz drummer.. so kinda rubbed off on me I suppose
2016-10-02 07:44:45	bongofury	but i mean
2016-10-02 07:44:52	bongofury	none of the other styles are "hard" intrinsically
2016-10-02 07:45:06	bongofury	jazz is to music like "french" is to white people languages
2016-10-02 07:45:15	bongofury	tons of extra basic vocabulary
2016-10-02 07:45:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	I find latin and african styles to be much more difficult than most jazz eras
2016-10-02 07:45:21	Saint_Isidore	Every style is difficult.... to play really well
2016-10-02 07:45:35	Saint_Isidore	Hehe  I play in a salsa band now  :)
2016-10-02 07:45:51	bongofury	ABB maybe its just my brain... polyrhythms are way easier than jazz acrobatics
2016-10-02 07:46:12	bongofury	plus, the african and latin have multi-piece percussion groups

2016-10-02 07:47:09	AdmiralBumbleBee	likewise I know plenty of excellent latin-jazz specialists that couldn't play a straight rock beat to save their first born child
2016-10-02 07:47:17	bongofury	that surprises me
2016-10-02 07:47:19	bongofury	it really does
2016-10-02 07:47:39	bongofury	I think we can agree that from a pure data analysis standpoint, rock is far simpler
2016-10-02 07:47:43	Saint_Isidore	It's also if you your talking about being a jazz purist (whatever that means).
2016-10-02 07:47:53	bongofury	nah just jazz execution

2016-10-02 09:33:44	alfie	i'm pretty sure there's something which makes it easy to develop AU and AAX at the same time
2016-10-02 09:34:07	kerrang	yeah, and they'd make it possible to export to vst and other formats as well
2016-10-02 09:34:12	AdmiralBumbleBee	alfie: yes, and they all make compiling VST exceptioally easy as well
2016-10-02 09:34:26	alfie	maybe it's because OS X is less of a ballache to support

2016-10-03 03:16:59	Nahck	i dont like the muddiness and lack of transparency on the 57. any clearer options
2016-10-03 03:17:16	Nahck	of course it depends
2016-10-03 03:17:17	AdmiralBumbleBee	if the 57 sounds muddy, first back it off
2016-10-03 03:17:21	AdmiralBumbleBee	get rid of the proximity issue

2016-10-03 03:26:37	Nahck	yeah ive done my homework googling what the finnish studio/concert hall guys use
2016-10-03 03:27:24	TheCometCE	when I move out of this apartment I'm going to set something up in the basement
2016-10-03 03:27:45	Nahck	i got to packs already in the summer but found out it's a bit too soft and better for basstraps than panels
2016-10-03 03:29:00	Nahck	which is kinda good. wouldve sucked to make all the panels in a hurry and find that stuff out after that
2016-10-03 03:34:00		[03:29]
2016-10-03 03:46:20	TheCometCE	just realize I've spent half of my time on this album making DnB, something I haven't really listened to a whole lot of since the mid 2000's
2016-10-03 03:47:02	TheCometCE	hopefully I'm not too hard on the amen break+reese combo <_<
2016-10-03 03:49:14	httpster	finally done with this tune
2016-10-03 03:49:14		[03:49]
2016-10-03 03:49:16	httpster	could be better
2016-10-03 03:49:27	httpster	maybe some other day. decided to put it out now nonetheless

2016-10-03 03:50:39	TheCometCE	love that synth organ
2016-10-03 03:50:59	httpster	i think the sm58 and 57 are a bit biased. theyre warm but they dont lack clarity though. but with condenser mics you usually get a lot more air and a cleaner sound
2016-10-03 03:51:12	httpster	ofc they wont work for guitar amps etc
2016-10-03 03:51:22	httpster	Nahck: are you gonna use the 57 for vocals or instruments?

2016-10-03 03:52:47	TheCometCE	httpster: Enjoyed that track, that key was pretty unorthodox but it works in a funky kind of way
2016-10-03 03:52:51	Nahck	friend moved so had to vring that amp to my flat
2016-10-03 03:53:05	httpster	TheCometCE: thank you :)
2016-10-03 03:53:19	httpster	TheCometCE: yeah its a bit weird tune but i've had fun making it
2016-10-03 03:53:20	TheCometCE	what key was that in? sounded almost like some oddball jazz key
2016-10-03 03:53:27	httpster	I think it's B flat
2016-10-03 03:53:37	httpster	B minor actually yeah
2016-10-03 03:53:46	TheCometCE	that's one funky b minor
2016-10-03 03:53:59	TheCometCE	but again, it worked :)
2016-10-03 03:54:00	Nahck	its nicer than i remembered so bought shitloads of fuzzes, od, compressors, pedal powers, mics and shit
2016-10-03 03:55:11	httpster	Nahck: but can you play :D?
2016-10-03 03:55:14	Nahck	i think fiddling with pedalboards is one of the most sexually satisfying things in life

2016-10-03 04:42:34	bd-	mixing could do with some work, although i'm using some reasonbly shitty earphones so maybe it's just these
2016-10-03 04:42:55	TheCometCE	no it probably does need it, I've shifted my whole mixing process around in the last 2 weeks
2016-10-03 04:43:23	bd-	1:31 the drop in volume on the lead synth is odd
2016-10-03 04:43:34	TheCometCE	my mixing habits are directly tied to the radio/tv broadcasting degree on my wall, I have a lot of habits that work great for broadcasting VO that are horrible for music
