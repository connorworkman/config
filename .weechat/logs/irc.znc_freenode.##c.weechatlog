2016-10-17 14:52:53	Akahige	No problem :P Most issues like this can be solved by carefully going through the loop by hand and seeing where you go off the end... However, I advise you check all your mallocs anyway.
2016-10-17 14:53:25	Naan	yeah I know I should
2016-10-17 14:53:58	Naan	the problem with doing lots of these exercises for classes is you start taking shortcuts just to keep up with your workload and stuff
