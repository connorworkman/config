2016-10-17 15:29:09	kate	Grr_: the average part looks okay to me. don't forget to handle the situation where malloc returns NULL. i do not see why this function would need to call malloc
2016-10-17 15:29:09		[15:29]
2016-10-17 15:29:37	chrisf	the malloc looks pointless, the list `a` passed in isnt used at all; and you dont initialize runNode
2016-10-17 15:30:30	kate	it's like an abstract painting of C
2016-10-17 15:30:40	chrisf	nothing wrong with the averaging (up to overflows) if you fix all the breakage around it
2016-10-17 15:30:52	kate	maybe impressionist. it has the colour of C

2016-10-17 15:35:34	Towel	hey everyone. Anyone familiar with the "linus" method of removing an element from a singly linked-list where you use a double pointer and then just &(*head)->next to iterate?
2016-10-17 15:35:35	stvn	same
2016-10-17 15:35:57	Towel	I understand it, but don't know how to keep that same methodology and apply it for dynamically allocated elements

2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:43:49] Boobuigi: No. If you mismatch you will get undefined behavior. [08:43:49]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	Boobuigi	[08:44:17] dminuoso_: Undefined... Well, that explains the madness.  Thank you. [08:44:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:44:37] (This is just based on my feeling, since anything else just wouldn't make much sense) [08:44:37]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:44:44] Would have to look up the standard to be sure. [08:44:44]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	Boobuigi	[08:45:37] I agree.  What I'm seeing, though, is that removing type casts results in other, non-typecasted arguments ending up in different positions. [08:45:37]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	Boobuigi	[08:46:28] I expected printf to try and interpret the bits according to the format specifier regardless, but it definitely does not. [08:46:28]

2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:47:34] Boobuigi: There seems to be a complex rules regarding conversions. [08:47:34]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pragma-	[08:47:46] `<nick>: !<command>` is a new additional as of about a week ago or so, if you don't want to type out the tell thing. [08:47:46]

2016-10-18 00:14:19	pragma-	[08:53:31] Mostly because I happened to notice a couple of people trying to invoke the bot at a person by using "person: !command" and of course it didn't work but I took notice and realized that there's no reason that shouldn't work. So, it works now! [08:53:31]

2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:54:02] Ah. [08:54:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pragma-	[08:54:41] Unfortunately that might mean twkm has to make yet another ignore regex. [08:54:41]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:55:03] pragma-: why is that? [08:55:03]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pragma-	[08:55:16] twkm has a weird anti-obsession with bots and https and such. [08:55:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:55:33] So they can just ignore candide altogether? [08:55:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pragma-	[08:55:48] and the bot triggers too [08:55:48]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	Boobuigi	[08:56:47] So what do I do when I want to see what the bits of a particular int would represent, if they were interpreted as a double? [08:56:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:57:05] Boobuigi: Use a union [08:57:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:57:14] Or memcpy [08:57:14]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:57:48] Any other method would be a illegal type punning and invoke the wrath of UB. [08:57:48]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	Boobuigi	[08:58:00] dminuoso_: Hehe, good ideas.  I'll give memcpy a shot. [08:58:00]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:58:20] Boobuigi: (Note a violation of this will usually always compile and even run - except the code will not behave as you expect it to) [08:58:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:59:34] Boobuigi: I think memcpy is the more stable choice, as a union can produce alignment issues. [08:59:34]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	Chris	[09:32:30] pragma-: why doesn't he like https? [09:32:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	CaZe	[09:34:16] Because freedom. [09:34:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	Chris	[09:37:33] OK [09:37:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pragma-	[09:52:12] Chris: why not ask him? [09:52:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pragma-	[09:52:40] he always manages to remain fairly gnomic in his responses thus far [09:52:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	Chris	[09:55:57] That's why I asked you instead. Thought you might have an idea. [09:55:57]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	Chris	[09:56:28] I can't recall him saying anything other than "ugh" in the last few years. [09:56:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pwn	[10:04:24] Anyone have any experience with unit testing frameworks for C? [10:04:24]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pwn	[10:04:43] I've googled and found some popular ones: Unity, Check, CUnit [10:04:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pwn	[10:05:15] Any suggestions on which one to go with? Or just make my own? [10:05:15]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pragma-	[10:05:20] great, now experiment with them and you'll have experience with them! [10:05:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pragma-	[10:06:22] you know why there are at least 3 frameworks?  because there are at least 3 different opinions.  why ask for dubious opinions when you can just form your own? [10:06:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	Chris	[10:06:49] You should definitely make your own. Chances are you'll have thought of and addressed all the things the developers of the other ones wouldn't have even considered. [10:06:49]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pwn	[10:07:24] Chris: True, but it is time consuming, not sure i want to invest time in it if something is already available [10:07:24]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pwn	[10:09:25] pragma-: why dubious opinions? i value peoples opinion here to a certain extent. enough that im willing to go with what they suggest more than randomly picking a choice. [10:09:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	u-ou	[10:11:04] my opinion on the matter is that ponies are cute [10:11:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pwn	[10:12:37] u-ou: I have work to do [10:12:37]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pwn	[10:12:51] (which is why im here trying to avoid doing it) [10:12:51]

2016-10-18 03:55:11	dminuoso_	fstd: The main issue is that that tab stops can have different depth on different levels (so the first tab stop could be 10 characters, the second could be a total of 13, etc)
2016-10-18 03:55:39	dminuoso_	If we had real tab stops, it could be sensibly used I suppose.

2016-10-18 06:06:51	dho	so a check for null around the free is unnecessary. with regards to bad practices, i'm not sure it's a bad practice to do it, but it's not necessary.

2016-10-18 07:07:02	smrtz	Thanks everyone, but, just since now I'm curious, what's it called when you include the source for something and use that?  If using stdin wasn't the right solution would I say to 'impliment cat as a static library'?

2016-10-18 07:49:21	odapppi	k&R is the same as k&R2, and no it doesnt teach us how to print primes,etc, and multiply matrices, and use structures from a array usage
2016-10-18 07:49:24	twkm	a book like h&s doesn't try to teach it, but it is a nice reference from which at times you will learn some things you previously didn't know.

2016-10-18 09:03:08	atk	we use an XML parser which breaks if you have two XML entities (the &amp; &quot; nonsense) next to eachother, of if the second character of an attribute or text inside an element is a XML character entity.
2016-10-18 09:03:36	atk	So I was asked to escape the characters before they get passed to the XML generator and then unescape them when they get read by the XML parser
2016-10-18 09:03:48	latch	mmm bandaids
2016-10-18 09:04:12	atk	And this was insane already, I'm dumbfounded by how this XML parser has never had this shit reported.
2016-10-18 09:04:18	atk	But what came next was more insane,
2016-10-18 09:04:23	hypnopothesis	can't you just and some new regex to the parser seems simple in perl
2016-10-18 09:04:54	atk	I received a suggestion that for example ' should be escaped to _apos_ and & to _amp_ and was told I should use search and replace for each one

2016-10-18 09:38:29	latch	well assume you create an archive for source distribution of your program. you dont want git because thats a needless dependency. you should, however, use some kind of flow to create that source archive in the first place. you can write out a version file in this case when you create the source archive, and have your makefile switch to using that instead of a git command
2016-10-18 09:38:38	atk	a1b1: no, use a text editor like vim, much better

2016-10-18 10:33:22	cousteau	I guess this means that "all symbols on the linker stage refer to addresses, even the one you calculated arithmetically"
2016-10-18 10:33:29	atk	I had memcpy(&_sdata, &_flashdata, _ldata);
2016-10-18 10:33:44	atk	I don't even know why the first two had & until I noticed now
2016-10-18 10:33:56	atk	because I thought when I set things in the linker script and then refer to them, I'm referring to the values.

2016-10-18 10:35:25	cousteau	i.e. from C's point of view, _sdata and _edata are objects.  From the linker's point of view, they're "symbols", i.e. addresses, i.e. numbers.  Then you make another symbol (number) by subtracting them.  So from C's point of view, said symbol is just another object.

2016-10-18 12:36:20	latch	yeah there's generally a stack size limit in implementations
2016-10-18 12:36:38	latch	but VLA suffers the same fate
2016-10-18 12:36:51	latch	since its just automatic storage like alloca
2016-10-18 12:36:58	jasondockers	well, I mean it can fail and overrun my stack without me knowing
2016-10-18 12:37:13	jasondockers	so you should only allocate little bits of memory
2016-10-18 12:37:25	jasondockers	I guess VLA isn't better?
2016-10-18 12:37:30	nHeck	chrisf: i dont, but it exists no?
2016-10-18 12:37:54	chrisf	nHeck: no, both are required to be present.
2016-10-18 12:38:14	jasondockers	latch, never mind. I read your follow-up messages
2016-10-18 12:38:15	nHeck	oh, then it's just a matter of picking one é_è
2016-10-18 12:38:35	latch	well alloca is posix so VLA is more useful if you dont want that. And VLA performs better natively because it doesnt have to manually toy with your stack like alloca does :)
2016-10-18 12:38:46	latch	plus sizeof works
2016-10-18 12:39:57	chrisf	nHeck: what are you actually trying to do though?

2016-10-18 16:23:31	Stragus	Aww. I always, always use bitwise when possible
2016-10-18 16:23:40	jack_rabbit	That's silly. :)
2016-10-18 16:23:41	Hello71	if you never use networking or filesystem APIs and also do not alias pointers by char * then endianness does not matter in C
2016-10-18 16:24:00	eiku	I wasn’t suggesting we all use that (but I’m not going to argue about that since I’m very far from knowlegeable about low-level things)
2016-10-18 16:24:13	Hello71	twkm: the kernel does at least 1<<1, 1<<2, 1<<3 etc
2016-10-18 16:24:29	Stragus	If I see a foo / bar, I read that as an actual divide with a 42 cycles overhead. I want to see the actual operations being performed
2016-10-18 16:25:14	Hello71	one, I'm pretty sure integer division can be executed in parallel with other operations on typical x86 processors
2016-10-18 16:25:30	Stragus	Wrong
2016-10-18 16:25:31	Hello71	two, C already hides lots of platform-specific details
2016-10-18 16:25:33	twkm	to produce bit masks.
2016-10-18 16:26:25	Hello71	e.g. auto-vectorization (not technically C, but a property of C implementations that people actually use)
2016-10-18 16:26:55	twkm	eiku: the key is that however 010101 is written in memory the value is 010101.  only when writing the memory representation of it and that needs more than 1 byte does endian come into play.
2016-10-18 16:26:57	Stragus	I also do my own vectorization, SSE/AVX/NEON. Basically, I like my C as low-level as possible, and that means seeing what's a division and what's a shift
2016-10-18 16:27:29	nelder	hello, all, is anybody can help my with simple question... how gcc is know about syntax .c-file is it c++ or just C. for example this file https://paste.pound-python.org/show/ylPjxewimVrK6VtfdF3V/
2016-10-18 16:27:51	jack_rabbit	Shifting obfuscates meaning. Most programs are not CPU bound. Unless I show that my program is CPU bound and that shifting is going to improve things, I don't do it.
2016-10-18 16:27:57	jack_rabbit	(And I've never had to do it.)

2016-10-18 16:29:28	eiku	gcc compiles to C by default (afaik), and the g++ command compiles to c++ (I think)

2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:21:44] i'm not such a jerk [08:21:44]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	dminuoso_	[08:21:52] lionrouge: It is very common practice. [08:21:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	dminuoso_	[08:22:04] lionrouge: There's places where your commits dont go through audit unless they meet coding style guidelines. [08:22:04]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:22:12] it's not the case [08:22:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	dminuoso_	[08:22:15] Many OS projects will reject pull requests if the code looks shitty. [08:22:15]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:22:31] i can't make anyone involved to refactor it [08:22:31]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:22:57] and actually python' [08:22:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:23:05] autopep and go fmt are awesome [08:23:05]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:23:19] it's note about being stupid it's about readability and easiness to share code [08:23:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:23:28] no spaces holywars [08:23:28]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:24:20] looks like there is GNU indent and clang-format [08:24:20]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	pragma-	[08:24:38] and about 100 others [08:24:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:28:40] clang-format works gorgeous [08:28:40]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	pragma-	[08:29:41] "gorgeous" is subjective. I bet that I hate your styling choices. [08:29:41]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	pragma-	[08:31:01] I'm already pretty sure that I hate you.  You're submitting code that is not yours? [08:31:01]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	dminuoso_	[08:32:49] lionrouge: No the underlying issue is not lack of tools, its lack of enforced policies. [08:32:49]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	Maxdamantus	[08:34:57] Just use vim's copyindent (or something equivalent). [08:34:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	Maxdamantus	[08:35:13] There shouldn't be any controversy with that mechanism. [08:35:13]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	dminuoso_	[08:41:57] Maxdamantus: The issue is he wants to fix style from other people not following style guidelines. [08:41:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	avrdude	[08:44:42] why.. send the code back to them and tell them it's garbage [08:44:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:45:35] pragma-: i'm not submitting anything [08:45:35]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:45:38] it's not open-source [08:45:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:45:43] the code is legacy [08:45:43]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:45:52] peoples who made it are far away [08:45:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:46:35] and i simplify it dramatically because it's full of unnecessary generalisations [08:46:35]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:46:51] and when i copy parts of code i get a mess of indents [08:46:51]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:46:59] that is my problem [08:46:59]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	c125	[09:02:29] I want to compile one .c file with other flags in the makefile [09:02:29]

2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:21:44] i'm not such a jerk [08:21:44]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	dminuoso_	[08:21:52] lionrouge: It is very common practice. [08:21:52]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	dminuoso_	[08:22:04] lionrouge: There's places where your commits dont go through audit unless they meet coding style guidelines. [08:22:04]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:22:12] it's not the case [08:22:12]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	dminuoso_	[08:22:15] Many OS projects will reject pull requests if the code looks shitty. [08:22:15]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:22:31] i can't make anyone involved to refactor it [08:22:31]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:22:57] and actually python' [08:22:57]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:23:05] autopep and go fmt are awesome [08:23:05]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:23:19] it's note about being stupid it's about readability and easiness to share code [08:23:19]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:23:28] no spaces holywars [08:23:28]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:24:20] looks like there is GNU indent and clang-format [08:24:20]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	pragma-	[08:24:38] and about 100 others [08:24:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:28:40] clang-format works gorgeous [08:28:40]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	pragma-	[08:29:41] "gorgeous" is subjective. I bet that I hate your styling choices. [08:29:41]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	pragma-	[08:31:01] I'm already pretty sure that I hate you.  You're submitting code that is not yours? [08:31:01]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	dminuoso_	[08:32:49] lionrouge: No the underlying issue is not lack of tools, its lack of enforced policies. [08:32:49]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	Maxdamantus	[08:34:57] Just use vim's copyindent (or something equivalent). [08:34:57]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	Maxdamantus	[08:35:13] There shouldn't be any controversy with that mechanism. [08:35:13]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	dminuoso_	[08:41:57] Maxdamantus: The issue is he wants to fix style from other people not following style guidelines. [08:41:57]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	avrdude	[08:44:42] why.. send the code back to them and tell them it's garbage [08:44:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:45:35] pragma-: i'm not submitting anything [08:45:35]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:45:38] it's not open-source [08:45:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:45:43] the code is legacy [08:45:43]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:45:52] peoples who made it are far away [08:45:52]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:46:35] and i simplify it dramatically because it's full of unnecessary generalisations [08:46:35]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:46:51] and when i copy parts of code i get a mess of indents [08:46:51]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:46:59] that is my problem [08:46:59]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	c125	[09:02:29] I want to compile one .c file with other flags in the makefile [09:02:29]

2016-10-19 07:03:52	@candide	If you are using a C++ compiler then your code is not C -- even if you're only using the "C subset". As soon as you invoke a C++ compiler instead of a C compiler, all the rules and idiosyncrasies of the C++ specification come into play, which have subtle differences in certain semantics. Please ask ##c++ or switch to a C compiler.
2016-10-19 07:03:57	latch	ehhhhhh
2016-10-19 07:04:40	jmd	Sorry for the stupid question, but is "i ++" always going to do the same thing as "i++" ?

2016-10-19 10:27:25	@candide	Undefined behavior is behavior for which the C standard does not impose any requirements. This is to allow C the freedom to be implemented on systems with different architectures. Programs invoking undefined behavior may appear to compile and even run without errors at first, only to fail on another system, or even at a later time. If you want to write reliable code, don't use such behaviors.

2016-10-19 10:28:08	CaZe	Oops, I messed up the output indices.
2016-10-19 10:28:52	latch	basically you asked your implementation for 1 sizeof test and it gave you a bunch of memory (probably a page worth). its ub to use that memory, but probably wont segfault until you hit a page boundary. all of that is imp specific and undefined though
2016-10-19 10:28:53	CaZe	jasondockers: Yes, accessing out of bounds of an array invokes undefined behavior.

2016-10-19 10:29:24	jasondockers	CaZe, okay, so you're creating an array of pointers, assigning them to the address of `i`, and then printing them. shouldn't malloc be 100* sizeof *p
2016-10-19 10:29:28	CaZe	jasondockers: But the behavior is undefined. Saying that it "should fail" would actually be defining the behavior.

2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:22:52] I'm feeling stupid because I'm not sure of the distinction between FILE * and the integer file descriptions, like I get when I open pipe()s [00:22:52]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:23:03] Are they even close to interchangeable? [00:23:03]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:23:42] I've seen the word 'stream' and 'file' used differently in the POSIX specification, but not on the internet when I googled the problem, it seems the integers are files and the FILE * are streams [00:23:42]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:24:01] FILE * are the C standard library's handle for a file. File descriptors are unix/posix handles, not part of standard C. [00:24:01]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:25:04] They're not "interchangeable", but when you fopen a file in C on a posix system there will be a file descriptor "under the hood". See fileno(). [00:25:04]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:25:20] Mixing calls that deal with FILE * and calls that deal with file descriptors is likely to cause pain. [00:25:20]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:25:57] Ah, useful, thank you. So I could use fdopen() to get a FILE handler for my file descriptor, I think? [00:25:57]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	emg	[00:26:12] jl-: in the off chance you're actually interested, fixed version: http://ix.io/1xIR   now I want to use manhattan pair distance instead of just manhattan distance [00:26:12]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:26:21] http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fdopen.html is where I got that notion [00:26:21]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:26:22] Vaelatern: yes. [00:26:22]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:26:40] But you'd need a good reason to do that. [00:26:40]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:27:11] Okay, I guess reading from a pipe() isn't a good enough reason? [00:27:11]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:27:46] POSIX [obviously] has functions for reading using file descriptors. Compare read() and fread(). [00:27:46]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:28:35] So I'm not sure of the compelling reason to work with a FILE * if you're already using file descriptors. You've already lost the portability benefit as pipe() is not C. [00:28:35]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	takitus	[00:28:59] Vaelatern: If you need to use stdio with a pipe, that's a good reason to use fdopen(). [00:28:59]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:29:37] But what's the reason to "use stdio with a pipe"? [00:29:37]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:29:54] I couldn't find a C happy way to execute a command and get the output of that command without using pipe() [00:29:54]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:30:09] Vaelatern: indeed, standard C has no way to do that. [00:30:09]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:31:29] Slightly surprising, with the roots and UNIX and all [00:31:29]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	takitus	[00:31:52] Reading newline-delimited data with fgets() or getline(), I suppose. [00:31:52]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:32:01] Well, they recognised that not all systems could support such a thing. [00:32:01]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	NOPonPOP	[00:33:17] Vaelatern: does your command take any user supplied data? [00:33:17]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:33:21] Hm, could read() be used to read char by char? [00:33:21]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	takitus	[00:33:30] Vaelatern: POSIX has popen(), although it's inflexible [00:33:30]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:33:34] NOPonPOP: No, but the program specifies the flags used [00:33:34]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:33:37] Vaelatern: yes, inefficiently. [00:33:37]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	NOPonPOP	[00:34:15] Vaelatern: ah, ive gotten in the habit of letting other binaries i invoke write output to a file and read it after i see system() or fork/exec is fine [00:34:15]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:34:19] I guess the RightWay to read from a buffer would be to fill up a char array and copy it over 80 chars at the time [00:34:19]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	***	Playback Complete.
2016-10-19 14:34:42	NOPonPOP	Vaelatern: ideally you wold read more than 1 byte at a time, but you certainly can.

2016-10-19 20:40:01	Stragus	[04:53:55] On x86, misaligned loads/stores are typically just a little slower. On most intel chips though, you hit a huge penalty for crossing a cache line... and an astronomical penalty for crossing a page boundary [04:53:55]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	chrisf	[04:53:59] in the fun cases the low bits of the address just get thrown away [04:53:59]

2016-10-19 20:40:01	chrisf	[05:01:20] Stragus: unaligned loads return rotated contents; unaligned stores get their low bits thrown away [05:01:20]

2016-10-19 20:40:01	Stragus	[05:27:16] These certainly aren't functions I know [05:27:16]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	Neslepaks	[05:27:49] Why aren't the childs getting reaped, can anyone tell me? https://ideone.com/TSPL4s [05:27:49]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	clue	[05:42:20] Stragus: I just realized these are all functions created by the writer of the book im using [05:42:20]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	Maxdamantus	[05:50:15] Neslepaks: you probably want to actually associate the children with a single process group and avoid just killing the parent. [05:50:15]

2016-10-19 20:40:01	blz37	[06:03:21] Two ways to use a linked list: embed the linked node in the data node or the linked node envelopes the data. There is some fancy terms for those. I couldn't recall them right away. If anybody knows at the top of their head, let me know. [06:03:21]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	blz37	[06:03:26] Sorry, not strictly c question. [06:03:26]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	blz37	[06:13:09] Found them: exogenous and endogenous. [06:13:09]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	Stragus	[06:21:25] blz37: I would stick to "inside the struct" and "outside the struct" [06:21:25]
2016-10-19 20:40:01	blz37	[06:24:11] Stragus: I agree. According to google search, the last book with those words were published in 1983: Data Structures and Network Algorithms by Robert Endre Tarjan. [06:24:11]

2016-10-20 00:25:30	M4GNV5	[08:25:10] try that, if your lucky you get a conditional jump depending on conditional memory warning etc. and can fix it easily [08:25:10]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:25:20] thanks [08:25:20]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:27:43] M4GNV5: ==19119== Invalid write of size 4 ??? it points to the memcpy, but i am confused? where does it write that is wrong? [08:27:43]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	M4GNV5	[08:28:41] can you send the full output? (pastebin etc.) [08:28:41]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	M4GNV5	[08:28:56] however from that one line i guess the first argument you pass to memcpy is wrong [08:28:56]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:29:02] yes, of course [08:29:02]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:29:59] M4GNV5: funnily enough it works on valgrind [08:29:59]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	M4GNV5	[08:31:10] hmm and no warnings by valgrind? [08:31:10]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:31:12] M4GNV5: http://termbin.com/1pif [08:31:12]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:31:29] M4GNV5: there are, i put them there [08:31:29]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	M4GNV5	[08:32:00] i guess you should fix the "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value" first [08:32:00]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	M4GNV5	[08:32:09] also did you compile with -g? [08:32:09]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	M4GNV5	[08:32:18] for some reason your missing backtraces [08:32:18]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:33:00] M4GNV5: huh [08:33:00]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:33:10] if doesnt show anything else [08:33:10]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:33:18] no didnt compile with -g [08:33:18]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	M4GNV5	[08:33:41] compile with -g then you should get backtraces with line numbers for every warning [08:33:41]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	M4GNV5	[08:33:55] only the most recent function is pretty useless lol [08:33:55]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	M4GNV5	[08:34:27] ima drive home now though, gonna be back in 1.5-2h [08:34:27]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:34:47] ok [08:34:47]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	CaZe	[08:36:13] theFam: What line did you say it segfaulted? [08:36:13]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:37:59] CaZe: the line after varr_unshift [08:37:59]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:38:48] can i not copy to 4 bytes after a pointer? i am confused [08:38:48]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	CaZe	[08:44:48] theFam: What is he expected output? [08:44:48]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:46:29] CaZe: 0 4 8 12 as the positions array items [08:46:29]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	CaZe	[08:47:55] theFam: I get: "0x5e1deb85e60 0x5e1deb85e70\n0 0\n0 4\n0 8\n\n" [08:47:55]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:48:29] weird [08:48:29]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	CaZe	[08:48:31] theFam: Oh, and I added a bunch of casts to char *. [08:48:31]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:48:37] huh [08:48:37]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	CaZe	[08:49:02] Because of what klys said. [08:49:02]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	CaZe	[08:51:13] http://termbin.com/wc3y [08:51:13]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:53:16] can you post your code? [08:53:16]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:53:17] maybe my arm device is broken [08:53:17]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:53:17] klys? [08:53:17]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:53:17] ah [08:53:17]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:53:17] thanks [08:53:17]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:54:30] sieg heil [08:54:30]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:55:51] CaZe: probably void */int * would be more appropiate but I see what you mean [08:55:51]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	CaZe	[08:56:08] Why int *? [08:56:08]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:56:18] for the positions array [08:56:18]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	CaZe	[08:57:28] Which line? [08:57:28]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:58:07] CaZe: nevermind [08:58:07]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:58:13] you didnt change it [08:58:13]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[08:58:38] brb lunch [08:58:38]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	CaZe	[08:58:48] positions is declared as an int *, so I didn't need to. [08:58:48]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	CaZe	[08:59:24] items is declared as a void *, so if you want to do arithmetic on it, it needs to know the size of what's being pointed to. [08:59:24]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	CaZe	[09:01:12] Anyway, I'd be surprised if that fixed your problem. Your system was probably treating the void * as char * anyway, for the purposes of pointer arithmetic. [09:01:12]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	theFam	[09:18:30] CaZe: it's still buggy here, but that might be my device. thanks for the help/ [09:18:30]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	M4GNV5	[10:19:00] ay re [10:19:00]
2016-10-20 00:25:30	M4GNV5	[10:19:03] still not fixed? [10:19:03]

2016-10-20 01:20:16	LukeLR	I have run my code on my laptop now, and it works, no endless loop
2016-10-20 01:20:35	LukeLR	the platform this code is written for is raspberry pi, so the hint with "arm compilers make it unsigned" might apply

2016-10-20 01:21:33	fizzie	Use 'int c' instead of 'char c'.

2016-10-20 02:32:09	jantje	Hi having a typedef struct { int x:1 } tX; and a declaration like tX X = {0} , will it zero the four bytes or just the byte of the bitfield? Does {0} also mean 'all members' or just the first one?. Compiler is GCC.
2016-10-20 02:32:42	jantje	I tried it out on my machine and it seems to initialize to zero even without the initializer, probably just luck?

2016-10-20 03:22:03	Akuli	i thought char[...] and char * are different types
2016-10-20 03:22:16	Akuli	and i was asking if there's difference between how they're used
2016-10-20 03:22:20	theFam	they technically are not, but there are differences
2016-10-20 03:22:23	CaZe	Akuli: A pointer to the array would have type char (*)[10].
2016-10-20 03:22:28	theFam	^
2016-10-20 03:22:45	theFam	argv is an example of that, it's a char **
2016-10-20 03:22:48	CaZe	They technically are different, because they have completely different types.
2016-10-20 03:22:58	theFam	CaZe: huh?
2016-10-20 03:23:20	Akuli	so... i can just treat pointers as arrays and arrays as pointers and everything will work?

2016-10-20 03:25:07	Akuli	oh i see, &array is the array's memory address and &arraypointer is the pointer's memory address

2016-10-20 03:25:43	Akuli	do void thing(char * stuff) { ... } and void thingy(char stuff[]) { ... } differ in some way?
2016-10-20 03:25:48	koro	so if you declare 8 different variables like int x:1, it will only use 8 bits for them?
2016-10-20 03:25:52	M4GNV5	Akuli, no
2016-10-20 03:26:08	Akuli	so i always get a pointer from a function definition?
2016-10-20 03:26:20	Akuli	or an array?
2016-10-20 03:26:22	CaZe	Akuli: No, but to pass a pointer to the array you had before, it would need to be void thing(char (*stuff)[10]);
2016-10-20 03:26:26	M4GNV5	Akuli, even void thingything(char stuff[16]) { ... ) should be the same however the compiler will warn you if you do stuff[17] etc.

2016-10-20 03:26:57	Akuli	hmm
2016-10-20 03:27:52	koro	CaZe: but if you don't explicitly request packing it won't happen, or will it/
2016-10-20 03:28:05	Random832	koro: It might be implementation-defined. I think it will probably use a whole int (at least 16 bits, most often 32) rather than 8 bits.
2016-10-20 03:28:09	Akuli	so calling the function defines the type it's going to get?
2016-10-20 03:28:27	CaZe	koro: It's required to if it can fit wholly.

2016-10-20 07:43:37	rith	cipher__, in OO languages with more abstraction, it's much more common. C system interfaces force you to know a lot about implementations, so I don't see people typically expend much effort in hiding their data structures

2016-10-20 07:45:47	atk	Certainly there's a bit of boilerplate involved whenever you use it, but at the same time that small boilerplate accounts for a lot of abstraction.

2016-10-20 17:48:16	BeaverLeader_	Howdy. I'm wondering if there is a way for me to prove that I have learned C. There is an internship I'm looking at doing in a couple years from now and they require that you have taken a class in C (college students) or have something to show that you learned it. My school doesn't teach a C course. Anything I can do to officially show I have learned C and experienced it?
2016-10-20 17:48:28	MaxLeiter	make a program
2016-10-20 17:48:32	MaxLeiter	put on git somewhere
2016-10-20 17:49:14	BeaverLeader_	Uhh I mean that sounds great but that doesn't give me something comfortable to stand on when I apply
2016-10-20 17:50:25	pnbeast	BeaverLeader_, contribute significantly to some open source C program?  How do you expect this channel to explain what a potential position will accept as evidence, though?

2016-10-20 17:58:48	eiku	However, is it possible to do that if the argument type isn’t a pointer type?
2016-10-20 17:58:50	BeaverLeader_	Actually, I am going through the course catalog again and there is a "class" that is for "special needs" basis. Approval by department chair

2016-10-20 21:08:42	dminuoso_	(Well you may also pun through a char pointer)
2016-10-20 21:09:40	dminuoso_	EricHerman: Before C89 the only way to type pun while conforming to C89 that I know of is to memcpy
2016-10-20 21:09:45	dminuoso_	Before C99 I mean.

2016-10-20 21:10:36	EricHerman	If I have a (void *) and I cast it to a struct of any type, I can then index into that struct.

2016-10-20 21:11:40	EricHerman	C89 would certainly allow me to cast that to one type of struct and later pass it to a fuction which casts it to another type of struct.
2016-10-20 21:12:11	dminuoso_	EricHerman: No it does not.
2016-10-20 21:12:35	EricHerman	dminuoso_, can you direct me to where in the C89 standard that is made clear?
2016-10-20 21:12:40	dminuoso_	EricHerman: Give me a second.

I'm working on code using sin/cos() that will run on a slow cpu. but I don't know much about optimizations. my idea is to make a function that takes int degrees and looks them up from a lookup table (instead of making float lookup table for radians), is this a good idea?

2016-10-22 04:21:59	rond_	Or anybody else? There is a question in comment related to this piece of code. about fork, execvp and waitpid: https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8920937

2016-10-22 04:24:11	rond_	Amun_Ra: (i know it will execute the given command,for example ls or echo, but after that)
2016-10-22 04:24:44	rond_	so calling execvp is always followed by process termination of the caller?
2016-10-22 04:25:07	evga	eelster, so the buffer is coming for pcap

2016-10-22 04:26:39	eelster	evga: I'm not too familiary with pcap. What's the error you're getting again?
2016-10-22 04:26:55	Amun_Ra	rond_: if you do exec from term not really (I guess)
2016-10-22 04:26:59	evga	eelster, I'm not getting any error.. the code works but I get this warning

2016-10-22 04:27:53	rond_	Amun_Ra: so, summing up: in this scenario i've pasted, the parent will wait, the child will do "execvp", after this it will be terminated (but there is no code for it...?) and then the parent will wake up. All correct?
2016-10-22 04:27:58	evga	eelster, and I'm wondering if it's the right thing to do

2016-10-22 04:28:54	Amun_Ra	rond_: yes
2016-10-22 04:29:22	evga	eelster, cause it's a pointer to a buffer of chars ?

2016-10-22 04:30:24	rond_	Amun_Ra: i think it's a bit strange that execvp includes "exit(0)", but i have to accept this :)
2016-10-22 04:31:11	Amun_Ra	rond_: it's not the execvp that includes exit(0) - it's the process that replaces the current one does

2016-10-22 13:25:02	thebloggu	I'm developing a PAM module and testing it with pamtester along with valgrind and I'm finding 4 blocks of memory that we're not free'd. Can someone tell me how can I start to find where the memory leaks? How can I be sure it's in my shared library and not in pamtester? In case it's in my shared library, how can I find where did I forget to free memory?

2016-10-22 13:55:44	kate	perhaps your make dialect provides some mechanism for looping over a set, such that you don't have to write those by hand. i don't know; you haven't said what dialect of make you're using, and this isn't a channel for make

2016-10-22 22:46:07	Maxdamantus	LOMAS_: alternatively, you could allocate some memory.

2016-10-22 23:31:11	atk	error returns are the natural way of identifying that an expected error occured - like the end of a file
2016-10-22 23:31:21	atk	exceptions should be reserved for exceptional circumstances
2016-10-22 23:31:39	atk	like the case where suddenly the disk gets disconnected would be exceptional, but a file ending is not
2016-10-22 23:31:53	atk	Which is why java's idea that end of file should be an exception is pretty silly.

2016-10-23 04:32:59	Xsavior	Hi, I'm trying to figure out the best way to deal with "state" in my program. I was thinking of using a dummy function that takes a state changing function. The dummy would simply execute the function in the argument. I'm a beginner so be nice ;). So maybe that's stupid. Does anyone have any advice about how to go about that?

2016-10-23 04:49:02	Xsavior	kate: I just gave it as an example. There are other things I'm doing as well. Also, I'm not doing things exactly as normal because I'm using a grid so I don't really need to have a widget object, that's why i'm actually storing it it..... Anyways, I have that working. The gui works the way I want it and it's not using widgets the normal way... I just thought I would organize my state better and was wondering if there was some
2016-10-23 04:49:02	Xsavior	technical term for a technique for dealing with state that I could search for on google. Some programming style technique. That's really what I'm asking.
2016-10-23 04:49:34	kate	Xsavior: i think it's a good example, because it shows that this state is attached to an instance of the widget, rather than to your pointer
2016-10-23 04:49:49	kate	Xsavior: what you're looking for is called a finite state machine

2016-10-23 04:53:44	kate	well, if you prefer. personally i'd think this stuff ought to belong to a widget - and then when i destroy it, it can take its own state with it

2016-10-23 06:15:27	@candide	There is no need to cast the result of library functions that return void *; it makes your code hard to read, adds no value, and can hide a bug if you don't have a valid prototype in scope. See http://c-faq.com/malloc/mallocnocast.html

2016-10-23 07:45:35	r7st	i figured this must be because the r/w pipe operations are just going on without waiting. OH and i have one reader and writer accessing the shared memory at a time
2016-10-23 07:45:45	Xgc	BerryWhite: That's usually called undefined behavior.  It's a kind of mistake that can turn up at any time at or after the mistake.

2016-10-23 07:46:32	r7st	i suppose select should be used for pipe synchronization? I thought read() and write() were blocking by default wouldn't this take care of it?
2016-10-23 07:46:32	kate	r7st: ok. so what's your current hypothesis?

2016-10-23 07:48:52	Xgc	BerryWhite: Think about what happens if you corrupt an area of memory that isn't used again until the program tries to exit.  You may think the program was mainly successful and some error only happened at exit, when the error / corruption actually happened long ago.
2016-10-23 07:49:15	r7st	kate: what do you mean by hypothesis then?

I set print statements to tes where my program crashes, and theres even one right after the main method, but it doesnt even print that. My program compiles fine and when I run it, it doesn't give a segfault. When I compile it as gcc -o, for some reason, it does give a segfault. Confused and hoping someone could help me out. Thanks!

2016-10-23 16:35:31	Love4Boobies	insane_tesla: Numbers are just numbers, with values. They can be represented in all sorts of ways: using fingers, roman numerals, base 2, base 16, etc. Positional number systems (like base 10) just represent things in terms of sums of magnitudes.
2016-10-23 16:36:42	Love4Boobies	insane_tesla: Each symbol really means that you are adding the value it represents times its magnitude (its position).
2016-10-23 16:37:15	Love4Boobies	So the representation 123 just means 100 + 20 + 3 (or, more precisely, 1*10^2 + 2*10^1 + 3*10^0).
2016-10-23 16:37:20	Love4Boobies	That holds for every base.
2016-10-23 16:37:45	Love4Boobies	0xFAAF means F*16^4 + A*16^3 + ...
2016-10-23 16:38:31	Love4Boobies	So each symbol is multiplied by the base raised to the power of its position (the least significant being 0) and added to the whole.

2016-10-23 17:07:53	Love4Boobies	I didn't parse that correctly because of the *1 (which I parsed as *7^1 and extrapolated the rest).
2016-10-23 17:08:09	insane_tesla	because doing that opeartion still returns a value

2016-10-23 17:09:09	Love4Boobies	insane_tesla: That's exactly what I am trying to convey. A quantity is independent of its representation. When you calculate it, you will probably use base 10 because that's how you are used to writing numbers (you can only write things as representations, after all).
2016-10-23 17:09:32	Love4Boobies	But the result isn't in a base. It's just an abstract quantity.

2016-10-23 18:30:09	winsoff	Can I make a function that calls a function by name?
2016-10-23 18:30:29	winsoff	Something like: void caller(function name, parameter param) { name(param); } ?
2016-10-23 18:30:53	Random832	winsoff: "by name"?
2016-10-23 18:30:57	Random832	like as a string?
2016-10-23 18:31:05	winsoff	I guess that makes more sense
2016-10-23 18:31:18	Random832	anyway you can make a function that you can pass a function pointer into
2016-10-23 18:31:52	Random832	void caller(void (*fptr)(int), int param) { fptr(param); }

2016-10-24 00:57:15	jantje	With GCC I can do something as, typedef struct { struct { int X[a]; } Y[b]; } tType; X=malloc(sizeof(*results)), however, clang does not support VLA inside structs, How is this supposed to be coded? Do I need to take the size of X and Y and just multiply? Do I need to be worried about alignmnet etc?  Can I continue to access it as X->x[n].y[n] ?

2016-10-24 00:57:40	blue_	Hi, I would like to know how to find the flags required by the compiler to run SDL_* libs. I've install SDL2 lib without any problem and now I try to compile with SDL2_ttf lib but I still get undefined reference. Since I installed the package I think it comes from the flag I use to compile. Hence my question: How to find the flags required by the compiler to link the librabry ?

2016-10-24 01:46:35	Naan	the intuition is that pointing to stuff out of bounds isn't going to matter if i overwrite anything that does that in the next step of the code

2016-10-24 06:43:41	nevodka	and I want to use rpc to send these commands from the client
2016-10-24 06:44:03	nevodka	I have the logic all written in the server, and I created an rpc function which calls the server function
2016-10-24 06:44:28	nevodka	my issue is the client is complaining that the rpc function is an undefined reference
2016-10-24 06:44:28	jasondockers	Stragus, for instance, if the switch statement were in a function named eval, then I might call eval twice on each sub-node of trinary, binary, and unary operators.
2016-10-24 06:44:41	jasondockers	I might call eval*
2016-10-24 06:44:56	nevodka	even though im including the function.h that was generated by rpcgen
2016-10-24 06:45:14	jasondockers	Stragus, in pseudo-code: eval{ case binop: eval(node->left); eval(node->right) }
2016-10-24 06:45:17	Stragus	nevodka, the .h contains the prototype, not the function definition. I have no experience with your RPC libraries though

2016-10-24 06:46:58	nevodka	I currently have the function definition inside the server code

2016-10-24 06:58:40	Saparok	there were several standards for a while about a decade ago to specify how to do this stuff over the network, via SNMP, DMI, etc. Most of the big players seem to favor proprietary methods though, so it never got a lot of traction.

2016-10-24 12:12:37	_sfiguser	atk,  to me enum seem more suited for multiple constants
2016-10-24 12:12:58	jasondockers	atk, why is that? it's a pointer to that type.
2016-10-24 12:13:03	atk	_sfiguser: well, I don't put a single one in there, but if you don't give the enum a name and just use it for its ability to produce limitless constants, it's great
2016-10-24 12:13:19	atk	jasondockers: consider, what type is a and b in this example: int* a, b;
2016-10-24 12:13:30	jasondockers	a is a pointer to an int and b is an int
2016-10-24 12:13:33	jasondockers	I see your point

2016-10-24 16:47:47	rooftopjoe	posix make is so limited and different from what is normally used that you have to actually use .POSIX to order to tell tools that it's posix makefile
2016-10-24 16:47:48	barfod	i only use those to replace configure script logic
2016-10-24 16:48:03	barfod	in fact i don't see why GNU autoconf generates anything _but_ posix makefiles

2016-10-24 17:28:03	Stragus	Agreed

2016-10-24 17:29:39	Zhivago	utf-8 does have some losing cases -- it's pretty terrible for indic scripts, for example.
2016-10-24 17:30:07	Zhivago	But generally those issues can be dealt with using simple compression.

2016-10-24 17:32:49	Zhivago	It's more that you run out of space in the utf-8 encoding scheme at that point.

2016-10-24 18:54:12	Maxdamantus	eg, if you decide to carry around structures holding function pointers, should those structures be updated when you update whatever initialises those structures?
2016-10-24 18:54:58	doppel	all right, let's see if this works
2016-10-24 18:55:12	CaZe	,works
2016-10-24 18:55:12	@candide	It works it works! Omg omg omg! I mean it compiles. Now what's a segfault?
2016-10-24 18:56:02	AlecTaylor	Maxdamantus: Obviously there would need to be restrictions, like the schema can only expand and renames are stored in an alias table (meaning you can't rename then create a new column of that original name)
2016-10-24 18:56:40	AlecTaylor	But yeah, the main thing is knowing this is straightforward in C
2016-10-24 18:57:15	Stragus	None of it is "hard", but it can end up being a *lot* of bookkeeping code
2016-10-24 18:57:54	doppel	well that's why i said "let's see if this works", not "let's see if this compiles".
2016-10-24 18:58:07	doppel	it don't mean dick if it compiles if it doesn't work, obviously.

2016-10-24 22:59:52	xsdfdfsa	To avoid serious problems, Valgrind will simply stop collecting errors after 1,000 different errors have been seen, or 10,000,000 errors in total have been seen. In this situation you might as well stop your program and fix it, because Valgrind won't tell you anything else useful after this. Note that the 1,000/10,000,000 limits apply after suppressed errors are removed. These limits are defined in m_errormgr.c and can be increased if necessary.

I think there's a reason why professors want you to learn C, it's history is so rich, and so basic for all programming. If you can code C, then you can code in every language.

2016-10-25 11:47:13	twkm	[21:44:16] how many variable arguments did you tell the function that you supplied? [21:44:16]
2016-10-25 11:47:13	jasondockers	[21:44:23] twkm, 3. [21:44:23]
2016-10-25 11:47:13	twkm	[21:44:32] paste i can see says 2. [21:44:32]
2016-10-25 11:47:13	jasondockers	[21:44:41] twkm, right, because 3 will cause a runtime error. [21:44:41]
2016-10-25 11:47:13	twkm	[21:45:05] so you don't print the supplied argument, just the variable arguments.  no surprise there. [21:45:05]
2016-10-25 11:47:13	jasondockers	[21:45:50] twkm, oh... 4 [21:45:50]
2016-10-25 11:47:13	twkm	[21:45:50] (sorry, i thought you meant it wasn't printing all the variable arguments) [21:45:50]
2016-10-25 11:47:13	jasondockers	[21:45:56] I didn't realize it was a count of all arguments [21:45:56]
2016-10-25 11:47:13	twkm	[21:46:00] well, no, 2 variable arguments. [21:46:00]
2016-10-25 11:47:13	twkm	[21:46:14] but test is not part of the results va_arg will provide. [21:46:14]
