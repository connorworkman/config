2016-10-17 15:29:09	kate	Grr_: the average part looks okay to me. don't forget to handle the situation where malloc returns NULL. i do not see why this function would need to call malloc
2016-10-17 15:29:09		[15:29]
2016-10-17 15:29:37	chrisf	the malloc looks pointless, the list `a` passed in isnt used at all; and you dont initialize runNode
2016-10-17 15:30:30	kate	it's like an abstract painting of C
2016-10-17 15:30:40	chrisf	nothing wrong with the averaging (up to overflows) if you fix all the breakage around it
2016-10-17 15:30:52	kate	maybe impressionist. it has the colour of C

2016-10-17 15:35:34	chrisf	should look carefully at every `Malloc the memory` block and question whether it makes any sense.
2016-10-17 15:35:34	Towel	hey everyone. Anyone familiar with the "linus" method of removing an element from a singly linked-list where you use a double pointer and then just &(*head)->next to iterate?
2016-10-17 15:35:35	stvn	same
2016-10-17 15:35:57	Towel	I understand it, but don't know how to keep that same methodology and apply it for dynamically allocated elements

2016-10-17 16:03:39	 *	chrisf wonders what the initial contents of this file were.
2016-10-17 16:03:47	Xgc	Grr_: When you use the expression a->next ... you are expecting the type of a to be a struct pointer, and for that struct to contain a specific member.
2016-10-17 16:03:53	hypnopothesis	I'm guessing here, but doesn't the compiler errors explain exactly what the problem is?

2016-10-17 16:04:29	Grr_	It might tell me this but I do not understand it
2016-10-17 16:04:45	Xgc	Grr_: Go back and study pointers to structures.
2016-10-17 16:05:23	Xgc	Grr_: It takes time.
2016-10-17 16:05:37	Grr_	Yeah but in the meantime I need to complete this assignment

2016-10-17 16:06:01	Grr_	So the arrows are the problem and I don't need to add anything to listADT or listCDT?

2016-10-17 16:06:32	Grr_	I only chose those variable names from the internet post I got the idea from they are not set in stone
2016-10-17 16:06:48	Grr_	Can I change their names and make these errors go away?

2016-10-17 16:07:33	hypnopothesis	I've never been to school, yet guessing again, shouldn't the professor teach you everything you need up to this point in the project?
2016-10-17 16:08:05	Grr_	Yes but because this is my first time round with c I am having trouble picking it up so quickly
2016-10-17 16:08:16	 *	hypnopothesis says based on having no direction and think it would be different in school
