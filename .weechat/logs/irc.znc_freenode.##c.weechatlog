2016-10-17 12:29:47	atk	out of range cells can wrap (or in this case probably just be 0)
2016-10-17 12:29:55	atk	in range cells get taken from the previous state
2016-10-17 12:30:07	atk	It's possible to use one buffer for this.

2016-10-17 12:31:46	Naan	so the way i've done it for the in range data is ok?
2016-10-17 12:32:42	Naan	there's 4 lines per rule and i have about 7 more rules >_<
2016-10-17 12:32:55	atk	You should only need one line per rule.

2016-10-17 12:35:16	Naan	i don't know how either of those things work heh
2016-10-17 12:35:49	atk	it's an image format which is based on text
2016-10-17 12:36:15	atk	one black pixel would actually be just a 3 line file: "P1\n1 1\n1"

2016-10-17 12:36:47	atk	the first line, here P1 is the format, PBM (portable bitmap), this means black (1) or white (0).
2016-10-17 12:37:17	atk	the second line is the width and height respectively
2016-10-17 12:37:35	atk	then the next height number of lines contain width number of numbers between 0 and 1 representing the bits
