2016-10-17 15:29:09	kate	Grr_: the average part looks okay to me. don't forget to handle the situation where malloc returns NULL. i do not see why this function would need to call malloc
2016-10-17 15:29:09		[15:29]
2016-10-17 15:29:37	chrisf	the malloc looks pointless, the list `a` passed in isnt used at all; and you dont initialize runNode
2016-10-17 15:30:30	kate	it's like an abstract painting of C
2016-10-17 15:30:40	chrisf	nothing wrong with the averaging (up to overflows) if you fix all the breakage around it
2016-10-17 15:30:52	kate	maybe impressionist. it has the colour of C

2016-10-17 15:35:34	Towel	hey everyone. Anyone familiar with the "linus" method of removing an element from a singly linked-list where you use a double pointer and then just &(*head)->next to iterate?
2016-10-17 15:35:35	stvn	same
2016-10-17 15:35:57	Towel	I understand it, but don't know how to keep that same methodology and apply it for dynamically allocated elements

2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:43:49] Boobuigi: No. If you mismatch you will get undefined behavior. [08:43:49]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	Boobuigi	[08:44:17] dminuoso_: Undefined... Well, that explains the madness.  Thank you. [08:44:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:44:37] (This is just based on my feeling, since anything else just wouldn't make much sense) [08:44:37]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:44:44] Would have to look up the standard to be sure. [08:44:44]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	Boobuigi	[08:45:37] I agree.  What I'm seeing, though, is that removing type casts results in other, non-typecasted arguments ending up in different positions. [08:45:37]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	Boobuigi	[08:46:28] I expected printf to try and interpret the bits according to the format specifier regardless, but it definitely does not. [08:46:28]

2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:47:34] Boobuigi: There seems to be a complex rules regarding conversions. [08:47:34]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pragma-	[08:47:46] `<nick>: !<command>` is a new additional as of about a week ago or so, if you don't want to type out the tell thing. [08:47:46]

2016-10-18 00:14:19	pragma-	[08:53:31] Mostly because I happened to notice a couple of people trying to invoke the bot at a person by using "person: !command" and of course it didn't work but I took notice and realized that there's no reason that shouldn't work. So, it works now! [08:53:31]

2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:54:02] Ah. [08:54:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pragma-	[08:54:41] Unfortunately that might mean twkm has to make yet another ignore regex. [08:54:41]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:55:03] pragma-: why is that? [08:55:03]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pragma-	[08:55:16] twkm has a weird anti-obsession with bots and https and such. [08:55:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:55:33] So they can just ignore candide altogether? [08:55:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pragma-	[08:55:48] and the bot triggers too [08:55:48]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	Boobuigi	[08:56:47] So what do I do when I want to see what the bits of a particular int would represent, if they were interpreted as a double? [08:56:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:57:05] Boobuigi: Use a union [08:57:05]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:57:14] Or memcpy [08:57:14]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:57:48] Any other method would be a illegal type punning and invoke the wrath of UB. [08:57:48]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	Boobuigi	[08:58:00] dminuoso_: Hehe, good ideas.  I'll give memcpy a shot. [08:58:00]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:58:20] Boobuigi: (Note a violation of this will usually always compile and even run - except the code will not behave as you expect it to) [08:58:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	dminuoso_	[08:59:34] Boobuigi: I think memcpy is the more stable choice, as a union can produce alignment issues. [08:59:34]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	Chris	[09:32:30] pragma-: why doesn't he like https? [09:32:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	CaZe	[09:34:16] Because freedom. [09:34:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	Chris	[09:37:33] OK [09:37:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pragma-	[09:52:12] Chris: why not ask him? [09:52:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pragma-	[09:52:40] he always manages to remain fairly gnomic in his responses thus far [09:52:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	Chris	[09:55:57] That's why I asked you instead. Thought you might have an idea. [09:55:57]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	Chris	[09:56:28] I can't recall him saying anything other than "ugh" in the last few years. [09:56:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pwn	[10:04:24] Anyone have any experience with unit testing frameworks for C? [10:04:24]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pwn	[10:04:43] I've googled and found some popular ones: Unity, Check, CUnit [10:04:43]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pwn	[10:05:15] Any suggestions on which one to go with? Or just make my own? [10:05:15]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pragma-	[10:05:20] great, now experiment with them and you'll have experience with them! [10:05:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pragma-	[10:06:22] you know why there are at least 3 frameworks?  because there are at least 3 different opinions.  why ask for dubious opinions when you can just form your own? [10:06:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	Chris	[10:06:49] You should definitely make your own. Chances are you'll have thought of and addressed all the things the developers of the other ones wouldn't have even considered. [10:06:49]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pwn	[10:07:24] Chris: True, but it is time consuming, not sure i want to invest time in it if something is already available [10:07:24]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pwn	[10:09:25] pragma-: why dubious opinions? i value peoples opinion here to a certain extent. enough that im willing to go with what they suggest more than randomly picking a choice. [10:09:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	u-ou	[10:11:04] my opinion on the matter is that ponies are cute [10:11:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pwn	[10:12:37] u-ou: I have work to do [10:12:37]
2016-10-18 00:14:19	pwn	[10:12:51] (which is why im here trying to avoid doing it) [10:12:51]

2016-10-18 03:55:11	dminuoso_	fstd: The main issue is that that tab stops can have different depth on different levels (so the first tab stop could be 10 characters, the second could be a total of 13, etc)
2016-10-18 03:55:39	dminuoso_	If we had real tab stops, it could be sensibly used I suppose.

2016-10-18 06:06:51	dho	so a check for null around the free is unnecessary. with regards to bad practices, i'm not sure it's a bad practice to do it, but it's not necessary.

2016-10-18 07:07:02	smrtz	Thanks everyone, but, just since now I'm curious, what's it called when you include the source for something and use that?  If using stdin wasn't the right solution would I say to 'impliment cat as a static library'?

2016-10-18 07:49:21	odapppi	k&R is the same as k&R2, and no it doesnt teach us how to print primes,etc, and multiply matrices, and use structures from a array usage
2016-10-18 07:49:24	twkm	a book like h&s doesn't try to teach it, but it is a nice reference from which at times you will learn some things you previously didn't know.

2016-10-18 09:03:08	atk	we use an XML parser which breaks if you have two XML entities (the &amp; &quot; nonsense) next to eachother, of if the second character of an attribute or text inside an element is a XML character entity.
2016-10-18 09:03:36	atk	So I was asked to escape the characters before they get passed to the XML generator and then unescape them when they get read by the XML parser
2016-10-18 09:03:48	latch	mmm bandaids
2016-10-18 09:04:12	atk	And this was insane already, I'm dumbfounded by how this XML parser has never had this shit reported.
2016-10-18 09:04:18	atk	But what came next was more insane,
2016-10-18 09:04:23	hypnopothesis	can't you just and some new regex to the parser seems simple in perl
2016-10-18 09:04:54	atk	I received a suggestion that for example ' should be escaped to _apos_ and & to _amp_ and was told I should use search and replace for each one

2016-10-18 09:38:29	latch	well assume you create an archive for source distribution of your program. you dont want git because thats a needless dependency. you should, however, use some kind of flow to create that source archive in the first place. you can write out a version file in this case when you create the source archive, and have your makefile switch to using that instead of a git command
2016-10-18 09:38:38	atk	a1b1: no, use a text editor like vim, much better

2016-10-18 10:33:22	cousteau	I guess this means that "all symbols on the linker stage refer to addresses, even the one you calculated arithmetically"
2016-10-18 10:33:29	atk	I had memcpy(&_sdata, &_flashdata, _ldata);
2016-10-18 10:33:44	atk	I don't even know why the first two had & until I noticed now
2016-10-18 10:33:56	atk	because I thought when I set things in the linker script and then refer to them, I'm referring to the values.

2016-10-18 10:35:25	cousteau	i.e. from C's point of view, _sdata and _edata are objects.  From the linker's point of view, they're "symbols", i.e. addresses, i.e. numbers.  Then you make another symbol (number) by subtracting them.  So from C's point of view, said symbol is just another object.

2016-10-18 12:36:20	latch	yeah there's generally a stack size limit in implementations
2016-10-18 12:36:38	latch	but VLA suffers the same fate
2016-10-18 12:36:51	latch	since its just automatic storage like alloca
2016-10-18 12:36:58	jasondockers	well, I mean it can fail and overrun my stack without me knowing
2016-10-18 12:37:13	jasondockers	so you should only allocate little bits of memory
2016-10-18 12:37:25	jasondockers	I guess VLA isn't better?
2016-10-18 12:37:30	nHeck	chrisf: i dont, but it exists no?
2016-10-18 12:37:54	chrisf	nHeck: no, both are required to be present.
2016-10-18 12:38:14	jasondockers	latch, never mind. I read your follow-up messages
2016-10-18 12:38:15	nHeck	oh, then it's just a matter of picking one é_è
2016-10-18 12:38:35	latch	well alloca is posix so VLA is more useful if you dont want that. And VLA performs better natively because it doesnt have to manually toy with your stack like alloca does :)
2016-10-18 12:38:46	latch	plus sizeof works
2016-10-18 12:39:57	chrisf	nHeck: what are you actually trying to do though?

2016-10-18 16:23:31	Stragus	Aww. I always, always use bitwise when possible
2016-10-18 16:23:40	jack_rabbit	That's silly. :)
2016-10-18 16:23:41	Hello71	if you never use networking or filesystem APIs and also do not alias pointers by char * then endianness does not matter in C
2016-10-18 16:24:00	eiku	I wasn’t suggesting we all use that (but I’m not going to argue about that since I’m very far from knowlegeable about low-level things)
2016-10-18 16:24:13	Hello71	twkm: the kernel does at least 1<<1, 1<<2, 1<<3 etc
2016-10-18 16:24:29	Stragus	If I see a foo / bar, I read that as an actual divide with a 42 cycles overhead. I want to see the actual operations being performed
2016-10-18 16:25:14	Hello71	one, I'm pretty sure integer division can be executed in parallel with other operations on typical x86 processors
2016-10-18 16:25:30	Stragus	Wrong
2016-10-18 16:25:31	Hello71	two, C already hides lots of platform-specific details
2016-10-18 16:25:33	twkm	to produce bit masks.
2016-10-18 16:26:25	Hello71	e.g. auto-vectorization (not technically C, but a property of C implementations that people actually use)
2016-10-18 16:26:55	twkm	eiku: the key is that however 010101 is written in memory the value is 010101.  only when writing the memory representation of it and that needs more than 1 byte does endian come into play.
2016-10-18 16:26:57	Stragus	I also do my own vectorization, SSE/AVX/NEON. Basically, I like my C as low-level as possible, and that means seeing what's a division and what's a shift
2016-10-18 16:27:29	nelder	hello, all, is anybody can help my with simple question... how gcc is know about syntax .c-file is it c++ or just C. for example this file https://paste.pound-python.org/show/ylPjxewimVrK6VtfdF3V/
2016-10-18 16:27:51	jack_rabbit	Shifting obfuscates meaning. Most programs are not CPU bound. Unless I show that my program is CPU bound and that shifting is going to improve things, I don't do it.
2016-10-18 16:27:57	jack_rabbit	(And I've never had to do it.)

2016-10-18 16:29:28	eiku	gcc compiles to C by default (afaik), and the g++ command compiles to c++ (I think)

2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:21:44] i'm not such a jerk [08:21:44]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	dminuoso_	[08:21:52] lionrouge: It is very common practice. [08:21:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	dminuoso_	[08:22:04] lionrouge: There's places where your commits dont go through audit unless they meet coding style guidelines. [08:22:04]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:22:12] it's not the case [08:22:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	dminuoso_	[08:22:15] Many OS projects will reject pull requests if the code looks shitty. [08:22:15]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:22:31] i can't make anyone involved to refactor it [08:22:31]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:22:57] and actually python' [08:22:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:23:05] autopep and go fmt are awesome [08:23:05]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:23:19] it's note about being stupid it's about readability and easiness to share code [08:23:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:23:28] no spaces holywars [08:23:28]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:24:20] looks like there is GNU indent and clang-format [08:24:20]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	pragma-	[08:24:38] and about 100 others [08:24:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:28:40] clang-format works gorgeous [08:28:40]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	pragma-	[08:29:41] "gorgeous" is subjective. I bet that I hate your styling choices. [08:29:41]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	pragma-	[08:31:01] I'm already pretty sure that I hate you.  You're submitting code that is not yours? [08:31:01]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	dminuoso_	[08:32:49] lionrouge: No the underlying issue is not lack of tools, its lack of enforced policies. [08:32:49]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	Maxdamantus	[08:34:57] Just use vim's copyindent (or something equivalent). [08:34:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	Maxdamantus	[08:35:13] There shouldn't be any controversy with that mechanism. [08:35:13]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	dminuoso_	[08:41:57] Maxdamantus: The issue is he wants to fix style from other people not following style guidelines. [08:41:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	avrdude	[08:44:42] why.. send the code back to them and tell them it's garbage [08:44:42]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:45:35] pragma-: i'm not submitting anything [08:45:35]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:45:38] it's not open-source [08:45:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:45:43] the code is legacy [08:45:43]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:45:52] peoples who made it are far away [08:45:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:46:35] and i simplify it dramatically because it's full of unnecessary generalisations [08:46:35]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:46:51] and when i copy parts of code i get a mess of indents [08:46:51]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	lionrouge	[08:46:59] that is my problem [08:46:59]
2016-10-18 23:55:20	c125	[09:02:29] I want to compile one .c file with other flags in the makefile [09:02:29]

2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:21:44] i'm not such a jerk [08:21:44]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	dminuoso_	[08:21:52] lionrouge: It is very common practice. [08:21:52]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	dminuoso_	[08:22:04] lionrouge: There's places where your commits dont go through audit unless they meet coding style guidelines. [08:22:04]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:22:12] it's not the case [08:22:12]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	dminuoso_	[08:22:15] Many OS projects will reject pull requests if the code looks shitty. [08:22:15]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:22:31] i can't make anyone involved to refactor it [08:22:31]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:22:57] and actually python' [08:22:57]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:23:05] autopep and go fmt are awesome [08:23:05]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:23:19] it's note about being stupid it's about readability and easiness to share code [08:23:19]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:23:28] no spaces holywars [08:23:28]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:24:20] looks like there is GNU indent and clang-format [08:24:20]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	pragma-	[08:24:38] and about 100 others [08:24:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:28:40] clang-format works gorgeous [08:28:40]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	pragma-	[08:29:41] "gorgeous" is subjective. I bet that I hate your styling choices. [08:29:41]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	pragma-	[08:31:01] I'm already pretty sure that I hate you.  You're submitting code that is not yours? [08:31:01]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	dminuoso_	[08:32:49] lionrouge: No the underlying issue is not lack of tools, its lack of enforced policies. [08:32:49]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	Maxdamantus	[08:34:57] Just use vim's copyindent (or something equivalent). [08:34:57]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	Maxdamantus	[08:35:13] There shouldn't be any controversy with that mechanism. [08:35:13]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	dminuoso_	[08:41:57] Maxdamantus: The issue is he wants to fix style from other people not following style guidelines. [08:41:57]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	avrdude	[08:44:42] why.. send the code back to them and tell them it's garbage [08:44:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:45:35] pragma-: i'm not submitting anything [08:45:35]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:45:38] it's not open-source [08:45:38]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:45:43] the code is legacy [08:45:43]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:45:52] peoples who made it are far away [08:45:52]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:46:35] and i simplify it dramatically because it's full of unnecessary generalisations [08:46:35]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:46:51] and when i copy parts of code i get a mess of indents [08:46:51]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	lionrouge	[08:46:59] that is my problem [08:46:59]
2016-10-19 00:41:18	c125	[09:02:29] I want to compile one .c file with other flags in the makefile [09:02:29]

2016-10-19 07:03:52	@candide	If you are using a C++ compiler then your code is not C -- even if you're only using the "C subset". As soon as you invoke a C++ compiler instead of a C compiler, all the rules and idiosyncrasies of the C++ specification come into play, which have subtle differences in certain semantics. Please ask ##c++ or switch to a C compiler.
2016-10-19 07:03:57	latch	ehhhhhh
2016-10-19 07:04:40	jmd	Sorry for the stupid question, but is "i ++" always going to do the same thing as "i++" ?

2016-10-19 10:27:25	@candide	Undefined behavior is behavior for which the C standard does not impose any requirements. This is to allow C the freedom to be implemented on systems with different architectures. Programs invoking undefined behavior may appear to compile and even run without errors at first, only to fail on another system, or even at a later time. If you want to write reliable code, don't use such behaviors.

2016-10-19 10:28:08	CaZe	Oops, I messed up the output indices.
2016-10-19 10:28:52	latch	basically you asked your implementation for 1 sizeof test and it gave you a bunch of memory (probably a page worth). its ub to use that memory, but probably wont segfault until you hit a page boundary. all of that is imp specific and undefined though
2016-10-19 10:28:53	CaZe	jasondockers: Yes, accessing out of bounds of an array invokes undefined behavior.

2016-10-19 10:29:24	jasondockers	CaZe, okay, so you're creating an array of pointers, assigning them to the address of `i`, and then printing them. shouldn't malloc be 100* sizeof *p
2016-10-19 10:29:28	CaZe	jasondockers: But the behavior is undefined. Saying that it "should fail" would actually be defining the behavior.

2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:22:52] I'm feeling stupid because I'm not sure of the distinction between FILE * and the integer file descriptions, like I get when I open pipe()s [00:22:52]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:23:03] Are they even close to interchangeable? [00:23:03]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:23:42] I've seen the word 'stream' and 'file' used differently in the POSIX specification, but not on the internet when I googled the problem, it seems the integers are files and the FILE * are streams [00:23:42]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:24:01] FILE * are the C standard library's handle for a file. File descriptors are unix/posix handles, not part of standard C. [00:24:01]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:25:04] They're not "interchangeable", but when you fopen a file in C on a posix system there will be a file descriptor "under the hood". See fileno(). [00:25:04]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:25:20] Mixing calls that deal with FILE * and calls that deal with file descriptors is likely to cause pain. [00:25:20]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:25:57] Ah, useful, thank you. So I could use fdopen() to get a FILE handler for my file descriptor, I think? [00:25:57]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	emg	[00:26:12] jl-: in the off chance you're actually interested, fixed version: http://ix.io/1xIR   now I want to use manhattan pair distance instead of just manhattan distance [00:26:12]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:26:21] http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fdopen.html is where I got that notion [00:26:21]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:26:22] Vaelatern: yes. [00:26:22]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:26:40] But you'd need a good reason to do that. [00:26:40]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:27:11] Okay, I guess reading from a pipe() isn't a good enough reason? [00:27:11]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:27:46] POSIX [obviously] has functions for reading using file descriptors. Compare read() and fread(). [00:27:46]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:28:35] So I'm not sure of the compelling reason to work with a FILE * if you're already using file descriptors. You've already lost the portability benefit as pipe() is not C. [00:28:35]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	takitus	[00:28:59] Vaelatern: If you need to use stdio with a pipe, that's a good reason to use fdopen(). [00:28:59]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:29:37] But what's the reason to "use stdio with a pipe"? [00:29:37]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:29:54] I couldn't find a C happy way to execute a command and get the output of that command without using pipe() [00:29:54]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:30:09] Vaelatern: indeed, standard C has no way to do that. [00:30:09]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:31:29] Slightly surprising, with the roots and UNIX and all [00:31:29]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	takitus	[00:31:52] Reading newline-delimited data with fgets() or getline(), I suppose. [00:31:52]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:32:01] Well, they recognised that not all systems could support such a thing. [00:32:01]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	NOPonPOP	[00:33:17] Vaelatern: does your command take any user supplied data? [00:33:17]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:33:21] Hm, could read() be used to read char by char? [00:33:21]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	takitus	[00:33:30] Vaelatern: POSIX has popen(), although it's inflexible [00:33:30]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:33:34] NOPonPOP: No, but the program specifies the flags used [00:33:34]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Chris	[00:33:37] Vaelatern: yes, inefficiently. [00:33:37]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	NOPonPOP	[00:34:15] Vaelatern: ah, ive gotten in the habit of letting other binaries i invoke write output to a file and read it after i see system() or fork/exec is fine [00:34:15]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	Vaelatern	[00:34:19] I guess the RightWay to read from a buffer would be to fill up a char array and copy it over 80 chars at the time [00:34:19]
2016-10-19 14:34:37	***	Playback Complete.
2016-10-19 14:34:42	NOPonPOP	Vaelatern: ideally you wold read more than 1 byte at a time, but you certainly can.

2016-10-19 14:43:47	seanrdev	Hey is there a library that can help me count by a certain base? For example if I wanted to count by 6. In the ones place the highest number would be 6 then in the tens place I would have 16. So... 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,20, etc.
