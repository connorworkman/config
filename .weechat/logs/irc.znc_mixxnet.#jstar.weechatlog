2016-10-31 16:20:57	@holly	[05:19:50] so cold in the D [05:19:50]
2016-10-31 16:20:57	*buffextras	[05:51:14] D2T!~D2T@d2t.users.mixxnet.net is now known as D2T-away [05:51:14]
2016-10-31 16:20:57	@metalfrog	[07:42:53] 2.5 hours later... [07:42:53]
2016-10-31 16:20:57	@Sub-Zero	[07:45:36] 2.5? not 2.5001? [07:45:36]
2016-10-31 16:20:57	@metalfrog	[07:50:45] Got my paycheck  [07:50:45]
2016-10-31 16:20:57	@metalfrog	[07:51:04] I have paid like 30k in taxes this year [07:51:04]
2016-10-31 16:20:57	@metalfrog	[07:51:17] And I was on maternity leave 2 months [07:51:17]
2016-10-31 16:20:57	@Sub-Zero	[07:54:10] thank you for your contribution, comrade.. but if you truly care, you'll elect to donate another 30k as an investment in our future! [07:54:10]
2016-10-31 16:20:57	@Sub-Zero	[07:54:28] remember, as obama said, taxes are investments! [07:54:28]
2016-10-31 16:20:57	@metalfrog	[07:55:19] I guess the money hasn't hit my bank yet [07:55:19]
2016-10-31 16:20:57	@metalfrog	[08:02:38] Then daycare takes all my money [08:02:38]
2016-10-31 16:20:57	@Sub-Zero	[08:03:17] that's because daycare evolved from being a couple of babysitters watching a bunch of kids to a full blown healthcare service center. [08:03:17]
2016-10-31 16:20:57	@metalfrog	[10:35:34] That sends them home when they are sick [10:35:34]

2016-10-31 16:20:57	D2T	[17:25:29] daycare is supposed to be a room of a bunch of sick kids so they all build immunities [17:25:29]
2016-10-31 16:20:57	D2T	[17:25:43] thats why my older brother never missed a day of school K-12 [17:25:43]
2016-10-31 16:20:57	D2T	[17:25:59] I dont think he ever gets sick [17:25:59]
2016-10-31 16:20:57	D2T	[17:26:07] but apparently he was sick 24/7 as a kid from daycare [17:26:07]
