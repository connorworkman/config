2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:19:40] i think so [01:19:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:19:44] this is schizophrenic [01:19:44]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:19:47] depends on your sed [01:19:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:20:00] how do I get a sed that follows regex properly? [01:20:00]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:20:20] so i can not be doing weird special forms of regex that dont line up with the docs [01:20:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:20:20] theres no such thing as a proper regex [01:20:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:20:33] theres standard, basic, extended, perl [01:20:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:20:39] im probably wrong on one there [01:20:39]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:21:08] either way, that example i gave works [01:21:08]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:21:28] right that works for -that- example [01:21:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:21:33] but lets say i wanted to do an ip address [01:21:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:21:36] thats not good [01:21:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:22:12] (\d{1,3}\.){1,3} or such wont be possible if sed is weird like this [01:22:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:23:04] am i looking for extended? [01:23:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:23:08] yes [01:23:08]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:23:16] im gonna wait for someone else to answer [01:23:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:25:13] but you can do \d\d?\d?\.\d\d? etc [01:25:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:26:12] which is still a terrible solution because ip's only go to 255 [01:26:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:27:07] and i dont think \d works even, you have to do [0-9] [01:27:07]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:27:17] why doesn't \d work? [01:27:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	 *	Phanes [01:27:22] doublechecks the regex doc [01:27:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:27:30] idk, i'm confusing it with awk [01:27:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:27:31] yep, \d is there and doesn't work [01:27:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:27:40] wtf [01:27:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:27:45] oh, i was right [01:27:45]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:28:01] old extended regex doesnt have \d, but gnu sed should have it [01:28:01]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:28:18] i dont understand why this is a thing [01:28:18]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:30:32] standardized tools are impossible to change [01:30:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:35:02] they say perl is better at everything [01:35:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:35:25] and sam is definitely better than sed [01:35:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	yitz	[01:41:12] sed got [[:digit:]] but not \d AFAIK [01:41:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	yitz	[01:41:38] \d isn't found in many regexes [01:41:38]

2016-10-18 00:14:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:02:56] I am not completely sure why echo 'hey' | sed 's/\n//g' doesn't remove the newline. I read in the info page that sed adds a newline back to output if there was one in the input. [10:02:56]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:03:26] Is echo 'hey'<RET> causing sed to see two input lines? [10:03:26]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:08:30] So, sed is removing the '\n' from the input, and that is why I can't remove it myself. [10:08:30]

2016-10-18 05:37:48	Riviera	Fernando-Basso: wasn't so much about emacs, rather about learning something more general first before bothering with extremely specialised tools as sed. :)
2016-10-18 05:38:11	Fernando-Basso	I can't deny your are right.
2016-10-18 05:38:59	Fernando-Basso	When I first met linux and open source / free software (I never know what to call this whole thing) I fell in love with command line things.
2016-10-18 05:39:40	Fernando-Basso	That probably touched me in a way that is stronger than reason.

2016-10-18 23:55:22	nal	[02:21:35] maybe? [02:21:35]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	yitz	[02:22:53] No [02:22:53]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	yitz	[02:22:59] - isn't a digit [02:22:59]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	nal	[02:28:43] welp, obsd was talking about removing any other localed other than utf8 and C... [02:28:43]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	nal	[02:29:32] and you're right, i kind of noticed 10 seconds after sending but was too lazy to say anything [02:29:32]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Soliton	[07:50:35] Phanes: sed uses basic regular expressions. if you want sed to understand your regex you should, too. [07:50:35]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:02:56] I am not completely sure why echo 'hey' | sed 's/\n//g' doesn't remove the newline. I read in the info page that sed adds a newline back to output if there was one in the input. [10:02:56]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:03:26] Is echo 'hey'<RET> causing sed to see two input lines? [10:03:26]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:08:30] So, sed is removing the '\n' from the input, and that is why I can't remove it myself. [10:08:30]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	go|dfish	[10:19:00] indeed [10:19:00]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:22:45] Also, I now got confused because of the pipes. I did RET not after echo 'hey', but after the pipe and the sed command. [10:22:45]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:23:12] Does RET apply to the echo command as well? [10:23:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:23:29] (gnu sed has -z) [10:23:29]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[11:34:19] Fernando-Basso: With RET you mean hitting the enter key, telling the shell to execute the current command line? [11:34:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[11:41:38] Yep. [11:41:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[11:51:03] Fernando-Basso: That is only relevant for the shell, making it execute the commands. [11:51:03]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[11:51:20] Fernando-Basso: It does not influence sed or echo or any other command, nor do they read it as their input. [11:51:20]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[11:55:15] Riviera: I see, "they don't read it as their input". I was thinking that they did, perhaps under the influence of C (which reads your RET presses as well when using certain functions). [11:55:15]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[11:55:34] Fernando-Basso: C is a programming language, it is not involved here. [11:55:34]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[11:56:07] :D [11:56:07]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[11:56:10] Fernando-Basso: I don't really know what to say, these are severe misconceptions that you have. [11:56:10]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[11:59:35] Unfortunately, yes... [11:59:35]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[12:01:52] You should have listened to me, then. :) [12:01:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[12:02:01] When I told you what to learn. :P [12:02:01]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[12:02:46] I did not even start those yet. [12:02:46]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[12:33:50] Fernando-Basso: Exactly, because sed (and friends) stand in your way. :) [12:33:50]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[12:35:57] Riviera: I haven't (yet) lost hope that I will eventually learn some of this stuff. [12:35:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	waldner	[12:41:47] echo adds a newline at the end, so sed really sees 'hey\n' as input [12:41:47]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	waldner	[12:42:28] regardless of where you hit enter [12:42:28]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[12:47:57] waldner: But then seds removes the new line when reading it into pattern space, no? [12:47:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	waldner	[12:48:07] yes [12:48:07]

2016-10-19 00:41:22	Soliton	[10:36:43] just using an xml parser seems easier. ;-) [10:36:43]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:37:15] That is true. [10:37:15]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:38:21] Once I made a small C program that gets ftp configuration from (argh) dreamweaver exported xml files. [10:38:21]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:01] I worked in a place where my boss would refuse to give me ftp access to upload site data. He insisted in only giving me the dw config, which has "encrypted" password. [10:39:01]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:18] In C I used a libxml something. [10:39:18]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:56] (he wanted me to use dreamweaver as well) [10:39:56]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:40:23] Then I made a nodejs version of the small program and used a regex to extract the password field. [10:40:23]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:40:42] I really don't think for very simple things like this it hurts that much to use the wrong tool for the job. [10:40:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Soliton	[10:40:54] so xml was the encryption? [10:40:54]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:41:00] Nope. [10:41:00]

2016-10-19 14:34:39	Soliton	[10:36:43] just using an xml parser seems easier. ;-) [10:36:43]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:37:15] That is true. [10:37:15]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:38:21] Once I made a small C program that gets ftp configuration from (argh) dreamweaver exported xml files. [10:38:21]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:01] I worked in a place where my boss would refuse to give me ftp access to upload site data. He insisted in only giving me the dw config, which has "encrypted" password. [10:39:01]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:18] In C I used a libxml something. [10:39:18]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:56] (he wanted me to use dreamweaver as well) [10:39:56]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:40:23] Then I made a nodejs version of the small program and used a regex to extract the password field. [10:40:23]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:40:42] I really don't think for very simple things like this it hurts that much to use the wrong tool for the job. [10:40:42]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Soliton	[10:40:54] so xml was the encryption? [10:40:54]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:41:00] Nope. [10:41:00]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Soliton	[10:41:29] sounded to me like it was clear text in the xml. [10:41:29]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:41:35] It was something like pw="6774766C3537393B3B3F" [10:41:35]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Soliton	[10:41:45] ah, hex encoded. [10:41:45]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:41:52] Inside a <server> xml tag. [10:41:52]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:41:54] Yep. [10:41:54]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:42:10] There is an algorithm on the web to undo that hex thing. [10:42:10]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:42:26] (I just translated it to C/js) [10:42:26]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:44:35] That is dreamwever concept of securing passwords. [10:44:35]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	stevenm	[13:34:14] hey can I get an opinion before I run something... should this result in a single forward slash being in the replace string? [13:34:14]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	stevenm	[13:34:16] sed 's/password=.*/password='yhBv\\\/psyyoEAU'/' [13:34:16]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	stevenm	[13:34:43] the yhBv\\\/psyyoEAU     is actually variable   $tohash  but i've done it this way to show the content [13:34:43]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	stevenm	[13:35:05] tohash generated this way...   tohash=$(perl -e'print crypt("'$topass'", "'$(tr -cd 'a-zA-Z0-9./'</dev/urandom|head -c2)'")'|sed 's/\//\\\\\\\//g') [13:35:05]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Soliton	[13:42:40] might be easier to explain what you're trying to do so someone can write a sane solution. [13:42:40]

2016-10-20 00:25:32	Soliton	[10:36:43] just using an xml parser seems easier. ;-) [10:36:43]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:37:15] That is true. [10:37:15]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:38:21] Once I made a small C program that gets ftp configuration from (argh) dreamweaver exported xml files. [10:38:21]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:01] I worked in a place where my boss would refuse to give me ftp access to upload site data. He insisted in only giving me the dw config, which has "encrypted" password. [10:39:01]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:18] In C I used a libxml something. [10:39:18]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:56] (he wanted me to use dreamweaver as well) [10:39:56]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:40:23] Then I made a nodejs version of the small program and used a regex to extract the password field. [10:40:23]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:40:42] I really don't think for very simple things like this it hurts that much to use the wrong tool for the job. [10:40:42]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Soliton	[10:40:54] so xml was the encryption? [10:40:54]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:41:00] Nope. [10:41:00]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Soliton	[10:41:29] sounded to me like it was clear text in the xml. [10:41:29]

2016-10-20 23:32:36	watmm	Hey, wondering which is more performant for replacing a line if it exists, else inserting said line - perl or sed?
2016-10-20 23:34:27	go|dfish	tsakos: what operation
2016-10-20 23:35:20	go|dfish	watmm: you would probably have to benchmark it
2016-10-20 23:35:59	watmm	go|dfish: problem is, tmtowtdi
2016-10-20 23:36:16	tsakos	go|dfish: /pattern1/,/pattern2/
2016-10-20 23:36:33	tsakos	go|dfish: sed -n '/pattern1/,/pattern2/p'
2016-10-20 23:37:28	tsakos	I'm trying to extract some html.. pattern2 goes way beyond my pattern, shouldn't just print the first pattern it reaches?
2016-10-20 23:37:28		[23:37]
2016-10-20 23:38:03	tsakos	basically I piped sed into cat -v - just now
2016-10-20 23:38:08	tsakos	output looks weird
2016-10-20 23:38:10	go|dfish	tsakos: it should. http://bpaste.net/raw/531ac64af470
2016-10-20 23:38:27	go|dfish	perhaps it's simpler if you show your data and what you're trying to extract
2016-10-20 23:38:48	tsakos	it's a wikipedia page xD
2016-10-20 23:38:58	go|dfish	{terz}
2016-10-20 23:39:21	tsakos	well, maybe I have some problem with UTF?
2016-10-20 23:39:24	go|dfish	perhaps there are multiple instances of pattern1 and pattern2 - so your range is matching multiple times
2016-10-20 23:39:31	tsakos	ah
2016-10-20 23:39:39	tsakos	yeah, that would be a possibility
2016-10-20 23:40:01	tsakos	so, I can do /pattern1/,/pattern2/pq ?
2016-10-20 23:40:08	tsakos	and just print the first match?
2016-10-20 23:40:41	go|dfish	well one way would be to write it as /pattern1/,/pattern2/{ /pattern2/q; p; }
2016-10-20 23:41:08	go|dfish	well, the p first if you want to print the pattern2 line
2016-10-20 23:41:38	tsakos	aha, cool
2016-10-20 23:41:45	tsakos	thanks a lot!
2016-10-20 23:47:00		[23:41]
2016-10-20 23:47:59	tsakos	well, looks like there is a problem with sed and UTF
2016-10-20 23:48:25	tsakos	it prints non-sense characters like ^M and stuff
2016-10-20 23:48:49	tsakos	but if you pipe sed's output into tee, it works on terminal screen + file
2016-10-20 23:49:19	tsakos	that's why I had problems greping some content also -_-
2016-10-20 23:53:18	Soliton	^M is a carriage return. not really non-sense. presumably you're working with files with windows line endings.
2016-10-20 23:59:00		[23:53]
2016-10-21 00:04:15	tsakos	No, there is not carriage return characters
2016-10-21 00:04:51	tsakos	sed just interprets the stream wrong, I don't know if there is a problem with my UTF setup... locale reports everything UTF-8
2016-10-21 00:05:25	tsakos	grep prints matched lines ok
2016-10-21 00:05:39	tsakos	if I do sed | grep, grep does not print anything
2016-10-21 00:05:46	tsakos	I also verified that with cat -v -
2016-10-21 00:06:09	tsakos	the stream is not the same with the original source file
2016-10-21 00:07:13	Soliton	# printf 'abc\r\n'; printf 'abc\r\n' | cat -v
2016-10-21 00:07:15	shbot	Soliton: abc
2016-10-21 00:07:15	shbot	Soliton: abc^M
2016-10-21 00:07:23	tsakos	Soliton: I know
2016-10-21 00:07:41	tsakos	I have done many many scripts :)
2016-10-21 00:07:55	tsakos	maybe too many haha
2016-10-21 00:08:45	Soliton	well, impossible to say anything as long as you're just making weird claims about bogus ^M characters and utf8 issues without showing anything.
2016-10-21 00:09:10	tsakos	Well, I can show misintrepreted characters
2016-10-21 00:09:19	tsakos	I don't think that makes any sense at all
2016-10-21 00:11:11	tsakos	hmm, ok, I was wrong
2016-10-21 00:11:21	tsakos	cat -v was reporting weird characters
2016-10-21 00:11:50	tsakos	but still, I cannot match something with grep after sed has processed the stream

2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:39:21] well, maybe I have some problem with UTF? [09:39:21]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	go|dfish	[09:39:24] perhaps there are multiple instances of pattern1 and pattern2 - so your range is matching multiple times [09:39:24]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:39:31] ah [09:39:31]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:39:39] yeah, that would be a possibility [09:39:39]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:40:01] so, I can do /pattern1/,/pattern2/pq ? [09:40:01]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:40:08] and just print the first match? [09:40:08]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	go|dfish	[09:40:41] well one way would be to write it as /pattern1/,/pattern2/{ /pattern2/q; p; } [09:40:41]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	go|dfish	[09:41:08] well, the p first if you want to print the pattern2 line [09:41:08]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:41:38] aha, cool [09:41:38]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:41:45] thanks a lot! [09:41:45]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:47:59] well, looks like there is a problem with sed and UTF [09:47:59]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:48:25] it prints non-sense characters like ^M and stuff [09:48:25]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:48:49] but if you pipe sed's output into tee, it works on terminal screen + file [09:48:49]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:49:19] that's why I had problems greping some content also -_- [09:49:19]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	Soliton	[09:53:18] ^M is a carriage return. not really non-sense. presumably you're working with files with windows line endings. [09:53:18]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:04:15] No, there is not carriage return characters [10:04:15]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:04:51] sed just interprets the stream wrong, I don't know if there is a problem with my UTF setup... locale reports everything UTF-8 [10:04:51]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:05:25] grep prints matched lines ok [10:05:25]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:05:39] if I do sed | grep, grep does not print anything [10:05:39]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:05:46] I also verified that with cat -v - [10:05:46]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:06:09] the stream is not the same with the original source file [10:06:09]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	Soliton	[10:07:13] # printf 'abc\r\n'; printf 'abc\r\n' | cat -v [10:07:13]

2016-10-24 22:59:38	shbot	[10:07:15] Soliton: abc^M [10:07:15]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:07:23] Soliton: I know [10:07:23]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:07:41] I have done many many scripts :) [10:07:41]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:07:55] maybe too many haha [10:07:55]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	Soliton	[10:08:45] well, impossible to say anything as long as you're just making weird claims about bogus ^M characters and utf8 issues without showing anything. [10:08:45]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:09:10] Well, I can show misintrepreted characters [10:09:10]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:09:19] I don't think that makes any sense at all [10:09:19]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:11:11] hmm, ok, I was wrong [10:11:11]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:11:21] cat -v was reporting weird characters [10:11:21]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:11:50] but still, I cannot match something with grep after sed has processed the stream [10:11:50]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	Soliton	[10:12:45] show your actual input and maybe someone can help. [10:12:45]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:16:15] Ok, found where the problem is lying [10:16:15]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:16:35] thanks for your time anyway :) [10:16:35]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:17:58] sometimes you have re-think what you are doing before making assumptions xD [10:17:58]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	Soliton	[10:29:15] that's why it is always better to show what you're actually doing because then other people are actually able to verify your assumptions. [10:29:15]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[11:01:03] forgetting -n in cat (first command) was enough for grep to not match '^<ul>' ;) [11:01:03]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[11:01:28] that was my problem, didn't fixed yet... gone for a break as it was needed xD [11:01:28]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[11:01:37] fixed it* [11:01:37]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	watmm	[16:20:02] I'd like to print three lines from a file that are right after each other, and each line contains a different specific word. [16:20:02]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	Soliton	[16:28:15] ok. [16:28:15]

2016-10-25 05:44:48	Petter	Hm, for literally delete from one pattern to the last of another pattern. Here's what I came up with:
2016-10-25 05:44:57	Petter	# printf '%s\n' normal1 del-start del-stop1 normal2 del-stop2 normal3  |  sed -n '/del-start/{ :a; n; /del-stop/!ba; n; :b; N; $!bb; s/.*\n[^\n]*del-stop[^\n]*\n//; }; p;'
2016-10-25 05:44:59	shbot	Petter: normal1
2016-10-25 05:44:59	shbot	Petter: normal3
2016-10-25 05:45:26	Petter	Note though, that at some point it buffers of the rest of the input stream.
2016-10-25 05:47:00	Petter	If the task is rather to delete to the second end pattern it's not necessary to buffer up.
2016-10-25 05:47:09	Petter	# printf '%s\n' normal1 del-start del-stop1 normal2 del-stop2 normal3  | sed -n '/del-start/{ :a; n; /del-stop/!ba; :b; n; //!bb; d; }; p;'
2016-10-25 05:47:10	shbot	Petter: normal1
2016-10-25 05:47:10	shbot	Petter: normal3
2016-10-25 05:48:31	Petter	The first one is GNU sed only because of [^\n]* (at least).

2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:07:23] Soliton: I know [10:07:23]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:07:41] I have done many many scripts :) [10:07:41]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:07:55] maybe too many haha [10:07:55]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Soliton	[10:08:45] well, impossible to say anything as long as you're just making weird claims about bogus ^M characters and utf8 issues without showing anything. [10:08:45]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:09:10] Well, I can show misintrepreted characters [10:09:10]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:09:19] I don't think that makes any sense at all [10:09:19]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:11:11] hmm, ok, I was wrong [10:11:11]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:11:21] cat -v was reporting weird characters [10:11:21]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:11:50] but still, I cannot match something with grep after sed has processed the stream [10:11:50]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Soliton	[10:12:45] show your actual input and maybe someone can help. [10:12:45]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:16:15] Ok, found where the problem is lying [10:16:15]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:16:35] thanks for your time anyway :) [10:16:35]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:17:58] sometimes you have re-think what you are doing before making assumptions xD [10:17:58]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Soliton	[10:29:15] that's why it is always better to show what you're actually doing because then other people are actually able to verify your assumptions. [10:29:15]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[11:01:03] forgetting -n in cat (first command) was enough for grep to not match '^<ul>' ;) [11:01:03]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[11:01:28] that was my problem, didn't fixed yet... gone for a break as it was needed xD [11:01:28]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[11:01:37] fixed it* [11:01:37]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	watmm	[16:20:02] I'd like to print three lines from a file that are right after each other, and each line contains a different specific word. [16:20:02]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Soliton	[16:28:15] ok. [16:28:15]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Petter	[16:28:54] Hehe. [16:28:54]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Petter	[16:52:49] watmm: Is this something you are working on currently? Is it going alright? [16:52:49]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Nimitz14	[15:18:15] #awk [15:18:15]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	izalove	[15:34:04] yeah [15:34:04]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	saml	[14:55:18] how can I delete lines between a line that matches a pattern  and another line that matches different pattern? [14:55:18]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	gnomon	[15:02:29] saml, like so: printf '%s\n' {1..20} | sed -e '/^7$/,/^12$/d' [15:02:29]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	saml	[15:06:11] thanks.  looks like the end line pattern, ^12$ is repeating twice in the input stream.. so I want to delete from first match of ^7$  to last match of ^12$ [15:06:11]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Petter	[15:44:48] Hm, for literally delete from one pattern to the last of another pattern. Here's what I came up with: [15:44:48]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Petter	[15:44:57] # printf '%s\n' normal1 del-start del-stop1 normal2 del-stop2 normal3  |  sed -n '/del-start/{ :a; n; /del-stop/!ba; n; :b; N; $!bb; s/.*\n[^\n]*del-stop[^\n]*\n//; }; p;' [15:44:57]

2016-10-25 11:42:06	shbot	[15:44:59] Petter: normal3 [15:44:59]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Petter	[15:45:26] Note though, that at some point it buffers of the rest of the input stream. [15:45:26]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Petter	[15:47:00] If the task is rather to delete to the second end pattern it's not necessary to buffer up. [15:47:00]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Petter	[15:47:09] # printf '%s\n' normal1 del-start del-stop1 normal2 del-stop2 normal3  | sed -n '/del-start/{ :a; n; /del-stop/!ba; :b; n; //!bb; d; }; p;' [15:47:09]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	shbot	[15:47:10] Petter: normal1 [15:47:10]

2016-10-25 13:49:45	tsakos	[10:17:58] sometimes you have re-think what you are doing before making assumptions xD [10:17:58]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	Soliton	[10:29:15] that's why it is always better to show what you're actually doing because then other people are actually able to verify your assumptions. [10:29:15]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	tsakos	[11:01:03] forgetting -n in cat (first command) was enough for grep to not match '^<ul>' ;) [11:01:03]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	tsakos	[11:01:28] that was my problem, didn't fixed yet... gone for a break as it was needed xD [11:01:28]

2016-10-25 13:49:45	gnomon	[15:02:29] saml, like so: printf '%s\n' {1..20} | sed -e '/^7$/,/^12$/d' [15:02:29]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	saml	[15:06:11] thanks.  looks like the end line pattern, ^12$ is repeating twice in the input stream.. so I want to delete from first match of ^7$  to last match of ^12$ [15:06:11]
2016-10-25 13:49:45	Petter	[15:44:48] Hm, for literally delete from one pattern to the last of another pattern. Here's what I came up with: [15:44:48]

2016-10-25 17:57:02	tsakos	[10:09:19] I don't think that makes any sense at all [10:09:19]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	tsakos	[10:11:11] hmm, ok, I was wrong [10:11:11]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	tsakos	[10:11:21] cat -v was reporting weird characters [10:11:21]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	tsakos	[10:11:50] but still, I cannot match something with grep after sed has processed the stream [10:11:50]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Soliton	[10:12:45] show your actual input and maybe someone can help. [10:12:45]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	tsakos	[10:16:15] Ok, found where the problem is lying [10:16:15]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	tsakos	[10:16:35] thanks for your time anyway :) [10:16:35]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	tsakos	[10:17:58] sometimes you have re-think what you are doing before making assumptions xD [10:17:58]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Soliton	[10:29:15] that's why it is always better to show what you're actually doing because then other people are actually able to verify your assumptions. [10:29:15]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	tsakos	[11:01:03] forgetting -n in cat (first command) was enough for grep to not match '^<ul>' ;) [11:01:03]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	tsakos	[11:01:28] that was my problem, didn't fixed yet... gone for a break as it was needed xD [11:01:28]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	tsakos	[11:01:37] fixed it* [11:01:37]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	watmm	[16:20:02] I'd like to print three lines from a file that are right after each other, and each line contains a different specific word. [16:20:02]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Soliton	[16:28:15] ok. [16:28:15]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Petter	[16:28:54] Hehe. [16:28:54]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Petter	[16:52:49] watmm: Is this something you are working on currently? Is it going alright? [16:52:49]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Nimitz14	[15:18:15] #awk [15:18:15]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	izalove	[15:34:04] yeah [15:34:04]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	saml	[14:55:18] how can I delete lines between a line that matches a pattern  and another line that matches different pattern? [14:55:18]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	gnomon	[15:02:29] saml, like so: printf '%s\n' {1..20} | sed -e '/^7$/,/^12$/d' [15:02:29]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	saml	[15:06:11] thanks.  looks like the end line pattern, ^12$ is repeating twice in the input stream.. so I want to delete from first match of ^7$  to last match of ^12$ [15:06:11]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Petter	[15:44:48] Hm, for literally delete from one pattern to the last of another pattern. Here's what I came up with: [15:44:48]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Petter	[15:44:57] # printf '%s\n' normal1 del-start del-stop1 normal2 del-stop2 normal3  |  sed -n '/del-start/{ :a; n; /del-stop/!ba; n; :b; N; $!bb; s/.*\n[^\n]*del-stop[^\n]*\n//; }; p;' [15:44:57]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	shbot	[15:44:59] Petter: normal1 [15:44:59]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	shbot	[15:44:59] Petter: normal3 [15:44:59]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Petter	[15:45:26] Note though, that at some point it buffers of the rest of the input stream. [15:45:26]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Petter	[15:47:00] If the task is rather to delete to the second end pattern it's not necessary to buffer up. [15:47:00]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Petter	[15:47:09] # printf '%s\n' normal1 del-start del-stop1 normal2 del-stop2 normal3  | sed -n '/del-start/{ :a; n; /del-stop/!ba; :b; n; //!bb; d; }; p;' [15:47:09]

2016-10-25 17:57:02	shbot	[15:47:10] Petter: normal3 [15:47:10]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Petter	[15:48:31] The first one is GNU sed only because of [^\n]* (at least). [15:48:31]

2016-10-25 17:57:02	Phanes	[02:39:09] weird question but why doesn't this work? [02:39:09]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Phanes	[02:39:21] strace -p $(ps ax | grep bash | grep -v grep | head -n 1 | awk '{ print $1;}') 2>&1 | grep "read(0, \"" | sed 's/r/g/g;' [02:39:21]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Phanes	[02:40:13] it seems when redirecting stderr to stdout from strace, that grep will work but sed does not [02:40:13]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Phanes	[02:47:26] strace -p $(ps ax | grep bash | grep -v grep | head -n 1 | awk '{ print $1;}') 2>&1 | grep "read(0, \"" 2>&1 | sed 's/read(0, \"//g;s/\".*$//g;' [02:47:26]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Phanes	[02:47:31] ^ does not work either [02:47:31]
2016-10-25 17:57:02	Phanes	[02:47:37] but the grep does if i remove the pipe to sed [02:47:37]

2016-10-25 23:10:30	rexwin_	how to accomplish this change using sed

2016-10-25 23:16:53	rexwin_	how to then edit the file on the fly?
2016-10-25 23:16:54	dwts	maybe you need to use the -i option to replace inside the file. Not sure if -i is supported in all sed implementations though
2016-10-25 23:17:05	Soliton	with ed, as i showed above.
2016-10-25 23:18:14	han-solo	sed '4s/hcltech/infy/w newfile' < oldfile;mv newfile oldfile
2016-10-25 23:18:24	han-solo	err, a little long

Btw looking at how the file actually looks, it seems I no longer need to replace Unix New Line " Unix New Line " with " Unix New Line but just CR (can't remember the code) which I think was Windows new line with nothing (not null byte, I just want to remove it from the file)

2016-10-26 00:54:59	Petter	Think you would need \r, and not \\r in the pattern.
2016-10-26 00:55:00	_val_	it does create a backup file in-place
2016-10-26 00:55:36	_val_	Petter: but we need to excape the metachar right?
2016-10-26 00:56:10	ifohancroft	_val_ it seems it doesn't, I get .bak at the end of the line after the unix new line character

2016-10-26 00:57:42	ifohancroft	btw Petter is right, it seems to work with sed 's/\r//g' btw is it possible to do the replacement in place instead of outputting it to stdout or another file
2016-10-26 00:58:08	Petter	You don't need the 'g' unless you have multiple carriage returns in one line.

2016-10-26 01:00:35	ifohancroft	_val_ even without including it, just doing sed 's/\r//' test.csv I get the result instead of it being written to test.csv
2016-10-26 01:01:05	_val_	ifohancroft: but that will only display the result on your screen and won't write it to a file
2016-10-26 01:01:29	Petter	_val_: with echo you should use the -e switch to make \r a carriage return.
2016-10-26 01:01:40	ifohancroft	That's what I mean, I want the editing/replacing to be done in place
2016-10-26 01:02:00	_val_	:/
2016-10-26 01:02:02	han-solo	use the '-i' option, not standard though
2016-10-26 01:02:05	_val_	ifohancroft: just use -i
2016-10-26 01:02:41	ifohancroft	thank you _val_ and han-solo (nice nickname btw) that seems to be working
2016-10-26 01:03:53	ifohancroft	btw when doing sed -n l file I see \ is this sed breaking the line to be shorter?
2016-10-26 01:06:00	Petter	Yes.
2016-10-26 01:07:29	Petter	You could give it an argument as well, to wrap at different lengths.

2016-10-26 01:10:57	Petter	At least in GNU sed.
2016-10-26 01:12:34	ifohancroft	Is there a place where you can see differences between standard sed vs GNU sed or if there are other flavours/variants as well or the only way is the documentation

2016-10-26 01:23:43	Soliton	ifohancroft: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sed.html that's the posix specification. for what some specific variant supports you need to check its documentation.

2016-10-26 01:26:39	Petter	To edit files in place, you should use an editor. Like ed.

2016-10-26 09:43:39	_val_	[11:01:05] ifohancroft: but that will only display the result on your screen and won't write it to a file [11:01:05]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Petter	[11:01:29] _val_: with echo you should use the -e switch to make \r a carriage return. [11:01:29]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	ifohancroft	[11:01:40] That's what I mean, I want the editing/replacing to be done in place [11:01:40]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	_val_	[11:02:00] :/ [11:02:00]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	han-solo	[11:02:02] use the '-i' option, not standard though [11:02:02]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	_val_	[11:02:05] ifohancroft: just use -i [11:02:05]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	ifohancroft	[11:02:41] thank you _val_ and han-solo (nice nickname btw) that seems to be working [11:02:41]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	ifohancroft	[11:03:53] btw when doing sed -n l file I see \ is this sed breaking the line to be shorter? [11:03:53]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Petter	[11:06:00] Yes. [11:06:00]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Petter	[11:07:29] You could give it an argument as well, to wrap at different lengths. [11:07:29]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Petter	[11:08:19] # printf '%s\n' 'looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong line' | sed -n 'l 20' [11:08:19]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	shbot1	[11:08:20] Petter: loooooooooooooooooo\ [11:08:20]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	shbot1	[11:08:20] Petter: ooooooooooooooong l\ [11:08:20]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	shbot1	[11:08:20] Petter: ine$ [11:08:20]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Petter	[11:10:38] Looks like you can disable wrapping with 0. [11:10:38]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Petter	[11:10:57] At least in GNU sed. [11:10:57]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	ifohancroft	[11:12:34] Is there a place where you can see differences between standard sed vs GNU sed or if there are other flavours/variants as well or the only way is the documentation [11:12:34]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Soliton	[11:23:43] ifohancroft: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sed.html that's the posix specification. for what some specific variant supports you need to check its documentation. [11:23:43]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	ifohancroft	[11:24:12] Thank you, Soliton. [11:24:12]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Petter	[11:26:39] To edit files in place, you should use an editor. Like ed. [11:26:39]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Petter	[11:28:39] # printf 'foo\r\n' > crfile;   printf '%s\n' '%s/^M//' w | ed -s crfile;   sed -n l crfile [11:28:39]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	shbot1	[11:28:40] Petter: ? [11:28:40]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	shbot1	[11:28:40] Petter: foo\r$ [11:28:40]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Petter	[11:28:51] Ops. [11:28:51]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Petter	[11:30:21] Oh, I think my copy-paste don't work with ^M. To get ^M in the pattern, use Ctrl+v Ctrl+m. [11:30:21]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Petter	[11:31:06] Ed doesn't seem to work with \r. At least I can't get it to. [11:31:06]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Soliton	[11:31:43] # printf 'foo\r\n' > crfile;   printf '%s\n' $'%s/\r//' w | ed -s crfile;   sed -n l crfile [11:31:43]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	shbot1	[11:31:44] Soliton: foo$ [11:31:44]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Petter	[11:32:04] Nice! Didn't think of that. [11:32:04]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Petter	[11:32:32] That's a Bash thing though, or? [11:32:32]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Soliton	[11:33:21] yes. [11:33:21]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Soliton	[11:33:36] ed sees a literal \r. [11:33:36]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	geirha	[11:46:12] soon to be an sh thing [11:46:12]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Riviera	[12:53:32] Or just let printf do everything. [12:53:32]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Petter	[12:58:40] # printf 'foo\r\n' > crfile;   printf '%%s/\r//\nw\n' | ed -s crfile;   sed -n l crfile [12:58:40]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	shbot1	[12:58:41] Petter: foo$ [12:58:41]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Petter	[12:59:03] Cool! Thanks Riviera 8 ) [12:59:03]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	ifohancroft	[14:52:39] Btw what would you guys recommend for learning sed? Should I run through the man pages and then learn regex/the flavor that sed uses? [14:52:39]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	_val_	[14:54:29] ifohancroft: /topic [14:54:29]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Soliton	[15:01:00] learning basic regular expressions is certainly useful. if you need to do more complicated stuff than s/// commands sed is likely not the tool to use anyway. [15:01:00]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	ifohancroft	[15:05:09] _val_ good point, ty, you too Soliton [15:05:09]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	ghoti	[18:36:35] So .. I know that I can substitute the Nth occurrence of something by appending a number as a flag -- as in, `s/RE/rpl/2`.

2016-10-26 09:43:39	izalove	[18:37:29] your best bet is to use s/// multiple times [18:37:29]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	ghoti	[18:37:42] yep, that was my fallback position. [18:37:42]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	ghoti	[18:37:54] thanks for confirming. [18:37:54]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Petter	[19:42:25] Because sed is fun. [19:42:25]
2016-10-26 09:43:39	Petter	[19:42:34] # printf '%s\n' 'RE RE' 'RE RE RE RE RE RE RE' | sed ':a; s/RE/rpl/1; x; /.\{2\}/!{ s/^/./; x; ba; }; s/.*//; x;' [19:42:34]

2016-10-26 12:54:16	Petter	[11:01:29] _val_: with echo you should use the -e switch to make \r a carriage return. [11:01:29]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	ifohancroft	[11:01:40] That's what I mean, I want the editing/replacing to be done in place [11:01:40]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	_val_	[11:02:00] :/ [11:02:00]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	han-solo	[11:02:02] use the '-i' option, not standard though [11:02:02]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	_val_	[11:02:05] ifohancroft: just use -i [11:02:05]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	ifohancroft	[11:02:41] thank you _val_ and han-solo (nice nickname btw) that seems to be working [11:02:41]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	ifohancroft	[11:03:53] btw when doing sed -n l file I see \ is this sed breaking the line to be shorter? [11:03:53]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Petter	[11:06:00] Yes. [11:06:00]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Petter	[11:07:29] You could give it an argument as well, to wrap at different lengths. [11:07:29]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Petter	[11:08:19] # printf '%s\n' 'looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong line' | sed -n 'l 20' [11:08:19]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	shbot1	[11:08:20] Petter: loooooooooooooooooo\ [11:08:20]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	shbot1	[11:08:20] Petter: ooooooooooooooong l\ [11:08:20]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	shbot1	[11:08:20] Petter: ine$ [11:08:20]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Petter	[11:10:38] Looks like you can disable wrapping with 0. [11:10:38]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Petter	[11:10:57] At least in GNU sed. [11:10:57]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	ifohancroft	[11:12:34] Is there a place where you can see differences between standard sed vs GNU sed or if there are other flavours/variants as well or the only way is the documentation [11:12:34]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Soliton	[11:23:43] ifohancroft: http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sed.html that's the posix specification. for what some specific variant supports you need to check its documentation. [11:23:43]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	ifohancroft	[11:24:12] Thank you, Soliton. [11:24:12]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Petter	[11:26:39] To edit files in place, you should use an editor. Like ed. [11:26:39]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Petter	[11:28:39] # printf 'foo\r\n' > crfile;   printf '%s\n' '%s/^M//' w | ed -s crfile;   sed -n l crfile [11:28:39]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	shbot1	[11:28:40] Petter: ? [11:28:40]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	shbot1	[11:28:40] Petter: foo\r$ [11:28:40]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Petter	[11:28:51] Ops. [11:28:51]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Petter	[11:30:21] Oh, I think my copy-paste don't work with ^M. To get ^M in the pattern, use Ctrl+v Ctrl+m. [11:30:21]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Petter	[11:31:06] Ed doesn't seem to work with \r. At least I can't get it to. [11:31:06]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Soliton	[11:31:43] # printf 'foo\r\n' > crfile;   printf '%s\n' $'%s/\r//' w | ed -s crfile;   sed -n l crfile [11:31:43]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	shbot1	[11:31:44] Soliton: foo$ [11:31:44]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Petter	[11:32:04] Nice! Didn't think of that. [11:32:04]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Petter	[11:32:32] That's a Bash thing though, or? [11:32:32]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Soliton	[11:33:21] yes. [11:33:21]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Soliton	[11:33:36] ed sees a literal \r. [11:33:36]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	geirha	[11:46:12] soon to be an sh thing [11:46:12]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Riviera	[12:53:32] Or just let printf do everything. [12:53:32]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Petter	[12:58:40] # printf 'foo\r\n' > crfile;   printf '%%s/\r//\nw\n' | ed -s crfile;   sed -n l crfile [12:58:40]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	shbot1	[12:58:41] Petter: foo$ [12:58:41]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Petter	[12:59:03] Cool! Thanks Riviera 8 ) [12:59:03]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	ifohancroft	[14:52:39] Btw what would you guys recommend for learning sed? Should I run through the man pages and then learn regex/the flavor that sed uses? [14:52:39]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	_val_	[14:54:29] ifohancroft: /topic [14:54:29]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Soliton	[15:01:00] learning basic regular expressions is certainly useful. if you need to do more complicated stuff than s/// commands sed is likely not the tool to use anyway. [15:01:00]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	ifohancroft	[15:05:09] _val_ good point, ty, you too Soliton [15:05:09]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	ghoti	[18:36:35] So .. I know that I can substitute the Nth occurrence of something by appending a number as a flag -- as in, `s/RE/rpl/2`. What if I want to replace the Nth through Mth?  For example, `s/RE/rpl/{1-3}`? I'm using FreeBSD's sed, so I'm pretty sure this isn't possible .. but might it be possible using GNU sed? [18:36:35]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	izalove	[18:37:13] don't think so [18:37:13]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	izalove	[18:37:29] your best bet is to use s/// multiple times [18:37:29]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	ghoti	[18:37:42] yep, that was my fallback position. [18:37:42]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	ghoti	[18:37:54] thanks for confirming. [18:37:54]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Petter	[19:42:25] Because sed is fun. [19:42:25]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	Petter	[19:42:34] # printf '%s\n' 'RE RE' 'RE RE RE RE RE RE RE' | sed ':a; s/RE/rpl/1; x; /.\{2\}/!{ s/^/./; x; ba; }; s/.*//; x;' [19:42:34]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	shbot1	[19:42:36] Petter: rpl rpl [19:42:36]
2016-10-26 12:54:16	shbot1	[19:42:36] Petter: rpl rpl rpl RE RE RE RE [19:42:36]

2016-10-26 15:30:03	hiroki	Hi Folks. I'm having trouble getting my sed regex right -> echo 'set uhi_hld_bo garbage=great uhihp=trash' | sed --quiet 's/^set \(.*\) \(.*\)$/\1=\2/p'. This gives me 'uhi_hld_bo garbage=great=uhihp=trash' whereas i'm looking for 'uhi_hld_bo garbage=great uhihp=trash'. Any tips ?

2016-10-26 15:33:02	izalove	sed 's/set //'
2016-10-26 15:33:26	izalove	ah i guess you want to exclude any other line as well
2016-10-26 15:33:42	izalove	sed -n 's/set \(.*\) \(.*\)/\1 \2/p'
2016-10-26 15:33:49	izalove	sed -n 's/^set \(.*\) \(.*\)/\1 \2/p'
2016-10-26 15:34:10	izalove	like, literally just replace the = in your code with a space
2016-10-26 15:34:25	hiroki	izalove: thanks, but the cut won't work considering the file it reads from contains more then 1 line -> http://pastebin.com/LwHEK9rF
2016-10-26 15:35:27	hiroki	izalove: that's interesting, however i'm kind of bounded keeping the = in there as i'm doing an 'export $output_of_sed' to export it as a variable in BASH
2016-10-26 15:35:52	izalove	what
2016-10-26 15:35:56	izalove	that won't work
2016-10-26 15:36:17	izalove	you need   eval "export $(sed ...)"
2016-10-26 15:36:24	izalove	i think
2016-10-26 15:36:28	hiroki	It does as long as the set lines only contain 3 items seperated by a space
2016-10-26 15:36:58	hiroki	The trouble is when the set line contain 4 or more items
2016-10-26 15:37:34	hiroki	Is there a way to have \1 only match the first word it comes across, instead of the last one (which is what it seems to be doing now) ?
2016-10-26 15:38:57	izalove	that's not what's happening
2016-10-26 15:39:06	izalove	you forgot that .* is greedy
2016-10-26 15:39:10	izalove	so your first \(.
2016-10-26 15:39:17	izalove	so your first \(.*\) eats up two words
2016-10-26 15:40:30	hiroki	So i'm guessing that means I have to use a non-greedy regex. Is it possible to be non-greedy for the first match (\1) and greedy for the second match (\2) ?
2016-10-26 15:42:33	izalove	no but you can use [^ ]* instead of .*
2016-10-26 15:42:44	izalove	so it won't match a space
2016-10-26 15:45:14	hiroki	izalove: 's/^set \([^ ]*\) \(.*\)$/\1=\2/p' seems to work. However, not quite getting yet what [^ ]* does. What space would it otherwise match, the last one in the line ?
2016-10-26 15:45:14		[15:45]
2016-10-26 15:45:46	izalove	set uhi_hld_bo garbage=great uhihp=trash
2016-10-26 15:45:56	izalove	    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
2016-10-26 15:46:00	izalove	all of that is \1
2016-10-26 15:46:06	izalove	in your original code
2016-10-26 15:47:55	hiroki	Right, so it'll only match now from ^ until the first space using [^ ]*
2016-10-26 15:48:46	izalove	no, [^xyz] means "a character that's not a x or a y or a z
2016-10-26 15:48:49	izalove	no, [^xyz] means "a character that's not a x or a y or a z"
2016-10-26 15:50:10	hiroki	Ah, I get it, thanks for the explanation izalove !
2016-10-26 15:51:55	hiroki	Looks like i'm still having issues getting where I want, but the original mis-match has been fixed now ! -> for i in $(cat /tmp/hello | sed --quiet 's/^set \([^ ]*\) \(.*\)$/\1=\2/p'); do echo export "$i"; done. Looks like any additional items on a line are treated seperately. Guess i'm going to fiddle a bit more..
2016-10-26 15:57:00		[15:51]
2016-10-26 16:06:55	hiroki	izalove: looks like I got it working, I was ignoring the fact a for loop splits on whitespaces by default. I'm using this now: while read i; do echo export "$i"; done < <(cat /tmp/hello | sed --quiet 's/^set \([^ ]*\) \(.*\)$/\1=\2/p')
2016-10-26 16:07:11	izalove	y u no      export "$(sed ...)"
2016-10-26 16:10:38	hiroki	izalove: does not seem to work ?

2016-10-26 23:12:49	ifohancroft	How do I replace ref, with `ref`, ref= with `ref`= and ref) with `ref`)? I don't insist on replacing all three at once, it can be separate commands
2016-10-26 23:13:16	izalove	sed 's/ref/`ref`/g'
2016-10-26 23:14:20	ifohancroft	izalove i have other occurances of ref as part of a bigger string, at the same line, which I don't want to replace, which the regex will do if I understand it correctly
2016-10-26 23:15:05	Soliton	then explain how you pick the occurences you want to replace.
2016-10-26 23:15:06	izalove	replacing ref with `ref` without touching the rest sounds hard
2016-10-26 23:15:51	ifohancroft	Soliton I just did: ref that has , right after it, ref that has = right after it and ref that has ) right after it.
2016-10-26 23:16:04	ifohancroft	so first one would be replacing ref, with `ref`,
2016-10-26 23:16:25	ifohancroft	second ref= with `ref`= and third ref) with `ref`)
2016-10-26 23:16:26	Soliton	oh, i didn't think the comma was part of the string there.
2016-10-26 23:16:35	ifohancroft	yeah, sry, I should have specified
2016-10-26 23:16:59	Soliton	sed 's/ref\([,=)]\)/`ref`\1/g'
2016-10-26 23:17:26	ifohancroft	oh, cool one, didn't know you could do that, ty, let me try

2016-10-27 17:07:22	hiroki	[01:30:03] Hi Folks. I'm having trouble getting my sed regex right -> echo 'set uhi_hld_bo garbage=great uhihp=trash' | sed --quiet 's/^set \(.*\) \(.*\)$/\1=\2/p'. This gives me 'uhi_hld_bo garbage=great=uhihp=trash' whereas i'm looking for 'uhi_hld_bo garbage=great uhihp=trash'. Any tips ? [01:30:03]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:31:44] cut -d' ' -f2- [01:31:44]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:33:01] sed 's/set //' [01:33:01]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:33:25] ah i guess you want to exclude any other line as well [01:33:25]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:33:42] sed -n 's/set \(.*\) \(.*\)/\1 \2/p' [01:33:42]

2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:34:10] like, literally just replace the = in your code with a space [01:34:10]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	hiroki	[01:34:25] izalove: thanks, but the cut won't work considering the file it reads from contains more then 1 line -> http://pastebin.com/LwHEK9rF [01:34:25]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	hiroki	[01:35:27] izalove: that's interesting, however i'm kind of bounded keeping the = in there as i'm doing an 'export $output_of_sed' to export it as a variable in BASH [01:35:27]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:35:52] what [01:35:52]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:35:56] that won't work [01:35:56]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:36:17] you need   eval "export $(sed ...)" [01:36:17]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:36:24] i think [01:36:24]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	hiroki	[01:36:28] It does as long as the set lines only contain 3 items seperated by a space [01:36:28]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	hiroki	[01:36:58] The trouble is when the set line contain 4 or more items [01:36:58]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	hiroki	[01:37:34] Is there a way to have \1 only match the first word it comes across, instead of the last one (which is what it seems to be doing now) ? [01:37:34]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:38:57] that's not what's happening [01:38:57]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:39:06] you forgot that .* is greedy [01:39:06]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:39:10] so your first \(. [01:39:10]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:39:17] so your first \(.*\) eats up two words [01:39:17]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	hiroki	[01:40:30] So i'm guessing that means I have to use a non-greedy regex. Is it possible to be non-greedy for the first match (\1) and greedy for the second match (\2) ? [01:40:30]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:42:33] no but you can use [^ ]* instead of .* [01:42:33]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:42:44] so it won't match a space [01:42:44]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	hiroki	[01:45:14] izalove: 's/^set \([^ ]*\) \(.*\)$/\1=\2/p' seems to work. However, not quite getting yet what [^ ]* does. What space would it otherwise match, the last one in the line ? [01:45:14]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:45:46] set uhi_hld_bo garbage=great uhihp=trash [01:45:46]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:45:56]     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ [01:45:56]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:46:00] all of that is \1 [01:46:00]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:46:06] in your original code [01:46:06]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	hiroki	[01:47:55] Right, so it'll only match now from ^ until the first space using [^ ]* [01:47:55]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:48:46] no, [^xyz] means "a character that's not a x or a y or a z [01:48:46]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[01:48:49] no, [^xyz] means "a character that's not a x or a y or a z" [01:48:49]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	hiroki	[01:50:10] Ah, I get it, thanks for the explanation izalove ! [01:50:10]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	hiroki	[01:51:55] Looks like i'm still having issues getting where I want, but the original mis-match has been fixed now ! -> for i in $(cat /tmp/hello | sed --quiet 's/^set \([^ ]*\) \(.*\)$/\1=\2/p'); do echo export "$i"; done. Looks like any additional items on a line are treated seperately. Guess i'm going to fiddle a bit more.. [01:51:55]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	hiroki	[02:06:55] izalove: looks like I got it working, I was ignoring the fact a for loop splits on whitespaces by default. I'm using this now: while read i; do echo export "$i"; done < <(cat /tmp/hello | sed --quiet 's/^set \([^ ]*\) \(.*\)$/\1=\2/p') [02:06:55]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[02:07:11] y u no      export "$(sed ...)" [02:07:11]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	hiroki	[02:10:38] izalove: does not seem to work ? [02:10:38]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	ifohancroft	[09:12:49] How do I replace ref, with `ref`, ref= with `ref`= and ref) with `ref`)? I don't insist on replacing all three at once, it can be separate commands [09:12:49]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[09:13:16] sed 's/ref/`ref`/g' [09:13:16]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	ifohancroft	[09:14:20] izalove i have other occurances of ref as part of a bigger string, at the same line, which I don't want to replace, which the regex will do if I understand it correctly [09:14:20]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	Soliton	[09:15:05] then explain how you pick the occurences you want to replace. [09:15:05]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	izalove	[09:15:06] replacing ref with `ref` without touching the rest sounds hard [09:15:06]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	ifohancroft	[09:15:51] Soliton I just did: ref that has , right after it, ref that has = right after it and ref that has ) right after it. [09:15:51]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	ifohancroft	[09:16:04] so first one would be replacing ref, with `ref`, [09:16:04]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	ifohancroft	[09:16:25] second ref= with `ref`= and third ref) with `ref`) [09:16:25]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	Soliton	[09:16:26] oh, i didn't think the comma was part of the string there. [09:16:26]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	ifohancroft	[09:16:35] yeah, sry, I should have specified [09:16:35]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	Soliton	[09:16:59] sed 's/ref\([,=)]\)/`ref`\1/g' [09:16:59]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	ifohancroft	[09:17:26] oh, cool one, didn't know you could do that, ty, let me try [09:17:26]
2016-10-27 17:07:22	ifohancroft	[09:22:43] it works btw [09:22:43]

2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[01:33:49] sed -n 's/^set \(.*\) \(.*\)/\1 \2/p' [01:33:49]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[01:34:10] like, literally just replace the = in your code with a space [01:34:10]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	hiroki	[01:34:25] izalove: thanks, but the cut won't work considering the file it reads from contains more then 1 line -> http://pastebin.com/LwHEK9rF [01:34:25]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	hiroki	[01:35:27] izalove: that's interesting, however i'm kind of bounded keeping the = in there as i'm doing an 'export $output_of_sed' to export it as a variable in BASH [01:35:27]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[01:35:52] what [01:35:52]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[01:35:56] that won't work [01:35:56]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[01:36:17] you need   eval "export $(sed ...)" [01:36:17]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[01:36:24] i think [01:36:24]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	hiroki	[01:36:28] It does as long as the set lines only contain 3 items seperated by a space [01:36:28]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	hiroki	[01:36:58] The trouble is when the set line contain 4 or more items [01:36:58]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	hiroki	[01:37:34] Is there a way to have \1 only match the first word it comes across, instead of the last one (which is what it seems to be doing now) ? [01:37:34]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[01:38:57] that's not what's happening [01:38:57]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[01:39:06] you forgot that .* is greedy [01:39:06]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[01:39:10] so your first \(. [01:39:10]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[01:39:17] so your first \(.*\) eats up two words [01:39:17]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	hiroki	[01:40:30] So i'm guessing that means I have to use a non-greedy regex. Is it possible to be non-greedy for the first match (\1) and greedy for the second match (\2) ? [01:40:30]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[01:42:33] no but you can use [^ ]* instead of .* [01:42:33]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[01:42:44] so it won't match a space [01:42:44]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	hiroki	[01:45:14] izalove: 's/^set \([^ ]*\) \(.*\)$/\1=\2/p' seems to work. However, not quite getting yet what [^ ]* does. What space would it otherwise match, the last one in the line ? [01:45:14]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[01:45:46] set uhi_hld_bo garbage=great uhihp=trash [01:45:46]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[01:45:56]     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ [01:45:56]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[01:46:00] all of that is \1 [01:46:00]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[01:46:06] in your original code [01:46:06]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	hiroki	[01:47:55] Right, so it'll only match now from ^ until the first space using [^ ]* [01:47:55]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[01:48:46] no, [^xyz] means "a character that's not a x or a y or a z [01:48:46]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[01:48:49] no, [^xyz] means "a character that's not a x or a y or a z" [01:48:49]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	hiroki	[01:50:10] Ah, I get it, thanks for the explanation izalove ! [01:50:10]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	hiroki	[01:51:55] Looks like i'm still having issues getting where I want, but the original mis-match has been fixed now ! -> for i in $(cat /tmp/hello | sed --quiet 's/^set \([^ ]*\) \(.*\)$/\1=\2/p'); do echo export "$i"; done. Looks like any additional items on a line are treated seperately. Guess i'm going to fiddle a bit more.. [01:51:55]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	hiroki	[02:06:55] izalove: looks like I got it working, I was ignoring the fact a for loop splits on whitespaces by default. I'm using this now: while read i; do echo export "$i"; done < <(cat /tmp/hello | sed --quiet 's/^set \([^ ]*\) \(.*\)$/\1=\2/p') [02:06:55]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[02:07:11] y u no      export "$(sed ...)" [02:07:11]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	hiroki	[02:10:38] izalove: does not seem to work ? [02:10:38]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	ifohancroft	[09:12:49] How do I replace ref, with `ref`, ref= with `ref`= and ref) with `ref`)? I don't insist on replacing all three at once, it can be separate commands [09:12:49]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[09:13:16] sed 's/ref/`ref`/g' [09:13:16]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	ifohancroft	[09:14:20] izalove i have other occurances of ref as part of a bigger string, at the same line, which I don't want to replace, which the regex will do if I understand it correctly [09:14:20]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	Soliton	[09:15:05] then explain how you pick the occurences you want to replace. [09:15:05]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	izalove	[09:15:06] replacing ref with `ref` without touching the rest sounds hard [09:15:06]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	ifohancroft	[09:15:51] Soliton I just did: ref that has , right after it, ref that has = right after it and ref that has ) right after it. [09:15:51]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	ifohancroft	[09:16:04] so first one would be replacing ref, with `ref`, [09:16:04]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	ifohancroft	[09:16:25] second ref= with `ref`= and third ref) with `ref`) [09:16:25]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	Soliton	[09:16:26] oh, i didn't think the comma was part of the string there. [09:16:26]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	ifohancroft	[09:16:35] yeah, sry, I should have specified [09:16:35]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	Soliton	[09:16:59] sed 's/ref\([,=)]\)/`ref`\1/g' [09:16:59]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	ifohancroft	[09:17:26] oh, cool one, didn't know you could do that, ty, let me try [09:17:26]
2016-10-27 22:29:47	ifohancroft	[09:22:43] it works btw [09:22:43]

2016-10-28 01:39:22	malade_mental	Hi! I'm writing a script to substitute http url to local uri in some files.

The problem is that $url contains some slashes, so how do I automatically treat it as a string and not as a regexp?

2016-10-28 04:30:46	ash_workz	how does one print between two matches but not the matches themselves?
2016-10-28 04:32:01	izalove	something like  /a/,/b/{/a/d;/b/d}
2016-10-28 04:32:55	geirha	or  1,/a/d; /b/,$

2016-10-28 12:28:11	Soliton	[14:37:46] it just groups the commands. [14:37:46]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	ash_workz	[14:39:48] I still need to read up on it... my understanding is very rudimentary... [14:39:48]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	ash_workz	[14:46:31] are '-e' flags  just like ';'s ? [14:46:31]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Petter	[14:57:55] Pretty much. Though commands that takes a filename or text argument will not end the argument on a ; [14:57:55]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	ash_workz	[15:02:31] I see. [15:02:31]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Petter	[15:03:47] # printf '%s\n' line | sed 'a extra line; s/$/\\/;' [15:03:47]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	shbot	[15:03:48] Petter: line [15:03:48]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	shbot	[15:03:48] Petter: extra line; s/$/\/; [15:03:48]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Petter	[15:04:02] # printf '%s\n' line | sed -e 'a extra line' -e 's/$/\\/;' [15:04:02]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	shbot	[15:04:02] Petter: line\ [15:04:02]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	shbot	[15:04:03] Petter: extra line [15:04:03]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	ash_workz	[15:05:41] briefly reading, about the pattern space makes geirha's answer all the more straight-forward. I thought one might be able to execute the logic, "print from the _following_ line of each line starting at /a/ until the line _prior_ to /b/" -- but that seems a lot more convoluted for no reason I guess [15:05:41]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Soliton	[15:09:19] one could imagine /b/-1 as an address but then sed would have to go back a line once it matches /b/. not good for a stream editor... [15:09:19]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Soliton	[15:09:33] ed can do that though. [15:09:33]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	ash_workz	[15:34:57] Soliton: well, I was thinking you could use a capital letter as something of a "lookahead" to check for the pattern in the next line and the *screech* stop [15:34:57]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Soliton	[15:38:45] so depending on whether it's -1, -2, -9999... sed has to wait for that many lines to read before it can do anything. sure, no question that it can be done. my point was that it doesn't fit a stream editor. [15:38:45]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	ash_workz	[15:47:43] I clearly don't understand the mechanics well enough to appreciate your input :\... I just though you could look at n+1 for each line for a match and delete/quit (else, print n+1) [15:47:43]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Diplomat	[16:45:42] Hey guys, I have a file ~1GB that has 1 row of json objects.. separated by comma but when I run: sed 's/}, {/}\n{/g' raw_requests.cleaned.json it tells me: sed: couldn't re-allocate memory .. I have 2GB+ RAM left [16:45:42]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Diplomat	[16:45:50] Any ideas what I should try to get it working ? [16:45:50]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Soliton	[16:48:42] what's the exact command and the exact error message? [16:48:42]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Diplomat	[16:49:05] sed 's/}, {/}\n{/g' raw_requests.cleaned.json [16:49:05]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Diplomat	[16:49:10] sed: couldn't re-allocate memory [16:49:10]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Soliton	[16:49:31] is that file all one line? [16:49:31]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Diplomat	[16:49:54] yup [16:49:54]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Soliton	[16:50:09] split it up some way first. [16:50:09]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Soliton	[16:50:55] or use a different tool. [16:50:55]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Soliton	[16:51:08] i doubt you can make that work with sed. [16:51:08]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Diplomat	[16:51:13] I tried tr too [16:51:13]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Diplomat	[16:51:19] tr '}, {' '}\n{' < raw_requests.cleaned.json [16:51:19]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Diplomat	[16:51:30] but its obviously a bit wrong because it tried to replace every } , { [16:51:30]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Soliton	[16:51:48] that's not how tr works. [16:51:48]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Soliton	[16:51:58] it replaces single characters. [16:51:58]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Diplomat	[16:52:07] unfortunately yes [16:52:07]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	waldner	[16:53:03] jq . file.json [16:53:03]
2016-10-28 12:28:11	Diplomat	[17:28:15] waldner: it would work, but those objects are comma separated [17:28:15]

2016-10-28 22:16:40	Soliton	[16:48:42] what's the exact command and the exact error message? [16:48:42]

2016-10-28 22:59:09	unclechu	hi there. is there any difference between `sed -e 's/foo/bar/'` and `sed 's/foo/bar/'`, why some commands always use this `-e` flag and some another is not?
2016-10-28 23:05:00		[22:59]
2016-10-28 23:07:50	geirha	-e is only needed when you supply multiple scripts
2016-10-28 23:08:01	geirha	sed -e 's/foo/bar/' -e 's/baz/qux/'
2016-10-28 23:08:25	geirha	why some commands always use -e is probably because whoever wrote those commands don't know sed very well
2016-10-28 23:09:35	geirha	some use -ie when wanting "in-place editing" because they think it makes it work on both GNU and BSD based systems
2016-10-28 23:10:50	geirha	-ie or -i -e
2016-10-28 23:11:01	geirha	which is rubbish, of course

2016-10-29 01:30:06	woky	Hi. There's an unique link address in a HTML page with variable date in path. I'd like to print this date and make the sed exit after first successful replace:
2016-10-29 01:30:19	woky	cat test.html | sed -n -r 's|.*"/download-leaflet/([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2})/hypermarkety\?download".*|\1|p'
2016-10-29 01:31:45	woky	For the sake of efficiency, I'd like sed to stop reading more lines after first match is printed. How can I do this? I'm just curious. I could just append " | tail -1" and be happy.
2016-10-29 01:32:02	woky	s/match/replacement/
2016-10-29 01:33:38	woky	I know I'm despicable for parsing HTML with sed and that there's no need for cat.
2016-10-29 01:35:00	go|dfish	woky: you can do /pattern/{ s//replacement/p; q; }
2016-10-29 01:35:16	go|dfish	e.g. sed -n -r '\|.*"/download-leaflet/([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2})/hypermarkety\?download".*|{ s||\1|p; q; }' test.html
2016-10-29 01:35:52	go|dfish	if you leave pattern empty in s/pattern/replacement/ it will re-use the last pattern matched, so you don't need to repeat it
2016-10-29 01:36:18	go|dfish	and as you're using a different delimiter in /pattern/{ ... } you need to escape the opening hence \|pattern|{ ... }
2016-10-29 01:36:56	woky	go|dfish, I see. I had the impression that & and \N are only relevant for s/// command.
2016-10-29 01:37:04	woky	go|dfish, thnk you!
2016-10-29 01:38:09	go|dfish	there still is an s/// command in there: s||\1|p;
2016-10-29 01:38:26	go|dfish	it's just re-using the pattern matched with \|...|
2016-10-29 01:38:31	woky	Your 3rd line clarified it. I was too quick to respond. :-)
2016-10-29 01:38:43	go|dfish	ah okay

2016-10-29 12:25:04	geirha	[21:13:12] depends on what "close" means [21:13:12]
2016-10-29 12:25:04	Kurvivor	[21:25:10] 'separated by no more then 3 newlines' [21:25:10]
2016-10-29 12:25:04	geirha	[21:26:08] so you're looking for one of these three cases  A\nB, A\n\nB or A\n\n\nB [21:26:08]
2016-10-29 12:25:04	Petter	[21:51:32] Can B be on one of the lines before A as well as after? [21:51:32]
2016-10-29 12:25:04	Kurvivor	[22:11:20] well, lines between them do not have to be empty [22:11:20]

2016-10-29 23:10:11	Kurvivor	[21:08:03] hello! [21:08:03]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	Kurvivor	[21:09:34] can one search for a "line looking like A that is close to line looking like B"? [21:09:34]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	geirha	[21:13:12] depends on what "close" means [21:13:12]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	Kurvivor	[21:25:10] 'separated by no more then 3 newlines' [21:25:10]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	geirha	[21:26:08] so you're looking for one of these three cases  A\nB, A\n\nB or A\n\n\nB [21:26:08]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	Petter	[21:51:32] Can B be on one of the lines before A as well as after? [21:51:32]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	Kurvivor	[22:11:20] well, lines between them do not have to be empty [22:11:20]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	Kurvivor	[22:11:23] i am sorry [22:11:23]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	Kurvivor	[22:11:36] i will rethink, sleep and ask again, properly [22:11:36]

2016-10-29 23:10:11	geirha	[22:17:38] Good. I suspected that "newlines" was probably "lines" [22:17:38]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	Petter	[23:33:10] Tricky.. this is what I came up with: [23:33:10]

2016-10-29 23:10:11	izalove	[01:58:04] kurahaupo wrote that [01:58:04]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	unclechu	[08:59:09] hi there. is there any difference between `sed -e 's/foo/bar/'` and `sed 's/foo/bar/'`, why some commands always use this `-e` flag and some another is not? [08:59:09]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	geirha	[09:07:50] -e is only needed when you supply multiple scripts [09:07:50]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	geirha	[09:08:01] sed -e 's/foo/bar/' -e 's/baz/qux/' [09:08:01]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	geirha	[09:08:25] why some commands always use -e is probably because whoever wrote those commands don't know sed very well [09:08:25]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	geirha	[09:09:35] some use -ie when wanting "in-place editing" because they think it makes it work on both GNU and BSD based systems [09:09:35]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	geirha	[09:10:50] -ie or -i -e [09:10:50]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	geirha	[09:11:01] which is rubbish, of course [09:11:01]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	woky	[11:30:06] Hi. There's an unique link address in a HTML page with variable date in path. I'd like to print this date and make the sed exit after first successful replace: [11:30:06]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	woky	[11:30:19] cat test.html | sed -n -r 's|.*"/download-leaflet/([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2})/hypermarkety\?download".*|\1|p' [11:30:19]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	woky	[11:31:45] For the sake of efficiency, I'd like sed to stop reading more lines after first match is printed. How can I do this? I'm just curious. I could just append " | tail -1" and be happy. [11:31:45]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	woky	[11:32:02] s/match/replacement/ [11:32:02]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	woky	[11:33:38] I know I'm despicable for parsing HTML with sed and that there's no need for cat. [11:33:38]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	go|dfish	[11:35:00] woky: you can do /pattern/{ s//replacement/p; q; } [11:35:00]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	go|dfish	[11:35:16] e.g. sed -n -r '\|.*"/download-leaflet/([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2})/hypermarkety\?download".*|{ s||\1|p; q; }' test.html [11:35:16]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	go|dfish	[11:35:52] if you leave pattern empty in s/pattern/replacement/ it will re-use the last pattern matched, so you don't need to repeat it [11:35:52]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	go|dfish	[11:36:18] and as you're using a different delimiter in /pattern/{ ... } you need to escape the opening hence \|pattern|{ ... } [11:36:18]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	woky	[11:36:56] go|dfish, I see. I had the impression that & and \N are only relevant for s/// command. [11:36:56]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	woky	[11:37:04] go|dfish, thnk you! [11:37:04]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	go|dfish	[11:38:09] there still is an s/// command in there: s||\1|p; [11:38:09]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	go|dfish	[11:38:26] it's just re-using the pattern matched with \|...| [11:38:26]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	woky	[11:38:31] Your 3rd line clarified it. I was too quick to respond. :-) [11:38:31]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	go|dfish	[11:38:43] ah okay [11:38:43]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	unclechu	[04:52:12] geirha: thanks for explanation [04:52:12]
2016-10-29 23:10:11	unclechu	[04:52:37] geirha: thanks for the explanation [04:52:37]

2016-10-31 00:22:52	geirha	[21:13:12] depends on what "close" means [21:13:12]

2016-10-31 00:22:52	geirha	[09:07:50] -e is only needed when you supply multiple scripts [09:07:50]

2016-10-31 00:22:52	geirha	[09:08:25] why some commands always use -e is probably because whoever wrote those commands don't know sed very well [09:08:25]
2016-10-31 00:22:52	geirha	[09:09:35] some use -ie when wanting "in-place editing" because they think it makes it work on both GNU and BSD based systems [09:09:35]

2016-10-31 00:22:52	woky	[11:31:45] For the sake of efficiency, I'd like sed to stop reading more lines after first match is printed. How can I do this? I'm just curious. I could just append " | tail -1" and be happy. [11:31:45]

2016-10-31 16:27:19	yitz	Yes, you can use {} outside of an 's' command to group
2016-10-31 16:27:37	yitz	And you can use a /regex/ to select lines which an 's' command would apply to
2016-10-31 16:30:44	bn_	in the prefixed /<regex>/, can I select part of that line and backreference it later in the subsequent {...} statements with \1 or so?
2016-10-31 16:31:13	yitz	I don't think so
2016-10-31 16:31:21	bn_	damn
2016-10-31 16:31:22	yitz	The matcher and the 's' command are separate
2016-10-31 16:31:33	yitz	But if you can use a regex to match, you can use a regex in the 's'
2016-10-31 16:31:49	yitz	Just show a sample input/output and someone may be able to show you how to transform it :P

2016-10-31 16:41:52	bn_	ok, here's what I have so far, not sure if it works though:  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9617b715ca77a6e6952d112dc9de03e4
2016-10-31 16:43:06	bn_	input file is an .HTML file that contains HTML elements that have some attributes with a prefix+URL-encoded URI, I basically want to remove the prefix and URLdecode the URI.
2016-10-31 16:44:39	bn_	(and yes, I saw the warning about using sed with HTML, it links to a SO answer that was had 0 technical reasoning and was stupidly upvoted for being funny)
2016-10-31 16:48:22	yitz	The basic reason not to is that XML/HTML is a language requiring context to parse and regex is context-free. sed can't do context.
2016-10-31 16:48:44	yitz	Do you have sample input/output? Something that works or doesn't work?

2016-11-02 00:56:12	Soliton	[09:56:17] maybe you should show what exactly you're talking about. [09:56:17]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	bn_	[10:05:08] Soliton: https://www.debuggex.com/r/9cic7YXaUqbgeaHu  I pasted a link earlier but here it is in an online regex parser/visualizer with some test data, in which it's doing the same thing- only replacing the first instance.  Note, I'm not sure if PCRE is the best dialect of regex to select (I'm using -r for extended regex support when I invoke sed) [10:05:08]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	Soliton	[10:07:19] your regex is great but fairly useless without the data you're testing it with. [10:07:19]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	bn_	[10:08:02] ? [10:08:02]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	bn_	[10:09:14] Soliton:  it should be in the link, does it not show up for you? [10:09:14]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	geirha	[10:09:21] that debuggex clearly doesn't grok sed syntax [10:09:21]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	geirha	[10:09:52] though if you remove all the sed syntax and only leave the regex, you'll see the greedy matching [10:09:52]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	Soliton	[10:10:42] ah, i see the result part now. [10:10:42]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	Soliton	[10:10:58] yeah you're confusing that site with sed commands. [10:10:58]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	geirha	[10:11:32] and the regex dialects that site knows are only non-standard ones [10:11:32]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	bn_	[10:11:33] geirha: true, I was hoping to at least visualize how it was parsing it... I know what you're saying about greedy though [10:11:33]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	Soliton	[10:14:30] i suggest using a different delimiter and not escape :. then the regex already gets a bit more readable. [10:14:30]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	Soliton	[10:15:31] = is also escaped for some reason. [10:15:31]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	bn_	[10:16:52] yeah, I escaped a bit liberally because I couldn't remember all the reserved chars, I figured it was better to be safe than sorry [10:16:52]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	bn_	[10:21:04] is extended regex dialect known used in any other languages? [10:21:04]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	bn_	[10:24:35] the only online tools I'm finding are ones that use PCRE, js, etc. www.regexplanet.com seems to also have a a tool but I'm not sure if any of the languages listed use extended regex dialect [10:24:35]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	bn_	[10:25:16] I wonder if vim would be a better way to visualize the matching [10:25:16]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	bn_	[10:25:30] or mis-matching rather [10:25:30]

2016-11-02 00:56:12	bn_	[10:42:22] Soliton: thanks, why the \, in the beginning? [10:42:22]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	Soliton	[10:43:02] you need to escape if you want to use a different delimiter for addresses. [10:43:02]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	bn_	[10:43:51] the "anything but x" makes sense to me now, but I'm still confused why .* partially worked or wasn't even matching anything in the online tool [10:43:51]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	bn_	[10:44:04] ah [10:44:04]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	Soliton	[10:45:00] well, you can put .* again to see what happens. [10:45:00]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	Soliton	[10:45:29] it'll match all the things. [10:45:29]

2016-11-02 00:56:12	bn_	[10:46:52] I wonder if I should forget ".*" as an idiom [10:46:52]
2016-11-02 00:56:12	Soliton	[10:47:37] yes, .* is usually not what you want. [10:47:37]

2016-11-02 12:00:55	bn_	[10:05:08] Soliton: https://www.debuggex.com/r/9cic7YXaUqbgeaHu  I pasted a link earlier but here it is in an online regex parser/visualizer with some test data, in which it's doing the same thing- only replacing the first instance.  Note, I'm not sure if PCRE is the best dialect of regex to select (I'm using -r for extended regex support when I invoke sed) [10:05:08]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	Soliton	[10:07:19] your regex is great but fairly useless without the data you're testing it with. [10:07:19]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	bn_	[10:08:02] ? [10:08:02]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	bn_	[10:09:14] Soliton:  it should be in the link, does it not show up for you? [10:09:14]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	geirha	[10:09:21] that debuggex clearly doesn't grok sed syntax [10:09:21]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	geirha	[10:09:52] though if you remove all the sed syntax and only leave the regex, you'll see the greedy matching [10:09:52]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	Soliton	[10:10:42] ah, i see the result part now. [10:10:42]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	Soliton	[10:10:58] yeah you're confusing that site with sed commands. [10:10:58]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	geirha	[10:11:32] and the regex dialects that site knows are only non-standard ones [10:11:32]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	bn_	[10:11:33] geirha: true, I was hoping to at least visualize how it was parsing it... I know what you're saying about greedy though [10:11:33]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	Soliton	[10:14:30] i suggest using a different delimiter and not escape :. then the regex already gets a bit more readable. [10:14:30]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	Soliton	[10:15:31] = is also escaped for some reason. [10:15:31]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	bn_	[10:16:52] yeah, I escaped a bit liberally because I couldn't remember all the reserved chars, I figured it was better to be safe than sorry [10:16:52]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	bn_	[10:21:04] is extended regex dialect known used in any other languages? [10:21:04]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	bn_	[10:24:35] the only online tools I'm finding are ones that use PCRE, js, etc. www.regexplanet.com seems to also have a a tool but I'm not sure if any of the languages listed use extended regex dialect [10:24:35]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	bn_	[10:25:16] I wonder if vim would be a better way to visualize the matching [10:25:16]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	bn_	[10:25:30] or mis-matching rather [10:25:30]

2016-11-02 12:00:55	dimm	[13:50:00] hello, All! [13:50:00]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	dimm	[13:50:47] is this right description for ": OR /"? [13:50:47]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	dimm	[13:50:51] [:,\/] [13:50:51]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	geirha	[13:51:40] no, that's   : or , or \ or / [13:51:40]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	dimm	[13:53:42] am i right understand that in this case i can not escape slash? [13:53:42]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	Riviera	[13:59:15] dimm: [:/] [13:59:15]

2016-11-02 12:00:55	Petter	[14:04:59] [8-] [14:04:59]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	Petter	[14:07:04] To test things, you can run a command like this on your command line. [14:07:04]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	Petter	[14:07:08] # printf '%s\n' ':  ,  .  -  \  /' | sed 's/[:,\/]/<&>/g;' [14:07:08]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	shbot	[14:07:10] Petter: <:>  <,>  .  -  <\>  </> [14:07:10]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	dimm	[15:00:25] damn :-) [15:00:25]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	dimm	[15:02:08] i trying to check as Petter said. it seems like [:/] working fine [15:02:08]
2016-11-02 12:00:55	bn_	[17:19:32] Soliton, and anyone else that helped that helped the other day, thanks!  as usual sed rocks! [17:19:32]
