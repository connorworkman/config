2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:19:40] i think so [01:19:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:19:44] this is schizophrenic [01:19:44]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:19:47] depends on your sed [01:19:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:20:00] how do I get a sed that follows regex properly? [01:20:00]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:20:20] so i can not be doing weird special forms of regex that dont line up with the docs [01:20:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:20:20] theres no such thing as a proper regex [01:20:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:20:33] theres standard, basic, extended, perl [01:20:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:20:39] im probably wrong on one there [01:20:39]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:21:08] either way, that example i gave works [01:21:08]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:21:28] right that works for -that- example [01:21:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:21:33] but lets say i wanted to do an ip address [01:21:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:21:36] thats not good [01:21:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:22:12] (\d{1,3}\.){1,3} or such wont be possible if sed is weird like this [01:22:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:23:04] am i looking for extended? [01:23:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:23:08] yes [01:23:08]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:23:16] im gonna wait for someone else to answer [01:23:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:25:13] but you can do \d\d?\d?\.\d\d? etc [01:25:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:26:12] which is still a terrible solution because ip's only go to 255 [01:26:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:27:07] and i dont think \d works even, you have to do [0-9] [01:27:07]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:27:17] why doesn't \d work? [01:27:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	 *	Phanes [01:27:22] doublechecks the regex doc [01:27:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:27:30] idk, i'm confusing it with awk [01:27:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:27:31] yep, \d is there and doesn't work [01:27:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:27:40] wtf [01:27:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:27:45] oh, i was right [01:27:45]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:28:01] old extended regex doesnt have \d, but gnu sed should have it [01:28:01]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:28:18] i dont understand why this is a thing [01:28:18]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:30:32] standardized tools are impossible to change [01:30:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:35:02] they say perl is better at everything [01:35:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:35:25] and sam is definitely better than sed [01:35:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	yitz	[01:41:12] sed got [[:digit:]] but not \d AFAIK [01:41:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	yitz	[01:41:38] \d isn't found in many regexes [01:41:38]

2016-10-18 00:14:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:02:56] I am not completely sure why echo 'hey' | sed 's/\n//g' doesn't remove the newline. I read in the info page that sed adds a newline back to output if there was one in the input. [10:02:56]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:03:26] Is echo 'hey'<RET> causing sed to see two input lines? [10:03:26]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:08:30] So, sed is removing the '\n' from the input, and that is why I can't remove it myself. [10:08:30]

2016-10-18 05:37:48	Riviera	Fernando-Basso: wasn't so much about emacs, rather about learning something more general first before bothering with extremely specialised tools as sed. :)
2016-10-18 05:38:11	Fernando-Basso	I can't deny your are right.
2016-10-18 05:38:59	Fernando-Basso	When I first met linux and open source / free software (I never know what to call this whole thing) I fell in love with command line things.
2016-10-18 05:39:40	Fernando-Basso	That probably touched me in a way that is stronger than reason.

2016-10-18 23:55:22	nal	[02:21:35] maybe? [02:21:35]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	yitz	[02:22:53] No [02:22:53]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	yitz	[02:22:59] - isn't a digit [02:22:59]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	nal	[02:28:43] welp, obsd was talking about removing any other localed other than utf8 and C... [02:28:43]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	nal	[02:29:32] and you're right, i kind of noticed 10 seconds after sending but was too lazy to say anything [02:29:32]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Soliton	[07:50:35] Phanes: sed uses basic regular expressions. if you want sed to understand your regex you should, too. [07:50:35]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:02:56] I am not completely sure why echo 'hey' | sed 's/\n//g' doesn't remove the newline. I read in the info page that sed adds a newline back to output if there was one in the input. [10:02:56]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:03:26] Is echo 'hey'<RET> causing sed to see two input lines? [10:03:26]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:08:30] So, sed is removing the '\n' from the input, and that is why I can't remove it myself. [10:08:30]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	go|dfish	[10:19:00] indeed [10:19:00]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:22:45] Also, I now got confused because of the pipes. I did RET not after echo 'hey', but after the pipe and the sed command. [10:22:45]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:23:12] Does RET apply to the echo command as well? [10:23:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:23:29] (gnu sed has -z) [10:23:29]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[11:34:19] Fernando-Basso: With RET you mean hitting the enter key, telling the shell to execute the current command line? [11:34:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[11:41:38] Yep. [11:41:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[11:51:03] Fernando-Basso: That is only relevant for the shell, making it execute the commands. [11:51:03]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[11:51:20] Fernando-Basso: It does not influence sed or echo or any other command, nor do they read it as their input. [11:51:20]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[11:55:15] Riviera: I see, "they don't read it as their input". I was thinking that they did, perhaps under the influence of C (which reads your RET presses as well when using certain functions). [11:55:15]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[11:55:34] Fernando-Basso: C is a programming language, it is not involved here. [11:55:34]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[11:56:07] :D [11:56:07]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[11:56:10] Fernando-Basso: I don't really know what to say, these are severe misconceptions that you have. [11:56:10]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[11:59:35] Unfortunately, yes... [11:59:35]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[12:01:52] You should have listened to me, then. :) [12:01:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[12:02:01] When I told you what to learn. :P [12:02:01]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[12:02:46] I did not even start those yet. [12:02:46]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[12:33:50] Fernando-Basso: Exactly, because sed (and friends) stand in your way. :) [12:33:50]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[12:35:57] Riviera: I haven't (yet) lost hope that I will eventually learn some of this stuff. [12:35:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	waldner	[12:41:47] echo adds a newline at the end, so sed really sees 'hey\n' as input [12:41:47]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	waldner	[12:42:28] regardless of where you hit enter [12:42:28]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[12:47:57] waldner: But then seds removes the new line when reading it into pattern space, no? [12:47:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	waldner	[12:48:07] yes [12:48:07]

2016-10-19 00:41:22	Soliton	[10:36:43] just using an xml parser seems easier. ;-) [10:36:43]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:37:15] That is true. [10:37:15]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:38:21] Once I made a small C program that gets ftp configuration from (argh) dreamweaver exported xml files. [10:38:21]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:01] I worked in a place where my boss would refuse to give me ftp access to upload site data. He insisted in only giving me the dw config, which has "encrypted" password. [10:39:01]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:18] In C I used a libxml something. [10:39:18]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:56] (he wanted me to use dreamweaver as well) [10:39:56]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:40:23] Then I made a nodejs version of the small program and used a regex to extract the password field. [10:40:23]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:40:42] I really don't think for very simple things like this it hurts that much to use the wrong tool for the job. [10:40:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Soliton	[10:40:54] so xml was the encryption? [10:40:54]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:41:00] Nope. [10:41:00]

2016-10-19 14:34:39	Soliton	[10:36:43] just using an xml parser seems easier. ;-) [10:36:43]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:37:15] That is true. [10:37:15]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:38:21] Once I made a small C program that gets ftp configuration from (argh) dreamweaver exported xml files. [10:38:21]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:01] I worked in a place where my boss would refuse to give me ftp access to upload site data. He insisted in only giving me the dw config, which has "encrypted" password. [10:39:01]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:18] In C I used a libxml something. [10:39:18]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:56] (he wanted me to use dreamweaver as well) [10:39:56]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:40:23] Then I made a nodejs version of the small program and used a regex to extract the password field. [10:40:23]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:40:42] I really don't think for very simple things like this it hurts that much to use the wrong tool for the job. [10:40:42]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Soliton	[10:40:54] so xml was the encryption? [10:40:54]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:41:00] Nope. [10:41:00]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Soliton	[10:41:29] sounded to me like it was clear text in the xml. [10:41:29]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:41:35] It was something like pw="6774766C3537393B3B3F" [10:41:35]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Soliton	[10:41:45] ah, hex encoded. [10:41:45]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:41:52] Inside a <server> xml tag. [10:41:52]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:41:54] Yep. [10:41:54]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:42:10] There is an algorithm on the web to undo that hex thing. [10:42:10]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:42:26] (I just translated it to C/js) [10:42:26]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:44:35] That is dreamwever concept of securing passwords. [10:44:35]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	stevenm	[13:34:14] hey can I get an opinion before I run something... should this result in a single forward slash being in the replace string? [13:34:14]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	stevenm	[13:34:16] sed 's/password=.*/password='yhBv\\\/psyyoEAU'/' [13:34:16]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	stevenm	[13:34:43] the yhBv\\\/psyyoEAU     is actually variable   $tohash  but i've done it this way to show the content [13:34:43]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	stevenm	[13:35:05] tohash generated this way...   tohash=$(perl -e'print crypt("'$topass'", "'$(tr -cd 'a-zA-Z0-9./'</dev/urandom|head -c2)'")'|sed 's/\//\\\\\\\//g') [13:35:05]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Soliton	[13:42:40] might be easier to explain what you're trying to do so someone can write a sane solution. [13:42:40]

2016-10-19 20:40:03	Fernando-Basso	[10:41:54] Yep. [10:41:54]
2016-10-19 20:40:03	Fernando-Basso	[10:42:10] There is an algorithm on the web to undo that hex thing. [10:42:10]

2016-10-20 00:25:32	Soliton	[10:36:43] just using an xml parser seems easier. ;-) [10:36:43]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:37:15] That is true. [10:37:15]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:38:21] Once I made a small C program that gets ftp configuration from (argh) dreamweaver exported xml files. [10:38:21]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:01] I worked in a place where my boss would refuse to give me ftp access to upload site data. He insisted in only giving me the dw config, which has "encrypted" password. [10:39:01]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:18] In C I used a libxml something. [10:39:18]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:56] (he wanted me to use dreamweaver as well) [10:39:56]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:40:23] Then I made a nodejs version of the small program and used a regex to extract the password field. [10:40:23]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:40:42] I really don't think for very simple things like this it hurts that much to use the wrong tool for the job. [10:40:42]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Soliton	[10:40:54] so xml was the encryption? [10:40:54]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:41:00] Nope. [10:41:00]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Soliton	[10:41:29] sounded to me like it was clear text in the xml. [10:41:29]
