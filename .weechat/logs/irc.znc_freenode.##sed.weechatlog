2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:19:40] i think so [01:19:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:19:44] this is schizophrenic [01:19:44]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:19:47] depends on your sed [01:19:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:20:00] how do I get a sed that follows regex properly? [01:20:00]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:20:20] so i can not be doing weird special forms of regex that dont line up with the docs [01:20:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:20:20] theres no such thing as a proper regex [01:20:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:20:33] theres standard, basic, extended, perl [01:20:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:20:39] im probably wrong on one there [01:20:39]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:21:08] either way, that example i gave works [01:21:08]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:21:28] right that works for -that- example [01:21:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:21:33] but lets say i wanted to do an ip address [01:21:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:21:36] thats not good [01:21:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:22:12] (\d{1,3}\.){1,3} or such wont be possible if sed is weird like this [01:22:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:23:04] am i looking for extended? [01:23:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:23:08] yes [01:23:08]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:23:16] im gonna wait for someone else to answer [01:23:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:25:13] but you can do \d\d?\d?\.\d\d? etc [01:25:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:26:12] which is still a terrible solution because ip's only go to 255 [01:26:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:27:07] and i dont think \d works even, you have to do [0-9] [01:27:07]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:27:17] why doesn't \d work? [01:27:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	 *	Phanes [01:27:22] doublechecks the regex doc [01:27:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:27:30] idk, i'm confusing it with awk [01:27:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:27:31] yep, \d is there and doesn't work [01:27:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:27:40] wtf [01:27:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:27:45] oh, i was right [01:27:45]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:28:01] old extended regex doesnt have \d, but gnu sed should have it [01:28:01]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:28:18] i dont understand why this is a thing [01:28:18]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:30:32] standardized tools are impossible to change [01:30:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:35:02] they say perl is better at everything [01:35:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:35:25] and sam is definitely better than sed [01:35:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	yitz	[01:41:12] sed got [[:digit:]] but not \d AFAIK [01:41:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	yitz	[01:41:38] \d isn't found in many regexes [01:41:38]

2016-10-18 00:14:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:02:56] I am not completely sure why echo 'hey' | sed 's/\n//g' doesn't remove the newline. I read in the info page that sed adds a newline back to output if there was one in the input. [10:02:56]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:03:26] Is echo 'hey'<RET> causing sed to see two input lines? [10:03:26]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:08:30] So, sed is removing the '\n' from the input, and that is why I can't remove it myself. [10:08:30]

2016-10-18 05:37:48	Riviera	Fernando-Basso: wasn't so much about emacs, rather about learning something more general first before bothering with extremely specialised tools as sed. :)
2016-10-18 05:38:11	Fernando-Basso	I can't deny your are right.
2016-10-18 05:38:59	Fernando-Basso	When I first met linux and open source / free software (I never know what to call this whole thing) I fell in love with command line things.
2016-10-18 05:39:40	Fernando-Basso	That probably touched me in a way that is stronger than reason.
