2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:19:40] i think so [01:19:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:19:44] this is schizophrenic [01:19:44]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:19:47] depends on your sed [01:19:47]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:20:00] how do I get a sed that follows regex properly? [01:20:00]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:20:20] so i can not be doing weird special forms of regex that dont line up with the docs [01:20:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:20:20] theres no such thing as a proper regex [01:20:20]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:20:33] theres standard, basic, extended, perl [01:20:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:20:39] im probably wrong on one there [01:20:39]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:21:08] either way, that example i gave works [01:21:08]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:21:28] right that works for -that- example [01:21:28]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:21:33] but lets say i wanted to do an ip address [01:21:33]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:21:36] thats not good [01:21:36]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:22:12] (\d{1,3}\.){1,3} or such wont be possible if sed is weird like this [01:22:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:23:04] am i looking for extended? [01:23:04]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:23:08] yes [01:23:08]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:23:16] im gonna wait for someone else to answer [01:23:16]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:25:13] but you can do \d\d?\d?\.\d\d? etc [01:25:13]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:26:12] which is still a terrible solution because ip's only go to 255 [01:26:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:27:07] and i dont think \d works even, you have to do [0-9] [01:27:07]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:27:17] why doesn't \d work? [01:27:17]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	 *	Phanes [01:27:22] doublechecks the regex doc [01:27:22]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:27:30] idk, i'm confusing it with awk [01:27:30]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:27:31] yep, \d is there and doesn't work [01:27:31]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:27:40] wtf [01:27:40]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:27:45] oh, i was right [01:27:45]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:28:01] old extended regex doesnt have \d, but gnu sed should have it [01:28:01]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Phanes	[01:28:18] i dont understand why this is a thing [01:28:18]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:30:32] standardized tools are impossible to change [01:30:32]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:35:02] they say perl is better at everything [01:35:02]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	nal	[01:35:25] and sam is definitely better than sed [01:35:25]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	yitz	[01:41:12] sed got [[:digit:]] but not \d AFAIK [01:41:12]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	yitz	[01:41:38] \d isn't found in many regexes [01:41:38]

2016-10-18 00:14:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:02:56] I am not completely sure why echo 'hey' | sed 's/\n//g' doesn't remove the newline. I read in the info page that sed adds a newline back to output if there was one in the input. [10:02:56]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:03:26] Is echo 'hey'<RET> causing sed to see two input lines? [10:03:26]
2016-10-18 00:14:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:08:30] So, sed is removing the '\n' from the input, and that is why I can't remove it myself. [10:08:30]

2016-10-18 05:37:48	Riviera	Fernando-Basso: wasn't so much about emacs, rather about learning something more general first before bothering with extremely specialised tools as sed. :)
2016-10-18 05:38:11	Fernando-Basso	I can't deny your are right.
2016-10-18 05:38:59	Fernando-Basso	When I first met linux and open source / free software (I never know what to call this whole thing) I fell in love with command line things.
2016-10-18 05:39:40	Fernando-Basso	That probably touched me in a way that is stronger than reason.

2016-10-18 23:55:22	nal	[02:21:35] maybe? [02:21:35]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	yitz	[02:22:53] No [02:22:53]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	yitz	[02:22:59] - isn't a digit [02:22:59]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	nal	[02:28:43] welp, obsd was talking about removing any other localed other than utf8 and C... [02:28:43]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	nal	[02:29:32] and you're right, i kind of noticed 10 seconds after sending but was too lazy to say anything [02:29:32]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Soliton	[07:50:35] Phanes: sed uses basic regular expressions. if you want sed to understand your regex you should, too. [07:50:35]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:02:56] I am not completely sure why echo 'hey' | sed 's/\n//g' doesn't remove the newline. I read in the info page that sed adds a newline back to output if there was one in the input. [10:02:56]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:03:26] Is echo 'hey'<RET> causing sed to see two input lines? [10:03:26]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:08:30] So, sed is removing the '\n' from the input, and that is why I can't remove it myself. [10:08:30]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	go|dfish	[10:19:00] indeed [10:19:00]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:22:45] Also, I now got confused because of the pipes. I did RET not after echo 'hey', but after the pipe and the sed command. [10:22:45]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:23:12] Does RET apply to the echo command as well? [10:23:12]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:23:29] (gnu sed has -z) [10:23:29]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[11:34:19] Fernando-Basso: With RET you mean hitting the enter key, telling the shell to execute the current command line? [11:34:19]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[11:41:38] Yep. [11:41:38]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[11:51:03] Fernando-Basso: That is only relevant for the shell, making it execute the commands. [11:51:03]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[11:51:20] Fernando-Basso: It does not influence sed or echo or any other command, nor do they read it as their input. [11:51:20]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[11:55:15] Riviera: I see, "they don't read it as their input". I was thinking that they did, perhaps under the influence of C (which reads your RET presses as well when using certain functions). [11:55:15]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[11:55:34] Fernando-Basso: C is a programming language, it is not involved here. [11:55:34]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[11:56:07] :D [11:56:07]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[11:56:10] Fernando-Basso: I don't really know what to say, these are severe misconceptions that you have. [11:56:10]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[11:59:35] Unfortunately, yes... [11:59:35]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[12:01:52] You should have listened to me, then. :) [12:01:52]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[12:02:01] When I told you what to learn. :P [12:02:01]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[12:02:46] I did not even start those yet. [12:02:46]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Riviera	[12:33:50] Fernando-Basso: Exactly, because sed (and friends) stand in your way. :) [12:33:50]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[12:35:57] Riviera: I haven't (yet) lost hope that I will eventually learn some of this stuff. [12:35:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	waldner	[12:41:47] echo adds a newline at the end, so sed really sees 'hey\n' as input [12:41:47]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	waldner	[12:42:28] regardless of where you hit enter [12:42:28]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	Fernando-Basso	[12:47:57] waldner: But then seds removes the new line when reading it into pattern space, no? [12:47:57]
2016-10-18 23:55:22	waldner	[12:48:07] yes [12:48:07]

2016-10-19 00:41:22	Soliton	[10:36:43] just using an xml parser seems easier. ;-) [10:36:43]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:37:15] That is true. [10:37:15]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:38:21] Once I made a small C program that gets ftp configuration from (argh) dreamweaver exported xml files. [10:38:21]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:01] I worked in a place where my boss would refuse to give me ftp access to upload site data. He insisted in only giving me the dw config, which has "encrypted" password. [10:39:01]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:18] In C I used a libxml something. [10:39:18]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:56] (he wanted me to use dreamweaver as well) [10:39:56]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:40:23] Then I made a nodejs version of the small program and used a regex to extract the password field. [10:40:23]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:40:42] I really don't think for very simple things like this it hurts that much to use the wrong tool for the job. [10:40:42]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Soliton	[10:40:54] so xml was the encryption? [10:40:54]
2016-10-19 00:41:22	Fernando-Basso	[10:41:00] Nope. [10:41:00]

2016-10-19 14:34:39	Soliton	[10:36:43] just using an xml parser seems easier. ;-) [10:36:43]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:37:15] That is true. [10:37:15]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:38:21] Once I made a small C program that gets ftp configuration from (argh) dreamweaver exported xml files. [10:38:21]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:01] I worked in a place where my boss would refuse to give me ftp access to upload site data. He insisted in only giving me the dw config, which has "encrypted" password. [10:39:01]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:18] In C I used a libxml something. [10:39:18]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:56] (he wanted me to use dreamweaver as well) [10:39:56]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:40:23] Then I made a nodejs version of the small program and used a regex to extract the password field. [10:40:23]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:40:42] I really don't think for very simple things like this it hurts that much to use the wrong tool for the job. [10:40:42]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Soliton	[10:40:54] so xml was the encryption? [10:40:54]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:41:00] Nope. [10:41:00]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Soliton	[10:41:29] sounded to me like it was clear text in the xml. [10:41:29]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:41:35] It was something like pw="6774766C3537393B3B3F" [10:41:35]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Soliton	[10:41:45] ah, hex encoded. [10:41:45]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:41:52] Inside a <server> xml tag. [10:41:52]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:41:54] Yep. [10:41:54]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:42:10] There is an algorithm on the web to undo that hex thing. [10:42:10]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:42:26] (I just translated it to C/js) [10:42:26]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Fernando-Basso	[10:44:35] That is dreamwever concept of securing passwords. [10:44:35]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	stevenm	[13:34:14] hey can I get an opinion before I run something... should this result in a single forward slash being in the replace string? [13:34:14]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	stevenm	[13:34:16] sed 's/password=.*/password='yhBv\\\/psyyoEAU'/' [13:34:16]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	stevenm	[13:34:43] the yhBv\\\/psyyoEAU     is actually variable   $tohash  but i've done it this way to show the content [13:34:43]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	stevenm	[13:35:05] tohash generated this way...   tohash=$(perl -e'print crypt("'$topass'", "'$(tr -cd 'a-zA-Z0-9./'</dev/urandom|head -c2)'")'|sed 's/\//\\\\\\\//g') [13:35:05]
2016-10-19 14:34:39	Soliton	[13:42:40] might be easier to explain what you're trying to do so someone can write a sane solution. [13:42:40]

2016-10-20 00:25:32	Soliton	[10:36:43] just using an xml parser seems easier. ;-) [10:36:43]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:37:15] That is true. [10:37:15]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:38:21] Once I made a small C program that gets ftp configuration from (argh) dreamweaver exported xml files. [10:38:21]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:01] I worked in a place where my boss would refuse to give me ftp access to upload site data. He insisted in only giving me the dw config, which has "encrypted" password. [10:39:01]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:18] In C I used a libxml something. [10:39:18]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:39:56] (he wanted me to use dreamweaver as well) [10:39:56]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:40:23] Then I made a nodejs version of the small program and used a regex to extract the password field. [10:40:23]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:40:42] I really don't think for very simple things like this it hurts that much to use the wrong tool for the job. [10:40:42]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Soliton	[10:40:54] so xml was the encryption? [10:40:54]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Fernando-Basso	[10:41:00] Nope. [10:41:00]
2016-10-20 00:25:32	Soliton	[10:41:29] sounded to me like it was clear text in the xml. [10:41:29]

2016-10-20 23:32:36	watmm	Hey, wondering which is more performant for replacing a line if it exists, else inserting said line - perl or sed?
2016-10-20 23:34:27	go|dfish	tsakos: what operation
2016-10-20 23:35:20	go|dfish	watmm: you would probably have to benchmark it
2016-10-20 23:35:59	watmm	go|dfish: problem is, tmtowtdi
2016-10-20 23:36:16	tsakos	go|dfish: /pattern1/,/pattern2/
2016-10-20 23:36:33	tsakos	go|dfish: sed -n '/pattern1/,/pattern2/p'
2016-10-20 23:37:28	tsakos	I'm trying to extract some html.. pattern2 goes way beyond my pattern, shouldn't just print the first pattern it reaches?
2016-10-20 23:37:28		[23:37]
2016-10-20 23:38:03	tsakos	basically I piped sed into cat -v - just now
2016-10-20 23:38:08	tsakos	output looks weird
2016-10-20 23:38:10	go|dfish	tsakos: it should. http://bpaste.net/raw/531ac64af470
2016-10-20 23:38:27	go|dfish	perhaps it's simpler if you show your data and what you're trying to extract
2016-10-20 23:38:48	tsakos	it's a wikipedia page xD
2016-10-20 23:38:58	go|dfish	{terz}
2016-10-20 23:39:21	tsakos	well, maybe I have some problem with UTF?
2016-10-20 23:39:24	go|dfish	perhaps there are multiple instances of pattern1 and pattern2 - so your range is matching multiple times
2016-10-20 23:39:31	tsakos	ah
2016-10-20 23:39:39	tsakos	yeah, that would be a possibility
2016-10-20 23:40:01	tsakos	so, I can do /pattern1/,/pattern2/pq ?
2016-10-20 23:40:08	tsakos	and just print the first match?
2016-10-20 23:40:41	go|dfish	well one way would be to write it as /pattern1/,/pattern2/{ /pattern2/q; p; }
2016-10-20 23:41:08	go|dfish	well, the p first if you want to print the pattern2 line
2016-10-20 23:41:38	tsakos	aha, cool
2016-10-20 23:41:45	tsakos	thanks a lot!
2016-10-20 23:47:00		[23:41]
2016-10-20 23:47:59	tsakos	well, looks like there is a problem with sed and UTF
2016-10-20 23:48:25	tsakos	it prints non-sense characters like ^M and stuff
2016-10-20 23:48:49	tsakos	but if you pipe sed's output into tee, it works on terminal screen + file
2016-10-20 23:49:19	tsakos	that's why I had problems greping some content also -_-
2016-10-20 23:53:18	Soliton	^M is a carriage return. not really non-sense. presumably you're working with files with windows line endings.
2016-10-20 23:59:00		[23:53]
2016-10-21 00:04:15	tsakos	No, there is not carriage return characters
2016-10-21 00:04:51	tsakos	sed just interprets the stream wrong, I don't know if there is a problem with my UTF setup... locale reports everything UTF-8
2016-10-21 00:05:25	tsakos	grep prints matched lines ok
2016-10-21 00:05:39	tsakos	if I do sed | grep, grep does not print anything
2016-10-21 00:05:46	tsakos	I also verified that with cat -v -
2016-10-21 00:06:09	tsakos	the stream is not the same with the original source file
2016-10-21 00:07:13	Soliton	# printf 'abc\r\n'; printf 'abc\r\n' | cat -v
2016-10-21 00:07:15	shbot	Soliton: abc
2016-10-21 00:07:15	shbot	Soliton: abc^M
2016-10-21 00:07:23	tsakos	Soliton: I know
2016-10-21 00:07:41	tsakos	I have done many many scripts :)
2016-10-21 00:07:55	tsakos	maybe too many haha
2016-10-21 00:08:45	Soliton	well, impossible to say anything as long as you're just making weird claims about bogus ^M characters and utf8 issues without showing anything.
2016-10-21 00:09:10	tsakos	Well, I can show misintrepreted characters
2016-10-21 00:09:19	tsakos	I don't think that makes any sense at all
2016-10-21 00:11:11	tsakos	hmm, ok, I was wrong
2016-10-21 00:11:21	tsakos	cat -v was reporting weird characters
2016-10-21 00:11:50	tsakos	but still, I cannot match something with grep after sed has processed the stream

2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:39:21] well, maybe I have some problem with UTF? [09:39:21]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	go|dfish	[09:39:24] perhaps there are multiple instances of pattern1 and pattern2 - so your range is matching multiple times [09:39:24]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:39:31] ah [09:39:31]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:39:39] yeah, that would be a possibility [09:39:39]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:40:01] so, I can do /pattern1/,/pattern2/pq ? [09:40:01]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:40:08] and just print the first match? [09:40:08]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	go|dfish	[09:40:41] well one way would be to write it as /pattern1/,/pattern2/{ /pattern2/q; p; } [09:40:41]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	go|dfish	[09:41:08] well, the p first if you want to print the pattern2 line [09:41:08]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:41:38] aha, cool [09:41:38]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:41:45] thanks a lot! [09:41:45]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:47:59] well, looks like there is a problem with sed and UTF [09:47:59]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:48:25] it prints non-sense characters like ^M and stuff [09:48:25]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:48:49] but if you pipe sed's output into tee, it works on terminal screen + file [09:48:49]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[09:49:19] that's why I had problems greping some content also -_- [09:49:19]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	Soliton	[09:53:18] ^M is a carriage return. not really non-sense. presumably you're working with files with windows line endings. [09:53:18]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:04:15] No, there is not carriage return characters [10:04:15]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:04:51] sed just interprets the stream wrong, I don't know if there is a problem with my UTF setup... locale reports everything UTF-8 [10:04:51]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:05:25] grep prints matched lines ok [10:05:25]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:05:39] if I do sed | grep, grep does not print anything [10:05:39]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:05:46] I also verified that with cat -v - [10:05:46]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:06:09] the stream is not the same with the original source file [10:06:09]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	Soliton	[10:07:13] # printf 'abc\r\n'; printf 'abc\r\n' | cat -v [10:07:13]

2016-10-24 22:59:38	shbot	[10:07:15] Soliton: abc^M [10:07:15]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:07:23] Soliton: I know [10:07:23]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:07:41] I have done many many scripts :) [10:07:41]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:07:55] maybe too many haha [10:07:55]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	Soliton	[10:08:45] well, impossible to say anything as long as you're just making weird claims about bogus ^M characters and utf8 issues without showing anything. [10:08:45]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:09:10] Well, I can show misintrepreted characters [10:09:10]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:09:19] I don't think that makes any sense at all [10:09:19]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:11:11] hmm, ok, I was wrong [10:11:11]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:11:21] cat -v was reporting weird characters [10:11:21]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:11:50] but still, I cannot match something with grep after sed has processed the stream [10:11:50]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	Soliton	[10:12:45] show your actual input and maybe someone can help. [10:12:45]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:16:15] Ok, found where the problem is lying [10:16:15]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:16:35] thanks for your time anyway :) [10:16:35]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[10:17:58] sometimes you have re-think what you are doing before making assumptions xD [10:17:58]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	Soliton	[10:29:15] that's why it is always better to show what you're actually doing because then other people are actually able to verify your assumptions. [10:29:15]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[11:01:03] forgetting -n in cat (first command) was enough for grep to not match '^<ul>' ;) [11:01:03]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[11:01:28] that was my problem, didn't fixed yet... gone for a break as it was needed xD [11:01:28]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	tsakos	[11:01:37] fixed it* [11:01:37]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	watmm	[16:20:02] I'd like to print three lines from a file that are right after each other, and each line contains a different specific word. [16:20:02]
2016-10-24 22:59:38	Soliton	[16:28:15] ok. [16:28:15]

2016-10-25 05:44:48	Petter	Hm, for literally delete from one pattern to the last of another pattern. Here's what I came up with:
2016-10-25 05:44:57	Petter	# printf '%s\n' normal1 del-start del-stop1 normal2 del-stop2 normal3  |  sed -n '/del-start/{ :a; n; /del-stop/!ba; n; :b; N; $!bb; s/.*\n[^\n]*del-stop[^\n]*\n//; }; p;'
2016-10-25 05:44:59	shbot	Petter: normal1
2016-10-25 05:44:59	shbot	Petter: normal3
2016-10-25 05:45:26	Petter	Note though, that at some point it buffers of the rest of the input stream.
2016-10-25 05:47:00	Petter	If the task is rather to delete to the second end pattern it's not necessary to buffer up.
2016-10-25 05:47:09	Petter	# printf '%s\n' normal1 del-start del-stop1 normal2 del-stop2 normal3  | sed -n '/del-start/{ :a; n; /del-stop/!ba; :b; n; //!bb; d; }; p;'
2016-10-25 05:47:10	shbot	Petter: normal1
2016-10-25 05:47:10	shbot	Petter: normal3
2016-10-25 05:48:31	Petter	The first one is GNU sed only because of [^\n]* (at least).

2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:07:23] Soliton: I know [10:07:23]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:07:41] I have done many many scripts :) [10:07:41]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:07:55] maybe too many haha [10:07:55]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Soliton	[10:08:45] well, impossible to say anything as long as you're just making weird claims about bogus ^M characters and utf8 issues without showing anything. [10:08:45]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:09:10] Well, I can show misintrepreted characters [10:09:10]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:09:19] I don't think that makes any sense at all [10:09:19]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:11:11] hmm, ok, I was wrong [10:11:11]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:11:21] cat -v was reporting weird characters [10:11:21]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:11:50] but still, I cannot match something with grep after sed has processed the stream [10:11:50]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Soliton	[10:12:45] show your actual input and maybe someone can help. [10:12:45]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:16:15] Ok, found where the problem is lying [10:16:15]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:16:35] thanks for your time anyway :) [10:16:35]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[10:17:58] sometimes you have re-think what you are doing before making assumptions xD [10:17:58]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Soliton	[10:29:15] that's why it is always better to show what you're actually doing because then other people are actually able to verify your assumptions. [10:29:15]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[11:01:03] forgetting -n in cat (first command) was enough for grep to not match '^<ul>' ;) [11:01:03]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[11:01:28] that was my problem, didn't fixed yet... gone for a break as it was needed xD [11:01:28]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	tsakos	[11:01:37] fixed it* [11:01:37]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	watmm	[16:20:02] I'd like to print three lines from a file that are right after each other, and each line contains a different specific word. [16:20:02]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Soliton	[16:28:15] ok. [16:28:15]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Petter	[16:28:54] Hehe. [16:28:54]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Petter	[16:52:49] watmm: Is this something you are working on currently? Is it going alright? [16:52:49]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Nimitz14	[15:18:15] #awk [15:18:15]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	izalove	[15:34:04] yeah [15:34:04]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	saml	[14:55:18] how can I delete lines between a line that matches a pattern  and another line that matches different pattern? [14:55:18]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	gnomon	[15:02:29] saml, like so: printf '%s\n' {1..20} | sed -e '/^7$/,/^12$/d' [15:02:29]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	saml	[15:06:11] thanks.  looks like the end line pattern, ^12$ is repeating twice in the input stream.. so I want to delete from first match of ^7$  to last match of ^12$ [15:06:11]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Petter	[15:44:48] Hm, for literally delete from one pattern to the last of another pattern. Here's what I came up with: [15:44:48]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Petter	[15:44:57] # printf '%s\n' normal1 del-start del-stop1 normal2 del-stop2 normal3  |  sed -n '/del-start/{ :a; n; /del-stop/!ba; n; :b; N; $!bb; s/.*\n[^\n]*del-stop[^\n]*\n//; }; p;' [15:44:57]

2016-10-25 11:42:06	shbot	[15:44:59] Petter: normal3 [15:44:59]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Petter	[15:45:26] Note though, that at some point it buffers of the rest of the input stream. [15:45:26]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Petter	[15:47:00] If the task is rather to delete to the second end pattern it's not necessary to buffer up. [15:47:00]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	Petter	[15:47:09] # printf '%s\n' normal1 del-start del-stop1 normal2 del-stop2 normal3  | sed -n '/del-start/{ :a; n; /del-stop/!ba; :b; n; //!bb; d; }; p;' [15:47:09]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	shbot	[15:47:10] Petter: normal1 [15:47:10]
2016-10-25 11:42:06	shbot	[15:47:10] Petter: normal3 [15:47:10]
