2016-09-14 16:01:41	anik	Going through a book, and the author states that removing static from second file's sum and count variables will cause the program to operate incorrectly. However, when I tried it, everything worked fine. http://ideone.com/ZhNYHD
2016-09-14 16:02:11	anik	The book is 12 years old.
2016-09-14 16:04:34	kalven	anik: static globals have internal linkage, meaning they're visible only to the .cpp file they are defined in. if you had a 'static int sum' in main.cpp, it would be distinct from the one in second.cpp

2016-09-15 02:12:53	Galik	serengeor: its about object lifetime. You store your smart pointers in objects that live as long as they do (or longer). Everything that dies before the smart pointer usually doesn't need the smart pointer passed to it

2016-09-15 02:16:42	Galik	The generally accepted idea is you should generally return a unique_ptr because that doesn't force a specific pointer type on the caller because they can always release it into their preferred owner
2016-09-15 02:18:22	Galik	The benefit is it helps to provide exception safety

2016-09-15 08:46:27	Dydzio	you do not even refer to "colors" name to access them, (with c++11 you can to, though)
2016-09-15 08:46:29	SlashLife	e.g. in the above example, red would be *represented* by 0, yellow by 1 (and so on) ...

2016-09-15 08:46:42	SlashLife	... but the expression "red + 1" simply doesn't make sense.
2016-09-15 08:46:46	Dydzio	yeah, by default if you dont provide any values, first enum is 0
2016-09-15 08:46:58	Dydzio	and any next enum without value is "last enum value +1"
2016-09-15 08:47:11	Dydzio	so red = 0, orange = 1, yellow = 2 etc
2016-09-15 08:47:23	SlashLife	So ideally forget about the representation, and just take them as raw values.
2016-09-15 08:47:38	SlashLife	red is red, yellow is yellow ... and how they are stored is black magic.
2016-09-15 08:48:04	anik	ok :)
2016-09-15 08:48:04	Dydzio	yeah, enums are set of defines that can use words that replace numbers
2016-09-15 08:48:10	Dydzio	aw
2016-09-15 08:48:12	SlashLife	color magic_type = black; // ^_^"
2016-09-15 08:48:17	Dydzio	actually not "set of defines" but work similar
2016-09-15 08:48:55	Dydzio	if you design game you can for example use enum attack_type {melee, ranged, magic }
2016-09-15 08:49:07	SlashLife	Oh, I think I actually did that.

2016-09-15 09:01:14	SlashLife	A function by that name should return a body part, not a damage multiplier.
2016-09-15 09:01:48	SlashLife	And if body_part potentially is an enum, then its values should not be defined to be damage multipliers.
