2016-09-16 01:26:31	Lachezar	Hey all. Is it possible to create a symbolic link that applications are not allowed to resolve? I've got an SSD, and I have a directory in it that I've symlinked from my home directory /home/user/fast -> /data/user/fast. Th eproblem is that most applications (even my terminal emulator) resolve the link and use the /data/user/fast in configuration files and etc, which is a bummer, since now I can not make

2016-09-16 21:44:29	tiny	farrioth: my thoughts exactly. Was thinking about BSD
2016-09-16 21:44:37	gtxbb	rockworld, bluetooth on ovh?
2016-09-16 21:44:47	rockworld	I dont need bluetooth
2016-09-16 21:44:49	rockworld	on that
2016-09-16 21:44:50	rockworld	lool
2016-09-16 21:44:51	gtxbb	rockworld, here i use ovh, but i dont see the need for bt XD
2016-09-16 21:44:54	farrioth	rockworld: Try asking to install bluez specifically and see if you get a more detailed error.
2016-09-16 21:45:14	gtxbb	rockworld, iirc there's issues with bt updates if there's a fail with a module in /etc/modprobe.d/ ...
2016-09-16 21:45:18	farrioth	rockworld: Oh? If you don't need bluethooth then you can probably get rid of bluez*.

2016-09-16 21:45:37	farrioth	tiny: I have no complaints with it.
2016-09-16 21:45:46	cr1t1cal	farrioth: anything else?
2016-09-16 21:45:50	rockworld	I should do apt-get --purge bluez
2016-09-16 21:45:51	rockworld	?
2016-09-16 21:45:56	gtxbb	rockworld, you need to check more verbosity(details) from the logs on that error..
2016-09-16 21:46:03	gtxbb	rockworld, yeah you can try purging..
2016-09-16 21:46:06	farrioth	rockworld: sudo apt-get remove bluez* ?
2016-09-16 21:46:12	gtxbb	rockworld, but if it removes many many packages then you'll have to find another way
2016-09-16 21:46:17	farrioth	rockworld: Yeah, doesn't hurt to purge in this case.
2016-09-16 21:46:18	tiny	farrioth: how does it behave on major brands server hardware like HP,IBM,...
2016-09-16 21:46:20	rockworld	alright :)
2016-09-16 21:46:23	rockworld	its ok
2016-09-16 21:46:32	rockworld	I will try it and I will tell you if its ok
2016-09-16 21:46:33	farrioth	rockworld: This is unless some other stuff you need depends on it.

2016-09-16 21:49:04	gtxbb	nabblet, you can change the pager to man if you wish by using PAGER var or creating a custom symlink called "pager" to point to it

2016-09-16 21:49:19	gtxbb	nabblet, the n,N keyboard shortcuts is for the program "less" that is reading manpages

2016-09-17 02:03:24	ohcanada	each partition start has a signature. testdisk can trawl thru the whole drive looking for them, if they still exist, and rebuild table. i think gpart can do that also

Device files are created by the OS to make life easier for programmers to communicate with actual, physical devices. They would thus read from the device file like any other file, except when it's a character device they read character by character. When it's a block device they read one block at a time.

2016-09-18 06:18:14	pskosinski	Hello. You can speed up the video and audio in both mplayer and smplayer (GUI for mplayer) using square brackets: [ to slow down, ] to speed up. When I do that in mplayer people start to talk using high pitched voices, like Alvin and chipsomething, Smurfs, etc. When I do that in Smplayer then it speeds up BUT the voices stay normal. Why?

2016-09-18 08:34:10	gtxbb	my suggestion is to just use that one tweak.

2016-09-18 11:49:17	rascul	subvhome you could use cut to get the fifth field per line, then it would probably be easy enough in bash to see if it's greater than 10 and act on it

2016-09-18 13:24:34	binaryc	[22:54:33] pleasures of restoring from 2 Month old cold backup, getting all of my dotfiles and keybidnings back to how i am used to. [22:54:33]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	debkad	[22:57:47] Hi swift110 [22:57:47]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	vegenaise	[22:59:50] hi ##linux, wondering if anyone might have a sec to help me (a terminal noob) amend a command i have for a bash script [22:59:50]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	swift110	[23:00:04] how are you debkad [23:00:04]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	gsaul	[23:00:22] vegenaise: sure, what's the issue [23:00:22]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	debkad	[23:00:25] I'm great thanks swift110 for asking [23:00:25]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	debkad	[23:01:13] just ask vegenaise don't let it inside it hurt [23:01:13]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	vegenaise	[23:02:13] thanks gsaul, here's what i did: i was using "find / -type f -name "*.torrent" -exec rm -f {} \;" to find all torrent files and delete them. however i think it may be doing it globally, whereas i would like it to only to pertain to one folder (~/downloads). would like to use this as a simple script for a cron job to clear out the folder daily [23:02:13]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	gsaul	[23:03:03] well, the / in find is the starting point [23:03:03]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	gsaul	[23:03:31] so if you want it to work in only a certain directory, try find /home/vegenaise/Downloads [23:03:31]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	debkad	[23:03:54] there is -delete in find better than -exec [23:03:54]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	vegenaise	[23:03:59] so, i could amend it to say "find /home/vegenaise/documents/ .... blah blah) and it would only remove the torrents from that folder, leaving them elsewhere on the system? [23:03:59]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	debkad	[23:04:07] you can use -print to see if it find them [23:04:07]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	vegenaise	[23:04:26] oops, meant downloads, not documents, but yea [23:04:26]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	gsaul	[23:04:38] Yes [23:04:38]
2016-09-18 13:24:34	debkad	[23:04:40] yes vegenaise [23:04:40]

2016-09-18 13:24:34	jim	[23:08:59] find has a lot of power in that it's recursive (on dirs) and expressive since it has a lot of filters and tests that can be part of the expression [23:08:59]

2016-09-18 14:09:04	gsaul	I'd just like to interject for moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

2016-09-18 14:19:10	r7st	i don't see what is difficult about debian i've always used it
2016-09-18 14:19:12	ananke	starsailor: there are plenty of tools that are not installed by default to meet my specific work tasks. yet i don't resort to claiming that something is 'difficult' merely because of that
2016-09-18 14:19:19	rascul	the only real difference between distros is what's included by default and perhaps the package management system
2016-09-18 14:19:29	r7st	nothing about a distro with a package manager is difficult

2016-09-18 14:20:00	Loshki	I had installation problems with debian, something about my specific sound card not being supported due to 'purity' issues, something Ubuntu didn't seem to suffer from.
2016-09-18 14:20:19	whoa	is GPL3 gonna take off ? or is everything still GPL2 in the linux kernel?
2016-09-18 14:20:21	starsailor	Loshki: "purity"? you mean some non-free stuff being needed?

2016-09-18 14:20:22	ryouma	i find debian's initramfs stuff really problematic, but debian hits the sweet spot more than any other distro i know
2016-09-18 14:20:29	rascul	Loshki non free drivers are not included by default, but that's easy to rectify
2016-09-18 14:20:33	r7st	Loshki: you just have to add the non-free repo into your sources then update

I will wait for a higher-vote turn-out, if I see there's only an improvement on my systems, it could be due to a factoring change that was also made.

2016-09-19 02:43:46	madprops	[12:11:30] FrejaSE, hmm, and if I make it load in javascript would that probably avoid that? [12:11:30]
2016-09-19 02:43:46	FrejaSE	[12:12:02] probably [12:12:02]
2016-09-19 02:43:46	FrejaSE	[12:12:49] afaik it just crawls pictures. videos it ignores, but it tries to find thumbnail and such which the website often provide so they can be indexed [12:12:49]
2016-09-19 02:43:46	FrejaSE	[12:13:36] you can also tell it to not crawl using robots.txt [12:13:36]
2016-09-19 02:43:46	madprops	[12:14:14] i don't mind search engine crawlers [12:14:14]
2016-09-19 02:43:46	madprops	[12:14:22] i just dont want my server to be blasted [12:14:22]
2016-09-19 02:43:46	peetaur2	[12:16:02] btw I changed my mind....obv. image search bots will read images too [12:16:02]
2016-09-19 02:43:46	FrejaSE	[12:16:49] madprops: maybe you could exclude just the video files with robots.txt [12:16:49]
2016-09-19 02:43:46	FrejaSE	[12:17:31] in javascript i believe you have to write it cryptic, because crawlers just read the plain source, and if they see a link they will crawl it [12:17:31]

I'm having a little difficulty finding an answer to a question I have about the 'nohup' command by searching the web, so hoping someone here might know. . . if you use nohup to launch a script, will the processes launched by that script also ignore SIGHUP? What about processes launched by those processes (e.g. I have a script that launches rsync, which in turn launches ssh to secure...
2016-09-19 05:09:48	jsbiff	...the rsync communications)
