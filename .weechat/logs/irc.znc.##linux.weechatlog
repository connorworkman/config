2016-09-16 01:26:31	Lachezar	Hey all. Is it possible to create a symbolic link that applications are not allowed to resolve? I've got an SSD, and I have a directory in it that I've symlinked from my home directory /home/user/fast -> /data/user/fast. Th eproblem is that most applications (even my terminal emulator) resolve the link and use the /data/user/fast in configuration files and etc, which is a bummer, since now I can not make
